President Donald Trump has promised to lower them and Democratic senators, led by Elizabeth Warren, wrote a letter in January calling on the White House to look into producers' and retailers' pricing practices.\n\nTrump touted the decrease during an unrelated press event on Friday.\n\n\"By the way, price of eggs is down 35% in the last week and a half. We're doing a good job,\" he said.\n\nFor what consumers actually paid at the store in February, egg prices jumped another 10.4% from January -- 159% over the year ago level, with an average price of $5.90 per dozen, up $0.94 per dozen from last month, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics Consumer Price Index, which is released monthly.",

He said most of the casualties were civilians, and the number of those killed and injured will be updated as rescue and recovery efforts continue.\n\nThe strikes are the largest and most significant military action that Trump has taken in his second term.\n\nThe Houthi attacks were carried out by fighter jets from the Harry S. Truman aircraft carrier, now in the northern Red Sea, as well as Air Force attack planes and armed drones launched from bases in the region, according to a source familiar with the plan.\n\nTrump approved the plan on Friday, the source added.\n\nIn this screen grab from a video posted to X, CENTCOM forces launch a large scale operation against Iran-Backed Housthis in Yemen, on March 15, 2025. @CENTCOM / X\n\nThe strikes Saturday are the result of several high-level White House meetings this week with Trump and top national security aides, including Vice President J.D.

There had been no other airstrikes since then partly because the Houthis stopped attacking ships during the ceasefire between Hamas and Israel.\n\nIn this handout image provided by the US Navy, the Nimitz-class aircraft carrier USS Harry S.

The Houthi rebels had initially framed their attacks as a way to pressure Israel to stop the war that was launched following the Oct. 7 terrorist attack. But as shippers began to avoid the regions of the Gulf of Aden and the Red Sea, the rebel strikes still continued.",

Somebody did it a long time ago, many, many decades ago, and makes no sense,\" he said Thursday. \"This would be the most incredible country visually.\"\n\n\"'O, Canada,\" the national anthem, I love it.

Ron Wyden, the ranking member on the committee, however, slammed Oz during his introduction, calling him out over his past comments and actions. Wyden, D-Ore., noted Oz has had a history of promoting Medicare Advantage companies and baseless wellness remedies and claimed if confirmed the nominee would \"coddle the for profit insurance companies.\"\n\n\"Dr. Oz will be calling the shots of what gets cuts, or what stays,\" he said.\n\nOz did not commit to preventing cuts to Medicaid or Medicare.\n\nWyden grew frustrated when Oz failed to answer \"yes\" or \"no\" when he asked whether Oz would oppose any cuts to the program.\n\n\"I cherish Medicaid,\" Oz responded, saying he's \"worked within the Medicaid environment quite extensively.\"\n\nSen.

Elizabeth Warren, in particular, has been increasingly vocal ahead of the hearing about Oz's financial ties to health care companies that he will now oversee in his role at CMS and his past comments about privatizing Medicare, one of the programs he'll manage.\n\nShe also criticized what she calls his \"hostile record\" on abortion rights, referring to Oz's comments on the campaign trail that a woman's decision to get an abortion should be made by her, her doctor and \"local political leaders.\"\n\n\"The implication that elected officials should be involved in a woman's personal health treatment decision is terrifying and antithetical to patient health,\" Warren wrote to Oz on Thursday.\n\nRepublicans came to Oz's defense and also pushed their agenda for the agency, specifically in upholding the Hyde Amendment.\n\nThe amendment has banned the use of any federal funds for abortion, only allowing exceptions to pay for the procedure when the life of the mother is at risk or the pregnancy results from rape or incest. Medicaid, for example, does not cover abortion services beyond those exceptions — though some states use their own funds to do so.\n\nSen. Steve Daines of Montana, argued that Biden took action to expand abortion access in ways that were \"explicitly in violation of the Hyde Amendment.\"\n\n\"If you're confirmed, will you commit to upholding the Hyde Amendment and ensuring that our federal health care programs are not providing abortions on the taxpayers' dime?\" he asked Oz.\n\nThe nominee said he would.\n\nDr. Mehmet Oz, President Donald Trump's pick to lead the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, testifies at his confirmation hearing before the Senate Finance Committee, on Capitol Hill in Washington, Mar. 14, 2025.

They reviewed Oz's taxes from 2021 to 2023.\n\nThe committee staff reviewed Oz's tax returns and met with the nominee, his accountant and his lawyers earlier in March. Oz and his team maintained that he was not liable for the taxes the Democrats said he owed, according to the memo.\n\nOz in the past has expressed support for Medicare Advantage , a Medicare-approved plan run by private insurance companies.

Mark Schiefelbein/AP\n\nThis claim is not true based on data reviewed by ABC News. The U.S. is not ranked last in education nor does it spend the most per pupil.\n\nThe White House didn't respond to ABC News' request for information about Trump's claim. It's unclear which data Trump used to base his claims.\n\nEven though the country spends a lot per pupil, the Education Data Initiative found an average of $20,387 per year of federal, state and local spending. The amount is the third-highest per pupil (after adjusting to local currency values). The country is not last in any education statistic that ABC News has reviewed.\n\nThe U.S. is above average in reading and science, and about average when it comes to scores in math, according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development's (OECD) Program for International Student Assessment (PISA). PISA is the industry standard for ranking students from different countries, according to education experts. There are roughly 40 member countries and economies in the OECD and about 40 more countries have participated in the last three assessments. It varies by year -- in 2015, 70 countries and economies participated; in 2018, 78 participated.\n\nIn 2022, the most recently released data, roughly 81 countries took part in OECD's PISA assessments, which measure 15-year-olds' ability to use their reading, mathematics and science knowledge. The U.S. ranked ninth out of 81 in reading, 16th/81 in science, and 34th/81 in math, according to the 2022 PISA results.\n\nThe PISA results debunk Trump's long-standing claim that \"we're at the bottom of every list.\"\n\nThe next PISA data collection is taking place in 2025 -- and is expected to be released in September 2026, according to an OECD spokesperson.\n\nHowever, this is not to say American students are always high achievers. Some results on nationally administered exams have shown concerns as of late.\n\nAmerica's fourth- and eighth-grade students' sliding reading scores worsened in 2024, according to the National Assessment of Educational Progress, dubbed the nation's report card, which is administered by the National Center for Education Statistics under the Department of Education. Compared to 2022, this year's average reading scores dropped by 2 points for both fourth- and eighth-grade assessments, according to the NCES data conducted between January and March 2024. That adds to the 3-point decrease for both grades in 2022.\n\nDespite the decline in reading, there was some recovery in math in 2024, but the increase has not returned students to pre-pandemic levels.\n\nAnd NCES also found nearly one third of U.S. students ended the 2023-2024 school year behind grade level in at least one academic subject.\n\nIt is unclear whether this data will be collected in future years if the DOE is eliminated.\n\nState and local education agencies\n\nThe Trump administration has stated that through cuts at the Department of Education, they want to return education to the states.\n\n\"The president wants to return education back to the states, empower those closest to the people to make these very important decisions for our children's lives. And ... this is a first step in that process,\" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said to ABC News' Selina Wang when asked about the cuts at the DOE.\n\nEducation is a local level-issue already as the federal education department only administers roughly 10% of public school funds nationwide, according to multiple education experts.\n\nChloe Kienzle of Arlington, Va., holds a sign as she stands outside the headquarters of the U.S. Department of Eduction, which were ordered closed for the day for what officials described as security reasons amid large-scale layoffs, Mar. 12, 2025, in Washington. Mark Schiefelbein/AP\n\nThe Department of Education does not administer curriculum or create lessons for the nation's students. It also does not set requirements for enrollment and graduation or establish or accredit schools or universities.\n\nIn fact, curriculum comes from the states and local school districts. The education department doesn't teach the students taking standardized exams and assessments. The states already do that.\n\nThe education department does hold schools accountable for enforcing non-discrimination laws based on race, gender and disability.\n\nThe agency also administers funds for K-12 education support programs such as the Rural Education Achievement Program, which supports rural districts that may lack personnel and resources; Title I, which funds programs aimed at improving the performance of low-income and low-achieving schools; and grants for Individuals with Disabilities including the Transition and Postsecondary Programs for students.\n\nNot only does the department administer K-12 assistance, it also helps students pursue higher education through the office of Federal Student Aid through grants, work-study funds and low-interest loans.\n\nFinally, the DOE holds schools accountable for student achievement through the Every Student Succeeds Act, which requires each state to provide data on subject performance, graduation rates, suspensions, absenteeism, teacher qualifications and more.\n\nThe Education Department's mission is to promote student achievement and preparation for global competitiveness by fostering educational excellence and ensuring equal access, according to ed.gov.\n\nDOE employees showing up to work\n\nTrump has claimed, without evidence, that many Department of Education employees weren't going to work or doing a good job.\n\n\"Many of them don't work at all. Many of them never showed up to work. Many of them, many of them never showed up to work,\" Trump said at the White House on Wednesday.\n\nThe White House did not respond to ABC News' request for comment about where Trump got this information.\n\nBased on dozens of interviews, ABC News reporting has not found any evidence of employees \"never\" showing up to work, as Trump claimed.\n\nABC News has spoken to employees tasked with everything from conducting critical research projects to enforcing anti-discrimination laws for students based on race, gender and disability, among other characteristics.\n\nWhen the Department of Education cut nearly 50% of its workforce earlier this week, an email to those who remained employed said, \"Please know that these decisions were not made lightly, and in no way reflect on the dedication and hard work of those who are leaving.\"\n\nJoe Murphy, whose position as a management and data analyst was eliminated at the Department of Education earlier this week, said on Wednesday that he felt \"disposable.\"\n\n\"We got the sense that we were disposable in a certain sense, especially those of us in the data space,\" he told ABC News.\n\nVictoria DeLano was an Equal Opportunity Specialist in the education department's Office for Civil Rights serving people with disabilities. DeLano said she believes she was the sole employee within the OCR who was stationed in Alabama.\n\n\"It's horrifying that the Office for Civil Rights, to begin with, is understaffed, but then, when I was locked out of access to work last week, to think, OK, one more person that was taken out of the equation,\" Delano said.\n\n\"These students have no one else. They can still file complaints with OCR. Please understand OCR is understaffed at best, and OCR right now does not have external communication with you all. So I don't know where they turn,\" she added.\n\nA regional Department of Education employee, who received the reduction in force email on Tuesday and spoke to ABC News on the condition of anonymity for fear of retribution, said their civil rights office was abolished.\n\nOffices in major cities including San Francisco, New York, Cleveland, Boston, Chicago and Dallas have shuttered, and the three U.S. Department of Education buildings in D.C. will eventually be consolidated, according to senior department of education officials.\n\n\"All those disabled kids, which is the bulk of our docket, will not be helped,\" the employee said.",

Francesco Spotorno/AP\n\nOn March 5, Konanki was part of a group that went to a nightclub and then for a walk on the beach, three Dominican officials involved in the investigation told ABC News. Most of the group went back to the hotel around 5:55 a.m. One man -- 22-year-old Joshua Riibe, a college senior in Minnesota -- stayed with Konanki on the beach, and the two went for a swim, according to a Dominican Republic investigative police report.\n\nRiibe, who met Konanki that night, confirmed he and and the 20-year-old kissed after a night of drinking, he told a prosecutor Thursday, according to a transcript provided to ABC News from two Dominican Republic sources.\n\n\"A big wave came and hit us both, then the tide pulled us into the ocean,\" he told the prosecutor. \"When we surfaced, we tried to plead for help, but there was no one there.\"\n\nSudiksha Konanki is seen in this undated photo shared to Meta. Sudiksha Konanki via Meta\n\nRiibe, a pool lifeguard, said he \"held her under my arm and swam to get her out of the water.\"\n\n\"I was trying to make sure that she could breathe the entire time -- that prevented me from breathing the entire time and I took in a lot of water,\" he explained.\n\n“When I finally touched the sand, I put her in front of me. Then she got up to go get her stuff since the ocean had moved us,\" Riibe told the prosecutor. \"She was not out of the water since it was up to her knee. She was walking at an angle in the water.\"\n\n\"The last time I saw her, I asked her if she was OK. I didn't hear her response because I began to vomit with all the water I had swallowed,\" he said. \"After vomiting, I looked around and I didn't see anyone. I thought she had taken her things and left.\"\n\n\"After I saw her walking away, while she was walking in the water, I never saw her again,\" he said.\n\nRiibe said he passed out on a beach chair and woke up to the sun and mosquitoes on him. He was seen on surveillance footage returning to his room several hours later.\n\nAuthorities said Riibe is not a suspect and is cooperating. But the prosecutor’s office said it is \"conducting multiple investigating steps that extend beyond a possible accidental event.\"\n\nRiibe is \"deeply dismayed by her disappearance and has fully cooperated in the search,\" his parents, Albert and Tina Riibe, said in a statement Friday.\n\n\"His faith and values have guided his path, and those who know him can attest to his integrity and good heart,\" they said.\n\n\"Despite his full willingness to cooperate, Josh has been detained under irregular conditions and subjected to extensive questioning without the presence of official translators or legal counsel until Wednesday,\" his parents alleged. \"We recognize that this is a complex and painful situation for all parties involved, and we trust that the investigation will be conducted with transparency and justice. Our only interest is that due process be respected and that actions be taken with the fairness that the situation requires.\"\n\n\"We express our deep sorrow and solidarity with the family of Sudiksha Konanski during this painful time,\" the parents said. \"Above all, we wish to contribute to the search efforts and understand the anguish and uncertainty they are going through and we share the hope that Sudiksha will be found as soon as possible.\"\n\nABC News' Caroline Guthrie contributed to this report.",

Pool via AP\n\n\"Flights are actively departing and plan to depart. I do not believe that I am able to wait any longer,\" Boasberg said.\n\nHe also ordered the Trump administration to immediately turn around two planes carrying noncitizens if they are covered by his order, including one that potentially took off during a break in the court's hearing.\n\n\"You shall inform your clients of this immediately any plane containing these folks that is going to take off or is in the air needs to be returned to the United States,\" he said. \"However that's accomplished, turning around the plane, or not embarking anyone on the plane…this is something that you need to make sure is complied with immediately.\"\n\nFinding the deportations would cause irreparable harm, Boasberg barred the Trump administration from deporting \"all non-citizens who are subject to the AEA proclamation\" for at least 14 days. ICE will continue to keep the noncitizens in their custody while the lawsuit makes its way through the courts.\n\n\"I think there's clearly irreparable harm here given that these folks will be deported and many – or the vast majority – to prison or back to Venezuela where they face persecution or worse,\" he said.\n\nBefore Judge Boasberg issued his order, a lawyer with the DOJ declined to say whether any deportations were ongoing, arguing disclosing \"operational details\" would raise \"potential national security issues.\" He later acknowledged that two flights -- one to El Salvador and another to Honduras -- had already departed.\n\nFILE PHOTO: Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents detain a man after conducting a raid at the Cedar Run apartment complex in Denver, Colorado, U.S., February 5, 2025. REUTERS/Kevin Mohatt/File Photo Kevin Mohatt/Reuters\n\nBoasberg also raised concerns that the Venezuelans would be sent to a prison in El Salvador, rather than their home country.\n\n\"No only are they going to be deported, but it's not going to be to friendly countryside but to prison,\" Judge Boasberg said.\n\nThe hearing comes as the Trump administration claimed that the president's Article II powers give him the authority to unilaterally deport any person who poses a \"significant threat\" to the United States. DOJ lawyers argued that the temporary restraining order would pose an \"irreparable harm\" to Trump's authority.\n\nEarlier in the day, Boasberg temporarily blocked the deportation of five noncitizens and said he is now considering extending his temporary restraining order to cover a broader class of noncitizens.\n\nLawyers with the ACLU alleged that the Trump administration was actively deporting \"hundreds\" of Venezuelan migrants to El Salvadoran prisons.\n\n\"Our understanding from people on the ground from different sources is that planes are going right now taking Venezuelans to El Salvador and maybe ending up in El Salvador in prison,\" said ACLU's Lee Gelernt. \"Not only will that divest this court of jurisdiction, but I think those people are in real trouble.\"\n\nJudge Boasberg suggested the plaintiffs succeeded in proving how they will be harmed by Trump's order.\n\n\"I think they've made out the harm that will befall individual plaintiffs upon removal,\" he said.\n\nLawyers with the Department of Justice asked the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit to enter an administrative stay of the lower court's temporary restraining order, which blocks the Trump administration from invoking the AEA.\n\n\"This Court should halt this massive, unauthorized imposition on the Executive's authority to remove dangerous aliens who pose threats to the American people,\" they said in the filing.\n\nThe government argued that Boasberg overstepped his authority, declined to hear a response from the Trump administration before ruling and is \"setting the stage to potentially inject itself into all such removals nationwide.\"\n\nBoasberg previously oversaw the United States Alien Terrorist Removal Court and was nominated to federal judicial roles by both Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama.\n\nThe ACLU is representing five plaintiffs it believes have been moved to detention centers in Texas intended to be \"staging facilities to remove Venezuelan men under the AEA,\" court documents show. Four of the five plaintiffs have been accused of being members of Tren de Aragua.\n\nThe ACLU claims they have been wrongfully accused of being gang members, some seemingly only based on their tattoos, despite the fact that some are seeking protection in the United States from the same gang they're now accused of being a part of.\n\nThe AEA states that it can only be invoked when there is a war with or an invasion by a foreign government or nation. It allows the president to order all citizens of that foreign nation who are not naturalized in the U.S. to be arrested and removed \"as alien enemies.\"\n\nIn essence, members of that hostile nation could be swiftly removed from the country with little to no due process.\n\nThe ACLU argues that the government would be illegally invoking the act to target alleged members of Tren de Aragua because the gang is not a nation and there is no invasion as outlined by U.S. law.\n\n\"The Trump administration's intent to use a wartime authority for immigration enforcement is as unprecedented as it is lawless. It may be the administration's most extreme measure yet, and that is saying a lot,\" said Lee Gelernt, deputy director of the ACLU's Immigrants' Rights Project and lead counsel.\n\nThe Department of Defense is not expected to have a role in the invoking of the authority, which could be used to deport some migrants without a hearing.\n\nThere have been discussions inside the administration about invoking the act, multiple sources said.\n\nTrump had previously said on the campaign trail that he planned to invoke the act.\n\nThe act hasn't been used since World War II when it was used to detain Japanese Americans.\n\nJapanese aliens taken into custody by FBI agents in a surprise raid in the Santa-Maria-Guadalupe area, are unloaded from an army truck at the courthouse at Santa Barbara, Calif., Feb. 18, 1942. where they were brought for examination. AP\n\nDuring World War II, the Alien Enemies Act was partially used to justify the internment of Japanese immigrants who had not become U.S. citizens. The broader internment of Japanese-Americans was carried out under executive orders signed by President Franklin D. Roosevelt and not the Alien Enemies Act since the law does not apply to U.S. citizens.",

Mark Schiefelbein/AP\n\n\"We will lose counselors, social workers, behavior specialists -- people who ensure safety and stability for students who need it most,\" Robert Castleberry, a fifth grade teacher in Kansas and the American Federation of Teachers' Kansas secretary, said in a statement to ABC News.\n\n\"I hope this change by the government doesn't set educators back years while our states are working to try and figure out how to distribute all those funds,\" said Michael Brix, an instructor at the Peoria Public Schools' Woodruff Career and Technical Center in Illinois and a member of the Peoria Federation of Teachers.\n\n​As President Donald Trump is expected to sign an executive order proposing to return education power to states, senior Department of Education officials stressed the massive reforms on Tuesday are going to help the department get funding to states in a more cost-efficient way.\n\n\"What we are doing now is not working,\" the officials said. \"It's just not, so it’s time for change and that's what’s starting tonight.\"\n\nBut Kini said the cuts this will exacerbate preexisting issues of teacher shortages and lack of funding that has already been prevalent in America.\n\n\"Our schools are already grossly underfunded in Connecticut,\" said Jennifer Graves, special education teacher in New Haven, Connecticut, and vice president of New Haven Federation of Teachers. \"We are really, really struggling already and constantly working in a deficit model to support not only general education students but especially our most vulnerable populations -- our multilingual learners and our students with disabilities.\"\n\nAs a result, teachers could become more overworked and struggle to accommodate student demands, with Kini speculating that classes could get combined and offer less individualized attention.\n\n\"Or they may cut some courses like electives altogether because they don't have teachers to teach it,\" she continued. \"They may staff classes with substitute teachers or long-term substitute teachers ... who aren't trained for the job, and none of those options are good for student learning.\"\n\nMike Carvella, a third grade math and science teacher in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, told ABC News during a rally on Friday how students with individualized education plans, or IEPs, can be denied by private schools, causing them to flood the public school system and subsequently affect teachers.\n\n\"That's going to put more kids with IEPs into more underfunded public schools and put more pressure on public school teachers and public school districts to educate kids who are already marginalized and already have learning problems,\" he said.\n\nKini noted the coronavirus pandemic in which teachers faced shortages and were forced to pick up \"more of the burden\" while simultaneously juggling their own responsibilities.\n\nAn exterior view of the Department of Education building on Mar. 13, 2025 in Washington. Alex Wong/Getty Images\n\nShe also emphasized how vital federal funding programs are for allocating resources to marginalized students.\n\n\"The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) funds teacher training and professional development for special education teachers, and that's a huge chunk of federal funding that's going to be impacted. It's going to impact the numbers of special education positions,\" Kini said. \"The same is true for Title 1 funding for low-income students and Title 3 funding for multilingual students.\"\n\nIDEA is a law that ensures free public education to children with disabilities, including special education and other resources.\n\nThe DOE promised that it would continue delivering all statutory programs, including funding for special needs and disadvantaged students, formula funding, student loans and Pell Grants for low-income students.\n\nYet sources told ABC News that most of the reduction in force affected the Offices for Civil Rights and Federal Student Aid, effectively terminating many of the department's employees who are tasked with investigating discrimination within schools and helping the nation's students achieve higher education.\n\nKini spoke to the job cuts at OCR, emphasizing that students will not be protected from unlawful discrimination and explaining how this would consequently force teachers to pick up an additional responsibility and \"play more of that watchdog role.\"\n\nCommunity members rally in front of the Department of Education to protest budget cuts, Mar. 13, 2025 in Washington. Kayla Bartkowski/Getty Images\n\nWhen asked about the future of teaching, Kini expressed a bleak outlook over the likelihood of young people seeking to pursue education as a career.\n\n\"It would be a little bit of speculation there, but I think it would be a reasonable conclusion for a young person today to look at what's happening with the uncertainty in education, and particularly with the cuts to the U.S. Department of Education, and say, 'You know what? That doesn't seem like a stable career choice for me right now,'\" Kini said.\n\nJim Ward, a retired educator and retired National Education Association employee who traveled from St. Louis, Missouri, to Washington, D.C., for Friday's #EDMatters Rally outside the department's headquarters, emphasized to ABC News how students remain the most important priority.\n\n\"All the dedicated educators that are here today are serving in those classrooms because they care about the needs of every single student, not just the ones that look like them -- although their workforce is quite diverse, too -- which you might not see in some of the more exclusive private schools,\" Ward said.\n\nLori Stratton of Kansas also attended the rally, telling ABC News how \"meaningful\" it was for her to be present on Friday.\n\n\"I've been a teacher for 34 years. Most of my sons are in education. My husband's in education. Most of my family's in education. This is our business. You know, we are believers,\" she said. \"We have dedicated our lives to supporting students in public schools, and I feel like it's an American value. I feel like there is not a bigger democratic American value than supporting education.\"",

The two astronauts planned to spend about a week on the ISS, but that brief stop turned into a nine-month mission when NASA determined that it was unsafe to bring them home on the Boeing Starliner spacecraft they rode into orbit.\n\nThe duo arrived at the ISS in early June, but in September, NASA opted to bring the Starliner back home empty due to concerns about technical issues with the craft. This mission marked Boeing's first crewed flight of the Starliner. An empty Starliner landed safely back on Earth on Sept. 6.\n\nThe two American astronauts became part of the ISS Crew-9 team and have been actively engaged in research and maintenance of the station ever since. The extended time in space also allowed Williams to break the record for the most spacewalking time by a woman, with 62 hours and 6 minutes in the vacuum of space.\n\nNASA has long insisted that Williams and Wilmore were never stuck or stranded.\n\nNASA's Boeing Crew Flight Test astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams inside the vestibule between the forward port on the International Space Station's Harmony module and Starliner spacecraft.

Several weeks later, American astronaut Nick Hague and cosmonaut Aleksandr Gorbunov arrived at the station onboard the SpaceX Crew Dragon Freedom spacecraft. Both vehicles have remained docked to the ISS and available for emergencies ever since.\n\nThe SpaceX Crew Dragon Freedom capsule that brought Hague and Gorbunov to the ISS is currently docked at the station will be the one that brings Williams, Wilmore and the two other Crew-9 astronauts back home. Endurance will remain docked at the station along with the Soyuz.\n\nThere is a period of overlap when the new team and the current crew of seven work collaboratively to ensure a smooth handover. NASA has said Williams and Wilmore could be home as soon as Wednesday.\n\nNASA said that Crew-10 will conduct more than 200 scientific experiments and technology demonstrations during their mission to help humans eventually go deeper into space.",

It came after the USTR office earlier this year said it would be conducting a \"review of unfair trade practices.\"\n\nThe letter, dated March 11, comes from the company of tech billionaire Elon Musk, who has been leading the effort to slash government spending and downsize the federal workforce. It's unclear if Musk was personally involved in sending the letter, and he has not addressed it on his social media platform, X.\n\nAs ABC News has reported, some Tesla shareholders have publicly questioned Musk's commitment to the company as Tesla shares have fallen dramatically since Musk joined the Trump administration.\n\n\"As a U.S. manufacturer and exporter, Tesla encourages USTR to consider the downstream impacts of certain proposed actions taken to address unfair trade practices,\" the letter said.\n\nTesla representatives did not respond to questions from ABC News, including questions regarding who wrote the letter. A White House spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nIn the letter, Tesla noted that tariff actions by the Trump administration have resulted in \"immediate reactions\" by the targeted countries, including increased tariffs on electric vehicles.\n\nPresident Donald Trump, accompanied by White House Senior Advisor, Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk, speaks next to a Tesla Model S on the South Lawn of the White House, Mar. 11, 2025 in Washington.

And you're the people that are doing it.\n\n\"Under the Trump administration, the DOJ and the FBI will once again become the premier crime fighting agencies on the face of the earth,\" he added.\n\nHe used the setting to repeat his now-familiar accusation that the Justice Department was \"weaponized\" to attack him.\n\n\"We must be honest about the lies and abuses that have occurred within these walls. Unfortunately, in recent years, a corrupt group of hacks and radicals within the ranks of the American government obliterated that trust and goodwill built up over generations,\" he said. \"They weaponized the vast powers of our intelligence and law enforcement agencies to try and thwart the will of the American people.\"\n\nPresident Donald Trump speaks at the Department of Justice in Washington, Mar. 14, 2025. ABC News\n\n\"Our predecessors turned this Department of Justice into the Department of Injustice,\" continued Trump, who became a convicted felon in May 2024 after he was found guilty on 34 felony counts in New York. \"But I stand before you today to declare that those days are over, and they are never going to come back. They're never coming back. So now, as the chief law enforcement officer in our country, I will insist upon and demand full and complete accountability for the wrongs and abuses that have occurred.\"\n\nFBI Director Kash Patel and Emil Bove Acting Deputy Attorney General of the United States listen to President Donald Trump speak at the Department of Justice in Washington, Mar. 14, 2025. Roberto Schmidt/AFP via Getty Images\n\nThe rare visit marks Trump's first time inside the walls of the Robert F. Kennedy building as president, and as such his first since crowds of his supporters stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6 and were subsequently charged by the DOJ, and follows nearly a decade's worth of conflict that have proven to be the ultimate stress test for the Justice Department's post-Watergate norms intended to preserve independence from the White House.\n\nTrump himself faced four criminal court cases, but all remaining charges were dropped when he was elected president -- but not because the cases lacked merits -- allowing him to avoid serious consequences. The president denied all the allegations and said the cases were politically motivated.\n\nThe opening weeks of Trump's presidency have been a time of unprecedented upheaval for the DOJ, as Trump's political leadership immediately moved to reassign or oust career officials who served in senior criminal and national security roles across multiple administrations.\n\nPresident Donald Trump and Attorney General Pam Bondi arrive to speak at the Department of Justice in Washington, Mar. 14, 2025. Roberto Schmidt/AFP via Getty Images\n\nDozens of prosecutors who worked on investigations stemming from the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol were fired, as well as DOJ and FBI officials who worked on former special counsel Jack Smith's investigations of Trump.\n\nAn effort by the department to drop its criminal corruption case against New York City Mayor Adams resulted in a dramatic standoff leading to multiple resignations by prosecutors and other top officials who described the arrangement as a clear \"quid pro quo\" to secure Adams' cooperation with the administration's aggressive immigration enforcement efforts.\n\nHowever, in the very same speech in which the president griped about his own prosecutions, he suggested that his predecessor should be jailed for the way his administration handled the Afghanistan withdrawal.\n\n\"What a shame. The way we got out, I think it was the most humiliating time in the history of our country,\" he said. \"The way it happened. Not that we were getting out because we wanted to get out, but we would have gotten out with dignity and strength. And what a difference a rigged and crooked election had on our country, when you think about it. And the people who did this to us should go to jail, they should go to jail. So, I just want to say, God bless America because we have to say God bless. We're lucky we're still here.\"\n\nThe FBI seal outside the J. Edgar Hoover FBI Building, Nov. 8, 2024, in Washington. Aaron M. Sprecher/AP\n\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt previewed Trump's remarks on Fox News, saying that it will be focused on \"restoring law and order,\" but she added that he might also discuss \"ending the weaponization of justice.\"\n\n\"Donald Trump will go to the Department of Justice to visit with Attorney General Pam Bondi and Kash Patel to give a speech not just to the Department of Justice but to the American people about Donald Trump's intention to restore a justice department that is truly focused on fighting crime and restoring law and order in American communities,\" Leavitt said on Fox News.\n\nShe also previewed the remarks when asked by reporters at the White House on Friday morning, saying that Trump will be joined by families who have lost children \"at the hands of illegal migrant criminals\" and because of \"illegal Chinese fentanyl.\"\n\nIn remarks Thursday to reporters at the White House, Trump said his speech a thet DOJ would \"set out\" his \"vision\" for the department through the rest of his tenure.\n\n\"I think we have unbelievable people, and all I'm going to do is set out my vision. It's going to be their vision, really, but it's my ideas,\" he said. \"We want to have justice, and we want to have -- we want to have safety in our cities as well as our communities. And we'll be talking about immigration. We'll be talking about a lot of things.\"\n\nSpecial Counsel Jack Smith speaks at his offices in Washington, June 9, 2023. Leah Millis/Reuters\n\nNearly every top appointee for the department previously represented Trump as a defense attorney in either an official or personal capacity, a reflection of Trump's expectation for loyalty from a department that he has said he believes stymied his first term and was later \"weaponized\" against him after leaving office.\n\nWhile Attorney General Pam Bondi told senators in her confirmation hearing she would \"not politicize\" her office, her opening weeks, critics argue, have been marked with politically charged statements repeatedly emphasizing her loyalty to Trump.\n\n\"I've never seen this before, and we all adore Donald Trump and we want to protect him and fight for his agenda,\" Bondi said in an interview with Trump's daughter-in-law Lara Trump.\n\nIn another interview early this month, Bondi said she was still working to \"root out\" officials at the department who she said \"despise Donald Trump.\"\n\nIn one of her first directives following her confirmation, Bondi ordered DOJ officials to \"zealously defend\" the interests of the presidency and threatened discipline or termination for any attorney who refused to sign onto legal arguments put forward by political leadership.\n\n\"When Department of Justice attorneys, for example, refuse to advance good-faith arguments by declining to appear in court or sign briefs, it undermines the constitutional order and deprives the President of the benefit of his lawyers,\" the directive stated.\n\nTrump's visit to DOJ is his first to any government agency since taking office, though it's not without precedent. The last visit by a sitting American president to the building was when former President Barack Obama attended a departure ceremony in 2015 for Eric Holder -- for a retirement ceremony honoring his time as attorney general.\n\nABC News' Kelsey Walsh contributed to this report.",

You think that's demeaning to people with gender dysphoria?\" U.S. District Judge Ana Reyes asked a DOJ attorney on Wednesday during a hearing on the service member ban.\n\n\"I can't answer that question,\" he responded.\n\nReyes later rebuked each of the DOJ lawyers after they admitted that none of them had read any of the scientific studies used to support the ban in sworn court filings.\n\nDuring a contentious hearing in Maryland on Wednesday about Trump's mass firings -- which eventually led the judge overseeing the case to order approximately 20,000 government employees be reinstated -- a DOJ lawyer couldn't answer when a judge pressed him to confirm how many employees had been terminated.\n\nPresident Donald Trump speaks at the Department of Justice in Washington, Mar. 14, 2025. Andrew Harnik/Getty Images\n\n\"More than 50 or less than 50? ... More than 100 or less than 100? ... Less than 1,000?\" Judge James Bredar asked, to which the attorney replied that he couldn't make an estimate at that time.\n\n\"You don't know? ... Does anyone in the government know?\" the judge continued to press, only for the government's attorney to again say he doesn't know.\n\nFor a hearing on an emergency order to block an executive order against the law firm Perkins Coie, the Department of Justice opted to send Chad Mizelle, Attorney General Pam Bondi's chief of staff, to argue on behalf of the government. Mizelle's full-throated defense of the policy -- which bans lawyers from the firm from entering any government building -- led Judge Beryl Howell to remark that the sweeping nature of some of his arguments sent \"chills down my spine.\"\n\n\"When you say that if the president, in his view, takes the position that an individual or an organization or a company is operating a way that is not in the nation's interests, he can issue an executive order like this and take steps to bar that individual, that entity, that company from doing any business with the government, terminate whatever contracts, they've got, bar them from federal buildings?\" Howell said.\n\n\"I mean, that's a pretty extraordinary power for the president to exercise,\" the judge said.\n\n\"If he made a finding that there's a national security risk with a particular law firm, then yes,\" Mizelle replied.\n\nDuring Friday's address at the Justice Department, Trump alleged, without presenting evidence, that media organizations and the Democratic Party were colluding to challenge his administration -- and he urged the lawyers to fight back.\n\n\"They are horrible people. They are scum,\" Trump said of those who oppose him in court. \"We will have these cases where you cannot allow yourselves to be deflected. You just cannot let it happen. You have such a higher calling.\"\n\nTrump's visit to DOJ headquarters, during which he laid out his vision for the department and repeatedly suggested his appointees should jail his political enemies, was a departure from decades of post-Watergate norms where DOJ leadership has sought to maintain an appearance of independence from the White House on criminal matters.",

We're ready to pass a four week spending bill that keeps the government open and will allow the House and the Senate to negotiate an actual agreement that meets the needs of the American people,\" Jeffries, D-N.Y., said. \"But we do not support a bill that is designed to hurt the American people that Donald Trump and far right extremist Republicans are trying to jam down the throats of everyday Americans.\"\n\nJeffries continued to push for a month-long stop-gap measure, holding out hope that Senate Democrats will stop the bill from passing and appropriators will reconvene bipartisan negotiations.\n\n\"We'll see what happens over in the Senate, there are still undecided and undeclared senators, and we anxiously await that vote,\" Jeffries said.\n\nAs the caucus melts down internally over Schumer's decision, House Democratic leaders returned to the Capitol fired up Friday morning following their caucus retreat in Leesburg, Virginia this week.\n\n\"What the American people need to know is that House Democrats are willing to work in a bipartisan way to keep government open for 30 days,\" House Democratic Caucus Chairman Pete Aguilar, D-Calif., said. \"That's all we want.

        "source": "https://abcnews.go.com/",
        "content": "In a test vote, the Senate voted 62 to 38 to advance the bill.\n\nThe Senate passed a House-approved government funding bill that averts a government shutdown that was set to be triggered at the end of the day Friday.\n\nThe Senate voted 54 to 46 to pass the bill. The approval of the bill follows several Democrats voting with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., to keep the funding bill moving forward despite blowback from other members of their party.\n\nSen. Angus King, an independent who caucuses with the Democrats, and Sen. Jeanne Shaheen voted in favor of the bill. All other Democrats voted against it.\n\nSen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., was on the only Republican to cast a vote against the bill.\n\nEarlier, 10 Senate Democrats provided the necessary votes to allow a test vote to advance. Democrats voted with Minority Leader Chuck Schumer to keep the funding bill moving forward, despite blowback from other members of their party.\n\n\"I know a lot of members didn't like the CR -- the government shutdown would be far worse. A government shutdown gives Donald Trump, Elon Musk and DOGE almost complete power … to close down because they can decide what is an essential service,\" Schumer said on CNN between the votes.\n\n\"My job as leader is to lead the party,\" he added. \"And if there's going to be danger in the near future to protect the party. And I'm proud I did it.\"\n\nThe vote comes after Schumer took to the Senate floor Friday morning to defend his decision to support the Republican short-term funding bill -- a move that has drawn criticism from other Democrats.\n\nHis surprise reversal, first announced Thursday evening -- a day after he said he and Democrats would try to block the bill -- means there will almost certainly be enough Democratic votes to advance the measure to a final Senate vote Friday just hours before the shutdown deadline.\n\n\"As everyone knows, government funding expires at midnight tonight. As I announced yesterday, I will vote to keep the government open. I believe it is the best way to minimize the harm that the Trump administration will do to the American people,\" Schumer said Friday.\n\nHe said he believes the short-term funding bill -- or continuing resolution -- is a \"bad bill\" but said he believes if the government were to shut down, it would be a far worse outcome for the country.\n\n\"The CR is a bad bill. But as bad as the CR is, I believe allowing Donald Trump to take even much more power via a government shutdown is a far worse option,\" Schumer said.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer speaks on the floor of the Senate, Mar. 14, 2025. Senate TV\n\nSchumer said he believed a government shutdown would mean President Donald Trump and Elon Musk and his Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) would have even more authority to \"destroy vital government services at a much faster rate.\"\n\nHe said they would also have the power to determine which federal employees are considered essential -- potentially giving them more power to lay off or fire more government workers and shutter federal agencies.\n\n\"A shutdown would allow DOGE to shift into overdrive. Let me repeat, a shutdown will allow DOGE to shift into overdrive. It would give Donald Trump and DOGE the keys to the city, state and country,\" he said. \"Donald Trump and Elon Musk would be free to destroy vital government services at a much faster rate than they can right now and over a much broader field of destruction that they would render.\"\n\nHe continued, \"In a shutdown, Donald Trump and DOGE will have the power to determine what is considered essential and what is not and their views on what is not essential would be mean and vicious and would decimate vital services and cause unimaginable harm to the American people.\"\n\n\"Musk has told everybody he wants a shutdown because he knows it will help him achieve his horrible goal of just decimating the federal government from one end to the other. In other words, if government were to shut down, DOGE has a plan in place to exploit the crisis for maximum destruction,\" Schumer said.\n\n\"A shutdown would be the best distraction Donald Trump could ask for,\" he added.\n\nSchumer also defended some of his Senate Democratic colleagues who have come out opposed to the short-term funding bill. He acknowledged the tough decisions they as a caucus had to weigh.\n\n\"Our caucus members have been torn between two awful alternatives, and my colleagues and I have wrestled with which alternative would be worse for the American people,\" Schumer said.\n\nPresident Donald Trump speaks to the press as he meets with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington, Mar. 13, 2025. Pool via AP\n\nTrump praised Schumer in a post on his social media platform on Friday, saying it took \"guts\" for the New York senator to signal his support for the GOP bill.\n\n\"Congratulations to Chuck Schumer for doing the right thing -- Took \"guts\" and courage! The big Tax Cuts, L.A. fire fix, Debt Ceiling Bill, and so much more, is coming,\" Trump posted on Truth Social.\n\n\"We should all work together on that very dangerous situation. A non pass would be a Country destroyer, approval will lead us to new heights. Again, really good and smart move by Senator Schumer. This could lead to something big for the USA, a whole new direction and beginning,\" Trump wrote.\n\nTwo separate letters were sent to Schumer on Friday, urging senators to reject the GOP continuing resolution -- one from freshman California Rep. Derek Tran and the second from Ranking Member of House Appropriations Committee Rep. Rosa DeLauro of Connecticut.\n\nTran's letter, which has 66 signatures so far and is addressed directly to Schumer, states that \"as members of the House Democratic Caucus, we write to express our strong opposition to the passage of a partisan continuing resolution that potentially legitimizes President Trump and the Republican party's dismantling of government.\"\n\n\"We urge you to reject the partisan continuing resolution coming before the Senate and stand with the American people in opposing these draconian Republican cuts. All parties must come back to the negotiating table and work across party lines to keep the government open in a responsible way,\" the lawmakers wrote.\n\nDeLauro's letter, which came from Democratic lawmakers on the Appropriations Committee, echoed similar sentiments.\n\n\"As members of the House Committee on Appropriations, we urge our Democratic colleagues in the Senate to reject the partisan and harmful continuing resolution that will only serve to enable President Trump, Elon Musk, and the Republican Party's ongoing efforts to unilaterally and unlawfully destroy the agencies and programs that serve the American people,\" the appropriators said.\n\n\"We urge all Senate Democrats to stand with House Democrats and with the American people, reject this continuing resolution,\" they added.\n\nFormer Speaker Nancy Pelosi, appeared to be distancing herself from Schumer's decision, slammed Democrats who support the House GOP bill.\n\n\"America has experienced a Trump shutdown before -- but this damaging legislation only makes matters worse. Democrats must not buy into this false choice. We must fight back for a better way. Listen to the women, For The People,\" she said in a statement Friday.\n\nAt the same time, Pelosi applauded House Democrats for their near unanimous vote against the measure.\n\n\"I salute Leader Hakeem Jeffries for his courageous rejection of this false choice, and I am proud of my colleagues in the House Democratic Caucus for their overwhelming vote against this bill,\" she said.\n\nABC News' Isabella Murray contributed to this report.",

We were very suspicious that he had COVID,\" Shriner, an infectious disease specialist and the hospital's medical director of infectious disease and infection prevention, told ABC News.\n\nTesting was minimal at the time, but eventually the results came back and confirmed that he had COVID. The patient was eventually sedated and intubated, and he died 24 hours later. Shriner said the next few patients admitted to the hospital for COVID-19 followed similar trajectories, becoming more and more short of breath before eventually dying of their illness.\n\n\"As physicians, we understand death,\" Shriner said. \"We understand that we can't save every patient, but when you're having 100% mortality with your first experience with this thing, it was pretty overwhelming and daunting. That first week [was] particularly surreal.\"\n\nTuesday, March 11, marked five years since the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the global outbreak of COVID-19 to be a pandemic. The U.S. is in a much better situation now, with fewer hospitalizations and deaths -- and vaccines to prevent severe illness from COVID, front-line health care workers say.\n\nHowever, they add that, as Americans become more removed from the early days of COVID, it may be hard to remember what it was like -- especially for those who were treating patients.\n\n\"Everybody was worried, doctors, nurses,\" Dr. Matthew Sims, director of infectious disease research for Corewell Health, a non-profit health care system located in Michigan, told ABC News. \"It was absolutely crazy, and I think that people have forgotten.

Apu Gomes/AFP via Getty Images\n\nQuickly changing world\n\nShriner said one of the indicators of how quickly the world was changing was the evolution of her hospital's meetings about the virus and how to prepare as information was starting to come out of China.\n\n\"Meetings were held in a very tiny, little meeting room. Nobody was wearing masks or anything,\" she said. \"And then as things began to evolve, and we saw it was happening, that the rooms got started getting bigger, and then we started meeting with masks on, and then, eventually, went virtual.\"\n\nShriver recalled that the situation was \"very terrifying\" on a personal and professional level.\n\n\"If we'd known how difficult it was going to be, I think we would have been even more disturbed,\" she said.\n\nSims said it became clear how quickly patients could get infected in March 2020. Not long after the WHO declared a global pandemic, he came on shift that week to be the infectious disease doctor rotating in the hospital.\n\n\"We had two confirmed cases admitted at that point. By the end of the week I spent on, we had over 100 confirmed cases admitted,\" he told ABC News. \"It was absolutely devastating to the hospital, to the health care system as a whole ... It was a crazy time.\"\n\nThe state of hospitals\n\nBoth Sims and Shriner said the lack of early testing at the time was a source of frustration. Since routine testing wasn't available, results often took days -- or even weeks -- to return.\n\nAdditionally, hospital labs often had to confirm results with state departments of health.\n\nSim said as the hospitals became full, it sometimes became a race against the clock to try and treat patients.\n\nA patient is taken from an ambulance to the emergency room of a hospital in the Navajo Nation town of Tuba City during the 57-hour curfew, imposed to try to stop the spread of the Covid-19 virus through the Navajo Nation, in Arizona, May 24, 2020.

A week before, he was home with his kids, his wife, et cetera, in normal state of health, and then, all of a sudden, got this terrible virus and died.\"\n\nAs it became clear how contagious the virus was, hospital staff were required to always wear masks. Shriner said she still has a scar or imprint on her nose from having to wear a mask for 18 hours a day.\n\nOne of things she remembers most was the lack of sound, other than machines, whenever she visited ICUs.\n\n\"As the months progressed, we ended up having six different intensive care units because the patients were so sick,\" she said. \"We had many, many patients that were on ventilators. You'd walk into these areas, and it was just silence. All you heard were the ventilators going and seeing people in full protective gear all the time.\"\n\nTo handle the influx of patients, both hospitalized and in emergency departments, Shriner said her hospital stopped all non-emergency surgeries to be able to have extra physicians available.\n\nCOVID-19 vaccines arrive\n\nOn Dec. 11, 2020, the FDA granted Pfizer-BioNTech the first emergency use authorization for a COVID-19 vaccine for those aged 16 and older. Three days later, nurse Sandra Lindsay became the first person to receive a COVID-19 vaccine in the U.S. as distribution began.\n\nBoth Shriner and Sims felt a sense of relief that a tool was finally available to help stem the spread of disease.\n\nShriner said she was the first person in her hospital to receive the COVID-19 vaccine, even though she didn't want to be.\n\nCOVID-19 vaccine is stored at -80 degrees celsius in the pharmacy at Roseland Community Hospital, Dec. 18, 2020, in Chicago.

She said, 'If you don't get vaccinated, nobody else is going to do it.'\"\n\nShriner said the distribution of the vaccine \"was a sign of the way out. It was very hopeful.\"\n\nLessons learned\n\nBoth Sims and Shriner say COVID-19 taught health care workers many lessons, including how to share information quickly, how to diligently monitor diseases and how to scale up health care capacity.\n\nSims said another valuable discovery was better communicating to the public that information during a public health crisis can change rapidly.\n\nOne example is that early studies would come out suggesting certain drugs might help treat patients. Eventually additional information would be published proving the opposite.\n\n\"We were learning, and we were learning in such a rapid [way], it was hard to communicate,\" he said. \"I think if we had any failure, it was that in that rapid push to communicate.\"\n\nSims noted how that created some uncertainty.\n\n\"We didn't get the message across enough that some of what we're learning may be wrong, and we will tell you that as we learn,\" Sims said. \"We're going to tell you what we know now that may not be the same thing we know tomorrow.\"\n\nShriner added that stay-at home orders and lockdowns were hard on people and, if another pandemic happens, she is hopeful there would be different decisions on what should be locked down.\n\n\"Maybe we don't have such stringent lockdown rules and isolation rules,\" she said. \"You know, the outdoor restaurant became a great thing. You know, think of all the home delivery services really took off. And so, a lot of good things came out of it, but they were hard won.\"",

Chuck Edwards was confronted by angry constituents during a town hall meeting on Thursday night about President Donald Trump and Elon Musk's sweeping cuts across the federal government.\n\n\"How do you justify cuts to staff of the VA helping veterans, especially those with long-term care needs?\" asked one constituent, who was met with a standing ovation from the raucous crowd in Asheville, North Carolina.\n\n\"So, first of all, there have been no cuts to the staff at VA as of this point. Like him or not, Elon Musk has brought a lot of really smart people,\" Edwards responded as the crowd booed. Earlier this month, an internal VA memo indicated that the agency was preparing to lay off 80,000 from its workforce.\n\nThe scene turned so contentious and hostile that security had to escort Edwards from the building.\n\n\"You don't get to do this to us,\" yelled another constituent.\n\nRepublican leadership has told their members to avoid in-person town halls after several members were grilled in their home districts.\n\nEdwards, however, went against their advice on Thursday.\n\nA man shouts at Rep.

But why do we shy away from those conversations?\" he added.\n\n\"The time is now to fix how Washington works. To that end, I was proud to vote recently for the House budget resolution,\" he said, interrupted by boos and yells of \"traitor.\"\n\n\"And you wonder why folks don't want to do these town halls,\" he said.\n\nThe Trump administration is pushing forward with sweeping cuts with thousands of workers already having been laid off across the federal workforce, including Veteran Affairs, the IRS and the Department of Education.\n\nMusk has sparked controversy by suggesting that entitlement programs such as Medicare and Social Security could be cut.\n\n\"The waste and fraud in entitlement spending, which is all of the, which is most of the federal spending is entitlements, so that's like the big one to eliminate,\" Musk said in an interview on Fox.\n\nThat has left some voters very concerned, with Edwards taking the brunt end of the attacks Thursday night.\n\n\"What are you doing to ensure the protection of our Social Security benefits,\" asked on constituent to a round of applause.\n\n\"I'm not going to vote to dissolve your Social Security. I'm not looking to disrupt Social Security at all,\" Edwards replied.",

But there is a nuance,\" Putin said of a 30-day ceasefire during a press briefing. \"First, what are we going to do with the encirclement in the Kursk region?\"\n\nHe said the situation in Kursk is \"completely under our control, and the group that invaded our territory is in isolation,\" and that it would be \"very good for the Ukrainian side to reach a truce for at least 30 days.\"\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy countered Friday that Putin is \"lying\" about the conflict and is blocking any diplomatic efforts to end the war.\n\n\"Putin is lying about the real situation on the battlefield, he is lying about the casualties, he is lying about the true state of his economy, which has been damaged by his foolish imperial ambitions, and he is doing everything possible to ensure that diplomacy fails,\" he said.\n\n\"Putin cannot exit this war because that would leave him with nothing,\" he continued. \"That is why he is now doing everything he can to sabotage diplomacy by setting extremely difficult and unacceptable conditions right from the start even before a ceasefire.\"\n\nThe claim that Ukrainian forces are surrounded was also shot down by defense analyst Michael Kofman, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment who focuses on the Russian and Ukrainian militaries, who called it \"simply untrue.\"\n\nGeorge Barros, the Russian team lead for the Washington, D.C.-based Institute for the Study of War, also reacted on X to Trump's remarks, saying, \"Available evidence from the battlefield does not indicate any Russian encirclements of Ukrainian forces at scale, and certainly not by the thousands.\"\n\nUkrainian forces pushed into Kursk last August in a surprise offensive, seizing the town of Sudzha and surrounding villages. Kyiv's troops have repelled months of Russian counteroffensives, but recent weeks have seen their salient crumble and Russian forces retake significant ground.\n\nDuring a visit to a command center in Kursk on Wednesday while clad in military fatigues, Putin said, \"Your task is to completely destroy the enemy, which has entrenched itself in the Kursk region and is still conducting warfare here, and fully liberate the Kursk region's territory within the shortest possible time.\"\n\nRussia's President Vladimir Putin Putin visits a command point for the Kursk group of troops involved in the counteroffensive in the Kursk region, Mar. 12, 2025.

The timing of that conversation will be determined once Witkoff reports to Trump, he said.",

Kennedy Jr. testifies before a Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP) Committee confirmation hearing on Capitol Hill in Washington, January 30, 2025.\n\nMeasles is continuing to spread across the United States, as outbreaks grow in western Texas and New Mexico.\n\nBetween the two states, 256 cases have been confirmed as of Thursday, mostly in those who are unvaccinated or with unknown vaccination status, according to state health officials. At least one unvaccinated school-aged child in Texas has died and another suspected death is being investigated in New Mexico in an unvaccinated adult. At least 10 other states have also confirmed cases, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nAs health care professionals work to care for patients, they are also attempting to combat the proliferation of misinformation about how to prevent and treat the disease, some tell ABC News.\n\nHealth and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has been one of the prominent voices on measles, making comments that public health experts say are not accurate.\n\nIn multiple interviews, Kennedy has claimed that vitamin A and cod liver oil are effective treatments for measles. He also said that poor diet contributes to severe cases of measles and that -- while vaccines prevent illness -- they also cause severe illnesses and even death.\n\nSome public health experts told ABC News these statements are not rooted in scientific evidence and could be quite dangerous for the public.\n\n\"I think it's really important to try to stay away from these ideas of fringe theories or ideas that have not been scientifically proven,\" Kirsten Hokeness, director of the school of health and behavioral sciences at Bryant University, in Rhode Island, told ABC News.\n\nRobert F. Kennedy Jr. testifies before a Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP) Committee confirmation hearing on Capitol Hill in Washington, January 30, 2025. Nathan Howard/Reuters\n\nVitamin A as a form of treatment\n\nDuring an interview on Fox News with Sean Hannity on Tuesday, Kennedy said that HHS was currently providing vitamin A to measles patients for treatment. He claimed vitamin A can \"dramatically\" reduce measles deaths.\n\nThe World Health Organization recommends two doses of vitamin A in children and adults with measles to restore low vitamin A levels, which can help prevent eye damage and blindness.\n\nHowever, experts who spoke with ABC News said it is not an antiviral treatment against measles (meaning it does not prevent infections), nor is there one available.\n\n\"Because it has been described that patients with vitamin A deficiency can have a more severe course, the WHO recommends low doses of vitamin A for children diagnosed with measles,\" Dr. Carla Garcia Carreno, a pediatric infectious disease specialist at Children's Medical Center Plano in Texas, told ABC News. \"This is a supplementation in case of deficiency, and it is not intended to treat the virus. High doses of vitamin A can have serious consequences.\"\n\n\"Neither vitamin A nor cod liver oil will treat measles,\" she concluded.\n\nPoor diet linked to severe measles disease\n\nKennedy has claimed that poor nutrition plays a role in causing severe measles disease and that a healthy diet can lessen severity.\n\nWhile malnutrition can be a factor in severe disease, malnutrition and nutritional deficits in measles patients have historically been seen in underdeveloped countries, according to experts.\n\nAdditionally, studies have found that mass nutritional supplementation \"followed by an increase in vaccination coverage\" can reduce measles infection and mortality.\n\n\"Certainly, good nutrition can promote a healthy immune system, and it's a good idea for everyone to try to maintain good nutrition, but it's certainly not a substitute for vaccination,\" Dr. Scott Weaver, director of the Institute for Human Infections and Immunity at the University of Texas Medical Branch, told ABC News. \"There's no evidence that it can prevent infection, no evidence that it can prevent an infected person from spreading the virus and contributing to one of these outbreaks.\"\n\n\"So, I want to be very clear, good nutrition is absolutely no substitute for vaccination to prevent someone's own risk for developing severe, maybe fatal, measles,\" he added.\n\nClaims about the safety of the measles vaccine\n\nThe CDC currently recommends that people receive two doses of the measles, mumps, rubella vaccine, the first at ages 12 to 15 months and the second between 4 and 6 years old.\n\nOne dose is 93% effective, and two doses are 97% effective, the CDC says. Most vaccinated adults don't need a booster.\n\nBoxes and vials of the Measles, Mumps, Rubella Virus Vaccine at a vaccine clinic put on by Lubbock Public Health Department, on March 1, 2025, in Lubbock, Texas. Jan Sonnenmair/Getty Images\n\nKennedy has said vaccines do \"stop the spread of the disease\" but also said they cause \"adverse events.\"\n\n\"It does cause deaths every year. It causes all the illnesses that measles itself [causes], encephalitis and blindness, et cetera,\" he told Hannity, without providing evidence.\n\nWeaver said there is no vaccine that is without risks but that the MMR vaccine is incredibly safe and effective.\n\n\"There's no evidence that it has severe outcomes … similar to what the measles virus infection causes,\" he told ABC News. \"It certainly can cause very minor reactions at the site of injection, like just about every vaccine, but it's one of the safest vaccines that's ever been developed.\"\n\nWeaver added that the risks of complications from a measles infection far outweigh any risks from the MMR vaccine.\n\nAs for Kennedy's unfounded claim that the MMR vaccine causes death, a 2015 CDC review published in the journal Vaccine found such claims are deaths reported to the U.S. Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System – a voluntary reporting system \"that accepts any submitted report of an adverse event without judging its clinical significance or whether it was caused by a vaccination.\"\n\nThe review found that many of the deaths reported to VAERS claiming to be linked to the MMR included children who has serious underlying medical conditions or had deaths that were unrelated to the vaccine, including accidental deaths.\n\n\"These complete VAERS reports and any accompanying medical records, autopsy reports and death certificates have been reviewed in depth by FDA and CDC physicians and no concerning patterns have emerged that would suggest a causal relationship with the MMR vaccine and death,\" the review stated.\n\nQuestioning 'benefits' of measles and fatality rate\n\nKennedy claimed in an interview with Fox News senior medical analyst Dr. Marc Seigel over the weekend that is \"almost impossible\" for measles to kill a healthy individual.\n\nSome people who contract measles may suffer severe complications as a result of infection. While those most at risk include children younger than age 5, pregnant people and those with weakened immune systems, anybody can experience complications.\n\nAbout in 1 in 5 unvaccinated people who contract measles are hospitalized and about 1 in 20 children with measles develop pneumonia, which is the most common cause of death in young children who get infected.\n\nAbout one in 10 children infected with measles develop ear infections as well, which can lead to hearing loss, data shows.\n\nAdditionally, about 1 out of every 1,000 children with measles will develop encephalitis -- which is the swelling of the brain and can lead to brain damage -- and up to 3 out of every 1,000 children with measles will die from respiratory and neurologic complications, the CDC says.\n\nA sign is seen outside a clinic with the South Plains Public Health District, on Feb. 23, 2025, in Brownfield, Texas. Julio Cortez/AP, FILE\n\nRecently, Texas health officials reported the death of an unvaccinated school-aged child, the first death from measles recorded in the U.S. in a decade. The child was healthy and had no preexisting conditions, officials said.\n\n\"The CDC estimates that 1 in 5 people [who] get infected with measles ends up in the hospital,\" Hokeness said. \"So, this approach to relying on sort of this natural immunity doesn't make sense when we have a vaccine which prevents it in the first place.\"\n\n\"But, in short, there's really no benefit to this idea of natural immunity and naturally acquiring the virus. That's why we've developed the vaccines that work so well,\" she added.\n\nKennedy also claimed in his interview that natural immunity from measles may protect against cancer and heart disease. There is no evidence to suggest either of those are true, experts said.\n\n\"If you want to take your chances with getting natural infection, hoping that there might be some very small benefit to that, it's a very big risk to take, because you may very well get severe measles infection,\" Weaver said.\n\nOverall, experts advised relying on scientifically proven medical information.\n\n\"We should leverage the knowledge that we've gained over the years and not spend our time focusing on alternative possibilities,\" Hokeness added.",

President Donald Trump has an affinity for Diet Coke—yes, you read that right—and it’s an affinity that’s so strong he built a damn button on the Oval Office desk to notify White House staffers to fill his cup up.\n\nNow, this is technically not a new thing. When he first took office in 2017 through 2021, he installed a red button—I’m imagining it looks like the ‘That Was Easy’ Staples’ button—on the desk. With him returning to the office this week, he didn’t waste any time in bringing the button back. The Wall Street Journal confirmed that the contraption was quickly set up in the office Monday, meaning it was a part of his extensive Day 1 activities in the office.\n\nVideos by VICE\n\nAgain, I have to say you have to appreciate someone so committed to what they love. Now I’m just wondering to myself what I would install a button for. One for Michelob Ultra refills? Or a button that brings me soft pretzels whenever my heart desires? The opportunities are endless.\n\nDonald Trump’s Diet Coke Button is Back in Washington\n\nThe Coca-Cola company is well aware of Trump’s fandom of its beverages. They even gave him a commemorative bottle recently with an old-school soda bottle and a White House label on it that listed his Jan. 20 Inauguration Day. It was presented to him by the company’s CEO, James Quince.\n\nDuring his first term, the New York Times revealed just how obsessed he is with Diet Coke. Trump reportedly drinks 12 cans a day. There’s no way that’s healthy, right? I drink one of them, and I instantly hate myself for consuming the sugary drink.\n\nMore power to you, Trump. By this point, his body has gotta be comprised of 75% Diet Coke flowing through him.",

        "content": "President Donald Trump utilized his first day back in office to put a handful of executive orders in motion, one of which was announcing the United States’ withdrawal from the WHO, the World Health Organization.\n\nThis wasn’t exactly a surprising move, considering Trump’s history with the organization. He attempted to remove the U.S. from the WHO in 2020 before Joe Biden overturned the decision and resumed funding for the organization. One of Trump’s major running points during his campaign was keeping American dollars in-house and not paying for what he perceived to be a waste of funds, which always meant the WHO was in jeopardy.\n\nVideos by VICE\n\nTrump cited the organization’s “mishandling” of the COVID-19 pandemic as the main reason for the decision.\n\nDonald Trump Pulls The United States Out of the WHO\n\nAbove all else, it’s the money the country has invested in the WHO that ultimately fueled the decision. America has been the WHO’s largest donor since its inception in 1948. The country has routinely given around $163 million in yearly contributions, with that number going as high as over $800 million at times. There are up to 194 countries involved in the WHO, with America providing up to a fifth of the organization’s funding, per USA Today.\n\n“Everybody rips off the United States and that’s it—it’s not going to happen anymore,” Trump said on Monday during a press conference.\n\nWithout the United States providing funding, the WHO will now likely lean on China, which has typically been the next largest provider. The order signed by Trump on Monday specifically mentions the population size of China and the fact that, despite it being far larger than The States’, the country pays less than 90% of what America does to the WHO.\n\nJapan, Germany, and the United Kingdom have rounded out the top five contributing countries over the years.\n\nThe World Health Organization has yet to comment on Monday’s order.",

The Army convinced the court to let it handle the matter internally, however, and the officer was instead prosecuted through the Uniform Code of Military Justice. (UCMJ). Further, Motherboard found while seeking records related to the case that the court documents have since been sealed.\n\nVideos by VICE\n\nThe case illustrates a disturbing trend where the Pentagon swoops in to protect its soldiers when they commit a crime. If convicted in a civilian court, Sweatland could have served up to a year in jail. Instead, a military judge issued a reprimand, an official black mark on Swetland’s military record.\n\nWhen asked if Sweatland would have to register as a sex offer, a representative for the U.S. Army Cadet Command told Motherboard it would comply with state law. “A court-martial convicted Lt. Col. Sweatland of a qualifying sex-related offense. The Army is complying with all sex-related offense processing requirements,” Maj. Dan Lessard, spokesman for U.S. Army Cadet Command, told Motherboard.\n\nAt the time of his arrest, Lt. Col. Jacob Sweatland was the head of the Army’s Reserve Offcier’s Training Corps program at California Polytechnic State University in San Luis Obispo. He was responsible for shaping a new generation of U.S. military officers. In September 2022, Sweatland left a key fob with a hidden camera in it at a PacSun in San Luis Obispo. A 16-year-old girl found the camera and turned it in, and the store called the cops.\n\nThe cops took a look at the camera and found it still contained images and video from other dressing rooms in the area. Sweatland later called the store asking if anyone had found his key fob. The clerk, who was working with police, told Sweatland that someone had found it and he could come and retrieve it. The cops were waiting at the scene.\n\nThe details of the case from San Luis Obispo court records which were publicly available at the time of Sweatland’s arrest but are now sealed as part of his plea deal. Pieces of the records still exist from local reporting over the past few years. According to the now-sealed court records, which said that Sweatland faced charges of resisting arrest and obstructing justice in addition to invasion of privacy, the Lt. Col. fled when he got to the store and saw the cops. The police eventually tracked Sweatland down and arrested him.\n\nMustang News, reporting based on court records that were available in 2023, said that Sweatland’s fob contained images from several locations including other retail establishments and the gym at the Cal Poly Rec center. The video was shot “from covert angles” and showed “women’s backsides as they [preformed] various exercises wearing shorts and tight fitting athletic wear.” At the time of his arrest, Sweatland was removed from his position at the University but wasn’t charged for the recordings because they were taken in a public area.\n\nAs the case against Sweatland moved forward last year, he and his lawyers did what they could to avoid civilian justice. Before the case was handed over to military prosecutors, Sweatland attempted to get it dismissed as a “Military Diversion.” In California, veterans and servicemembers can ask for courts to dismiss charges if the defendant is “suffering from sexual trauma, traumatic brain injury, post-traumatic stress disorder, substance abuse, or mental health problems as a result of his or her military service.”\n\nAccording to court records, Sweatland’s defense team claimed that he’d undergone intensive therapy since his arrest. Sweatland’s service was no joke, he deployed in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Colombia and earned a Bronze Star and a Ranger Tab. He saw combat and it’s possible he’s suffering from service related PTSD. But the court of SLO wasn’t buying it.\n\n“The calculated and covert method in which Defendant repeatedly targeted vulnerable young women demonstrates little potential for rehabilitation in the Military Diversion Program,” court records filed by the prosecutors said.\n\nAfter his attempt at using the Military Diversion Program was thwarted, the Army stepped in.\n\n“When disposing of allegations of misconduct, the Army regularly coordinates with federal, state, local, and tribal law enforcement and prosecution authorities. In July 2023, the San Luis Obispo District Attorney’s Office initiated contact with the Army and requested the Army prosecute this case,” Lessard said. “After careful consideration of the evidence and in consultation with the victim, the Army preferred court-martial charges against Lt. Col. Sweatland on July 13, 2023.”\n\nThe military conducted an investigation of its own and handed down the reprimand during a special court martial. “On Jan. 22, 2024, at a special court-martial convened at Fort Knox, Ky., Lt. Col. Jacob J. Sweatland was convicted by a military judge, pursuant to his pleas, of one specification of indecent visual recording and one specification of conduct unbecoming an officer in violation of Articles 120c and 133, UCMJ. The military judge sentenced the accused to be reprimanded. The sentence was consistent with the terms of a plea agreement,” Lessard told Motherboard.\n\nHe explained that a reprimand is a punitive public censure. “A reprimand reflects negatively on a soldier’s military record and negatively affects a soldier’s career,” Lessard said. Despite the black mark, Sweatland does still have a career. He is currently assigned to the 8th Brigade of U.S. Army Cadet Command and is serving in an administrative role away from cadets.”\n\nThe Sweatland case highlights a problem with civilian-military relations and the Pentagon writ large. This is a persistent problem in the Army. In 2017, a soldier at Fort Hood allegedly assaulted his wife and fired a gun as she fled their home. The Army kicked him out of the service but did not pursue a case against him. The same thing happened the same year in Alaska after a soldier was accused of sexually assaulting a fellow soldier.\n\nIn both cases, there was physical evidence of the crime and no prosecution. The soldiers were simply allowed to return to civilian life. The Pentagon often runs cover for its soldiers, which creates a separate system of justice for those who serve.\n\nMotherboard asked Cadet Command to respond to concerns that the Army’s handling of Sweatland would be viewed as a slap on the wrist. “A court-martial convicted and punished Lt. Col. Sweatland under adherence to the rules and procedures prescribed by the Uniform Code of Military Justice. We have no further comment on this matter while it is subject to appellate review,” Lessard said.\n\nUpdate 2/9: This article was updated with more information from U.S. Army Cadet Command spokesperson Maj. Dan Lessard and the subhed has been changed to reflect this information.",

        "content": "Masked men recently proved the ongoing presence of anti-semites in America. During a performance of The Diary of Anne Frank in Michigan, a group of men holed up in front of the venue, waving Nazi flags and spewing slurs.\n\nThe Fowlerville Community Theatre was hosting the play at American Legion Devereaux Post 141 when they became aware of “the presence of self-identified Nazi protesters,” according to a press release.\n\nVideos by VICE\n\nBobby Brite, past commander of the legion, recorded a video of the protestors and shared it to Facebook. He told The Detroit News that the group of 10 masked men chanted things including “Anne Frank was a whore” during their anti-semitic showing. Frank was 15 when she died at a concentration camp in 1945.\n\n“They are some of the most cowardly people I’ve ever met,” Brite told the outlet of the “absolutely disgusting” protest.\n\n“There was a group of people at the four-way intersection in downtown that had swastika flags and American flags,” Alex Sutfill, a witness, told the local CBS station. “They were sticking their arms up and yelling ‘Hail Hitler‘ and ‘Hail Trump’ and everything like that.”\n\nHow the Protest Was Handled\n\nThe theater group alerted the American Legion staff on duty of the situation and was assured they were already aware of and monitoring the men, who moved out of the legion’s parking lot when asked.\n\nAfterwards, the demonstrators went “across the street and waved flags adorned with Nazi insignia,” the Livingston County Sheriff’s Office told The Detroit News. “A subject then approached them, and an argument ensued.”\n\nPeter Damerow told the local CBS station that he was the one who confronted the group. In response, he claimed, “They looked at me and one of them said, ‘No this is Pureville now, and we’re here to make sure it stays pure.’”\n\n“Nothing physical transpired and ultimately the parties involved separated,” the sheriff’s office said.\n\nStill, “out of an abundance of caution,” the group alerted the audience members to the situation at intermission.\n\n“For this production, our cast was also on stage in character during intermission, which was when they found out as well,” the press release read. “Although some were understandably shaken, they pulled together and finished the performance with strength and professionalism.”\n\nHow the Situation Mirrors History\n\nChuck Firman, president of the Fowlerville Community Theatre, added in a statement to the The Detroit News, “It was a scary moment. But really, the show must go on.”\n\nThe theater’s press release further noted how the ordeal, which ended when the protestors left before the end of the show, “gave us a small glimpse of the fear and uncertainty felt by those in hiding.”\n\nIndeed, Brite told the local ABC station, “We had 75 people downstairs that watched that play and out of that 75, there were 50 or 60 of them that were afraid to leave this building. We had to escort them to their cars. No one in America should feel like that.”\n\n“As a theatre, we want to make people feel and think,” the press release read. “We hope that by presenting Anne’s story, we can help prevent the atrocities of the past from happening again.”\n\nThe Anti-Defamation League’s Michigan outpost said In a statement, “disgusted by the far-right extremists who praised Hitler and waved Nazi flags” at the event.\n\nIn October, the organization found that, following Hamas’ October 2023 attack on Israel, there were 10,000 antisemitic incidents in the U.S. That’s a 200 percent increase from the previous year.",

        "source": "https://news.vice.com/",
        "content": "More infants died in the U.S. after Roe V. Wade was overturned.\n\nEarlier this year, a Texas study found increased infant mortality rates in the 18 months after the state’s six-week abortion ban went into effect in 2021.\n\nVideos by VICE\n\nThe latest study, which was penned by Parvati Singh and Dr. Maria Gallo and published in JAMA Pediatrics, built on that research. It took a look at infant mortality nationwide after Roe V. Wade was overturned in 2022.\n\nThe study found that infant mortality was up to seven percent higher than normal in certain months, which is equivalent to an average of 247 more deaths.\n\nThe jump was most pronounced—a 10 percent rise—among infants with congenital anomalies. That is likely due to more frail fetuses being carried to term amid abortion restrictions, the study suggested.\n\n“I’m not sure that people expected infant mortality rates to increase following Dobbs. It’s not necessarily what people were thinking about,” Gallo told Ohio State News. “But when you restrict access to health care it can cause a broader impact on public health than can be foreseen.”\n\nSingh agreed, telling CNN that the research “is evidence of a national ripple effect, regardless of state-level status.”\n\n“This is the tip of the iceberg,” she said. “Mortality is the ultimate outcome of any health condition. This is a very, very acute indicator. It could be representative of underlying morbidity and underlying hardship.”\n\nSingh told the first outlet that she now wants to explore maternal and infant mortality rates among various populations.\n\n“There’s a broader human toll to consider,” she said, “including mental health consequences of being denied abortion care or being forced to carry a fetus with a fatal genetic abnormality to term.”",

        "source": "https://news.vice.com/",
        "content": "A California prison is being placed under a microscope following a possible death by mail. The incident in question involves fentanyl-laced pages that may have killed a mailroom supervisor.\n\nAt the high-security US Penitentiary in Atwater, an inmate named Jamar Jones was allegedly sent mail from his ex-girlfriend Stephanie Ferreira and a man called Jersey Rudd III. Prosecutors say that multiple pages of the letter were “soaked” in drugs—including amphetamines, fentanyl, and “spice,” or synthetic cannabinoids, according to drug testing. They say the paper looked like it was dipped in wax.\n\nVideos by VICE\n\nThe senders attempted to conceal the alleged drug shipment by sending it via “legal mail,” meant to be confidentially between an attorney and inmate. All three have been charged for conspiracy to distribute.\n\nAccording to an FBI affidavit, the mailroom supervisor, Marc Fischer, came in contact with the envelope and handled its pages. Within five minutes, he began stumbling around and told coworkers he was “having trouble breathing.” Fellow corrections officers called for medical support, and after two hours and a trip to the hospital, Fischer died.\n\nThe cause of death is still unknown and won’t be identified until toxicology reports are finalized. Secondhand fentanyl exposure shouldn’t be fatal, experts say.\n\nThis is hardly the first case of drug-soaked mail in prisons. In 2019, 122 federal prisons began photocopying inmate letters instead of giving them the originals in an attempt to stop the distribution of any drug concealed in mail or postage. A bill to mandate digital mail-scanning in prisons passed the Senate last year, but it stalled in the House.",

        "source": "https://news.vice.com/",
        "content": "Chappell Roan just dropped her first new single in months, “The Giver,” a country-tinged tune that in part pays homage to her Missouri roots. In a new interview, she opened up about the song and how it ties to her formative years as a young country girl being treated “the best and worst” by “country boys.”\n\nDuring an Apple Music Country interview, podcast host Kelleigh Bannen asked Roan why she chose to go more country with her new music, and the singer cited songs such as Alan Jackson’s “Chattahoochee” and Big & Rich’s “Save a Horse (Ride a Cowboy)” as “campy” and “fun” inspirations for the energy she was seeking.\n\nVideos by VICE\n\n“I think I have a special relationship to where I’m from because of country music,” Roan explained. “So, to kind of honor that part of myself (…) it’s like, ‘You know what? Yes, I am gay and yes, I am ultra pop. Yes, I am a drag queen. You can also perform a country song.’”\n\nReflecting on growing up a “Midwest Princess,” Roan offered some reflections that help better understand who she is as a woman and artist. “I’m about to say something so controversial,” she cautioned, “but do you know who has treated me the best and the worst? Country boys.”\n\nPlay video\n\nChappell Roan Says These Classmates Treated Her Both ‘The Best and Worst’\n\n“They treated me the nicest and they’ve also treated me the worst because—this is in high school—and that’s what I grew up around,” she continued. “Those are the boys I grew up around and that’s how I learned to stand up for myself, because you’re not going to look at me and be like, ‘Shh, shh, shh.’”\n\nBeing around tough country boys, Roan says, taught her “that I am never going to have this done to me ever again,” and was “never going to have someone put their hand up and say, ‘Stop talking.’”\n\n“I learned from a lot of the boys that I grew up around who were influenced by their fathers,” she added, “and how these roles as, like, ‘I’m a man, so you speak after me.’ I began my confidence in feeling kind of inferior to a lot of the boys around me growing up.”\n\nIt was at this point, she very specifically tied what she was saying into an infamous incident from the 2024 MTV Video Music Awards. “And so whenever I pointed out at that photographer on the red carpet at the VMAs, I heard boys at my freaking high school telling girls to shut the… up,” she said, referring to the red carpet incident wherein a photographer was being rude to her so she responded by saying:\n\n“Don’t! Not me, bitch!” The pair also told one another to “shut the fuck up.”\n\nPlay video\n\nRoan made it clear that she knows this type of misogyny is “not exclusive to any culture,” adding, “It’s universal. But I didn’t hear just slurs around gay people. I’ve heard a lot of women-hating comments growing up and a lot of women-uplifting comments, but it’s different where we grew up.”\n\n“And I don’t care that I was raised to be ladylike. I don’t care. I don’t care about being trashy. I don’t care about looking sexy. These are all things I had to unlearn,” she continued. “I had to unlearn, like, ‘Actually you are not going to make me feel inferior just because I’m a young girl.’ I had to pull myself up, and that is straight up why I’m here.”\n\nRoan then went on to ponder how “The Giver” will be received by music audiences and if they’ll “revolt” against it and her for “making a very clearly lesbian song, where I poke fun at country boys.” Clarifying her point, she added, “I’ve dated a few. I dated a few. I love a country boy. I love them. I love a man who can shovel horse manure. I love that. I love a man who will sit in grass.”\n\n“I’ve dated a farm boy,” Roan continued. “I’ve dated someone who worked on a dairy farm. But I’ve also dated someone who will literally not sit on grass, and not touch a bug. I appreciate the country way. But also, you will find me making fun of them all… Why do we keep having songs about women not being satisfied?”",

Located about 75 miles west of Anchorage, Mount Spurr has been emitting elevated levels of volcanic gases alongside increased seismic activity and ground deformations and has seen increased activity of fumaroles, aka gas vents.\n\nAccording to volcanologists at the Alaska Volcano Observatory, all those signs point to an increased risk of eruption. In addition, over the past month, the site has experienced over 100 earthquakes a week. Scientists at the Observatory are monitoring Spurr’s activity, noting that new magma appears to have entered the Earth’s crust beneath the volcano.\n\nVideos by VICE\n\nWill Mount Spurr Erupt in 2025?\n\nMount Spurr’s eruption would mark one of the few times researchers can say that the volcano has erupted at all. It’s been 5,000 years since the last time Mount Spurr erupted from its summit. In the past century, it has twice erupted from the Crater Peak vent, situated about 2 miles south of the summit.\n\nThe first of those was in 1953, the other in 1992—both were explosive and dangerous but thankfully only lasted a few hours. The 1992 eruption carried ash clouds downwind for hundreds of miles, forcing the closure of the Anchorage airport for 20 hours.\n\nMount Spurr is an active volcano, as in its alive and kicking, but it’s definitely been a lazy one, which residents of nearby Anchorage are probably happy about. The Alaska Volcano Observatory has raised the volcano’s alert level to yellow, signifying increased unrest.\n\nThe Observatory will continue to provide updates should conditions shift toward an imminent eruption.",

        "content": "Imagine someone creating or purchasing a life-size cardboard cutout of you without your knowledge…\n\nThat’s one New York influencer’s reality.\n\nVideos by VICE\n\nKelsey Kotzur, 31, of Brooklyn, explained to her TikTok followers that someone has been selling cardboard cutouts of her on sites like Etsy, Amazon, and Walmart.\n\nWoman Found Freaky Cardboard Cutouts of Her for Sale Online\n\n“Who is doing this to me?” she asked in the caption of the clip.\n\nAccording to Kotzur, the stranger was using images from her social media to create these cutouts. Here’s a relatively new, eerily-human-like example on Celebrity Cutouts. Some are being sold for nearly $80.\n\n“Get ready to experience the glitz and glamour of Hollywood right at home,” the website states. “With our extensive collection, you’ll find more stars than the Hollywood Walk of Fame!”\n\nI guess that means influencers, too.\n\n“When I decided to make videos on the internet, this is the last thing I thought would happen,” Kotzur said in her video.\n\nTo make light of the situation, some of her family members purchased the cutouts to “troll” her. However, when absorbing the actual gravity of the situation, she acknowledged the entire ordeal is, well, pretty creepy.\n\n“I don’t know if I should be flattered or freaked tf out,” she wrote in the comments of her video. She also joked about wanting royalties for the sales.\n\nHer followers expressed their concern with the situation.\n\n“This is hilarious but also so weird and scary,” one person wrote.\n\n“The duality of the internet,” another added.\n\nA third person asked: “I mean this in the nicest way, but why would people buy this? (Who are not your family).” To which, Kotzur replied, “This is the absolutely correct take because idk lmao.”\n\nA fourth TikTok user proposed a decent business idea: “At this point, maybe you should make your own to sell and compete? That way you can choose the outfit and pose.”",

        "content": "A group of Canadian firefighters are feeling the heat after their ill-fated Halloween bash. During the North Sydney Firefighters Club’s Halloween dance, a group of four people dressed up as members of the Ku Klux Klan joined in on the festivities.\n\nIn video obtained by CBC News, four people are seen entering the Nova Scotia party wearing white robes and pointed hoods. One person in the racist outfit was carrying a makeshift cross.\n\nVideos by VICE\n\nIn a statement to Global News, Fire Chief Lloyd MacIntosh said the people in Ku Klux Klan costumes were admitted by volunteers working the door.\n\n“A mistake was made,” he admitted. “They were allowed in, they shouldn’t have been.”\n\nVolunteers asked the people to remove their hoods, but some refused, MacIntosh said. He added that a volunteer took away the cross one person was carrying.\n\nFirefighters Speak Out About the Racist Costume\n\nIn a statement posted to Facebook, the club admitted that it “made a mistake!”\n\n“We apologize to any and all of our community who were offended or hurt by our lack of actions,” the post read. “These four individuals are in no way, shape or form associated with our organization. We promise to be better in the future.”\n\nWade Gouthro, the Deputy Fire Chief, also spoke out about the controversy in a Facebook post.\n\n“I can honestly tell you that the situation at the North Sydney Firefighters club is not who we are or what we stand for,” Gouthro wrote, before admitting that he’d been “very reluctant” to address the situation due to fear of adding “fuel to the fire.”\n\n“I can tell you this, the members of North Sydney and myself are very sorry from the bottom of our hearts and we ask for your forgiveness,” he continued. “We would certainly never intentionally hurt or insult anyone regardless of race, color, orientation or religion. We spend all of our time trying to do right by the community and are here to do all we can for anyone.”\n\nGouthro added that being “referred to as racists hurts bad.”\n\nWhy KKK-Dressed Attendees Were Admitted to the Party\n\nWhile Gouthro was not working the party in question, he noted that he’s worked the annual event many times in the past.\n\n“When we have Halloween dances you never know what you are going to see come through the door,” he wrote. “Most times we think, ‘Ah it is a costume’ without really thinking of the big picture or the past it represents.”\n\n“So when you folks comment that they shouldn’t have gotten in and that we need to do better, you are right, and we will,” Gouthro continued. “… I will assure you that we are all hurting in our hearts today that we have disappointed a community that we work so hard to make better and protect.”\n\nHe concluded his post by “once again apologizing on behalf of myself and our membership and also a sincere promise to do better in the future.”",

        "content": "Another day, another creative— though failed—attempt at smuggling drugs. Colombian officials at Rafael Nunez International Airport were in for a surprise when they discovered someone attempting to get one by them through a disguise. A man was departing on an Amsterdam flight when he was footsteps away from stepping onto his plane when authorities pulled him aside because they were suspicious of… his hair.\n\nExcept it wasn’t his hair, it was a wig. While he made it through the security checkpoints and presumably thought he was in the clear, the 40-year-old dealer was monitored leading up to the boarding process. Eventually, the suspicion grew to a point where they had to step in and investigate what they suspected was a unique smuggling vessel.\n\nVideos by VICE\n\nA Drug Dealer Tried to Conceal Cocaine in His Wig—And Failed\n\nPhotos from the scene showed the man’s wig being cut into and beneath it was nine cocaine capsules, according to TMZ. The black wig was able to conceal them initially before the security scanner uncovered the secret.\n\nWhen the wig was fully cut off, it showed the pods engrained in the inner part of the wig. I can’t imagine it was comfortable at all, but it nearly worked. Props to security for suspecting that something was off about the hairdo. The BBC reports that the street value of the drugs, which weighed in at 220 grams, would have equated to $10,450 U.S. dollars.\n\nColumbia is known to be the most prevalent cocaine exporter in the country, so it’s no wonder that airport security has its guard up for anything that seems out of place. Clearly, the wig set off enough alarms with officials that they tracked him throughout the airport before concluding that they needed to intervene before he headed to Amsterdam.\n\nIt’s been a busy month for wild drug dealing stories. The wig-concealing-cocaine tactic is the most interesting, but perhaps the most intricate was what came out of the Morocco and Spain border. That’s where a drug smuggling tunnel was discovered, connecting the two countries between the only land border.",

To NHL.com, she added: “The year ahead is going to be a lot of fun. To carry that torch every day and keep my focus on being a coach, it definitely puts meaning into the work.”\n\nWhat is Jessica Campbell’s Background?\n\nAssistant coach Jessica Campbell of the Seattle Kraken (Photo by Steph Chambers/Getty Images)\n\nCampbell was a renowned hockey player before joining the Kraken as an assistant coach. She starred at Cornell University, where she was a team captain and hit the 100-point mark for the University.\n\nShe turned pro and spent time with the Calgary Inferno before playing internationally in Sweden.\n\nAfter her playing days, she was a trailblazer in the American Hockey League as the first female coach with the Kraken’s minor league team, the Coachella Valley Firebuds. She was there from 2022 to 2024 before moving to the NHL.\n\nHow Many Women Coach in other leagues?\n\nWhile Campbell broke down the walls at the NHL level, the other three major leagues (NFL, MLB, NBA) have already done so.\n\nAt the start of the 2024 season, 15 women held full-time coaching positions in the NFL.\n\nIn 2023, MLB had 43 women coaching.\n\nBecky Hammon was the first woman to serve as an acting head coach, with the San Antonio Spurs in 2020. There are currently six active female assistant coaches in the NBA.",

        "content": "The cause of last year’s deadly wildfires in Maui, Hawaii, has been revealed. The August 2023 blaze that left more than 100 people dead was caused by the re-energization of broken utility lines in Lahaina, according to an investigation released Wednesday by the Maui Fire Department and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives.\n\nThe fire has been classified as accidental. Per the report, the re-energization of the line caused sparks, which ignited overgrown vegetation at a surrounding utility pole. The overhead and energized power line fell to the ground, further igniting vegetation.\n\nVideos by VICE\n\nInvestigators initially believed they had extinguished the fire, which started around 6:30 AM, but undetected smoldering material reignited the second phase of the fire hours later, just before 3 PM.\n\n“We want to make abundantly clear to Lahaina and to our Maui community that our firefighters went above and beyond their due diligence to be as confident as they could be that the fire was completely extinguished before they left the scene,” Assistant Chief Jeffrey Giesea said, per NBC News.\n\nAccording to the report, “Fed by extreme winds, the fire quickly grew out of control, jumped the bypass, and resulted in the subsequent conflagration from which our island community is still recovering.”\n\nThe fire destroyed over 2,000 structures and caused $6 billion in damages.\n\nThe report’s findings may or may not sway conspiracy theorists who believe the U.S. government used directed energy weapons to cause the deadly blazes to turn Maui into a “smart island.”",

        "content": "If you’re old enough to remember the DARE program, you probably remember the litany of unhinged rhetoric they used to try and convince you that smoking cannabis was not a good time and does not make you a cool dude. Among those was the claim that over time, cannabis makes you dumber and permanently damages your long term memory. Well, we can (maybe) put that one to bed along with the whole “gateway drug” thing. Because according to a study out of Denmark, cannabis users might actually experience less cognitive decline than non-cannabis users as they age.\n\nConscripted In Copenhagen\n\nA little background first: Ever since 1849, Denmark has required physically fit men over 18 years of age to be conscripted for 4-12 months of military service. On the way into this service, conscripts are given a cognitive test. That’s where the authors of this new study saw an opportunity. The test was re-administered to 5,162 men who were now around 64 years old, and then polled those men to see if they’d ever tried or habitually consumed cannabis.\n\nVideos by VICE\n\nThe men who were habitual consumers of the devil’s lettuce actually scored higher on the cognitive test than those who didn’t, showing less overall cognitive decline over the around 44 year period between the first time they took the cognitive test and the re-test for this study. There are a lot of other factors that could play a role in these results, like lifestyle, income, and consumption of other intoxicants over time. But even accounting for those, the researchers still saw a slight uptick in cognitive function among the old stoner crowd.\n\nNot so fast, Grandpa\n\nThere’s a caveat, though. The margin is slim: cannabis consumers scored on average 1.3 points higher than non-cannabis users. Even the authors of the study say that much more research is needed before any medical conclusions can be drawn. Still, it’s an interesting result that flies in the face of conventional wisdom about cannabis. So don’t go getting your grandpa a bag of weed and a bong for Christmas just yet. Or do, just don’t expect that it’ll make him any better at, well, anything besides eating and saying inappropriate things at the dinner table.",

        "title": "The Dark Dreams of Curtis Yarvin, Trump 2.0’s Big Tech Preachertroll",
        "source": "https://news.vice.com/",
        "content": "This is a members-only article from the forthcoming comeback issue of VICE Magazine. To subscribe, visit our membership section—not only will you get four issues of the printed magazine each year, delivered to your door, you’ll also have exclusive early access to our best new documentaries and online content, as well as a raft of members’ perks.\n\nAt the outset of the year, Curtis Yarvin—the blogger whose vision of a new, autocratic U.S. is reportedly gaining traction within the Trump administration—leapt back into the mainstream spotlight, with a New York Times interview headlined: “Curtis Yarvin Says Democracy Is Done. Powerful Conservatives Are Listening.” The article was accompanied by a moody monochromatic portrait that exaggerates Yarvin’s jowls like a veristic bust. One animated version of the photo shows Yarvin ominously drumming his fingers on a table. The implication seems clear: Do those restless fingertips contain the fate of the nation?\n\nIncreasingly, Yarvin has been touted by the media as a key to understanding the American New Right—a Steve Bannonesque figurehead, but for its tech faction rather than its nativist-populist one. He’s a computer engineer who’s been blogging away for decades in the strange world of online ‘neoreaction’ under the dusty fairytale pseudonym “Mencius Moldbug,” and is best known for his idea that American democracy should be replaced by a monarchy that runs the country like a start-up and grants generous privileges to the tech-industrialist elites.\n\nThis has won Yarvin friends in high places. His relationship with billionaire venture capitalist mega-donor Peter Thiel is well publicized. Marc Andreessen and J.D. Vance have cited his work approvingly. Now, with Trump settling back into the White House and indebted to the Bay Area robber barons that helped put him there, it feels as though Yarvin’s public profile has decisively shifted—from geeky fringe blogger to a political-philosopher éminence grise who is laying the discursive groundwork for an “American Caesar.”\n\nClearly, this is how Yarvin wants to be perceived. But take him at face value, and you’re playing a losing game. You’re not going to find a Schmitt or a Machiavelli here, and the joke’s on you for expecting that. Instead, Yarvin is best understood as a kind of spokesperson for ten million brain-fried Twitter anons, a cohort he’s described as the “new public intellectuals” of our “digital age,” and whose scattershot, stream-of-consciousness tub-thumping is currently being reflected in some punchy U.S. government policy. Whether that’s down to Yarvin is hard to discern. It seems unlikely. Yet what’s undeniable is that he finds himself arriving into a cultural moment for which he feels precision-engineered. In Yarvin, Big Tech has found the perfect preachertroll to exalt the deliberate insanity of the ‘move fast and break things’ ethos it’s bringing to nation building, one who knows how to exploit “meme magic” to dream up new truths about the world. In times past, people would’ve called this ‘throwing lots of shit at a wall and seeing what sticks.’ Today, they call it disruption, hyperstition, accelerationism, the future.\n\nThis is why the whole thing makes more sense if you understand Yarvin as a Gen X tech geek playing the part of a poet-guru; someone who can help Silicon Valley sheath its scary, transhumanist vision of the future in ancient mysticism and boomer cool. Look: he’s trying to be Gabriele D’Annunzio in a leather jacket. He’s trying to harness the infinite sexuality of the poète maudit. He wants us to understand that he’s a prophet who has visions; that with his musings on the nature of elves, he’s somehow hallucinating the polity of the future. His swagger is a bit awkward. He’s a socialite who attracts a following of eccentrics. Some people have told me that it’s Yarvin who was responsible for redpilling a lot of the Silicon Valley fat cats, persuading them to indulge their god complexes, insisting that it’s actually chic to openly flirt with immiserating elites and outmoded racial theories, as a way of priming them to support Trump and whoever comes next.\n\nPlay video\n\nIn his interview with the NY Times, Yarvin displays some of the shifty mannerisms you might expect of a contrarian online troll, an identity that to his credit he has partly owned. His habit of peppering italics through his writing is a way of signposting profundity where more often than not, there isn’t any. If you were to lay out his political program in his own style, it could be abridged such: America needs to stop edging and gooning and elect a bareback President, one who is given free rein to be orders of magnitude more powerful. Sounds delectably depraved, doesn’t it? And yet what he really means by that is none other than FDR— ‘And you libs like FDR, don’t you?’ he snickers. The fans are in on the joke but the outsiders tend to give up in frustration—there’s no ‘there’ there, they complain; it’s incoherent and contradictory, it’s childish, it’s a testament to the intellectual vacuity of fascism, there’s no way this sophist charlatan can have any real influence, and so on. Open the schools!\n\nOver the past few years I’ve had a bunch of funny encounters with Yarvin in New York, which he visits somewhat regularly, as if to make routine pilgrimage to the ancestral home of the Beat Generation. The first was a sunny summer day in 2022, at a meetup he had scheduled for his Substack subscribers in a park by the Hudson River. (He sometimes sends out newsletters advertising meetups in various cities; he once even put out a dating call to meet “someone of childbearing age.”) Dozens of Oxford shirt-wearing College Republicans surrounded the master, whose shoulder-length hair rested on his loose, half-buttoned saffron shirt that reminded me of the robes of Theravada monks. He stood in the grass and ruminated on Garibaldi. The disciples asked him questions like, “Who is the most overrated monarch in history?” The crowd was almost entirely male, and I remember some of the guys being disappointed, though not surprised, that no quirked-up cocquettecore girlies with bad politics were in attendance.\n\nLater, in the fall, I saw Yarvin debate the playwright Matthew Gasda on the Shakespeare authorship controversy at a smoky salon in Greenwich Village. If you’re not familiar with this ongoing argument, there’s an “Oxfordian” thesis that the 17th century aristocrat Edward de Vere was the true author of Shakespeare’s works, and that Shakespeare had actually just been De Vere’s rentboy. This was the position Yarvin was arguing; to him, there is simply no way that a lowly, common-born fellow like Shakespeare could ever have portrayed the machinations of aristocratic life so accurately. Gasda—a sort of earnest Belle and Sebastian conservative himself—was arguing the widely accepted “Stratfordian” position, and had studied all night so he was ready to defend the Bard’s honor. Yarvin’s approach was more flippant. “Suppose a corpus of witty, erudite academic novels, set in an unnamed Ivy League English department,” he posited, “is published under the name of an illiterate immigrant from Ghana, who sells sunglasses on a blanket on the street in Morningside Heights?”\n\nIt was a line that sounded familiar, because Yarvin had already published it in a blog on his Substack. Clearly, the Ghanaian immigrant analogy is his go-to line on this subject. In his closing arguments, he went on to suggest that De Vere couldn’t put his own name to his works of genius because he was part of an Elizabethan bohemia of poet-spies who ran psyops for the Queen. Whether the Oxfordian thesis is actually true isn’t so important to Yarvin. What is? Hyperstitioning alternate histories to sow disbelief in the institutions of liberal modernity, ideally in the flippant manner of a social media shitposter. And who better to lap up these myths than the chain-smoking Dimes Square beatniks in the audience?\n\n“The mainstream framing of Yarvin as the brains behind an imminent post-democratic America is one destined to fail, as it takes his bait on some level”\n\nIn the following years, I’d run into Yarvin every now and then at salons in other downtown basements. Sometime around Christmas 2023 I went to a reading where the venue hosts, fearing antifa-Dadaist direct action, had hired a bouncer to ensure the poet’s safety. In his signature winter look of all-black jeans and leather jacket, he read works from favorites like W.H. Auden, Robert Lowell, and Robinson Jeffers, as well as some original writing. I found one poem of his—“War”—particularly striking, for how it tried to channel the Futurist ecstasy of combat though the experience of looking at your phone:\n\n“I spend too much time\n\nOn Twitter, following\n\nThe war—probably\n\nOn the wrong side—\n\nNothing is in me to care”\n\nFrom there, the speaker in Yarvin’s poem—presumably Yarvin himself—is mesmerized in a kaleidoscope of disinterested transhistorical enjoyment. The angel of history goonscrolls reality, which in 2025 is a titillating and contextless succession of thirst traps and snuff videos from the front. We learn that war is full of paradoxes—war is pointless but it’s also the only eternal thing in human existence, (“all else fades from the clays”); it’s cool as hell; it’s the worst thing ever; it’s all a big lie, but lies are cool (“The highest art is propaganda” begins another of Yarvin’s poems)—no, it’s peace that is fake; peace disappoints; peace is unsexy; it’s the opposite of love. Of course, this ode to war was probably written in comfortable conditions in Northern California, but the author knows what he’s playing at. The intense traumatic-erotic experience of industrial slaughter is the libidinal origin of fascism, and seems to be a model for Yarvin’s New Right ideology of the future. Yet crucially, the intensity is lacking; these horrors are something the poet and his audience can mostly only experience vicariously, through the internet.\n\nCURTIS YARVIN IN DEFIANT MOOD IN HIS BELOVED NYC. PHOTO BY NICK DOVE.\n\nWhat my experiences in New York tell me is that the mainstream framing of Yarvin as the brains behind an imminent post-democratic America—even when intended as ridicule—is one destined to fail, as it takes his bait on some level, validating the idea of his real proximity to power. Even as Trump seems to be attempting some version of the RAGE (Retire All Government Employees) plan that Yarvin has laid out in his blogs, the actual writing is less a guidebook of practical decisions for the American Caesar than a word soup of dazzling lies intended to chip away at the received wisdom of liberal modernity itself.\n\nCase in point: When Yarvin suggests that the wellbeing of Black Americans actually declined after slavery, he’s not interested in a good-faith historical argument. What he seeks to do is undermine the idea that All Men Are Created Equal. He certainly doesn’t need to convince Trump of that one, and it’s not like what Yarvin has to say will be of any direct help in the administration’s coming attempts to destroy the Civil Rights Act. It’s the nativist faction, the intra-administration rivals of Yarvin’s benefactors, who have that covered.\n\nYarvin has a much different function. His dream is to win over the lookers-on: the College Republicans, the Silicon Valley elites, and in New York’s bars and smoke-filled salons the clouted “cool kids” who will one day be in positions of media power great enough to help rewrite history—and maybe let Yarvin fulfill his destiny as the great prophet of a new age of illiteracy, tyranny, and digital psychedelia.\n\nFollow Michael Crumplar @mcrumps",

        "content": "Does the time of the month that a baby is conceived affect if it’s a boy or a girl?\n\nIt’s possible, says British mathematician Hannah Fry.\n\nVideos by VICE\n\n“The chances of a woman conceiving a male or female child actually very subtly changes depending on when in her cycle she conceives,” Fry explained in a video on her Instagram page. “So slightly earlier, ever so slightly more likely that she’ll have a baby boy.”\n\nHowever, Fry said the odds are “way too small” for couples to use that as a predictor.\n\nThe larger point of her investigation was analyzing gender trends over time. With data focusing on England and Wales, she explored something called the “returning soldier effect,” which shows spikes in male birth rates following World War I and II.\n\nThe trend, which has also been observed in other countries, has several possible explanations.\n\nOne controversial theory is that healthier soldiers are more likely to survive war and come home. That, combined with the Trivers-Willard hypothesis —which posits that healthier people are more likely to conceive boys—could explain the spike.\n\nAnother hypothesis is that the increase in male births is nature’s way of compensating for the loss of life during the war.\n\nThe ‘returning soldier effect’ is just one possible explanation for birth rate trends\n\nFry admits that there’s no way to tell for certain what causes more male births than female, or vice versa. There are also dozens, if not hundreds, of other factors that come into play, including the health of the mothers and environmental conditions.\n\nFor example, writing in 2008, William H. James observed a decline in male birth rates in Iran during and following the Iran-Iraq war. He attributed the fall to “psychological stress causing pregnant women disproportionately to abort male fetuses.”\n\nHowever, the “returning soldier effect” definitely has a basis in fact.\n\n“At the end of a war, everyone has much more sex than normal,” Fry noted. “Women get pregnant slightly earlier in their cycles, and as a result, there is a spike in the number of baby boys that are born.”",

        "source": "https://news.vice.com/",
        "content": "The family and friends of Johan Floderus, a Swedish diplomat potentially facing the death penalty in Iran, have told VICE News he has endured a “horrible situation” during his 20-month-long detention in a notorious Tehran prison.\n\nFlorerus, a 33-year-old working with Afghan refugees in Iran on behalf of the EU was detained in April 2022 at Tehran’s airport as he was visiting on a holiday trip and then accused of spying for Iran’s foes, in particular, Israel. He was charged and tried for “corruption on earth,” or stymieing the cause of the Iranian revolution, in the Islamic Republic’s religious courts, a charge that can be punished with death. He is the latest victim of a repeating pattern in which foreign nationals are entangled in a legal ordeal in Iran in order for the country’s ruling mullahs to extort money or other goals from the West.\n\nVideos by VICE\n\nAfraid that quiet diplomacy wasn’t working, Floderus’s loved ones broke their silence in December last year and, on Thursday, went to Brussels to hold an event to raise awareness of his case with European officials.\n\nFloderus’s sister Ingrid told VICE News: “We are very close with Johan and always spoke on almost a daily basis. He is such a freedom-loving and stubborn person. Since his arrest, we have been only able to talk a few times. I can’t imagine how horrible the situation he is in, but he is still full of life and trying to stay strong.”\n\n“Johan is someone full of life and always had a curious soul, and he always traveled around the world and spoke Farsi, and he visited Iran multiple times, and worked there.”\n\nJohan Floderus in a sup\n\nIn Iran, all foreign nationals are closely monitored, and their movements must be approved by local authorities. Despite repeated calls from both the EU and Sweden to release Floderus, the Iranian judiciary has insisted that they have enough evidence to prosecute him on espionage charges.\n\nThe Swede is held in Tehran’s Evin prison and his case is being handled by Branch 26 of the Revolutionary Court of Tehran, headed by the clerical judge, Iman Afshari, already notorious for his passing unjust prison sentences on political activists, artists, and women.\n\nLast Sunday, the court concluded Floderus’s hearing after five sessions in an almost-empty courtroom, which the Swedish man attended in a prison uniform with his state-appointed lawyer and translator. Mizan News, the Iranian judiciary’s official outlet, reported that the prosecutors accused Floderus of a “very extensive intelligence cooperation with the Zionist occupation regime,” and said that his travel history was clear evidence of his involvement in activities that “threaten Iran’s national security”.\n\nAfshari gave a week for Floderus’ lawyer to submit their defense, and did not give a verdict date.\n\nWant the best of VICE News straight to your inbox? Sign up here.\n\nDespite denials from the Iranian government, rights groups and Western governments have repeatedly accused the Islamic Republic of “hostage diplomacy” by using trumped-up charges such as “corruption on earth” to extract political concessions, release funds held abroad by international sanctions, or in prisoner exchanges.\n\nFloderus’s arrest is likely to put pressure on Sweden in the case of the arrest of Iranian former prison official Hamid Nouri.\n\nNouri was detained upon arrival at Stockholm Airport in November 2019, and later charged with involvement in the killing of thousands of Iranian political prisoners in 1988.\n\nJohan and his sister Ingrid.\n\nThe former prison official was sentenced to life “for grave breaches of international humanitarian law and murder,” by a Swedish court after the prosecution asked for the maximum penalty in July 2022. The outcome was hailed as a rare human rights success against Iranian regime officials, but outraged the government in Tehran, which called the case “politically motivated.”\n\nLast Sunday, the Iranian prosecutor asked for the maximum penalty in Floderus’s case – either life in prison or the death sentence given the “important nature and adverse affects of the accused’s actions.”\n\nThe diplomat’s family had kept quiet about the arrest on the advice of the Swedish authorities as they tried to resolve the issue through “silent diplomacy,” and launched a public campaign after the news broke out at the end of last year, and losing hope that Floderus would be released through back-channel talks.\n\n“Other governments go the distance to protect their citizens, and I hope that Sweden will do that too. Johan is my brother, and his freedom and well-being are the most important thing in the world. So of course I feel that you should use every tool in the toolbox,” said his sister, Ingrid.\n\nEmily Atkinson, a close friend of Floderus, said: “Johan is someone who always brings people together. We have been left with a massive gap in our life without him, and we are also being taken hostage by the appalling situation,” she said as she struggled to keep back tears during a conversation with VICE News\n\n“I want to say: Johan, hold on. We’re here for you. We’ve rallied for you. We’re speaking up for you, and we’re here waiting for you. Hold on and stay strong.”",

        "content": "For ten years, the latest interviewee on Informer—our series amplifying the voices of insiders and whistleblowers—consulted as a health and safety officer for the petroleum giant Shell, dealing with the psychological fallout of its voracious global expansion.\n\nTheir job was to listen to thousands of oil and gas workers airing their concerns about the professional hazards and mental and physical toll of working on the frontlines for a company like Shell. Some days, the job meant hearing from contracted workers in the Global South complaining that they hadn’t been paid. Other times, it would be counseling those driven into a state of extreme mental disrepair by allegedly working 31 days straight to keep the pipeline running.\n\nVideos by VICE\n\n“There’d be times I would close my eyes to go to bed at night and I would just picture burning bodies bobbing around in a water that was on fire,” our Informer says at one point during the interview. “That was basically the nightmare they were talking about that could come true.”\n\nThink your job is stressful? In our Informer’s first week at Shell, the company had to deal with a spill that created an oil slick the size of Belgium just off the Nigerian coast.\n\nHeavy shit indeed. You can watch the film now at YouTube or in the player below.\n\nPlay video\n\nNow, here’s an interview about the interview, with VICE director Alexi Phillips.\n\nVICE: First of all, thanks for making this intensely depressing film for me to watch. I haven’t slept since.\n\nAlexi Phillips: No worries.\n\nHow did the Shell informer first get in touch?\n\nI can’t really disclose that.\n\nMost of what’s talked about is disconcerting. How does this stuff stay out of the news?\n\nMost of these spills happen in countries that don’t get much media attention. Every once in a while a massive event, like what happened in the Gulf of Mexico, makes the news but the fact that there are thousands of tiny spills every day is just seen as more of the status quo and not remarkable enough to be ‘breaking news.’\n\nI was assuming the dangers of oil production would primarily be posed to the environment, or to members of the public whose lands or waters are suddenly destroyed by a big spill. I wasn’t expecting to hear that people actually working for these companies would be losing their lives, too.\n\nYeah, they are working in highly pressurized environments, with extremely combustible liquid and gas, so the risk is inherent—especially when they’re working offshore. But the danger is exacerbated by the crazy demands to continue pumping large quantities of oil, with a focus on profits above everything else.\n\nWhat surprised you most about what the Shell informer had to say?\n\nSadly, I was not that surprised. In all honesty I think that was my big takeaway from the interview. There was nothing she could tell me about that industry that would shock me or that I couldn’t believe.\n\nWhat changes do you hope these big oil companies to make in the future?\n\nI hope they get more robustly regulated, as I think they have demonstrated they cannot be trusted with our future.\n\nWhat changes do you expect these big oil companies to make in the future?\n\nI expect that they will talk a big talk and walk a tiny walk.\n\nYou can watch the latest episode of Informer now at YouTube.\n\nWhen contacted for comment, Shell said: “Respect for human rights is fundamental to Shell’s core values of honesty, integrity and respect for people. Our approach is informed by the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, and is embedded into our existing framework, such as our Shell General Business Principles and our Code of Conduct. The Code of Conduct details how employees, contractors and anyone else acting on behalf of Shell must behave to live up to our business principles.”",

        "content": "Former President Donald Trump has suffered through plenty of painful courtroom defeats during his lengthy career as one of America’s most litigious businessmen.\n\nThis time looks different. He’s now officially overdue to receive a downright brutal judicial ruling in a case that threatens to dismember his business empire, drain his cash reserves and drive him out of New York State as a businessman forever.\n\nVideos by VICE\n\nManhattan Supreme Court Justice Aurthur Engoron blew through a self-imposed soft end-of-the-month deadline on Wednesday to deliver a judgment in the sweeping multi-million fraud lawsuit brought by the New York Attorney General Letitia James. Trump and his company have already been found liable, and are now just waiting to find out the size of the punishment. That decision could land at any moment, zapping Trump’s business like a thunderbolt when it does, in what could easily be the largest financial penalty of Trump’s life.\n\nThe New York Attorney General’s Office is seeking $370 million, along with a lifetime ban on Trump working in New York real estate or serving as an executive or director of a company based in the state. Judge Engoron declared Trump and his business liable for fraudulently overstating Trump’s wealth for financial gain in September. Now, the same judge bears sole responsibility for setting the penalty. A spokesperson for the court said Thursday that the ruling has been delayed until early to mid-February.\n\nA $370 million fine would follow Trump’s $83 million defamation loss to writer E. Jean Carroll, in a lawsuit over Trump’s derisive denials of Carroll’s claim that Trump raped her in a New York department store bathroom in the 1990s.\n\nSuch mammoth judgements dwarf notable courtroom defeats Trump has faced in the past.\n\nTrump’s company was fined only $1.6 million when it was found criminally liable in late 2022 for paying executives in off-the-books perks in what prosecutors branded an illegal scheme to minimize taxes.\n\nWhen Trump settled three lawsuits brought against his Trump University real estate training program in November 2016, right after he was elected president, he paid out a total of $25 million. In that instance, the NY Attorney General’s office had accused the operation of fraud, saying the unaccredited, for-profit venture misled its customers by calling the business a “university.”\n\nThe New York AG also had a hand in shutting down the Donald J. Trump Foundation, the personal charity Trump founded in 1987, through a lawsuit that forced the operation to dissolve in 2018. The office accused the charity of engaging in “persistently illegal conduct,” and said Trump used the foundation for his personal and political benefit. Yet when the foundation was shuttered, it was only forced to pay out less than $4 million to eight different charities.\n\nThis time, the stakes are much higher.\n\nThe potential combined $450 million in damages from both the New York fraud lawsuit and the Carroll case would equal roughly 15 percent of Trump’s $3.1 billion fortune, as estimated by Bloomberg Billionaires Index.\n\nTrump himself has boasted that his net worth amounts to some $10 billion or more, but independent experts generally assess his real fortune to be only a fraction of that amount, although still likely in the billions.\n\nTrump claimed last year that his cash stockpiles are “substantially in excess” of $400 million. He may in fact have $600 million in cash, according to Bloomberg estimates.\n\nTrump’s company is notoriously opaque, meaning that it’s hard to know exactly how much damage losing $450 million would inflict. Most of Trump’s known wealth is held in the form of real estate, including Trump Tower and residential and commercial buildings in Manhattan; golf courses around the country; the Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Florida; and his Seven Springs estate in Westchester County, NY.\n\nTrump has often boasted about the amount of cash he keeps lying around.\n\n“We have a lot of cash,” Trump said in a deposition with New York attorney general’s office lawyers in April 2023. “I believe we have substantially in excess of $400 million in cash, which is a lot for a developer. Developers usually don’t have cash. They have assets, not cash. We have, I believe, $400-plus [million] and going up very substantially every month.”\n\nTrump won’t have to pay the full amount for either penalty immediately, and hopes to appeal both losses. But the amount will grow while he appeals, rising by 9 percent annually, according to The Wall Street Journal.\n\nTrump spent approximately $50 million in donor money on legal bills and investigation-related expenses in 2023, The New York Times reported on Wednesday. All told, Trump’s various legal committees spent roughly $210 million in 2023, while raising only $200 million, according to Politico. In other words, Trump’s legal fees are draining resources from his political operation, which spent more last year than it took in despite Trump’s incessant fundraising.\n\nThen there’s the question of whether, once this case and its appeals are all wrapped up, Trump’s family business will even be allowed to continue to exist in its current state.\n\nIn September, Judge Engoron caused a stir when, upon finding that Trump had committed fraud, he ordered the revocation of many state certificates Trump needs to run his companies. The judge said that the companies, which hold many of Trump’s assets including Trump Tower on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan, should be turned over to a receiver for “dissolution.”\n\nWhen asked whether he meant that Trump’s buildings should be sold off, Judge Engoron demurred, saying he’d clarify his precise meaning later. That September order is now under appeal.\n\nYet so far Trump has lodged several other appeals related to the fraud case, including an attempt to remove James from the case, dismiss the suit completely and block multiple subpoenas.\n\nAlmost all of those efforts have failed.",

        "content": "No more bald jokes, girls.\n\nI’ll be the first to say that superficial comments and judgments about someone’s physical appearance are not cool. But to label bald jokes a form of sexual harassment? Seems a bit extreme.\n\nVideos by VICE\n\nApparently, the High Court thinks otherwise.\n\nThis whole lengthy case started back in 2019 when an electrician named Tony Finn accused his boss of sexual harassment. Allegedly, Finn’s boss at the British Bung Company had referred to him as a “stupid bald cunt.”\n\nMaybe this is my American sensibilities, but I’m thinking maybe the C-word is more of an issue here—but I digress.\n\nAccording to the panel of judges, led by Judge Jonathan Brain, the term “bald” is “inherently related to gender,” so using it against a man could breach equality laws. In other words, “bald” is a sexist insult.\n\nThe three-person panel also stated that the remark “crossed a line” and there is “a connection between the word ‘bald’ and the protected characteristic of sex.”\n\nAccording to The Telegraph, the panel consisted of three bald men.\n\n“[Baldness] is much more prevalent in men than women,” they said. (K, well, tell that to the PCOS community.)\n\nNow, according to The Sun, the full judgment made at the Employment Appeals Tribunal has finally been published—four years after the initial comments against Finn. The electrician will likely receive compensation for the alleged sexual harassment.\n\nAs expected, this case is gaining major traction on social media, with many users expressing their disbelief over the ruling.\n\n“This is silly,” one person wrote. “We should all strive to be better people and to be more understanding and supportive with those who are missing something. But it seems silly to waste the court’s time with things so small.”\n\nMost others labeled the notion as nonsense.\n\nHowever, one person posed a different perspective: “I think it’s a bit extreme, but I can see the precedent. If people cannot joke about something a woman cannot control, then why should they be able to joke about something a man cannot control?”\n\nShrugs.",

        "content": "British comedian Jamali Maddix is well known around these parts for his acclaimed VICELAND show on zealots, racists, and other angry people, Hate Thy Neighbor. Lately, Jamali’s been back on the extremist beat, hanging out with pedophile hunters and a gun cult led by a man named ‘King Bullethead’ for a new TV docuseries.\n\nWe called him up to get a read on Follow The Leader, set to air from September 17th in the UK.\n\nVideos by VICE\n\nVICE: Hey Jamali. Obviously this beat is a familiar one for you. But how have extreme ways of thinking, cults, etc. all developed and changed in recent years?\n\nJamali Maddix: I think the internet changed everything when it comes to those communities. If there was a small group in a small town in America, it stayed within that small town in America. But things spread more now, so you’ve got movements or ideas that can spread easily. And the cost of making content has dropped dramatically. So you’ve got men and women making their content, of whatever their ideas are, at a high quality—and they can push it out on the biggest channel in the world, which is the internet, you know? So I think these ideas are more easily accessible than ever.\n\nYeah, it’s also interesting how everyone’s nan now seems to have quite a fringe view of the world.\n\nWhen it comes to certain views—maybe political or low-end conspiratorial views—it’s also because there’s so much information. I think it’s difficult for certain generations to decipher what is and isn’t real, because there’s a generation of people who grew up when newspapers were just… I mean, obviously, there’s always been lies in newspapers, but journalists investigated a story and then they presented the story, maybe with a twinge of political bias, but they presented pretty much the story—and now it’s just, “I can make a website and say whatever I want,” and it’s considered fact. So I don’t think everyone’s got a ‘fringe’ view. It’s just some people can’t decipher between what is the real and the fake thing on the internet.\n\nAI images are going to change things a lot as well, because they will actually trick people’s eyes into thinking real images—things that have never happened—actually happened. It’s gonna be a weird future.\n\nWhat role has COVID played in all this?\n\nI think people during COVID had a lot of time to think. It’s not my line, but a comedian once said to me: “Some people have too much time to think, and they have arguments with themselves that they always win.” I think people had so much time on their hands, and they reflected on their life and made more brash decisions.\n\nIn terms of the new series, Rod of Iron [a militant pro-gun offshoot of the Moonies religious movement, led by brothers Yung Jin Moon and Kook-jin Moon] used a lot of people’s apprehension [of the vaccine] to draw more people towards their ideas.\n\nJamali shares a moment wtih an interviewee in ‘follow the leader’ (credit: uktv)\n\nSo what’s some of the exciting new stuff that you unearthed while shooting this series?\n\nI enjoyed doing the predator hunter one; I enjoyed doing the passport bro one. I don’t know what mad things I uncovered. I don’t think there was like a mad…\n\nPredator hunter as in like…?\n\nIt’s people who they’ve alleged to have spoken to underaged children, and then they go and confront them.\n\nI think there’s something a bit off about that.\n\nYeah. In the film, it’s that complication. That’s what the film’s about, is the complicated nature of it, because we all agree that’s a bad crime, but it’s like, should they be… you know what I mean? All those questions get thrown up, and there isn’t really a definitive answer to it. That’s how I wanted to make it. I wanted it to be as if the audience member decides for themselves, where their morality lies within it, you know?\n\nHas anything in your films made you feel like “we’re fucked”?\n\nI felt that going in.\n\nYeah.\n\nI think that’s just apparent with the state of the world. I don’t think my docs are going to be the change of that; I’m not the canary in the coal mine. Human beings, we just adjust. If you would have said pre-COVID, there’ll be a time when you can’t go out for two years. You would have gone, “Nah, fucking I’ll go mad.” But you did it. You know what I mean? If you went to prison in fucking, the world’s worst prison, the first few days [would be tough], but after a couple months, you’d adjust. That’s just how human beings are. We just adjust, or we don’t and we don’t survive. And I think human beings just survive. So I think wherever the world goes, whether it’s the internet or whether it’s this, we just adjust, or we don’t. That’s the two options we have. The films are just exploring what’s going on and the people behind it.\n\nJamali Maddix: Follow The Leader airs on U&Dave at 10PM each Tuesday from 17th September, with the box-set available to stream free on U from Tuesday 17th September.\n\nFollow Nick Thompson on X at @niche_t_",

        "source": "https://time.com/",
        "content": "WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump has signed into law legislation funding the government through the end of September, ending the threat of a partial government shutdown and capping off a struggle in Congress that deeply divided Democrats. Harrison Fields, White House principal deputy press secretary, said in a post on X that Trump signed the continuing resolution Saturday. The bill largely keeps government funding at levels set during Joe Biden's presidency, though with changes. It trims non-defense spending by about $13 billion from the previous year and increases defense spending by about $6 billion, which are marginal changes when talking about a topline spending level of nearly $1.7 trillion.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nThe Senate cleared the legislation on Friday in a 54-46 party line vote, with 10 members of the Senate Democratic caucus helping the bill advance to passage despite opposition from within their party — most vocally from colleagues in the House, who exhorted them to reject the bill out of hand. Senate Democrats argued for days over whether to force a shutdown, livid that Republicans in the House had drafted and passed the spending measure without their input. Democrats said the legislation shortchanges health care, housing and other priorities and gives Trump wide leeway to redirect federal spending even as his administration and the Department of Government Efficiency rapidly dismantle congressionally approved agencies and programs. In the end, enough of the Democratic senators decided a government shutdown would be even worse than letting the funding bill pass. Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said a shutdown would have given the Trump administration the ability to deem whole agencies, programs and personnel non-essential, furloughing staff with no promise they would ever be rehired.\n\n“A shutdown will allow DOGE to shift into overdrive,” Schumer said. “Donald Trump and Elon Musk would be free to destroy vital government services at a much faster rate.”\n\nPassage of the funding bill through the House earlier in the week was a victory for Trump and House Speaker Mike Johnson, who managed to hold Republicans together and muscle the bill to passage without support from Democrats — something they've rarely been able to achieve in the past.",

        "content": "President Donald Trump's administration on Saturday began making deep cuts to Voice of America and other government-run, pro-democracy programming as the president continued his campaign to restructure government without congressional approval. On Friday night, shortly after Congress passed its latest funding bill, Trump directed his administration to reduce the functions of several agencies to the minimum required by law. That included the U.S. Agency for Global Media, which houses Voice of America, Radio Free Europe and Asia and Radio Marti, which beams Spanish-language news into Cuba.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nOn Saturday morning, Kari Lake, the failed Arizona gubernatorial and U.S. Senate candidate whom Trump named a senior advisor to the agency, posted on X that employees should check their email. That coincided with notices going out placing Voice of America staff on paid administrative leave. The agency also sent notices terminating grants to Radio Free Asia and other programming run by the agency. Voice of America transmits United States domestic news into other countries, often translated into local languages. Radio Free Asia, Europe and Marti beam news into countries with authoritarian regimes in those regions like China, North Korea and Russia. Combined, the networks reach an estimated 427 million people. They date back to the Cold War and are part of a network of government-funded organizations trying to extend U.S. power and combat authoritarianism that includes USAID, another agency targeted by Trump.\n\nThe latest reductions are especially provocative because the Agency for Global Media is an independent agency chartered by Congress, which passed a law in 2020 limiting the power of the agency's presidentially appointed executives. Trump has already taken several moves to gut congressionally-mandated programs, setting up a potential Supreme Court showdown over the limits of presidential power. Trump's order requiring reductions also includes several other, lesser-known government agencies such as the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, a nonpartisan think tank, the United States Interagency Council on Homelessness and the Community Development Financial Institutions Fund. The Trump administration has already made several controversial moves regarding Voice of America, including suspending a respected journalist who noted criticism of Trump and canceling contracts that allowed VOA to use material from independent news organizations, such as the Associated Press.\n\n—Associated Press writer Matthew Lee in Washington contributed to this report.",

        "content": "Lunar eclipses rely on a different sun-moon-Earth lineup, occurring when the Earth moves between the sun and the moon, blocking the solar light that typically reflects off the lunar surface and casting a shadow in its place. Lunar eclipses can either be partial, with only some of the moon’s surface covered, or total, with the entire face of the moon darkened. The type of lunar eclipse depends on how precise the alignment of the three bodies is.\n\nThe moon does not orbit the Earth in a perfectly flat plane around our planet’s equator. Rather, its orbit is slightly cockeyed, tilted at an angle of 5.145 degrees. That means that sometimes the moon will pass in front of the Earth slightly above or below the planet’s midline, allowing some solar light to reach a portion of the lunar surface. Only when the three bodies are perfectly lined up—as they will be this week—will a total lunar eclipse occur.",

        "source": "https://time.com/",
        "content": "Questions about the state of the economy intensified this week as the U.S. stock market fell on Monday yet again—just one day after President Donald Trump declined to dismiss the idea that a recession could happen. In a Sunday interview with Fox News, Trump was asked whether he believes that a recession might happen this year. “I hate to predict things like that. There is a period of transition, because what we're doing is very big. We're bringing wealth back to America. That's a big thing,” Trump said. “And there are always periods of... it takes a little time. But I think it should be great for us.\"\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average resumed some of its losses on Tuesday after it fell 150 points on Monday, while the S&P 500 dipped by 2.7% that same day. Part of the worries about a potential recession derive from Trump’s tariffs and trade war against countries such as Canada, China, and Mexico. In light of such concerns, financial experts are advising clients and others that economic downturns are a natural part of the market. Still, they believe it's best to prepare now for any potential hardships. “It's prudent to always be prepared,” says Kyle Newell, certified financial planner and owner of Newell Wealth Management “[Especially] in the event something does happen, because we never really know until we're kind of already in it.” Here are the tips experts gave on how to prepare for a recession. Have sufficient emergency reserves Layoffs often occur during recessions. So, it's best to be proactive and save in advance of potential cuts. Ending unnecessary subscriptions, or other forms of entertainment can help people supplement their emergency budget.\n\n“We want to make sure [people] have enough cash reserves, hopefully without having to touch a 401(k), or anything of that nature, to live,” says Newell. How much should you save? “If it's a two-income household, maybe three months of living expenses,” Newell advises. “If it's a single-income household, maybe six months of living expenses.” Jorie Johnson, a certified financial planner at Financial Futures LLC, advises people to try to include their non-discretionary expenses when budgeting their savings. That means that aside from rent, utilities, food, and insurance, there should be some cushion for other purchases that might be made on the regular, whether that be clothes for work or ink for the printer. Financial planners told TIME that the savings should be stored in either a money market fund—a low-risk mutual fund that invests in short-term debt securities, per Charles Schwab—or a high-yield savings account. That way, the money grows as inflation also increases. Newell also recommends people with a bank or credit union to look into alternative options for a savings account. “I would want to be FDIC insured or NCUA insured, if it's a credit union. You want to be in government insured money,” he says of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or the National Credit Union Administration.\n\nOnly make large, long-term investments if necessary During financial downturns, the value of homes, cars, and mortgage prices can fall, making it optimal for those looking to make long-term investments. “If their emergency fund is adequate and they feel confident in their job position, buying large ticket items during a recession can be a very good move,” says Johnson. “But it's more important to make sure that you've protected yourself against unforeseen events like being downsized or laid off.” Johnson advises people to only make such purchases if they live in a two-income household, due to the potential for being laid off. “If you're going to be making a large purchase in the short-term, make sure that you have money set aside for that, so that you're not exposed to the ups and downs of the market,” says Michael Dunham, director of planning at Fontana Financial Planning.\n\nStill, other planners note that people should only purchase a home if they can do it under the current market conditions, and not necessarily make a decision with the idea that a recession will happen. Keep contributing to your retirement fund If people can continue to do so, experts say it's important to keep investing in a 401(k) or other retirement account. “If somebody hasn't funded their Roth IRA or their HSA for the year, or if somebody is contributing to their 401(k), there's a chance to maybe increase the contributions to get more money in during the downturn,” notes Dunham. Folks that are already relying on their retirement income should try to reduce the risk of their investment portfolio, and look into their “more conservative options” by “reducing the exposure to stock funds,” according to Newell. But overall, experts say people, especially younger folks should not sound the alarm. “The stock market will start declining before a recession happens. And oftentimes people's 401(k) are tied to the stock market, so they may see value go down. They should know not to panic, because they have the time to make it up,” says Newell.\n\n“The way that we like to frame any downturn, or any recession … is just accepting the inevitability,” says Dunham. “The downturns are going to happen. [Just] make sure that your portfolio is set up in a way to withstand whatever that downturn may be.”",

        "source": "https://time.com/",
        "content": "January’s unveiling of DeepSeek R1, China's most advanced AI model to date, signals a dangerous inflection point in the global AI race. As President Donald Trump warned in his recent address on technological security, this development represents nothing short of a \"wake-up call\" for American leadership. What's at stake isn't merely economic competitiveness but perhaps the most geopolitically precarious technology since the atomic bomb In the nuclear age that followed Oppenheimer's creation of the atomic bomb, America's technological monopoly lasted roughly four years before Soviet scientists achieved parity. This balance of terror, combined with the unprecedented destructive potential of these new weapons, gave rise to mutual assured destruction (MAD)—a deterrence framework that, despite its flaws, prevented catastrophic conflict for decades. The stakes of nuclear retaliation discourage each side from striking first, ultimately allowing for a tense but stable standoff\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nToday's AI competition has the potential to be even more complex than the nuclear era that preceded it, in part because AI is a broadly applicable technology that touches nearly every domain, from medicine to finance to defense. Powerful AI may even automate AI research itself, giving the first nation to possess it an expanding lead in both defensive and offensive power. A nation on the cusp of wielding superintelligent AI, an AI vastly smarter than humans in virtually every domain, would amount to a national security emergency for its rivals, who might turn to threatening sabotage rather than cede power. If we are heading towards a world with superintelligence, we must be clear-eyed about the potential for geopolitical instability. We map out some of the geopolitical implications of powerful AI and propose a cohesive “Superintelligence Strategy” in a new paper released this week. Let us imagine how the U.S. might reasonably respond to rival states seeking an insurmountable AI advantage. Suppose Beijing established a lead over American AI labs and reached the cusp of recursively-improving superintelligence before us. Regardless of whether Beijing could maintain control over what it was building, U.S. national security would be deeply and existentially threatened. Rationally, the U.S. might resort to threatening sabotage in the form of cyberattacks against AI datacenters to prevent China from achieving its goal. We might similarly expect Xi Jinping—or Vladimir Putin, who has little chance of obtaining the technology first—to respond in a similar fashion if we approach recursively-improving superintelligence. They would not stand idly by if a U.S. monopoly on power was imminent.\n\nJust as the destabilizing pursuit of nuclear monopoly eventually gave way to the stability of MAD during the nuclear era, we may soon enter a parallel deterrence dynamic for AI. If any state that attempts to seize AI supremacy can expect the threat of preemptive sabotage, states may be deterred from pursuing unilateral power altogether. We call this outcome Mutual Assured AI Malfunction (MAIM). As nations wake up to this possibility, we expect it will become the default regime, and we need to prepare now for this new strategic reality. MAIM is a deterrence framework designed to maintain strategic advantage, prevent escalation, and restrict the ambitions of rivals and malicious actors. For this to work, the U.S. must make clear that any rival destabilizing AI project, especially those aiming for superintelligence, will provoke retaliation. Here, offense—or at least the credible threat of offense—is likely the best defense. That means expanding our cyberattack capabilities and enhancing surveillance of adversary AI programs.\n\nWhile building this deterrence framework, America must simultaneously advance on two additional fronts: AI nonproliferation and domestic competitiveness.\n\nFor nonproliferation, we should enact stronger AI chip export controls and monitoring to stop compute power getting into the hands of dangerous people. We should treat AI chips more like uranium, keeping tight records of product movements, building in limitations on what high-end AI chips are authorized to do, and granting federal agencies the authority to track and shut down illicit distribution routes.\n\nFinally, to maintain a competitive edge, the U.S. should focus on building resilience in its supply chains for military tech and computing power. In particular, our reliance on Taiwan for AI chips is a glaring vulnerability and a critical chokepoint. While the West has a decisive AI chip advantage, Chinese competition could disrupt that. The U.S. should therefore step up its domestic design and manufacturing capabilities. Superintelligent AI poses a challenge as elusive as any that policymakers have faced. It is what theorists Horst Rittel and Melvin Webber called a “wicked problem,” one that continually evolves with no final formula for resolution. MAIM, supplemented by robust nonproliferation and renewed investment in American industry, offers a strategy grounded in the lessons of past arms races. There is no purely technical fix that can tame these forces, but the right alignment of deterrence, nonproliferation, and competitiveness measures can help the United States navigate the emerging geopolitical reality of superintelligence.",

        "source": "https://time.com/",
        "content": "In the six years since I published Maid, almost every person who’s interviewed me has asked me the same question: Do I, a person who became kind of famous for writing about cleaning people’s houses, have a house cleaner myself?\n\nThe simple answer was no. But it was not because my house was already spotless. Far from it. The truth was, I just couldn’t bring myself to do it.\n\nWhen I worked as a house cleaner, I spent hours dusting rooms with objects valuable enough to pay for a weeks’ worth of groceries that I desperately needed. Everything I polished carried an invisible price tag with an obscene amount of money that had been spent. Receipts left on countertops for dry cleaning listed totals that were more than what I had paid for my car. A lot of the rooms I cleaned weren’t even used regularly, so it became my job to dust closed-off spaces bigger than the studio apartment I lived in.\n\nRead More: I Left Poverty After Writing 'Maid.' But Poverty Never Left Me\n\nI worked for nine bucks an hour, and my take-home pay was about six. While the wages from the job allowed me to barely survive, the work itself seemed so wasteful and unnecessary that I started to feel that way about myself. My clients were pleasant for the most part, but a handful of them weren’t. Regardless, a noticeable power imbalance weighed on me whenever I had to get on my hands and knees to clean the floors and toilets. To hire a house cleaner myself would not only mean putting someone in that position, where they, too, might feel worthless, but also becoming someone I used to hate.\n\nMy story is one of living in poverty, struggling to afford housing and food. I used to stay up late at night, hungry and exhausted, fighting to complete assignments for college, hoping that one day I could support my young daughter in a way that did not involve pulling hair from a bathtub drain. When my first book became a bestseller, my unexpected success skyrocketed me into a whole different class of society, namely one in which the inhabitants never had to worry if they would be able to pay the bill to heat their house. Suddenly, running out of shampoo was no longer a source of stress because I always had an extra bottle in a pantry. I had a whole shelf dedicated to toilet paper, something I used to steal from public restrooms because I couldn’t afford to buy my own.\n\nWhen my husband and I moved into our house, I told him I wanted to replace all of the cheap furniture and dishes I’d collected over the years from clearance racks and donations. When I received a large check for the Netflix series based on my book a few months after we moved in, I used it to furnish my whole house, down to the rainbow-colored Fiestaware dishes and Le Creuset cookware on display on the open shelves in the kitchen. My children’s bedrooms were the parts I enjoyed being able to furnish the most. As a house cleaner, it pained me to know how other kids my daughter’s age lived, and now I was able to provide my own with a similar space, complete with bedding that matched and bed frames made from real wood.\n\nRead More: We Didn't Have Much Money. My Daughter Still Deserved Joy\n\nBut I couldn’t enjoy it, at least not entirely. My husband and I couldn’t keep up on the mess our dogs and two daughters created. We also had a conflict of what we thought a clean house looked like. He had grown up in a house that most would call “lived-in” where mine could have been described as a sterile museum. My family didn’t see the house as a never-ending list of tasks, but everywhere I looked, I saw work that needed to be done. My bedroom was over a crawl space, in which we stored junk we no longer needed but had not found the time to sort through, and I didn’t have to see the grime and clutter to know it was there.\n\nIt was difficult to explain why this gave me such anxiety. But the constant awareness of the tasks needed to be done made it hard for me to relax, to focus, to work. I would recall the scene in Anthony Bourdain’s Kitchen Confidential where a chef would press his palm on a cook’s cutting board, which was “littered with peppercorns, spattered sauce, bits of parsley, bread crumbs and the usual flotsam and jetsam that accumulates quickly if not constantly wiped away with a moist cloth.” He’d raise his hand, showing the cook all the debris he’d picked up, and admonish: “That’s what the inside of your head looks like now. Work clean!”\n\nAnd still I resisted hiring someone to help.\n\nIt was four years before my neighbor convinced me to call a friend of hers who owned a cleaning company. Originally, I was just looking for deep clean of the whole house, but the more I talked to the owner, the better I felt about hiring cleaners to help us keep up on the regular cleaning, too. She paid her employees a living wage, and if a client canceled, she offered them the same number of hours on another job to make up for it. This had always been the most stressful part of the job for me—I relied on the income, but my clients would cancel their service on a whim, leaving me out the 30 bucks that I needed to pay my electric bill.\n\nWhen I told the owner I’d once worked for a company that forced us to clean every hard floor on our hands and knees, using two rags in a “wax on, wax off” motion from The Karate Kid, she laughed and shook her head, saying she tried to protect her employees from doing repetitive motions all day. She also mentioned that her teams used all-natural cleaners because she didn’t want her employees to breathe in chemicals. I nodded and told her about the time I’d had to stop work and go to urgent care because I’d created a mixture of the wrong cleaning agents and accidentally inhaled a toxic cloud. “They tried to force me to do a drug test, too,” I said. “I forgot about that.”\n\nA week after the walk-through, a team of four cleaners spent five hours in my house. I’d spent several days clearing the counters of piles of papers, markers, and glue sticks to make it easier to wipe the surface beneath them and picking up my youngest daughter’s room as best I could. On the kitchen counter, I left a note to say thank you, and I tipped them all 50 bucks each. When I got home, my to-do list was no longer unending. I could make some adjustments – like putting away snow globes and other knickknacks that seemed unnecessary to be on display – but they were hardly all-consuming.\n\nThe company had a weekly spot available, so now I have two cleaners come to my house for two and half hours every Wednesday. I still spend part of Tuesday in preparation, making sure there aren’t any dishes in the sink and sometimes doing an extra deep vacuum. I leave the cleaners 20 bucks each for a tip and get everyone out of the house before they get here. Though one time I was running late and talked to the first one to arrive—he’d been with the company for 10 years.\n\nLast fall my husband and I separated for four months, and my whole life was in a sort of upheaval. My 10-year-old started sleeping with me at night, filling my bed with her favorite blankets and stuffed animals. Between work and caring for the kids, animals, and house on my own, there wasn’t much left for me. But one day I walked into my bedroom and saw the beautiful way the cleaners had made my bed and arranged all the stuffed animals. It made me smile, then brought tears to my eyes. It was the first time someone had made a lot of effort to take care of me in weeks.\n\nI went to the living room and, for once, I didn’t feel the urge to scrub the whole place down. The work was done. I could breathe.\n\nWhen I cleaned houses, I had just a few clients I truly felt I was helping. It’s only now that I’m a client myself that I can see the value of the work I did at my former job. I wonder how many of my clients were able to take a full, relaxing breath on the days I had been in their homes. I bet it was all of them. All these years later, aware of the immense respect and gratitude I have for the hardworking people who clean my house, I am able to better appreciate the person I was back then and be proud of the work she did to take care of others.\n\nMaybe the work I did was not actually wasteful and unnecessary after all. Maybe I wasn’t either.",

        "source": "https://time.com/",
        "content": "Tesla sales have been faltering worldwide as consumers push back against the company’s CEO Elon Musk and his political involvement with the Trump Administration. The company’s stock dropped 15% as of end of day on Monday, its steepest drop in five years, as the stock market plunged after President Donald Trump hinted at a recession on Sunday. And the president seems to have taken notice of Tesla’s dip—in a post on Truth Social Monday night, he blamed \"radical left lunatics\" for the boycott of Musk’s EV company and pledged to \"buy a brand new Tesla.\"\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nThe automaker could use the boost. Recent data shows that the brand’s sales have seen major drops in markets around the world. According to the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association (ACEA), Tesla sold just under 7,517 vehicles in Europe in January, half of what it sold in January the year prior. That’s despite sales of battery and hybrid electric vehicles of any brand rising in January as the E.U. continues to tighten regulations on emissions from new vehicles. Looking at Germany, the largest market for EVs in the E.U., the country saw a 30% year-over-year rise in electric vehicle sales in February, but Tesla sales were down more than 70% compared to last year—less than 1,500 new Teslas were registered in the country in February. Other European countries also saw sales fall. Between January and February of 2025, Tesla recorded a 50% drop in sales in Portugal and 45% in France according to Reuters, while sales fell 42% in Sweden and 48% in Norway.\n\nSales are falling outside of Europe as well. In Australia, data from the Electric Vehicle Council shows that Tesla sales dropped over 70% compared to last year— recording just 1,592 sales in February compared to 5,665 in February 2024, the Guardian reports. Meanwhile, Tesla shipments from China dropped 49% in February, as the automaker shipped out 30,688 vehicles—the lowest monthly figure since July 2022, according to Bloomberg. Tesla has faced growing competition from domestic EV makers in the country—Chinese automaker BYD sold more than 318,000 electric and hybrid cars last month, a 161% increase from last year. In California—the biggest domestic market for EVs thanks to its state mandate that 35% of new 2026 car models sold by automakers must be zero emissions—Tesla sales slumped for the fifth consecutive quarter, according to the latest data from the California New Car Dealers Association (CNCDA).\n\nNot every market, however, has been hit. Britain saw a record number of EV sales in 2024, and Tesla sales were up 20% in February.\n\nMusk has not commented on the sales dip, but when asked by Fox Business’s Larry Kudlow how he was running his other businesses, the billionaire said, “With great difficulty.”",

        "title": "Percival Everett Is Challenging the American Literary Canon",
        "source": "https://time.com/",
        "content": "Percival Everett claims he is not as brilliant as his fans know him to be. He deeply researches the worlds in which his novels are set, yet swears that everything he learns falls out of his head as soon as each book is published. “So I’m no smarter at the end than I was at the beginning,” he says, shrugging his shoulders. Years ago, sick of his writing students asking him if they were good enough to be published, he took a class to a bookstore in Middlebury, Vt., to prove he was not unique. “Look around,” he told them. “Anyone can be published. ‘Are you good enough to make a difference?’ is the question.”\n\nWith his latest, James, a reimagining of Huckleberry Finn told from the perspective of the escaped slave Jim—who drops his nickname for the more noble-sounding James—Everett has jump-started a conversation about the great American novel, how issues of race interplay with the so-called American canon, and how we talk to our children about America’s past. But just a few hours before he wins the National Book Award for fiction, he demurs when pressed on the book’s impact. “If a reader is coming to me for any kind of message or answer about anything in the world,” he says, “they’re already in deep trouble.”\n\nFor many, however, James has become an important companion piece to Mark Twain’s work, the book “all American literature comes from,” to quote Ernest Hemingway. “I’ve been getting lots of mail from former and current English teachers thanking me that they can now teach Huck Finn again because they can do it alongside James,” he admits, “which is great news for me and certainly flattering, but doesn’t come as a great surprise. It’s a problematic text.”\n\nEverett, 68, would do away with the canon altogether if he could. But at the very least he hopes that writers, readers, and educators can acknowledge the inherent issues with putting certain books on a pedestal. “My joke is, ‘The canon is loaded,’” says Everett. “Canon formation is necessarily skewed. It’s necessarily racist and sexist. As soon as you’re saying there are these texts that must be read, someone has to choose. Who chooses?”\n\nWhile Jim is little more than a sidekick on Huck’s journey down the Mississippi in the original, in Everett’s version he is at the center of the story. James and other Black characters code switch when white characters are present; on his own, James interrogates philosophers like Voltaire for his repugnant views on slavery. “Enslaved people, it had occurred to me, are always depicted as simple-minded and superstitious, and of course, they weren’t,” Everett says. “So I embarked on this.”\n\nEverett gives James the gift of language, and James writes his account of his travels with a stolen pencil stub—one which comes at great human cost. “Whoever controls language, controls everything. If someone has no voice, they cannot get what they want or what they need,” says Everett.\n\nEverett, who has published two dozen novels, including the Pulitzer Prize finalist Telephone, has historically bristled at being categorized in the genre of African American fiction, especially considering he has written everything from propulsive westerns to a novella styled like a Lifetime movie. “Any work of art that comes out of this American culture is about race. If there is no race in it, that is a statement about race,” he says.\n\nThis frustration is at the heart of Erasure, one of Everett’s early and best-known novels, which was adapted into the Oscar-winning 2023 film American Fiction. The story centers on Thelonious “Monk” Ellison, the author of experimental novels that don’t sell particularly well. Monk becomes so exasperated with the publishing industry bolstering Black fiction that depicts only stereotypes that he pens a novel as an illiterate thug to prove a point. The book is a hit, much to the author’s chagrin. James, too, will get the Hollywood treatment, with Steven Spielberg producing and Taika Waititi in talks to direct, though Everett insists this attention is “fleeting.” “I'll write some experimental novel next that no one will understand,” he says. “You would have to be crazy to get into literary fiction to get famous or to get rich.”",

        "title": "Why Nicole Kidman Never Stops Working",
        "source": "https://time.com/",
        "content": "In the days after giving birth, Nicole Kidman found herself unable to breastfeed. “I was so terrified, asking, What just happened? Where’s my milk?” she says. “I remember standing naked in the shower, and my sister helped me. She was my source of strength. She’d had five children—she had the wisdom to pass on.”\n\nKidman and I are curled up in chairs beside a fireplace inside a historic Nashville home, not far from the house the Oscar winner shares with her husband Keith Urban, their two daughters, and a serene poodle named Julian. Kidman is warm and disarmingly inquisitive: she wants to hear about my postpartum experience too.\n\nPerhaps I shouldn’t be surprised by the ease of this conversation about vulnerable moments in our lives as women. Kidman, 57, has emotionally exposed herself on screen for decades. On the drama Big Little Lies, she huddled under a towel between shooting scenes of domestic violence. In her latest film, Babygirl, she growled while masturbating on the floor. She marks all her scripts with notes about her characters, coded for privacy. Then she shreds them: “It’s too personal. I want it gone.”\n\nPhotograph by Petra Collins for TIME\n\nBuy your copy of the Women of the Year issue, featuring Nicole Kidman here\n\nFilmmakers adore her rawness. “People believe if you have power, you don’t have to go to a place of vulnerability,” says Oscar-winning director Jane Campion, Kidman’s longtime friend. “A lot of actors won’t do that because it’s uncomfortable.” For Kidman to be truly open with a director requires a leap of faith. She describes herself as trusting to a fault. “It’s how I approach all of my relationships. I’ve been hurt because of that, but I’m still not jaded,” she says. “I’m delicate, but I’m very giving. The emotions I offer are very, very real, so I need to know that if I’m giving that to you, you value it.”\n\nShe has found that women behind the camera often offer a support reminiscent of how her sister cared for her in those early days after childbirth. And Kidman has made it her mission to use her immense star power to shine a light on emerging directors like Halina Reijn, who helmed the bold Babygirl, about a CEO who submits to an intern in a dominant-submissive affair. Many actors called out the dearth of opportunities for female filmmakers in the #MeToo era, but few followed through on promoting talent. Kidman pledged in 2017 to work with a woman director every 18 months. She has far exceeded her promise, partnering as a producer and actor with 19 in film and TV over the past eight years.\n\nIn 2023, fewer than 15% of films released theatrically were directed by women. For those who do receive funding and support, Kidman says, there’s undue pressure to “be perfect” on the first outing. “It can be changed,” she says, “but it can only be changed by actually being in the films of women.”\n\nWith curly, strawberry-blonde hair and a preternaturally intense stare, Kidman stood out among the 14-year-olds in the Sydney-area youth acting school that a 27-year-old Campion once visited to cast her student film. Kidman won the part but dropped out, fearing she’d look silly in the stocking she had to wear on her head for the costume—now one of her biggest regrets. But the two stayed in touch, and Kidman consulted Campion after making the jump to Hollywood where, at first, her newsmaking marriage to Tom Cruise in 1990 threatened to overshadow her work.\n\n“By the time she was married to Tom, people in America didn’t understand Nicole had a whole career in Australia that was revered,” Campion recalls. “They just thought she was riding on his career. She was in despair about the roles she was being offered, and wondering how she could change her trajectory.” Kidman jumped at opportunities to work with directors she admired. A series of performances in the late 1990s, in Gus Van Sant’s To Die For, Campion’s The Portrait of a Lady, and Sam Mendes’ staging of The Blue Room in London, proved her bona fides.\n\nPetra Collins for TIME\n\nKidman has since worked with auteur after auteur. When certain directors call, she doesn’t even read the script before saying yes: she gleefully signed onto Lars von Trier’s 2003 avant-garde thriller Dogville; Yorgos Lanthimos’ unsettling 2017 drama The Killing of a Sacred Deer; and Robert Eggers’ bloody 2022 fable, The Northman.\n\nAnd, of course, Stanley Kubrick’s Eyes Wide Shut. Reijn has said that Babygirl was, in part, inspired by Kidman’s performance. In the 1999 movie, her character shares a sexual fantasy that triggers a crisis of masculinity for her husband, played by Cruise. Reijn fantasized about Kidman’s character carrying out the imagined affair. It’s the kind of evolution Kidman hopes to encourage by opening doors for women: “Stanley was dealing with it from the male perspective, and Halina chose to reinterpret it as a woman.”\n\nBabygirl, released on Christmas, capped a year of stories about women’s sexuality in midlife. Miranda July’s best seller All Fours, the Anne Hathaway romance The Idea of You, the Laura Dern movie Lonely Planet, and another Kidman project, A Family Affair, all featured women in their 40s and 50s entangled with younger lovers. “It’s always been there—it just hasn’t been told. Maybe it’s threatening,” Kidman says. But she is, as TIME’s film critic Stephanie Zacharek posited in her Babygirl review, in her “don’t give a f-ck” era. Kidman doesn’t swear, but she admits, giggling, that the sentiment resonates. “I have the philosophy to never fight anything,” she says. “Surrender.”\n\nShe’s come a long way from the teen who was embarrassed to wear a stocking on her head, Campion says. “That was a lesson to her later: be brave.”\n\nWhen we meet, Kidman has spent the previous day filming the crime series Scarpetta with Oscar winner Jamie Lee Curtis in Nashville and will fly to Berlin in the evening to wrap Season 2 of Nine Perfect Strangers before turning around to promote Mimi Cave’s thriller Holland at SXSW in Austin in March. Last year alone, she starred in A Family Affair, the Lulu Wang–directed Expats, Susanne Bier’s beach-set The Perfect Couple, and the CIA drama Lioness—all before Babygirl hit theaters.\n\nPetra Collins for TIME\n\nKidman is able to partner with so many female directors in part because she never stops working. “People go, ‘You’re a superwoman,’” Kidman says. “I hate it.” She doesn’t feel super—she gets fatigued like anyone else—but she’s a lifelong people pleaser. She fretted over bringing home perfect grades. If she can’t think of the exact right response to a text, she’ll ignore it for weeks. She’s often compelled to say yes to roles because doing so creates jobs. “People work when Nicole works,” Curtis says. “I’m working because Nicole is working.”\n\nAnd she knows it’s a privilege. She remembers times when she contemplated quitting: “When there was nothing exciting or relevant coming my way, when there was massive criticism or bullying, when your self-esteem is shattered, when you’ve been hit with some massive loss or grief and go, ‘I don’t want to get out of bed. It’s too frightening.’”\n\nCampion has witnessed Kidman pull herself out of moments of strife. “She’s always been a star, and that star has come up and come down, but Nicole knows that in itself is not what makes her happy. What makes her happy is her work.”\n\nKidman has been on a run of producing and starring in projects about privileged matriarchs whose lives unravel when a secret comes to light. It’s not that she’s particularly attracted to her glamorous yet guarded characters—those just happen to be the stories that get greenlighted. “I am so open to starting something completely a mess and shattered,” she says. “Where is it? Give me the material.”\n\nBut the part works. Audiences eat up her rich, icy characters. Campion, art house to the core, concedes there’s value in Kidman’s ability to tap into a hungry, predominantly female audience. “You can’t have power without being commercial,” she says. “You have to make money. Women want material that fits them, not just macho superheroes.”\n\nAnd there’s something deceptively progressive in those stories. Prestige roles for women often involve playing the supportive wife. But in her projects, Kidman is the star, with accomplished male actors—Alexander Skarsgard, Liev Schreiber, Antonio Banderas—bolstering her performances. When she says her onscreen husbands have been egoless, I can’t help but raise an eyebrow. “I’ve worked with some of the greatest male actors in the world, and they’ve been so generous. All of them. Is that crazy?” Kidman laughs. She wasn’t intending to flip a trope on its head. She just did it.\n\n—\n\nStyled by Stella Greenspan; hair by Italo Gregorio; make-up by Gucci Westman; production by Perfect Projects.",

        "title": "Why Canada Is Giving Mark Carney a Shot",
        "source": "https://time.com/",
        "content": "In the coming days, Mark Carney will be sworn in as the 24th Prime Minister of Canada, a political novice stepping onto the ice at a moment of maximum peril, both for his party and his country. Carney, who many years ago was the backup goalie for Harvard’s hockey team, will find himself in front of the net for a game that he can’t afford to lose. Donald Trump is threatening to use economic force to annex Canada, and Canadians are expected to go to the polls within weeks to decide who will guard the net—Carney or Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre, whose populist bombast is unusually intense for Canadian politics.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nIt would be a daunting task for any politician, let alone a rookie. Carney has never held elected office, but Canada’s desperate Liberals gave him a strong mandate to lead their party on Sunday, with 86% of the vote on the first ballot. That decisive vote was based wholly on the strength of Carney’s CV, which Immigration Minister Marc Miller points out is noteworthy. Asking about Carney’s CV is “like asking someone whether War and Peace is a good book,” says Miller, who backed him to take over from Justin Trudeau. “It’s a f***ing good book.” Read More: How Canada Fell Out of Love With Trudeau Trudeau, who was a high-school teacher before he was elected to Parliament, had the thinnest CV of any Prime Minister in Canadian history. He swept to office with a majority government in 2015 based on his good looks, boundless energy on the campaign trail, and family name—he is the son of former Prime Minister and Liberal icon Pierre Trudeau.\n\nCarney could hardly be more different. He lacks Trudeau’s gift for working a crowd, is not notably dashing, and his father was a high-school principal in Fort Smith, a town of 2,000 people in Canada’s far north. Where Trudeau has always been seen as a charismatic lightweight, Carney is a nose-to-the-grindstone type. He worked his way to Harvard, then Oxford University, then Goldman Sachs, then the governorship of first the Bank of Canada—where he drew global admiration for his management of the 2008 financial crisis—and then the Bank of England, where he kept Britain liquid after the U.K. voted in 2016 to leave the European Union. Carney’s cool was tested by the chaotic Brexit years, and he made lifelong enemies among the Brexiteers. But the man who gave him the job, George Osborne, who was finance minister under Conservative Prime Minister David Cameron, thinks he did a splendid job. Osborne recently told the CBC that Carney has the technical knowledge and the “street smarts” to cope with the trade war that Trump has imposed on Canada.\n\n“I think if I was sending someone into bat for Canada, I’d want Mark Carney,” he said. “The Canadian with the most international experience in the whole of Canada is Mark Carney.” Canada’s Liberals hope his experience managing crises will be enough to convince voters to re-elect them in an election expected this spring. Canadians have watched, horrified, as Trump has repeatedly threatened to bring in 25% tariffs—which could kill up to 600,000 jobs in Canada—unless Canada agrees to become the 51st state. Trump has twice ordered tariffs, then pulled back at the last moment. Some went into effect on Tuesday, although he paused others temporarily after stock markets fell and the Big Three automakers pleaded for time. Canadians at first reacted to tariffs with icy fear, but that has hardened into anger and resolve. They repeatedly booed the Star Spangled Banner at hockey and basketball games, have taken bourbon off the shelves, cancelled Florida vacations, and boycotted American produce.\n\nAfter Trump’s first tariff threats, Trudeau reacted by trying to shuffle Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland out of cabinet to make way for Carney. She quit instead, and Trudeau was forced to resign, which led to the succession race that Carney won on Sunday. The Trump factor disrupted the carefully laid plans of Poilievre, who had looked sure to win the next election. For two and half years, Poilievre had built momentum as the agent of change. A pugnacious critic with an unerring instinct for finding his opponent’s weakness, he harnessed widespread anger over the cost-of-living crisis, record immigration, and one of the world’s worst housing crises, promising a great reckoning for Trudeau’s “woke” policies. But Poilievre, who took over his party by harnessing the anger of the truckers’ protest against vaccine mandates, borrowed techniques and messages from the MAGA movement, and that now makes him vulnerable.\n\nWhen Trump started attacking Canada, and Trudeau announced his resignation, the Liberals surged in the polls. The upcoming election now looks like a dead heat. Since candidates usually get a boost coming out of a leadership convention, the Conservatives will start out as the underdogs, a shocking turnaround after two years where they were leading by 20 points and the Liberals faced electoral oblivion. Underneath the horse-race numbers, there is more bad news for the Conservatives. Polling shows that voters are more likely to trust Carney than Poilievre to manage Trump—perhaps because part of Poilievre’s base is pro-Trump. That doesn’t mean, though, that Carney is sure to win. Exhaustion with the Liberals is profound after almost a decade in power. On other issues—particularly climate and resource development—Carney will face challenges. He has a long record of advocating for emission reductions in financial markets—he was a U.N. climate envoy—which may make it hard for him to appeal to voters who have had enough of Liberal restrictions on oil and gas production, especially now that Canadians are wishing they had more pipelines to tidewater so that they could tell Trump where to put his tariffs.\n\nRead More: How Canada Got Hooked on the U.S. Economy And Carney’s win was all but a coronation. As when Kamala Harris took over from Joe Biden, there was not time enough for a proper contest to test potential replacements for Trudeau. The Liberal leadership race was compressed, and Carney was far ahead all along, so his opponents were not motivated to challenge him too much. Freeland, who was once Trudeau’s trusted right hand, looks like she wants to be on Carney’s team. The abbreviated race means Carney is untested and may be prone to rookie mistakes. He struggled to explain a decision to move the headquarters of Brookfield Asset Management, where he was chair, from Toronto to New York. It was not a fatal mistake, but a sign that, like many from business who enter politics—he has not calibrated for the demands of public office. He showed some charm when he teased his leadership announcement on The Daily Show in January, but he is not an electric speaker, speaks French like a bureaucrat, and has little experience debating.\n\nCarney often says he is not a politician, contrasting himself with Poilievre, who has never done anything else. But it may be hard for a technocrat and multi-millionaire to present himself as an outsider and a change agent. Even those on his team acknowledge some trepidation.\n\n“It's hard to go from a minister to Prime Minister,” says Miller. “It's hard to go from just a backbencher to Prime Minister. It's really hard to go from politically nothing to Prime Minister.”\n\nBut the Liberals have no backup goalie, and the puck is about to drop.",

        "source": "https://time.com/",
        "content": "The Trump Administration is reportedly considering a new travel ban for citizens of up to 43 countries—a potential escalation of Trump’s first term travel ban which primarily targeted Muslim-majority countries. An internal memo, obtained and reviewed first by the New York Times and then by Reuters, suggests that the Trump Administration has included new countries in a draft of a 2.0 travel ban. Per the memo, the countries on the list would be sorted into three different tiers: red, orange, and yellow.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nCitizens from the 11 countries in the “red” category would reportedly be flatly barred from entering the United States. The 11 countries listed include Afghanistan, Bhutan, Cuba, Iran, Libya, North Korea, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, Venezuela, and Yemen. The Times reported, though, that this list was formed by the State Department a few weeks ago and changes could well be made. Citizens from the countries in the “orange” category—which includes Haiti, Russia, and Pakistan, would have their visas heavily restricted. Per the Times' reporting, citizens traveling to the U.S. from these countries would be subjected to “mandatory in-person interviews” in order to receive a visa. The third category includes countries in the “yellow” group—meaning they have 60 days to address concerns from the Administration, or else each country risks being moved up to the other categories. Countries reportedly listed under this category include Cambodia, Zimbabwe, and The Republic of Congo.\n\nThe White House has yet to publicly comment on the reported memo. TIME has reached out to the White House for comment. Mention of a potential new travel ban by the Trump Administration comes shortly after the President was asked during a press briefing on Wednesday, March 12, about what countries might be targeted on his 2.0 list. He shut down the question from the reporter, saying: “Wouldn’t that be a stupid thing for me to say?” Trump made promises on his campaign trail, stating his intention to restore the travel ban which caught much attention during its initial introduction during his first term. His signing of an Executive Order titled “Protecting The United States From Foreign Terrorists And Other National Security And Public Safety Threats” on Jan. 20 only served to reaffirm his intentions. Here’s a look back at the history of Trump’s travel ban and what he has shared about his plans moving forward.\n\nWhen former President Joe Biden entered office in 2021, he repealed the ban, calling it “a stain on our national conscience” and “inconsistent with our long history of welcoming people of all faiths and no faith at all.” “[T]hey have separated loved ones, inflicting pain that will ripple for years to come. They are just plain wrong,” Biden said in the Executive Order announcing the end to the ban. Trump promised to reinstate the travel ban during his campaign While on the campaign trail in 2024, Trump vowed to reinstate his 2017 travel ban several times. In July, at a campaign rally in St. Cloud, Minnesota, Trump told the crowd that he would “restore the travel ban, suspend refugee admissions, stop the resettlement, and keep the terrorists the hell out of our country” and that he would do so on “day one” of his presidency. In a later campaign event in Washington, Trump said he would ban people from “terrorist infested” areas and would “seal our borders.”\n\n“Remember the famous travel ban? We didn’t take people from certain areas of the world,” Trump said at the event in September 2024. “We’re not taking them from infested countries.” Trump’s Executive Order on “vetting” countries Trump did not reintroduce his travel ban on “day one” as promised, but on the first day of his second term, he did sign the Executive Order titled “Protecting the United States from Foreign Terrorists and other National Security and Public Safety Threats.” Within the Executive Order, Trump called for the Secretary of State, the Attorney General, the Secretary of Homeland Security, and the Director of National Intelligence to submit a report “identifying countries throughout the world for which vetting and screening information is so deficient as to warrant a partial or full suspension on the admission of nationals from those countries.” A deadline of 60 days was given.\n\nIf the timeline remains the same, this report is due to the President by next week. Although he may well have already received it.\n\nThe Executive Order also called for the report to identify how many people from said countries had entered the United States since Biden was inaugurated as President.\n\nThis was just one Executive Order in a slew of recent motions signed by Trump that look to drastically shift and harden the United States’ immigration and visitation policy.",

        "source": "https://time.com/",
        "content": "WASHINGTON — At least 112 North American bird species have lost more than half their populations in the past 50 years, according to a new report published Thursday. Among the birds showing the steepest declines are Allen’s hummingbirds, Florida scrub jays, golden-cheeked warblers, tricolored blackbirds and yellow-billed magpies. “These are the very real consequences if we are unable to conserve and protect the crucial habitats that birds need,” said study co-author Mike Brasher, a senior scientist at the nonprofit Ducks Unlimited.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nFor several decades, waterfowl stood out as a conservation bright spot with duck populations growing nationwide even as many other groups of birds declined in the U.S. But that trend has reversed, the new data shows. Read More: Scientists Have Bred Woolly Mice The total number of dabbling and diving ducks is down about 30% from 2017, said Brasher. Loss of grasslands habitat and a prolonged drought affecting the wetlands of the Great Plains’ prairie pothole region have taken a toll. Among all waterfowl, numbers are down 20% since 2014, the report found. The latest report is a collaboration between several groups including Cornell University, Ducks Unlimited, American Bird Conservancy, National Audubon Society and the American Ornithological Society. The work draws on survey data from the U.S. Geological Survey, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and citizen projects such as Cornell's eBird. There are some 2,000 bird species in North America. A third of the species examined are rated as high or moderate concern for conservation due to declining numbers, habitat loss or other threats.\n\nThese birds “need urgent conservation attention,” said Amanda Rodewald, a study co-author from Cornell, adding that bird survey trends also reveal the health of their habitats.\n\nThe report focuses on birds that must breed and feed in specific habitats such as forests, grasslands and coastal regions. Grassland birds including the Bobolink are most at risk.\n\nRead More: How Climate Change Will Affect the Seasons\n\n“For each species that we’re in danger of losing, it’s like pulling an individual thread out of the complex tapestry of life,” said Georgetown University biologist Peter Marra, who was not involved in the new report.\n\nMarra pointed to key past conservation successes in the U.S. – such as the comebacks of bald eagles, egrets and osprey.\n\n“We know that we can bend the curve back with targeted conservation plans. But we can’t just close our eyes and hope,\" he said.",

        "title": "Breaking Down Netflix's Crime Drama Adolescence",
        "source": "https://time.com/",
        "content": "Warning: This post contains spoilers for Adolescence Adolescence, streaming on Netflix, is more about a tragic loss of adolescence. The show opens with police in a northern English town bursting into the bedroom of 13-year-old Jamie Miller (Owen Cooper) and arresting him because he’s suspected of stabbing a female classmate named Katie to death. Over four episodes, the Miller family is run through the wringer as they are catapulted into the criminal justice system. The show, which was filmed in one continuous shot and makes viewers feel like they are in the middle of the chaos, touches on ever-relevant themes like the dangers of social media and society’s expectations of what it means to be masculine.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nHere’s what to know about Adolescence. The central questions in Adolescence Jamie initially denies he has done anything wrong, until Detective Inspector Bascombe (Ashley Walters) shows him security footage of him stabbing Katie to death, proof that he did kill her. Then, the main question becomes one of motive as authorities try to figure out why Jamie killed Katie and look for the murder weapon. As the police question Jamie, they also comb through dozens of social media posts that he and Katie exchanged to decode the nature of their relationship. What happens in Adolescence A large chunk of the first episode goes through the tedious procedures of entering the criminal justice system—the questioning, the fingerprints, walking up and down stairs to various rooms. And yet, the viewer is hooked, invested in seeing what happens to Jamie after he is arrested. In the second episode, we learn a bit more about how the investigation unfolds when Detective Inspector Bascombe visits Jamie’s school, which his own son Adam also attends, to look for information about the murder weapon. While Bascombe is there, Adam alerts his dad to the pejorative meaning behind some emojis that Katie was sending to Jamie on Instagram, prompting the detective to start looking into whether Jamie might have been cyber-bullied. For Bascombe, there is a silver lining—he’s always had trouble connecting with Adam, and the case brings them closer together.\n\nIn the third episode, Erin Doherty plays Briony Ariston, who is tasked with producing a psychological assessment of Jamie. During the interview, Jamie reveals that he had tried to ask Katie out after a photo of her topless was circulated to classmates via Snapchat as a type of revenge porn. He appears to have asked her out to make her feel better, but says Katie rejected his advances and then proceeded to send him the emojis attacking him for asking her out. He says she falsely accused him of being an \"incel,\" or involuntary celibate, referring to an online community of men who are frustrated that they aren't having sex. The show suggests that Jamie killed Katie because she hurt his feelings.\n\nAmari Jayden Bacchus as Adam Bascombe in Adolescence Courtesy of Netflix\n\nWhat Adolescence says about incel culture Based his schoolmates’ use of emojis on Instagram, Bascombe’s son Adam believes Katie was accusing Jamie of being an incel, a misogynistic community popular online with men’s rights activists that bonds over being rejected by women. Bascombe is stunned, exclaiming, “He’s 13! How can he be an involuntary celibate at 13?” Adam replies, “She’s saying he always will be. That’s when they say ‘you’re an ‘incel.’ You’re going to be a virgin forever,” noting other users were agreeing with her. There are notable examples of incels who have committed acts of violence, like Alek Minassian, who killed 10 pedestrians when he drove through a walkway in Toronto in 2018. He was inspired by Elliot Rodger, who carried out a 2014 murderous rampage that left six dead and 13 wounded near UC Santa Barbara and documented his rage against women who refused his advances.\n\nAdam explains that his classmates like to say that 80% of women are attracted to 20% of men, underscoring the pressure that young men are under when they start to have feelings for female classmates. Especially in the #MeToo era, men are still navigating how to properly approach women in a society that generally allows them the freedom to choose who they want to go out with—but that doesn’t excuse violence. And unlike their parents, they can use social media to access a lot more information that’s not necessarily age-appropriate. Director Philip Barantini, who has a seven-year-old daughter, hopes that the show will makes viewers more sympathetic to what young people are going through today, explaining in the press notes, “When I was growing up, if you had a problem with someone, you sorted it out in the playground then went home and forgot about it, but now social media makes that impossible.”\n\nOwen Cooper as Jamie Miller, Erin Doherty as Briony Ariston, in Adolescence Courtesy of Netflix\n\nThe remarkable effect of Adolescence’s one-shot approach The movie takes place over 13 months, and it was shot in one continuous take, heightening the feeling of drama on screen. “Basically, that means we press record on the camera and we don’t press stop until the very end of the hour,” Barantini says in the press notes. As part of weeks of rehearsals, Barantini and cinematographer Matt Lewis constructed miniature models of the set and moved miniature versions of the actors around so they could know exactly how to direct the camera every step of the way. “I really enjoyed it, and now I think I’ll always prefer it and I’d love to do one shot again,” Owen Cooper, 14, who played Jamie in his first film role, said in the press notes.\n\nOther actors also say that the one-shot approach brought them closer together. Doherty, who plays the psychologist, had never filmed in one shot before and said she and Cooper “felt vulnerable” and “the nerves bonded us.”\n\nStephen Graham as Eddie Miller, Christine Tremarco as Manda Miller, in Adolescence Courtesy of Netflix\n\nHow Adolescence ends The fourth and final episode moves a bit beyond Jamie and looks at how his detention affects his parents. It takes place on Jamie’s father Eddie’s birthday. But it’s not a happy day at all because Eddie wakes up to find the van for his plumbing business has been vandalized. His family tries to cheer him up on the way to the store to buy removal materials. A smile breaks out on his face when his wife (Christine Tremarco) gives her daughter Lisa (Amelie Pease) an overview of how they met.\n\nBut Eddie’s birthday gets worse when he gets a call from Jamie in prison on the ride back home. Jamie wanted to call to wish his dad a happy birthday and also to tell him that he is going to plead guilty to killing Katie, the first time viewers learn how he’s going to plead. Jamie only appears as a disembodied voice in the last episode.\n\nBack home, the parents go back and forth about what they could have done better as parents to prevent this situation—rehashing a conversation they have had many times since Jamie was taken away. Eddie repeatedly assures his wife that there is nothing they could have done better, that they couldn’t be watching him every minute. The episode ends with both parents in tears.",

        "source": "https://time.com/",
        "content": "The standoff at 1300 Pennsylvania Avenue was not much of a spectacle. On the first day of February, a handful of men working for Elon Musk had come to the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), a few blocks from the White House, demanding full access to its headquarters. The agency’s staff refused. No guns were drawn. No punches thrown. Nobody involved the police. But in these early days of the Trump Administration, perhaps no other scene revealed more clearly the forces reshaping America’s government.\n\nOn one side stood an institution with a 64-year history, a $35 billion budget, and a mission enshrined in federal law. On the other stood Musk’s political wrecking crew. They identified themselves as members of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), a collection of temporary staffers with no charter, no website, and no clear legal authority. Its power derives from Musk, the wealthiest person on the planet, who has been deputized to dismantle vast swaths of the federal bureaucracy—slashing budgets, gutting the civil service, and stripping independent agencies of the ability to impede the President’s objectives.\n\nUSAID leadership had allowed Musk’s team, a group of his young and eager followers, to spend several days inside their headquarters at the end of January. “The DOGE kids,” as some of the staffers called them in private, walked the halls with clipboards in their hands, examining desks and questioning managers, according to several USAID officials who described the events to TIME. But as the weekend arrived, their demands—including access to sensitive facilities designed to store classified information—went too far for the agency’s heads of security. The men from DOGE threatened to call the U.S. Marshals and have them clear the building. They also informed Musk about the problem. “USAID is a criminal organization,” Musk wrote to his 215 million followers on his social media platform, X, soon after. “Time for it to die.”\n\nThe cause of Musk’s crusade remained unclear. But regardless of the reason, by the following morning, an agency that annually disburses tens of billions of dollars across the globe, fighting famine and disease and bringing clean water to millions, had mostly ceased to function. Within a week, nearly all its staff were placed on leave, its offices around the world shut down.\n\nPhoto-Illustration by TIME (Source Photos: Chip Somodevilla—Getty Images; Anna Moneymaker—Getty Images)\n\nClick here to order your copy of this issue\n\nEvery other government bureau got the message loud and clear. No single private citizen, certainly not one whose wealth and web of businesses are directly subject to the oversight of federal authorities, has wielded such power over the machinery of the U.S. government. So far, Musk appears accountable to no one but President Trump, who handed his campaign benefactor a sweeping mandate to bring the government in line with his agenda. DOGE directed all of TIME’s questions about its work to the White House, which declined to comment.\n\nRead More: How Elon Musk Became a Kingmaker.\n\nAlready, the DOGE team has taken over the U.S. Digital Service and established a beachhead within the federal human-resources department, the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). The Education Department is on edge, fearing a self-decapitation mandate is in the offing. Few agencies seem safe. Musk has shown that he will tolerate no opposition, no matter how justified. Days before the drama at USAID, a Treasury official refused DOGE access to the U.S. federal payment system. The official was forced to retire, and the newly appointed Treasury Secretary, Scott Bessent, gave DOGE the access it demanded. The Administration agreed on Feb. 5 to restrict that access, at least temporarily, after a group of past and present employees sued.\n\nThese are just the first ripples in a massive antigovernment wave. Budgets will be hacked. Valuable programs will be eliminated. Career civil servants will be purged, replaced with political appointees whose primary qualification is apparent fealty to the President. This is the course the electorate chose. And to many, the idea of one of the world’s most accomplished entrepreneurs attacking a sprawling, sclerotic federal bureaucracy with the same velocity and determination he brought to his car startup or rocket company is cause for celebration, not alarm. “The federal government is so big that there are surely significant opportunities for saving and efficiency,” says Robert Doar, president of the American Enterprise Institute, a center-right think tank. “The fact that the President and his team is giving this a lot of attention is a good thing.”\n\nBut a public backlash may be growing to Musk’s mission, and far more is at stake than the size of the federal balance sheet, the head count at agencies inside the Beltway, or the dangers of one unelected man possessing such unconstrained power. Soon Americans are going to learn where they interact with the federal government in ways they didn’t realize or took for granted. Companies that export tech products to China may no longer have State or Commerce Department employees available to explain, for free, how to avoid violating criminal law. Farmers in the Midwest may soon find USAID-funded buyers no longer paying for sacks of flour to send to refugee camps. Around the world, millions of people who depend on the U.S. for food, medicine, and shelter are suddenly on their own.\n\nRead More: Why TIME Chose Musk As 2021 Person of the Year.\n\nFor now, millions of government workers find themselves at Musk’s mercy. One described her team at the Department of Homeland Security assuming a “defensive crouch” as they awaited a visit from the DOGE. For an inkling of their fate, she added, her colleagues had turned to a book called Character Limit, which chronicles the way Musk took over Twitter two years ago and fired 80% of its staff, often with chaotic and lasting results.\n\nThe similarities to his assault on the bureaucracy have been uncanny. On Jan. 28, millions of civil servants across government received an email offering them eight months’ pay in exchange for their resignation. Musk had proposed much the same deal to Twitter’s employees two years earlier. He even used the same subject line: “Fork in the road.”\n\nNone of this came without warning. Among Musk’s friends in Silicon Valley, many understood his takeover of Twitter as preparation for a greater cause. “The mood is that hopefully Musk can do the same thing with the U.S. government,” one told TIME in November. Veterans of Trump’s first Administration likewise laid out their plans long before the elections, publishing a 900-page report known as Project 2025. One of its lead authors, Russell Vought, said in a speech two years ago that he wanted civil servants to be “traumatically affected” by the purge he envisioned. “We want their funding to be shut,” he said. “We want to put them in trauma.”\n\nRussell Vought, Trump’s pick to lead the Office of Management and Budget, at a confirmation hearing on Jan. 15. Andrew Harnik—Getty Images\n\nOn the campaign trail, Trump swore he had nothing to do with the plan. “It was inappropriate that they would come out with a document like that,” he told TIME in November. “Some things I vehemently disagreed with.” But once in office, he picked Vought to be in charge of the White House Office of Management and Budget, which now works closely with Musk to enact crucial parts of Project 2025. So far, the frenetic opening moves of the Trump presidency have tracked nearly two-thirds of its prescriptions, according to a TIME analysis.\n\nMusk never hid his intentions. Two weeks after the election, he co-wrote a piece in the Wall Street Journal that promised DOGE would help Trump “hire a lean team of small-government crusaders,” who would work to bring “mass head-count reductions across the federal bureaucracy.” That recruitment drive began soon after the elections, drawing from Musk’s acolytes in Silicon Valley, some barely out of college, and priming them to fan out across Washington.\n\nRead More: Inside Elon Musk's Struggle For the Future of AI.\n\nThe man Musk put in charge of staffing at DOGE was an aerospace engineer named Steve Davis, who previously led his cost-cutting efforts at Twitter. In late December, as the presidential transition unfolded inside the White House, Davis took part in a series of meetings with members of the Biden Administration. The Democratic staffers noted his fixation with an obscure branch of the White House called the U.S. Digital Service. Davis wanted to know how it operated, who it reported to, and what it could access.\n\nCreated in 2014, the USDS works with federal agencies to improve computer systems and databases. It houses a map of the government’s technology infrastructure and has contact points for the technology officer at nearly every federal agency. That made it the perfect place to host the DOGE. If Musk wanted to wither the limbs of the federal government, the USDS provided the veins that would let the poison flow.\n\nThe empowerment of USDS started on Inauguration Day. One of Trump’s first Executive Orders renamed it “the United States DOGE Service,” neatly preserving the office’s acronym. The order also ensured that the new entity would report directly to the White House chief of staff. Since then, the office has set up shop inside the Departments of State and Treasury. It began accessing personnel computer systems, firing contractors, and blocking payments on their contracts.\n\nMusk also sent a team to OPM. The office holds records on 2.1 million workers, the email address for nearly every federal employee, and tracks $59 billion per year in federal health care premiums and $88 billion per year in payments to federal retirees. The mass buyout offer to government employees originated from within Musk’s team at OPM, according to a source familiar with those actions. (Both DOGE and the White House declined to comment.)\n\nRead More: As Musk's DOGE Targets Federal Data, This Obscure Office Is at the Center\n\nNext, the DOGE team set to starving OPM itself. Brian Bjelde, who recently worked as vice president of human resources at Musk’s aerospace firm, told career supervisors at OPM that the “target” was to slash 70% of its staff, a move that would hobble its health care benefits and retirement-planning teams, says a current OPM official. Some senior leaders at OPM have been locked out of key databases, the official says, and political appointees have access to systems, including the Enterprise Human Resources Integration, without standard safeguard procedures designed to keep such information private. That system includes information like pay grades, length of service, Social Security numbers, dates of birth, and home addresses.\n\nDays after Trump took office, the White House ordered a freeze on federal spending—from foreign aid to public-health programs, and everything in between. It would be lifted, the Administration said, as agencies fell in line with the President’s agenda: cracking down on immigration, ending diversity efforts, and stopping investments that reduce the impact of fossil fuels on the environment. Facing a court’s action, the White House rolled back the order.\n\nA protest outside the U.S. Treasury building in Washington, D.C., on Feb 4. Stefani Reynolds—Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nMusk’s downsizing pressed ahead, and Trump continued to give his blessing. “Elon can’t do—and won’t do—anything without our approval,” Trump told reporters in the Oval Office on Feb. 4. “We’ll give him the approval where appropriate,” he added. “Where not appropriate, we won’t.” Some took it as a sign that Trump might rein in his attack dog. But civil servants are not waiting around for that to happen. In Northern Virginia, home to tens of thousands of workers on the federal payroll and military service members, the typical town-hall meeting in the town of Leesburg attracts a few dozen people. Hundreds gathered on the night Musk shut down USAID. “We’re hearing bizarre stories,” says Representative Suhas Subramanyam, the local Democratic Congressman who spoke at the event. His office has been flooded with workers describing DOGE’s takeover, and he instructed his staff to log their testimony and assist whistle-blowers. Much of what they witnessed is “simply illegal,” Subramanyam insists to TIME. “We’re almost being tested and dared to sue or investigate.”\n\nRead More: Across Pennsylvania, Musk Deploys His Fame and Fortune For Trump.\n\nSome lawsuits have worked. The White House complied with court orders blocking its attempt to freeze trillions of dollars in federal spending. A judge’s ruling on Feb. 6 delayed the deadline for the buyout offer to government employees. Unions have filed suits related to DOGE on behalf of federal workers. Even Musk’s usual admirers have warned he is overreaching. “The lawsuits are already flying,” a Feb. 4 Wall Street Journal editorial noted, “and courts will derail Mr. Musk’s project before it even gets off the ground if he isn’t careful.”\n\nOn Capitol Hill, Musk’s assault on the bureaucracy has set up a battle with Democrats that could determine the future of the government and the balance of power within it. “We don’t have a fourth branch of government called Elon Musk,” Maryland Democrat Jamie Raskin told a crowd outside USAID on the afternoon of Feb. 3, while the men from DOGE tried to impose their demands inside.\n\nRaskin was right. But the agency staffers listening to him on Pennsylvania Avenue, unsure of whether they still had a job, could not tell how much power Musk had acquired, and whether he would bend the other branches of government to his will. One staffer seemed especially skeptical. Yes, she told TIME, the Constitution grants Congress the power of the purse. But Musk had shown his power to yank it away.\n\n“There’s only so much Democrats can do,” she said, not wanting to give her name lest it attract more attention from DOGE. Her official email account had been shut down, and she could no longer access her desk at the agency. Like thousands of her colleagues, and millions of Americans, she was left to watch Musk’s moves play out, wondering how far he would go, and what, if anything, could stop him. —With reporting by Eric Cortellessa, Philip Elliott, Nik Popli, and Tessa Berenson Rogers/Washington",

        "content": "Severe thunderstorms intensified and impacted much of the Midwest region on Friday and into Saturday, with more instances of extreme weather expected throughout the weekend. In an update shared on Saturday morning, the National Weather Service warned that an \"outbreak of tornadoes and severe thunderstorms [are] expected over parts of the Deep South and Tennessee Valley today into tonight.\" With a vast swath of the U.S. experiencing extreme weather, and storm warnings in place across various states, American Red Cross and other organizations are encouraging people to prepare themselves.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n“If you're prepared in advance, you're going to be more comfortable to respond when an emergency does happen. You'll be in the know of what needs to get done,” Stephanie Fox, media relations lead at American Red Cross, tells TIME. Amid rising concerns, here are the best ways to prepare for a storm. Secure your home Before a storm, try to trim trees and cut down branches near your home. By removing branches that are likely to break or fall during a storm, you can prevent them from damaging homes, vehicles, power lines, or causing injuries. Further, it can help prevent a tree from becoming uprooted and falling during a storm, and makes the cleanup post-storm less chaotic. Beyond trees outside the home, the National Weather Service suggests that those preparing for a storm “secure loose objects, close windows and doors, and move any valuable objects inside or under a sturdy structure.” Effort to stay updated\n\nThose within an affected-area of a severe storm can stay updated with the forecasted storm, its intensity and movement through multiple avenues, whether that be through NOAA Weather Radio, The Emergency Alert System (EAS), or their local weather channel. Oftentimes, communities have specific ways to send warnings, from outdoor sirens to alerts via smartphones. By learning how your community alerts residents to severe incoming weather—including warnings for storms and tornados tornados—you can make sure you stay updated in real-time. Fox notes that people need to make sure their updates do not just go off during the day, but at night too. “People don't always consider that they need to have something that's going to wake them up,” she says, adding that the NOAA Weather Radio is programmed to emit “a very loud buzzing noise that will absolutely wake up a household in the event that a warning is issued.”\n\nClean your gutters During a storm, you want your gutters to move as much water as possible, as easily as possible. The best way to ensure this is to clean your gutters prior to the storm hitting, in order to prevent water build-up during the weather event—at which point it likely wouldn’t be safe to go outside and clear any blockages. Water build-up can cause damage to home roofs, and create leaks and structural damage to your home.\n\nA man cleans his house gutters before a storm comes.

A disaster supply kit includes basic items that your household may need.\n\nAccording to Ready.gov, a national public service campaign formed by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) dedicated to educating Americans to prepare for and mitigate emergencies, a disaster kit should include water, food, a flashlight, a first aid kit, a mask, garbage bags, a whistle, a can opener, a cell phone with extra chargers and batteries, and more. You can read the full list here. After assembling the kit, Ready.gov recommends keeping canned food in a dry place and storing boxed food in tightly closed plastic or metal containers in order to ensure they remain edible, should a severe weather event or disaster strike. They also recommend keeping a kit in your car, in case you ever become stranded. Per Fox, it’s vital to have a “stay-at-home kit” that allows a household to navigate about two weeks in the house under emergency circumstances, and then a “to-go kit” that people can use if they have to evacuate, which should have enough resources to cover three-to-five days.\n\nLightning brightens the night sky as storms continue to cross the region on Aug. 23, 2024 near Shiprock, New Mexico. David McNew—Getty Images\n\nLocate the nearest shelter According to the CDC, one way to prepare yourself in the event of severe thunderstorms is to locate your nearest shelters ahead of time and map out the safest routes to reach them. “If [people] live in mobile homes or campers, those are not safe when we get these types of outbreaks,” Fox says. “So it's really important for folks to identify if they have a community shelter. Maybe they can visit friends or family overnight.” The idea is to be out of harm’s way when the peak of the threat is expected. According to Randy Bowers, meteorologist at the National Weather Service, this also means planning for which room in your shelter or home will best protect you in the event of a bad storm—especially as large hail storms mean people should stay away from windows.\n\n“[The safest room] is usually the lower floor of your house. If you have a basement, that's ideal. But if you don't, then [aim for] the lower floor in an interior room,” he says. “The idea is to put as many walls between you and the weather outside as you possibly can, and to stay away from windows.” Make your pets a part of the plan If you have animals or pets, Fox says that they should be embedded in your family’s emergency plan. Make sure their carriers and leashes are accessible, so that when a severe storm—or other emergency— hits, pets can be evacuated with ease, if needed. “If they have any prescription medications, make sure you have an extra supply in your emergency kit—extra food, toys, just anything that your pet may need if you have to be confined to your home for a period of time, or if you have to evacuate,” she says. Fox also recommends making sure that pets are kept inside during storms, in case they get “spooked” by thunder and try to run away.\n\nConsider buying surge protectors\n\nAccording to FEMA’s preparedness sheet for thunderstorms, lightning, and hail, buying surge protectors, lightning rods, or a lightning protection system can help protect your home’s appliances and electronic devices in the event of lightning strikes during the storm.\n\nBowers says this can be a part of a “long-term plan,” and is something to think about especially if you currently live in, or are moving to, an area prone to storms.",

        "content": "WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. — President Donald Trump said he ordered a series of airstrikes on Yemen's capital, Sanaa, on Saturday, promising to use “overwhelming lethal force” until Iranian-backed Houthi rebels cease their attacks on shipping along a vital maritime corridor. “Our brave Warfighters are right now carrying out aerial attacks on the terrorists’ bases, leaders, and missile defenses to protect American shipping, air, and naval assets, and to restore Navigational Freedom,” Trump said in a social media post. “No terrorist force will stop American commercial and naval vessels from freely sailing the Waterways of the World.”\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nHe also warned Iran to stop supporting the rebel group, promising to hold the country “fully accountable” for the actions of its proxy. It comes two weeks after the U.S leader sent a letter to Iranian leaders offering a path to restarting bilateral talks between the two countries on Iran’s advancing nuclear weapons program that Trump has said he will not allow to become operational. The Houthis reported a series of explosions in their territory Saturday evening. Images circulating online show plumes of black smoke over the area of the Sanaa airport complex, which includes a sprawling military facility. The airstrikes come a few days after the Houthis said they would resume attacks on Israeli vessels sailing in waters off Yemen in response to Israel’s blockade on Gaza. There have been no Houthi attacks reported since then. Earlier this month, Israel halted all aid coming into Gaza and warned of “additional consequences” for Hamas if their fragile ceasefire in the war isn’t extended as negotiations continue over starting a second phase.\n\nThe Houthis had described their warning as taking hold in the Red Sea, the Gulf of Aden, the Bab el-Mandeb Strait and the Arabian Sea. The Houthis targeted over 100 merchant vessels with missiles and drones, sinking two vessels and killing four sailors, during their campaign targeting military and civilian ships between the start of the war between Israel and Hamas in late 2023 and January of this year, when a tenuous ceasefire in Gaza took effect. The attacks greatly raised the Houthis’ profile as they faced economic problems and launched a crackdown targeting any dissent and aid workers at home amid Yemen’s decade-long stalemated war that’s torn apart the Arab world’s poorest nation. The United States, Israel and Britain have previously hit Houthi-held areas in Yemen. Israel’s military declined to comment. The Houthi media office said the U.S. strikes hit “a residential neighborhood” in Sanaa’s northern district of Shouab. Sanaa residents said at least four airstrikes rocked the Eastern Geraf neighborhood in Shouab district, terrifying women and children in the area.\n\n“The explosions were very strong,” said Abdallah al-Alffi. “It was like an earthquake.” The Saturday operation against the Houthis was conducted solely by the U.S., according to a U.S. official. It was the first strike on the Yemen-based Houthis under the second Trump administration, and it comes after a period of relative quiet in the region. Such broad-based and pre-planned missile strikes against the Houthis were done multiple times by the Biden administration in response to frequent attacks by the Houthis against commercial and military vessels in the region. The USS Harry S. Truman carrier strike group, which includes the carrier, three Navy destroyers and one cruiser, are in the Red Sea and were part of the mission. The USS Georgia cruise missile submarine has also been operating in the region. Trump announced the strikes as he spent the day at his Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach, Florida.\n\n“These relentless assaults have cost the U.S. and World Economy many BILLIONS of Dollars while, at the same time, putting innocent lives at risk,” Trump said.\n\n—Baldor reported from Washington and Magdy reported from Cairo.

        "content": "This article is part of The D.C. Brief, TIME’s politics newsletter. Sign up here to get stories like this sent to your inbox. The Senate’s move Friday to avoid a government shutdown—essentially ceding spending power to President Donald Trump and downgrading Congress to an advisory role—was an epic climbdown that is rightfully sending the Democrats’ base into a spiral. The rage among Democrats trained on one figure: Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York, who signaled a day earlier that the fight was over and it was time to move on. The choice was to hold open the doors of a scaled-down government or to slam it closed on what stood before, and the outcome tells the story.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nThat does not mean anyone in the party was happy about how this went down. Asked Friday if it was time for a new Leadership team for Senate Democrats, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries declined to throw Schumer a life preserver. \"Next question,\" Jeffries said. In other spaces, there was an open talk of primarying Schumer when he is next on the ballot in 2028. Nine Senate Democrats—and Independent Angus King of Maine who caucuses with them—joined all but one Senate Republican on Friday to sidestep a government shutdown. The stopgap spending plan gives the White House a freer hand to shutter dozens of federal functions created by Congress and eliminate thousands of jobs. Congress, at least through Sept. 30, is in effect legislating a stronger executive branch that can basically do anything with the money lawmakers release. It was a crap ending to what’s been a crap week for Democrats, frankly. On top of all of the chaos unfurling from the Trump White House by way of new executive orders, hires, fires, and tariffs, they have also had to face this ticking clock of a government shutdown. House Republicans jammed Democrats with a party-line spending plan that is especially heinous in its cuts to the District of Columbia. Then, the House ditched town, giving the Senate zero say to tweak the spending. Then, Schumer on Wednesday asserted the framework had insufficient support to get across the finish line. And, then, a day later, he said he would support the spending structure to block a shutdown.\n\nThe whiplash from the shut-it-down to keep-it-alive posturing only fed the contempt that many Democrats were already harboring toward their current leaders. “Whatever happens will happen,” said Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island, who was a “no” vote and used the hours ahead of the votes to telegraph a dark fatalism. That resignation has been bleeding through Washington in recent weeks. The fight among anti-Trumpers of all stripes has faded in recent days as Trump’s brazen conquest of the spending system was looking increasingly inevitable. The chest-thumping celebrations in the White House and the antics of its pet-project DOGE intersected to rile up Democrats, who have been trying to defend all corners of the federal cogs. Ultimately, though, the Democrats in a position to thwart Trump and his GOP allies caved. Republicans have majorities in the House and Senate, plus control of the White House. But Senate rules require 60 votes to get balls rolling, and Republicans had just 52 yes votes in the Upper Chamber. That meant GOP lawmakers needed to get eight converts among Democrats.\n\nSenate Democrats looked at the math, polling, and their own talents. They made the call that the mismatch of their desire to oppose Trump’s unilateral power grab did not match their ability to actually stop it. Poli-sci nerds will tell you that actual power lies at the point where will and capacity are synced up. Democrats had the power to shut down the government but lacked the bandwidth to sell it as the other guys’ fault, or put forth a unified plan on how to reopen the government on better terms. The problem now lies with how Democrats deal with the Schumer sitch. They are very, very quiet at the moment, but there are the faintest of rumblings about whether Schumer gets to hold his position as Minority Leader for the balance of this term. Progressive and rank-and-file corners of the party alike were uneasy about this call, and steering this unruly ship into 2026 is a job that is not something to be taken lightly.\n\nTo be clear: Schumer is not at risk of being deposed in short order, and Democrats do not carry House Republicans’ appetite for cannibalizing their own. Schumer acts on calculations, not confidences. His decision to side with keeping the government open at the expense of legislative branch power came from a place of rationality, not rashness. But it still carried costs, and the first among them was his standing with frustrated Democrats who want the opposition party to do its job: to oppose an administration hellbent on dismantling a government it holds in sheer contempt.\n\nGovernment, for the moment, survives. Democrats, for the foreseeable future, find their ability to check Trump diminished. And, until Congress reverses itself, the legislative branch takes a secondary role to the executive.\n\nMake sense of what matters in Washington. Sign up for the D.C. Brief newsletter.",

        "source": "https://time.com/",
        "content": "The three gold medals that sprinter Gabby Thomas won at the Paris Olympics last summer are currently resting in what is, she says, their proper place: her sock drawer. She’s stuck her silver and bronze from Tokyo in there too.\n\nThomas, 28, is in no rush to build any sort of living-room shrine to her athletic accomplishments. “The medals are truly just objects for me,” she says. “I don't look at them and genuinely feel like, ‘Oh my God, those are so cool.’” One day, she may enjoy staring at all that precious metal, as a reminder of past glories. But now is not that time. “I genuinely feel like I'm not done yet,” says Thomas. “I’m still on my journey. I'm still in that process. I have so many more to come.”\n\nPlus, her life is more than mere medals. When her track career comes to a close, Thomas has designs on leading a nonprofit organization like Austin’s Volunteer Healthcare Clinic, where she has helped manage fellow workers, interacted with patients—many of whom are uninsured and live in underserved Latino communities—and arranged for one of her sponsors, New Balance, to donate shoes. “What I do now only fuels that thought,” says Thomas, who wrote her master’s thesis at the University of Texas about racial disparities in sleep epidemiology, after majoring in neurobiology and global health as a Harvard undergrad. “We see the difference that we make in the community. We are, in fact, bridging that racial health disparity gap, which is really important to me.”\n\nOne woman who received new footwear at the clinic last spring was moved to tears and shared with Thomas that she was going through some personal turmoil. “It felt like somebody was looking out for her,” says Thomas. “You feel alone and you're in a dark place, and something so small can make a big difference.”\n\nAfter the Paris Olympics, where Thomas won the 200 m and pair of relay golds in the 4x100 and 4x400, she headlined Athlos NYC, a female-only track event backed by Reddit co-founder and venture capitalist Alexis Ohanian. Athlos doled out a record prize purse, including $60,000 for the winner of each of the six sprint and middle-distance races. Thomas finished second in the 200 m. Megan Thee Stallion provided the post-race entertainment. “It was a great cultural moment for us,” says Thomas. “Because when you actually look at who's running track and field, most of us are Black women. And we had an event that really celebrated that.”\n\nOver these past few months, Thomas has also appeared on the cover of Vogue, snapped a picture with Rihanna at an awards show, attended Fashion Week, and served as grand marshal of the New York City Marathon. Now she’s training for the upcoming season, which includes the debut of Grand Slam Track, a new league founded by legendary sprinter Michael Johnson, likely another Athlos event, and world championships, where she’ll aim to win her first individual gold. These commitments have forced her to step away from her management role at the clinic, although she still regularly checks in on patients.\n\nGoing into the next Olympic cycle, Thomas has started strong off the blocks. “The gold medals, while they do add pressure, have given me a lot of confidence, have truly showed me what I'm capable of,” says Thomas. “So I'm definitely looking forward to the next couple of years. The fact that LA 2028 is in America, in my home country, I just don't think it could be wrapped more beautifully for me.”",

        "title": "Why Imposter Syndrome Isn’t a Personal Flaw",
        "source": "https://time.com/",
        "content": "Dunn, a former practicing attorney, professor, and nonprofit executive, is a consultant focusing on systemic equity, diversity, and inclusion. She is the author of Qualified: How Competency Checking and Race Collide at Work\n\nThe term “imposter syndrome” has become a cultural shorthand for self-doubt. We’re told it’s something to fix within ourselves: a nagging belief that we’re unqualified or unworthy, even when all evidence points to the contrary. Yet for many women—and especially women of color—this framing misses the mark entirely.\n\nIn reality, what’s labeled as imposter syndrome in the workplace is often a misdiagnosis—a symptom of systemic inequities. It’s a response to environments steeped in bias, exclusion, and relentless scrutiny of the competence of women, Black professionals, and other people of color, a practice known as “competency checking.” Competency checking—whether intentional or unconscious—undermines those who challenge traditional norms of leadership and success. Imposter syndrome, however, masquerades as an internal failing, leading women to pathologize themselves rather than confront the systems perpetuating their struggles.\n\nThis misidentification was never clearer to me than during a conversation with a prospective client—a white woman—about a keynote speech on imposter syndrome. I explained my view: imposter syndrome is a catch-all term that obscures the real culprits—sexism, racism, and white supremacy. It can set up women to blame themselves for what is actually persistent, systemic competency checking.\n\nThe woman was visibly taken aback. She said that none of the consultants she had spoken with framed the issue this way, and one consultant had even claimed that “Everyone has imposter syndrome, and anyone who says they don’t is a liar or a narcissist.” This reductive and harmful framing shocked me. Imposter syndrome isn’t recognized as a psychiatric disorder; it’s not listed in the DSM-5 or the International Classification of Diseases. Yet the notion that everyone suffers from it has become pervasive.\n\nRead More: Yes, Impostor Syndrome Is Real. Here’s How to Deal With It\n\nI explained to her that feelings of self-doubt and uncertainty are part of being human. But these feelings differ from the systemic barriers and biases that create environments where women—and especially women of color—are made to feel unworthy. Black women, for instance, often reject the idea that they are imposters. Instead, they focus on the challenges of working within systems not designed for their success. This difference in perception can create friction with white women, who may frame these struggles through a lens of personal failings, a narrative that imposter syndrome encourages.\n\nCiting global inclusion strategist Ruchika Malhotra and writer Jodi-Ann Burey’s Harvard Business Review article “Stop Telling Women They Have Imposter Syndrome,” I emphasized that self-doubt often reflects a rational response to systemic bias. As Malhotra and Burey put it, “Impostor syndrome directs our view toward fixing women at work instead of fixing the places where women work.”\n\nUnmasking the villain\n\nI often use a metaphor inspired by Scooby-Doo to explain this dynamic. In every episode, Scooby and the gang unmask a ghostly villain, revealing it to be someone using fear to hide their schemes. Imposter syndrome is a similar mask, obscuring systemic inequities that fuel self-doubt. Once the mask is removed, the real question is: How did we get here, and why do so many—particularly white women—believe the ghost is real?\n\nThe origins of the term “impostor phenomenon,” coined in 1978, offer clues. Psychologists Pauline Rose Clance and Suzanne Imes described the experiences of 178 predominantly white, upper-middle-class women who felt intellectually fraudulent despite their achievements. The study framed their feelings as internal failings rather than responses to external pressures, such as patriarchy and white supremacy, which drive perfectionism. It overlooked the realities of sexism, classism, and racism—and the complex interplay of these forces.\n\nIf the study had included women of color, working-class white women, or others excluded from its narrow lens, it might have painted a different picture. Take Crystal Lee Sutton, the real-life inspiration for the movie Norma Rae. In 1978, when Sutton stopped her work and famously stood up on a table in the mill to protest the impact of unchecked capitalism, sexism, and racism on the poor and working-class women who worked there, she didn’t hold up a sign saying she felt like an imposter; she held up a sign that said “UNION.”\n\nThere must have been days when Sutton felt uncertain or even like a fraud—not because of a clinical disorder but because she was human. Yet she identified the real culprit: The systemic exploitation of working poor women. Sutton understood that change required building a coalition of white and Black women to challenge the status quo. She correctly identified the external factors—and fought back with the right medicine: solidarity.\n\nReimagining the solution\n\nTo move beyond imposter syndrome, we must reframe it as a systemic issue rather than an individual failing. Workplaces must become environments where microaggressions, implicit bias, and inequitable opportunities are actively dismantled. Women must recognize that self-doubt often reflects competency checking, not their actual abilities.\n\nSolidarity is crucial. Women of all backgrounds must come together to challenge the status quo, building coalitions that center the experiences of the most marginalized. Organizations, too, must reassess how they evaluate candidates for hiring and promotion: Are hidden biases baked into the criteria used to measure competence? And how do these biases disproportionately affect women and people of color?\n\nMoving toward collective action\n\nImposter syndrome thrives in isolation, convincing women that they alone are flawed. But the solution lies in collective action. By addressing the systemic roots of competency checking, we can create workplaces where self-doubt doesn’t hinder potential, and no one is punished for their confidence or ambition.\n\nWhite women must recognize that their successes and burdens are intertwined with those of women of color. The fight against competency checking isn’t just about individual self-improvement; it’s a call to dismantle the systems of oppression that undermine all women in the workplace.\n\nIn the wake of the great DEI surge of 2020–2021 and the current collapse and retreat from creating more equitable workplaces, women of color—and particularly Black women—find themselves under attack, and in desperate need of support from true allies. To move forward, we must unmask the real villains and build a future grounded in solidarity, equity, and shared power.\n\nFrom the book QUALIFIED: How Competency Checking and Race Collide at Work by Shari Dunn.

        "source": "https://time.com/",
        "content": "If you can’t spend an hour or two with Colman Domingo in real life, you can still find the key to his spirit—the sense of the joy he both draws from the world and puts back into it—in a family photograph from Easter 1976. There’s Colman at age 6, a pint-size gent perched between his older sister and brother, wearing a candy-striped blazer so groovy you wouldn’t be surprised to see it on Sammy Davis Jr. at a Cocoanut Grove show. Elegant and poised, he gazes straight at the camera, his legs crossed just so. He brought this picture along when he appeared on The View in late November, and after the show’s hosts had finished cooing over its adorableness, he provided the backstory: The navy pants he’s wearing in the photo had a matching jacket, but it was too small. He grabbed the striped one instead, though his mother observed that it didn’t quite match. “But it makes me feel good!” he told her, and instead of arguing, she told him, “Wear what makes you feel good,” setting him on the path he follows to this day.\n\nDomingo, now 55, is known for his creative yet classic red-carpet style, inspired by influences ranging from Fred Astaire to the Ohio Players, Cary Grant to Harold Melvin & the Blue Notes—it makes perfect sense that he’s been named one of the chairs of this spring’s Met Gala, the theme of which is “Superfine: Tailoring Black Style.” Style is integral to Domingo’s spirit, as a way of communicating, of pushing out into the world, of connecting with Black men and women who came before him—which is to say that anyone who believes style is superficial hasn’t met Domingo. How he dresses, how he moves, even how he sips from a coffee cup: all these things are so casually entwined with who he is—as a performer, certainly, but also as a writer, director, producer, and, just generally speaking, a person who’s alive to the world—that they charge the air around him.\n\nGenerosity begins with the self, and Domingo is so at ease that he has extra grace to spare. In a politically and emotionally precarious world, where people seem to have stopped caring for one another, those molecules of grace are like gold. “Everything I do is about radical love,” Domingo says, over a coffee at the Chelsea Hotel in New York City. “It's about seeing each other. What am I doing as a creative? It's about getting people to think, maybe helping people think differently. You know, that's all I can do. The macro I can't take care of. But I can take care of the micro.”\n\nPhotograph by Campbell Addy for TIME\n\nClick here to order your copy of this issue\n\nDomingo has earned a Best Actor Academy Award nomination for his superb performance in Sing Sing, Greg Kwedar’s drawn-from-real-life film about men who find redemption through a prison theater program. This is Domingo’s second nomination in as many years: he was also recognized for his turn, both charming and fiery, as civil rights activist Bayard Rustin in George C. Wolfe’s 2023 biopic Rustin. (He’s the first actor to be nominated two years in a row since Denzel Washington, who earned nods for Fences, in 2017, and Roman J. Israel, Esq., the following year.) He’s the anchor of Netflix’s multipart thriller The Madness, in which he plays a media pundit who stumbles into a murder plot in the woods of the Poconos. And the projects he’s got going, for 2025 and beyond, stack far into the sky: He plays patriarch Joe Jackson in Antoine Fuqua’s upcoming Michael Jackson biopic and stars in Tina Fey’s upcoming series The Four Seasons, a reimagining of Alan Alda’s 1981 comedy. He’s ready to direct and star in a Nat King Cole biopic he’s written, and to direct a drama about the romance between Sammy Davis Jr. and Kim Novak too.\n\nBut even if the spotlight around Domingo now seems particularly bright, he has in fact been everywhere for a while now: In the early 2000s he splashed out in Broadway shows like Passing Strange and The Scottsboro Boys, garnering a Tony nomination for the latter. In 2022 he won a Primetime Emmy for his recurring role in Euphoria. Moviegoers know him from pictures like Lincoln, Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom, Zola, and The Color Purple.\n\nStill, after working as one sort of performer or another for some 35 years, he’s grateful for—and more than a little surprised at—all the extra attention he’s gotten in the past five years or so. “How can I say it? I did not intend for this at all. I wanted to be a respected actor, and I found my work as a character actor mostly in the theater. I feel like that's where I was most useful, and that's where I was best being served.” As he began to take more television roles, opportunities began shifting. “It felt like the roles were meeting me and I was meeting the roles.” Now, he knows exactly how fortunate he is, and he’s also in a place where he can effect change for others. “I’m like, ‘Oooh, I get to have an impact? What can I do? What can I disrupt?’” He laughs, a great, sonorous laugh that sounds as if it could have rolled in from the ocean, even though Domingo was born and grew up in West Philly. “That's what I want to do, and really do it in the most loving, gracious, generous way possible.”\n\n****\n\nOne of Domingo’s early gigs was as a “party starter” for bar mitzvahs, getting recalcitrant guests out on the dance floor. Though he has no formal dance training, he moves through the world on springy, lily-stem legs, and it’s hard to imagine Mrs. Rosensweig, or anyone, resisting his effervescence. But given the way he carries himself in every interaction, it’s likely Domingo offered something else too: not just charm and fancy footwork but safety, the feeling that, if you join him, he’ll have your back.\n\nFor his appearance on The View, he invited his two nieces—one is actually a family friend, but he considers her family—to hang out in the greenroom with him beforehand and later watch the show from the audience. And to observe him with family—or even the small cadre of assistants on hand to make the day go smoothly—is to see a man who doesn’t think twice before opening a door for others, literally or figuratively. It’s not only fun to be around him, but almost calming—as if he were looking after the welfare of everyone in his orbit, even amid all the demands that come with being a hardworking performer and, now, a truly famous person.\n\nHis friends seem to feel that way too. Writer-director-actor Bradley Cooper met Domingo when the two found themselves on the awards circuit last year, Cooper for his Leonard Bernstein biopic Maestro and Domingo for Rustin. “I think it was like a CAA party after the Golden Globes or something,” Cooper says by phone from New York. “I went up to him, and we had a wonderful conversation. He was just a luminous human being.” The two exchanged numbers and have since built a friendship. Domingo says Cooper has been a great sounding board for his Nat King Cole project; Cooper demurs—he doesn’t think he’s helped that much—but he values having a friend he can talk to about projects that matter. “It's always nice to talk to somebody who's going down or has gone down a similar path,” he says, “and whenever he wants to talk about anything, I would just share my experience and things that I've learned and need to work on, or want to work on. Anytime he's asked me something, I actually feel privileged that he even wants my input.” Cooper is also, simply, happy to have found a true friend. “As you get older, you tend not to make new friends. But I made a new friend, which is kind of wonderful. And he allows that space to be a friend to somebody, which is beautiful.”\n\nColman Domingo photographed in London on Jan. 19 Campbell Addy for TIME\n\nDomingo, like Cooper, has ideas to spare. He’s eager to take on bigger and more ambitious projects—more disruption of the loving, gracious, generous kind. But like lots of successful people, he’s earned his self-assurance day-by-day. He never thought the career he has now was a sure thing. “I'm happy that I'm being met in this moment on my terms, in the way that I wanted to be seen. I didn't have to become some kind of other artist, who has to leave parts of themselves behind. I bring all of me into it. I bring all my years as a theater practitioner, as a director, as a writer, as a producer. Even when the industry wanted me to just pick one.”\n\nBy showcasing his talent across film and TV, Domingo has broadened his scope in a way that allows him to share the wealth. All through 2024, as studio and streaming execs balked at greenlighting risky or ambitious projects—even as many who make their living in TV and movies were still scrambling to recover not just from the pandemic, but from the actors’ and writers’ strikes—the motto of many who’d seen work dry up was “Survive till ‘25.” And that was before so many lost their homes in the horrific Los Angeles wildfires. (Domingo’s house, in Malibu, was spared.) So while he’s riding high, he’s using his career not just to gain recognition for himself but also to help determine which stories get told. In other words, it isn’t just about climbing higher; it’s about lifting others.\n\nHis involvement with Sing Sing, as both an actor and an executive producer, is a case in point. When he signed on to play John “Divine G” Whitfield—a man, wrongly imprisoned, who finds a lifeline in the performing arts—director and co-writer Kwedar, along with the film’s other writers and producers, suggested a parity model in which everyone involved would be paid the same rate. Domingo loved the idea. “My heart just opened. I don’t know if it works for every project. But I think there are elements of it that can work, especially when it comes to low-budget features. You're doing it because you love it, and you want to be a part of it.” And when the project succeeds, everyone benefits, not just a few people at the top. “I think that's just fair,” Domingo says. “So when we did sell the movie to A24, the most beautiful thing was to know the checks were being written out to every single department, and every person. That felt so good and so meaningful, especially right now, when the industry is having an existential crisis. This model can help be a game changer, so that everyone feels respected.”\n\nColman Domingo photographed in London on Jan. 19 Campbell Addy for TIME\n\nDomingo’s Sing Sing co-star, Clarence Maclin, is a veteran of the real-life prison program that inspired the film, Rehabilitation Through the Arts, and one of the many formerly incarcerated men who have roles in the movie. He plays a version of himself, a man whose capacity for growth expands when he becomes involved with the program. Maclin, who’d gotten his acting training at Sing Sing, with its terrible acoustics and, as he puts it, “sucky sound system,” knew how to project; Domingo helped him tailor his performance to the intimacy of the camera lens. But what Maclin took from their collaboration goes beyond mere tips about technique. “He’s the genuine article when it comes to someone who definitely is going to be there, someone who means what they say about what they want to do and what their intentions are,” Maclin says via Zoom. “The things I want to be, I see in him already, and it's like a guide.”\n\nThe idea, as Maclin clearly gets, is that living in the world means so much more than looking out for No. 1. We need to focus on what connects us rather than divides us. I met with Domingo three weeks after the election, at a time when many were still feeling stunned—and more than a little helplessly frozen—by the results. As a gay Black man, one who stands up for the people and causes he cares about, he knows the road ahead might be bumpy. But when he woke up on Nov. 6, he didn’t panic. Instead, “I thought, OK, this is where we are.” Again, he vibrates with so much radiant energy that it’s impossible to feel hopeless around him. A conversation with him leaves you with the feeling that he’s handing you a key; it’s up to you to find the right door to open, but you know you can do it, even if you’re not a spectacular-looking six-foot-plus movie star who moves through every space—and the world—with lanky, liquid grace. “The pendulum does swing,” he says. “My parents went through a lot, my grandparents went through even worse. And I am here, where I am in my life, but also as a proud descendant of slaves who lived, loved, and fought, and sacrificed, so I could be here. So I can't hold my head down and be sad or despondent about anything. I have to roll up my sleeves to continue to get to work: Fight, love, be joyful in a very revolutionary way.”\n\nThis is how you honor those who came before you while also opening a corridor for everyone who will follow. This is how you get the party started.\n\nSet design by Ibby Njoya; styling by Ola Ebiti; grooming by Mata Mariélle; production by Ragi Dholakia Productions; retouching by Touch Digital",

        "content": "The threat of violent tornadoes in parts of the U.S. proved deadly as well as destructive as whipping winds moved east into the Mississippi Valley and Deep South on Saturday, with at least 17 people killed and scores of homes decimated. The most fatalities as of Saturday morning were in Missouri, authorities said, which was lashed by twisters overnight that resulted in at least 11 deaths. The Missouri State Highway Patrol also reported that multiple people were injured.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nThe deaths included a man who was killed after a tornado ripped apart his home, “It was unrecognizable as a home. Just a debris field,\" said Coroner Jim Akers of Butler County, describing the scene that confronted rescuers when they arrived. “The floor was upside down. We were walking on walls.\" Rescuers managed to save a woman in the home, Akers said. Read More: How to Prepare for a Storm, According to Experts Officials in Arkansas said on Saturday morning that three people died in Independence County and 29 others were injured across eight counties as storms passed through the state overnight. “We have teams out surveying the damage from last night’s tornadoes and have first responders on the ground to assist,” Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders said on X. “In the meantime, I just released $250,000 from our Disaster Recovery fund to provide resources for this operation for each of the impacted communities.”\n\nOn Friday, meanwhile, authorities said three people were killed in car crashes during a dust storm in Amarillo in the Texas Panhandle. The deaths come as a massive storm system moving across the country unleashed winds that triggered deadly dust storms and fanned more than 100 wildfires. Extreme weather conditions — including hurricane-force winds — are forecast to affect an area home to more than 100 million people. Winds gusting up to 80 mph (130 kph) were predicted from the Canadian border to Texas, threatening blizzard conditions in colder northern areas and wildfire risk in warmer, drier areas to the south. Evacuations were ordered in some Oklahoma communities as more than 130 fires were reported across the state. Nearly 300 homes have been damaged or destroyed in Oklahoma due to fire. Gov. Kevin Stitt said at a Saturday news conference that some 266 square miles (about 69 hectares) have burned so far in his state.\n\nThe State Patrol said winds were so strong that they toppled several tractor-trailers. “This is terrible out here,” said Charles Daniel, a truck driver hauling a 48-foot (14.6-meter) trailer along Interstate 40 in western Oklahoma. “There’s a lot of sand and dirt in the air. I’m not pushing it over 55 mph. I’m scared it will blow over if I do.” Experts say it's not unusual to see such weather extremes in March. Tornadoes hit amid storm outbreak The Storm Prediction Center said fast-moving storms could spawn twisters and hail as large as baseballs on Saturday, but the greatest threat would come from straight-line winds near or exceeding hurricane force, with gusts of 100 mph (160 kph) possible. Significant tornadoes, some of which could be long-track and violent, are expected Saturday afternoon and evening. The region at highest risk stretches from eastern Louisiana and Mississippi in the afternoon and then Alabama and western portions of Georgia and the Florida panhandle in the evening, the Center said.\n\nWildfires break out amid dry, gusty conditions Apart from Oklahoma, wildfires elsewhere in the Southern Plains threatened to spread rapidly amid warm, dry weather and strong winds in Texas, Kansas, Missouri and New Mexico. A blaze in Roberts County, Texas, northeast of Amarillo, quickly blew up from less than a square mile (about 2 square kilometers) to an estimated 32.8 square miles (85 square kilometers), the Texas A&M University Forest Service said on X. Crews stopped its advance by Friday evening. About 60 miles (90 kilometers) to the south, another fire grew to about 3.9 square miles (10 square kilometers) before its advance was halted in the afternoon. High winds also knocked out power to more than 260,000 homes and businesses in Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Missouri, Illinois and Indiana, according the website poweroutage.us. Blizzard warnings in Northern Plains The National Weather Service issued blizzard warnings for parts of far western Minnesota and far eastern South Dakota starting early Saturday. Snow accumulations of 3 to 6 inches (7.6 to 15.2 centimeters) were expected, with up to a foot (30 centimeters) possible.\n\nWinds gusting to 60 mph (97 kph) were expected to cause whiteout conditions.\n\n—Shipkowski reported from Toms River, New Jersey.

        "source": "https://time.com/",
        "content": "WASHINGTON — An appeals court on Friday lifted a block on executive orders seeking to end government support for diversity, equity and inclusion programs, handing the Trump administration a win after a string of setbacks defending President Donald Trump’s agenda from dozens of lawsuits. The decision from a three-judge panel allows the orders to be enforced as a lawsuit challenging them plays out. The appeals court judges halted a nationwide injunction from U.S. District Judge Adam Abelson in Baltimore.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nTwo of the judges on the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals wrote that Trump’s anti-DEI push could eventually raise concerns about First Amendment rights but said the judge’s sweeping block went too far. “My vote should not be understood as agreement with the orders’ attack on efforts to promote diversity, equity, and inclusion,” Judge Pamela Harris wrote. Two of the panel's members were appointed by President Barack Obama, while the third was appointed by Trump. Read More: What Is DEI and What Challenges Does It Face Amid Trump’s Executive Orders? Abelson had found the orders likely violated free-speech rights and are unconstitutionally vague since they don’t have a specific definition of DEI. Trump signed an order his first day in office directing federal agencies to terminate all “equity-related” grants or contracts. He signed a follow-up order requiring federal contractors to certify that they don’t promote DEI.\n\nThe city of Baltimore and other groups sued the Trump administration, arguing the executive orders are an unconstitutional overreach of presidential authority. The Justice Department has argued that the president was targeting only DEI programs that violate federal civil rights laws. Government attorneys said the administration should be able to align federal spending with the president’s priorities. Abelson, who was nominated by Democratic President Joe Biden, agreed with the plaintiffs that the executive orders discourage businesses, organizations and public entities from openly supporting diversity, equity and inclusion. Efforts to increase diversity long have been under attack by Republicans who contend the measures threaten merit-based hiring, promotion and educational opportunities for white people. Supporters say the programs help institutions meet the needs of increasingly diverse populations while addressing the lasting impacts of systemic racism.\n\nTheir purpose was to foster equitable environments in businesses and schools, especially for historically marginalized communities. Researchers say DEI initiatives date back to the 1960s but they expanded in 2020 during increased calls for racial justice.\n\nIn addition to the mayor and the Baltimore City Council, the plaintiffs include the National Association of Diversity Officers in Higher Education, the American Association of University Professors and the Restaurant Opportunities Centers United, which represents restaurant workers across the country.\n\n—Associated Press writer Lea Skene contributed to this story.",

        "title": "What Legal Experts Say About Trump's EPA Deregulations",
        "source": "https://time.com/",
        "content": "Earlier this week, the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) head, Lee Zeldin announced 31 actions aimed at rolling back a number of significant environmental regulations—including reconsidering restrictions on carbon dioxide emissions from power plants, rolling back vehicle emission standards aimed at accelerating the transition to EVs, and pushing to challenge a 2009 “endangerment finding” that determined greenhouse gasses like carbon dioxide and methane are a threat to public health.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nThe agency called it the “greatest and most consequential day of deregulation in U.S. history.” Legal experts say it's a marked departure from the agency’s historic purpose to protect human health and the environment. “It's an all out assault on climate regulation and environmental and public health protections,” says Michael Burger, director of the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia University. However, the announcement does not mean that the EPA has legal authority to institute the proposed rollbacks, experts say. “It is not within the authority of an agency to take action or to push through decisions that are directly and diametrically opposed to its mandate and the reason it was created,” says Nikki Reisch, director of Climate and Energy at the Center for International Environmental Law. While each administration has flexibility in how they enforce agency regulations, the process of outright repealing regulations is more complicated, Reisch notes. “Merely making these pronouncements from up high does not change the law,” she says. “It doesn't change the statutes that exist to protect clean air and clean water, and to protect the health of people throughout this country.”\n\nRead more: Here Are All of Trump’s Major Moves to Dismantle Climate Action In order to roll back a statute, the EPA would have to go through a process defined in the Administrative Procedure Act, which requires federal agencies to publish notices of proposed and final rules, and provide plenty of opportunity for the public to comment on those proposed changes. “One of the signature and most important features of the process is that the agency has to make clear what it intends or proposes to do and why,” says Reisch. “It can't just disregard these and steamroll ahead with what it intended, without explaining how it has considered and addressed those comments and why it is or isn't taking them into account. And that can be a really important opportunity for the public to send a strong signal to an agency that something matters.” As part of the process, the agency would have to back its proposal with scientific evidence. Among the most significant changes the agency has proposed is a reconsideration of a 2009 finding that determined greenhouse gas emissions pose a threat to public health—a finding that laid the foundation for much of the work the EPA has been able to do in the last 15 years.\n\nTo undo the finding, the agency would have to show that the scientific evidence is incorrect—disproving a globally accepted fact. Pollutants from greenhouse gasses reduce air quality, which increases individual risk for cardiovascular and respiratory diseases. “They have to [prove] the previous determination, that greenhouse gas emissions cause climate change and endanger public health and welfare, was wrong or was not based on sufficient scientific evidence. And there's no basis for that. The science is quite clear, and the consensus is global,” says Burger. Read more: How Trump Is Trying to Undo the Inflation Reduction Act Experts say that any attempted rollbacks will likely be litigated, and, given the scientific evidence against the agency’s proposals, courts are not likely to rule in the administration’s favor. But the process could take time. Meanwhile, the door is open for the administration—or corporate allies—to act in their own self interests.\n\n“It might take some months or even a year or two to get this litigated, and maybe that's what they're counting on,” says Daniel Esty, an environmental law professor at Yale University. “By ignoring [prior regulations] during the time that there's a challenge underway, they can get most of what they want.”",

The beloved feline was feared dead for two months after the Palisades wildfire in Los Angeles left her family's home in ashes. But her owner, 82-year-old Katherine Kiefer, held out some hope. Over the weekend, Kiefer got a call from the West Los Angeles Animal Shelter. Her daughter Carolyn Kiefer shared their reunion Saturday in a TikTok video that quickly garnered more than 1 million likes.

Many pet owners struggled to reach their domesticated animals during the frantic rush to evacuate from the Palisades wildfire in January. Aggie, who is about 5 years old, was gifted to Katherine Kiefer by a friend during the COVID-19 pandemic. Social media users have been so touched by the pair's reunion video that many have been asking for daily updates. The family's $30,000 GoFundMe campaign for Aggie’s vet bills had topped $21,000 by Tuesday afternoon. The cat has undergone several blood transfusions and is now seeing a specialist.\n\n“She was basically skin and bone, and in a state of absolute starvation,” Carolyn said.\n\nThe family will officially be reunited with Aggie when she is released from the hospital Thursday.

        "source": "https://time.com/",
        "content": "Canada’s energy minister is angry. Speaking to me while in Houston for CERAWeek, Jonathan Wilkinson described the phases of Canada’s reaction to U.S. President Donald Trump’s tariffs and repeated taunting: shock, then hurt, and now anger. “We are resolute in our need to push back,” he says. Wilkinson says that the anger shouldn’t influence his government’s decision making. But, at the same time, no option is off the table—including restrictions on energy and natural resources. Because of the highly-linked energy systems of the two countries, such a move could wreak significant havoc on the U.S. economy. “We would be foolish to take tools out of the toolbox,” he told me. “In the context where there's no negotiation around trying to find a resolution here, certainly, export tariffs on energy remain in that toolbox.”\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nThere are many potential energy and climate change implications of the U.S.-initiated trade dispute. In the short term, Canada’s political conversation has been consumed by trade talks—squeezing out space for resolving some of the country’s thorny energy and climate policy debates. In the longer term, a sustained and intensified U.S.-Canada trade spat could lead to more investment in fossil fuel infrastructure in both countries. And, even under a new U.S. administration, this moment will not be forgotten, making it more difficult to build durable partnerships in areas like critical minerals—a key component of the energy transition. “Under the new Prime Minister, Canada remains committed to the fight against climate change,” says Wilkinson, referring to the newly elected prime minister Mark Carney. But “some elements of the climate plan probably have become a little tougher in the context of working with the Trump Administration.”\n\nTrump’s tariffs have shocked executives across the corporate world—and the energy industry is no exception. The sector is highly integrated, especially across the U.S.-Canada border. In the U.S. midwest, oil refineries run on crude that flows from Canada. In much of the northeast U.S., Canadian electricity helps keep the lights on. Meanwhile, Canada imports U.S. oil in its eastern provinces. “The integrated nature of the two economies, and in particular of the energy economies… pulling them apart is almost impossible,” says Wilkinson. And yet, nonetheless, Wilkinson says his country will be looking away from the U.S. “Canadians' confidence in their ability to simply rely on the United States to the exclusion of the rest of the world has been shaken.” A key area that may suffer is potential collaboration between the two countries on the critical minerals that will play an essential role in the energy transition. Canada has rich stores of lithium, cobalt, and nickel, among other resources, and had previously worked with the U.S. government to create a North American supply chain for batteries and other clean energy technologies. While Trump is no fan of the energy transition, he has homed in on critical minerals in his push to annex Greenland given the essential role the minerals play in manufacturing, defense, and advanced electronics. “Critical minerals in particular are a potentially useful tool, if we have to go there, given that the alternative sources of supply typically are going to be China, in some cases Russia,” Wilkinson said on March 12. “We're not there yet, and we prefer not to further escalate this at this point.”\n\nA prolonged, deepened trade rift could push Canada to look more to Europe, South Korea, and Japan to help finance and purchase the product that comes with developing these resources. That would leave the U.S. at a disadvantage and reshape the centers of power in clean technologies. At CERAWeek, an energy conference that draws the world’s biggest players in the industry, some executives chatted about the possibility that Canada might revive plans to build an oil pipeline from the country’s oil producing west to its eastern cities. This would reduce Canada’s reliance on U.S. oil in the east and make it easier to sell Canadian oil domestically. Wilkinson offered deep skepticism, telling me that such a project would face difficult economics and likely require government subsidy. Nonetheless, he said, it could be worth considering on national security grounds should the situation deteriorate further.\n\n“Presently, there is no one proposing to build a pipeline,” he says. “You could argue that there is an energy security issue, and that is a legitimate conversation… but we should be looking at all available options.”\n\nLike with much else tied to Trump Administration policy, it is hard to assess the exact climate implications of this trade rift. At the very least, it’s a distraction for Canada. When I first met Wilkinson last year, we had extensive conversations about the country’s carbon tax and engagement with the country’s Indigenous First Nations to build energy projects. Progress on those issues now feels miniscule in the scheme of things. But, more broadly, it provides a hint of what world may emerge in the wake of Trump’s wrecking ball: less collaboration and clean technology supply chains that don’t include the U.S.\n\nTo get this story in your inbox, subscribe to the TIME CO2 Leadership Report newsletter here.",

        "content": "Michelle Zauner wants to set the record straight: She is not trying to reclaim the label “sad girl music.” Since announcing the title of her highly anticipated fourth studio album, For Melancholy Brunettes (& sad women), the author, director, and front woman of indie-pop band Japanese Breakfast has been surprised to see how divisive the title has become, and the assumptions it’s given way to. Some thought she was writing a collection of sad breakup songs; others that she was taking ownership of a label that has previously been wielded with the intent to belittle or insult.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n“I think [the album title] was a little bit tongue-in-cheek,” Zauner says with a chuckle over Zoom in early February. “And it was maybe taken very literally.” “Sad girl music” is a fraught subject, and Zauner chooses her words carefully. “I don’t want to get into trouble,” she says, explaining that a lot of brilliant women songwriters get unfairly punted into that category. And it’s true: the music industry and the internet have made a nasty habit of reducing songwriting by women that deals with complex emotions in this way—Phoebe Bridgers, Mitski, and Lana Del Rey have had to fend off these degrading designations for years.\n\nZauner, though, is interested to see what people will say once they’ve had a listen to the project in its entirety. With the album due March 21, Zauner, 35, finds herself in a constant state of “caring, then not caring, and then pretending to care.” Her mood matches the weather outside our windows: “I’m a winter person in the sense that I feel like I must suffer through something to enjoy the coming season,” she says and laughs heartily. The stakes feel high after her past few years. For Melancholy Brunettes arrives four years after Zauner’s rise from indie-music darling to literary heavyweight with the release of her wildly successful, gut-punching memoir Crying in H Mart, which explored her Korean American identity and her relationship with her late mother Chongmi, who died of cancer in 2014. Written in arresting, empathetic prose, it became an instant New York Times best seller and is currently in its 39th printing.\n\nRead More: Michelle Zauner Is on the 2022 TIME 100 List Zauner followed up Crying in H Mart with Japanese Breakfast’s third studio album, Jubilee. Unlike the book, the album took a sharp turn away from grief into cathartic joy, blending dreamy synth-pop chords with shoe-gaze sensibilities. It was equally met with critical success, earning the group nominations for Best New Artist and Best Alternative Music Album at the 2022 Grammys. For Melancholy Brunettes (& sad women), though, is worlds away from the sonic landscape of Jubilee. It’s not quite in the sphere of Crying in H Mart, either. Here, Zauner is exploring something bleaker—crueler and more punishing. She’s trying to see what darkness, of all different kinds, looks like when you stare it right in the face. When I ask what comes to mind when Zauner thinks of melancholy brunettes, she excitedly whips out her phone to rattle off some references: Paintings like L’Absinthe by Edgar Degas, Tired by Ramón Casas, and The Wedding Dress by Frederick Elwell—all interpretations of women experiencing massive despair—were hugely informative to the record. They were especially important to the album art, which sees Zauner looking like a gothic, Brontëesque character, face down on a table surrounded by a plentiful feast. “I like the idea of being someone just collapsed on a table, surrounded by a wealth of goods. Like a spoiled prince or something,” she explains.\n\nWhen Zauner began writing For Melancholy Brunettes in the winter of 2022, she was clear that she wanted to do something from a more introspective place. She wanted to write songs that were also more guitar-focused, compared to Jubilee’s lush horns and slinky synths, and teamed up with producer Blake Mills (who, among his vast repertoire of acts, has worked with other virtuosic rock acts like Fiona Apple, Perfume Genius, and Alabama Shakes) to record the album at Sound City in Los Angeles—making it the band’s first proper studio release after working on their first three records with friends in makeshift recording studios. As she began piecing the songs together, Zauner was also reading—a lot. She wanted to explore how the concept of melancholy has evolved in stories of love and longing, society and familial relationships over time. She worked her way from European Romanticism to Greek mythology before turning to Gothic Romance classics like Jane Eyre, Wuthering Heights, and Frankenstein, and even modernist staples like The Magic Mountain by German author Thomas Mann, which is her husband and fellow bandmate Peter Bradley’s favorite book and directly inspired a song on the album.\n\nShe also became increasingly fascinated with works “that could be categorized as part of the incel canon,” Zauner says—books that the mostly male subculture of self-described “involuntary celibates” has glorified for their depiction of loneliness and manhood—think American Psycho by Bret Easton Ellis and Infinite Jest by David Foster Wallace. Zauner hoped to better understand why this type of “confused masculinity” and Joker-like anger and loneliness emerges; how these aggrieved and occasionally violent men process the world. “If I look back at my very early work, it’s always been [there]—this fear of men,” she says. “There is this disappointment and fear of men, and these creepy stories—like an ominous thing has happened or is about to happen—that threads the songs together.”\n\nZauner, second from right, performs with Japanese Breakfast Todd Owyoung—NBC/Getty Images\n\nIndeed, listening to the new album feels not unlike you’re Cathy (or Heathcliff) staring at the misty English moors, as impending doom envelops you from all angles: On “Honey Water,” a woman finds herself in a marriage to a slimy, unfaithful man, and equates him to a thirsty bug. On “Mega Circuit,” a lustful spectator watches a gang of incels meander around over a feverish, sinister guitar shuffle. On “Little Girl,” perhaps one of the most devastating ballads on the record, a father, urinating in a corner of a lonely hotel room, wonders how he became estranged from his daughter. (“Seven years of running at this breakneck speed/ Convalescing cheaply far abroad/ Dreaming of a daughter who won’t speak to me/ Running for her father coming home.”) Dramatic as they may seem, these sentiments are strikingly relatable—feelings of yearning and amorphous despair on an album releasing in the middle of a public-health crisis of loneliness.\n\nThe lyrics, the storytelling, the sparse, meticulous melodies—it’s all so beautifully punishing, and that is exactly the point. After her mom died, Zauner says, she “became very work-obsessed.” While work was a grounding force, it came at a cost: “I kind of lost track of any form of self-care or personal life, or family and friends.” Following the release of Crying in H Mart and then Jubilee (and a much-needed sabbatical in Korea), Zauner found herself thinking about what it means to be a creative working woman in her mid-30s—the price one pays for their ambitions. It was playing on Zauner’s mind a lot as she was making For Melancholy Brunettes, especially when she thought about balancing her work with expanding her family. “There is this anticipatory grief about wanting to become a mother and having to reckon with the creative loss that that will usher in,” Zauner says. “I was thinking about how much I’ve excused men for poor behavior because of their positions of power and the work that they’ve had to do to provide for their family.” Now, as Zauner has grown into her creative career, she questions the elusive balancing act between the “narcissism that comes with being an artist and [the desire to be] a good human being.”\n\nIt’s what drew her to write the album’s lead single, “Orlando in Love.” Inspired by John Cheever’s nod to Orlando Innamorato, an unfinished epic poem by the Renaissance poet Matteo Maria Boiardo, the song is a story about “a foolish, romantic guy” who succumbs to a siren’s call, and in some ways, Zauner’s personal reflection on success. “You’re pursuing your dreams in a very foolhardy way, and sometimes you’re punished for just how straight you’re going with it,” she says. “Like, if you go too far in your ambitions, it likely will not end well.” The 2025 Grammys happened a week before Zauner and I spoke, and the internet was still buzzing not only from Beyoncé’s finally winning Album of the Year, but another artist who unequivocally spoke their mind that night: Chappell Roan. Roan, who received the Grammy for Best New Artist, got up to the podium and called out the record industry for not supporting emerging artists with necessities like a livable wage and health insurance. When Zauner heard this, she immediately took to X to congratulate Roan, writing, “f-ck ya Chappell!!!!!” That got her in a bit of trouble: some people interpreted “ya” to mean an insulting “you” instead of an enthusiastic “yes.” Zauner couldn’t believe it.\n\nRead More: Leave Chappell Roan Alone\n\n“Let the record show that I thought it was amazing, and I think it’s so ridiculous how much crap she has to endure for all of the good that she’s putting into the world. She inspires me to be a more outspoken, braver artist,” Zauner says. Having been nominated in the same category, she finds it a bit funny that these award shows so aggressively avoid naming the problems that plague the same industry they are celebrating. But Roan, she says, “very eloquently and very courageously said exactly what the problem is.”\n\nPerhaps that’s what For Melancholy Brunettes (& sad women) is trying to do, too. Naming the problem—and hoping that despite the scars, the battle wounds, the punishment, and the castigations, we’ll all come out the other end into the light.",

        "content": "Dr. Frank Frizelle has operated on countless patients in his career as a colorectal surgeon. But there’s one case that stayed with him.\n\nIn 2014, he was treating a woman in her late 20s suffering from bowel cancer—already a rare situation, given her age. But it became even more unusual when her best friend visited her in the hospital and told Frizelle that she had many of the same symptoms as his patient. Subsequent testing revealed that his patient’s friend had a lesion that, had it not been caught early, likely would have become cancerous. “That really brought it home to me—how it’s much more common than you think,” says Frizelle, a professor of surgery at the University of Otago in New Zealand.\n\nStill, like any good scientist, Frizelle was skeptical. Was it simply a fluke that he kept treating strikingly young patients? Or was his practice one tiny data point in a larger trend?\n\nHe found his answer after sifting through national health data: colorectal cancer, he discovered, was indeed being diagnosed more often than in previous years among New Zealanders under 50. Further research by Frizelle analyzing populations in Sweden and Scotland showed the same thing. A bigger picture was emerging. Here were three different countries, with different populations and health challenges—but united by a spike in colorectal cancers among young adults.\n\nPhotograph by Frankie Alduino for TIME\n\nIn the years since, it’s become clear that the problem isn’t limited to those three countries, nor to colorectal cancer. Researchers have found that young people around the world are getting many different kinds of cancer at alarmingly high rates. And as the diagnoses of celebrities and public figures like Kate Middleton, Chadwick Boseman, Dwyane Wade, and Olivia Munn bring mass attention to the issue, scientists are racing to answer a question on the minds of many outside the medical profession: Why is cancer, historically a disease of old age, increasingly striking people in the primes of their lives?\n\nGlobally, diagnoses and deaths related to early-onset cancers—those affecting patients younger than 50—rose by 79% and 28%, respectively, from 1990 to 2019, according to a recent study published in the medical journal BMJ Oncology. In the U.S., breast cancer is the most common type of early-onset disease, but recent surges in cancers affecting digestive organs—including the colon, rectum, pancreas, and stomach—are particularly dramatic within this age group. In fact, today’s young adults are about twice as likely to be diagnosed with colon cancer—and four times as likely to be diagnosed with rectal cancer—as those born around 1950, research suggests.\n\nRead More: The Unique Hell of Getting Cancer as a Young Adult\n\nOverall, cancer is still overwhelmingly an older person’s disease. As of 2025, 88% of people in the U.S. diagnosed with cancer were 50 or older, and 59% were 65 or older, according to data from the American Cancer Society. But there is no question that the demographics are shifting. Under 50s are not only at increasing risk of suffering from cancer; theirs is the only age group for which the risk is rising. All told, 17 types of cancer are on the rise among U.S. adults in this age group.\n\n“When we were younger, we assumed the climate would be the same forever. The same applies in cancer,” says Dr. Thomas Powles, a U.K.-based oncologist and cancer researcher who edits the journal Annals of Oncology. “We just assumed that cancer incidence was something that is relatively static. But it’s not.”\n\nThere is some good news in the data. Advances in disease detection and treatment, as well as dramatic declines in smoking, mean that far fewer people die from cancer now than once did. Although the disease still ranks as the second most common cause of death in the U.S., killing more than half a million people each year, mortality rates have dropped by about a third since 1991.\n\nLess encouragingly, the rate of new cancers diagnosed has remained stubbornly consistent, declining only modestly from 1999 to 2021. Across the U.S., roughly 2 million new cancer cases are detected each year, diagnoses that, on top of the emotional toll, force patients to cumulatively fork out billions of dollars in out-of-pocket costs—more than $16 billion in 2019 alone, according to federal data. Today, about 40 out of every 100 U.S. adults can expect to be diagnosed with cancer at some point in their lifetimes. For an estimated 1 in 17 U.S. women and 1 in 29 U.S. men, that news will come before their 50th birthdays.\n\nThe rise in early-onset diagnoses partly comes down to advances in our ability to detect and diagnose different kinds of cancers. “With much more sophisticated tools now, inevitably we’re doing more tests on younger people [and] we’re using more accurate imaging,” which leads to more cancers detected, Powles says. Some screening protocols have also been modified in recent years to include younger adults; since 2018, for example, the American Cancer Society has recommended colonoscopies starting at age 45, down from 50.\n\nRead More: Some Early Forms of Breast Cancer May Not Need Treatment, Study Says\n\nBut this is only one part of what scientists say is a more complex web of factors they are still attempting to understand. The data suggest that some element—or perhaps combination of elements—of modern life is sickening progressively younger adults. And right now, no one knows for sure what that is.\n\nThere are plenty of known risk factors for cancer, from the genes someone is born with to the unhealthy lifestyle habits they pick up, such as smoking, drinking lots of alcohol, or spending time in the sun. Such habits can speed up the natural degradation of cells, which over time acquire genetic mutations as they lose their ability to repair damage. As that damage accumulates with age, cells may become cancerous, growing and -multiplying too fast for the body’s immune system to keep them in check and potentially choking out vital organs. The immune system also loses some of its strength with age, making it easier for cancer cells to colonize the body.\n\nBut classic risk factors do not seem to fully explain the recent rise in early-onset cancers, says Dr. Cathy Eng, director of the Young Adult Cancers Program at Vanderbilt University’s Ingram Cancer Center in Tennessee. Some of the trends are baffling; young, nonsmoking women, for example, are being diagnosed with lung cancer in strangely high numbers. Many times, Eng’s patients were extremely healthy: vegetarians, marathon runners, avid swimmers. “That’s why I really believe there’s other risk factors to account for this,” she says.\n\nKelly Spill, 33, was initially brushed aside by doctors who thought her cancer symptoms were related to pregnancy and birth. “If you don’t find your answers, keep pushing for them,” Spill says. Frankie Alduino for TIME\n\nThere’s no shortage of theories about what those may be. Many scientists point to modern diets, which tend to be heavy on potentially carcinogenic products—including ultra-processed foods, red meat, and alcohol—and may also contribute to weight gain, another cancer risk factor. The foods we eat can also affect the gut microbiome, the colony of microbes that lives in the digestive system and appears linked to overall health. Alterations to the gut microbiome via diet, or perhaps exposure to drugs like antibiotics, have also been implicated.\n\nOther researchers blame the microplastics littering our environment and leaching into our food and water supplies, some of which, according to a 2024 study, have even shown up in cancer patients’ tumors. Other environmental factors could also be to blame, given that everything from cosmetics to food packaging contains substances that many researchers aren’t convinced are safe. Even our near constant exposure to artificial light could be messing with normal biological rhythms in ways that have profound health consequences, some research suggests.\n\nFor now, these are all just hypotheses. Some may turn out to be wrong, and more theories will emerge in time. It’s also likely that different risk factors are linked to different cancers, Frizelle says. Even in a single patient, multiple overlapping triggers may be in play.\n\nFrizelle’s research on colorectal cancer, for example, suggests there may be a dysfunctional relationship between microplastics, certain foods, and some types of gut bacteria. Studies suggest that when microplastics get into the body, they can penetrate the mucous lining that protects the bowels and carry bacteria and toxins to the bowel lining. This leaves the bowel more susceptible to damage from pathogens inside the body—including strains of gut bacteria that are known to become more virulent when they interact with compounds found in red and processed meat. In some patients, this perfect storm of invaders may result in cancer, Frizelle thinks.\n\nRead More: CNN’s Sara Sidner Is Demystifying Breast Cancer Treatment\n\nHe believes this overlapping puzzle of risk factors is a likelier explanation than any one lifestyle habit driving a dramatic uptick in cancers—especially since younger generations are, in many respects, healthier than their ancestors. In the U.S., for example, tobacco use has plummeted in recent decades, and young adults are increasingly unlikely to drink. “How is the health-conscious generation getting more bowel cancer?” Frizelle asks.\n\nDr. Andrea Cercek, co-director of the Center for Young Onset Colorectal and Gastrointestinal Cancers at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York City, agrees that some early-onset cancer cases defy easy explanation. She’s treated patients in their 20s and even teens with tumors that, biologically, “look just like a regular 80-year-old’s tumor.” These cases stump her. “Even if they drank as a teenager, it just doesn’t make sense,” she says. A few years of drinking alcohol, following an unhealthy diet, or having obesity should not be enough to produce the kind of tumor typically seen in a senior citizen, Cercek says. And yet, there they are.\n\nGiancarlo Oviedo-Mori, 32, credits his Christian faith with helping him live with lung cancer for more than a decade. “When I was first diagnosed, I was searching on Google for anybody who was a survivor, and I couldn’t find no one,” he says. “There is hope. There are people who are living long and having a great quality of life.” Frankie Alduino for TIME\n\nTo Cercek, these advanced tumors suggest that people have been exposed to damaging substances for a long time, perhaps even longer than they were aware of. Research and awareness about early-onset cancer is accumulating now, but the source of the problem may not be new, Cercek says. It can take years for even the most toxic exposures to result in health problems—which means that the source of a problem in the public eye now may have emerged decades ago, silently sickening people until the trend became too pronounced to ignore.\n\nGiancarlo Oviedo-Mori, 32, is one of many patients whose cancer defies obvious explanation. When he was in high school, Oviedo-Mori developed a persistent cough that didn’t respond to medication. Eventually, at just 18 years old, he was diagnosed with Stage IV lung cancer.\n\nOviedo-Mori and his doctors were stunned. He’d had asthma as a child growing up in Peru, but he had no family history of cancer and had never been a drinker or smoker; he was barely even old enough to buy cigarettes and still years shy of his 21st birthday. Oviedo-Mori’s family spent a day observing the site of the 9/11 terrorist attack when toxic particles were still in the air, but it had been a brief visit and no one else in the family had developed health problems. That was the only exposure he could think of. The diagnosis didn’t make sense. “It was so weird,” he says.\n\nRead More: 4 Important Steps to Take After a Cancer Diagnosis\n\nAs he went through cancer treatment—including chemotherapy, radiation, and a surgery that removed his entire left lung—he’d look at his fellow patients, and, seeing how much older they were, feel out of place. “I didn’t belong there,” he says.\n\nMore than a decade later, Oviedo-Mori is still in treatment, participating in a clinical trial at Memorial Sloan Kettering (where all the patients pictured in this article have received care) in hopes of ridding his body of cancer for good. But, though he’s still fighting cancer, he is in good health—he can even play soccer, despite having only one lung, and chase after his almost 2-year-old son. “Sometimes, I don’t believe it,” he says. “I think about [my son] and I’m like, ‘Oh my gosh, you’re really a miracle.’”\n\nFiguring out how young people like Oviedo-Mori fall prey to cancer is not easy, given the sheer number of potential health hazards in the modern world. It is a puzzle with an unknown number of pieces—one that Dr. Shuji Ogino, a pathologist at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston, is trying to solve with a technique he pioneered.\n\nDr. Shuji Ogino, a pathologist at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston, is studying early-onset cancer using a unique approach that combines epidemiology (the study of population-level health trends) and molecular pathology (the granular analysis of a patient’s tumor). He believes this unlikely pairing will help uncover triggers for early-onset disease. Sophie Park for TIME\n\nOgino and his team are making their way through about 4,000 colorectal tumor samples that came from people who developed the disease at various points in their lives. Each sliver of tissue holds innumerable clues about the person it belonged to, from what they ate and drank to the bacteria that lived in their body before cancer took root. To unearth these clues, the researchers stain the tissues, so that under the lens of a powerful microscope, they can see the different types of cells in the tumor in brilliant color. Using these cell-level insights, they can distinguish between the tumors of young vs. older patients and—with the help of AI—search reams of scientific literature for environmental exposures, lifestyle habits, or health conditions linked to particular cellular traits. Repeating this painstaking detective work enough times helps reveal patterns among young cancer patients, giving Ogino and his team clues as to what may have caused their diseases.\n\nTheir research has already pointed to some possible answers for early-onset colorectal cancer. The big three so far are eating a typical Western diet (high in sugar, processed foods, and red meat, low in fresh produce), developing insulin resistance (a precursor to diabetes also linked to poor diet), and having a particular type of E. coli bacteria in the gut. Nothing is proven yet, Ogino says. But since there’s no harm in eating healthfully, he believes dietary changes are worth making now.\n\nOgino personally drinks very little and eats a healthy diet. He makes sure his young son eats well too, since his research makes him acutely aware of the importance of developing healthy habits starting from a very young age. But even for children as young as Ogino’s son, some damage may already be done—at least according to Dr. George Barreto, a surgeon and cancer researcher at Flinders University in South Australia.\n\nRead More: 8 Symptoms Doctors Often Dismiss As Anxiety\n\nBarreto—who started researching early-onset cancer after not just his patients, but also several of his relatives and friends, were diagnosed at young ages—has theorized that damage may start in the womb. It’s well established that the pre-natal period can have long-term effects on a baby’s health, and Barreto believes that phenomenon may extend to cancer risk if parents are exposed to carcinogens during this critical developmental time. This theory could help explain mysterious cases like those Cercek describes, involving patients who seemingly haven’t lived long enough for even their riskiest habits to catch up with them.\n\nProving his theory won’t be simple, Barreto acknowledges. It would require collecting data on huge numbers of people, starting before they were even born, then sifting through that data to pinpoint relevant prenatal and early-life triggers. To speed up the process, Barreto has contacted more than 20 research groups around the world that are tracking groups of people beginning at or before birth, in hopes of using their data to jump-start his research. “If we start [from scratch] now, it will take us 40 years to find answers,” Barreto says. That’s too long to wait, with patients already getting sick at an alarming rate.\n\nThere is yet another question for researchers to answer: whether, on a molecular level, young patients’ cancers are dramatically different from those that occur in older people. If so, these findings may guide researchers toward new treatment approaches.\n\nSome research, including by Eng, has pointed to molecular differences, at least among patients with early-onset colorectal disease. But other scientists are less convinced. Powles, the U.K. oncologist, says he hasn’t seen strong evidence to suggest that early-onset cancers are much different or more aggressive than later-in-life cancers; they just happen to strike patients at younger ages.\n\nCarrie Regan, 41, went to the ER in 2023 because of stomach pain, which led to an ovarian cancer diagnosis. Regan is now in good health and is monitored for recurrence. She wants other women to be vigilant about their health, since ovarian cancer symptoms, like bloating and cramps, are easy to miss. “The day I went to the ER, there was a long wait and I started to feel better. I almost left,” she says. The fact that she didn’t saved her life. Frankie Alduino for TIME\n\nEven if there is no medical requirement to stray from classic treatment methods—like chemotherapy, radiation, and surgery—younger patients have unique needs. Standard treatments, while often effective, can be destructive for people with decades of life ahead of them, potentially leading to life-altering physical changes, like permanently needing a colostomy bag or enduring early menopause and infertility. “The worst thing [for an oncologist to hear] is, ‘I’m cured and my cancer’s gone, but I wish that I’d just lived with my cancer because living like this isn’t living,’” Cercek says.\n\nKelly Spill was blindsided when she was diagnosed with Stage III colorectal cancer in 2020. She was only 28, had no family history of colorectal cancer, and had recently given birth to her first child. She was even more stunned when she learned that her treatment would force her to permanently use a colostomy bag and leave her unable to carry more children. “That completely broke me,” she says. “I’d always wanted a big family.”\n\nJust before she was set to start chemotherapy, however, a research nurse told her she might be a fit for an experimental trial that Cercek was leading. Cercek was testing a new approach among patients whose tumors had a specific genetic mutation: using intravenous medication to boost their immune systems’ abilities to recognize and attack cancerous cells, ideally sparing patients from chemotherapy, radiation, and surgery.\n\nRead More: What to Do If Your Doctor Doesn’t Take Your Symptoms Seriously\n\nDespite all the unknowns that came with participating in a clinical trial, Spill says it was a “no-brainer” to try Cercek’s approach instead of therapies that would leave her with lifelong physical side effects. Her gamble paid off: by her ninth treatment session, her tumor had entirely disappeared. Spill is still cancer-free and expecting her third baby in May.\n\nIn June, Cercek reported that out of 41 rectal cancer patients who completed the full regimen, 100% were cancer-free and required no additional treatment. She is now also studying the method against a variety of different cancers, ranging from stomach to bladder. A patient of any age could benefit from this approach, Cercek says, but it could be particularly impactful for young patients, like Spill, who are desperate to avoid permanent side effects.\n\nEven without novel medical approaches, cancer centers are beginning to recognize that, compared with elderly patients, “adolescents and young adults have very different experiences, and therefore need very different approaches to their treatment,” says Alison Silberman, CEO of Stupid Cancer, a nonprofit that supports young people with the disease. Physical fallout isn’t the only hurdle to overcome, Silberman says. Compared with older patients, young people are more likely to struggle to pay for their care and to develop mental-health issues as a result of it.\n\nSilberman witnessed these challenges when her brother was diagnosed with advanced cancer in his 20s. “He was yanked out of his life,” forced to leave his job and apartment to move back in with their parents, Silberman remembers. Cancer made him grapple with his own mortality, largely on his own. “He was too old to be a pediatric patient, too young to be an adult patient,” she says. “That was very isolating for him.”\n\nImtiaz Hussain, 31, says cancer is seen as “kind of untreatable” in his native Pakistan. He no longer thinks so, after joining a clinical trial run by Memorial Sloan Kettering’s Dr. Andrea Cercek. After just a few months of treatment with an experimental immunotherapy drug, Hussain felt better. Today, he is cancer-free and a father of three. “I was a part of history,” he says. Frankie Alduino for TIME\n\n“Care of early-onset cancer patients becomes complex even beyond [medicine],” says Dr. Veda Giri, an oncologist and co-director of Yale Cancer Center’s Early Onset Cancer Program in Connecticut. This spring, the program will launch new services meant to address that very problem. Patients in the program will be contacted by coordinators who can help guide them through issues that commonly affect young-adult patients, from ways to preserve fertility to deciding whether to pursue genetic testing or enroll in a clinical trial. Patients can also participate in support groups with others in their age group, in hopes of improving social and mental health. The goal: to “support patients and their families from diagnosis all the way through their cancer journey and beyond into survivorship,” since young adults cured of cancer may have continuing needs for decades to come, Giri says.\n\nThe ultimate goal, of course—and the ultimate win for doctors and researchers working in this field—will be for early-onset cancer centers to be rendered unnecessary. But it likely won’t happen anytime soon. Proponents of sophisticated new artificial-intelligence technologies have raised expectations, promising new tools that could transform cancer research. AI gives scientists the ability to sift through mountains of data with hitherto unimaginable levels of precision. And the hope is that these tools will unlock a cascade of new discoveries—illuminating unrecognized risk factors, for example, and turbocharging the development of new treatments.\n\nBut cancer researchers remain cautious. There is hope, no doubt—but like the legions of scientists grappling with complex medical puzzles in other fields, they are wary of overstating the pace of progress and raising the hopes of patients, even with new technologies at their disposal.\n\n“It will be impossible to design a clinical trial that can test all different possible causes of early-onset cancer,” says Dr. Andrew Chan, director of cancer epidemiology at Mass General Cancer Center. AI and other technologies may help land on those possible causes faster. But to really understand exactly what’s driving the disease and how to stop it, researchers must work slowly and methodically, studying various potential triggers—from diet to alcohol to microplastics—one by one.\n\nRead More: 8 Ways to Shorten Your Wait for a Doctor’s Appointment\n\nChan’s team is starting with a trial that will study whether losing weight with the help of GLP-1 drugs like Wegovy and Zepbound affects future cancer risk among people who have survived early-onset cancer and who are overweight. Future research may study the effects of specific dietary changes, he says. But not all potential cancer triggers are as straightforward to modify as weight and diet.\n\nTake microplastics, which Frizelle, the New Zealand surgeon, believes are contributing to early-onset cancer. Frizelle is realistic about their ubiquity. Avoiding them is all but impossible in a world where water supplies are tainted and babies suckle on plastic bottles from their earliest days on earth. Barreto’s research on cancer risk starting in the womb paints an even bleaker picture, suggesting that the deck may be stacked against some people before they are really people at all. (He chooses to see it more optimistically, noting that everyone can still “take the power into their own hands” by avoiding known carcinogens.)\n\nThe upshot of all this: it could take years, if not decades, to sort out what’s causing early diagnoses, and perhaps even more time to figure out how to stop them. What seems so obvious to us now—the conclusion that smoking cigarettes causes lung cancer, for example—took some 40 years for scientists to solidify. Even once they did, change didn’t happen overnight. Smoking rates have fallen steadily since public-health warnings escalated in the 1960s, but they didn’t plummet all at once. Still, change is possible. Today, smoking is at historic lows, and lung cancer diagnoses have declined with them.\n\nIf the challenge sounds daunting, for researchers like Ogino, from Brigham and Women’s, the complexities are part of the process. He is reminded every day that good science takes as long as it takes. Many of the tumor samples he relies on in his research came from participants enrolled in a study that launched in 1976. The researchers who started it couldn’t have known that, 50 years later, their work would be critical in the quest to reverse the rise of early-onset cancer, Ogino says.\n\n“That’s the kind of legacy you can make in science,” he says. “That’s a great, rewarding way to contribute”—even if it takes a lot of time to get there.",

So ensnared are we in a culture of digitised deceptions, a phenomenon increasingly augmented by artificial intelligence, it would be easy to think that deceit itself is a high-tech invention of the cyber age. Recent revelations however – from the discovery of an elaborate, if decidedly low-tech, art forger's workshop in Rome to the sensational allegation that a cherished Baroque masterpiece in London's National Gallery is a crude simulacrum of a lost original – remind us that duplicity in the world of art has a long and storied history, one written not in binary ones and zeroes, but in impossible pigments, clumsy brushstrokes and suspicious signatures. When it comes to falsification and phoniness, there is indeed no new thing under the Sun.\n\nOn 19 February, Italy's Carabinieri Command for the Protection of Cultural Heritage uncovered a covert forgery operation in a northern district of Rome. Authorities confiscated more than 70 fraudulent artworks falsely attributed to notable artists from Pissarro to Picasso, Rembrandt to Dora Maar, along with materials used to mimic vintage canvases, artist signatures, and the stamps of galleries no longer in operation. The suspect, who has yet to be apprehended, is thought to have used online platforms such as Catawiki and eBay to hawk their phoney wares, deceiving potential buyers with convincing certificates of authenticity that they likewise contrived.\n\nNews of the clandestine lab's discovery was quickly followed by publicity for a new book, due for release this week, alleging that one of The National Gallery's highlights is not at all what it seems. According to artist and historian Euphrosyne Doxiadis, author of NG6461: The Fake National Gallery Rubens, the painting Samson and Delilah – a large oil-on-wood attributed to the 17th Century Flemish master Peter Paul Rubens and purchased by the London museum in 1980 for £2.5m (then the second-highest price ever paid for a painting at auction) – is three centuries younger than the date of 1609-10 that sits beside it on the gallery wall and is incalculably less accomplished than the museum believes.\n\nAlamy Samson and Delilah, by Peter Paul Rubens (Credit: Alamy)\n\nDoxiadis's conclusion corroborates one reached in 2021 by the Swiss company, Art Recognition, which determined, through the use of AI, that there was a 91% probability that Samson and Delilah is the work of someone other than Rubens. Her assertion that the brushwork we see in the painting is crass and wholly inconsistent with the fluid flow of the Flemish master's hand is strongly contested by The National Gallery, which stands by its attribution. \"Samson and Delilah has long been accepted by leading Rubens scholars as a masterpiece by Peter Paul Rubens\", it said in a statement given to the BBC. \"Painted on wood panel in oil shortly after his return to Antwerp in 1608 and demonstrating all that the artist had learned in Italy, it is a work of the highest aesthetic quality. A technical examination of the picture was presented in an article in The National Gallery's Technical Bulletin in 1983. The findings remain valid.\"\n\nThe divergence of opinion between the museum's experts and those who doubt the work's authenticity opens a curious space in which to reflect on intriguing questions of artistic value and merit. Is there ever legitimacy in forgery? Can fakes be masterpieces? As more sophisticated tools of analysis are applied to paintings and drawings whose legitimacy has long been in question (including several works attributed to Leonardo da Vinci, such as the hotly disputed chalk and ink drawing La Bella Principessa), as well as those whose validity has never been in doubt, debates about the integrity of cultural icons are only likely to accelerate. What follows are a handful of handy principles to keep in mind when navigating the impending controversies – five simple rules for spotting a fake masterpiece.\n\nRule 1: Pigments never lie\n\nAlamy Portrait of Saint Jerome (Credit: Alamy)\n\nTo be a successful art forger requires more than technical proficiency and a misplaced ethical compass. It isn't enough to approximate the dibby-dabby dots of a Georges Seurat, say, or the thick expressive swirls of Vincent van Gogh. You need to know your history as well as your chemistry. Anachronistic pigments will give you away every time and were the downfall of German art forger Wolfgang Beltracchi and his wife Helene, who succeeded in selling makeshift modernist masterpieces for millions before a careless squeeze of prefab paint onto their audacious palettes in 2006 sealed their fate.\n\nBeltracchi, whose modus operandi was to create \"new\" works by everyone from Max Ernst to André Derain, rather than recreate lost ones, was always careful to mix his own paints to ensure they contained only ingredients available to whomever he was attempting to impersonate. He only slipped up once. And that was enough. Fabricating a wonky Der Blaue Reiter-ish red landscape of jigsawed horses that he attributed to the German Expressionist Heinrich Campendonk, Beltracchi reached for a readymade tube of paint, which he hadn't realised contained a pinch of titanium white – a relatively new pigment to which Campendonk would not have had access. It was all investigators would need to prove the work, which had sold for €2.8m, was a fake.\n\nBeltracchi was unlucky. The gap between titanium white's availability and its potential use by Campendonk was only a few years. On occasion, the divide is shockingly wide. Analysis of a Portrait of Saint Jerome, once attributed to the Italian master Parmigianino and sold by Sotheby's auction house in 2012 for $842,500, exposed the prevalence throughout the work of phthalocyanine green, a synthetic pigment invented in 1935, four centuries after the 16th-Century Renaissance artist worked. Artists may be visionaries, but they're not time travellers.\n\nRule 2: Keep the past present\n\nMuseum Boijmans Van Beuningan The Men at Emmaus, by Han van Meegeren (Credit: Museum Boijmans Van Beuningan)\n\nIt is uplifting to believe that one's value, as a person, is not tethered to the past. Not so with art. A painting, sculpture, or drawing without a heavy history is not, alas, more inspiring for its lack of baggage. It is suspicious. Or rather, it should be. All too often, greed can interfere in the clear-sightedness of assessing the authenticity of a painting or sculpture. Things have histories we want them to have. That was certainly the case with a succession of phoney Vermeers that issued from the workshop of a Dutch portraitist, Han van Meegeren – one of the most prolific and successful forgers of the 20th Century. Desperate to believe that the miraculous appearance of canvases, including a depiction of Christ and The Men at Emmaus, might be lost masterpieces from the same hand that made Girl with a Pearl Earring and The Milkmaid, collectors were blind to the glaring absence of any trace of the paintings' provenance – their prior ownership, exhibition history, and proof of sales. Everyone was fooled.\n\nIn authenticating the painting in the Burlington Magazine, one expert insisted \"in no other picture by the great Master of Delft do we find such sentiment, such a profound understanding of the Bible story – a sentiment so nobly human expressed through the medium of the highest art\". But it was all a lie. In a remarkable twist, Van Meegeren eventually chose to expose himself as a fraudster shortly after the end of World War Two, after being charged by Dutch authorities with the crime of selling a Vermeer – therefore a national treasure – to the Nazi official Hermann Göring. To prove his innocence, if innocence it might be called, and demonstrate that he had merely sold a worthless fake of his own forging, not a real Old Master, Van Meegeren performed the extraordinary feat of whisking up a fresh masterpiece from thin air before the experts' astonished eyes. Voilà, Vermeer.\n\nThe Hay Wain, by John Constable (Credit: BBC)\n\nMore recently, in a 2017 episode of BBC's popular arts programme Fake or Fortune?, presenter Philip Mould's long-held hunch that a painting he once sold for £35,000 was really a priceless original by the English Romantic artist John Constable – an alternative, and previously undocumented, view of the landscape artist's 1821 masterpiece The Hay Wain – was dramatically confirmed after Mould and fellow presenter Fiona Bruce excavated long-buried financial records. Having traced the painting's ownership back to a sale by the artist's son, the team recalculated the canvass true value to be £2m, proving that some pasts are worth hanging onto.\n\nRule 3: Squint\n\nArtists' gestures – their simultaneously studied and instinctive brushwork and draughtsmanship – are nothing less than fingerprints writ large across canvases and works on paper. One artist's lightness of touch and another's sturdiness of stroke are exceedingly tricky to falsify, especially if you are conscious that every twitch of your brush and jot of your pen will be scrutinised by suspicious eyes and cutting-edge equipment. Pressure under pressure is hard to maintain, an obstacle that the British forger Eric Hebborn (who died under suspicious circumstances in Rome in 1996 after a career spent counterfeiting more than 1,000 works attributed to everyone from Mantegna to Tiepolo, Poussin to Piranesi) overcame with alcohol.\n\nBy all accounts, brandy was Hebborn's tipple of choice for calming his rattling nerves. It allowed him to inhabit, without inhibition, the mind and muscle of whichever old master he was channelling. Whereas fakes from the hands of Beltracchi and Van Meegeren have since been found under closer inspection to be riddled with incoherent gestures, the fluidity of drawings falsified by the tipsy Hebborn in his heyday in the 1970s and 80s continues to confound the experts. To this day, institutions that possess works that passed through his hands refuse to accept they are all fakes, such as the Metropolitan Museum of Art's pen and ink drawing View of the Temples of Venus and of Diana in Baia from the South, a work it still insists is from the circle of Jan Brueghel the Elder. What do you think?\n\nRule 4: Go deeper\n\nGetty Images Still life with meadow flowers and roses, by Vincent van Gogh (Credit: Getty Images)\n\nWhen the analysis of pigments, provenance, and paintbrush pressure still leaves you stumped, it may be necessary to dive a little deeper. For 20 years since the 1990s, the authenticity of a still life purportedly by Vincent van Gogh was serially confirmed and refuted by experts. To some, the garish reds and submarine blues that echoed eerily from the bouquet of roses, daisies, and wildflowers didn't have the ring of truth and seemed at odds with the painter's palette. The absence of any ownership record for the painting didn't help.\n\nBut an X-ray undertaken in 2012 put questions to rest when it revealed that the artist, pinching pennies, reused a canvas on which he had created another image entirely – one to which he makes explicit reference in a letter from January 1886. \"This week\", Van Gogh remarked to his brother Theo, \"I painted a large thing with two nude torsos – two wrestlers… and I really like doing that.\" As if proleptically anticipating the ensuing scholarly wrangle over the work's authenticity that the painting would in time trigger, the static tussle of the two athletes, trapped beneath paint for over a century, not only rescued the work from unfair allegations of illegitimacy, it created a kind of fresh composite painting, a vivid compression – a freeze frame of a restless mind forever scuffling with itself, desperate to survive.\n\nRule 5: It's the little things that give you away\n\nAs a final safeguard in authenticating a work of art, run the spell check. Doing so would have saved the collector Pierre Lagrange $17m – the price he paid in 2007 for an otherwise compelling forgery of a small 12x18in (30x46cm) painting falsely attributed to the American Abstract Expressionist Jackson Pollock. Famous for his drippy style, Pollock has a surprisingly legible signature, an unmistakable \"c\" before the final \"k\". The skipped consonant would do more than expose a single forgery; it would shatter the reputation of an entire gallery.\n\nThe sloppy signature was just one of many missed red flags in works falsely attributed to Rothko, De Kooning, Motherwell and others that the Knoedler & Co gallery, one of New York's oldest and most esteemed art institutions, succeeded in selling for $80m. The fraudulent works had been supplied by a dubious dealer who claimed they came from an enigmatic collector, \"Mr X\". Just before the scandal erupted in the press, the gallery closed its doors after 165 years, while the suspected perpetrator of the fakes, a self-taught Chinese septuagenarian by the name of Pei-Shen Qian, who had operated from a forger's workshop in Queens, vanished; he later turned up in China.\n\n--\n\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.",

        "content": "Is there no such thing as Italian cuisine?\n\n28 February 2025 Share Save Thomas Fabbri Share Save\n\nGetty Images\n\nItalian cuisine may be one of the most recognised and loved in the world – often imagined as a collection of ancient recipes and local traditions preserved by skilful nonnas over the centuries. But now, a food historian is exposing common myths and false stories, arguing that the Italian cuisine as we know it is barely a few decades old.\n\nFood is no doubt an integral part of the country's culture and identity – so much so that Italians cherish Neapolitan pizza or pasta alla carbonara as much as the great historical and artistic treasures of the boot-shaped peninsula. Tales abound of centuries-old local feuds over what city has the best filled pasta, while every local cheese or cured meat is likely to boast links to the Renaissance or the Middle Ages.\n\nAlberto Grandi, food historian and professor of economic history at the University of Parma, has been debunking Italian food myths for years. In 2018, Grandi published Denominazione di Origine Inventata (Invented Designation of Origin: The Lies of Marketing on Typical Italian Products) and later launched a podcast called DOI. But it was a 2023 interview with Financial Times that put Grandi's work into the spotlight and sparked wide debates across Italy.\n\nGrandi claimed in the interview that pasta alla carbonara was invented in Italy just after World War Two using US Army provisions like bacon and powdered egg yolks, countering the common belief that the authentic recipe includes pork jowl and Roman pecorino cheese. This theory is backed by other authors, like Luca Cesari in The Discovery of Pasta: A History in Ten Dishes, but caused outrage in a country increasingly obsessed with maintaining the lore of Italian authenticity in food. The discussion evolved into a heated Italian-American dispute about the origin of the iconic dish.\n\nGrandi's latest book, La Cucina Italiana Non Esiste (Italian Cuisine Doesn't Exist), written with his podcast co-host Daniele Soffiati and published in April 2024, stirred new controversies with its provocative title.\n\nAlberto Grandi Grandi's latest book has stirred new controversies with its provocative title (Credit: Alberto Grandi)\n\nThe idea that many beloved recipes and products such as cheeses or cured meats have hundreds of years of history, Grandi and Soffiati claim, is pure fantasy. Food is constantly changing and evolving. No product or recipe has always been as we know it now, and most dishes have a shorter history than most people imagine.\n\nIs Italian cuisine really American?\n\nGrandi argues that migration is what made Italian cuisine what it is today. Millions of people left Italy in the 19th and 20th Centuries, emigrating to South America, North America and European countries. They were leaving behind a country that was poverty-stricken, where the diet was limited to a handful of products. Pellagra, a disease caused by lack of vitamin B3, was endemic in several areas of Italy at the end of the 19th Century.\n\nThe Italians who landed on New York's Ellis Island left hunger and misery behind. And it was in the \"new world\", Grandi argues, that Italian immigrants found the wealth and ingredients to create the recipes that eventually popularised Italian food worldwide.\n\nWorld's Table BBC.com's World's Table \"smashes the kitchen ceiling\" by changing the way the world thinks about food, through the past, present and future.\n\nHowever, many Italians are not familiar with this history. They might imagine that their beloved recipes were born in Italy, passed down, unchanged, from generation to generation and eventually exported abroad by Italian migrants. \"It might seem that the rest of the world didn't know how to eat until all of a sudden Italians arrived,\" says Grandi. He believes it's pure myth – popularised by social media – that nonnas taught Americans how to cook rich, genuine Italian food.\n\nPizza is the most famous example of this. Born as a cheap street food in Naples, in the 19th Century it was almost synonymous with poverty and filth. Pizza is \"a crust of leavened bread dough, oven-toasted, with a sauce of a bit of everything on top\", wrote Pinocchio author Carlo Collodi in 1886. He added that pizza had \"an air of complex filth that perfectly matches that of its vendor\".\n\nGetty Images According to Grandi, pizza was transformed in America into the dish we know and love today (Credit: Getty Images)\n\nIt was in America, says Grandi, that pizza became \"red\". While fresh tomatoes were among the original toppings, Italian immigrants to the US popularised pizza prepared with tomato sauce, a product that industrialisation made easy to access and store. And it was in the US that pizzerias really started to take off.\n\nScholars call this process \"the pizza effect\": when a product leaves its place of origin, gets profoundly transformed and then returns to its place of origin to be fully embraced in a completely different form.\n\nGrandi also angered Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese producers when he argued that parmesan has evolved for the better over the last few decades, and the Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese that was eaten in Italy 100 years ago and earlier – a smaller wheel with a black rind – is now only made in Wisconsin.\n\nInvented traditions\n\nThe shift in the Italian culinary landscape started with the rapid expansion that occurred in Italy post-WWII. The boom brought new possibilities to millions of Italians. Cars, supermarkets and refrigerators meant that people who were limited to a daily local supply could travel to restaurants, buy new products and create new recipes. Tiramisu, says Grandi, is a great example of this: a dessert created in the late 1960s that is based on supermarket ingredients and only possible with a refrigerator.\n\nWith the new products and brands also came marketing. \"Television influenced our cuisine and gastronomical identity greatly,\" says Grandi. He argues that most of Italy's gastronomic traditions were invented by food marketers. Carosello, a short television programme that aired in Italy every night from 1957 to 1977, introduced new products and brands through stories, sketches and iconic characters. Carosello provided the consumer education upon which Italian home cuisine was then built, especially by mothers and grandmothers.\n\nGetty Images Carbonara is another controversial dish, with the \"authentic recipe\" including pork jowl and Roman pecorino cheese – and no cream (Credit: Getty Images)\n\nGrandi's book explains that when industry-driven growth started to lose steam in the 1970s, Italy's economy pivoted to small companies, niche products and local excellence. Thousands of protected labels and regional products emerged and Italians doubled down on gastro-nationalism.\n\n\"Cuisine is no longer part of our identity,\" says Grandi, \"it is our identity.\" He argues that after decades of industry decline and economic stagnation, Italians have no faith in the future – that's why they \"invent the past\".\n\nIn less than a century, Grandi says, Italians went from being malnourished migrants to self-appointed custodians of ancestral traditions. The obsession for tradition has sparked searches for \"true\" recipes and \"correct\" ways of consuming food. Italians are ever more adamant to say that bolognese should be called ragù alla bolognese and never served with spaghetti. You should also never put chicken (let alone pineapple) on pizza, cook pasta alla carbonara with cream or break spaghetti in two.\n\n\"I always say that every time anyone in the world adds cream to carbonara, somebody in Rome dies,\" says Grandi. \"Italians used to get upset when they were defined as 'pizza, pasta, mandolin, mafia',\" he adds. \"Now it looks like it's us Italians feeding those stereotypes.\"\n\nAn Italian reaction to food 'blasphemy'\n\nSocial media seems to have contributed to popularising these attitudes. The X account Italians mad at food, launched in 2015, showcases comments of furious Italians who are outraged and offended by how people in other nations choose to eat \"their\" cuisine. The account even sells t-shirts with quotes like \"carbonara is not an opinion\" and \"you break spaghetti, you break my heart\".\n\nAurora Cavallo Italian cuisine is one of the most recognised and loved in the world (Credit: Aurora Cavallo)\n\nContent creators on platforms like TikTok and Instagram have popularised a genre of video content showing Italians reacting to food \"blasphemy\", with creators and celebrities vigorously showcasing their disgust and indignation – with no shortage of drama and hand gestures.\n\nThe popularity of these memes is now so widespread that people might think all Italians feel offended by people's choice of pasta sauce.\n\n\"Food as entertainment can be triggering, especially for Italians,\" says Aurora Cavallo, a young Italian chef known as Cooker Girl, with more than 1.3 million followers on both TikTok and Instagram. \"For many people in the world, food isn't just an object but something that carries a lot of significance,\" she adds. \"In my experience, Italians can be more sensitive not just towards recipes, but also towards how food is handled on screen.\"\n\nGrandi's relentless debunking of Italian food myths has made many people angry over the last few years, but he is adamant that he just wants to dispute the invented history of many products and recipes, not their quality.\n\nAs social media demonstrates, however, some Italians have convinced themselves that food dogmas are more important than innovations or accuracy.\n\n\"We don't need to make up stories about Italy's amazing products,\" says Cavallo, echoing Grandi. \"We shouldn't create a situation in which changing recipes is the end of the world because that's the opposite of how Italian food came to be.\"\n\n--\n\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.",

        "content": "Seven ways to improve your sleep according to science\n\n1 day ago Share Save Zaria Gorvett, Isabelle Gerretsen and Richard Gray Share Save\n\nGetty Images\n\nTo celebrate World Sleep Day, here's our science-based guide to getting the best slumber you can – from varying sleep with the seasons to taking inspiration from the past.\n\nIt's a typical weekday morning, and you're just beginning to stir in bed. There's light streaking through the windows, while the many chirps and caws of birds announce that it's probably time to get up… but surely that can't be right? Cue the familiar feeling of dread, as you remember a night filled with restless, low-quality sleep.\n\nAcross the world, people are struggling with insufficient sleep. In the US alone, it's been estimated that between 50 and 70 million people suffer from the affliction, and on a global scale, it has even been called an epidemic. However, there are some simple adjustments – both psychological and physical – that might help to improve the quality of your sleep. Here's our guide to having a delicious, restful slumber, inspired by the latest scientific research and some long-forgotten historical tricks.\n\nSlumber in two shifts\n\nToday, when people wake up in the middle of the night, it's not unusual to panic – after all, we tend to believe that we should sleep for a continuous eight hours. But this has not always been the case. For millennia, people had a short first sleep – and then they woke up. These little slumber-gaps were filled with an endless variety of activities, from household chores to gossip in the dark (and even the occasional murder). Then after a couple of hours, people went back to bed and slept through until the morning.\n\nThis is the forgotten ancient practise of \"two sleeps\". It was rediscovered by Roger Ekirch, a university distinguished professor of history at Virginia Tech, Virginia, in the 1990s. He believes that an awareness of the habit's historical prevalence might help to reframe the experiences of those who suffer from insomnia today – and perhaps lessen their anxiety about waking up in the night. Read more about the lost ancient habit of \"biphasic sleep\" in this article by Zaria Gorvett.\n\nVary your sleep with the seasons\n\nTry a nap\n\nIn many countries having a catnap is a daily ritual, and research shows that regular naps are good for our health. According to a 2023 study, habitual napping helps keep our brains bigger for longer and can delay brain ageing by between three to six years. A smaller brain volume has been linked to diseases such as Alzheimer's and vascular dementia.\n\nThere are also short-term benefits. Short naps, lasting no longer than 15 minutes, can immediately improve how well we perform mentally, with results lasting up to three hours after we wake up. The key to power naps is to keep them short (after 20 minutes we start drifting into deep sleep) and to make sure you have one mid-afternoon so that it doesn't disrupt your sleep at night. Read more about the health benefits of napping here.\n\nGetty Images Even in the early 20th Century, it was completely normal for people to sleep communally with friends or coworkers (Credit: Getty Images)\n\nBeware the danger of microsleeps\n\nBut not all naps are good for us. Some last mere seconds and these microsleeps can result in serious harm if they occur when you're driving. Analysis of dashcam footage from 52 drivers from a single truck company in Japan found that three quarters of them showed signs of microsleep before they were involved in a collision.\n\nMicrosleeps are more common among people who suffer from narcolepsy or people who don't get enough sleep at night. One study found that when people slept for just six hours a night for 14 days in a row, they had as many microsleeps as those who missed a whole night's sleep. If you're regularly experiencing microsleeps, it's therefore probably a sign that you're not getting enough sleep generally. Read more about the naps that only last a few seconds in this article by Claudia Hammond.\n\nGet cosy and cuddle up\n\nAs we snuggle up in bed for the night – particularly if it's just with a good podcast – we might wonder why it's so cold under the covers, or even a bit lonely.\n\nHistorically, having your own bed was highly unusual. Like it or not, most people had to share – and not just with their siblings in childhood, or as a married couple. Until the 19th Century, the majority of people would have slept communally, routinely slumbering alongside friends, colleagues and even total strangers. A good bedfellow would provide warmth and conversation into the early hours of the morning – though you might have to overlook their morning breath and contribution to a bedful of biting parasites. Read more about the forgotten habit of communal sleep in this article by Zaria Gorvett.\n\nAim for quality over quantity\n\nHow much sleep we all need can vary from person to person, with most recommendations for between seven and nine hours. But the amount of sleep you get is only one part of the equation. Quality matters as much, if not more.\n\nMost of us will have experienced feeling less refreshed after a night of tossing and turning. That's partly because when we sleep, our brains flood with cerebrospinal fluid to clear out accumulated debris and toxins. This waste-clearance system is called the glymphatic system, which works best at the same time every day. This means that when we get our shuteye is important. Syncing sleep with our natural circadian rhythms – the brain's 24-hour internal clock that regulates the cycle of alertness and sleepiness – gives rise to the best-quality rest. Read more about the importance of sleep quality in this feature by Sandy Ong.\n\nBe thankful for modern beds\n\nToday most people in the Western world are lucky enough to wake up on a soft bed, perhaps with a spring mattress or memory foam. However, things have not always been so comfortable.\n\nIn the medieval era, many people opened their eyes each morning to stuffy air and pitch-blackness – the conditions inside a \"box bed\". These popular sleeping-cupboards were completely enclosed, and helped to keep people warm at night, though they were sometimes not much bigger than a wardrobe. Slightly later there came the \"tick\" mattress, a bag of cheap materials such as straw or leaves. Unfortunately, they also provided the ideal hiding place for ticks, fleas and bedbugs. But the true inventors of a bad night's sleep might arguably have been the Victorians, who created a variety of unpleasant solutions for homeless people, from rows of coffin-beds to a rope to hang oneself over for a rest. Read more about the curious history of beds through the centuries, or top up your knowledge on why medieval people slept in cupboards, in these articles by Zaria Gorvett.\n\nSo, find yourself some bedfellows, allow for more sleep in the winter, and if you occasionally wake up in the night, consider yourself a modern pioneer of the lost ancient habit of biphasic sleep. We still can't promise that you'll be leaping out of bed on a Monday morning, but it's a start.\n\n--\n\nThis story was originally published on 15/03/2024.\n\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news delivered to your inbox every Friday.",

        "content": "The Japanese town turning cowpats into hydrogen fuel\n\n15 hours ago Share Save Paul Carter and Kitty Knowles Share Save\n\nGetty Images\n\nIn Japan, a smelly waste product is being reimagined as a potential clean fuel of the future that is powering cars and tractors.\n\nWe're being eyed suspiciously by dozens of cows. Their breath fogs cartoonishly from their nostrils.\n\nIt's a brisk morning in snowy Hokkaido, an island in the north of Japan. The cold air carries the distinct scent of cow manure – a smelly yet familiar side-effect of the region's thriving dairy industry. Accounting for 20% of the country's landmass, this island is the second-largest in Japan. It's also home to over a million cows, which produce over half of the country's milk and dairy products.\n\nWe are visiting one farm in Hokkaido that wants to transform the source of the pungent aroma in the air into something valuable. They are turning cattle manure into hydrogen.\n\nWhen it is burned, hydrogen does not emit carbon, making it an attractive alternative to fossil fuels. There are widespread hopes it could be used as a sustainable fuel to heat homes and power cars, trains, aircraft and ships in the future.\n\nBut the most common way of producing hydrogen today involves using methane – a fossil fuel piped up from deep underground, meaning it is still associated with significant carbon emissions. Hydrogen can also be produced by splitting water using electricity, but this can be expensive and is only low carbon if renewable sources of electricity are used.\n\nThe Shikaoi Hydrogen Farm, however, is using a different source – a waste product that there is no shortage of on Hokkaido. Around 20 million tonnes of cow manure is generated in Hokkaido annually. If not treated correctly, it can be an environmental burden, producing significant methane emissions as well as affecting water quality if allowed to leak into streams and rivers. So can it instead be used as a source of sustainable energy?\n\nThe Japanese farm turning cow manure into hydrogen fuel\n\n\"This project to produce hydrogen from livestock manure originated in Japan and is unique to this place,\" says Maiko Abe from Air Water, one of several companies involved in the hydrogen farm project. We are visiting the facility in Shikaoi, a town in central Hokkaido, to film an upcoming episode of the BBC's TechXplore focusing on Japan. \"Shikaoi accounts for 30% of Hokkaido’s cow waste and urine, so it has great potential for renewable energy.\"\n\nLaunched in 2015 by Japan’s Ministry of the Environment, the project aims to convert agricultural by-products into hydrogen to supply the local, rural community in a circular economy. The cow excrement and urine is collected from local dairy farms before being fed into a anaerobic digester at a central facility. Here bacteria break down the organic waste to produce biogas and a liquid fertiliser. The biogas is then purified into methane that is used to manufacture hydrogen.\n\nThe plant now has a hydrogen production capacity of 70 cubic metres (18,500 gallons), with an onsite fuelling station that can fill around 28 vehicles fitted with hydrogen fuel cells per day, says Abe. Although the fuel can be used by cars with fuel cells, the plant's fuelling station has been specially designed to accommodate agricultural vehicles such as tractors and forklift trucks. These farm vehicles are difficult to electrify with batteries due to their size and the type of work they do. The hydrogen-powered vehicles are used around the farms' sites, reducing the emissions that would otherwise be created by using other fuel sources.\n\nCattle-made-hydrogen is also stored in canisters that are transported to provide power and heat to other facilities in the area, including a local sturgeon fish farm and the nearby Obihiro Zoo.\n\nProducing and storing hydrogen at scale can require large amounts of energy and infrastructure\n\nBut hydrogen isn't without its problems. It needs to be stored in high-pressure tanks as a gas, and can be prone to leakage due to its low molecular weight. It can also degrade metal storage containers, leaving them embrittled, and is easily ignited and so requires additional safety precautions when handling it.\n\nHydrogen can also be stored as a liquid by chilling it to cryogenic temperatures of below –253C (-423F), but this can be energy intensive and requires large amounts of additional infrastructure.\n\nHydrogen has nearly three times the energy content of petrol (gasoline) when taken by mass alone. But its low molecular weight also means that by volume, the energy packed into a litre of liquid hydrogen is a quarter that of petrol. Put simply, as the lightest gas in the Universe, hydrogen takes up more space kilogram for kilogram than petrol. This means a lot more storage space is needed for hydrogen compared to fossil fuels like petrol, diesel and natural gas. It also means producing and storing it at scale can require large amounts of energy and infrastructure.\n\nBut as well as these hurdles, the hydrogen farm project in Hokkaido also faces other challenges specific to northern Japan's climate.\n\nHokkaido's subzero winters means new technologies are needed to produce the hydrogen stably without the small amounts of water vapour in the methane freezing.\n\nUsing agricultural waste as a methane source to produce hydrogen is relatively uncommon, but it ultimately uses the same process as is used to produce hydrogen from natural gas: steam reforming. Here, steam heated to 800C (1,472F) reacts with the methane to produce hydrogen, along with the byproducts carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide (CO2).\n\nThe manure must first be anaerobically digested to produce biogas, which is purified into methane before being turned into hydrogen (Credit: BBC)\n\nIn the case of cow manure, however, says Abe, the project remains sustainable as this carbon originated in the grass the cows grazed on: \"Since it was originally in the atmosphere, it is considered carbon neutral.\"\n\nIn addition, it helps to prevent the methane that would otherwise have been emitted from the manure from getting into the atmosphere, where it is a potent greenhouse gas.\n\nLeftover slurry from the manure after the biogas has been extracted is sprayed as fertiliser onto nearby fields, while formic acid – which is both used in and created by the processes – could be offered as a preservative for cattle feed, says Abe.\n\nCurrently, the electricity needed to produce and store the hydrogen comes from the national grid. But Abe says there's potential to shift to green energy, given Hokkaido’s promising sea, wind and geothermal potential, thus reducing the carbon emissions of this electricity.\n\nStill, other challenges remain. The high cost of the hydrogen compared to fossil fuels and low demand mean expanding the operation is difficult.\n\n\"The construction costs of hydrogen stations are very high,\" says Abe. \"Since hydrogen vehicles are not yet widespread, we're keeping our filling capacity low to manage initial investment. As adoption increases, we'll expand supply.\"\n\nThe Hydrogen Farm on Hokkaido is demonstrating how waste from one industry can be turned into useful fuel for others (Credit: BBC)\n\nTo encourage hydrogen vehicle adoption in the area, hydrogen prices are subsidised by the plant, matching the cost of petrol. Hydrogen refuelling stations are also being developed in major Hokkaido cities like Sapporo and Muroran.\n\nHype Meter The process to make clean hydrogen fuel from cow manure in Shikaoi Hydrogen Farm is worth paying attention to, especially as it also reduces methane which would otherwise be released from the manure. With other countries exploring how to use other types of waste, from pig dung to coconut husks, to produce hydrogen using similar processes, it appears this could be a model adaptable to other local contexts. With the scale still small, however, and costs of production high, it remains to be seen how widespread this industry can be. There are also other ways of producing fuel from cow waste, such as simply using the biogas produced from manure as a fuel itself without needing to convert it to hydrogen.\n\nJapan is the world leader in hydrogen vehicles and has invested considerably in developing the technology. But for now battery-powered electric vehicles remain cheaper than hydrogen powered ones.\n\nThough it's unlikely that cow manure alone will ever meet Japan's hydrogen demand, it could contribute significantly, and Shikaoi is creating a model for a circular economy that it hopes will show how costs can fall with the economies of scale.\n\nAnd there is growing interest in other parts of the world in using waste materials to produce hydrogen, with pig dung, poultry waste and even coconut husks having been explored as potential feedstocks. In Thailand, vehicle manufacturer Toyota is even exploring the use of hydrogen made from chicken waste to fuel its vehicles.\n\nMeanwhile, engineers at the University of Illinois Chicago in the US recently developed another promising method to make hydrogen involving manure. In their case, they used the manure, along with sugarcane waste and corn husks, to make biochar, a carbon-rich substance which vastly reduces the amount of electricity needed to convert water to hydrogen.\n\n\"We are the first group to show that you can produce hydrogen utilising biomass at a fraction of a volt,\" says Meenesh Singh, a chemical engineer at the University of Illinois Chicago who led the project.\n\nIn the southern Japanese city of Fukuoka, on Kyushu, meanwhile, another waste product is being used to produce hydrogen – and here the dung is from humans.\n\nFor more than a decade, hydrogen has been created at the city's sewage treatment plant for use in hydrogen-powered vehicles. Most recently it has been used to fuel a fleet of zero-emission rubbish trucks.\n\nAkira Miyaoka, hydrogen utilisation manager for Fukuoka City, says trucks that transport daily products are the town's main source of CO2, rather than large factories as in many other cities. \"So we are working to reduce CO2 emissions from commercial trucks,\" she says.\n\nThe sludge from the sewage treatment works in Fukuoka City is being turned into hydrogen to fuel vehicles (Credit: BBC)\n\nThe initiative started as a collaboration between Kyushu University and Fukuoka City, but now involves several major companies including Toyota.\n\n\"Sewage is something that is steadily discharged every day in the daily lives of citizens, so by making effective use of that sewage and extracting hydrogen as energy, we can achieve local production and local consumption of energy,\" says Miyaoka.\n\nGenerating hydrogen from human waste starts with water from various household sources – including showers, dishwashers and toilets – arriving at the treatment plant. As the water is cleaned, the residual sludge is kept as a source of biogas and converted into hydrogen.\n\n\"Sewage and biogas contain various impurities, so the process begins with the process of removing those impurities, which I think is a little different from other hydrogen production processes,\" says Miyaoka.\n\nIn 2024, Toyota helped the city launch Japan’s first hydrogen-powered service vehicle fleet, including ambulances, delivery vans and bin trucks. Officials at the sewage treatment plant say it is capable of producing 300kg (661lbs) of hydrogen in 12 hours – enough to fuel 30 trucks.\n\nThe rubbish trucks head out six nights each week, each collecting 1.7 tonnes (3,700lb) of rubbish, all while running silently and emission-free on the bodily waste of the people they are collecting other waste from.\n\nTurning organic waste products into hydrogen fuel is an idea gathering popularity in many parts of the world (Credit: BBC)\n\nFukuoka's sewage-to-hydrogen fuelling station has been around since 2015, and several other countries around the world are now adopting a similar approach.\n\nConcord Blue has developed waste-to-energy plants in Germany, India, Japan and the US, converting waste and biomass into hydrogen and bioenergy. Several water authorities in the UK are also working on projects to derive hydrogen from sewage.\n\nA prototype race car has also been developed using sewage-derived hydrogen in the UK. The Warwick Manufacturing Group (WMG), in partnership with Severn Trent Water, is harnessing microbes that generate hydrogen fuel from waste. They anticipate the technology could hit the mainstream within five years, despite existing challenges. (Read about how sewage-powered cars could be the future of motorsport.)\n\nOn a larger scale, aviation accounts for 2% of global carbon emissions, and researchers in a UK lab have developed jet fuel made entirely from human sewage.\n\nStill, despite the promise, all of these technologies have yet to be delivered at significant scale.\n\nWhether in rural or city landscapes, the Japanese projects we've seen during in filming are inspiring because they have the local community at their heart.\n\nWhile adoption of hydrogen cars has stalled, hydrogen truck adoption is increasing gradually and it is these larger heavier industrial vehicles that contribute most significantly per vehicle to greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nBy reimagining waste as a resource, these projects demonstrate that energy can be found in even the most unlikely of places.\n\n* Paul Carter is the presenter of TechXplore.

The alluring aroma is not surprising, given that Malaysia is gearing up to celebrate Raya, which is short for Hari Raya (the Day of Celebration in Malay), and refers to the festive occasion marking the end of Ramadan. Kek lapis is an integral part of these festivities.\n\nSeri puts her academic training as an engineer to good use in her current career as a baker. Watching her hands spreading the batter evenly on the pan, I think that baking a kek lapis is a bit like conducting a scientific experiment. Preparing this multi-layered Malaysian cake with colourful and complex patterns not only requires knowledge and skill, but also oodles of patience, an eye for precision and a steady hand.\n\nA degree in the sciences seems to come in handy for kek lapis bakers, seeing the elaborate designs that Karen Chai, another engineer turned baker, creates at her baking studio in a quiet Kuala Lumpur suburb. When Chai returned to Malaysia after studying pastry arts at Le Cordon Bleu in Paris, she decided to focus on kek lapis, using her mother's recipe as a starting point. \"Learning about the science of baking has been very useful in making kek lapis,\" she said.\n\nThis layer cake first came to Malaysia from neighbouring Indonesia through the state of Sarawak on the island of Borneo. In the mid-19th Century, Dutch colonisers introduced the plain European spit cake – made with layers of dough deposited one by one onto a cylindrical rotating spit – to the nation then known as Batavia (now Jakarta). Indonesians added local spices such as cinnamon, cloves and nutmeg and turned it into the lapis legit, often known as the thousand-layer cake.\n\nKitchen Confidante This multi-layered cake not only requires knowledge and skill, but oodles of patience (Credit: Kitchen Confidante)\n\nUpon its arrival in neighbouring Malaysia in the 1970s, Sarawakians elevated the cake to a sublime art form, involving multiple layers and numerous colours and flavours commingling into the oh-so-soft and delicious kek lapis. While the classic kek lapis often looks like a plain loaf on the outside, cutting it reveals a kaleidoscope of intricate geometric patterns.\n\nAlso called the Sarawak layer cake, kek lapis typically has a minimum of 12 layers. The cake is created by carefully adding one thin layer of batter after another onto a baking pan every few minutes, broiling (or grilling) each layer in the oven to ensure the lower layers are never burnt. The plain version alternates light and dark strips of cake batter, whereas the coloured cakes have geometric patterns that, depending on the final pattern, can involve 20 or more layers.\n\nThe final cake is cooled and then cut into strips, with different pieces reassembled using thick jam or condensed milk as adhesive. Often, multiple cakes have to be baked, and pieces from each of them are assembled to create a complex pattern. This is then wrapped up in a thin cake layer of a single colour, or arranged between two sets of plain (ie, with no colours or patterns) multi-layered cakes.\n\nIf all this sounds confusing, then imagine what it is like for the baker. Even the most experienced of them first draws these patterns on paper, clearly marking out sizes and colours, after which they get to work with the batter. A complex design can take up to eight hours to complete, with several chances for error at every step in the assembly process.\n\nCharukesi Ramadurai Seri puts her training as an engineer to good use in her current career as a baker (Credit: Charukesi Ramadurai)\n\nChai explains that as opposed to other complex layered cakes, it is particularly tough with kek lapis, since the error often becomes apparent only after the baker has finished assembling the pieces, \"so all the hard work goes down the drain\".\n\nShe then shows me photos of her mother's signature 16-piece design that was born out of an error in calculation. \"She baked a few extra layers by mistake and didn't want to throw those pieces away. She just cut that up and tried to form another block, and this design came out. So this is not something that you will find from other bakers,\" she said.\n\nBoth Seri and Chai say that the long and laborious baking process is worth the reward of seeing a perfectly executed design. \"But there are no short cuts,\" Chai warned. Indeed, seeing Seri at work, cutting and sticking these long strips together with a generous lashing of raspberry jam, brings to mind a complicated jigsaw puzzle slowly taking shape. \"It's like therapy, [but] it's also fun and creative\" she said.\n\nWhen I visited in mid-February, the bakers had been working non-stop for weeks, fulfilling Raya orders received through their social media channels. Back in their hometowns in Sarawak, kek lapis is part of every holiday celebration, including Chinese New Year, Raya, Christmas and the midyear harvest festival of Gawai Dayak, cutting across communal and religious boundaries.\n\nLapis by Seri The long and laborious baking process is worth the reward of a perfectly executed design (Credit: Lapis by Seri)\n\nSeri's long-term client and self-professed cake lover, Farazaila Wahet, said, \"This is an anytime cake for me, but of course for Raya, it is a must.\" The Sarawak native, who moved to Kuala Lumpur more than 10 years ago, said that the satisfaction she gets from kek lapis is unparalleled, because \"the texture is heavier and the taste is richer compared to any other cake.\"\n\nKek lapis is available in many flavours, such as chocolate, vanilla, strawberry, red velvet and pandan (a tropical plant with a strong aroma, commonly used in Southeast Asian cooking). Even popular malted drinks like Horlicks and Milo are used for flavouring. And now, artisanal bakers like Seri and Chai are trying to modernise this traditional cake to make it relevant to younger generations, while also staying true to the original recipe.\n\nSeri, for instance, makes exquisite chocolate batik art on the top layer to make her cakes even more attractive. \"Batik is traditional to Malaysia, so is kek lapis, and I love to combine the two to create this new version,\" she said.\n\nChai keeps experimenting not just with more complicated patterns, but also new ingredients and flavour pairings. In the past, she has created gluten-free kek lapis using coconut flour with peanut butter topping, and another unique version with fig, apricot and cinnamon.\n\nBaking a good kek lapis requires a lot of time and high-quality ingredients, which means that they are also expensive, with prices going up to RM300 (roughly £50) or more for a square, one-kilogram cake. But thankfully for the small-batch bakers, this traditional cake is constantly in demand from individual clients and it's also gaining in popularity as corporate gifts and wedding favours.\n\nThese bakers are on a mission to maintain this Sarawak culinary tradition, despite all the long hours and thin margins. As Seri said, \"Every time I make a kek lapis, it feels like a piece of home to me.\"\n\nBBC.com's World's Table \"smashes the kitchen ceiling\" by changing the way the world thinks about food, through the past, present and future.\n\n---\n\nJoin more than three million BBC Travel fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter and Instagram.",

But on a crisp November morning on Spain's leafy Valencian coastline, Vicente Todolí is showing me the secret side of citrus – and it's unlike anything I've seen on supermarket shelves.\n\nThe most weird and wonderful specimens are arranged on a table in his Sun-soaked orchard. There's one shaped like an octopus with fat tentacles, a wart-covered citron the size of a newborn baby and a colourful pear-shaped fruit splattered in a tie-dye of green and yellow.\n\nThey're not at all what I was expecting, and they're not entirely safe, either. \"You will get burned,\" Todolí warns, pointing at a grass-greenbergamot. The oil is phototoxic, causing the skin to burn if it's exposed to UV light (it isn't dangerous to eat, but it is very acidic). \"Want to taste?\" he asks. I hold a slice up to the sun and eye it suspiciously; the golden segments light up like a stained-glass window. I tip my head back and squeeze drops into my mouth, being careful not to touch my lips. Eye-watering acidic needles stab my tongue. I'm reeling and wiping away tears, but Todolí is already on to the next fruit, squeezing the pearly contents of a finger lime into my hand. The little balls pop like lime-flavoured caviar in my mouth.\n\nThere are hundreds more unusual fruits to try at Todolí Citrus Fundació, a not-for-profit farm dedicated to researching and preserving rare citrus varieties. Hidden on a sleepy street in the town of Palmera, this is Todolí's passion project. He was born and raised on this farm, going on to study art history before serving as director at esteemed galleries such as Tate Modern in London and Milan's Pirelli HangarBicocca, where he works today.\n\nLucy Lovell Todolí Citrus Fundació is home to more than 500 varieties of citrus (Credit: Lucy Lovell)\n\nNow, Todolí considers himself a fifth-generation orange farmer. He's fiercely protective of his old family farm, which is one of the reasons Todolí Citrus Fundació came to be. In 2010, a project was launched to raze Palmera's orange groves to make room for real estate. He tried to derail it through official channels and lost. \"I was called a romantic enemy of progress,\" he recalls. But Todolí did not desist. Changing tack, he began buying plots of land. Some were abandoned patches of weeds and others were established orchards. He acquired around 4.5 hectares in total, an impenetrable fortress of precious farmland. \"When I started it was a matter of urgency, I had to save the land,\" he says.\n\nAround the same time, Todolí was working as cultural advisor to Ferran Adrià, former head chef of the iconic (and sadly closed) El Bulli (once-billed as the world's best restaurant). One day, the pair visited a garden on the outskirts of Perpignan which had more than 400 types of citrus trees, some exceedingly rare. The south of France is a little too chilly for citrus, so the trees are planted in pots. In summer they bask outside, and in October the gardeners heave them into a greenhouse to keep warm. During their visit Todolí asked, \"How is it possible that they have done this amazing project with citrus, and in my area no one has done it?\" Adrià replied: \"Why not do it yourself?\"\n\nWorld's Table BBC.com's World's Table \"smashes the kitchen ceiling\" by changing the way the world thinks about food, through the past, present and future.\n\nTodolí was inspired. He knew Palmera had the perfect microclimate for citrus; there would be no need for pots. Todolí Citrus Fundació is 3km from the sea and backed by a ripple of mountains. When the warm wind travels across the Mediterranean Sea, it becomes humid, and when it hits the mountains, it drops bathtubs of rain. The water trickles down the mountainside to Palmera, absorbing organic matter along the way. The fertile, nutrient-rich soil is known as alluvial soil, and Todolí is blessed with buckets of it.\n\nLucy Lovell Vicente Todolí was inspired by history's most illustrious citrus gardens (Credit: Lucy Lovell)\n\nPalmera's crisp mornings also help to balance the flavour of fruit, Todolí explains. \"In January it's one or two degrees in the morning and around 20C in the afternoon. That's what creates the balance between acidity and sweetness. If you're in Florida, for example, it's too hot. They're sweeter but they're bland. In Japan, it's colder so they have more acidity. Here and Sicily are the perfect areas for citrus.\"\n\nPlan your trip: Tours cost €15 for adults and €10 for children up to 15 and are available from around November to April (depending on when the fruit matures). Book at todolicitrusfundacio.org. The closest airport is Valencia Airport; it takes around an hour to drive from Valencia city centre to Todolí Citrus Fundació.\n\nFor inspiration, he turned to history's most illustrious citrus gardens. He studied the Italian gardens of the Medici family in the 1500s and opulent Arabic palaces like the Alhambra. \"For the Arabs, gardens appealed to the senses. It was a paradise on Earth, an immersive experience,\" says Todolí.\n\nLikewise, the sights, smells and sounds of Todolí Citrus Fundació seduce visitors. Chirping locusts the size of frogs hop in the mallow and honeybees buzz between wildflowers. While licking sour juice from fingertips, there's a soundtrack of water trickling along an ancient Arabic irrigation route and the frenetic chirping of goldfinches in the aviary. The zesty scent of lemons perfumes visitors' hands for the rest of the day.\n\nThere are other farms nearby, but they don't look like this. The surrounding countryside is an orderly grid of single-crop fields, with rows upon rows of orange trees. Spain is the world's leading exporter of citrus, shipping around 4 million tonnes a year. In order to produce such vast quantities, most farms lean heavily on mono-cropping, which can leave soil depleted and plants more vulnerable to disease outbreaks. Todolí Citrus Fundació, on the other hand, is a genetic diversity bank; a motley bunch of more than 500 varieties. Some of the rarest plants include ancient Valencian orange trees used as rootstock. The grafts were made around 150 years ago and Todolí cut the scion back to allow the roots to grow freely.\n\n\"It's like Jurassic Park,\" he says. \"We can see resurrected varieties that were in extinction.\"\n\nLucy Lovell Tours include an exploratory walk and a tasting of seasonal citrus fruits (Credit: Lucy Lovell)\n\nAs well as tours of the farm, the garden comes alive with events throughout the year. Poets read stanzas on a stage decorated with lemons at the annual Poecítrics festival (14 June 2025), while Cine de Vanguardia is a celebration of experimental cinema.\n\nBack on the tour, and Todolí's right-hand man Ton Gjekaj is waiting at the final tasting table. He has cut the last slices of fruit. There are wedges of passionfruit-tasting trifoliate orange, apple-sour calamansi and rosewater-scented Palestinian sweet lime, still warm from the Sun. I greedily eat them all, popping whole carpels into my mouth. I try to jot down the flavours but by now my notepad is covered in juice, my camera's buttons sticky.\n\nPeople think that citrus is what they see in the supermarkets. They don't know that it started eight million years ago – Vicente Todolí\n\nThere's just time to peep inside The Laboratory, a high-tech kitchen and library. This is a hub of experimentation, used by experts from around the world who come to play with Todolí's extraordinary pantry. Chefs make ice cream from bergamots; bartenders pickle lemon rind for gin and tonics; and perfumiers extract oils from nearly extinct oranges.\n\nAgustina Basilico Miara, head of beverage at London's Toklas restaurant, has visited three times and says she always goes home with new ideas. \"It's incredible. Every time we go, we take as many people as possible from the restaurant,\" Miara says. \"Especially after being in cloudy London, to arrive in an explosion of colours is super inspiring.\"\n\nLucy Lovell Buddha's Hand is named for its resemblance to the fingers shown on many Buddha representations (Credit: Lucy Lovell)\n\nMiara uses leftover peel from the kitchen (like fragrant blood orange and chandler red pomelo) to make a tea, which she turns into a syrup. She uses it for a variety of cocktails, like her zingy take on the classic whisky highball. \"We've also done a martini with chinotto. The vodka is infused with chinotto and then we candy the fruit,\" Miara says. \"It adds another layer, like an olive brine element to the flavour, it's very aromatic.\"\n\nAfter flicking through some books (every mention of citrus has been bookmarked, resulting in a pleasing rainbow of Post-it notes along the spines) we conclude the tour by tasting marmalade. The most delicious is made from Borneo lemon – not technically a lemon, but a cross between a pomelo and a key lime. Delicate and creamy, the marmalade tastes like well-balanced lemon curd.\n\nFor Todolí, this open-air gallery is his legacy. It's a place to challenge preconceptions, encourage biodiversity and foster local culture. \"For me, it's like a museum where you don't have to refresh the collection because it changes every day,\" he says. \"People think that citrus is what they see in the supermarkets. They don't know that it started eight million years ago, that it's one of the oldest fruits in the world. It has been so important in literature, poetry and art.\"\n\nTodolí can see the art of citrus – and from his otherworldly orchard, he's helping the rest of the world to see it too.\n\n--\n\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.",

        "content": "Om Ali: An 'unforgettable' sweet with a sinister history\n\n2 days ago Share Save Soumya Gayatri Share Save\n\nAlamy (Credit: Alamy)\n\nAs millions of people break their Ramadan fast, many believers around the world reach for a wildly popular dish tied to an unbelievable legend.\n\nOn a hot and sultry August evening in 2011, I sat at a table in my favourite restaurant in Kuwait City, facing the calm waters of the Persian Gulf, waiting for my iftar platter to arrive. The elaborate meal – consisting of fresh juices, stuffed dates, vegetable samosas, lamb pilaf, shish tawook (a marinated chicken kebab), local bread, coffee and desserts – was delicious.\n\nYet, what still lingers on my tongue and in my mind more than a decade later isn't the delightful crunch of the samosa or the sapid juiciness of the shish tawook but the sweet taste of Om Ali, a simple-but-flavourful Egyptian dessert with a surprisingly dark history.\n\nFlash forward to 2025 and I'm standing in a small confectionery store in downtown Cairo, sharing another bowl of Om Ali, this time with my 12-year-old son, and I still can't stop drooling over the dish, despite having tried it in every Middle Eastern city I've visited during the last 14 years.\n\nSoumya Gayatri The author seeks out Om Ali in every Middle Eastern city she visits (Credit: Soumya Gayatri)\n\n\"A good bowl of Om Ali is unforgettable,\" says Nermine Mansour, a former Egyptian diplomat-turned-food writer and founder of the food blog, Chez Nermine. \"It is the perfect balance of flavours, textures and nutrition – the star of Egyptian cuisine,\" she adds.\n\nOm Ali (also known as Umm Ali or Oum Ali) is a decadent bread pudding made from spice-infused milk, puff pastry, roasted nuts and sugar. Traditionally baked in a deep clay dish for about 20-25 minutes, it has a crunchy, caramelised coating at the top and a silky, creamy layer at the bottom, giving the dessert a unique texture. According to Mansour, the creaminess of the milk, the juiciness of the soaked puff pastry, the crunch from the nuts and the sweet earthiness of lent by the clay pot come together to give Om Ali a rare appeal, making it one of the most popular desserts in Egypt.\n\nWhere to find Om Ali Although Om Ali is available at all major cafes and bakeries in Egypt throughout the year, the variety and volume are staggering during Ramadan. Some of the best places to sample authentic Om Ali in Cairo are El Malky, Simonds Bakery & Café and Nola Bakery.\n\nOm Ali is also a favourite across the Middle East, particularly during Ramadan and Eid celebrations when dessert consumption skyrockets. Earlier this year, B Laban, one of the fastest-growing Middle Eastern dessert companies, posted a video of Om Ali on Instagram and thousands of people quickly swooned over it.\n\n\"I get why Om Ali is so popular. It is affordable, easy to digest and can be prepared quickly using ingredients available at home, making it equally accessible to the rich and the poor,\" says Moustafa Omran, an Egyptologist and my local tour guide in Cairo. \"Despite the fame of this dish, a question always lingers in the minds of [Om Ali] lovers: who is Ali and who is his mother, after whom this dish is named?\" Omran points out, drawing my attention to the dessert's name.\n\nAlamy Om Ali is especially popular during Ramadan, and is one of Egypt's most beloved sweets (Credit: Alamy)\n\nWith my mouth stuffed with soaked puff pastry and my mind going nuts over the creaming pudding at El Malky, one of the most famous dessert chains serving Om Ali in Cairo, I cannot help but agree.\n\nOm Ali, which means \"Mother of Ali\" in Arabic, is an admittedly unusual name for a dessert. Yet, what's even more unusual, as many Egyptians tell me, is that it is rumoured to be named after a murderer.\n\nOm Ali was the first wife of the first sultan of the Mamluk dynasty, which ruled Egypt from the mid-13th to early 16th Centuries. In 1250, her then-husband, Izz Al-Din Aybak overthrew the Ayyubid dynasty and established the Mamluk reign in Egypt, marrying Al-Durr, the last Ayyubid queen, to solidify his rule. The marriage was merely a political union and Al-Durr had frequent disagreements with Aybak before finally deciding to murder him as he took a bath.\n\nIn a bizarre turn of events, Om Ali decided to avenge her husband's death by beating Al-Durr to death with wooden clogs. After killing Al-Durr, Om Ali instructed her cook to bake something special to commemorate her success and the eponymous dessert was allegedly born and named in her honour.\n\nAlamy Om Ali is rumoured to hark back to the Mamluk dynasty – and a bizarre murder (Credit: Alamy)\n\nAs surprised as I am to learn that Om Ali's origins may be rooted in murder and betrayal, deeper research reveals that the dish's origins are even more complex, and still baffle historians.\n\n\"There are no historical records that tell us if the dessert Om Ali is connected to the murder of Al-Durr,\" says Dr Mennat-Allah El Dorry, a food historian at the American University in Cairo. \"Although we know for sure that Queen Om Ali killed Al-Durr, we do not have any concrete evidence linking the dessert to the murder… I have absolutely no idea how the narrative came about and how the dessert got its name.\"\n\nWorld's Table BBC.com's World's Table \"smashes the kitchen ceiling\" by changing the way the world thinks about food, through the past, present and future.\n\nFurther, the oldest recorded recipe for Om Ali comes from a more recent 19th-Century Arabic cookbook titled Kitāb nasị̄hạt al-anām fī hụsn al-tạʻām, which adds another layer of mystery to the dish's origins and nomenclature.\n\nYet, according to Mansour, the 13th-Century Om Ali narrative may hold some truth. \"Egyptians have eaten a thin phyllo bread called roqaq since ancient times,\" she says. According to the book The Pharaoh's Kitchen by Magda Mehdawy and Amr Hussein, roqaq has been a staple at Nubian banquets since the 3rd Century BCE. \"So, it is quite possible that Om Ali's cook used the leftover roqaq in the palace and baked it with milk and nuts to create the iconic dessert that we all love today.\"\n\nAlamy Om Ali is also known as Egyptian bread pudding or Egyptian bread roqaq (Credit: Alamy)\n\nDespite the dessert's muddled origins, its connection to the killer of Al-Durr live on in Egyptian popular culture. Today, the name Om Ali is synonymous with good triumphing over evil – in this case, the unjust queen.\n\n\"We love it because of its association with the story of the victory of justice over injustice,\" says Omran. \"Also, we [Egyptians] love stories; therefore, this dish has gained immense popularity,\" he explains. The legend continues to endure in social media, food blogs and television, such as the 2004 popular drama series Abbas Al Abiad Fi Al Yawm Al Aswad, in which famous Egyptian actor Yehia El-Fakharany recounts the legend of Om Ali to his onscreen family.\n\nThe popularity of Om Ali swells during Ramadan, as sugar-based desserts take centre stage in iftar meals around the globe, providing instant nourishment to a fasting body that has run out of glucose. \"In addition to sugar, Om Ali contains protein and calcium from milk, vitamins and fibre from nuts, and carbohydrates from bread,\" Mansour points out. \"That's why, [Om Ali] is a guilty pleasure you can easily justify. It feels like a warm hug in a clay pot filled with goodness,\" she adds. (A calorie analysis reveals that Om Ali has fewer calories compared to other Middle Eastern desserts like kunefe and baklava.)\n\nBesides, Om Ali is an easy dessert to make. \"It requires only simple ingredients found in every Egyptian kitchen,\" Mansour adds. Depending on the size of the iftar parties, this dish can be scaled up or down, making it a favourite among chefs and home cooks during Ramadan and Eid.\n\nAlamy The dish provides simple, sugary nourishment to those during Ramadan (Credit: Alamy)\n\nOm Ali holds a special place in Egyptian cuisine because it is simple, nutritious and evokes feelings of warmth and goodness. \"The creaminess of the pudding, the crunch of roasted nuts and the story of the victory of good over bad – a bowl of Om Ali just feels right and makes me happy after a long day of fasting,\" says Omran.\n\n--\n\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.",

        "content": "Lithuania's fermented drink to ward off a cold\n\n12 hours ago Share Save Michelle Tchea Share Save\n\nGetty Images\n\nSweet, tangy and packed with probiotics, gira has long been a go-to winter tonic – and is now making a comeback in craft breweries and kombucha-style artisanal brands.\n\nWhen Tadas Eidukevičius was crafting his latest winter menu at Demoloftas in Vilnius, Lithuania, the Michelin-starred chef turned to an unassuming staple: the turnip. But rather than deconstructing the simple ingredient beyond recognition, Eidukevičiusd slow-roasted and lightly smoked the root vegetable before serving it with gira, Lithuania's traditional fermented beverage.\n\n\"I wanted to create a dish that highlights the traditions of Lithuania on a plate, and using gira to make the glaze brought so many flavours together without over-complicating things – it was a no brainer,\" says Eidukevičius. \"The gira adds acid, sweetness and a pleasant tang, which gives more complexity to the otherwise simple vegetable.\"\n\nWhile Eidukevičius' creative approach no doubt helped capture the attention of Michelin inspectors, gira remains largely absent from Lithuania's fine-dining scene. Instead, the naturally fermented drink is a household staple, enjoyed chilled in summer or as a soothing remedy for a sore throat. Once brewed in homes out of necessity – particularly during Soviet times when things were scarce – in recent years, its increased popularity has led it to be mass produced and sold by the can in soft-drink aisles of supermarkets and corner shops throughout the country.\n\nDating back to ancient times, gira is more commonly known as kvass across north-eastern Europe where it can be made with grains, fruits or vegetables, and is widely popular in Baltic and Slavic countries where fermentation traditions run deep.\n\nIeva Šidlaitė The fermentation process produces a slightly carbonated drink that's full of \"good\" bacteria (Credit: Ieva Šidlaitė)\n\n\"Traditionally, [in Lithuania] it was a homemade drink using old rye bread because it was a smart way to use up leftovers,\" says Tomas Josas, a beer historian and 2023 beer sommelier champion of Lithuania who grew up drinking his grandparents' homebrewed gira. \"Fermentation not only preserved nutrients but also lowered the pH, killing harmful bacteria – meaning kvass was often safer to drink than water.\"\n\nA traditional recipe involves soaking toasted or dried-out rye bread in hot water to extract the flavour. Once cooled, yeast and maybe sugar in the form of raisins are added to kickstart the natural fermentation process. It is then cooled, strained and bottled, to be consumed within three to five days. The result is a slightly tart, mildly effervescent drink with an ABV of up to 1.2%, akin to traditionally brewed kombucha, and contains healthy probiotics that benefit gut health and immunity. In Lithuania, traditionalists see it as a tonic for the common cold because it can be made with honey, ginger and other herbs as an immunity booster.\n\nWorld's Table BBC.com's World's Table \"smashes the kitchen ceiling\" by changing the way the world thinks about food, through the past, present and future.\n\n\"When I was little, my grandmother would make gira for Easter and Christmas as a festive drink but I also remember drinking gira when I was sick – consuming it more commonly as a natural remedy,\" explained Ieva Šidlaitė, a cultural historian and the author of Naturally Fermented who teaches fermentation classes on her farm outside Vilnius. \"In the 20th Century, when sugar was available to everyone, it became sweet,\" she added. \"Before this time, it was completely fermented and a sour liquid without any bubbles. It was mostly used to acidify food, make soups and also sauces because in our culture, food is dominated by a sour taste.\"\n\nJosas agrees. \"Many believed kvass was good for digestion and immunity, thanks to its probiotics. My great-grandparents made traditional homebrewed gira, very different from today's commercial versions [that are sweeter]. It had a funky, tangy flavor from lactobacillus – like sauerkraut has, but in liquid form. I wasn't a fan as a child since it lacked sugar, but once I got into beer, I learned to love its complexity,\" he says.\n\nIeva Šidlaitė Kvass is often made with fruit or vegetables, with beetroot being a popular option (Credit: Ieva Šidlaitė)\n\nThe early '80s is what Josas describes as \"the golden age of gira\" with mobile barrels selling it on every street corner during summer. However as global soft drinks like Coke flooded the Baltic market, gira struggled to compete, losing its appeal and audience. To survive, manufacturers began mass-producing the drink using sugar for appeal and cheap malt extract to speed up the process, shifting it closer to soda than traditional fermentation.\n\n\"Kvass lacks a strong identity, a clear drinking culture or an image that appeals to younger generations,\" says Josas, noting that while gira shares the same probiotic qualities of kombucha, it has never been \"hyped\" as a health drink. But things are changing, he says. Artisanal gira brands are reviving traditional methods, tapping into kombucha's success.\n\nOne of Lithuania's largest producers of beer and gira is Gubernija Brewery in northern Lithuania who, despite their large-scale production, still make their gira traditionally: with black grain bread. However, the 360-year-old brewery is also adapting for modern palates.\n\n\"We have created different varieties of kvass to widen our audience in the last few years,\" says Jogailė Čojūtė, export specialist for Gubernija Brewery. \"For example, our white wheat bread gira is aimed at younger consumers who like trendy soft drinks. The taste is much milder. Another popular item we have is the dark rye bread gira with hemp and hints of lime; it is a unique and refreshing twist to our traditional recipe and proves that gira really can stand the test of time.\"\n\n\"In 2024, we observed an 18% increase in the sales volume of owned gira brands compared to the previous year,\" she continues, \"while export sales volume grew by 47%.\"\n\nIeva Šidlaitė In Lithuania, traditionalists see gira as a tonic for the common cold (Credit: Ieva Šidlaitė)\n\nGlobally, interest in non-alcoholic beverages and low-ABV drinks is soaring, and kvass is catching on. In the US, breweries, bakeries and even restaurants have released their own versions of kvass with great success. Dan Woods of Beaver Brewing Company in Pennsylvania produces kvass in his nanobrewery; while at Honey's in East Williamsburg in New York, kvass made an appearance on tap. Made with chunks of toasted dark sourdough rye bread which were left to ferment, the slightly tart drink was sweetened with a touch of honey and also served as a cocktail.\n\nWhere to try Gira In Vilnius, traditional restaurants like Lokys have kvass on the menu; it pairs incredibly well with a plate of smoked cold cuts. Elsewhere around the city, small batch gira made traditionally with bread can be found in health food shops as well as popular city bakery Kmyninė, which uses its leftover sourdough rye.\n\nIn Australia, a string of bakeries have collaborated with local craft breweries to make stronger alcoholic versions, such as Three Mills Bakery in the nation’s capital, Canberra; while in Leeds in the UK, Northern Monk releases a seasonal kvass each year.\n\nWhile some international versions exceed 4% ABV, for Lithuanians, it remains a drink with cultural significance that should only be fermented to 1.2% ABV at most. \"It should not be considered a direct substitute for beer,\" says Čojūtė.\n\nInstead, Eidukevičius says, the beauty of the unassuming drink lends itself to a nice refresher anytime of the day with its sweet, acidic, tangy and even funky taste.\n\n\"Gira, for all its refreshing qualities, can be a bit of a mischievous drink,\" Eidukevičius adds. \"There's a running joke in Lithuanian households about 'gira explosions' because it ferments in closed containers where enormous pressure can build up like a bottle of Champagne. There's nothing quite like walking into a cellar and finding gira sprayed across the walls and ceiling like some kind of fizzy, rye-bread-scented geyser. It's a testament to how alive this drink is. It's a reminder that we're working with natural processes, and sometimes, those processes have a mind of their own.\"\n\nSo, if you find yourself in Lithuania looking for a low-alcohol beverage, consider a glass of gira. \"Drinking gira is a connection to our land and to the traditions that have shaped Lithuania's culture,\" says Eidukevičius.\"It has a long tradition in my beautiful country as more than just a beverage; it's a part of our cultural heritage and a link to our ancestors' traditions.\"\n\n--\n\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.",

        "content": "An ethical guide to hiking the Inca Trail\n\n3 days ago Share Save Heather Jasper Share Save\n\nAlamy (Credit: Alamy)\n\nThe fabled route leading to Machu Picchu is one of the world's most jaw-droppingly beautiful treks – but it's also plagued by controversies that travellers can avoid.\n\nAt 2,840m above sea level, the trail leaves the rushing Urubamba River that carves Cusco's Sacred Valley and winds its way uphill. It ascends past Andean cloud forests to Warmiwañusca, the infamous \"Dead Woman's Pass\" at 4,215m, before descending to the ancient Inca citadel of Machu Picchu, one of the Seven New Wonders of the World. This is the legendary Inca Trail, South America's most popular hike and one of the world's most jaw-droppingly beautiful treks. In an effort to protect the path, which was designed and built more than 600 years ago by Inca engineers, the Peruvian government limits the number of passes available to visitors during the trail's March-to-January opening (the trail opens 31 March 2025). As a result, every year permits for the 43km hike sell out quickly as travellers try to secure one of the roughly 200 daily passes allocated daily for tourists.\n\nIronically, the Inca Trail's popularity contrasts with frequent protests that often leave hundreds of travellers stranded, as the porters tasked with hauling hikers' gear across the mountains petition for better working conditions. While these protests rarely reach English-language publications, the Porters' Voice Collective (an organisation aiming to elevate the rights of Inca Trail workers) released a documentary in 2024 detailing these struggles.\n\nAlamy Inca trail hikers are required to hire porters who often carry 30kg or more up steep mountains (Credit: Alamy)\n\nHow can such an idyllic place hike generate so much conflict? According to the trail's Indigenous guides, the problem is a lack of law enforcement governing porters' working conditions.\n\nSince mules are prohibited on the Inca Trail because their hooves would destroy the ancient stone paving and stairs, trekkers are required to hire porters to haul their camping equipment. Porters' days often begin at 05:00 and end after 22:00. While a 2022 law mandates that porters receive s/650 Peruvian Nuevo Soles (£140 or $176) for the four-day trek, very few trekking agencies abide by this and pay as little as s/350 (£75 or $95) per trek. Since the law was passed, trekking agency lawyers have been fighting it, and in the meantime refusing to pay the legal wage.\n\nInca Trail permits Trekking independently on the Inca Trail isn't allowed. Instead, travellers must obtain a permit and hire porters through a licensed tour operator such as Evolution Treks Peru or Intrepid Travel.\n\nIn addition to trekking agencies not compensating porters properly, many companies require their porters to carry more weight than the 20kg maximum that is also stipulated in the law.\n\n\"Most [male] porters carry about 30kg, and I've seen 40kg packs,\" says Natalia Amao Huillca, who has been guiding travellers along the Inca Trail since 2007. \"About 80% of the injuries I see in porters are knee injuries. The others are mostly back injuries. They frequently ask me for pain pills in the evening.\"\n\nHeather Jasper Inca Trail guide Shandira Arque Lucana says companies often cut deals with those tasked with enforcing porter weight limits (Credit: Heather Jasper)\n\nAccording to Cenovia Quispe Flores, who has worked as a porter for Evolution Treks Peru since 2018, \"The law for women is 15kg,\" but she says she has seen women working for other companies carrying 25 to 30kg. To get around weight limits, many companies either send gear around the first checkpoint where porters' backpacks are weighed or simply pay those off who enforce these limits.\n\n\"In theory, the checkpoint is strict, but in practice, it's not strict for everybody,\" explains Shandira Arque Lucana, who has guided hikers on the Inca Trail since 2016. She says that big companies cut deals with people working the checkpoints but that small companies don't have enough influence to evade enforcement.\n\nThoughtful Travel Want to travel better? Thoughtful Travel is a series on the ways people behave while away, from ethics to etiquette and more.\n\nEven companies that want to play by the rules can find themselves stymied by the strict limit of 500 total people (which includes 300 non-tourist porters and guides) allowed on the trail each day. Sometimes there is extra weight but no way to add an extra porter. \"I've seen many porters working with hernias, bad knees and ankle problems,\" says Pedro, a guide who asked not to be identified by his real name. \"I know a porter who became an alcoholic because he couldn't get treatment for his injured knee. He still works on the Inca Trail, and he dulls the pain with cañazo (a liquor made from sugarcane)\".\n\nHeather Jasper Guide Liz Montesinos Pumayalle notes there are other treks besides the Inca Trail leading to Machu Picchu that don't rely on porters (Credit: Heather Jasper)\n\nPorters also suffer from dehydration. They drink unclean water from streams and handwashing taps near bathrooms, though paying customers get filtered and boiled water. With all this in mind, what should travellers know if they want to trek South America's most famous ruins in a responsible, ethical way? According to local guides, the first thing to remember is that there are other treks that lead to Machu Picchu. \"The Inca Trail is not the only option,\" says Liz Montesinos Pumayalle, who has worked as a guide on the Inca Trail for eight years and notes that mules are used instead of porters on all other trails. \"People who want to connect with Indigenous communities should hike the Lares Trek. The Salkantay Trek (which has two options that connect to Machu Picchu directly and other routes that connect indirectly) is best for people who want to sleep in eco-domes or lodges, rather than tents.\"\n\nAmao Huillca notes that companies who hire many female porters often treat their staff better than those who only have one or none. \"I like working with porter teams that are half women and have a woman head porter,\" she says. \"Most companies send one or two token women porters.\" She says that because female porters are more inclined to go to a doctor when they're injured than their male colleagues, tourists who request women porters are more likely to trek with healthier porters.\n\nHeather Jasper Many travellers vie for the 200 daily Inca Trail permits allocated to visitors (Credit: Heather Jasper)\n\n\"One way to ensure that porters are treated and paid well is for there to be women porters,\" echoes Inca Trail guide Edson Lucana Mejía. He explains that it has historically been common for male porters to sleep in the dining tent, which doesn't have a floor and is often muddy. Women usually insist on individual tents, so in a team with more women, you can be sure that more porters have a decent place to sleep. Marco Antonio Carrión, who has been guiding treks on the Inca Trail for 20 years offers other recommendations. \"Look for photos of porters with ergonomic backpacks and for reviews that mention something about how porters are treated,\" he says. \"If a company is sustainable and treats the porters well, it will show in the online reviews.\"\n\nThe lighter, the better Many operators still require porters to carry heavy canvas tents, tables and chairs. When considering a company, ask how much their camping equipment weighs and if they have lightweight options.\n\nIn addition, Carrión says travellers should ask if porters are required to wear their employer's uniforms. While it may be a small detail in some cultures, for many Indigenous Peruvians, traditional Quechua clothing is an important part of their identity. Despite allegations of mistreatment by certain Inca Trail operators, many guides and porters not only feel fulfilled, but also fortunate to work in such a stunning natural setting. \"I love this work\" says Quispe Flores. \"I like the mountains and working with my friends, the other women porters. Working in agriculture is harder and doesn't pay.\"\n\nAlamy \"Without porters, there is no Inca Trail\" (Credit: Alamy)\n\nWhile it isn't always easy to determine which companies follow the law and which don't, Lucana Mejía has one message he wishes the many thousands of travellers hoping to hike the fabled route will remember: \"Without porters, there is no Inca Trail.\"\n\n--\n\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.",

Their initial trip to the International Space Station onboard the Boeing Starliner spacecraft was scheduled to be just eight days in June 2024. But after technical problems with the spacecraft meant it had to return to Earth without them, their stay in space has been longer than expected.\n\nOf course, neither are new to the rigours of space travel. They are both experienced astronauts. But any extended time in the strange, low gravity environment of space is likely to have affected their bodies. To understand how, we need to look at those who have stayed for longer.\n\nThe longest single spaceflight by an American to date was by Nasa astronaut Frank Rubio after he spent 371 days living aboard the American-football-field-sized collection of modules and solar panels that make up the ISS.\n\nHis time in orbit – which surpassed the previous US record of 355 consecutive days – was extended in March 2023 after the spacecraft he and his crewmates had been due to fly home in developed a coolant leak. He eventually came home in October 2023. The extra months in space allowed Rubio to clock up a total of 5,963 orbits around the Earth, travelling 157.4 million miles (253.3 million km).\n\nEven so, he was still around two months short of the record for the longest ever spaceflight by a human – Russian cosmonaut Valeri Polyakov spent 437 days onboard the Mir Space Station in the mid 1990s.\n\nAnd in September 2024, two Russian cosmonauts – Oleg Kononenko and Nikolai Chub – broke the record for the longest stay on the ISS after spending 374 days in orbit. The pair departed the ISS in the Soyuz MS-25 spacecraft along with US astronaut Tracy Dyson, who had spent six months onboard. With a huge grin on his face, Kononenko gave a double thumbs up as he was helped from the re-entry capsule after it bumped back to Earth in a cloud of dust near the remote town of Dzhezkazgan on the Kazakhstan Steppe. He now also holds the record for the longest cumulative time in space – a total of 1,111 days in orbit.\n\nKononenko and Chub travelled more than 158 million miles during their 5,984 orbits of the Earth in the latest mission to the ISS. But spending so much time in the low gravity environment of the space station took a toll on their bodies, so they had to be lifted out of the capsule by the recovery teams.\n\n'It's good to be home,' after 371 days in space\n\nRubio's own extended trip in space provided valuable insights into how humans can cope with long-duration spaceflight and how best to counteract the problems it can present. He is the first astronaut to participate in a study examining how exercising with limited gym equipment can affect the human body.\n\nWhile the results have yet to be published, it is information that will prove vital as humans set their sights on sending crews on missions to explore deeper into the Solar System. A return journey to Mars, for example, is expected to take around 1,100 days (just over three years) under current plans. The spacecraft they will travel in will be far smaller than the ISS, meaning smaller lightweight exercise devices will be needed.\n\nBut problems keeping fit aside, just what does spaceflight do to the human body?\n\nMuscles and bones\n\nWithout the constant tug of gravity on our limbs, muscle and bone mass quickly begins to diminish in space. The most affected are those muscles that help to maintain our posture in our back, neck, calves and quadriceps – in microgravity they no longer have to work nearly as hard and begin to atrophy. After just two weeks muscle mass can fall by as much as 20% and on longer missions of three-to-six months it can fall by 30%.\n\nNasa/Getty Images The journey back to Earth from the ISS can be pretty rough, despite boosters and parachutes slowing the descent (Credit: Nasa/Getty Images)\n\nTo combat this, astronauts undertake 2.5 hours a day of exercise and intense training while in orbit on the ISS. This includes a series of squats, deadlifts, rows and bench presses using a resistive exercise device installed in the ISS's \"gym\", alongside regular bouts tethered to a treadmill and on an exercise bike. They also take diet supplements to help keep their bones as healthy as possible.\n\nA recent study, however, highlighted that even this exercise regime was not enough to prevent losses in muscle function and size. It recommended testing whether higher loads in resistance exercises and high intensity interval training might help to counteract this muscle loss.\n\nThe lack of gravity pulling down on their bodies can also mean that astronauts find they grow a little taller during their stay on the ISS as their spines elongate slightly. This can lead to issues such as back pain while in space and slipped disks once back on Earth. During a briefing onboard the ISS ahead of his return to Earth, Rubio himself said his spine was growing and said it might help him to avoid a common neck injury that astronauts can suffer when their spacecraft hit the ground if they try to crane out of their seats to see what is happening.\n\n\"I think my spine has extended just enough that I'm kind of wedged into my seat liner, so I shouldn't move much at all,\" he said.\n\nWeight loss\n\nAlthough weight means very little while in orbit – the microgravity environment means anything not tethered down can float around the ISS habitat freely, including human bodies – maintaining a healthy weight is a challenge while in orbit. Although Nasa tries to ensure its astronauts have a diverse range of nutritious foods, including most recently a few salad leaves grown on board the space station, it can still affect an astronaut's body. Scott Kelly, a Nasa astronaut who took part in the most extensive study of the effects of long-term spaceflight after staying onboard the ISS for 340 days while his twin brother stayed back on Earth, lost 7% of his body mass while in orbit.\n\nResearchers examining Scott Kelly after his trip to the ISS found that the bacteria and fungi living in his gut had altered profoundly compared to before he flew into space\n\nEyesight\n\nExposure to galactic cosmic rays and energetic solar particles can also lead to other eye problems. The Earth's atmosphere helps to protect us from these but once in orbit on the ISS, this protection disappears. While spacecraft can carry shielding to help keep out excess radiation, astronauts onboard the ISS have reported seeing flashes of light in their eyes as cosmic rays and solar particles hit their retina and optical nerves.\n\nNeural shuffling\n\nAfter his long stay on the ISS, however, Kelly's cognitive performance was found to have changed little and had remained relatively the same as his brother's on the ground. However, researchers did notice that the speed and accuracy of Kelly's cognitive performance did decrease for around six months after he landed, possibly as his brain readjusted to the Earth's gravity and his very different lifestyle back home.\n\nA study on a Russian cosmonaut who spent 169 days on the ISS in 2014 also revealed some changes to the brain itself seem to occur while in orbit. It found there were changes in the levels of neural connectivity in parts of the brain relating to motor function – in other words, movement – and also in the vestibular cortex, which plays an important role in orientation, balance and perception of our own motion. This is perhaps unsurprising given the peculiar nature of weightlessness while in space; astronauts often have to learn how to move efficiently without gravity to anchor them to anything and adjust to a world where there is no up or down.\n\nNasa/Getty Images Scott Kelly's 340 day trip to the ISS allowed researchers to study how space affected him compared to his twin brother back on Earth (Credit: Nasa/Getty Images)\n\nA more recent study has raised concerns about other changes in brain structure that can occur during long-term space missions. Cavities in the brain known as the right lateral and third ventricles (responsible for storing cerebrospinal fluid, providing nutrients to the brain and disposing of waste) can swell and take up to three years to shrink back to normal size.\n\nFriendly bacteria\n\nIt is apparent from research in recent years that a significant key to good health is the make up and diversity of the microorgansims that live in and on our bodies. This microbiota can influence how we digest food, affect the levels of inflammation in our bodies and even alter the way our brains work.\n\nSkin\n\nAlthough there have now been five Nasa astronauts who have spent more than 300 days in orbit, we have Kelly to thank again for insights into how his skin fared while in orbit. His skin was found to have heightened sensitivity and a rash for around six days after he returned from the space station. Researchers speculated that a lack of skin stimulation during the mission may have contributed to his skin complaint.\n\nNasa The microgravity environment of the ISS can have significant affects on the human body that will be a challenge as humans explore farther into the Solar System (Credit: Nasa)\n\nGenes\n\nOne of the most significant findings from Kelly's prolonged journey into space were the effects it had on his DNA. At the end of each strand of DNA are structures known as telomeres, which are thought to help protect our genes from damage. As we age, these get shorter, but research on Kelly and other astronauts has revealed that space travel seems to alter the length of these telomeres.\n\n\"Most striking, however, was the finding of significantly longer telomeres during spaceflight,\" says Susan Bailey, a professor of environmental and radiological health at Colorado State University who was part of the team studying Kelly and his brother. She has done separate studies with another 10 unrelated astronauts who have taken part in shorter missions of around six months. \"Also unexpected was that telomere length shortened rapidly on return to Earth for all crewmembers. Of particular relevance to long-term health and ageing trajectories, astronauts in general had many more short telomeres after spaceflight than they did before.\"\n\nExactly why this happens is still being unravelled, she says. \"We have some clues, but additional long-duration crewmembers – like Rubio, who spent one year in space – will be critical to really characterising and understanding this response and its potential health outcomes.\"\n\nOne possible cause could be exposure to the complex mix of radiation while in space. Astronauts who experience long-term exposure while in orbit show signs of DNA damage, she says.\n\nNasa Astronauts can spend up to 2.5 hours a day working out on the ISS in an effort to maintain their muscle mass and bone density (Credit: Nasa)\n\nThere were also some changes in gene expression – the mechanism that reads the DNA to produce proteins in cells – seen in Kelly that may have been related to his journey into space. Some of these related to the body's response to DNA damage, bone formation and the immune system's response to stress. Most of these changes, however, had returned to normal within six months of his return to Earth.\n\nIn June 2024, a new study highlighted some potential differences between the way the immune systems of male and female astronauts respond to spaceflight. Using gene expression data from samples obtained from the crew of the SpaceX Inspiration 4 mission, who spent just under three days in orbit in the autumn of 2021, it identified changes in 18 proteins related to the immune system, ageing and muscle growth.\n\nComparing their gene activity to those of 64 other astronauts on previous missions, the study found in the expression of three proteins that play a role in inflammation compared to before the flight. The men tended to be more sensitive to spaceflight, with more disruption to their gene activity and they took longer to return to a normal state after returning to Earth.\n\nIn particular, the researchers found the gene activity of two proteins known as interleukin-6, which helps to control levels of inflammation in the body, and interleukin-8, which is produced to gulde immune cells to sites of infection, were more affected in the men compared to the women. Another protein, called firbrinogen, which is involved in blood clotting, was also affected more in male astronauts.\n\nBut the researchers say they still need to unravel why women appear to be less sensitive to these particular effects of spaceflight, but it could be related to their response to stress.\n\nYou can hear Nasa astronaut Peggy Whitson describe how her own time in space has changed her body in the video below. With an accumulated 675 days in space, she has spent more time in orbit than any other American, although the world record is currently held by Russian cosmonaut Oleg Kononenko, who has clocked up 878 days in space.\n\nWATCH: Peggy Whitson describe how space changed her body\n\nImmune system\n\nKelly received a series of vaccines before, during and after his trip into space and his immune system was found to react normally. But Bailey's research has found that astronauts do suffer some decreases in white blood cell counts that fall in line with the doses of radiation they receive while in orbit.\n\nThere are still many questions to be answered, however, about what impact space travel can have on a bipedal, big-brained species that evolved to live on Earth. As researchers pour over Rubio's medical tests, blood samples and scans following his 371 days in space, they will doubtless be hoping they will learn more.\n\n--",

        "content": "Edward II: Did a gay love affair spark a 14th-Century royal crisis?\n\n27 February 2025 Share Save Nick Levine Share Save\n\nAlamy\n\nA new revival of Christopher Marlowe's pioneering play about the 14th-Century King of England puts the spotlight back on his relationship with his male \"favourite\" Piers Gaveston.\n\nThis week, at its base in Stratford-upon Avon, the world-famous Royal Shakespeare Company (RSC) is opening a new production of Christopher Marlowe's Edward II. Though this influential 16th-Century play about a beleaguered queer monarch is more than 430 years old, it still feels stingingly relevant. Marlowe depicted a king whose authority and ability to rule is fatally undermined by his relationship with another man. Modern-day UK monarchs hold only ceremonial power, but overt queerness in the British royal family remains vanishingly rare. Lord Ivar Mountbatten, a second cousin of King Charles III who is currently competing on US reality show The Traitors, is widely described as \"the first openly gay royal\".\n\nMarlowe's play dramatises the struggles of Edward II, a real-life King of England who reigned from 1307 to 1327. A year after Edward II succeeded his father, Edward I, he married the King of France's daughter, Isabella, in an effort to strengthen Anglo-French relations. Queen Isabella bore Edward II four children, and became a formidable figure in her own right – she is sometimes called \"the she-wolf of France\". But Marlowe's play really hinges on the king's controversial relationship with his male \"favourite\", Piers Gaveston, and how this sparked a constitutional crisis that he never recovered from.\n\nAlamy A 19th-Century painting by Marcus Stone of Edward II and Gaveston, showing them getting closer while courtiers look on (Credit: Alamy)\n\nThe playwright never says outright that the two men are lovers, but the queer subtext is hardly subtle. In one scene, after he is reunited with his favourite, Edward beseeches him to \"kiss not my hand [but] embrace me, Gaveston, as I do thee\". In another, Isabella bemoans the fact \"the king regards me not, but [instead] dotes upon the love of Gaveston\". Only a wilfully obtuse reader of Marlowe's text could miss the insinuation that these two men are more than just friends.\n\nWas Edward II gay?\n\nEver since it was written, Marlowe's play has helped to cement the real-life Edward's debatable but not entirely misleading reputation as a \"gay king\". To put it simply, we can never know for certain whether Edward II had a romantic and/or sexual relationship with any of his male favourites. But when it was first performed in 1592, it paved the way for the monarch's queerness to be openly discussed by historians. \"The earliest text we have accusing Edward of some kind of sexual transgression was written around the time Gaveston was murdered [in 1312],\" historian Kit Heyam, author of The Reputation of Edward II, 1305-1697, tells the BBC. \"It says that at the beginning of Edward's reign, there was 'much lechery habitually practised'.\"\n\nI think in purely physical terms, we could probably call him more bisexual than gay. But emotionally, it strikes me that he probably was gay – Kathryn Warner\n\nIn the parlance of the time, \"lechery\" was used to describe any kind of \"sinful\" sexual behaviour, according to the mores of the Catholic Church, which held religious authority in England at the time. \"The text seems to be suggesting that this behaviour will stop now that Gaveston's dead, but it stops short of saying that the sexual transgression was actually between Gaveston and the king,\" Heyam says. In the centuries after Edward II's death, it became less risky for writers to insinuate that Edward II may have been sexually transgressive, but the invention of the printing press in the 15th Century cranked up the innuendo. \"Writers would sensationalise their texts to make them more commercially appealing, so they started saying that Edward II was definitely sexually transgressive, and it was definitely the fault of his male favourites,\" Heyam says. \"But Marlowe was the first person to join the dots, and say that Edward II was actually sleeping with them.\"\n\nThe actor and RSC co-artistic director Daniel Evans, who portrays Edward II in the new production, believes that Marlowe's play still feels \"radical\" in 2025. His interest in reviving it was piqued by director Daniel Raggett, who posed a \"provocative\", hypothetical question that underlines the piece's enduring relevance: \"What would happen if our current king, Charles III, suddenly said: 'I know I've been married for a while, but I actually want someone called Colin by my side, not Camilla?'\" It might not cause a civil war, as Edward's relationship with Gaveston begets in Marlowe's play, but Evans questions just how accepting today's \"supposedly liberal and permissive society\" would be. \"Deep-rooted homophobia still exists, and the whole notion of the British Royal Family, of lineage and heirs, is very dependent on a heteronormative family structure,\" he notes.\n\nHelen Murray The new RSC production of Edward II stars its co-artistic director Daniel Evans (pictured right), who believes the play is still radical (Credit: Helen Murray)\n\nEvans and Raggett were also intrigued by the play's late-20th-Century renaissance, which is inextricably linked with the burgeoning LGBTQ+ rights movement. Dr Will Tosh, head of research at Shakespeare's Globe, and author of Straight Acting: The Many Queer Lives of William Shakespeare, says that Marlowe's play \"doesn't have a hugely long performance history\" outside of the era in which it was written. He notes that in the 18th and 19th centuries, it essentially went \"into cold storage\" because the idea of a male monarch having a male lover would have been anathema to conservative Georgian and Victorian audiences. The play's subsequent revival in the second half of the 20th Century coincides with a \"more curious and less judgmental attitude to queer intimacy\", Tosh says.\n\nBoundary-breaking productions\n\nIn 1969, two years after male homosexuality was decriminalised in England and Wales, but 11 years before the same advance was made in Scotland, Ian McKellen portrayed Edward II in a Prospect Theatre Company production that toured the UK. Gaveston was played by James Laurenson, a New Zealand actor who died last year, and their on-stage kiss caused some controversy when the production arrived in Edinburgh. \"The late councillor John Kidd took offence to this show of male affection, particularly as it took place on a stage erected within the assembly hall of the Church of Scotland,\" McKellen recalls on his website. Though a couple of local policemen were sent to watch the production, McKellen notes that they found \"no problem\" with its contents and this brief fuss \"guaranteed full houses for the run.\"\n\nWhen this production was broadcast on the BBC a year later, it made history by including the first same-sex kiss ever shown on British television. In a 2017 interview, McKellen said that the Prospect production also had a profound impact on \"many, many Americans\" who watched it on US network PBS. \"They saw for the first time in their lives two men kissing and couldn't believe it, but took comfort from it,\" he said.\n\nAlamy Ian McKellen and James Laurenson's same-sex kiss on stage in a 1960s production of the play, which was later televised on the BBC, was a landmark moment (Credit: Alamy)\n\nThe play's place in the queer canon was further cemented by a 1991 film adaptation directed by artist and gay rights activist Derek Jarman. Featuring a deliberately anachronistic mix of modern and medieval props, costumes and backdrops, Jarman's film dials up Marlowe's homoeroticism, and reframes the story within the context of the contemporary LGBTQ+ rights movement. As Gaveston (played by Andrew Tiernan) is tortured for his transgressions, Jarman shows police clashing with protesters from gay-rights group OutRage!.\n\nA year before Jarman's film, Marlowe's play was staged by the RSC with Simon Russell Beale in the title role. Angela K Ahlgren argues in her 2011 essay Performing Queer Edward II in the 1990s that Jarman's film and this RSC revival of the play \"reflect notions of queerness circulating in the 1990s because they stage violence, same-sex desire, and references to contemporary gay political issues\". At the time, the HIV/AIDS epidemic was devastating the gay male population globally, and queer activists in the UK were protesting against Section 28, a piece of legislation that prohibited the supposed \"promotion of homosexuality\" by schools and local councils. It had been enacted by Margaret Thatcher's Conservative Government in 1988, following a rising tide of anti-gay sentiment in the media.\n\nFact v fiction\n\nStill, Marlowe's play should never be regarded as a work of historical gospel. Tosh says the playwright's \"major dramatic innovation\" is to make the king's relationship with Gaveston the \"central drama\" of his life by \"compressing the timeline\". In reality, Edward II cultivated relationships with other highly influential male favourites after Gaveston was murdered in 1312, just five years into his 19-year-reign. But Marlowe depicts his bond with Gaveston as by far the most emotionally significant. \"After Gaveston's death in the play, Edward invokes his memory to justify whatever he's doing. And later, when Edward is imprisoned and mistreated, he invokes Gaveston's name again as a plea for salvation,\" Tosh says.\n\nJoe Cocks Studio Collection/ Shakespeare Birthplace Trust Simon Russell Beale portrayed Edward II in the RSC's 1990 production, which reflected the era's gay politics (Credit: Joe Cocks Studio Collection/ Shakespeare Birthplace Trust)\n\nOf course, Marlowe's play also invites us to make serious presumptions about the nature of the two men's relationship. Historian Kathryn Warner, author of Edward II: The Unconventional King, says we can never know for certain how Edward II felt about Gaveston and his other male favourites because the king didn't keep a diary or write personal letters. \"All we have is the word of outsiders, which is obviously open to interpretation,\" she says. But in all likelihood, given that he fathered an illegitimate child with an unknown woman, Edward II's sexuality was probably more complicated than his reputation as a \"gay king\" might suggest. \"I think in purely physical terms, we could probably call him more bisexual than gay,\" Warner says. \"But emotionally, it strikes me that he probably was gay, because he was very, very close to his male favourites.\"\n\nI hope audiences who see this play think deeply about what happens when you try to ban love and sublimate someone's natural way of being – Daniel Evans\n\nThis closeness almost certainly caused his downfall. According to Heyam, Edward's fundamental error throughout his reign was to grant his favourites too much power. \"He failed to realise that being king of England in the 14th Century is very much a manager's job,\" they say. \"Edward needed to keep a number of powerful nobles happy, but when he gave Gaveston power over them, he made them very angry.\" After Gaveston was murdered by a group of rival barons in 1312, Edward II made the same mistake again with Hugh Despenser the Younger, whom Warner describes as \"the last and most powerful\" of his male favourites.\n\nIt's worth noting that Despenser does appear in Marlowe's play, but only as a relatively minor character called Spencer who is essentially a stand-in for Gaveston following his death. The real-life Despenser had much more agency. In 1324, amid growing tensions with France, he began to wield his influence against Queen Isabella because of her French heritage. Isabella fought back with support from her own favourite, Richard Mortimer, which ultimately led to Despenser's execution in 1325, and Edward II's forced abdication the following year. \"If he had just kept his public and private lives separate, he would probably have been fine,\" Heyam says.\n\nAlamy Celebrated gay British filmmaker Derek Jarman made a film of Edward II, that mixed medieval and modern settings (Credit: Alamy)\n\nIn Marlowe's play, the fallen monarch is killed at Mortimer's behest by a red hot poker through his anus. Warner says the idea that Edward II was murdered in this way is \"almost certainly a myth\" – one Marlowe didn't invent, but definitely helped to \"popularise\". Over 430 years later, it remains a shocking image with crassly homophobic overtones. But even if Marlowe's poker scene is apocryphal, the play still has a lot to say about the consequences of intolerance. When Edward complains about being forced to \"leave my Gaveston\", the disapproving Earl of Lancaster replies derisively: \"Diablo, what passions call you these?\" His use of the Spanish word for \"devil\" is surely no accident. \"I hope audiences who see this play think deeply about what happens when you try to ban love and sublimate someone's natural way of being,\" Evans says. \"The endless cycle of violence that this can create is something we can all learn from today.\"\n\nEdward II is at the Swan Theatre, Stratford-upon-Avon until April 5, rsc.org.uk\n\n--\n\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news delivered to your inbox every Friday.",

        "content": "Spinning through space: The astronomers watching the skies for asteroids\n\n2 days ago Share Save Sue Nelson Share Save\n\nGetty Images\n\nSue Nelson explores how asteroids can inform our understanding of the Earth's past – or threaten our future.\n\nEach year, according to Nasa, a chunk of rock the size of a car hurtles through space on a collision course with our planet. Fortunately, thanks to the Earth's atmosphere acting as a natural shield, instead of crash landing on the ground, the asteroid burns up and produces an impressive light show, streaking across the sky as a meteor or fireball.\n\nUnfortunately, other, much larger asteroids have the potential to be far more threatening than entertaining. \"Asteroids come in all sizes,\" says Michael Küppers, a planetary scientist for the European Space Agency (ESA). \"The really big ones, like the 10km (6.21 mile) [wide] or so asteroid that we think led to the extinction of the dinosaurs, happen maybe once every 100 million years.\"\n\nThe asteroid 2024 YR4, which was discovered in December 2024, has been making headlines around the world recently. At around 40-90m (131-295ft) wide, it is larger than a 12-storey building. In January this year, the ESA calculated the rock's trajectory and initially predicted that there was a 1.2% chance of impact with Earth on 22 December 2032.\n\nAny asteroid we detect is generally a fragment of a much larger body that was formed at the birth of our Solar System – Alan Fitzsimmons\n\nThis officially crossed the comfortable threshold of risk for a near-Earth object – 1% – and triggered the need for investigation by several planetary defence organisations, as well as the US President and US Congress.\n\nLuckily YR4 is not large enough to be capable of making our species extinct but it could still be a \"city killer\", according to some experts, if it is at the upper end of the estimated size range and landed in a heavily populated area.\n\nIn February 2025, the risk of the asteroid hitting the Earth briefly climbed to 3.1% or one in 32. Luckily, humanity managed to avoid mass panic and the risk has since reduced to a more reassuring 0.001%. But where did this asteroid come from in the first place? And how concerned should we be about a similar scenario emerging in the future?\n\nNASA/ Johns Hopkins APL After analysing data from Nasa’s Dart mission, scientists concluded that it had successfully altered the asteroid’s orbit (Credit: NASA/ Johns Hopkins APL)\n\nA distant belt\n\nWhen it comes to understanding asteroids, astronomers and scientists are still being dealt the cards in order to understand the rules of this potentially risky celestial game.\n\n\"Scientifically there's a huge amount we can learn from asteroids,\" says Alan Fitzsimmons, an astronomer at Queens University Belfast and a member of one of Nasa's sky surveys that searches and tracks Near Earth Objects (NEOs). These are asteroids whose orbit brings them within 195 million km (121 million miles) of the Sun.\n\n\"Any asteroid we detect is generally a fragment of a much larger body that was formed at the birth of our Solar System\" says Fitzsimmons. \"So by studying their chemical make-up we get some idea of the conditions in the initial Solar System as since then, over 4.6 billion years, it has evolved dynamically.\"\n\nThese ancient rocky remnants are sometimes referred to as minor planets. Often irregular and cratered, they can also be spherical. They can spin slow, fast or tumble. Usually solitary, they can sometimes be found in pairs (binary or double asteroids) and some even have their own moon. Nasa's Jet Propulsion Laboratory's website keeps tabs on their numbers and at the last count there are over 1.4 million in our Solar System. The majority are located within the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter but millions more are too small to be detected.\n\nMost of the time these asteroids remain restrained within that interplanetary belt by Jupiter's gravitational field, unable to coalesce into a larger body. But occasionally another asteroid or the influence of Jupiter's gravity can nudge some into another orbit around the Sun, towards the inner Solar System.\n\nCelestial clues\n\nOnce an asteroid has been ejected from its usual path and is potentially heading our way, the first challenge is to detect it.\n\n\"All an asteroid looks like in a telescope is a point of light against other points of lights that are stars, except it's moving,\" says Kelly Fast, Nasa's acting planetary defence officer, \"and it's reflecting sunlight.\"\n\nThe brighter the asteroid, the bigger it will be. But its colour also affects the brightness as a small white asteroid might reflect more light than a much larger dark one. It's not an exact science, which is why YR4's size is estimated at 40-90m (131-295ft) wide. The more information we have, however, the more precise that number will become.\n\nAlamy The Chelyabinsk meteor was just 20m (66ft) in diameter (Credit: Alamy)\n\n\"A team at Nasa and an ESA team will be using the James Webb Space Telescope to take infrared observations of YR4,\" says Fast. These measurements of an asteroid's thermal emissions \"may be helpful for constraining that size range\", she adds.\n\nYR4, in common with most asteroids, is from the asteroid belt. \"Which part of the belt is hard to tell,\" says Fitzsimmons. \"One clue that we have is a spectrum of its surface.\" By examining the intensity of light emitted over a range of wavelengths, specific materials on the surface of the asteroid can be identified. \"YR4 is a rocky asteroid that's deficient in lighter elements such as carbon, which tells us that it probably came from the inner asteroid belt,\" says Fitzsimmons. \"But exactly where we don't know – and we may never know.\"\n\nAsteroids are not all the same either. \"There are different populations,\" says Fast. \"Some are stony, some are carbonaceous and some have metallic content depending on the parent bodies they came from.\"\n\nWhile there are rare types of asteroids, more than three out of four are carbonaceous, or C-type, and contain carbon, appearing black as coal. The rest are mostly S-type or silicaceous – a mix of metal and silicate crystals – or metallic or M-type asteroids, which contain predominantly iron and nickel.\n\nOne asteroid scientists are particularly interested in is – a large, metal-rich rock the shape of a potato, which inhabits the Solar System's main asteroid belt. It's thought this asteroid could be up to 95% nickel and iron, which is similar to the Earth's core. Studying it will therefore increase our understanding of how our own planet formed. Nasa's Psyche mission is currently on its way there and is due to arrive in August 2029.\n\nIn terms of metal content, asteroids like Psyche 16 are also potentially extremely valuable – it's thought to contain resources worth approximately US$10 quadrillion (£7.8 quadrillion). In the future, if asteroid mining ever became necessary as well as economically and technically feasible, it's thought they could provide an abundance of resources.\n\nKnowing an asteroid's composition is key for defence reasons too. An iron-rich asteroid, for example would do more damage on impact than carbonaceous ones as it is more dense, has more mass and would have more energy if it smashed into a moon or planet. The Earth's Moon, as can be seen, is littered by asteroid impact craters since it only has a thin atmosphere, or exosphere, which cannot protective it. Although the Earth is unlikely to receive an impact by YR4, there remains a 1.7% chance it could hit our Moon.\n\nThe level of damage also depends on the asteroid's structure. \"If you know more about the structure of these objects,\" says Fitzsimmons, \"then you can calculate more accurately what happens when it hits the Earth's atmosphere.Most asteroids below 10km [6.2 miles] across are almost all either heavily fractured solid objects or rock piles – smaller fragments of asteroids grouped together mostly by gravity.\"\n\nGetty Images Eros became the first near-Earth asteroid to be discovered when a German astronomer spotted it in 1898 (Credit: Getty Images)\n\nDoes this mean a rubble pile asteroid would be more likely to burn up in the atmosphere and therefore be less dangerous? \"Unfortunately not,\" says Fitzsimmons. \"If an asteroid is hitting the Earth at 17km per second (over 38,000 mph), it's in the atmosphere for less than 10 seconds before it reaches impact.\"\n\nWhile the Earth's atmosphere acts as a protective barrier, that still doesn't prevent all damage. \"Something the size of YR4 would probably only make it to a few kilometres above the Earth's surface. It will lose its energy and explode at altitude. Although we wouldn't get a crater, we would have an air blast and that could be just as devastating as if it hit the ground,\" says Fitzsimmons.\n\nAt the moment we don't know if YR4 is one solid object or whether it's a rock pile, but an air blast could have been significant considering what happened in 2013. A fireball – which is what an asteroid is called once it enters Earth's atmosphere – exploded about 14 miles (22.5km) above the city of Chelyabinsk in Russia. Eyewitnesses described the light as brighter than the Sun, and the blast's shockwave damaged over 4,000 buildings and injured 1,200 people.\n\n\"The asteroid was around 20m (66ft) in size,\" says Küppers. \"This is maybe about the limit size where you would start worrying if it hits populated areas.\"\n\nCoincidentally, on the day of the Chelyabinsk event, a United Nations committee was underway in Vienna about defending Earth from future asteroid impacts. The meeting resulted in the International Asteroid Warning Network, chaired by Nasa, and a Space Missions Planning Advisory Group for space agencies around the world to collaborate.\n\nFortunately, there have already been a number of missions which have studied asteroids, starting with Galileo when it flew past two asteroids in the early 1990s. In 2000, Nasa's Near Shoemaker became the first spacecraft to orbit an asteroid, Eros, and – a year later – to land on one too. The Japanese Huyabusa 2 mission visited the C-type asteroid 162173 Ryugu in 2018 and 2019 and even sent back a sample to Earth in a hermetically sealed container in 2005.\n\nThe US OSIRIS-REx mission (Origins, Spectral Interpretation, Resource Identification and Security–Regolith Explorer) collected dust and rocks from asteroid Bennu and returned them to Earth in 2023. Earlier this year, the first in-depth analysis of the samples' minerals and molecules were published. It included finding 14 of the 20 amino acids used by life to make proteins on Earth. The spacecraft, renamed OSIRIS-APEX, is now on its way to explore asteroid Apophis.\n\nAll these missions, and more, have allowed scientists to study the composition and particle size of several asteroids, as well as the magnetic properties of samples to inform our understanding of the Solar System's early magnetic field. But there is another reason for studying asteroids, brought home by the concerns over YR4: to protect our planet.\n\nNasa When the OSIRIS-REx spacecraft return capsule was finally opened and its contents analysed, scientists discovered the ingredients for life (Credit: Nasa)\n\nIn 2022, Nasa's Dart (Double Asteroid Redirection Test) mission deliberately aimed itself at a harmless – from the Earth's point of view – binary asteroid system consisting of asteroid Didymos (780m, or 2,559 ft) and its smaller orbiting asteroid or moonlet, Dimorphos (160m, or 525ft). The spacecraft used itself as a kinetic impactor, targeting Dimorphos at around 22,530km (14,000 miles) per hour. This was Nasa's first test to see if it could deflect an asteroid's path and it was a success. After impact, Dimorphos' orbit was altered. Does this mean, in future, that Nasa asteroid missions will focus on planetary defence rather than understanding more about the science?\n\n\"We're very much interested in both,\" says Fast, \"and it's a really good partnership. The planetary defence coordination office at Nasa sits inside of the planetary science division because there is so much asteroid science involved in it. We want to protect the planet but we also want to study these amazing leftovers from the formation of the Solar System, both to understand the history of the Solar System and to see what the effects might be should they impact, or should we need to deflect one in space.\"\n\n--\n\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.",

        "content": "Will Snow White be a 'victim of its moment'? How the Disney remake became 2025's most divisive film\n\n11 hours ago Share Save Caryn James Share Save\n\nDisney\n\nThe live-action version of the classic fairy-tale animation sounded like a surefire hit. But even before it's reached cinemas, the response to it has been loud and often hostile.\n\nYou wouldn't think that the war in Gaza would have much impact on a Disney remake. But the live-action Snow White, a revamped version of the 1937 animated classic Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, has become a flashpoint for social and political divisions, even before its global release next week.\n\nThere was some backlash to the casting of Rachel Zegler, of Colombian descent, as the heroine. More recently, there has been blowback both about Zegler's pro-Palestinian comments and about pro-Israel comments by Israeli actress Gal Gadot, who plays Snow White's stepmother, the Evil Queen. And there is an ongoing debate about whether there should have been dwarfs at all, live or CGI. The film's director, Marc Webb, said in Disney's official production notes, \"I think all good stories evolve over time. They become reflections of the world that we live in\". He has likely got more than he bargained for, as reactions to Snow White inadvertently reflect the most polarised aspects of the world today. Like political rhetoric in countries around the world, responses to the film's production have been loud, irate and sometimes ugly.\n\nDisney Gal Gadot and Rachel Zegler in a scene from Snow White – both stars have faced a backlash for their political views (Credit: Disney)\n\nSnow White has been in the works since 2019, and began in earnest with Zegler's casting in 2021. Since then attacks on its so-called \"wokeness\" have proliferated, making the film a lightning rod for opinions that have little to do with the fairy tale it is based on. A recent Hollywood Reporter article asked, \"Have some PR missteps combined with anti-woke outrage turned marketing the film into a poisoned apple?\" And alongside such measured reporting there have been heated responses in the media. The editorial board of the New York Post – owned by Rupert Murdoch, the conservative mogul whose company also owns Fox News – weighed in this week, declaring the film a financial disaster before it has opened, writing: \"Disney 'Snow White' controversy proves it again: Go woke, go broke!\"\n\nThe debate over updating\n\nThe original film needed an update if it was going to be remade at all. In its day it set a high bar for Disney's future animated films, but it also introduced the song Someday My Prince Will Come, blighting the expectations of generations of girls by setting them up to wait for a Prince Charming to make their lives complete. Meanwhile, Snow White happily sweeps the floor for the dwarfs until he shows up to rescue her with a kiss after she bites the Queen's poisoned apple. Soon after her casting announcement, Zegler told the television show Extra that in the old Snow White \"there was a big focus on her love story with a guy who literally stalks her\". In fact, the original film states that he \"searched far and wide\" to find her after falling in love at first sight, and he disappears for most of the film, so no need to take that comment too seriously. Zegler was excited and laughing when she said it. But in an early sign of the blinkered reactions to come, social media posts complained that she was anti-love.\n\nTrying to avoid more political and social discord isn't Disney's only Snow White problem – there is much online speculation that the film might just be bad\n\nSome people also rejected the idea that a Latina actress could play a character called Snow White; alongside criticisms of such non-traditional casting, she was subject to racist trolling. This was a similar reaction to that experienced by the black actress Halle Bailey when she was cast as Ariel in 2023's The Little Mermaid.\n\nThe film stumbled into more trouble simply because its lead actresses expressed political opinions. On X in August 2024, Zegler thanked fans for the response to the Snow White trailer, adding, \"and always remember, free Palestine\".\n\nGadot has posted her support for Israel on social media, and especially since the 7 October attacks by Hamas has been outspoken in defence of her country and against anti-semitism. That led to some short-lived calls by pro-Palestinian social media users to boycott the film simply because she is in it.\n\nGetty Images The non-traditional Snow White European premiere took place in Spain and featured Zegler singing in front of the castle which inspired the 1937 film (Credit: Getty Images)\n\nThe fallout on the film intensified after the 2024 US presidential election. Zegler posted on Instagram that she was \"heartbroken\" and fearful, and that she hoped \"Trump voters and Trump himself never know peace\". In response Megyn Kelly, the former Fox news personality, attacked Zegler, saying on her radio show, \"This woman is a pig,\" and that Disney was going to have to recast the role. Zegler apologised to Trump voters, saying \"I let my emotions get the best of me\".\n\nThe issue of the dwarfs\n\nEven when people reacting to the film have agreed on a basic principle, like more opportunities for actors who have dwarfism, they have disagreed on how to get there. Peter Dinklage, perhaps the world's most well-known actor with dwarfism, questioned the entire project before many details were known, calling the 1937 film \"a backwards story of seven dwarfs living in a cave together\". Disney announced the next day, \"To avoid reinforcing stereotypes from the original animated film, we are taking a different approach with these seven characters.\"\n\nAs it turned out, the seven characters are CGI, and Disney has reclassifed them as \"magical creatures\", not dwarfs. What do they look like? Even a glimpse at the trailer reveals that they look exactly like CGI dwarfs. They are still named Happy, Grumpy, Sleepy, Sneezy, Doc, Bashful and Dopey. The changes have caused a backlash from some people with dwarfism, who have rebutted Dinklage and accused Disney of depriving them of acting roles. As recently as this week, one told the Daily Mail, \"I think Disney is trying too hard to be politically correct, but in doing so it's damaging our careers and opportunities.\"\n\nAmidst this swirl of controversies, Disney altered the traditional red-carpet treatment it would usually give such a major film. The premiere took place in Spain on 12 March, and the Los Angeles premiere is due to take place today at an unusual, afternoon hour. The regular red-carpet journalists have not been invited, even though as a group they are not known to ask hard-hitting questions.\n\nAlamy Peter Dinklage was an early critic of the remake, questioning the decision to tell a \"backwards story of seven dwarfs living in a cave together” (Credit: Alamy)\n\nTrying to avoid more political and social discord isn't Disney's only Snow White problem, though. There is much online speculation that the film might just be bad. The first full trailer was greeted with a rush of complaints about the underwhelming CGI, with The Guardian calling the trailer \"the ugliest thing ever committed to screen\". The film has new songs by Benj Pasek and Justin Paul, the team behind La La Land, but the one released as a video, Waiting On a Wish, has a bland, generic Disney style. Box-office tracking predicts an opening weekend of around $50m (£39m), solid but at the low end for a would-be blockbuster that reportedly cost over $200m (£155m) to make.\n\nOf course, given the Disney juggernaut – the recent Moana 2 has made more than $1bn (£773m) and Mufasa: The Lion King, which had a slow start, more than $712m (£550m) – the debacle leading up to Snow White's opening may not hurt it at the box office at all. Or the film may become the victim of its moment, a fairy-tale princess covered in mud.\n\nSnow White is released internationally on March 21\n\n--\n\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.",

Here are his favourite spots to unearth Rome's millennia of secrets, from the Vatican Museums to Ostia Antica.\n\nFrom the 1st-Century BCE ruins of the Imperial Forum to the Trevi Fountain’s Baroque splendour, Rome packs such an overwhelming myriad of postcard-worthy landmarks that digging through its historical layers can make any visitor feel like they've turned into an archaeologist.\n\nAlberto Angela, a TV presenter, global ambassador for Italian heritage, art, history and culture, and a familiar face in Italian living rooms for nearly four decades knows a thing or two about his hometown's 2,000 years of history – and he's ready to help visitors discover it, especially as this year's Jubilee newly puts it into the limelight.\n\nThe SpeciaList Alberto Angela is an Italian palaeontologist and TV presenter raised and based in Rome. A well-recognised public scholar, he has published books and conducted documentaries for Italian state broadcaster RAI on science, history and archaeology-related topics for the past 36 years.\n\n\"Rome has two faces,\" says Angela. \"The Papal – that of the rich – and its working-class soul, the one that is closest to us… the most interesting,\" he says.\n\nIn a city where grand basilicas lie next to shady alleyways, Angela recommends exploring without cramming in too many sights – so that one can \"immerse oneself in the world of the ancients\".\n\nHaving followed in the footsteps of his famous father, Piero Angela – Italy's most well-known documentarist often called a \"national treasure\" – the younger Angela attributes his career and love of history to growing up in the Italian capital.\n\n\"You breathe history here,\" he says. \"Anyone who comes to Rome can see the same afterglow Caesar would have seen. You aren't in a place that doesn't exist anymore. Rome was rebuilt on top of its ancient structures.\"\n\nFor Angela, this is what makes Rome so unique. \"The city did not cancel its history, unlike many others,\" he says. \"Living here, you understand the ancients.\"\n\nEmerging from a small market settlement on the Tiber, the city of Rome was at an intersection between the Mediterranean and mainland Europe, making it a crossroads that swelled into the world’s first true metropolis. Angela believes that the city's immense global-reaching political and symbolic impact throughout history means everyone has a \"piece\" of Rome inside them – which is why it can have such a profound impact on those who visit it.\n\nHere are Angela's favourite ways to experience ancient history in modern Rome.\n\nAlamy The Palatine Hill is the mythological birthplace of Rome, and home to countless testaments to its history (Credit: Alamy)\n\n1. Best place to experience ancient Rome: The Palatine Hill\n\nMuch of central Rome's labyrinthine urban grid is a direct heir of the former imperial capital, with public spaces like the Baroque Piazza Navona or Campo de’ Fiori piazza taking their shape from a bygone stadium and theatre, respectively.\n\nTip: Trying to cram in all of Rome's main landmarks in a few days is an Olympian feat, so Angela recommends first-time visitors follow a three-day rule. \"See the major sights on the first and second days – Saint Peter's, the Pantheon, the Colosseum,\" he says. \"And then on the third day, choose yourself, to see something cool [off the beaten path]. When you get home, you'll feel you'll have seen the things everyone talks about, but you'll also have seen something you yourself like.\"\n\nBut on the Palatine Hill, the mythical birthplace of Rome, you can actually walk on the same stones where emperors Augustus and Nero once dwelled.\n\n\"It's the place where the Caesars lived and died,\" Angela says.\n\nAs the legend goes, twin brothers Romulus and Remus received an omen from the gods and decided to lay the foundations of a new city on the Palatine Hill in 753 BCE. In the subsequent centuries, the Palatine developed into an exclusive neighbourhood of patrician villas and Imperial palaces – indeed, it’s where the word “palace” takes its root.\n\nOne of the legendary seven hills of the ancient city, offering an incomparable vantage point with a 360 panorama, Palatine Hill offers what Angela describes as \"a beautiful walk\", with arguably the best views of the Colosseum – the unmistakable \"star of ancient Rome\".\n\nVisiting the Palatine is a full immersion into the life of the Roman empire, with a plethora of impressive ruins, including the mosaic floors of Augustus's palace, Domitian's hippodrome and the balcony overlooking the Circus Maximus racecourse.\n\nWebsite: https://colosseo.it/en/area/the-palatine/ Address: Parco archeologico del Colosseo, Via di S.

In honour of the 2025 Jubilee, tourists and pilgrims alike are flocking to Saint Peter's Basilica to walk through its Holy Door, opened for the occasion every quarter of a century.\n\nBut while much of the Holy See's architectural majesty is immediately apparent – from the Michelangelo- and Giacomo della Porta-designed designed dome of Saint Peter's all the way to the Sistine Chapel and Vatican Museums – some of its greatest treasures are hidden underground.\n\n\"Once in Saint Peter's, you walk on beautiful marble floorings, you look up to the Baldachin,\" says Angela, renowned for his 2015 TV miniseries Alla Scoperta dei Musei Vaticani (Discovering the Vatican Museums). \"But you can go underground. The Popes' tombs can be found underneath, but under those is the ancient Roman graveyard where Peter the Apostle himself was buried. The foundations of [the Basilica] are a graveyard.\"\n\nThe Vatican Necropolis, excavated only in the 1940s, features mausoleums belonging to citizens of many faiths, as well as a cluster of tombs called \"Field P”, suspected by some scholars to hold the burial chamber of the Church founder himself.\n\n\"It's a trip into ancient Rome that you wouldn't expect to find [there]\", Angela says. \"It makes you understand how Rome really is.\"\n\nVisitors must book visits to the Necropolis on the official website of Saint Peter’s Basilica. The dress code mandates covered shoulders and below-the-knee clothing.\n\nWebsite: https://www.basilicasanpietro.va/en/san-pietro/the-necropolis Address: Piazza San Pietro, 00120 Città del Vaticano, Vatican City Phone: +39 06 6988 5318 Instagram: @basilicasanpietro.va\n\nAlamy The Basilica of San Clemente al Laterano has witnessed nearly all of Rome's historical eras (Credit: Alamy)\n\n3. Best church for experiencing all of Rome's historical eras in one fell swoop: The Basilica of San Clemente al Laterano\n\nRome has more than 900 Catholic sites of worship built over the course of the centuries. Now and then, there's one that best encapsulates the city's multi-millennial history, like Angela's pick, the Basilica of San Clemente.\n\n\"This Basilica conceals the three souls of Rome – Baroque, medieval and ancient,\" Angela says. \"Anyone who comes across it is enchanted.\"\n\nTucked behind the Colosseum and a composite of two different churches, San Clemente – dedicated to the third pope of the same name – has been a site of worship since ancient Roman times, when it served as a temple for the Zoroastrian cult of Mithras.\n\nThe temple eventually swelled into its grand current form, featuring an intricate overlay of architectural styles – from its Renaissance courtyard and the Mannerist facade of the main Basilica, all the way to its underground, early medieval second structure, which hides ancient Roman remnants.\n\n\"The exterior is beautiful and well-maintained, from the 16th Century, with a Cosmatesque [geometric] marble flooring, and then you take the stairs and arrive at the medieval Basilica,\" says Angela. \"And you find yourself right in ancient Rome, in a Roman temple.\"\n\nWebsite: https://www.basilicasanclemente.com/eng/ Address: Piazza di S.

Best off-the-beaten-path museum: The Museo della Comunicazione Scritta dei Romani\n\nFrom 17th-Century Villa Borghese to the Capitoline, the city’s oldest art gallery, Rome has no shortage of museums displaying a vast array of artefacts – matched by equally colossal crowds of spectators.\n\nWhile Angela certainly recommends visitors enjoy the time-worn classics, he also suggests a quieter, quirkier alternative: the Museo della Comunicazione Scritta dei Romani.\n\nConveniently located a mere five-minute walk from the Termini train station, the museum is found inside the Baths of Diocletian, where the majestic 4th-Century Imperial termae have survived in remarkable condition. It is also home to a curious collection of esoteric Roman artefacts, showing how the ancients dabbled in the occult.\n\n\"It's a museum dedicated to how Romans expressed themselves,\" Angela says. \"But there's a part dedicated to magic, voodoo of sorts.\"\n\nSuperstition was the unspoken crux of ancient Roman life, but one that we often overlook. \"It's a world that often gets left behind, that of spiritual beliefs,\" he adds. \"They found the objects in a parking lot.\"\n\nAmong the objects on display is a large copper cauldron, curse tablets (defixiones), ritual tools and even Christian spells.\n\n\"For someone coming from the station, especially if it rains, it's quite an intriguing thing to visit,\" says Angela.\n\nWebsite: https://museonazionaleromano.beniculturali.it/terme-di-diocleziano/il-museo-della-comunicazione-scritta-dei-romani/ Address: Viale Enrico de Nicola 78, 00185 Phone: +39 06 684 851 Instagram: @museonazionaleromano\n\nAlamy Palazzo Doria Pamphilj is a striking example of Rome's most opulent Papal past (Credit: Alamy)\n\n5. Best for exploring Baroque Rome: Palazzo Doria Pamphilj\n\nThe 16th to 18th Centuries were a crucial time for Rome's urban development, as the city's aristocratic families – including the Farnese, Borghese, Doria and Pamphilj – vied for social dominance through commissioning lavish building projects, all designed in the Baroque style favoured by the Papal Counter-Reformation.\n\n\"I'd advise anyone coming to visit Rome to see the palaces of the powerful Roman families,\" says Angela.\n\nWhile listing a few examples – Palazzo Colonna and Palazzo Farnese among them – few rival the opulence of the Palazzo Doria Pamphilj, Rome's very own \"Versailles\", in Angela's words.\n\nThe product of an alliance of noble families, what resulted was a Baroque fantasy come to life and an impressive art collection featuring the works of many of Italy's greats, from Titian to Raphael.\n\nIts crown jewel is its Hall of Mirrors, commissioned by Gabriele Valvassori in the 1730s and featuring whimsical frescos, gilded Venetian frescos and ornate gold-plated furniture.\n\n\"I had never been prior to shooting [a TV special] and it's truly spectacular,\" he says. \"It truly surpasses anything else.\"\n\nWebsite: https://www.doriapamphilj.it/roma/ Address: Via del Corso 305, 00186 Phone: +39 06 679 7323 Instagram: @galleriadoriapamphilj\n\nAlamy Ostia Antica is Rome's very own Pompeii – minus the volcanic eruption (Credit: Alamy)\n\n6. Best historic landmark outside of the centre: Ostia Antica\n\nMany visitors coming to Rome don't know that the city has what Angela considers its very own \"Pompeii\" around 32km from the city centre: Ostia Antica.\n\nOnce Rome's sea port, potentially from as early as the 7th Century BCE, Ostia Antica developed into a bustling seaside suburb, reaching a peak of 75,000 inhabitants in the late Imperial age. While the city declined after the empire’s fall, and the coastline ended up advancing by 3.2km, much of the ancient town that once stood there has been preserved.\n\n\"You lose yourself there, you can see everything,\" Angela says. \"Bakeries, public bathrooms (latrines), homes, apartment blocks… street businesses, not too dissimilar to those of today.\"\n\nA tour of Ostia Antica can show you much of the amenities and features of ancient Roman life – from its 1st-Century BCE theatre, to its forum, public baths and necropolis.\n\nFor Angela, Ostia Antica best preserves the \"popolare\" (working-class) soul of ancient Rome – one which its newer counterpart, the beach suburb Lido di Ostia, has carried on in modern form.\n\nOstia Antica is a roughly 30-minute drive from central Rome, and can be reached in around the same time by taking the Metromare commuter rail from the Porta S Paolo station.\n\nBBC Travel's The SpeciaList is a series of guides to popular and emerging destinations around the world, as seen through the eyes of local experts and tastemakers.\n\n--\n\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.",

        "content": "The grannies who saved Albanian cuisine\n\n7 March 2025 Share Save Tristan Rutherford Share Save\n\nAlamy (Credit: Alamy)\n\nAfter being sealed off from the outside world for decades and experiencing a mass exodus, Albania is leaning into its culinary roots with the help of grandma chefs.\n\nTefta Pajenga, aged 76, is one of many pension-age TV chefs in Albania. In her nationally televised cooking show, the retired teacher instructs a younger housewife how to cook japrakë, a traditional platter of vine leaves stuffed with rice and herbs.\n\nJaprakë holds a special place in Albanian hearts. It's typically prepared by families together and then shared on Christian and Muslim feast days in this religiously diverse nation. Like so many dishes in this culinary crossroads, the recipe comes from elsewhere (the name derives from the Turkish word for \"leaf\", courtesy of Albania's more-than 500 years under Ottoman rule). Yet, the ingredients are all local: dill, peppers and mint from northern Albania.\n\nToday, Albanian grannies like Pajenga are teaching multiple generations in one of Europe's youngest-aged countries how to cook age-old dishes. That's because the Balkan nation has suffered not one, but two bouts of culinary amnesia over the past 80 years.\n\nAlamy Japrakë is a popular Albanian dish among both Christians and Muslims (Credit: Alamy)\n\nFirst, from 1946 to 1991, Albania was ruled by hardline communists who effectively sealed the small, mountainous nation off from the outside world, leading Edi Rama, the nation's current prime minister, to say it was once \"the North Korea of Europe\". During this period, cookbooks were burnt, imports were prohibited, foreign travel was banned, food was collectivised and shortages were widespread. It was a recipe for disaster.\n\nSecond, in the violent build-up and aftermath of communism's collapse in the 1990s, 710,000 citizens – 20% of the population – fled Albania from 1989 to 2001 in search of work in other countries. Over time, Pajenga said that many of these emigrants forgot their grandmothers' recipes as they adapted to new countries and cultures. Between the widespread food shortages during communism and the subsequent emigration after it, by the early 21st Century, many Albanians at home and abroad had forgotten how to prepare traditional Albanian cuisine – except for women of a certain age.\n\nIronically, Pajenga says that the Albania's transition to democracy compounded the problem. \"During communism, people had one fixed job from 07:00 until 15:00,\" she recalls. \"When democracy came, you needed more than one job to feed the family.\" Therefore, many of those who did recall how to prepare traditional Albanian dishes now no longer had the time to make them.\n\nAlamy Albania was once known as \"the North Korea of Europe\" (Credit: Alamy)\n\nSo, when Pajenga started her TV show in 2004, \"my audience was not for chefs but for housewives\" and also young people, \"who were lacking the knowledge or had forgotten how to make traditional cuisine\".\n\nAlbania's culinary culture has long reflected its status as a stepping stone between East and West. The Romans introduced grapes, olives and other modern Albanian staples when they took hold of the area in the 2nd Century BCE. Starting in the 16th Century, dishes like Arnavut ciğeri (Albanian liver) spread east from Albania across the Ottoman Empire, while sutlijaš (rice pudding) likely arrived in Albania courtesy of the Ottomans. And after World War Two, imported dishes like ajvar (a relish made from roasted red peppers, aubergine and spices) migrated south from the northern Balkans.\n\nSome indigenous foods, like mishavinë (a type of white, grainy cheese), cannot be found anywhere else. Its preparation method, in which curd is packed tightly for three months inside animal fat until it ferments into a piquant cheese, has been passed down by generations of transhumant herders in the Albanian Alps. Other age-old Albanian dishes include flia, a pancake with crepe-like layers brushed with cream, and byrek me mish, a Turkish-style borek laced with paprika.\n\nGjyste Bici, 67, learned centuries-old recipes at her grandmother's knee in Albania's northern Alps, where snowy winters can still cut off residents for months at a time. \"Even before communism there was little material published, so recipes were always passed from grandmothers to younger generations,\" she says.\n\nAlamy Flia is a typical and very popular Albanian dish (Credit: Alamy)\n\nMany Albanian recipes have a religious root. This was frowned upon under communism, especially after 1967, when authoritarian ruler Enver Hoxha banned all religious practices.\n\n\"The dictatorship tried to destroy all religions,\" recalls Dallendyshe Xhahysa, a 91-year-old amateur chef who memorised Albanian recipes from her ancestors and made them through the country's near-half century of communist rule. According to Xhahysa, \"recipes used in Muslim and Christian celebrations never would have survived if it wasn't for the efforts of grandmothers like me\".\n\n\"We had to cook special dishes secretly during Easter or Ramadan,\" continues Xhahysa. One such dish was halva, a dense, fudge-like dessert traditionally shared on the holiest day of Ramadan, Lailat al Qadr.\n\n\"If you cooked halva over Ramadan, neighbours would spy on you in order to get a bonus from the state,\" Xhahysa remembers. So as not to attract attention, the ingredients were purchased weeks in advance. \"We would cook halva with the windows closed or curtains drawn\" to curtail the fragrant waft of sugar, nuts and rosewater.\n\nAlamy Albanians had to make certain religious dishes, like halva, in secret during communism (Credit: Alamy)\n\nThe punishment if caught preparing a religious feast was harsh. \"We could be taken to a re-education camp for many months to be given a bad job, like cleaning a jail in a remote area,\" recalls Xhahysa, shuddering.\n\nExtreme food shortages led to the loss of other recipes. \"Very few people were allowed to keep animals or farm land,\" explains Bici. Only those in rural areas were allowed to work a 50-sq-m plot and keep a few chickens. \"It was forbidden to own a pig or sheep.\"\n\nEverything was rationed, continues Bici. \"Each month you were allowed 10kg of potatoes and 2kg of cheese per family.\"\n\nWithout easy access to ingredients or cookbooks, centuries-old recipes like tavë krapi (a baked carp casserole) were largely forgotten due to the prohibition of private fishing.\n\nUka Farm Following the fall of communism, many farmers migrated to Albanian cities, leaving only the elderly behind (Credit: Uka Farm)\n\nWhen Albania's borders finally opened up in the 1990s and its national television networks were no longer controlled by the state, many grannies started using TV to revive the nation's long-lost culinary heritage.\n\nBici began cooking on the show The Albanian Sunday in 2007, showcasing recipes she says were cooked \"for thousands of years\", like lakror me arra (an Albanian pie often made with layered ricotta, nettles, leeks, lamb and nuts).\n\nBut while Bici and Pajenga's cooking shows were helping to revive traditional recipes, they were fighting against another tide: farmers in rural Albania were migrating to Tirana in search of work and many rural villages became ghost towns. \"Farming has still not fully recovered from what happened [in the decades after communism],\" says Pajenga.\n\nBici has made it her mission to ensure Albania's traditional recipes aren't forgotten a third time. The grandmother has collated age-old cooking methods in a book, Unique Cuisine of the Albanian Highlands. She also cooks mountain recipes on the TV show Histori Shqiptare (Albanian History).\n\nUka Farm Uka Farm uses recipes from grandmothers like Xhahysa (Credit: Uka Farm)\n\n\"I have many requests from Instagram for old recipes,\" Bici says. \"If youngsters follow my recipe for lakror on TikTok, that's fine too.\"\n\nXhahysa, now a great-grandmother, is also still sharing her knowledge. She started cooking with her grandmother in the 1930s and contributed recipes to Albania's first farm-to-fork restaurant, Uka Farm, a Tirana-based wine bar and agrotourism that has inspired 100 rural farm stays across Albania.\n\nXhahysa's recipe of fërgesë (a baked vegetable dish with cheese) is a popular appetiser at Uka Farm. The farm's butter-fried peppers served with a big dollop of gjizë (a ricotta-style cheese) is a taste of Albania’s forgotten past.\n\nInspired by Pajenga, Bici and other TV-cooking grannies, a 2018 event in Tirana pairing 12 grandmothers with 12 top chefs became an instant Albanian sensation, spawning several granny-meets-millennial TV shows like Gjyshet Milionere (\"Millionaire Grandmothers\").\n\nMullixhiu Chef Bledar Kola has been turning to Albanian grandmothers to revive the nation's traditional cuisine (Credit: Mullixhiu)\n\nThe event was hosted by one of Albania's most famous chefs, Bledar Kola, who has dedicated much of his career to championing traditional Albanian cuisine. \"Not being too cocky,\" says Kola, \"but this show started a small spark on a big fire.\"\n\nAfter a career working in Europe's top restaurants, including stages at Le Gavroche in London and noma in Copenhagen, Kola returned to Tirana a decade ago to present ancient Albanian recipes in a more modern way at the capital's top restaurant Mullixhiu. In the absence of cookbooks, he also picked up skills from an Albanian granny.\n\nNow Kola is going one step further by opening a traditional restaurant in Gjirokaster, a Unesco-inscribed city in southern Albania. At the forthcoming rural restaurant Mullixhino (which is expected to open in late 2025), the focus is squarely on Albania's age-old dishes. \"The cuisine will be garden-inspired, everything cooked on an open fire, in an open kitchen,\" says Kola.\n\nThe restaurant's recipes are an homage to Albanian grandmothers. \"We've been meeting grandmothers for coffee to come up with a great concept,\" says Kola. \"We will serve traditional food from Albania's south, influenced by grandmothers in the region.\"\n\nAlamy Thanks to Albanian grandmothers, the nation's once-forgotten foods are returning (Credit: Alamy)\n\nA new foodie almanac containing 7,000 Albanian ingredients, dishes and cooking methods – many sourced from grandmothers – is also in progress and is being co-written by Kola's brother Nikolin, alongside nine academics.\n\nNikolin believes the book \"will raise awareness of Albanian food, like what René [Redzepi] did for Danish cooking\".\n\nThanks to grannies, Albanian cuisine is finally being reborn.\n\n--\n\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.",

It was meant to commemorate their “firsts” and perhaps more importantly, to inspire future generations of ladies to achieve greatness.\n\n\n\nUnfortunately, that second objective is in danger. If politicians and businesses continue to abandon diversity, equity and inclusive measures, which have helped qualified underrepresented people gain access to career opportunities, the next generation of history-makers could be drastically delayed. And, what’s more, integration in professional fields may never be achieved.\n\nThis is true of many industries, but I often think about how gender disparity shows up in the aviation field because my eight-year-old daughter wants to be a pilot, just like her dad. According the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics, women make up just 4.6% of all aircraft pilots. If my daughter were to join their ranks tomorrow, she would be among the less than 1% of them that industry groups estimate are Black women. The numbers are even bleaker for Asian and Latino women.\n\n\n\nWe should call these figures what they are: a failure of the aviation industry. If it’s routine for a person to step on an airplane and fly anywhere in the world, it shouldn’t be atypical for a woman to step on that same airplane and fly it.\n\n\n\nThere are several reasons for the lack of progress. Money is a major barrier. It can cost up to $100,000 to obtain all the hours, licenses and ratings to fly for an airline. Traditional financial aid and federal funding are not available for aviation schools because many of them are not degree-granting institutions. The lifestyle can also be a hurdle. Commercial pilots who fly for the airlines or cargo companies often travel for days at a time, and their schedules can be unpredictable. For women who are primary caregivers, it’s a career path that may not be feasible or sustainable.",

        "title": "Canada Can't Win Tariff War With US, Rosenberg Says",
        "source": "https://www.bloomberg.com/",
        "content": "00:00\n\nThe Bank of Canada has cut interest rates yet again. Canada is striking back with its own tariff measures in Trump's trade war that it's launched, he has launched against the world. Let's get more from David Rosenberg, one of our regulars. He reckons that the current environment looks similar to 1984. Now, 1984, I have to cast my mind back. Brian Mulroney became Prime minister that year and he pushed through the free trade agreement, for example, while he pushed through the free trade agreement years later. And of course, you know, working with Ronald Reagan and then George H.W. Bush. But the comparison I was drawing was how John Turner was the white knight coming from Bay Street at that point and enjoyed a honeymoon period. And the next thing you know, after the the election, the the Tories swept. So I was drawing the comparison really just to what's happening right now with Mark Carney's honeymoon period. John Turner emerged as the Liberal's liberal leader yesterday, replacing replacing Pierre Trudeau. Oh my gosh. Yeah, there are some interesting. I'm old enough to remember that. Yeah, you. You should be too. Oh, I do remember. Yeah. Yeah. I think I just miss Trudeau as prime minister. Of course, I got to Canada in 86, but I turned to Trudeau even in my twenties. Hehe. Pierre Trudeau. Yeah, he had a global impact. All right, image anyway. But anyway, let's move on to the current. Right? The current. The. You reckon that so far Canada has had an inadequate response to the Trump's tariffs? I'm very disappointed because, well, firstly I wouldn't be wasting time as an elected official in Canada talking about Donald Trump anymore. I wouldn't talk about Donald Trump. I wouldn't call him names. I wouldn't make a meeting with them contingent on him refraining from insulting us any more. Talking about annexation. I would really just stop talking about Trump and I would stop engaging in a tit for tat tariff war with the United States because it's not a war we're going to win. Okay. We're putting tariffs on their products is only going to make matters worse for consumers here in Canada at a time when there's the potential where we're going to lose 400,000 jobs. If Trump comes through with all of his tariff actions against our country, the last thing that the consumer needs. Isn't that a squeeze on their incomes from tariff action? How many jobs did you say, David? 400,000. And that would take the unemployment rate up towards 8%. I would actually engage in trade action. But where it hurts, I said before in BNN last week in a different interview, I said, when the bully in the schoolyard punch it in the eye, you don't punch back, you burn down this house. Okay? So we're trying to do what? We're trying to get into a fight with the bully in a schoolyard. No. And tariffs. Tit for tat. Tariffs are not the answer. And you look at me like, what do I do? How do you do it strategically? Through either export bans or export taxes. Let them pay. Why should consumers here pay back? Because we're going to retaliate on tariffs. Now we need the US. We know that we ship 20% of our GDP south of the border, but the US also needs us strategically, especially for critical minerals. Where are they going to get their potash? Where are they going to get the uranium? They're nickel on their aluminum or their electricity. Like I thought that Doug Ford was on the right track with the export tax and electricity. Then he pulled back. Why? Because he's going to get a phone call from Howard Lutnick. Look, you can't believe a word that the White House is saying. Okay. You brought up at the beginning of the show about the USMCA. Donald Trump signed that in 2018. And at the time he boasted that it was the best trade deal anybody has ever signed. And now he's abrogating it. So and of course, the goalposts are shifting all the time. You cannot believe a word coming out of the White House. So I don't even believe we should be negotiating anything with the White House. Let him raises tariffs he's going to dig is on hold because there's going to be an inflation backlash in the United States and consumers are not really prepared for it, at least in Canada, I'd say. Canadians are braced for very tough times ahead. Americans did not vote last November for quotes, pain or disturbance or whatever it is Donald Trump calls it. They're not prepared for any pain at all. I think that we're prepared for it. And so the point I'm making is that we should be strategic and I'm talking about not tariffs. Let them pay export taxes on stuff that is critical to their industry or outright export bans. What about oil, David? 4 million barrels a day roughly. We sell to them. Would you put an export tax? Maybe. Well, that's more problematic. But why are we offering a discount on our heavy oil into the US? Maybe we should consider removing the discount on oil into the US. I might carve out oil. And of course. Why is that? Because it's so vital. What are you going to do with the oil? That we're not going to export it to the United States? What are we going to do with that? Where's where's it going to go? But there's other things that the US needs now. Ashes to ashes. Well, yeah. Where are they going to get that from Ukraine all of a sudden. So they need that to grow their crops. There's things we could do that will hurt the US. There's really nothing we could do that's going to make it as bad as it is here. Yeah, but Americans did not vote in November for any pain whatsoever, and we could make them actually feel at least a little bit of pain. The other part is, look, what what's the Europe doing right now? The EU? They're trying to find endogenous ways to grow their economy. Germany is finally getting rid of the fiscal constraints. They're going to embark on fiscal stimulus that's going to boost military spending on a necessity. Not just that, but also infrastructure. India right now is embarking on plans to dramatically reduce their dependence on foreign energy. Pipeline expansion, oil and gas expansion in India. You look around the world and. Countries are trying to find a way to wean themselves off their dependence, especially on the United States. That's necessity. The question is, what are we doing indigenously? We're just hitting back Donald Trump insult for insult. It's not going to do anything for us. Tariff for tariff, that's not going to help our country. I said, okay, selective export taxes, export bans on stuff they need. Okay. That's going to wake up quite a few people. What about aluminum, would you? Yes, that's what I'm talking about. That would be we have to look, I said you've got massive ALU and export, but we're not where we are. And look, we are in an economic war. We're in an economic war right now, not a military war. An economic war. Okay. So, you know, you don't bring a butter knife to a gunfight. So that's basically what we have to do. We have to hit back hard. One thing we have to advantages in Canada, one of them is the Bank of Canada. The bank can or should be cutting rates a lot more aggressively, weakening the dollar a lot more aggressively. I know that Tiff Macklem comes on and says, well, you know, monetary policy is not actually an effective antidote against a trade war, but we are going to need the interest rate relief and we're going to need a weaker Canadian dollar so the Bank Canada can do what the Fed can't do because the Fed right now is hamstrung. They have more an inflation problem than we do. They're they have a 4% unemployment rate. We're closer to 7%. We have more spare capacity. The bank Canada's got more latitude to ease monetary policy. Point number one. What about fiscal policy? You know, and all I heard at the liberal convention was all about Donald Trump. Donald Trump, this, Donald Trump that. Where is our domestic fiscal strategy? We haven't had a government. We still don't have a government. We're, you know, so we're just talking about tit for tat tariffs. Where is our endogenous fiscal policy to to help cushion the blow? You want a stimulus package along the lines of but not spending. Okay, Big tax cuts. Okay. Big tax cuts. The one of the largest mistakes that the Trudeau government made was after 2017 when Trump cut the top corporate tax rate to 21%. We did nothing and it stuck. The effective tax rate with provincial abatement sits at 28%. What do you think? We're seeing relentless capital outflows out of this country. We are taxed, uncompetitive. And all I'm hearing, all I'm hearing again coming out of the convention is we are the party for the people. We're the party of the people. But what is the business sector? The business sector is made up of people. People own these businesses, they manage these businesses and we are uncompetitive. We have to actually right now get aggressive. We have to bring our corporate tax rates not just to US levels, but below US levels. I would even recommend that we eliminate capital gains taxes. We have to stimulate what's been lacking in this country for the past decade and which is bit business formation and stemming, you know, we talk about net capital outflows, net direct investment outflows out of Canada. The problem has not been capital coming into Canada. Okay? The problem has been in the past ten years, $1,000,000,000,000 of Canadian physical capital, direct investment, a trillion in ten years has left the country. So what do we want? What are you going to we have and we have the room. You know, everybody bellyache about this, about the fiscal side. We actually have one of the strongest fiscal positions in the OECD. The deficit is, God forbid, one and a half percent of GDP. Where is all this bellyaching and angst and anxiety over the Canadian federal balance sheet, one half percent deficit, GDP? Where is it in the US? It's north of 6%. Are you serious? They can't even. They have a debt to GDP ratio of 100% in Canada. Even with the provinces it's 80. But the federal government debt ratio is barely more than 40%. People don't realize that our federal fiscal finances are in better shape than Germany. And look what Germany is doing now. They're doing it on the spending side. We have to dramatically cut taxes. Okay. We go back to 1984, a blind Moroni. You brought that up at the beginning. What did he get elected on? Deregulation, which we have to do as well, and tax reform and engage in a sales tax. That was a big that was like a weight at the end of his tenure. We're talking about 1984, not 1989 and 1990. And that replaced the manufacturers sales tax. That was actually the Liberals campaigned in 1993 to get rid of the GST. Yeah, Really? Yeah. So in any event, in any event, we should be talking right now. Okay. Not about. The name calling with Trump. That's not going to get us anywhere. Tit for tat tariffs is so uncreative, unimaginative, and it's not going to help with the Canadian household. I think that we have to actually right away convene Parliament emergency session and embark on a major tax cut. Now I'm talking about a major tax cut. For the business sector. All people say, Oh, well, the business sector. What a right wing nut bar. Rosenberg is the business sector. The business sector in this country employs two thirds of the people in this in the workforce. Let me ask you something here, because you put something in my head. Ireland did very well with essentially zero tax for foreign companies. Do you think it should think about something like that? Absolutely. Absolutely. What I'm talking about is what they should have done back in 2017, 2018. We never should have let our tax gap in the in the business sector. Oh, there's that word again, businesses. I get this all the time, you know, but I guess it doesn't play in Peoria. You've got to talk about the people. I keep on selling. You know, that's two thirds of the people are employed by the business sector. And we have to prevent what's going to happen if we don't embark on a massive tax cut campaign. And it's going to be advertised so that people understand how important it's going to be to prevent capital flight out of the country with these tariff increases. And this attempt, this attempt by Trump is to relocate production in the United States. We could fight back. But fiscal policy, they can't. In the United States, you see what's happening in Congress. They can't even get their their stopgap funding measure through. Okay. But if we can either get a minority government and liberals in service can agree on this, or we got a majority government. So we have to think right away because we can't do it on spending this. The legs are too long, but tax cuts will be felt right away.",

Promotions are subject to availability and retailer terms.\n\nChoosing the right type of CD could have a big impact on your potential earnings in today's rate environment. Getty Images/iStockphoto\n\nIn today's uncertain interest rate environment, finding the right certificate of deposit (CD) account is more important than ever. With the Federal Reserve's ongoing evaluations of economic conditions, rates could fluctuate in the coming months, leaving savers wondering whether to lock in a fixed rate now or choose a CD option that allows for potential rate increases. The decision hinges on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and expectations for future rate movements.\n\nOne option gaining attention is the bump-up CD, which allows account holders to increase their annual percentage yield (APY) if market rates rise during the CD's term. This flexibility can be advantageous in a rising rate environment. Similarly, step-up CDs offer gradual, scheduled rate increases over time, which can provide peace of mind in uncertain conditions. For those who prefer stability, traditional CDs remain a strong choice.\n\nBut while each type of CD has its advantages, it also has its drawbacks, making it crucial to weigh your options carefully and align your choice with your financial strategy.\n\nFind out how high your CD rate could be now.\n\nIs a bump-up CD better right now?\n\nA bump-up CD is a type of CD account that allows you to capitalize on CD rate upticks by increasing your annual percentage rate (APY) before the account has matured. Your bank determines the rules for your bump-ups, but, in general, you can increase your CD rate if the rate being offered by your bank on the term you chose has increased.\n\nSo, for example, if you open a 2-year CD at a rate of 4.2% and, after one year, your bank starts offering a rate of 4.8% on 2-year CDs, you can opt to increase your rate to what your bank is currently offering. That said, you can typically only increase your CD rate once or twice, depending on your bank's bump-up CD terms.\n\nThe main advantage of opening a bump-up CD right now is that it allows you to boost your APY should rates increase in the future. Given the current uncertainty within the rate environment, that could be appealing to the right type of saver, as there's always a chance that rates will increase in the future — especially if inflation creeps back up again.\n\nHowever, bump-up CDs have a few drawbacks right now, too. First, the starting rates on bump-up CDs may be lower than traditional CDs, so you may have to start with a lower rate initially if you want to take advantage of this feature. And, with the possibility of Fed rate cuts occurring later this year, there's a chance that CD rates won't move higher before your CD matures. So, you could end up accepting a lower initial rate and then not have an opportunity to \"bump up\" your rate down the road.\n\nSecure a top CD account rate now.\n\nIs a step-up CD better right now?\n\nA step-up CD is a type of CD account that has scheduled rate increases that continue until maturity. For example, a bank may offer a 3-year step-up CD with an interest rate that increases by 0.15 percentage points every six months. So, if you start with a 0.05% APY, you'd get five rate increases of 0.15%, resulting in a final APY of 0.80%.\n\nThe main benefit of opening a step-up CD right now is that the rate you earn will increase on a schedule. With the uncertainty in today's rate environment, having an account that automatically raises your interest rate on a set schedule could pay off.\n\nThat being said, step-up CDs have a big drawback right now: the starting APYs are typically far lower than rates on traditional CD accounts. So, even with the stepped-up rates, the interest you earn may be far lower than it would be with a traditional account currently.\n\nIs a traditional CD better right now?\n\nTraditional CDs are CD accounts that come with a fixed rate that stays the same from the day you open your account to the day it matures. Traditional CDs don't have the rate-change option or features that step-up and bump-up CDs do.\n\nBut despite the lack of extra features, a traditional CD still offers multiple benefits in the current rate environment. To start, banks tend to offer more traditional CD account options than other types of CD accounts, which gives you a wider pool of CDs to choose from. And, traditional CDs have maintained relatively high interest rates across most term lengths. Locking in those rates now protects you against shifts to the overall rate environment, which is important given the uncertainty of where rates could head over time.\n\nThe main drawback of a traditional CD is one it shares with step-up and bump-up CDs: less liquidity. Most traditional CDs have early withdrawal penalties that are charged if you withdraw the money from your account before maturity. That could be problematic if you decide to try and access the funds in your account before your term ends.\n\nThe bottom line\n\nWhen choosing between bump-up, step-up and traditional CDs, it's essential to consider both the current rate environment and your long-term savings goals. If you anticipate rising rates, a bump-up or step-up CD could provide flexibility, but traditional CDs may offer the best rates upfront and protect against potential declines. Understanding the terms, limitations and potential returns of each option will help you make a more informed decision.\n\nUltimately, the best CD for you depends on your financial needs and risk tolerance. Whether you prioritize locking in a high rate now or maintaining flexibility for potential increases, carefully reviewing your options will ensure you maximize your savings in today's unpredictable interest rate landscape.",

        "content": "A judge in Maryland has blocked for now the mass firings of probationary federal workers and ordered thousands of fired probationary workers to be reinstated, marking the second decision of its kind in a day.\n\nThe order from U.S. District Judge James Bredar came late Thursday in a lawsuit filed by 19 states and the District of Columbia against multiple federal agencies alleging the mass firings are illegal.\n\n\"In this case, the government conducted massive layoffs, but it gave no advance notice,\" Bredar wrote. \"It claims it wasn't required to because, it says, it dismissed each one of these thousands of probationary employees for 'performance' or other individualized reasons. On the record before the Court, this isn't true. There were no individualized assessments of employees. They were all just fired. Collectively.\"\n\nThe states contend the Trump administration blindsided them by ignoring laws set out for large-scale layoffs, which already are having an impact on state governments as they try to help the suddenly jobless. At least 24,000 probationary employees have been terminated since President Trump took office, the lawsuit alleges, though efforts by the judge to get an estimate from a government attorney at a hearing Wednesday were unsuccessful.\n\nDemonstrators hold signs during a rally outside the Department of Education headquarters in Washington, D.C., on March 13, 2025. President Trump was sued by a group of mostly Democratic-led states over his alleged plan to effectively dismantle the Education Department by slashing its workforce in half. Al Drago/Bloomberg via Getty Images\n\nThe Trump administration argues that the states have no right to try and influence the federal government's relationship with its own workers. Mr. Trump has said he's targeting fraud, waste and abuse in a bloated federal government.\n\nIn his temporary restraining order, Bredar issued a 14-day stay on what he called \"illegal\" reductions in force. His order, however, did not apply to firings at the Department of Defense, the National Archives and Records Administration and the Office of Personnel Management.\n\n\"So, although it is a close call, at this early stage, and given that a TRO is 'an extraordinary remedy that may only be awarded upon a clear showing that the plaintiff is entitled to such relief,'...there is insufficient basis in the record for the Court to conclude that RIFs likely occurred at these three agencies,\" Bredar wrote.\n\nEarlier Thursday, a federal judge in San Francisco also ordered the Trump's administration to rehire thousands, if not tens of thousands, of probationary workers let go in mass firings across multiple agencies.\n\nU.S. District Judge William Alsup said that the terminations were directed by the Office of Personnel Management and its acting director, Charles Ezell, who lacked the authority to do so.\n\nThe administration immediately filed an appeal of the injunction with the Ninth Circuit Court. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt earlier Thursday cast the ruling as an attempt to encroach on executive power to hire and fire employees.\n\n\"The Trump Administration will immediately fight back against this absurd and unconstitutional order,\" she said in a statement.\n\nAlsup's order tells the departments of Veterans Affairs, Agriculture, Defense, Energy, the Interior and the Treasury to immediately offer job reinstatement to employees terminated on or about Feb. 13 and 14. He also directed the departments to report back within seven days with a list of probationary employees and an explanation of how the agencies complied with his order as to each person.",

Promotions are subject to availability and retailer terms.\n\nThere are some simple strategies you can use to earn big returns on the money in your checking and savings accounts right now. Andrii Yalanskyi/Getty Images\n\nIt wasn't that long ago that earning meaningful interest on a checking or savings account was nearly impossible. For years, banks offered savings and checking accounts with rates so low they were hardly worth considering. But times have changed. Today's high-rate environment has opened up new opportunities for savers to earn real money just by parking their cash in the right places. So, if you're still earning next to nothing on your savings or checking account balances, it's time to explore better options.\n\nFor example, there are currently a number of simple ways to earn returns of 3% or more on the money in your savings and checking accounts. However, these opportunities don't always land in your lap. Finding them typically requires a bit of research, strategic planning and, in some cases, minor adjustments to how you manage your money. But even a little effort can pay off significantly, allowing you to earn hundreds or even thousands of dollars in extra interest each year.\n\nSo how can you take advantage of the opportunities to earn 3% or more on the money in your checking and savings accounts right now? Below, we'll show you how to get started.\n\nStart earning more interest on your money here now.\n\nHow to earn 3% or more on your checking and savings accounts now\n\nIf your goal is to earn the highest rate possible on your checking and savings accounts, here are a few steps you may want to take:\n\nShop around for the best offers\n\nOne of the easiest ways to start earning more on your deposits is to look beyond your current bank. Many traditional banks still offer checking and savings accounts with interest rates close to 0%, which means your money isn't growing much at all. So, you may want to consider switching to an online bank or a credit union instead, as these institutions do not have the same overhead costs as brick-and-mortar banks, and, in turn, can provide much higher yields.\n\nFor example, right now, some online banks are offering high-yield savings accounts with annual percentage yields (APYs) of 3% or more — well above the average savings account rate of 0.41%. If you're going to take this route, though, just be sure to read the fine print. Some accounts may have balance requirements or other conditions to qualify for the highest rates.\n\nOpen a top savings account and start maximizing your returns today.\n\nExplore reward checking accounts with rate conditions\n\nSome of today's best high-yielding checking accounts offer 4% rates (or higher) if you meet certain monthly requirements, and if you can meet these conditions, these types of accounts can be an easy way to maximize your interest returns. For example, you may need to make a certain number of debit card purchases, set up direct deposit and opt for paperless statements to earn these types of returns.\n\nThe extra effort required to meet the conditions is often well worth the significantly higher returns, especially if you're able to meet the requirements without changing your habits significantly. Note, though, that some of these accounts will limit the high rate to balances under a certain amount, offering lower rates on amounts above that threshold. So, be sure to read the fine print before opening any accounts.\n\nTake advantage of bank bonuses and special offers\n\nMany banks offer cash bonuses to new customers who open a savings or checking account (or a combination of the two) and meet certain requirements. These bonuses can range from $100 to $500 or more, effectively boosting your overall return. While these are one-time offers, they can be an easy way to earn extra money in addition to the interest you'll be earning on your deposits.\n\nFor example, earning a $300 bonus on a $10,000 deposit effectively adds 3% to your annual return. While that may not be a 3% return in the traditional sense, it's still the equivalent of earning an annual return on that balance at that rate.\n\nTo qualify for these promotions, you may need to set up direct deposit, maintain a minimum balance or complete a specific number of transactions within a set period. If you're already planning to switch banks, though, taking advantage of a sign-up bonus is a great way to sweeten the deal.\n\nShift to a cash management account\n\nAnother excellent option for earning a high return on your money is a cash management account. These accounts, often offered by brokerage firms and financial technology companies, function as a hybrid between checking and savings accounts, offering high interest rates — many cash management account rates surpass 3% currently — while providing convenient access to your funds. And, if you're also investing in stocks, bonds or exchange-traded funds, having your money in a cash management account allows for easy transfers between your savings and investment accounts.\n\nThe bottom line\n\nBefore you settle for a low-yield savings or checking account, consider the other opportunities available in today's high-rate environment to maximize your earnings. With a little research and strategic planning, you can take advantage of high-yield accounts, reward checking options, bank bonuses and cash management accounts to significantly boost your returns. By exploring these options and taking action now, you can ensure that your hard-earned money is working as efficiently as possible for you.",

        "source": "https://www.cbsnews.com/",
        "content": "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has ordered a review of military standards, including physical fitness, body composition and grooming. It's a review Hegseth promised during his confirmation hearing when questioned about his statements he's made that military standards have eroded.\n\n\"That will be part of one of the first things we do at the Pentagon — is reviewing that in a gender-neutral way — the standards ensuring readiness and meritocracy is front and center,\" Hegseth said in January.\n\nThe Pentagon released a memo Wednesday night from Hegseth that directs the undersecretary of defense for personnel and readiness to review the existing standards set by the military departments.\n\n\"We must remain vigilant in maintaining the standards that enable the men and women of our military to protect the American people and our homeland as the world's most lethal and effective fighting force,\" Hegseth said. \"Our adversaries are not growing weaker, and our tasks are not growing less challenging.\"\n\nFILE - In this Jan. 8, 2019, file photo, U.S Army troops in training to become instructors participate in the new Army combat fitness test at the 108th Air Defense Artillery Brigade compound at Fort Bragg, N.C. Gerry Broome / AP\n\nThe memo directs the review to examine the standards and how they have changed since Jan. 1, 2015. In December 2015, the Defense Department announced it would open up all combat roles to women.\n\nHegseth has previously opposed that policy decision, saying in a podcast interview shortly before he was tapped as defense secretary, \"We should not have women in combat roles. It hasn't made us more effective. Hasn't made us more lethal.\"\n\nHegseth walked that view back somewhat during his confirmation hearing, promising that women would have access to combat roles if the standards remain high and \"have not been eroded.\"\n\nKatherine Kuzminski, the director of studies at the Center for a New American Security, told CBS News in an interview there are separate requirements for men and women, as well as for different ages, to pass the Army Combat Fitness Test that every recruit has to pass. To qualify for special forces, however, the standards are gender-neutral.\n\n\"Those standards are uniform across the genders,\" Kuzminski said, \"which is why we have only seen very small numbers of women going into special operations.\"\n\nFor example, as of early January, according to data provided by the Army, there have been 156 female graduates of the notoriously grueling Ranger Course, with 381 women attending the course since it was first made available to women in 2015, for a graduation rate of approximately 41%.\n\nThe Ranger Course requires all candidates to swim 15 meters in full uniform, run five miles in under 40 minutes and march 12 miles with a 35-lb. ruck, according to the Army.\n\n\"The standards have not been lowered, and each Ranger Course graduate meets the same training standards,\" an Army official told CBS News.\n\nThe Pentagon's review could lead to a change in the Army Combat Fitness test, the generic test, so that the requirements are the same for men and women.\n\nCurrently, the Army Combat Fitness test is scored based on different requirements for men and women, depending on age. For instance, a man who's 17 to 21 years of age must at a minimum be able to run two miles in 22 minutes, while a woman would need to run the same distance in 23:22. The minimum requirement for hand-release push-ups — which involve lifting your hands off the ground at the bottom of the push-up — is the same for men and women of any age: 10.\n\nFacing a recruiting crisis, services in recent years have offered adjustments on drug and tattoo policies and provided enlistment bonuses to attract potential service members, while still maintaining physical and educational standards. The Army also launched pre-enlistment boot camps to help potential candidates get into shape before going into basic training.\n\nHegseth said during his confirmation hearing that while writing his book \"War on Warriors,\" he spoke to service members who told him that \"in ways direct, indirect, overt and subtle\" standards have changed, but Hegseth didn't provide senators with concrete examples.\n\nKuzminski also said the defense secretary's review could include revisiting grooming standards, like the Army allowing women to wear ponytails or the Navy permitting some men to grow facial hair, due to a medical condition exacerbated by shaving.\n\n\"They seem like little things, but they were also tied to a broader initiative during the Biden administration to ensure that there weren't any standards that were disproportionately affecting minorities,\" Kuzminski said.\n\nKuzminski added that changing those back may have some impact on recruiting or retention, but \"it's not something that's going to break the force because the objective of every person in uniform is professionalism, and they will follow through the standard, whatever the standard is.\"",

        "content": "President Trump on Saturday invoked the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to order the swift detention and deportation of all Venezuelan migrants suspected of being members of the Tren de Aragua prison gang, treating them like wartime enemies of the U.S. government.\n\nIn his proclamation, the president argued the Venezuelan gang was \"perpetrating, attempting, and threatening an invasion or predatory incursion against the territory of the United States,\" the legal threshold for invoking the 227-year-old war authority.\n\nThe president directed the Departments of Homeland Security and Justice to \"apprehend, restrain, secure, and remove every\" Venezuelan migrant, 14 or older, who is deemed to be part of Tren de Aragua and who lacks U.S. citizenship or permanent residency.\n\nThose subject to the law would be eligible to be summarily arrested, detained and deported, without any of the due process protections outlined in U.S. immigration law, which include opportunities to see a judge and request asylum. Instead, they would be treated as enemy aliens and processed under America's wartime laws.\n\nBut Mr. Trump's directive was dealt an almost immediate blow on Saturday, after a federal judge agreed to block the government from deporting anyone in U.S. immigration custody subject to the president's Alien Enemies Act proclamation.\n\nAt the request of a lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union, James Boasberg, chief judge for the U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C., temporarily blocked those deportations through a 14-day temporary restraining order. Deportation flights in the air with deportees subject to Mr. Trump's decree should return to the U.S., Boasberg indicated during a hearing Saturday evening.\n\nEarlier Saturday, Boasberg issued another order blocking the deportation of five Venezuelan migrants in immigration detention who the ACLU said we were at risk of being expelled under Mr. Trump's directive.\n\n\"We are thrilled the judge recognized the severe harm our plaintiffs would face if removed,\" said Lee Gelernt, the ACLU attorney leading the lawsuit against Mr. Trump's proclamation. \"The President's use of the Alien Enemies Act is flat out lawless.\"\n\nMr. Trump's extraordinary order is breathtaking in its scope and has little precedent in U.S. history. The law it cites, enacted 22 years after the Declaration of Independence, references invasions and incursions staged by \"any foreign nation or government.\"\n\nThe centuries-old statue has been invoked only a few times in American history, including during World War I and World War II, when U.S. officials cited it to surveil and detain foreigners from Italy, Germany and Japan.\n\nBut never before has the Aliens Enemies Act been invoked to target migrants from countries with which the U.S. is not actively at war or with the premise that a non-state actor is staging an invasion or incursion of the U.S.\n\nMr. Trump in his order argued Tren de Aragua is \"closely aligned\" with the repressive government of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro.\n\n\"(Tren de Aragua) has engaged in and continues to engage in mass illegal migration to the United States to further its objectives of harming United States citizens, undermining public safety, and supporting the Maduro regime's goal of destabilizing democratic nations in the Americas, including the United States,\" Mr. Trump said in his order.",

        "source": "https://www.cbsnews.com/",
        "content": "Trump says \"nobody is expelling any Palestinians\" from Gaza in proposed U.S. takeover plan\n\nDuring a meeting on Wednesday with Ireland's leader Michel Martin, President Trump made an offhand remark that was quickly picked up in the Middle East as a major change in his stance on the war-torn Gaza Strip and its roughly 2 million Palestinian inhabitants.\n\n\"Nobody is expelling any Palestinians,\" Mr. Trump told reporters.\n\nThat came after he repeatedly said that under his own proposal to rebuild Gaza, all of its residents would be moved out, while the U.S. moved in to \"take over\" the coastal territory to turn it into a luxury real estate development. Just a month ago, Mr. Trump was clear that, in his mind, not only would Palestinians need to leave Gaza, they would not be permitted to return.\n\nThat plan was roundly and clearly rejected by Arab countries, including Egypt and Jordan, which Mr. Trump had said would take in the displaced masses.\n\nEgypt, which has led efforts to present an alternative plan for Gaza that does not involve displacing Palestinians, welcomed the change in tone by Mr. Trump.\n\n\"Egypt expresses its appreciation for the statements made by U.S. President, Donald Trump… regarding the non-displacement of the residents of the Gaza Strip,\" the Egyptian Foreign Ministry said in a statement on Thursday. \"Egypt affirms that this position reflects an understanding of the importance of avoiding further deterioration of the humanitarian situation in the Strip and the necessity of working towards finding just and sustainable solutions to the Palestinian cause.\"\n\nA boy looks over a newly established tent camp for displaced Palestinians whose homes were damaged by Israeli army strikes in the Zeitoun neighborhood of Gaza City on Friday, March 7, 2025. Jehad Alshrafi / AP\n\nHamas, the U.S. and Israeli designated terrorist organization that sparked the war in Gaza with its brutal Oct. 7, 2023 attack on Israel, also cautiously welcomed the shift in Mr. Trump's rhetoric.\n\n\"If Trump's statements represent a retreat from the idea of Palestinian displacement, then they are welcomed,\" a statement from the group's spokesperson said.\n\nMr. Trump's remarks came Wednesday after his senior envoy Steve Witkoff met with the foreign ministers of five Arab nations in Qatar to discuss Gaza's post-war future. That future, regardless of what reconstruction plan is eventually implemented, can only start taking shape once there is an official end to the war, however.\n\nA fragile truce between Israel and Hamas has largely kept the peace since January 19, but the two sides have not yet agreed on whether to extend the first phase of the agreement, or to move onto a second phase as originally envisioned. The dialogue in Doha, Qatar, involving delegations from the host-nation as well as Egypt, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Jordan and the U.S. is aimed at pushing the process forward – and keeping the guns silent in Gaza.\n\nThe five Arab nations involved have pushed the Egyptian-crafted alternative to Mr. Trump's \"Riviera of the Mideast\" proposal in their talks with American officials.\n\nThe Arab plan, the rough outline of which officials shared with CBS News earlier this month, carries a price tag of $53 billion and envisions all of the enclave's residents remaining in Gaza throughout the years-long reconstruction. The Trump administration initially rejected the plan, with U.S. National Security Council spokesman Brian Hughes issuing a statement saying it failed to \" address the reality that Gaza is currently uninhabitable and residents cannot humanely live in a territory covered in debris and unexploded ordnance.\"\n\n\"President Trump stands by his vision to rebuild Gaza free from Hamas,\" Hughes said at the time, adding: \"We look forward to further talks to bring peace and prosperity to the region.\"\n\nIt appeared on Wednesday, with Mr. Trump's remarks at the White House, that those further talks with America's regional partners may have convinced the White House that displacing the entire population of Gaza was not a tenable proposition.\n\n\"The Arab foreign ministers presented the Gaza reconstruction plan, which was approved at the Arab Summit held in Cairo on March 4, 2025,\" the five Arab nations that met in Doha said in a joint statement shared Wednesday. \"They also agreed with the U.S. envoy to continue consultations and coordination on this plan as a basis for the reconstruction efforts in the sector.\"\n\nThat Egyptian plan has been adopted by the broad Muslim solidarity group of 57 countries known as the Organization of Islamic Cooperation. It envisions the Gaza Strip eventually being run by the Palestinian Authority, which currently administers parts of the Israeli-occupied West Bank, not by Hamas.\n\nThat will likely prove an ongoing point of contention as the PA holds little support among Palestinians and has been dismissed as a potential future Gaza administrator by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, showing there's still much negotiation ahead if Mr. Trump is to make good on his vows to end the crisis in the heart of the Middle East.",

He was relentlessly hunted down by our intrepid warfighters\" in coordination with the Iraqi government and the Kurdish regional government.\n\n\"PEACE THROUGH STRENGTH!\" Trump posted.\n\nCENTCOM reported in a social media post that Abu Khadija was killed in a \"precision airstrike\" Thursday in Iraq's Al Anbar Province in an operation involving Iraqi intelligence and CENTCOM forces. A second ISIS operative was also killed in the strike. Aerial video of the strike was also released.\n\nFollowing the airstrike, U.S. and Iraqi forces moved in to find both deceased terrorists wearing unexploded suicide vests and armed with multiple weapons, CENTCOM said. Abu Khadijah was identified using DNA testing which had been collected during a previous raid which he had escaped.\n\n\"Abu Khadijah was one of the most important ISIS members in the entire global ISIS organization,\" said Gen. Michael Erik Kurilla, commander of CENTCOM, in a statement. \"We will continue to kill terrorists and dismantle their organizations that threaten our homeland and U.S., allied and partner personnel in the region and beyond.\"\n\nThe announcement came on the same day as the first visit by Syria's top diplomat to Iraq, during which the two countries pledged to work together to combat the Islamic State.\n\nIraqi Foreign Minister Fouad Hussein said at a news conference that \"there are common challenges facing Syrian and Iraqi society, and especially the terrorists of IS.\" He said the officials had spoken \"in detail about the movements of ISIS, whether on the Syrian-Iraqi border, inside Syria or inside Iraq\" during the visit.\n\nSyrian Foreign Minister Asaad Hassan al-Shaibani (L) and Iraqi Foreign Minister Fuad Hussein (R) hold a joint press conference after their meeting in Baghdad, Iraq, on March 14, 2025. Murtadha Al-Sudani/Anadolu via Getty Images\n\nHussein referred to an operations room formed by Syria, Iraq, Turkey, Jordan and Lebanon at a recent meeting in Amman to confront IS, and said it would soon begin work.\n\nThe relationship between Iraq and Syria is somewhat fraught after the fall of former Syrian President Bashar Assad. Al-Sudani came to power with the support of a coalition of Iran-backed factions, and Tehran was a major backer of Assad. The current interim president of Syria, Ahmad al-Sharaa, was previously known as Abu Mohammed al-Golani and fought as an al-Qaida militant in Iraq after the U.S. invasion of 2003, and later fought against Assad's government in Syria.\n\nBut Syrian interim Foreign Minister Asaad Hassan al-Shibani focused on the historic ties between the two countries.\n\n\"Throughout history, Baghdad and Damascus have been the capitals of the Arab and Islamic world, sharing knowledge, culture and economy,\" he said.\n\nStrengthening the partnership between the two countries \"will not only benefit our peoples, but will also contribute to the stability of the region, making us less dependent on external powers and better able to determine our own destiny,\" he said.\n\nThe operation and the visit come at a time when Iraqi officials are anxious about an Islamic State resurgence in the wake of the fall of Assad in Syria.\n\nWhile Syria's new rulers — led by the Islamist former insurgent group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham — have pursued Islamic State cells since taking power, some fear a breakdown in overall security that could allow the group to stage a resurgence.\n\nThe U.S. and Iraq announced an agreement last year to wind down the military mission in Iraq of an American-led coalition fighting the Islamic State group by September 2025, with U.S. forces departing some bases where they have stationed troops during a two-decade-long military presence in the country.\n\nWhen the agreement was reached to end the coalition's mission in Iraq, Iraqi political leaders said the threat of the Islamic State was under control and they no longer needed Washington's help to beat back the remaining cells.\n\nBut the fall of Assad in December led some to reassess that stance, including members of the Coordination Framework, a coalition of mainly Shiite, Iran-allied political parties that brought current Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammad Shia al-Sudani to power in late 2022.",

        "content": "Cairo — Sarah al-Awady says she was sitting with her family early on the morning of Oct. 22, 2024, in their tent in Al-Zawaida, the town in the central Gaza Strip where the displaced Palestinians had taken shelter, when she was struck in the head by a bullet fired by an Israeli quadcopter drone.\n\n\"Suddenly I felt pain in my head, like I had been hit with an iron bar or something,\" the 18-year-old Gazan told CBS News this week. \"My family started screaming, 'a bullet, a bullet!' Everyone was panicking and they carried me and rushed me to Shuhada al-Aqsa Hospital.\"\n\nCBS News has asked the Israel Defense Forces about its reported use of small-arms-equipped drones in Gaza, and about al-Awady's claim, specifically, that she was hit by one of the weapons in a camp for displaced civilians. In a statement sent Wednesday, the IDF said it \"follows international law, targeting only military objectives and takes feasible precautions to mitigate civilian harm.\"\n\nThe military said it could not give details about the various aircraft it uses, \"as they are classified for security reasons, and to avoid compromising the operational capabilities of the IDF,\" and added that it could not provide information about al-Awady's claim without more precise information on the time and location of the shooting.\n\nSarah al-Awady is seen not long after she says she was struck in the head by a bullet fired by an Israeli quadcopter drone as she sat in a tent with her family on Oct. 22, 2024, in Al-Zawaida, central Gaza. The bullet lodged in her skull behind her right eye. Courtesy of Sarah al-Awady\n\nThe doctors did what they could with what little they had amid the devastation in Gaza, just over a year after Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023 terrorist attack sparked the war in the Palestinian territory. They could see that the bullet was lodged in al-Awady's skull, behind her right eye, but they didn't have the capacity to remove it.\n\nAl-Awady was eventually told there was nothing more the doctors in Gaza could do, but she refused to give up hope and insisted on staying in the hospital. At the very least, she thought, inside the hospital her badly wounded eye would be protected from the dusty conditions in her family's makeshift home.\n\nSo she remained, relying on painkillers to cope with the excruciating pain in her head, but without any plan for relief in sight.\n\nIn early November, al-Awady was seen by a team of volunteer medics visiting the European Hospital near Khan Younis, in southern Gaza. Dr. Mohamed Tawfik, an Egyptian, was among the volunteers, and when he saw al-Awady, he thought of someone he believed could help.\n\nTawfik called his father, a veteran ophthalmologist, to get his medical opinion.\n\nDr. Ahmed Tawfik, the elder doctor, told CBS News he wanted to go to Gaza to try to help the young woman, but the southern Rafah border crossing between the enclave and Egypt was closed.\n\n\"I followed this case almost daily. I felt this was my case,\" Tawfik said.\n\nBut he could not find a way to travel to Gaza and, at the time, with the war still raging, Israel was permitting very few people to leave the enclave, even for medical treatment.\n\nThe doctor's son returned to Egypt, and al-Awady told CBS News she started giving up hope. For months she said she lived in fear that she would permanently lose sight in her right eye.\n\n\"I applied for treatment abroad, like many others. When people asked me, 'How long have you been waiting?' I'd say a month. They'd tell me, 'Forget it, we've been waiting for so much longer.'\"\n\nA glimmer of hope would finally come, about three months after the bullet lodged in al-Awady's head, with the news that Israel and Hamas had agreed to a ceasefire deal. It came into effect on Jan. 19, 2024, and al-Awady was able to return to her home in the decimated north of Gaza.\n\nShe said she was relieved to find her family's home among the few buildings spared from the destruction. She stayed there for a week, until, on the evening of February 8, she received a call from the World Health Organization, telling her she would be leaving the following day for Egypt.\n\n\"There is no electricity, so I literally packed my luggage by candlelight,\" she recalled. Only her mother was permitted to travel with her, but the pair reached Egypt the next day, as planned.\n\nShe was sent first to the city of Port Said, on Egypt's Mediterranean coast. A week later, Dr. Tawfik managed to get her moved to the hospital where he works in Al-Sharqia Governorate, in the Nile Delta.\n\nThree teams — ophthalmology, neurosurgery and radiology — worked together, debating the best approach to remove the bullet that had been lodged for months right next to al-Awady's optic nerve.\n\n\"We ran several simulations to find the best route to avoid the optic nerve,\" Dr. Mohamed Khaled Shawky, of the Al Nour Radiology Center, told CBS News. He helped guide the surgery remotely via a video link from his workstation at the separate facility.\n\nA scan image shows a bullet lodged behind the right eye of Sarah al-Awady, with its entry point visible as the gunshot wound at the top of her skull. Courtesy of Dr. Mohamed Khaled Shawky/Al-Nour Radiology Center\n\n\"The bullet landed in the best possible place for the patient, but the worst place for a medical team,\" Shawky told CBS News. \"Had it moved a millimeter in any direction, it would have caused great damage.\"\n\nThe doctors agreed the best option was to try to reach the bullet by entering through al-Awady's eye socket, to avoid damaging her brain.\n\nTawfik was direct, telling al-Awady there was a 50% chance of success, a risk of internal bleeding, and she could lose her eye entirely or have her vision severely impaired.\n\n\"I cried. I was very scared, but I prayed and accepted the risk,\" she told CBS News.\n\n\"His amazing medical team tried their best to improve my spirit, to make me psychologically ready, and they did. I entered the operating room laughing and full of joy,\" al-Awady said\n\nThe surgery was carried out last week, and it was a success. Tawfik told CBS News he was surprised by the amount of infection and abscess caused by the bullet, which had rusted over time inside al-Awady's head.\n\nDr. Ahmed Tawfik, CEO of the Al-Ferdaws eye hospital in Egypt, stands with his patient, Sarah al-Awady, after he helped to remove a bullet that had been lodged in her skull for four months. Courtesy of Dr. Ahmed Tawfik/Al-Ferdaws hospital\n\nEven with the bullet out, al-Awady is not fully out of the woods.\n\n\"Three hours later, I opened my eyes and they told me that, thanks to God, all went well,\" she recalled. \"I started crying again.\"\n\n\"She is very stable now, and she is taking her meds and getting better,\" Tawfik told CBS News. \"My goal was first to end the pain caused by the infection and, second, to preserve her current eyesight level. I am hoping that after we deal with the retinal detachment her sight will improve.\"\n\nThe young woman's eye will never look — or see — the same way it did before she was shot.\n\nLike many Palestinians who have made it out of Gaza to receive desperately needed medical help, al-Awady told CBS News that her joy is incomplete. She misses the rest of her family, who she had to leave behind.\n\nPalestinian Sarah al-Awady holds the bullet that doctors removed from her head in Egypt. Courtesy of Sarah al-Awady\n\nAsked about the rusty bullet that lived in her head for four months, she said she planned to hold onto it.\n\n\"I am thinking of framing it,\" she told CBS News.",

        "content": "What is the Alien Enemies Act that Trump plans on using to deport migrants to Guantanamo Bay?\n\nA federal judge on Saturday night temporarily blocked President Trump from removing immigrants under a wartime law known as the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 after the president announced earlier in the day that he would enforce the law.\n\nThe judge's ruling was in response to a federal civil lawsuit filed Saturday by a group of five Venezuelan men in immigration custody in Texas and New York local jails against President Trump and other administration officials.\n\nMr. Trump invoked the 227-year-old wartime law earlier Saturday.\n\nThe lawsuit filed in federal court in Washington, D.C., by attorneys with the ACLU and Democracy Forward argues the Alien Enemies Act is \"a wartime measure that has been used only three times in our Nation's history: the War of 1812, World War I and World War II.\"\n\nPresidents are given the extraordinary power by the 227-year-old law to order the arrest, detention and deportation of noncitizens who are 14 years or older and come from countries staging an \"invasion or predatory incursion\" of the U.S.\n\nJames E. Boasberg, chief judge of the District Court for the U.S. District of Columbia, on Saturday implemented a temporary restraining order preventing their deportations for 14 days. The Justice Department appealed that decision, arguing the D.C. court has no authority over the case because none of the five men are in the district. Four are being held in detention in Texas and one in New York. They further argue that invocation of the Alien Enemies Act is \"speculation.\"\n\n\"We are thrilled the judge recognized the severe harm our plaintiffs would face if removed,\" said Lee Gelernt, the ACLU attorney leading the lawsuit against Mr. Trump's proclamation. \"The President's use of the Alien Enemies Act is flat out lawless.\"\n\nThen, following an emergency hearing Saturday evening, Boasberg expanded his order to include \"all noncitizens in U.S. custody\" who are covered by Mr. Trump's move to invoke the Alien Enemies Act.\n\nBoasberg also appeared to indicate that any deportation flights that were currently in the air with migrants subject to this order on board should be returned to the U.S.\n\nThe lawsuit states that Mr. Trump is \"expected to authorize immediate removal of noncitizens that the Proclamation deems to be alien enemies, without any opportunity for judicial review.\"\n\n\"It also contorts the plain language of the Act: arrivals of noncitizens from Venezuela are deemed an 'invasion' or 'predatory incursion' by a 'foreign nation or government,' where Tren de Aragua, a Venezuelan gang, is deemed to be sufficiently akin to a foreign nation or government,\" the lawsuit alleges.\n\nAs such, the government can identify any Venezuelan in the U.S. as a member of that gang, regardless of facts, and seek to deport them, the lawsuit alleges.\n\nIn the civil lawsuit, the men also argue the Alien Enemies Act \"has only ever been a power invoked in time of war, and plainly only applies to warlike actions: it cannot be used here against nationals of a country — Venezuela — with whom the United States is not at war, which is not invading the United States, and which has not launched a predatory incursion into the United States.\"\n\nThe next hearing in the case is scheduled for March 21.\n\nand contributed to this report.",

        "content": "Cuba suffered a massive power outage Friday night affecting Havana and the country's provinces that left millions in the dark.\n\nCuba's Ministry of Energy and Mines said at around 8:15 p.m. local time an outage at the Diezmero substation on the outskirts of Havana had caused \"a significant loss of generation in western Cuba and, with it, the failure of the National Electric System.\"\n\nThe ministry said on its account on the social platform X that it is \"working on the recovery process.\"\n\nThe streets of Havana were dark and empty, with light coming only from the windows of hotels that had generators. Internet and telephone service were intermittent about 18 hours after power went out.\n\nPeople in provinces as far away as Guantánamo, Artemisa, Santiago de Cuba, and Santa Clara reported experiencing blackouts with just flickers of light.\n\nResidents walk on a street during a general blackout in Havana, Cuba, Friday, March 14, 2025. Ramon Espinosa / AP\n\nEarlier, the Electric Union, the state agency that regulates the sector, said in its daily report that peak-hour demand would be around 3,250 megawatts and the deficit would reach around 1,380 megawatts, meaning 42% of the national energy system would be shut down. This figure is not the highest in recent memory.\n\nCuba suffered widespread outages in its national energy system at the end of last year, leaving the island in the dark amid a serious economic crisis.\n\nThe 2024 blackout was considered to be Cuba's worst in two years after Hurricane Ian made landfall as a Category 3 storm in 2022 and damaged power installations.\n\nCuba's power grid has been plagued by frequent outages, with more than half of the country experiencing power cuts during peak hours. The outages are primarily caused by fuel shortages and aging infrastructure. In many parts of the island, electricity is crucial for cooking and water pumping.\n\nAuthorities on the island have begun a program to install photovoltaic parks and promised that dozens of them will be ready this year. Blackouts previously prompted anti-government demonstrations in 2021, 2022, and 2024.",

Thomas, director of human resources for the U.S. Agency of Global Affairs Media, which oversees the VOA and several other state-funded news agencies, such as Radio Free Asia.\n\nThe notice was sent to all \"full-time VOA employees,\" including reporters and \"all the way up to senior managers,\" but not to contractual employees, whose contacts expire in June, a source with VOA told CBS News in a phone interview.\n\nHowever, a second source later told CBS News that VOA personal services contractors, who are also full-time, had received the same administrative email as federal employees. As of Saturday, all employees could not access VOA headquarters in Washington, D.C.\n\nAll VOA freelancers and stringers worldwide, and those with monthly contracts or assignments, have to stop working because there is now no way to pay them, the source added.\n\nSome VOA employees were walking to their studios when they received the notice and were told \"No, go home.\"\n\nThe move comes after President Trump signed an executive order late Friday that seeks to make sweeping cuts at USAGM and several other agencies, including the U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness, the Institute of Museum and Library Services and the Minority Business Development Agency.\n\n\"Such entities shall reduce the performance of their statutory functions and associated personnel to the minimum presence and function required by law,\" the order states.\n\n\"I am deeply saddened that for the first time in 83 years, the storied Voice of America is being silenced,\" Michael Abramowitz, director of Voice of America, said in a statement provided to CBS News Saturday. \"I learned this morning that virtually the entire staff of Voice of America—more than 1,300 journalists, producers and support staff—has been placed on administrative leave today. So have I.\"\n\nAbramowitz acknowledged that the agency needs \"thoughtful reform, and we have made progress in that regard. But today's action will leave Voice of America unable to carry out its vital mission. That mission is especially critical today, when America's adversaries, like Iran, China, and Russia, are sinking billions of dollars into creating false narratives to discredit the United States.\"\n\nVOA first began broadcasting in 1942 and reaches an audience of 361 million worldwide in 49 languages and some regions that are \" deeply underrepresented.\" Prior to Saturday's action, it had a total of about 2,000 employees and an annual budget of approximately $260 million.\n\n\"The American people deserve to know,\" one VOA journalist who received Saturday's notice told CBS News, adding that this is another example of the U.S. \"losing soft power\" to Russia and China.\n\nAnother VOA journalist, who wished to remain anonymous, told CBS News: \"I always keep the best U.S. interests in mind when explaining official policies and why democracy is the best political system to foreign audiences who do not understand English.\"\n\nIn December, President Trump announced that Republican Kari Lake, a news anchor who ran failed campaigns for governor and senate in Arizona, was his pick to serve as director of Voice of America.\n\n\"I'm sure they're doing some great stuff already. I've been looking a little bit here and there,\" Lake said in a December interview with CBS News. \"I'm not there to make it Trump TV and MAGA TV. That's not what this is about. That's not what Voice of America is.\"\n\nHowever, earlier this month, Lake was sworn-in as a special adviser to USAGM. It's unclear what her position would be if USAGM were dissolved.\n\nEmails obtained by CBS News were also sent to the president of Radio Free Asia, Bay Fang, and the chief financial officer of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, Joseph Lataille, from Lake, notifying them that federal grants for both broadcasters have been terminated.",

        "content": "Sara Adair knows the symptoms of aortic dissections. The hospital analyst's father and sister each experienced the dangerous cardiac condition, when the inner lining of the body's main artery tears and causes the aorta to come apart.\n\nAortic dissections can be deadly, and are hard to diagnose. Both Adair's father and sister survived, but after her sister's aortic dissection at the age of 49, Adair was determined to learn why it had happened. She, her father and her sister were diagnosed with Loeys-Dietz syndrome, a rare genetic disorder that affects the body's connective tissues.\n\nAdair, a mother of two, learned the symptoms, saw a cardiologist and had regular scans of her aorta. There were no warning signs. On July 22, 2024, she spent the afternoon attending sports tournaments and a pool party with her kids. It was just another day in a \"super busy weekend,\" she told CBS News, and she felt \"completely normal.\" When they finally got home at 9 p.m., she sat down to unwind.\n\n\"All of a sudden my chest started to hurt. It felt fine all day, completely normal, then just all of a sudden this crushing, horrible, chest pain I'd never felt before,\" Adair said. \"It was long enough for me to think 'Oh, is this really what I think it is?'\"\n\nSudden chest or back pain that moves into the neck is a key symptom of aortic dissection. It was exactly what had happened to Adair's sister. It was a feeling she had been dreading.\n\n\"The pain moved up to to my neck, and then I was like, 'Okay, this is it. This is serious,'\" she said. \"I got up to tell my husband to call 911, but I made it into the living room where he was and just collapsed on the floor.\"\n\nSara Adair and her family. Sara Adair\n\nWhat is Loeys-Dietz syndrome?\n\nLoeys-Dietz syndrome is a rare genetic condition that affects the body's connective tissues. Aortic aneurysms and dissections are a common risk for a person diagnosed with the disorder, said Dr. Hiroo Takayama, the chief of adult cardiac surgery at NewYork-Presbyterian/Columbia University Irving Medical Center.\n\nManaging the condition includes regular cardiology appointments and scans of the heart and aorta. Some patients may be prescribed heart medication, Takayama said, and patients can also receive a surgical treatment called aortic root replacement to prevent tears in the aorta.\n\nAlmost all Loeys-Dietz patients will need surgery on their aorta: It's just a question of if it will be a scheduled preventative procedure or an emergency one, Takayama said.\n\nAdair had been having regular check-ups, but the tests hadn't showed anything worrisome.\n\n\"I'd gotten all the imaging that I was supposed to, but it just wasn't detectable until it burst,\" Adair told CBS News.\n\nMaking a rapid diagnosis when \"time is also ticking\"\n\nEven though Adair knew what was happening to her, she struggled to communicate it to first responders. Her husband insisted that she be taken to the emergency room at Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital, where she worked. Paramedics conducted a diagnostic test that indicated she was having a \"huge heart attack,\" according to Dr. Partho P. Sengupta, the hospital chief of cardiology who oversaw Adair's care team.\n\nDespite similar symptoms, the treatment for a heart attack is very different than what a person having an aortic dissection will need, and that's part of what makes aortic dissections so deadly, Sengupta explained.\n\n\"Over 50% of people (with aortic dissections) never make it to the hospital. Of those who make it to the hospital, their time is also ticking, because with every one-hour you delay getting the right surgery, you have a 1 to 2% increase in mortality,\" Sengupta said.\n\nDr. Partho P. Sengupta indicates the aorta on a scan. Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital\n\nIn the emergency room, a cardiology fellow was able to make the correct diagnosis. Dr. Shawn Chawla, who trained under Sengupta, used a point-of-care ultrasound to examine Adair. The device is a probe that plugs into an iPhone, turning the device into a portable ultrasound system. The scan showed the large tear in Adair's aorta, Sengupta said. Adair was sent for a CT scan to confirm the diagnosis, then underwent open-heart surgery performed by cardiac surgeon Dr. Hirohisa Ikegami.\n\n\"I know it was the ultrasound that I had in the emergency room that saved me,\" Adair said. \"If I had been treated for a heart attack and brought, say, to the cardiac cath lab, or if I didn't go to the CT scan and get the diagnostic tests that I needed, I could have bled out.\"\n\nRecovering after open-heart surgery\n\nAdair had collapsed on a Sunday night, and she didn't wake up until Tuesday. She said she barely remembered anything that happened after she fell down.\n\nThe operation hadn't been without complications. She had had a stroke during surgery, which left her with some weakness in her left arm and slightly blurry vision. Fluid collected around her lungs and heart, creating breathing difficulties. She spent several days in the ICU.\n\nSara Adair in the ICU. Sara Adair\n\nEven after being released from the hospital, all Adair could think about was the night she collapsed and the terror she felt \"knowing exactly what was happening, feeling it going up my neck, and knowing I had a really, really limited amount of time to get the right treatment.\"\n\nShe has spent months in cardiac rehabilitation and has several blood clots that still need to resolve. Despite the setbacks, she considers herself lucky.\n\n\"I think the worst already happened,\" she said.\n\nThe only thing she fears now is what genetic testing for her children and her nieces will show. The kids have appointments scheduled to be tested for Loeys-Dietz syndrome. If necessary, they will start seeing a cardiologist who can monitor their health.",

        "content": "Jury awards LA man $50 million in case against Starbucks due to lifelong injuries from spilled tea Jury awards LA man $50 million in case against Starbucks due to lifelong injuries from spilled tea 03:01\n\nA Los Angeles man was awarded $50 million from a jury Friday in his case against Starbucks after he suffered life-altering burns when a cup of scalding hot tea spilled into his lap in 2020.\n\nIt happened at an Exposition Park drive-thru window, where Postmates driver Michael Garcia was awaiting a delivery on Feb. 8, 2020. When the barista handed him a tray full of drinks, at least one overturned. His noticeable reaction can be seen in security camera footage from inside the location at 1789 West Jefferson Boulevard.\n\nCourt records show Garcia had ordered three venti-sized \"medicine ball\" hot teas and was picking them up at the drive-thru when the lawsuit alleges the barista \"negligently\" failed to properly secure one of the drinks into the to-go carrier. The lawsuit says the unsecured cup fell directly into Garcia's lap within 1.4 seconds of him taking possession of the tray, with the lid popping off and hot tea leaving him with third-degree burns.\n\nA man is seen reacting after a Starbucks barista handed him a drink carrier which his lawyers said had an unsecured drink that fell into his lap on Feb. 8, 2020 in Los Angeles. Scalding hot tea left him with third-degree burns and permanent injuries. TRIAL LAWYERS FOR JUSTICE\n\n\"Starbucks says if our hands are off the drink, then no matter what happens, we're not responsible,\" said Garcia's trial attorney Nicholas Rowley. \"So, if I'm Starbucks and I hand you a drink that doesn't have a lid that's secured, and it's a scalding hot, 180-degree drink, or if I hand you a drink that's in a container and it's loose and it's not secured, and it falls right on you — the moment that I take my hands off of it, then you're responsible and I, the corporation, am not.\"\n\nThe spill left Garcia with life-changing injuries including third-degree burns, nerve damage and permanent injury to his genitals. Lawyers say that he's already had multiple surgeries and that he still experiences pain every day. On top of this, they say that he suffers from severe PTSD.\n\n\"Michael Garcia's life has been forever changed,\" Rowley said in a statement after the verdict. \"No amount of money can undo the permanent catastrophic harm he has suffered, but this jury verdict is a critical step in holding Starbucks accountable for flagrant disregard for customer safety and failure to accept responsibility.\"\n\nJurors deliberated for just about 40 minutes on Friday before siding with Garcia, awarding him $50 million in damages from the world famous coffee chain.\n\n\"It's a reasonable verdict. It's justified. This injury changed Michael's life — it was gross negligence,\" Rowley said.\n\nIn response to the verdict, a Starbucks spokesperson shared a statement with CBS News Los Angeles.\n\n\"We sympathize with Mr. Garcia, but we disagree with the jury's decision that we were at fault for this incident and believe the damages awarded to be excessive,\" the statement said. \"We plan to appeal. We have always been committed to the highest safety standards in our stores, including the handling of hot drinks.\"\n\nRowley said no amount of money could make right what happened to Garcia.\n\nHe began receiving treatment at the Grossman Burn Center in LA on Valentine's Day, six days after the incident. He underwent skin grafts that his lawyers say left him with some permanent loss feeling, and evidence presented during the trial showed the life-long implications of some of his injuries.\n\nStarbucks had initially offered $3 million to Garcia pre-trial, later upping that amount to $30 million to settle. Garcia agreed, but under the condition that they apologize, change their policies and issue a memo to all store locations to double-check their hot drinks before handing them to customers, attorneys said.\n\nWhen they declined to agree to those terms, the jury eventually decided to award Garcia with Friday's total.\n\nIt's not the first time the coffee giant has faced legal action over spilt drinks at the drive-thru. In 2018, a 22-year-old Northern California man spent 11 days in the burn unit at UC Davis Medical Center and was left with life-changing injuries after hot tea spilled into his lap while he was picking up an order at a drive-thru.\n\nA year earlier, a woman in Denver sued Starbucks over a drive-thru spill that severely injured her and left her dog dead.",

Please honor the chick for its courage in getting as far as it did and doing whatever it came to do.\"\n\nJackie, the 11 year old female, and Shadow, the 13 year old male, have drawn the attention of wildlife enthusiasts across the United States for years due to the unique chance to watch their day-to-day happenings online.

Promotions are subject to availability and retailer terms.\n\nHomeowners have an opportunity to use their home equity strategically (and potentially see big returns) this spring. Getty Images\n\nThe spring season is typically a time of renewal, and, fittingly, homeowners across the country are realizing that tapping into their home equity — which the average homeowner has about $313,000 worth of right now — gives them the chance to take advantage of new financial opportunities.\n\nThere are a few ways homeowners typically tap into their home's equity, including home equity lines of credit (HELOCs), home equity loans and cash-out refinances. If one of those funding sources is already in the works for you, though, and you're in the process of determining how you'll spend the money, there are a few smart ways experts say you can use those funds this spring.\n\nFind out what your home equity borrowing options are here.\n\n3 smart ways to use your home equity this spring, according to experts\n\nHere's what experts say you may want to consider using your home equity for this spring:\n\nBuy an investment property\n\nThe average homeowner currently has enough equity in their homes to make a substantial down payment on an investment property — or buy one outright. That's a move that Sasha Travassos, a mortgage broker with Zyng Mortgage, sees a lot of homeowners making right now.\n\n\"[Homeowners] will pull equity out of their home and buy a cheaper property in a less expensive area or region and either use it as a second home,\" Travassos says.\n\nAccording to Travassos, one of her clients is buying a second home and is may tap their home equity to do it. When they're staying at one house, they'll rent out the other house on a short-term basis. Because the rental contracts are short-term — between six and 12 weeks, for example — the homeowner can easily plan ahead and rotate between homes to earn rental income.\n\n\"You just want to make sure that not only is the mortgage, property tax, insurance and HOA fees are covered by that rental income, but you also want to have a little bit left over for maintenance and, potentially, profit,\" Travassos says. \"The idea is that you're using that equity to create income, and, obviously, getting new equity in the home you're purchasing for long-term asset growth.\"\n\nSee what your home equity borrowing rates could be here.\n\nUpgrade your roof and windows\n\nNatural disasters such as fires, flooding, hurricanes and tornados are driving up home insurance rates in many states. With summer fast approaching — and the severe storms that come with it — this spring is a good time to update your roof and windows.\n\nWhile these updates are not as popular as, say, a kitchen remodel or room renovation, replacing your roof and windows could have a significant impact on your home insurance premium, says Tara McCafferty, a producing branch manager at American Pacific Mortgage, a mortgage banker and broker.\n\nDoing a wind mitigation inspection on your home — which is an inspection that looks at your roof, windows and the other parts of your home that could be damaged by storm winds — can drop your premiums substantially if the results of the inspection are positive, McCafferty says.\n\n\"Without that report or the insurance company knowing those things are solid, we've seen premiums come back at, for example, $4,500 a year,\" McCafferty says. \"But if they have the report and the report is good, the premium could be $2,000 or $1,900 a year.\"\n\nA new roof is also a great selling point if you're looking to sell your home and buy elsewhere this spring, McCafferty says, as many first-time homebuyers are looking for a home with a new roof or windows.\n\n\"They don't have the extra capital to put on a new roof at closing or within a year,\" McCafferty says. \"A lot of times they look for [a new roof and new windows] when purchasing a home. With these things, your home becomes more enticing for a buyer.\"\n\nAcquire a business\n\nIf you've got expertise in a certain trade or industry, using your home equity to purchase a business in that field could be a smart decision right now, says Travassos, who works with residential homeowners and businesses.\n\nA \"silver tsunami\" of baby boomers selling their businesses is churning along right now, according to Travassos — and the influx of business acquisition opportunities could offer an income-producing way to leverage your home equity.\n\n\"Yes, you can put money into renovations, but sometimes you don't get the bang for your buck, whereas you could use the equity from your home for a business acquisition, buying a plumbing business or electrical installation business; something in your area of knowledge,\" Travassos says.\n\nThe bottom line\n\nThe beauty of home equity is that you can use HELOCs, home equity loans and cash-out refinances to borrow for nearly any number of reasons. While improving a kitchen or bathroom can be well worth the money and time, experts say using equity to fund projects that can lower your bills or increase your income is the smart choice this spring. As you decide how you'll use the equity you've built up in your home, though remember that your home is used as collateral with this type of borrowing, so it's important to ensure that the payments will fit your budget to avoid putting your home at risk.",

The U.N. Human Rights Council's report also claims Israel's troops have committed \"genocidal acts\" in the war against Hamas, which was sparked by the U.S. and Israeli designated terrorist group's Oct. 7, 2023 attack on Israel.\n\nIn making the latter claim, the council cited what it called the \"systematic destruction of sexual and reproductive healthcare facilities\" including maternity wards and Gaza's primary in-vitro fertility clinic.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, in a statement shared by his office, quickly and angrily refuted the report and attacked the council as an \"anti-Semitic, rotten, terrorist-supporting and irrelevant body.\"\n\nIsraeli soldiers are seen in the city of Tulkarem, in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, during a raid, Feb. 6, 2025. WAHAJ BANI MOUFLEH/Middle East Images/AFP/Getty\n\n\"The U.N. is once again choosing to attack the State of Israel with false accusations, including unfounded accusations of sexual violence,\" the statement said.\n\n\"It is one of the worst cases of blood libel the world has ever seen (and the world has seen many),\" said Israel's Foreign Minister Oren Marmorstein in a post on social media. \"It accuses the victims of the crimes committed against them.\"\n\nThe explosive report was published just over a year after a U.N. expert on sexual violence published a paper accusing Hamas of similar actions, saying there were \"reasonable grounds to believe\" sexual violence, including rape and gang rape, had occurred at several locations during the Hamas-orchestrated Oct. 7 terrorist attack.\n\nThat previous report, by the U.N. special envoy on sexual violence Pramila Patten, said there was also reason to believe sexual abuse of Israeli hostages still held in Gaza was \"ongoing.\"\n\nU.N. experts interviewed dozens of witnesses and reviewed thousands of photos and 50 hours of video shot during the terrorist attack, but Patten said the team had been unable to meet with any survivors of sexual violence.\n\nHamas rejected the allegations.\n\nNavi Pillay, who chairs the U.N. inquiry commission behind the report published Thursday, said it had gathered evidence that \"reveals a deplorable increase in sexual and gender-based violence\" by Israeli forces.\n\n\"There is no escape from the conclusion that Israel has employed sexual and gender-based violence against Palestinians to terrorize them and perpetuate a system of oppression that undermines their right to self-determination,\" Pillay said.\n\nThe report documents a broad range of accusations against Israel's security forces, alleging crimes against Palestinian women and girls, but also men and boys in the Gaza Strip and the Israeli-occupied West Bank.\n\nThe U.N. commission cites incidents of alleged forced public stripping and nudity, sexual harassment, rape and threats of rape and violence to the genitals, which it claims have become \"standard operating procedures toward Palestinians\" and are \"committed either under explicit orders or with implicit encouragement by Israel's top civilian and military leadership.\"\n\nThe commission's findings were published after two days of public hearings in Geneva that included testimony from purported victims, witnesses, medical staff, academics and lawyers.",

        "content": "We may receive commissions from some links to products on this page. Promotions are subject to availability and retailer terms.\n\nCDs give you guaranteed returns but early withdrawal penalties could cut into your earnings. Getty Images/iStockphoto\n\nThere's a lot to like about certificate of deposit (CD) accounts now. Rates remain high, returns are guaranteed and they're easy to use. Earning more than $1,000 from a CD is as simple as depositing $20,000 into an 18-month CD at today's rates and withdrawing your money at maturity.\n\nAs simple and profitable as CDs are, they come with one caveat: Many CDs charge early withdrawal penalties. If you withdraw money from your account before it matures, the issuer typically charges you a penalty that's equal to a certain number of months of interest, negating much of the reason why you opened the account to start with.\n\nBanks and credit unions set up CDs this way to lower the risk they assume by giving you a return on the money you deposit, says Sarah Wicker, manager of deposit account and IRA services for Georgia's Own Credit Union.\n\n\"We're able to offer a higher interest rate on CD accounts rather than savings and checking accounts because we lock up the money,\" Wicker says. \"When you open up a CD, you basically enter an agreement with us that you'll keep the money in that account for [a certain] amount of time.\"\n\nEarly withdrawal rules apply to most CDs you open, no matter which bank or credit union offers the account. You may be wondering, then, if there's ever a chance that your bank might waive your early withdrawal penalty. In some cases, it may. Below, we'll break down what to consider.\n\nSee how much you could earn from a top CD here.\n\nWill my bank waive my CD early withdrawal penalty?\n\nA CD issuer may waive early withdrawal penalties in specific situations. Here's when it could happen:\n\nIf the account holder asks the bank\n\nIn certain instances, as when a financial hardship arises immediately after the CD is opened, some banks may be willing to forego the early withdrawal penalty. So it's worth asking the bank for a one-time waiving of the penalty. That said, these instances are rare, and the longer you keep your money in the account, the less likely you are to have the penalty waived. Still, it's worth asking as some banks may be more lenient in their approach than others, particularly if you can demonstrate credible financial hardship.\n\nExplore your top CD account options now.\n\nA court declares the account holder incompetent\n\nYour CD issuer is likely to waive your early withdrawal penalty if you've been \"determined legally incompetent by the court,\" Wicker says. Wicker points out that these are the kinds of situations that may result in a conservatorship, where the court appoints a person to manage your financial accounts if you can't do it yourself. In these situations, the person overseeing your account may withdraw the money or convert your CD into a special account they manage without penalty, Wicker says.\n\nThe account holder dies\n\nBanks and credit unions typically waive any early withdrawal penalties if the account holder dies. This allows the person(s) inheriting your CD or the executor of your estate to withdraw some or all of the money in the CD without penalty.\n\nDepending on your bank issuer, you may be able to designate your CD as a \"payable on death\" (POD) account. In the event of death, the POD designation would allow the bank to pay out the CD's funds to the listed POD beneficiary or beneficiaries without penalty, in most cases. Read over the terms of your CD contract to verify the rules for CD withdrawals in this scenario and contact your issuer if you have any questions.\n\nWhat about no-penalty CDs?\n\nCDs tend to be pretty restrictive about waiving early withdrawal penalties.\n\nYou can get around those restrictive rules, though, with no-penalty CDs. These CDs work just like they sound — you can withdraw money from the account without paying a penalty. No-penalty CDs are an excellent solution if you want to earn the guaranteed, fixed-rate returns CDs provide and have access to your deposit.\n\nHowever, there's a trade-off for that liquidity. Most issuers offer lower rates for their no-penalty CDs than their traditional CDs. In some cases, though, the approximate 0.50% difference between a no-penalty's annual percentage yield (APY) and traditional CD may be worthwhile if it means maintaining access to your funds.\n\nThe bottom line\n\nCDs are an easy way to generate guaranteed returns on your money. Opening a CD may require a minimum deposit of as little as $100 or $500, making them accessible to many types of savers. Early withdrawal penalties are a CDs main drawback, but you have alternatives. No-penalty CDs allow you to withdraw money without a fee. High-yield savings accounts also offer competitive returns right now and don't have the same withdrawal restrictions that CDs do. Keep in mind, though, that those accounts have a variable rate that can move up or down from month to month, while CDs have a fixed rate.",

        "content": "Washington — President Trump on Thursday asked the Supreme Court to limit for now the scope of three lower court orders that broadly blocked enforcement of his executive order seeking to end birthright citizenship.\n\nThe Trump administration asked the high court for emergency relief in three separate requests, which arise out of cases brought in Maryland, Massachusetts and Washington state. In all three disputes, U.S. district court judges issued orders blocking nationwide enforcement of Mr. Trump's executive order, which was issued his first day in office.\n\nActing Solicitor General Sarah Harris is now asking the high court to limit the sweep of those orders to cover only those individuals who are directly involved in the cases.\n\n\"These cases — which involve challenges to the president's January 20, 2025 Executive Order concerning birthright citizenship — raise important constitutional questions with major ramifications for securing the border,\" she wrote in the requests. \"But at this stage, the government comes to this court with a 'modest' request: while the parties litigate weighty merits questions, the court should 'restrict the scope' of multiple preliminary injunctions that 'purpor[t] to cover every person in the country,' limiting those injunctions to parties actually within the courts' power.\"\n\nTrump's birthright citizenship order\n\nPresident Trump signs an executive order in the Oval Office at the White House in Washington, D.C., on Jan. 20, 2025. Jim Lo Scalzo/EPA/Bloomberg via Getty Images\n\nMr. Trump issued his executive order seeking to terminate birthright citizenship on his first day in office, part of a broad, long-promised crackdown on illegal immigration across the U.S.-Mexico border. The order denies U.S. citizenship to children born to mothers who are in the country unlawfully or temporarily on visas, and whose fathers are neither citizens nor lawful permanent residents.\n\nThe president's executive action sparked immediate legal challenges, including in the cases that have now arrived at the Supreme Court. The challengers all argue Mr. Trump's order violates the Citizenship Clause of the 14th Amendment.\n\nFour U.S. district judges — in Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire and Washington — issued orders blocking enforcement of the president's attempt to end birthright citizenship. Efforts by the Trump administration to have U.S. appeals courts restrict the scope of three of those decisions to apply only the parties — which include 22 states, members of two organizations and seven individuals — while legal proceedings move forward have not been successful.\n\nIn its request to the Supreme Court, the Trump administration said it should clear the way for the president's birthright citizenship order to partially take effect. Harris, who represents the federal government before the court, largely criticized the scope of the relief — which extends nationwide — and warned that these injunctions harm the executive branch's ability to carry out its functions.\n\n\"District courts have issued more universal injunctions and [temporary restraining orders] during February 2025 alone than through the first three years of the Biden administration,\" she wrote. \"That sharp rise in universal injunctions stops the executive branch from performing its constitutional functions before any courts fully examine the merits of those actions, and threatens to swamp this court's emergency docket.\"\n\nShe noted that the decisions arising out of challenges to Mr. Trump's birthright citizenship order cover all 50 states and \"millions of aliens across the country.\"\n\n\"This court should declare that enough is enough before district courts' burgeoning reliance on universal injunctions becomes further entrenched,\" the acting solicitor general wrote.\n\nOn the issue of immigration, specifically, Harris said the lower court orders impede the president's efforts to address what she said is a crisis at the southern border.\n\n\"The district courts' universal injunctions threaten to perpetuate those problems by holding out a nationwide incentive for illegal immigration: the prospect of American citizenship for the unlawful migrants' children and of derivative immigration benefits for the migrants themselves,\" she argued.\n\nRepublicans and Democrats alike have sought these nationwide orders when challenging the policies of a president from the opposing political party, and decisions granting that broad relief have been criticized by administrations on both sides of the political spectrum.\n\nEven several members of the Supreme Court have expressed concern about the soundness of these broad orders, which bar the government from enforcing the policy at issue against anyone, anywhere in the country. In a 2018 concurring opinion in a case involving Mr. Trump's travel ban issued during his first term, Justice Clarence Thomas noted that district courts in Hawaii and Maryland entered preliminary injunctions that barred the Trump administration from enforcing the policy, and said he was skeptical they have the authority to do so.\n\n\"If their popularity continues, this court must address their legality,\" he said.",

        "title": "Trump signs continuing resolution, averting shutdown, White House says",
        "source": "https://www.cbsnews.com/",
        "content": "Washington — President Donald Trump has signed a Republican-led stopgap measure to keep the government funded, White House Principal Deputy Press Secretary Harrison Fields said on social media on Saturday afternoon.\n\nThe signing comes after the Senate passed the bill in a 54 to 46 vote, with one Republican opposing it and two Democrats supporting it after 10 Democrats provided the votes earlier Friday to advance the measure through a key procedural hurdle. Senate Democrats spent days debating the uncomfortable choice of whether to allow the bill to pass or let the government shut down.\n\nThe vote came after Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer initially signaled that his caucus would fight back against the partisan measure to keep the government funded through September. But instead he reluctantly pledged on Thursday to advance it, delivering one of the Democratic votes necessary to propel it to passage. He warned of the larger threat a shutdown would pose for the American people.\n\n\"For sure, the Republican bill is a terrible option,\" the New York Democrat said, calling the bill \"deeply partisan\" and urging that \"it doesn't address far too many of this country's needs.\" \"But I believe allowing Donald Trump to take even much more power via a government shutdown is a far worse option.\"\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer leaves the Democratic caucus lunch at the U.S. Capitol on March 13, 2025 in Washington, DC. Kayla Bartkowski / Getty Images\n\nAfter his remarks Thursday night, Schumer wouldn't say whether other Democrats would join him in voting to advance the measure, telling reporters that \"each is making his or her own decision.\" But Schumer's support for the continuing resolution gave other Democrats political cover to do the same, diminishing the threat of a shutdown.\n\nUltimately, Schumer was joined in voting to advance the measure by Democratic Sens. Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada, Dick Durbin of Illinois, John Fetterman of Pennsylvania, Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, Maggie Hassan of New Hampshire, Gary Peters of Michigan, Brian Schatz of Hawaii, Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire, and Angus King, a Maine independent who caucuses with Democrats. Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky was the sole Republican to oppose advancing the measure and he voted against it on final passage. Shaheen and King voted in favor of final passage.\n\nOn Tuesday, the House passed the measure, which increases defense spending while decreasing non-defense spending below 2024 levels. Republicans have praised additional funding in the measure for programs like nutrition assistance for women, infants and children, while Democrats have railed against cuts to medical research and housing programs — and more than $1 billion in cuts to D.C.'s local government spending. The Senate also voted to reverse the cuts following the vote to keep the government funded, but the measure still must be taken up by the House.\n\nJust one House Democrat joined the Republican majority in support of the measure. And while the House requires only a simple majority, a 60-vote threshold is required to invoke cloture and advance most measures in the Senate, meaning the support of Democrats was needed to get the measure to ultimately pass.\n\nStill, the party had been split on how to proceed. Democrats widely oppose the House-passed measure and have expressed frustration with the spending reductions, and they warn that it would give the Trump administration and Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency even more latitude to carry out cost-slashing efforts.\n\nDemocrats had been pushing for a 30-day continuing resolution that had little chance of earning enough support for passage. And with the House having already left town, the option would almost certainly have resulted in a funding lapse. But some progressives suggested that the shorter option was more favorable, letting the onus for a government shutdown fall on Republicans, arguing that it would have further illuminated the chaos that has ensued in the federal bureaucracy and beyond under the Trump administration and DOGE.\n\nRep. Alexandria Ocasio Cortez told reporters Thursday night that Schumer's move to back the continuing resolution — known as a CR — was a \"huge slap in the face,\" adding that there is a \"wide sense of betrayal\" among the party.\n\n\"What voting for the CR does is that it codifies the chaos and the reckless cuts that Elon Musk has been pursuing,\" Ocasio-Cortez said. \"The robbing of our federal government in order to finance tax cuts for billionaires, is what is happening, and that is what Senate Democrats will be empowering if they vote for the CR.\"\n\nSchumer told reporters following his floor remarks that Democrats should keep the attention on their message — that Republicans are hurting the middle class — rather than on what the Trump administration could pursue during a shutdown. Schumer said the message is \"beginning to work.\"\n\nThe president congratulated Schumer Friday morning for \"doing the right thing,\" saying in a post on Truth Social that it took \"courage.\"\n\nThe minority leader first informed Senate Democrats that he planned to vote to advance the GOP funding measure during a closed-door meeting Thursday afternoon, a source familiar told CBS News. As the meeting let out, frustrations appeared high among Senate Democrats, and a number of them — including many who hail from battleground states — quickly released statements on social media announcing they would vote \"no\" on the House-passed continuing resolution.\n\nBesides Schumer, only Sen. John Fetterman, a Pennsylvania Democrat, had pledged to support the continuing resolution heading into the day on Friday. Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada became the third Democrat to pledge to support the measure to avert a shutdown ahead of the vote.\n\nDemocrats continued to rail against their options on Friday morning. Sen. Patty Murray, the top Democratic appropriator who had been engaged in bipartisan talks to fund the government, said the choice between a shutdown and letting the GOP bill pass \"has always been a false choice.\" She accused Republicans of pulling out of bipartisan negotiations and sending \"a deeply partisan bill here to the Senate today.\"\n\n\"Democrats did not have an ounce of input into writing this bill,\" Murray said. \"In my time in Congress, never, ever has one party written partisan full-year appropriations bills for all of government and expected the other party to go along without any input.\"\n\nMurray said the Senate could still pass the short-term funding measure that she introduced earlier this week, saying House Republicans could get on a plane to come back and vote.\n\nMeanwhile, House Democratic leaders returned to the Capitol Friday to express their opposition to the continuing resolution, calling this an \"unprecedented situation and an unprecedented disaster\" for the American people.\n\n\"We've been very clear: we strongly oppose the reckless Republican spending bill,\" House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries said.\n\ncontributed to this report.",

So, we would hope that in the fullness of time that these things will settle down and that there would be negotiation, trade negotiations, to arrive at a landing zone that people can cope with and can accommodate.\"\n\nMartin said that Mr. Trump was \"very conscious of the goods surplus that Ireland has, particularly through the pharmaceutical issue.\"\n\n\"But if you put services into the mix, of course Ireland is in deficit,\" he said.\n\nMartin described the U.S. and Ireland's economic relationship as a \"two-way street\" and touted his country's investment in the U.S., including over 700 Irish companies that he said were responsible for the creation of more than 200,000 jobs in the U.S. Martin also highlighted that Irish airline, Ryanair, had recently placed an order for over 400 Boeing aircraft.\n\nWhen added with another Irish company AerCap's purchase of 150 Boeing aircraft last year, Irish-owned companies were \"the largest purchaser of Boeing aircraft outside the United States,\" he said.\n\n\"In an absolute worst-case scenario, say, a 25% increase across the board on tariffs, a tit-for-tat from both sides — a Boeing 787, the price will go up by $40 million,\" AerCap's CEO Aengus Kelly said Wednesday on CNBC. \"No one's going to want to pay that.\"\n\nKelly said European companies would likely buy aircraft manufactured by Airbus, which is a European company, if Mr. Trump's tariffs are applied.\n\nAsked about his meetings with the president Wednesday at the White House, Martin described them as \"positive meetings\" that celebrated the \"historic ties between the two countries.\" He called Mr. Trump a \"gracious host\" who has an \"affection for Ireland.\"\n\n\"He likes Ireland.

Promotions are subject to availability and retailer terms.\n\nA $100,000 home equity loan offers borrowers one of the cheaper ways to borrow a six-figure sum of money right now. Getty Images\n\nBorrowing money is always fraught with concerns and questions but especially when considering a large, six-figure sum. If turning to a credit card company or personal loan lender, the application process may be stressful in and of itself. Since neither option requires collateral, the eligibility criteria for borrowing $100,000, for example, can be extended and time-consuming, leading borrowers to inevitably consider alternatives.\n\nBut what about home equity loans now? In today's unique economic climate, home equity levels are high, with the average homeowner in possession of $313,000 worth of home equity, up 6% year over year. A $100,000 withdrawal would still leave a substantial amount of equity in the home for future usage. Still, using your home equity as a funding source comes with inherent risks that will need to be strategically managed, especially in today's evolving economic climate.\n\nBut is a $100,000 home equity loan a good idea now? Or should borrowers consider their other options? Below, we'll break down what to consider.\n\nStart by seeing how much home equity you'd be eligible to borrow here.\n\nIs a $100,000 home equity loan a good idea now?\n\nWhile the decision to borrow such a large sum of money from your most prized financial asset needs to be considered carefully, it can be a smart way to gain access to $100,000 now. Here's why:\n\nInterest rates are fixed: Borrowing $100,000 will need to come with a precise plan for repaying $100,000. Fortunately, that's easy to do with home equity loans … and not so easy to do with home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) or credit cards. That's because the latter two types have variable rates subject to change based on market conditions. But that home equity loan rate will remain fixed until refinanced, allowing borrowers to determine exactly what their repayments will be, their affordability and the pay-off date, all features that variable rate products struggle to provide with clarity.\n\nSee what fixed home equity loan rate you'd qualify for now.\n\nInterest rates are low: The average home equity loan interest rate is just 8.37% now. That makes it significantly less expensive than personal loans (at 12.37%) and almost three times less costly than credit cards (near a record 23%). If you're going to borrow a six-figure sum of money, after all, you'll want to keep your repayment costs minimal. Fortunately, a home equity loan, which has seen average rates decline for more than a year, can provide that option if applied for now.\n\nEligibility may be simpler: As mentioned above, the application process for a $100,000 personal loan or $100,000 credit card limit can be arduous, time-consuming and stressful — and borrowers may still get rejected once the application is completed. But the process for securing a home equity loan in this amount can generally be simpler, depending on the borrowing profile of the homeowner. Because lenders know the home is being offered as collateral, and because lenders can easily see a history of mortgage repayments on the property, they can more easily determine eligibility, ultimately resulting in quicker disbursements of funds compared to some popular alternatives.\n\nThe bottom line\n\nA $100,000 loan, no matter the funding source, should be approached with caution and nuance. But if you're looking for a fixed rate to accurately determine repayments, a low rate that can help make those repayments more manageable and an application process that can more easily get your funds delivered on time, a $100,000 home equity loan may be the right choice for you now. Just be sure to do all of the calculations in advance and have all of your questions answered by a lending professional before getting started. Failure to repay any home equity loan, no matter the amount, can result in the lender taking back your home. So you'll want to be completely prepared to make your payments before signing any paperwork.",

        "content": "Before depositing $10,000 into a long-term CD now, savers should first calculate their potential earnings. Getty Images/iStockphoto\n\nNews this week that inflation dropped slightly in February may have been welcome news for borrowers but less so for savers. Borrowers, after all, have been contending with higher interest rates on a variety of products for much of the last two and a half years, making everything from mortgages to personal loans and credit cards more expensive. Savers, however, were able to take advantage of those higher rates via greater returns on interest-earning vehicles like high-yield savings and certificates of deposit (CD) accounts. Should that inflation rate continue to decline, then, the Federal Reserve may be motivated to resume it's interest-rate cut campaign, reducing what savers can earn on their money.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, some savers may be contemplating the benefits of locking a portion of their money away into a long-term CD (which has a term length longer than 12 months). With rates on long-term CDs over 4% still and the extended interest earning potential likely to result in hundreds and possibly thousands of dollars in returns, this could be a smart place to park an amount of money like $10,000 right now. That said, before acting it helps to know what a $10,000 long-term CD can realistically earn if opened now, in the developing interest rate climate of March 2025. Below, we'll do the math.\n\nSee how much more you could be earning with a top CD online today.\n\nHow much will a $10,000 long-term CD earn if opened this March?\n\nDespite some cooling in the interest rate climate over the last six months, savers can still earn a substantial rate with a long-term CD. Here's what a $10,000 long-term CD can earn now, tied to readily available interest rates and terms (assuming no early withdrawal penalties or maintenance fees):\n\n18-month CD at 4.16%: $630.45 for a total of $10,630.45 upon maturity\n\n$630.45 for a total of $10,630.45 upon maturity 2-year CD at 4.15%: $847.22 for a total of $10,847.22 upon maturity\n\n$847.22 for a total of $10,847.22 upon maturity 3-year CD at 4.15%: $1,297.38 for a total of $11,297.38 upon maturity\n\n$1,297.38 for a total of $11,297.38 upon maturity 5-year CD at 4.25%: $2,313.47 for a total of $12,313.47 upon maturity\n\n$2,313.47 for a total of $12,313.47 upon maturity 10-year CD at 3.40%: $3,970.29 for a total of $13,970.29 upon maturity\n\nSo, savers can easily earn $630 or more simply by moving $10,000 into a long-term CD now.\n\nNot only will that return be high, but it will also protect those funds from market conditions and a declining variable interest rate it would otherwise be subject to by remaining in a traditional savings account (with average rates around 0.40%) now. Still, it's critical that savers only open these accounts with the ability to keep the money deposited untouched for the full CD term as an early withdrawal penalty, particularly on a long-term CD, can be costly and end up wiping out all (or most) of the interest earned to date. Be careful, then, to get started with the right initial deposit.\n\nGet started with a top long-term CD here today.\n\nThe bottom line\n\nA long-term CD offers savers big returns in exchange for leaving their money in an account for an extended period of time. But it's not the only CD type to consider now. Rates are higher on short-term CDs, but the returns will be lower thanks to an earlier maturity date. Regardless of which CD term you ultimately choose, however, be sure to calculate your potential earnings (and understand your comfort level parting with the funds) before getting started. And consider looking to online banks that tend to offer higher rates and better terms for savers, which will be critical when giving up access to your money for 18 months or longer.",

Mississippi Gov. Tate Reeves said on social media Saturday that tornadoes had been reported in six counties overnight.\n\nExtreme weather conditions — including hurricane-force winds — are forecast to affect an area home to more than 100 million people. Winds gusting up to 80 mph were predicted from the Canadian border to Texas, threatening blizzard conditions in colder northern areas and wildfire risk in warmer, drier areas to the south. The most serious tornado threats were to eastern Louisiana and Mississippi, Alabama, and the western parts of the Florida Panhandle and Georgia, the NWS said.\n\nTim Scott, right, gets a hug from friend Jorden Harris outside Scott's home he was inside when it was destroyed during a severe storm the evening before Saturday, March 15, 2025, in Wayne County, Mo. Jeff Roberson / AP\n\nAt least 12 fatalities have been reported in Missouri, according to the Missouri State Emergency Management Agency. The deaths came as a massive storm system moving across the country unleashed winds that damaged buildings, whipped up deadly dust storms and fanned more than 100 wildfires.\n\nMissouri Gov. Mike Kehoe said that first responders, volunteers and faith-based partners \"worked tirelessly\" through the night \"in response to a series of devastating tornadoes and severe storms, and before that, dangerous and damaging fires.\"\n\nIn Oklahoma, the governor said one person died on the road, presumably due to smoke.\n\nIn Arkansas, officials reported three fatalities in Independence County, and 29 people were reported injured in eight counties in connection to a storm system that moved through the state overnight. Staff from the Arkansas Division of Emergency Management (ADEM) have been called to the State Emergency Operations Center (SEOC) due to extensive storm damage across the state.\n\nArkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Saturday that she spoke with President Trump after Friday night's tornados in the state.\n\n\"[Trump] said to tell the people of Arkansas he loves them and he and his administration are here to help with whatever we need following last night's tornadoes,\" she said in a post on X.\n\nIn Kansas, at least eight people died and numerous injuries were reported Friday after more than 55 vehicles were involved in a crash due to a dust storm.\n\nFurther south in Texas, officials said four people died after weather-related fatalities, some during car crashes in the midst of a dust storm.\n\n\"It's the worst I've ever seen,\" said Sgt. Cindy Barkley of the state's department of public safety, calling the near-zero visibility a nightmare. \"We couldn't tell that they were all together until the dust kind of settled.\"\n\nThis photo provided by the Oklahoma Highway Patrol shows a tractor-trailer overturned on highway US 183 just south of Hobart, Oklahoma on Thursday, March 13, 2025.

The State Patrol said winds were so strong that they toppled several tractor-trailers.\n\n\"This is terrible out here,\" said Charles Daniel, a truck driver hauling a 48-foot trailer along Interstate 40 in western Oklahoma. \"There's a lot of sand and dirt in the air. I'm not pushing it over 55 mph. I'm scared it will blow over if I do.\"\n\nForecasters said the severe storm threat would continue into the weekend with a high chance of tornadoes and damaging winds Saturday in Mississippi and Alabama. Heavy rain could bring flash flooding to some parts of the East Coast on Sunday.\n\nExperts say it's not unusual to see such weather extremes in March.\n\n\"What's unique about this one is its large size and intensity,\" said Bill Bunting of the National Weather Service's Storm Prediction Center in Norman, Oklahoma. \"And so what that is doing is producing really substantial impacts over a very large area.\"\n\nThe threat of tornadoes moved east into the Mississippi Valley and Deep South on Saturday, a day after a massive storm system moving across the country killed at least six, unleashed winds that damaged buildings, whipped up dust storms that caused deadly crashes and fanned more than 100 wildfires in several central states.\n\nMagenta marks areas at highest risk\n\nThe Storm Prediction Center uses five categories to warn of expected severe weather, ranging from marginal to high. Its forecast maps are color-coded, with the lowest risk areas in green and the highest shown in magenta.\n\nOn Saturday, the area of highest risk includes parts of Mississippi and Alabama.\n\nThe \"high risk\" designation is used when severe weather is expected to include \"numerous intense and long-tracked tornadoes\" or thunderstorms producing hurricane-force wind gusts and inflicting widespread damage, according to the agency's product descriptions.\n\nOn many days when the \"high risk\" designation was used in recent years, the forecasts became reality.\n\nCrews work to remove a large pine tree from Glencannon Drive after severe weather hit in Pico Rivera, Calif., Thursday, March 13, 2025.

Several buildings were damaged in the storm, including a strip mall in Rolla, Missouri, where a tornado was reported Friday afternoon.\n\nThe Storm Prediction Center said fast-moving storms could spawn twisters and hail as large as baseballs, but the greatest threat would come from straight-line winds near or exceeding hurricane force, with gusts of 100 mph (160 kph) possible.\n\n\"Potentially violent\" tornadoes were expected Saturday in parts of the central Gulf Coast and Deep South into the Tennessee Valley, according to the National Weather Service.\n\nThe Storm Prediction Center said parts of Mississippi, including Jackson and Hattiesburg and areas of Alabama, including Birmingham and Tuscaloosa would be at a high risk. Severe storms and tornadoes were also possible across eastern Louisiana, western Georgia, central Tennessee and the western Florida Panhandle.\n\nOn Saturday, Gov. Brian Kemp declared a state of emergency in Georgia due to damaging weather expected to move into the state overnight. It is scheduled to expire on Tuesday.\n\n\"This storm will hit at the worst possible time, as people are heading to or already in bed.

Alonzo Adams / AP\n\nWildfires break out amid dry, gusty conditions\n\nWildfires in the Southern Plains threatened to spread rapidly amid warm, dry weather and strong winds, and evacuations were ordered Friday for some communities in Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, Missouri and New Mexico.\n\nA blaze in Roberts County, Texas, northeast of Amarillo, quickly blew up from less than a square mile to an estimated 32.8 square miles, the Texas A&M University Forest Service said on X. Crews stopped its advance by Friday evening. About 60 miles to the south, another fire grew to about 3.9 square miles before its advance was halted in the afternoon.\n\nIn Oklahoma, the National Weather Service said a \"complex of extremely dangerous fires\" was located northeast of Oklahoma City, near Stillwater, and urged some people in the city of about 50,000 to evacuate on Friday evening. Officials issued mandatory evacuation orders via social media that included homes, hotels and a Walmart.\n\nFirefighters extinguish hotspots at a home which was destroyed by yesterday's wildfire on March 15, 2025 in Mannford, Oklahoma. Scott Olson/Getty Images\n\nOverall, nearly 150 fires were reported in Oklahoma, Andy James, the state's Forestry Services fire management chief, told local media. The State Patrol said on social media that winds toppled several tractor-trailers.\n\nOklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt said that 70,000 acres had burned in the state. About 293 homes and structures had been destroyed as of Saturday afternoon — including Stitt's own farmhouse, he said.\n\nFirefighters had been prepositioned in certain areas, which helps authorities jump on blazes early, James said. Firefighting aircraft were also deployed in some parts of Oklahoma and Texas but were generally unable to fly due to low visibility from smoke and dust, he added.\n\nOfficials urged people in some areas of central Missouri's Camden County to evacuate due to wildfires, and the State Highway Patrol warned via social media that they were nearing homes and businesses.\n\nRoughly 120 miles of Interstate 70 in western Kansas were temporarily shut down due to blowing dust and limited visibility.\n\nHigh winds also knocked out power to more than 250,000 homes and businesses in Texas, Arkansas, Missouri, Michigan, Illinois, Indiana, and Mississippi, according the website poweroutage.us.\n\nBlizzard warnings in Northern Plains\n\nThe National Weather Service issued blizzard warnings for parts of far western Minnesota and far eastern South Dakota starting early Saturday. Snow accumulations of 3 to 6 inches were expected, with up to a foot possible.\n\nWinds gusting to 60 mph were expected to cause whiteout conditions.",

It was found dead in a crate in a bathroom closet near Arakawa's body, while two other dogs survived.\n\nAuthorities confirmed last week that Hackman died of heart disease with complications from Alzheimer's disease about a week after a rare, rodent-borne disease — hantavirus pulmonary syndrome — took the life of his wife. Hackman, in the advanced stages of Alzheimer's, apparently was unaware that his wife was dead.\n\nGene Hackman and his wife Betsy Arakawa are seen at Elaine's in New York City promoting his book \"Wake of the Perido Star,\" Nov. 3, 1999. Richard Corkery/NY Daily News Archive via Getty Images\n\nHackman was found in the home's entryway, and Arakawa was found in a bathroom. Like the dog, their bodies were decomposing with some mummification, a consequence of body type and climate in Santa Fe's especially dry air at an elevation of nearly 7,200 feet (2,200 meters).\n\nWhile both deaths were ruled to be from natural causes, the Santa Fe County Sheriff's Office is finishing up the investigation by tying up the timeline with any information gleaned from the cellphones collected at the home and last contacts that were made.\n\n\"The case is considered active until we have that information to tie up the timeline,\" said Denise Womack Avila, a spokesperson for the sheriff.\n\nZinna went from being a returned shelter dog to an incredible companion that was always at Arakawa's side, said Joey Padilla, owner of the Santa Fe Tails pet care facility that was involved in the surviving dogs' care.\n\nArakawa, born in Hawaii, studied as a concert pianist, attended the University of Southern California and met Hackman in the mid-1980s while working at a California gym.\n\nHackman, a Hollywood icon, won two Oscars during a storied career in films including \"The French Connection,\" \"Hoosiers\" and \"Superman\" from the 1960s until his retirement in the early 2000s.\n\nThe pair led a private life after moving to Santa Fe decades ago. A representative for the couple's estate has cited that privacy in seeking to block the public release of autopsy and investigative reports related to their deaths, especially photographs and video. It will be up to a state district judge to consider that request.",

        "content": "What is the Alien Enemies Act that Trump plans on using to deport migrants to Guantanamo Bay?\n\nA federal judge on Saturday night temporarily blocked President Trump from removing immigrants under a wartime law known as the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 after the president announced earlier in the day that he would enforce the law.\n\nThe judge's ruling was in response to a federal civil lawsuit filed Saturday by a group of five Venezuelan men in immigration custody in Texas and New York local jails against President Trump and other administration officials.\n\nMr. Trump invoked the 227-year-old wartime law earlier Saturday.\n\nThe lawsuit filed in federal court in Washington, D.C., by attorneys with the ACLU and Democracy Forward argues the Alien Enemies Act is \"a wartime measure that has been used only three times in our Nation's history: the War of 1812, World War I and World War II.\"\n\nPresidents are given the extraordinary power by the 227-year-old law to order the arrest, detention and deportation of noncitizens who are 14 years or older and come from countries staging an \"invasion or predatory incursion\" of the U.S.\n\nJames E. Boasberg, chief judge of the District Court for the U.S. District of Columbia, on Saturday implemented a temporary restraining order preventing their deportations for 14 days. The Justice Department appealed that decision, arguing the D.C. court has no authority over the case because none of the five men are in the district. Four are being held in detention in Texas and one in New York. They further argue that invocation of the Alien Enemies Act is \"speculation.\"\n\n\"We are thrilled the judge recognized the severe harm our plaintiffs would face if removed,\" said Lee Gelernt, the ACLU attorney leading the lawsuit against Mr. Trump's proclamation. \"The President's use of the Alien Enemies Act is flat out lawless.\"\n\nThen, following an emergency hearing Saturday evening, Boasberg expanded his order to include \"all noncitizens in U.S. custody\" who are covered by Mr. Trump's move to invoke the Alien Enemies Act.\n\nBoasberg also appeared to indicate that any deportation flights that were currently in the air with migrants subject to this order on board should be returned to the U.S.\n\nThe lawsuit states that Mr. Trump is \"expected to authorize immediate removal of noncitizens that the Proclamation deems to be alien enemies, without any opportunity for judicial review.\"\n\n\"It also contorts the plain language of the Act: arrivals of noncitizens from Venezuela are deemed an 'invasion' or 'predatory incursion' by a 'foreign nation or government,' where Tren de Aragua, a Venezuelan gang, is deemed to be sufficiently akin to a foreign nation or government,\" the lawsuit alleges.\n\nAs such, the government can identify any Venezuelan in the U.S. as a member of that gang, regardless of facts, and seek to deport them, the lawsuit alleges.\n\nIn the civil lawsuit, the men also argue the Alien Enemies Act \"has only ever been a power invoked in time of war, and plainly only applies to warlike actions: it cannot be used here against nationals of a country — Venezuela — with whom the United States is not at war, which is not invading the United States, and which has not launched a predatory incursion into the United States.\"\n\nThe next hearing in the case is scheduled for March 21.\n\nand contributed to this report.",

Getty Images/iStockphoto\n\nManaging debt can be tough when you're juggling multiple credit card payments, hefty interest charges and other types of financial stress — but that's a reality that many Americans are facing in today's high-rate inflationary environment. As prices have climbed over the last few years, more people have had to turn to credit cards to cover the essentials, and, in turn, credit card debt is rising, and so are the number of payment delinquencies and maxed-out card accounts.\n\nIf you're one of the millions who's struggling to stay on top of your bills right now, you may have considered credit counseling as a way to regain control. Many people turn to credit counseling when they feel stuck in a cycle of debt, as credit counseling services can offer guidance on budgeting, debt management and repayment strategies to help you get back on track. The experts who work for these services can also help you negotiate with creditors and provide the financial education you need to avoid similar situations in the future.\n\nBut as with any other type of debt relief, there are trade-offs to this type of assistance. One common downside of other debt relief strategies is a negative impact on your credit score. So, you may wonder whether seeking help through credit counseling will run the same risks. It's a valid question, especially when your credit score already feels fragile and you want to avoid further damage. But does credit counseling hurt your credit? Below, we'll detail what to know.\n\nFind out more about your top debt relief options here.\n\nDoes credit counseling hurt your credit?\n\nThe short answer is that credit counseling itself does not directly hurt your credit score. When you enroll in a credit counseling program, you work with a certified credit counselor who helps you create a budget, understand your debt and explore repayment options. Simply speaking with a counselor or receiving advice has no impact on your credit report.\n\nHowever, if you choose to enroll in a debt management plan, which is a common service offered by credit counseling agencies, there are a few things to keep in mind. A debt management plan consolidates your unsecured debt into one manageable monthly payment. The credit counseling agency also works with your creditors to negotiate lower interest rates and fees, which can help reduce your monthly payments. While this plan can make your debt easier to handle, it does come with potential drawbacks that could have an impact on your credit score, including:\n\nClosed accounts: As part of a debt management plan, creditors may require you to close credit card accounts to prevent further borrowing. Closing accounts can lower your available credit, which may impact your credit utilization ratio\n\nAs part of a debt management plan, creditors may require you to close credit card accounts to prevent further borrowing. Closing accounts can lower your available credit, which may impact Credit report notation: Some creditors may note on your credit report\n\nSome creditors may note on Missed payments before enrollment: If you've already missed payments\n\nThat said, many people find that completing a credit counseling program helps them improve their financial situation and, over time, can actually lead to a better credit score.\n\nChat with a debt relief expert about your available options now.\n\nWhat other debt relief options do I have that won't hurt my credit?\n\nIf you're hesitant about credit counseling due to potential credit implications, there are other ways to manage your debt while keeping your credit score intact. These include:\n\nDebt consolidation : A debt consolidation loan\n\n: Balance transfer : Some credit cards offer 0% interest balance transfer promotions\n\n: Some credit cards offer Budgeting and DIY debt repayment : If your debt is manageable, you might benefit from creating a strict budget and using methods\n\n: If your debt is manageable, you might benefit from creating a strict budget and Negotiating with creditors : At times, your creditors may be willing to work directly with you\n\n: At times, your creditors may be willing to Credit counseling without a debt management plan: You can still seek advice from a credit counseling agency without enrolling in a debt management plan. Many agencies even offer free financial education and budgeting assistance.\n\nThe bottom line\n\nCredit counseling is a valuable resource for those looking to regain control over their finances, and on its own, it does not harm your credit. However, enrolling in a debt management plan may have some minor short-term effects due to account closures and notations on your credit report. That said, successfully completing a credit counseling program can put you in a stronger financial position and even improve your credit over time.\n\nIf you're struggling with debt, exploring your options — including credit counseling, debt consolidation and budgeting strategies — can help you find the best solution for your situation. Be sure to take action before debt becomes unmanageable, though. By staying proactive, you can work toward a debt-free future while keeping your credit intact.",

Promotions are subject to availability and retailer terms.\n\nDebt management programs function differently than many other debt relief options, so it's important to understand how they work before enrolling. Getty Images\n\nWhether it's credit cards, medical bills or personal loans, falling behind on your debt payments can create stress and uncertainty. But while the situation can feel overwhelming, there's still hope for getting things back on track. For example, debt management programs offer a structured way to regain control of your finances. These programs, typically offered through credit counseling agencies, provide a pathway to consolidate multiple debts and can result in reduced interest rates, waived fees and structured repayment plans that help you become debt-free within a reasonable timeframe.\n\nWhile debt management plans are often confused with other types of debt relief programs, like debt consolidation or debt settlement, they are distinct. A debt management program does not involve taking out a new loan; rather, it restructures your current debt into a more manageable payment plan. So, this can be a great option for those who have a steady income but are struggling to keep up with high-rate payments.\n\nIf you're considering a debt management plan, though, understanding how the process works is an important part of that decision. Below, we'll detail what you need to know to help you determine whether a debt management program is the right solution for you.\n\nExplore the top debt relief options available to you.\n\nHow does the debt management process work?\n\nDebt management typically begins with a credit counselor completing a comprehensive assessment of your financial situation. This involves cataloging all outstanding debts, including credit cards, personal loans, medical bills and other financial obligations. During this initial phase, you'll need to gather information about each debt, including the creditor, outstanding balance, interest rate, minimum payment and due date. This financial inventory provides the foundation for developing an effective debt management strategy.\n\nThe next step is the development of a personalized debt management plan. During this phase, the credit counselor will review your income, expenses and debts to determine suitable repayment options. They may negotiate with creditors on your behalf to secure reduced interest rates, waived fees or extended payment terms. The goal is to create a single, manageable monthly payment that covers all your enrolled debts while potentially saving money on interest and fees.\n\nFor that to work, though, it requires consistent execution of the plan. This typically means making a single monthly payment to the credit counseling agency, which then distributes funds to your various creditors according to the negotiated terms. Throughout this process, which typically lasts three to five years, maintaining regular payments is crucial for success.\n\nOngoing monitoring and adjustments are also a frequent part of the debt management process. Life circumstances change, income fluctuates and unexpected expenses arise, and these regular reviews of your debt management plan ensure it remains aligned with your financial reality. Many successful debt management programs also include financial education to help you develop better money management skills and address the behaviors that may have contributed to the initial debt problems.\n\nCompare your debt relief solutions here now.\n\nWhat else to know about debt management\n\nA debt management plan can be a smart option to consider but it is not a solution for every situation — and it's essential to understand the pros and cons before enrolling. One of the biggest advantages is that it helps you pay off debt in a disciplined, structured manner without taking on new loans. The lower interest rates can also save you money in the long run, and eliminating the excess fees can ease financial strain.\n\nHowever, there are some drawbacks to consider. Because most debt management programs require you to close your credit card accounts, your credit score may take a temporary hit. Sticking to a strict payment schedule can also be challenging, especially if unexpected expenses arise. If you miss payments, your creditors may revoke the benefits that were negotiated through the program.\n\nIt's also important to work with a trustworthy credit counseling agency to avoid unnecessary fees or scams. Before signing up, research any credit counseling agencies you are considering and ensure they are accredited by organizations like the National Foundation for Credit Counseling (NFCC) or the Financial Counseling Association of America (FCAA).\n\nThe bottom line\n\nDebt management programs offer a practical solution for those struggling with unsecured debt. By working with a reputable credit counseling agency, you can consolidate payments, reduce interest rates and create a structured path to becoming debt-free. However, this type of program requires commitment, discipline and an understanding of how the process affects your financial situation.\n\nBefore enrolling, consider all of your available options, including budgeting strategies, debt consolidation loans or even negotiating directly with creditors. Every financial situation is unique and the right approach depends on your income, debt level and financial goals.",

        "source": "https://www.cnn.com/",
        "content": "West Palm Beach, Florida CNN —\n\nPresident Trump says he has ordered a “decisive” military action against Houthi rebels in Yemen, opening a new salvo against the Iran-backed group that has targeted shipping lanes in the Red Sea.\n\nTrump said the US would deploy “overwhelming lethal force” against the group “until we have achieved our objective.”\n\n“They have waged an unrelenting campaign of piracy, violence, and terrorism against American, and other, ships, aircraft, and drones,” Trump wrote on Truth Social.\n\nHe said US personnel were carrying out aerial attacks on Houthi bases, leaders and missile defenses “to protect American shipping, air, and naval assets, and to restore Navigational Freedom.”\n\n“No terrorist force will stop American commercial and naval vessels from freely sailing the Waterways of the World,” Trump wrote.\n\nTrump approved the Houthi strike plan — which he requested to be drawn up several weeks ago — late last week, and the final order was given on Saturday to begin what officials describe as a sustained attack on the group’s positions in Yemen.\n\nSome members of Congress received briefings from the White House on Saturday.\n\nFurther actions after Saturday will depend on battle damage assessments from this series of strikes, a US defense official told CNN. But there is expected to be more action against the Houthis over the next several weeks.\n\nA larger campaign of strikes took time to organize and plan because the US had to collect the intelligence necessary for more sweeping attacks against the Houthis, and that took a considerable amount of time. A senior military official recently told CNN the intel collection required for broader strikes had been completed.\n\nSmoke rises from a location reportedly struck by airstrikes in Sanaa, Yemen, on Saturday, the same day Trump announced airstrikes. Osamah Abdulrahman/AP\n\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio discussed the strikes with his Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov, stressing that, “continued Houthi attacks on U.S. military and commercial shipping vessels in the Red Sea will not be tolerated,” according to a readout from the State Department. Last summer, Russia was prepared to deliver weapons to the Houthis but pulled back following pressure from the US and Saudi Arabia.\n\nThe US has been working to degrade Houthi capabilities for months as the entity worked to disrupt international shipping lanes in the Red Sea, one of the world’s busiest waterways, calling the attacks a response to Israel’s war in Gaza against Hamas. The group has targeted more than 100 ships and vessels, including with drones, missiles and small ships.\n\nThe Biden administration sought to respond by carrying out targeted strikes on Houthi positions in Yemen, including attacking underground weapons storage facilities in October and November, but the actions did not prevent further attacks.\n\nThe Houthis had previously promised to stop attacks on ships in the Red Sea so long as the ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas was maintained. For more than a year, the group had carried out attacks on cargo ships in what it called revenge against Israel for its military campaign in Gaza, leading to a protracted crisis in the sea’s busy shipping corridor.\n\n“This ban will continue until the crossings into the Gaza Strip are opened and its needs for food and medicine are allowed to enter,” the Houthis said on Tuesday.\n\n“This is not a one off. This is the beginning of an ongoing series of events that will last days if not weeks,” a source familiar with the strategy told CNN. “There is not and will not be an invasion or troops on ground. But there will be a series of ongoing strategic targeted attacks.”\n\nEarlier this year, Trump signed an order designating the Houthis a “foreign terrorist organization.”\n\nAt least 13 people were killed and nine injured by the attacks on the Yemeni capital, according to the Houthi-run health ministry.\n\n“The US aggression against Yemen is a criminal escalation that will not break the will of the Yemeni people and will only increase their determination to support Gaza and the resistance,” the ministry’s spokesman Anees Alasbahi said in a post on X.\n\nTrump, in his message, said the Biden administration’s approach to the Houthis was “pathetically weak, so the unrestrained Houthis just kept going.”\n\n“It has been over a year since a U.S. flagged commercial ship safely sailed through the Suez Canal, the Red Sea, or the Gulf of Aden. The last American Warship to go through the Red Sea, four months ago, was attacked by the Houthis over a dozen times,” he wrote.\n\n“Funded by Iran, the Houthi thugs have fired missiles at U.S. aircraft, and targeted our Troops and Allies. These relentless assaults have cost the U.S. and World Economy many BILLIONS of Dollars while, at the same time, putting innocent lives at risk,” he went on.\n\n“To all Houthi terrorists, YOUR TIME IS UP, AND YOUR ATTACKS MUST STOP, STARTING TODAY. IF THEY DON’T, HELL WILL RAIN DOWN UPON YOU LIKE NOTHING YOU HAVE EVER SEEN BEFORE!” he said.\n\nThe president also offered a message to Iran, which backs the group.\n\n“To Iran: Support for the Houthi terrorists must end IMMEDIATELY! Do NOT threaten the American People, their President, who has received one of the largest mandates in Presidential History, or Worldwide shipping lanes. If you do, BEWARE, because America will hold you fully accountable and, we won’t be nice about it!” the president wrote.\n\nCNN’s Alayna Treene, Oren Liebermann and Mohammed Tawfeeq contributed to this report.",

        "title": "Mark Carney and the backlash against backlash politics",
        "source": "https://www.cnn.com/",
        "content": "CNN —\n\nMark Carney has never been a politician.\n\nYet now he’s sworn in as Canada’s new Prime Minister on Friday, he will face two of the most complex political challenges of any rookie world leader in years.\n\nFirst, he must win a general election that he’s expected to call almost immediately to try to capitalize on his Liberal Party’s revival after months in predecessor Justin Trudeau-inflicted doldrums.\n\nIf he wins, his prize will be a dubious one — dealing with US President Donald Trump. Just ask Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who was mauled in the Oval Office bear-pit, just how much fun that can be.\n\nCarney’s elevation is a classic confluence of a man and a moment.\n\nBut for Trump’s election victory and unprecedented threats to make Canada the 51st state, Carney would probably still be a private citizen and the Liberals would be heading for oblivion. But Trudeau’s resignation and a wave of patriotism swept up by Trump’s attacks left Conservative Party leader Pierre Poilievre, who was cruising towards the prime minister’s office himself, flailing.\n\nCarney looks like a banker because he is one. He ran the central Banks of Canada and England, and he’s billing himself as a pro who can manage the worst crisis in Canada-US relations for at least 40 years. He’s an old school antidote to Poilievre, a talented young ideologue whose alliterative soundbites are a good fit for the social media age. But the Conservative leader has one glaring liability — he’s a little too Trumpy — a factor that suddenly threatens to down his rising star. Populism was his route to power. Until it suddenly wasn’t.\n\nA backlash against backlash politics\n\nPoilievre’s problems and Carney’s arrival hint at a nascent trend 50 days into the new US administration. Trump’s return was widely seen as a harbinger of a second populist wave that would oust establishment figures all over the west. But a backlash against “America First” mayhem has lifted leaders seeking to operate in the political middle — that once looked like fallow political ground.\n\nIn Britain, Prime Minister Keir Starmer found fresh definition in the transatlantic tumult whipped up by Trump after a moribund start to his term that belied his landslide election win last year. His moving embrace of Zelensky after his disastrous visit to Washington was a show of independence from Trump and spoke for millions of Europeans. Starmer’s leadership holds out the possibility of a new era of UK-EU relations following the bitterness of Brexit. Beleaguered French President Emmanuel Macron — whose government keeps collapsing – is reborn as a Gaullist visionary, vowing to rebuild Europe’s military strength. And the rise of Germany’s likely next chancellor Friedrich Merz put the country on a stunning course out of America’s 80-year post-war tutelage moments after his general election victory last month.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, Britain's Prime Minister Keir Starmer and French President Emmanuel Macron hold a meeting during a summit at Lancaster House in central London on March 2. Justin Tallis/AFP/Getty Images\n\nAs leaders respond, far-right movements have been stalling. The anti-immigrant AfD did better than ever in Germany — but strong support from the Trump administration might have alienated some voters. The pro-Trump Reform party in the UK has been forced to distance itself from some Trump policies and the wild rhetoric of Elon Musk. French right-winger Marine Le Pen must be wondering whether antipathy to Trump could frustrate her National Rally’s hopes for a long-awaited breakthrough in the next French presidential election in 2027.\n\nSo what can Carney learn from all this?\n\nMacron and Starmer have evolved the classic how-to-deal-with Trump playbook. To self-demeaning flattery, they’ve added personal steel. By correcting the president’s falsehoods while in the Oval Office. Zelensky came a cropper when trying the same thing — but his stock soared back home at a time when Trump seems to be trying to oust him. And with the help of European leaders, he called Russia’s bluff by agreeing to Trump’s Ukraine ceasefire plan.\n\nBut Carney has bigger problems. After all, Trump is not openly attacking British or French sovereignty. The new PM can’t afford to ignore Canadians’ fury. A cynic might argue that if he calls a snap election, it suits him for cross border tensions to last until voters go the polls.\n\nCarney must also recognize reality. If a full-bore trade war rages between the US and Canada, there will be only one winner. Or more accurately, given the damage wrought by tariffs — one biggest loser – since both nations will be hurt by an estrangement in one of the world’s most lucrative trading relationships. To find a way out, Carney must ensure his campaign trail rhetoric doesn’t close off an eventual settlement with Trump.\n\nThe answers do not lie in Britain or France. They might be found in a speech by 91-year-old Jean Chrétien, the former Canadian PM who stole the show at the Liberal convention in Ottawa last weekend.\n\nThe old master waxed lyrical about his own confrontations with the US in a stirring defense of Canadian identify and patriotism. He peered into a camera and upbraided Trump: “I can say this from one old guy to another old guy: ‘Stop this nonsense. Canada will never join the United States.’”\n\nBut amid fierce anti-Americanism, Chrétien also kept alive the prospect of an eventual, and necessary rapprochement. “We have worked with and collaborated with the United States in the past, and I’m telling you, we will do so in the future.”",

        "content": "Albuquerque, New Mexico AP —\n\nAn examination of the dog found dead along with actor Gene Hackman and his wife in their Santa Fe home shows dehydration and starvation were likely what led to the animal’s demise.\n\nA report obtained by The Associated Press from the state Department of Agriculture’s veterinary lab details partial mummification and noted that while the severe decomposition could have obscured changes in the organs, there was no evidence of infectious disease, trauma or poisoning that could have resulted in death.\n\nThe report noted that the dog’s stomach was mostly empty except for small amounts of hair and bile.\n\nThe kelpie mix named Zinna was one of the couple’s three dogs. It was found dead in a crate in a bathroom closet near Betsy Arakawa’s body, while two other dogs survived.\n\nAuthorities confirmed last week that Hackman died of heart disease with complications from Alzheimer’s disease about a week after a rare, rodent-borne disease — hantavirus pulmonary syndrome — took the life of his wife. Hackman, in the advanced stages of Alzheimer’s, apparently was unaware that his wife was dead.\n\nHackman was found in the home’s entryway, and Arakawa was found in a bathroom. Like the dog, their bodies were decomposing with some mummification, a consequence of body type and climate in Santa Fe’s especially dry air at an elevation of nearly 7,200 feet (2,200 meters).\n\nGene Hackman and his wife, Betsy Arakawa, are pictured at the 60th Annual Golden Globe Awards in Beverly Hills, California, on January 19, 2003. Mark J. Terrill/AP\n\nWhile both deaths were ruled to be from natural causes, the Santa Fe County Sheriff’s Office is finishing up the investigation by tying up the timeline with any information gleaned from the cellphones collected at the home and last contacts that were made.\n\n“The case is considered active until we have that information to tie up the timeline,” said Denise Womack Avila, a spokesperson for the sheriff.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Medical examiner explains causes of death of Gene Hackman and his wife Betsy Arakawa 05:53 - Source: CNN Medical examiner explains causes of death of Gene Hackman and his wife Betsy Arakawa 05:53\n\nZinnia went from being a returned shelter dog to an incredible companion that was always at Arakawa’s side, said Joey Padilla, owner of the Santa Fe Tails pet care facility that was involved in the surviving dogs’ care.\n\nArakawa, born in Hawaii, studied as a concert pianist, attended the University of Southern California and met Hackman in the mid-1980s while working at a California gym.\n\nHackman, a Hollywood icon, won two Oscars during a storied career in films including “The French Connection,” “Hoosiers” and “Superman” from the 1960s until his retirement in the early 2000s.\n\nThe pair led a private life after moving to Santa Fe decades ago. A representative for the couple’s estate has cited that privacy in seeking to block the public release of autopsy and investigative reports related to their deaths, especially photographs and video. It will be up to a state district judge to consider that request.",

        "source": "https://www.cnn.com/",
        "content": "Washington, DC CNN —\n\nHundreds of demonstrators gathered nationwide outside Tesla showrooms Saturday amid heightened criticism against CEO Elon Musk’s federal cost-cutting role in the so-called Department of Government Efficiency and after Attorney General Pam Bondi vowed to crack down on vandalism against Tesla.\n\nThe demonstrations are part of the “Tesla Takedown” movement, a boycott that began on February 15 against Musk’s electric vehicle company. The campaign was started by Hollywood actor and filmmaker Alex Winter, and Joan Donovan, an assistant professor of Journalism and Emerging Media Studies at Boston University. DOGE has slashed thousands of government jobs, and this week it proposed a dramatic downsizing of the IRS that would result in a nearly 20% reduction of its workforce by May 15.\n\nMore than 80 demonstrations are slated for Saturday and more than 70 are planned through the end of April, according to the Tesla Takedown website. The movement wants people to “sell your Teslas, dump your stock, join the picket lines.”\n\nTesla did not respond to CNN’s request for comment.\n\nIn the Boston suburb of Dedham, about 100 demonstrators gathered outside a Tesla showroom. The Philadelphia suburb of West Chester had a similar turnout. Baltimore saw one of the biggest turnouts with at least 300 demonstrators\n\nIn Washington, DC, more than 50 demonstrators had gathered by noon outside a Tesla showroom, holding signs and dancing to songs by Beyoncé and Daft Punk as passing drivers honked their horns in support. The number of demonstrators on the gloomy and chilly day was a sharp uptick from the turnout about two weeks ago at the same Georgetown location.\n\nSara Steffens, a former journalist and policy advocate, said she paired up with Melissa Knutson, who is self-employed, to turn the demonstration into a dance party. Knutson said she wanted to replicate the musical atmosphere she saw at a demonstration in Maryland.\n\n“We need to have joy because this is a long haul, and we need to grow our movement against this authoritarianism,” Knutson told CNN.\n\nTrump administration responds after vandalism against Tesla\n\nPolice departments across the United States are investigating a wave of attacks on Tesla showrooms, charging stations and vehicles.\n\nOn March 3, seven charging stations in a mall outside of Boston were set on fire. Five days later in New York City, six protesters were arrested for occupying a showroom. In Colorado, a woman was accused of throwing Molotov cocktails and vandalizing vehicles and a showroom.\n\nBondi said Friday she had opened an investigation into vandalism against Tesla vehicles and showrooms.\n\n“If you’re going to touch a Tesla, go to a dealership, do anything, you better watch out because we’re coming after you. And if you’re funding this, we’re coming after you. We’re going to find out who you are,” Bondi said on Fox Business.\n\nAnd on Tuesday, President Donald Trump and Musk made an appearance on the South Lawn of the White House, where five Tesla vehicles were showcased. Trump called the vehicles “beautiful” and said he hoped the event would boost Tesla sales.\n\n“It’s like the Super Bowl, where it’s just mass exposure,” Jessica Caldwell, head of insights at automotive site Edmunds, told CNN about the media scene on the South Lawn.\n\nCaldwell thinks the attention Tesla received from Trump helps the automaker in the short term but is unsure if the efforts will “convert most people” who otherwise may not be interested in buying a Tesla.\n\nPressuring Musk\n\nMusk, the world’s richest man, owns about 411 million shares of Tesla, or about 13%, and has lost most of the gains the company saw in December. Shares of Tesla (TSLA), which closed at $249.98 on Friday, have shed about 48% of their value since peaking at $479.86 on December 17 and are down about 30% since the start of the demonstrations last month.\n\n“We have to think about not in just what’s the stock price from one day to the next, but keeping pressure on over the long term,” said Steffens at the demonstration in Washington, DC.\n\nKnutson said Tesla Takedown is not against Tesla drivers or the cars themselves.\n\n“We are specifically targeting Elon Musk, trying to bring his value down and to extract as much pain from him as we can,” she said.\n\nMeanwhile, more than 800 anti-Musk bumper stickers — most of which are intended to be placed on Tesla vehicles — have been sold on Amazon in the past month.\n\nTesla’s reputation sparks concerns\n\nNegative opinions of Musk will damage Tesla’s reputation, according to Caldwell.\n\nShe noted the negative attention could also get consumers to do more research and consider other EV options aside from Tesla. Caldwell said Tesla’s market share was weakened before these protests, as a slew of automakers have introduced new EVs to the market.\n\n“I imagine some (Tesla investors) are hoping that this is a short-term blip and things will eventually get a bit smoother,” she said. “It’s hard to say at this point.”\n\nAnd it’s too soon to tell if Tesla owners are willing to sell their vehicles because of the criticism of Musk.\n\n“Not everybody can afford to make those decisions,” she said.",

        "source": "https://www.cnn.com/",
        "content": "CNN —\n\nThe Voice of America may not live up to its ambitious name for much longer.\n\nMichael Abramowitz, the director of VOA, said in a Facebook post on Saturday that he was placed on leave, along with “virtually the entire staff” of 1,300. The announcement comes one day after President Trump signed an executive order to gut VOA’s parent agency.\n\nSome of VOA’s local-language radio stations have stopped broadcasting news reports and switched over to music to fill the airtime, according to listeners.\n\nEven top editors at VOA have been ordered to stop working, so employees expect the broadcaster’s worldwide news coverage to grind to a halt, according to half a dozen sources who spoke with CNN on the condition of anonymity.\n\n“The Voice of America has been silenced, at least for now,” a veteran correspondent said.\n\nVoice of America is part of the US Agency for Global Media (USAGM), which also runs networks like Radio Free Europe, Radio Free Asia, and Middle East Broadcasting Networks. Those networks are also on Trump’s chopping block, as networks’ contracts with the operators have been terminated.\n\nWhile Trump allies argue that the broadcasters are bloated and outdated, advocates say that by dismantling the networks, the United States is ceding the airwaves to China and other world powers, thereby harming American interests abroad.\n\nThe United States has been funding international news and current affairs coverage intended for global audiences for decades. Both Republican and Democratic leaders have supported the attempts to promote accurate news — and democratic values — in places that are saturated by foreign propaganda.\n\nThe agency’s mission statement, codified in law, is to “inform, engage, and connect people around the world in support of freedom and democracy.”\n\nBut the Trump administration has different expectations. An internal memo earlier this month said the mission is to “clearly and effectively present the policies of the Trump Administration around the world.”\n\nTrump appointed conservative media critic Brent Bozell III to run the parent agency and tapped election-denying former TV anchor Kari Lake to run VOA. Bozell’s Senate confirmation hearing is months away, with Lake serving as a “senior adviser.” Lake signed some of the emails announcing Saturday’s cuts.\n\nLake tweeted that the dismantling was taking effect because “the president has issued an Executive Order titled Continuing the Reduction of the Federal Bureaucracy.”\n\nTrump’s order said affected agencies should stop performing all work that is not statutorily mandated, and do the rest with as few people as possible.\n\nThe order was in line with Elon Musk’s declaration in February that government-funded international broadcasters should be shut down altogether.\n\n“Nobody listens to them anymore,” Musk posted on X. “It’s just radical left crazy people talking to themselves while torching $1B/year of US taxpayer money.”\n\nAdvocates for the outlets strongly disagree, pointing to the broadcasters as a bulwark for democracy. Those voices include Republican lawmakers.\n\n“Gutting Radio Free Asia and other U.S. Agency for Global Media platforms counters the principles of freedom our nation was founded on and cedes leverage to the Chinese Communist Party, North Korea and other regimes,” Rep. Young Kim, a California Republican who chairs the House Select Committee on East Asia and Pacific, told Politico last week.\n\nIt is unclear what will happen next to the USAGM’s various platforms.\n\nIn addition to the employees who were put on leave Saturday, some contractors who were working for VOA were told to hand in their badges.\n\nOther staffers went to VOA offices on Saturday to gather their belongings because they feared being locked out altogether, sources said.\n\nBut in a recent memo, before Trump signed his order, Lake made it sound like the broadcasters will continue to exist in some fashion going forward.\n\n“It is critical we recognize our agency is funded by hardworking American taxpayers, many of whom are struggling to make ends meet,” Lake wrote earlier this month. “That means we have an added responsibility to restore their trust while working efficiently and honestly to cover this consequential moment in our nation’s history.”\n\nLake said she would modernize the agency “into something the American people are willing to support.”\n\nAbramowitz said in his Facebook post that “VOA needs thoughtful reform, and we have made progress in that regard,” but sidelining the staff means that VOA won’t be able to carry out its mission.\n\n“That mission is especially critical today,” he wrote, “when America’s adversaries, like Iran, China, and Russia, are sinking billions of dollars into creating false narratives to discredit the United States.”\n\nThe American Foreign Service Association released a statement Saturday that it “will mount a vigorous defense of USAGM and the Foreign Service professionals whose expertise is indispensable to its mission.”",

        "content": "As Southern Mississippi faces an onslaught of tornadic storms, one large family is spending their Saturday in a “safe room” made of cinder blocks.\n\nThe family lives in Taylorsville, a small town in Smith County, which was under three separate tornado warnings in mere hours Saturday.\n\nStacy Bryant Hawkins, 59, said she could feel “suction” when a likely tornado hit Taylorsville Saturday afternoon.\n\n“Just the wind blowing. It gets really still when one comes close by but then all of a sudden the rain came with a force. We watched (the likely tornado) go over my back pasture,” Hawkins says. “It was more of a roaring sound.”\n\nTheir house did not have any damage but Hawkins is concerned about what will happen throughout the rest of the day.\n\nShe is most fearful of her family members getting hurt, especially her 84-year-old mother, who did not want to leave her Taylorsville home.\n\n“I am very scared of bad weather. We’ve been in our home 23 years and that’s why I insisted on a safe room being built,” she tells CNN.\n\nHer family has spent the last few hours in and out of their “safe room” on the first floor of their home. Because Smith County gets a lot of tornadoes, the family decided to create the storm room in their home, Hawkins explained.\n\nMultiple family members have taken shelter at her home, including her daughter-in-law, sister-in-law, a two-year-old and four dogs.\n\nHer brother-in-law wasn’t as lucky. His Taylorsville home just took a direct hit, Hawkins told CNN.\n\n“They have a tree in their master bedroom,” she said. “I know a lot of friends are over there helping them, and my husband and son, but I don’t know what they’ll do.”",

        "source": "https://www.cnn.com/",
        "content": "CNN —\n\nDemocrats have long found the flip phone Chuck Schumer still insists on using as an endearing quirk that illustrates how committed he is to his way of talking to all sorts of allies, all the time.\n\nAfter how he handled the spending fight, many inside and outside the Capitol are starting to see that phone as a metaphor for a leader who’s out of date and refusing to change as politics changes radically around him.\n\n“This is not the first time that members of the caucus expressed frustration that he wasn’t as inclusive as he could have been on decision making or strategy, but the stakes of this particular vote were huge,” said one Senate Democrat, who like others, is still wary of going public with attacks on the leader.\n\nBut CNN’s conversations with three-dozen Democratic senators, members of the House, top aides and other prominent leaders detail a cratering of support, with many starting to feel that he can’t be the party’s future and shouldn’t be their present.\n\n“If he doesn’t lose it between now and then, he won’t be leader in two years,” said another Democratic senator, who added, looking ahead to the next expected Congressional showdown, “he can’t be trusted alone to negotiate the debt limit.”\n\nIn a video he blasted out to his supporters Friday night, longtime Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders — an independent who caucuses with the Democrats — called the situation “an absolute failure of Democratic leadership.” In a video he blasted out to his own supporters, freshman California Sen. Adam Schiff called it “a bad day for our country – and for the Democratic Party.”\n\n“Schumer tried to be too smart,” said another Democratic senator, “but he ended up looking indecisive.”\n\nSchumer and the nine Democrats who voted with him on Friday say they were making the responsible decision between two horrible choices. Option one: advance a bill full of major cuts and leeway for Trump’s administration to reallocate billions of funds for their own purposes. Option two: enable a shutdown which could have stretched on indefinitely while Trump officials flexed executive authority over spending in ways they would find even more devastating, not to mention leaving tens of thousands of federal workers without pay and millions more without services.\n\nBut critics from across traditional Democratic divides of ideology, geography and age see a pile of excuses and false choices. They say Schumer flubbed weeks of strategy, essentially negotiating with himself for less to make the final bill worse than they could have gotten it to be with better pushback. They say he mismanaged dynamics internally with colleagues and publicly so that he ended up delivering a fresh round of dejection to a party already slumping on the ropes.\n\nAny Democrat paying attention knew this week of negotiations was going to be terrible for them. But, many say, it was Schumer’s leadership that left them looking and feeling even worse—and with much less leverage for future fight, now that Senate Republicans saw how easy it was to write what Trump wants into the bills, make no effort to reach out to Democrats, and watch them be the ones to attack each other.\n\n“Republicans saw Democrats were weak, and thought, ‘We’re going to call your bluff’—and they were right,” said a top aide to one Senate Democrat. “This was always going to be no-win. But it didn’t have to be this much of an ‘L’.”\n\nLosing some faith in the Senate, much more outside the Senate\n\nAs Trump got exactly the bill he wanted while losing only two Republican votes combined between the House and Senate, Schumer has lost faith among several of his Democratic senators for being able to manage the fights ahead. He left several of his own senators distrusting others in their own caucus. Several Democratic governors, who have privately been knocking Schumer as inept for weeks, finished Friday feeling more validated than they ever wanted to be.\n\nU.S. Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer (D-NY) (L) and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY) walk together as they leave a press conference introducing the Stop The Steal Act at the U.S. Capitol on February 04, 2025 in Washington, DC. The legislation, according to the Democratic leadership, is designed to combat Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) by preventing unlawful access to the Treasury Department's payment systems. Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images\n\nHouse Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries was not just frustrated by what played out, but annoyed that Schumer—who otherwise calls multiple times a day to check in on everything from strategy to tweets—barely talked to him about any of this over the last few weeks, according to several House Democratic sources. Always deliberate with his words, the only answer the fellow New Yorker would give on Friday when asked by CNN if he thought a change in Senate leadership was needed was, “next question.”\n\nOutside the Capitol, many Democratic assessments of Schumer are much harsher.\n\n“Democrats need a leader who is up to the moment both in terms of willingness to fight and ability to communicate about that willingness to fight. I don’t think at this point Senator Schumer has had either,” said Amanda Litman, the co-founder of the group Run for Something, which helps younger and newer Democratic candidates put together campaigns on the local level.\n\nA leader of a major Democratic-aligned organization, for now reluctant to exacerbate the party fractures by speaking publicly, said Schumer has now made himself irrelevant.\n\n“The biggest impact of this last week is that from now on, the broad spectrum of the Democratic Party, from the center to the left, will be looking to the House for leadership,” that person told CNN on Friday afternoon.\n\nSchumer believes he’s the one really grappling with the reality of Trump\n\nUS President Donald Trump and Tesla CEO Elon Musk speak to the press as they stand next to a Tesla vehicle on the South Portico of the White House on March 11, 2025 in Washington, DC. Mandel Ngan/AFP via Getty Images\n\nSchumer sees what he did, by contrast, as truly grappling with how different Trump is as a president now, versus when they had their showdown fights in his first term. Then, Schumer said repeatedly in conversations, Trump wasn’t looking for pretexts to fire federal government workers. Then, Schumer also said, Republican leaders in Congress were trying to avoid a shutdown, while now he saw them as egging one on in a way that he feared meant they wouldn’t have allowed government to re-open anytime soon.\n\n“Once you shut down the government, it is totally up to DOGE and Trump and Musk how long we’re in shutdown,” Schumer said in an interview with Jake Tapper on CNN on Friday evening. “We could have been in shutdown for months, and why did Musk and Trump want to shut down? Because they wanted this power to achieve their goal of dramatically shrinking, destroying, hurting innocent people in the government.”\n\nSo Schumer’s thinking going into the week, several people familiar with it told CNN, was trying to avoid letting House Speaker Mike Johnson use him as a foil—being clearer with his position, the Senate leader thought, would make it easier to line up House Republican votes. He also felt he was giving Jeffries the maximum amount of space to unite against the bill. And he figured this Republican leadership wouldn’t make any real concessions on the bill no matter what he did.\n\nFor three days in a row leading up to the vote, Schumer held long lunch meetings for the Senate Democrats to air their grievances and opinions about what to do. To many of the senators stewing and steaming through them, this felt like not having a strategy—to the point that one senator, according to a colleague, spoke up to say that even former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, despite being constantly mutinied against by his own Republican colleagues, managed to get a meeting with then-President Joe Biden during their 2023 debt limit fight.\n\nSchumer has told allies he saw these lunches as his strategy, trying to let colleagues coalesce around which of the bad options they felt was worse by arguing with each other, but without his twisting arms either way. He didn’t want a shutdown. He felt like Democrats would lose the political fight over one. But he says he wanted his colleagues to get there themselves.\n\nHe also called multiple senators into his office to tell them they had to convince particular colleagues to vote yes, and urged several leaders of Democratic-leaning organizations to tamp down their rhetoric pushing for a shutdown.\n\nAnd when Schumer announced his own yes vote, it was not just within a day of floating an alternative strategy—he even surprised one of his closest allies, according to multiple senators: Washington Sen. Patty Murray, the ranking member on the Appropriations Committee and far from a standard resistance figure. She ended up voting no.\n\nHouse Democrats were bewildered themselves by the suggestion that Schumer was doing them any favors. Several joined the nearly unanimous Democratic vote against the Republican budget bill not because they wanted a shutdown, but because they thought they were giving the Senate more leverage. Others were convinced that they needed to be part of a unified Democratic effort.\n\nSeveral close to Jeffries himself, meanwhile, scoff at Schumer’s suggesting that House Democrats didn’t think Johnson would pass the bill, arguing the senator doesn’t get how much obedience to Trump has come to define Republicans in Congress. They think Schumer never understood Jeffries’s strategy was to push for the fight since he was convinced Democrats could win, and worried about the policy and political consequences of putting a rubber stamp on the Republican bill.\n\nAt a panel of union leaders at their retreat, Connecticut Rep. Rosa DeLauro asked them to call Schumer to remind him that they supported a “No” vote. Several did. Schumer told those he spoke with he still felt confident he was right.\n\nLater in that same strategy session, another House Democrat vented more broadly: “What’s Chuck Schumer thinking?”\n\nAnother voice shouted back from the crowd, “Of himself!”\n\nMany members started to clap and cheer, according to two people in the room.\n\n“The relationship is broken,” one House Democratic member told CNN. “The anger is so strong right now that the future is hard to imagine.”\n\nDemocrats struggle to see Schumer as majority leader ever again\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a Democrat from New York, speaks during a news conference following the weekly Senate Democrat policy luncheon at the US Capitol in Washington, DC, US, on Tuesday, March 11, 2025. The House is scheduled to vote on a six-month spending bill that would make sure the whole government doesn't shut down, interrupting the fast start of President Donald Trump's second watch. Al Drago/Bloomberg via Getty Images\n\nSchumer’s fellow New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, who in 2017 stood out for voting against every one of Trump’s Cabinet nominees, by Thursday’s lunch of Senate Democrats was speaking so loudly in favor of voting Yes to advance the government funding bill that reporters outside could her through the walls.\n\nGillibrand is the chair of the Senate Democrats’ campaign arm for the 2026 elections. After voting yes, despite a detailed justification she argued in a press release from her office on Friday, several of her colleagues and Democratic operatives told CNN they did not see how she could credibly appeal to donors and voters who wanted more of a fight.\n\n“We are confident we will have the resources we need to win,” an aide to the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee told CNN. “When given an explanation, donors are receptive and understand the negative consequences of a shutdown.”\n\nOthers sympathetic to Schumer and Gillibrand argued to CNN that it’s hard to believe the intricacies of a procedural vote in March 2025 will really shape the 2026 midterms, especially because by the fall Democrats are expecting Republicans to push through a bill to enact much of Trump’s agenda that includes sweeping tax cuts and deep spending reductions on programs like Medicare without requiring a single Democratic vote, which they think will unify both Democratic officials and their supporters.\n\nBut with Senate Democrats acknowledging they probably don’t have enough opportunities in races to get to the majority even in their best case scenario for 2026, they are hoping to get there by 2028. By then, Schumer would be 77, in Washington for as long as Joe Biden had been when he was elected president, and have weathered years of compromises with Trump. He’d also have had to run for a sixth term that would keep him in office until his mid-80s.\n\nChatter about who will be the next Senate leader was whipping around Washington long before this week—though the focus of much speculation, Hawaii Sen. Brian Schatz, ultimately joined Schumer in voting “Yes.”\n\nAnd while multiple senators declined CNN’s interview requests because, they said, they wanted to be able to tell Schumer they weren’t involved in questioning his future, some of the No votes stood by him publicly.\n\n“Schumer is a senator as well, and every one of us has to make these tough decisions,” New Mexico Sen. Ben Ray Luján said on Friday. When asked if he questioned the New Yorker’s leadership, he said, “I support Chuck Schumer.”\n\nRepublicans “own the pain that will result from this Continuing Resolution, and they will own the disastrous effects of cutting Medicaid and Social Security—which they call a Ponzi scheme. We need to be ready for the fight ahead and redouble our efforts, and be unified,” said Connecticut Sen. Richard Blumenthal, also a No vote.\n\nAsked if he had any concerns about Schumer’s leadership going forward, Blumenthal answered without giving a yes or no, but insisted that was only because his only focus was Friday’s vote.\n\nOr there was Colorado Sen. John Hickenlooper’s response when asked on Friday afternoon if he had a message to those Democrats outside the Senate so outraged that they’re calling on Schumer to resign: “Oh, I don’t have a message”\n\nCNN’s Sarah Ferris and Manu Raju contributed to this report.",

        "content": "CNN —\n\nThe first time Beverly Carriveau saw Bob Parsons, she felt like a “thunderbolt” passed between them.\n\n“This man stepped out of a taxi, and we both just stared at each other,” Beverly tells CNN Travel today. “You have to remember, this is the ‘60s. Girls didn’t stare at men. But it was a thunderbolt.”\n\nIt was June 1968. Beverly was a 23-year-old Canadian university librarian on vacation in Mazatlan, Mexico, with a good friend in tow.\n\nBeverly had arrived in Mazatlan that morning. She’d been blown away by the Pacific Ocean views, the colorful 19th-century buildings, the palm trees.\n\nNow, Beverly was browsing the hotel gift store, admiring a pair of earrings, when she looked up and spotted the man getting out of the taxi. The gift shop was facing the parking lot, and there he was.\n\n“I was riveted,” says Beverly. “He was tall, handsome…”\n\nEventually, Beverly tore away her gaze, bought the earrings and dashed out of the store.\n\n“We locked eyes so long, I was embarrassed,” she says.\n\nNo words had passed between them. They hadn’t even smiled at each other. But Beverly felt like she’d revealed something of herself. She felt like something had happened, but she couldn’t describe it.\n\nBeverly rushed to meet her friend, still feeling flustered. Over dinner in the hotel restaurant, Beverly confided in her friend about the “thunderbolt” moment.\n\n“I told my girlfriend, ‘Something just happened to me. I stared at this man, and I couldn’t help myself.’”\n\nThen, the server approached Beverly’s table.\n\n“He said, ‘I have some wine for you, from a man over there.’”\n\nThe waiter was holding a bottle of white wine, indicating at the bar, which was packed with people.\n\nAs a rule, Beverly avoided accepting drinks from men in bars. She never felt especially comfortable with the power dynamic — plus, she had a long-term partner back in Canada.\n\n“I had a serious boyfriend at home and thought my life was on course,” she says.\n\nI was riveted. He was tall, handsome… Beverly on the moment she saw Bob for the first time\n\nPrior to traveling to Mexico, Beverly had spent a year exploring Europe and working in the UK. Throughout this period she’d politely declined whenever men in bars had offered to buy her cocktails.\n\n“It wasn’t like I’d never met men before,” she says today. “I’d been all over Europe for a year.”\n\nBut that evening in Mazatlan, after pausing for a moment, Beverly and her friend accepted the bottle of wine. Neither of them were quite sure why they agreed. And almost as soon as the waiter started pouring, the two women started panicking.\n\nThey weren’t sure who exactly had sent the wine, for one thing. The waiter had just gestured in the direction of the bar, which was packed. The man from the taxi did cross Beverly’s mind, but she couldn’t spot him, and there were a lot of other people sitting at the bar too.\n\n“We started talking amongst ourselves, ‘What are we going to do? We have to thank him,’” says Beverly. “Which was pretty funny, really.”\n\nEventually, Beverly’s friend persuaded her to go and seek out the mysterious wine donor. Slightly warily, Beverly made her way across the restaurant to the bar.\n\nShe glanced around at the various people, sitting on bar stools, sipping margaritas and sharing appetizers.\n\nAnd then, she locked eyes, for the second time, with the man from the taxi.\n\nHe was holding a drink, and tipped it forward to acknowledge her. This time, he smiled. Beverly felt herself blush again.\n\n“I got all flustered,” she says. “But I asked him if he’d like to come over and sit with us.”\n\nA “thunderbolt” moment\n\nBob and Beverly were connected from the moment they locked eyes for the first time. Courtesy Beverly Parsons\n\nBeverly returned to her table with the man from the taxi, much to the amusement of her friend. He introduced himself for the first time: Bob Parsons: a 30-year-old yacht captain from the US.\n\nBob managed a few yachts, he explained, and his main boat, the Sugar Shack, was parked in Mazatlan for the time being.\n\n“We had a nice dinner and a chat,” says Beverly. “He was not aggressive at all, a very quiet, straightforward guy.”\n\nThroughout the meal, Beverly and Bob kept exchanging glances at each other. Every time, Beverly felt the same “thunderbolt” feeling from earlier.\n\nShe was drawn to Bob. He was friendly and polite to her friend, too. But when his attention turned to Beverly, it felt different.\n\nAfter dinner, Bob suggested the trio “go downtown, to the Copa de Leche.” This was a bar on the beach, he explained. Beverly hesitated.\n\n“I didn’t know what kind of place that was. It was our first day,” she says today. “But my girlfriend wanted to go. And so I said, ‘Okay, but I want you to know it doesn’t mean anything.’ And he said, ‘I just asked you for a drink.’”\n\nBob, Beverly and her friend spent the rest of the evening drinking, dancing and chatting at the Copa de Leche, an Art Deco club facing onto the ocean.\n\n“We had a nice time, but my father always taught me about sailors and Americans, and you know, you have to be careful,” says Beverly. “And I had Doug, my boyfriend at home. I wasn’t looking for anything.”\n\nBut for all Beverly’s reservations and hesitations, she still felt something distinct, every time she looked at Bob, that she’d never felt before.\n\n“I was just flabbergasted, and I could not think of anything else,” she says.\n\nFor the next week of her vacation, Beverly saw Bob every day. She outwardly set boundaries — she was never alone with him, they always went out for the evening with Beverly’s friend completing their party.\n\nBut when he asked for her contact details, Beverly agreed, giving Bob her phone number and address.\n\nAfter returning home to Vancouver, Canada, Beverly went straight to her mailbox.\n\nShe’d been thinking about Bob the entire plane journey home.\n\n“I was frantic,” she recalls. “You couldn’t afford phone calls in those days, we had to write to people — we didn’t have communications like we do now. So I was hoping I’d have heard from him, and I went through all the mail and there were no letters… but at the bottom was a note from my roommate that said: ‘Who the hell is Captain Parsons on the Sugar Shack?’”\n\nWhen Beverly saw the note, she laughed out loud. She already knew, in her heart, that she had to give this connection a chance. The fact he’d called already cemented this certainty.\n\n“The next day, my boyfriend, the one I had for three years, Doug, came to see me. And before he even had his jacket off, I just said, ‘Doug, I’ve met somebody.’”\n\nBeverly told Doug that this “somebody” was based in Mexico, that nothing had happened between them, but she’d felt a connection she couldn’t deny. Doug was surprised, but took it relatively well.\n\n“He said, ‘Well, that’s crazy. You better go down and figure this out.’”\n\nReuniting in California\n\nBeverly decided to trust her instincts, follow her heart and take a chance on Bob. Courtesy Beverly Parsons\n\nThroughout July 1968, Beverly and Bob wrote letters to each other.\n\n“But writing back and forth to Mexico was a bit crazy,” she recalls. “Took forever.”\n\nThen, towards the end of July, Beverly got a call from an unknown number. It was the wife of the owner of the Sugar Shack, who explained they were heading to California to pick up a new motor yacht the following weekend.\n\n“She said, ‘Our captain wants you to fly to San Diego for the weekend, and he asked me to get you a hotel room,’” recalls Beverly.\n\nWithout hesitation, Beverly said she’d be there.\n\nShe knew it was “crazy.”\n\n“I’d only known him a week, never been alone with him…” she says today.\n\nBut Beverly couldn’t stop thinking about Bob.\n\nAnd if it hadn’t been love at first sight in Mexico, Beverly and Bob knew for certain they were falling for each other following this whirlwind weekend in San Diego.\n\nBeverly enjoyed being in Bob’s company.\n\n“He was not aggressive at all, he was just a very quiet, straightforward guy, not effusive,” she recalls. “He was tall, handsome… he didn’t know he was, that made him even more attractive. He was a presence.”\n\nAnd together, they just clicked.\n\nI couldn’t wait, and so I didn’t wait. I thought…‘If I don’t go, I’ll wonder the rest of my life.’ Beverly, on the moment she decided to run away with Bob\n\n“I flew home Monday morning, and with my jacket still on, typed my resignation, and gave it to all three departments that I was working for — political science, economics and sociology — and I sent them all a letter,” she recalls.\n\n“And I called Doug and I said, ‘Well, you told me to figure it out. I don’t know what I’m doing, but I have to do it.’ My parents were shocked, but my friends were even more in shock, and I just couldn’t help myself. I knew it was stupid and wrong, because, you know, people didn’t do this kind of thing then.”\n\nBut whenever Beverly encountered concerns or hesitations from her loved ones, she remembered the moment she’d seen Bob for the first time. She relived the weekend in San Diego in her mind. She knew this was the right decision.\n\n“I was so excited,” she says. “I couldn’t wait, and so I didn’t wait. I thought…‘If I don’t go, I’ll wonder the rest of my life.’”\n\nMoving to Mexico\n\nBeverly moved to Mexico to be with Bob. Shortly after, he asked her an important question. Courtesy Beverly Parsons\n\nBeverly arrived in Mazatlan at the end of August, 1968. She and Bob were thrilled to be together.\n\nIn Mexico, Bob managed four boats: the Sugar Shack, El Hefe, Gold Coaster and movie star Jerry Lewis’ boat, Pussy Cat 2, later called Shady Lady. Beverly started working on board the yachts in an informal capacity.\n\nOne day, Beverly and Bob were both on board, when Bob sought her out.\n\n“He came out of the engine room, wiping grease off his hands, and he said, ‘I would like to get married,’” recalls Beverly.\n\nBeverly was totally taken aback. And then she surprised herself by thinking about Doug, the ex-boyfriend back home. And her parents.\n\nIn her shock, she actually mentioned Doug aloud to Bob.\n\n“He said, ‘Well, if you were concerned about Doug, you would be in Canada, not here,’” recalls Beverly.\n\nStill in disbelief, Beverly said they should call her parents. Bob agreed. So from the boat, they dialed Beverly’s parents, thousands of miles away in Canada.\n\n“We called on the single-sideband, which means that you call from a radio to a point where an operator can hook you to a telephone,” recalls Beverly. “And by the way, the whole ocean can listen to the call, because it’s on the radio.”\n\nThe operator connected the phone, and Beverly’s mother answered.\n\nShouting into the phone, Beverly told her she and Bob were going to get married.\n\n“You had to say, ‘over,’ when you’re supposed to talk and everything,” recalls Beverly. “And so she’s saying ‘over’ all the time, and we’re screaming into the radio — I don’t know why we had to scream, but we were screaming.”\n\nEventually, the message got across. And Beverly’s mother’s response was matter-of-fact.\n\n“She says, ‘Well, if you’re getting married, you’re coming up here and getting married in the church.’”\n\nBeverly was surprised, she’d expected her mother would object or suggest her daughter should wait.\n\nMeanwhile, the radio operator, who could hear the whole call, “was laughing so hard.”\n\n“The whole conversation was so crazy,” reflects Beverly.\n\nShe woke up the next day feeling vaguely dazed. Happy, yes. But still kind of in shock.\n\n“I’m getting married,” she thought. “I need a dress.”\n\nMeanwhile, in Vancouver, Beverly’s mother was busy pulling a last-minute celebration together.\n\n“My mom, in three weeks, found a cancellation of a beautiful place, planned a seated dinner with a live orchestra for 90 people, all by herself.”\n\nA new friend Beverly had made in Mazatlan helped her sew her wedding dress.\n\n“I would go to her house at eight and sew my wedding dress, hand seeded pearls all over the veil. Did the veil too — Mexican lace.”\n\nAs Beverly perfected her wedding dress and sought out material for bridesmaid dresses, she found herself thinking about the decision to marry someone she’d only known a few months, and analyzing what it meant.\n\n“I was excited. I was scared. But my thinking was — I followed this man from Canada to Mexico. I’m going to follow him wherever he goes next. So, therefore, I must be in love, and getting married is just fine, the right thing to do,” she says.\n\n“So we met end of June, I came down [to California] in July, went back to Mexico in August, and flew up to get married in September.”\n\nBeverly and Bob arrived in Vancouver with her handmade dress and vibrant bridesmaid outfits in her suitcase. Bob met Beverly’s parents and Canadian friends for the first time. Beverly’s parents were enthusiastic and welcoming to Bob, and Beverly’s mother promised Beverly the wedding plans had come together perfectly.\n\nFor Beverly, on the morning of her wedding day ,there was an air of the surreal. She was thrilled, she knew she loved Bob, and was confident in her decision. But she couldn’t quite believe this was happening. And she could tell some of the guests were a bit baffled.\n\n“I didn’t know anything about my wedding, and I’m sure all my friends were there, just wondering who this guy was,” says Beverly. “They were all friends with the other guy, Doug.”\n\nBut as the day progressed, any reservations from Beverly’s loved ones melted away.\n\n“Bob got up and made a toast to the bride. And when he did, he got all choked up, and then everyone fell in love with him,” recalls Beverly.\n\n“So all my friends and family actually loved him from the very beginning, and so that was a wonderful thing, because we’ve done many trips with my old friends and vacations and back and forth, and it was really wonderful.”\n\nLooking back today, Beverly is thankful the wedding panned out the way it did.\n\n“I’m really glad my mother made me get married in the church,” she reflects. “It means a lot, actually, it’s part of the commitment and having all your friends there, and it was a good thing getting them to know him, too. So it was good. It was all good.”\n\nLife at sea\n\nBeverly and Bob settled for a while in Cabo San Lucas, now a busy resort town, then a sleepy coastal spot. Courtesy Beverly Parsons\n\nBeverly took Bob’s name when they married, becoming Beverly Parsons. Together, Beverly and Bob returned to Mexico to reunite with the boat owners.\n\nThis time, they were heading to Cabo San Lucas — now a bustling resort town, then a sleepy beachside spot with just over 1,700 residents.\n\nThe couple rented a home on the beach, with one of the yacht deckhands. It was the perfect location.\n\n“Bob was just a dinghy ride away from the boat. It was just right in front,” recalls Beverly. “I started learning Spanish from the deckhand who was living with us, he would speak to me in Spanish, and I would respond in English, and we had this two-language conversation — and I still see him once in a while when I go to Mazatlan.”\n\nIn time, Beverly became a cook on the yacht, and she and Bob started living on board. They became really close with the boat owners.\n\n“They had money, but they were just regular people,” says Beverly. “We lived through things. We went through hurricanes together. We traveled together. We spent a year in Acapulco — Bob was rebuilding another boat for them.”\n\nWhirlwind romance: Bob and Beverly saw one another for the first time while on vacation in Mazatlan, Mexico in 1968. The two strangers felt an instant connection, and soon Beverly was living with Bob, a yacht captain. Courtesy Beverly Parsons Taking a chance: Looking back today, Beverly says she knew running away to Mexico with Bob was \"crazy,\" but it was the right decision for her. “I couldn’t wait, and so I didn’t wait. I thought…‘If I don’t go, I’ll wonder the rest of my life,'\" she tells CNN Travel. Courtesy Beverly Parsons Working and living together: Bob worked on board yachts as captain, soon Beverly joined him, working on board. “We were always happy… A lot of people say you can’t work with your husband, but I loved it,\" says Beverly. Courtesy Beverly Parsons Adventures at sea: Their boating days were adventurous and great fun. \"When you live that close to someone for five years on a boat, you know them. You know you trust them. I trusted him with my life,” says Beverly.

He passed away in early 2020. Beverly loves reflecting on their incredible life together. \"How lucky can someone be? And to be able to have 50 years? It’s just unbelievable when you think about it. I’m just so glad that I took a chance,\" she says. Courtesy Beverly Parsons She felt a ‘thunderbolt’ when she saw the ‘handsome’ yacht captain in 1968.

This feeling was enhanced when, on more than one occasion, Bob was mistaken for a movie star.\n\n“I remember going to Las Vegas, and he went to the bathroom… and some girls came running up to me and said, ‘We know he’s a movie star, but we just can’t put our finger on his name,’” Beverly laughs.\n\nBeverly and Bob were happy together. They loved each other, loved being in each other’s company.\n\nBut occasionally, Beverly felt less-than-fulfilled, professionally speaking.\n\n“Sometimes I felt like a bird in a gilded cage,” she says. “I was used to making my own money. I had put myself through university. I had taken myself to Europe for a year.\n\n“But I did not know that I was preparing myself for the most amazing career any woman could have, ever, I think.”\n\nA new career adventure\n\nIn time, Beverly started working as a boat agent. Bob supported her dreams. Nerys Poole\n\nAfter a few years in Mexico, Beverly and Bob found themselves in San Diego, where Bob was now working as a captain and navigator on a commercial fishing vessel.\n\n“One day, I got a call from a big yachting company,” says Beverly. “A friend of mine who worked there as their marina manager, she said, ‘Bev, we don’t have a weekend person. Can you come in on weekends?’”\n\nThis temporary job was the beginning of Beverly’s career as a boat agent. And in time, Bob stopped working on board boats and became a yacht broker. The couple settled on land — even though their work still involved getting out on the water from time to time.\n\n“Someone could buy a boat from Bob, insure it from him, charter it, manage it with me and charter it out. And we were sort of like a package, and we were really quite successful,” says Beverly.\n\nSometimes, Beverly felt like their life was straight out of a movie and occasionally, Bob was mistaken for a movie star. Chelsea Stevenson\n\nEarly on in their relationship, Bob and Beverly had discussed the idea of having children. When they lived on yachts it felt like kids were out of the question, but they agreed to revisit the conversation in a few years.\n\nWhen Beverly turned 30, the couple decided that they were still on the same page — they weren’t going to have children. They had a fulfilled, happy, exciting life, and Bob was also close to his nieces and nephews.\n\nOver the next decades, the couple traveled a lot for work, including to Turkey, Tahiti, all across the Caribbean.\n\n“We just had a beautiful life, beautiful friends, beautiful industry,” says Beverly. “We were always happy… A lot of people say you can’t work with your husband, but I loved it.”\n\nTheir early years on the yacht had built a strong foundation, she says, both for working together and enjoying married life together.\n\n“When you live that close to someone for five years on a boat, you know them. You know you trust them. I trusted him with my life,” says Beverly. “I totally trusted him in every way. And I think when you have a partner, I think you need love — which obviously we had — trust and respect. I had all those things.”\n\nSupport and love\n\nBob and Beverly enjoyed 52 years of a marriage founded on love and support. Courtesy Beverly Parsons\n\nLooking back on meeting Bob, those early years, working together across the globe, and their eventual 52 years of marriage, Beverly says she feels like “one of the luckiest people ever.”\n\n“I totally loved him, and it was just great,” she says. “He got dementia at the end, and I was not going to put him in any facility. Even though I was working, I cut back on hours, and I made it the best I could for him and me.”\n\nBob lived with dementia for several years before he passed away in early 2020.\n\n“When Bob would have incidents with his dementia, I put myself in his shoes. And I knew he was just scared — and who wouldn’t be — I just held him really tight, and I would just say, ‘I love you, I’ll never leave you, and I’m sorry.’ And he would calm right down,” says Beverly.\n\n“It’s so easy if you really love someone. And I know that that was actually a good part of our life… it was just a different stage.”\n\nIn the five years since Bob’s death, Beverly has continued to thrive in the yachting business. She turns 80 this year, but she still loves her career, loves her industry.\n\nI totally trusted him in every way. And I think when you have a partner, I think you need love — which obviously we had — trust and respect. I had all those things. Beverly, reflecting on her life with Bob\n\nIn the mid-1960s, before she met Bob, Beverly had reservations about the institution of marriage. She’d have long conversations with her Vancouver roommate about the importance of staying independent, not being tied down in an era where marriage was still looked at through a patriarchal lens and traditional gender roles.\n\n“We always thought of marriage as a cage,” she recalls.\n\nBut now, Beverly reflects that her marriage to Bob propelled her forward. He loved her independence, and his love gave her the foundation and anchor to explore the world and be herself, find her place.\n\n“In our day, you could be a teacher, you could be a secretary, or you could be a nurse, basically. And that was your three choices, and I got to be something else, and with his, not only support, but encouragement,” she says. “I had that support. He always supported me.”\n\nBeverly says she's so grateful Bob entered her life and that she took a chance on love, all those decades ago. Courtesy Beverly Parsons\n\nToday, Beverly lives in California. She’s still close with all her old friends — from the ones who sat there, unbelieving, at her wedding, to the people she met in Mexico, on the yachts.\n\nShe’s even, perhaps against the odds, become good friends with her ex-boyfriend Doug in recent years.\n\nBeverly had always felt a bit guilty about how they’d ended things. When they got back in touch, she apologized, even though it was decades ago, and she’d lived a whole life with Bob in the meantime.\n\nDoug told her, “You don’t need forgiveness.”\n\nThis year, Beverly turns 80 and she’s going on a cruise around Alaska with Doug to celebrate.\n\n“We’re both born the same month,” she says.\n\nWhen she thinks back on her decade-spanning romance with Bob, Beverly often finds herself reflecting on a conversation she had with her father on her wedding day — right after Bob had wowed everyone with his heartfelt, emotional toast.\n\n“He said to me, when I got married, ‘I can’t imagine much worse than my only daughter going away to a foreign country, floating around on a boat, not being able to contact her, not knowing where she is or if she’s safe,’” Beverly recalls.\n\n“But then he said, ‘I looked at the two of you and… I didn’t want to stop you, because I could see how much you cared.’ And so, I mean, how lucky can someone be? And to be able to have 50 years? It’s just unbelievable when you think about it. I’m just so glad that I took a chance.”",

        "content": "CNN —\n\nAfter undergoing surgery, Ashton Colby was confined to bed and couldn’t move his arms or carry out basic tasks.\n\nBut his father Rick Colby was there every step of the way, helping him recover from his top surgery – support that meant the world from his conservative Republican father after Ashton came out as transgender and underwent the operation.\n\nSurgery is an option that some, but not all, trans people choose as a part of the broader gender-affirming care they may receive to help them with their transition. Ashton was 19 at the time.\n\n“He was there in the hotel room while helping me recover and drink protein shakes when I couldn’t use my arms. He’s made, literally, a life-or-death difference in my life,” Ashton, now 32, told CNN.\n\nAshton had been tormented by fear that he would be rejected by his family in the weeks leading up to his coming out in 2012. But his father stood by him through therapy and doctor’s appointments, ensuring he would get the specialized care he needed to affirm his gender and thrive, which Ashton says: “Saved my life.”\n\nRick voted for President Donald Trump in 2024, and he describes his role as an “offensive lineman” in a greater mission to fight misconceptions and legislation attacking transgender rights and health care.\n\nNow, there’s a new challenge to face: an executive order from Trump denying federal funding for providers of gender-affirming health care for minors. The order threatens to upend even care for Ashton, who is an adult, and for many others.\n\nWhile the executive order only applies to gender-affirming care for those under 19 and has been temporarily paused by two federal judges, it’s still affecting patients of all ages. Many clinics and hospitals around the nation temporarily halted gender-affirming care before the order was blocked by the judges, and while care has returned at many locations, providers concerned about losing federal funding worry they will have to stop care altogether in the future, experts in the field of gender-affirming care told CNN.\n\nAshton feared his family would reject him before coming out in 2012. Maddie McGarvey for CNN\n\nRick voted for Trump but publicly advocates for transgender rights. Maddie McGarvey for CNN\n\nAshton has received gender-affirming care from the same Ohio clinic since 2015 as an adult. Last year, Ohio banned some parts of gender-affirming care for minors. While gender-affirming care for adults is still legal in Ohio, Ashton was warned last month by his provider that patients might have to drive across the state line to Pennsylvania to access care in the wake of Trump’s order, Ashton said. His medical center relies on millions of dollars in federal support to treat all its patients.\n\nThe executive order has plunged medical providers and their patients in the field into chaos, even in blue states where the care was previously safeguarded.\n\nThe disruptions to gender-affirming care after the order are already palpable. Patients on puberty blockers who need to transition to hormone therapy have already experienced or are fearful of interruptions to their treatment and are facing significant medical risks, according to one pediatric doctor who spoke with CNN anonymously due to threats to her safety.\n\nThe order is part of a wave of measures targeting gender-affirming care that have been pushed in recent years – along with a record number of anti-LGBTQ bills introduced in 2023– across the United States, largely by Republicans.\n\nRick Colby says he can’t support the Trump administration’s moves targeting the transgender community.\n\n“I agree with just about everything Trump is doing except for transgender people,” Rick told CNN.\n\nFor Ashton, undergoing gender-affirming care allowed him to be in “a great place and be the person he was always meant to be, which is a man,” his father said.\n\n“It doesn’t matter what your political affiliation is, my main concern is how to keep your child alive and help them to be happy and thrive and be productive members of society,” Rick said.\n\nRick shows a photo taken with his son Ashton outside of the US Capitol. Maddie McGarvey\n\nAnxiety over upended treatment plans\n\nAshton Colby takes testosterone as a weekly injection in an ongoing treatment plan to manage the gender dysphoria he says, “I now luckily don’t have.”\n\nENDORSING CARE Gender-affirming care is medically necessary, evidence-based care that uses a multidisciplinary approach to help a person transition from their assigned gender – the one the person was designated at birth – to their affirmed gender – the gender by which one wants to be known.\n\nis medically necessary, evidence-based care that uses a multidisciplinary approach to help a person transition from their assigned gender – the one the person was designated at birth – to their affirmed gender – the gender by which one wants to be known. While some critics of the therapies suggest those under the age of 19 should wait until adulthood to transition, the American Academy of Pediatrics says that’s an outdated approach that assumes gender identity is fixed at a certain age.\n\nThe treatment is endorsed by the American Medical Association, the American Psychiatric Association and the American Academy of Pediatrics, among other major medical groups, as clinically appropriate for children and adults with gender dysphoria, a psychological distress that may result when a person’s gender identity and sex assigned at birth do not align.\n\nBut he worries his treatment plan will be upended for the first time since he’s transitioned. When patients undergoing hormone therapy stop taking testosterone, some of the physical changes can be reversed, according to the Mayo Clinic.\n\n“I’ve been really worried that, even as an adult, my care might be taken away or made much harder to access,” Ashton said.\n\nHe’s not alone. Multiple health care professionals told CNN they’ve been hearing from anxious patients and parents of trans children who have already experienced or anticipate disruptions to their children’s medical care.\n\nThe future of their treatment is uncertain no matter which state they live in, experts say, as clinics and medical institutions take a “risk-averse” approach due to the threat of losing essential federal funding to treat all patients and conduct research.\n\nIn the week after Trump signed the order, clinics and hospitals around the country made public announcements they were suspending gender-affirming care for those under the age of 19 but later in February resumed the care after state attorneys general warned denying the treatment could violate states’ anti-discrimination laws. A few of those medical institutions included Denver Health, Children’s Health Colorado, Children’s Hospital Los Angeles and Corewell Health in Michigan.\n\nTwo federal judges have paused Trump’s order, including US District Judge Brendan Hurson in Baltimore who on March 4 extended a temporary restraining order that was previously entered in the case, saying health care disruptions for trans youth could be “potentially catastrophic” and noting the risks of heightened gender dysphoria and suicide uncertainty.\n\nA group of 15 attorneys general also issued a joint statement in February to “reaffirm their support” for gender-affirming care and said they “will continue to enforce state laws that provide access to gender-affirming care.”\n\nBut even as some hospitals and clinics reverse course, the volatility of the medical treatment is keeping anxieties high as providers and families deal with the fallout from the order and the pending legal case.\n\nMany institutions are pausing care “in secret” without documenting the changes formally but instead telling providers to cancel quietly because they fear backlash, according to Alex Sheldon, executive director of GLMA, one of multiple LGBTQ groups suing the Trump Administration over the executive order.\n\n“If funding is conditioned on not providing care to a very small patient population — trans and non-binary young people — losing that funding would force many hospitals to shut down completely,” Sheldon said.\n\nMany medical institutions have decided to “err on the side of fear,” Sheldon said.\n\n“It’s cruel because you must choose who’s going to suffer. We know it will be the transgender patients because they’re a smaller number,” said the pediatric doctor who spoke anonymously. “Do you stop this care that’s so crucial and life saving for these kids, or do you put at risk the care of all these patients that also need it?”\n\nProviders are already responding to “frantic calls” from their patients’ parents, the doctor said.\n\n“They’re asking us, ‘What’s going to happen? Are you going to close? Can you get a refill of prescriptions as soon as possible before you close?’ There are patients scheduled for puberty blockers a month from now and they’re worried that they’re not going to get there.”\n\nSome families are making plans to move out of the country, including those without many resources, the physician said.\n\nAshton and his father hang out at his apartment in Columbus, Ohio. Maddie McGarvey for CNN\n\nThe human cost of pausing care\n\nHealthcare providers in the field say they are facing an impossible choice between maintaining ethical standards of care and risking their livelihoods, as legislation could mean they’ll lose their jobs or medical licenses for following established medical guidelines backed by every major medical association.\n\nMEDICAL RISKS Pausing puberty – a therapy that’s fully reversible– gives adolescents time to think about their gender identity and their guardians time to consider options before their bodies begin changing in ways that can trigger dysphoria, according to experts.\n\nOne major concern is for children on puberty blockers who won’t be able to access hormone therapy if care stops suddenly, the doctor explained.\n\n“They can’t be going into their late teens without hormones because then there’s significant medical risks,” the doctor added.\n\nPatients on puberty blockers have implants under the skin that can only be surgically removed, according to the doctor.\n\n“So, we right now have the ethical question of: If we keep it in but they don’t get any hormones, they’re going to have issues with their bone density, maybe brain development,” the doctor said. “But then if we remove the implant, they’re going to go backwards. The endogenous puberty will start and that’s going to be pretty traumatic – what do we do?”\n\nNot all providers will halt services if Trump’s order is enforced.\n\nA non-profit health center that receives federal funding is still providing gender-affirming care to youth but will look to secure alternative funding if the order is enforced, according to its leadership team who agreed to speak with CNN anonymously due to safety and privacy concerns.\n\nHospitals, especially academic medical centers, commonly receive research funding from the federal government. It varies more for clinics, but they typically get funds from sources that charge insurance companies, have a sliding scale fee and may also receive federal grants, according to the health center’s CEO.\n\n“There are hundreds of us who provide hormone therapy to patients. We all understand this is primary, routine care for people and there’s great evidence on it. For many of us, it’s essential to keep doing because we just think it’s primary care,” the CEO said.\n\n“I agree with just about everything Trump is doing except for transgender people,” Rick told CNN. Maddie McGarvey for CNN\n\nSupporting a party that doesn’t understand what’s at stake\n\nFor Ashton Colby, support from his loved ones helps him cope with the fear and uncertainty surrounding care during the Trump administration.\n\nAshton’s father fiercely contests claims by Republicans that “people are becoming transgender on a whim.” He cites his first-hand experience witnessing Ashton suffer from gender dysphoria.\n\n“He suffered immensely through his formative years and as a teen… the depression, the anxiety, the stress.”\n\nFor Ashton and other transgender and nonbinary people, uncertainty now looms over their future appointments and the continued treatment regimen they rely on.\n\n“I shouldn’t have to have an exit plan with my provider in this way. I’ve been nervous,” Ashton said.\n\nRick believes the “extreme right” of his party does not “believe being transgender is a real thing at all” and says they engage in efforts to “erase them and make life difficult, even though transgender people are American citizens and are trying to participate in the American dream and live their lives to be left alone like everybody else.”\n\nThe path forward, he says, is for the Republican party to listen to the transgender community and the physicians who care for them.\n\nRick said the most hate he receives is when “I identify myself as a conservative Republican who’s a dad of a transgender son who I love and support. That sets them off, because it doesn’t fit the narrative, which is, ‘everybody’s on the left doing this.’”\n\nBut to him, it proves the point: “It shows this is really an issue that transcends a political ideology, that there actually is an objective truth to it.”\n\nWhile Ashton says he disagrees with many of his father’s conservative beliefs and they didn’t vote for the same candidate, they’ve been brought closer by “answering the call to advocacy.”\n\nHe knows he’s safe at home and in his community, which is why he decided to stay in Ohio after considering moving to a bluer state with more laws protecting his rights.\n\nAshton said of his father: “Because he has had to repeatedly say it and declare it publicly that he loves me… I feel it in my heart more. I’m safe with him here.”",

        "source": "https://www.cnn.com/",
        "content": "Sidhpur, India CNN —\n\nThe dusty highway leading to Sidhpur, in western India’s Gujarat state, winds through arid landscapes past roadside eateries and herds of lumbering camel, offering little hint of what the historic town holds.\n\nIn the heart of Sidhpur lies a street lined with stately three- and four-story mansions, known as “havelis,” in a fading palette of rainbow pastel shades, from teal and baby pink to pistachio green. Known locally as Paris Galli, or Paris Street, it transports visitors to a European city with grand Neoclassical architecture and a harmonious melange of Art Deco, Baroque and hybrid Indian styles.\n\nSidhpur is less than three hours’ drive from Gujarat’s capital Ahmedabad, but it remains under the radar of travelers and architecture enthusiasts. On the day of my visit, the neighborhood around Paris Galli appeared largely deserted, except for occasional passersby in the distinctive colored hijabs and gold and white caps worn by the Dawoodi Bohras, a Shia Muslim sect that first settled in this part of western India in the 11th century.\n\nThe Bohras are a close-knit trading community that originated in Egypt and later traveled around North Africa, the Middle East and South Asia to trade in spices, gems and perfumes. The sect’s seat was later moved from Yemen to Sidhpur, where its followers showcased their prosperity and wealth by building hundreds of opulent residences in the first half of the 20th century. These housing clusters were called Bohrawads or Vohrawads, and the mansions’ owners tried to outdo one another with chandeliers, Belgian glass and antique furniture, or by hosting grand dinners.\n\nThe community’s close trading connections with Europe may have influenced its architectural sensibilities. The region’s maharaja at the time, Sayajirao Gaekwad III, was also known to be fond of European architecture. He laid out strict planning rules, inspired by Scottish urban planner Patrick Geddes (who lived in India between 1914 and 1924), that resulted in strikingly uniform streetscapes, according to Sidhpur-born architect Zoyab A. Kadi.\n\nThe narrow houses were built in rows and sometimes reach three or four stories high. Anil Dave/Alamy Stock Photo\n\n“The Bohras extended their help to other communities during a famine in the early 1900s, and (in return) the Maharaja of Baroda gifted them a tract of land, as they were facing a housing shortage,” he said. “It was on this land that they started building these magnificent edifices, which had to adhere to strict town planning rules.”\n\nFound mostly in Najampura district, where Paris Galli is located, the long, narrow mansions are made mainly of wood (the material’s flexibility is an advantage in earthquake-prone regions) in addition to plaster and brick. The designs feature gabled roofs, pilasters and columns, carved doors and ornate overhanging “jharokha” windows that protrude from the front of each mansion. The main living floor is located above street level over a basement; stepped plinths, or “otlas,” act like porches and were traditionally used as social spaces; whimsical monograms, featuring family initials or surnames in English, are often displayed on the buildings’ facades.\n\n“The courtyard houses, built in rows or sequence, exhibit rhythm with diversity,” said Ahmedabad-based conservation architect, Ashish Trambadia, over the phone. “While each house has a unique color scheme, unique stucco art and grill work; the precise alignment of plinths, roof lines and floor lines gave the streets a unique character.”\n\nThe buildings contain various elements of European architecture, including gabled roofs, pilasters and columns. Maniyarasan R.\n\nUnique design\n\nIndia-based photographer Sebastian Cortés documented the town and its people in his series “Sidhpur: Time Present Time Past.” The images present a certain melancholy, from the faded glory of the mansions’ interiors to the women pictured gazing out of windows as they carry out household chores.\n\n“I was inspired by the mercantile communities of India… who displayed their wealth most aesthetically,” said New York-born Cortés in a phone interview. “This was inverse colonialism: The Bohras traveled around the world to countries like Burma (Myanmar), Thailand, Yemen and Ethiopia, and brought back various influences and then blended it with their own customs and traditions, using local artisans to create magic.”\n\nKadi has also helped bring international attention to the houses by authoring three books about the town: “Sidhpur and Its Dawoodi Bohra Houses,” “The Vohrawaads of Sidhpur” and “The Birth and Death of a Style.”\n\nThe colorful homes feature elaborate window, door and facade details. Ashit Desai/Moment Unreleased RF/Getty Images\n\n“At casual glance, the streetscape looks European, but if you look closely there’s the Gujarati tradition of using wood as a building material, and the capitals (crowns of columns or pilasters) are neither Corinthian or Doric but hybrid — a product of various influences,” said Kadi, who now runs an architectural firm in Chennai. “Many of the houses were designed to give women privacy, as most of the men were abroad working hard and making money. (The homes are) also suited to the local weather, in terms of design and materials used.”\n\nThe houses’ names, like Zainab Mansion and Kagalwala Manor, often reference the people who once lived there. There are showstoppers, like the Zaveri house (also known as the House with 365 Windows) which is now stained black with grit, its grand pilasters and geometric facade carvings in dire need of restoration, and the Teen Khuniya (or Three-Cornered House), with its distinctive triangular layout.\n\nAccording to local resident and tour guide Insiya Bangalorewalla, the homes were typically divided into five linear sections: the “dehli” (a service area), the “chowk” (a central courtyard kitchen and bathroom, open to the sky for light and, today, ventilation fitted with grilles), the outer “pursaal” (a multipurpose room for living and dining), the inner “pursaal” (the coolest room, used as a bedroom) and the orda (the best room in the house, well-furnished and used by the head of the family).\n\nThe homes' interiors were often lavishly decorated Maniyarasan R.\n\n“From the street you can’t see into the house thanks to a veil called the ‘furtaal,’ which protected the privacy of the women,” added Bangalorewalla on a tour through Najampura.\n\nThe homes’ interiors were often a visual feast decorated with geometric tiles, friezes, Persian carpets, dark mahogany and rosewood furniture, painted Belgian mirrors, antique corner pieces, family memorabilia and a special marble recess meant for storing water (water has an important status in Islam, and is used to cleanse or purify the home).\n\n“Sidhpur’s architecture is very unique,” said Kadi, “as the buildings inspired by Western ideas and elements have been crafted by Hindu architects (but) are suited to an Islamic way of life.”\n\nDisappearing heritage\n\nOfficial town figures suggest that, in the 1970s, there were at least 1,400 of the mansions across Sidhpur. But after India gained independence from Britain in 1947, many of Sidhpur’s residents migrated overseas, or to larger Indian cities like Mumbai and Ahmedabad, leaving the houses’ upkeep to caretakers or relatives.\n\nMany of the houses now lie abandoned, locked up or awaiting restoration (or demolition). Maniyarasan R.\n\nToday, many are boarded up, lying forlorn and derelict or caught in legal tangles between former owners’ descendants; others have been demolished to make way for modern developments, with the antiques and timber sold off by owners. The official data suggests that fewer than 400 of Sidhpur’s havelis are currently inhabited.\n\nTo help conserve the disappearing mansions, Kadi, along with others from Sidhpur, co-founded the Sidhpur Heritage Collective in 2024. The group is working to document the town’s architecture, as well as holding workshops and guided tours.\n\n“Unfortunately, there are no heritage laws in India that prevent demolition of (privately owned) houses,” said Kadi. “We also have no funds or body helping us in this project. Even converting these houses into homestays and Airbnbs has not yet taken off.\n\n“(Sidhpur) has a lot to offer besides just these mansions, from a rich food culture to temples and mosques. I can only hope that we manage to save the town’s architecture before it’s destroyed forever. This needs public will and funding.”",

These are deliciously manifested in treats such as gumbo, jambalaya and beignets.\n\nThe No. 2 spot went to Bangkok, Thailand, with its glorious food scene covering everything from Michelin-starred fine dining such as the acclaimed restaurant Gaggan Anand to a multitude of markets with $3 street-food stars.\n\nAt No. 3, Medellín, Colombia, impressed Time Out’s readers with its affordability and cheap coffee. In South Africa’s Cape Town, at No. 4, locals love the coastal city’s diverse food offerings, particularly the seafood.\n\nMadrid’s flourishing food scene (at No. 5) is both “diverse” and “experimental,” say locals, and in recent years Mexico City (No. 6) has become a top destination for international foodies in the know.\n\nJollof rice and smoky suya fuel locals in the vibrant Nigerian city of Lagos (at No. 7). In Shanghai, China, at No. 8, thousands of years of food history have been perfected in today’s adventurous culinary scene.\n\nFrance is the birthplace of haute cuisine so it’s only fitting that the French capital is in the top 10 at No. 9.\n\nThe leaderboard is filled out by Jakarta at No. 10. CNN readers once voted rendang the most delicious food in the world, but it’s just one of the many lip-smacking dishes Indonesia has to offer.\n\nThese are the rest of the cities in the top 20: Marrakech, Morocco (No. 11). Lima, Peru (No. 12). Riyadh, Saudi Arabia (No. 13). Mumbai, India (No. 14). Abu Dhabi, UAE (No. 15). Cairo (No. 16). Porto, Portugal (No. 17). Montreal (No. 18). Naples, Italy (No. 19). San José, Costa Rica (No. 20).\n\nPaint the town green\n\nNo Irish city made it into Time Out’s top 20, but the country’s food and drink scene still has plenty to offer. As the world turns green this weekend ahead of St. Patrick’s Day on Monday, here are 26 Irish foods you should try, from spice bags to barmbrack.\n\nIreland’s most famous export is of course Guinness, but the creamy stout has been having such a surge of popularity in recent times that British pubs were hit by a supply crisis.\n\nSeveral countries outside of Ireland brew their own Guinness and the first to be established was the Lagos brewery in 1963. Here’s what makes Nigeria’s extra-strong, extra-malty version a unique local hero.\n\nFor a beverage the Irish love far more than stout, look no further than a nice cup of tea. Barry’s is generally regarded as the cuppa of choice, but Lyons and Punjana are more than acceptable.\n\nWhat’s non-negotiable is that it must be made using a kettle, never — heaven forfend — a microwave. Our partners at CNN Underscored, a products review and recommendations guide owned by CNN, have this guide to the best electric kettles of 2025.\n\nLa vie en rose\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Retired American woman moved to France and is never looking back 01:53 - Source: CNN Retired American woman moved to France and is never looking back 01:53\n\nA few years back, Texan Janice Deerwester decided she wanted more from life.

        "content": "A version of this story appeared in CNN’s What Matters newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here.\n\nCNN —\n\nSenate Democrats’ decision to allow Republicans to pass a spending bill will avert a short-term shutdown, but it will also give Republicans the power to grant President Donald Trump new leverage to control spending for the rest of the year.\n\nThe Democrats’ tactical retreat from this spending battle means the government will remain open and Trump can more easily carry on with the systemic changes and deep cuts he has done heretofore without the blessing of Congress.\n\nEntire divisions at agencies such as the Department of Education and NASA have already been laid off, along with the gutting of the government’s consumer protection arm, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.\n\nA large-scale “reduction in force” of federal workers is expected in the near future.\n\nAmericans are both deeply concerned and somewhat excited about the prospect of Trump’s cuts, whose potential breadth is not yet known.\n\nIn a CNN Poll conducted by SSRS and released this week, 22% of American adults thought Trump’s government cuts would help them and their families.\n\nAbout half, 51%, said the cuts would hurt them and their families; a slightly larger majority, 55%, said the cuts will hurt the economy. More than a quarter, 27%, said the cuts would neither help nor hurt their families.\n\nOf those who expect the cuts to impact them, a minority, 29%, said the cuts had already affected them or their families, but most, 71%, said the impacts would come in the future.\n\nThose who answered the poll explained in their own words what effects they expected, providing some insight into these answers.\n\nHow people think cuts will hurt\n\nEqual portions, 19%, of those who said the cuts will hurt them pointed to health care or to an effect on prices.\n\nThose worried about health insurance pointed to effects on Medicare, Medicaid or other insurance options.\n\nI am a physician and most of my patients use Medicaid for health care. If patients lose their Medicaid because of cuts, fewer people will be able to access health care and I may lose my job.\n\nTrump promised on the campaign trail that Medicaid and Social Security would not be affected by government cuts, but more recently, he and Musk have argued there is fraud, waste and abuse in the programs, suggesting they will try to change them.\n\nBoth parties will ultimately have to contend with the cost of Medicare and Social Security, both of which could be forced to reduce payments within a decade or so if they aren’t reformed.\n\nIt is true that Republicans in Congress are likely to seek cuts to Medicaid funding in a bill that simultaneously extends and expands tax cuts from the first Trump administration. There is a knock-on effect for government cuts. Foreign aid cuts caused layoffs not just of USAID workers, but of contractors in foreign countries.\n\nJohns Hopkins University announced Thursday it would lay off 2,000 workers because of cuts at USAID.\n\nAmericans also expressed a lot of fear about cuts to the National Institutes of Health, both from people who work in scientific research and those who support it.\n\nMy spouse and I both work in scientific research. The massive cuts to research funding will affect current and future employment for us both.\n\nMy husband is a scientific researcher — the cuts to the NIH and research in general will cause a trickle-down effect that will affect all areas of medical research and make us weaker on innovation.\n\nIn that vein, Dr. Craig Spencer, a Brown University School of Public Health professor, discusses the greater implications of Elon Musk’s DOGE cuts in the health sector. Watch.\n\nOther people are looking at how the federal government maintains parks.\n\nI hike and hunt in a national forest. Which I think will not be up kept as well as in the past. And as a parent I fear what will happen if/ when (Trump) guts the Department of Education. My father is (a) 100% disabled veteran and wondering what will happen to his care from the VA.\n\nWhile the Department of Veterans Affairs has promised that care will not be affected by cuts, the administration is intent on reducing the size of the VA workforce.\n\nAs for parks, there are already warnings that layoffs and a hiring freeze will impact the ability of parks to be maintained during the coming summer. In addition, cuts to the US Forest Service could affect the ability to respond to forest fires.\n\nBecause of tariffs, prices will increase, and if (Trump) changes Medicare then we’ll be choosing between medicine or food or bills. It’s scary.\n\nFood prices may indeed rise as a result of tariffs, in particular on Canada and Mexico. The rise in egg prices, on the other hand, is largely due to the outbreak of avian flu. A larger issue with Trump’s trade war could be how retaliatory tariffs in China and cuts to US foreign aid will affect American farmers, who rely on exports.\n\nHow people think cuts could help\n\nThe minority of Americans who expect to be helped by the cuts are looking primarily at two benefits. About a quarter of them expect taxes or reduced taxes to benefit them. A smaller portion are expecting inflation to be eased or prices to drop as a result of reduced government spending.\n\nSome saw the cuts as a symbol.\n\nHe has had a positive impact by showing us and the world that he will not stand for the corruption that had taken over our government.\n\nAnother person said the government spends on its own behalf, not for individual people, and while the cuts have not yet had an impact, this person is confident they will.\n\nLess spending on (the government’s) part, more money kept in my pocket. There will be respect once again for the ‘government for the people’ not (the government’s) gain.\n\nOne important upside of government cuts is that they could indeed restore faith in US systems among the portion of the population that feels the government is actively working against them, although there is a partisan element to faith in government. A person that trusts Trump’s administration might not trust a Democratic administration in the future.\n\nI think he will distribute credits to the taxpayers that were otherwise going to pad the pockets of lifetime bureaucrats.\n\nWhile there has been some preliminary talk of a “DOGE dividend,” a one-time payment to taxpayers to represent savings from Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency, the idea has not yet gained traction. Plus, since the US is in the midst of major deficit spending, any credit would still have to be borrowed. Trump does plan to cut taxes, but those cuts will likely give the most benefit to Americans who pay the most in taxes.\n\nTrump and Musk have so far focused on cutting foreign aid, non-defense domestic spending and the federal workforce, but those are not the largest elements of US spending. To really affect spending, they will have to tackle spending on defense, Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. Those will be much more difficult and controversial efforts if they come to pass.\n\nSome who approve of the cuts give Trump credit for things not necessarily related to the cuts.\n\nHouse prices falling, gas prices falling, border patrol in area, no tax on tips.\n\nCertainly, Trump has a made a show of stopping the influx of migrants, although that might be an example of more government rather than government cuts. Mortgage rates have dropped in recent weeks, perhaps a symptom of economic uncertainty. If inflation cools and the economy stalls, they could fall more. Gas prices have indeed fallen, 11% since Trump took office, although CNN’s Chris Isidore found that Trump’s energy policy has not yet had much of an opportunity to affect prices. The US was already producing more oil than any other country when he took office and production has not yet increased. Those prices are set by OPEC+ nations, which had already announced an increase in production.\n\nTrump’s promise to end taxes on tips has not yet been realized. Republicans in the House and Senate are working on bills to extend tax cuts from his first term that are expiring and they could include a removal of taxes on tips in those bills. But the final drafts have not yet been released, and tax cuts will either come with further government cuts or more deficit spending.\n\nOne person thinks the cuts will ultimately help, but adds that there needs to be balance.\n\nPotentially lower taxes by cutting federal spending but could also hurt if elimination goes too far and impacts departments/roles that played a more influential role within our family needs.\n\nIt’s a smart point since the impact of the cuts will have a lot to do with how they are perceived and whether Americans feel that they’ve gone too far.\n\nSome Americans are hoping for cuts to safety net programs. One person is frustrated about their neighbor, who is on some type of assistance.\n\nToo many people are on Medicaid that can work and (are) driving brand-new 40k vehicles. … Hopefully there will be a trickle-down effect with the elimination of fraud and waste.\n\nIt’s impossible to verify this respondent’s story about their neighbor, but they will probably like what’s being proposed in Congress, where Republicans are hoping to impose cuts on Medicaid programs and potentially impose new work requirements. On the other hand, expanding Medicaid was a major element of the Affordable Care Act and the main reason that law drove down the rate of those uninsured in the US.",

        "source": "https://www.cnn.com/",
        "content": "CNN —\n\nThe chaos at the Internal Revenue Service began almost immediately after the first envoy from the Department of Government Efficiency arrived last month at the agency’s Washington, DC, headquarters.\n\nWithin minutes of showing up, a twenty-something software engineer dispatched from DOGE began demanding access to the tax collection agency’s most protected internal databases – first the IT systems and then one containing the personal and financial data for millions of American taxpayers and another system housing IRS contracts.\n\nAnother DOGE staffer sought to shut down nearly all of IRS’s congressionally funded programs and initiatives planned for this fiscal year – many aimed at modernizing the agency and improving the tax filing process.\n\nAs DOGE has set up shop inside the IRS over the past month, the agency has fired thousands of workers and auditors and set out to shutter more than 110 taxpayer assistance offices across the country. Widespread layoffs are in the works, with plans to cut nearly 20% of all IRS employees by May 15.\n\nThe barnstorming, which has played out at multiple agencies, has thrown the IRS into turmoil at the height of tax season. While the business of processing returns and issuing refunds has been ongoing, sources say these DOGE actions could undermine the long-term operations of the IRS, which handles nearly all accounts receivable for the federal government.\n\nFormer Internal Revenue Service workers leave their office after being laid off in downtown Denver, Colorado, on Thursday, February 20. Hyoung Chang/Denver Post/Getty Images\n\nIn interviews with CNN, multiple current and former IRS officials, who spoke on the condition that they remain anonymous, described an atmosphere of intimidation, especially of career staffers.\n\n“They just randomly drop by people’s offices, demanding access to systems; they’re bullying us and there’s no discipline in what they are doing, which really worries me,” said one IRS employee.\n\n“It’s a clusterf***, and I can’t believe no one is stepping in to do anything,” said another top staffer who worked at the IRS.\n\n“We are paralyzed,” said a third IRS source.\n\nAnother current IRS employee, who works outside Washington and is a local union leader, said it’s now routine to see people crying in the office and managers going around apologizing for firings they had no decision in.\n\n“Morale is suffering,” the person said.\n\nNina Olson, who served from 2001 to 2019 as the independent National Taxpayer Advocate within the IRS, said the cuts were “basically gutting the agency” by hollowing out the ranks, putting the IRS’ future at risk.\n\n“You’ve got a lot of new blood getting fired, that’s supposed to be the future of the workforce,” Olson said, referring to the agency’s newly hired probationary employees. “Then you’ve got the most skilled people, at the height of their institutional knowledge, leaving through retirement.”\n\nOlson, who now runs the nonpartisan Center for Taxpayer Rights, criticized this “shotgun approach” to staff reductions and predicated, “none of this bodes well for the taxpayers.”\n\nIn response to CNN’s reporting, the White House press secretary said in a statement, “This story is based on anonymous sources and the fraudsters always scream the loudest. The vast majority of Americans support President Trump rooting out waste, fraud, and abuse.”\n\nA CNN/SSRS poll released last week found that 62% of Americans are worried that Trump’s cuts to the federal government will go too far and lead to important programs being shut down. Only 37% said they’re more worried that the cuts won’t go far enough to eliminate fraud and waste.\n\nRemaking the IRS\n\nSince Trump’s return, there have been a number of leadership changes at the IRS.\n\nThe Biden-appointed IRS commissioner, Danny Werfel, resigned on Inauguration Day. The acting commissioner who succeeded him retired four weeks later. The current leader, Melanie Krause has only been at the IRS for three-and-a-half years.\n\nTrump’s nominee to be the next full-time commissioner, former GOP congressman Billy Long, hasn’t been confirmed yet.\n\nTrump announced Long’s appointment in December. In a Truth Social post, Trump didn’t say anything about the fact that Werfel’s statutory five-year term – which is intended to give IRS commissioners some independence from the president – wasn’t set to expire until 2027.\n\nDuring the transition, Werfel reached out multiple times to incoming Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, seeking guidance on whether to resign or stay at the helm until Long was confirmed, to maintain stability amid tax season, according to a source familiar with the matter. Bessent never responded, the source said, and Werfel stepped down on January 20.\n\nIn this May 2024 photo, Biden-era Internal Revenue Service Commissioner Danny Werfel testifies before the House Appropriations Committee on Capitol Hill in Washington, DC. Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images/File\n\nAlong with reducing headcount, sources say that it appears that DOGE’s priority at the IRS has been around accessing its vast data systems.\n\nIn recent weeks, DOGE staffers have gained access to the IRS’ human resource system that houses personal information of all the agency’s employees, according to a source familiar with the matter.\n\nWhile the courts weigh whether to allow DOGE to have full access to IRS data systems, the effort to remake the tax collection agency is well underway.\n\nIt began in mid-February when senior IRS staff were told DOGE would be visiting their offices. They were given just a 15-minute heads up that Gavin Kliger, a 25-year-old software engineer, was on his way.\n\nWithin minutes of arriving, Kliger demanded access to the IRS’s “tax administration systems,” according to an IRS employee familiar with the situation.\n\nIn a Bloomberg op-ed published Friday, Werfel, the former IRS commissioner, said DOGE should not have access to the sensitive data. He said it was akin the CEO of a bank walking into a branch and demanding access to all of the customers’ safe-deposit boxes.\n\nOnly a select group of IRS employees have access to the systems that house taxpayers’ sensitive financial data. Career employees informed Kliger that he could not access the agency’s IT system without undergoing extensive background checks to ensure he would not pose an insider threat.\n\nTwo weeks later, Kliger was joined at IRS by Sam Corcos, a 36-year-old startup entrepreneur, who co-founded a company that helps people customize their diet to boost their metabolism.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Taxpayer advocate on DOGE access to IRS data 05:00 - Source: CNN Taxpayer advocate on DOGE access to IRS data 05:00\n\nAs soon as Corcos got there, one IRS employee told CNN, he pushed to a halt nearly all the agency’s congressionally funded programs and initiatives it was planning for fiscal year and calendar year 2025. The employee told CNN Corcos was making the demand without “fully understanding how the agency works within the federal government.”\n\n“They’ll come in and say we’re going to delete that initiative– ‘delete’ is one of their favorite terms,” said the IRS employee. “So, we are scrambling to figure out ‘Does Sam have that authority? Does Gavin have that authority? Did Treasury give them that authority?’”\n\nCorcos also pushed for a fast-tracked background check which would have required federal employees to work on the weekend so he could quickly gain access to the IRS IT system.\n\nBy the following Monday, the agency’s top HR officer was placed on administrative leave and told she was dismissed for being insubordinate after Kliger’s demand for an expedited background check for his DOGE partner had not been fulfilled over the weekend, sources said.\n\nUsing tax data to find immigrants\n\nLike all of DOGE’s actions, the moves at IRS are part of the Trump administration’s broader efforts to purportedly root out fraud and abuse. But two IRS employees who spoke to CNN said that some of the actions taken by DOGE inside IRS appear to be aimed at finding ways to use the agency’s protected data to find undocumented immigrants.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security circulated a draft memo to IRS that represented a sweeping request for information about suspected undocumented immigrants, including the home addresses of several hundred thousand individuals who paid federal taxes based on their individual taxpayer identification numbers, according to a source with direct knowledge of the document.\n\nThe memo also proposed IRS detail a dedicated group of several dozen senior IRS auditors to launch investigations into companies suspected of hiring undocumented immigrants.\n\nPrivacy experts say that would be a violation of the strict disclosure laws that the IRS operates under that prohibits the release of tax information by an IRS employee.\n\nTwo immigrant-rights groups in Chicago sued the Treasury Department and IRS earlier this month and asked a judge to block the agency from sharing taxpayers’ identifying information with US Immigration and Customs Enforcement or DHS, as Trump pushes for more deportations.\n\nThe groups claimed federal law “forbids” IRS from giving this data to immigration authorities, because ICE and DHS aren’t listed as exceptions to the confidentiality rules in the tax code.\n\nIf that does happen, lawyers for the groups wrote in filings that it would subject their members “to harm in the form of the arrest, detention, or other deprivations of liberty associated with the Trump Administration’s stated intention to engage in mass actions against immigrants.”\n\nThe case is still pending in DC federal court, and the judge hasn’t issued any rulings yet.\n\nCarts containing documents sit organized at the IRS Processing Facility on September 6, 2024 in Austin, Texas. Brandon Bell/Getty Images\n\nThough the IRS’s automated tax return systems continue to run smoothly, taxpayers in the long term may eventually experience the paralyzing effects of DOGE. Customer service wait times will likely increase as the agency loses staff. The employees CNN spoke with also expect delays with paper-based returns.\n\nFunding from the Biden-era Inflation Reduction Act allowed the IRS to staff up to improve taxpayers’ customer service experience, including thousands of new call center representatives.\n\nData released by the IRS shows that wait times for customer service phone calls improved significantly from an average of 28 minutes during tax season in 2022, before the landmark legislation was passed, to four minutes in 2023, and three minutes last year.\n\n“In many cases those long wait times ended with a courtesy disconnect,” the employee said. “They just hung up on you, so we are going back to those days.”\n\nCNN’s Phil Mattingly, Jeanne Sahadi and Priscilla Alvarez contributed to this report.",

        "source": "https://www.cnn.com/",
        "content": "Rome CNN —\n\nPope Francis has approved a new three-year reform process for the Catholic Church, sending a strong signal he plans to continue in the post despite spending a month in hospital battling pneumonia.\n\nThe Vatican announced on Saturday that the 88-year-old pope had signed off on the reform plans from Rome’s Gemelli hospital earlier in the week. Francis has been hospitalized since February 14, his longest stay since his election as pope 12 years ago.\n\nReforms on the table include how to give greater roles to women in the Catholic Church, including ordaining them as deacons, and the greater inclusion of laity in governance and decision making.\n\nThe reforms have been examined through a structure called the Synod of Bishops, which has been the primary vehicle through which the pope has implemented his pastoral agenda during his papacy. In recent years he’s sought to involve Catholics from across the globe in the renewal process.\n\nIn October 2023 and 2024 two Vatican assemblies – which for the first time included female voting members – each met for almost a month of discussions and deliberation with a final document agreed by the pope.\n\nThat document left open the question of ordaining women deacons, who carry out all the functions of a priest bar celebrating Mass and hearing confessions. It also insisted that women be given all the opportunities that church law provides to act as leaders.\n\nFrancis’ latest decision extends the process by another three years and will culminate in an “ecclesial assembly” in the Vatican in October 2028. Unlike a synod of bishops, this will be a unique gathering of bishops, clergy, monks, friars, nuns and lay men and women.\n\nBy that stage Francis would be 91, so his move could mean that a conclave takes place while this reform initiative is ongoing. In that scenario, whoever is chosen as the next pope would be tasked with continuing the reform process Francis has started.\n\nMeanwhile, the pope’s decision is also a response to those bishops and other senior leaders who have been quietly resisting the Argentine pontiff’s reform plans.\n\nCardinal Mario Grech, who leads the Holy See’s synod office, said the latest plans, which will include churches at the local level, “offer dioceses that have invested less in the synodal path an opportunity to recover the steps not yet taken and to form their own synodal teams.”\n\nSince his hospitalization, the pope has signaled he’s still governing the Catholic Church, signing documents from the Gemelli hospital, meeting two of his most senior aides and appointing bishops.\n\nOn Saturday, the Vatican said that Francis is in stable condition and has made “gradual improvements” but still requires treatment at the hospital. The need for non-invasive mechanical ventilation — which Francis has been receiving at night — has reduced and he is expected to recover, according to the Vatican.\n\nNevertheless, Francis’ extended period hospital has been a time of high anxiety for the Vatican. At 30 days, it is his longest hospitalization, although is still behind John Paul II’s 55 days at the Gemelli.",

        "content": "CNN —\n\nThe man last known to be seen with a University of Pittsburgh student before she vanished from a beach in the Dominican Republic gave more details to local prosecutors about the last time he saw her, Dominican news station Noticias SIN reported.\n\nSudiksha Konanki, 20, disappeared from the beach of the Riu República Hotel in the early hours of March 6, sparking a frantic search involving authorities from the Dominican Republic, the United States and India, where Konanki was born.\n\nThe man who was with her at the beach, Joshua Steven Riibe, told prosecutors he and Konanki were hit by an intense wave and were swept out to sea when the water returned, according to Noticias SIN. Riibe, a 22-year-old American, is not considered a suspect in the case and has not been accused of wrongdoing.\n\nDominican Republic attorney general Yeni Berenice Reynoso interviewed Riibe Saturday as part of the investigation into Konanki’s disappearance, according to a source with firsthand knowledge of the interview. CNN has contacted Riibe’s family attorney for comment.\n\nDuring his fourth interview with prosecutors on Wednesday, Riibe described a harrowing attempt to save Konanki after they were jostled by the wave and she got tired of swimming.\n\n“It took me a long time to get her out. It was difficult,” Riibe said, according to Noticias SIN. He said he was trained as a lifeguard, but worked at pools, not at the beach.\n\n“I was trying to get her to breathe the whole time. That didn’t allow me to breathe all the time, and I swallowed a lot of water. I could have lost consciousness several times. When I finally reached the ground on the beach, I held her in front of me.”\n\nHe said he last saw Konanki when she was walking in knee-deep water.\n\n“The last time I saw her, I asked if she was OK. I didn’t hear her answer because I started vomiting up all the seawater I had swallowed.”\n\n“After vomiting, I looked around, and I didn’t see anyone. I thought she had grabbed her things and left,” Riibe said.\n\n“I felt very sick and tired. I lay down on a beach chair and fell asleep because I couldn’t go far.”\n\nThe photo shows Joshua Riibe, the last known person to see US college student Sudiksha Konanki in Punta Cana, before she was reported missing on March 6. From Southeast Technical College\n\nThe sun and biting mosquitoes woke Riibe up, he said, and he went to his friend’s room to get his phone and then went to his room to sleep.\n\n“I was sleeping in the room and my friend asked me if I had seen her; I told him no, I thought she had gone to her room,” Riibe said. His friend told him Konanki never returned to her room, which Riibe said “surprised” him.\n\nWhen asked if he saw Konanki after that night on the beach, Riibe said, “After I saw her walk away while she was walking in the water, I never saw her again.”\n\n﻿Konanki’s sarong-style cover-up was found on a lounge chair on the beach, but there were no signs of violence, a source familiar with the investigation previously told CNN. Photos of the light-colored sarong and flip-flops on the lounge chair were obtained by Dominican news station Noticias SIN on Saturday.\n\nKonanki's sarong, which was discovered on a lounge chair on the beach after her disappearance, is seen in a photo obtained by Dominican news station Noticias S.I.N. Noticias S.I.N.\n\nRiibe declined to answer some of the prosecutor’s questions, according to the transcript obtained by Noticias SIN. CNN has seen a copy of the transcript.\n\nDetectives with the sheriff’s office in Loudoun County, Virginia, where Konanki’s family lives, conducted an extensive interview with Riibe on Thursday afternoon with his father and attorney present, Loudoun County Sheriff’s Office spokesperson Thomas Julia told CNN.\n\nThe detectives will be returning to the US on Friday, Julia said.\n\nSince the incident, Riibe, who was in the Dominican Republic on spring break vacation with a classmate, said he has only been in his room being interviewed.\n\nRiibe is a senior at St. Cloud State University in Minnesota and is majoring in land surveying and mapping sciences, a university spokesperson told CNN. He is from Rock Rapids, Iowa.\n\nHis parents, Albert and Tina Riibe, expressed their sorrow for Konanki’s family. “We wish to contribute to the search efforts and understand the anguish and uncertainty they are going through,” they said in a statement obtained by CNN.\n\nRiibe has been cooperating with law enforcement, but was detained “under irregular conditions” and questioned without official translators or legal counsel until March 12, his parents said.\n\nCNN reached out to prosecutors regarding allegations that Riibe was interrogated without a translator or lawyer. Prosecutors said they are not commenting at this time.\n\nRiibe has remained under police surveillance in his hotel room and taken to the police station for interrogation multiple times, which which compelled the family to retain a lawyer “to initiate legal actions ensuring his safety and the protection of his rights,” his parents said.\n\nHis parents described Riibe as “a beloved son, brother, and friend, known for his kind nature, sense of humor, and commitment to his community.”\n\n“Our only interest is that due process be respected and that actions be taken with the fairness that the situation requires,” Albert and Tina Riibe said. “We share the hope that Sudiksha will be found as soon as possible.”\n\nRiibe’s aunt, Theresa Riibe, asked for privacy in a statement to CNN Friday.\n\n“Our family is going through a very difficult time right now, and we’re experiencing a lot of sadness and pain,” the statement said. “We kindly ask for privacy as we navigate this challenging moment together.”\n\nThe moments before Konanki disappeared\n\nRiibe said he first met Konanki in the hotel when he and his friend introduced themselves to Konanki’s group.\n\nKonanki was at the resort with five other female students from the University of Pittsburgh, according to the sheriff’s office in Loudoun County.\n\nThe two friend groups went to the bar together where they drank until “someone suggested we go to the beach,” Riibe said in his interview. Two of the females stayed behind.\n\nKonanki was last seen on surveillance camera with seven other people entering the beach at the Riu República Hotel in Punta Cana after 4:15 a.m. March 6, the Dominican Republic National Police said in a statement.\n\nBefore heading to the beach, surveillance footage shows the group of Americans – Konanki, five other women and two men – had been drinking in the hotel’s lobby around 3 a.m., a source with the Dominican Republic National Police told CNN.\n\nAround 4:55 a.m. Thursday, surveillance cameras captured five women and one man leaving the beach, while Konanki is believed to have stayed behind with the other young man, two sources close to the investigation told CNN.\n\nSurveillance video shows the man leaving the beach area at 8:55 a.m., the two sources close to the investigation said, with no sign of Konanki.\n\nWhen Konanki didn’t return to her room, her companions initially searched for her before notifying authorities, according to the law enforcement source. The group then reported her missing to the hotel staff around 4 p.m. Thursday, the Riu hotel chain said in a statement.\n\nShe had gone to Punta Cana for spring break, her father, Subbarayudu Konanki, said. “My daughter is a very nice girl,” he said. “She’s ambitious. She wanted to pursue a career in medicine.”\n\nKonanki’s father wants local authorities “to also investigate other possibilities including whether this is a case of kidnapping or human trafficking,” he told CNN on Sunday from Punta Cana. “We don’t think she would be able to survive for more than three days in the water and I think something else might’ve happened to her.”\n\nThe sheriff’s office in in Loudoun County, Virginia, also urged caution around “public speculation” about Konanki’s disappearance, according to a Monday news release.\n\n“There has been considerable public speculation about what may have happened to Konanki and who may be involved,” the sheriff’s office said. “We caution anyone from drawing any unsubstantiated conclusions and are committed to ensuring that a thorough investigation is conducted before any conclusions are reached.”\n\nCNN’s Lex Harvey, Caroll Alvarado, Alaa Elassar and Jillian Sykes contributed to this report.",

        "source": "https://www.cnn.com/",
        "content": "CNN —\n\nA federal judge temporarily blocked the Trump administration’s ability to use a sweeping wartime authority to quickly deport some migrants whom the US has accused of being affiliated with the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua.\n\nThe judge also ordered any planes in the air carrying some of those migrants to turn back to the US.\n\nEarlier Saturday, the Trump administration invoked the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, which gives the president tremendous authority to target and remove undocumented immigrants, to speed up the deportations of migrants. The law is designed to be invoked if the US is at war with another country, or a foreign nation has invaded the US or threatened to do so.\n\nUS District Judge James Boasberg had blocked the administration from deporting five individuals who challenged President Donald Trump’s use of the act. Following a hastily scheduled hearing hours later, Boasberg broadened his temporary block on the administration, granting a request from the plaintiffs’ lawyers to certify a provisional class that covers all noncitizens in US custody who would be subject to Trump’s proclamation.\n\nBoasberg, who serves as the chief judge of the federal trial-level court in Washington, DC, agreed that those individuals’ deportations should also be temporarily blocked while the legal challenge proceeds.\n\n“Particularly given the plaintiffs’ information, unrebutted by the government, that flights are actively departing and planning to depart, I do not believe that I’m able to wait any longer,” Boasberg continued. “Any plane containing these folks that is going to take off or is in the air needs to be returned to the United States.”\n\nThe judge said the temporary restraining order will remain in effect for 14 days “or until further order of the court.” He set another hearing in the case for later this month.\n\n“I think there’s clearly irreparable harm here given these folks will be deported,” Boasberg said. “A brief delay in their removal does not cause the government any harm.”\n\nIn a presidential proclamation, released earlier Saturday, the White House cited its designation of Tren de Aragua as a foreign terrorist organization, saying many of them have “unlawfully infiltrated the United States and are conducting irregular warfare and undertaking hostile actions against the United States.”\n\nThe proclamation called for all those subject to the measure to be immediately arrested, detained, and removed.\n\nThe Alien Enemies Act has been invoked three times in US history – all during war – according to the Brennan Center. During World Wars I and II, it was used to justify detentions and expulsions of German, Austro-Hungarian, Italian and Japanese immigrants. The law played a role in the infamous US policy of Japanese internment during World War II, according to the non-partisan law and policy institute.\n\nThe federal judge’s initial Saturday ruling came after a request to the judge from the American Civil Liberties Union and Democracy Forward hours before the order — the groups argued there may not be enough time to intervene after Trump issued it.\n\nThe ACLU argued in its filing that the gang has not engaged in an invasion “because criminal activity does not meet the longstanding definitions of those statutory requirements.”\n\nThe Department of Justice quickly appealed the judge’s temporary restraining order to the DC Circuit Court of Appeals.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional details.\n\nCNN’s Devan Cole and Shania Shelton contributed to this report.",

        "content": "CNN —\n\nBrenda Song is a devoted partner willing to go the extra mile in teaching her man how to adult.\n\nThe “Suite Life of Zack & Cody” star visited the “Jennifer Hudson Show” on Friday, where she talked about her life with Macaulay Culkin, who she identified as “a very unique human, being the most famous child actor in the world” who didn’t know how to do laundry.\n\n“He lived and grew up in hotels,” Song, herself a child actor who starred on the Disney Channel, explained about the “Home Alone” star, who is her fiancé. “He had just never really done laundry. And I was shooketh. I’ve been doing laundry since I was a baby, I feel like.”\n\nShe went on to explain how in addition to guiding Culkin in the ways of how to properly launder clothes, she also tried teaching him how to drive.\n\n“I took him out to drive in our neighborhood. I was terrified,” she said. “I’m like, ‘This 44-year-old man driving for the first time?’ I was like, ‘Nope! I got to hire someone to do that.’”\n\nEarlier in their chat, Hudson informed Song that “Home Alone” is her absolute most favorite movie, and asked her what it’s like watching the Christmas classic with Kevin McCallister himself.\n\nSong explained how when the pair started dating almost eight years ago, she wanted to continue her tradition of watching the movie like she did every time the holidays came around.\n\n“He hadn’t seen the movie in like a decade, and I forced him. He didn’t want to watch it. And I was like, ‘We have to!’” Song said. “So, we started watching it and then he started telling me all the behind-the-scenes stories and I was like, ‘Stop! You’re ruining it for me! You’re ruining it!’”\n\nIt seems like that “Home Alone” Christmas magic doesn’t quite work when you’re sitting next to adult Kevin.",

        "content": "CNN —\n\nIt was roughly 7 a.m. on Thursday when Danny Walker, in a restroom of the TPC Sawgrass locker rooms, felt his phone begin to buzz.\n\nThe call itself lasted a little more than a few minutes, but its impact for the PGA Tour rookie has already been nothing short of life-changing – and could get even better.\n\nA last minute withdrawal from former world No. 1 Jason Day saw Walker parachuted into The Players Championship, where the Florida native has since proceeded to outperform a multitude of the game’s biggest stars.\n\nListed as first alternate for the 51st edition of the PGA Tour’s flagship event, the 29-year-old had made the short trip from his home in Jacksonville to Ponte Vedra Beach knowing that he’d be in the field only if a player pulled out.\n\nHaving watched the action from behind the ropes last year, childhood dreams of a tournament debut looked set to be delayed by at least another 12 months when the call he never anticipated informed Walker that 2015 PGA Championship winner Day had withdrawn due to illness.\n\nThe news was the type of surprise that necessitated a few moments of solitude.\n\n“It meant the world to me,” Walker told reporters Thursday. “Wanted to play in this event since I was a little kid, especially living here locally … I couldn’t have been more excited.\n\n“I went and sat in my car for a few minutes afterwards and just kind of let it hit me a little bit, maybe let a tear out … I tried to let the emotion out early so then I can relax and go play.”\n\nWalker is enjoying a dream week at TPC Sawgrass. Richard Heathcote/Getty Images\n\nThe bombshells didn’t stop there.\n\nJoining world No. 284 Walker for his 8:46 a.m. tee time were a pair of major champions: Jordan Spieth and Wyndham Clark.\n\nIt was esteemed company for a golfer who only last year earned his first PGA Tour card with a 28th place finish on the Korn Ferry Tour, a developmental tour for the top circuit.\n\nYet Walker showed no hint of intimidation in just his 19th career round of PGA Tour golf, birdieing the Stadium Course’s iconic 17th par three en route to carding an opening one-over 73 – just one stroke higher than 2023 US Open champion Clark.\n\nEven so, it left the University of Virginia alumni with work to do to make it to the weekend. That goal looked to be within touching distance as six birdies saw Walker arrive at the 17th tee on Friday at four-under par for the second round, only for two closing bogeys to bring on an anxious wait to see if one-under par overall would be enough to squeeze through.\n\nThe cut line settled at one-under exactly, and Walker – once again – was in The Players by the skin of his teeth.\n\nAmerican trio Clark (left), Spieth (center) and Walker (right) walk the tenth fairway during the first round. Jared C. Tilton/Getty Images\n\n‘It was a little surreal’\n\nWith a host of big stars absent – from major winners Matt Fitzpatrick and Brian Harman to established PGA Tour winners Viktor Hovland and Max Homa – Walker headed out for the third round’s earliest tee time on Saturday, where 2019 Open champion Shane Lowry awaited as his playing partner.\n\n“It was a little surreal,” Walker told reporters Saturday. “I had never met any of those guys, so it was nice just to meet them and get that out of the way. Like, ‘Okay, now we can go play golf.’\n\nThe first hole or so, I was pretty nervous and then was able to find some rhythm after that.”\n\nRhythm was an understatement. While Lowry labored to a frustrating two-over 74, Walker sailed around a windy TPC Sawgrass with a bogey-free six-under 66 to return to the clubhouse inside the top-10 – four shots behind second round leaders Min Woo Lee and Akshay Bhatia before the duo headed out Saturday.\n\n“It was just a really good ball-striking day where I was hitting it solid,” said Walker, adding that he had played the course close to 100 times since moving to Jacksonville in 2019.\n\n“I was hitting my start lines, that was the key.”\n\nLee has outlasted some of the game's biggest names. Ben Jared/PGA Tour/Getty Images\n\nStaying inside the top-10 would lead to an unprecedented payday for Walker, who took a job as a waiter at restaurant chain Bahama Breeze around early 2022 before deciding to return to golf, according to his PGA Tour bio.\n\nA 10th place finish (with no ties) at this year’s Players Championship would be rewarded with a $681,250 slice of a $25 million prize purse – just shy of the $684,667 Walker has accumulated across 97 events since turning professional in 2018.\n\nAlmost $180,000 of those total earnings have come from five PGA Tour starts in 2025, mostly from a tied-13th finish at the Mexico Open in February, which paid out approximately $137,000.\n\nOn Saturday evening though, Walker had more important plans than imagining how he will spend any potential winnings.\n\n“Probably take a nap, or try to,” he said. “I didn’t get a lot of sleep last night, so see if I can make up for that.”",

        "source": "https://www.cnn.com/",
        "content": "CNN —\n\nPresident Volodymyr Zelensky said that Ukrainian troops have not been encircled by Russian forces in Kursk region, accusing Russian leader Vladimir Putin of “lying” about the situation on the ground.\n\nUkraine launched its shock incursion into Kursk in August, swiftly capturing territory in what was the first ground invasion of Russia by a foreign power since World War II. The campaign aimed to divert Moscow’s resources from the front lines in the east, and to capture land that could potentially be swapped for Russian-occupied Ukrainian territory.\n\nAlthough Kyiv is now on the back foot in Kursk, Zelensky and military analysts have questioned Putin’s claims – echoed by US President Donald Trump – that Russian forces have surrounded Ukraine’s soldiers.\n\nPutin claimed on Thursday that Russian forces had “isolated” Ukraine’s troops in Kursk and that it was “impossible” for them to escape even in small groups of two or three soldiers.\n\n“There will only be two options: surrender or die,” Putin said.\n\nA day later, Trump appeared to amplify Putin’s claims after what he called a “very good and productive” discussion with the Russian president.\n\n“At this very moment, thousands of Ukrainian troops are completely surrounded by the Russian military, and in a very bad and vulnerable position,” Trump said in a post on TruthSocial on Friday, claiming he had asked Putin to spare their lives to avert “a horrible massacre, one not seen since World War II.”\n\nAlthough the US president did not refer specifically to Kursk, Putin later told Russia’s security council that he had “noted” Trump’s appeal to save Ukrainian lives in the region.\n\nA statue of Lenin stands in front of a damaged building in Sudzha in August 2024. Efrem Lukatsky/AP/File\n\nBut Ukrainian officials and independent analysts have disputed Putin and Trump’s claims.\n\nThe Institute for the Study of War, a US-based conflict monitor, said Friday that it has “observed no geolocated evidence to indicate that Russian forces have encircled a significant number of Ukrainian forces” in Kursk or anywhere else along the frontline in Ukraine.\n\nUkraine’s military said that Russia was lying to shape perception of events on the ground.\n\n“Reports of the alleged ‘encirclement’ of Ukrainian units by the enemy in the Kursk region are false and fabricated by the Russians for political manipulation and to exert pressure on Ukraine and its partners,” the military said.\n\n“There is no threat of encirclement of our units,” it said, adding that its units in Kursk have “successfully regrouped” after Russia’s offensives and “withdrawn to more advantageous defensive positions.”\n\nIn an update Saturday, Zelensky said he had been briefed by Ukraine’s commander in chief, Oleksandr Syrskyi, and also stressed that Ukraine’s troops have not been encircled.\n\n“The units are carrying out their tasks exactly as required” and are continuing to repel Russian and North Korean troops, Zelensky said.\n\nAlthough Russian military bloggers have said that Ukraine is losing territory in Kursk, some also disputed the reports that Moscow has “encircled” Kyiv’s forces.\n\nThe ISW suggested that Putin was making dubious claims about Ukrainian troops in Kursk region in order to “distract” from his prevarication over the US-backed ceasefire proposal.\n\nKyiv agreed to the proposal during talks with US officials in Saudi Arabia on Tuesday, while Putin gave a more ambiguous response, first saying “we agree with the proposal” before claiming the deal “wasn’t complete.”\n\n“Putin is attempting to present himself as a reasonable and merciful leader whom President Trump can engage with and to generate a new narrative to distract from” Russia’s refusal to agree to the ceasefire proposal, the ISW wrote.\n\nFew dispute, however, that Ukraine is retreating in Kursk. This week, Moscow said that Russian forces had recaptured Sudzha, the largest town once occupied by Ukraine, further weakening Kyiv’s primary bargaining chip in potential negotiations with Russia.\n\nOn Saturday, Russia’s Defense Ministry posted a video from Sudzha, geolocated by CNN, showing the city after it was “liberated” by Russian troops. The video shows residential homes lying in ruins, roads scattered with debris and the bodies of soldiers killed in combat.",

        "content": "President Donald Trump expanded his crackdown on Democratic-tied law firms Friday with an executive order suspending security clearances for lawyers and staff at the New York law firm Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison. The order also imposes restrictions on their access to federal buildings and officials.\n\nThe order says it aims to sever federal ties with a number of law firms “to address some of the significant risks and egregious conduct associated with lawfirms,” claiming that Paul, Weiss “may have engaged in activities that make our communities less safe, increase burdens on local businesses, limit constitutional freedoms, and degrade the quality of American elections.”\n\nIt directs authorities to suspend the security clearances of people at the firm “pending a review of whether such clearances are consistent with the national interest,” and mandates federal agencies to review and terminate their contracts with Paul, Weiss and companies doing business with it. Government agencies are also required to disclose any business they have with the firm “and whether that business is related to the subject of the Government contract.”\n\nThe order also directs the heads of agencies to provide guidance limiting the access of Paul, Weiss employees to government buildings and limiting government employees from engaging with them when it “would threaten the national security of or otherwise be inconsistent with the interests of the United States.”\n\nThe New York law firm, whose security clearances were suspended under this executive order, has connections to prominent Democrats whom Trump has criticized for their involvement in investigations into his actions and conduct.\n\nOther firms targeted: It joins a string of firms to face action by Trump. So far, the president has targeted employees at Perkins Coie and Covington & Burling, both of which he accused of conspiring against him in elections.\n\nFirm’s response: A spokesperson for Paul, Weiss said the executive order focuses on the activities of Mark Pomerantz, who is a former senior prosecutor on the Manhattan district attorney’s team investigating Trump, and his organization’s business dealings. Pomerantz “retired from the firm in 2012 and went on to work at the District Attorney’s office nearly a decade later. Mr. Pomerantz has not been affiliated with the firm for years,” the spokesperson told CNN in a statement.\n\nTrump directly criticized Pomerantz during a speech at the Justice Department on Friday.",

        "source": "https://www.cnn.com/",
        "content": "CNN —\n\nIt’s 1962. Cold War tensions bristle between Washington and Moscow. Forced to enlist by the United States military, a young physician reluctantly cuts short his medical residency at New York’s Bellevue Hospital and ships out to a remote corner of Greenland.\n\nHis orders? To serve as camp doctor at what he was told was a polar research station dug about 26.2 feet (8 meters) beneath the surface of Greenland’s ice sheet.\n\nUncle Sam “sent me to sit under the ice cap 800 miles (about 1,300 kilometers) from the North Pole,” recalled Dr. Robert Weiss, who was then 26 and is now the Donald Guthrie Professor of Urology at Yale University.\n\nIn fact, Camp Century, as Weiss’ icy home was known, formed part of a top-secret attempt by the US to hide launch sites for missiles in the Arctic, which the military viewed as a strategic location closer to Russia.\n\nWeiss, who said he was unaware of the Pentagon’s ambitious plans until information was declassified in the mid-1990s, has vivid memories of two formative tours of duty at Camp Century in 1962 and 1963. He spent just short of a year there in total, living in a nuclear-powered city in the ice for months at a time.\n\nDr. Robert Weiss is seen outside the dispensary at Camp Century during his time there. Robert M. Weiss\n\nWhile the camp’s Cold War importance was fleeting — the US military abandoned Camp Century in the late 1960s after less than a decade in operation — the cutting-edge scientific work conducted there, in fields such as geophysics and paleoclimatology, has had enduring impacts. And the research station’s story isn’t over yet.\n\nWinter snowfall still outpaces summer melt at Camp Century, an experiment in its own right that now lies buried at least 98.4 feet (30 meters) below the surface. However, should that climate-driven dynamic flip, some potentially harmful remnants of the site could emerge, posing an environmental hazard that authorities haven’t grappled with, according to several studies conducted over the past decade.\n\nOnly a few firsthand accounts of living at Camp Century have been published. Weiss said he felt compelled to share his memories after friends passed along a blog post published in November that included stunning new imagery of the camp taken by NASA scientists as they conducted an aerial survey of Greenland’s ice sheet. Captured with the help of sophisticated radar mapping technology, the overhead view reveals the specter of structures submerged within the ice and a life only a few like Weiss could intimately describe.\n\nCamp Century was a Cold War Arctic research base built by the US military.\n\nA ‘city under the ice’\n\nBuilding a “city under the ice,” as Camp Century has been called, was an unprecedented feat of engineering. Polar research stations today are typically built on top of the ice rather than hollowed out underneath.\n\nHeavy-duty machines with rotating shovels burrowed into the snow, creating a network of some two dozen tunnels. Prefabricated buildings erected in the underground caverns housed sleeping quarters, latrines, laboratories, a mess hall, laundry and gym. A nuclear reactor, transported slowly for 138 miles (222 kilometers) across the ice sheet and installed beneath the surface, powered the base.\n\nA clip from a US Department of Defense documentary released in 1964 shows the construction of Camp Century in 1959, revealing what was a massive logistical operation in a remote part of Greenland. Department of Defense\n\nLiving in an ice sheet was not as harsh, or as onerous, as Weiss had initially feared. Inside the huts, it was warm and dry. Since most of Camp Century’s population of nearly 200 men was between the ages of 20 and 45, medical emergencies demanding his attention were rare. Weiss spent his free time studying medical textbooks, playing chess and bridge, and drinking 10-cent martinis. The food, he said, was “outstanding.”\n\nLiving conditions inside Camp Century, seen here in the 1964 documentary, were surprisingly comfortable, Weiss said. Department of Defense\n\n“Living conditions were typically good (even though) you were in, you were under the snow. There was a big tunnel you could drive a truck into it, into the campus, and it was a long tunnel,” Weiss recalled.\n\nWater — the camp needed about 8,000 gallons (some 30,000 liters) a day — came from a well dug in the ice with a drill that produced hot steam. Similarly, sewage was pumped down into a hole in the ice sheet.\n\nShortly after it became operational in 1960, the nuclear reactor was shut down as radiation in parts of the camp rose to unacceptable levels. Lead was shipped in to better protect the reactor’s components. Officials had ironed out those problems by the time Weiss arrived, and he didn’t remember being fazed about living close to a nuclear reactor.\n\n(Clockwise from top left) A ham radio operator is seen at Camp Century. Weiss remembers sitting for hours with the radio operator in attempts to speak to family. Communication was dependent on weather conditions and time of day. The X-ray table is seen at the dispensary, where Weiss worked. Weiss exits one of Camp Century's escape hatches. A side tunnel is seen within the research base. Robert M. Weiss\n\n“We were told that one of the main aims of Camp Century was to prove that an isolated installation could (be) safely and efficiently powered by nuclear energy. We thought it was safe, and no one told us otherwise,” he said.\n\nWeiss rarely had cause to go the windswept surface. “I could stay in the hole, the trench, for weeks and never come out,” he said. “I had no reason to be up there. But I did sometimes go up there with other officers to see what was going on. I had a camera and took many pictures.”\n\nEscape hatches lead directly up to the surface of the ice sheet. Department of Defense\n\nOfficers could spend up to six months at a time at the research station, while enlisted men could only spend four months. Despite the cocktails and nightly movies that Weiss vetted as the camp’s designated film censor, he said isolation took a psychological toll on some men. A popular joke among the troops was that “there was a pretty girl hiding behind every tree.” According to the 2021 book “Camp Century: The Untold Story of America’s Secret Arctic Military Base Under the Greenland Ice,” authored by Danish historians of science Kristian H. Nielsen and Henry Nielsen, only one woman even set foot there — a Danish doctor.\n\nProject Iceworm\n\nCamp Century operated continuously between 1960 and 1964, and then during summers only until its closure in 1967. The station’s public mission was scientific research.\n\nThe base itself was a study in the feasibility of long-term human habitation on the ice sheet. Other fields of scientific inquiry, according to Nielsen and Nielsen’s book, included the phenomena around the magnetic north pole and how they might affect communication channels, the geophysics of the ice sheet and how to identify dangerous glacier crevasses, and experimenting with cloud-seeding and other techniques as ways to mitigate treacherous whiteouts.\n\nThe US military actively publicized its achievements at Camp Century. Military officials hosted several journalists, who wrote stories celebrating the technical marvel the camp represented. Those ranks included Walter Cronkite, who visited and produced a CBS television documentary about the facility before Weiss’ arrival. Weiss later met Cronkite and said the pair exchanged stories about their time at Camp Century. The camp also welcomed two Boy Scouts: one from Denmark, which then controlled Greenland, and one from the United States, who spent the winter of 1960 on the ice sheet after winning a competition.\n\nWater — the camp needed about 8,000 gallons (some 30,000 liters) a day — came from a well dug in the ice with a drill that produced hot steam. Department of Defense\n\nBut behind the Cold War pomp and propaganda, Camp Century formed a testing ground for a clandestine mission known as Project Iceworm.\n\nThe bold plan envisioned a network of missile launch sites linked by a tunnel system under the Arctic ice that could potentially reach targets in Russia with greater precision. The project’s goal was to eventually cover an area of 52,000 square miles (about 135,000 square kilometers) — around the size of Alabama — with the ability to deploy some 600 missiles.\n\nWeiss said he witnessed what in hindsight was likely a failed effort to create a key plank of Project Iceworm, a way to move the missiles around under the ice while avoiding Russian surveillance: a subsurface railroad. He recalls unsuccessful attempts at the railroad’s construction taking place in a horseshoe-shaped tunnel excavated under the ice, which was tested to understand what kind of loads it could bear.\n\nCamp Century's heated buildings were raised off the floor to prevent the ice beneath them from turning to slush. Robert M. Weiss\n\nProject Iceworm only became public knowledge in 1997, when the Danish Institute of International Affairs obtained a declassified set of US documents in connection with a larger study of the role Greenland played in the Cold War, according to Nielsen and Nielsen’s book. No missiles ever made it to the snowy wilds of Camp Century, although nuclear missiles were stored at Thule Air Base — a US military outpost known today as Pituffik Space Base, located at the ice sheet’s northwestern edge — a move that triggered outrage in Greenland and Denmark when it became public.\n\nThe plan is also mentioned in a book titled “The Engineer Studies Center and Army Analysis: A History of the U.S. Army Engineer Studies Center, 1943-1982,” which was published in early 1985, said Eric Reinert, a curator at the Office of History, Headquarters, US Army Corps of Engineers. He added that it was possible material associated with Project Iceworm is still classified or awaiting declassification. The Pentagon did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe effort and expense of maintaining a network of miles of tunnels in the ice cap was a deciding factor in the decision to shut down Camp Century in 1967. Department of Defense\n\nA full accounting of the scope of Project Iceworm remains sorely lacking, Kristian Nielsen said.\n\n“Project Iceworm deserves a much bigger history because we only really have this one document that describes it. We don’t really have the original Project Iceworm documents,” said Nielsen, who is an associate professor at Aarhus University in Denmark.\n\n“We don’t know who discussed it and who developed the idea. It’s hard to really assess how seriously it was taken and whether it was only in a very small circle of people who dreamed of this possibility.”\n\nWhat’s more, it’s not clear whether Project Iceworm birthed the idea of Camp Century or vice versa, he added. “A lot of people seem to think that Project Iceworm was the big scheme behind Camp Century, but I’m thinking that Camp Century was already underway and then they thought, OK, what if we expand this.”\n\nA vehicle drives through the cavernous main street at Camp Century. Department of Defense\n\nWeiss said he heard nothing about Project Iceworm during his stints at Camp Century.\n\n“I’m not sure I even knew the word Iceworm in 1962 or ’63. I did not know about any missiles or nuclear stuff that was to be declassified later, but we were told that they wanted to run a subway under the surface of the ice,” Weiss said.\n\nGreenland, which is now an autonomous territory in the Kingdom of Denmark, remains strategically appealing to the United States. President Donald Trump has revived calls made in his first presidency for US ownership of the island, which occupies a unique geopolitical position between the US and Europe and is rich in certain natural resources — including rare earth metals, which may become easier to access as the climate warms.\n\n“(Greenland) is not necessary to launch an attack against Russia or any other country, because you can do that in other ways, mostly nuclear submarines and long-range missiles. But Greenland is still quite strategic in terms of surveillance, and it’s important for transport routes with the melting of the Arctic,” Kristian Nielsen said.\n\nCamp Century’s legacy\n\nWeiss took this image of the edge of the Greeland ice cap from a plane. Robert M. Weiss\n\nThe effort and expense of maintaining a network of miles of tunnels in the ice cap was a deciding factor in the decision to shut down Camp Century in 1967. The elements were slowly crushing the base as the gradual movement of the ice sheet deformed the structures. As a result, the tunnels became narrower over time. Weiss recalls that “shaving” tunnel walls and transporting the heaps of ice and snow to the surface took up a lot of time and resources at the camp, which had a dedicated snow maintenance crew.\n\nWhile Camp Century was an adventure he never sought out, for Weiss, it proved to be a turning point. The hours he spent in his bunk in the ice gave him time to widen and deepen his studies; he ultimately chose to focus on what has been a highly successful career in urology. Weiss no longer treats patients but is still actively writing grant proposals and scientific papers.\n\nCamp Century’s scientific legacy also endures, particularly in climate research. Over the course of seven years, scientists stationed at Camp Century drilled the first core of ice that captured the full thickness of the ice sheet — a depth of 4,560 feet (1,390 meters) — and included some sediment from the ground below. Although subsequent ice cores have provided more detailed information, it represented the first archive of past climate conditions going back more than 100,000 years.\n\nSimilar to how tree rings reveal climatic conditions of years past, from a core of ice scientists can discern annual variations in snow and ice, and oxygen isotopes contained in air bubbles can be used as a temperature indicator.\n\nThe gradual movement of snow and ice slowly narrowed and deformed the tunnels at Camp Century, crushing some of the buildings over time. Robert M. Weiss\n\n“Back in ’66 when the ice core came out, what we didn’t know much about past climate was a lot,” said William Colgan, a Canadian professor of glaciology based at the Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland, who describes Camp Century as the birthplace of paleoclimatology.\n\n“That first ice core started us on the path to understanding Earth’s paleoclimate. It’s hard to understate. Now when we look at our atmospheric CO2 and we place it in that 800,000-year context, that’s coming from ice cores. Back in 1966, we didn’t even have 1,000-year context,” he said.\n\nPaul Bierman, a professor and geomorphologist at the University of Vermont, agreed, describing the drilling of the ice core, and the 1969 paper spilling its secrets, as a stunning achievement. The findings resulted in what was effectively a frozen Rosetta stone, allowing scientists to understand in detail the climate over the past 100,000 years and beyond.\n\n“That is probably still the most influential paper in climate science, if you had to pick one,” said Bierman, who is the author of “When the Ice Is Gone: What a Greenland Ice Core Reveals About Earth’s Tumultuous History and Perilous Future.”\n\nRisk of waste exposure in a warming world\n\nColgan visited Camp Century for the first time in 2010 to drill an additional ice core covering the period from 1966 to present day. That trip left him wondering about what was left of Camp Century in the ice beneath his feet.\n\nThe main tunnel at Camp Century. Robert M. Weiss The icy surface above Camp Century. Robert M.

Weiss In Camp Century, Weiss, pictured here in New Haven in 2018, said he would awake each morning and repeat a quote from Voltaire: “All is for the best in this best of all possible worlds.” The words offered solace, and had subsequently served him well throughout the decades, a reminder that apparent adversity often leads to a positive result. Courtesy Robert M. Weiss Camp Century Prev Next\n\nColgan returned to the location of Camp Century and subsequently embarked on a multiyear project to log and understand whether the biological, chemical and radioactive waste and physical debris left behind when Camp Century closed were at risk of being exposed as the climate warmed.\n\nThe US military removed the nuclear reactor that powered Camp Century, but batches of radioactive wastewater had been discharged into a cavity in the ice sheet during its years of operation. Additionally, the sewage produced by the camps’ inhabitants is still contained in the ice.\n\nIt’s not clear whether that waste and debris will remain entombed in the ice forever. Colgan’s projections, described in a 2016 study and a subsequent 2022 study, indicate that the site will experience no significant melt before 2100. This projection could change after 2100 if the Paris Agreement to limit global warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius is not adopted, he said.\n\nColgan and his colleagues have been keeping track of the debris and waste left behind at Camp Century, which now lie more than 98 feet (30 meters) below the surface. Horst Machguth/GEUS\n\nColgan and his colleagues have drilled additional ice cores from Camp Century. Horst Machguth/GEUS\n\nThe core extracted from Camp Century nearly five decades ago is still yielding new information. While much of the sample was destroyed during the initial phase of study, remaining segments are stored near Denver at the National Science Federation Ice Core Facility, after spending a stint at the University of Buffalo in upstate New York. However, sediment from the very bottom of the ice core that researchers had lost track of after it left Buffalo in the 1990s unexpectedly turned up in 2017 stored in glass jars in a freezer in Copenhagen.\n\nBierman was invited to study some of the sample, and he recalled melting the frozen sediment back in his Vermont lab in 2019 as his career’s only “eureka moment.”\n\nHis analysis revealed fossilized plant remains in the sediment — bits of twig, leaves and mosses which he said offered the first direct evidence that a large part of Greenland was ice-free around 400,000 years ago, when temperatures were similar to those the world is approaching now.\n\n“We actually have plants and bugs, things that tell you that the ice was gone,” he said.\n\nThe exquisitely preserved remains of a 400,000-year-old sedge seed were found in soil from the bottom of the Camp Century ice core. Halley Mastro/University of Vermont\n\nThe plant fossils, which included the moss seen here, revealed Greenland was not covered in ice 400,000 years ago. Halley Mastro/University of Vermont\n\nThe study overturned previous assumptions that most of Greenland’s ice sheet has been frozen for millions of years and suggests the possibility of alarming sea level rise if it were to melt completely.\n\nFor Bierman, the science conducted at Camp Century is the station’s most powerful legacy. He said almost 100 scientific papers had been published by scientists based on work done at what he described as a unique outpost of humanity.\n\n“This core lives on. Everything else at the camp is crushed and most of the people (who worked there) are dead,” Bierman said. “It lives on in a way that is telling us, at a time we absolutely need to know how the Greenland Ice Sheet behaved in the past, when that body of ice was gone.”\n\nSign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter.

There was no targeting, there was no nothing. That narrative that got spun into, 'Oh, the vets hate the rookies. The rookies hate the vets. The vets are going after certain players,' it’s all bulls---. If I'm just going to be frank, it's all bulls---. What it is is racism,\" Cloud said.\n\nINSIDE CAITLIN CLARK AND ANGEL REESE'S IMPACT ON MEN'S BASKETBALL\n\nClark took an infamous illegal hip check from Chicago Sky forward Chennedy Carter June 1. Fellow Sky player and Clark's archrival, Angel Reese, struck Clark in the head with her arm while trying to block a pass during a game June 16. On Aug. 31, another Sky player, Diamond DeShields, sent Clark flying across the floor for a foul that was later upgraded to flagrant.\n\nIn Clark's first playoff game against the Connecticut Sun Sept. 22, Sun player DiJonai Carrington gave Clark a black eye by poking her with her fingernails.\n\n\"It gets blown up into, ‘Oh, they’re going after Caitlin Clark.’ But, no, we're just playing one of the best players that's in this league the way that any other best player or franchise player has been played,\" Cloud said.\n\nEarlier in the interview, Cloud addressed the increase in fans of the WNBA and suggested their interest was not rooted in fandom.\n\nHOW CAITLIN CLARK BATTLED THROUGH CULTURE WARS EN ROUTE TO HISTORIC 2024\n\n\"The craziness that came with the new fandom was rooted in something other than fandom, and I think that was very evident across the board,\" Cloud said. \"In a lot of ways, it has not been about basketball.\"\n\nCloud is not the first WNBA player or former player to suggest some of Clark's followers are racist.\n\nReese said in the first episode of her podcast \"there's a lot of racism when it comes to it\" regarding the motivation of Clark's fans. WNBA legend Sue Bird lashed out at this group in her podcast in November, claiming some of them aren't even fans of Clark but are just \"acting\" as fans while \"pushing racist agendas and pushing hate.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nHowever, not all prominent women's basketball players are as dismissive of the controversial fans Clark has brought to the sport.\n\nUSC women's basketball star JuJu Watkins, who has a chance to break Clark's NCAA scoring record, previously told Fox News Digital she welcomes all the fans Clark has brought to the sport and hopes they might even root for Watkins.\n\n\"So many new fans being in the sport sometimes can be, not necessarily challenging, but can just kind of give you a headache a bit. Not a lot of people know what they're talking about sometimes. But it's great for the sport. The fact that people are watching is enough in itself,\" Watkins said.\n\n\"We would like it to be positive, but it's not always going to be like that. So, as long as we continue to raise the numbers and viewership goes up, I think that's all we can ask for.\"\n\nWhen asked if she wants the sport's controversial new fans to cheer for her, too, Watkins answered, \"Oh yeah. I love supporters, and I also love haters.\n\n\"I think that's just a part of the game. There's so many sides to it. So, it's the nature of the game, and there's always going to be negative and positive aspects of it.\"",

        "source": "https://www.foxnews.com/",
        "content": "EXCLUSIVE: After surviving nearly a year and a half deep underground, with barely enough air to breathe and no light, and sharing an 18-square-foot space with three other men, recently released hostage Tal Shoham shared with Fox News Digital his harrowing story of captivity at the hands of Hamas.\n\nShoham was forcibly taken from Kibbutz Be’eri on October 7, 2023. His wife and children, ages four and eight, were also kidnapped that day, but he didn’t know that when he was thrown into the trunk of a car and driven into Gaza by Hamas terrorists. He didn’t even know whether his family was alive; hoping to save them, he surrendered to the terrorists just before they set fire to the house where his family was hiding.\n\nHe would spend the eight-and-a-half months in an underground tunnel and another five months captive in five different houses deep inside Gaza, where his captors kept him shackled, starved him and deprived him of basic human comforts.\n\nREMAINS OF SHIRI BIBAS, MOM OF TWO KILLED, ALLEGEDLY RETURNED TO ISRAEL FOLLOWING HAMAS' BROKEN PROMISE\n\nBut he gave himself a mission: He was determined not to lose his humanity. Even in moments when he feared that he was facing death, he tried to stay focused. \"I am not a victim. Even if this ends, I will end it with my head high, looking death in the eyes. They won’t break me, and I will not surrender to self-pity. We are stronger than the other side,\" he said.\n\nIt has been three weeks since he came home, and he is ready to speak. Kibbutz Be’eri is just nine kilometers — about five-and-a-half miles — from Gaza, but that short distance is practically an ocean between what he describes as two worlds. \"Half-an-hour’s drive, two separate worlds,\" he said. \"The first — unbelievably surreal, cruel beyond reason. And just 30 minutes away [on this side of the border], a world of sanity, logic, dignity and compassion.\"\n\nHe remembers every detail of his 505 days in captivity. Tal wants to tell his story for the sake of the two fellow captives who remain behind, starving, abused and at constant risk of death. \"Just as someone emerges from a womb alive, I emerged from the tunnel I was held in and was born again,\" he says. But the men he calls his \"brothers,\" Evyatar David and Guy Gilboa-Dalal, are still held underground. \"I can’t sleep at night knowing they are still there,\" he says.\n\nOctober 7, 2023\n\nTal and his wife and children had come from the north of Israel to Kibbutz Be’eri to spend the Simchat Torah holiday with his wife’s parents and were in the home when the terror attack began. He said everyone entered the safe room, and as the sounds of gunfire drew closer, they tried to barricade themselves inside. But the terrorists pried open the window, and Tal feared they might toss in a grenade if the family did not surrender. On the same street, the terrorists set fire to every other home, burning the people inside alive.\n\n\"I went out and raised my hands,\" he said. \"A man with murder in his eyes led me onto the road and to a vehicle. I saw about 40 heavily armed terrorists. Some of them were filming me on their phones. I was in shock — there was an entire battalion of Hamas terrorists inside our kibbutz, bodies of people I knew who were murdered on the ground, and they are laughing, unafraid.\"\n\nHAMAS FREES THREE MORE HOSTAGES IN EXCHANGE FOR MORE THAN 300 PRISONERS AS PART OF CEASEFIRE DEAL WITH ISRAEL\n\nThe terrorists threw him into the trunk of a car and drove him across the border, into Gaza. There, a crowd gathered. \"Teenagers with sticks ran toward me, trying to beat me from all sides,\" he says. Taking him from the car, his captors pointed a rifle at him, ready, he believed, to execute him, and tried to force him to kneel. \"I said, ‘I can’t control whether you kill me or not,’ and I raised my hands — but I refused to kneel. ‘If you want to kill me, kill me, but you will not execute me like ISIS.’\"\n\nHe was then paraded through the streets in what he described as a \"victory march.\" \"They were shouting, ‘Soldier! Pig! Zionist!’ A mob gathered around, boys with wooden clubs trying to hit me. But I just waved and smiled. I didn’t show fear. ‘You’ve captured me, but you won’t see terror in my eyes.’\"\n\n34 Days of Isolation\n\nHe was first taken to the home of a family, where he was held, alone and always shackled, for 34 days. Though he was allowed to periodically shower, the captivity was otherwise severe.\n\nHis food was strictly rationed. \"For the first three days, I had pita bread. Then, they stopped giving me that,\" he says. \"Food supplies dwindled. Some days, I would receive three spoons of avocado and three dates, or half an orange from a tree in the yard.\"\n\nBut the worst torment was not knowing whether his family was alive. \"I am 40 years old. Never in my life have I experienced suffering like this. The isolation, being alone with relentless thoughts —that was worse than even extreme hunger.\"\n\nTo endure, he made a heartbreaking decision. \"I had to accept that my family was dead,\" Tal says. \"I sat on the floor and imagined myself at their funeral. I stood in front of a grave — one large for my wife, and two small for my children — and I eulogized each of them. I thanked them for the time we had. I told them to move on. I sobbed but didn’t let my captors see me cry. That was the hardest thing I’ve ever done — burying my family in my mind.\"\n\nAFTER TRUMP THREAT, HAMAS REFUSES TO RELEASE MORE HOSTAGES WITHOUT PHASE 2 CEASEFIRE DEAL\n\n505 Days In Hell\n\nOn the 34th day of his captivity, Evyatar David and Guy Gilboa-Dalal were brought to the home. The Hamas terrorists tortured them daily, hitting them, denying them food while eating in front of them. The hostages were allowed only about 300 calories a day — Shoham's weight dropped from 174 pounds to 110 pounds when he was released — and speaking was forbidden. \"We couldn’t move from our beds or talk. We whispered everything,\" he said.\n\nThen came some glimmer of hope. On the 50th day of his captivity, Tal received proof of life from his wife — a letter telling him she and the children had been held hostage but were being released. \"I read it, my hands shaking,\" he said. \"The most important thing had happened — my family was safe. I didn’t need to be a father and husband protecting them anymore. Now, I could focus on my war, the one I knew how to fight, the one for survival.\"\n\nThe Tunnel\n\nBy June 2024, Tal, Guy and Evyatar were moved by an ambulance that Hamas used for discreetly transporting hostages, to an underground tunnel, where there already was another captive, Omer Wenkert. There were four mattresses on the floor and a hole in the ground for a toilet. The space was illuminated by a single, dim lightbulb. \"It took me weeks to stop feeling like the walls were closing in, to adapt to the oxygen deprivation,\" Tal says.\n\nThey were given just 300 milliliters of water a day — a little more than 10 ounces. They could use it to either drink or wash their hands. Rice was all they had to eat. Months passed. They were beaten, monitored by cameras, randomly deprived of food and sleep. The guards were Hamas tunnel diggers — digging every day, even as war raged above. \"Hamas never stopped digging tunnels,\" Tal Says. \"Not for a single day.\"\n\nThe conditions were so bad that both he and Evyatar developed severe infections. But it would be months before a doctor would come to see them. \"My leg turned blue, yellow, and purple with internal bleeding,\" He recalls. \"They gave us all blood thinners, fearing we might develop clots from prolonged immobility. Eventually, they realized the issue was malnutrition and provided us with vitamin supplements for seven days. It tasted like dog food, but it dramatically improved our condition.\"\n\nISRAEL SAYS HAMAS SENT A TODDLER TO A MILITARY OUTPOST\n\nBut the abuse continued. A new guard arrived, even more violent than the previous ones. \"He made some of us kneel like dogs and beat us,\" he says. \"He would come in screaming that we were filthy Jews, hit us, and then 10 minutes later, he would smile and bring food.\"\n\nThen, what seemed like a miracle. Tal and Omer were named as part of the hostage-release deal in February. When he was led outside after many months underground, still blindfolded, he felt moisture on his face. \"Is it rain?\" he asked. \"No,\" his captors responded, \"’It is dew.’ And I realized, my name, Tal, is ‘dew’ in Hebrew. I felt the morning dew on my skin.\"\n\nThere were humiliations to come before he was handed over to the Red Cross and returned to Israel: a procession on a stage in the heart of Rafah where he was forced to repeat Hamas propaganda. But he said he didn’t care — he was going home. When he arrived in Israel, he was taken to the Re’im base, where his wife, Adi, and their two children, Nave and Yahel, were waiting for him. \"It was a dream come true, yet it still felt like a dream,\" Tal says. \"It took a few days to fully grasp that it was real. It was hard to take in. The emotions flooded me, like I was floating above everything.\"\n\nAnd there was tragic news to absorb. Eleven members of Tal’s family were kidnapped or murdered on October 7. Adi’s father, Avshalom Haran, and two uncles, Lilach and Evyatar Kipnis, were killed. His mother-in-law, Shoshan Haran, was taken, along with two other relatives — Sharon Avigdori and her daughter, Noam Avigdori — who were later released in the first hostage deal. Two other relatives who had come from the United States to celebrate a birthday, 59-year-old Judith Raanan, and her 17-year-old daughter, Natalie, were also kidnapped from Kibbutz Nahal Oz.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nAnd there was joy. During his captivity, four new babies were born into the family. \"Among us, the Jewish hostages, there was purity,\" he said. \"There was dignity. The terrorists brought in whatever horrors they wanted, inflicted whatever cruelty and pain they could, imposed their inhumanity on us. But within our space, we preserved our inner cleanliness, our humanity between one another. And that was crucial to making it out unbroken.\"",

When stress levels were also raised through social isolation, the lesions grew even more.\n\nEXPERIMENTAL VACCINE FOR COMMON CANCER SHOWS POTENTIAL IN CLINICAL TRIAL\n\nThe stress-related cancer risk was more pronounced in female mice.\n\nBased on these findings, the researchers suggested exploring the use of existing medications to reduce the risk of obesity- and stress-related cancers.\n\n\"Since β-adrenergic receptors play a crucial role in stress-related cancer growth, commonly used beta-blockers, which are drugs prescribed for high blood pressure, could be repurposed to help mitigate these effects,\" a press release stated.\n\nPancreatic cancer is one of the deadliest types in the U.S., with a five-year survival rate of just 13%.\n\nPANCREATIC CANCER PATIENT SURVIVAL DOUBLED WITH HIGH DOSE OF COMMON VITAMIN, STUDY FINDS\n\nOne of the biggest challenges with the disease is that it’s often detected at a late stage when the disease is already advanced, according to Dr. Robert Den, a radiation oncologist, professor of radiation oncology, and chief medical officer at Alpha Tau Medical in Israel.\n\n\"Unlike some other cancers, there are no effective early screening tools, so by the time a patient is diagnosed, treatment options are often limited,\" Den, who was not involved in the study, told Fox News Digital.\n\nThe study reinforces the strong connection between the mind and body as it related to cancer development, Den said.\n\n\"Stress and its associated pathways can exacerbate disease progression, and we know that obesity fuels certain cancers, potentially impacting a patient’s response to treatment,\" he said.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR HEALTH NEWSLETTER\n\n\"In this case, we’re seeing evidence that stress and obesity may contribute to the worsening of pancreatic cancer, which has major implications for both prevention and treatment strategies.\"\n\nMaintaining a heart-healthy diet and eating in moderation are essential, Den noted — not just for cancer prevention but for overall health.\n\n\"Exercise is particularly crucial in addressing both obesity and stress,\" he said. \"Staying active is not only beneficial for physical health, but also an excellent way to reduce stress.\"\n\nMindfulness can also play a key role in reducing cancer risk, the doctor advised.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"Spending time outdoors can also improve both mental and physical well-being, so I always encourage patients to find ways to be active, connect with nature and prioritize their overall wellness,\" he said.\n\nFor more Health articles, visit www.foxnews.com/health\n\nRegarding pancreatic cancer treatment, Den noted that there have been some advancements in chemotherapy and surgical techniques, but \"there hasn’t yet been a breakthrough.\"\n\n\"Most immunotherapies, which have been revolutionary in other cancers, have not shown the same promise in pancreatic cancer,\" he said.\n\n\"The key challenge is finding ways to help patients who are not candidates for surgery, as surgery remains the best line of defense.\"\n\nFox News Digital reached out to the study researchers for comment.",

        "content": "If Democratic lawmakers won’t listen to President Trump on cutting waste, maybe they’ll listen to President Barack Obama.\n\nIn a recently resurfaced video from 2011, then-President Obama called on the federal government to cut wasteful government spending and programs, even the ones that \"a lot of people care about.\"\n\n\"Everyone knows that getting rid of the deficit will require some tough decisions, and that includes cutting back on billions of dollars in programs that a lot of people care about,\" the former president said in the nearly 14-year-old clip.\n\nOBAMA CENTER SUBCONTRACTOR FILES $40M DISCRIMINATION LAWSUIT AGAINST ENGINEERING FIRM FOR OVERRUNS\n\nAs a reminder to Democratic figures demanding an end to the Trump administration’s agenda of cutting wasteful government spending, conservative users on X shared the old video of Obama lobbying for similar things.\n\nThough Obama mentioned the importance of these more painful cuts, he stressed that the U.S. government should at least get rid of its \"pointless waste and stupid spending that doesn’t benefit anybody.\"\n\nHe added that it's \"waste we should be getting rid of even if we didn’t have a deficit.\"\n\n\"No amount of waste is acceptable, especially when it’s your money,\" Obama said, referring to American taxpayers. \"Just as families are living within their means, government should too.\"\n\nObama even provided some examples of this \"stupid spending,\" asking viewers, \"Did you know the federal government pays for a website devoted to a folk music ensemble made up of forest rangers? They’re called the ‘Fiddlin’ Foresters.’\"\n\n\"I’ll put their music on my iPod, but I’m not paying for their websites.\"\n\nThe 44th president went on to mention what other wasteful things taxpayers were paying for, including \"thousands of buildings across the country that no one uses.\"\n\nObama even announced that he was putting then-Vice President Joe Biden in charge of this effort to \"hunt down misspent tax dollars in every agency and department of this government.\"\n\nBiden made an appearance in the clip, noting how the job is going to take \"relentless focus.\"\n\n\"We’re holding ourselves accountable, and we’re deeply committed and focused on making government function better,\" he said.\n\nJAMES CARVILLE: TOO MANY DEMOCRATS ARE LOSING THEIR MINDS OVER TRUMP.

        "source": "https://www.foxnews.com/",
        "content": "PUNTA CANA, Dominican Republic — The section of beach where University of Pittsburgh student Sudiksha Konanki vanished on spring break last week is the same place where four European tourists drowned in January.\n\nIt's known to be dangerous with rough surf and strong and unpredictable currents, said Luis Vilchez, a Dominican attorney who is not involved in the case.\n\n\"Every beach located in the Macao area, where this one is located, and in Uvero Alto, are beaches in Punta Cana where you have to be careful, because when those waves are strong, they drag you out to sea,\" he told Fox News Digital.\n\nKEY WITNESS IN AMERICAN COLLEGE STUDENT'S DISAPPEARANCE TELLS POLICE HOW THEY MET, WHAT HAPPENED ON BEACH\n\nIn January, multiple people drowned and others were rescued from the beach behind the same resort where Konanki was last seen, the Riu Republica in Punta Cana. The first three to be recovered were identified as European tourists, two from Poland and another from Portugal.\n\nThe remains of a third Polish national were found washed ashore the following day, according to Bavaro Digital, a local newspaper.\n\nVilchez noted there were red warning flags flying the morning of Konanki's disappearance, a sign that surf conditions were especially rough at the time. But she and her friends may have been unsuspecting victims after a night out drinking March 5 into the early morning hours the following day.\n\nMISSING AMERICAN IN DOMINICAN REPUBLIC: NO SUSPECTS AS SEARCH FOR SUDIKSHA KONANKI REACHES ONE WEEK\n\nAround 4:15 a.m., Konanki was part of a group of six women and two men seen on surveillance video approaching the beach. Six of them came back around 6 a.m., leaving Konanki alone on the beach with an Iowa 22-year-old named Joshua Riibe.\n\nRiibe, a fellow spring breaker from St. Cloud State University in Minnesota, is cooperating with authorities and has not been named a suspect, came back alone around 10 a.m. Konanki is the only person who is unaccounted for.\n\n\"Drunk people in the middle of the night won't take that into account,\" Vilchez said. \"While the waves at that specific beach can be dangerous on normal occasions, they're even more so when the red flag is up.\"\n\nAMERICAN COLLEGE STUDENT DISAPPEARS IN DOMINICAN REPUBLIC: TIMELINE\n\nKonanki and her friends were seen at the hotel bar with drinks before heading down to the beach behind the resort, according to authorities.\n\n\"In the video, the two are seen walking sideways; they couldn't walk straight,\" he told Fox News Digital, referring to the last known surveillance video of Konanki showing her headed toward the beach with a group of friends. \"If they had gotten into the water at that time, a wave could have easily done everything he says.\"\n\nRiibe allegedly told authorities the two had been swept away by a strong wave and carried down the shoreline, according to a transcript of one of his interviews with police. After struggling to make it back to land, he said he threw up from swallowing salt water.\n\nHOTEL HORROR STORIES EMERGE AFTER AMERICAN COLLEGE STUDENT GOES MISSING AS RESORT INSISTS NO CONNECTION\n\n\"I asked if she was OK. I didn’t hear her response because I started vomiting all the seawater I had swallowed,\" Riibe said. \"After vomiting, I looked around and didn’t see anyone. I thought she had grabbed her things and left. I felt really bad and exhausted. I lay down on a beach chair, fell asleep because I couldn’t go very far and later woke up because of the sun and mosquito bites. I went to my friend’s room to get my phone, then went to my own room to sleep.\"\n\nThen he fell asleep on a beach chair and was seen returning to the hotel around 10 a.m.\n\nExperts previously told Fox News Digital the beach is known for its strong currents and that they can be unpredictable, changing without warning.\n\n\"Punta Cana is located on the Mona Passage, which connects the Caribbean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean between the Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico,\" Andrew Wulfeck, a FOX Weather meteorologist and digital content producer, explained. He examined coastal records from around the time of Konanki’s disappearance.\n\n\"As is common where two waterways meet, the swell can be erratic and difficult to forecast, unlike the more predictable patterns often seen on beaches along the U.S. East Coast.\"\n\nWhile some experts have taken issue with his story, Vilchez said he believes there would not have been time to commit foul play and hide the evidence.\n\n\"At 6 a.m. there are people coming down to sunbathe,\" he told Fox News Digital. \"If he had killed her, he wouldn't have had time to get her anywhere without being seen.\"\n\nUNPREDICTABLE OCEAN CURRENTS, BEACHFRONT POSE MAJOR SEARCH CHALLENGE\n\nThe resort and its neighboring competitors all have cameras, he said, including on the beaches on both sides of the Riu.\n\n\"A drunk guy wouldn't have had the mental capacity to drown her and throw her into the current — and be lucky that that body hasn't been found by now,\" he said.\n\nRiibe is cooperating with authorities and has not been named a suspect. But in a statement Friday, his parents said they were concerned about \"irregular conditions\" he faced during the first six days of the investigation.\n\n\"Despite his full willingness to cooperate, Josh has been detained under irregular conditions and subjected to extensive questioning without the presence of official translators or legal counsel until Wednesday, March 12,\" his parents, Albert and Tina Riibe, said through their attorneys.\n\n\"He has remained in his hotel room under police surveillance and has been repeatedly taken to the police station since March 6, where he has been interrogated for long hours. This situation has raised serious concern within his family, which has led us to retain legal counsel to initiate legal actions ensuring his safety and the protection of his rights throughout this process.\"\n\nHOTEL HORROR STORIES EMERGE AFTER AMERICAN COLLEGE STUDENT GOES MISSING AS RESORT INSISTS NO CONNECTION\n\nThe family said they were willing to continue cooperating with search efforts and wanted to share their \"deep sorrow and solidarity\" with Konanki's family.\n\n\"Above all, we wish to contribute to the search efforts and understand the anguish and uncertainty they are going through, and we share the hope that Sudiksha will be found as soon as possible,\" they said. \"Joshua Riibe is deeply dismayed by her disappearance and has fully cooperated in the search and clarification of the facts from the very beginning.\"\n\nKonanki's whereabouts remain unknown, and officials say they are working a missing persons case and not a criminal investigation, but they have left open all possibilities. On the other hand, experts also say that bodies tend to float back to shore within two or three days. She vanished March 6.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nDominican police are leading the investigation, with assistance from multiple U.S. agencies, including the FBI and Homeland Security. Investigators with the Loudoun County Sheriff's Office in Konanki's hometown sent two detectives to Punta Cana with permission from Dominican authorities. They interviewed Riibe Thursday, conducted some independent work on the ground and were headed back to the U.S. Friday.\n\n\"Mr. Riibe is not a suspect in any way shape or form,\" a sheriff's spokesman told Fox News Digital.",

        "content": "President Donald Trump invoked the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 Saturday to target the designated foreign terrorist organization Tren de Aragua (TdA) just hours after a federal judge in Washington, D.C., ruled the law could not be used to deport five Venezuelans.\n\nThe wartime law, which allows deportation of natives and citizens of an enemy nation without a hearing, has been invoked three times, during the War of 1812, World War I and World War II.\n\nAll Venezuelan citizens 14 years or older who are members of TdA, are within the U.S. and are not naturalized or lawful permanent residents of the U.S. may be apprehended, restrained, secured and removed as \"alien enemies,\" according to a proclamation.\n\n'WEAPONIZED MIGRATION': US FACES DEADLY CONSEQUENCES WITH MADURO IN POWER, VENEZUELAN OPPOSITION WARNS\n\nHours before the act was signed, a lawsuit was filed by the American Civil Liberties Union, Democracy Forward and the ACLU of the District of Columbia, claiming the proclamation could be used to deport any Venezuelan in the country, regardless of whether they are a member of TdA.\n\nChief U.S. District Judge James E. Boasberg of the D.C. Circuit granted a temporary restraining order preventing the deportation of five Venezuelans already in immigration custody for two weeks.\n\nThe Trump administration appealed the restraining order, alleging it is improper to delay a presidential act before it is announced, affiliate FOX 32 Chicago reported.\n\nA second hearing is scheduled for Saturday afternoon to establish if the order should be broadened to everyone in danger of removal under the act.\n\n\"The United States is not at war, nor has it been invaded. The president’s anticipated invocation of wartime authority — which is not needed to conduct lawful immigration enforcement operations — is the latest step in an accelerating authoritarian playbook,\" Skye Perryman, president and CEO of Democracy Forward, wrote in a statement.\n\n\"From improperly apprehending American citizens to violating the ability of communities to peacefully worship to now improperly trying to invoke a law that is responsible for some of our nation’s most shameful actions, this administration’s immigration agenda is as lawless as it is harmful.\"\n\nAn in-person hearing on the lawsuit's merits is scheduled for D.C. Monday.\n\nThe move fulfills a campaign promise made during an October rally, when Trump announced he would use the law to combat Tren de Aragua (TdA) members in the U.S.\n\nTren de Aragua (TdA), designated a foreign terrorist organization Feb. 20 by the Department of State, has thousands of members, many of whom the White House says have unlawfully infiltrated the United States and are \"conducting irregular warfare and undertaking hostile actions against the United States.\"\n\nColorado officials confirmed TdA occupied entire apartment complexes in Aurora, noting a special task force had to be established to combat its activity.\n\nTRUMP TO INVOKE WARTIME ALIEN ENEMIES ACT OF 1798 TO FAST-TRACK DEPORTATIONS OF ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS\n\nAs of Sept. 11, 2024, the Aurora Police Department linked the gang to nearly a dozen people, resulting in eight arrests.\n\n\"Two of the eight individuals who were taken into custody were involved in a July shooting at one of the specific properties in the city that have experienced issues with TdA activity,\" according to a statement. \"In line with these arrests, we can also now confirm that criminal activity, including TdA issues, had significantly affected those properties.\"\n\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE IMMIGRATION COVERAGE\n\nThe White House said the gang has continued to engage in mass illegal migration to the U.S. to \"further its objectives of harming United States citizens,\" undermining public safety.\n\nTdA operates in conjunction with Cártel de los Soles, the Nicolás Maduro regime-sponsored narco-terrorism enterprise based in Venezuela, and commits brutal crimes, including murders, kidnappings, extortion and human, drug, and weapons trafficking, according to the White House.\n\nIt grew significantly while Tareck El Aissami served as governor of Aragua between 2012 and 2017. In 2017, El Aissami was appointed vice president of Venezuela.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nSoon after, the Treasury Department designated El Aissami a specially designated narcotics trafficker under the Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act, and he remains a U.S. fugitive.\n\nIn 2020, Maduro and other regime members were charged with narcoterrorism and other crimes in an alleged plot against America.\n\nFox News Digital's Louis Casiano contributed to this report.",

For those lacking immunity, MMR vaccine boosters are available.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR HEALTH NEWSLETTER\n\n\"I'd say if you're starting to see measles in your area, and you're concerned about whether or not you have immunity, go to your doctor and get your titers checked,\" he advised.\n\n\"Otherwise, practice all those good hygiene methods that we talked about. Wash your hands. Wear a mask. Be aware of your surroundings. Clean surfaces.\"\n\nFor those who are feeling sick, Whyte encouraged staying home and abstaining from traveling to help keep others healthy.\n\nMeasles symptoms typically begin with coughing and sneezing, and then lead to a red rash on the face and body several days later.\n\nFor more Health articles, visit www.foxnews.com/health\n\n\"A lot of physicians [have] never seen measles,\" Whyte noted. \"So, you have to sometimes prompt your doctor if you think you might have been exposed.\"\n\nMeasles can cause serious complications, the doctor warned, including brain swelling and pneumonia, particularly in older individuals.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"The good news is, if you're immunized, you're unlikely to be affected, even if you come into contact with someone who does have measles,\" Whyte said.\n\n\"That's the whole beauty of immunization.\"",

St. Louis County police said a woman there was found dead near electrical lines in the backyard of her home.\n\nIn Arkansas, three fatalities were confirmed in Independence County, and 29 people were reported injured in eight counties in connection to a storm system that moved through the state overnight, the Arkansas Division of Emergency Management said.\n\nAnd in Mississippi, three residents were killed, and multiple others were injured around the town of Darbun.\n\nAs the Sun rose on Saturday, authorities discovered the extent of the damage throughout the region, pummeled by over 150 Tornado Warnings since Friday morning.\n\nA tornado in Villa Ridge, Missouri, outside of St. Louis, was captured on camera as it caused significant damage. According to storm chasers, the tornado's winds caused numerous power flashes, several semi-trucks to flip, and various structures to be damaged.\n\nTornadoes were also reported in communities such as Rolla, Hartville and areas outside St. Louis.\n\nAt least five people were injured when a tornado tore through Cave City, Arkansas, according to Mayor Jonas Anderson, who declared a state of emergency.\n\n\"There are no known fatalities. This is an absolute miracle from God,\" Anderson said. \"There is a lot to wrap our heads around and lots to do.\"\n\nIn southwestern Indiana, a violent tornado tore through parts of Gibson County, leaving a scene of destruction. Evansville resident Jay Burden captured video footage (seen below) of the tornado's path toward Oakland City from his home.\n\n\"I was just hoping everyone in the path had clear advanced warning to take shelter,\" Burden told FOX Weather.\n\nGibson County Sheriff Bruce Vanoven said in a video statement there was extensive damage around the Oakland city area and the rural Francisco area. \"I implore you, I beg you, please do not come out and survey the storm damage,\" he said. \"Give us time to do our jobs. There are trees down. There were power lines down. There are power poles down.

The SPC placed portions of more than half a dozen states under a ‘Particularly Dangerous Situation’ Tornado Watch Friday night ahead of the severe weather outbreak. A PDS Tornado Watch is issued when forecasters have high confidence that multiple violent tornadoes will occur in the watch area.\n\nBut Saturday is expected to be potentially the most dangerous day of the outbreak as the powerful storm system will continue tracking east across the central Gulf Coast states and Deep South into the Tennessee Valley.\n\n\"This will be a very scary situation for many,\" said meteorologists with NWS Birmingham. \"The atmosphere is so strong there isn't a whole lot that will weaken it.\"\n\nA Level 5 out of 5 on the severe storm threat level is impacting 3.3 million people in major cities like Birmingham, Alabama, Jackson, Mississippi, Tuscaloosa and Hoover in Alabama and Hattiesburg, Mississippi.",

        "content": "NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!\n\nThe passage of the continuing resolution to keep the government open was a remarkable example of the revolutionary movement through which we are living.\n\nTraditionally, a continuing resolution requires a bipartisan agreement to get through the Senate.\n\nRepublican leaders meet with Democratic leaders to discuss it. And the continuing resolution becomes far more expensive – and gains a lot more ideological language.\n\nSHUTDOWN AVERTED AFTER SCHUMER CAVES AND BACKS TRUMP SPENDING BILL\n\nAfter the 2024 election, many supposed experts said that President Donald Trump would have a hard time getting legislation through the extraordinarily narrow House Republican majority – or past the Senate’s 60-vote threshold.\n\nThe House Republicans have been in turmoil for a decade. Speaker John Boehner retired early in October 2015. His successor, Speaker Paul Ryan announced he would not run again in the middle of 2018. There was a 40-seat defeat in that mid-term election. Then Speaker Kevin McCarthy worked for four years to regrow a Republican majority, but a small, embittered faction simply made his speakership unsustainable. It took 15 ballots for McCarthy to win the Speakership. Then, he was forced out by the same embittered dissidents on Oct. 3, 2023.\n\nFinally, Speaker Mike Johnson emerged as the consensus candidate for Speaker after three high-profile members failed to win 218 votes. Since Johnson had not been in leadership, it represented an enormous jump in responsibility. This led many to believe he would not be able to control the office, which had ultimately forced out Boehner, Ryan, and McCarthy.\n\nSpeaker Johnson has turned out to be far more successful – and a lot more strategic – than anyone expected. He also decided early that he could only be effective as President Trump’s ally.\n\nSenate Majority Leader John Thune was a House veteran who has served 20 years in the Senate. At 64, he is a generation younger than former Leader Mitch McConnell. Thune has proven to be a good partner for President Trump and Speaker Johnson. The three have worked hard to get on the same page and to work together to get things done.\n\nIf you had told any so-called expert on Jan. 20 that Republicans could get a seven-month continuing resolution to keep the government open for the rest of the fiscal year through the House with only Republican votes, he or she probably would not have believed you. If you had then told them the bill would be difficult for Senate Democrats to undermine, they would have thought you were dreaming. Finally, if you told them that Speaker Johnson, President Trump, and Majority Leader Thune would out-maneuver the Democrats and give them no choice but to pass the continuing resolution or close the government, the experts would have dismissed you out of hand.\n\nYet, with help from Office of Management and Budget Director Russ Vought, President Trump executed what would have been called in chess a fork.\n\nA fork is a setting where your opponent has two chess pieces at risk. Both cannot be saved. The only choice is which one to sacrifice.\n\nThe continuing resolution coming out of the House was entirely Republican. It cut spending. It shifted spending from domestic policies Republicans opposed to into immigration enforcement and defense. More importantly, it rewrote current law to give President Trump and Elon Musk greater flexibility to cut spending and waste.\n\nThe Democrats were furious that they were being cut out of the process. They were desperate to defeat the Republican effort, so they could then offer to work with them and develop a much more liberal and anti-change bill.\n\nWhen the Democrats failed to stop Speaker Johnson, they had only two choices. Both were painful.\n\nThey could all vote no. If the Senate Democrats did this, the Republicans would not be able to get past the filibuster, and so the government would shut down. In this case, standing up to President Trump might have been a political victory for their base. But it wouldn’t play well with the rest of the country.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION\n\nThen the Democrats realized President Trump could cut more programs and reshape the bureaucracy even more under a shutdown scenario than he could if they passed the bill, which they thought already granted him too much power.\n\nSo, the choice for the Democrats became to pass a bill that gave President Trump more authority to cut government – or stop the bill and give him even more authority.\n\nPresident Trump, Speaker Johnson, and Majority Leader Thune played this round brilliantly and won a huge victory.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThey also proved that they could pass tax cuts, deregulation, and the other priorities on which President Trump and the Republicans campaigned on in 2024.\n\nThis was a big victory with huge implications for the future.",

        "content": "Aaron Rodgers may choose to retire from the NFL if he doesn't get his way in free agency, according to The Athletic.\n\nAs the former MVP reportedly considers offers from the New York Giants and Pittsburgh Steelers, he would prefer to sign with the Minnesota Vikings, according to the outlet.\n\nIf Rodgers doesn't get an offer from Minnesota, he may retire.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM\n\nThe Vikings have an opening for a veteran quarterback after last year's starter, Sam Darnold, signed with the Seattle Seahawks. However, Minnesota also has former Michigan national champion J.J. McCarthy, the team's first-round pick in the 2024 draft.\n\nRodgers, at 41 years old, is not considered a long-term solution for any team.\n\nFamed NFL agent Leigh Steinberg, who has negotiated contracts for multiple Hall of Fame quarterbacks, told Fox News Digital he envisions Minnesota as a \"positive fit\" for Rodgers at this stage in his career, especially due to McCarthy's presence as a potential protégé and the team being suited to win in the short-term.\n\n\"So, you need to have a situation where, because Aaron at best maybe plays another year, maybe plays another two years, but it's not a permanent solution, so it's a one- or two-year fix,\" Steinberg said. \"So, he could go to a team that's really good but just needs that last little piece to put them over the top, and he could mentor a younger quarterback.\"\n\nBRETT FAVRE IMPLORES AARON RODGERS TO SIGN WITH ONE SPECIFIC TEAM: ‘GOOD PLACE TO WIN’\n\nSteinberg also believes a team without a chance to win in the short term with no young quarterback on its roster would not be as good a fit. The Giants are a team that fits that mold. The Steelers may have had a winning record last season but aren't a shoo-in to be good again this year. They also don't have a young project quarterback.\n\n\"A team that's really dissatisfied with their quarterbacking that takes him wouldn't be as positive of a solution,\" Steinberg said.\n\nIf Rodgers does end up getting an offer from the Vikings and signing with them, he would follow a nearly identical career path to that of his Green Bay Packer predecessor, Brett Favre. Like Favre, Rodgers played the vast majority of his career with the Packers, winning a Super Bowl before being traded to the New York Jets. Favre then spent his final two years on the Vikings.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nFavre offered advice to Rodgers and encouraged him to sign with the Vikings during an interview on Fox News Channel's \"The Will Cain Show\" Tuesday.\n\n\"By all means, sign with them,\" Favre said. \"They got a really good football team. They're loaded at pretty much every position. They made it to the playoffs last year. They got a tremendous fan base, much like the Packers. If you get the opportunity, that's a good place to win.\n\n\"Of course, you gotta play the Packers then.\"",

        "content": "Moments after MSNBC fired Joy Reid, we asked the question, \"Who will replace her as the worst person in all of television?\" While the race was contentious, OutKick readers overwhelmingly voted for Sunny Hostin, the Regina George of \"The View.\"\n\nHostin bolstered her case on Friday, whining that she is \"stuck\" in Donald Trump's \"racist\" America. She claims she would like to move out of the country, but can't.\n\n\"We’re pretty racist,\" Hostin said of the state of America. \"It’s a pretty young democracy that doesn’t seem to be working right now, and so I do think it doesn’t seem to be working for everyone, and I think that’s Rosie O’Donnell’s prerogative, and that’s her point. It doesn’t work for her family and she is one of the few people that can pick her life up and move it somewhere. Most of us are stuck here.\"\n\nHostin references former comedian Rosie O’Donnell’s recent move to Ireland, vowing to stay out of America until \"all citizens have equal rights.\" What citizens don't have equal rights here? Unfortunately, O’Donnell never specified.\n\nHere is Hostin:\n\nOf course, Hostin is gaslighting her viewers. She doesn't actually want to leave America. ABC News currently pays her around $8 million a year to co-host a panel show, in which she faces no accountability for her inaccuracies or bigotry.\n\nEven when Joy Reid still had a television show, Hostin wasn't far behind her in terms of spewing hateful, often racist rhetoric.\n\nIn November, Hostin responded to Trump's victory by calling Latino men \"sexist,\" white women \"uneducated,\" America \"deeply racist,\" black Republicans an \"oxymoron,\" and conservative white women \"roaches.\"\n\nABC News did not respond to a request for comment about Hostin's comments after the election.\n\nShe also recently claimed that America treats black people similar to how China treats Muslim Uyghurs, whom the government is committing genocide against.\n\nOutKick founder Clay Travis recently declared Hostin \"the Michael Jordan of awfulness.\"\n\nHard to argue.\n\nNot to encourage anyone to consider a move to Ireland, but there is no equivalent to \"The View\" there. And Hostin wouldn't give up her semi-celebrity status and seven-figure paycheck, even if she could move out of Trump's \"racist\" America.",

        "content": "An estimated 80% of women have some type of menopause symptoms — and the more symptoms they experience, the greater the chances of developing dementia later in life.\n\nThe findings were published in the journal PLOS One following a study by the University of Calgary.\n\nThe researchers analyzed the data of 896 postmenopausal women who participated in the Canadian Platform for Research Online to Investigate Health, Quality of Life, Cognition, Behaviour, Function, and Caregiving in Aging (CAN-PROTECT) study.\n\n4 KEY WOMEN'S HEALTH ISSUES THAT HAVE BEEN NEGLECTED, EXPERT SAYS\n\nThe women reported their perimenopausal symptoms to researchers. Their cognitive function was measured using the Everyday Cognition (ECog-II) Scale and the Mild Behavioral Impairment Checklist (MBI-C), with higher scores indicating greater severity.\n\nThose with greater menopausal symptoms had higher scores for both cognitive tests, indicating more severe decline.\n\n\"One of the most interesting findings was the association between menopausal symptom burden and mild behavioral impairment (MBI) symptoms — a syndrome increasingly recognized as an early indicator of dementia risk,\" lead study author Zahinoor Ismail, M.D., professor of psychiatry, neurology, epidemiology and pathology at the University of Calgary, told Fox News Digital.\n\n\"These novel findings highlight the need to consider not only cognitive changes, but also mood, social interaction and personality changes that emerge and persist in later life following menopause.\"\n\n\"These novel findings highlight the need to consider not only cognitive changes, but also mood, social interaction and personality changes.\"\n\nWhile hormone therapy was not significantly associated with cognitive function, it was shown to have a significant link to fewer MBI symptoms, according to the researchers, emphasizing the need for further research into the potential role of hormone therapy in long-term brain health.\n\n\"Interestingly, participants who reported using estrogen-based hormone therapy during perimenopause had significantly lower mild behavioral impairment symptom severity,\" noted Ismail.\n\nAlexa Fiffick, a board-certified family medicine physician specializing in menopause, stated that previous data has shown higher symptom burden is somehow related to decreased cognitive function and possibly dementia.\n\nSome studies have shown that even when hot flashes aren't perceived by the woman, they are still associated with worsened cognitive function, according to the Ohio doctor.\n\nTESTOSTERONE THERAPY COULD HELP BOOST WOMEN'S SEX DRIVE AS THEY AGE, BUT RISKS EXIST, EXPERTS SAY\n\n\"It is believed that the vasomotor symptoms are correlated with development of white matter hyperintensities in the brain, akin to what vascular dementia looks like on imaging,\" Fiffick, who was not involved in the new study, told Fox News Digital.\n\n\"We have yet to obtain the data that treating VMS will prevent cognitive decline, but are hopeful that with menopausal hormone therapy and other non-hormonal options, we may be able to obtain this data in the near future.\"\n\nPotential limitations\n\nThe researchers acknowledged several limitations of the study.\n\n\"This study is cross-sectional, meaning it captures a snapshot in time rather than tracking changes over the years,\" Ismail told Fox News Digital.\n\nThis means it can only identify associations between menopause symptoms and cognitive and behavioral health, but cannot determine whether the symptoms directly cause the changes in brain health.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR HEALTH NEWSLETTER\n\n\"To better understand the long-term impact of menopause on dementia risk, future research should follow participants over time and incorporate biological data, such as hormone levels and brain-related biomarkers (we are, in fact, doing this now),\" Ismail added.\n\nThe study also did not assess the severity of the symptoms, which could play a key role in understanding risk.\n\nAnother limitation is that the study focused on the most commonly reported menopause symptoms, but it’s possible that some participants experienced additional symptoms.\n\n\"In fact, it’s reported that there may be 30+ symptoms that females may experience when undergoing the menopause transition,\" said Ismail. \"While we included an ‘other symptoms’ category, it may not fully reflect the range of experiences.\"\n\nThe study also did not distinguish between different types and formulations of hormone therapy.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"Future studies will be able to explore whether specific types of HT have different effects on brain health,\" Ismail noted.\n\n\"Brain scans of women in menopause reveal real structural and metabolic changes, and this study reinforces that we can’t just brush these symptoms off as 'normal aging.'\"\n\nTamsen Fadal, a New York menopause expert and author of the upcoming book \"How to Menopause: Take Charge of Your Health, Reclaim Your Life, and Feel Even Better than Before,\" said she was not surprised by the results of the study.\n\n\"Research has been pointing to this connection for a while,\" she told Fox News Digital. \"Brain scans of women in menopause reveal real structural and metabolic changes, and this study reinforces that we can’t just brush these symptoms off as ‘normal aging.’\"\n\nFor more Health articles, visit www.foxnews.com/health\n\n\"For too long, women have been experiencing brain fog, memory lapses and mood changes, and many of us have been dismissed,\" Fadal went on.\n\n\"This research just reinforces that menopause is a neurological shift as much as it is a hormonal one.\"",

This program has been a pillar of support for marine research, sustainability, and economic growth for more than 50 years. The forum floors filled with tears and fears as if everyone were drowning, and we were,\" Hudson wrote in a separate recent post.\n\n\"The decision only amplified the uncertainty, anxiety and existential fears that already plague the fisherman of Maine.\"\n\nThis upcoming football season will be Belichick’s first as a college football head coach. The 72-year-old will lead the North Carolina Tar Heels after parting ways with the New England Patriots after the 2023 season after a run that included six Super Bowl victories.\n\nHudson will reportedly be involved in Belichick's operation of the team after he instructed that she be copied on all emails sent to him, according to an email leaked by The Assembly.",

        "title": "Trump admin makes Asheville remove ‘DEI’ language to access hurricane relief aid",
        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "The Trump administration recently denied a funding request from the city of Asheville, North Carolina, to help its recovery from Hurricane Helene, telling the city it must cut a program meant to aid female and minority contractors. The mayor said the city has cut the reference to the program and now expects the plan to win approval.\n\nDuring the presidential campaign, Trump repeatedly used the devastation Helene wrought on North Carolina to spread lies and conspiracy theories about the Biden administration’s recovery efforts. In a speech in January, Trump claimed he’d be “taking strong action to get North Carolina the support that you need to quickly recover and rebuild,” and he specifically named Asheville as “a great place, and we’re going to have it be a great place again.”\n\n“Strong action” apparently comes with some strings attached. Because on Monday, Trump’s secretary for the Department of Housing and Urban Development, Scott Turner, denounced Asheville’s 125-page funding plan because of one line, in a section touting the plan’s benefits for vulnerable populations, that said some of the funds to support small businesses would help the city “prioritize assistance for Minority and Women Owned Businesses (MWBE) within the scoring criteria outlined within the policies and procedures.”\n\n“Once again, let me be clear DEI is dead at HUD,” said Turner in a statement. “We will not provide funding to any program or grantee that does not comply with President Trump’s executive orders.”\n\nNow, let me be clear: Nothing in the plan suggested women- and minority-owned businesses would be the sole — or the even primary — beneficiaries of any federal funding Asheville receives. The plan merely listed the program as one of many that could provide aid. But as I reported last February, many white conservatives have framed programs that help minority business owners, who often require assistance to counter discrimination they’ve longed faced from private industries, as discriminatory against white people.\n\nOn Tuesday, Asheville Mayor Ester Manheimer said Asheville, like many cities, “has a program around contracting with minority- and women-owned businesses,” adding, “Apparently, the reference to that existing program is not something that they want to see in the action plan.”\n\nThe next day, she said, “We have modified the action plan to reflect [Turner’s] concerns, and we’ve been told the changes that we’ve made were acceptable.”\n\nThis rigamarole raises serious concerns about how Los Angeles County might expect to navigate its need for recovery funds after the recent wildfires, especially because much of the damage ravaged historically Black communities like Altadena, where residents have already expressed fears of being erased in the recovery efforts.\n\nAs HUD secretary, Turner has moved quickly to remake the agency in Trump’s image. Last week, I wrote about HUD’s reported invitation to Christian nationalist Sean Feucht to help the agency survey damage from the L.A. County fires. Feucht declared he’d been brought along to offer “advice” and “give divine perspective” on recovery efforts. An agency spokesperson told MSNBC that Feucht doesn’t have an “official role” with HUD and refused to answer whether he’s offering guidance in an unofficial role.\n\nThe Trump administration seems eager to use disaster recovery funding to bring communities to heel and force its political will on left-leaning local governments that may not otherwise accept it.",

        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "“Can you explain what SCOTUS can do about birthright citizenship when it’s in the Constitution? How are they able to overturn the 14th Amendment?”\n\n— Peggy Giegucz, Pittsburgh\n\nHi Peggy,\n\nThe Supreme Court can’t overturn a constitutional amendment. But it can interpret the Constitution to make it seem like it’s overturning or at least contorting it. In other words, when the court hears an appeal involving the Constitution, it analyzes how it applies in a given case — whether that's what the First Amendment means for speech, the Second Amendment means for guns, and so on. Throughout the court’s history, dissenting justices have accused majorities of construing constitutional provisions contrary to their meaning and purpose.\n\nWhen it comes to birthright citizenship, we might soon learn what the justices have to say about that provision of the 14th Amendment: “All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.” Cases on the subject are making their way through the nation’s courts. So far, judges have roundly rejected the Trump administration. Just this week, a three-judge panel of the Boston-based federal appeals court handed the government its latest loss, after appellate panels based in San Francisco and Richmond likewise declined to lift trial court rulings against the administration while it appeals.\n\nOn Thursday, Trump asked the justices to halt the nationwide scope of those trial court rulings, which are keeping his policy on hold nationwide. To be sure, the justices could resolve this pending appeal without weighing in on the ultimate question of what they think the 14th Amendment protects. But how they address Trump’s procedural challenge could provide clues about how they would decide the underlying merits of his executive order.\n\nIf the Supreme Court eventually rules — contrary to longstanding precedent and historical evidence — that the Constitution doesn’t protect birthright citizenship, then whether the court would be literally overturning the 14th Amendment as opposed to gutting, betraying or undermining it could be a semantic argument, given how difficult it is to further amend the Constitution.\n\nIn theory, of course, the people and their elected representatives can vote to amend the Constitution in response to an unpopular Supreme Court ruling. In fact, the 14th Amendment did just that, effectively overturning the infamous Dred Scott ruling that affirmed slavery. But even if Americans somehow passed a new constitutional amendment making birthright citizenship clearer than it already is, the Supreme Court could attempt to undermine it through a creative interpretation.\n\nHave any questions or comments for me?

        "title": "Hazing death of Caleb Wilson at Southern University echoes Black Greek life pattern",
        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "In 2004, I was hired for the first time as an expert witness in a hazing death. Based on my experience advising fraternities and sororities, along with my research on these groups and career as an emerging leader in academia, the legal team thought I had expertise that would complement their legal training.\n\nThat case proved to be just the beginning. Over the ensuing decades, I have worked over two dozen hazing cases and been asked to work on another two dozen. I worked on the tragic case of two women who died pledging Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority in the early 2000s, and the high-profile death of a band drum major at Florida A&M University in 2011.\n\nWhen the news of 20-year-old Southern University and A&M College student Caleb Wilson’s death was first reported at the end of February, my instincts were activated.\n\nAfter a while, you start to see patterns develop. I look for artifacts that show these patterns, aided now by social media’s historical record. I closely examine depositions. And I look at the ages of the accused.\n\nWhen the news of 20-year-old Southern University and A&M College student Caleb Wilson’s death was first reported at the end of February, my instincts were activated. According to reports, the young man was pledging Omega Psi Phi fraternity, but ended up dumped at a nearby hospital by a group of men who claimed he had been injured playing basketball. Staff at the hospital called the police, who later told reporters Wilson died “as a direct result of a hazing incident where he was punched in the chest multiple times.\"\n\nThe circumstances reminded me of the 1994 death of Michael Davis at Southeast Missouri State. His Kappa Alpha Psi “brothers” only called 911 the next morning, when they found him unresponsive with a greenish black liquid coming from his mouth. The official story, which quickly fell apart, was that Davis had been hurt playing football. In reality, Davis had been brutally beaten to death.\n\nThe first person arrested in Caleb Wilson’s case, an undergraduate student, was listed as 23. Several days later, a 25-year-old student was also arrested. The final suspect is a 28-year-old graduate student who, according to reports, served as Wilson's dean of pledges.\n\nI was not surprised. Rather, this awful tragedy reaffirms for me a consistent problem in Black Greek-lettered undergraduate organizations. I worked a hazing case in 2006 in which a young man almost died after drinking excessive amounts of water. The ringleader in that tragedy was 28 years old. And the whole time I was thinking, “Why is this guy even involved in an undergraduate activity?\" Indeed, I’ve examined several years of cases where at least one of the suspects arrested was in the 24- to 30-year-old range. I call these individuals “extended adolescents,” and they pose a particularly alarming risk to college campus safety.\n\nIn Wilson’s case, it seems two of the suspects were still undergraduate students. But I've often found extended adolescents to be graduated undergraduates or grad students, unemployed or underemployed. They are extending their adolescence through their presence on campus.\n\nThis group has become a serious problem for Black fraternities and sororities. They are often invisible. They may be too old to be in the undergraduate chapter, and the official leaders of the organizations may not know them. They have not matured enough to engage with their adult peers and instead cling to their “old head” status and seek the respect of younger students.\n\nThey remind me of Peter Pan, the boy who wouldn’t grow up, leading their lost boy pledges down a potentially deadly path.\n\nCaleb Wilson. Southern University and A&M College, Baton Rouge, La.\n\nCampus leaders, chapter advisors and national organizations must often and openly signal that extended adolescents have no place leading, officially or unofficially, undergraduate chapters. Their presence on campus is a warning signal. Administrators ignore it at their peril.\n\nHigher education must also work with high schools and middle schools to begin routine anti-hazing campaigns all year round. And despite the many horror stories, many high school students come to college having already experienced hazing. Schools should partner with groups like the Ad Council to make sure anti-hazing messages are as routine as warnings about drugs and alcohol.\n\nOn Friday, Caleb Wilson will be honored on the Southern University campus with a celebration of life. “He was a bright light in Jaguar Nation, a dedicated scholar, and a proud member of the world-renowned Human Jukebox,” school Chancellor John K. Pierre said in a statement. “Caleb Wilson’s kindness, passion, and unwavering spirit left a lasting impact on all who had the privilege of knowing him. As we mourn this tremendous loss, we also come together to celebrate his life and legacy with his family.”\n\nWilson’s friends and family will also likely be wondering what justice looks like in this case. Louisiana has one of the toughest hazing laws in the nation, a change enacted after the hazing death of a young man named Max Gruver in 2017. That means that if found guilty, the suspects in Wilson’s killing will likely be punished to the maximum extent possible. They should become the new poster boys for what happens when these rituals turn deadly.\n\nWe still do not have all the facts in Wilson's case, but what we do know still feels all too familiar. At an anti-hazing presentation I gave in 2011, this appeared on a slide: “If these people (extended adolescents) are at sessions, you are in danger — they kill people.” Almost 15 years later, I fear that statement is unfortunately still true.",

        "title": "Angry and erratic: Trump Cabinet official admits the president is acting on emotion in trade war",
        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "This is an adapted excerpt from the March 13 episode of “All In with Chris Hayes.”\n\nThe president of the United States, the man with the nuclear codes, is angry, emotional and acting erratically. That’s not my judgment — it’s basically what his own Cabinet defenders are saying.\n\nOn Thursday, Donald Trump’s Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick joined Bloomberg Television to talk about how the president is shocked that the trade war he launched against America’s closest allies, Canada and the European Union, is suddenly blowing up in his face.\n\nAll of this is happening for literally no reason whatsoever other than the fact Trump is picking a fight with our neighbors.\n\n“The president was totally annoyed that the Europeans did this,” Lutnick said. “He cares about America, and he wants to take care of Americans. And why are Europeans picking on Kentucky bourbon, Harley-Davidson motorcycles?” When Lutnick was asked if this was an “emotional response” from the president, he called the E.U.’s move “disrespectful.”\n\n“He wants these countries to respect him, and all of this showed you is that Europe and Canada do not respect Donald Trump,” Lutnick added. “If you make him unhappy, he responds unhappy.”\n\nOn Wall Street, stocks continue to fall amid fears of higher prices from Trump’s tariffs and threats. The S&P 500 fell 10% below its all-time high on Thursday, raising concerns among investors that a sell-off might be happening soon. The Nasdaq is already in that worrying territory. The Dow Jones was on track for its worst week since that string of high-profile bank failures in 2023.\n\nAll of this is happening for literally no reason whatsoever, other than the fact Trump is picking a fight with our neighbors. Now that our neighbors are fighting back, Trump is big mad, throwing out new threats of massive tariffs and annexation of foreign territories.\n\nIn a vicious cycle of escalation, Canada and the E.U. responded to Trump’s tariffs by imposing new taxes on U.S. exports, including on signature American products like, as Lutnick mentioned, whiskey and motorcycles. When Trump heard about that retaliation, he basically lost it and made an unhinged post on Truth Social:\n\nThe European Union, one of the most hostile and abusive taxing and tariffing authorities in the World, which was formed for the sole purpose of taking advantage of the United States, has just put a nasty 50% Tariff on Whisky. If this Tariff is not removed immediately, the U.S. will shortly place a 200% Tariff on all WINES, CHAMPAGNES, & ALCOHOLIC PRODUCTS COMING OUT OF FRANCE AND OTHER E.U. REPRESENTED COUNTRIES. This will be great for the Wine and Champagne businesses in the U.S.\n\nNow, to be clear, the U.S. does not technically have any Champagne businesses, but we are the biggest market for Champagne and many other French wines. Trump is threatening a tax at such a high level that the price of a bottle of wine would essentially double for Americans. Everybody who understands trade understands this is insane. I think even people who don’t understand trade understand this is insane.\n\nIt was a point that even Emma Tucker, the editor-in-chief of the right-leaning Wall Street Journal, made on Thursday. “[The] mood has shifted pretty much since all the tariffs started coming in,” Tucker said on Fox Business. “I think businesses realize now Trump is serious about this, but the problem they’ve got is that they’re being imposed in a very haphazard way, and that’s creating so much instability.” When asked if companies would pass costs on to consumers, Tucker said “eventually they’re gonna have to.”\n\nAn hour after that interview, Trump posted to Truth Social again:\n\nThe Globalist Wall Street Journal has no idea what they are doing or saying. They are owned by the polluted thinking of the European Union, which was formed for the primary purpose of ‘screwing’ the United States of America. Their (WSJ!) thinking is antiquated and weak, and very bad for the USA.\n\nLater in the White House, sitting next to the secretary-general of NATO, Trump took a question about his tariffs and started musing, yet again, about the territorial conquest of Canada, a fellow NATO member. Trump also talked about annexing Greenland from Denmark.\n\nAll in all, the American president spent his day annoyed and emotional about the trade war he started, and then obsessed some more about making Canada and Greenland part of America. All while CEOs, investors and regular people are absolutely freaking out about the economy.\n\nAnd it looks like no one is going to stop him — at least, certainly not Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who tried and failed to put a positive spin on this unfolding economic disaster. During an interview on CNBC on Thursday, Bessent said the Trump administration was “focused on the real economy.”\n\n“I’m not concerned about a little bit of volatility over three weeks,” Bessent said. “The reason stocks are a safe and great investment is because you’re looking over the long term. If you start looking at micro-horizons, stocks become very risky.”\n\nIt’s gotten so bad that even Tesla, the electric car company owned by Trump’s unelected co-president Elon Musk, is worried about the impact of tariffs on its bottom line. In an unsigned letter, the company warned Trump’s trade representatives that the president’s trade war would make it more expensive to build cars in America.\n\nOne person familiar with the process of sending the letter told the Financial Times: “It’s a polite way to say that the bipolar tariff regime is screwing over Tesla.” The person added: “It is unsigned because nobody at the company wants to be fired for sending it.”",

        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "On Tuesday, press secretary Karoline Leavitt repeated one of the White House’s favorite talking points about President Donald Trump’s trade war. After reporters questioned Leavitt about his repeated promises on the campaign trail to lower taxes for everyday Americans, the press secretary said the president is “not implementing tax hikes.” She told reporters Trump’s tariffs were a “tax hike on foreign countries” and a “tax cut for the American people.”\n\nRepublican Sen. Markwayne Mullin of Oklahoma contradicted the press secretary’s claim. “Tariffs is a tax, and it will be passed on consumers,” Mullin told CNN.\n\nLeavitt is either ignorant about how tariffs work or purposely dishonest — either way, imposing them still leads the United States down the same dangerous economic path. Almost every economist will tell you that tariffs make nations less prosperous. During Trump’s first term, studies showed that his tariffs hurt consumers. This time around, his proposals are much more far-reaching, which means potentially even larger negative economic impacts for everyday Americans.\n\nBut don’t take my word for it. On Wednesday, Republican Sen. Markwayne Mullin of Oklahoma contradicted the press secretary’s claim. “Tariffs is a tax, and it will be passed on consumers,” Mullin told CNN. Mullin then said this is a fact the president is well aware of, “something that the president, who is a businessperson, understands that completely.”\n\nThe Trump administration’s repeated public denial of basic economics isn’t the only way the White House is trying to spin the president’s trade war. During Wednesday’s briefing, Leavitt again deflected blame over the economy on former President Joe Biden. But the facts tell a different story: Trump inherited a historically strong economy.\n\nSo no matter what the White House tries to say, this is not Biden’s fault. The previous president handed Trump a strong post-pandemic economy that was the envy of the world and now, the United States is the embarrassment of the world. Trump owns that — and he owns the disastrous impact his trade war will have on American consumers, as does every other Republican who touches his administration.",

        "content": "Just more than a dozen years ago, Republicans' talking point was that the president of the United States should not have promoted a politically connected but troubled company.\n\nWhen Barack Obama ran for re-election in 2012, GOP lawmakers seized on the catchphrase \"crony capitalism\" to bash him for giving a speech to workers at a solar panel manufacturing plant run by Solyndra, which had received a loan guarantee under his economic stimulus program.\n\nAfter the company went bankrupt, Republicans argued that records showed the loan guarantee was rushed (true) and the company was backed by Obama donors (mostly false).\n\nNow, in President Donald Trump’s administration, crony capitalism isn't an attack line; it's the plan.\n\nOn Tuesday, Trump sidled up to a shiny red Tesla Model S in front of the White House, clutching a handwritten note that said you could drive off in one today for “as low as $299/month.” The goal was to boost the company run by his biggest donor, billionaire federal contractor and special government employee Elon Musk, after its stock dramatically collapsed because of an ongoing boycott, uncertainty from Trump's trade wars and poor sales of its ungainly Cybertruck.\n\nTrump even wrote a check right there for the $80,000 car and said he would buy one for his 17-year-old granddaughter.\n\nPresident Donald Trump holds notes on the pricing of Tesla vehicles as he delivers remarks on the South Lawn of the White House on Tuesday. Andrew Harnik / Getty Images\n\nIf a social media influencer had posted a video like this, the Federal Trade Commission might require it to come with the hashtag #sponsored and an admission that it was a paid promotion. This was \"sponcon\" on the White House lawn, to use the shorthand term for sponsored content. And it was crony capitalism for the richest person on the planet, whose wealth happens to be tied up in Tesla stock.\n\nTo be clear, presidents have long promoted American businesses. Teddy Roosevelt supposedly coined the Maxwell House ad slogan \"good to the last drop\" after having a cup, and Joe Biden once took a Ford F-150 Lightning for a spin, saying \"this sucker's quick.\" (Sadly, the Ford Motor Co. did not pick that up as a slogan.)\n\nBut neither Maxwell House nor Ford executives worked in the White House. Neither made massive donations to a presidential campaign. Trump was trying to help his top political ally by using the White House as a backdrop for free advertising, like some President's Day car sale come to life.\n\nIn fact, the closest precedent in U.S. history comes from Trump's first term, when he posted a photo giving two thumbs up from the Resolute Desk in the Oval Office with cans of Goya beans and other products in front of him. In that case, too, the president was trying to boost a company facing a boycott over its association with him, as Goya's CEO was in hot water for having praised Trump.\n\nAt least in that case, we know that Trump actually likes taco bowls. But this week's commercial for Tesla came after years of bashing electric cars, which he has said will leave you stranded in the desert, \"cost a fortune\" and are only \"good if you have a towing company.\" He'd even specifically lambasted Teslas in the past, saying they \"don't drive long enough\" and the self-driving options \"crash.\"\n\nBeyond just the cheap sales pitch, Trump had some chilling words that portend an even more serious effort to shore up Tesla. During the event, Trump ramped up his response to the spate of vandalism against Teslas in recent weeks, saying that \"violence against Tesla dealership will be labeled as domestic terrorism\" and that any vandals who are caught are \"going to go through hell\" for \"harming a great American company.\"\n\nTrump said that \"radical left lunatics\" are \"illegally and collusively\" boycotting Tesla.\n\nAnd in a Truth Social post Tuesday, Trump said that \"radical left lunatics\" are \"illegally and collusively\" boycotting Tesla.\n\nIn Trump's first administration, his staffers would have interpreted these comments as hot air. In his second, they're far more likely to treat them as marching orders. His hyperpartisan acting U.S. attorney in D.C. has already threatened a private university for its diversity policies and a U.S. senator for a mildly inappropriate comment made years ago. And Trump now has a Justice Department that he hopes to turn into his own personal law firm.\n\nFor now, it is still legal to exercise your First Amendment right to protest Tesla or simply refuse to buy its products. Ill-advised vandals will still be charged with misdemeanors in state court, not federal felonies that can carry a sentence of up to life in prison. And Tesla is still a private company that just happens to be owned by the president's BFF, not the recipient of its own massive federal contract.\n\nBut we'll see how long that lasts, and whether any Republicans who lambasted Obama's supposed \"crony capitalism\" want to stop the real version that's happening right in front of them.",

        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "The Trump administration has sent a letter to Columbia University’s interim president and board of trustees that includes a list of demands the school must meet if it wants the administration to reverse its cancellation of $400 million in federal funds Columbia was authorized to receive.\n\nThe letter, sent Thursday, is an ultimatum that demands Columbia make changes and impose policies to align it with the MAGA movement’s political views. It is essentially a ransom note, outlining steps Columbia must take “as a precondition for formal negotiations” on restoring the millions in government funding the university had been awarded.\n\nAmong the steps the administration demands is that Columbia place its Middle East, South Asian and African Studies Department under academic receivership, which would effectively give control over the program to a chair outside of Columbia’s faculty — a move that smacks of textbook racism. But the administration’s list of demands goes much further, requiring that Columbia:\n\nhand out expulsions or multiyear suspensions to demonstrators who participated in pro-Palestinian protests inside Hamilton Hall last year. (The university appears to have already taken steps in this direction.)\n\nabolish its University Judicial Board and “centralize all disciplinary processes,” including expulsions and suspensions, under the university president.\n\nban masks “intended to conceal identity or intimidate others,” and require any masked individuals to display their Columbia ID.\n\nadopt a controversial definition of antisemitism the administration formally adopted in Trump’s first term and has revived in his second.\n\ninstitute “time, place, and manner rules,” which are basically restrictions around protests.\n\n“empower” its security with “full law enforcement authority,” including authorizing the “arrest and removal of agitators” who foster an “unsafe or hostile work or study environment.”\n\ndevelop a “plan” to investigate and punish student groups “engaged in violations of University policy” — like some forms of protest, perhaps.\n\n“reform” its admissions processes, which as already undergone homogenizing changes in response to the Supreme Court’s ruling against racially conscious admissions policies.\n\nRead the administration's letter below:\n\nThe executive director of Columbia’s Knight First Amendment Institute, Jameel Jaffer, condemned the letter as part of an effort to \"subjugate universities to official power” in a statement on Friday.\n\nThis authoritarian power-grab at Columbia aligns with a broader conservative push to impose its political will on American universities, which Vice President JD Vance has previously called “the enemy.” The Trump administration recently opened dozens of investigations into universities it claims are running diversity programs that discriminate against white and Asian students.\n\nAnd the administration recently arrested and is attempting to deport Mahmoud Khalil, a legal U.S. resident and Columbia University student who engaged in the pro-Palestinian demonstrations on campus last year.\n\nTrump’s administration is treating American campuses, which foster curiosity and independent thought, just as his vice president described them — as the enemy. In this culture war, it appears as though Columbia University is going to be the administration’s first hostage.",

        "title": "Why ICE arresting Mahmoud Khalil should worry all Americans",
        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "Even though I have criticized anti-Zionist campus activism for relentlessly obstructing the core mission of American institutions of higher education, the arrest and potential deportation of Mahmoud Khalil, a Palestinian activist at Columbia University, makes me uneasy. Khalil was arrested by Immigration and Customs Enforcement in New York City on Saturday and transported to an ICE detention facility in Louisiana. The charges against him are, at this moment, vague.\n\nThe arrest and potential deportation of Mahmoud Khalil makes me uneasy.\n\nSocial media posts from President Donald Trump and comments from White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt and Secretary of State Marco Rubio suggest Khalil is a national security threat. Though she didn’t provide proof of her claim, Leavitt said of Khalil, “This is an individual who organized group protests that not only disrupted college campus classes and harassed Jewish American students and made them feel unsafe on their own content, but also distributed pro-Hamas propaganda, flyers with the logo of Hamas.” A social media post from the Department of Homeland Security says Khalil “led activities tied to Hamas, a designated terrorist organization.”My queasiness at the government’s response to Khalil’s activism and the vagueness of the accusations against him is shared by other liberal Jewish Americans. They constitute a large segment of the Jewish American population, one that President Trump has accused of hating Israel, hating themselves and being “disloyal.” Trump also said last year that if he lost the presidential election, liberal Jews would be partially to blame. And just Thursday, Trump became a gentile rabbinical court unto himself by proclaiming Sen. Chuck Schumer to not be a Jew.\n\nLiberal Jews, I would note, have reacted to Khalil’s arrest in broadly similar ways. Many disagree with, and deplore, Khalil’s leadership role in a Columbia anti-Israel movement whose actions ranged from incendiary rhetoric to the forcible occupation of university grounds. Yet they generally see his arrest as an existential threat to the FirstAmendment, academicinstitutions and the general health of Americandemocracy.Liberal Jewish Americans, like all of their compatriots, have a right to know if the allegations against Khalil are valid. If, for example, the government can provide evidence that Khalil has aided or abetted a terrorist group, then the government’s actions are, in my opinion, likely justified. If they are not — and they presently appear not to be — then Khalil's arrest would seem to represent a threat to the civil liberties of everybody in America.\n\nLet me acknowledge that the more I read about the legal issues involved in Khalil's arrest, the murkier the case becomes. Is the murkiness a coincidence? That the administration pursued this action against this particular person with this particular citizenship status points to the under-discussed ingenuity of Trump’s legal teams. They have consistently displayed an uncanny ability to find gray areas within the law and resurrect mothballed edicts. Remember the Trump administration’s invocation of the 1807 Insurrection Act? The 1798 Alien Enemies Act? The 1873 Comstock Act?\n\nLiberal Jewish-Americans, like all of their compatriots, have a right to know if the allegations against Khalil are valid\n\nKhalil is not an American citizen. He possesses a green card and is married to an American citizen. Does his status as a legal permanent resident in any way diminish his free speech rights compared to a full citizen? According to some scholars, the law here is murky. In other words, the government’s interpretation of how free speech rights intersect with citizenship status may be unusual but legally permissible (and that is where the aforementioned murky ingenuity of Trump’s counselors enters this saga). Aside from the discussions regarding national security and immigration status, the arrest of Khalil raises significant free speech concerns. What kind of speech is in question? I’d be the first to insist that slogans, chants, flyers and other such effusions are not instances of protected academic free speech. That’s a form of specialized discourse which is generally monitored and regulated by institutions of higher education. Academic free speech is associated with complex credentialing mechanisms that are almost uniquely reserved for professors, which Khalil is not.\n\nBut based on what we know, Khalil’s political speech is constitutionally protected. In America, we have a robust right to say offensive, mean things that infuriate others. One of the fears raised by the government’s actions is that sometime soon — like really soon — the administration will round up other people whose speech it abhors. Might the “disloyal” Jews who the president believed nearly cost him the election fall into that category? Liberal Jewish Americans are an evergreen target of the MAGA movement. They are also a target of Jews with markedly different politics than their own — like leftist anti-Zionists and right-wing supporters of Trump and Benjamin Netanyahu. Still, there is something very American about their response to this crisis. Many are disregarding whatever personal feelings they may have about Khalil’s anti-Zionism in the name of broader national ideals.\n\nThere are Palestinian Americans who seem inclined to establish similar degrees of critical distance and put America first, so to speak. They call for calm, pragmatism, dialogue and reasoned analysis. For all hyphenated Americans traumatized by this piteous endless conflict, this might be the sanest, most patriotic way forward.",

        "title": "Republicans might not realize just how unpopular Elon Musk is",
        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "Republican Rep. Tony Gonzales of Texas appeared on CNN earlier this week and had nothing but positive things to say about Elon Musk and the quasi-governmental Department of Government Efficiency. “I think it’s good for us to have this dialogue,” the GOP congressman said. “DOGE is very popular in my district.”\n\nA day earlier, The Associated Press reported that Republican Rep. Richard Hudson, the chair of the National Republican Congressional Committee, expressed great optimism about the 2026 election cycle — because, the North Carolinian said, “The cuts pushed by the Department of Government Efficiency are resonating with voters.”\n\nThere’s a whole lot of evidence to the contrary. Consider the latest national poll from Quinnipiac University, which included a summary of public attitudes about Donald Trump’s biggest campaign donor and his radical DOGE endeavor.\n\nSixty percent of voters disapprove of the way Elon Musk and the Department of Government Efficiency, known as DOGE, are dealing with workers employed by the federal government, while 36 percent approve. ... Fifty-four percent of voters think Elon Musk and DOGE are hurting the country, while 40 percent think they are helping the country.\n\nThe day before the Quinnipiac data was released, a national CNN poll conducted by SSRS found that Americans’ attitudes toward Musk “are largely negative.”\n\nJust 35% of Americans express a positive view of Musk, with 53% rating him negatively. ... Roughly 6 in 10 Americans say that Musk has neither the right experience nor the right judgment to make changes to the way the government works. There is uneasiness about Musk even among some of the president’s supporters: 28% of those who see Trump’s changes to the government as necessary doubt the tech billionaire has the judgment to carry them out.\n\nThis comes on the heels of a Washington Post/Ipsos poll that found the billionaire Republican megadonor with a 34% approval rating. (For more information on the surveys’ methodologies and margins of error, click on any of the above links.)\n\nThe obvious response to results like these is that public attitudes toward Musk are of limited relevance. He is not an elected official; his name will probably never appear on a ballot; and he need not worry about re-election. Perhaps, the argument goes, he has the luxury of indifference when it comes to the prevailing political winds.\n\nThe closer one looks, however, the harder it is to believe this argument. Even putting aside the likelihood that Musk’s popularity (or lack thereof) will affect his business empire and its stockholders, the more politically salient point is that Republicans’ interests have suddenly become intertwined with the DOGE initiative — which necessarily means that as his public standing sinks, Musk is likely to drag his GOP allies down with him.\n\nAll of which brings us back to the NRCC chair, who apparently believes “the cuts pushed by the Department of Government Efficiency are resonating with voters.” My follow-up questions for Hudson are simple:\n\nAre you sure? Are you willing to bet your party’s near-future on those assumptions?",

        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "A Texas family on their way to an emergency medical check-up for their 10-year-old daughter, who is recovering from brain cancer, was detained by immigration authorities and hastily deported to Mexico last month.\n\nIn early February, Customs and Border Protection stopped the family at an immigration checkpoint while they were traveling from Rio Grande, Texas, where they lived, to Houston, where their daughter’s specialists are located — a trip the family had made at least five other times before without incident, according to an attorney representing the family.\n\nDuring their previous trips, the undocumented parents of the 10-year-old, who is a U.S. citizen, were allowed through the checkpoint after presenting authorities with letters from lawyers and their daughter’s doctors. This time, however, authorities deemed those letters insufficient and arrested the parents for not providing proper documentation. The family’s attorney said the parents have no criminal history.\n\nIn addition to the 10-year-old girl, four other children, all but one born in the U.S., were in the car with the parents when they were detained. The parents were then forced to make a difficult decision: Return to Mexico as a family, or leave their children behind in the U.S. As NBC News reports, that’s hardly a choice:\n\n[U]ndocumented parents of U.S.-born children, if picked up by immigration authorities, face the risk of losing custody of their children. Without a power-of-attorney document or a guardianship outlining who will take care of the children left behind, the children go into the U.S. foster care system, making it harder for the parents to regain custody of their children in the future.\n\nThe family ultimately decided to remain together.\n\nThe 10-year-old girl was diagnosed with brain cancer last year and recently underwent surgery to remove the tumor. Doctors in Houston have been closely monitoring her recovery.\n\nAfter the family was detained, the mother, who spoke exclusively to NBC News, said authorities took the family to a detention center, where they separated her and her daughters from her husband and sons. Within hours, CBP agents loaded the family into a van and dropped them in Mexico.\n\nAfter spending time in a shelter, the family has moved into a house. However, according to the mother, her children are unable to sleep due to concerns about their safety, having been left in an area of Mexico where U.S. citizens are often kidnapped.\n\nThe 10-year-old isn’t the only member of the family who is being treated for a medical condition. The couple’s 15-year-old son has a heart disorder known as Long QT syndrome, which causes irregular heartbeats and can be life-threatening if not properly treated. The mother told NBC News both children are unable to receive the health care they need in Mexico.\n\nIn a post on X, the Congressional Hispanic Caucus called the family’s deportation “a new low” and said the Trump administration has “lost all humanity.”\n\nBefore Donald Trump took office, immigrant advocacy groups raised the alarm over how his mass deportation policies could affect mixed-status families (that is, families in which some members are undocumented while others are U.S. citizens). According to estimates from the American Immigration Council, as many as 4 million mixed-status families are at risk of being separated under Trump’s policies.\n\nWhen Trump’s border czar, Tom Homan, was asked in December how he would approach deporting mixed-status families, he told The Washington Post that the risk of separation was ultimately the fault of the parents.\n\n“Here’s the issue,” Homan said. “You knew you were in the country illegally and chose to have a child. So you put your family in that position.”",

        "content": "What exactly have Elon Musk and DOGE been up to? A new court ruling could help provide some answers.\n\nOn Wednesday, U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan granted a request for expedited discovery in a lawsuit brought by Democratic-led states challenging Musk’s and the Department of Government Efficiency’s authority. The plaintiff states are seeking “to identify DOGE personnel and the parameters of DOGE’s and Musk’s authority — a question central to Plaintiffs’ claims,” Chutkan wrote in an opinion explaining her decision.\n\nIf the judge’s name sounds familiar, she also presided over one of Donald Trump’s four criminal cases before he won the 2024 presidential election. In this current civil case, Chutkan emphasized in her ruling that the plaintiffs aren’t seeking information from Trump himself.\n\nThe discovery requests “shall be limited to information and materials regarding agencies, employees, contracts, grants, federal funding, legal agreements, databases, or data management systems that involve or engage with Plaintiff States, including entities and institutions operated or funded by Plaintiff States,” Chutkan wrote in her order. She said Musk and DOGE must produce the requested documents and respond to questions within three weeks.\n\nThe states wrote in their discovery motion that they want to “confirm what investigative reporting has already indicated”: that Musk and DOGE “are directing actions within federal agencies that have profoundly harmed the States and will continue to harm them.” The states also wrote that the government said Musk “is merely an advisor to the President, with no authority to direct agency action and no role at DOGE. The public record refutes that implausible assertion. But only Defendants possess the documents and information that Plaintiffs need to confirm public reporting and identify which agencies Defendants will target next so Plaintiffs can seek preliminary relief and mitigate further harm.”\n\nOpposing expedited discovery, the government defendants said the plaintiffs sought “extraordinary relief” and material that’s “not relevant to their claims.”\n\nAs to relevance, Chutkan noted in her ruling that the states want information regarding Musk’s and DOGE’s involvement in “(1) eliminating or reducing the size of federal agencies; (2) terminating or placing federal employees on leave; (3) cancelling, freezing, or pausing federal contracts, grants, or other federal funding; and (4) obtaining access, using, or making changes to federal databases or data management systems.” The judge wrote that evidence regarding the defendants’ elimination of agencies that work with the plaintiff states, termination of employees responsible for managing programs with the states, or cancellation of contracts with the states “is relevant to whether Defendants exceeded their statutory and constitutional authority.”\n\nChutkan had previously rejected the states’ bid for a temporary restraining order against Musk and DOGE. But the latest ruling is a reminder that the suit isn’t over yet.\n\nSubscribe to the Deadline: Legal Newsletter for expert analysis on the top legal stories of the week, including updates from the Supreme Court and developments in the Trump administration’s legal cases.",

        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "If Ukraine needs a wake-up call regarding how much agency it truly has, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s humiliating decision to sign the rare minerals deal, which would see America and Ukraine jointly extract valuable raw materials such as lithium and titanium, will do the trick. It’s hard to get more symbolic than watching the head of a client state get lambasted in the Oval Office, having the United States cut off sharing intelligence with his military, then shambling back over to his overseer to pay up.\n\nThere are, however, two underreported facets to this shameful episode that can help us understand the nature of both Washington and Ukraine. We can witness, in real time, the masks coming off of Washington’s foreign policy complex; we can also see why this particular betrayal is so traumatic and painful given Ukraine’s tragic history.\n\nWe can witness, in real time, the masks coming off of Washington’s foreign policy complex.\n\nThe refreshing thing about President Donald Trump is that he speaks the quiet part out loud. Politicians and think tankers who comprise Washington’s sprawling foreign policy establishment — “the Blob,” as it was called by Obama deputy national security adviser Ben Rhodes — love warbling about Ukraine’s battling on the front lines of freedom and Kyiv’s being our cherished partner, brimming with agency and sovereignty.\n\nTrump doesn’t warble. Trump, who loves harping on Europe’s needing to pay for its own security, has made it clear that freedom ain’t free: If Ukraine wants the weapons it needs to hold Russia at bay, it better cough up its minerals.\n\nThe thing is, when it comes to looting Ukraine, the Blob is little different from Trump. Foreign policy insiders’ lofty concerns about Kyiv’s agency evaporate in the face of economic “opportunities.”\n\n“Putin had two goals in invading Ukraine: robbing its territory, and robbing its sovereignty by preventing them from joining NATO,” thundered Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., on Feb. 16.\n\nBut just one day prior, Sen. Coons was striking a markedly different tone about Ukraine’s minerals.\n\n“If this is an investment opportunity where American companies and other companies from Europe would be involved in mining and processing, so that we can be independent of Chinese sources of these strategic minerals, and if his helps deepen and strengthen our partnership to help ensure the security of Ukraine going forward ... that would be a positive thing,” he told CNBC.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin’s robbing Ukraine is a horrific violation of sovereignty; the United States’ doing so is a positive. Let freedom ring.\n\nOr take Peter Dickinson — the editor of a Ukraine-centric blog for the Atlantic Council, a Washington-based foreign policy think tank that receives funding from arms manufacturer Lockheed Martin, the kingdom of Bahrain, the Charles Koch Foundation and the U.S. Energy Department, among other luminaries. “We hear lots of talk about geopolitics and what Putin wants, but we should not underestimate the agency of the Ukrainian people or their desire for a democratic European future,” Dickinson told Bloomberg in 2022.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin’s robbing Ukraine is a horrific violation of sovereignty; the United States’ doing so is a positive. Let freedom ring.\n\nLater that year, the X handle of Business Ukraine Mag (a publication edited and published by Dickinson) took Elon Musk to the woodshed, posting, “Elon Musk seems unaware that Ukrainian sovereignty is not up for discussion.” Things appear to have changed last month, however, when Dickinson was quoted in a Politico article with the amazing headline “Ukraine reels in Trump with mineral riches.” (It could have also read: “Bully’s victim reels in bully with lunch money.”)\n\nDickinson acknowledged that for Kyiv, it “would mean a lot less mineral wealth in future” before adding, “But I doubt anyone is very concerned about that.” He continued, “Compared to the alternative of the country being wiped off the map entirely, it looks like a very good deal indeed! Most Ukrainians certainly seem to view it as perhaps distasteful but ultimately a no-brainer.”\n\nThe hypocrisy of Ukraine’s purported Washington advocates only deepens given the role its territorial resources play in Ukraine’s identity — and the danger that could lurk for Zelenskyy, of all people, if he is strong-armed into conceding them.\n\nIt’s hard to overstate the role land plays in the Ukrainian psyche. One modern interpretation of the country’s blue-over-yellow flag is that it represents blue skies over the golden wheat fields of Ukraine. Even the months of the year are named after the agricultural cycle — August is Sickle-time, for the harvest; November is Leaf-fall, for autumn.\n\nThis love of their land — and fear of losing it — was watered with blood after Holodomor: the 1932-1933 manmade famine, courtesy of Soviet dictator Josef Stalin, after he ordered the grain seized from Ukraine. The famine, which many (including me) consider a genocide, saw almost 4 million Ukrainians perish of hunger. Every morning, dead bodies littered the streets as people collapsed where they walked. Cannibalism was commonplace.\n\nStalin sold the stolen wheat to industrialize the Soviet Union, including its military, which was used to keep Kyiv under Moscow’s power for the next 50-plus years; Ukraine’s grain helped forge Ukraine’s chains.\n\nUltranationalist elements of Ukraine seized on Holodomor to create the antisemitic lie that the famine was orchestrated by Jews. Starting with World War II, that deadly trope was used to “justify” Ukrainian participation in the Holocaust, a “you killed us, we killed you” narrative that persists on the Ukrainian far right to this day.\n\nYou can see it in graffiti scrawled on a Jewish social services center in the western city of Uzhhorod in 2017: “We remember. 1932-1933. We’ll take revenge.” The years referred to the famine; the graffiti appeared on the day Ukraine commemorates Holodomor victims.\n\nThe image of Zelenskyy, Ukraine’s first Jewish president, signing away his country’s rare minerals couldn’t be more perfect for Ukraine’s far right. He might as well be maniacally rubbing his hands together while being handed a bag with dollar signs.\n\nConsidering Kyiv is teetering on losing the war, which could unleash various nightmare scenarios, that image is not just disgusting but dangerous. Jews haven’t done well when they have been blamed for wars.\n\nThe kicker to the rare minerals deal is that much of the resources are in Ukraine’s east, either in Russia-controlled territory or in a no-man’s-land covered with land mines. Realistically, Zelenskyy has as much ability to give them away as I do. The only bankable outcome of this sordid mess is just a further painful reminder of how screwed Ukraine is.",

        "content": "Arlington National Cemetery has purged its website of pages about notable Black, Hispanic and women veterans, as well as information about the Civil War and Black history, as the Trump administration’s ongoing effort to remove references to “diversity and inclusion” on government webpages.\n\nAmong the pages that have disappeared from the cemetery’s website include links on the graves of prominent minority veterans, as well as educational pages on the Civil War, African American history and women’s history. Some of the information has been removed outright, while others were placed under categories that do not mention race or gender.\n\nAn archived version of the website’s educational page on African American history at the cemetery, for example, features a range of learning materials on the Civil Rights Movement and Black war heroes. That information no longer appears on the page.\n\nAn unnamed cemetery spokesperson told The Washington Post that links to webpages listing “Notable Graves” of Black, Hispanic and female veterans were taken down, and that the cemetery is working to make sure that content on its website complies with the administration’s policies.\n\nFirst reported by Civil War historian Kevin M. Levin and the military news publication Task & Purpose, the change follows Trump’s assault on diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives across the federal government.\n\nThe anti-DEI push has had a huge impact on the Defense Department in particular, where Secretary Pete Hegseth has vowed to get rid of what he calls “wokeness” in the military. Trump also fired the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Air Force Gen. C.Q. Brown, the second Black man to hold the top military position, and pushed out Adm. Lisa Franchetti, the head of the U.S. Navy and the first woman to lead any branch of the armed forces.\n\n“I think the single dumbest phrase in military history is ‘our diversity is our strength,’” Hegseth told Pentagon staff just days after being confirmed as defense secretary.\n\nSince then, the Defense Intelligence Agency has banned all activities related to cultural heritage celebrations, including Black History Month, Asian American and Pacific Islander Heritage Month, National American Indian Heritage Month, LGBTQ Pride Month, Women’s History Month, Juneteenth, Martin Luther King Jr. Day and Holocaust Remembrance Day.\n\nThe Pentagon is also seeking to bar trans people from serving in the military.\n\nIn February, chief Pentagon spokesperson Sean Parnell wrote a memo ordering officials to “remove all DoD news and feature articles, photos, and videos that promote Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion” by March 5. The Associated Press reported last week that the Pentagon has marked for removal more than 26,000 images of veterans from a diverse range of backgrounds and identities — which included an image of a B-29 aircraft that dropped the first atomic bomb on Hiroshima during World War II, the AP reported, because it was named “Enola Gay.”",

        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "The United States has expelled South African Ambassador Ebrahim Rasool for criticizing the Trump administration, further heightening tensions between the two countries.\n\nIn a post on X Friday, Secretary of State Marco Rubio wrote that Rasool was “no longer welcome in our great country,” calling him a “race-baiting politician who hates America” and President Donald Trump.\n\n“We have nothing to discuss with him and so he is considered PERSONA NON GRATA,” Rubio wrote.\n\nThe New York Times reported that the expulsion was official, citing a spokesperson for the South African president.\n\nIn his social media post, Rubio included a link to an article from the far-right website Breitbart on recent remarks Rasool gave to a research institute in Johannesburg about U.S. demographics moving away from a white majority (Rasool’s commentary begins at the 1:23 mark in the linked video). The article characterized Rasool’s comments as a claim that Trump is leading a “global white supremacist movement.”\n\nRasool spoke about a “supremacist assault on incumbency in U.S. politics,” pointing to the MAGA movement “as a response, not simply to a supremacist instinct, but to very clear data that shows great demographic shifts in the USA in which the voting electorate in the USA is projected to become 48% white, and that the possibility of a majority of minorities is looming on the horizon.”\n\nRasool also pointed to billionaire Elon Musk’s and Vice President JD Vance’s recent overtures to far-right political movements in Europe.\n\nRelations between the U.S. and South Africa have been strained in Trump’s new administration. Last month, the president signed an executive order halting aid to South Africa over a new law there intended to help address post-apartheid inequality in Black land ownership. The executive order suggested the legislation discriminates against white landowners. Trump also directed his administration to prioritize white South Africans’ resettlement in the U.S.\n\nTrump has also echoed South African-born Musk’s false claims that the South African government is targeting its white citizens — a claim that, like his own administration’s attacks on diversity initiatives in the U.S., is rooted in the presumption that any policy meant to create a more equitable playing field for nonwhite communities is by default an attack on white cultural and political power.\n\nRubio also skipped out on a G20 meeting in South Africa in February, saying the host country was using the summit to promote “DEI and climate change.”",

        "title": "Democratic leaders are failing the Mahmoud Khalil test",
        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "President Donald Trump’s attempt to deport pro-Palestinian activist Mahmoud Khalil marks one of Trump’s most egregious assaults on democratic liberties since taking office. Yet too many Democrats, particularly in party leadership, are responding to Trump in the most mealymouthed way possible. But this is a problem of Democrats’ own making: Their trepidation stems from their own history of repressing speech critical of Israel — and now we’re all at risk of paying the price for it.\n\nKhalil, an Algerian citizen of Palestinian descent, is a green-card holder who finished a master’s program at Columbia University in December (he is expected to graduate in the spring). He played a leading role in activism on Columbia’s campus last year objecting to Israel’s brutal treatment of Gaza, and served as a representative of student activists in negotiations with the university administration over a divestment campaign. A Columbia professor recently described him as a “consummate diplomat” who “seeks mediated resolutions through speech and dialogue.” He has an 8-month pregnant wife, who is a U.S. citizen.\n\nDemocratic leaders' response has been slow, divided and often feeble.\n\nThis legal permanent resident’s detention was made all the more disturbing by the way in which it was carried out. Khalil was detained in the lobby of his Columbia University-owned New York City apartment building on Saturday, with ICE agents changing their claims about his immigration status mid-arrest.\n\nAt first, the Trump administration provided no public legal explanation of its actions, even as it shipped Khalil to a detention facility in Louisiana. Green-card holders can be deported for certain crimes, but the government has not even charged Khalil with anything. Instead, the government is invoking an obscure provision of immigration law, which holds that an immigrant can be removed from the country if the U.S. secretary of state determines that their presence or activities are deemed to potentially have “serious adverse foreign policy consequences.” That’s why a Department of Homeland Security spokesperson has described Khalil as “aligned to Hamas.” But the administration has failed to provide any evidence or explanation for how this student activist is allegedly “aligned to Hamas” or poses a “serious” risk to U.S. foreign policy.\n\nInstead, the Trump administration is targeting him for his political speech and activism — and openly admitting that his arrest is meant to scare other pro-Palestinian activists. On Truth Social, Trump called Khalil a “Radical Foreign Pro-Hamas Student“ and warned that his arrest is the “first arrest of many to come.” He added: “We know there are more students at Columbia and other Universities across the Country who have engaged in pro-terrorist, anti-Semitic, anti-American activity, and the Trump Administration will not tolerate it.”\n\nMany civil liberties advocates, centrist and left-of-center observers recognize Khalil’s detention as an assault on free speech. Georgetown legal scholar Steve Vladeck said that the Trump administration’s actions constitute “unconstitutional retaliation for First Amendment-protected speech.” The organization Jewish Voice for Peace said Trump’s actions were “designed to sow terror among students and immigrant communities” and its protesters poured into Trump Tower in Manhattan chanting “Fight Nazis, not students.” Donna Lieberman, executive director of NYCLU, likened Khalil’s detention to “McCarthyism” and described it as a “targeted, retaliatory, and an extreme attack on his First Amendment rights.” Jameel Jaffer, executive director at the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University, described Trump’s move as “the kind of action one ordinarily associates with the world’s most repressive regimes.”\n\nSome Democrats have risen to the occasion. “We must be extremely clear: This is an attempt to criminalize political protest and is a direct assault on the freedom of speech of everyone in this country,” said a letter from 14 progressive House Democrats. Another letter, signed by over 100 House Democrats, said Khalil’s detention represents “the playbook of authoritarians, not of elected officials in a democratic society who claim to be the champions of free speech.”\n\nYet Democratic leaders’ response has been slow, divided and often feeble. New York Governor Kathy Hochul and New York City Mayor Eric Adams have refused to weigh in. And the statements of both House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer illustrate how caveats and hedging can undermine clear communication and standing for principles.\n\nBoth Jeffries and Schumer’s statements begin with caveats referencing how Khalil may have violated Columbia University’s rules and his behavior may warrant disciplinary action from the college regarding how he may have made Jewish students feel. But Khalil’s status at the university is irrelevant. At stake is his status in the United States. Bringing up Columbia’s disciplinary system allows Jeffries and Schumer to distance themselves from Khalil’s political cause. But the entire point of defending the First Amendment is to defend people’s rights to say things that are unpopular or even loathsome. (Note that nobody has provided evidence of how Khalil, who has denounced antisemitism, is antisemitic, and that Khalil’s lawyers say there is no evidence he supports Hamas.)\n\nBoth Jeffries’ and Schumer’s statements ask for the Trump administration to provide evidence of criminal activity in order to justify its actions. But that’s also a misfire: The Trump administration has made it crystal clear that this isn’t about criminal activity, but about political speech. A White House official even told The Free Press that “the allegation here is not that he was breaking the law.” Only after all the throat-clearing do the statements get around to saying that Trump’s actions appear to violate the Constitution in a measured tone.\n\nThe reason the mainstream of the Democratic leaders have been weak on this issue is because the party has been long opposed to the issue that Khalil represents — cutting off aid to Israel — and complicit in the free speech crisis themselves. President Joe Biden maintained almost uninterrupted military aid Israel, even as human rights observers and scholars described it as a genocide, and effectively aligned himself with draconian crackdowns on overwhelmingly peaceful pro-Palestinian student protests. And most House Democrats voted in favor of a bill conflating criticism of Israel with antisemitism. Moreover, across institutions with ostensibly liberal cultures — in media, book publishing, the film industry and elsewhere — voices critical of Israel have been stifled or even purged. Khalil’s detention may violate the First Amendment, but in the U.S. there remains a Palestine exception to free speech.\n\nIf Democrats are wagering that this can be contained to one green-card holder, they are naive. Already Trump has canceled hundreds of millions of dollars of federal funding to Columbia based on the pretext that it did not do enough to crack down on antisemitism. (This comes after Columbia expended immense resources to do so.) The message is clear: Trump wants to bully and intimidate as many institutions as possible to comply with its authoritarian assault on free speech. So far, Democratic leaders are not up for the fight.",

        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "Recent data from the University of Michigan shows consumer confidence in the economy has plummeted to its lowest level since 2022, as prices rise and stocks fall in response to Donald Trump’s unnecessary and rudderless trade war.\n\nThe stumbling stock market and all the understandable worries about it are not a liberal conspiracy theory. The Fox News universe has been trying to prepare Trump supporters for economic pain as a consequence of his policies. But rather than grapple with that reality, Team Trump is trying to confine the American public to a fantasyland of its own creation, baselessly blaming the tanking economy on former President Joe Biden.\n\nAnd, in at least one instance, suggesting the low consumer confidence is actually a fabrication of people with an axe to grind. Kevin Hassett, Trump’s director of the National Economic Council, faced some pushback on Fox News, of all places, after he downplayed host Martha MacCallum’s question about what evidence he could offer that consumer confidence was improving. Hassett said:\n\n“The thing that I care most about is the hard data. The consumer confidence numbers can sometimes fluctuate around elections, for example, because of people whose party lost or are really in a bad mood and they say, ‘Oh, things are just terrible. You know, the guy I didn’t vote for is gonna destroy the economy.’ But then, when it doesn’t happen, people get around. So I don’t actually put a lot of faith in the consumer confidence numbers right around election time.\n\nThe proposition that Trump’s policies might hurt the economy isn’t liberal propaganda. Last year, Elon Musk literally predicted his and Trump’s economic policies would crash the economy. MacCallum interrupted Hassett’s deflection to note that “we’re pretty far past the November election” and again asked Hassett for any evidence to suggest consumer sentiment was actually good.\n\nHassett declined to provide any, then went on to say he doesn’t believe the University of Michigan survey because “there are a lot of Michigan people doing the survey that I don’t necessarily think were doing anything other than making a partisan survey.”\n\nWatch the exchange here:\n\nIf the conservative Wall Street Journal is willing to cite the same University of Michigan survey, it’s pretty laughable to try to spin the survey as “partisan” and untrustworthy.\n\nHassett’s smokescreen — along with Trump’s recent social media outburst against the Journal’s reporting that Trump’s tariffs are destabilizing the economy — show how the administration is not coping well with the negative consequences (and growing unpopularity) of Trump’s haphazard and ham-fisted policymaking.",

        "title": "Chuck Schumer avoided a shutdown and made it harder to stop Trump",
        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "The Senate voted on Friday afternoon to move forward with a Republican short-term funding bill and avoid a federal government shutdown. Ten Democrats, including Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, voted in favor of cloture, limiting further debate and advancing the bill to final passage. The funding bill then passed in a 54-46 vote, with two Democrats joining all but one Republican senator in support.\n\nIt was the culmination of a wild week that brought to a head a divide among congressional Democrats over how best to counter President Donald Trump’s agenda. Moreover, it has left Schumer a far cry from his past as once one of the party’s more effective messengers. Now, the caucus he leads, thanks to his own missteps, appears too disjointed and out of sync to have a coherent message.\n\nNow, the caucus he leads, thanks to his own missteps, appears too disjointed and out of sync to have a coherent message.\n\nFor months now, Schumer has advocated for a posture of letting Republicans trip over themselves and reaping the rewards during the midterms. “Trump will screw up,” he told Semafor in early February, urging Democrats to remain patient. Even as it became clear that negotiations over the looming government funding deadline were faltering, Senate Democrats have been more focused on the fight over the GOP’s funding bill for the next fiscal year.\n\nHistory was on their side on that front, especially with the extremely narrow GOP majority in the House. The odds of Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., managing to corral his fractious caucus without support from Democrats to get a funding bill over the line seemed slim. But then the unthinkable happened: the House GOP banded together without any of its usual drama.\n\nThe continuing resolution the House approved on Tuesday slashes funding for nondefense spending over the next six months but does so stealthily enough that swing-district Republicans could support it. More significantly, the normally anti-CR House Freedom Caucus jumped on board after Trump and Vice President JD Vance promised that the White House would simply cut whatever spending the resolution authorized that they didn’t like. That alone should have been enough to make clear to congressional Democrats that the language they were demanding to curtail Trump’s illegal impoundment should be required for any support in passing the bill.\n\nHouse Democrats were a bit all over the place in their reasoning for opposing the bill, citing the reduced short-term funding, the longer-term risk to Social Security and other entitlements, and calling it as a free pass to let the Department of Government Efficiency continue its illegal downsizing of the government. But despite differing motives, House Minority Leader Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., made sure his caucus agreed on the results. All but one House Democrat voted against the bill. Given lawmakers’ — and especially Democrats’ — temptation to avoid blame for a shutdown, this was a major feat for Jeffries and his team.\n\nBut even as House Democrats stuck together, it quickly became clear how unprepared Senate Democrats were for this moment. According to NBC News, “Schumer didn’t initiate a full caucus conversation about how to handle the House measure until Democrats met for lunch on Tuesday,” after the House bill had already passed. Two days of closed-door discussions did not lead to consensus among members on how to avoid a shutdown without appearing to capitulate to Trump.\n\nThe resulting messaging from Senate Democrats was a mess. On Wednesday afternoon, Schumer announced that there weren’t Democratic votes for the GOP bill and that the caucus was unified on a 30-day funding bill to allow for more negotiations. But getting that alternative to the floor would have required offering it as an amendment, which would have required at least eight Democrats to vote for cloture anyway. It would only be then that Democrats could offer up their plan as amendment — which was guaranteed to fail, given that Republicans control 53 seats. (It and two other amendments, as predicted, failed to pass on Friday afternoon.)\n\nThe strategy seemed like an attempt to use the arcane procedures of the Senate to hoodwink Democratic voters into thinking the caucus had done everything in its power to stop the resolution. That feeling was justified the next day when Schumer turned around to say that he would vote in favor of advancing the bill rather than allowing a shutdown. \"I believe allowing Donald Trump to take even much more power via a government shutdown is a far worse option,” he said in a floor speech. “I will vote to keep the government open and not shut it down.”\n\nModerate and progressive Democrats alike have either denounced or disregarded Schumer’s argument.\n\nIt’s not that Schumer’s reasoning was entirely misguided. As one senator reportedly yelled at their colleagues this week, the Trump administration might use a shutdown to declare a national emergency. It could also be used to justify Elon Musk and the Department of Government Efficiency firing “nonessential” personnel. And shutdowns are generally bad politically for the party that’s seen as at fault. But for a party that has struggled to figure out where to draw the line against Trump, it came across as a prime example of giving up without a fight.\n\nTo say that House Democrats were angry at Schumer’s capitulation is an understatement. Their fury was compounded because, according to NBC News, Jeffries’ team had let Schumer know about their plan to unify against the bill and force the GOP back to the table — a plan that could only work if Senate Democrats held strong as well. “I think there is a deep sense of outrage and betrayal, and this is not just progressive Democrats — this is across the board, the entire party,” Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., told reporters on Thursday night.\n\nThis sort of dispute is exceedingly rare for congressional Democrats. What makes this divide even more unusual is that it isn’t based on ideology. Moderate and progressive Democrats alike have either denounced or disregarded Schumer’s argument. Nor can the split be primarily viewed as a battle between the old guard and upstarts, as The New York Times framed the anger at Schumer. Former Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., who was Schumer’s partner in countering the first Trump administration, lent her voice to the chorus denouncing his decision. And when asked about the Senate leadership’s performance this week, Jeffries responded with a distinct lack of support for Schumer: “Next question.”\n\nThere’s a distinct irony here given how much of Schumer’s rise was fueled by his reputation as being a media whiz. After his predecessor, Sen. Harry Reid of Nevada, announced his retirement in 2015, Schumer was immediately tapped to take the reins. As Politico wrote at the time: “After two cycles running the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee and after he’s taken the reins as the messaging guru, Schumer is viewed by many of his colleagues as being one of his party’s savviest political tacticians.” Now that reputation seems ill-deserved given the heartache and lack of clarity along the way from him.\n\nIn this case, Schumer got what he wanted and managed to bring enough of his members with him to avoid a shutdown. But in the process, he’s alienated the House and accelerated the growing conversation about the need for sitting senators to face primary challengers. Whether he leads the Senate Democratic caucus after the midterms is now in doubt. And in refusing to use every tool in his power to stop Trump’s violation of the Constitution, Schumer has left an already demoralized Democratic base wondering when, if ever, the party’s leaders are going to act like their campaign trail warnings about the threat Trump poses to the country will be reflected in their actions.",

        "content": "Welcome back, Deadline: Legal Newsletter readers. When we left off last week, the Trump Justice Department was making its final plea to dismiss Eric Adams’ criminal case without prejudice — meaning, the Republican administration was still pushing for the option to revive the Democrat’s corruption indictment in the future (hence the quid pro quo allegations, which both sides have denied). Heading into this weekend, we’re awaiting U.S. District Judge Dale Ho’s ruling on the matter, which could come anytime.\n\nThe Trump DOJ pushed the president’s version of “law and order” on other dockets. In doing so, the government continued its abnormal streak of top officials appearing at hearings to advance Donald Trump’s goals. Last month, it was Emil Bove's New York appearance at the Adams hearing. This week, Attorney General Pam Bondi's chief of staff, Chad Mizelle, was in a Washington, D.C., courtroom defending Trump’s executive order that sought to take various actions against law firm Perkins Coie for its Democratic-aligned work.\n\n“It sends little chills down my spine,” U.S. District Judge Beryl Howell said of Trump’s directive, against which she issued a temporary restraining order. “This may be amusing in ‘Alice in Wonderland’ where the Queen of Hearts yells, ‘Off with their heads!’ at annoying subjects and announces a sentence before a verdict,” the Obama appointee said. “But this cannot be the reality we are living under.”\n\nHowell wasn’t the only district judge disturbed by the government’s behavior this week. U.S. District Judge William Alsup called it “a sad day when our government would fire some good employee, and say it was based on performance, when they know good and well, that’s a lie.” Ordering several federal departments to rehire employees, the Clinton appointee in California said the government tried to frustrate his “ability to get at the truth of what happened here.” Alsup’s preliminary ruling was one of two big ones against Trump’s mass firings, with another from Obama appointee James Bredar in Maryland.\n\nPardons made news on several fronts — including, somehow, in a Mel Gibson-related situation. DOJ pardon attorney Liz Oyer, a Biden appointee, said she was fired after refusing to help restore the Trump-allied actor’s gun rights, which he lost after his 2011 domestic violence conviction. Separately, Trump pardoned Brian Kelsey, a Republican former lawmaker from Tennessee, who was two weeks into a 21-month campaign finance fraud sentence. Decrying the “weaponized Biden DOJ” that prosecuted him, Kelsey reportedly said his clemency request likely resonated with the president, whom he called “victim No. 1” of political persecution.\n\nAnd how far does Trump’s blanket Jan. 6 pardon go? We got new answers to that open question, which has been raised by defendants testing the extent to which the clemency covers actions beyond that day at the Capitol in 2021. In one case, U.S. District Judge Thomas Varlan in Tennessee said Trump’s pardon doesn’t cover Edward Kelley’s 2022 plot to kill federal agents who investigated him. In another case — in which the DOJ sided with the defendant after initially opposing him — Trump appointee Dabney Friedrich said the pardon didn’t cover Dan Wilson’s Kentucky firearms conviction.\n\n“President Trump alone has the constitutional authority to pardon Wilson for all of his crimes,” Friedrich wrote. “He still may do so. But this Court cannot — it is duty bound to enforce the Presidential Pardon as written.”\n\nWill Trump redeploy his pardon Sharpie to clean up any unfinished Jan. 6 business? If the Trump DOJ thought the pardon should apply to Wilson, then the defendant and anyone else in similar situations might have some reason to hope. But judges unwilling to do that work for them means they’re at the president’s mercy once again.\n\nHave any questions or comments for me? I’d love to hear from you!

        "content": "President Donald Trump rehashed a litany of long-held grievances before an unusual crowd on Friday, telling officials at the Department of Justice that he had been persecuted, abused and attacked by his perceived political opponents in a meandering speech that went on for more than an hour.\n\nSpeaking to an audience that included FBI Director Kash Patel and Attorney General Pam Bondi, Trump painted himself as a victim, as he called prosecutors who worked on his criminal cases “scum,” “evil” and “corrupt,” and railed against negative media coverage of him as “illegal.”\n\n“They spied on my campaign, launched one hoax and disinformation operation after another, broke the law on a colossal scale, persecuted my family, staff and supporters, raided my home Mar-a-Lago, and did everything within their power to prevent me from becoming the president of the United States,” he said.\n\nAlthough billed as an address on law and order, Trump’s remarks to the Justice Department more resembled one of his rambling campaign speeches. Calling himself the “chief law enforcement officer” (a title usually reserved for the U.S. attorney general), Trump careened across a range of topics, from Ukraine to the price of eggs, crowed about his “mandate” in the 2024 election and vowed to “bring back faith” in a justice system that he has dramatically politicized since returning to office.\n\n“First, we must be honest about the lies and the abuses that have occurred within these walls,” Trump told the crowd. “Unfortunately in recent years, a corrupt group of hacks and radicals within the ranks of the American government obliterated the trust and goodwill built up over generations. They weaponized the vast powers of our intelligence and law enforcement agencies to try and thwart the will of the American people.”\n\nTrump also mentioned by name attorneys who he claimed “did everything within their power to prevent me from becoming the president of the United States” and repeated his baseless claim that his political foes had weaponized federal law enforcement against him — even as he delivered a highly politicized speech to a department that has traditionally strived to preserve its independence from the executive branch.",

        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "President Donald Trump’s flurry of executive orders seems destined for a showdown at the Supreme Court. Members of Trump’s administration — including Vice President JD Vance and tech billionaire Elon Musk — are already raising the possibility of defying the court should it rule against the administration. This raises the stakes for the court: a ruling against Trump risks the executive branch’s defiance, which could damage the court’s legitimacy.\n\nWill Trump comply with its rulings? What will be the consequences of defiance? These are questions not only of law, but also of politics.\n\nThere are many historical examples that shed light on what the political fallout might look like, but perhaps the best comes from the final months of Richard Nixon’s presidency, in 1974.\n\nForced into a corner, Nixon complied with the court’s ruling.\n\nNixon had secretly taped conversations in the Oval Office, with some of the recordings containing evidence about the Watergate cover-up. In April 1974, special prosecutor Leon Jaworski subpoenaed the recordings as part of his investigation. In U.S. v. Nixon, the Supreme Court ordered Nixon to hand over the tapes.\n\nThe court’s opinion, written by Nixon-appointed Chief Justice Warren Burger, left the president with two options. He could comply with the court and deal with the fallout. Or he could defy it and send the country into a constitutional crisis — something he apparently did privately consider.\n\nThe political context is important. By the time of the Supreme Court’s ruling, Nixon’s political capital had collapsed. His approval rating hovered around 24%, and his fellow Republicans in Congress had abandoned him. Everyone — including the justices — knew that ignoring the court would probably result in Nixon’s impeachment and removal.\n\nThis put the court in a strong position politically, and Nixon in a weak one. Forced into a corner, Nixon complied with the court’s ruling. He reluctantly handed over the tapes and resigned two weeks later.\n\nNixon’s story makes clear that, in a possible confrontation between a president and the Supreme Court, public approval and congressional support are enormously important. Nixon had neither: everyone knew that defying the court would likely have led to impeachment and removal. Trump, on the other hand, retains strong support from Republican voters, even as his overall favorability has declined since assuming office. While Nixon’s co-partisans on Capitol Hill hung him out to dry, Trump’s are standing behind him. Congressional Republicans have bent the knee time and time again, seemingly allowing his administration to exercise even those powers, such as the power to appropriate funds, that the Constitution grants to the legislature.\n\nUnlike Nixon, Trump will not face the threat of congressional impeachment and removal if he defies the court. Barring an extraordinary political event — such as an unprecedented rout in the 2026 midterms — that will remain the case for the rest of his term. That reality could embolden him.\n\nIf public consensus remains firm, a blatant defiance of the Supreme Court could be politically perilous for Trump.\n\nBut there is a second important issue: people’s expectations. Not only did Nixon have abysmal public support, but roughly half of Americans wanted him to leave office entirely. Fast-forward to today, Trump himself is not unpopular, but many of his policies are not particularly well liked. Ending birthright citizenship, abolishing executive agencies and expansions of presidential power have proved unpopular. And large shares believe that Trump is overstepping his presidential authority. Would enough of the Supreme Court’s swing votes, such as Chief Justice John Roberts, stick their necks out to save policies that Americans dislike?\n\nMost important is the fact that Americans firmly believe that presidents must obey Supreme Court rulings — for example, a recent poll showed that 83% of Americans (including 77% of Republicans) believe this. That is a striking level of bipartisan public consensus in a deeply polarized era. People want the president to comply with rulings, and they fully expect him to do so.\n\nIf public consensus remains firm, a blatant defiance of the Supreme Court could be politically perilous for Trump. This expectation may also influence the court itself, making it feel more emboldened to rule without fear of being ignored.\n\nHistory doesn’t repeat itself, but it does offer guidance. Nixon was a politically weak president pushing unpopular views; he could not realistically survive a conflict with the court given the credible threat of impeachment from Congress. As for Trump, even though his policies are not popular, Congress is currently no check on his power. This all suggests that if Trump defied the court, he would probably survive in the sense that he would not be impeached. But it could be a pyrrhic victory: he could emerge severely politically damaged, perhaps cripplingly so.\n\nThe deeper worry is this: Trump has tested the boundaries of executive power like few presidents before him. Even if defying the Supreme Court carries significant political costs, those costs may be relatively meaningless — especially if the standoff involves elections or an expansion of his own authority. Political damage after the fact would mean little if defying the court works to secure more presidential power at the expense of democratic norms. And in the end, the most significant check would be a credible threat of congressional impeachment and removal — something that was historically present, but for now remains absent.",

        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "A recent audit found that Medicare may have made up to $454 million in improper payments to providers for 38.7 million Covid tests.\n\nIn another case, a multiagency investigation found that a former U.S. Air Force employee and the owners of government contracting firms conspired in a bribery scheme that spanned more than a decade and involved more than $400 million in government contracts. The investigation led to six criminal convictions, more than $88 million recovered for the government and more than 34 years of jail time for the defendants.\n\nIG oversight has collectively resulted in potential savings of about $93.1 billion in FY 2023.\n\nA 2023 report revealed that the Small Business Administration had decided to stop collecting on certain delinquent loans — totaling roughly $62 billion. After the report was issued and congressional Republicans “blasted the [Biden] administration for its leniency,” the SBA reversed course and announced plans to pursue those deadbeat loans aggressively, and could recover as much as $30 billion for American taxpayers.\n\nThe reports mentioned above represent just a handful of the times inspectors general, the independent watchdogs inside the various agencies of the federal government, have either called out fraud or waste or saved the American people money. IGs have also improved the federal government’s performance on a wide variety of critical issues, from combating violent gangs to preventing veterans' suicides, from uncovering cyberfraud to fighting cyberstalking, from overseeing U.S. aid to Ukraine to evaluating the evacuation from Afghanistan, from exposing border corruption to analyzing bank failures.\n\nThat’s why President Donald Trump’s decision to fire 18 inspectors general in the first week of his term is so puzzling. According to the Council of the Inspectors General on Integrity and Efficiency, IG oversight has collectively resulted in potential savings of about $93.1 billion in FY 2023. With the OIG community’s aggregate FY 2023 budget of approximately $3.5 billion, these potential savings represent an approximate $26 return on every dollar invested in inspectors general.\n\nIGs should be a natural ally in the president’s effort to make the government more efficient; “Efficiency” is literally in our name. IGs ultimately share a mission with the rest of the executive branch, which is to improve the federal government for the American people. And the IGs’ track record makes clear that IG oversight is a good investment for the American taxpayer.\n\nEven if it’s true, as some have argued that the White House fired me along with my IG colleagues because the president does not want independent oversight into the executive branch, here’s why President Trump should want independence for his inspectors general.\n\nIf IGs are not independent — if they can’t make findings of waste, fraud, abuse or misconduct about government programs, without fear of being fired, disciplined or reprimanded and can’t be objective in their assessments of government programs — then their oversight will be worthless.\n\nThe programs that President Trump cares about most are precisely the ones in which he should want the straight scoop.\n\nTo use a business analogy, President Trump would likely avoid investing in a company whose auditors were hopelessly conflicted, and he wouldn’t trust the financial audit of the company’s balance sheet or cash flow statement if the auditor would have gotten fired for anything other than a clean opinion. Surely, he wouldn’t trust a bond rating if the rating officials would have been fired or reprimanded for anything other than a AAA rating.\n\nSimilarly, who would believe any findings of any office of inspector general if IGs can be removed for any negative findings? The programs that President Trump cares about most are precisely the ones in which he should want the straight scoop.\n\nThis is not a hypothetical. In 2022, when I was inspector general of the U.S. Interior Department, my office found that the department’s Bureau of Land Management, which administers oil and gas leasing programs on federal land, was failing to conduct a necessary step to prevent waste, fraud and abuse in the leasing program. BLM was awarding leases for the mineral extraction, including oil and gas, without confirming whether the entities and individuals were prohibited from doing business with the federal government. After our report, BLM began immediately checking the list of prohibited entities before issuing those leases. That is a great example of government oversight at its best.\n\nHere’s the catch: I don’t know that such a report could be issued today. There’s reason to believe that a negative report on a sensitive program, regardless of how true it is or how helpful it is to the American taxpayer, would be viewed as disloyal and cause for termination.\n\nThe chilling effect on IGs seems already to be occurring. Paul Martin, who served as inspector general of the U.S. Agency for International Development was fired last month, the day after releasing a report that cautioned that the Trump administration’s freeze on foreign aid, as well as its efforts to cut USAID’s staffing, made it harder to ensure billions in U.S. funding were being spent properly. Roughly two weeks later, The Washington Post reported that his successor, the acting IG at USAID, had been accused of holding “two critical reports on the consequences of President Donald Trump’s funding freeze on crucial services in Africa and the Middle East, amid fears of retaliation from the White House.”\n\nThat is the polar opposite of what President Trump should want. He should want to know if there are problems in the federal government, so he can fix them for the American people. IG reports are a tremendous tool to do just that, but only if the IGs are empowered to call it like they see it, without the proverbial sword of Damocles hanging over their heads.\n\nPresident Trump is famously adamant about loyalty. Well, it’s not loyal to bury bad news. To the contrary, allowing decision-makers to waltz down the primrose path, unwittingly blind to the realities on the ground, is the ultimate in disloyalty. Sharing the truth, even if it is not what the principal wants, is the ultimate show of loyalty.",

        "content": "“Can they do that?”\n\nIt’s a frequently asked question in the early days of Donald Trump’s second term.\n\nOne of the latest actions spurring that question is the Department of Education's decision to cut about half its staff under the leadership of former wrestling executive Linda McMahon. The answer is “no,” according to a new lawsuit filed by Democratic-led states, including New York Attorney General Letitia James.\n\nThe Trump administration “cannot dismantle the Department of Education,” the legal complaint filed Thursday in Massachusetts federal court reads. “It cannot override — whether through large-scale RIFs [Reduction in Force] or otherwise — the statutory framework prescribing the Department’s responsibilities.”\n\nThe states’ suit invokes the separation of powers, arguing that the executive is encroaching legislative authority and not “tak[ing] care” that the law be faithfully executed as constitutionally required. Noting that Congress created the department, the complaint said the executive and his agencies “cannot incapacitate it, absent Congressional action that directs them to do so.”\n\nThe states also said the department’s “mass RIF” is “arbitrary and capricious” because the government “provided no reasoned basis or explanation” for it. “The Department’s stated reasons for the RIF — to promote ‘efficiency’ and ‘accountability’ — are pretext for the President and Secretary McMahon’s stated goal of dismantling the Department from within,” the complaint alleged.\n\nIt recalled past attempts to eliminate the department, such as Republican Ronald Reagan’s bid to do so with legislation in the 1980s. But Congress didn’t pass that legislation, thus reflecting “the uncontroversial understanding that only Congress may abolish an agency it created,” the complaint said.\n\nAnd what’s the connection to the states? They wrote that they rely on the department “for an extraordinary array of programs,” citing funds for low-income children and students with disabilities, anti-discrimination enforcement and student aid.\n\nThe federal government will get a chance to respond in court, and a judge will make an initial determination of whether this suit will join others that have blocked some of the administration’s actions so far.\n\nSubscribe to the Deadline: Legal Newsletter for expert analysis on the top legal stories of the week, including updates from the Supreme Court and developments in the Trump administration’s legal cases.",

        "title": "Why Trump businesses’ lawsuit against Capital One bank is so ridiculous",
        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "Earlier this month, a collection of people and entities affiliated with President Donald Trump — specifically, the Donald J. Trump Revocable Trust, DJT Holdings LLC, DJT Holdings Managing Member LLC, DTTM Operations LLC and Eric Trump — sued Capital One bank for having “unjustifiably” closed numerous Trump-associated bank accounts in the aftermath of the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection at the U.S. Capitol.\n\nThe lawsuit pleads that “de-banking” — closing depositors’ bank accounts — was originally meant to stop fraudsters from having access to banking facilities but it morphed into a way to punish depositors for their political beliefs. The lawsuit explains that completely legal gun and ammunition dealers or payday lenders often found themselves de-banked by unelected bureaucrats who disagreed with the businesses’ political beliefs. The plaintiffs claim to have been damaged by this type of de-banking when Capital One closed Trump accounts because of the Trumps’ “political views.” The Trumps seek damages under an assortment of state consumer protection laws.\n\nJust how many ways is this lawsuit silly? Let me count them.\n\nAs a purely legal matter, the Trumps don’t appear to have suffered any recoverable money damages. According to the lawsuit, Capital One closed the Trump bank accounts. Presumably, the bank returned the Trumps’ money to them — the lawsuit doesn’t say otherwise, and it’s inconceivable the bank would have stolen the Trumps’ money. (A representative for Capital One declined to comment for this article.)\n\nIt’s true that individual depositors with small accounts — such as gun shops — might have trouble setting up new banking relationships after they were “de-banked,” but a large real estate business, such as the Trump Organization, would have had no trouble on that score. So while we don’t know for certain, the Trumps’ situation was presumably this: Capital One closed the Trumps’ bank accounts, Capital One returned the Trumps’ money, the Trumps promptly found a new bank, and the Trumps, uninjured, went on with their business.\n\nA fundamental element of any lawsuit is that a plaintiff must have suffered damages. Here, except perhaps for the inconvenience of changing bankers, the Trumps suffered none.\n\nWhere’s the case?\n\nBut that’s just the legal flaw in this lawsuit. Think for a moment about the practical flaws.\n\nJust how many ways is this lawsuit silly? Let me count them.\n\nIs any jury going to believe that Capital One stopped its banking relationship in the months after Jan. 6 because of Donald Trump’s political beliefs? Did the bank really think, “Donald Trump doesn’t like affirmative action and he opposes DEI, so we should close his accounts”?\n\nOr is it far more likely — and in fact almost certainly true, and sure to be believed by a jury in a heartbeat — that Capital One closed the Trumps’ bank accounts because it didn’t care to be associated with a person who appeared to have incited an insurrection and then stood by silently for three hours as rioters ransacked the Capitol?\n\nJust about everyone in America — all Democrats, and even some Republicans — knew that Trump was “practically and morally responsible for provoking the events” of Jan. 6, as then-GOP Senate leader Mitch McConnell put it at the time.\n\nThis wasn’t a matter of politics; it was a matter of morality.\n\nCapital One didn’t close the Trumps’ bank accounts because of Trump’s political views. Capital One has denied that it closed the bank accounts for political reasons, but it wouldn’t be unreasonable to surmise that the bank didn’t care to be associated with anyone — Democratic, Republican or independent — who tried to interfere with the counting of votes in a presidential election. Handling financial transactions for Trump both would have been immoral and would have posed a reputational risk for the bank. Ending that relationship wasn’t improper; it was sane.\n\nAlthough many Americans seem to have forgiven Trump’s gross misconduct over the four years since the Jan. 6 riot, that misconduct could fully justify Capital One’s closing of the bank accounts.\n\nBut the practical flaws in the Trumps’ lawsuit don’t stop there.\n\nIn any lawsuit, the parties are permitted to take discovery — gather information — from each other. Capital One will thus have the right to request documents and take testimony from Donald Trump and others about Trump’s conduct on Jan. 6. As the House Jan. 6 committee proceedings made clear, there is nothing about Trump’s conduct in early January 2021 that is praiseworthy; there is much that should be condemned. Does Trump really want to relive, and again place in the public eye, the events of one of the most notorious days in his life?\n\nThere are many reasons for the Trumps to abandon this lawsuit. There is only one reason for them to pursue it: to get a financial settlement.\n\nThere’s no legal reason for Capital One to settle the Trumps’ newest lawsuit. The lawsuit is both defensible and embarrassing for Trump to pursue. But there are surely practical reasons — avoiding the wrath the federal government could inflict on a bank — for Capital One to cough up some dough to make this go away.\n\nIs that justice? Not by a long shot.\n\nBut does it appear to be a recurring way for Trump to profit while he has the government on his side? Bank on it.",

        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "While Donald Trump’s imperialistic vision was front-page news last month, the president’s territorial ambitions gradually moved to the backburner as other controversies surrounding his agenda moved to the fore. Thursday, the story came roaring back.\n\nNBC News reported, for example, that the White House has directed the Pentagon to “draw up options to increase the American troop presence in Panama” to achieve the president’s goal of “reclaiming” the Panama Canal. The report added, “U.S. Southern Command is developing potential plans from partnering more closely with Panamanian security forces to the less likely option of U.S. troops’ seizing the Panama Canal by force, the officials said. Whether military force is used, the officials added, depends on how much Panamanian security forces agree to partner with the United States.”\n\nThe news was not well received in Panama City, where officials issued a statement emphasizing that “our sovereignty over the Panama Canal is absolute and not the basis of any negotiation.”\n\nAround the same time that report was reaching the public, Trump had some related remarks about Greenland. NBC News reported on the comments, made during an Oval Office event alongside NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte.\n\nTrump said in remarks in the Oval Office during his meeting with the NATO secretary general that he thinks the United States will succeed in his quest to take control of Greenland. “I think it’ll happen,” Trump said when he was asked what his vision is for the potential annexation of the country.\n\nAs part of the same set of comments, the American president also suggested that he might deploy additional U.S. troops to Greenland.\n\nAs for officials in Denmark — a country Trump also slighted during the Oval Office event — Rasmus Jarlov, the chairman of the defense committee in Denmark’s parliament, said in a statement, “It would mean war between two NATO countries. Greenland has just voted against immediate independence from Denmark and does not want to be American ever.”\n\nIn case that weren’t quite enough, Trump — again, at the same Oval Office gathering — also made fresh comments about annexing the nation of Canada, adding, “Canada only works as a state.” He went on to say that adding Canada to the United States would make the country “visually” impressive.\n\nIt was against this backdrop that The Wall Street Journal reported that Trump recently contacted House Speaker Mike Johnson to request that Congress send over a painting of James Polk, the nation’s 11th president, to be displayed at the White House.\n\nAnd why, pray tell, would the president want a Polk portrait? Because, as the Journal’s article noted, he “oversaw the largest expansion of U.S. territory in history.” (Don’t laugh, but I continue to think Team Trump’s interest in wall décor is an angle worth watching in the second term.)\n\nSo, let’s take stock. The White House has directed the Pentagon to draw up options to increase the American troop presence in Panama. Trump now expects to annex Greenland and has talked about the possibility of deploying troops to the island. The president still wants to annex Canada. He’s also talked at length about taking over the Gaza Strip.\n\nAnd did I mention that Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth recently raised the prospect of unilateral military strikes in Mexico? Because that reportedly happened, too.\n\nTo the extent that the White House cares about public attitudes, the latest Reuters/Ipsos poll found that 60% of Americans oppose taking control of the Panama Canal, 68% oppose territorial U.S. expansion, 69% oppose annexing Greenland, 80% oppose making Canada a state, and 84% oppose Trump’s Gaza plan. (Click the link for more information on the poll’s methodology and margin of error.\n\nOr put another way, Americans have seen and heard the president’s imperialistic vision — and most of the country just isn’t buying it.\n\nTo reiterate a point from last month, if you voted for Trump because you expected foreign policy restraint, I have some awful news for you.",

        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "Democrats seem to have been outplayed by Republicans when it comes to managing the latest government shutdown battle. And perhaps their biggest mistake was underestimating House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La. By a 54-46 vote on Friday night, the Senate approved the funding bill to keep the government open that the Republican-controlled House had passed on Tuesday.\n\nAs bad as passing the continuing resolution would be, I believe a government shutdown is far worse. Senate minority leader chuck schumer\n\nThis shutdown cycle was not without drama. On Thursday, the evening before the deadline, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer reversed the position he’d taken earlier in the week and vowed to help pass the House’s short-term continuing resolution bill. This must have been a tough call for the New York Democrat. As Schumer wrote in an op-ed for The New York Times, “As bad as passing the continuing resolution would be, I believe a government shutdown is far worse.”\n\nAnd while Schumer did not ultimately vote yes on the bill itself, his advocacy and yes vote on the cloture motion likely secured Friday night’s outcome.\n\nOn Friday morning at least, the Democrats were torn into two camps: fight Trump tooth and nail, which would lead to a shutdown and the potential chaos and pain that would bring, or swallow a partisan CR and at least keep the lights on. There were also specific fears that a shutdown would allow President Donald Trump and Elon Musk to accelerate some of their most aggressive agenda items, including mass federal layoffs and governmental reorganizing. “Musk has already said he wants a shutdown, and public reporting has shown he is already making plans to expedite his destruction of key government programs and services,” said Schumer from the Senate floor on Thursday.\n\nSchumer calculated ultimately the Democrats would be blamed for the impact on “the most vulnerable Americans, those who rely on federal programs to feed their families, get medical care and stay financially afloat. Communities that depend on government services to function will suffer.”\n\nHowever, in many ways, the die had already been cast. On Tuesday night, Johnson passed the spending bill with nearly unanimous GOP support. And then promptly sent his members home.\n\nThe speaker certainly had some help from both the president and White House officials. Trump himself was working the phones, while Vice President JD Vance reportedly “assured Republican members that Trump would continue cutting federal funding with his Department of Government Efficiency initiative and pursue impoundment — that is, holding back money appropriated by Congress.”\n\nJohnson is often thought of as the accidental speaker. And it’s true that he was pulled out of quasi-obscurity after the caucus took down his predecessor Kevin McCarthy just 17 months ago. At the time of his elevation, Johnson had no leadership experience, and the political class had very low expectations. But he had Trump in his corner.\n\n(Trump did blow up a bill in December carefully negotiated by Johnson and House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries. But Johnson eventually prevailed, with Democratic votes, and a spending bill was passed.)\n\nLast December's funding bill was always a temporary stopgap measure that would only fund the federal government through March 13, 2025. More surprising was that Johnson was able to get the House to pass its budget outline last month, with only losing a single vote. This should have served as a canary in the coal mine moment for Democrats.\n\nThe real blunder Schumer made was miscalculating just how good Johnson has become at playing political hardball. The thought of Johnson passing a six-month continuing resolution with just Republican votes seemed highly unlikely last year, and that was what both Jeffries and Schumer were counting on. They were operating on the premise that, just like with the last CR, Republicans were going to need Democratic votes to get the bill to the president’s desk, leaving room for negotiations.\n\nJohnson defied the odds and passed the CR, losing just one Republican vote, and picking up an extra yes vote from Maine Democrat Jared Golden. That left Schumer floundering, and with only one option to keep the government open.\n\nThere is a lesson to be learned here, and now would be a good time for Democratic leadership — as well as Senate Majority Leader John Thune — to recognize Johnson’s skills. They don’t have to like him or agree with him, but going forward they should respect him, and maybe even fear him.",

        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "The Trump administration recently denied a funding request from the city of Asheville, North Carolina, to help its recovery from Hurricane Helene, telling the city it must cut a program meant to aid female and minority contractors. The mayor said the city has cut the reference to the program and now expects the plan to win approval.\n\nDuring the presidential campaign, Trump repeatedly used the devastation Helene wrought on North Carolina to spread lies and conspiracy theories about the Biden administration’s recovery efforts. In a speech in January, Trump claimed he’d be “taking strong action to get North Carolina the support that you need to quickly recover and rebuild,” and he specifically named Asheville as “a great place, and we’re going to have it be a great place again.”\n\n“Strong action” apparently comes with some strings attached. Because on Monday, Trump’s secretary for the Department of Housing and Urban Development, Scott Turner, denounced Asheville’s 125-page funding plan because of one line, in a section touting the plan’s benefits for vulnerable populations, that said some of the funds to support small businesses would help the city “prioritize assistance for Minority and Women Owned Businesses (MWBE) within the scoring criteria outlined within the policies and procedures.”\n\n“Once again, let me be clear DEI is dead at HUD,” said Turner in a statement. “We will not provide funding to any program or grantee that does not comply with President Trump’s executive orders.”\n\nNow, let me be clear: Nothing in the plan suggested women- and minority-owned businesses would be the sole — or the even primary — beneficiaries of any federal funding Asheville receives. The plan merely listed the program as one of many that could provide aid. But as I reported last February, many white conservatives have framed programs that help minority business owners, who often require assistance to counter discrimination they’ve longed faced from private industries, as discriminatory against white people.\n\nOn Tuesday, Asheville Mayor Ester Manheimer said Asheville, like many cities, “has a program around contracting with minority- and women-owned businesses,” adding, “Apparently, the reference to that existing program is not something that they want to see in the action plan.”\n\nThe next day, she said, “We have modified the action plan to reflect [Turner’s] concerns, and we’ve been told the changes that we’ve made were acceptable.”\n\nThis rigamarole raises serious concerns about how Los Angeles County might expect to navigate its need for recovery funds after the recent wildfires, especially because much of the damage ravaged historically Black communities like Altadena, where residents have already expressed fears of being erased in the recovery efforts.\n\nAs HUD secretary, Turner has moved quickly to remake the agency in Trump’s image. Last week, I wrote about HUD’s reported invitation to Christian nationalist Sean Feucht to help the agency survey damage from the L.A. County fires. Feucht declared he’d been brought along to offer “advice” and “give divine perspective” on recovery efforts. An agency spokesperson told MSNBC that Feucht doesn’t have an “official role” with HUD and refused to answer whether he’s offering guidance in an unofficial role.\n\nThe Trump administration seems eager to use disaster recovery funding to bring communities to heel and force its political will on left-leaning local governments that may not otherwise accept it.",

        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "“Can you explain what SCOTUS can do about birthright citizenship when it’s in the Constitution? How are they able to overturn the 14th Amendment?”\n\n— Peggy Giegucz, Pittsburgh\n\nHi Peggy,\n\nThe Supreme Court can’t overturn a constitutional amendment. But it can interpret the Constitution to make it seem like it’s overturning or at least contorting it. In other words, when the court hears an appeal involving the Constitution, it analyzes how it applies in a given case — whether that's what the First Amendment means for speech, the Second Amendment means for guns, and so on. Throughout the court’s history, dissenting justices have accused majorities of construing constitutional provisions contrary to their meaning and purpose.\n\nWhen it comes to birthright citizenship, we might soon learn what the justices have to say about that provision of the 14th Amendment: “All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.” Cases on the subject are making their way through the nation’s courts. So far, judges have roundly rejected the Trump administration. Just this week, a three-judge panel of the Boston-based federal appeals court handed the government its latest loss, after appellate panels based in San Francisco and Richmond likewise declined to lift trial court rulings against the administration while it appeals.\n\nOn Thursday, Trump asked the justices to halt the nationwide scope of those trial court rulings, which are keeping his policy on hold nationwide. To be sure, the justices could resolve this pending appeal without weighing in on the ultimate question of what they think the 14th Amendment protects. But how they address Trump’s procedural challenge could provide clues about how they would decide the underlying merits of his executive order.\n\nIf the Supreme Court eventually rules — contrary to longstanding precedent and historical evidence — that the Constitution doesn’t protect birthright citizenship, then whether the court would be literally overturning the 14th Amendment as opposed to gutting, betraying or undermining it could be a semantic argument, given how difficult it is to further amend the Constitution.\n\nIn theory, of course, the people and their elected representatives can vote to amend the Constitution in response to an unpopular Supreme Court ruling. In fact, the 14th Amendment did just that, effectively overturning the infamous Dred Scott ruling that affirmed slavery. But even if Americans somehow passed a new constitutional amendment making birthright citizenship clearer than it already is, the Supreme Court could attempt to undermine it through a creative interpretation.\n\nHave any questions or comments for me?

        "title": "Hazing death of Caleb Wilson at Southern University echoes Black Greek life pattern",
        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "In 2004, I was hired for the first time as an expert witness in a hazing death. Based on my experience advising fraternities and sororities, along with my research on these groups and career as an emerging leader in academia, the legal team thought I had expertise that would complement their legal training.\n\nThat case proved to be just the beginning. Over the ensuing decades, I have worked over two dozen hazing cases and been asked to work on another two dozen. I worked on the tragic case of two women who died pledging Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority in the early 2000s, and the high-profile death of a band drum major at Florida A&M University in 2011.\n\nWhen the news of 20-year-old Southern University and A&M College student Caleb Wilson’s death was first reported at the end of February, my instincts were activated.\n\nAfter a while, you start to see patterns develop. I look for artifacts that show these patterns, aided now by social media’s historical record. I closely examine depositions. And I look at the ages of the accused.\n\nWhen the news of 20-year-old Southern University and A&M College student Caleb Wilson’s death was first reported at the end of February, my instincts were activated. According to reports, the young man was pledging Omega Psi Phi fraternity, but ended up dumped at a nearby hospital by a group of men who claimed he had been injured playing basketball. Staff at the hospital called the police, who later told reporters Wilson died “as a direct result of a hazing incident where he was punched in the chest multiple times.\"\n\nThe circumstances reminded me of the 1994 death of Michael Davis at Southeast Missouri State. His Kappa Alpha Psi “brothers” only called 911 the next morning, when they found him unresponsive with a greenish black liquid coming from his mouth. The official story, which quickly fell apart, was that Davis had been hurt playing football. In reality, Davis had been brutally beaten to death.\n\nThe first person arrested in Caleb Wilson’s case, an undergraduate student, was listed as 23. Several days later, a 25-year-old student was also arrested. The final suspect is a 28-year-old graduate student who, according to reports, served as Wilson's dean of pledges.\n\nI was not surprised. Rather, this awful tragedy reaffirms for me a consistent problem in Black Greek-lettered undergraduate organizations. I worked a hazing case in 2006 in which a young man almost died after drinking excessive amounts of water. The ringleader in that tragedy was 28 years old. And the whole time I was thinking, “Why is this guy even involved in an undergraduate activity?\" Indeed, I’ve examined several years of cases where at least one of the suspects arrested was in the 24- to 30-year-old range. I call these individuals “extended adolescents,” and they pose a particularly alarming risk to college campus safety.\n\nIn Wilson’s case, it seems two of the suspects were still undergraduate students. But I've often found extended adolescents to be graduated undergraduates or grad students, unemployed or underemployed. They are extending their adolescence through their presence on campus.\n\nThis group has become a serious problem for Black fraternities and sororities. They are often invisible. They may be too old to be in the undergraduate chapter, and the official leaders of the organizations may not know them. They have not matured enough to engage with their adult peers and instead cling to their “old head” status and seek the respect of younger students.\n\nThey remind me of Peter Pan, the boy who wouldn’t grow up, leading their lost boy pledges down a potentially deadly path.\n\nCaleb Wilson. Southern University and A&M College, Baton Rouge, La.\n\nCampus leaders, chapter advisors and national organizations must often and openly signal that extended adolescents have no place leading, officially or unofficially, undergraduate chapters. Their presence on campus is a warning signal. Administrators ignore it at their peril.\n\nHigher education must also work with high schools and middle schools to begin routine anti-hazing campaigns all year round. And despite the many horror stories, many high school students come to college having already experienced hazing. Schools should partner with groups like the Ad Council to make sure anti-hazing messages are as routine as warnings about drugs and alcohol.\n\nOn Friday, Caleb Wilson will be honored on the Southern University campus with a celebration of life. “He was a bright light in Jaguar Nation, a dedicated scholar, and a proud member of the world-renowned Human Jukebox,” school Chancellor John K. Pierre said in a statement. “Caleb Wilson’s kindness, passion, and unwavering spirit left a lasting impact on all who had the privilege of knowing him. As we mourn this tremendous loss, we also come together to celebrate his life and legacy with his family.”\n\nWilson’s friends and family will also likely be wondering what justice looks like in this case. Louisiana has one of the toughest hazing laws in the nation, a change enacted after the hazing death of a young man named Max Gruver in 2017. That means that if found guilty, the suspects in Wilson’s killing will likely be punished to the maximum extent possible. They should become the new poster boys for what happens when these rituals turn deadly.\n\nWe still do not have all the facts in Wilson's case, but what we do know still feels all too familiar. At an anti-hazing presentation I gave in 2011, this appeared on a slide: “If these people (extended adolescents) are at sessions, you are in danger — they kill people.” Almost 15 years later, I fear that statement is unfortunately still true.",

        "title": "Angry and erratic: Trump Cabinet official admits the president is acting on emotion in trade war",
        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "This is an adapted excerpt from the March 13 episode of “All In with Chris Hayes.”\n\nThe president of the United States, the man with the nuclear codes, is angry, emotional and acting erratically. That’s not my judgment — it’s basically what his own Cabinet defenders are saying.\n\nOn Thursday, Donald Trump’s Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick joined Bloomberg Television to talk about how the president is shocked that the trade war he launched against America’s closest allies, Canada and the European Union, is suddenly blowing up in his face.\n\nAll of this is happening for literally no reason whatsoever other than the fact Trump is picking a fight with our neighbors.\n\n“The president was totally annoyed that the Europeans did this,” Lutnick said. “He cares about America, and he wants to take care of Americans. And why are Europeans picking on Kentucky bourbon, Harley-Davidson motorcycles?” When Lutnick was asked if this was an “emotional response” from the president, he called the E.U.’s move “disrespectful.”\n\n“He wants these countries to respect him, and all of this showed you is that Europe and Canada do not respect Donald Trump,” Lutnick added. “If you make him unhappy, he responds unhappy.”\n\nOn Wall Street, stocks continue to fall amid fears of higher prices from Trump’s tariffs and threats. The S&P 500 fell 10% below its all-time high on Thursday, raising concerns among investors that a sell-off might be happening soon. The Nasdaq is already in that worrying territory. The Dow Jones was on track for its worst week since that string of high-profile bank failures in 2023.\n\nAll of this is happening for literally no reason whatsoever, other than the fact Trump is picking a fight with our neighbors. Now that our neighbors are fighting back, Trump is big mad, throwing out new threats of massive tariffs and annexation of foreign territories.\n\nIn a vicious cycle of escalation, Canada and the E.U. responded to Trump’s tariffs by imposing new taxes on U.S. exports, including on signature American products like, as Lutnick mentioned, whiskey and motorcycles. When Trump heard about that retaliation, he basically lost it and made an unhinged post on Truth Social:\n\nThe European Union, one of the most hostile and abusive taxing and tariffing authorities in the World, which was formed for the sole purpose of taking advantage of the United States, has just put a nasty 50% Tariff on Whisky. If this Tariff is not removed immediately, the U.S. will shortly place a 200% Tariff on all WINES, CHAMPAGNES, & ALCOHOLIC PRODUCTS COMING OUT OF FRANCE AND OTHER E.U. REPRESENTED COUNTRIES. This will be great for the Wine and Champagne businesses in the U.S.\n\nNow, to be clear, the U.S. does not technically have any Champagne businesses, but we are the biggest market for Champagne and many other French wines. Trump is threatening a tax at such a high level that the price of a bottle of wine would essentially double for Americans. Everybody who understands trade understands this is insane. I think even people who don’t understand trade understand this is insane.\n\nIt was a point that even Emma Tucker, the editor-in-chief of the right-leaning Wall Street Journal, made on Thursday. “[The] mood has shifted pretty much since all the tariffs started coming in,” Tucker said on Fox Business. “I think businesses realize now Trump is serious about this, but the problem they’ve got is that they’re being imposed in a very haphazard way, and that’s creating so much instability.” When asked if companies would pass costs on to consumers, Tucker said “eventually they’re gonna have to.”\n\nAn hour after that interview, Trump posted to Truth Social again:\n\nThe Globalist Wall Street Journal has no idea what they are doing or saying. They are owned by the polluted thinking of the European Union, which was formed for the primary purpose of ‘screwing’ the United States of America. Their (WSJ!) thinking is antiquated and weak, and very bad for the USA.\n\nLater in the White House, sitting next to the secretary-general of NATO, Trump took a question about his tariffs and started musing, yet again, about the territorial conquest of Canada, a fellow NATO member. Trump also talked about annexing Greenland from Denmark.\n\nAll in all, the American president spent his day annoyed and emotional about the trade war he started, and then obsessed some more about making Canada and Greenland part of America. All while CEOs, investors and regular people are absolutely freaking out about the economy.\n\nAnd it looks like no one is going to stop him — at least, certainly not Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who tried and failed to put a positive spin on this unfolding economic disaster. During an interview on CNBC on Thursday, Bessent said the Trump administration was “focused on the real economy.”\n\n“I’m not concerned about a little bit of volatility over three weeks,” Bessent said. “The reason stocks are a safe and great investment is because you’re looking over the long term. If you start looking at micro-horizons, stocks become very risky.”\n\nIt’s gotten so bad that even Tesla, the electric car company owned by Trump’s unelected co-president Elon Musk, is worried about the impact of tariffs on its bottom line. In an unsigned letter, the company warned Trump’s trade representatives that the president’s trade war would make it more expensive to build cars in America.\n\nOne person familiar with the process of sending the letter told the Financial Times: “It’s a polite way to say that the bipolar tariff regime is screwing over Tesla.” The person added: “It is unsigned because nobody at the company wants to be fired for sending it.”",

        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "On Tuesday, press secretary Karoline Leavitt repeated one of the White House’s favorite talking points about President Donald Trump’s trade war. After reporters questioned Leavitt about his repeated promises on the campaign trail to lower taxes for everyday Americans, the press secretary said the president is “not implementing tax hikes.” She told reporters Trump’s tariffs were a “tax hike on foreign countries” and a “tax cut for the American people.”\n\nRepublican Sen. Markwayne Mullin of Oklahoma contradicted the press secretary’s claim. “Tariffs is a tax, and it will be passed on consumers,” Mullin told CNN.\n\nLeavitt is either ignorant about how tariffs work or purposely dishonest — either way, imposing them still leads the United States down the same dangerous economic path. Almost every economist will tell you that tariffs make nations less prosperous. During Trump’s first term, studies showed that his tariffs hurt consumers. This time around, his proposals are much more far-reaching, which means potentially even larger negative economic impacts for everyday Americans.\n\nBut don’t take my word for it. On Wednesday, Republican Sen. Markwayne Mullin of Oklahoma contradicted the press secretary’s claim. “Tariffs is a tax, and it will be passed on consumers,” Mullin told CNN. Mullin then said this is a fact the president is well aware of, “something that the president, who is a businessperson, understands that completely.”\n\nThe Trump administration’s repeated public denial of basic economics isn’t the only way the White House is trying to spin the president’s trade war. During Wednesday’s briefing, Leavitt again deflected blame over the economy on former President Joe Biden. But the facts tell a different story: Trump inherited a historically strong economy.\n\nSo no matter what the White House tries to say, this is not Biden’s fault. The previous president handed Trump a strong post-pandemic economy that was the envy of the world and now, the United States is the embarrassment of the world. Trump owns that — and he owns the disastrous impact his trade war will have on American consumers, as does every other Republican who touches his administration.",

        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "Just more than a dozen years ago, Republicans' talking point was that the president of the United States should not have promoted a politically connected but troubled company.\n\nWhen Barack Obama ran for re-election in 2012, GOP lawmakers seized on the catchphrase \"crony capitalism\" to bash him for giving a speech to workers at a solar panel manufacturing plant run by Solyndra, which had received a loan guarantee under his economic stimulus program.\n\nAfter the company went bankrupt, Republicans argued that records showed the loan guarantee was rushed (true) and the company was backed by Obama donors (mostly false).\n\nNow, in President Donald Trump’s administration, crony capitalism isn't an attack line; it's the plan.\n\nOn Tuesday, Trump sidled up to a shiny red Tesla Model S in front of the White House, clutching a handwritten note that said you could drive off in one today for “as low as $299/month.” The goal was to boost the company run by his biggest donor, billionaire federal contractor and special government employee Elon Musk, after its stock dramatically collapsed because of an ongoing boycott, uncertainty from Trump's trade wars and poor sales of its ungainly Cybertruck.\n\nTrump even wrote a check right there for the $80,000 car and said he would buy one for his 17-year-old granddaughter.\n\nPresident Donald Trump holds notes on the pricing of Tesla vehicles as he delivers remarks on the South Lawn of the White House on Tuesday. Andrew Harnik / Getty Images\n\nIf a social media influencer had posted a video like this, the Federal Trade Commission might require it to come with the hashtag #sponsored and an admission that it was a paid promotion. This was \"sponcon\" on the White House lawn, to use the shorthand term for sponsored content. And it was crony capitalism for the richest person on the planet, whose wealth happens to be tied up in Tesla stock.\n\nTo be clear, presidents have long promoted American businesses. Teddy Roosevelt supposedly coined the Maxwell House ad slogan \"good to the last drop\" after having a cup, and Joe Biden once took a Ford F-150 Lightning for a spin, saying \"this sucker's quick.\" (Sadly, the Ford Motor Co. did not pick that up as a slogan.)\n\nBut neither Maxwell House nor Ford executives worked in the White House. Neither made massive donations to a presidential campaign. Trump was trying to help his top political ally by using the White House as a backdrop for free advertising, like some President's Day car sale come to life.\n\nIn fact, the closest precedent in U.S. history comes from Trump's first term, when he posted a photo giving two thumbs up from the Resolute Desk in the Oval Office with cans of Goya beans and other products in front of him. In that case, too, the president was trying to boost a company facing a boycott over its association with him, as Goya's CEO was in hot water for having praised Trump.\n\nAt least in that case, we know that Trump actually likes taco bowls. But this week's commercial for Tesla came after years of bashing electric cars, which he has said will leave you stranded in the desert, \"cost a fortune\" and are only \"good if you have a towing company.\" He'd even specifically lambasted Teslas in the past, saying they \"don't drive long enough\" and the self-driving options \"crash.\"\n\nBeyond just the cheap sales pitch, Trump had some chilling words that portend an even more serious effort to shore up Tesla. During the event, Trump ramped up his response to the spate of vandalism against Teslas in recent weeks, saying that \"violence against Tesla dealership will be labeled as domestic terrorism\" and that any vandals who are caught are \"going to go through hell\" for \"harming a great American company.\"\n\nTrump said that \"radical left lunatics\" are \"illegally and collusively\" boycotting Tesla.\n\nAnd in a Truth Social post Tuesday, Trump said that \"radical left lunatics\" are \"illegally and collusively\" boycotting Tesla.\n\nIn Trump's first administration, his staffers would have interpreted these comments as hot air. In his second, they're far more likely to treat them as marching orders. His hyperpartisan acting U.S. attorney in D.C. has already threatened a private university for its diversity policies and a U.S. senator for a mildly inappropriate comment made years ago. And Trump now has a Justice Department that he hopes to turn into his own personal law firm.\n\nFor now, it is still legal to exercise your First Amendment right to protest Tesla or simply refuse to buy its products. Ill-advised vandals will still be charged with misdemeanors in state court, not federal felonies that can carry a sentence of up to life in prison. And Tesla is still a private company that just happens to be owned by the president's BFF, not the recipient of its own massive federal contract.\n\nBut we'll see how long that lasts, and whether any Republicans who lambasted Obama's supposed \"crony capitalism\" want to stop the real version that's happening right in front of them.",

        "content": "The Trump administration has sent a letter to Columbia University’s interim president and board of trustees that includes a list of demands the school must meet if it wants the administration to reverse its cancellation of $400 million in federal funds Columbia was authorized to receive.\n\nThe letter, sent Thursday, is an ultimatum that demands Columbia make changes and impose policies to align it with the MAGA movement’s political views. It is essentially a ransom note, outlining steps Columbia must take “as a precondition for formal negotiations” on restoring the millions in government funding the university had been awarded.\n\nAmong the steps the administration demands is that Columbia place its Middle East, South Asian and African Studies Department under academic receivership, which would effectively give control over the program to a chair outside of Columbia’s faculty — a move that smacks of textbook racism. But the administration’s list of demands goes much further, requiring that Columbia:\n\nhand out expulsions or multiyear suspensions to demonstrators who participated in pro-Palestinian protests inside Hamilton Hall last year.

        "title": "Why ICE arresting Mahmoud Khalil should worry all Americans",
        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "Even though I have criticized anti-Zionist campus activism for relentlessly obstructing the core mission of American institutions of higher education, the arrest and potential deportation of Mahmoud Khalil, a Palestinian activist at Columbia University, makes me uneasy. Khalil was arrested by Immigration and Customs Enforcement in New York City on Saturday and transported to an ICE detention facility in Louisiana. The charges against him are, at this moment, vague.\n\nThe arrest and potential deportation of Mahmoud Khalil makes me uneasy.\n\nSocial media posts from President Donald Trump and comments from White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt and Secretary of State Marco Rubio suggest Khalil is a national security threat. Though she didn’t provide proof of her claim, Leavitt said of Khalil, “This is an individual who organized group protests that not only disrupted college campus classes and harassed Jewish American students and made them feel unsafe on their own content, but also distributed pro-Hamas propaganda, flyers with the logo of Hamas.” A social media post from the Department of Homeland Security says Khalil “led activities tied to Hamas, a designated terrorist organization.”My queasiness at the government’s response to Khalil’s activism and the vagueness of the accusations against him is shared by other liberal Jewish Americans. They constitute a large segment of the Jewish American population, one that President Trump has accused of hating Israel, hating themselves and being “disloyal.” Trump also said last year that if he lost the presidential election, liberal Jews would be partially to blame. And just Thursday, Trump became a gentile rabbinical court unto himself by proclaiming Sen. Chuck Schumer to not be a Jew.\n\nLiberal Jews, I would note, have reacted to Khalil’s arrest in broadly similar ways. Many disagree with, and deplore, Khalil’s leadership role in a Columbia anti-Israel movement whose actions ranged from incendiary rhetoric to the forcible occupation of university grounds. Yet they generally see his arrest as an existential threat to the FirstAmendment, academicinstitutions and the general health of Americandemocracy.Liberal Jewish Americans, like all of their compatriots, have a right to know if the allegations against Khalil are valid. If, for example, the government can provide evidence that Khalil has aided or abetted a terrorist group, then the government’s actions are, in my opinion, likely justified. If they are not — and they presently appear not to be — then Khalil's arrest would seem to represent a threat to the civil liberties of everybody in America.\n\nLet me acknowledge that the more I read about the legal issues involved in Khalil's arrest, the murkier the case becomes. Is the murkiness a coincidence? That the administration pursued this action against this particular person with this particular citizenship status points to the under-discussed ingenuity of Trump’s legal teams. They have consistently displayed an uncanny ability to find gray areas within the law and resurrect mothballed edicts. Remember the Trump administration’s invocation of the 1807 Insurrection Act? The 1798 Alien Enemies Act? The 1873 Comstock Act?\n\nLiberal Jewish-Americans, like all of their compatriots, have a right to know if the allegations against Khalil are valid\n\nKhalil is not an American citizen. He possesses a green card and is married to an American citizen. Does his status as a legal permanent resident in any way diminish his free speech rights compared to a full citizen? According to some scholars, the law here is murky. In other words, the government’s interpretation of how free speech rights intersect with citizenship status may be unusual but legally permissible (and that is where the aforementioned murky ingenuity of Trump’s counselors enters this saga). Aside from the discussions regarding national security and immigration status, the arrest of Khalil raises significant free speech concerns. What kind of speech is in question? I’d be the first to insist that slogans, chants, flyers and other such effusions are not instances of protected academic free speech. That’s a form of specialized discourse which is generally monitored and regulated by institutions of higher education. Academic free speech is associated with complex credentialing mechanisms that are almost uniquely reserved for professors, which Khalil is not.\n\nBut based on what we know, Khalil’s political speech is constitutionally protected. In America, we have a robust right to say offensive, mean things that infuriate others. One of the fears raised by the government’s actions is that sometime soon — like really soon — the administration will round up other people whose speech it abhors. Might the “disloyal” Jews who the president believed nearly cost him the election fall into that category? Liberal Jewish Americans are an evergreen target of the MAGA movement. They are also a target of Jews with markedly different politics than their own — like leftist anti-Zionists and right-wing supporters of Trump and Benjamin Netanyahu. Still, there is something very American about their response to this crisis. Many are disregarding whatever personal feelings they may have about Khalil’s anti-Zionism in the name of broader national ideals.\n\nThere are Palestinian Americans who seem inclined to establish similar degrees of critical distance and put America first, so to speak. They call for calm, pragmatism, dialogue and reasoned analysis. For all hyphenated Americans traumatized by this piteous endless conflict, this might be the sanest, most patriotic way forward.",

        "content": "Republican Rep. Tony Gonzales of Texas appeared on CNN earlier this week and had nothing but positive things to say about Elon Musk and the quasi-governmental Department of Government Efficiency. “I think it’s good for us to have this dialogue,” the GOP congressman said. “DOGE is very popular in my district.”\n\nA day earlier, The Associated Press reported that Republican Rep. Richard Hudson, the chair of the National Republican Congressional Committee, expressed great optimism about the 2026 election cycle — because, the North Carolinian said, “The cuts pushed by the Department of Government Efficiency are resonating with voters.”\n\nThere’s a whole lot of evidence to the contrary. Consider the latest national poll from Quinnipiac University, which included a summary of public attitudes about Donald Trump’s biggest campaign donor and his radical DOGE endeavor.\n\nSixty percent of voters disapprove of the way Elon Musk and the Department of Government Efficiency, known as DOGE, are dealing with workers employed by the federal government, while 36 percent approve. ... Fifty-four percent of voters think Elon Musk and DOGE are hurting the country, while 40 percent think they are helping the country.\n\nThe day before the Quinnipiac data was released, a national CNN poll conducted by SSRS found that Americans’ attitudes toward Musk “are largely negative.”\n\nJust 35% of Americans express a positive view of Musk, with 53% rating him negatively. ... Roughly 6 in 10 Americans say that Musk has neither the right experience nor the right judgment to make changes to the way the government works. There is uneasiness about Musk even among some of the president’s supporters: 28% of those who see Trump’s changes to the government as necessary doubt the tech billionaire has the judgment to carry them out.\n\nThis comes on the heels of a Washington Post/Ipsos poll that found the billionaire Republican megadonor with a 34% approval rating. (For more information on the surveys’ methodologies and margins of error, click on any of the above links.)\n\nThe obvious response to results like these is that public attitudes toward Musk are of limited relevance. He is not an elected official; his name will probably never appear on a ballot; and he need not worry about re-election. Perhaps, the argument goes, he has the luxury of indifference when it comes to the prevailing political winds.\n\nThe closer one looks, however, the harder it is to believe this argument. Even putting aside the likelihood that Musk’s popularity (or lack thereof) will affect his business empire and its stockholders, the more politically salient point is that Republicans’ interests have suddenly become intertwined with the DOGE initiative — which necessarily means that as his public standing sinks, Musk is likely to drag his GOP allies down with him.\n\nAll of which brings us back to the NRCC chair, who apparently believes “the cuts pushed by the Department of Government Efficiency are resonating with voters.” My follow-up questions for Hudson are simple:\n\nAre you sure? Are you willing to bet your party’s near-future on those assumptions?",

        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "A Texas family on their way to an emergency medical check-up for their 10-year-old daughter, who is recovering from brain cancer, was detained by immigration authorities and hastily deported to Mexico last month.\n\nIn early February, Customs and Border Protection stopped the family at an immigration checkpoint while they were traveling from Rio Grande, Texas, where they lived, to Houston, where their daughter’s specialists are located — a trip the family had made at least five other times before without incident, according to an attorney representing the family.\n\nDuring their previous trips, the undocumented parents of the 10-year-old, who is a U.S. citizen, were allowed through the checkpoint after presenting authorities with letters from lawyers and their daughter’s doctors. This time, however, authorities deemed those letters insufficient and arrested the parents for not providing proper documentation. The family’s attorney said the parents have no criminal history.\n\nIn addition to the 10-year-old girl, four other children, all but one born in the U.S., were in the car with the parents when they were detained. The parents were then forced to make a difficult decision: Return to Mexico as a family, or leave their children behind in the U.S. As NBC News reports, that’s hardly a choice:\n\n[U]ndocumented parents of U.S.-born children, if picked up by immigration authorities, face the risk of losing custody of their children. Without a power-of-attorney document or a guardianship outlining who will take care of the children left behind, the children go into the U.S. foster care system, making it harder for the parents to regain custody of their children in the future.\n\nThe family ultimately decided to remain together.\n\nThe 10-year-old girl was diagnosed with brain cancer last year and recently underwent surgery to remove the tumor. Doctors in Houston have been closely monitoring her recovery.\n\nAfter the family was detained, the mother, who spoke exclusively to NBC News, said authorities took the family to a detention center, where they separated her and her daughters from her husband and sons. Within hours, CBP agents loaded the family into a van and dropped them in Mexico.\n\nAfter spending time in a shelter, the family has moved into a house. However, according to the mother, her children are unable to sleep due to concerns about their safety, having been left in an area of Mexico where U.S. citizens are often kidnapped.\n\nThe 10-year-old isn’t the only member of the family who is being treated for a medical condition. The couple’s 15-year-old son has a heart disorder known as Long QT syndrome, which causes irregular heartbeats and can be life-threatening if not properly treated. The mother told NBC News both children are unable to receive the health care they need in Mexico.\n\nIn a post on X, the Congressional Hispanic Caucus called the family’s deportation “a new low” and said the Trump administration has “lost all humanity.”\n\nBefore Donald Trump took office, immigrant advocacy groups raised the alarm over how his mass deportation policies could affect mixed-status families (that is, families in which some members are undocumented while others are U.S. citizens). According to estimates from the American Immigration Council, as many as 4 million mixed-status families are at risk of being separated under Trump’s policies.\n\nWhen Trump’s border czar, Tom Homan, was asked in December how he would approach deporting mixed-status families, he told The Washington Post that the risk of separation was ultimately the fault of the parents.\n\n“Here’s the issue,” Homan said. “You knew you were in the country illegally and chose to have a child. So you put your family in that position.”",

        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "What exactly have Elon Musk and DOGE been up to? A new court ruling could help provide some answers.\n\nOn Wednesday, U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan granted a request for expedited discovery in a lawsuit brought by Democratic-led states challenging Musk’s and the Department of Government Efficiency’s authority. The plaintiff states are seeking “to identify DOGE personnel and the parameters of DOGE’s and Musk’s authority — a question central to Plaintiffs’ claims,” Chutkan wrote in an opinion explaining her decision.\n\nIf the judge’s name sounds familiar, she also presided over one of Donald Trump’s four criminal cases before he won the 2024 presidential election. In this current civil case, Chutkan emphasized in her ruling that the plaintiffs aren’t seeking information from Trump himself.\n\nThe discovery requests “shall be limited to information and materials regarding agencies, employees, contracts, grants, federal funding, legal agreements, databases, or data management systems that involve or engage with Plaintiff States, including entities and institutions operated or funded by Plaintiff States,” Chutkan wrote in her order. She said Musk and DOGE must produce the requested documents and respond to questions within three weeks.\n\nThe states wrote in their discovery motion that they want to “confirm what investigative reporting has already indicated”: that Musk and DOGE “are directing actions within federal agencies that have profoundly harmed the States and will continue to harm them.” The states also wrote that the government said Musk “is merely an advisor to the President, with no authority to direct agency action and no role at DOGE. The public record refutes that implausible assertion. But only Defendants possess the documents and information that Plaintiffs need to confirm public reporting and identify which agencies Defendants will target next so Plaintiffs can seek preliminary relief and mitigate further harm.”\n\nOpposing expedited discovery, the government defendants said the plaintiffs sought “extraordinary relief” and material that’s “not relevant to their claims.”\n\nAs to relevance, Chutkan noted in her ruling that the states want information regarding Musk’s and DOGE’s involvement in “(1) eliminating or reducing the size of federal agencies; (2) terminating or placing federal employees on leave; (3) cancelling, freezing, or pausing federal contracts, grants, or other federal funding; and (4) obtaining access, using, or making changes to federal databases or data management systems.” The judge wrote that evidence regarding the defendants’ elimination of agencies that work with the plaintiff states, termination of employees responsible for managing programs with the states, or cancellation of contracts with the states “is relevant to whether Defendants exceeded their statutory and constitutional authority.”\n\nChutkan had previously rejected the states’ bid for a temporary restraining order against Musk and DOGE. But the latest ruling is a reminder that the suit isn’t over yet.\n\nSubscribe to the Deadline: Legal Newsletter for expert analysis on the top legal stories of the week, including updates from the Supreme Court and developments in the Trump administration’s legal cases.",

        "title": "Trump's humiliation of Zelenskyy is plain as day in the rare minerals deal",
        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "If Ukraine needs a wake-up call regarding how much agency it truly has, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s humiliating decision to sign the rare minerals deal, which would see America and Ukraine jointly extract valuable raw materials such as lithium and titanium, will do the trick. It’s hard to get more symbolic than watching the head of a client state get lambasted in the Oval Office, having the United States cut off sharing intelligence with his military, then shambling back over to his overseer to pay up.\n\nThere are, however, two underreported facets to this shameful episode that can help us understand the nature of both Washington and Ukraine. We can witness, in real time, the masks coming off of Washington’s foreign policy complex; we can also see why this particular betrayal is so traumatic and painful given Ukraine’s tragic history.\n\nWe can witness, in real time, the masks coming off of Washington’s foreign policy complex.\n\nThe refreshing thing about President Donald Trump is that he speaks the quiet part out loud. Politicians and think tankers who comprise Washington’s sprawling foreign policy establishment — “the Blob,” as it was called by Obama deputy national security adviser Ben Rhodes — love warbling about Ukraine’s battling on the front lines of freedom and Kyiv’s being our cherished partner, brimming with agency and sovereignty.\n\nTrump doesn’t warble. Trump, who loves harping on Europe’s needing to pay for its own security, has made it clear that freedom ain’t free: If Ukraine wants the weapons it needs to hold Russia at bay, it better cough up its minerals.\n\nThe thing is, when it comes to looting Ukraine, the Blob is little different from Trump. Foreign policy insiders’ lofty concerns about Kyiv’s agency evaporate in the face of economic “opportunities.”\n\n“Putin had two goals in invading Ukraine: robbing its territory, and robbing its sovereignty by preventing them from joining NATO,” thundered Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., on Feb. 16.\n\nBut just one day prior, Sen. Coons was striking a markedly different tone about Ukraine’s minerals.\n\n“If this is an investment opportunity where American companies and other companies from Europe would be involved in mining and processing, so that we can be independent of Chinese sources of these strategic minerals, and if his helps deepen and strengthen our partnership to help ensure the security of Ukraine going forward ... that would be a positive thing,” he told CNBC.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin’s robbing Ukraine is a horrific violation of sovereignty; the United States’ doing so is a positive. Let freedom ring.\n\nOr take Peter Dickinson — the editor of a Ukraine-centric blog for the Atlantic Council, a Washington-based foreign policy think tank that receives funding from arms manufacturer Lockheed Martin, the kingdom of Bahrain, the Charles Koch Foundation and the U.S. Energy Department, among other luminaries. “We hear lots of talk about geopolitics and what Putin wants, but we should not underestimate the agency of the Ukrainian people or their desire for a democratic European future,” Dickinson told Bloomberg in 2022.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin’s robbing Ukraine is a horrific violation of sovereignty; the United States’ doing so is a positive. Let freedom ring.\n\nLater that year, the X handle of Business Ukraine Mag (a publication edited and published by Dickinson) took Elon Musk to the woodshed, posting, “Elon Musk seems unaware that Ukrainian sovereignty is not up for discussion.” Things appear to have changed last month, however, when Dickinson was quoted in a Politico article with the amazing headline “Ukraine reels in Trump with mineral riches.” (It could have also read: “Bully’s victim reels in bully with lunch money.”)\n\nDickinson acknowledged that for Kyiv, it “would mean a lot less mineral wealth in future” before adding, “But I doubt anyone is very concerned about that.” He continued, “Compared to the alternative of the country being wiped off the map entirely, it looks like a very good deal indeed! Most Ukrainians certainly seem to view it as perhaps distasteful but ultimately a no-brainer.”\n\nThe hypocrisy of Ukraine’s purported Washington advocates only deepens given the role its territorial resources play in Ukraine’s identity — and the danger that could lurk for Zelenskyy, of all people, if he is strong-armed into conceding them.\n\nIt’s hard to overstate the role land plays in the Ukrainian psyche. One modern interpretation of the country’s blue-over-yellow flag is that it represents blue skies over the golden wheat fields of Ukraine. Even the months of the year are named after the agricultural cycle — August is Sickle-time, for the harvest; November is Leaf-fall, for autumn.\n\nThis love of their land — and fear of losing it — was watered with blood after Holodomor: the 1932-1933 manmade famine, courtesy of Soviet dictator Josef Stalin, after he ordered the grain seized from Ukraine. The famine, which many (including me) consider a genocide, saw almost 4 million Ukrainians perish of hunger. Every morning, dead bodies littered the streets as people collapsed where they walked. Cannibalism was commonplace.\n\nStalin sold the stolen wheat to industrialize the Soviet Union, including its military, which was used to keep Kyiv under Moscow’s power for the next 50-plus years; Ukraine’s grain helped forge Ukraine’s chains.\n\nUltranationalist elements of Ukraine seized on Holodomor to create the antisemitic lie that the famine was orchestrated by Jews. Starting with World War II, that deadly trope was used to “justify” Ukrainian participation in the Holocaust, a “you killed us, we killed you” narrative that persists on the Ukrainian far right to this day.\n\nYou can see it in graffiti scrawled on a Jewish social services center in the western city of Uzhhorod in 2017: “We remember. 1932-1933. We’ll take revenge.” The years referred to the famine; the graffiti appeared on the day Ukraine commemorates Holodomor victims.\n\nThe image of Zelenskyy, Ukraine’s first Jewish president, signing away his country’s rare minerals couldn’t be more perfect for Ukraine’s far right. He might as well be maniacally rubbing his hands together while being handed a bag with dollar signs.\n\nConsidering Kyiv is teetering on losing the war, which could unleash various nightmare scenarios, that image is not just disgusting but dangerous. Jews haven’t done well when they have been blamed for wars.\n\nThe kicker to the rare minerals deal is that much of the resources are in Ukraine’s east, either in Russia-controlled territory or in a no-man’s-land covered with land mines. Realistically, Zelenskyy has as much ability to give them away as I do. The only bankable outcome of this sordid mess is just a further painful reminder of how screwed Ukraine is.",

        "content": "Arlington National Cemetery has purged its website of pages about notable Black, Hispanic and women veterans, as well as information about the Civil War and Black history, as the Trump administration’s ongoing effort to remove references to “diversity and inclusion” on government webpages.\n\nAmong the pages that have disappeared from the cemetery’s website include links on the graves of prominent minority veterans, as well as educational pages on the Civil War, African American history and women’s history. Some of the information has been removed outright, while others were placed under categories that do not mention race or gender.\n\nAn archived version of the website’s educational page on African American history at the cemetery, for example, features a range of learning materials on the Civil Rights Movement and Black war heroes. That information no longer appears on the page.\n\nAn unnamed cemetery spokesperson told The Washington Post that links to webpages listing “Notable Graves” of Black, Hispanic and female veterans were taken down, and that the cemetery is working to make sure that content on its website complies with the administration’s policies.\n\nFirst reported by Civil War historian Kevin M. Levin and the military news publication Task & Purpose, the change follows Trump’s assault on diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives across the federal government.\n\nThe anti-DEI push has had a huge impact on the Defense Department in particular, where Secretary Pete Hegseth has vowed to get rid of what he calls “wokeness” in the military. Trump also fired the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Air Force Gen. C.Q. Brown, the second Black man to hold the top military position, and pushed out Adm. Lisa Franchetti, the head of the U.S. Navy and the first woman to lead any branch of the armed forces.\n\n“I think the single dumbest phrase in military history is ‘our diversity is our strength,’” Hegseth told Pentagon staff just days after being confirmed as defense secretary.\n\nSince then, the Defense Intelligence Agency has banned all activities related to cultural heritage celebrations, including Black History Month, Asian American and Pacific Islander Heritage Month, National American Indian Heritage Month, LGBTQ Pride Month, Women’s History Month, Juneteenth, Martin Luther King Jr. Day and Holocaust Remembrance Day.\n\nThe Pentagon is also seeking to bar trans people from serving in the military.\n\nIn February, chief Pentagon spokesperson Sean Parnell wrote a memo ordering officials to “remove all DoD news and feature articles, photos, and videos that promote Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion” by March 5. The Associated Press reported last week that the Pentagon has marked for removal more than 26,000 images of veterans from a diverse range of backgrounds and identities — which included an image of a B-29 aircraft that dropped the first atomic bomb on Hiroshima during World War II, the AP reported, because it was named “Enola Gay.”",

        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "The United States has expelled South African Ambassador Ebrahim Rasool for criticizing the Trump administration, further heightening tensions between the two countries.\n\nIn a post on X Friday, Secretary of State Marco Rubio wrote that Rasool was “no longer welcome in our great country,” calling him a “race-baiting politician who hates America” and President Donald Trump.\n\n“We have nothing to discuss with him and so he is considered PERSONA NON GRATA,” Rubio wrote.\n\nThe New York Times reported that the expulsion was official, citing a spokesperson for the South African president.\n\nIn his social media post, Rubio included a link to an article from the far-right website Breitbart on recent remarks Rasool gave to a research institute in Johannesburg about U.S. demographics moving away from a white majority (Rasool’s commentary begins at the 1:23 mark in the linked video). The article characterized Rasool’s comments as a claim that Trump is leading a “global white supremacist movement.”\n\nRasool spoke about a “supremacist assault on incumbency in U.S. politics,” pointing to the MAGA movement “as a response, not simply to a supremacist instinct, but to very clear data that shows great demographic shifts in the USA in which the voting electorate in the USA is projected to become 48% white, and that the possibility of a majority of minorities is looming on the horizon.”\n\nRasool also pointed to billionaire Elon Musk’s and Vice President JD Vance’s recent overtures to far-right political movements in Europe.\n\nRelations between the U.S. and South Africa have been strained in Trump’s new administration. Last month, the president signed an executive order halting aid to South Africa over a new law there intended to help address post-apartheid inequality in Black land ownership. The executive order suggested the legislation discriminates against white landowners. Trump also directed his administration to prioritize white South Africans’ resettlement in the U.S.\n\nTrump has also echoed South African-born Musk’s false claims that the South African government is targeting its white citizens — a claim that, like his own administration’s attacks on diversity initiatives in the U.S., is rooted in the presumption that any policy meant to create a more equitable playing field for nonwhite communities is by default an attack on white cultural and political power.\n\nRubio also skipped out on a G20 meeting in South Africa in February, saying the host country was using the summit to promote “DEI and climate change.”",

But this is a problem of Democrats’ own making: Their trepidation stems from their own history of repressing speech critical of Israel — and now we’re all at risk of paying the price for it.\n\nKhalil, an Algerian citizen of Palestinian descent, is a green-card holder who finished a master’s program at Columbia University in December (he is expected to graduate in the spring). He played a leading role in activism on Columbia’s campus last year objecting to Israel’s brutal treatment of Gaza, and served as a representative of student activists in negotiations with the university administration over a divestment campaign. A Columbia professor recently described him as a “consummate diplomat” who “seeks mediated resolutions through speech and dialogue.” He has an 8-month pregnant wife, who is a U.S. citizen.\n\nDemocratic leaders' response has been slow, divided and often feeble.\n\nThis legal permanent resident’s detention was made all the more disturbing by the way in which it was carried out. Khalil was detained in the lobby of his Columbia University-owned New York City apartment building on Saturday, with ICE agents changing their claims about his immigration status mid-arrest.\n\nAt first, the Trump administration provided no public legal explanation of its actions, even as it shipped Khalil to a detention facility in Louisiana. Green-card holders can be deported for certain crimes, but the government has not even charged Khalil with anything. Instead, the government is invoking an obscure provision of immigration law, which holds that an immigrant can be removed from the country if the U.S. secretary of state determines that their presence or activities are deemed to potentially have “serious adverse foreign policy consequences.” That’s why a Department of Homeland Security spokesperson has described Khalil as “aligned to Hamas.” But the administration has failed to provide any evidence or explanation for how this student activist is allegedly “aligned to Hamas” or poses a “serious” risk to U.S. foreign policy.\n\nInstead, the Trump administration is targeting him for his political speech and activism — and openly admitting that his arrest is meant to scare other pro-Palestinian activists. On Truth Social, Trump called Khalil a “Radical Foreign Pro-Hamas Student“ and warned that his arrest is the “first arrest of many to come.” He added: “We know there are more students at Columbia and other Universities across the Country who have engaged in pro-terrorist, anti-Semitic, anti-American activity, and the Trump Administration will not tolerate it.”\n\nMany civil liberties advocates, centrist and left-of-center observers recognize Khalil’s detention as an assault on free speech. Georgetown legal scholar Steve Vladeck said that the Trump administration’s actions constitute “unconstitutional retaliation for First Amendment-protected speech.” The organization Jewish Voice for Peace said Trump’s actions were “designed to sow terror among students and immigrant communities” and its protesters poured into Trump Tower in Manhattan chanting “Fight Nazis, not students.” Donna Lieberman, executive director of NYCLU, likened Khalil’s detention to “McCarthyism” and described it as a “targeted, retaliatory, and an extreme attack on his First Amendment rights.” Jameel Jaffer, executive director at the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University, described Trump’s move as “the kind of action one ordinarily associates with the world’s most repressive regimes.”\n\nSome Democrats have risen to the occasion. “We must be extremely clear: This is an attempt to criminalize political protest and is a direct assault on the freedom of speech of everyone in this country,” said a letter from 14 progressive House Democrats. Another letter, signed by over 100 House Democrats, said Khalil’s detention represents “the playbook of authoritarians, not of elected officials in a democratic society who claim to be the champions of free speech.”\n\nYet Democratic leaders’ response has been slow, divided and often feeble. New York Governor Kathy Hochul and New York City Mayor Eric Adams have refused to weigh in. And the statements of both House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer illustrate how caveats and hedging can undermine clear communication and standing for principles.\n\nBoth Jeffries and Schumer’s statements begin with caveats referencing how Khalil may have violated Columbia University’s rules and his behavior may warrant disciplinary action from the college regarding how he may have made Jewish students feel. But Khalil’s status at the university is irrelevant. At stake is his status in the United States. Bringing up Columbia’s disciplinary system allows Jeffries and Schumer to distance themselves from Khalil’s political cause. But the entire point of defending the First Amendment is to defend people’s rights to say things that are unpopular or even loathsome. (Note that nobody has provided evidence of how Khalil, who has denounced antisemitism, is antisemitic, and that Khalil’s lawyers say there is no evidence he supports Hamas.)\n\nBoth Jeffries’ and Schumer’s statements ask for the Trump administration to provide evidence of criminal activity in order to justify its actions. But that’s also a misfire: The Trump administration has made it crystal clear that this isn’t about criminal activity, but about political speech. A White House official even told The Free Press that “the allegation here is not that he was breaking the law.” Only after all the throat-clearing do the statements get around to saying that Trump’s actions appear to violate the Constitution in a measured tone.\n\nThe reason the mainstream of the Democratic leaders have been weak on this issue is because the party has been long opposed to the issue that Khalil represents — cutting off aid to Israel — and complicit in the free speech crisis themselves. President Joe Biden maintained almost uninterrupted military aid Israel, even as human rights observers and scholars described it as a genocide, and effectively aligned himself with draconian crackdowns on overwhelmingly peaceful pro-Palestinian student protests. And most House Democrats voted in favor of a bill conflating criticism of Israel with antisemitism. Moreover, across institutions with ostensibly liberal cultures — in media, book publishing, the film industry and elsewhere — voices critical of Israel have been stifled or even purged. Khalil’s detention may violate the First Amendment, but in the U.S. there remains a Palestine exception to free speech.\n\nIf Democrats are wagering that this can be contained to one green-card holder, they are naive. Already Trump has canceled hundreds of millions of dollars of federal funding to Columbia based on the pretext that it did not do enough to crack down on antisemitism. (This comes after Columbia expended immense resources to do so.) The message is clear: Trump wants to bully and intimidate as many institutions as possible to comply with its authoritarian assault on free speech. So far, Democratic leaders are not up for the fight.",

        "content": "Recent data from the University of Michigan shows consumer confidence in the economy has plummeted to its lowest level since 2022, as prices rise and stocks fall in response to Donald Trump’s unnecessary and rudderless trade war.\n\nThe stumbling stock market and all the understandable worries about it are not a liberal conspiracy theory. The Fox News universe has been trying to prepare Trump supporters for economic pain as a consequence of his policies. But rather than grapple with that reality, Team Trump is trying to confine the American public to a fantasyland of its own creation, baselessly blaming the tanking economy on former President Joe Biden.\n\nAnd, in at least one instance, suggesting the low consumer confidence is actually a fabrication of people with an axe to grind. Kevin Hassett, Trump’s director of the National Economic Council, faced some pushback on Fox News, of all places, after he downplayed host Martha MacCallum’s question about what evidence he could offer that consumer confidence was improving. Hassett said:\n\n“The thing that I care most about is the hard data. The consumer confidence numbers can sometimes fluctuate around elections, for example, because of people whose party lost or are really in a bad mood and they say, ‘Oh, things are just terrible. You know, the guy I didn’t vote for is gonna destroy the economy.’ But then, when it doesn’t happen, people get around. So I don’t actually put a lot of faith in the consumer confidence numbers right around election time.\n\nThe proposition that Trump’s policies might hurt the economy isn’t liberal propaganda. Last year, Elon Musk literally predicted his and Trump’s economic policies would crash the economy. MacCallum interrupted Hassett’s deflection to note that “we’re pretty far past the November election” and again asked Hassett for any evidence to suggest consumer sentiment was actually good.\n\nHassett declined to provide any, then went on to say he doesn’t believe the University of Michigan survey because “there are a lot of Michigan people doing the survey that I don’t necessarily think were doing anything other than making a partisan survey.”\n\nWatch the exchange here:\n\nIf the conservative Wall Street Journal is willing to cite the same University of Michigan survey, it’s pretty laughable to try to spin the survey as “partisan” and untrustworthy.\n\nHassett’s smokescreen — along with Trump’s recent social media outburst against the Journal’s reporting that Trump’s tariffs are destabilizing the economy — show how the administration is not coping well with the negative consequences (and growing unpopularity) of Trump’s haphazard and ham-fisted policymaking.",

        "title": "Chuck Schumer avoided a shutdown and made it harder to stop Trump",
        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "The Senate voted on Friday afternoon to move forward with a Republican short-term funding bill and avoid a federal government shutdown. Ten Democrats, including Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, voted in favor of cloture, limiting further debate and advancing the bill to final passage. The funding bill then passed in a 54-46 vote, with two Democrats joining all but one Republican senator in support.\n\nIt was the culmination of a wild week that brought to a head a divide among congressional Democrats over how best to counter President Donald Trump’s agenda. Moreover, it has left Schumer a far cry from his past as once one of the party’s more effective messengers. Now, the caucus he leads, thanks to his own missteps, appears too disjointed and out of sync to have a coherent message.\n\nNow, the caucus he leads, thanks to his own missteps, appears too disjointed and out of sync to have a coherent message.\n\nFor months now, Schumer has advocated for a posture of letting Republicans trip over themselves and reaping the rewards during the midterms. “Trump will screw up,” he told Semafor in early February, urging Democrats to remain patient. Even as it became clear that negotiations over the looming government funding deadline were faltering, Senate Democrats have been more focused on the fight over the GOP’s funding bill for the next fiscal year.\n\nHistory was on their side on that front, especially with the extremely narrow GOP majority in the House. The odds of Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., managing to corral his fractious caucus without support from Democrats to get a funding bill over the line seemed slim. But then the unthinkable happened: the House GOP banded together without any of its usual drama.\n\nThe continuing resolution the House approved on Tuesday slashes funding for nondefense spending over the next six months but does so stealthily enough that swing-district Republicans could support it. More significantly, the normally anti-CR House Freedom Caucus jumped on board after Trump and Vice President JD Vance promised that the White House would simply cut whatever spending the resolution authorized that they didn’t like. That alone should have been enough to make clear to congressional Democrats that the language they were demanding to curtail Trump’s illegal impoundment should be required for any support in passing the bill.\n\nHouse Democrats were a bit all over the place in their reasoning for opposing the bill, citing the reduced short-term funding, the longer-term risk to Social Security and other entitlements, and calling it as a free pass to let the Department of Government Efficiency continue its illegal downsizing of the government. But despite differing motives, House Minority Leader Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., made sure his caucus agreed on the results. All but one House Democrat voted against the bill. Given lawmakers’ — and especially Democrats’ — temptation to avoid blame for a shutdown, this was a major feat for Jeffries and his team.\n\nBut even as House Democrats stuck together, it quickly became clear how unprepared Senate Democrats were for this moment. According to NBC News, “Schumer didn’t initiate a full caucus conversation about how to handle the House measure until Democrats met for lunch on Tuesday,” after the House bill had already passed. Two days of closed-door discussions did not lead to consensus among members on how to avoid a shutdown without appearing to capitulate to Trump.\n\nThe resulting messaging from Senate Democrats was a mess. On Wednesday afternoon, Schumer announced that there weren’t Democratic votes for the GOP bill and that the caucus was unified on a 30-day funding bill to allow for more negotiations. But getting that alternative to the floor would have required offering it as an amendment, which would have required at least eight Democrats to vote for cloture anyway. It would only be then that Democrats could offer up their plan as amendment — which was guaranteed to fail, given that Republicans control 53 seats. (It and two other amendments, as predicted, failed to pass on Friday afternoon.)\n\nThe strategy seemed like an attempt to use the arcane procedures of the Senate to hoodwink Democratic voters into thinking the caucus had done everything in its power to stop the resolution. That feeling was justified the next day when Schumer turned around to say that he would vote in favor of advancing the bill rather than allowing a shutdown. \"I believe allowing Donald Trump to take even much more power via a government shutdown is a far worse option,” he said in a floor speech. “I will vote to keep the government open and not shut it down.”\n\nModerate and progressive Democrats alike have either denounced or disregarded Schumer’s argument.\n\nIt’s not that Schumer’s reasoning was entirely misguided. As one senator reportedly yelled at their colleagues this week, the Trump administration might use a shutdown to declare a national emergency. It could also be used to justify Elon Musk and the Department of Government Efficiency firing “nonessential” personnel. And shutdowns are generally bad politically for the party that’s seen as at fault. But for a party that has struggled to figure out where to draw the line against Trump, it came across as a prime example of giving up without a fight.\n\nTo say that House Democrats were angry at Schumer’s capitulation is an understatement. Their fury was compounded because, according to NBC News, Jeffries’ team had let Schumer know about their plan to unify against the bill and force the GOP back to the table — a plan that could only work if Senate Democrats held strong as well. “I think there is a deep sense of outrage and betrayal, and this is not just progressive Democrats — this is across the board, the entire party,” Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., told reporters on Thursday night.\n\nThis sort of dispute is exceedingly rare for congressional Democrats. What makes this divide even more unusual is that it isn’t based on ideology. Moderate and progressive Democrats alike have either denounced or disregarded Schumer’s argument. Nor can the split be primarily viewed as a battle between the old guard and upstarts, as The New York Times framed the anger at Schumer. Former Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., who was Schumer’s partner in countering the first Trump administration, lent her voice to the chorus denouncing his decision. And when asked about the Senate leadership’s performance this week, Jeffries responded with a distinct lack of support for Schumer: “Next question.”\n\nThere’s a distinct irony here given how much of Schumer’s rise was fueled by his reputation as being a media whiz. After his predecessor, Sen. Harry Reid of Nevada, announced his retirement in 2015, Schumer was immediately tapped to take the reins. As Politico wrote at the time: “After two cycles running the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee and after he’s taken the reins as the messaging guru, Schumer is viewed by many of his colleagues as being one of his party’s savviest political tacticians.” Now that reputation seems ill-deserved given the heartache and lack of clarity along the way from him.\n\nIn this case, Schumer got what he wanted and managed to bring enough of his members with him to avoid a shutdown. But in the process, he’s alienated the House and accelerated the growing conversation about the need for sitting senators to face primary challengers. Whether he leads the Senate Democratic caucus after the midterms is now in doubt. And in refusing to use every tool in his power to stop Trump’s violation of the Constitution, Schumer has left an already demoralized Democratic base wondering when, if ever, the party’s leaders are going to act like their campaign trail warnings about the threat Trump poses to the country will be reflected in their actions.",

        "content": "Welcome back, Deadline: Legal Newsletter readers. When we left off last week, the Trump Justice Department was making its final plea to dismiss Eric Adams’ criminal case without prejudice — meaning, the Republican administration was still pushing for the option to revive the Democrat’s corruption indictment in the future (hence the quid pro quo allegations, which both sides have denied). Heading into this weekend, we’re awaiting U.S. District Judge Dale Ho’s ruling on the matter, which could come anytime.\n\nThe Trump DOJ pushed the president’s version of “law and order” on other dockets. In doing so, the government continued its abnormal streak of top officials appearing at hearings to advance Donald Trump’s goals. Last month, it was Emil Bove's New York appearance at the Adams hearing. This week, Attorney General Pam Bondi's chief of staff, Chad Mizelle, was in a Washington, D.C., courtroom defending Trump’s executive order that sought to take various actions against law firm Perkins Coie for its Democratic-aligned work.\n\n“It sends little chills down my spine,” U.S. District Judge Beryl Howell said of Trump’s directive, against which she issued a temporary restraining order. “This may be amusing in ‘Alice in Wonderland’ where the Queen of Hearts yells, ‘Off with their heads!’ at annoying subjects and announces a sentence before a verdict,” the Obama appointee said. “But this cannot be the reality we are living under.”\n\nHowell wasn’t the only district judge disturbed by the government’s behavior this week. U.S. District Judge William Alsup called it “a sad day when our government would fire some good employee, and say it was based on performance, when they know good and well, that’s a lie.” Ordering several federal departments to rehire employees, the Clinton appointee in California said the government tried to frustrate his “ability to get at the truth of what happened here.” Alsup’s preliminary ruling was one of two big ones against Trump’s mass firings, with another from Obama appointee James Bredar in Maryland.\n\nPardons made news on several fronts — including, somehow, in a Mel Gibson-related situation. DOJ pardon attorney Liz Oyer, a Biden appointee, said she was fired after refusing to help restore the Trump-allied actor’s gun rights, which he lost after his 2011 domestic violence conviction. Separately, Trump pardoned Brian Kelsey, a Republican former lawmaker from Tennessee, who was two weeks into a 21-month campaign finance fraud sentence. Decrying the “weaponized Biden DOJ” that prosecuted him, Kelsey reportedly said his clemency request likely resonated with the president, whom he called “victim No. 1” of political persecution.\n\nAnd how far does Trump’s blanket Jan. 6 pardon go? We got new answers to that open question, which has been raised by defendants testing the extent to which the clemency covers actions beyond that day at the Capitol in 2021. In one case, U.S. District Judge Thomas Varlan in Tennessee said Trump’s pardon doesn’t cover Edward Kelley’s 2022 plot to kill federal agents who investigated him. In another case — in which the DOJ sided with the defendant after initially opposing him — Trump appointee Dabney Friedrich said the pardon didn’t cover Dan Wilson’s Kentucky firearms conviction.\n\n“President Trump alone has the constitutional authority to pardon Wilson for all of his crimes,” Friedrich wrote. “He still may do so. But this Court cannot — it is duty bound to enforce the Presidential Pardon as written.”\n\nWill Trump redeploy his pardon Sharpie to clean up any unfinished Jan. 6 business? If the Trump DOJ thought the pardon should apply to Wilson, then the defendant and anyone else in similar situations might have some reason to hope. But judges unwilling to do that work for them means they’re at the president’s mercy once again.\n\nHave any questions or comments for me? I’d love to hear from you!

Calling himself the “chief law enforcement officer” (a title usually reserved for the U.S. attorney general), Trump careened across a range of topics, from Ukraine to the price of eggs, crowed about his “mandate” in the 2024 election and vowed to “bring back faith” in a justice system that he has dramatically politicized since returning to office.\n\n“First, we must be honest about the lies and the abuses that have occurred within these walls,” Trump told the crowd. “Unfortunately in recent years, a corrupt group of hacks and radicals within the ranks of the American government obliterated the trust and goodwill built up over generations. They weaponized the vast powers of our intelligence and law enforcement agencies to try and thwart the will of the American people.”\n\nTrump also mentioned by name attorneys who he claimed “did everything within their power to prevent me from becoming the president of the United States” and repeated his baseless claim that his political foes had weaponized federal law enforcement against him — even as he delivered a highly politicized speech to a department that has traditionally strived to preserve its independence from the executive branch.",

        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "President Donald Trump’s flurry of executive orders seems destined for a showdown at the Supreme Court. Members of Trump’s administration — including Vice President JD Vance and tech billionaire Elon Musk — are already raising the possibility of defying the court should it rule against the administration. This raises the stakes for the court: a ruling against Trump risks the executive branch’s defiance, which could damage the court’s legitimacy.\n\nWill Trump comply with its rulings? What will be the consequences of defiance? These are questions not only of law, but also of politics.\n\nThere are many historical examples that shed light on what the political fallout might look like, but perhaps the best comes from the final months of Richard Nixon’s presidency, in 1974.\n\nForced into a corner, Nixon complied with the court’s ruling.\n\nNixon had secretly taped conversations in the Oval Office, with some of the recordings containing evidence about the Watergate cover-up. In April 1974, special prosecutor Leon Jaworski subpoenaed the recordings as part of his investigation. In U.S. v. Nixon, the Supreme Court ordered Nixon to hand over the tapes.\n\nThe court’s opinion, written by Nixon-appointed Chief Justice Warren Burger, left the president with two options. He could comply with the court and deal with the fallout. Or he could defy it and send the country into a constitutional crisis — something he apparently did privately consider.\n\nThe political context is important. By the time of the Supreme Court’s ruling, Nixon’s political capital had collapsed. His approval rating hovered around 24%, and his fellow Republicans in Congress had abandoned him. Everyone — including the justices — knew that ignoring the court would probably result in Nixon’s impeachment and removal.\n\nThis put the court in a strong position politically, and Nixon in a weak one. Forced into a corner, Nixon complied with the court’s ruling. He reluctantly handed over the tapes and resigned two weeks later.\n\nNixon’s story makes clear that, in a possible confrontation between a president and the Supreme Court, public approval and congressional support are enormously important. Nixon had neither: everyone knew that defying the court would likely have led to impeachment and removal. Trump, on the other hand, retains strong support from Republican voters, even as his overall favorability has declined since assuming office. While Nixon’s co-partisans on Capitol Hill hung him out to dry, Trump’s are standing behind him. Congressional Republicans have bent the knee time and time again, seemingly allowing his administration to exercise even those powers, such as the power to appropriate funds, that the Constitution grants to the legislature.\n\nUnlike Nixon, Trump will not face the threat of congressional impeachment and removal if he defies the court. Barring an extraordinary political event — such as an unprecedented rout in the 2026 midterms — that will remain the case for the rest of his term. That reality could embolden him.\n\nIf public consensus remains firm, a blatant defiance of the Supreme Court could be politically perilous for Trump.\n\nBut there is a second important issue: people’s expectations. Not only did Nixon have abysmal public support, but roughly half of Americans wanted him to leave office entirely. Fast-forward to today, Trump himself is not unpopular, but many of his policies are not particularly well liked. Ending birthright citizenship, abolishing executive agencies and expansions of presidential power have proved unpopular. And large shares believe that Trump is overstepping his presidential authority. Would enough of the Supreme Court’s swing votes, such as Chief Justice John Roberts, stick their necks out to save policies that Americans dislike?\n\nMost important is the fact that Americans firmly believe that presidents must obey Supreme Court rulings — for example, a recent poll showed that 83% of Americans (including 77% of Republicans) believe this. That is a striking level of bipartisan public consensus in a deeply polarized era. People want the president to comply with rulings, and they fully expect him to do so.\n\nIf public consensus remains firm, a blatant defiance of the Supreme Court could be politically perilous for Trump. This expectation may also influence the court itself, making it feel more emboldened to rule without fear of being ignored.\n\nHistory doesn’t repeat itself, but it does offer guidance. Nixon was a politically weak president pushing unpopular views; he could not realistically survive a conflict with the court given the credible threat of impeachment from Congress. As for Trump, even though his policies are not popular, Congress is currently no check on his power. This all suggests that if Trump defied the court, he would probably survive in the sense that he would not be impeached. But it could be a pyrrhic victory: he could emerge severely politically damaged, perhaps cripplingly so.\n\nThe deeper worry is this: Trump has tested the boundaries of executive power like few presidents before him. Even if defying the Supreme Court carries significant political costs, those costs may be relatively meaningless — especially if the standoff involves elections or an expansion of his own authority. Political damage after the fact would mean little if defying the court works to secure more presidential power at the expense of democratic norms. And in the end, the most significant check would be a credible threat of congressional impeachment and removal — something that was historically present, but for now remains absent.",

        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "A recent audit found that Medicare may have made up to $454 million in improper payments to providers for 38.7 million Covid tests.\n\nIn another case, a multiagency investigation found that a former U.S. Air Force employee and the owners of government contracting firms conspired in a bribery scheme that spanned more than a decade and involved more than $400 million in government contracts. The investigation led to six criminal convictions, more than $88 million recovered for the government and more than 34 years of jail time for the defendants.\n\nIG oversight has collectively resulted in potential savings of about $93.1 billion in FY 2023.\n\nA 2023 report revealed that the Small Business Administration had decided to stop collecting on certain delinquent loans — totaling roughly $62 billion. After the report was issued and congressional Republicans “blasted the [Biden] administration for its leniency,” the SBA reversed course and announced plans to pursue those deadbeat loans aggressively, and could recover as much as $30 billion for American taxpayers.\n\nThe reports mentioned above represent just a handful of the times inspectors general, the independent watchdogs inside the various agencies of the federal government, have either called out fraud or waste or saved the American people money. IGs have also improved the federal government’s performance on a wide variety of critical issues, from combating violent gangs to preventing veterans' suicides, from uncovering cyberfraud to fighting cyberstalking, from overseeing U.S. aid to Ukraine to evaluating the evacuation from Afghanistan, from exposing border corruption to analyzing bank failures.\n\nThat’s why President Donald Trump’s decision to fire 18 inspectors general in the first week of his term is so puzzling. According to the Council of the Inspectors General on Integrity and Efficiency, IG oversight has collectively resulted in potential savings of about $93.1 billion in FY 2023. With the OIG community’s aggregate FY 2023 budget of approximately $3.5 billion, these potential savings represent an approximate $26 return on every dollar invested in inspectors general.\n\nIGs should be a natural ally in the president’s effort to make the government more efficient; “Efficiency” is literally in our name. IGs ultimately share a mission with the rest of the executive branch, which is to improve the federal government for the American people. And the IGs’ track record makes clear that IG oversight is a good investment for the American taxpayer.\n\nEven if it’s true, as some have argued that the White House fired me along with my IG colleagues because the president does not want independent oversight into the executive branch, here’s why President Trump should want independence for his inspectors general.\n\nIf IGs are not independent — if they can’t make findings of waste, fraud, abuse or misconduct about government programs, without fear of being fired, disciplined or reprimanded and can’t be objective in their assessments of government programs — then their oversight will be worthless.\n\nThe programs that President Trump cares about most are precisely the ones in which he should want the straight scoop.\n\nTo use a business analogy, President Trump would likely avoid investing in a company whose auditors were hopelessly conflicted, and he wouldn’t trust the financial audit of the company’s balance sheet or cash flow statement if the auditor would have gotten fired for anything other than a clean opinion. Surely, he wouldn’t trust a bond rating if the rating officials would have been fired or reprimanded for anything other than a AAA rating.\n\nSimilarly, who would believe any findings of any office of inspector general if IGs can be removed for any negative findings? The programs that President Trump cares about most are precisely the ones in which he should want the straight scoop.\n\nThis is not a hypothetical. In 2022, when I was inspector general of the U.S. Interior Department, my office found that the department’s Bureau of Land Management, which administers oil and gas leasing programs on federal land, was failing to conduct a necessary step to prevent waste, fraud and abuse in the leasing program. BLM was awarding leases for the mineral extraction, including oil and gas, without confirming whether the entities and individuals were prohibited from doing business with the federal government. After our report, BLM began immediately checking the list of prohibited entities before issuing those leases. That is a great example of government oversight at its best.\n\nHere’s the catch: I don’t know that such a report could be issued today. There’s reason to believe that a negative report on a sensitive program, regardless of how true it is or how helpful it is to the American taxpayer, would be viewed as disloyal and cause for termination.\n\nThe chilling effect on IGs seems already to be occurring. Paul Martin, who served as inspector general of the U.S. Agency for International Development was fired last month, the day after releasing a report that cautioned that the Trump administration’s freeze on foreign aid, as well as its efforts to cut USAID’s staffing, made it harder to ensure billions in U.S. funding were being spent properly. Roughly two weeks later, The Washington Post reported that his successor, the acting IG at USAID, had been accused of holding “two critical reports on the consequences of President Donald Trump’s funding freeze on crucial services in Africa and the Middle East, amid fears of retaliation from the White House.”\n\nThat is the polar opposite of what President Trump should want. He should want to know if there are problems in the federal government, so he can fix them for the American people. IG reports are a tremendous tool to do just that, but only if the IGs are empowered to call it like they see it, without the proverbial sword of Damocles hanging over their heads.\n\nPresident Trump is famously adamant about loyalty. Well, it’s not loyal to bury bad news. To the contrary, allowing decision-makers to waltz down the primrose path, unwittingly blind to the realities on the ground, is the ultimate in disloyalty. Sharing the truth, even if it is not what the principal wants, is the ultimate show of loyalty.",

        "content": "“Can they do that?”\n\nIt’s a frequently asked question in the early days of Donald Trump’s second term.\n\nOne of the latest actions spurring that question is the Department of Education's decision to cut about half its staff under the leadership of former wrestling executive Linda McMahon. The answer is “no,” according to a new lawsuit filed by Democratic-led states, including New York Attorney General Letitia James.\n\nThe Trump administration “cannot dismantle the Department of Education,” the legal complaint filed Thursday in Massachusetts federal court reads. “It cannot override — whether through large-scale RIFs [Reduction in Force] or otherwise — the statutory framework prescribing the Department’s responsibilities.”\n\nThe states’ suit invokes the separation of powers, arguing that the executive is encroaching legislative authority and not “tak[ing] care” that the law be faithfully executed as constitutionally required. Noting that Congress created the department, the complaint said the executive and his agencies “cannot incapacitate it, absent Congressional action that directs them to do so.”\n\nThe states also said the department’s “mass RIF” is “arbitrary and capricious” because the government “provided no reasoned basis or explanation” for it. “The Department’s stated reasons for the RIF — to promote ‘efficiency’ and ‘accountability’ — are pretext for the President and Secretary McMahon’s stated goal of dismantling the Department from within,” the complaint alleged.\n\nIt recalled past attempts to eliminate the department, such as Republican Ronald Reagan’s bid to do so with legislation in the 1980s. But Congress didn’t pass that legislation, thus reflecting “the uncontroversial understanding that only Congress may abolish an agency it created,” the complaint said.\n\nAnd what’s the connection to the states? They wrote that they rely on the department “for an extraordinary array of programs,” citing funds for low-income children and students with disabilities, anti-discrimination enforcement and student aid.\n\nThe federal government will get a chance to respond in court, and a judge will make an initial determination of whether this suit will join others that have blocked some of the administration’s actions so far.\n\nSubscribe to the Deadline: Legal Newsletter for expert analysis on the top legal stories of the week, including updates from the Supreme Court and developments in the Trump administration’s legal cases.",

        "title": "Why Trump businesses’ lawsuit against Capital One bank is so ridiculous",
        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "Earlier this month, a collection of people and entities affiliated with President Donald Trump — specifically, the Donald J. Trump Revocable Trust, DJT Holdings LLC, DJT Holdings Managing Member LLC, DTTM Operations LLC and Eric Trump — sued Capital One bank for having “unjustifiably” closed numerous Trump-associated bank accounts in the aftermath of the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection at the U.S. Capitol.\n\nThe lawsuit pleads that “de-banking” — closing depositors’ bank accounts — was originally meant to stop fraudsters from having access to banking facilities but it morphed into a way to punish depositors for their political beliefs. The lawsuit explains that completely legal gun and ammunition dealers or payday lenders often found themselves de-banked by unelected bureaucrats who disagreed with the businesses’ political beliefs. The plaintiffs claim to have been damaged by this type of de-banking when Capital One closed Trump accounts because of the Trumps’ “political views.” The Trumps seek damages under an assortment of state consumer protection laws.\n\nJust how many ways is this lawsuit silly? Let me count them.\n\nAs a purely legal matter, the Trumps don’t appear to have suffered any recoverable money damages. According to the lawsuit, Capital One closed the Trump bank accounts. Presumably, the bank returned the Trumps’ money to them — the lawsuit doesn’t say otherwise, and it’s inconceivable the bank would have stolen the Trumps’ money. (A representative for Capital One declined to comment for this article.)\n\nIt’s true that individual depositors with small accounts — such as gun shops — might have trouble setting up new banking relationships after they were “de-banked,” but a large real estate business, such as the Trump Organization, would have had no trouble on that score. So while we don’t know for certain, the Trumps’ situation was presumably this: Capital One closed the Trumps’ bank accounts, Capital One returned the Trumps’ money, the Trumps promptly found a new bank, and the Trumps, uninjured, went on with their business.\n\nA fundamental element of any lawsuit is that a plaintiff must have suffered damages. Here, except perhaps for the inconvenience of changing bankers, the Trumps suffered none.\n\nWhere’s the case?\n\nBut that’s just the legal flaw in this lawsuit. Think for a moment about the practical flaws.\n\nJust how many ways is this lawsuit silly? Let me count them.\n\nIs any jury going to believe that Capital One stopped its banking relationship in the months after Jan. 6 because of Donald Trump’s political beliefs? Did the bank really think, “Donald Trump doesn’t like affirmative action and he opposes DEI, so we should close his accounts”?\n\nOr is it far more likely — and in fact almost certainly true, and sure to be believed by a jury in a heartbeat — that Capital One closed the Trumps’ bank accounts because it didn’t care to be associated with a person who appeared to have incited an insurrection and then stood by silently for three hours as rioters ransacked the Capitol?\n\nJust about everyone in America — all Democrats, and even some Republicans — knew that Trump was “practically and morally responsible for provoking the events” of Jan. 6, as then-GOP Senate leader Mitch McConnell put it at the time.\n\nThis wasn’t a matter of politics; it was a matter of morality.\n\nCapital One didn’t close the Trumps’ bank accounts because of Trump’s political views. Capital One has denied that it closed the bank accounts for political reasons, but it wouldn’t be unreasonable to surmise that the bank didn’t care to be associated with anyone — Democratic, Republican or independent — who tried to interfere with the counting of votes in a presidential election. Handling financial transactions for Trump both would have been immoral and would have posed a reputational risk for the bank. Ending that relationship wasn’t improper; it was sane.\n\nAlthough many Americans seem to have forgiven Trump’s gross misconduct over the four years since the Jan. 6 riot, that misconduct could fully justify Capital One’s closing of the bank accounts.\n\nBut the practical flaws in the Trumps’ lawsuit don’t stop there.\n\nIn any lawsuit, the parties are permitted to take discovery — gather information — from each other. Capital One will thus have the right to request documents and take testimony from Donald Trump and others about Trump’s conduct on Jan. 6. As the House Jan. 6 committee proceedings made clear, there is nothing about Trump’s conduct in early January 2021 that is praiseworthy; there is much that should be condemned. Does Trump really want to relive, and again place in the public eye, the events of one of the most notorious days in his life?\n\nThere are many reasons for the Trumps to abandon this lawsuit. There is only one reason for them to pursue it: to get a financial settlement.\n\nThere’s no legal reason for Capital One to settle the Trumps’ newest lawsuit. The lawsuit is both defensible and embarrassing for Trump to pursue. But there are surely practical reasons — avoiding the wrath the federal government could inflict on a bank — for Capital One to cough up some dough to make this go away.\n\nIs that justice? Not by a long shot.\n\nBut does it appear to be a recurring way for Trump to profit while he has the government on his side? Bank on it.",

        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "While Donald Trump’s imperialistic vision was front-page news last month, the president’s territorial ambitions gradually moved to the backburner as other controversies surrounding his agenda moved to the fore. Thursday, the story came roaring back.\n\nNBC News reported, for example, that the White House has directed the Pentagon to “draw up options to increase the American troop presence in Panama” to achieve the president’s goal of “reclaiming” the Panama Canal. The report added, “U.S. Southern Command is developing potential plans from partnering more closely with Panamanian security forces to the less likely option of U.S. troops’ seizing the Panama Canal by force, the officials said. Whether military force is used, the officials added, depends on how much Panamanian security forces agree to partner with the United States.”\n\nThe news was not well received in Panama City, where officials issued a statement emphasizing that “our sovereignty over the Panama Canal is absolute and not the basis of any negotiation.”\n\nAround the same time that report was reaching the public, Trump had some related remarks about Greenland. NBC News reported on the comments, made during an Oval Office event alongside NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte.\n\nTrump said in remarks in the Oval Office during his meeting with the NATO secretary general that he thinks the United States will succeed in his quest to take control of Greenland. “I think it’ll happen,” Trump said when he was asked what his vision is for the potential annexation of the country.\n\nAs part of the same set of comments, the American president also suggested that he might deploy additional U.S. troops to Greenland.\n\nAs for officials in Denmark — a country Trump also slighted during the Oval Office event — Rasmus Jarlov, the chairman of the defense committee in Denmark’s parliament, said in a statement, “It would mean war between two NATO countries. Greenland has just voted against immediate independence from Denmark and does not want to be American ever.”\n\nIn case that weren’t quite enough, Trump — again, at the same Oval Office gathering — also made fresh comments about annexing the nation of Canada, adding, “Canada only works as a state.” He went on to say that adding Canada to the United States would make the country “visually” impressive.\n\nIt was against this backdrop that The Wall Street Journal reported that Trump recently contacted House Speaker Mike Johnson to request that Congress send over a painting of James Polk, the nation’s 11th president, to be displayed at the White House.\n\nAnd why, pray tell, would the president want a Polk portrait? Because, as the Journal’s article noted, he “oversaw the largest expansion of U.S. territory in history.” (Don’t laugh, but I continue to think Team Trump’s interest in wall décor is an angle worth watching in the second term.)\n\nSo, let’s take stock. The White House has directed the Pentagon to draw up options to increase the American troop presence in Panama. Trump now expects to annex Greenland and has talked about the possibility of deploying troops to the island. The president still wants to annex Canada. He’s also talked at length about taking over the Gaza Strip.\n\nAnd did I mention that Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth recently raised the prospect of unilateral military strikes in Mexico? Because that reportedly happened, too.\n\nTo the extent that the White House cares about public attitudes, the latest Reuters/Ipsos poll found that 60% of Americans oppose taking control of the Panama Canal, 68% oppose territorial U.S. expansion, 69% oppose annexing Greenland, 80% oppose making Canada a state, and 84% oppose Trump’s Gaza plan. (Click the link for more information on the poll’s methodology and margin of error.\n\nOr put another way, Americans have seen and heard the president’s imperialistic vision — and most of the country just isn’t buying it.\n\nTo reiterate a point from last month, if you voted for Trump because you expected foreign policy restraint, I have some awful news for you.",

        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "Democrats seem to have been outplayed by Republicans when it comes to managing the latest government shutdown battle. And perhaps their biggest mistake was underestimating House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La. By a 54-46 vote on Friday night, the Senate approved the funding bill to keep the government open that the Republican-controlled House had passed on Tuesday.\n\nAs bad as passing the continuing resolution would be, I believe a government shutdown is far worse. Senate minority leader chuck schumer\n\nThis shutdown cycle was not without drama. On Thursday, the evening before the deadline, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer reversed the position he’d taken earlier in the week and vowed to help pass the House’s short-term continuing resolution bill. This must have been a tough call for the New York Democrat. As Schumer wrote in an op-ed for The New York Times, “As bad as passing the continuing resolution would be, I believe a government shutdown is far worse.”\n\nAnd while Schumer did not ultimately vote yes on the bill itself, his advocacy and yes vote on the cloture motion likely secured Friday night’s outcome.\n\nOn Friday morning at least, the Democrats were torn into two camps: fight Trump tooth and nail, which would lead to a shutdown and the potential chaos and pain that would bring, or swallow a partisan CR and at least keep the lights on. There were also specific fears that a shutdown would allow President Donald Trump and Elon Musk to accelerate some of their most aggressive agenda items, including mass federal layoffs and governmental reorganizing. “Musk has already said he wants a shutdown, and public reporting has shown he is already making plans to expedite his destruction of key government programs and services,” said Schumer from the Senate floor on Thursday.\n\nSchumer calculated ultimately the Democrats would be blamed for the impact on “the most vulnerable Americans, those who rely on federal programs to feed their families, get medical care and stay financially afloat. Communities that depend on government services to function will suffer.”\n\nHowever, in many ways, the die had already been cast. On Tuesday night, Johnson passed the spending bill with nearly unanimous GOP support. And then promptly sent his members home.\n\nThe speaker certainly had some help from both the president and White House officials. Trump himself was working the phones, while Vice President JD Vance reportedly “assured Republican members that Trump would continue cutting federal funding with his Department of Government Efficiency initiative and pursue impoundment — that is, holding back money appropriated by Congress.”\n\nJohnson is often thought of as the accidental speaker. And it’s true that he was pulled out of quasi-obscurity after the caucus took down his predecessor Kevin McCarthy just 17 months ago. At the time of his elevation, Johnson had no leadership experience, and the political class had very low expectations. But he had Trump in his corner.\n\n(Trump did blow up a bill in December carefully negotiated by Johnson and House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries. But Johnson eventually prevailed, with Democratic votes, and a spending bill was passed.)\n\nLast December's funding bill was always a temporary stopgap measure that would only fund the federal government through March 13, 2025. More surprising was that Johnson was able to get the House to pass its budget outline last month, with only losing a single vote. This should have served as a canary in the coal mine moment for Democrats.\n\nThe real blunder Schumer made was miscalculating just how good Johnson has become at playing political hardball. The thought of Johnson passing a six-month continuing resolution with just Republican votes seemed highly unlikely last year, and that was what both Jeffries and Schumer were counting on. They were operating on the premise that, just like with the last CR, Republicans were going to need Democratic votes to get the bill to the president’s desk, leaving room for negotiations.\n\nJohnson defied the odds and passed the CR, losing just one Republican vote, and picking up an extra yes vote from Maine Democrat Jared Golden. That left Schumer floundering, and with only one option to keep the government open.\n\nThere is a lesson to be learned here, and now would be a good time for Democratic leadership — as well as Senate Majority Leader John Thune — to recognize Johnson’s skills. They don’t have to like him or agree with him, but going forward they should respect him, and maybe even fear him.",

        "source": "https://www.nbcnews.com/",
        "content": "President Donald Trump’s suspended tariffs on many goods from Canada and Mexico are set to take hold April 2, with more import taxes on other products and countries coming soon. That means consumers may start to see price hikes at the grocery store within weeks, especially for some of the least shelf-stable items.\n\nImports make up an increasing share of the fresh produce sold in the United States — around 60% of fruits and 40% of vegetables, according to 2023 data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Trump has hit China with 20% higher tariffs than those already in force. That country, Mexico and Canada together produce over 75% of American vegetable imports.\n\nThe levies are likely to hit several staples in shoppers’ grocery carts, an NBC News analysis of U.S. Census Bureau data found, from berries to avocados to potatoes. The most affected items will be those that are largely sourced from Mexico, Canada or China.\n\nFor instance, the U.S. imports 100% of its fresh mangoes and limes, USDA data shows. Mexico supplies about 60% of the guavas and mangoes sold in the U.S. and about 72% of lemons and limes. The U.S. also imports high levels of avocados (91.9% are imported) and raspberries (91.4% are imported), and over 90% of both products’ imported stocks come from Mexico.\n\nItems like frozen fish filets from China and lobster and pork from Canada could also be heavily impacted, census data shows.\n\nSome larger grocery chains may be able to absorb costs or reconfigure their supply chains, said Jenny Zegler, the director of food and drink at market research firm Mintel, but smaller ones may struggle. She identified protein, produce and dairy from China, Canada and Mexico as categories that will likely become more expensive.\n\nZegler pointed out that even well-off consumers have been getting more creative with their grocery shopping to handle inflation, including before Trump returned to office. Many are opting for cheaper retailers like Aldi or Walmart, and spreading out their shopping between their usual grocery store, discount options and online delivery services, she said.\n\nA Mintel report last year found 26% of U.S. grocery shoppers had recently switched their primary grocer, with 54% of adults making compromises in their food and beverage choices due to higher costs. Tariffs would pile on more.\n\n“It’s another price pressure at a point that is essential for consumers,” Zegler said. “We can cut back on our groceries, but we can’t not buy them.”\n\nConsumers looking to get around tariffs can sometimes consider alternative products — like canned fruit instead of fresh fruit, Zegler said. She also recommended checking out local options at farmers markets, where prices for some items may become increasingly competitive with imported ones’, and exploring generic brands. She also said some households could opt to cut back on certain ingredients altogether if prices spike and stay elevated.\n\n“We do have a resilience as a consumer base, and so maybe it’s just paying a little bit more attention,” she said. “Being willing to change those formats or those suppliers, maybe you discover something new.”",

She also said it's unknown which chick died because they were all close in size.\n\nJackie and Shadow continued to feed their young on Saturday, Voisard said.\n\n\"Days like these test us as humans because we fear uncertainty and the unknown,\" Voisard said. \"Our hope is that seeing Jackie and Shadow persevere and work to move forward, brings some comfort and peace.

She was last seen around 4:15 a.m. March 6 after going to the beach with friends.\n\nThe man, who officials in Konanki's home state of Virginia called a \"person of interest,\" told local investigators that he and Konanki were on the beach \"in waist-deep water, talking and kissing a little,\" according to a transcript of an interview he gave local authorities that NBC News obtained.\n\nThat's when a wave crashed and swept them both \"out to sea,\" the man said in the March 12 interview.\n\n\"I kept trying to get her to breathe, but that didn’t allow me to breathe all the time, and I swallowed a lot of water,\" he said.\n\nInvestigators have not described the man as a suspect.\n\nPersonnel from various institutions conduct a search effort in the coastal area of Bávaro, Dominican Republic, where Sudiksha Konanki has gone missing. Defensa Civil La Altagracia\n\nThe man told investigators he previously worked as a lifeguard and got himself and Konanki back to shore before she went missing.\n\n\"The last time I saw her, I asked if she was OK. I didn’t hear her answer,\" he said. \"I looked around and didn’t see anyone. I thought she’d grabbed her things and left.\"\n\nHe told Dominican authorities that he was surprised to later learn Konanki was missing.\n\nKonanki, from the Washington, D.C., suburb of Chantilly, Virginia, is a biology student at Pitt, and her disappearance has drawn the interest of authorities back home.\n\nThe Loudoun County Sheriff’s Office, where Konanki’s family resides, has no jurisdiction over the case but has sent detectives to Punta Cana to assist with the U.S. side of the investigation, and has described the man interviewed as a \"person of interest.\"\n\nDominican authorities said Thursday they do not use the term “person of interest” in the case, and no one is considered a suspect at this point. U.S. authorities say this is a missing person’s case and not a criminal matter.\n\nA Loudoun County sheriff's spokesperson told NBC News on Friday the department investigators spoke to the man — Joshua Riibe — on Thursday, the day after local authorities interviewed him.\n\nRiibe's father and attorney accompanied him during the \"extensive interview\" and the man was \"cooperative,\" officials said.\n\nIn a statement Friday, Riibe's parents, Tina and Albert Riibe, expressed their \"deep sorrow and solidarity\" with Konanki's family.\n\n\"Above all, we wish to contribute to the search efforts and understand the anguish and uncertainty they are going through and we share the hope that Sudiksha will be found as soon as possible,\" they said in the statement.\n\nJoshua Riibe, a 22-year-old native of Rock Rapids, Iowa, is a senior at St. Cloud State University in Minnesota, studying land survey and mapping sciences.\n\nEven through he's not a suspect, he's being confined to his hotel room, according to the Riibe family.\n\n\"We recognize that this is a complex and painful situation for all parties involved, and we trust that the investigation will be conducted with transparency and justice,\" Tina and Albert Riibe said. \"Our only interest is that due process be respected and that actions be taken with the fairness that the situation requires.\"",

        "content": "A federal judge on Saturday blocked the Trump administration from using an 18th century law known as the Alien Enemies Act to deport five Venezuelans, kicking off a blizzard of litigation over the controversial move even before the president has announced it.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has widely signaled he would invoke the 1798 Act, last used to justify the internment of Japanese-American civilians during World War 2.\n\nOn Saturday, the American Civil Liberties Union and Democracy Forward filed an extraordinary lawsuit in federal court in Washington contending the order would identify a Venezuelan gang, Tren de Aragua, as a “predatory incursion” by a foreign government and seek to deport any Venezuelan in the country as a member of that gang, regardless of the facts.\n\nJames E. Boasberg, chief judge of the D.C. Circuit, agreed to implement a temporary restraining order preventing the deportation for 14 days under the act of the five Venezuelans who are already in immigration custody and believed they were being moved to be deported. Boasberg said his order was “to preserve the status quo.” Boasberg scheduled a hearing for later in the afternoon to see if his order should be expanded to protect all Venezuelans in the United States.\n\nHours later, the Trump administration appealed the initial restraining order.\n\nThe unusual flurry of litigation highlights the controversy around the Alien Enemies Act, which could give Trump vast power to deport people in the country illegally. It could let him bypass some protections of normal criminal and immigration law. But it would face immediate challenges along the lines of Saturday’s litigation because it has previously only been used during wartime.\n\nThe law requires a formal declaration of war before it can be used. But immigration lawyers were alarmed by a flurry of activity Friday night.\n\n“Last night, it appears the government was preparing to deport a number of Venezuelans they had no legal authority to deport,” said Ahilan Arulanantham, an immigration lawyer in Los Angeles who filed two petitions to block deportations that night.",

        "source": "https://www.nbcnews.com/",
        "content": "U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer has told allies to “keep the pressure” on Russian President Vladimir Putin to back a ceasefire in Ukraine, hailing Ukraine as the “party of peace.”\n\nIn his opening remarks Saturday, Starmer said Putin will “sooner or later” have to “come to the table.”\n\nUnlike the first summit on March 2, the meeting of what Starmer has termed the “coalition of the willing” is being conducted virtually. The call is expected to delve into how countries can help Ukraine militarily and financially as well as gauging support for any future possible peacekeeping mission in the event Putin backs a cessation of hostilities.\n\n“My feeling is that sooner or later he’s going to have to come to the table and engage in serious discussion, but — this is a big but for us this morning in our meeting — we can’t sit back and simply wait for that to happen,” Starmer told leaders while sitting in front of a screen in an office in 10, Downing Street.\n\n“I think that means strengthening Ukraine so they can defend themselves, and strengthening, obviously, in terms of military capability, in terms of funding, in terms of the provision of further support from all of us to Ukraine.”\n\nAround 25 countries are expected to be involved in the call, including European partners such as France and Italy, and Ukraine. Leaders from Australia, Canada and New Zealand, as well as officials from NATO and the European Union’s executive, are also set to take part. The United States is not represented at the meeting.\n\nSaturday’s meeting takes place in the wake of a U.S. proposal for a 30-day ceasefire in Ukraine, which Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has backed. Putin has indicated that he supports a truce in principle but has set out a host of details that need to be clarified before agreeing to a ceasefire.\n\n“President Zelensky, who’s with us this morning, has shown once again that Ukraine is the party of peace, because he has agreed to and committed to a 30-day unconditional ceasefire,” Starmer said. “Now what we see, and this is centerpiece for our discussions today, is that Putin is the one trying to delay.”\n\nThe United States has shifted its approach on the war since the return of President Donald Trump to the White House. The change of approach relative to that taken by Trump’s predecessor, Joe Biden, became particularly notable after Trump clashed with Zelenskyy on Feb. 28 in the Oval Office.\n\nTrump voiced optimism Friday that Putin, who met with U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff earlier in the week, will back a ceasefire.\n\n“I’m getting from the standpoint about a ceasefire and ultimately a deal some pretty good vibes coming out of Russia,” he said.\n\nStarmer has taken the lead, along with French President Emmanuel Macron, in assembling the “coalition of the willing,” in part to persuade Trump to maintain support for Kyiv. One outcome has already been a growing acceptance from European countries in particular that they need to do more to ensure their own security, including by increasing their defense spending.\n\nImages from the Elysee showed Macron and his aides listening to Starmer’s opening statement in a room of the French presidential palace.\n\nUkraine, under severe military pressure on parts of the front line three years after Russia’s full-scale invasion, has already endorsed the truce proposal. Russia’s army has gained battlefield momentum, and analysts say Putin likely will be reluctant to rush into a ceasefire while he feels he has an advantage.\n\nStarmer said that if Putin is “serious about peace,” he has to “stop his barbaric attacks” on Ukraine and agree to a ceasefire.\n\n“The world is watching,” he said.",

        "source": "https://www.nbcnews.com/",
        "content": "One of President Donald Trump’s first actions upon entering the White House was to order federal employees to return to the office.\n\nThe government workforce, he has repeatedly contended, could not be productive from home.\n\n“I happen to be a believer that you have to go to work. I don’t think you can work from home,” Trump said on Feb. 11. “Nobody’s going to work from home, they’re going to be going out, they’re going to play tennis, they’re going to play golf. They’re going to do a lot of things. They’re not working.”\n\nThree days later, Trump traveled to his sprawling Mar-a-Lago mansion in Palm Beach, where he remained for parts of six consecutive days, according to an NBC News tracker. On one of the days, Trump signed two executive orders and a memorandum. He also held an impromptu press conference.\n\nIn other words, he worked from home.\n\nThat weekend, he did what he accused federal workers of doing: He went golfing. Between Feb. 14 and Feb. 19, he golfed on four different days. While he is far from the first president to do so, each golfing trip is a cost to taxpayers.\n\nBefore that, Trump hosted Republican senators at Mar-a-Lago in early February, where he delivered remarks including an update on his administration’s cost-cutting efforts.\n\nSome federal workers said Trump’s frequent trips to his luxury estate in Florida — racking up millions of dollars in security and transportation costs — while ordering millions of government employees back to the office, reeked of hypocrisy.\n\n“It’s clear and should be to the rest of Americans that it’s never about ‘the rule,’ it’s about who’s making the rules,” said a federal employee with the Department of Education who is also a disabled veteran. “This all fits in so perfectly to the power dynamics installed by this administration — a dynamic where Trump does what he wants, to who he wants, without repercussions.”\n\n“The return-to-office mandate was never about effectiveness, collaboration or cohesion,” the employee added. “It was always about federal employees being ‘traumatically affected,’ as Russell Vought put it.”\n\nThe White House did not return a request for comment.\n\nVought was a principal author of Project 2025, which came up frequently in the 2024 presidential election. Among the many tenets in the vast conservative governing blueprint is a call to significantly shrink the workforce and expand presidential power, both of which are playing out as central thrusts of the Trump administration so far. Trump has empowered billionaire Elon Musk, his biggest donor who is also a defense contractor, to lead the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, to root out what it deems wasteful and unnecessary spending.\n\nTrump and Musk have said the federal government is bloated, and the administration has slashed tens of thousands of federal jobs already. Meanwhile, Trump’s agenda would add trillions of dollars to the federal debt, budget experts say.\n\nAt the same time, Trump has hit the links 14 times to date in his second term, with a potential for more rounds expected in the immediate future. Just since January, the cost of Trump’s golf weekends to taxpayers is more than $18 million, according to one analysis.\n\nTrump has spent five of his seven weekends as president at Mar-a-Lago, and during a sixth, he overnighted at another Trump property in Miami. This Friday, according to a Federal Aviation Administration notice, the president was back at Mar-a-Lago, where he’s expected to remain until Sunday evening. His motorcade was heading to his golf club Saturday afternoon. That would then be the seventh of eight weekends that he would spend entirely or partly away from 1600 Pennsylvania Ave.\n\nAt the same time, since his Jan. 20 inauguration, Trump and Musk have regularly denigrated the federal workforce as lazy and emblematic of waste and fraud.\n\n“I feel very badly, but many of them don’t work at all,” Trump said of fired federal workers on Wednesday while providing no basis for those comments. “Many of them never showed up to work. That’s not good.”\n\nA report compiled by the White House budget office said that as of May 2024, 54% of the 2.28 million-strong civilian federal workforce worked in person, while 46.4% were eligible to work remotely. The report said 10% of civilian personnel actually worked in remote-only positions.\n\nOne Health and Human Services employee panned Trump’s comments as false and argued that critics of federal workers don’t realize that the public is actually getting more work from employees who are based at home and not having to spend time commuting. She also called Trump’s frequent trips to Mar-a-Lago “a bad look” when considering he says he wants to send a message about saving taxpayer money.\n\nAnother jabbed at Musk’s negative comments toward federal workers in light of a Politico report that, at Musk’s request, a “massive TV” was installed in the billionaire’s office in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building so he could play video games.\n\n“I personally work my a-- off. I know everyone else is. I routinely work 50 to 60 hours a week,” and longer whenever needed, the HHS employee said. “Who is going to do all this work when they’re done with these cuts? Do people think that the public won’t be affected?”\n\nAnother worker told of colleagues attempting to quickly sell their homes to move closer to a train stop, while others were struggling to find extended hours of day care to cover the extra time for commuting. Some — including those who were exclusively hired to work remotely — will likely be forced to quit.\n\n“Everyone built their lives around these remote positions,” said a Veterans Affairs employee who is on leave with a newborn. “My supervisor lives in [Florida] and was hired as a remote employee. She can’t relocate.”\n\nAs far as presidents, Trump is not alone in his travels home. As president, Joe Biden frequently traveled to his home in Wilmington, Delaware, on the taxpayer dime. Then-first lady Jill Biden was also called out for a costly trip as she was attempting to be at Hunter Biden’s side during his trial. Amid criticism, Joe Biden at the time said he continued to hold meetings and work while home. One analysis in 2022 found that Biden’s Delaware trips at that point cost taxpayers $11 million. Barack Obama would also travel to Hawaii for vacations, which was far more costly of a journey than Palm Beach would be, said Tom Fitton, president of the legal group Judicial Watch.\n\nThe group has tracked the costs of presidential travel since Obama’s presidency and calculated that his vacations over eight years cost taxpayers at least $85 million. In an interview, Fitton said that figure may be conservative given that it was not as inclusive of ancillary costs that are often part of calculations today.\n\n“That’s a point. It’s not a big one,” Fitton said of Trump working from Mar-a-Lago even though he ordered employees back to the office.\n\n“He’s obviously president 24/7. There’s really no comparison between a president golfing on the weekend versus an employee who doesn’t really have to go into the office at all. Or whose job duties and responsibilities are [not] essential to the government,” Fitton said.\n\nHe also noted: “Presidential golfing is a perennial issue.”\n\nTrump had said he wouldn’t golf when president. In his first run for office in 2016, Trump bashed Obama for his golfing habits and repeatedly contended that the public wouldn’t see him on the course if he were president.\n\n“I love golf, but if I were in the White House, I don’t think I’d ever see Turnberry again,” he said in February 2016, in a reference to a course he owns in Scotland. “I don’t think I’d ever see Doral again,” he also said, in a reference to his course in Miami. “I don’t ever think I’d see anything — I just want to stay in the White House and work my a-- off.”\n\nAlready this year he has golfed on the Doral course in Miami that he once said he wouldn’t have time to visit.\n\nNoah Bookbinder, president of the watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, said every president is expected to take days off to recharge while getting Secret Service protection. Bookbinder said the tension, though, is Trump’s current emphasis on cutting waste even while frequently golfing. Bookbinder also pointed to another unusual circumstance involving Trump.\n\n“He is not just going to his home. He’s going to the business that he owns. And so every time he makes a trip, that brings money into his business, which puts money in his pockets,” Bookbinder said. “At the same time that he is bemoaning waste and fraud in the federal government, he’s actually through this travel having taxpayers pay his businesses, which makes him richer. That seems problematic and like a real level of irony when there’s so much emphasis on cutting down on government, police, fraud and abuse.”",

        "content": "For a year and a half, Umm Mahmoud Alerfan did everything she could to try to keep her children alive. As Israel pummeled Gaza with bombs, she kept them close, inside their shelter, terrified that a missile or sudden airstrike would steal them away.\n\nOn Friday, two months since the fragile ceasefire in Gaza was declared, Alerfan, back in Gaza City with her family, was preparing the meal to break the day’s Ramadan fast. Two of her sons, Mahmoud Alerfan, 15, and Yusuf Alerfan, 13, stepped outside — just for a moment, just to find firewood for their evening meal.\n\nBut an Israeli drone found them first, firing the missile that killed the boys and tearing Alerfan’s life apart.\n\n“Two, both of them in one day,” she screamed, stained with her sons’ blood as she wept into their lifeless bodies, brought to her on a wooden cart. Two of their friends, Malik Althatha, 13, and Salim Hasnin, 15, who had joined them to gather firewood, were also killed.\n\nNBC News’ crew on the ground captured the moment as Alerfan clutched their bodies, refusing to let go as her wails echoed through the broken streets. One man holds her back, and guides her away from the bloody scene, her sobs breaking into gasps.\n\n“I did not allow them outside, but today I did. Why did they come out today?” she asked.\n\nStanding beside one of the bodies, Awda al-Amarin struggled to understand why Israel had killed the children.\n\n“Is this a truce?” he said. “Is this peace and safety? Where is the ceasefire?”\n\nWhen asked for comment on the children’s deaths, the Israel Defense Forces told NBC News that it had targeted “terrorists” in central Gaza who it said, without providing evidence, were attempting to plant “explosive devices on the ground.”\n\nThe first phase of the ceasefire expired earlier this month, and talks continue in Doha. On the ground, the ceasefire remains marred with violence.\n\nAt least nine people were killed, including two journalists, by an Israeli airstrike on Beit Lahia in northern Gaza on Saturday, Reuters reported, citing Gaza’s health ministry.\n\nLast week, an Israeli airstrike killed two Palestinians in Rafah in the southern Gaza Strip, just a day after an Israeli drone strike killed two people in northern Gaza.\n\nMore than 48,500 people have been killed in Gaza since Israel launched its sweeping military offensive, according to local health officials, and around 70% of the infrastructure has been destroyed, according to the United Nations.\n\nIsrael launched the offensive after 250 people were taken hostage during the Hamas-led Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attacks in which 1,200 people were killed, according to Israeli officials.\n\nA report published on Thursday by United Nations-backed human rights experts accused Israel of a range of violations against women, men, girls and boys, including perpetrating “genocidal acts,” and the “systematic destruction” of reproductive health care in Gaza.\n\nIt said Israel had carried out “sexual, reproductive and other forms of gender-based violence against Palestinians,” including photographing and filming “hundreds” of Palestinian men and boys in “humiliating and degrading circumstances while subjected to acts of a sexual nature.”\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu lashed out at the Human Rights Council, a U.N.-backed body that commissioned the team of independent experts, calling it an “antisemitic, rotten, terrorist-supporting, and irrelevant body.”\n\nIsrael has denied repeated accusations of genocide.\n\nThe ceasefire deal, which began Jan. 19, called for hostages to be freed in exchange for a truce.\n\nWith no agreement on the next phase, Israel has pressed for an extension of the first phase and demanded that Hamas release half the remaining hostages before discussing a lasting ceasefire.\n\nHamas has said it wants to begin negotiations on the second phase of the deal, which would see the hostages who remain in its captivity released, along with the withdrawal of Israeli forces and ultimately an end to the war.\n\nThe militant group said last week that it had agreed to release Edan Alexander, the last living U.S. citizen held hostage in Gaza, as well as the bodies of four dual nationals.\n\nNothing has been finalized, Hazem Qassem, a Hamas spokesman told NBC News. But he said that the militant group had agreed to a proposal put forward by mediators and was awaiting the results of further negotiations.",

        "content": "PUNTA CANA, Dominican Republic — The passport of Joshua Riibe, an American linked to the disappearance of a University of Pittsburgh student, has been confiscated by Dominican authorities as part of an ongoing investigation, his attorneys told NBC News.\n\nRiibe might have been the last person to see Sudiksha Konanki, a 20-year-old University of Pittsburgh junior who went to Punta Cana on March 3 with five female friends for spring break. She was last seen around 4:15 a.m. on March 6 after going to the beach with friends.\n\nSpeaking exclusively to NBC News briefly at the resort where Konanki had been staying before her disappearance, Riibe said, “I’m just trying to help them out,” adding, “The ocean is a dangerous place.”\n\nRiibe “has been confined to the hotel since the investigation began. He is permanently escorted by the police anywhere he goes. So no, he is not free to leave,” the law firm representing him told NBC News in an email Saturday.\n\nThe Dominican Republic’s national police did not immediately respond to NBC News’ request for comment.\n\nIn an interview this week with local investigators, Riibe said he was on the beach with Konanki shortly before she disappeared.\n\nHe said they were \"in waist-deep water, talking and kissing a little,\" according to a transcript of the interview obtained by NBC News. A wave crashed, taking them both \"out to sea.\"\n\n\"I kept trying to get her to breathe, but that didn't allow me to breathe all the time, and I swallowed a lot of water,\" he said, telling investigators that he used to work as a lifeguard.\n\nRiibe said he got Konanki back to shore before she went missing.\n\n\"The last time I saw her, I asked if she was OK. I didn't hear her answer,\" he said. \"I looked around and didn't see anyone. I thought she'd grabbed her things and left.\"\n\nHe told authorities in the Dominican Republic that he was shocked to later learn she was missing.\n\nThe sheriff's office in Loudon County, Virginia, where Konanki is from and where her family lives, has described Riibe as a \"person of interest.\" The sheriff's office has no jurisdiction over the investigation but has sent detectives to Punta Cana to assist in the U.S. side of the investigation.\n\nAuthorities in the Dominican Republic said Thursday they do not use the term \"person of interest\" in the case and at this point, no one is considered a suspect.\n\nU.S. authorities say this is a missing persons case and not a criminal matter.\n\nRiibe, 22, from Rock Rapids, Iowa, is a senior at St. Cloud State University in Minnesota.",

        "content": "Skin care aficionados know that great products don’t have to cost much money. Many highly rated or expert-recommended face moisturizers, serums and eye creams are available at prices that don’t break the bank.\n\nOne brand known for affordable products that really work: The Ordinary, which offers all types of skin care for under $25. Until now, this beauty brand has been available on select sites (like Sephora) and on its own website. But it has just officially launched on Amazon, making it easy and fast to deliver its products straight to your doorstep.\n\nIn honor of this launch, we’ve rounded up some of our favorite products from The Ordinary — check them out below.\n\nWant more from NBC Select? Sign up for our newsletter, The Selection, and shop smarter.\n\nNBC Select editor and expert favorites from The Ordinary\n\nThe name of the game is hydration with this serum. It has hyaluronic acid and vitamin B5, both of which are known to moisturize skin. NBC Select reporter Zoe Malin has used this serum daily for about eight months and says her skin soaks it right up. “It’s super lightweight and dries quickly, and has a slight cooling effect which I love,” she says. “Since I’ve started using it, I’ve noticed that my skin dries out less often, and looks more hydrated overall. It’s gentle on my sensitive skin, too.”\n\nBoard-certified dermatologist Dr. Annie Chiu said she likes this affordable serum in our roundup of best niacinamide products. The water-based serum can brighten skin tone and reduce sebum to help with acne, according to the brand.\n\nExperts have told us in the past that squalane is an excellent ingredient to hydrate dry skin — and they recommended this product from The Ordinary, which is made of 100% squalane. Board-certified dermatologist Dr. Marisa Garshick told us that it feels lightweight on the skin while still delivering a lot of hydration. If you notice dryness, you can also use this solution on your nails or hair.\n\nI’ve used a lot of face cleansers in my day — including some pretty pricey options. But this cleanser costs just over $10 and is one of my favorites. The plant-derived formula removes makeup and grime at the end of a day and doesn’t strip my sensitive skin. The gel consistency also spreads quickly and feels cooling on the skin.\n\nYour skin has ceramides, which help keep your moisture barrier strong. When those natural ceramides dip, your skin can get dry and red. Experts have told us that using skin care with ceramides can help restore that barrier and soothe skin. This moisturizer contains plant-derived ceramides and hyaluronic acid to hydrate skin. The formula goes smoothly and sinks quickly so your skin doesn’t feel sticky or greasy. It also comes in a smaller size, which is good for travel.\n\nMore bestsellers from The Ordinary on Amazon\n\nWhy trust NBC Select?\n\nI’m a writer at NBC Select who covers various topics, including home, tech and beauty.

        "source": "https://www.nbcnews.com/",
        "content": "President Donald Trump said he ordered a series of airstrikes on Yemen’s capital, Sanaa, on Saturday, promising to use “overwhelming lethal force” until Iranian-backed Houthi rebels cease their attacks on shipping along a vital maritime corridor.\n\n“Our brave Warfighters are right now carrying out aerial attacks on the terrorists’ bases, leaders, and missile defenses to protect American shipping, air, and naval assets, and to restore Navigational Freedom,” Trump said in a social media post. “No terrorist force will stop American commercial and naval vessels from freely sailing the Waterways of the World.”\n\nHe also warned Iran to stop supporting the rebel group, promising to hold the country “fully accountable” for the actions of its proxy. It comes two weeks after the U.S leader sent a letter to Iranian leaders offering a path to restarting bilateral talks between the two countries on Iran’s advancing nuclear weapons program that Trump has said he will not allow to become operational.\n\nThe Houthis reported a series of explosions in their territory Saturday evening. Images circulating online show plumes of black smoke over the area of the Sanaa airport complex, which includes a sprawling military facility.\n\nThe airstrikes come a few days after the Houthis said they would resume attacks on Israeli vessels sailing in waters off Yemen in response to Israel’s blockade on Gaza. There have been no Houthi attacks reported since then.\n\nEarlier this month, Israel halted all aid coming into Gaza and warned of “additional consequences” for Hamas if their fragile ceasefire in the war isn’t extended as negotiations continue over starting a second phase.\n\nThe Houthis had described their warning as taking hold in the Red Sea, the Gulf of Aden, the Bab el-Mandeb Strait and the Arabian Sea.\n\nThe Houthis targeted over 100 merchant vessels with missiles and drones, sinking two vessels and killing four sailors, during their campaign targeting military and civilian ships between the start of the war between Israel and Hamas in late 2023 and January of this year, when a tenuous ceasefire in Gaza took effect.\n\nThe attacks greatly raised the Houthis’ profile as they faced economic problems and launched a crackdown targeting any dissent and aid workers at home amid Yemen’s decade-long stalemated war that’s torn apart the Arab world’s poorest nation.\n\nThe United States, Israel and Britain have previously hit Houthi-held areas in Yemen. Israel’s military declined to comment.\n\nThe Houthi media office said the U.S. strikes hit “a residential neighborhood” in Sanaa’s northern district of Shouab. Sanaa residents said at least four airstrikes rocked the Eastern Geraf neighborhood in Shouab district, terrifying women and children in the area.\n\n“The explosions were very strong,” said Abdallah al-Alffi. “It was like an earthquake.”\n\nThe Saturday operation against the Houthis was conducted solely by the U.S., according to a U.S. official. It was the first strike on the Yemen-based Houthis under the second Trump administration, and it comes after a period of relative quiet in the region.\n\nSuch broad-based and pre-planned missile strikes against the Houthis were done multiple times by the Biden administration in response to frequent attacks by the Houthis against commercial and military vessels in the region.\n\nThe USS Harry S. Truman carrier strike group, which includes the carrier, three Navy destroyers and one cruiser, are in the Red Sea and were part of the mission. The USS Georgia cruise missile submarine has also been operating in the region.\n\nTrump announced the strikes as he spent the day at his Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach, Florida.\n\n“These relentless assaults have cost the U.S. and World Economy many BILLIONS of Dollars while, at the same time, putting innocent lives at risk,” Trump said.",

        "content": "WASHINGTON — More than 50 universities are being investigated for alleged racial discrimination as part of President Donald Trump’s campaign to end diversity, equity and inclusion programs that his officials say exclude white and Asian American students.\n\nThe Education Department announced the new investigations Friday, one month after issuing a memo warning America’s schools and colleges that they could lose federal money over “race-based preferences” in admissions, scholarships or any aspect of student life.\n\n“Students must be assessed according to merit and accomplishment, not prejudged by the color of their skin,” Education Secretary Linda McMahon said in a statement. “We will not yield on this commitment.”\n\nMost of the new inquiries are focused on colleges’ partnerships with the PhD Project, a nonprofit that helps students from underrepresented groups get degrees in business with the goal of diversifying the business world.\n\nDepartment officials said that the group limits eligibility based on race and that colleges that partner with it are “engaging in race-exclusionary practices in their graduate programs.”\n\nThe group of 45 colleges facing scrutiny over ties to the PhD Project include major public universities such as Arizona State, Ohio State and Rutgers, along with prestigious private schools like Yale, Cornell, Duke and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.\n\nA statement from Ohio State said the university “does not discriminate on the basis of race, ethnicity or any other protected class, and our PhD programs are open to all qualified applicants.”\n\nA message sent to the PhD Project was not immediately returned.\n\nSix other colleges are being investigated for awarding “impermissible race-based scholarships,” the department said, and another is accused of running a program that segregates students on the basis of race.\n\nThe Education Department said those schools are: Grand Valley State University, Ithaca College, the New England College of Optometry, the University of Alabama, the University of Minnesota, the University of South Florida and the University of Oklahoma at Tulsa.\n\nAn initial press release from the Education Department erroneously identified the University of Tulsa as one of the schools under investigation.\n\nThe Feb. 14 memo from Trump’s Republican administration was a sweeping expansion of a 2023 Supreme Court decision that barred colleges from using race as a factor in admissions.\n\nThat decision focused on admissions policies at Harvard and the University of North Carolina, but the Education Department said it will interpret the decision to forbid race-based policies in any aspect of education, both in K-12 schools and higher education.\n\nIn the memo, Craig Trainor, acting assistant secretary for civil rights, had said schools’ and colleges’ diversity, equity and inclusion efforts have been “smuggling racial stereotypes and explicit race-consciousness into everyday training, programming and discipline.”\n\nThe memo is being challenged in federal lawsuits from the nation’s two largest teachers’ unions. The suits say the memo is too vague and violates the free speech rights of educators.",

This is especially true if you find pieces that are constructed well and won’t wear down after a few washes. We also love when workout gear is moisture wicking — there's nothing worse than stinky, wet clothes.\n\nFor all those reasons, our editors love Lululemon. And right now, the brand is offering up to 50% on over 700 items with its “We Made Too Much” sale. To help you shop, we rounded up some of our favorite pieces from the sale — including items that NBC Select editors have previously tested and raved about.\n\nWant more from NBC Select? Sign up for our newsletter, The Selection, and shop smarter.\n\nThe best women's sale at Lululemon\n\nThese leggings earned the number two spot on our list of the top 50 pairs of leggings.\n\nThey have a drawstring at the waist for a customized fit and are made from a breathable, sweat-wicking fabric. “The number one issue I tend to have with leggings is that they slide down, but the waistband drawstring lets me secure these in place with no issues,” says NBC Select editorial projects manager Rebecca Rodriguez. These leggings also have two side pockets and an additional hidden pocket in the waistband for cash, keys or a license.\n\nMade of a nylon and Lycra blend, these leggings are intended for yoga but can also be worn for other low-impact workouts. They are sweat-wicking and have a side pocket for your phone and a small pocket in the back of the waistband. This pair is also cropped and hits most people right above the ankle.\n\nThis style made our list of the best sports bras because it gives comfortable support. It has four wide, flat crisscross straps that keep it in place as you move. The straps are also adjustable so that you can customize the fit. The bra has molded foam cups, a sturdy underband, and compressive fabric for additional support.\n\nThis oversized hoodie hits at the waist for a flattering fit and is made from a thick fleece fabric that is both stylish and functional. It has front pockets to stash your stuff in and thumb holes that can be pulled over your thumbs for extra warmth. The zipper also has an elastic attachment that can be pulled off and used as a hair tie if you need one.\n\nThe best men’s sale at Lululemon\n\nThese pants look like traditional trousers but are as comfortable as a workout pant. They have a slim fit and are made with a cotton twill fabric with four-way stretch. They have discrete zippered side pockets and welt pockets on the back that close with snaps.\n\nThis half-zip is made from lightweight jersey, making it a good layering piece for outdoor workouts or casual errands. The material is sweat-wicking and quick-drying, and it has a high neck that can be zipped up for warmth or unzipped for more breathability.

        "source": "https://www.nbcnews.com/",
        "content": "LINCOLN HEIGHTS, Ohio — Nearly every morning for the last month, Jay has been waking up before sunrise to drive around the streets of Lincoln Heights, patrolling neighborhood bus stops to make sure children are getting to school safely.\n\n“We have a very tight community, so all of our kids, they know us,” he said.\n\nBut for anyone outside the community, Jay’s presence might be a mystery. He wears a face covering along with tactical vests, and Jay is not his real name, which he asked not to use to prevent harassment from hate groups.\n\nAn armed volunteer for the Lincoln Heights Safety and Watch Program stands guard near a community center. NBC News\n\nHe’s a member of the Lincoln Heights Safety and Watch program, an initiative that started shortly after Feb. 7, when a neo-Nazi group waving swastika flags and shouting racial slurs demonstrated on a highway overpass just on the edge of this majority-Black community about 30 minutes north of Cincinnati.\n\nOfficers from Evendale, which borders Lincoln Heights, and the Hamilton County Sheriff’s Office both responded that day. No arrests were made, and Evendale police officers did not take down any names or identifying information from members of the neo-Nazi group, according to the mayor’s office. The Hamilton County Prosecutor’s office is currently investigating the incident to see if criminal charges could be filed.\n\nIn a statement, Evendale Mayor Richard Finan said officers’ emphasis on de-escalation “resulted in the incident’s resolution without injuries to any of the persons involved, passersby or law enforcement officers. During this evolving scene, protecting life took priority over immediate identification.” The Evendale Police Department was the first to respond to the incident, which took place on a bridge linking Evendale with Lincoln Heights.\n\nBut for Daronce Daniels, the safety and watch group’s spokesperson, the police response was just as alarming as the neo-Nazi appearance, making residents feel they wouldn’t be protected if another hate group were to visit their town.\n\n“They’ve been very clear that if it happens again, they’ll allow it to happen again, that their hands are tied,” Daniels said.\n\nLincoln Heights residents said the police response to the incident was insufficient, prompting Daniels and other members of the Heights Movement, an existing community empowerment organization, to devise the safety and watch program, which includes armed volunteers wearing tactical gear and face coverings. Some of the same volunteers who helped mentor youth through the Heights Movement are now going on armed patrols. Ohio state law allows anyone legally allowed to own a gun to open carry without a permit.\n\nThe safety and watch program sprung from an existing group called the Heights Movement, which focused on youth mentoring and community empowerment. Now, some of the Heights Movement’s volunteers take part in armed patrols. Daronce Daniels\n\n“I’ve never felt safer as a Black man in my community than I have right now,” Daniels said. “These are my friends. These are my cousins, my brothers, my sisters, my aunties.”\n\nLocal business owner Eric Ruffin was accosted in his car by the neo-Nazi group as he was coming home from a work meeting.\n\nHe said he supports law enforcement, but that its handling of the Feb. 7 demonstration doesn’t give him faith that it will protect him in the future. For that reason, he says he’s proud of the neighborhood safety and watch program, even though he wishes it weren’t needed.\n\n“What I don’t understand is how I can be standing here in America in 2025 and somebody can walk up to my window with a swastika and have guns and call me the N-word and law enforcement watch,” Ruffin said.\n\n“We don’t want to become what we hate. You know, we don’t want to become a group of people that walk around feeling like we have a reason in America to have to protect ourselves. That’s what the Nazis want.”\n\nVolunteers start the day by patrolling and monitoring school bus pickup locations. NBC News\n\nThe village of Lincoln Heights was formed in 1923 for Black families escaping the South, and it incorporated in 1946 as the “first African American self-governing community north of the Mason-Dixon Line,” according to the town’s website. However, residents say the community has been underserved by local municipalities, and its police department was disbanded in 2014, according to the Cincinnati Enquirer, leaving it under the jurisdiction of the Hamilton County Sheriff.\n\nFor many safety and watch volunteers, that history plays a role in their decision to add to their everyday duties as parents and workers.\n\n“It’s just something that our grandfathers and our great-grandmothers — they started this. So we’re going to make sure that that history stays intact,” said one volunteer, who asked to remain anonymous for fear of retaliation from hate groups.\n\nYard signs that read “We Support Lincoln Heights Safety & Watch” are peppered throughout the town, and community members could be seen waving to safety and watch volunteers as they stood guard near the local elementary school one Tuesday morning.\n\nSigns showing support for the Lincoln Heights Safety and Watch Program can be seen throughout the town. NBC News\n\nChantelle Phillips said she saw the neo-Nazi rally playing out on social media as it happened. She said she trusts the neighborhood protection group to be more proactive than officers with the Hamilton County Sheriff’s Office, whose jurisdiction includes Lincoln Heights.\n\n“I feel like it’s more secure now,” Phillips said. “I know my son can walk home and be OK.”\n\nHamilton County Sheriff Charmaine McGuffey is now calling on the Ohio state Legislature to pass laws that make it illegal to wear a mask “for the purpose of intimidation” while open carrying. She said this measure would have given her officers more leeway to make arrests during the neo-Nazi rally.\n\nIn an interview with NBC News, she defended her officers’ response on Feb. 7 but said she understands why Lincoln Heights residents are concerned for their safety. Still, she worries that an armed confrontation between neighborhood residents and another hate group could lead to a dangerous situation.\n\n“They feel they need to arm their residents, and they’re allowed to,” McGuffey said. “At some point, we are going to likely face a very dangerous situation that we are trained to handle. But the unknown is, who else is armed? How many juveniles are standing around with a gun in their hand? I cannot be more emphatic that this issue that we’re embedded in, and the way that people are reacting and acting with guns with open carry is directly related to the inaction of legislators who say they support law enforcement, who say they support families and order, and they do not.”",

        "title": "Goodbye to ‘bags fly free’ on Southwest Airlines, the last freebie in America",
        "source": "https://www.nbcnews.com/",
        "content": "Almost nothing is guaranteed in life. Certainly not weather, electricity, health, tariffs or eggs. But for more than 50 years, American consumers could count on Southwest Airlines letting them check bags for free.\n\nDallas-based Southwest is ending the policy in May. Customers are not happy.\n\n“It was the only reason I flew Southwest,” said MaKensey Kaye Alford, a 21-year-old singer and actress who lives near Birmingham, Alabama.\n\nAlford, who is planning to move to New York City later this year, said she would “definitely” consider taking another airline now.\n\nSouthwest’s customer-friendly policies have survived recessions, oil price spikes and even the Covid-19 pandemic, winning it years of goodwill and a loyal following, even as it has grown. No other airline carries more people in the United States than Southwest.\n\nNow, the airline with an unrivaled streak of profitability (its almost never posted an annual loss) is under pressure to increase profits as big competitors outpace the airline. So it’s backpedaling off of years of banishing the thought that they would charge customers for bags, adding to other business-model tweaks like assigned seating that give it more in common with all other airlines.\n\nErrol Joseph, 36, a sales consultant who lives in New York and Dallas, said he would now consider flying on Delta Air Lines if the price is the same as Southwest because its planes have seatback screens, unlike Southwest. Joseph added that with baggage policy change, there’s “pretty much no reason to be loyal.”\n\nThe bag policy had been around longer than most women were able to get credit cards on their own without a man’s signature. But those days are over. No more freebies, America.\n\nRetailers, restaurants and airlines are among the businesses that have been pulling back on free perks, from complimentary birthday coffees to free package returns, since the pandemic ended.\n\nIncreasingly, airline perks are only available for loyalty program members or customers who buy a more expensive ticket.\n\nDelta offers customers free Wi-Fi on board, but only for those who have signed up for its SkyMiles loyalty program. United Airlines is making a similar move, meanwhile, installing equipment on its planes so customers can soon connect to Elon Musk’s Starlink satellite Wi-Fi for free if they are members of the airline’s MileagePlus program.\n\nIt typically takes real financial pressure for companies to return to giveaways, but it’s not unprecedented. Starbucks, for example, got rid of upcharges for dairy alternatives to attract customers to try to reverse a sales slump.\n\nCustomers vs. investors\n\nSouthwest’s decision pits investors against customers.\n\nActivist hedge fund and, as of last year, big Southwest shareholder Elliott Investment Management has been increasing pressure on the airline to raise its profits as rivals like Delta and United have pulled ahead. Elliott pushed for faster changes at the carrier, which has been long hesitant to change, so it could increase revenue. The firm last year won five board seats in a settlement with Southwest.\n\nIn fact, after Southwest unveiled the bag shift and other policy changes, its shares rose close to 9% this week, while Delta, United and American, each fell more than 11%. CEOs of all the carriers raised concerns about weaker-than-expected travel demand, but Southwest bucked the trend, as it expects the changes to add hundreds of millions of dollars to its bottom line.\n\n“Shareholder activism is reshaping LUV into a company that we believe investors will eventually gravitate to,” wrote Seaport Research Partners airline analyst Dan McKenzie in a note Wednesday as he raised his price target on Southwest’s shares to $39 thanks to the policy changes even though “macro backdrop is glum.”\n\nThe decision to ditch the two-free-checked bags is part of the airline’s big profit-seeking makeover in which it is shedding other long-standing offerings like open-seating and single-class cabins for seat assignments and pricier extra legroom options.\n\nIt will also start offering a no-frills, no-changes basic economy ticket. Flight credits will also soon have expiration dates. Last month, Southwest had its first-ever mass layoff, cutting about 15% of corporate jobs. It has also slashed unprofitable flying.\n\nAir travel hasn’t stood still over the last half century, and while it’s held onto many core tenets, neither has Southwest. It has gradually made changes over the years, starting to sell things like early boarding, for example. And with air travel breaking new records, assigned seating is necessary for both customers and to make the jobs of employees easier, Southwest executives have argued.\n\nAbout-face\n\nCharging for checked bags was something Southwest leaders repeatedly said would cost it more than it could make. (U.S. carriers brought in more than $7 billion in baggage fees in 2023.)\n\nIn a presentation at an investor day last September, Southwest said it would gain between $1 billion and $1.5 billion from charging for bags but lose $1.8 billion of market share.\n\nSouthwest executives said that’s changed.\n\nHours after breaking the news to customers, CEO Bob Jordan said at a JPMorgan industry conference on Tuesday that “in contrast to our previous analysis, actual customer booking behavior through our new booking channels such as metasearch, did not show that we are getting the same benefit from our bundled offering with free bags, which has led us to update the assumptions.”\n\nJordan added that the carrier has new executives with “direct experience implementing bag fees at multiple airlines, and that’s also helped further validate the new assumptions.”\n\nMaverick airline’s shift\n\nBut thousands joined in consumers’ cri de coeur.\n\nSouthwest posted on Instagram on Thursday, two days after its bombshell announcement, saying “It’s not like we traded Luka,” a nod to the shocking February trade of Dallas Mavericks superstar Luka Doncic to the Los Angeles Lakers. As of Friday afternoon, the post, which also included information about the change, got more than 14,000 replies, far more than couple of hundred responses the account usually gets.\n\n“Taking a screen shot of this as it will be the thumbnail for the harvard business review case study of destroying a brand an entire company,” replied Instagram user rappid_exposure.\n\nFrances Frei, a professor of technology and operations management at Harvard Business School, said that, indeed, no other company is likely as studied as Southwest.\n\n“I sure hope this isn’t a case of activist investors coming in and insisting on a set of decisions that they won’t be around to have to endure,” she said. “Great organizations get built over time. It doesn’t take very long to ruin an organization, and I really don’t want this to be an example of that.”\n\nBetting the house\n\nSouthwest’s two checked bags-fly-free policy officially ends May 28 but for now the slogan is still found on board, printed on cocktail napkins.\n\nThere will be exceptions: Customers who have a Southwest Airlines co-branded credit card can get one bag for free, and customers in its top tiers of service (read: pricier tickets) or its top-tier loyalty program members will get one to two free checked bags.\n\nWhether customers abandon Southwest or are simply reacting to the change remains to be seen.\n\nThe CEOs of Delta, United and Spirit this week said they see an opportunity to win over customers who might turn away from Southwest.\n\nMany travelers won’t have a lot of other options, however, with so much consolidation among U.S. carriers and stronghold hubs, though they might have to venture to other airports.\n\nSouthwest has a roughly 73% share at Baltimore/Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport, a more than 83% share in San Francisco Bay Oakland International Airport, and 89% share in Long Beach, California, according to aviation-data firm Cirium.\n\nCarrying on\n\nThe real test, Harvard’s Frei said, will be whether the bag change will slow down Southwest’s operation, with more customers bringing carry-on bags on board to avoid the checked luggage fees.\n\n“I just fear the cost is being underestimated,” she said. “It’s real operational harm to Southwest if they go slower.”\n\nSouthwest is already preparing its employees for an onslaught of customer luggage at the gate.\n\nJust after its announcement on Tuesday, Southwest told its employees in a memo that customers will “undoubtedly carry on more luggage than before.”\n\nGate agents will receive mobile bag-tag printers “reducing the need for string bag tags” and the company will design new carry-on size guides so customers can see if their luggage fits as a carry on, according to a staff memo sent by Justin Jones, EVP of operations, and Adam Decaire, senior vice president of network planning, a copy of which was seen by CNBC.\n\nThe airline also plans to speed up retrofits of its Boeing 737-800s and Max aircraft with bigger overhead bins.\n\nFrei said not charging for bags, unlike the Costco $1.50 hot dog, is not a loss leader, something a company sells at a loss just to win over customers who might buy more expensive, and profitable, items.\n\nAs much as it’s been beloved by customers, the checked bag policy also had a helped the airline turn planes around faster.\n\n“The reason isn’t because it’s kinder to customers. It’s because it’s a fast turnaround airline,” she said. “If I charge for bags, you will be more likely to carry more luggage on board. And when you carry more luggage on board, I lose my fast turnaround advantage.”\n\nSouthwest is confident that it’s prepared for an increase in gate-checked bags and onboard luggage.\n\n“We have a series of work streams that are underway with our with our current operations, to make this not impact our turn times,” COO Andrew Watterson said in an interview.\n\nTime will tell how it shakes out. For now, we have the $1.50 Costco hot dogs.",

        "content": "Chuck E. Cheese wants you to stop by as frequently as you pick up groceries, and it’s selling subscription plans to sweeten the pitch.\n\nThe 47-year-old pizzeria and arcade chain has emerged from bankruptcy with renovated locations, a slew of digital upgrades and a membership program that it hopes will prove both affordable and habit-forming. The goal isn’t to be just someplace to take your kids once or twice a year for birthday parties. It’s to turn Chuck E. Cheese into a routine recreational option that can compete with Netflix and the neighborhood playground alike.\n\n“For us to win this game, we need to drive multi-visitation,” David McKillips, the president and CEO of Chuck E. Cheese’s parent company, told NBC News in January.\n\nChuck E. Cheese recently invested $350 million to remodel its more than 460 U.S. locations. Chuck E. Cheese\n\nThe chain launched a membership program in August 2024 and said Tuesday that it has sold 200,000 12-month subscriptions since then, with three tiers ranging from $7.99 to $29.99 a month. Annual “Fun Pass” holders get unlimited visits, discounts on food and attractions, and other perks to encourage what McKillips described as “active play” — a post-pandemic priority for customers.\n\nEven at the upper price point, he said, “it is very reasonable for parents and families to come out and have a reasonably priced pizza and gameplay every single day.”\n\nMaking memberships work will require Chuck E. Cheese to carve a place in consumers’ wallets alongside their other subscriptions — for everything from streaming services to wholesale clubs — at a time when many are looking to trim their spending.\n\nThe upgrades are designed to ensure visitors find something new every time they walk through the doors, McKillips said.\n\nIt is very reasonable for parents and families to come out and have a reasonably priced pizza and gameplay every single day. David McKillips, ceo of cec entertainment\n\nGone are most of the chain’s iconic animatronics, though the company agreed to hang on to more of them at select locations after a fan outcry. McKillips acknowledged that “Five Nights at Freddy’s,” a 2023 horror flick based on a video game series in which the robomascots of a defunct pizza chain are possessed by the spirits of dead children, “had some impact regarding the brand overall.”\n\nBut he added, “People were talking about Chuck E. Cheese, which is good for us.”\n\nNow there are far fewer life-size rodent musicians and more jumbotrons, a digital dance floor and other displays for digital media that can be refreshed continuously.\n\n“We just switched out of our holiday content,” McKillips said at the start of the year. “Then it goes into evergreen, and then we’ve got spring and a summer of fun and Halloween.”\n\nChuck E. Cheese is also revamping its play spaces to include trampolines and obstacle courses, part of an effort to “create an adventure zone in every single one of our locations,” McKillips said.\n\nChildren jump on a trampoline at Chuck E. Cheese. Chuck E. Cheese\n\nThe brand recently invested $350 million to remodel its over 460 U.S. locations, launch a new slate of games and tweak its food offerings. The changes are part of a turnaround effort after the company filed for bankruptcy in 2020, when Covid-19 slammed into brick-and-mortar businesses of all kinds. The company avoided mass store closures, in part by using idled Chuck E. Cheese kitchens to prepare food for delivery under the name Pasqually’s Pizza & Wings. McKillips said that solution kept all the chain’s general managers employed.\n\nThe company is also refreshing its food menu with more “grown-up” options, including items that cater to “a little bit spicier palate.” And while Chuck E. Cheese has plenty of options to entertain 4- and 5-year-olds, “the teenagers come in, you know, older siblings — we’ve got games for them as well,” McKillips said.\n\nThe effort to appeal to the full range of family tastes is key to getting “parents and kids playing together,” he said. “That is the greatest driver of our guests and how we built the entire new Chuck E. Cheese.”",

        "content": "Flagging global sales and Elon Musk’s increasingly outspoken political activities are combining to rock the value of Tesla.\n\nShares in the once-trillion-dollar company saw their worst day in five years this week. Year to date, Tesla’s stock has plunged 36% — though it is still up by some 54% over the past 12 months.\n\nFor Musk, Tesla’s shares remain his primary source of paper wealth, though he has also turned his stake in SpaceX into a personal lending tool. But it was proceeds from selling Tesla shares that helped Musk complete his acquisition of Twitter, now known as X.\n\nMusk’s wealth also allowed him to help vault Donald Trump into a second presidential term. Even as Musk’s net worth has diminished as a result of Tesla’s recent share-price declines, data suggests he is in no danger of losing his title as the world’s wealthiest person.\n\nMusk has said on X that he is not concerned about Tesla’s recent drop in value. Still, evidence suggests the company is entering a period of transition.\n\nA spokesperson for Tesla did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nMusk’s wealth has propelled him to a global presence that lacks precedent — and has polarized world opinion about the tech entrepreneur in the process. Any weakening of his financial position, therefore, could undercut his influence in the political and tech spaces where he now commands outsize attention.According to Bank of America, Tesla’s European sales plummeted by about 50% in January compared with the same month a year prior.\n\nSome say this is attributable to a growing distaste for Musk, who has begun dabbling in the continent’s politics in the wake of his successful support of Trump’s candidacy last year.\n\nOthers note Tesla’s European market is facing increased competition from the Chinese electric-vehicle maker BYD, which has telegraphed ambitious plans for expansion on the continent.\n\nA more decisive blow to Tesla’s near-term fortunes may be emanating from China itself. There, Tesla’s shipments plunged 49% in February from a year earlier, to just 30,688 vehicles, according to official data cited by Bloomberg News. That’s the lowest monthly figure registered since July 2022 — amid the throes of Covid-19 — when it shipped just 28,217 EVs, Bloomberg said.\n\nDonald Trump accompanied by Elon Musk speaks Tuesday next to a Tesla Model S on the South Lawn of the White House. Andrew Harnik / Getty Images\n\nTesla is now facing intense competition from other Chinese EV makers, including BYD.\n\nYet even there, a Chinese official also warned about the impact of Musk’s high-profile politicking.\n\n“As a successful businessman, one should be embracing 100% of the market: Treat everyone nicely, and everyone will be nice in return,” the secretary of China’s Passenger Car Association, said in a briefing Monday, Bloomberg reported. “But if you look at it in terms of voting, then half of voters will be friendly to you and half of them won’t be.”\n\n“This is the unavoidable risk that’s come after he got his personal glory,” the secretary, Cui Dongshu, said Monday, referring to Musk.\n\nOn Friday, Reuters reported Tesla was planning to sell a Model Y costing at least 20% less to produce to defend its China share.\n\nAnd in the U.S., Tesla’s January sales were down about 11%, according to data from the S&P Global analytics group — an outlier at a time when EV sales for all other brands are trending higher in America.\n\nThough he has long worn multiple proverbial hats, Musk’s role in the White House as nominal head of the Department of Government Efficiency may be his most consequential. And having influence with the Trump administration could be critical to Tesla’s fortunes. This week, Trump promised he would purchase a Tesla in a showy presentation on the White House lawn, seemingly further cementing the Trump-Musk alliance.\n\nOn X — the social media platform he owns — Musk’s frenetic posting is increasingly focused on politics and America’s culture wars, with an occasional nod to SpaceX launches.\n\nHis apparently undiminished role in the Trump administration — he was seen leaving the White House last weekend alongside Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick — has sparked boycotts in Europe, as well as protests and even acts of vandalism against auto owners in the U.S.\n\n“When people’s cars are in jeopardy of being keyed or set on fire out there, even people who support Musk or are indifferent to Musk might think twice about buying a Tesla,” Ben Kallo, an analyst at Baird, told CNBC’s “Squawk on the Street” on Monday.\n\nIn a note to clients this week downgrading its estimate of deliveries, analysts with JPMorgan said the damage to Tesla’s brand has been serious.\n\n“We struggle to think of anything analogous in the history of the automotive industry, in which a brand has lost so much value so quickly,” they wrote.\n\nTesla itself is warning about the fallout from retaliatory measures taken by countries targeted by Trump’s tariffs, saying in a letter to the U.S. Trade Representative this week that the company may be “exposed to disproportionate impacts when other countries respond to US trade actions.”\n\nAlready, the Canadian province of British Columbia has announced it was ending subsidies for Tesla’s products.\n\nFor all the oxygen Musk has taken up with his political activities, concerns about Tesla products themselves are equally keeping investors and analysts up at night.\n\nMusk has “neglect[ed] the rest of Tesla’s automotive business as he thought that by the end of every year for the last 6 years, Tesla would be able to flip a switch and make all its vehicles self-driving — automatically increasing their value and making them infinitely more competitive than other vehicles,” Fred Lambert, who covers the company for the Electrek electric vehicle blog, wrote in a recent post.\n\nMeanwhile, Musk decided to kill Tesla’s cheaper, $25,000 model while going all-in on the Cybertruck, whose sales have yet to take off, Lambert said.\n\n“Tesla’s core business remains selling cars and batteries,” he wrote. “There’s no doubt that the business of selling cars is not going well for Tesla right now, and under Musk, there’s no clear path to improvement.”\n\nBy contrast, many analysts continue to take a much longer view of Tesla’s outlook. In his most recent note to clients about the company, Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas, one of the most closely watched observers of Tesla, summarized the long-term outlook that he says continues to justify the company’s eye-watering valuation.\n\n“Tesla’s softer auto deliveries are emblematic of a company in the transition from an automotive ‘pure play’ to a highly diversified play on AI and robotics,” he wrote in a note March 2.\n\nWhile that was before the most recent sell-off intensified, Jonas said he was already discounting market gyrations.\n\n“While the journey may be volatile and non-linear, we believe 2025 will be a year where investors will continue to appreciate and value these existing and nascent industries of embodied AI where we believe Tesla has established a material competitive advantage,” he wrote.",

        "source": "https://www.nbcnews.com/",
        "content": "President Donald Trump signed an executive order on Friday aimed at gutting the parent of U.S. government-funded media outlet Voice of America and six other federal agencies, his administration’s latest step to shrink bureaucracy.\n\nThe order instructs the agencies — largely little-known entities including one that provides funding for museums and libraries and one tackling homelessness — to reduce their operations to the bare minimum mandated by the law.\n\n“This order continues the reduction in the elements of the Federal bureaucracy that the President has determined are unnecessary,” the order, disclosed late on Friday, says. Trump, who clashed with the Voice of America during his first term, picked former news anchor Kari Lake to be its director for his second. Lake, a staunch ally of the president, has often accused mainstream media of harboring anti-Trump bias.\n\nVOA, an international media broadcaster that operates in more than 40 languages online and on radio and television, is overseen by the U.S. Agency for Global Media. The agency also funds Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty and Radio Free Asia.\n\nIn addition to the Agency for Global Media, Trump’s order also targets the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service, the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, the Institute of Museum and Library Services, the U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness, the Community Development Financial Institutions Fund, and the Minority Business Development Agency for cuts.\n\nThe order says those agencies should eliminate all operations not codified in statute as well as “reduce the performance of their statutory functions and associated personnel to the minimum presence and function required by law.” The order represents the latest step by Trump to remake the federal bureaucracy, a task he has largely put in the hands of tech billionaire Elon Musk and his Department of Government Efficiency. So far, the DOGE effort has produced potential cuts of more than 100,000 jobs across the 2.3 million-member federal civilian workforce, the freezing of foreign aid, and the cancellation of thousands of programs and contracts.\n\nSome Republicans have accused VOA and other publicly-funded media outlets of being biased against conservatives. Last month, Musk called for VOA and Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty to be shut down in a post to his X social media platform.\n\nIn a speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference, Lake said that while she understood calls to completely dismantle VOA, she believed it could be improved.",

        "title": "Judge expands temporary block on Trump's plan to use the Alien Enemies Act to deport suspected Venezuelan gang members",
        "source": "https://www.nbcnews.com/",
        "content": "A federal judge on Saturday temporarily blocked an effort by President Donald Trump to use the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to deport suspected members of a Venezuelan gang he has accused of “unlawfully infiltrating” the country. He also ordered any deportation flights carrying those subject to the presidential proclamation to return to the United States.\n\nTrump on Saturday invoked the rarely used wartime authority, accusing Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua of “infiltrating” Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro’s regime, including its “military and law enforcement apparatus”; perpetuating “irregular warfare” within the United States and using drug trafficking as a weapon against American citizens.\n\nHours before the White House published Trump’s proclamation, the American Civil Liberties Union and Democracy Forward filed a lawsuit accusing the White House of preparing to imminently deport five Venezuelan men under the Alien Enemies Act.\n\nChief Judge of the D.C. District Court James E. Boasberg initially issued a temporary restraining order preventing the Trump administration from deporting the five Venezuelans named in the lawsuit for at least 14 days.\n\nBoasberg has now expanded the decision to apply to “all non-citizens in U.S. custody” who are subject to Trump’s proclamation.\n\nThe Justice Department plans to appeal the expanded decision, according to a source familiar.\n\nThe ruling means all Venezuelan citizens 14 years or older who are members of Tren de Aragua, currently in the country and are not naturalized or lawful permanent residents of the United States are to remain in the United States for 14 days or until further order of the court.\n\n“Any plane containing these folks that is going to take off, or is in the air, needs to be returned to the United States,” the judge said. “Those people need to be returned to the United States.”\n\nThe judge’s ruling does not apply to individuals who have already been ordered to leave the country for reasons separate from Trump’s invocation of the Alien Enemies Act, nor does it include individuals who have already landed and disembarked in a foreign country. The judge said once those individuals are off the plane and on the ground in a foreign country, they are no longer in the court’s jurisdiction.\n\nThe judge scheduled another hearing on Friday, March 21, for further arguments.\n\n“Today was a horrific day in the history of the nation, when the President publicized that he was seeking to invoke extraordinary wartime powers in the absence of a war or invasion and claiming virtually unlimited authority to remove people from the country,” Skye Perryman, the president of Democracy Forward, said in a statement. “But, tonight the rule of law prevailed. The government has been forced to turn planes around and our lawsuit — filed in the very early hours this morning — has resulted in broad relief.”\n\nDuring a hearing on Saturday afternoon, the judge was assured by Justice Department lawyers that the five Venezuelans ordered to remain in the country were not currently on deportation flights.\n\nAttorneys for the nonprofit groups challenging Trump’s order told the judge they were aware of flights that had taken off from Texas with other Venezuelans on board, heading to both Honduras and El Salvador.\n\nThe judge in response warned the government that it must comply with the court’s order.\n\n“This is something you need to make sure is complied with immediately,” Boasberg said. “These folks are going to be sent to Salvadorian and Honduran prisons, which are not going to be terribly receptive to Venezuelans.”\n\nA source familiar with the migrant deportation flights told NBC News that two flights with Venezuelans onboard were in transit today and will be turned around following the judge's order.\n\nThe Alien Enemies Act of 1798 enables the president to quickly detain and deport immigrants from a “hostile” nation, either during times of “declared war” or when a foreign government perpetuates an “invasion” or “predatory incursion” into the United States. Only Congress has the constitutional power to declare war.\n\n“Over the years, Venezuelan national and local authorities have ceded ever-greater control over their territories to transnational criminal organizations, including TdA [Tren De Aragua],” Trump’s proclamation reads. “The result is a hybrid criminal state that is perpetrating an invasion of and predatory incursion into the United States, and which poses a substantial danger to the United States.”\n\nLegal experts have challenged Trump’s interpretation of the Alien Enemies Act, arguing that it was designed only to be used in times of war, and invoking it to deport immigrants could be unlawful.\n\nIlya Somin, a professor at George Mason University’s Antonin Scalia Law School, wrote earlier this year that “illegal migration and cross-border drug-smuggling do not qualify as ‘invasion’ and certainly not as an invasion by a ‘hostile nation or government.’”\n\nAccording to an analysis of the law by the Brennan Center for Justice, “the Alien Enemies Act permits the apprehension, restraint, securing, and removal of noncitizens. It also explicitly grants the president the power to determine when and how to do so.”\n\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio last month designated Tren de Aragua as a foreign terrorist organization after Trump signed an executive order creating a process for him to do so.\n\nTrump in the order accused the group of engaging in a “campaign of violence and terror” and flooding “the United States with deadly drugs, violent criminals, and vicious gangs.” In the same order, Trump directed federal officials to “make operational preparations” for the “implementation” of the Alien Enemies Act.\n\nTrump’s invocation of the Alien Enemies Act fulfills a pledge he made on the campaign trail to use the law to target suspected gang members, drug dealers and cartel members.\n\n“I’ll invoke immediately the Alien Enemies Act to remove all known or suspected gang members, the drug dealers, the cartel members from the United States, ending the scourge of illegal alien gang violence once and for all,” Trump said during a 2023 campaign speech in Dubuque, Iowa.\n\nTrump is the first president in nearly a century to invoke the Alien Enemies Act, and the first to do so outside of a major military conflict. It was last invoked in 1941 by President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, who used the law to target people of Japanese, German and Italian descent during World War II, an act that the United States has since apologized for.\n\nDemocratic lawmakers have tried for years to repeal the Alien Enemies Act, with Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., and Sen. Mazie Hirono, D-Hawaii, introducing legislation in January to do so.\n\n“We cannot allow antiquated laws to continue enabling discriminatory practices that harm immigrant communities,” Omar said in a January statement.",

        "title": "Teacher ordered to remove signs from classroom, including one saying 'Everyone is welcome here'",
        "source": "https://www.nbcnews.com/",
        "content": "An Idaho teacher is in a standoff with her own school district after officials ordered her to remove classroom signs, including one that reads, “Everyone is welcome here.”\n\nSarah Inama, a sixth-grade history teacher at Lewis and Clark Middle School in Meridian, Idaho, says she won’t comply with the order, arguing that the message is a fundamental part to ensuring a positive learning environment for her students.\n\nInama, who has taught at the school for five years, says her commitment to inclusivity isn’t about politics. It’s about her passion for education and students.\n\n“I love the area that I teach,” she says in an interview with TODAY.com. “It’s really a valuable thing for people to know our human history, things that humans have accomplished, our time on this earth, things that they’ve overcome, patterns that exist.”\n\nFive years ago, when she first put up the two signs, it was to make sure students knew they were in an open and welcoming space. Now, she says she is risking her job in the name of those values.\n\nA notice from her school district\n\nInama says the controversy began in January when her principal and vice principal came to her classroom to inform her that two posters on her walls were controversial and needed to be removed, a detail the district verified in an email to TODAY.com. Inama says other teachers were given similar instruction, but she was caught off guard by the directive.\n\nPhotos of the two posters show that one features the phrase “Everyone is welcome here,” with an illustration of hands in different skin tones. The other says that everyone in the classroom is “welcome, important, accepted, respected, encouraged, valued” and “equal.”\n\n“I was just so confused,” she recalls. “I still can’t even wrap my head around what they’re referring to as far as why it’s controversial.”\n\nInama says the principal cited district policy that classrooms must respect the rights of people to express differing opinions and that decorations are to be “content-neutral.”\n\n“There are only two opinions on this sign: Everyone is welcome here or not everyone is welcome here,” she says. “Since the sign is emphasizing that everyone, in regards to race or skin tone, is welcome here no matter what, immediately, I was like, the only other view of this is racist. And I said, ‘That sounds like racism to me.’”\n\nA change of heart\n\nFeeling pressured, Inama removed the signs, but reconsidered as the decision weighed on her into the following weekend.\n\n“I told my husband, ‘I have to put that sign back up,’” she recalls.\n\nThat Saturday, she says her husband accompanied her back to the school where she re-hung the signs and emailed her principal to let him know.\n\n“I just was not interested in taking it down,” she says. “I didn’t agree with why they were asking me to take it down. And for that reason, it was back up.”\n\nAccording to Inama, the principal warned her that her refusal constituted insubordination and could result in further action.\n\nTODAY.com has reached out to the principal for comment on Inama’s allegations but did not receive a response.\n\nA compromise\n\nA meeting was soon arranged with district personnel, including West Ada School District’s chief academic officer Marcus Myers and a West Ada Education Association representative.\n\nIn its email to TODAY.com, West Ada School District states that the meeting was arranged to “provide further clarification and support” to Inama and to “discuss concerns about the poster and how it violates Policy 401.20.” The policy says that banners in the classroom must be “content-neutral and conducive to a positive learning enviornment.”\n\nTODAY.com reached out to Myers for comment regarding the district’s decision and his role in the discussion with Inama but has not yet received a response.\n\nInama says the officials offered to purchase any alternative signs for her classroom during the meeting, just as long as they didn’t have the same messages as her current posters. Challenging the request, Inama pointed out that district policy classifies motivational posters as learning aids, which she argued should be allowed under the current rules.\n\nInama says the conversation escalated when Myers attempted to justify the request to remove her posters saying that “the political environment ebbs and flows, and what might be controversial now might not have been controversial three, six, nine months ago, and we have to follow that.”\n\nThe more the discussion continued, Inama says she became increasingly convinced that what the district was asking her to do was wrong.\n\n“The more that we talked about it, the more it just solidified,” she says. “It seems so gross what they’re asking me to compromise about. I mean, there’s no way you’ll convince me that the differing view they’re trying to protect of that sign is not racist.”\n\nShe says the meeting ended without resolution and another warning, this time that further action might be necessary if she did not comply.\n\nLegal counsel intervenes\n\nAfter their meeting, Inama says the district offered to have legal counsel review her position, but that she would have to submit an email explaining why she believed the poster did not violate policy.\n\n“I typed a big, long email and sent it off to them about why it was important for me to keep this poster up and why I don’t find it to be in violation,” Inama explains.\n\nA week later, the district responded, maintaining that the signs violated policy. Inama says she was told she has until the end of the school year to remove them.\n\nIn a statement issued to TODAY.com via email, Niki Scheppers, chief of staff for communications at West Ada School District, explains the district’s decision to enforce its policy.\n\n“West Ada School District has been and always will be committed to fostering a welcoming and supportive learning environment for all students while upholding district policies,” the statement reads.\n\n“Classrooms are places where students learn to read, write, think critically and build the skills needed for future success. While classroom decorations can contribute to the atmosphere, a truly welcoming and supportive environment is built through meaningful relationships and positive interactions between staff and students, not posters on the walls. Our focus is on fostering kindness, respect and academic achievement so that every student can thrive in a distraction-free learning environment.”\n\nAccording to the statement, approved classroom displays include the Idaho state flag, instructional materials like the periodic table or U.S. Constitution, student artwork, approved club information and school-sponsored achievements. Other permitted items include temporary displays of world flags for educational purposes, personal family photos of employees and promotional materials from colleges or professional sports teams.\n\n“This policy is designed to maintain consistency across all classrooms while ensuring that no one group is targeted or offended by the display of certain items.”\n\nThe district underlined that its policies are not intended to limit free speech but to ensure fairness in classroom materials.\n\n“While we respect individuals’ rights to express their perspectives, it is important to reaffirm that this situation is not about limiting speech or expression but about ensuring consistency in our classrooms and maintaining a learning environment free from distraction,” the statement said.\n\nThe district confirmed that legal counsel determined Inama’s poster must be removed and that she has until the end of the school year to find an alternative that complies with policy.\n\nFighting for her students, no matter the cost\n\nDespite the district’s ruling, Inama refuses to remove the signs, even if it means risking her job.\n\n“I would feel so sad to like leave my students before the end of the year, and financially, it would be difficult, but I just feel like your job, like your specific workplace, is not like your whole identity,” she explains. “There’s no way I would be able to allow myself to just take it down and roll over to what I feel like they’re asking me to do.”\n\nInama says what helps her now is knowing that she is not alone in her resistance. She says hundreds of people — including teachers across the district — have reached out to extend their support since her story became public.\n\n“I’d say at least half of them are from other teachers in this district and in some of the other districts in Idaho and in other states,” she says.\n\nAbove all, Inama says she will prioritize the students seated in her classroom and stand by what she believes to be right.",

        "content": "Nestled in a modest storefront in New York City’s East Village, Mary O’s Irish Soda Bread Shop blends into the other red-brick businesses on the block. But one thing sets it apart: Customers routinely line up, sometimes for hours, to get their hands on her freshly baked goods before they sell out.\n\nThe shop’s menu is simple, featuring Irish soda bread loaves and scones served with salty butter and fresh raspberry jam. The recipes, passed down through generations of Mary O’Halloran’s family, are at the core of her operations. But the secret to her success is precision. Only O’Halloran herself handles the batter, a non-negotiable standard she insists maintains the quality of her baked goods.\n\n“I’ve had people come and say, ‘Why don’t you have somebody come in and help you?’ It’s not going to work,” she said. “The scone does not come out the same.”\n\nMary O’Halloran mixes her next batch of soda bread batter for customers waiting in the store. NBC News\n\nMary O’s storefront in the East Village of New York. NBC News\n\nO’Halloran said the demand for her soda bread scones surges every March for St. Patrick’s Day, but her journey to success hasn’t been easy. Five years ago, O’Halloran was facing the closure of her East Village pub due to the financial strain of the Covid-19 pandemic. Her husband, a longshoreman working in Alaska, was unable to return home due to travel restrictions, leaving her to manage the business alone.\n\nMary O’Halloran’s Irish soda bread loaf. NBC News\n\nMary O’Halloran’s Irish soda bread scone served with Irish butter and fresh raspberry jam. NBC News\n\nIt was her loyal pub customers who encouraged her to start selling her scones, a treat they had grown to love. What began as a small-scale venture soon caught the attention of Brandon Stanton, the creator of the viral “Humans of New York” social media account with more than 12 million followers.\n\nAfter interviewing O’Halloran, Stanton offered to help spread the word about her scones. Reluctant at first, O’Halloran eventually agreed, leading to a spike in sales.\n\n“So I wrote a story on this, and we ended up that night selling a million dollars’ worth of scones,” Stanton told NBC News. “It is one of the greatest stories in the world.”\n\nCustomers line up inside Mary O’Halloran’s shop for scones and loaves of Irish soda bread. NBC News\n\nThe overwhelming response turned O’Halloran’s small baking operation into a community effort. Regular customers and neighbors pitched in by packing orders, printing labels and decorating boxes with handwritten notes and custom drawings from one of her daughters. Despite the surge in demand, O’Halloran remained committed to quality, handling every batch of batter herself.\n\n“Mary is where she is because that scone tastes so dang good,” Stanton said. “She would have got there without me.”\n\nIt took more than a year to fulfill the backlog of orders, but the hard work paid off. The revenue not only saved her pub, but allowed her to open Mary O’s Irish Soda Bread Shop in November 2024. Customers from around the world flock to her store to sample the viral scones and meet the woman behind the treats.\n\n“I live in Los Angeles, but they told me, you know, next time you’re in town, there’s a place we have to go, and it’s the best scone you’ve ever had. It’s the best soda bread,” out-of-towner David Murphy said.\n\nFor O’Halloran, the hard work has been worth it.\n\n“I love it, so it’s easy,” she said. “Of course I’m tired, but I love what I get from it with people. So it’s easy.”",

        "title": "How Japanese superstars are helping to revitalize baseball",
        "source": "https://www.nbcnews.com/",
        "content": "Last year’s World Series between the New York Yankees and the eventual champions, a Los Angeles Dodgers team led by Japanese phenom Shohei Ohtani, earned the best ratings in seven years. Just a year prior, the previous Fall Classic recorded its lowest viewership in television history.\n\nIt’s a dramatic turnaround that can be attributed to a number of factors, including the two large-market teams’ historic rivalry. But experts say there’s another undeniable reason for the reversal: the Japanese superstars who lit up the league. Big names like Ohtani and Dodgers starter Yoshinobu Yamamoto have helped revitalize baseball, a sport that some say has experienced waning popularity in the U.S. for some time.\n\nNow, five Japanese players are set to headline Major League Baseball’s season opener in Tokyo on Tuesday in a contest between the Dodgers and the Chicago Cubs meant to drum up interest in MLB abroad. With this milestone, historians, executives and advocates are reflecting on how these athletes have brought a new audience with them, helping make the American sport of baseball one of international appeal and ultimately helping change the face of both the game and its fans.\n\n“It’s redefining itself as the world’s best league, not as American or North American baseball, and that’s going to help itself as it expands its market to Asia,” said Rob Fitts, curatorial consultant for the Baseball Hall of Fame’s yakyu exhibit. (Yakyu is the Japanese word for baseball.)\n\nRoki Sasaki of the Los Angeles Dodgers prior to a spring training game against the San Diego Padres at Camelback Ranch in Glendale, Ariz., on Feb. 23. Norm Hall / Getty Images file\n\nA resurgence in interest in ‘America’s pastime’\n\nThe two-game Tokyo Series, which kicks off the regular season, is the first opener played in Japan since 2019. It’s part of the MLB World Tour, a slate of games the league has planned to expand its global reach. The series joins a long line of openers abroad, including in Australia and Mexico. Last year’s opener was played at the Gocheok Sky Dome in Seoul, South Korea.\n\nThis time around, it features Cubs ace Shota Imanaga and outfielder Seiya Suzuki, in addition to the Dodgers’ Ohtani, Yamamoto and rookie pitcher Roki Sasaki, a young righty whose debut is highly anticipated after his free agency dominated offseason conversations. A showdown between Imanaga and Yamamoto has already been announced for Game 1. And promotions have proliferated on social media, including a collaboration between MLB and the television series “Demon Slayer” for an anime-style short film about the evolution of Japanese baseball.\n\nFor many baseball aficionados, the Tokyo Series represents not only a homecoming for some of the game’s biggest stars, but also MLB’s expanding popularity in the region. Last year, weekly average attendance at MLB games was up around 13% and television ratings were up roughly 42%. That’s in part because of interest from Japanese fans, Chris Marinak, the league’s chief operations and strategy officer, told NBC News. Japanese tourist attendance at MLB games has more than quadrupled since 2019, and fans continue to follow games from abroad. Global viewership has increased significantly from the previous season as well, with Asia recording a 32% spike.\n\n“It’s just a tremendous growth that we’ve had in people traveling from Asia to consume baseball in the United States because they think it’s a cool experience,” Marinak said.\n\nAdam Burke, president and CEO of the Los Angeles Tourism and Convention Board, said currently about 80% to 90% of all visitors from Japan include at least one Dodgers game on their itinerary. And in 2024, the first year that Ohtani and Yamamoto spent with the Dodgers, Japanese visitation to Los Angeles grew by 26% compared to the year prior. Dodger Stadium has had to hire a number of Japanese-speaking tour guides to account for this uptick, Burke said.\n\n“People want to see where Ohtani and Yamamoto and Sasaki play, even if they’re not there that day for a game,” Burke said.\n\nAmerican baseball has struggled with relevance\n\nIt’s welcome energy for a sport that has long struggled to maintain its relevance in the U.S., experts say. In a Gallup poll conducted in December 2023, football came out on top as Americans’ favorite sport, with 41% saying it’s what they like to watch most. It eclipsed baseball as the top sport back in 1972 and has been steadily expanding its lead since. In the 2023 poll, baseball and basketball were practically tied for a distant second at 10% and 9%, respectively.\n\nOne long-standing issue has been the pace of the game, particularly compared to sports like basketball and football, Fitts said. Its more leisurely tempo has fallen out of favor with younger generations, who prefer quicker play.\n\n“Baseball is more of a long-term commitment to a team,” he added. “The games are certainly slower. One game rarely matters until you get to the playoffs.”\n\nData shows that the average length of an MLB game peaked in 2021, at 3 hours and 10 minutes. But changes like the pitch clock, instituted in 2023, are working to fix that. Last year, the average length of a game was the lowest since the mid-1980s, at 2 hours and 36 minutes.\n\nHowever, baseball has seen an uptick in interest in recent years. A 2023 survey by the Sports & Fitness Industry Association estimated that 16.7 million people participated in the sport nationwide, the highest number since the survey began in 2008.\n\nA new global crowd and the ‘Ohtani effect’\n\nNew fandoms have emerged with the introduction of elite Japanese players into MLB, said Sayuri Guthrie Shimizu, the author of “Transpacific Field of Dreams: How Baseball Linked the United States and Japan in Peace and War.” As Shimizu explained, the most recent crop of Japanese stars in particular had already enjoyed a great deal of success in Japan, amassing loyal followings during their time in Nippon Professional Baseball, Japan’s top league. Most were already considered the best in their home country. Yamamoto, for example, was a three-time most valuable player in NPB’s Pacific League and had racked up fans as a star pitcher for the Orix Buffaloes. And those supporters don’t just disappear.\n\n“There was a reservoir of fans that these players had before moving to the U.S.,” said Shimizu, a history professor at Rice University. “So these fans are going to shift their gaze to the Major League Baseball games after their hero moves to the United States.”\n\nThe interest in these Japanese players trickles into the rest of the league as well, especially since MLB games are televised in Japan, Marinak said.\n\n“Fans are more interested in the product overall. Maybe that’s accentuated by a couple star players that are really attention-grabbing, but then that gets fans bought into the storylines,” he said. “They’re interested in the trajectory of the season and the playoff chase.”\n\nThere’s also the “Ohtani effect,” Fitts said. The two-way phenom, who’s won three MVP awards and last year became the first player to reach 50 home runs and 50 stolen bases in a season, has been making his mark in the league since he debuted with the Angels in 2018. And now that he’s playing for repeat World Series contenders the Dodgers, both baseball fans and casual watchers from the U.S. and abroad don’t want to miss a chance to witness history.\n\n“Ohtani is bringing in maybe even millions of people who had very little interest in Major League Baseball,” Fitts said.\n\nBaseball’s deep history in Japan\n\nBaseball’s roots in Japan and other parts of Asia go back roughly 150 years. The country adopted the sport as it was expanding militarily and nationalism was taking hold, and as it sought to establish an image of masculinity and dominance, Fitts said. Areas that were colonized by Japan, like Korea and Taiwan, also ended up absorbing strong baseball cultures as a result of that colonial past, Shimizu added. The sport has only continued to be part of the region’s identity.\n\nWhile pitcher Masanori Murakami played a short stint with the San Francisco Giants in 1964, it was ultimately “The Tornado,” Hideo Nomo of the Dodgers, who opened the door for Japanese players to find a home in the U.S. With the help of agent Don Nomura, the pitcher utilized a loophole to secure his release from NPB’s Kintetsu Buffaloes and move over to the States. Nomo didn’t receive the same well wishes in 1995 that Ohtani and others get from their Japanese fans today, Nomura told NBC News.\n\n“He was considered a traitor along with myself,” Nomura recounted. “I had death threats. I’m sure he had some of those too.”\n\nNowadays, Shimizu said, Japanese fans pay almost as much attention to MLB as they do to NPB. And considering baseball’s struggling popularity in the U.S., she added, the league needs them.\n\nA new era for the game\n\n“Baseball, in order to survive, they have to really transnationalize itself in terms of player base and audience,” Shimizu said.\n\nMarinak said MLB is going to continue to look toward Japan as an investment focus, planning more events like the World Baseball Classic in the country and looking to expose more kids to the U.S. league. It’s all with the aim of growing the game, developing players and creating the “next generation of stars,” he said.\n\nNomura said that with the growing interest in Japan’s top talent, he hopes MLB doesn’t just use Japan or Asia for financial gain, and instead gives back to the youth there beyond its baseball programs. Still, he said, watching the sport evolve from being seen as an American game to an international one is a good thing. After all, it’s always been about revolution, he said.\n\n“You have Jackie Robinson, who changed the color of the game. Then you have [Fernando] Valenzuela, who changed the border of the game. Then you have Hideo Nomo make it into an internationalization of the game,” Nomura said. “There has been a shift of ballplayers migrating to another country and helping their original country by expanding the game of baseball.”",

        "title": "How Trump united Canada against him and flipped its election upside down",
        "source": "https://www.nbcnews.com/",
        "content": "The hostility extends to homegrown Trump supporters such as Canadian hockey legend Wayne Gretzky, who was at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort on election night and attended his inauguration. This week, viral photos from a Toronto liquor store showed labels under Gretzky’s wine range altered to include descriptions such as “weak & backstabbery.”\n\nFormer Prime Minister Jean Chrétien said Trump had “united us as never before.”\n\n“I think I will propose him for the Order of Canada,” the country’s highest civilian honor, Chrétien joked as the governing Liberal Party met in Ottawa last weekend to elect a successor to Canada’s leader of almost a decade, the highly unpopular Justin Trudeau.\n\nExperts say the man they overwhelmingly chose, Mark Carney, may be uniquely positioned to push back against Trump’s aggression, with a background in finance and crisis management that includes running the Bank of Canada after the 2008 global financial crisis and the Bank of England during the Brexit process.\n\nLike Trump, Carney, who took office as prime minister on Friday, spent much of his life in the private sector and had never held elected office before becoming his country’s leader.\n\n“He’s been sort of the global elite all his life,” Malloy said. “Normally, that’s not really the route for success for a rookie politician. But these are unusual times.”\n\n‘Resurrected from the dead’\n\nOnly a few months ago, the Liberals under Trudeau were looking like “absolute toast” in the next Canadian election, which is required to take place by October of this year, Malloy said.\n\nWith his approval rating already at an all-time low, Trudeau’s problems were only compounded by Trump’s tariff threats, which began shortly after he was elected in November.\n\nInternal disagreement over how to respond to those threats created turmoil among the Liberals, with Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland’s scathing resignation letter in December ultimately forcing Trudeau to announce he would step down.\n\nMark Carney was sworn in as Canada’s new prime minister on Friday. Artur Widak / NurPhoto via Getty Images\n\nIt seemed almost certain the Liberals would be thrashed in the next election by the Conservative Party, led by Pierre Poilievre.\n\nPoilievre, whose style has been described as “Trump light,” had embraced the populist wing of his party, expressing support for truckers who paralyzed Ottawa with anti-vaccine protests in 2022. Among his supporters was Elon Musk.\n\nThen Trump happened.\n\nOn his first day in office, Trump announced a 25% tariff on imports from Canada and Mexico, two of the biggest U.S. trading partners. Those tariffs were paused for a month before going into effect on March 4. Markets immediately began convulsing, and in the days that followed, Trump exempted more than a third of goods coming from Canada until April 2.\n\nTrump said he was imposing the tariffs on Canada and Mexico because of their role in the U.S. fentanyl crisis and illegal immigration, mystifying Canadians who point to the U.S. government’s own data showing that Canada is responsible for less than 1% of the fentanyl and undocumented migrants coming across the northern and southern U.S. borders.\n\nCanada is also subject to the 25% U.S. tariff on steel and aluminum imports that took effect globally on Wednesday.\n\nOttawa responded to those tariffs with its own levies on some $21 billion worth of U.S. goods, and it has also requested a dispute consultation at the World Trade Organization.\n\nAlongside the tariffs, Trump has repeatedly referred to Trudeau as the “governor” of Canada, which with 40 million people has about the same population as California.\n\nTrump’s derision continued on Thursday even as his secretary of state, Marco Rubio, made his first official trip to Canada for a meeting of top diplomats from the Group of Seven industrialized democracies.\n\n“To be honest with you, Canada only works as a state,” Trump said from the Oval Office.\n\nAsked about the issue on Friday, Rubio said it had not come up at the G7 meeting but that there was a “disagreement” between Trump’s position and the position of the Canadian government.\n\nCanadian Foreign Minister Mélanie Joly said she told Rubio that “Canada’s sovereignty is not up to debate.”\n\n“You’re in our country, you respect our people. Period,” she said at a news conference after the meeting in La Malbaie, Quebec.\n\nFueled by anger at Trump, Canadians have expressed growing support for the Liberals in the upcoming election, almost entirely closing the gap with the Conservatives in a matter of weeks. The Conservatives, who had a lead of almost 20 points a month ago, are now ahead by only 1 percentage point, the Canadian polling firm Nanos said this week.\n\n“The Liberals have basically been resurrected from the dead” because of the crisis Trump created, Malloy said.\n\nAs Carney took office on Friday, he rejected Trump’s statehood proposal, saying “America is not Canada.”\n\n“We will never, ever, in any way, shape or form, be part of the United States,” Carney, who turns 60 on Sunday, said after being sworn in.\n\nU.S. liquor products have been pulled from store shelves in Vancouver and elsewhere. Chris Helgren / Reuters\n\nThough Carney is a novice politician, that could work in his favor, said Maite Gonzalez Latorre, a program assistant at the Atlantic Council in Washington who is from Edmonton, Alberta.\n\n“Mark Carney has experience in the U.K., he has experience in Canada, but he also has private sector experience,” Gonzalez Latorre said, “which I think will give him an advantage, especially when it comes to tariffs and and speaking with Trump directly.”\n\nCarney’s top concerns for the moment, she said, are how to deal with Trump and how the U.S. tariffs are going to affect Canadians. His next moves and Trump’s response to them will influence when Carney calls the election, which could still end in victory for the Conservatives.\n\nAs with so many of Trump’s policies and actions, Malloy said, it remains unclear what exactly he is trying to achieve with his antagonism toward Canada.\n\nHis actions may have sidelined a potential ally in Poilievre, “who would have been a relatively supportive leader,” Malloy said. And though he took down Trudeau, Trump also revived the fortunes of Trudeau’s party, which is staunchly opposed to his policies.\n\n“What is Mr. Trump’s endgame other than chaos? And what’s the point?” Malloy said. “Because so far, he’s only doing things that hurt his interests and the interests of the United States.”",

        "source": "https://www.nbcnews.com/",
        "content": "Nationwide protests are planned this weekend after Mahmoud Khalil, a former Columbia University student activist, was arrested by immigration authorities, fueling tensions between the Trump administration and student movements over immigration policy.\n\nKhalil, 30, was taken into custody by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents in the middle of the night last weekend, prompting outrage in recent days. Khalil, an Algerian citizen of Palestinian descent, helped lead pro-Palestinian demonstrations at Columbia University last spring.\n\nProtests calling for his release will be held in cities including New York City, Boston, Phoenix, Charlotte, Oklahoma City, Miami and Indianapolis on Saturday and Sunday.\n\nSeveral dozen protestors gathered in Times Square on Saturday afternoon, wearing traditional Palestinian scarfs, known as kuffiyehs, and waving Palestinian flags.\n\n\"Release Mahmoud right now!\" the protestors shouted.\n\nGrant Miner, the former president of a union representing thousands of Columbia student workers who were fired and expelled this week, addressed the crowd. He described Mahmoud's detention as \"a campaign of fear.\"\n\n\"We must stand up together to tell Trump and his billionaire buddies that we’re not going to stand for this intimidation and the backsliding of civil rights in this country,\" he said.\n\nTo justify Khalil’s arrest, the Trump administration cited an obscure foreign-policy clause that allows the federal government to deport foreign nationals whom it deems national security threats. The Department of Homeland Security alleges that Khalil “led activities aligned to Hamas, a designated terrorist organization.”\n\nMahmoud Khalil stands by the gates of Columbia University on April 30, 2024. Olivia Falcigno / USA Today Network file\n\nOn Monday, a federal judge temporarily blocked the Trump administration from expelling Khalil, a legal permanent resident, from the country as he challenges his deportation.\n\nKhalil filed an amended petition and complaint in federal district court in Manhattan on Thursday, stating he was the target of “retaliatory detention and attempted removal of a student protestor because of his constitutionally protected speech.” Khalil finished his classes at Columbia in December 2024 and was expected to graduate in the spring, according to the filing.\n\nImmigration authorities are holding the 30-year-old in Louisiana and his lawyers have petitioned for him to be returned to New York City. His wife, an American, is eight months pregnant.\n\n“I urge you to see Mahmoud through my eyes as a loving husband and the future father to our baby,” she said in a statement through Khalil’s defense counsel on Monday. “I need your help to bring Mahmoud home, so he is here beside me, holding my hand in the delivery room as we welcome our first child into this world.”\n\nTrump administration targets campus protesters\n\nKhalil’s arrest marks the first attempt to fulfill President Donald Trump’s campaign pledge to deport international students who protested in support of Palestinians on campuses across the country last spring.\n\nOn Tuesday, a doctoral student from India whom DHS accused of supporting Hamas self-deported to Canada. And on Friday, another Palestinian student who took part in Columbia’s protests last year, identified by DHS as Leqaa Kordia, was arrested for allegedly overstaying her student visa.\n\n“It is a privilege to be granted a visa to live and study in the United States of America,” DHS Secretary Kristi Noem said in a statement on Friday. “When you advocate for violence and terrorism that privilege should be revoked, and you should not be in this country.”\n\nDHS agents also raided two Columbia dormitories on Thursday evening, but made no arrests, according to a statement by the university. Commenting on the raids on Friday, Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said the Justice Department was “looking at whether Columbia’s handling of earlier incidents violated civil rights laws and included terrorism crimes.”\n\nCivil rights groups and protesters have denounced the federal government’s actions at Columbia as an infringement on free speech. Protesters staged demonstrations this week at both the university and inside Trump Tower, located in Manhattan.\n\nColumbia’s international students have expressed fear, with several telling NBC News on Friday that they are increasingly hesitant to criticize the Trump administration due to fears of repercussions.\n\nThe university’s journalism school said its staff and students are “witnessing and experiencing an alarming chill.”\n\n“One does not have to agree with the political opinions of any particular individual to understand that these threats cut to the core of what it means to live in a pluralistic democracy,” the journalism school said in a statement issued Friday. “The use of deportation to suppress foreign critics runs parallel to an aggressive campaign to use libel laws in novel — even outlandish ways — to silence or intimidate the independent press.”\n\nColumbia University in the glaring spotlight\n\nThe arrests are part of the Trump administration’s broader effort to “root out” what it calls “anti-Semitic harassment in schools and on college campuses.” And perhaps no other college campus in the country drew more attention for its pro-Palestinian demonstrations last year than Columbia.\n\nFor weeks last spring, student activists staged daily protests, occupied a university building and established an encampment of several dozen tents on university lawns, inspiring similar setups on college campuses across the country. Fueled by outrage over Israel’s war in Gaza, students pushed for their universities to divest from companies linked to the Israeli government. The activism sparked intense debates on campuses, with some students expressing concerns over antisemitism.\n\nIn the week before the arrests, the Trump administration singled out Columbia, announcing that it would cancel approximately $400 million in federal grants to the university. The administration cited “the school’s continued inaction in the face of persistent harassment of Jewish students.”\n\nThe move marked an unprecedented intervention by the federal government into the affairs of a private university.\n\nColumbia responded by pledging to work with the federal government to restore its funding.\n\n“We take Columbia’s legal obligations seriously and understand how serious this announcement is and are committed to combatting antisemitism and ensuring the safety and wellbeing of our students, faculty, and staff,” a university spokesperson told NBC News last week.\n\nOn Thursday, the university said it suspended or expelled some of the students who participated and temporarily revoked the diplomas of some graduates.\n\n\"I’m not surprised that the university is choosing to throw its students and workers under the bus for grant money,\" Miner told NBC News. \"We know exactly how much now it costs, to buy Columbia’s morals.\"",

        "content": "Federal agents arrested a Palestinian student who had taken part in protests at Columbia University last spring and had overstayed her student visa, officials said Friday.\n\nThe student, identified by the Department of Homeland Security as Leqaa Kordia, a Palestinian from the West Bank, was previously arrested for her participation in the protests. Her visa was terminated in January 2022 for lack of attendance, officials said.\n\nHer arrest by immigration officers from the Newark, New Jersey, field office follows the self-deportation on Tuesday of a Columbia doctoral student from India, Ranjani Srinivasan, whom DHS accused of supporting Hamas. The State Department had revoked her visa a week earlier.\n\n“It is a privilege to be granted a visa to live and study in the United States of America,” DHS Secretary Kristi Noem said in a statement. “When you advocate for violence and terrorism that privilege should be revoked, and you should not be in this country.”\n\nThe latest arrest comes as students at Columbia say they are fearful that they and their friends could be unjustly targeted amid a tense climate on campus, hours after federal agents executed search warrants on two university residences.\n\nTodd Blanche, U.S. deputy attorney general, said Friday that the Justice Department is working with DHS as part of an investigation into Columbia's \"harboring and concealing illegal aliens on its campus.\"\n\nWhile school officials told students that no arrests were made and no items seized when DHS agents entered two student rooms on Thursday night, foreign students remained on edge.\n\nThe Ivy League’s campus in upper Manhattan has seen renewed demonstrations in recent days following the arrest Saturday of Mahmoud Khalil, a Columbia graduate student and legal permanent resident who was publicly involved in negotiations during last year’s school protests.\n\nMany students approached by NBC News declined to comment, but some who agreed to speak asked not to be named for fear of government retaliation.\n\n\"This is exactly what I was worried about months ago,\" said an engineering student from the United Kingdom who participated in pro-Palestinian demonstrations last spring over the war in Gaza. The student said he was worried about campus raids and other potential intervention by the federal government.\n\n\"It's also like, you don't know the scope of the people they're trying to target because thousands of students were involved in this in some capacity. It would have been on camera,\" the student said, adding, \"Logically nothing is going to happen to me, but it's stressful.\"\n\nColumbia’s American students are rallying around their international counterparts as well after the federal agents searched the two student residences.\n\nAnother student, who is American, said she was \"shocked\" when she read the email from Katrina Armstrong, Columbia's interim president, informing students that DHS had served the university with judicial search warrants signed by a federal magistrate judge.\n\n\"It is pretty frightening. The school is doing everything in their power to do their best to keep students safe, but I think there’s a limit to what they're able to do,\" the student, a junior, said. \"Last night was evidence of that limit.\"\n\nSebastian Javadpoor, 22, said he was \"overcome with rage\" upon the latest search warrants.\n\nJavadpoor, who leads the university's student-led Democratic club, said he and about a dozen other student leaders met with school officials to convey their fears.\n\n\"We have students who are so scared about the possibility of retaliation, about the possibility of having ICE reported on them, that they're too afraid to call public safety if something happens to them,\" he said. \"They're too afraid to call NYPD. They're too afraid to even seek support and services from the administration itself.\"\n\nImmigration and Customs Enforcement agents arrested Khalil as part of an effort to revoke his green card and deport him, his lawyers said. Khalil, 30, an Algerian citizen and pro-Palestinian activist, is married to a U.S. citizen and was arrested at his university-owned residential building.\n\n“The Secretary of State has determined that your presence or activities in the United States would have serious adverse foreign policy consequences for the United States,” the Department of Homeland Security stated in a document obtained by NBC News.\n\nHe is currently being held at a detention facility in Louisiana, where government officials want him to remain. His lawyers argue that he should be returned to New York and that the administration’s actions violate the First Amendment.\n\nKhalil's removal from campus came days after the Trump administration announced that it would cancel approximately $400 million in federal grants to the university \"due to the school's continued inaction in the face of persistent harassment of Jewish students.\"\n\nThe administration says the school must make sweeping policy changes, including a ban on masks \"intended to conceal identity or intimidate others,\" and allowing for \"full law enforcement authority, including arrest and removal of agitators.\" Columbia has said it would work with the administration to ensure funding continues and is \"committed to combating antisemitism and ensuring the safety and wellbeing of our students, faculty and staff.\"\n\nA DHS spokesperson has said Khalil's arrest was in coordination with ICE and the State Department \"in support of President Trump's executive orders prohibiting anti-Semitism\" because Khalil \"led activities aligned to Hamas, a designated terrorist organization.\"\n\nHis arrest was only the latest action to roil the campus after the last school year, when student protesters occupied Hamilton Hall, leading to dozens of arrests for trespassing. While nearly all of the related charges were eventually dropped, the school on Thursday said it has suspended or expelled some of the students who participated and temporarily revoked some diplomas of those who graduated.\n\nOn Friday, dozens of police barricades surrounded the university's main entrance. The university gates that once remained open to all New Yorkers were locked shut as students flashed their badges to get to class, shuffling past police officers, news cameras and flocks of campus security.\n\nSome students participated in a walk out Friday afternoon in response to Khalil's arrest and the student sanctions.\n\nUniversity leaders want to unify the faculty — and potentially some students — by focusing discussions on how Columbia can best defend the school's independence in the face of unprecedented pressure from the Trump administration, as it cracks down on certain international students who engaged in pro-Palestinian protests that swept college campuses.\n\nSome faculty members feel that the Trump administration's demand that Columbia changes how the university operates goes too far and involves core prerogatives of the university. They hope to use this moment to spark a discussion of what the university stands for.\n\n“How do we prevent the university from being divided?” an administrator, who asked not to be named because they weren’t authorized to speak publicly, said about the mood among university faculty and staff. “People are more oriented toward what we need to do to defend the university.”\n\nA graduate student from India said she wanted to join student-led protests over Khalil's removal from campus in recent days, but feared doing so also could put her student visa in jeopardy.\n\n\"Your free speech is curtailed. As students, you should be having those kind of rights, but you don’t,” the 29-year-old said. “You know what’s going on, you do want to speak out, but as an international student, you’re in a tough position, right?\"",

        "content": "Before President Trump chastised Gov. Janet Mills of Maine at the White House last month, and before his administration started investigating Maine’s education system, the seeds of their conflict over transgender athletes had been planted by a state legislator.\n\nRepresentative Laurel Libby, a Republican from Auburn, Maine, had posted on Facebook about a transgender athlete who won a high school pole-vaulting competition. Her critical post, which named and included photos of the student athlete, went viral.\n\nAbout a month later, the fallout has included funding cuts at the University of Maine and a finding by the Trump administration that the state had violated federal law by allowing transgender athletes to compete on two high school teams. The Democratic-controlled Legislature has censured Ms. Libby. And people on both sides of the issue have experienced a complex surge of emotions about Maine suddenly landing in the cross hairs of Mr. Trump.\n\n“We’re not often in the center of controversy here, and it’s a little bit of a shock that it’s happened so quickly,” said Keegan Tripp, a junior at the University of Maine and the president of its student body. “We have students afraid for themselves, for their friends — their academics, research, financial situations — and all of this fear is so brand-new.”",

The center has honored a broad spectrum of artists and performers, including Lucille Ball, Dolly Parton, Clint Eastwood, Fred Astaire and the Grateful Dead.",

        "content": "President Trump’s executive order on Saturday invoking the Alien Enemies Act targeted Venezuelan citizens 14 years and older with ties to the transnational gang Tren de Aragua, saying they “are liable to be apprehended, restrained, secured, and removed as Alien Enemies.”\n\nMr. Trump’s order was quickly challenged in court, but the gang has been a growing source of concern for U.S. officials over the last year. The Biden administration labeled Tren de Aragua a transnational criminal organization in 2024, the New York Police Department has highlighted its activity on the East Coast, and the Trump White House began the process of designating it a foreign terrorist organization in January.\n\nHere is what we know about the gang:\n\nA rising force out of Venezuela\n\nTren de Aragua (Train of Aragua, or Aragua Train) has roots in Tocorón prison in Venezuela’s northern Aragua state, which the group’s leaders had transformed into a mini-city with a pool, restaurants and a zoo. They reportedly recorded executions and torture there to maintain control over other prisoners.\n\nAs Venezuela’s economy collapsed and its government under President Nicolás Maduro became more repressive, the group began exploiting vulnerable migrants. Tren de Aragua’s influence soon stretched into other parts of Latin America, and it developed into one of the region’s most violent and notorious criminal organizations, focusing on sex trafficking, human smuggling and drugs.",

        "source": "https://www.nytimes.com/",
        "content": "It represents a shift after a quarter-century of an F.B.I. run under a structure put in place by Robert S. Mueller III after the Sept. 11 attacks. The model was established to address administrative lapses and bolster efforts to deter terrorism. In Mr. Patel’s iteration, he has appointed a total of five branch directors, eliminating the executive assistant directors who previously managed the F.B.I. on a daily basis.\n\nThe announced changes were not unexpected, as Mr. Patel has already moved to reduce the number of F.B.I. employees working at headquarters and push them into the field, making good on a pledge he made before becoming director. His efforts have drawn praise from President Trump.\n\nThe swift decision to alter the hierarchy of the F.B.I. comes just weeks after Mr. Patel was confirmed, raising questions among former and current agents about the thoroughness of the plan. In particular, they said, they worried that the changes could result in less coordination between field offices and create intelligence gaps. Still, even former senior executives skeptical of Mr. Patel’s leadership and relative lack of experience believe the new model, while imperfect, could be an improvement and certainly reduce the deputy director’s immense responsibilities.\n\nIn theory, the move could help the new deputy director, Dan Bongino, who has never worked for the F.B.I. and has a limited understanding of its complex and global operations, transition into an important role that has traditionally been filled by a senior agent. The changes could free him up more to handle domestic and international investigative and intelligence activities, among other things. The previous deputy director had dozens of direct reports, including all the top agents in the field.\n\nHow Mr. Patel came up with his plan so quickly is not exactly clear, but he has been relying on a newly established group of former agents, known as the director advisory team, for guidance. But those agents are long retired and only one had reached the senior ranks.",

At least one senior Houthi commander was targeted. The Biden administration conducted several strikes against the Houthis but largely failed to restore stability to the region.\n\nU.S. officials said the bombardment, the most significant military action of Mr. Trump’s second term so far, was also meant to send a warning signal to Iran.

There were the spires of Hogwarts at Universal Studios. There was the 101 freeway, flowing steadily in both directions. There was the Hollywood sign, presiding over a slope of trees and scrub.\n\nDepending on the direction of the wind, Connelly said, you could smell smoke from a wildfire in Malibu. Then, with his Chihuahua mix, Pinto, in quick pursuit, he led the way through his kitchen and family room to the office where he starts writing at 5 or 6 every morning.\n\n“The sun comes up over those mountains,” Connelly said, pointing over a shelf of his own hardcovers to a window framing yet another coniferous view. “I just love that moment. It gives me the feeling that I’m the only one awake in the city.”\n\nConnelly, 68, has written 40 books, including a slew of No. 1 best sellers, and sold over 89 million copies worldwide. He’s the executive producer of “The Lincoln Lawyer” on Netflix and “Bosch” and “Bosch: Legacy” on Amazon. (“Bosch: Legacy” begins its third and final season on March 27.) He’s also a podcaster. Oh, and he has two novels planned for 2025 — “Nightshade,” coming out on May 20, introduces a new detective — plus another Amazon show, “Ballard,” launching this summer.",

        "content": "In conversation with Page, Schulman explained that the speech was approved by Kelly’s partner and friends and delivered in the spirit of the political funerals during the thick of the AIDS pandemic; she wanted to dispel the fantasy of suicide as any kind of solution. She took questions from those in the audience who had felt wounded or angered. What’s striking in the transcript is the lack of defensiveness on the part of Schulman, who might have felt unfairly criticized (most of her critics had not even known Kelly), or those who objected to the language of the eulogy. Emotions were not used as excuses to escalate the conflict or leave it entirely; instead, the people in the room seem to move closer together.\n\n“The emergence of conflict does not have to mean that someone is bad or to blame,’’ Spade counsels in “Mutual Aid,” “and the more we can normalize conflict, the more likely we can address it and come through it stronger, rather than burning out and leaving the group or the movement and/or causing damage to others.”He offers some practical strategies, including: “Remember, no one made us feel this way, but we are having strong feelings, and they deserve our caring attention.”\n\nThis, I must admit, is much of the same language I use with my toddler. Are we so lost that we need such instruction? It can seem comical, but where do we see conflict modeled well? Not skirted or turned incendiary? Such modeling is so rare that I remember specific instances — for example, the dialogue between James Baldwin and Audre Lorde printed in Essence magazine in 1984. “Jimmy, we don’t have an argument,” Lorde says. “I know we don’t,” Baldwin responds, to which she replies, “But what we do have is a real disagreement.” They do not allow each other to find false commonalities or to cocoon themselves in injury away from finding, even provisionally, a common language. At the crux of their conversation is how to speak of the differences between them — openly, productively and without a sense of competition. “Truly dealing with how we live, recognizing each other’s differences, is something that hasn’t happened,” Lorde tells Baldwin. “When we deal with sameness only, we develop weapons that we use against each other when the differences become apparent. And we wipe each other out — Black men and women can wipe each other out — far more effectively than outsiders do.”\n\nIt’s tempting to attempt a thesis here, to tie the decline of social endurance or conflict endurance to social media, perhaps, or the pandemic. In their new book, “Conflict Resilience,” the legal scholar Robert Bordone and the neurologist Joel Salinas make a case that our social muscles are profoundly atrophied. Bordone, who negotiates conflicts between corporations and governments, describes being increasingly called in to oversee conflicts among ordinary people and families who could not resolve even minor differences. The authors offer case studies and simple tips to develop conflict endurance, of holding discomfort in the body: “Building muscle for conflict holding, like building muscle for your arms, quads or calves, is a process, not a one-and-done event.”\n\nHave we gone from a world of no-contact deliveries to a world where familial disagreements increasingly go the “no-contact” route, where there is an “epidemic of estrangement,” in the name of avoiding conflict and pain? But to read these accounts of solidarity is to realize that these calls have been part of every era, every movement.",

        "content": "“The system has been in place for 100 years. It’s not going to change overnight,” said Michael Ketchmark, the lawyer who represented the Missouri homeowners. “It’s not like one day we started streaming movies and then Blockbuster video stores were suddenly gone. It was a slow progressive change in technology and that’s what we’re witnessing here.”\n\nMany agents say that since the settlement, they’ve felt cornered by buyers and sellers alike to defend their value. Jeremy Larsen, a Realtor in Dallas, said that consumers who decide to navigate the home market without an agent are taking huge risks with their money.\n\n“It’s like walking into a courtroom without an attorney. Why would you do that? There’s so many possible things that can go wrong,” he said.\n\nSellers who want to sell homes on their own “can sit on Zillow all day long,” he said, but he believes that without the guidance of an agent, most of them would price their home too low or falter in negotiations. And buyers looking for a mortgage may not choose the right lender.\n\n“It’s such a critical purchase for people, and there’s not someone in your corner,” he said.\n\nOne viral Instagram video, created last month by a Realtor in Fresno, Calif., with 114,000 followers, shows a man driving down a suburban cul-de-sac and encountering a seller’s agent standing outside a house for sale with a sign that reads “0 percent” — referring to the amount of commissions the sellers were willing to pay any agent who brought a buyer.",

        "content": "Confused, she emailed Columbia’s office for international students the following day seeking guidance. An official informed her that the revocation would take effect only if she left the country and that she could remain in the United States to pursue her studies for the time being, according to emails reviewed by The Times.\n\nThe next morning, on March 7, Ms. Srinivasan was on a call with an official from the international student office when the federal agents first knocked on the door of her apartment, which is off campus but operated by Columbia. The official told Ms. Srinivasan to call campus security, while her roommate engaged with the agents from behind the closed apartment door.\n\nIn an interview, her roommate said that the agents had initially identified themselves as “police,” declined to provide their badge numbers, saying they feared they would be doxxed, and stood to the side of the door so that they were not visible through the peep hole. The roommate, a fellow Columbia student who spoke on the condition of anonymity out of fear for her safety, said that the building’s doorman, who is an immigrant, later told her that he had let the three agents into the building because he was frightened.\n\nMs. Srinivasan abandoned the apartment that night, so she was not there when officials returned the following evening. Her roommate once again refused to open the door to let them in and recorded audio of the interaction, which she shared with The Times.\n\n“We were here yesterday,” one of the officials says, believing he was talking to Ms. Srinivasan because the roommate had not identified herself. “We’re here today. We’re here tonight. Tomorrow. You’re probably scared. If you are, I get it. The reality is, your visa was revoked. You are now amenable to removal proceedings.”",

        "source": "https://www.nytimes.com/",
        "content": "When a political leader wants to move a democracy toward a more authoritarian form of government, he often sets out to undermine independent sources of information and accountability. The leader tries to delegitimize judges, sideline autonomous government agencies and muzzle the media. President Vladimir Putin of Russia has done so over the past quarter-century. To lesser degrees, Prime Minister Viktor Orban of Hungary, Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India and President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey recently have as well.\n\nThe weakening of higher education tends to be an important part of this strategy. Academic researchers are supposed to pursue the truth, and budding autocrats recognize that empirical truth can present a threat to their authority. “Wars are won by teachers,” Mr. Putin has said. He and Mr. Erdogan have closed universities. Mr. Modi’s government has arrested dissident scholars, and Mr. Orban has appointed loyal foundations to run universities.\n\nPresident Trump has not yet gone as far to impede democracy as these other leaders, but it would be naïve to ignore his early moves to mimic their approach. He has fired government watchdogs, military leaders, prosecutors and national security experts. He has sued media organizations, and his administration has threatened to regulate others. He has suggested that judges are powerless to check his authority, writing on social media, “He who saves his Country does not violate any Law.”\n\nMr. Trump’s multifaceted campaign against higher education is core to this effort to weaken institutions that do not parrot his version of reality. Above all, he is enacting or considering major cuts to universities’ resources. The Trump administration has announced sharp reductions in the federal payments that cover the overhead costs of scientific research, such as laboratory rent, electricity and hazardous waste disposal. (A federal judge has issued a temporary restraining order against those cuts.) Vice President JD Vance and other Republicans have urged a steep increase of a university endowment tax that Mr. Trump signed during his first term. Together, these two policies could reduce the annual budgets at some research universities by more than 10 percent.",

        "content": "In the summer of 1993, the movie “Free Willy” — about a captive killer whale that’s heroically set free — was an unexpected hit. But when word got out that the real whale who played Willy, an orca named Keiko, was dangerously sick and stuck in a tiny pool at an amusement park in Mexico City, the public was outraged. If Warner Bros. wanted to avoid a P.R. nightmare and not break the hearts of children everywhere, then it was clear: Someone had to free Keiko — or at least try.\n\nKeiko was hardly an ideal candidate for release. He’d lived in the care of humans for more than a decade, since he was a calf. He had millions of human fans but not a single orca friend. And he had missed out on uncountable lessons about how to live in the ocean — skills no trainer in the world knew how to teach.\n\n“The Good Whale” tells the story of the wildly ambitious science experiment to return Keiko to the ocean — while the world watched. An epic tale that starts in Mexico and ends in Norway, the six-episode series follows Keiko as he’s transported from country to country, each time landing in the hands of well-intentioned people who believe they know what’s best for him — people who still disagree, decades later, about whether they did the right thing.",

        "content": "French Champagne producers do nearly a billion dollars’ worth of business with the United States every year. But on Friday in Épernay, the world capital of sparkling wine, the only number on anybody’s lips was 200.\n\nThat was the percent tariff that President Trump has threatened to impose on Champagne and other European wines and spirits exported to the United States, in a trade war that exploded this past week after the European Union countered Mr. Trump’s penalties on steel and aluminum with its own duties on American products.\n\nThe triple-digit menace landed like a thunderbolt in Épernay, rattling workers in nearby fields, producers in small villages and the venerable houses that line the Avenue de Champagne, Épernay’s central boulevard and a UNESCO Heritage site that oozes tasteful wealth.\n\n“A 200 percent tariff is designed to make sure that no Champagne will be shipped to the United States,” said Calvin Boucher, a manager at Michel Gonet, a 225-year-old Champagne house on the avenue. With 20 to 30 percent of the 200,000 bottles it makes yearly exported to American wine merchants and restaurants, “that business would be crushed,” he said, adding that the price of a $125 Champagne would more than triple overnight.",

        "content": "Ana Sofía, 33\n\nI knew I would have some kind of baggage around sex due to my previous relationship, but I didn’t quite know how it would manifest\n\nAlfredo and I got together after my previous (seven-year) relationship was coming to an explosive end. We had just been friends but it wasn’t long before we became an item. I’d dreamed of sleeping with millions of people as soon as I became single, but it didn’t turn out that way. I only slept with one other person before this became an exclusive thing. And I think that’s due to the sex I was having with Alfredo.\n\nIt was really exciting because I’d been in a fairly sexless entanglement that had brought me down mentally. So to be out of that and sleeping with someone who was actually interested in me was so refreshing. He was so attentive – I’d never had someone go down on me so much before in my life. It was amazing.\n\nI knew I would have some kind of baggage around sex due to my previous relationship, but I didn’t know how it would manifest. Alfredo and I have now been together for three years, we live together, so things have slowed down, though we make sure to have sex at least once a week. I’ve noticed that I’ve lost that initial burst of confidence I had, which I think is a hangover from my previous relationship.\n\nI have a fear of doing things wrong, that it will push him away and make him not want to have sex with me\n\nI have a fear of doing things wrong; that it will push him away and make him not want to have sex with me. This stems from my own insecurities, but there has been the odd time he’s said something unintentionally that’s made me feel self-conscious, like when he said he didn’t like blowjobs. I’m trying to work out if he means mine specifically or blowjobs in general. He’s said it’s the latter, but I can’t help feeling it’s me, which is a bit stressful.\n\nBut he also has his own insecurities. When we have penetrative sex, he usually climaxes before me, sometimes after a few minutes. He’s so considerate with his hands and tongue that it’s never been an issue. There’s have only been a couple of times where I’ve thought: I really fancy more today, so it’s a shame he’s already finished.\n\nWe’ve now got to the point where we both want to develop things in the bedroom, experiment and just try to have the best sex we can.\n\nAlfredo, 32\n\nNow that I have sex consistently, it’s like it’s fallen down on my priority list, because in theory we can have sex whenever we want\n\nAna Sofía is my first girlfriend. At the beginning it was extremely exciting. Her previous relationship had recently ended so I assumed that she wouldn’t want to get into something straight away, and that our sex life might end at any point. I think that elevated the sex and our desire.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Inside Saturday Free weekly newsletter The only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

I’ve noticed that now we have sex consistently and whenever we want, it has fallen down my priority list. Now that I have it, I need it less. The fact that things have slowed down is not a problem because, in the end, I’m still having more sex than ever before. If you boil it down to numbers, I’m still winning.\n\nI never thought that climaxing too early would be an issue of mine. But it happens sometimes\n\nThe biggest challenge is the expectation of my prowess. I never thought climaxing too early would be an issue. But it happens sometimes and I think that was because alcohol or other drugs – which can delay ejaculation – were often a social lubricant when I was single. Now Ana Sofía and I mainly have sober sex. It’s not a big problem as there are ways around it. I try to do things to control quick release like counting how many deep thrusts I do in comparison with shallow ones. I used to try thinking about other things, but I’ve stopped that because sometimes my mind really does just go elsewhere. Once I realised I’d forgotten to take the bins out, which I then said out loud while we were still having sex.\n\nBut I think the main way we get around it is foreplay. I try to ensure that Ana Sofía has at least one orgasm. That’s really important to me. When I was a teenager I read a book called She Comes First about the importance of women climaxing first. All the sex education I’d previously had was just about the very functional ways of sex. So from this I learned about the importance of cunnilingus and all these other ways of pleasuring women. That for me was an early eye-opener.",

        "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/",
        "content": "It was a welcome to Florida that Andrew Tate was not expecting, far less the warm embrace he believed he was entitled to.\n\nThe controversial influencer, an accused rapist and human trafficker, walked straight into a state criminal investigation after descending the steps of the private aircraft that flew him and his brother Tristan from Romania last month, inducing a fit of apoplexy in Tate that appears to be still raging two weeks on.\n\nSince their arrival in the US, the Tates have crisscrossed the country in search of attention elsewhere, popping up in Las Vegas at the weekend at a mixed martial arts festival where they were hugged by a close friend of Donald Trump, and in Los Angeles on Monday, where they preened in the front row of a press conference for the boxer Ryan Garcia.\n\nBut their troubles in Florida have never left their mind. Tate’s X account has featured a near constant stream of conspiracy theories and vitriol directed at those he blames for his situation, including Florida’s Republican governor, Ron DeSantis, and attorney general, James Uthmeier.\n\nDeSantis has said the brothers’ brand of toxic masculinity was “not welcome” in his state, while Uthmeier, who has called their alleged behavior “atrocious”, warned the Tates that “fleeing our jurisdiction will not stop Florida’s ongoing criminal investigation”.\n\nIn a post on X, Uthmeier wrote: “We will continue working with our law enforcement and partners around the world to fight human trafficking and sexual abuse”.\n\nJoseph McBride, the Tates’ attorney, told the Guardian in a statement that the Florida investigation was “a weak attempt by a lame-duck governor to hold on to power and an unknown attorney general aiming to build his reputation”, and that Uthmeier’s comments were “malicious and defamatory”.\n\nBoth Tates, who are dual US-UK citizens, continue to deny allegations against them in Romania, which include human trafficking, rape of a minor and forming a criminal gang to sexually exploit women. Travel restrictions following their 2022 arrest were lifted last month amid speculation of a “secret deal” between prosecutors and the Trump administration.\n\nThe US president’s son, Donald Trump Jr, has previously called their detention in Romania “absolute insanity”, while Trump himself denied any knowledge of their release.\n\nThe Financial Times reported last month, however, that McBride had lobbied members of Congress to speak up for them; and that the US special envoy Richard Grenell, a Trump acolyte, raised the case with Romania’s foreign minister, Emil Hurezeanu, at the Munich Security Conference in February.\n\nAsked about the president’s influence as he arrived for a podcast recording in Fort Lauderdale last week, Andrew replied: “Trump is such a boss, he is such a gangster. As for Ron [DeSantis], I’m disappointed.”\n\nOn Monday, meanwhile, Andrew Tate posted to his 10.8 million followers on X that he was heading back to Florida from California on Tuesday. He challenged authorities to arrest him upon his arrival.\n\n“Every day you don’t arrest me proves you’re clowns talking lies for political points,” he wrote. “Come and get me if I’m guilty and charge me in a court of law.”\n\nThe Guardian contacted the Florida attorney general’s office for an update on the investigation, which Uthmeier said on 5 March involved search warrants, subpoenas and the seizure of the Tates’ electronics upon their arrival.\n\nOther than popping up for a couple of podcast appearances, the Tates have kept a relatively low profile since landing in Florida on 27 February and being whisked away by a large security team.\n\nJournalists have been unable to establish where in south Florida they have been staying, or with whom. Their social media feeds have provided a myriad of contradictions, alongside a series of wild attacks on DeSantis, Uthmeier and reposting unfounded claims about a “south Florida Jewish mob” the 38-year-old former kickboxer believes is out to get him.\n\nFor example, in a post on 6 March Andrew Tate “thanked” Florida for welcoming him and promised he would “see you in a few years”; later the same day, he announced he had changed his mind and had “bought a Miami penthouse”; and four days after that, he was floating a plan to travel to Jamaica and “hang out” with a little-known fellow “influencer” called Biggs Don.\n\nIn between, he announced he was in California and tweeted at the state’s Democratic governor, Gavin Newsom, to file charges against him.\n\nAndrew Tate, who has become increasingly aligned with Trump in recent years, and his 36-year-old brother, are required to return to Romania to answer bail conditions before the end of this month, which McBride said they would do. After that, Tate said, he plans to become a permanent resident of Florida.\n\nYet the depth of his fury for what he perceives as persecution by state officials became evident in a podcast he recorded last week with the rightwing host Candace Owens, who like Tate has been previously suspended from social media platforms for extremist content.\n\n“I could have chosen anywhere. I could have gone [to] Thailand, I could have gone [to] Dubai,” he said.\n\n“I thought, ‘You know what, let me go home’. And this is the welcome I get.”",

        "content": "Taking over the justice department headquarters for what amounted to a political event, Donald Trump railed against the criminal cases he defeated by virtue of returning to the presidency in an extraordinary victory lap the department has perhaps never before seen.\n\nThe event was billed as a policy address for the administration to tout its focus on combating illegal immigration and drug trafficking, but the majority of the president’s freewheeling remarks focused instead on his personal grievances with the department.\n\nTrump spoke from a specially constructed stage in the great hall of the main justice building, backed with blue velvet curtains that underscored the theatrics and symbolism of Trump cementing his control over the justice department, which had tried and failed to hold him to account.\n\nThe choice of venue carried additional resonance about how Trump has fully implemented his agenda at the justice department, doing away with the longstanding tradition of independence from partisan politics and instead turning it into an extension of the White House.\n\nThe great hall has historically been used for major law enforcement announcements by the justice department and its senior leaders, and when presidents have delivered speeches at the building, the remarks have been of a national security or non-political stripe.\n\nIn Trump’s hourlong speech, he repeatedly strayed from his prepared remarks to assail the criminal cases against him, various lawyers and former prosecutors by name and accused the Biden administration of trying to destroy him, declaring Joe Biden the head of a crime family.\n\n“The case against me was bullshit,” Trump said with fury, in the building where the charges were approved.\n\nBut he heaped praise on his defense lawyers Todd Blanche and Emil Bove, whom he elevated to in effect run the justice department as the deputy attorney general and the principal associate deputy attorney general respectively, as well as the department’s chief of staff, Chad Mizelle.\n\nThe approval Trump expressed for Bove reflected his genuine appreciation. Trump has privately hailed Bove for bringing the department to heel in recent weeks, including by forcing through the dismissal of the corruption case against the New York mayor, Eric Adams.\n\nTrump offered notable praise for the US district judge Aileen Cannon, who dismissed his criminal case on charges of mishandling classified documents, over decades of legal precedent. Trump claimed criticism of her made her angry, although he also said he had never spoken to her.\n\n“She was brilliant,” Trump said of Cannon, “the absolute model of what a judge should be.”\n\nHe then suggested it should be a crime to criticize judges because they could be influenced by what he described as bad publicity. The remark appeared to be a new idea from Trump, who has previously castigated judges who did not rule in his favor and sought to defend legal cases in public.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to This Week in Trumpland Free newsletter A deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administration Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

        "title": "Trump’s tariffs will be paid by the poor – while his tax cuts help the rich | Robert Reich",
        "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/",
        "content": "Donald Trump apparently believes his tariffs will bring so much money to the US treasury that the US will be able to afford another giant Trump tax cut.\n\nBut Trump’s tariffs – and the retaliatory tariffs already being imposed on American exports by the nation’s trading partners – will be paid largely by the American working class and poor.\n\nAnd the people who will benefit most from another giant Trump tax cut are America’s wealthy.\n\nIt will be a giant upward transfer of wealth.\n\nTrump has made astronomical estimates about how much money tariffs can raise.\n\n“We will take in trillions and trillions of dollars and create jobs like we have never seen before,” he said during his recent joint address to Congress. “Tariffs are about making America rich again and making America great again.”\n\nLast Sunday on Air Force One, Trump was even more ebullient. “We’re going to become so rich you’re not going to know where to spend all that money,” he said.\n\nThe Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimates that if Trump’s already-announced tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada went into effect, they would bring about $120bn a year into the US treasury, and $1.3tn over the course of 10 years.\n\nAmong Trump’s first actions at the outset of his second term was to order the treasury to establish an “External Revenue Service” to collect tariff revenue that would enable the US to pay down its debt and reduce taxes.\n\nHoward Lutnick, Trump’s secretary of commerce, said on Fox News in late February that the goal of the External Revenue Service “is very simple: to abolish the Internal Revenue Service and let all the outsiders pay”.\n\nIn other words: the US will raise so much money from Trump’s tariffs that Americans will no longer need to pay income taxes.\n\nThe first problem with this is mathematical. America raises about $3tn each year from income taxes. The nation also imports about $3tn worth of goods each year.\n\nTrump keeps saying other countries pay for tariffs. That’s not how they work\n\nSo to replace income taxes, tariffs would have to be at least 100% on all imported goods. Also, Americans would have to continue to import $3tn worth of goods every year. Neither of these is remotely plausible.\n\nThe second problem is who pays.\n\nTrump keeps saying other countries pay for tariffs. That’s not how they work.\n\nTariffs are in effect taxes on imported products. They’re paid by Americans.\n\nSay there’s a 60% tariff on Chinese imports. When Walmart imports Mr Coffee machines from China (where they’re made), China doesn’t pay the 60% tariff to the US government. Walmart does.\n\nIf Walmart had bought the coffee machine for $20 before the tariff, the 60% tariff requires Walmart to pay an extra $12 – bringing the total cost of each coffee machine to $32.\n\nWalmart doesn’t want that extra $12 to cut into its profit margin, so it will try not to absorb that cost. Instead, it will pass the extra $12 on to its customers.\n\nWalmart’s CEO has already said it expects to raise prices in response to Trump’s tariffs in order to protect its profits.\n\nNow, targeted tariffs can be used to protect industries critical to national security.\n\nThis is what the Biden administration did when it levied tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles, solar panels, computer chips and batteries after making massive domestic investments in these technologies.\n\nBut Trump has proposed across-the-board tariffs on almost all imports – particularly from America’s largest trading partners.\n\nWhile Americans will pay more for imported goods due to tariffs, countries that export the products to America are also harmed because Americans presumably will buy fewer of their coffee makers and anything else they sell in the United States that now costs more. These countries are retaliating by raising tariffs on American exports.\n\nOn Monday, China began imposing tariffs on a range of American farm products, including a 15% levy on chicken, wheat and corn.\n\nThese retaliatory tariffs will hurt America’s farm belt – mostly Republican states and Trump voters.\n\nOn Wednesday, after Trump imposed a 25% tariff on all aluminum and steel imports coming into the United States from the rest of the world, the European Union announced retaliatory tariffs on about $28bn worth of American exports, including beef and whiskey.\n\nNot incidentally, Europe’s retaliatory tariffs are on goods mostly produced by Republican states (think Kentucky bourbon). Europe is also slapping tariffs on Harley-Davidson motorcycles, made in America’s rust belt.\n\nOn Thursday, in response to Europe’s tariffs, Trump threatened a 200% tariff on all alcoholic products from EU member states. If he follows through, Trump voters will be paying more for much of the alcohol they consume.\n\nCanada also announced new tariffs on about $21bn worth of US products.\n\nThis is called a trade war. There are no winners in such a war.\n\nOne of the biggest global trade wars started with the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act in 1930. After the 1929 stock market crash, President Herbert Hoover and Republicans thought sweeping tariffs would help the economy.\n\nThey didn’t. Import prices surged, and exports plummeted because of other nations’ retaliatory tariffs. Global trade fell by 66%, worsening the Great Depression.\n\nSmoot-Hawley seemed to prove that across-the-board tariffs don’t work. Then came Trump’s first term and his sweeping tariffs, largely on China.\n\nHigher prices from Trump’s first-term tariffs on thousands of Chinese imports are estimated to have cost American families close to $80bn.\n\nThis cost took a larger chunk out of the incomes of poorer families than richer ones.\n\nIf you make $50,000 a year, the cost of a coffee maker that rises due to tariffs affects you more than it does someone making $1m a year who can better afford the price increase.\n\nTo put it another way, tariffs are a highly regressive tax.\n\nFollowing Trump’s first-term tariffs on China, Beijing retaliated with its own tariffs on American exports. This led China to import less from America.\n\nIn the US agriculture industry alone, the result was a $27bn loss in exports from mid-2018 to the end of 2019. Even though the government increased aid to affected farmers, farm bankruptcies shot up 20%.\n\nAnother consequence of Trump’s first-term trade war was that American manufacturing shrank, as demand for exports slumped and as raw materials used in manufacturing became more expensive.\n\nOne study estimates that Trump’s first-term trade war cost nearly 300,000 American jobs.\n\nInstead of learning a lesson from this fiasco, Trump is now promising even bigger tariffs – more tariff hikes on China and, starting on 2 April, 25% tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico.\n\nThese new tariffs would cost the typical American household an additional $1,200 this year. If Trump makes good on previous pledges to slap more tariffs on imports from around the world in addition to aluminum and steel, American families can expect to spend as much as $4,000 more.\n\nTrump says he’ll use the revenue from tariffs to “offset” more of his big pending tax cut.\n\nThat tax cut will disproportionately benefit wealthy Americans and big corporations, as did Trump’s first-term tax cut. But revenue raised from tariffs will be coming disproportionately from average working people.\n\nHence, it will be a massive transfer of wealth from most Americans to the super wealthy and giant corporations.\n\nWill most Americans know that the higher prices they’ll pay for groceries, gas, housing and all sorts of other things will be going into the pockets of the wealthy? Will they know whom to blame?\n\nTrump was able to fool most Americans during his first term into believing he had created a marvelous economy for them and that they benefited from his tariffs and tax cuts.\n\nIt was a lie, of course. But he tells lots of lies that many Americans believe. Will he be able to do it again, on a much larger scale?",

Musk is the head of the unofficial so-called “department of government efficiency” (Doge) and has made it his prerogative to overhaul the federal government – ordering the firing of tens of thousands of employees, slashing agency budgets and eliminating entire departments. His hardline approach, which takes aim at institutions including the National Weather Service, the Department of Education and the Social Security Administration, has elicited backlash and criticism nationwide.\n\nThousands have attended peaceful protests at Tesla showrooms in cities and towns across the country. In the 54-odd days since the inauguration, those protests have grown from a handful of people in cities like San Francisco chanting “Hey hey, ho ho, Elon Musk has got to go” to massive demonstrations across the US replete with live bands, Musk-as-Hitler costumes and heavy police presence. They have also crossed the Atlantic, with demonstrations occurring in the UK and Germany.\n\nAs the protests have multiplied, so has vandalism against Tesla’s brick-and-mortar business and individual vehicles. The Guardian has tracked at least three separate incidents involving molotov cocktails, the coordinated theft of nearly 50 Tesla tires and spray-painted swastikas on Tesla facilities from New York to New Mexico. Nearly 20 Tesla showrooms and charging stations have seen deliberate fires set, while dozens of owners have had their cars egged, pooped on and hit with Kraft cheese singles.\n\nLike the protests, the defacement and destruction of Tesla facilities has also gone international, with sedans and Cybertrucks targeted in at least five other countries. In France, authorities in Toulouse reported that a dozen cars were torched at a Tesla showroom earlier this month. Another showroom in the Netherlands was graffitied with slogans such as “fuck off fascist” and others that called Musk a Nazi. One vandal as far away as Tasmania wrote “do you really want to drive a swasticar” across a dealership window.\n\nMusk and Tesla did not return requests for comment. In response to a police report of Tesla vandalism in Massachusetts, Musk posted on X, “Damaging the property of others, aka vandalism, is not free speech!” Musk also reposted an interview with Valerie Costa, an organizer of the nonviolent Tesla Takedown demonstrations, and accused her of “committing crimes”.\n\nTrump said earlier this week that he would label the violence against Tesla showrooms as domestic terrorism as he stood next to Musk in front of the White House. “I’m going to put a stop to it,” Trump said. “Because they’re harming a great American company.”\n\nView image in fullscreen Trump and Musk speak to the press from inside a Tesla on the South Portico of the White House on 11 March 2025 in Washington, DC. Photograph: Mandel Ngan/AFP/Getty Images\n\nA day later, the House speaker Mike Johnson boosted the proposed designation. “Congress will investigate the sources of these attacks and help the DOJ & FBI ensure those responsible are prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law,” Johnson posted on X, the social media platform Musk owns.\n\nMusk thanked Johnson on X, adding both a salute and American flag emoji.\n\nHurling molotovs and firing semi-automatics\n\nIn Salem, one month after the suspect first hurled molotov cocktails at the Tesla dealership, he returned. This time he came armed with what police believe to be a semi-automatic rifle.\n\nAt around 4am, surveillance footage shows him firing multiple rounds into the empty Tesla showroom, once again shattering windows and hitting a car parked inside the building. Investigators collected bullet fragments, logged surveillance video and sent the leftover molotov cocktails to an FBI lab in Alabama for fingerprint dusting. No one was injured.\n\nATF agents believe both incidents are linked to Salem resident Adam Lansky, who has been apprehended and charged. Lansky’s lawyer did not return a request for comment.\n\nIn the small Colorado town of Loveland, police rushed to a Tesla showroom in response to a report of a fire burning by a Cybertruck on 29 January. Underneath the vehicle, they found a spent molotov cocktail.\n\nAs with the Salem incident, the suspect in the Loveland case returned to the scene, according to court documents. Four days later, the word “Nazi” was spray painted on the dealership’s sign. Over the following weeks, the showroom was targeted three more times with molotov cocktails and graffiti. Lucy Grace Nelson, a resident from a nearby town, was charged for the series of incidents. Her lawyer declined to comment on the case.\n\nPolice in North Charleston, South Carolina, are also investigating a vandal who threw a molotov cocktail at a Tesla charging station earlier this week, setting both it and himself on fire and forcing officials to cut the station’s power. The words “long live the Ukraine” were spray painted in red on the pavement next to the charging stations, according to the Associated Press. The incident came after Trump rolled back US support for Ukraine in its war with Russia, a move that Musk embraced.\n\nView image in fullscreen A person clad in black clothes hurling a molotov cocktail. Photograph: The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF)\n\nDeliberate fires have also been set at Tesla showrooms and charging stations throughout the US without molotovs. Earlier this month, in Littleton, Massachusetts, seven Tesla charging stations were set ablaze in one night, according to CBS. Police found the first station thick with dark smoke and flames. Fires were also set at a Tesla facility in rural New Mexico and in an electric vehicle holding lot in Seattle, Washington, this week.\n\nThe Seattle fire department told the Guardian it found four Cybertrucks engulfed in flames when it arrived on the scene at around 11pm last Sunday. Local news station Komo News flew a drone over the wreckage and filmed one Cybertruck reduced to “little more than a charred hunk of metal”. Another was so badly burned that the windows melted, according to Komo. The Seattle police declined to comment because the investigation is ongoing.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to TechScape Free weekly newsletter A weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our lives Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Photograph: The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF)\n\nReports of spray painted Teslas, showrooms and charging stations are rampant across the country. In Salt Lake City, swastikas and the word “Nazi” were found at both a Tesla Service Center and a separate charging station, according to local police. Black swastikas were also painted on a charging station in the small mountain town of Meyers in California. In Ithaca, New York, along with swastikas, “Hail Hitler” and “Tesla is Fascist” were emblazoned on the superchargers.\n\nAt a Tesla facility in Lynnwood, Washington, vandals targeted a cluster of six Cybertrucks but left other vehicles there untouched.\n\n“I observed red spray paint on each of the cyber trucks,” reads a police report from Lynnwood obtained by the Guardian. “The graffiti wrote ‘Fuck Elon’ and a multitude of swastikas were spray painted onto the body panels of the vehicles.”\n\nEgged, spray painted and pooped on\n\nSome vandals have opted for incapacitating Musk’s cars rather than destroying them. In League City, Texas, 44 wheels were stolen off cars in an overflow parking lot for a Tesla dealership. The lot was hit on two separate occasions, with a total of 13 vehicles damaged. Jose Ortega, a spokesman for the League City police, said the case is inactive due to a lack of leads. Nearby surveillance cameras weren’t recording and “the cameras on the Teslas were not active since they were powered off”, Ortega said.\n\nMuch of the vandalism targeting Teslas involves minor, less destructive methods than molotov cocktails and spray paint. Tesla owners around the country have had their cars plastered with anti-Musk stickers and flyers, as well as hit with eggs and dog feces.\n\nThe owner of a golden Cybertruck in Southborough, Massachusetts, discovered that someone had put a “Nazis fuck off” sticker on his bumper last month, he told local media. Elsewhere in Massachusetts, police in Brookline arrested a 39-year-old man earlier this month and charged him with six counts of defacing property over allegedly putting stickers depicting Musk giving a fascist-style salute on people’s cars.\n\nOther Tesla drivers have seen their vehicles pelted with foodstuffs, including a Maryland woman who told the Washington Post that her car was hit with around a dozen eggs while she was driving home. In Dallas, Texas, a man had Kraft singles thrown at his Tesla.\n\nVandalism incidents can turn into viral social media content, like a post on X, viewed 25m times, that showed a Cybertruck in Brooklyn, New York, covered in broken eggs and dog feces. One TikTok that received over 700,000 views showed a man weaponizing the administrative state against a Tesla vehicle: he called a parking attendant when he saw a Cybertruck allegedly parked in a loading zone in hopes of getting it ticketed or towed.\n\nThe fears of vandalism and questions over what to do about their car’s association with Musk have become hot topics of discussion in online communities dedicated to Tesla. A thread started last month about “dealing with anti-Tesla sentiment” on Tesla Motors Club, an independent online forum for Tesla owners, received over 400 replies until it was closed to further posts. Bumper stickers that state “I bought this before Elon went crazy” are now widely available online and have been spotted on Teslas around the country. Other social media posts show people trying to disguise their Teslas by changing their hood and bumper ornaments to mimic brands like Honda or Toyota. Some Tesla owners are selling their vehicles at a loss to rid themselves of the stigma.\n\nPolice have also been seen guarding Cybertrucks and dealerships during demonstrations. A widely shared TikTok video taken last week during the New York City Women’s March showed a group of New York police department officers surrounding a Cybertruck parked on the street while a protester held a “no to Tesla” sign up behind them. Crowds at a Mardi Gras celebration earlier this month in New Orleans booed a Cybertruck and hurled beads at its windows, forcing it off a parade route as police attempted to shield it from harm.\n\nThe wave of vandalism doesn’t seem to be ebbing. Back in Loveland, Colorado, almost two weeks after Nelson was arrested for lobbing molotov cocktails at the Tesla showroom, the same facility was targeted on 7 March, just after midnight.\n\nUsing an incendiary device, someone ignited a fire between two Teslas and threw rocks at the showroom – breaking windows and damaging several cars. No injuries were reported and police say the incident doesn’t appear to be connected to Nelson, the prior suspect. Loveland’s police chief dubbed the act “copycat behavior”.",

        "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/",
        "content": "The Trump administration is considering issuing travel restrictions for the citizens of dozens of countries as part of a new ban, according to sources familiar with the matter and an internal memo seen by Reuters.\n\nThe memo lists a total of 41 countries divided into three separate groups. The first group of 10 countries, which includes Afghanistan, Iran, Syria, Cuba and North Korea, among others, would be set for a full visa suspension.\n\nIn the second group, five countries – Eritrea, Haiti, Laos, Myanmar and South Sudan – would face partial suspensions that would affect tourist and student visas as well as other immigrant visas, with some exceptions.\n\nIn the third group, a total of 26 countries including Belarus, Pakistan and Turkmenistan, among others, would be considered for a partial suspension of US visa issuance if their governments “do not make efforts to address deficiencies within 60 days”, the memo said.\n\nThe list has yet to be approved by the administration, including the US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, and could be amended, officials told the outlet.\n\nThe memo follows an executive order issued on 20 January that requires intensified security vetting of any foreigners seeking admission to the US to detect national security threats, and directed several cabinet members to submit a list of countries for partial or full suspension because their “vetting and screening information is so deficient”.\n\nDuring the first Trump administration, in 2017, a partial ban imposed on travelers from predominantly Muslim-population nations was labeled a “Muslim ban” by Trump and his aides.\n\nFourteen months earlier, after an Islamic State-inspired mass shooting in San Bernardino, California, Trump had called for “a total and complete” shutdown of Muslims entering the US “until our country’s representatives can figure out what the hell is going on”.\n\nA new set of restrictions, outlined in the memo, would follow pledges by the president to institute an immigration crackdown. In October 2023, Trump pledged to restrict people from the Gaza Strip, Libya, Somalia, Syria, Yemen and “anywhere else that threatens our security”.\n\nAny move to ban or restrict immigration from the list of 43 countries would come in tandem with Department of Homeland Security efforts to deport undocumented migrants affiliated with newly identified terrorist crime networks, including Venezuela’s Tren de Aragua, El Salvador’s MS-13 and the Mexican-American 18th St.\n\nAt the same time, the Trump administration is moving to cancel immigration status and deport several foreign-born university graduates, including Columbia University graduate Mahmoud Khalil, who led campus protests against Israel’s war on Gaza last year.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Headlines US Free newsletter Get the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morning Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

        "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/",
        "content": "If Robert K Merton, the founding father of American sociology, were alive today, he’d be fascinated by the Donald Trump phenomenon. Scarcely more than 50 days into his second presidential term, hapless Trump provides daily proofs of Merton’s universal “law of unintended consequences”.\n\nRooted in ignorance, error, wilful blindness and self-defeating prediction, Trump’s rash actions produce contradictory, harmful and often opposite results to those he says he wants. The ensuing chaos characterises what may become the briefest honeymoon in White House history.\n\nBoomeranging US tariffs – which are to American prosperity what the Titanic was to ocean travel – are the tip of the unintended consequences iceberg. Defiant foreign retaliation has brought stock market crashes and inflation fears – the exact opposite of what Trump promised voters.\n\nTrump won a mandate to make America great again, not greater – at least, not territorially. After his threats to invade Canada, loyal subjects of King Charles III are up in arms, booing the Stars and Stripes, boycotting US goods and retaliating with their own tariffs. Single-handedly, Trump has revived the fortunes of Justin Trudeau’s Liberal party. Under the new “elbows up” leadership of the former Bank of England chief Mark Carney, it has a good chance of winning this year’s election on an anti-Trump platform. That was not the plan.\n\nLikewise, Greenland’s voters, stung by a proposed Putin-style imperialist annexation, told Trump to take a hike last week. They are undecided about independence but definitely reject US (or Danish) domination. Had there been any tea to spare in Nuuk, they would surely have tossed Trump and it into the harbour.\n\nTrump’s Ukraine surrender policy is another calamity. Russia is the aggressor, yet he punishes the victim. US pressure for a ceasefire is all one way – on Kyiv. This is emboldening Vladimir Putin to intensify attacks, notably in Kursk, while stringing muggins Trump along.\n\nThe prospective, unintended, consequences of an unjust peace are the undeserved rehabilitation of Russia, de facto amnesty for Putin’s war crimes, a precedent-setting ceding of sovereign territory seized by force, and a deep US-Europe split. So the question arises again: is this really unintended? Whether Trump is a stooge, KGB asset or plain stupid was discussed here last week. Most probably, he has no real idea what he’s doing – or just doesn’t care. How else to explain his belief that proving himself right about tariffs is worth starting a global recession? Or that the ethnic cleansing of two million Palestinians in Gaza can bring peace?\n\nThe explanation that Trump’s main concern is China, that he is trying to prise Moscow away from Beijing, is more upside-down thinking. These two authoritarian, anti-democratic states share a pernicious agenda: weakening and usurping the western-led, rules-based global order. Deliberately or not, Trump is assisting their ambitions.\n\nSurely even Trump and the underqualified toadies who advise him (no adults in the room in this White House) must realise that handing a humiliating victory to Russia does not bring closer lasting peace but future conflict with Nato neighbours and the US itself – while encouraging lawless behaviour all around. Perhaps they don’t realise. For unintended consequences, count on clueless dunces.\n\nPerhaps the scariest unlooked-for consequence of Trump’s serial blunders is accelerating nuclear weapons proliferation\n\n“Until him, no US president had been so ignorant of the lessons of history. Until him, no US president had been so incompetent in putting his own ideas into practice,” snarled the conservative commentator Bret Stephens. “Democracy may die in darkness. It may die in despotism. Under Trump, it’s just as liable to die in dumbness.”\n\nMerton described a foolish insistence on being right, despite all contrary evidence, as the “imperious immediacy of interest”. As the writer Rob Norton explains, “an individual wants the intended consequence of an action so much that he purposefully chooses to ignore any unintended effects”. This is not true ignorance. It’s wilful ignorance.\n\nPerhaps the scariest unlooked-for consequence of Trump’s serial blunders is accelerating nuclear weapons proliferation. Alarmed by his threats to withdraw US protection, and shocked at the betrayal of Ukraine, Germany, Poland and South Korea are all urgently talking about obtaining an atomic bomb. Iran, Saudi Arabia, Turkey and Egypt have similar thoughts, for different reasons.\n\nTrump claims to want a nuclear-free world. “His policies are having the opposite effect,” wrote the analyst WJ Hennigan. “Thanks to Mr Trump… the perceived value of acquiring nuclear weapons among allies appears to have quickly gone up, while confidence in extended deterrence has gone down.”\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Observed Free weekly newsletter Analysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writers Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In his self-appointed role as godlike peace-giver, Trump told Tehran to restart nuclear talks – or else. His “bullying” has enraged Iran’s leaders. An Iranian nuke, and military confrontation with the US and Israel, is now more, not less likely.\n\nAcolytes and hangers-on take their cue from the boss in his looking-glass land of self-inflicted cock-ups and risible own goals. Vice-president JD Vance and technobrat Elon Musk gave European “liberals” a dressing-down last month and endorsed Germany’s far-right AfD party. The results are the reverse of what they expected.\n\nGerman voters rejected the new fascists, Musk’s businesses are boycotted, and the EU is forging a united front against Trump and Putin both. Ironically, the Vance-Musk standup act’s repellent backing for Russia has wrongfooted “fawning” European rightwing populists, including Britain’s Nigel Farage. Centrists like Keir Starmer are enjoying a “Trump bump”.\n\nAs Trump careers uncontrollably towards the 100-day mark, his approval ratings slide. He is already less popular than Joe Biden was at a similar stage. His honeymoon is history. Before November’s election, he claimed, falsely, that America was in an unprecedented mess. Such exaggeration is what Merton, who coined the phrase, called a “self-fulfilling prophecy”. Now, unintentionally, it’s coming true.\n\nSimon Tisdall is the Observer’s Foreign Affairs Commentator\n\nDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The extent of the damage was not yet clear.\n\n“Our brave Warfighters are right now carrying out aerial attacks on the terrorists’ bases, leaders, and missile defenses to protect American shipping, air, and naval assets, and to restore Navigational Freedom,” Trump said in a social media post.\n\n“No terrorist force will stop American commercial and naval vessels from freely sailing the Waterways of the World.”\n\nHe also warned Iran to stop supporting the rebel group, promising to hold the country “fully accountable” for the actions of its proxy.\n\nThe airstrikes come a few days after the Houthis said they would resume attacks on Israeli vessels sailing in waters off Yemen in response to Israel’s blockade on Gaza. There have been no Houthi attacks reported since then.\n\nAt least 13 civilians were killed and nine injured in the US strikes on Sana’a, the Houthi-run health ministry said on Saturday evening.\n\nSix other people, including four children and one woman, were killed and 11 were injured in a US strike on the northern province of Sa’ada, Houthi-run al-Masirah TV reported.\n\nThe Houthi rebels have targeted more than 100 merchant vessels with missiles and drones, sinking two vessels and killing four sailors during their campaign targeting military and civilian ships after the start of the war between Israel and Hamas in late 2023 until January of this year, when a tenuous ceasefire in Gaza took effect.\n\nThe attacks greatly raised the Houthis’ profile as they faced economic problems and launched a crackdown targeting any dissent and aid workers at home amid Yemen’s decade-long stalemated war that has torn apart the Arab world’s poorest nation.\n\nThe United States, Israel and Britain have previously hit Houthi-held areas in Yemen. Israel’s military declined to comment.\n\nThe Houthi media office said the US strikes hit “a residential neighborhood” in Sana’a’s northern district of Shouab.\n\nThe Saturday operation against the Houthis was conducted solely by the US, according to a US official. It was the first strike on the Yemen-based Houthis under the second Trump administration, and it comes after a period of relative quiet in the region.\n\nSuch broad-based and pre-planned missile strikes against the Houthis were carried out multiple times by the Biden administration in response to frequent attacks by the Houthis against commercial and military vessels in the region.\n\nThe USS Harry S Truman carrier strike group, which includes the carrier, three navy destroyers and one cruiser, is in the Red Sea and was part of the mission. The USS Georgia cruise missile submarine has also been operating in the region.\n\nTrump announced the strikes as he spent the day at his Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach, Florida.\n\n“These relentless assaults have cost the US and World Economy many BILLIONS of Dollars while, at the same time, putting innocent lives at risk,” Trump said.",

        "content": "The patient referral comes through my reliable old fax machine on a single sheet of paper. “Thanks for seeing this 74-year-old gentleman with end-stage liver failure. He’s been following the news carefully and is eager to make a request for an assisted death. I hear you’ll be providing this service here in Victoria – courageous! I look forward to your assessment. Summary of his file is below.” I read it twice to myself before sharing it with Karen, my office manager. We look at each other for a short moment before I break the silence. “His name is Harvey. I’m going to need a chart.”\n\nWhile Karen makes a chart for Harvey – demographics on the front sheet, blank request forms in the back – I dial his number. His wife, Norma, answers. As Harvey isn’t mobile, I agree to meet them at their home.\n\nThree days later, I stand in my bathroom brushing my teeth and practising what I will say, the tone I want to set. If Harvey meets all the criteria, he will be the first patient to whom I will offer medical assistance in dying (MAiD), following its legalisation in Canada just a few days earlier, in June 2016.\n\nAt the time I had been practising medicine for more than 20 years, trained as a family physician, and focused on maternity and newborn care, preparing women and their families for the profound transition a new baby would bring to their lives. But when it became clear the law was about to change to allow MAiD, I changed course with it, learning everything I could about this newly emerging field so that I could support people with their final wishes and their transition at the other end of life.\n\nWhen I arrive at Harvey’s home for the assessment, a man in his 70s with a bushy grey moustache opens the door and smiles sadly as he extends his hand. “Hi, thanks for coming. I’m Rod, Harvey’s brother-in-law.”\n\nI cross the threshold and am ushered upstairs, where I see a man in a bathrobe and a woman sitting close together on a couch. “Hello, Doctor, thank you for coming,” she says, smiling. “I’m Norma.” Her hands fidgeting, she appears slightly nervous, or maybe just awkward. I recognise the same feeling within myself.\n\nDressed in grey pyjamas and covered with a warm blanket, Harvey looks years older than Norma. I notice his protuberant, fluid-filled abdomen and papery, yellowed skin, signs that his liver failure is advanced. I see his frail hands and gaunt, unshaved face. He likely has only weeks left to live.\n\n“Good to meet you,” I say as I give his hand a squeeze. It is cool and bony, mottled with purple, and has little musculature left, but he holds on a little tighter and just a moment longer than I expect, slowly shifting his gaze to look me straight in the eye before letting go. I sit down in front of Harvey and ready myself to begin what I have been practising all morning. “I’d like to start by breaking the first rule of medical school.”\n\nHarvey musters a sly grin, intrigued, but doesn’t say anything, which I take as an invitation to continue.\n\n“In medical school, they taught me that when I meet a new patient, I should let them speak first … But I want to start by telling you something about myself. I want to tell you that I am pretty direct,” I say.\n\nHarvey is egging me on with a slow, wobbly nod.\n\n“We’re going to talk about death today, and we’re going to talk about dying,” I continue. “We’re going to talk about your death, and we’re going to talk about assisted dying. We’re also going to talk about what’s important to you. I’m going to talk about these things frankly. I’m not going to use euphemisms or talk about ‘passing over meadows’.” I pause and lower my voice, addressing Harvey directly. “You OK with that?”\n\nI am relieved to see he is smiling. “Yes, that’s exactly what I hoped for,” he says. “No more bullshit.” His voice is a bit gravelly, but this last word comes out strong, emphatic. “We’re going to get along just fine,” he adds.\n\nWhat to wear? All black seems morbid, bright colours too festive. I want to look professional but not cold, casual but no jeans\n\nI get down to the essentials. “Why do you want to die?”\n\nHarvey smirks. “I don’t! I’d rather live. I’ve had a great life. But it seems I no longer have much say in the matter.”\n\nIt’s my turn to nod.\n\n“I’ve got great friends, great kids, we’re blessed with family all around us. I know I’m lucky. I’ve been married to this gal here for 52 years … ” He trails off, holds Norma’s hand, shakes it at me a bit and swallows some emotion before continuing. “I really wanted to make it to 52 years, and I did.” He’s quieter now, his energy already drained. “Now I’m ready.”\n\nHarvey is straightforward with me. He knows he is dying, that it will not be long, but he wants to control the how and the when.\n\n“I want Norma and the kids with me at the end,” he says with a flash of spirit, “here, in my home, in my own bedroom … I want to do it my way. I want to have my friends over this weekend, have one last bash, maybe even sneak a sip of a beer.” He smiles at the thought. “I’ve seen friends linger on at the end … in bed … out of their minds. I’m not interested in putting myself or my family through that.”\n\nHarvey ticks every box of eligibility. He is capable of making his own decisions, he is making a voluntary request, and he has a grievous and irremediable condition. He will need to sign an official request form, and Norma assures me it will be completed by the end of the day, witnessed by two independent people. After that, a mandatory 10-day reflective period can begin. The law also requires a second clinical opinion, so I will call a local colleague to see if he is available.\n\nThe next few days are busy. As is expected with his liver failure, Harvey continues to decline cognitively. If he declines too much, too quickly, he won’t be able to give his final consent immediately before the procedure, which is required. Because the second doctor and I agree this risk is imminent, we are allowed to shorten the waiting period. Harvey chooses a date three days out.\n\nTrue to his word, two days before his scheduled death, Harvey and Norma host an open house for friends and neighbours to celebrate his life and say goodbye. Meanwhile, I review all the practicalities and guidelines. I am keenly aware that if I get anything wrong, I could be liable for criminal charges. The words “up to 14 years in prison” keep flashing in the back of my mind. No one yet has a sense of the mood of the prosecutors. Are they waiting to meticulously comb through each case and make an example of a clinician who makes a mistake? I’m not willing to leave anything to chance. Harvey isn’t just my first assisted death. His is the first on Vancouver Island and among the first in Canada. I am aware that I need to get this right – for myself, for the MAiD programme but, most important, for Harvey.\n\nIt’s 16 June 2016, the day Harvey has chosen to die. This is all about him, but it’s momentous for everyone involved. This morning I stood in my bedroom, staring into my closet, considering choices and discarding them immediately. What does one wear to a scheduled death? All black seemed morbid, bright colours too festive. I wanted to look professional but not cold, casual but no jeans. How could this be the hardest part of my day? I’ll be picking up the medication at 10am, I’m expected at Harvey’s by 11 and I suspect he’ll be dead before noon.\n\nI pull up outside, close enough to have arrived, far enough that no one from inside can tell I’m here yet. I take a deep breath. In medical school, the saying was “see one, do one, teach one”. But in this case, there has been no way for me to “see one”. The law changed only a few days ago. I am about to take a big, blind step.\n\nI leave the car and stride to the door. Once inside, I head upstairs. I catch Norma’s eye from across the room, but before I can get over to greet her, I meet Jessica, the nurse practitioner who will assist me, standing at the top of the stairs in her scrubs and stocking feet. All I can think of is that I do not want the family to suspect we have never actually met. I don’t want to do anything that might remind them I have never done this before.\n\nThere are eight close family members in the house. I ask to speak privately with Harvey for a few minutes and am told he’s in his bedroom, so I head there. Sitting in the chair by the bed, I begin, “How was your night?”\n\n“It was what it was,” he replies. “I’m ready to go. I need this to be over today.”\n\nThe official purpose of this talk is for me to verify that Harvey is still clear of mind, that he still wishes to proceed and, if so, to obtain his final consent.\n\n“Are you having any second thoughts?”\n\n“No, none at all.”\n\nHarvey reassures me that his affairs are all in order; his funeral plans have been made, the names of his lawyer and his accountant have been written out for the family. He expresses some concern about those he will be leaving behind. I try to reassure him I will provide them with some resources.\n\n“Thank you for making this possible.”\n\nI don’t recall who reached out first or when we began holding hands, but, once again, he is holding mine a little longer and a little tighter than expected.\n\n“You know, I’m a little scared.”\n\n“Of course you are … that’s OK.”\n\nWe talk, take the time we need. No one is in a rush.\n\n“What do you think comes next, Dr Green?”\n\n“I really don’t know, Harvey. What do you think?”\n\n“I’m not a religious man, not even very spiritual. But I do not believe this is the end. It just can’t be.”\n\nView image in fullscreen ‘I join the family in the living room, explain the order of events, the number of syringes.’ Photograph: Rachel Pick/The Guardian\n\n“OK. But what if it were, Harvey?” I ask. “What would you change, do differently?”\n\nHe continues to hold my hand. I hear his regrets – there are few – and of what he is most proud. I learn so much from Harvey. I am already grateful that he is my first MAiD patient.\n\nAt some point we both fall silent. I explain that I will go speak with his family about what to expect. By now I’ve reassured myself that he is still capable of making this choice. I hand him the required form and watch as he scratches out an unsteady version of his signature, then I join the family in the living room. I explain the order of events, the number of syringes – Harvey has chosen the intravenous option for his final medications – and the time for last words. I ask if there is any ritual or ceremony they’d like to incorporate, then I get down to the details. “The first medication is an anti-anxiety drug. It will make Harvey relax, feel pretty good, pretty sleepy. He’s already quite weak, so I expect he’ll fall quickly into a nice light sleep. We might hear him snore; that’s one way you’ll know he’s truly comfortable.”\n\nI am trying to be as transparent and informative as I can.\n\n“The second medication is a local anaesthetic to numb the vein. It may not be necessary if he is sleeping already, but some of the other medications can sting a bit, so I’ll use this to be sure he won’t feel any discomfort.”\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Inside Saturday Free weekly newsletter The only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

I recognise relief on Norma’s face and see blank stares on the others’ … the reality is starting to sink in.\n\n“The third medication is the stuff we would normally give someone for an operation, except it’s a much larger dose. With this, Harvey will go into a much deeper sleep, down into a coma over the course of a couple minutes. If you’re looking carefully, you might notice his breathing begins to space out with this medication.”\n\nI am using my hands now to gesture what is going to happen. “His breathing will become more shallow and will most likely stop.”\n\nI am looking around, trying to judge reactions.\n\n“Even though I expect Harvey will die with this third medication, I will go ahead and use the fourth in our protocol, which ensures there is no muscular movement in the body. I will let you know when his heart has stopped. This whole process is likely to last between eight and 10 minutes.” I lower my voice a little. “I do not expect you will see any gasping or twitching or anything unsettling. My goal is to make this as comfortable and as dignified as possible. But there is a real possibility his breathing will stop before his heart does. If that’s the case, you will likely see a paling of his face, maybe a bit of yellowing. His mouth might drop open slightly. His lips may turn a bit blue. If you find yourself uncomfortable at any time, please feel free to step back, sit down or step out. There is no medal for staying in the room. I will be focused on what I am doing, so I’ll need you to take care of yourselves in those few moments, if necessary. OK?”\n\nMuted nods. A few people breathe out as if they hadn’t realised they were holding their breath.\n\n“That’s the nuts and bolts of it. I expect it’s all feeling a bit real right now. Any questions?”\n\nThere’s a pregnant pause, then a previously quiet man in his mid-70s asks, “You got any extra of that anti-anxiety stuff, Doc? I could use a dose myself right now.”\n\nHarvey’s wife tells him to let go. As on most nights of his life, hers are the last words he hears as he falls asleep\n\nBack in Harvey’s room, he is calm, he is smiling, and he appears certain. His love for family has been evident from the start and they are all here with him now. We are huddled in closely around his bed. I ask if anyone has anything left unsaid. Harvey’s son reaches out from beside me and places his open palm directly on Harvey’s chest. He repeats that he loves Harvey and thanks him for being such a great dad. Harvey reminds them all that this is what he wants and asks them not to be sad.\n\nI take hold of Harvey’s left arm. Only after he looks me in the eye and thanks me one last time do I think to begin. When I announce I will start, I sense Jessica reach out from behind me. I didn’t realise how tense I was until she put her hand on my back. I feel myself relax as I push the first medication through the syringe.\n\n“Maybe now is a good time to think of a great memory,” I begin, “doing something you loved, with someone you loved … Go to that place now, feel that moment again … If you feel sleepy, go ahead and close your eyes, you’ve earned it. We’re all here with you.”\n\nThen Harvey dies exactly as he wished: being held by his children and gazing into the eyes of his wife as he begins to feel sleepy. They connect, forehead to forehead, whispering to each other as I continue. She holds his face in her hands, strokes his head and tells him it’s OK. She tells him she loves him, that she will miss him, but that she is all right. She whispers inaudible words, evoking private memories, and he smiles. The intimacy of this moment is so absorbing that I struggle to focus on what I’m doing. She tells him to let go, that she is here with him, and as on most nights of his life, hers are the last words he hears as he falls asleep.\n\nView image in fullscreen ‘By February 2017 I’d become known for my work in assisted dying, and the number of referrals to my office continued to climb.’ Photograph: Rachel Pick/The Guardian\n\nHarvey musters a light snore. Norma recognises the sound and dabs at her eyes. I continue with my protocol, and Harvey soon stops breathing; no one says anything, but I am certain we all take notice. I understand in that moment that I am witnessing this event as much as I am orchestrating it. I continue on to the final medication and immediately notice it doesn’t flow as smoothly as the others did. I have an instant of panic, wondering if my IV line is blocked, but it takes only a moment for me to understand it’s because Harvey’s blood is no longer circulating. I am certain his heart has stopped, but I continue nonetheless. Only after the last medication is delivered do I cap and lock the IV. Only after the empty syringes are resealed within the plastic container do I reach for my stethoscope. And only after I listen for a complete 60 seconds do I announce, “He’s gone.”\n\nOnly then do his family members allow themselves to be overcome by their loss. There are sobs, tight-clenched hugs and flowing tears. To my utter astonishment, there is also an immediate outpouring of gratitude for what I have just done, and for this, I’ll admit, I was unprepared.\n\nBy February 2017 I’d gone from being a beginner in a new field of medicine to feeling more certain of what I was doing. I was becoming known among local family practitioners and specialists for my work in assisted dying, and the number of referrals to my office continued to climb. The latest concerned a patient called Edna, whose worsening multiple system atrophy was affecting every aspect of her life. Two weeks earlier, her palliative care physician, Dr Vass, had been visiting when she’d asked him for MAiD by scratching out letters on a whiteboard. It was one week after her 77th birthday, just after she’d returned home from a hospitalisation, and she had repeated her plea several times since.\n\nEdna managed a slight smile upon my arrival at her home a few days later, but her eyes seemed locked in a blank gaze. I noticed her frail body was strapped into her padded chair to stay upright. Before I even began, Edna was already scratching on the whiteboard. I waited for her to finish, three letters that said it all: “D-i-E”.\n\nI was surprised and thankful she was still able to write. She looked up and I thought she was done. She uttered a sound I didn’t understand, then brought the marker down forcefully, drawing my attention to her message. “D-i-E P-L-S-!”\n\nRequest received.\n\nEdna was close to her sister, Mindy, from whom I learned that Edna had been a pioneer for most of her life, one of only two women to graduate with a bachelor’s degree in biology from her college back in 1960. She taught high school science for two decades, did a few stints as the principal of two schools, then retired from her post as superintendent of the school district at 68. An avid hiker and a supporter of women’s rights, Edna had remained active and involved in various volunteer positions until her diagnosis overwhelmed her.\n\nEdna was now unable to walk or talk, and had become dependent on others for care. Recently, she’d been losing the ability to swallow, and had landed in hospital last month after aspirating food into her lungs. There was talk of inserting a feeding tube into her stomach. She didn’t want that. She saw no reason to prolong her life as it was, but did not wish to starve to death.\n\nI spoke again to Dr Vass and two weeks later I returned to Edna’s bedside with the news that I was convinced she was eligible, and I was willing to help her. She drew a happy face … no eyes, just a smile. We then turned to practical matters. Edna had been raised in a religious home and still had family who were deeply faithful. She’d been worried about their reaction, so she’d kept much of the decision-making to herself. Now she would share her choice, and hoped they’d be willing to join her on the day of her death. With Mindy’s help, we discussed some of the obstacles she foresaw, and I arranged for a hospice counsellor to facilitate what everyone expected would be a difficult conversation.\n\nIt didn’t go well. The counsellor said she had encouraged people to express their feelings and listen to others’ points of view, but much of the meeting had felt like a sermon: “As her brother was talking, she took the time to write out ‘CHRiStN ANtAgONiSM’. I’d say she’s determined to proceed.” When I returned to talk about choreographing the day of her death, Edna informed me that her relatives would not be joining us.\n\nOn the afternoon of Edna’s scheduled death, I arrived at her home expecting it would be a quiet affair. Instead, I walked into a chaotic scene. I could hear a man’s voice yelling as I opened the front door. Edna’s nephew Andrew and his wife were standing at the foot of her bed, pleading with her to reconsider.\n\n“They have poisoned your mind!” Andrew thundered. “The church will never condone this. Your soul will never rest.” His anger was mounting. “We will never condone this!”\n\n“Good afternoon,” I announced loudly. The yelling stopped immediately. “I’m Dr Green.”\n\nEdna looked calm, but her face was hard to read. I asked Andrew and his wife if we might talk in another room. I told them I respected their position, but it really didn’t matter what they wanted or believed: “This decision is Edna’s and Edna’s alone.”\n\nAndrew lapsed into silence. He stood up abruptly, then sat back down. “How can it be possible that, as a close family member, my arguments won’t be taken into account?” he asked.\n\nI assured him his arguments were important but only in relation to his own healthcare and no one else’s. “This is unconscionable!” he began ramping up again. “If you proceed, I’ll call the police. In fact, I’ll call them anyway. This must be stopped. You cannot just kill my aunt.”\n\nI was concerned to see him so upset, but Edna’s diagnosis was clear and she had made a voluntary, formal request. I felt sorry for her family, I understood they would need support, but I would not be bullied out of my responsibilities, nor would I let them bully Edna.\n\n“You can call,” I said. “I suspect they will be helpful in enforcing the law and escorting you out of this house.” Then I checked my tone and took a breath. “It would be a shame if that were Edna’s final memory of you.” We stared at each other in silence.\n\n“I see,” he said, and stood up once more. “Alice, we are leaving. We’ve done what we could. Aunt Edna will pay the price. I will not attend her murder.”\n\nAnd with that, they walked out. Mindy was just arriving, but they did not stop to talk. I was saddened to see them go, but I was also relieved.\n\nIn an odd twist of fate, I was alone at this procedure. There had been a conflict in scheduling, so Jessica had come by earlier to start the IV, then left. In the end there was just Edna, Mindy and me in the bedroom, and Edna used the whiteboard to provide her consent. When I asked if she was ready to begin, she grunted and nodded slightly, then grabbed my hand and squeezed firmly, three times. I didn’t really know what her hand squeezes meant, but they felt like a thank you to me. For a woman who couldn’t speak any more, I thought she’d communicated beautifully. I began.\n\nLater, alone in my car, I ran over the events in my mind. Andrew referring to Edna’s death as a murder had been upsetting, even though I knew it was purposeful hyperbole. I had to remind myself it was Edna’s disease that was killing her and my role was only to facilitate her free will. Afterwards I asked colleagues if they’d ever encountered such resistance, and I’m sorry to say I wasn’t alone. Much more common, though, were friends or family members who declined to attend, citing differences in values, but remained respectful of their loved one’s right to do as they pleased.\n\nI spent several weeks worrying about whether Edna’s event might lead to a complaint to the professional licensing body. I was confident of the outcome, but dreaded having to go through the process. I took comfort in the fact that, in the end, Edna died with dignity, holding the hand of a person who loved her, confident in her decision and empowered by a rights-based legal system. I’m happy to report no complaint was made.",

        "content": "There’s nothing more satisfying than watching a corporate giant make a stupid mistake. The behemoth in question is Meta, and when Careless People, a whistleblowing book by a former senior employee, Sarah Wynn-Williams, came out last week, its panic-stricken lawyers immediately tried to have it suppressed by the Emergency International Arbitral Tribunal. This strange institution obligingly (and sternly) enjoined Wynn-Williams “from making orally, in writing, or otherwise any ‘disparaging, critical or otherwise detrimental comments to any person or entity concerning [Meta], its officers, directors, or employees’ ”. To which her publisher, Macmillan, issued a statement that could succinctly be summarised thus: “Get stuffed.”\n\nClearly, nobody in Meta has heard of the Streisand effect, “an unintended consequence of attempts to hide, remove or censor information, where the effort instead increases public awareness of the information”. The company has now ensured that Wynn-Williams’s devastating critique of it [see our review inthe New Review] will become a world bestseller.\n\nAmong the many delicious ironies here is that Mark Zuckerberg, Meta’s Supreme Ruler, who has recently become a loud advocate of “free speech” – or at least free speech as understood by the Trump regime – is trying to suppress Wynn-Williams’s troublesome speech. The old-fashioned term for this is hypocrisy. But then her six years spent in the Supreme Leader’s inner circle will have inured her to that.\n\nShe’s also a canny operator. Meta clearly had no idea this was coming. She adapted the playbook used by Frances Haugen, an earlier Facebook whistleblower, lodging a complaint in advance of publication with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) – and briefing the Washington Post on its contents; recording a compelling interview with Emily Maitlis two weeks before publication; and adding a real coup de grace – an appearance on Steve Bannon’s hilarious podcast.\n\nWhat really infuriated him was that there was one huge area of the world – China – that was closed to him\n\nWhat comes across most forcibly from Wynn-Williams’s account is the extent to which Meta is really just a corporate extension of its Supreme Ruler’s personality, reminiscent of what Microsoft was like when Bill Gates ran it. Zuck’s special shareholding means that he has complete control of the company. In its regular SEC filings, there is always a paragraph that makes it clear that he could even sell the company against the views of all shareholders and its board.\n\nThe result is that Meta, as a corporation, always follows Zuck’s obsessions. For many years, that was about ensuring exponential growth in user numbers. Zuck viewed the world much as board-game fanatics view games of conquest. And what really infuriated him was that there was one huge area of the world – China – that was closed to him. In the 78-page document that Wynn-Williams filed to the SEC (and which the Washington Post claims to have seen), it was alleged that Meta had for years been making numerous efforts to get into the biggest market in the world.\n\nThese efforts included: developing a censorship system for China in 2015 that would allow a “chief editor” to decide what content to remove, and the ability to shut down the entire site during “social unrest”; assembling a “China team” in 2014 for a project to develop China-compliant versions of Meta’s services; considering the weakening of privacy protections for Hong Kong users; building a specialised censorship system for China with automatic detection of restricted terms; and restricting the account of Guo Wengui, a Chinese government critic, after a Chinese internet regulator suggested it would improve cooperation. These corporate efforts only stopped after it became clear that both Donald Trump and Joe Biden viewed China as a strategic threat to the US.\n\nThe time has come for Starmer & Co to grow some backbone and stop drinking the Kool Aid about AI\n\nIn her time at Meta, Wynn-Williams observed many of these activities at close range. In that sense, perhaps the most useful thing about her whistleblowing is that it provides an intimate picture of what a major tech company is really like. What strikes the reader is that Meta and its counterparts are merely the digital equivalents of the oil, mining and tobacco conglomerates of the analogue era. And they’re all US companies that have cosied up to Trump, which means that their interests are now inextricably intertwined with those of the American state.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Observed Free weekly newsletter Analysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writers Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It means, for example, that any attempt by the government to regulate Meta, X (née Twitter), Amazon et al will be regarded by Trump as an act of economic warfare.

        "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/",
        "content": "In Los Angeles, a strawberry – yes, one individual berry – is selling for $19.99. The berries are flown in from Japan, and Erewhon, a luxury grocery store, claims they’re so popular it’s hard to keep them in stock.\n\nThe $20 strawberry, which has been labeled “dystopian” and a “social experiment”, went viral after a TikTok influencer filmed herself eating it and saying “wow”. That video – produced by an influencer who happens to be part of the family that owns Erewhon– quickly sparked a slew of copycats: from earnest reviews to parodies and pranks and even an on-camera taste test by ABC news anchors. In one TikTok video, a comedian in a blond wig eats the strawberry while crooning to the “poors” watching his video: “This is something you could never afford … I’m going to taste it for you since you never will.”\n\nThe strawberry – absurdly priced, with what must be a staggering individual carbon footprint – seemed like an example of elite decadence so extreme that it could only be the product of an empire in decline.\n\nWhen I emailed one prominent scholar of the Roman empire about the strawberry, he referenced Petronius’ Satyricon, in which the nouveau-riche Trimalchio serves his Roman guests appetizers arranged in the form of zodiac signs, dormice rolled in poppyseeds and a roast boar filled with live birds.\n\nMy job as a journalist in this moment was clear: I needed to taste the strawberry myself, and I needed to ask more scholars if the $20 strawberry was a sign of the approaching fall of the American empire.\n\nView image in fullscreen Illustration: Hieronymus Bosch\n\nLuxury fruit\n\nHigh-end fruit has long been popular in Japan, where prized melons regularly cost hundreds of dollars and occasionally sell for tens of thousands. In 2016, a single bunch of Ruby Roman grapes sold for more than a million yen – about £270 a grape.\n\nErewhon, the only grocery store to have inspired both a Louis Vuitton perfume and a Balenciaga collection, is not the first to introduce this luxury fruit trend to Americans. Oishii, a company that grows Japanese strawberries in the US, made headlines six years ago for selling a $50 box of strawberries that became trendy with American chefs, who liked to use them as the perfect minimalist end to an ornate omakase meal.\n\nThe high-end fruit company Elly Amai said in a statement that its $20 berries “require a lot of skill and special techniques to grow” and, unlike berries in the US, “are meticulously monitored for quality and taste”.\n\n“The strawberries that don’t meet qualifications are not harvested by the farmers,” Elly Amai said, describing at least “two checkpoints” for the perfection of each berry, one in Japan by the farmer, and one when the berries arrive in the US.\n\nOther companies have also stepped up to ship luxury fruit from Japan directly to American consumers. Ikigai Fruits, which launched in 2023, sells “pearl white” Japanese strawberries that cost $128 a box, and extra-large “Bijinhime” strawberries that cost $258.\n\nTakeru Saito, a sales assistant at Ikigai Fruits, said the company had been founded in part to provide a boost to Japanese farmers, who have struggled to attract young people interested in taking over jobs that are labor-intensive and comparatively poorly paid. “The number of farmers is declining – and it’s an ageing population as well,” Saito said. A government report last year found that 80% of Japanese farmers were over age 60. By selling very-high-quality fruit to an international market, Saito said, “more farmers can make money”.\n\nIn Japan, Saito said, the appeal of luxury fruit is rooted in tradition: fancy produce is a traditional gift for weddings, job promotions and other ceremonial occasions. In the United States, the expensive fruits are more of a novelty. In a statement, Erewhon said that its $20 Elly Amai strawberries “are picked at their prime” in Japan and “hit the shelves at Erewhon within 28 to 48 hours”, which it described as “faster than broccoli growing in California getting to markets in New York”.\n\nFlying the berries to Los Angeles quickly enough to preserve their freshness “costs just as much as the fruits”, the grocery store said. It did not immediately respond to a question about the strawberries’ carbon footprint.\n\nView image in fullscreen Illustration: Hieronymus Bosch\n\nEerily perfect berries\n\nCalifornia farmers, who produce 90% of strawberries grown in the US, were selling strawberries in early March for about 10 to 14 cents each, according to estimates based on data from the California Strawberry Commission. That makes Erewhon strawberries flown in from Japan as much as 200 times as expensive as a local berry. Could they be 200 times as delicious?\n\nIt took me several days of calling Erewhon store locations to finally find one with the strawberry in stock. On a Thursday, an employee told me the berries might arrive in the early afternoon. I rushed to the store at 1 pm, and was rewarded with the sight of nearly 50 single berries arrayed on a shelf.\n\nEach strawberry rested on an individual pedestal, which resembles a small domed jewel case, or, as one TikToker put it, a stage. An explanatory plaque from Elly Amai promised “an explosion of flavor that elevates the ordinary strawberry to extraordinary heights”.\n\nView image in fullscreen Strawberries at Erewhon versus strawberries at a regular grocery store. Illustration: Guardian Design\n\nI found myself overwhelmed by the task of choosing one strawberry from the crowded shelf. Given the price tag, it felt like less a supermarket purchase than the start of a relationship. Which of these eerily perfect berries was the right one to bring into my life?\n\nThe Onion had just published a satirical headline about Erewhon claiming the $19 strawberry was “designed to be split”, but I took that idea seriously. As a naturally frugal person forced to consume Erewhon products for my job, I decided the $20 strawberry had to be divided between at least three people.\n\nI let the berry reach room temperature, as Elly Amai recommended, and then carefully transported it to a friend’s house, along with a control group of cheap supermarket strawberries that cost $4.99 for a box of 16.\n\nExamined close up, the contrast between the berries was startling. The $20 strawberry wasn’t any bigger than the cheap strawberries, but it looked very different. Its color was a uniform light red, and its skin was glossy. Each pore around each of its seeds looked smooth and firm, as if it had just emerged from a high-end fruit spa.\n\nI had lived in Los Angeles long enough to know that such beauty is not natural: this berry looked as if it had a personal trainer, a facialist and a team of dedicated stylists. The ordinary strawberry, in contrast, looked blotchy, its skin uneven and some of its pores swollen. Its leaves were long and disheveled.\n\nWe cut the $20 strawberry into eight slices, like a miniature cake. I popped one slice into my mouth. It was sweet, firm, neither too crunchy nor overripe. “This is the platonic strawberry,” I admitted.\n\nWe tried the ordinary strawberry next, but we might not have bothered: despite its deep red color, it tasted crisp and unripe, without much strawberry essence.\n\nWe went back to eating our minuscule slivers of luxury strawberry, and riffing to each other on how to describe the taste. “It’s kind of like a dog breed – it’s been cultivated to be perfect over hundreds of generations,” my friend said.\n\nThe more we ate, the more unsettled we felt: there was something uncanny about the flavor of the $20 strawberry, as if the process of perfecting a natural thing had been pushed past the point of human enjoyment. As my friend noted, it was impossible to taste this perfect strawberry without thinking about the hundreds or thousands of imperfect strawberries that had been discarded along the way.\n\nIn the past, we had usually eaten at least a handful of strawberries at a time, and the variations in flavor were part of the experience: one berry was more ripe, one less ripe, one a little squishy, one very sweet. As children, the surprise of each berry was mesmerizing, and even as adults it carried some nostalgic pleasure.\n\nIt felt a little sad, in the end, to eat just one strawberry and to know that each bite would be exactly and perfectly the same. The experience, my friend said, felt more like sniffing a Le Labo perfume than eating a piece of fruit.\n\nBut what about Rome?\n\nNow that I had tasted the $20 strawberry, I still need to understand whether it was, in fact, a sign of cultural decadence so extreme that it might lead to an empire’s fall.\n\nI emailed Michael Kulikowski, a Penn State University classics professor. He had good news: the reason many people associated the fall of the Roman empire with cultural decadence, he said, was that most people knew only a few things about Rome, including that it was very decadent, and that it fell. In fact, he said, Rome’s most famously decadent periods came “300 years earlier” than the fall of the western Roman empire, at a time of imperial power, not imperial decline.\n\nBryan Ward-Perkins, an Oxford historian and the author of The Fall of Rome and the End of Civilization, made a similar point: the Satyricon, “the great literary testimony to Roman extravagant decadence”, was written in the first century AD, “when things were going very well”.\n\nUnfortunately, Kulikowski said, there were other signs that the American empire might be nearing its fall.\n\nKulikowski argues that one reason the western Roman empire fell in 476, while the Byzantine, or eastern Roman empire, survived, was because the “1%” of the western Roman empire grew so powerful that they did not need a state to function.\n\n“They can withhold their taxes. When push comes to shove, they can raise their own private armies,” he said. In the eastern Roman empire, in contrast, the aristocracy was weaker, and they still found value in supporting the bureaucracy of the state.\n\nThis was bad news for the current American empire: “We have reached a very late Roman western state where the 1% does not need the state to survive,” Kulikowski said. “If the US government stops being able to do much of anything, it stops to matter to them. That’s a real parallel.”\n\nThe $20 strawberry did not concern him, but the coming effects of Trump’s tariffs did: “A better sign of the fall of the American empire will be when [in a week or two] a pint of strawberries is $12 at the mid-market supermarket,” Kulikowski told me.\n\nAs someone who does not think about the Roman empire very often, I found this analysis upsetting. I could only hope that future historians would get it right: whatever came next in the wreckage of empire, the $20 strawberry was not to blame.\n\n",

        "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/",
        "content": "The prevailing sensation while watching El Chavo del Ocho is to wonder how this thing ever got made in the first place. It’s a low-budget Mexican sitcom that ran from the 70s to the 90s, centred on an eight-year-old orphan who lives in a barrel in an apartment complex. The boy is played by Roberto Gómez Bolaños, who was in his 40s when the series began and his 60s when it ended. Pretty much all the humour is derived from slapstick: situational farce, physical jokes, people getting their heads trapped in buckets. That kind of thing.\n\nTry to imagine ChuckleVision gone global, to the point where it was a genuine cultural touchstone for hundreds of millions, to the point where Paul and Barry Chuckle have a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame and are unable to walk through Manhattan without being mobbed. That’s El Chavo. Even today it remains one of the most famous comic creations in the history of television: syndicated across the Americas, enthralling successive generations long after it was decommissioned. Including – at some point in early 2000s Uruguay – a young Darwin Núñez.\n\nEl Chavo del Ocho (The Kid at No 8) is Núñez’s favourite TV programme. Naturally, I have my own theories about this. El Chavo – whose real name is never revealed – is a clumsy, oversized agent of chaos, often entirely oblivious to the mayhem he creates, pursued wherever he goes by comedy sound effects but possessed of an essential purity, a credulity, a heart of gold and a homespun wisdom that makes it impossible not to root for him, even when he’s doing incredibly stupid things. El Chavo, meet thine real-life avatar. His name is Darwin.\n\nOften you will hear it said that Núñez divides opinion. In fact the basic outline of Núñez is pretty much a consensus view at this point: entertaining, endearing and erratic, a richly talented player for whom Liverpool paid slightly over the odds, and who probably needs to be replaced with someone more reliable sooner rather than later. We can pretty much all agree on that. In a sense, there is perhaps no player who divides opinion less than Núñez.\n\nView image in fullscreen A mural to the character Don Ramón from El Chavo del Ocho in Montevideo, Uruguay. Photograph: Raúl Martínez/EPA\n\nWhat people are really talking about when they talk about Núñez dividing opinion is his inconsistency. The spectacular finishes, the spectacular misses and the vague whiff of slapstick that seems to follow him wherever he goes. There was a moment during Tuesday’s Champions League last‑16 second leg against Paris Saint-Germain when Núñez out-sprinted Luis Díaz in pursuit of Virgil van Dijk’s long ball, only to remember about the potential offside flag and start running away from it, with Díaz already having stopped. It’s the 81st minute. You’re 1-0 down. And now, for the first time in your life, you decide to worry about offside?\n\nThe orthodox view of Núñez’s Liverpool career is that he is simply a poor fit for what Arne Slot is trying to do: a cat trapped in a grand piano, a maverick in a team seeking immaculate control, of emotions as well as the ball. Virtually all his metrics are significantly down from the Jürgen Klopp era: goals, expected goals, expected assists, key passes, dribbles, touches, shots and shots on target. This season Liverpool perform a goal a game worse when he is on the pitch than when he is not. A big Liverpool clearout is expected this summer and the word is they will listen to a serious offer for Núñez.\n\nAnd so to Wembley on Sunday and a game that feels – for Núñez and Núñez alone – like a kind of last chance. Núñez may not start the Carabao Cup final against Newcastle. Diogo Jota could easily slot in up front; Díaz has intermittently impressed as a false No 9. At some point, whether it is for 90 minutes or 90 seconds, the skies will darken and Núñez will make his appearance: a one-man forcefield, a player who somehow bends the waves of the game around him.\n\nHe was born into poverty, suffered a cruciate injury at the age of 19 that put him out of the game for a year and a half and convinced him he would never kick a ball again. If there is any kind of vulnerability there, it is one driven by pure hunger, the high-stakes caprice of a man who still expects nothing good to last long, who will make every moment count or die trying.\n\nThere is one metric in which he has significantly improved this season: tackles and interceptions. With his minutes restricted, Núñez has tried to make every single one count. His goals against Brentford, Southampton and Aston Villa have been crucial in the title challenge. And for all the focus on his missed penalty in the shootout against PSG this week, his contribution to Harvey Elliott’s winning goal in the first leg has been almost forgotten.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Football Daily Free daily newsletter Kick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of football Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Photograph: Ryan Browne/Shutterstock\n\nLargely, you suspect, this is an issue of personal branding. Signed in the wake of Erling Haaland joining Manchester City, Núñez quickly found himself fitted for the role of talisman, immediately judged by goals and goals alone. Roberto Firmino, the man he partially replaced, went 13 league games without scoring in the 2019-20 title-winning season and it was fine. Núñez has never gone that long without a goal in his life and yet the perception persists – fuelled by a projection of the player people want him to be rather than the player he is – that he is some kind of gilded failure.\n\nHe misses big chances. But so does Haaland, so does Ollie Watkins, so does any striker with the faith to put himself about, to make the right runs, to try. The Premier League has only been collecting “big chance” data since 2010 but in that time the three players with the most big misses are Mohamed Salah, Harry Kane and Sergio Agüero. Maybe we need to chill out a bit about the missing, particularly in a team evidently scoring more than enough for now.\n\nIs El Chavo del Ocho a comedy or a tragedy? On first viewing, El Chavo is quite clearly a ridiculous comic figure. But, of course, over time, you begin to suspend your disbelief, to invest in the story, to embed yourself in the universe the writers created. He, too, grew up in poverty, was forsaken and ridiculed, and yet despite spending most of his time in a barrel has made himself a viable life, a reason to get up in the morning, a network of friends. For all the mishaps and chaos, the bonds between them endure.\n\nThe real business of any football club is not the pursuit of numbers but the pursuit of memories. Divock Origi is still remembered fondly for the big goals he scored and Sunday’s final offers a similar chance for Núñez to write himself into the club’s folklore. He may have been signed on his numbers, but will bequeath only memories. His Liverpool future may well be beyond his control. But his legacy is not.",

The new crew were scheduled to arrive early on Sunday at about 3.30am GMT, and Williams and Wilmore – along with Nasa astronaut Nick Hague and Russian cosmonaut Aleksandr Gorbunov – are expected to return to Earth on Wednesday.\n\nThe mission became entangled in controversy after President Donald Trump and his adviser Elon Musk, who is also SpaceX’s CEO, claimed without evidence that former president Joe Biden had abandoned Williams and Wilmore on the station for political reasons. The two astronauts rejected this accusation.\n\nThey arrived at the ISS in June 2024 on a Starliner spacecraft built by Boeing, an aerospace rival to SpaceX. Nasa planned to return the two astronauts to Earth on the craft until problems were found with some of its thrusters, which would have played a crucial role in slowing down the spacecraft before re-entry into the Earth’s atmosphere.\n\nLeaks of helium from the craft’s propulsion system were also discovered, and Nasa chose not to risk using Starliner to take Williams and Wilmore back to Earth. Instead, the empty spaceship was undocked from the ISS and flown back for an automated, parachute-assisted landing in the New Mexico desert while the two astronauts were kept aboard the ISS to await a flight home on a scheduled crew rotation mission, even though this meant keeping them in orbit for months.\n\nWilliams this month told reporters that she was looking forward to returning home to her family and two dogs. “It’s been a rollercoaster for them, probably a little bit more than for us,” she said.",

        "content": "Restaurant owners are abandoning the age-old “customer is always right” maxim because too many diners try to get freebies through threats, making malicious complaints and underhand tricks.\n\nAndrew Sheridan, cited as “one of the finest chefs north Wales has ever produced”, said he was tired of customers “trying it on”.\n\n“It happens all the time,” he said. “Last week, it was a woman complaining about a golden pillar that had apparently obstructed her view.\n\n“She said she’d had a lovely meal, with great wine and friendly service but the pillar - a steel structure that stops a Grade II building from falling down which no one has ever complained about before - spoiled her evening to the extent that she wanted a free meal and vouchers,” he said.\n\nThe demand is on a par with another Sheridan received from customers that he pay the fine they incurred by driving in a bus lane en route to his restaurant. “They said our website should have warned people not to drive in it,” he said.\n\nSheridan also cites a family who demanded a free meal because they were not happy with the quality of the roads leading to the restaurant, despite the roads being owned by the council. Others have demanded money back from restaurant gift vouchers.\n\nWhile being careful to discriminate between constructive and destructive criticism, Sheridan has now had enough.\n\n“Everyone is a restaurant critic now and online reviews have given them a mass audience to vent if their personal preferences haven’t been met, regardless of whether that’s fair.\n\n“I recently asked customers to get out halfway through their meal,” said Sheridan, who added his attitude changed last year after being blackmailed by criminals who threatened to flood his restaurants’ online listings with fake one-star reviews until Sheridan paid thousands of pounds.\n\n“They arrived complaining that the location of the restaurant wasn’t right on Google Maps, which it is,” he said. “Then they complained about the lighting, then the style of the plates and then the food.”\n\nSheridan is now unmoved by threats to post bad reviews. “Five years ago, chefs used to be really worried when people wrote bad reviews, but now chefs are increasingly saying that the customer isn’t always right,” he said.\n\n“I respond to every unfair, bad online review, explaining why it’s unreasonable.”\n\nSheridan is supportive of Chris D’Sylva, the owner of the renowned Notting Hill bistro Dorian, who this week said he was so tired of complaining customers that he now reviews them.\n\n“Everything gets marked,” D’Sylva said. “Good behaviours and not favourable behaviours get noted on the … tiered system whereby we rank how much we like the customer and the value of the customer, or the destructiveness of the customer.”\n\nView image in fullscreen Michelin star chef Ben Murphy says rising prices have been a factor for why customers expect freebies from restaurants Photograph: Mark Parren Taylor\n\nBen Murphy, the Michelin star chef who won National Chef of the Year, believes the “bond of trust” has broken between restaurants and their customers: “You don’t hear that thing about the customer always being right any more,” he said. “There has definitely been a change in the dynamics.”\n\nMurphy reevaluated the “customer is always right” maxim after a customer slipped clingfilm on to her plate and demanded to be given her meal for free.\n\n“We were really apologetic and had no choice but to comp her entire meal but something didn’t feel right,” said Murphy. “That night, I spent two hours watching the CCTV of her meal and saw her taking the clingfilm out of her bag.\n\n“I’ve also had a customer blaming me for food poisoning, which also turned out to be completely false,” he added.\n\nMurphy said rising prices had proved a tipping point. “There’s definitely been a corresponding rise in customers trying to get freebies,” he said.\n\nStefan Chomka, the editor of the Restaurant magazine, agreed that the bond of trust has been strained by the rise of social media reviewing platforms.\n\n“The balance of power has shifted towards customers, who can now publicly voice their opinions, which can be both beneficial and damaging for businesses,” he said. “But chefs are pushing back against false negative reviews, especially during these tough economic times.”\n\nChomka added that the balance of power had got out of kilter: “Until fairly recently, chefs often had a ‘my way or the highway’ attitude towards customers: not letting customers use salt and pepper, not accepting dietary requirements,” he said. “High-end dining rooms often maintained a strict hierarchy where customers were treated as inferior.”\n\nOisin Rogers, the landlord of The Devonshire in Soho in London, however, still sticks to the “customer is always right” adage. “I absolutely do because if you start off with the vibe of, ‘You’ve got to work within our rules, and we don’t like it if you do this or that’, you’re not going to make people feel wonderful, are you?” he said.\n\n“If customers complain, we have to understand that sometimes people have bad days, and sometimes people don’t understand what you’re doing – and that’s totally their prerogative because they’re already investing their time and their precious money in coming to to see us.\n\n“Essentially, it’s way better to be optimistic and occasionally wrong than to be pessimistic and sometimes correct.”",

        "content": "Cuba’s national electrical grid collapsed late on Friday, leading to widespread blackouts in Havana and across the country and leaving millions of people in the dark.\n\nOfficials from the energy and mines ministry said an electrical substation in the capital failed about 8.15pm local time knocking out power to a large swath of western Cuba, including Havana, and causing the failure of the national electrical system, SEN.\n\nThe lights were out across all of Havana’s waterfront skyline, a Reuters witness observed, with only a scattered few tourist hotels operating on generators.\n\nReports on social media from outlying provinces both east and west of the capital city suggested much of the Caribbean island nation of 10 million people was without power. Internet service was also affected.\n\nPeople in provinces as far away as Guantánamo, Artemisa, Santiago de Cuba and Santa Clara reported experiencing blackouts with just flickers of light.\n\nThe energy ministry said on X that it was “working on the recovery process”.\n\nView image in fullscreen Residents walk on a Havana street during the outage. Photograph: Ramón Espinosa/AP\n\nEarlier the Electric Union, the state agency that regulates the sector, said in its daily report that peak-hour demand would be about 3,250 megawatts and the deficit would reach around 1,380MW, meaning 42% of the national energy system would be shut down. This figure is not the highest in recent memory.\n\nThe grid failure follows a string of nationwide blackouts late last year that plunged Cuba’s frail and antiquated power generation system into near-total disarray, stressed by fuel shortages, natural disaster and an economic crisis.\n\nHours-long rolling blackouts have been the norm for months, with more than half of the country experiencing power cuts during peak hours. In many parts of the island, electricity is crucial for cooking and water pumping.\n\nSevere shortages of food, medicine and water have made life increasingly unbearable for many Cubans, who in recent years have left the island in record-breaking numbers.\n\nAuthorities on the island have begun a program to install photovoltaic parks and promised that dozens of them will be ready this year. Blackouts previously prompted anti-government demonstrations in 2021, 2022, and 2024.\n\nWith Associated Press",

        "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/",
        "content": "More than 50 days into Donald Trump’s second administration and his Department of Defense is already rapidly transforming into the image of its secretary, Pete Hegseth.\n\nNow, many of the rants and opinions common during Hegseth’s Fox News career are coming to policy fruition in his new Pentagon.\n\nHegseth inaugurated himself by scolding his Nato allies and confirming the US would never accept Ukraine into the alliance. Then his Pentagon immediately made leadership changes targeting women and people of color. He oversaw total deletions of all diversity, equity and inclusion programs, all the while slashing whole sections of the military overseeing civilian harm reduction in theatres of combat.\n\nCombining all of that with his connections to Christian nationalism and a pastor who said slavery brought “affection between the races” has led to calls from former defense department officials that the new secretary is actively damaging his own agency.\n\n“What are we seeing in the Pentagon right now? What are we hearing about the future of warfare? What are we hearing about the transformation that is necessary, right now, as we come out of the last two decades of warfighting?” said the retired brigadier general Paul Eaton, a veteran of the Iraq war. “We’re hearing of DEI purging.”\n\nEaton continued: “We’re hearing about taking a Black four-star out of the seniormost position in the armed forces of the United States; a female four-star removed, who was the first chief of naval operations; a four-star female taken out of the coast guard.”\n\nIn any national military, fighting cohesion and faith in the chain of command is paramount. But Eaton says Hegseth is a “Saturday showman on Fox News” unfit for the office he occupies and has undermined his troops at every turn.\n\nEaton explained that mass firings and transgender bans have distracted from learning lessons from the war in Ukraine and the coming global conflict many inside the Pentagon have been predicting for years. Most of all, Hegseth’s focus on culture war is actively neglecting the “warfighters” he constantly invokes.\n\n“What we’re seeing is nibbling around the edges of a culture with a dominant theme that does nothing to prepare the armed forces of the United States to meet its next peer or near peer opponent,” said Eaton.\n\nSecretary Hegseth risks alienating and undermining the women who currently serve Caroline Zier, ex-deputy chief of staff to Lloyd Austin\n\nIn a period where the Pentagon has struggled to meet recruitment numbers, Hegseth’s dismissal of top female officers and his historical attitude towards gender is not making enlistment a top attraction among women.\n\n“Comments that question the qualifications and accomplishments of women in uniform are deeply disrespectful of the sacrifices these service members and their families have made for our country,” said Caroline Zier, the former deputy chief of staff to the last secretary of defense, Lloyd J Austin III, and a VoteVets senior policy adviser. “Secretary Hegseth risks alienating and undermining the women who currently serve, while decreasing the likelihood that other women look to join the military at exactly the moment when we need all qualified recruits.”\n\nHegseth’s office also had social sciences and DEI research axed in a memo announced in early March. The cost cutting measure will save $30m a year in Pentagon funding of internal studies, “on global migration patterns, climate change impacts, and social trends”.\n\nIn a post on X, Hegseth said: “[DoD] does not do climate change crap. We do training and warfighting.” Those comments match up with his complaint that under the Biden administration the military somehow weakened soldier standards and focused its efforts away from fighting wars in favor of adopting liberal subcultures.\n\n“The truth is the United States military is the most lethal fighting force in the history of the world, and the Department of Defense never took its eye off warfighting and meritocracy,” said Zier. “I saw that up close over the course of 15 years working at the Department of Defense, across administrations.”\n\nTough talk about “warfighting” and “lethality” has also followed an obsession within the Trump administration with special forces units – the types that carry out drone strikes or a mission such as the one that killed Osama Bin Laden in 2011. Hegseth and Trump, for example, were dogged defenders of Eddie Gallagher, a Navy Seal pardoned by Trump for war crimes in Iraq.\n\nBut special operations missions, especially when they have led to civilian carnage, have the propensity to create enemies across the globe if unneeded collateral damage occurs. Which is why new and evolving watchdog policies governing how covert actions are carried out were adopted across the Obama, Trump and Biden administrations of the past. By 2023, Austin instituted new orders surrounding civilian harm mitigation.\n\nBut Hegseth has closed the Pentagon’s Civilian Harm Mitigation and Response office and the Civilian Protection Center of Excellence, which both handled training and procedures critical in limiting civilian harm in theatres of war. Coupled with plans to overhaul the judge advocate general’s corps to remake the rules of war governing the US military, all signs point to a Pentagon more prone to tragic mistakes.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to This Week in Trumpland Free newsletter A deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administration Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Part of that included criticisms of abandoning allies, and yet Hegseth’s time at the top of the Pentagon has coincided with the unprecedented undermining of global alliances – suspending things such as offensive cyber missions countering Russia – which has blemished confidence in military interoperability and intelligence sharing.\n\nUkraine, at risk of becoming the new Afghan government cutoff from American military support, is fighting for its national survival against a superior Russian force.\n\nIn early March, the Pentagon froze critical intelligence and weapons packages as Trump repostured the US position on the conflict. That kind of uncertainty has borne real fears on the ground of the most deadly war in Europe since the second world war.\n\n“I think the Ukrainians and all of us working here regardless of nationality, are anxious about what the future of US support looks like,” said a former US marine currently living in Ukraine and working on defense technologies near the frontlines. “We’re all hoping that the US will do the right thing and provide the Ukrainians the tools they need to end this war and secure their future.”\n\nBut so far, Hegseth has instead shown he’s turning the Pentagon’s gaze toward the border in Mexico, another obsession during his time on air, for the first time in over a century and to the containment of China. Ukraine, Nato and the many Pentagon cuts are in the backseat.\n\nThe Pentagon did not respond to several emails with a detailed list of questions about Hegseth’s personal impact on policy making on the department he leads.",

        "content": "Gravity may seem like a drag, but spending long periods of time without its grounding force can wreak havoc on your body. On Friday, Nasa and SpaceX will launch the space agency’s Crew-10 mission to the International Space Station to retrieve astronauts Barry “Butch” Wilmore and Suni Williams, after what was meant to be an eight-day stay turned into nine months.\n\nWhile it is not the most time a human has spent as an extraterrestrial – Oleg Kononenko and Nikolai Chub hold the record, with 374 days – most long space missions are a maximum of six months.\n\nSo what happens to a person’s body – and mind – back on earth?\n\nGravity\n\nThe lack of gravity causes significant, and irreparable, bone density loss. It also causes muscles to waste in your arms, legs, trunk and elsewhere, including your heart, which, because it doesn’t have to pump blood against gravity, has to work much less hard.\n\nYour blood volume shrinks, and the way your blood flows changes – it slows in some areas, which can lead to clots. Fluids also don’t come down, or drain, as easily.\n\nIn space, explained Alan Duffy, an astrophysicist at Swinburne University: “Fluids build up in their heads, to they feel like they have a constant cold.” Olfactory senses are also diminished, “which is probably a good thing, by the way, because it reeks up there,” he said, of an aircraft after two decades of visitors and no windows thrown open.\n\nOn the plus side, when they return, they will likely feel like they have finally kicked a nine-month cold. They’ll also struggle to walk, get dizzy easily, and have bad eyesight.\n\nThe build up of fluid also changes the shape of their eyeballs, and weakens their vision, he said. This is why often you see astronauts wearing spectacles on board, though they’ve started with perfect vision. This tends to mostly go back to normal, though they may need glasses for the rest of their lives, said Duffy.\n\n“The brain becomes waterlogged,” said Meng Law, professor and director of radiology, neuroscience at Monash University. The Russian cosmonauts had a device, a bit like a wetsuit, that would suck the fluid and blood away from the brain, he said.\n\nToday, Space X and Nasa are working on centrifuges that astronauts could sleep in, which would spin fluid out of their heads, said Law.\n\nWhen they return, their reconditioning is similar to the intense physiotherapy that anyone who has come out of a coma will have been put through, said Duffy.\n\nIt is also very tiring, said Brad Tucker, an astrophysicist at Australian National University, which can contribute to the psychological impacts of returning. So the team of doctors has to strike a balance between strengthening the astronauts and not tiring them out.\n\nTheir return “is itself a research project”, said Duffy. It can help inform how to treat patients on earth who suffer from conditions that involve long stays in hospital –living without gravity has many of the same impacts as being bedridden. Because most research so far is based on six-month stays, Wilmore and Williams will be especially interesting to their team of doctors and scientists.\n\nOne more really surprising challenge, Duffy said, was that because clothing floats off your skin, your skin gets “almost baby-like sensitivity”. Back on earth, some astronauts feel like their clothing is sandpaper.\n\nRadiation\n\nPerhaps the most dangerous impact of extended stays in space is being exposed to radiation, which can increase the risk of cancers and rare cancers. Earth’s atmosphere and magnetic field shield us from high levels of radiation, but in space, people don’t have that protection.\n\n“Not only will astronauts be exposed to more radiation in space than on Earth,” according to Nasa, “but the radiation they are exposed to could pose increased risks.”\n\nAccording to Nasa, astronauts are exposed to three sources of radiation. These include particles trapped in the earth’s magnetic field, solar energetic particles from the sun, and finally galactic cosmic rays. The National Oceanic And Atmospheric Administration Space Weather Prediction Center describes these as: “the slowly varying, highly energetic background source of energetic particles that constantly bombard Earth” from outside our solar system, “likely formed by explosive events such as supernova”.\n\nHow to protect people against space radiation is one of the problems that scientists are trying to solve as we prepare to send people to Mars or the Moon for longer periods.\n\nBecause astronauts tend not to have an obligation to participate in studies once they retire, little is known about how this radiation might impact them later in life, said Tucker. So Williams and Wilmore, who are at the end of their careers, might also offer useful research in this area.\n\n‘The overview effect’\n\n“For anyone who’s been stranded in the wrong airport for a day or two, wanting to get home – imagine you’ve been able to see home that entire time,” Duffy said. Then consider that lasting for nine months. “These people are truly astonishing in terms of their resilience,” he said.\n\nBut on returning, anxiety – the result of having been in extreme conditions for so long – and depression are common, said Tucker.\n\nThe pair may also experience something called “the overview effect”. Seeing the curvature of the earth, and seeing it from above – as its own kind of space ship, said Duffy – has led some astronauts to report an incredible connection to humanity, an immediate sense of its fragility.\n\n“Some people call it a feeling of inspiration. Some people call it feelings of inadequacy in terms of just how big the world is,” said Tucker.\n\nAnd then they have to come back down to earth, both literally and figuratively. “They have to make breakfast and they have to drive to work,” said Tucker. “It is a huge transition from living in a very inspiring environment.”",

        "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/",
        "content": "The red tape of government bureaucracy spans more than 4,000 years, according to new finds from the cradle of the world’s civilisations, Mesopotamia.\n\nHundreds of administrative tablets – the earliest physical evidence of the first empire in recorded history – have been discovered by archaeologists from the British Museum and Iraq. These texts detail the minutiae of government and reveal a complex bureaucracy – the red tape of an ancient civilisation.\n\nThese were the state archives of the ancient Sumerian site of Girsu, modern-day Tello, while the city was under the control of the Akkad dynasty from 2300 to 2150BC.\n\n“It’s not unlike Whitehall,” said Sébastien Rey, the British Museum’s curator for ancient Mesopotamia and director of the Girsu Project. “These are the spreadsheets of empire, the very first material evidence of the very first empire in the world – the real evidence of the imperial control and how it actually worked.”\n\nGirsu, one of the world’s oldest cities, was revered in the 3rd millennium BC as the sanctuary of the Sumerian heroic god Ningirsu. Covering hundreds of hectares at its peak, it was among independent Sumerian cities conquered around 2300BC by the Mesopotamian king Sargon. He originally came from the city of Akkad, whose location is still unknown but is thought to have been near modern Baghdad.\n\nRey said: “Sargon developed this new form of governance by conquering all the Sumerian cities of Mesopotamia, creating what most historians call the first empire in the world.” He added that, until these latest excavations, information on that empire was limited to fragmentary and bombastic royal inscriptions or much later copies of Akkadian inscriptions “which are not completely reliable”.\n\nOf the new discovery, he said: “It is extremely important because, for the first time, we have concrete evidence – with artefacts in situ.” He has been astonished by the detail in those records: “They note absolutely everything down. If a sheep dies at the very edge of the empire, it will be noted. They are obsessed with bureaucracy.” The tablets, containing cuneiform symbols, an early writing system, record affairs of state, deliveries and expenditures, on everything from fish to domesticated animals, flour to barley, textiles to precious stones.\n\nView image in fullscreen The tablets were found at the site of a large state archive building, made of mud-brick walls and divided into rooms or offices. Photograph: Alberto Giannese/The Girsu Project/British Museum\n\nDana Goodburn-Brown, a British-American conservator, is cleaning the tablets so that they can be transcribed. The work is both painstaking and exciting, she said: “People just think things come out of the ground and look like you see them in the museum, but they don’t.”\n\nOne tablet lists different commodities: “250 grams of gold / 500 grams of silver/ … fattened cows… / 30 litres of beer.” Even the names and professions of the citizens are recorded, Rey said: “Women, men, children – we have names for everyone.\n\n“Women held important offices within the state. So we have high priestesses, for example, although it was a society very much led by men. But the role of the woman was at least higher than many other societies, and it’s undeniable based on the evidence that we have.”\n\nThe jobs listed range from stone-cutters to the sweeper of the temple floor. Rey said: “Being able to sweep the floor where the gods and the high priest were located was very important. The cities of ancient Mesopotamia in theory all belonged to the gods. The society worked for the temple state.”\n\nThe tablets were found at the site of a large state archive building, made of mud-brick walls and divided into rooms or offices. Some of the tablets contain architectural plans of buildings, field plans and maps of canals.\n\nThe finds were made by archaeologists at the Girsu Project, a collaboration between the British Museum and the Iraqi government’s State Board of Antiquities and Heritage, funded by Meditor Trust, a charitable foundation.\n\nThe site was originally excavated in the 19th and early 20th centuries and was targeted by looters after the two Gulf wars: “Tablets of the Akkad period were either looted or carelessly removed from their archaeological setting and thus decontextualised. So it was very difficult to understand how the administration worked.\n\n“The key thing now is that we were able to excavate them properly within their archaeological context. The new finds were preserved in situ, so in their original context, and we can say for sure that we have indeed the very first physical evidence of imperial control in the world. This is completely new.”\n\nThe finds have been sent to the Iraq Museum in Baghdad for further study, ahead of a possible loan to the British Museum.\n\nThe Akkadian empire lasted for only about 150 years, ending with a rebellion that secured the city’s independence.",

        "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/",
        "content": "The current fragile pause in hostilities in Gaza has come under further threat with Hamas hardening its negotiating positions amid new Israeli airstrikes in the devastated territory.\n\nThe first phase of the ceasefire agreement ended two weeks ago but Israel is refusing to implement the scheduled second phase, which is supposed to end with its withdrawal from Gaza, the freedom of all remaining hostages held by Hamas, and a definitive end to the conflict.\n\nCurrently, both sides have refrained from returning to war, though Israel has conducted an intensifying series of airstrikes in Gaza that have killed dozens of Palestinians.\n\nIsraeli military officials say the victims are legitimate targets who had entered unauthorised areas, engaged in militant activities or otherwise violated the truce.\n\nOn Saturday, two airstrikes targeted northern Gaza killing nine people, according to unconfirmed local reports.\n\nInitial reports said a first strike took place as a Palestinian journalist Mahmoud Aslim was using a drone in the ruined town of Beit Lahiya to survey potential sites for tented camps on behalf of a local charitable organisation. A second strike targeted a car as it evacuated those injured by the first attack.\n\nThe Palestinian Journalists’ Protection Center, a local watchdog, said the dead included three Palestinian journalists in all.\n\nThe Israeli military said it initially struck two people operating a drone that posed a threat to soldiers in the area, then launched another strike at a group of people who came to collect the drone equipment. The army identified all of those targeted as suspected militants, without providing evidence.\n\nHamas accused Israel of “deliberate killings” that aimed “to undermine the ceasefire agreement and deliberately destroy any chance of completing the agreement and exchanging prisoners, in a blatant challenge to the mediators and the international community”.\n\nThe Ministry of Health in Gaza reported that Israeli fire had killed 19 people in the past 48 hours. The death toll in the 15-month Israeli offensive in Gaza now totals more than 48,500, mostly civilians. Hamas still has 59 hostages, of whom 35 are believed to be dead.\n\nIn a statement, Hamas clarified an offer to release a living American-Israeli hostage, saying it would only hand over 21-year-old Edan Alexander if Israel implements the ceasefire agreement which came into effect in January.\n\nThe US has already rebuffed the offer, made on Friday, and accused the Islamist militant organisation of “stalling” by making “impractical” demands.\n\nAlexander, who grew up in the US and was fighting as a soldier in the Israeli Defense Forces, was abducted from his military base during Hamas’s 7 October 2023 attack that killed 1,200, mostly civilians, and triggered the war. He is the last living US citizen held in Gaza.\n\n\n\nThere was no immediate comment from Israel on the new statement from Hamas. On Friday, the office of the prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, accused the group of “psychological warfare”.\n\n\n\nThe US said it presented on Wednesday a proposal to extend the ceasefire for several weeks to allow the negotiation of a permanent truce. It said Hamas was claiming flexibility in public while privately making “entirely impractical” demands.\n\n\n\nThe indirect talks, which are being held in Egypt and Qatar, are expected to continue during the coming week.\n\nFor two weeks, Israel has barred the delivery of food, fuel and other supplies to Gaza’s roughly 2 million Palestinians, and cut electricity to the territory a week ago, to pressure Hamas to accept the new proposal.\n\n\n\nHamas however said on Saturday that it would only release hostages if Israel lifted its blockade, withdrew from a strategic corridor along Gaza’s border with Egypt and freed more Palestinian prisoners.\n\n\n\nThe war has destroyed vast areas of Gaza and displaced most of the population.\n\n\n\nThe ceasefire’s first phase included the release of 25 Israeli hostages and the bodies of eight others in exchange for nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners. Israeli forces pulled back to a buffer zone along Gaza’s border and allowed a surge of humanitarian aid.\n\n\n\n",

        "title": "Judge blocks Trump from using 18th-century wartime act for deportations",
        "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/",
        "content": "Donald Trump has invoked the wartime Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to deport five Venezuelan nationals from the US.\n\nIn a presidential proclamation issued on Saturday, the White House said: “Tren de Aragua (TdA) is a designated Foreign Terrorist Organization with thousands of members, many of whom have unlawfully infiltrated the United States and are conducting irregular warfare and undertaking hostile actions against the United States.”\n\nThe invocation of the wartime act comes just hours before a federal judge temporarily blocked Trump’s administration from using the 1798 Act to carry out its intended deportations of the Venezuelans.\n\nOn Saturday, US district judge James Boasberg of the federal district court in Washington DC agreed to issue temporary restraining order that prevents the Venezuelans’ deportation for 14 days.\n\n“Given the exigent circumstances that it [the court] has been made aware of this morning, it has determined that an immediate Order is warranted to maintain the status quo until a hearing can be set,” Boasberg wrote in his order.\n\nBoasberg’s decision comes in response to a lawsuit filed the same day by the American Civil Liberties Union and Democracy Forward. The organizations charge that the Trump administration unlawfully invoked the Alien Enemies Act.\n\nIn the lawsuit, ACLU and Democracy Forward argue the act has been invoked only three times in the history of the US: the war of 1812, first world war and second world war.\n\n“It cannot be used here against nationals of a country – Venezuela – with whom the United States is not at war, which is not invading the United States and which has not launched a predatory incursion into the United States,” the lawsuit stated.\n\n“The government’s proclamation would allow agents to immediately put noncitizens on planes without any review of any aspect of the determination that they are alien enemies,” the lawsuit added.\n\nA remote hearing has been scheduled for today at 5pm before Boasberg. Both ACLU and Democracy Forward will ask that the temporary restraining order be broadened to everyone in danger of removal under the act, the civil liberties organizations said.\n\nThe president had previously ordered his administration to designate Venezuela’s Tren De Aragua gang as a foreign terrorist organization.\n\nWith Trump characterizing the gang as a foreign force that is invading the US, civil liberties organizations such as the ACLU fear that Trump may invoke the 1798 act “unlawfully during peacetime to accelerate mass deportations, sidestepping the limits of this wartime authority and the procedures and protections in immigration law.”\n\nThe invocation is expected to face legal challenges almost immediately. The 227-year-old law is designed to primarily be used in wartime, and only Congress has the authority to declare a war. But the president does have the discretion to invoke the law to defend against a “threatened or ongoing invasion or predatory incursion”, according to the Brennan Center for Justice, a non-partisan authority on law and policy.\n\n“This law shouldn’t be invoked because migration is not an invasion, and we’re not in a war time,” said Juliana Macedo do Nascimento, the deputy director of federal advocacy for United We Dream, an immigrant rights organization. “It’s extremely horrifying that we, as immigrants, are being labeled as terrorists, as invaders.”\n\nThose subject to the Alien Enemies Act could be deported without a court hearing or asylum interview, and their cases would be governed by wartime authority rather than by immigration law.\n\nThe Alien Enemies Act specifically allows the president to detain, relocate, or deport immigrants based on their country of ancestry – and crucially covers not only citizens of hostile nations but also “natives”, which could include people who may have renounced their foreign citizenship and sought legal residency in the US.\n\nThe centuries-old law was also used to arrest more than 31,000 people – mostly people of Japanese, German and Italian ancestry – as “alien enemies” during the second world war, and played a role in the mass removal and incarceration of Japanese Americans during the war.\n\nTrump has been building his case for invoking the act for years by characterizing the influx of migrants at the southern border as an “invasion”. He also previewed his invocation in an executive order on his inauguration day, directing the secretaries of state to plan by preparing facilities “necessary to expedite the removal” of those subject to the act.\n\n“By invoking the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, I will direct our government to use the full and immense power of federal and state law enforcement to eliminate the presence of all foreign gangs and criminal networks bringing devastating crime to US soil, including our cities and inner cities,” he said in his inaugural address.\n\nThough anti-immigrant politicians and groups have long advocated for the use of the act in response to unlawful border crossings, Macedo do Nascimento said a number of executive orders and congressional policies have already broadened the federal government’s authorities to detain and deport immigrants.\n\n“There are already laws that allow for mass detention. There are already laws, like the Laiken Riley Act, that would broaden the dragnet of people who can be detained,” Macedo do Nascimento said. “So the idea of him invoking the Alien Enemies Act feels kind of needless. To me, it is really about building the narrative to label immigrants as terrorists.”",

        "content": "A long-awaited mission to return stranded US astronauts Suni Williams and Butch Wilmore from the International Space Station has been launched by Nasa and SpaceX.\n\nThe pair were due to spend eight days on the ISS in June, but technical problems with the experimental spacecraft that took them there have left them stuck on the orbital laboratory for nine months.\n\nOn Friday night, a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket blasted off from Nasa’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida, carrying four astronauts who will replace Williams and Wilmore. The new crew were scheduled to arrive early on Sunday at about 3.30am GMT, and Williams and Wilmore – along with Nasa astronaut Nick Hague and Russian cosmonaut Aleksandr Gorbunov – are expected to return to Earth on Wednesday.\n\nThe mission became entangled in controversy after President Donald Trump and his adviser Elon Musk, who is also SpaceX’s CEO, claimed without evidence that former president Joe Biden had abandoned Williams and Wilmore on the station for political reasons. The two astronauts rejected this accusation.\n\nThey arrived at the ISS in June 2024 on a Starliner spacecraft built by Boeing, an aerospace rival to SpaceX. Nasa planned to return the two astronauts to Earth on the craft until problems were found with some of its thrusters, which would have played a crucial role in slowing down the spacecraft before re-entry into the Earth’s atmosphere.\n\nLeaks of helium from the craft’s propulsion system were also discovered, and Nasa chose not to risk using Starliner to take Williams and Wilmore back to Earth. Instead, the empty spaceship was undocked from the ISS and flown back for an automated, parachute-assisted landing in the New Mexico desert while the two astronauts were kept aboard the ISS to await a flight home on a scheduled crew rotation mission, even though this meant keeping them in orbit for months.\n\nWilliams this month told reporters that she was looking forward to returning home to her family and two dogs. “It’s been a rollercoaster for them, probably a little bit more than for us,” she said.",

        "title": "The big question on Ukraine: is Trump ready to push Putin into peace?",
        "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/",
        "content": "On paper, everyone is in agreement: Donald Trump says he wants a ­ceasefire; Kyiv’s ­negotiating team has already agreed to a 30-day ceasefire ­proposal at marathon talks with the Americans in Jeddah; and Vladimir Putin says he accepts the idea, albeit with a few “nuances”.\n\nBut Putin’s so-called nuances are bigger than mere wrinkles, and at the end of an intense week of diplomacy around Russia’s war in Ukraine, a ceasefire – never mind a sustainable peace – still looks to be something of a distant prospect.\n\nWhile Trump has proved very willing to pile the pressure on Volodymyr Zelenskyy, most ­visibly in their disastrous meeting in the White House two weeks ago, his ability or desire to force concessions out of Putin is less clear.\n\nIndeed, the only ­concession Trump publicly demanded from Putin last week was for the Russian president to spare the lives of ­“thousands of Ukrainian troops” supposedly surrounded by the Russian army – a battlefield ­situation first claimed by Putin, but which the Ukrainian army and ­independent military analysts said did not actually exist.\n\nPutin graciously agreed to ­consider Trump’s proposal – as long as the possibly imaginary Ukrainian troops surrendered first.\n\nThe whole exchange, along with Putin’s warm praise of Trump for “doing everything” to improve ­relations between Washington and Moscow, left the distinct impression that the experienced Kremlin leader is once again getting the better of his American counterpart.\n\n“Putin is very dangerous when he’s directly talking to Trump,” said the Kyiv-based political ­analyst Volodymyr Fesenko.\n\n“He knows how to charm him, how to give ­compliments. And he can tell Trump that these cunning Ukrainians are trying to trick you, and so on.” Putin’s trademark “yes, but” answer to the US ceasefire ­proposal was essentially a carefully packaged “no”, according to many Kremlin observers.\n\n“They are trying not to reject it fully, because it can spoil the ­relationship with Trump and ­complicate things, so they have to say ‘Yes, we agree, but…’ And then this ‘but’ makes it impossible,” said political analyst Tatiana Stanovaya.\n\nPutin is very dangerous when he’s directly talking to Trump. He knows how to charm him, how to give ­compliments.\n\nRussia has no interest in a ­ceasefire for the sake of it, she said, and is only interested in talks that would bring about a final ­settlement advantageous to the Kremlin. “Russians don’t want a ceasefire unconditionally – they have been saying it for a long time,” she said.\n\nAccording to Stanovaya, Putin still believes there is a “real Ukraine” that exists in parallel to Zelenskyy and other supposed radicals in Kyiv, and that these real Ukrainians want good relations with Russia.\n\n“They are not saying it explicitly, but the idea is that with Ukraine as it is now, with Zelenskyy in power, there won’t be a deal, there will be nothing. Ukraine must admit it has lost the war, it has no chances to reverse the military situation, and that the only way to get out is to start talking to Russians about Moscow’s peace terms,” she said.\n\nThat, of course, is a far cry from what Kyiv and most of Ukraine’s western allies have in mind for a lasting peace. Discussions, led by Keir Starmer and Emmanuel Macron, to rally western nations into providing some kind of military able to police an eventual peace, appear to be far removed from the reality of the Kremlin’s current position.\n\nThe decisive question will be whether or not Trump is ready to really push Moscow when the scale of Putin’s “nuances” becomes clear. Putin put his position to Trump’s negotiator Steve Witkoff in closed-door talks on Thursday in Moscow. In a time-honoured tactic, he ­reportedly underlined the power dynamic of the meeting by ­keeping Witkoff waiting for eight hours before receiving him for discussions. In a social media post yesterday, Trump insisted “there was no wait whatsoever”, accusing those who suggested otherwise of being “sick degenerates”.\n\nAt least one positive for Ukraine last week was the apparent reset of relations with the Americans after the White House debacle, at talks in Saudi Arabia. Instead of JD Vance or others in Trump’s circle known to have a dislike for Ukraine, the White House sent secretary of state Marco Rubio and national ­security adviser Mike Waltz, seen as two of the more traditional foreign policy thinkers among the eclectic mix of those around Trump.\n\nInstead of Zelenskyy, who communicates with raw emotion, the Ukranian delegation was led by chief of staff, Andriy Yermak, known for speaking quietly and drily. The talks went on for eight hours with only a short break for lunch, and those involved said they were marked by methodical back-and-forth, rather than emotional appeals.\n\n“Historians underestimate the role of human exhaustion in ­making historical decisions,” Heorhii Tykhyi, spokesperson for Ukraine’s ­foreign ministry, wrote on Facebook after the talks. “It is in these last hours, when fatigue is already ­making itself felt, that a way out of the impasse and even difficult compromises suddenly become possible.”\n\nAfter the two ­delegations called their respective presidents, an agreement was made: Ukraine would agree to a 30-day ceasefire, and the US would resume intelligence sharing and weapons deliveries – a return to the status quo that after the preceding fortnight felt like a diplomatic victory.\n\nWitkoff was not in Saudi Arabia, while Rubio and Waltz did not travel to Moscow, leaving it an open ­question as to how coordinated the US dealmaking is. Keith Kellogg, the retired general whom Trump ­initially appointed his Ukraine and Russia envoy, and who was known to be a supporter of Kyiv, appears to have been completely sidelined from the process, with reports that the Kremlin asked him to be removed from high-level meetings.\n\nIf, against the odds, Trump can persuade Putin to agree to the 30-day ceasefire, discussions will then move on to the more difficult question of how to turn that into a sustainable peace. Even before that, there would be the issue of how such a ceasefire is monitored, along the long and unstable frontline.\n\n“A ceasefire can’t be based only on political statements,” said Fesenko. “The military would have to sit down and agree on the contact line, the monitoring procedure.It’s all harder now – before, there was just artillery, now there are drones. Who is going to control or at least monitor this?”",

Sign up for it here.\n\nThe idea that millions of dead Americans are receiving Social Security checks is shocking, and bolsters the argument that the federal bureaucracy needs radical change to combat waste and fraud. There’s one big problem: No evidence exists that it’s true.\n\nDespite being told by agency staff last month that this claim has no basis in fact, Elon Musk and President Donald Trump have continued to use the talking point as a pretext to attack America’s highest-spending government program. Musk seems to have gotten this idea from a list of Social Security recipients who did not have a death date attached to their record. Agency employees reportedly explained to Musk’s DOGE team in February that the list of impossibly ancient individuals they found were not necessarily receiving benefits (the lack of death dates was related to an outdated system).\n\nAnd yet, in his speech to Congress last week, Trump stated: “Believe it or not, government databases list 4.7 million Social Security members from people aged 100 to 109 years old.” He said the list includes “3.5 million people from ages 140 to 149,” among other 100-plus age ranges, and that “money is being paid to many of them, and we’re searching right now.” In an interview with Fox Business on Monday, Musk discussed the existence of “20 million people who are definitely dead, marked as alive” in the Social Security database. And DOGE has dispatched 10 employees to try to find evidence of the claims that dead Americans are receiving checks, according to documents filed in court on Wednesday.\n\nMusk and Trump have long maintained that they do not plan to attack Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid, the major entitlement programs. But their repeated claims that rampant fraud exists within these entitlement systems undermine those assurances. In his Fox interview on Monday, Musk said, “Waste and fraud in entitlement spending—which is most of the federal spending, is entitlements—so that’s like the big one to eliminate. That’s the sort of half trillion, maybe $600, $700 billion a year.” Some observers interpreted this confusing sentence to mean that Musk wants to cut the entitlement programs themselves. But the Trump administration quickly downplayed Musk’s comments, insisting that the federal government will continue to protect such programs and suggesting that Musk had been talking about the need to eliminate fraud in the programs, not about axing them. “What kind of a person doesn’t support eliminating waste, fraud, and abuse in government spending?” the White House asked in a press release.\n\nThe White House’s question would be a lot easier to answer if Musk, who has called Social Security a “Ponzi scheme,” wasn’t wildly overestimating the amount of fraud in entitlement programs. Musk is claiming waste in these programs on the order of hundreds of billions of dollars a year, but a 2024 Social Security Administration report found that the agency lost closer to $70 billion total in improper payments from 2015 to 2022, which accounts for about 1 percent of Social Security payments. Leland Dudek, a mid-level civil servant elevated to temporarily lead Social Security after being put on administrative leave for sharing information with DOGE, pushed back last week on the idea that the agency is overrun with fraud and that dead people older than 100 are getting payments, ProPublica reported after obtaining a recording of a closed-door meeting. DOGE’s false claim about dead people receiving benefits “got in front of us,” one of Dudek’s deputies reportedly said, but “it’s a victory that you’re not seeing more [misinformation], because they are being educated.” (Dudek did not respond to ProPublica’s request for comment.)\n\nSome 7 million Americans rely on Social Security benefits for more than 90 percent of their income, and 54 million individuals and their dependents receive retirement payments from the agency. Even if Musk doesn’t eliminate the agency, his tinkering could still affect all of those Americans’ lives. On Wednesday, DOGE dialed back its plans to cut off much of Social Security’s phone services (a commonly used alternative to its online programs, particularly for elderly and disabled Americans), though it still plans to restrict recipients’ ability to change bank-deposit information over the phone.\n\nIn recent weeks, confusion has rippled through the Social Security workforce and the public; many people drop off forms in person, but office closures could disrupt that. According to ProPublica, several IT contracts have been cut or scaled back, and several employees reported that their tech systems are crashing every day. Thousands of jobs are being cut, including in regional field offices, and the entire Social Security staff has been offered buyouts (today is the deadline for workers to take them). Martin O’Malley, a former commissioner of the agency, has warned that the workforce reductions that DOGE is seeking at Social Security could trigger “system collapse and an interruption of benefits” within the next one to three months.\n\nIn going anywhere near Social Security—in saying the agency’s name in the same sentence as the word eliminate—Musk is venturing further than any presidential administration has in recent decades. Entitlement benefits are extremely popular, and cutting the programs has long been a nonstarter. When George W. Bush raised the idea of partially privatizing entitlements in 2005, the proposal died before it could make it to a vote in the House or Senate.\n\nThe DOGE plan to cut $1 trillion in spending while leaving entitlements, which make up the bulk of the federal budget, alone always seemed implausible. In the November Wall Street Journal op-ed announcing the DOGE initiative, Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy (who is no longer part of DOGE) wrote that those who say “we can’t meaningfully close the federal deficit without taking aim at entitlement programs” are deflecting “attention from the sheer magnitude of waste, fraud and abuse” that “DOGE aims to address.” But until there’s clear evidence that this “magnitude” of fraud exists within Social Security, such claims enable Musk to poke at what was previously untouchable.\n\nRelated:\n\nHere are four new stories from The Atlantic:\n\nToday’s News\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said that Democrats will support a Republican-led short-term funding bill to help avoid a government shutdown.

        "source": "https://www.theatlantic.com/",
        "content": "When Viktor Orbán gave a speech in 2022 at a Conservative Political Action Conference gathering in Budapest, he shared his secret to amassing power with Donald Trump’s fan base. “We must have our own media,” he told his audience.\n\nAs a Hungarian investigative journalist, I have had a firsthand view of how Orbán has built his own media universe while simultaneously placing a stranglehold on the independent press. As I watch from afar what’s happening to the free press in the United States during the first weeks of Trump’s second presidency—the verbal bullying, the legal harassment, the buckling by media owners in the face of threats—it all looks very familiar. The MAGA authorities have learned Orbán’s lessons well.\n\nI saw the roots of Orbán’s media strategy when I first met him for an interview, in 2006. He was in the opposition then but had served as prime minister before and was fighting hard to get back in power. When we met in his office in a hulking century-old building that overlooked the Danube River in Budapest, he was very friendly, even charming. Like Trump, he is the kind of politician who knows how to connect with people when he thinks he has something to gain.\n\nDuring the interview, his demeanor shifted. I still remember how his face went dark when I pushed on questions that he obviously did not want to answer. It was a tense exchange, but he reverted to his cordial mode when we finished the interview, and I turned off the recorder.\n\nWhat happened afterwards was less friendly. In Hungary, journalists are expected to send edited interview transcripts to their interviewees. The idea is that if the interviewees think you took something they said out of context, they can ask for changes before publication. But in this case, Orbán’s press team sent back the text with some of his answers entirely deleted and rewritten. When my editors and I told them we wouldn’t accept this, they said they wouldn’t allow the interview to be published.\n\nIn the end, we published it without their edits. That was the last time I interviewed Viktor Orbán. And when he returned to power in 2010 after a landslide election victory, he made sure that he would never have to answer uncomfortable questions again.\n\nOne of the first pieces of legislation his party introduced was a media law that restructured how the sector is regulated in Hungary. The government set up a new oversight agency and appointed hard-line loyalists to its key positions. This agency later blocked proposed mergers and acquisitions by independent media companies, while issuing friendly rulings for pro-government businesses.\n\nThe Orbán government also transformed public broadcasting—which had previously carried news programs challenging politicians from all parties—into a mouthpiece of the state. The service’s newly appointed leaders got rid of principled journalists and replaced them with governing-party sympathizers who could be counted on to toe the line.\n\nThen the government went after private media companies. Origo, a popular Hungarian news website, was one of its first targets. For many years, Origo—where I had been working when I conducted the 2006 Orbán interview—was a great place to do journalism. It was owned by a multinational telecommunications company and run by people who did not interfere with our work. If anything, they were supportive of our journalism. In 2009, after conducting some award-winning investigations, I was even invited to the CEO’s office for a friendly chat about the importance of accountability reporting.\n\nBut a few years after Orbán’s return to power, the environment changed. As we continued our aggressive—but fair—reporting, the telecommunications company behind Origo came under pressure from the government. Instead of sending encouraging messages, the outlet’s publisher started telling the editor in chief not to pursue certain stories that were uncomfortable for Orbán and his allies.\n\nMy colleagues in the newsroom and I pushed back. But after repeated clashes with the publisher over one of my investigations, into the expensive and mysterious travel of a powerful government official, the editor in chief was forced out of his job. I resigned, along with many fellow journalists, and soon the news site was sold to a company with close links to Orbán’s inner circle. Now Origo is unrecognizable. It has become the flagship news site of the pro-government propaganda machine, publishing articles praising Orbán and viciously attacking his critics.\n\nOrigo is part of an ecosystem that includes hundreds of newspapers and news sites, several television channels—including the public broadcasters and one of the two biggest commercial channels—and almost all radio stations. That’s not to mention the group of pro-government influencers whose social-media posts are distributed widely, thanks to financial resources also linked to the government.\n\nThis machine is not even pretending to do journalism in the traditional sense. It is not like Fox News, which still has some professional anchors and reporters alongside the openly pro-Trump media personalities who dominate the channel in prime time.\n\nThe machine built under Orbán has only one purpose, and it is to serve the interests of the government. There is hardly any autonomy. Editors and reporters get directions from the very top of the regime on what they can and cannot cover. If there is a message that must be delivered, the whole machine jumps into action: Hundreds of outlets will publish the same story with the same headline and same photos.\n\nIn 2022, Direkt36, the investigative-reporting center I co-founded after leaving Origo, wrote about one such example. In the story, which was reported by my colleague Zsuzsanna Wirth, we described an episode in which Bertalan Havasi, the prime minister’s press chief at the time, sent an email to the director of the national news agency.\n\n​​“Hi, could you write an article about this, citing me as a source? Thanks!” Havasi wrote. (The instruction was about a relatively mundane matter: a letter that a European rabbi had sent to Orbán thanking him for his support.) Later, Havasi also told the agency what the headline and lead sentence should be. The news agency followed the instructions word for word.\n\nA few years ago, I investigated the pro-government takeover of Index, another of Hungary’s most popular news sites. I obtained a recording in which the outlet’s editor in chief described to one of his employees how Index had received financial backing from a friend of Orbán’s, a former gas fitter who has become Hungary’s richest man thanks to lucrative state contracts. The editor in chief warned that Index had to be careful with news about Orbán’s friend because, without him, “there will be no one who will put money into” the outlet.\n\nJust as Orbán explained in his CPAC speech, this sophisticated propaganda machine has played a crucial role in his ability to stay in power for more than 15 years. When the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, a watchdog group of which the United States is a member, published its report on Hungary’s 2022 parliamentary elections, it pointed to the media as a major weakness in the country’s democratic system.\n\n“The lack of impartial information in the media about the main contestants, the absence of debates among the major electoral competitors, and the independent media’s limited access to public information and activities of national and local government significantly limited voters’ opportunity to make an informed choice,” the election monitors concluded, after a vote that yet again cemented the power of Orbán’s ruling party.\n\nWhat has happened in Hungary might not happen in the United States. Hungary, a former Eastern Bloc nation that broke free of oppressive Soviet control only three and a half decades ago, has never had such a robust and vibrant independent media scene as the one the U.S. has enjoyed for centuries. But if someone had told me when Orbán returned to power that we would end up with a propaganda machine where the free Hungarian media had once been, with many of the old outlets shut down or transformed into government mouthpieces, I would not have believed it.\n\nAnd I see ominous signs in the U.S. that feel similar to the early phases of what we experienced here. When I read about the Associated Press being banned from White House events, that reminds me of how my colleagues at Direkt36 have been denied entry to Orbán’s rare press conferences. When I see the Washington Post owner Jeff Bezos cozying up to Trump, that reminds me of how big corporations and their wealthy executives, including the owner of my former workplace, bent the knee to Orbán.\n\nWhen I read about ABC settling a Trump lawsuit of dubious merit—and CBS contemplating the same—it brings to mind the way the courts and the government itself can be used to manipulate and bully media organizations into submission.\n\nJournalists and anyone else who cares about the free press must understand that democratic institutions are more fragile than they look, especially if they face pressure from ruthless and powerful political forces. This is particularly true for the news media, which is also being challenged by the technological revolution in how we communicate information. Just because an outlet has been around for decades and has a storied history does not mean that it will be around forever.\n\nIf any good news can be learned from Hungary’s unhappy experience, it is that unless your country turns into a fully authoritarian regime similar to China or Russia, there are still ways for independent journalism to survive. Even in Hungary, some outlets manage to operate independently from the government. Many of them, including the one I run, rely primarily on their audience for support in the form of donations or subscriptions. We learned that it is easy for billionaires and media CEOs to be champions of press freedom when the risks are low, but that you can’t count on them when things get tough. So we rely on our readers instead.\n\nIf they feel like what you are doing is valuable, they will be your real allies in confronting the suffocating power of autocracy.",

        "content": "Produced by ElevenLabs and News Over Audio (Noa) using AI narration. Listen to more stories on the Noa app.\n\nAmericans hold all sorts of views on tariffs. Some are opposed on free-market grounds. Others are in favor for reasons of national security or to bring back American manufacturing. Those debates are part of a normal democratic process. But President Donald Trump’s first weeks in office have shown that a principled discussion over tariff policy is simply not on the agenda, because the administration’s tariff policy is nonsense.\n\nWhat we have is chaos. One U.S. uncertainty index of economic policy, which goes back to 1985, has been higher at only one point in the past 40 years: when the coronavirus pandemic began. That, of course, was a global phenomenon that the United States could do little to avoid. What’s going on now, by contrast, is entirely self-inflicted.\n\nRead: Trump’s most inexplicable decision yet\n\nChaos is Trump’s calling card, but few could have expected how quickly the president would ricochet all over the place on the size, nature, and timing of—not to mention the justifications for—one of his signature policies. Before markets can adjust to one pronouncement, the world’s smartphones buzz in unison announcing that the wealthiest nation in the world, whose dollars hold up the global financial system, is hurtling in another direction once again.\n\nJust consider this abridged timeline of the most significant twists and turns thus far:\n\nTo recap, the United States is now in a trade war with its largest trading partner (Canada), its second-largest trading partner (the European Union), its third-largest trading partner (Mexico), and its fourth-largest trading partner (China).\n\nIt’s obvious to the point of cliché that businesses rely on regulatory—and fiscal—policy predictability in order to plan hiring, capital investments, and pricing strategies. And that means these past few weeks have been very rough. How can you begin a capital-intensive project if you have no idea what anything will cost? The chaos of the current trade policy is a strange parallel to the chaos that the Trump administration has unleashed on the federal government. One difference is evident, however: Although markets expected the new president to go on a deregulatory spree, they failed to take his affinity for tariffs seriously—or at least thought things would be executed a little more deliberately.\n\nAn adviser to prominent energy companies told me that because “infrastructure projects require five to 10 years for permitting and construction,” some of her clients are pausing normal business decisions. “The current environment is so chaotic that it’s difficult to understand effects [on] permitting pathways, community approvals, and supply-chain costs.” She requested anonymity to speak freely about her clients’ struggles in the early days of the new Trump administration.\n\nThe big companies are in a better spot than small businesses. As we’ve already seen when the Big Three automakers were able to get direct relief from the tariffs, large companies that can provide Trump with good PR are able to get carve-outs from tariffs. But small businesses are less suited to absorbing shocks and are less likely to stay abreast of the day-to-day shifts of tariff policy. Many will be unable to game the system.\n\nUncertainty may also be paralyzing the labor markets. As my colleague Rogé Karma reported last month, job switching is at its lowest level in nearly a decade, even though the unemployment rate remains low. Part of what’s going on is that lack of confidence in the future breeds risk aversion: Employers are too rattled to make a bet on a new hire, and employees are too worried to leave a safe position.\n\nRead: A great way to get Americans to eat worse\n\nSome people—such as those who are worried that a backlash may invigorate American support for free markets—would like the public to believe that the country is in the throes of an “economic masterplan” and that the chaos of this moment will cohere into a reasonable strategy. Color me skeptical. For one, the president and his team have yet to articulate a consistent set of arguments for supporting his vision. Instead, the justifications for the tariff policies change as fast as the policies themselves.\n\nIf the tariffs are about rebalancing America’s trade and restoring its manufacturing greatness, then why are they being removed? If they’re about improving America’s negotiating position vis-à-vis bordering nations on issues such as fentanyl and immigration, then why are we putting them on Canada?\n\nIs Trump doing this to make Americans richer? Is he doing this to balance the budget? To hit back at other countries for their unfair policies? For national-security reasons? To solve the child-care-cost crisis?\n\nAs the Yale Law professor Jerry Mashaw wrote for Fordham Law Review, “The authority of all law relies on a set of complex reasons for believing that it should be authoritative. Unjustifiable law demands reform, unjustifiable legal systems demand revolution.” That our elected officials are required to explain themselves, to give reasons for the actions they take, is a cornerstone of democratic accountability. Without clear reasons, it’s not just businesses that are at stake. It’s democratic governance.\n\nBut if sifting through Trump’s roiling sea of rationalizations is important for democratic purposes, it’s also personally significant. Every business, worker, and consumer in the country has a stake in figuring out the why and what of tariffs.\n\nRead: Don’t invite a recession in\n\nIdeologues across the political spectrum resent the American voter’s materialism. Environmentalists moan that the public refuses to bear higher energy costs in order to help mitigate the effects of climate change; animal-rights advocates worry that people won’t pay to ensure better treatment of livestock; farm advocates who already benefit from distortionary subsidies have even advocated for price floors. Now it’s the economic populists insisting that the public should be willing to pay higher prices on the path to restoring American greatness. On Truth Social, Trump posted an article with the headline “Shut Up About Egg Prices,” and Republicans are insisting that it’s worth it to “pay a little bit more” to support the president. But “America First” has always been a better slogan than organizing principle. When people have the option to pay for domestic goods at higher prices, they opt out, time and again.\n\nThe speed with which Republicans have gone from hammering Democrats about high grocery prices to justifying the inflationary effects of tariffs is remarkable. Yet Republicans are likely to learn the lesson that Democrats did last November: Before they are Republicans, Democrats, or even Americans, my countrymen are consumers first.",

        "title": "RFK Jr. Has Already Broken His Vaccine Promise",
        "source": "https://www.theatlantic.com/",
        "content": "There seems to be a limit to how anti-vax is too anti-vax in the Trump administration. Yesterday, hours before Dave Weldon was slated to begin his Senate confirmation hearing for CDC director, the White House pulled his nomination. Weldon, a physician and former Republican congressman, has long questioned the safety of vaccines. In a meeting last month, he reportedly told one senator that routine childhood vaccines were exposing kids to dangerous levels of mercury and may cause autism. (Both claims are false.)\n\nWeldon has denied that he’s anti-vaccination, but his views on vaccines seem to have been his undoing. In a written statement he gave to me and other outlets, he suggested that at least two Republican senators were threatening to vote against him, and that this became “clearly too much for the White House.” But those two senators, Bill Cassidy of Louisiana and Susan Collins of Maine, voted to confirm Robert F. Kennedy Jr., an ardent vaccine critic who would have been Weldon’s boss as health secretary. Perhaps Weldon’s biggest problem was that he said the quiet part out loud. During his confirmation hearings, Kennedy sidestepped calls for him to declare unequivocally that vaccines do not cause autism, and appeared to convince lawmakers that he’d let Americans make their own decisions about vaccines. “I support the measles vaccine. I support the polio vaccine. I will do nothing as HHS secretary that makes it difficult or discourages people from taking either of those vaccines,” Kennedy told senators.\n\nKennedy is already breaking that promise. As cases of measles are popping up in states across the country—leading to America’s first measles death in a decade—he has propped up unproven treatments such as cod-liver oil. Though Kennedy has said that the measles vaccine helps “protect individual children from measles” and contributes to “community immunity,” he also baselessly questioned its “risk profile” in an appearance on Fox News earlier this week. (In extremely rare instances the vaccine can have serious side effects.) Kennedy’s subversion of vaccines, subtle at times, glaring at others, goes far beyond the measles outbreak. The health secretary is “using the federal government to undermine vaccination in all the ways that it can,” Matt Motta, a vaccine-communication researcher at Boston University, told me. Weldon may have crossed a red line for lawmakers. But in just over a month on the job, Kennedy has taken more steps against vaccines than perhaps any other top health official in modern American history.\n\nRead: His daughter was America’s first measles death in a decade\n\nKennedy’s wishy-washy comments about the measles vaccine may persuade more parents not to vaccinate their children—which means that more children will get sick, and perhaps die. But his other actions will have an even broader, longer-lasting effect on the overall U.S. vaccination system. Earlier this week, the administration terminated NIH research grants probing how the government can address vaccine hesitancy. Vaccine promotion might seem separate from access, but the two are intertwined, Motta said. Research into vaccine promotion often explores issues such as whether people know where to get shots or whether insurance will cover them. (A spokesperson for Health and Human Services did not respond to a request for comment.)\n\nAll the while, the research that the government now is funding may only serve to further sow vaccine distrust. The CDC is reportedly launching a study probing the link between vaccines and autism—even though the connection has already been thoroughly studied and debunked. A 2014 meta-analysis of more than 1 million children found “no relationship” between shots and the condition. Even if the new study comes to a similar conclusion, simply funding such research has consequences, Jennifer Reich, a vaccine-hesitancy researcher at the University of Colorado Denver, told me. The NIH’s new research plays a “powerful symbolic role of making” the link “feel like it is unsettled,” she said.\n\nA myopic focus on the purported connection between vaccines and autism is exactly what some lawmakers feared would color Kennedy’s term as secretary. During Kennedy’s confirmation, Cassidy, a physician, raised concerns that Kennedy and his MAHA movement may undermine science by “always asking for more evidence and never accepting the evidence that is there.” Cassidy, who did not respond to a request for comment, may soon have more reason for disappointment. He ultimately voted to confirm Kennedy based on a plethora of promises and his belief, as he said in a speech on the Senate floor, that RFK Jr. would “work within current vaccine approval and safety-monitoring systems.” Yet Kennedy has already hinted that he will change those systems: “We have a vaccine-surveillance system in this country that just doesn’t work,” he recently said on Fox News, adding that “the CDC in the past has not done a good job at quantifying the risk of vaccines. We are going to do that now.”\n\nSince RFK Jr. entered office, the health agencies have not abandoned all responsibilities surrounding vaccinations. CDC officials have been directly coordinating with the local Texas health department at the epicenter of the measles outbreak, including helping design outreach materials encouraging vaccination, according to internal emails I received as part of a public-records request. A letter addressed to parents from a local health official, for example, states: “I strongly encourage you to have your child vaccinated as soon as possible.”\n\nPerhaps Weldon’s defeat signifies that Washington wants more pro-vaccination efforts like that. But he makes for an easy scapegoat: Unlike RFK Jr., he lacks a devoted fan base backing him up. Kennedy doesn’t need Weldon to do real damage to America’s vaccine infrastructure. The changes he has made so far are likely only the beginning. If Kennedy keeps up this pace, America’s vaccine system may look fundamentally different in one year, or two. The stand against Weldon changes nothing about that.",

What word can possibly encapsulate the joy of women singing in harmony, the unease with which they might circle one another, the trust and distrust that can grow among their ranks?\n\nIn Agustina Bazterrica’s new novel, The Unworthy, women are quickly classified. The unnamed protagonist, who writes her story in secret from a former monastery, is one of the titular “unworthy,” a woman given shelter from the toxic, dusty, climate-ravaged outside world but granted no special honors besides, potentially, her survival. Above the monastery’s unworthy hover the “Minor Saints,” “Diaphanous Spirits,” and “Full Auras”—women who have, respectively, had their tongues sliced out, their eardrums punctured, and their eyelids sewn shut—all of whom are elevated (if you want to call it that) to a holy status. These are the “chosen”: With their mauled faces and special privileges (real meat and vegetables instead of the crickets the unworthy eat), they are simultaneously revered and loathed from the very start of the story. The “enlightened,” who hover over even the “chosen,” are locked behind a black door and never seen. Hierarchies breed a hell of a lot of sycophancy and resentment, and this one is no different.\n\nUnlike the bunker in The Unworthy, this brand of female dystopia doesn’t exist in a vacuum. All-female communities tend to be weirdly polarized in the cultural imagination. They’re either paradigms of peace and love or bastions of PMS-motivated backbiting. Particularly in genre fiction, the lines can be very stark. In Herland, the 1915 novel by Charlotte Perkins Gilman—the author of the proto-feminist school-curriculum staple “The Yellow Wallpaper”—three male explorers discover a community in which women live and reproduce without men. They are awed by the women’s sense of harmony and fitness. Joanna Russ’s snarling 1975 novel, The Female Man, creates four societies. In one of them, women live without men—and without murder and sexual assault—and in another, the two sexes literally battle for dominance. The message of such stories is clear: On their own, women are free of the burden of violence and inequality.\n\nThe appeal of reading about female utopias has recently reached a new zenith. The novel I Who Have Never Known Men was published in 1995, but after its 2022 reissue, it has gone viral on BookTok and sold more than 100,000 copies in the United States. In the book, a group of women live in underground cages on a planet that some believe is not their own. They don’t know how they got there, but one day their guards flee for no clear reason, and they eventually establish a harmonious and cooperative society. There is sadness and death, but never real strife. Even when they must hurt one another—the narrator “know[s] what to do” with a knife to put her suffering sisters out of their misery—the bloodshed is compassionate.\n\nMargaret Atwood: Go ahead and ban my book\n\nThis sunny side of dystopia stands at odds with a countervailing notion of women in isolation—the kind often perpetuated by novels set in boarding schools or convents—which dictates that woman’s natural enemy is woman. In the classic of the genre, Margaret Atwood’s The Handmaid’s Tale, most women trapped in a theocratic future America are forced to enslave or torture other women, but some of them actively enlist as foot soldiers in the effort. And outside the genre, girls in novels including Andrés Barba’s orphanage-set Such Small Hands and Mona Awad’s Bunny turn to cruelty when the walls close in on them.\n\nOn the surface, The Unworthy appears to fit squarely into this second canon. Yet Bazterrica’s world building and character development transcend this typology: The monastery is a hellhole masquerading as a shrine, and the women who walk its halls are both fiercely loyal and self-cannibalizing. In Bazterrica’s first novel to be translated into English, the similarly dystopian Tender Is the Flesh, human flesh is an industrialized commodity. In The Unworthy, she has similar preoccupations, focusing on how eagerly women might (proverbially) eat one another up. What stands out, though, is how readily she moves between the two opposing notions of what all-female communities can be. She shows us women pushed to extremes, who react with extreme behavior—but can they be faulted for that?\n\nNone of this is to say that The Unworthy occupies any sort of middle ground. The novel opens with malice: “Someone is screaming in the dark,” the unnamed narrator writes. “I hope it’s Lourdes. I put cockroaches in her pillow and sewed up the slip, so they struggle to get out, so they crawl under her head or over her face (and into her ears, I hope, nesting there, the nymphs damaging her brain).” Animosity is a founding principle of the story—and of the unworthy’s community. In this bunker run by the “Superior Sister” and an unseen, Wizard of Oz–like “He,” bloody punishments are so frequent that they have become the group’s currency. Women stick needles in one another’s nipples and are made to lie down on glass. They volunteer to walk on burning embers or take floggings with a cat-o’-nine-tails. Still, they are not only grateful to be there but desperate to climb the devotional ladder.\n\nThe group’s motto is “Without faith, there is no refuge,” which sounds like a standard religious tenet until you read it literally: If the women don’t commit, they will be without a home. The planet is essentially a desert. “The wars,” the narrator writes, “coincided with the disappearance of many territories, many countries, beneath the ocean.” The protagonist grew up in a world “that was degrading minute by minute. A world where water was scarce, and there was no school, no electricity. A world of floods, in which eight months of rain fell in less than an hour.” Bands of adults hunted packs of wild children. The novel’s rendering of global destruction goes beyond most climate fiction—there isn’t a drop of hope or a speck of verdure. No place can guarantee safety, but the Superior Sister implies that the holiness of the monastery’s “enlightened” inhabitants keeps it safe. It’s a tale as old as time: Pray to the right god, sacrifice in the right ways, and protection will encircle you.\n\nRead: The remarkable rise of the feminist dystopia\n\nExcept the horrors keep coming, despite the unworthy’s muttered prayers. The narrator’s notes, which she keeps tied to herself underneath her tunic or tucked under wooden floorboards, document her transformation from partial believer to total apostate as tension inside the community ratchets up. Lourdes, she of the cockroach pillowcase, leads a campaign of terror worthy of Robespierre. The women turn on one another more and more. The dynamic unravels even further when a stowaway—who has dragged herself through a hole in the wall—is found at the monastery and deemed clean and worthy enough to join their community. Lucía, the newcomer, possesses a gift, and a moral compass, and the hierarchy of the place begins to shift.\n\nBazterrica’s story—so cinematically gruesome that it could have been written as a treatment for an A24-produced horror film—comes at a strange inflection point for women in this country. (It was originally published in her native Argentina in 2023.) During recent elections, the media have sometimes treated women as a monolithic voting block; some analysts have credited or blamed them for Donald Trump’s or Joe Biden’s electoral victories, regardless of the clear reality that they do not universally share one another’s hopes, fears, or best interests.\n\nThe Unworthy strips away the idea, implicit in I Who Have Never Known Men and its ilk, that women are inherently good stewards, that their leadership would bring humanity into some kind of karmic balance. It does so not because it disdains women, but because it sees them. Lourdes is dastardly but pathetic. Lucía saintly but carnal. The narrator possesses a kind of bravery that can’t be activated on its own. We learn that the Superior Sister “fought in the water wars, the most violent ones, in which the millenary tribes were bombarded, and that she defended her own until the very end, that she was a prisoner, a slave, that she escaped.” Or so we are told. What we know is that she grips her power like a cane that supports her whole weight.\n\nDepicting women in all their complicated glory isn’t especially novel or valiant, but Bazterrica’s novel tries something that most writers shy away from. She makes manifest the rot inside every human, and the tendency to portray them as sinners or saints. She does so not by eschewing extremes, but by embracing them, putting her women in an unendurable situation and then watching their moral compass whirl about in some fictional version of the Stanford Prison Experiment. Ugly times create ugly behavior—unless, that is, you can muster your righteous fortitude and carry on in the right direction.",

        "source": "https://www.theatlantic.com/",
        "content": "Updated at 10:56 a.m. on March 14, 2025\n\n\n\nUntil the second Trump administration took over, the National Institutes of Health—the world’s single largest public funder of biomedical research—was not in the business of canceling its grants. Of the more than 60,000 research awards the agency issues each year, it goes on to terminate, on average, maybe 20 of them, and usually only because of serious problems, such as flagrant misconduct, fraud, or an ethical breach that could harm study participants. “I have been involved with legitimate grant terminations,” one former NIH official, who worked at the agency for many years, told me. “I can count them on the fingers of one hand.”\n\nYet, in a few weeks, the administration has forced the agency to terminate so many of its active research grants—all seemingly on political grounds—that none of the dozen NIH officials I spoke with for this story could say for certain how many termination letters had gone out. Most thought that the number was now well above 100, and would likely continue to rapidly climb. This morning, in a meeting of grants-management staff, officials were told that approximately a thousand more grants could be targeted for termination, beginning today, one official told me. If the administration had not already, in a matter of weeks, exceeded the total number of cancellations the NIH has executed in the past decade, it will soon—perhaps within hours.\n\nThe NIH—an agency that has long prided itself on its mission of science funded by scientists—spends most of its $47 billion annual budget on driving biomedical innovation: developing new drugs and vaccines, containing epidemics, treating cancer, mitigating the harms of heart disease. But the growing scope of cancellations is revealing how willing Donald Trump’s administration is to claw back those resources for political reasons. (All of the current and former NIH officials I spoke with for this story requested anonymity for fear of retaliation from the federal government; the NIH did not respond to a request for comment.)\n\nThis spate of terminations is the Trump administration’s most aggressive attempt so far to forcibly reshape American science to match its agenda. At the same time, this might also be the most ham-fisted. Many officials told me that, as one succinctly put it, “they’re just going in and picking random grants to terminate.” Although the administration has said it doesn’t want to fund science that touches on certain concepts—gender, DEI, vaccine hesitancy—the terminations so far have few discernible criteria, and don’t operate by consistent protocols; in several cases, they end projects that are only tangentially related to the topics the administration wants to purge. If anything, the grant cancellations have become a game of whack-a-mole, in which political appointees take a mallet to any seemingly relevant research projects that pop into view—without regard to the damage they might do.\n\nNotice of grant terminations has arrived from NIH officials, on NIH letterhead. But the decisions about which grants to cancel and why are primarily being made outside the agency, with pressure coming from the Department of Health and Human Services, several NIH officials told me.\n\nThe first round of cancellations, which began on the evening of February 28, focused mainly on grants that included a DEI component or involved transgender participants; officials at the agency were also told to cut off funding to projects that allot money to China. Another round, which began on Monday evening, targets grants that mention vaccine hesitancy or uptake; that same night, the NIH posted on X that it would cut $250 million in grants from Columbia University, one of several institutions that the Trump administration’s Department of Education is investigating for “antisemitic discrimination and harassment.” Two officials told me they expect several more rounds of cancellations, and several said that, based on recent emails sent to staff, grants involving mRNA vaccines, as well as grants that send funds to work in South Africa, may be next. (HHS did not respond to a request for comment.)\n\nThe list of grants related to vaccine hesitancy that officials were told to cancel targets dozens of projects. Some—such as a study of vaccine uptake in Alaska Native communities—were perhaps obvious choices, because they so directly addressed vaccine attitudes. But the list also included studies that use vaccine hesitancy as just one of several variables to mathematically model disease transmission. And several researchers who have dedicated their career to studying vaccine behaviors have not yet heard that their grants have been affected. Alison Buttenheim, a behavioral scientist at Penn Nursing, has been watching colleagues’ grants on vaccine uptake get canceled, but as far as she knows, her own NIH-funded work on vaccine hesitancy is still actively funded, though she expects that to change. “I figure it’s only days until it’s axed,” she told me.\n\n“It’s unclear why some of us are getting them or not,” Brittany Charlton, who directs the LGBTQ research center at Harvard’s school of public health, told me. One of her colleagues, Nancy Krieger, told me that she’d received a termination letter for a study about measuring discrimination in clinical settings (including sexism and stigma about sexual orientation or transgender identity). But Charlton has yet to receive a letter for her own NIH-funded studies, which focus much more directly on LGBTQ populations.\n\nOne NIH official put it more bluntly: “It is such utter and complete chaos.” In advance of the terminations, several officials told me, agency leadership solicited lists of grants that might, for instance, “promote gender ideology,” or that involved certain types of vaccine-behavior research. NIH officials responded with curated lists of research projects, in several cases including only the bare-minimum number of grants with the most relevance. But many officials then received back spreadsheets populated with a subset of the grants from their own lists, along with several other grants that made only passing mention of the targeted topics. It was as if, one official told me, someone had performed a Ctrl+F search for certain terms, then copied and pasted the results. Multiple rounds of terminations in, officials at some NIH institutes are still unclear on how this new system of cancellations is supposed to work. Nearly two months after Trump’s executive order on cutting DEI programming, for instance, “we still haven’t gotten a definition of DEI,” one official said.\n\nTypically, each NIH grant is shepherded by a team of officials, including at least one program officer, who oversees its scientific components, and a grants-management officer, who handles the budget. When terminations are on the table, those officials are always looped in—usually so they can help determine how to remedy the situation. “Terminations are the final option,” one NIH official told me.\n\nBut these recent directions to terminate arrived without warning or the usual steps of deliberation, and they instructed grants-management officers to issue letters by the end of the day they received them, two officials told me—leaving no time to push back, or even react. “There is zero protocol,” one official told me. “It is just, We are told, and it is done.” In at least one case, an official told me, a program officer learned that their grantee’s award had been terminated from the grantee.\n\nThe emailed directives also handed NIH officials prewritten justifications for termination. None cited misconduct, fraud, or even low likelihood for success. But the ones targeting research related to transgender people or DEI claimed that the projects in question were “antithetical to the scientific inquiry,” “often unscientific,” or ignoring “biological realities.” The termination-letter templates also noted the NIH’s obligation to carefully steward taxpayer dollars, accused the projects of failing to employ federal resources to benefit the well-being of Americans, and cited new agency priorities as a reason for ending studies. Letters issued to several researchers studying vaccines, for instance, stated, “It is the policy of NIH not to prioritize research activities that focuses [sic] gaining scientific knowledge on why individuals are hesitant to be vaccinated and/or explore ways to improve vaccine interest and commitment.” The terminations sent to scientists studying LGBTQ populations contained similar language, and in some cases said that their projects “provide low returns on investment, and ultimately do not enhance health, lengthen life, or reduce illness.”\n\nThose assertions, though, directly contradict the conclusions of NIH officials and the outside scientists who helped award those grants in the first place. No project can receive NIH funds without first being vetted by multiple panels of experts in the field, who judge each proposal based on criteria such as the lead scientist’s track record, the rigor of the study’s design, and the project’s likelihood of addressing a pressing biomedical-research issue. And each proposal submitted to the NIH undergoes two layers of internal review, to ensure that the project meets agency policies and is “aligned with the goals of the institute” potentially funding it, one official told me.\n\nSeveral letter recipients told me that their grants had received perfect or near-perfect scores in early reviews; others told me that their results were well on their way to publication, proof of some return on the agency’s investment. And all addressed important issues in public health: One, for instance, was studying how stress affects alcohol consumption; another, mpox among men who have sex with men; another, the factors that might influence the success of a future HIV vaccine.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe NIH, a federal agency directed by a political appointee, does sometimes shift its priorities for scientific or ideological reasons. For instance, some NIH institutes have over time gotten pickier about issuing awards to candidate-gene studies, in which researchers try to confirm whether a specific gene affects a biological trait, one official told me. And the first Trump administration placed restrictions on research that could be done using fetal tissue. Both of those shifts, officials said, meant that certain new proposals weren’t green-lighted. But in neither case was the agency forced to issue mass terminations of projects that had already been declared worthy of funds, officials told me.\n\nThe clearest example that the NIH officials I spoke with could recall of a grant being terminated at the behest of political leadership was also triggered by a Trump administration: During his first term, Trump pressured the agency to terminate a grant that had been issued to the nonprofit EcoHealth Alliance, which was partnering with the Wuhan Institute of Virology, in China. But even that cancellation was partly reversed. In general, “when an administration changes priorities, they change them going forward,” one official said. “They don’t reach back and terminate awards.”\n\nGrant cancellations are tantamount to instantaneous salary cuts for scientists, and can force them to halt studies, fire staff, and tell participants that their time and effort may have been wasted. Jace Flatt, a health and behavioral scientist at the University of Nevada at Las Vegas, has had two NIH grants axed, for projects looking at dementia and memory loss in aging LGBTQ populations. If he loses a third NIH grant—as he expects to, he told me—“my lab is gone.” Because the terminations arrived without warning, scientists also had no time to prepare: Sarah Nowak, a vaccine researcher at the University of Vermont, told me she found out that her grant investigating childhood vaccine hesitancy in Brazil was likely on the chopping block when she read an article on the vaccine-related grant cuts in The Washington Post on Monday. (Nowak received her letter the next day.)\n\nMany studies, once terminated, would be difficult, if not outright impossible, to restart, Sean Arayasirikul, a medical sociologist at UC Irvine, told me. Medical interventions in clinical trials, for instance, can’t simply be paused and picked back up; many studies also rely heavily on collecting data at small and regular intervals, so interruptions are equivalent to massive data holes. Plus, participants released from a study won’t always be willing to come back, especially if they’re from communities that medical research has neglected in the past and that already have little reason to place continued trust in scientists. (Arayasirikul received a termination letter for their work investigating how stigma affects HIV preventive care for people of color who are also sexual and gender minorities.)\n\nTerminating grants to match political priorities also creates a fundamental instability in the government’s approach to scientific funding. If researchers can’t count on grants to carry across administrations, their government-funded work will become a series of short-term sprints, making it harder for science to reliably progress. Biomedical breakthroughs—including, say, the generation and approval of new drugs, or clinical trials for chronically ill patients—typically take years, sometimes even decades. And for an administration that has premised itself on efficiency, a never-ending loop of funding bait and switch does not exactly make for minimizing waste. “This says, At any point, we can just up and change our minds,” one NIH official told me. “That is not good stewardship of federal dollars.”\n\nMany of the administration’s actions might well be illegal—especially its targeting of DEI, which a federal judge recently deemed a potential violation of the First Amendment. But NIH officials have been put “in an impossible position,” one told me. Their choices are to either carry out the administration’s wishes and risk defying court orders or resist the changes at the agency and directly disobey their supervisors, putting themselves “at risk of insubordination and therefore unemployment,” the official said. Many have been choosing the first option, perhaps because the threat of losing their livelihood has felt so much nearer, and so much more tangible: They have now spent weeks watching colleagues resign, get fired, or be abruptly put on administrative leave. The environment at the agency has become suffocatingly toxic. “People are being screamed at, bullied, harassed,” one official told me. Some that once protested have since relented—perhaps because they now know that the immediate future will bring only more of the same.",

        "source": "https://www.theatlantic.com/",
        "content": "An eephus pitch is one of baseball’s many pieces of niche ephemera. It’s a weird trick throw that’s barely ever glimpsed in the professional game—an arcing lob of the ball, traveling at half the speed or less than a normal pitch; it exists only to catch batters off guard. In the director Carson Lund’s beguiling debut film, also called Eephus, a player named Merritt Nettles (played by Nate Fisher) specializes in tossing the pitch and rhapsodizes about its time-stopping sorcery: “It’s kinda like baseball. I’m looking around for something to happen—poof, the game’s over.”\n\nIf the previous paragraph made your eyes glaze over, you may not be the movie’s intended audience. But to me, these details are pure poetry, and so is Eephus. The plot-free hangout flick quietly has a ton to say about baseball’s eternal appeal, even as the sport weathers the passage of time. Set during the 1990s in Massachusetts, it follows the last recreational-league matchup between two groups of shambling, beer-guzzling baseball enthusiasts; they’re clashing once more before a planned development will pave over the site. Eephus is an elegy, but with just the barest hint of sentimentality—a shrugging send-off that simultaneously cares deeply about America’s pastime.\n\nThe film begins with the league’s sole enthusiast, Franny (Cliff Blake), settling onto the grass with his portable card table, his pocket binoculars, and his scorecard; slowly, the players begin to dribble onto the field. In red are the members of a team called Adler’s Paint, and in blue are the Riverdogs. The history between the two squads is irrelevant, and there’s barely any information to glean from their overheard dialogue. Instead, Lund (who also co-wrote the film’s script with Fisher and Michael Basta) revels in the minor details, such as the players’ many forms of inventive facial hair and their cute little practice rituals. The drama that does arise feels minor, too, such as a brief moment of panic when the Riverdogs realize that their ninth player hasn’t shown up yet, which would force them to forfeit.\n\nRead: Goodbye to baseball’s most anachronistic rule\n\nOtherwise, Eephus’s story never goes anywhere. Even though it’s clear that at least some of the actors know how to play the game, there isn’t much intense activity to take in. Over and over, the viewer sees shots of players briefly crouching in anticipation of something happening (namely, the delivery of a pitch to a batter), then relaxing when it doesn’t. That’s the magic of baseball: blissful anticipation, with the occasional chance for real action.\n\nIn lieu of narrative progression, Lund is singularly intent on generating an atmosphere that makes the viewer feel like they’re perched in the bleachers. The perfectly calibrated sound design contributes to this heavily; it is expansive and plangent, with the clack of the bat and popping of the ball heard more distinctly than the yelled instructions or friendly banter from base runners. The director’s attentive scene-setting helps transform Eephus into a dispatch from another era—a memory bouncing through the decades to somehow reach theaters today.\n\nThe throwback vibe is further cultivated by the cast, which comes across like a cheerfully old-school collection of performers. Among them is the Boston Red Sox alum Bill “Spaceman” Lee, one of Major League Baseball’s best-known practitioners of the eephus pitch back in the 1970s, who appears in a cameo role. The rest of the actors, most of them unfamiliar names, look like they could have walked onto the set through a time tunnel; their stringy beards, craggy faces, and protruding guts recall those of the players from Lee’s era. The renowned 95-year-old documentarian (and fellow Bostonian) Frederick Wiseman also joins to dispense pearls of wisdom in voice-over, dropping well-known quotations from the ball-playing greats between innings.\n\nRead: Climate change comes for baseball\n\nLooking backwards feels inherent to baseball, and I mean this in the warmest manner possible. The game is like the Academy Awards or burger making: an American tradition that, in my opinion, needs little in the way of reinvention. Still, although Lund isn’t going for any major tear-jerking moments, his movie invokes the melancholy sense of something important passing into the mists. None of the characters is able to use a smartphone or check social media, given the period setting, but the couple of kids sitting in the stands observe the amateur teams’ particular brand of fun as if it’s from the Stone Age.\n\nLund cited the Taiwanese director Tsai Ming-liang’s 2003 masterpiece, Goodbye, Dragon Inn, as an inspiration for Eephus. The comparison is apt on a surface level; Goodbye, Dragon Inn is a famous example of “slow cinema” set in a soon-to-be-closed Taipei theater—an antiquated edifice not unlike an aging ballpark. The film discursively follows some of the picture house’s regulars as they attend its last showtime. Beyond their similar presentations, it’s also Eephus’s kindred spirit thematically: Each one is a quirky ode to a particular hobby that is still extant in our life, albeit becoming something of a relic. Eephus succeeds as a beautiful portrait of a specific pastime. It’s also, delightfully, a low-stakes hang with some dudes swigging Narragansetts—much like baseball itself.",

        "content": "This article was featured in the One Story to Read Today newsletter. Sign up for it here.\n\nPeter greeted me in the mostly empty gravel parking lot of a Mennonite church on the outskirts of Seminole, a small city in West Texas surrounded by cotton and peanut fields. The brick building was tucked in a cobbled-together neighborhood of scrapyards, metal barns, and modest homes with long dirt driveways. No sign out front advertised its name; no message board displayed a Bible verse. No cross, no steeple—nothing, in fact, that would let a passerby know they had stumbled on a place of worship. When my car pulled up, Peter emerged to find out who I was.\n\nHe hadn’t been expecting a stranger with a notepad, but he listened as I explained that I had come to town to write about the measles outbreak, which had by that point sent 20 people from the area to the hospital and caused the death of an unnamed child, the disease’s first victim in the United States in a decade.\n\nOf course Peter knew why Seminole was in the news. He had heard that President Trump was asked about the outbreak here during a Cabinet meeting, and he told me that he didn’t like the attention. The Mennonites were being unjustly singled out. It wasn’t like they were the only ones who came down with measles. The coverage, he insisted, was “100 percent unfair.” He didn’t think it was just the Seminole area that had problems; he said that he had family in Canada and Mexico who had also gotten measles recently. I told him I’d heard that the child who’d passed away might have come from his congregation. He said that was true.\n\nPeter dug the toe of his boot into the gravel. I asked him if he knew the family. His voice broke slightly as he answered. “That’s our kid,” he said.\n\nPhotograph by Jake Dockins\n\nThe first case in the West Texas outbreak was announced on January 29. The official tally in the region grew to six over the next week. By Valentine’s Day, it was up to 48. On February 26, news went out that a child had died; by that point, 124 cases had been confirmed across nine counties, making the outbreak the largest that the state had seen in 30 years. The official count now stands at just about 200, and another person who was diagnosed with measles just died across the border in New Mexico.\n\nAn outbreak—even one this big—should not have come as a surprise. Vaccination rates have dipped in many states, including Texas, since the start of the coronavirus pandemic. In Gaines County, where Seminole is located, the measles-vaccination rate among kindergartners is just 82 percent, well short of the estimated 95 percent threshold for maintaining herd immunity. Even that alarming figure would appear to undersell the local problem. Many children from the county’s Mennonite community, which numbers in the thousands, are unvaccinated, but they won’t get picked up in state tallies, because they are either homeschooled or enrolled in nonaccredited private schools, which are not required to collect such data.\n\nPhotograph by Jake Dockins\n\nEven in the midst of a measles crisis, persuading parents in rural West Texas to vaccinate their children, or just to get tested for the virus, is an uphill battle. Zach Holbrooks, the executive director of the South Plains Public Health District, told me that he’s spent the past month trying to get the word out, particularly to the Low German–speaking Mennonite community. He asked three local churches if he could set up a mobile testing site on their property. They all refused. “I think there’s some sentiment that they’re being targeted,” he said, “and I don’t like the fact that they feel that way.” His team did create a drive-up testing site at a county events building next to the city park, and not far from the Masonic lodge. But he said that it gets very few visitors—about two or three a day. As a result, no one really knows the outbreak’s total size.\n\nRead: America is botching measles\n\nHelp from the federal government has been slow to arrive. Weeks into the outbreak, the Department of Health and Human Services directed 2,000 doses of vaccine to be sent to Texas. But Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the newly confirmed HHS secretary, initially reacted to the outbreak by claiming that it was “not unusual.” Since then, he has repeatedly reminded the public that the decision to be immunized is a personal one, even while acknowledging that vaccines “not only protect individual children from measles, but also contribute to community immunity.” He has also claimed that good nutrition might be sufficient to protect people from the worst effects of measles. “If you are healthy, it’s almost impossible for you to be killed by an infectious disease in modern times,” Kennedy falsely told Fox News’s Marc Siegel in an interview last week. He’d had “a very, very emotional and long conversation” with the family of the child who had died, he said; and later added that “malnutrition may have been an issue in her death.” Local health officials told The New York Times that the child who died had “no known underlying conditions.” A spokesman for HHS declined to comment.\n\nThere are a half dozen Mennonite congregations in Seminole, according to Google Maps. Peter’s church isn’t listed among them. Aside from a nonprofit filing, it does not appear to have any online presence. I knew of its existence only because I’d met a Mennonite man from another congregation at a coffee shop that morning and asked whether he knew the family of the child that had died. He said he’d heard they were from this church. When I asked him where it was, he responded with a word in Low German. That turned out to be a nickname for a neighborhood a little ways outside of town. After circling county roads for a while, passing a mix of homes, horses, and farm equipment, I stopped and asked for help from a group of boys playing in a field with rocks and sticks. They pointed in unison. The church was just half a mile up the road.\n\nThat’s where I encountered Peter, a wiry 28-year-old man with an angular face who wore a dark-colored, Western-style shirt and jeans. His English was uncertain, and he spoke with a light German accent. Sometimes he responded to my questions with silence.\n\nHe declined to reveal his daughter’s name or the family’s last name. Peter was perplexed by the national news coverage, and he did not seem eager to draw more attention to his family and community. He gave only his daughter’s age: She was 6 years old. When I asked him to describe her in more detail, he waved his hand, said she liked what other kids liked. But as we stood in the parking lot, he told me the story of what happened.\n\nPeter’s daughter had been sick for three weeks. The family knew it was measles. He said they took her to the hospital at one point, and she was given cough medicine. “That’s it,” he recalled. “They just say, ‘Go home.’ They don’t want to help us. They say, ‘It’s just normal; go home.’” (A spokeswoman for the Seminole Hospital District declined to comment, citing privacy laws.)\n\nPhotograph by Jake Dockins\n\nIt wasn’t normal, though. Her condition continued to deteriorate, so they brought her back to the doctors. “She just kept getting sicker and sicker,” he told me. “Her lungs plugged up.” Her heart rate and blood pressure dropped, and the doctors put her on a ventilator. “We were there Saturday ’til Monday, three days … and then it was worse, very bad.” Peter shook his head and stared at the ground. He said his daughter died on Tuesday night from pneumonia, which is a common infection in severe measles cases.\n\nPeter’s daughter was not vaccinated. Mennonite doctrine does not prohibit inoculations or modern medicine in general, though I encountered plenty of suspicion among Mennonites I spoke with in Seminole. I met a father who said that he wanted to vaccinate his two daughters but that their mother didn’t think it was a good idea. A grandmother told me she knew of several children who had been given the measles vaccine and were “never the same after that.” A man who'd spent his career installing irrigation equipment said he was suspicious of vaccines in part because he believed that the government had lied about the origins of COVID.\n\nPeter said that he has doubts about vaccines too. He told me that he considers getting measles a normal part of life, noting that his parents and grandparents had it. “Everybody has it,” he told me. “It’s not so new for us.” He’d also heard that getting measles might strengthen your immune system against other diseases, a view Kennedy has promoted in the past. But perhaps most of all, Peter worried about what the vaccine might do to his children. “The vaccination has stuff we don’t trust,” he said. “We don’t like the vaccinations, what they have these days. We heard too much, and we saw too much.”\n\n“They just say ‘Go home.’ They don’t want to help us. They say, ‘It’s just normal; go home.”\n\nDuring our conversation, several families arrived and went inside the building behind him. Mennonites are known for coming to the aid of fellow community members. Earlier in my visit, I’d heard a story about how Mennonites had paid off the mortgage of a young mother in the area whose husband had died in an accident. I asked Peter if he was getting enough support. He nodded: “Food, money—whatever we need.” Peter does construction for a living. He and his wife have four other small children. A couple of them appeared as we talked, grabbing at his sleeve, trying to get his attention. He leaned down to reassure them.\n\nThe death of his daughter, Peter told me, was God’s will. God created measles. God allowed the disease to take his daughter’s life. “Everybody has to die,” he said. Peter’s eyes closed, and he struggled to continue talking. “It’s very hard, very hard,” he said at last. “It’s a big hole.” His voice quavered and trailed off. “Our child is here,” he said, gesturing toward the building behind him. “That’s why we’re here.”\n\nPeter invited me to come inside the church building. He walked over to the door and held it open. I entered a small, dark, airless room with about a dozen chairs. Peter’s daughter was lying in the middle in a handmade coffin covered with fabric. Her face, framed by blond, braided pigtails, showed no sign of illness. Everything was white: her skin, her dress, the lining of her coffin, the thin ribbons that formed little bows on the cuffs of her sleeves. Her hands were clasped just below her chest. Members of her family were seated all around. No one looked up when I walked into the room. The only sounds were the trill of someone’s cellphone alert and the dry, hacking cough coming from one of her sisters in the corner.\n\nIt’s easy to dismiss statistics, to forget what they represent. Before the measles shot was introduced in 1963, the number of deaths caused by the disease in the United States each year was somewhere from 400 to 500. The CDC puts the mortality rate for childhood measles at one to three in 1,000, with one in five cases requiring hospitalization. Thanks to vaccines, the memory of that suffering has largely faded from public consciousness, at least in the developed world.\n\nWhat happened in Seminole, though, was a grim reminder. The day after meeting Peter, I visited the vaccination clinic across the street from the hospital where he had first taken his daughter. I had planned to interview people who were there to get their shots, but no one showed. It occurred to me that I was now at some modest risk myself. Families from Peter’s church had cycled through the visitation service the day before, sharing air inside that stuffy room amid their grief. Like a lot of people born before 1989, I’d gotten only one measles shot as a kid, so out of an abundance of caution, I rolled up my sleeve and got a booster. Later that day, I met up with Zach Holbrooks for lunch and asked him how many other people had gotten shots that morning. It turned out to be just one, and that one was him. He, too, had received just a single dose of the vaccine in childhood, so it seemed wise to get another.\n\nPhotograph by Jake Dockins\n\nAfter lunch, I made the six-hour drive back to Austin, where I live, past the pumpjacks slowly bobbing for oil and the towering wind farms. There’s nothing I heard in Seminole that I haven’t also heard from crunchy liberal friends at home who choose not to vaccinate their kids because they believe that vaccines contain toxins that cause autism or that childhood diseases bolster the immune system. (For the record, the 1998 paper that purported to show a link between vaccines and autism has been retracted, and research indicates that contracting measles can degrade your body’s ability to fight other infections.) Nor are Peter’s views that unusual in conservative corners of the country. A recent poll found that nearly one-third of all Republican and Republican-leaning voters, for instance, think that routine inoculations are “more dangerous than the diseases they are designed to prevent.” That’s the gist of what I heard from multiple Mennonites I interviewed. They are far from alone.\n\nAt one point in the parking lot, Peter had asked me why his daughter matters to the rest of the country. I’d struggled in the moment to come up with an answer. For Peter and his family, the loss of their daughter is a private tragedy, one that would be excruciating no matter how she died. The fact that she died of measles, though, is a sign that something has gone wrong with the country’s approach to public health. Twenty-five years ago, measles was declared “eliminated” in the United States. Now a deadly crisis is unfolding in West Texas.\n\nBefore I left the church that day, Peter and I talked for a few more minutes. “You probably know how it goes when somebody passes away,” he said. “It’s hard to believe.” Peter told me he didn’t have anything more to say. Really, what more could be said? Something unbelievable had happened: A young father was grieving the death of his 6-year-old from measles.",

        "source": "https://www.theatlantic.com/",
        "content": "Mycobacterium tuberculosis is a near-perfect predator. In 1882, Robert Koch, the physician who discovered the microbe, told a room full of scientists that it caused one in seven of all deaths. In 2023, after a brief hiatus, tuberculosis regained from COVID its status as the world’s deadliest infectious disease—a title it has held for most of what we know of human history.\n\nSome people die of TB when their lungs collapse or fill with fluid. For others, scarring leaves so little healthy lung tissue that breathing becomes impossible. Or the infection spreads to the brain or the spinal column, or they suffer a sudden, uncontrollable hemorrhage. Lack of appetite and extreme abdominal pain can fuel weight loss so severe that it whittles away muscle and bone. This is why TB was widely known as “consumption” until the 20th century—it seemed to be a disease that consumed the very body, shrinking and shriveling it. On a trip to Sierra Leone in 2019, I met a boy named Henry Reider, whose mix of shyness and enthusiasm for connection reminded me of my own son. I thought he was perhaps 9 years old. His doctors later told me that he was in fact 17, his body stunted by a combination of malnutrition and tuberculosis.\n\nThe cure for TB—roughly half a year on antibiotics—has existed since the 1950s, and works for most patients. Yet, in the decades since, more than 100 million people have died of tuberculosis because the drugs are not widely available in many parts of the world. The most proximate cause of contemporary tuberculosis deaths is not M. tuberculosis, but Homo sapiens. Now, as the Trump administration decimates foreign-aid programs, the U.S. is both making survival less likely for people with TB and risking the disease becoming far more treatment-resistant. After decades of improvement, we could return to something more like the world before the cure.\n\nRead: The danger of ignoring tuberculosis\n\nAnyone can get tuberculosis—in fact, a quarter of all humans living now, including an estimated 13 million Americans, have been infected with the bacterium, which spreads through coughs, sneezes, and breaths. Most will only ever have a latent form of the infection, in which infection-fighting white blood cells envelop the bacteria so it cannot wreak havoc on the body. But in 5 to 10 percent of infections, the immune system can’t produce enough white blood cells to surround the invader. M. tuberculosis explodes outward, and active disease begins.\n\nCertain triggers make the disease more likely to go from latent to active, including air pollution and an immune system weakened by malnutrition, stress, or diabetes. The disease spreads especially well along the trails that poverty has blazed for it: in crowded living and working conditions such as slums and poorly ventilated factories. Left untreated, most people who develop active TB will die of the disease.\n\nIn the early 1980s, physicians and activists in Africa and Asia began sounding the alarm about an explosion of young patients dying within weeks of being infected instead of years. Hours after entering the hospital, they were choking to death on their own blood. In 1985, physicians in Zaire and Zambia noted high rates of active tuberculosis among patients who had the emerging disease now known as HIV/AIDS. TB surged globally, including in the U.S. Deaths skyrocketed. From 1985 to 2005, roughly as many people died of tuberculosis as in World War I, and many of them also had HIV. In 2000, nearly a third of the 2.3 million people who died of tuberculosis were co-infected with HIV.\n\nRead: Tragedy would unfold if Trump cancels Bush’s AIDS program\n\nBy the mid-1990s, antiretroviral cocktails made HIV a treatable and survivable disease in rich communities. While a person is taking these medications, their viral levels generally become so low as to be undetectable and untransmittable; if a person with HIV becomes sick with tuberculosis, the drugs increase their odds of survival dramatically. But rich countries largely refused to spend money on HIV and TB meds in low- and middle-income countries. They cited many reasons, including that patients couldn’t be trusted to take their medication on time, and that resources would be better spent on prevention and control. In 2001, the head of the U.S. Agency for International Development had this to say when explaining to Congress why many Africans would not benefit from access to HIV medications: “People do not know what watches and clocks are. They do not use Western means for telling time. They use the sun. These drugs have to be administered during a certain sequence of time during the day and when you say take it at 10:00, people will say, ‘What do you mean by 10:00?’” A 2007 review of 58 studies on patient habits found that Africans were more likely to adhere to HIV treatment regimens than North Americans.\n\nIn the mid-2000s, programs such as PEPFAR and the Global Fund finally began distributing antiretroviral therapy to millions of people living with HIV in poor countries. PEPFAR, a U.S.-funded initiative, was especially successful, saving more than 25 million lives and preventing 7 million children from being born with HIV. These projects lowered deaths and infections while also strengthening health-care systems, allowing low-income countries to better respond to diseases as varied as malaria and diabetes. Millions of lives have been saved—and tuberculosis deaths among those living with HIV have declined dramatically in the decades since.\n\nStill, tuberculosis is great at exploiting any advantage that humans hand it. During the coronavirus pandemic, disruptions to supply chains and TB-prevention programs led to an uptick in infections worldwide. Last year, the U.S. logged more cases of tuberculosis than it has in any year since the CDC began keeping count in the 1950s. Two people died. But in some ways, at the beginning of this year, the fight against tuberculosis had never looked more promising. High-quality vaccine candidates were in late-stage trials. In December, the World Health Organization made its first endorsement of a TB diagnostic test, and global health workers readied to deploy it.\n\nRead: America can’t just unpause USAID\n\nNow that progress is on the verge of being erased. Since Donald Trump has taken office, his administration has dismantled USAID, massively eliminating foreign-aid funding and programs. According to The New York Times, hundreds of thousands of sick patients have seen their access to medication and testing suddenly cut off. A memo released by a USAID official earlier this month estimated that cases of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis will rise by about 30 percent in the next few years, an unprecedented regression in the history of humankind’s fight against the disease. (The official was subsequently placed on administrative leave.) Research on tuberculosis tests and treatments has been terminated. Although the secretary of state and Elon Musk have assured the public that the new administration’s actions have not disrupted the distribution of life-saving medicine, that just isn’t true. A colleague in central Africa sent me a picture of TB drugs that the U.S. has already paid for sitting unused in a warehouse because of stop-work orders. (Neither the State Department nor DOGE employees responded to requests for comment.)\n\nLast year, roughly half of all international donor funding for tuberculosis treatment came from the U.S. Now many programs are disappearing. In a recent survey on the impact of lost funding in 31 countries, one in four organizations providing TB care reported they have shut down entirely. About half have stopped screening for new cases of tuberculosis. The average untreated case of active tuberculosis will spread the infection to 10 to 15 people a year. Without treatment, or even a diagnosis, hundreds of thousands more people will die—and each of those deaths will be needless.\n\nBy revoking money from global-health efforts, the U.S. has created the conditions for the health of people around the world to deteriorate, which will give tuberculosis even more opportunities to kill. HIV clinics in many countries have started rationing pills as drug supplies run dangerously low, raising the specter of co-infection. Like HIV, insufficient nutrition weakens the immune system. It is the leading risk factor for tuberculosis. An estimated 1 million children with severe acute malnutrition will lose access to treatment because of the USAID cuts, and refugee camps across the world are slashing already meager food rations.\n\nFor billions of people, TB is already a nightmare disease, both because the bacterium is unusually powerful and because world leaders have done a poor job of distributing cures. And yet, to the extent that one hears about TB at all in the rich world, it’s usually in the context of a looming crisis: Given enough time, a strain of tuberculosis may evolve that is resistant to all available antibiotics, a superbug that is perhaps even more aggressive and deadly than previous iterations of the disease.\n\nRead: Resistance to the antibiotic of last resort is silently spreading\n\nThe Trump administration’s current policies are making such a future more plausible. Even pausing TB treatment for a couple of weeks can give the bacterium a chance to evolve resistance. The world is ill-prepared to respond to drug-resistant TB, because we have shockingly few treatments for the world’s deadliest infectious disease. Between 1963 and 2012, scientists approved no new drugs to treat tuberculosis. Doing so stopped being profitable once the disease ceased to be a crisis in rich countries. Many strains of tuberculosis are already resistant to the 60-year-old drugs that are still the first line of treatment for nearly all TB patients. If a person is unlucky enough to have drug-resistant TB, the next step is costly testing to determine if their body can withstand harsh, alternative treatments. The United States helped pay for those tests in many countries, which means that now fewer people with drug-resistant TB are being diagnosed or treated. Instead, they are almost certainly getting sicker and spreading the infection.\n\nDrug-resistant TB is harder to cure in individual patients, and so the aid freeze will directly lead to many deaths. But giving the bacteria so many new opportunities to develop drug resistance is also a threat to all of humanity. We now risk the emergence of TB strains that can’t be cured with our existing tools. The millennia-long history of humans’ fight against TB has seen many vicious cycles. I fear we are watching the dawn of another.\n\nThis article has been adapted from John Greens’s forthcoming book, Everything Is Tuberculosis.",

Sign up here.\n\nPresident Donald Trump’s administration is embracing AI. According to reports, agencies are using the technology to identify places to cut costs, figure out which employees can be terminated, and comb through social-media posts to determine whether student-visa holders may support terror groups. And as my colleague Matteo Wong reported this week, employees at the General Services Administration are being urged to use a new chatbot to do their work, while simultaneously hearing from officials that their jobs are far from secure; Thomas Shedd, the director of the GSA division that produced the AI, told workers that the department will soon be “at least 50 percent smaller.”\n\nThis is a haphazard leap into a future that tech giants have been pushing us toward for years. Work is being automated, people are losing their jobs, and it’s not at all clear that any of this will make the government more efficient, as Elon Musk and DOGE have promised.\n\nIllustration by The Atlantic. Sources: pressureUA / Getty; Thanasis / Getty.\n\nDOGE’s Plans to Replace Humans With AI Are Already Under Way\n\nBy Matteo Wong\n\nA new phase of the president and the Department of Government Efficiency’s attempts to downsize and remake the civil service is under way. The idea is simple: use generative AI to automate work that was previously done by people. The Trump administration is testing a new chatbot with 1,500 federal employees at the General Services Administration and may release it to the entire agency as soon as this Friday—meaning it could be used by more than 10,000 workers who are responsible for more than $100 billion in contracts and services. This article is based in part on conversations with several current and former GSA employees with knowledge of the technology, all of whom requested anonymity to speak about confidential information; it is also based on internal GSA documents that I reviewed, as well as the software’s code base, which is visible on GitHub.\n\nRead the full article.\n\nWhat to Read Next\n\nElon Musk looks desperate: “Musk has wagered the only thing he can’t easily buy back—the very myth he created for himself,” Charlie Warzel writes.\n\n“Musk has wagered the only thing he can’t easily buy back—the very myth he created for himself,” Charlie Warzel writes.

In a story for The Atlantic’s April issue, my colleague Adrienne LaFrance explores how Reddit became arguably “the best platform on a junky web.” Reading it in between editing stories about AI, I was struck by how much of what Adrienne described was fundamentally human: “There is a subreddit where violinists gently correct one another’s bow holds, a subreddit for rowers where people compare erg scores, and a subreddit for people who are honest-to-God allergic to the cold and trade tips about which antihistamine regimen works best,” she writes. “One subreddit is for people who encounter cookie cutters whose shapes they cannot decipher.

        "source": "https://www.theatlantic.com/",
        "content": "Not long ago, I spoke at a university in New Jersey. I told students about the 33 members of my family killed in the Israeli bombardment of Gaza. I described the horrors afflicting my homeland, made a plea for Palestinian independence, and decried the extremism of the government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\n\nI also said that Hamas’s kidnapping of Israeli women, elderly people, and children as hostages, and the killing of innocent civilians, were atrocities that did not represent Palestinian values and could easily be condemned without minimizing Palestinian rights or legitimate grievances.\n\nAgitators affiliated with Students for Justice in Palestine stood outside the lecture hall shouting. They called me a “traitor” and yelled, “Free Palestine!”\n\nHow did we get here? How did student activists in New Jersey who claim to represent Palestinians and to care about Gazans make even me, a Gazan American who has raised hundreds of thousands of dollars for humanitarian projects in Gaza, their enemy? The so-called pro-Palestine movement has no space for a Palestinian who opposes Hamas’s terrorism and promotes a future of coexistence with Israelis.\n\nThe moral and political failure of the diasporic movement for Palestinian rights is only one of several obstacles to the Palestinian pursuit of freedom, but it is a particularly telling one. After decades of displacement, military occupation, and political deadlock, we Palestinians have grown far more comfortable analyzing the role of Israeli decision making in worsening our conditions than we are reflecting on our own mistakes. To call for introspection is not to blame the victim or minimize the Palestinian plight. Rather, it is to recognize the desperate need for new thinking.\n\nThe Palestinian political leadership and its vision of the national project have manifestly failed to inspire meaningful action that could achieve progress. Wishing for the disappearance of 8 million Israeli Jews is not a policy. Hamas and its embrace of “armed resistance” have hijacked the Palestinian discourse. Activism in the diaspora has been captured by extremists—and so it, too, has become an impediment to Palestinian aspirations. In fact, the diaspora “pro-Palestine” movement has spent the past year and a half squandering a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to leverage international support for the Palestinian people. Right now, Palestinian independence is further out of reach than ever. And the fault is not only Benjamin Netanyahu’s.\n\nRead: Gaza’s suffering is unprecedented\n\nWhat Palestinian politics need, and grievously lack, is pragmatism. The conditions we now face are catastrophic in both the West Bank and Gaza: Palestinians have few resources, no military advantage, no political leverage, and virtually no economic viability on our own. Extremist Israeli officials have repeatedly threatened our people with expulsion. These realities mean that the time for maximalist demands and rhetoric is over.\n\nBut instead of evolving our approaches, many Palestinians are adopting an ever harder ideological line. That impulse stems in part from the imbalance of power between Israelis and Palestinians, and the feeling that adverse conditions are imposed on us from without. But to minimize Palestinian agency is also a mistake: We always have choices, some of which produce better outcomes than others, even under circumstances of constraint. If there is to be any hope for the remaining Palestinians to stay on our lands, we must refuse the cycle of hatred, incitement, violence, and revenge and seek instead a commonsense approach to one of the modern world’s most persistent conflicts.\n\nMine is certainly not a majority position among Palestinians. I have even been told by international media outlets that my perspective is “unrepresentative” and therefore not worthy of being heard. But our community is as diverse in its views as any other. The lack of a political home for divergent, moderate voices has left us without a space to exchange perspectives and stories, or to develop more sophisticated advocacy and policy efforts.\n\nI can envision a pragmatic approach to the Palestinian national project—one that rejects violent extremism and armed resistance in favor of a two-nation solution for Palestinians and Israelis. To be pragmatic means abandoning unhelpful and unrealistic demands, such as the right of return to land that has been part of Israel since 1948. It means accepting Israel’s existence, and understanding Israeli security as complementary to the Palestinian pursuit of freedom, dignity, and independence.\n\nTwo-thirds of Gaza’s population, and all of us who are descendants of 1948 refugees, would have to cease thinking of ourselves as perpetual refugees in our homeland and instead recognize the Strip as our final destination, where we will build our nation. This is a radical pragmatism, and it is desperately needed. (Ironically, embracing this sort of pragmatism would echo what the Zionist movement itself did in 1948, accepting something less than its leaders wanted in exchange for independence.) We would rebrand the embrace of peace and coexistence as courageous, and as necessary to the preservation of Palestinian lives, lands, and heritage.\n\nRead: There is no real-estate solution for Gaza\n\nSome precepts of radical pragmatism are these: Israel is here to stay; it will not be annihilated and can even be a helpful partner in a future that includes a Palestinian state. One cannot be pro-Palestine while also being pro-Hamas. The Oslo years were just one short chapter in the pursuit of peace, and the Palestinian Authority does not embody the full potential of nonviolence and reconciliation as a political strategy. The Palestinian national project must include building a state that can create jobs, pride, and future prospects for our people, not rockets, tunnels, Islamist repression, or corruption.\n\nMany things will become possible in Gaza once we recognize the necessity of political and security cooperation with Israel. We could establish an artificial peninsula off the coast, making use of the Strip’s geography; we could repurpose abundantly available rubble to build an airport and seaport, transforming access to and movement in and out of the coastal enclave.\n\nI have spoken with thousands of Palestinians over the years who believe, as I do, in the viability of a pragmatic path to peace. Extremists on both sides ignore or suppress our voices, choosing instead to promote narrow interests with maximalist rhetoric. The diaspora should not become their amplifier.\n\nRather, while Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank struggle with the harsh realities of their daily lives, those in the diaspora should help put forward a new Palestinian narrative—one that makes Jewish Israelis our vital allies in solving this conflict and ensuring the prosperous and secure future of both of our peoples. This is not a mere talking point but a necessity for Palestinian survival and self-determination.",

        "content": "This is an edition of the Books Briefing, our editors’ weekly guide to the best in books. Sign up for it here.\n\nNot long after COVID lockdowns began in the U.S. five years ago this week, many readers and writers started to wonder, with a mix of trepidation and curiosity, what the literature about the time period would look like. Half a decade on, we now have at least a small body of work that takes on the pandemic. In some cases, the calamity serves merely as a scene-setting device; in others, it’s a major plot point.\n\nFirst, here are four new stories from The Atlantic’s books section:\n\nAs Lily Meyer writes this week, she has taken a special interest in reading these books as they’ve trickled out. But she’s found a fairly common flaw: Many of them attempt to “overcontrol the experience of the pandemic” by leaning on descriptions of what happened. These novels remind readers of widely promoted images of middle-class lockdown—fashioning masks out of old scraps of fabric, wiping down groceries, catching up with friends and family over Zoom—but fail to transcend these rote recitations, or to capture other experiences of the early days of the pandemic. When the world knew the danger the virus posed but didn’t know how to prevent its spread, people lacked a sense of agency: All that many of us could do was wait for news about case counts and vaccines. A writer’s impulse to transcribe details from that time is perhaps an attempt to make that feeling more manageable. But “fiction that asserts too much control loses the possibility of transformation,” Meyer argues. Her point is that no matter what’s happening in the world, life is always unpredictable—and good literature understands this.\n\nMeyer notes that she hasn’t found a great pandemic novel yet. What form might this eventual writing take? One type of book she’s hoping for is “a great novel of the mind,” one that “will either reject or undermine the self-controlling impulse” to describe the textures of the early pandemic and will instead examine, in surprising ways, how the catastrophe affected people’s psyches.\n\nAs I read Meyer’s essay, I remembered Sarah Moss’s The Fell, a 2021 novel that I think may actually meet those criteria—at least in part. In it, a woman named Kate is quarantined with her son in her home in England’s Peak District after a COVID exposure. She quickly grows stir-crazy, and one night, violating government orders, she goes out for a hike—but at some point, she falls and can’t get up. Moss leaves Kate’s perspective to dip into the minds of her son, a kindly older neighbor whom Kate and her son provide with groceries, and a member of the rescue team searching for Kate in the dark and wet night. Though the novel is certainly descriptive, it might also qualify as what Meyer calls an “interior” work. The prose is written as a stream of consciousness, evoking a sense of anxiety that sometimes tips over into the truly scary.\n\nFor some, the experience of the early pandemic was not immediately life-threatening; often, it was an extended stretch of quotidian dullness spiked with moments of existential dread. But as one character thinks, “people don’t die of dread.” Moss doesn’t exaggerate the stakes of the pandemic for her characters. Instead, she cleverly puts one of them in a genuinely frightening situation that has nothing to do with COVID, reminding the reader that the unfolding events of our lives are, by definition, beyond our control.\n\nIllustration by María Medem\n\nThe Novel I’m Searching For\n\nBy Lily Meyer\n\nFive years after the pandemic, I’m holding out for a story that doesn’t just describe our experience, but transforms it.\n\nRead the full article.\n\nWhat to Read\n\nIf Not, Winter: Fragments of Sappho, by Anne Carson\n\nHardly any of Sappho’s work survives, and the fragments scholars have salvaged from tattered papyrus and other ancient texts can be collected in thin volumes easily tossed into tote bags. Still, Carson’s translation immediately makes clear why those scholars went to so much effort. Sappho famously describes the devastation of seeing one’s beloved, when “tongue breaks and thin / fire is racing under skin”; the god Eros, in another poem, is a “sweetbitter unmanageable creature who steals in.” Other poems provide crisp images from the sixth century B.C.E.—one fragment reads, in its entirety: “the feet / by spangled straps covered / beautiful Lydian work.” Taken together, the fragments are sensual and floral, reminiscent of springtime; they evoke soft pillows and sleepless nights, violets in women’s laps, wedding celebrations—and desire, always desire. Because the poems are so brief, they’re perfect for outdoor reading and its many distractions. Even the white space on the pages is thought-provoking. Carson includes brackets throughout to indicate destroyed papyrus or illegible letters in the original source, and the gaps they create allow space for rumination or moments of inattention while one lies on a blanket on a warm day. — Chelsea Leu\n\nFrom our list: Seven books to read in the sunshine\n\nOut Next Week\n\n📚 Firstborn, by Lauren Christensen\n\n📚 White Light, by Jack Lohmann\n\n📚 Hunchback, by Saou Ichikawa\n\nYour Weekend Read\n\nIllustration by Allison Zaucha / The Atlantic.

But the show has been an ongoing subject of passionate discussion because it is much smarter than that—it’s derivative in a winking way. It doesn’t merely borrow from its fellow reality shows; it adapts them into something that both celebrates reality TV and offers a sly, kaleidoscopic satire of the genre. It is a messy show that lives for drama. It brings a postmodern twist to an ever-more-influential form of entertainment. It’s not just reality TV—it’s hyperreality TV.\n\nRead the full article.\n\nWhen you buy a book using a link in this newsletter, we receive a commission.

        "title": "Invading Canada Is Not Advisable",
        "source": "https://www.theatlantic.com/",
        "content": "When I served as counselor of the State Department, I advised the secretary of state about America’s wars with Iraqi insurgents, the Taliban, Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, and al-Qaeda. I spent a good deal of time visiting battlefields in the Middle East and Afghanistan as well as shaping strategy in Washington. But when I left government service in 2009, I eagerly resumed work on a book that dealt with America’s most durable, and in many ways most effective and important, enemy: Canada.\n\nSo I feel both morally compelled and professionally qualified to examine the Trump administration’s interesting but far from original idea of absorbing that country into the union.\n\nThere are, as Donald Trump and Don Corleone might put it, two ways of doing this: the easy way and the hard way. The easy way would be if Canadians rose up en masse clamoring to join the United States. Even so, there would be awkwardness.\n\nRead: The angry Canadian\n\nCanada is slightly larger than America. That would mean that the “cherished 51st state,” as Trump calls it, would be lopsided in terms of territory. It would be 23 times larger than California, which would be fine for owning the libs, but it would also be 14 times larger than the Lone Star State, which would definitely cause some pursed lips and steely looks there. Messing with Texas is a bad idea.\n\nThe new state would be the largest in population too, with 40 million people—more than California by a hair, and considerably more than Texas, Florida, or New York. Its size would pose a whole bunch of problems for Trump: Canada is a much more left-wing country than the United States, and absorbing it could well revive the political fortunes of progressives. If its 10 provinces became 10 states instead of one, only three would probably vote for the GOP; the other seven would likely go for Democrats. That might mean adding six Republican senators and 14 Democrats. If Trump were impeached a third time, that might produce the supermajority required for conviction in the Senate.\n\nBut such political ramifications are purely academic considerations at the moment. Polling suggests that 85 to 90 percent of all Canadians cling to sovereignty. Having been denied the easy way of absorbing Canada, therefore, the United States might have to try the hard way, conquering the country and administering it as a territory until it is purged of Liberals, Conservatives, and whatever the Canadian equivalent of RINOs turns out to be.\n\nUnfortunately, we have tried this before, with dismal results. In 1775, before the United States had even formally declared independence from Great Britain, it launched an invasion of Canada, hoping to make it the 14th colony. The psychological-warfare geniuses in Congress ordered that the local farmers and villagers be distributed pamphlets—translated into French—declaring, “You have been conquered into liberty,” an interesting way of putting it. Unfortunately, the Catholic farmers and villagers were largely illiterate, and their leaders, the gentry and parish priests who could read, were solidly on the side of the British against a bunch of invading Protestants.\n\nThere were moments of brilliant leadership in this invasion, particularly in a daring autumn march through Maine to the very walls of Quebec. There was also a great deal of poltroonery and bungling. The Americans had three talented generals. The first, Richard Montgomery, got killed in the opening assault on Quebec. The second, John Thomas, died of smallpox, along with many of his men. Inoculation was possible, but, like today’s vaccine skeptics, many thought it a bad idea. You can visit the capacious cemetery for the victims on Île aux Noix, now Fort Lennox, Canada.\n\nThe third general, the most talented of the lot, was Benedict Arnold, who held the expedition together even after suffering a grievous leg wound. Eventually, however, he grew disgusted with a Congress rather less craven and incompetent than its contemporary successor and became a traitor, accepting a commission as a brigadier general in the British army and fighting against American forces.\n\nWe tried again in 1812. Thomas Jefferson, the original Republican, described the acquisition of Canada as “a mere matter of marching.” This was incorrect. The United States launched eight or nine invasions of Canada during the War of 1812, winning only one fruitless battle. The rest of the time, it got walloped. For example, General William Hull, like other American commanders a superannuated veteran of the Revolution, ended up surrendering Detroit with 2,500 troops to a much smaller British and Indian force. Court-martialed for cowardice and neglect of duty in 1814, he was sentenced to death but pardoned.\n\nSecretary of Defense Pete Hegseth is perhaps unfamiliar with the Battle of Chateaugay. The last three letters are, after all, gay, and as such, the battle has doubtless been expunged from Defense Department websites and databases, meeting the same fate as the Enola Gay. Still, it is instructive. An invading force of 2,600 American regulars encountered about 1,500 Canadian militia members, volunteers, and Mohawks under a Francophone colonel, Charles de Salaberry. They were defeated and had to withdraw.\n\nSince the War of 1812, Americans have not tried any formal invasions of Canada, but there was tacit and sometimes overt support for the 1837–38 revolt of the Canadian patriotes, a confrontation over Oregon (a sober look at the size of the Royal Navy dissuaded us from trying anything), and the Fenian raids of 1866 and 1870. The Fenians were rather like the Proud Boys, only better organized and all Irish, and they also ended up fleeing back over the border.\n\nPerhaps today’s Canadians are a flimsier lot. The Canadian armed forces are quite small (the army numbers only about 42,000, including reservists), although spirited and hardy. One should note with respect that 158 Canadians were killed fighting alongside American soldiers in Afghanistan. But even if the Canadian military were overcome after some initial bloody battles, what then?\n\nCanadians may have gone in for wokeness in recent years, it is true, but there is the matter of their bloody-minded DNA. It was not that long ago that they harvested baby seals—the ones with the big, sad, adorable brown eyes—with short iron clubs. They love hockey, a sport that would have pleased the emperors and blood-crazed plebeians and patricians of ancient Rome if they could only have figured out how to build an ice rink in the Colosseum.\n\nRead: Canada is taking Trump seriously and personally\n\nParenthetically, there remains the problem of the First Nations (as the Canadians refer to them), whom they treated somewhat less badly than Americans treated Native Americans (as we refer to them). There are about 50,000 Mohawks straddling the U.S.-Canadian border, and they are fearless, which is why you will find them building skyscrapers at terrifying heights above the street. As members of what used to be the Iroquois Confederacy, they were ferocious warriors, and they retain a martial tradition. It is sobering to consider that they may think, with reason, that we are the illegal immigrants who have ruined the country, and therefore hold a grudge.\n\nThere is a martial spirit up north waiting to be reawakened. Members of the Trump administration may not have heard of Vimy Ridge, Dieppe, the crossing of the Sangro, Juno Beach, or the Battle of the Scheldt. Take it from a military historian: The Canadian soldiers were formidable, as were the sailors who escorted convoys across the North Atlantic and the airmen who flew in the Battle of Britain and the air war over Germany. Canada’s 44,000 dead represented a higher percentage of the population than America’s losses in the Second World War. Those who served were almost entirely volunteers.\n\nBottom line: It is not a good idea to invade Canada. I recommend that in order to avoid the Trump administration becoming even more of a laughingstock, Secretary Hegseth find, read, and distribute to the White House a good account of the Battle of Chateau***. It could help avoid embarrassment.",

        "source": "https://www.theatlantic.com/",
        "content": "If there’s one thing most Israelis agree on after nearly a year and a half of war, it’s the need for a deep, impartial investigation into the catastrophe of October 7—laying bare what went wrong that day, beforehand, and possibly after. The demand for such an inquiry has escalated, voiced in equal measure by gaunt ex-hostages and the outgoing, guilt-ridden, military chief of staff.\n\nAnd if there is one thing that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu does not want, it is such an investigation. The reason isn’t hard to fathom. A serious probe will likely hold Netanyahu responsible for Hamas catching Israel unprepared. Its conclusions could echo the signs directed at the prime minister at street protests: You’re the boss. You’re guilty.\n\nCommissions of inquiry are the normal mechanism by which Israeli governance reckons with its response to extraordinary events. The procedure for creating one is enshrined in law: The cabinet votes to create the commission and defines the scope of its inquiry. The chief justice of the supreme court appoints the members, and a senior judge or retired judge chairs. In the weightiest investigations, the chief justice has chaired the commission. The panel can subpoena witnesses and documents. It can find individuals responsible for actions and omissions. The findings aren’t criminal convictions, but they can include recommendations to dismiss high officials.\n\nYair Rosenberg: Why 70 percent of Israelis want Netanyahu to resign\n\nThe best-known inquiry commissions have near-mythic status in Israeli memory. One investigated how Israel was taken by surprise at the start of the 1973 Yom Kippur War, and its preliminary report sparked the resignation or dismissal first of top generals and then of Prime Minister Golda Meir, ending her career.\n\nAnother examined Israel’s role in the 1982 massacre, by a Lebanese Christian militia, of Palestinians in the refugee camps of Sabra and Shatila in Beirut. The inquiry’s most resounding conclusion was that Defense Minister Ariel Sharon bore “personal responsibility,” because he “ignored the danger of acts of revenge and bloodshed” by the militia. Sharon resigned. Even when he became prime minister many years later, he did not hold the defense post again, as some prime ministers have done.\n\nWith rare exceptions, the law on commissions of inquiry requires the government to decide to investigate itself. This is the procedure’s weakness, but popular pressure has historically proved effective in forcing the government’s hand. Meir decided to create the commission that ultimately forced her out in response to the public anger, spurred by army reservists returning home from the front. Prime Minister Menachem Begin’s government understood that it needed to act after an estimated 400,000 demonstrators flooded central Tel Aviv in what was then the largest protest the country had ever seen.\n\nThis history best explains why the public today expects an inquiry commission, and why Netanyahu resists appointing one: Disasters beget commissions, and commissions can beget upheaval.\n\nPolling shows that up to 83 percent of Israelis, including a large majority of voters for parties in the ruling coalition, want a state inquiry into October 7. And in recent days, pressure for an inquiry has grown. One reason is that a slew of internal army investigations have been released, probing, among other things, the failure to defend border communities on the morning of the attack, and the years of overly sanguine assessments of Hamas.\n\nThose inquiries reinforce earlier press reports based on leaks and add frightening detail. The Military Intelligence Directorate had stopped listening in real time to Hamas walkie-talkies. It had acquired Hamas’s plan for an invasion of Israel—and dismissed it as purely aspirational. Completely misreading Hamas, the army believed that it was deterred from attacking Israel by the outcome of previous fighting. That bias led it to dismiss multiple signs of the impending attack in the hours before it began.\n\nThe army’s investigation and a parallel one by the Shin Bet counterintelligence agency lay out those bodies’ mistakes. Only obliquely, though, do they say anything about the decisions or negligence of the government. This makes sense; an army investigation of elected leaders would have the scent of a coup. But the publication of the army probes draws attention to the government’s refusal to be investigated.\n\nIt also fits a pattern. Generals have acknowledged that they let the country down; Netanyahu hasn’t. The military chief of staff on October 7 and after, Herzi Halevi, resigned just after the current cease-fire began in January and left office last week. The disaster occurred “on my watch, and I bear responsibility,” Halevi said when he turned over command. Then he added—pointedly, as Netanyahu was present—“It’s not right that only the Israel Defense Forces investigate an event like this. Establishing a state commission of inquiry is necessary and essential.”\n\nEarly this month, opposition parties managed to force the Knesset to hold a debate on establishing a state commission. An opposition parliamentarian read a letter from Yarden Bibas, who was taken captive on October 7 and released in the first stage of the now-stalled hostage deal. Bibas was still observing the traditional Jewish week of mourning for his murdered wife and two small children, whose bodies had been returned from Gaza. “I call on you, Mr. Prime Minister,” Bibas wrote, to “unite the people of Israel, bring peace to our souls, fulfill the will of the people and the [victims’] families. Announce today the establishment of a state commission of inquiry.”\n\nNetanyahu was required to respond, and he did so with a speech of more than half an hour that included jibes at the opposition and an attempt to link the former prime minister and outspoken government critic Ehud Barak to Jeffrey Epstein. On the inquiry issue itself, he conceded that “it’s crucial to investigate thoroughly everything that happened on October 7.” But, he claimed, a state commission would be “politically tilted” and its “conclusions known in advance.”\n\nWhat he and “a majority of the people” wanted, he said, was an “objective, balanced” inquiry panel. He appeared to be referring to plans that his inner circle had reportedly floated to get around the commission law, possibly by establishing an ad hoc parliamentary panel with coalition and opposition members. Under the commission law, Chief Justice Yitzhak Amit would choose the panel, and the retired chief justice Esther Hayut could conceivably chair it. The prime minister and his coalition regard both judges as too liberal—and too independent. But what they seem to be suggesting instead is to choose the panel on the basis of party, which would be overtly political, as well as lacking the long precedent and settled law of a state commission.\n\nRead: How Netanyahu misread his relationship with Trump\n\nNetanyahu was prime minister for 13 of the 14 years before October 7. A commission of inquiry might look into his strategic choice to allow Hamas to remain in control of Gaza as a means of keeping the Palestinians divided. It might also determine whether the notion that Hamas had been deterred, and so did not pose an immediate threat, was the army’s and that Netanyahu simply failed to question it—or whether generals shaped their evaluations to fit what the prime minister wanted to hear. Such an inquiry could determine what warning signs the prime minister may have ignored in the days and years before the catastrophe.\n\nIn Israel, a state commission of inquiry is not merely a judicial instrument or a means of settling facts. It’s a ritual of national closure that allows people to put events in order and move on. The commission’s summary of errors and of horrors, its assessment of culpability, its recommendations for the future—all of these help turn trauma into history.\n\nNetanyahu is more aware than anyone of what an inquiry might discover beyond what the public already knows. The longer and more insistently he opposes a state commission, the more he reinforces the expectation that he will be weighed in the balance and found wanting.",

        "content": "Decades ago, and probably extending well before that, there was a custom among middle-class Canadian families to send their sons out West to work on the railroad for a spell. The parents’ intention was not only to get the boys out of their hair for a while but also to toughen them up and introduce them to the ways of the world well beyond what would now be called their comfort zones. As it happened, one of my father’s sisters, Aunt Irene, was a vice president of the Canadian National Railways, a sprawling transportation network of trains, steamships, and grand hotels. It was as much a part of the Canadian national identity as the Bonanza star Lorne Greene and Hockey Night in Canada. Aunt Irene was a tall, thin, dignified woman. I don’t think I ever saw her when she wasn’t wearing a twinset and pearls. Family lore had it that during the final chapter of World War II, she had been the wire operator who sent word of Hitler’s death to news organizations across Canada. Afterward, she went to work for the Canadian National Railways, also as a wire operator, and rose through the ranks.\n\nExplore the April 2025 Issue Check out more from this issue and find your next story to read. View More\n\nEgged on by my parents, I wrote to her, asking for a job. I was 19 at the time. As she described it in her letter back to me, there were two types of positions available. I could be a groundman, at $2.20 an hour. Or I could be a lineman, at $2.80 an hour. Like any sane person, I had a fear of heights and said that I’d like to get a groundman’s job, which I was told entailed lugging equipment to the linemen, who climbed telegraph poles all day. Aunt Irene told me to report to the Symington Yard, in Winnipeg. With only a dim idea of what I was getting myself into, I boarded a train heading 1,300 miles west, to the capital of Manitoba.\n\nI stayed with my aunt the first night and reported to the railroad’s headquarters at 7 o’clock the next morning with a duffel bag of my belongings: a few pairs of shorts, jeans, a jacket, a couple of shirts, a pair of Kodiak work boots, and some Richard Brautigan and Jack Kerouac books, acceptable reading matter for a pseudo-sophisticate of the time. The Symington Yard was one of the largest rail yards in the world. On some days, it held 7,000 boxcars. Half that many moved in and out on a single day. Like many other young men my age, I was slim, unmuscled, and soft. In the hall where they interviewed and inspected the candidates for line work, I blanched as I looked over a large poster that showed the outline of a male body and the prices the railroad paid if you lost a part of it. As I recall, legs brought you $750 apiece. Arms were $500. A foot brought a mere $250. In Canadian dollars.\n\nThere were about 10 of us, and we were led to a room where a severe-looking nurse peered down our throats, checked our hearts, and then asked for urine samples. I filled the beaker to the very top by accident, and when the nurse attempted to pick it up off the table, she couldn’t help but spill a bit down her hand. Two of the tougher-looking recruits behind me thought this was funny, and one patted me on the back.\n\nBy the afternoon, I was on a train to a small town out on the endless Saskatchewan prairie—my head leaning against the window, my stomach aching from hunger—trying to think of a way that I could get out of this in a few weeks and go home. This was my parents’ idea of what I should be doing. Certainly not mine. A man with the big, meaty hands of someone who used them in taxing labor was sitting beside me. He had brought his own food, and out of a small pouch he pulled a roll that had been wrapped in waxed paper. His sandwich was like nothing I had ever seen before.\n\nI blanched as I looked over a large poster that showed the outline of a male body and the prices the railroad paid if you lost a part of it.\n\nTo me, a sandwich was something made of white Wonder Bread, with baloney or peanut butter and jam inside. But this was a round, soft roll, and the meat was thick and breaded. The man noticed me looking at the sandwich and quietly brought another one out of his pouch. He indicated that I should take it. I made a gesture to say, No, no, I couldn’t. But he just smiled and put it in my hand. I wasn’t sure if he spoke English. I unwrapped the waxed paper and bit in. It was breaded chicken with a glorious sauce. To this day, I don’t think anything I have ever eaten was as welcome or delicious. I thanked him profusely over and over, and he just kept nodding and smiling.\n\nWe pulled up to a siding, where the conductor said I had to get off. I did as I was told and stood by the tracks as the train pulled away. When it was gone, I looked around. The land was as flat as a billiard table and stretched for miles in every direction. On the siding was a collection of boxcars. A man waved to me in a menacing manner, indicating that I should get over to him, chop-chop-ish. I looked behind me and then turned back to him and gave a Who me? gesture. He nodded, and I hurried over and introduced myself. He said nothing. He was in his mid-40s and built like a refrigerator. His blond hair was short on the scalp. Enormous veins ran down his forehead and around his nose. He had terrifying bright-blue eyes and hands the size of a catcher’s mitt. His incisors were pointed, and one of his upper teeth was enameled in gold. He looked through me, pointed to a boxcar with windows on the side, and left. I walked over to the boxcar, climbed the steps, and opened the door.\n\nIt was a Saturday, not only a day off but also the day of new arrivals. Men of various ages and sizes were stretched out on the wooden bunks or settling in. There were eight beds on one side of the door and eight on the other. Nobody said a word, but a fellow who was lying down pointed a nicotine-stained finger in the direction of a bottom bunk at the back of the car. I thanked him and sat on the bed and looked around. I was the youngest in the group. Everyone was smoking. Everyone had a mustache. And everyone looked a lot scrappier than the people I was used to. The bed was as hard as the floor. There was a single pillow and a worn gray blanket that lay folded at the foot. As I was to learn in the coming days, all but one of the men had some sort of record—breaking and entering being at the bottom rung of achievement and grand theft auto being at the top. Petty thievery and criminal mischief were almost entry-level accolades. Working on the railroad may have been a hardening regimen for doughy middle-class boys; for others, it was a sort of French Foreign Legion way station between prison gates and semicivilized society.\n\nWe ate in what was known as the reefer car, a refrigerated boxcar. It was broken up into three parts. One part was the cold box, where ice and frozen meat and other provisions were stored; one part housed the kitchen; and the last part held a long communal dining table. On my first day, I sat down at the end of the table and was joined by a tall, fair-skinned fellow with curly red hair and a decent mustache. His name was Craig Walls. He wanted to be a writer and was taking a year off to earn money for his tuition at the University of Winnipeg. Canadian kids in those days tended to pay their own way through school. Annual college costs were in the $1,200 range, and therefore within striking distance if you worked in construction or on the railroad during the summer. There was a certain pride in the deepness of the blue in the blue-collar job you took. Construction was good. The railroad was better. Working in the oil fields of northern Alberta was the deepest blue of all.\n\nTwo others at my and Walls’s end of the bunk car became part of our circle, if you could call it that. One was a short, funny, wiry kid named Ernie, who had grand theft auto on his résumé. The other was Errol, a darkly handsome lady-killer. He had syphilis and said that it required him to have a small whisk device inserted into his penis at regular intervals to remove the thin scabs that formed there. I don’t know if he was kidding or not, but when he told us this, Walls and Ernie and I could barely speak. But it did make Errol seem awfully cosmopolitan.\n\nThe next morning, the newbies were called out by the fellow who had waved to me from the siding. He never announced the fact, but he was the foreman, and his name was Herb Harzbeck. He was German, and there was some talk among the vets on the crew that he had been in the war—on which side was up for debate. The vets called him “Squarehead” behind his back.\n\nOn the ground were piles of equipment for the newcomers. We were told to grab a set each. There was a big leather belt about four inches wide with slots for tools. There were also spikes attached to braces, with leather straps to hold them to your legs. These were called pole gaffs. The braces went from the instep to just below the knee. They strapped around the top of the calf and at the ankle, and there was another leather strap that went under the boot. After a few false starts, we managed to get the pole gaffs on and hobbled around a bit, the way skiers do with a new pair of boots. There was a pile of leather gloves with long gauntlets that came up almost to the elbow. We sifted through the lot, trying to find pairs that matched and fit. When we were suited up, Herb brought us over to one of the telegraph poles to show us how to climb: hands on either side of the pole; lean back, but not too far. And then drive the first spike into the wood. When that was set, drive the next spike in a little higher. Then the next one, and so forth. He was essentially walking up the pole, and he made it look easy.\n\nIt was not easy. I’d seen telephone repairmen back home climbing poles that had metal footholds all the way up, almost like ladders. But they wore safety belts that allowed them to lean back and fix whatever needed fixing. Here there were no foot grips. I asked Herb where the safety belts were, and he gave me a dismissive look. There were no safety belts. We took turns trying to climb the pole. There were a number of false starts and tumbles. I could get up maybe three steps before my arms gave out or one of my spikes didn’t dig in deep enough and I fell to the ground. This was all a terrible mistake, I kept thinking. At the end of the demonstration and my own feeble attempts, I worked my way over to Herb and said that there had been some sort of error—that I had signed on to be a groundman. “No groundmen,” he barked. “Just linemen.”\n\nOver the next couple of days, my general fear of heights and my more specific fear of falling off a telegraph pole began to subside. I managed to climb a 20-foot pole. And then a 30-foot pole. I began to get cocky, and in an attempt to scramble up one of the taller poles, I slipped near the top and shot straight down. In my shock and embarrassment, I didn’t notice it at first, but I had torn the front of my shirt and ripped big patches of skin off my chest. One of the patches held the few chest hairs I had grown by this point in my life. Herb took me to the reefer car. He cleaned off the blood and put a block of ice on my chest, which eased the pain. Then he wrapped my chest in a bandage. The skin began to heal in a couple of weeks, and within months was back to normal. And lo, where there had been a few sprigs, something approaching actual chest hair began to appear.\n\nGraydon Carter: Christopher Hitchens was fearless\n\nThat summer, I had been trying to grow my hair long. I wanted to be a hippie—or at least look like one. But one day, Herb motioned to me and Walls and made us sit down in front of him. He pulled an electric shaver out of his vest and shaved us to the scalp. Aside from the lack of a criminal record, which in this group was like working in a hospital without a medical degree, I wanted to stand out. There is nothing more parochial or bland than being a soft, white Anglican kid from Ottawa. I feigned being something of a Jewish intellectual. In this crowd, the mere fact that I had brought books singled me out as a great thinker. A few of the tougher hands took to calling me “Professor.”\n\nThose telegraph poles you see alongside train tracks served two purposes back then. One was for sending telegrams. The other was to enable dispatchers to know where the trains were at any given moment. The telegraph wires would eventually wear out, and our job as linemen was to haul fresh wire up the pole on our shoulders, remove the old wire, let it drop to the ground, and then connect the new wire to the glass insulators on the horizontal wooden spars. Once we had mastered the fine art of climbing, we were ready to be put to use. We were awake at 5 a.m., and after breakfast we suited up and stood around anxiously. Even in late spring, it was cold on a Canadian-prairie morning, a few degrees above freezing. We would wear two or three layers on top to stay warm. A group of us would climb onto a motor car—not one of those contraptions from silent movies, with hand-operated seesaw locomotion, but a motorized cart with benches big enough for five or six men on either side. We would be dropped off half a mile apart, on the assumption that we could each cover half a mile of track before lunch.\n\nIllustration by John Gall.

There was already a climber half a mile behind me. And in minutes, one would be deposited half a mile in front of me. Other than that, it was just me and nothing but flat prairie. The new telegraph line had been laid out alongside the track. The poles up ahead looked to be no taller than 20 feet. It took me two or three attempts to reach the top of the first one. Like all the others, it was covered in creosote, a black, sticky, coal-tar coating that preserved the wood but stuck to gloves, jeans, and skin. I survived the first pole. I survived the second pole. In four hours, I made it to the spot, half a mile beyond, where the climber after me had been dropped off earlier in the day. The temperature had risen 30 degrees between sunrise and noon, and I had gradually started to remove layers of clothing.\n\nThe motor car appeared in the distance and came my way. It stopped to pick up other climbers, and then every few hundred yards or so, we’d stop and grab the clothes we had all discarded as the temperature rose. This was in the days before bottled water, and by the time we were picked up, we were parched. There was a big cooler on the motor car, and a ladle. I opened the top and saw that it indeed contained water, but not just water. The surface was awash with dead flies and bits of grass. I dipped the ladle into the cooler and gingerly managed to get it out without picking up any extras. The water was warm and fetid. But it was wet, and I learned to appreciate it. We returned to the railcars for lunch, then went back out for another four hours.\n\nOne morning, Herb threw a bunch of canvas hats on the ground. “Take them,” he said. We each grabbed one. The hats came with a fine mesh that fell from the brim onto our shoulders. They were mosquito hats. We were heading into a patch where the black flies were horrendous. Black flies are not like houseflies. Canadian black flies are the size of a thumb tip, and they bite. For three days, we lived in those hats. We never took them off. We lifted the netting when we were eating to make way for food. We slept with them on too. At night, the sound of black flies smacking against the mesh screens was unnerving.\n\nEvenings were spent smoking, drinking, playing cards, and reading. Then the whole ordeal started again the next morning. Weekends were different. At sundown on Friday, we were given passes on the Canadian National trains and could travel as far as we wanted, as long as we were back at work and ready to climb at 5 o’clock sharp on Monday. On one of our first weekends off, Walls and I decided we’d try to make it to Winnipeg, about 600 miles to the east. I resolved to take a shower before leaving. The routine for this was highly labor-intensive. It involved going to the reefer car and chipping off a chunk of ice about half the size of a cinder block. You put the ice in a pail and then onto a stove to melt it. Then you took the pail and poured the water into a contraption that looked like a watering can and hooked it to the ceiling over the shower area. You pulled the nozzle down a bit, wetted yourself, soaped, and prayed there’d be enough water left to rinse off.\n\nThere were no sleepers available on that trip to Winnipeg, so they put us in the mail car, near the end of the train. We slept on sacks with the Royal Mail Canada logo on them. Old locomotives in those days had bunks right in the engine, and on a subsequent trip, Walls and I were allowed to sleep there. Meals were taken in the dining car. We were a pretty scruffy lot, so they usually sat us in the back, near the kitchen, where big, muscular men cooked up meals on long grills heated by gas jets.\n\nIn Focus: Jack Delano’s color photos of Chicago’s rail yards in the 1940s\n\nBy most Fridays, though, we were too worn out to travel. Saturdays were for writing home, reading, and the occasional water fight. The siding was equipped with dozens of fire extinguishers. They were big red canisters that you filled with water and then strapped to your back. There was a pump that you compressed with one hand, and a hose for the other hand. We’d load them up and divide into teams. Often it would escalate. During one fight, we climbed to the roofs of the boxcars and scampered across the tops the way gunfighters did in old Westerns.\n\nDuring one such water battle, we noticed an enormous machine off in the distance. As it approached along the track, we realized that it was a vehicle maybe two stories high and two or three times as long as a boxcar. It crept ahead slowly, deliberately, replacing old track with new track. Half of its large crew loosened the rails in front of the machine. And the other half tightened the new rails down in its wake. As the machine got closer, it became apparent that this was a much rougher-looking crew than ours. We put away our water cannons and just watched as the machine made its way slowly by us.\n\nThe water cannons were always filled for emergency use. Often this involved putting out brush fires that started in the midday sun when what were called “hot boxes” went by. These were overheated axle bearings that could accidentally ignite the brush. We’d be sent out on motor cars to extinguish the flames. On my first fire call, the wind picked up, and the flames licked skyward and singed my eyebrows down to almost nothing. They grew back, but never as thickly as they had been before the fire.\n\nWe were advised to stand well clear of the ditches that border the rails when the Super Continental, the railroad’s gleaming passenger train, whisked by every day. One rookie hadn’t heard this bit of useful information, and on his first day, as the train sped through, he got too close. He was soaked and a bit more: Someone had flushed a toilet. Back then, there were no holding tanks on trains; when you flushed, the waste just emptied onto the tracks. The Super Continental came by at the same time every day. Often we’d make a pact to pull our pants down and moon the passengers.\n\nOur cook got sick at one point and was sent home to Saskatoon. Herb announced that we’d each take turns cooking a meal. We had complained about the food when the cook was there. But with him gone, it deteriorated rapidly. I had never cooked a thing in my life. When my time came, I went to the reefer car to scout the provisions. There was a large leg of something, so I brought it to the kitchen. A coating of green covered parts of it, and I cut those sections off with a knife. And then I put the meat in the oven. I had no idea what temperature to set the oven at or how long to leave the meat there. I didn’t want to burn it, so I set the oven at medium heat and left it for three hours. I told Walls about this, and he told me I was out of my mind. We raced to the kitchen and opened the oven door. The meat had barely cooked at all. And given that it was about a foot thick, he told me that we would need another four or five hours at high heat. Dinner was late that night, and as we picked through the stringy, undercooked meat, I kept my head low to avoid the looks coming my way from my fellow diners.\n\nOur pal Errol had a habit of heading into town to pick up local girls. One night he returned a bit drunk and fell into his bunk. The lights were out and he drifted off to sleep. Sometime in the middle of the night, the door to the bunk car was kicked open, and all of us inside were jolted awake. Three men stormed in with flashlights, going from bunk to bunk. When the light shone into my eyes, I covered them with my hand. The men continued to move down the car until they got to Errol’s bunk. Two of them grabbed him and hauled him outside. We couldn’t see much in the dark, but clearly they were working Errol over pretty badly. Then they left, screaming obscenities, and made their way, flashlights in hand, across the open field. Walls and I ran outside to see if Errol was okay. He was. But just. He had a broken rib and a black eye and was bleeding from the head. We woke Herb and he came and bandaged him up.\n\nIn the morning, we heard the backstory. It seemed that Errol had tried to pick up one of the men’s girlfriend, and she was up for his affections. He left the crew a few days later, and we never heard from him again.\n\nI had signed on for six months, and as my tour of duty was coming to an end, I was still unsure about what I was going to do with my life. I’d had jobs before, but none like this. My parents weren’t alone in making sure their kids were busy during the summer, working at something, anything. An “allowance” was a thing we read about in American books and magazines. As a result, I was always digging around for pocket money. During winters, I had worked as a ski instructor at a local club and sorted mail at the post office over Christmas break. In the summers, I worked as a camp counselor and canoe instructor. I worked as an unarmed bank guard one hot summer, and I pumped gas.\n\nNothing I had done before, or pretty much anything I did after, could match the sense of accomplishment and sheer exhilaration of that half year on the railroad. I liked being around the crew, most of whom had endured hardscrabble childhoods and had just naturally gotten into a bit of trouble in their teens and 20s. When my stint was done, I packed my gear into my duffel bag and said my goodbyes to the other fellows. Walls and I kept in touch for a while, but in the days before the internet, this wasn’t easy. One day, a letter I had sent him came back with a stamp saying he had moved. A decade or so ago, I heard from a friend of his that Walls had died, which saddened me terribly.\n\nOut on the line on one of my last days, just before dusk, I was preparing to get picked up for the trip back to the bunk car when I saw the Super Continental in the distance. I clambered up to a field beside the tracks to watch it go by. It was traveling slowly, and in the pink late-afternoon light, I could see into the dining car. There was a young couple seated inside. They were nicely dressed and looked to be having a good time in the amber glow of the table lamp by the window. Lonely, tired, and dirty, I felt a million miles away from the attractive couple. It was then that I resolved that, whatever I did, I was done with showering at the end of the week rather than the beginning of the day. It was time to get on with the life I envisioned for myself. I wasn’t completely sure what that was going to be. But I knew one thing: I wanted to be on the other side of that window.\n\nThis article was adapted from Graydon Carter’s new memoir, When the Going Was Good.

        "content": "On May 17, 1954, a nervous 45-year-old lawyer named Thurgood Marshall took a seat in the Supreme Court’s gallery. The founder and director of the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund hoped to learn that he had prevailed in his pivotal case. When Chief Justice Earl Warren announced the Court’s opinion in Brown v. Board of Education, Marshall could not have known that he had also won what is still widely considered the most significant legal decision in American history. Hearing Warren declare “that in the field of public education the doctrine of ‘separate but equal’ has no place” delivered Marshall into a state of euphoria. “I was so happy, I was numb,” he said. After exiting the courtroom, he joyously swung a small boy atop his shoulders and galloped around the austere marble hall. Later, he told reporters, “It is the greatest victory we ever had.”\n\nExplore the April 2025 Issue Check out more from this issue and find your next story to read. View More\n\nFor Marshall, the “we” who triumphed in Brown surely referred not only, or even primarily, to himself and his Legal Defense Fund colleagues, but to the entire Black race, on whose behalf they’d toiled. And Black Americans did indeed find Brown exhilarating. Harlem’s Amsterdam News, echoing Marshall, called Brown “the greatest victory for the Negro people since the Emancipation Proclamation.” W. E. B. Du Bois stated, “I have seen the impossible happen. It did happen on May 17, 1954.” When Oliver Brown learned of the outcome in the lawsuit bearing his surname, he gathered his family near, and credited divine providence: “Thanks be to God for this.” Martin Luther King Jr. encouraged Montgomery’s activists in 1955 by invoking Brown: “If we are wrong, then the Supreme Court of this nation is wrong. If we are wrong, the Constitution of the United States is wrong. If we are wrong, God Almighty is wrong.” Many Black people viewed the opinion with such awe and reverence that for years afterward, they threw parties on May 17 to celebrate Brown’s anniversary.\n\nOver time, however, some began questioning what exactly made Brown worthy of celebration. In 1965, Malcolm X in his autobiography voiced an early criticism of Brown: It had yielded precious little school desegregation over the previous decade. Calling the decision “one of the greatest magical feats ever performed in America,” he contended that the Court’s “masters of legal phraseology” had used “trickery and magic that told Negroes they were desegregated—Hooray! Hooray!—and at the same time … told whites ‘Here are your loopholes.’ ”\n\nRead: The children who desegregated America’s schools\n\nBut that criticism paled in comparison with the anti-Brown denunciation in Stokely Carmichael and Charles Hamilton’s Black Power: The Politics of Liberation two years later. They condemned not Brown’s implementation, but its orientation. The fundamental aim of integration must be abandoned because it was driven by the “assumption that there is nothing of value in the black community,” they maintained.\n\nTo sprinkle black children among white pupils in outlying schools is at best a stop-gap measure. The goal is not to take black children out of the black community and expose them to white middle-class values; the goal is to build and strengthen the black community.\n\nAlthough Black skeptics of the integration ideal originated on the far left, Black conservatives—including the economist Thomas Sowell—have more recently ventured related critiques. The most prominent example is Marshall’s successor on the Supreme Court, Justice Clarence Thomas. In 1995, four years after joining the Court, Thomas issued a blistering opinion that opened, “It never ceases to amaze me that the courts are so willing to assume that anything that is predominantly black must be inferior.”\n\nThe Brown decision, Rooks writes, should be viewed as “an attack on Black schools, politics, and communities.”\n\nDesperate efforts to promote school integration, Thomas argued, stemmed from the misperception that identifiably Black schools were somehow doomed to fail because of their racial composition. “There is no reason to think that black students cannot learn as well when surrounded by members of their own race as when they are in an integrated environment,” he wrote. Taking a page from Black Power’s communal emphasis, Thomas argued that “black schools can function as the center and symbol of black communities, and provide examples of independent black leadership, success, and achievement.” In a 2007 opinion, he extolled Washington, D.C.’s all-Black Dunbar High School—which sent dozens of graduates to the Ivy League and its ilk during the early 20th century—as a paragon of Black excellence.\n\nIn the 2000s, as Brown crept toward its 50th anniversary, Derrick Bell of the NYU School of Law went so far as to allege that the opinion had been wrongly decided. For Bell, who had sharpened his skills as an LDF lawyer, Brown’s “integration ethic centralizes whiteness. White bodies are represented as somehow exuding an intrinsic value that percolates into the ‘hearts and minds’ of black children.” Warren’s opinion in the case should have affirmed Plessy v. Ferguson’s “separate but equal” regime, Bell wrote, but it should have insisted on genuine equality of expenditures, rather than permitting the sham equality of yore that consigned Black students to shoddy classrooms in dilapidated buildings. He acknowledged, though, that his jaundiced account put him at odds with dominant American legal and cultural attitudes: “The Brown decision,” he noted, “has become so sacrosanct in law and in the beliefs of most Americans that any critic is deemed wrongheaded, even a traitor to the cause.”\n\nIn her New Book, Integrated: How American Schools Failed Black Children, Noliwe Rooks adds to a growing literature that challenges the portrayal of the decision as “a significant civil rights–era win.” Rooks, the chair of the Africana-​studies department at Brown University, offers an unusual blend of historical examination and family memoir that generally amplifies the concerns articulated by prior desegregation discontents. The result merits careful attention not for its innovative arguments, but as an impassioned, arresting example of how Brown skepticism, which initially gained traction on the fringes of Black life, has come to hold considerable appeal within the Black intellectual mainstream.\n\nAs recently as midway through the first Trump administration, Rooks would have placed herself firmly in the traditional pro-Brown camp, convinced that addressing racial inequality in education could best be pursued through integration. But traveling a few years ago to promote a book that criticized how private schools often thwart meaningful racial integration, she repeatedly encountered audience members who disparaged her core embrace of integration. Again and again, she heard from Black parents that “the trauma their children experienced in predominantly white schools and from white teachers was sometimes more harmful than the undereducation occurring in segregated schools.”\n\nFrom the May 2018 issue: The report on race that shook America\n\nThe onslaught dislodged Rooks’s faith in the value of contemporary integration, and even of Brown itself. She now exhibits the convert’s zeal. Brown, she writes, should be viewed as “an attack on Black schools, politics, and communities, which meant it was an attack on the pillars of Black life.” For some Black citizens, the decision acted as “a wrecking ball that crashed through their communities and, like a pendulum, continues to swing.”\n\nRooks emphasizes the plight of Black educators, who disproportionately lost their positions in Brown’s aftermath because of school consolidations. Before Brown, she argues, “Black teachers did not see themselves as just teaching music, reading, or science, but also as activists, organizers, and freedom fighters who dreamed of and fought for an equitable world for future generations”; they served as models who showed “Black children how to fight for respect and societal change.”\n\nEndorsing one of Black Power’s analogies, she maintains that school integration meant that “as small a number as possible of Black children were, like pepper on popcorn, lightly sprinkled atop wealthy, white school environments, while most others were left behind.” Even for those ostensibly fortunate few flecks of pepper, Rooks insists, providing the white world’s seasoning turned out to be a highly uncertain, dangerous endeavor. She uses her father’s disastrous experiences with integration to examine what she regards as the perils of the entire enterprise. After excelling in all-Black educational environments, including as an undergraduate at Howard University, Milton Rooks became one of a very small number of Black students to enroll at the Golden Gate University School of Law in the early 1960s.\n\nSent by his hopeful parents “over that racial wall,” Milton encountered hostility from white professors, who doubted his intellectual capacity, Rooks recounts, and “spit him back up like a piece of meat poorly digested.” She asserts that the ordeal not only prompted him to drop out of law school but also spurred his descent into alcoholism. Rooks extrapolates further, writing:\n\nMilton’s experience reflected the trauma Black students suffered as they desegregated public schools in states above the Mason-Dixon Line, where displays of racism were often mocking, disdainful, pitying, and sword sharp in their ability to cut the unsuspecting into tiny bits. It destroyed confidence, shook will, sowed doubt, murdered souls—quietly, sure, but still as completely as could a mob of white racists setting their cowardice, rage, and anger loose upon the defenseless.\n\nThe harms that contemporary integrated educational environments inflict upon Black students can be tantamount, in her view, to the harms imposed upon the many Black students who are forced to attend monoracial, woeful urban high schools. To make this point, Rooks recounts her own struggle to correct the misplacement of her son, Jelani, in a low-level math class in Princeton, New Jersey’s public-school system during the aughts (when she taught at Princeton University). She witnessed other Black parents meet with a similar lack of support in guiding their children to the academically demanding courses that could propel them to elite colleges. In Jelani’s case, she had evidence that teachers’ “feelings were hardening against him.” He led a life of relative safety and economic privilege, and felt at ease among his white classmates and friends, she allows, even as she also stresses that what he “experienced wasn’t the violence of poverty; it was something else equally devastating”:\n\nWe knew that poor, working-class, or urban communities were not the only places where Black boys are terrorized and traumatized. We knew that the unfamiliarity of his white friends with any other Black people would one day become an issue in our home. We knew that guns were not the only way to murder a soul.\n\nFrustrated with Princeton’s public schools, Rooks eventually enrolled Jelani in an elite private high school where, she notes, he also endured racial harassment—and from which he graduated before making his way to Amherst College.\n\nseven decades have now elapsed since the Supreme Court’s decision in Brown. Given the stubbornly persistent phenomenon of underperforming predominantly Black schools throughout the nation, arguing that Brown’s potential has been fully realized would be absurd. Regrettably, the Warren Court declined to advance the most powerful conception of Brown when it had the opportunity to do so: Its infamously vague “all deliberate speed” approach allowed state and local implementation to be delayed and opposed for far too long. In its turn, the Burger Court provided an emaciated conception of Brown’s meaning, one that permitted many non-southern jurisdictions to avoid pursuing desegregation programs. Rooks deftly sketches this lamentable, sobering history.\n\nFrom the May 2014 issue: Segregation now ...\n\nDisenchantment with Brown’s educational efficacy is thus entirely understandable. Yet to suggest that the Supreme Court did not go far enough, fast enough in galvanizing racially constructive change in American schools after Brown is one thing. To suggest that Brown somehow took a wrong turn is quite another.\n\nRooks does not deny that integration succeeded in narrowing the racial achievement gap. But like other Brown critics, she nevertheless idealizes the era of racial segregation. Near Integrated ’s conclusion, Rooks contends that “too few of us have a memory of segregated Black schools as the beating heart of vibrant Black communities, enabling students to compose lives of harmony, melody, and rhythm and sustained Black life and dignity.” But this claim gets matters exactly backwards. The brave people who bore segregation’s brunt believed that Jim Crow represented an assault on Black life and dignity, and that Brown marked a sea change in Black self-conceptions.\n\nDesegregation’s detractors routinely elevate the glory days of D.C.’s Dunbar High School, but they refuse to heed the lessons of its most distinguished graduates. Charles Hamilton Houston—Dunbar class of 1911, who went on to become valedictorian at Amherst and the Harvard Law Review’s first Black editor—nevertheless dedicated his life to eradicating Jim Crow as an NAACP litigator and Thurgood Marshall’s mentor in his work contesting educational segregation. Sterling A. Brown—Dunbar class of 1918, who graduated from Williams College before becoming a distinguished poet and professor—nevertheless wrote the following in 1944, one decade before Brown:\n\nNegroes recognize that the phrase “equal but separate accommodations” is a myth. They have known Jim Crow a long time, and they know Jim Crow means scorn and not belonging.\n\nMuch as they valued having talented, caring teachers, these men understood racial segregation intimately, and they detested it.\n\nIn the 1990s, Nelson B. Rivers III, an unheralded NAACP official from South Carolina, memorably heaved buckets of cold water on those who were beginning to wonder, “ Was integration the right thing to do? Was it worth it? Was Brown a good decision?” Rivers dismissed such questions as “asinine,” and continued:\n\nTo this day, I can remember bus drivers pulling off and blowing smoke in my mother’s face. I can remember the back of the bus, colored water fountains … I can hear a cop telling me, “Take your black butt back to nigger town.” What I tell folk … is that there are a lot of romanticists now who want to take this trip down Memory Lane, and they want to go back, and I tell the young people that anybody who wants to take you back to segregation, make sure you get a round-trip ticket because you won’t stay.\n\nNostalgia for the pre-Brown era would not exercise nearly so powerful a grip on Black America today if its adherents focused on its detailed, pervasive inhumanities rather than relying on gauzy glimpses.\n\nNo one has pressed this point more vividly than Robert L. Carter, who worked alongside Marshall at the LDF before eventually becoming a distinguished federal judge. He understood that to search for Brown’s impact exclusively in the educational domain is mistaken. Instead, he emphasized that Brown fomented a broad-gauge racial revolution throughout American public life. Despite Chief Justice Warren formally writing the opinion to apply exclusively to education, its attack on segregation has—paradoxically—been most efficacious beyond that original context.\n\nFrom the October 1967 issue: Jonathan Kozol’s ‘Where Ghetto Schools Fail’\n\n“The psychological dimensions of America’s race relations problem were completely recast” by Brown, Carter wrote. “Blacks were no longer supplicants seeking, pleading, begging to be treated as full-fledged members of the human race; no longer were they appealing to morality, to conscience, to white America’s better instincts,” he noted. “They were entitled to equal treatment as a right under the law; when such treatment was denied, they were being deprived—in fact robbed—of what was legally theirs. As a result, the Negro was propelled into a stance of insistent militancy.”\n\nEven within the educational sphere, though, it is profoundly misguided to claim that Black students who attend solid, meaningfully integrated schools encounter environments as corrosive as, or worse than, those facing students trapped in ghetto schools. This damned-if-you-do, damned-if-you-don’t analysis suggests an entire cohort stuck in the same boat, when its many members are not even in the same ocean. The Black student marooned in a poor and violent neighborhood, with reason to fear actual murder, envies the Black student attending a rigorous, integrated school who worries about metaphorical “soul murder.” All struggles are not created equal.\n\nThis article appears in the April 2025 print edition with the headline “Was Integration the Wrong Goal?”",

        "title": "Was Sam Altman Right About the Job Market?",
        "source": "https://www.theatlantic.com/",
        "content": "The automated future just lurched a few steps closer. Over the past few weeks, nearly all of the major AI firms—OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, xAI, Amazon, Microsoft, and Perplexity, among others—have announced new products that are focused not on answering questions or making their human users somewhat more efficient, but on completing tasks themselves. They are being pitched for their ability to “reason” as people do and serve as “agents” that will eventually carry out complex work from start to finish.\n\nHumans will still nudge these models along, of course, but they are engineered to help fewer people do the work of many. Last month, Anthropic launched Claude Code, a coding program that can do much of a human software developer’s job but far faster, “reducing development time and overhead.” The program actively participates in the way that a colleague would, writing and deploying code, among other things. Google now has a widely available “workhorse model,” and three separate AI companies have products named Deep Research, all of which quickly gather and synthesize huge amounts of information on a user’s behalf. OpenAI touts its version’s ability to “complete multi-step research tasks for you” and accomplish “in tens of minutes what would take a human many hours.”\n\nAI companies have long been building and benefiting from the narrative that their products will eventually be able to automate major projects for their users, displacing jobs and perhaps even entire professions or sectors of society. As early as 2016, Sam Altman, who had recently co-founded OpenAI, wrote in a blog post that “as technology continues to eliminate traditional jobs,” new economic models might be necessary, such as a universal basic income; he has warned repeatedly since then that AI will disrupt the labor market, telling my colleague Ross Andersen in 2023 that “jobs are definitely going to go away, full stop.”\n\nDespite the foreboding nature of these comments, they have remained firmly in the realm of speculation. Two years ago, ChatGPT couldn’t perform basic arithmetic, and critics have long harped on the technology’s biases and mythomania. Chatbots and AI-powered image generators became known for helping kids cheat on homework and flooding the web with low-grade content. Meaningful applications quickly emerged in some professions—coding, fielding customer-service queries, writing boilerplate copy—but even the best AI models were clearly not capable enough to precipitate widespread job displacement.\n\nRead: A chatbot is secretly doing my job\n\nSince then, however, two transformations have taken place. First, AI search became standard. Chatbots exploded in popularity because they could lucidly—though frequently inaccurately—answer human questions. Billions of people were already accustomed to asking questions and finding information online, making this an obvious use case for AI models that might otherwise have seemed like research projects: Now 300 million people use ChatGPT every week, and more than 1 billion use Google’s AI Overview, according to the companies. Further underscoring the products’ relevance, media companies—including The Atlantic—signed lucrative deals with OpenAI and others to add their content to AI search, bringing both legitimacy and some additional scrutiny to the technology. Hundreds of millions were habituated to AI, and at least some portion have found the technology helpful.\n\nBut although plain chatbots and AI search introduced a major cultural shift, their business prospects were always small potatoes for the tech giants. Compared with traditional search algorithms, AI algorithms are more expensive to run. And search is an old business model that generative AI could only enhance—perhaps resulting in a few more clicks on paid advertisements or producing a bit more user data for targeting future advertisements.\n\nRefining and expanding generative AI to do more for the professional class—not just students scrambling on term papers—is where tech companies see the real financial opportunity. And they’ve been building toward seizing it. The second transformation that has led to this new phase of the AI era is simply that the technology, while still riddled with biases and inaccuracies, has legitimately improved. The slate of so-called reasoning models released in recent months, such as OpenAI’s o3-mini and xAI’s Grok 3, has impressed in particular. These AI products can be genuinely helpful, and their applications to advancing scientific research could prove lifesaving. Economists, doctors, coders, and other professionals are widely commenting on how these new models can expedite their work; a quarter of tech start-ups in this year’s cohort at the prestigious incubator Y Combinator said that 95 percent of their code was generated with AI. Major firms—McKinsey, Moderna, and Salesforce, to name just a handful—are now using it in basically every aspect of their businesses. And the models continue getting cheaper, and faster, to deploy.\n\nRead: The GPT era is already ending\n\nTech executives, in turn, have grown blunt about their hopes that AI will become good enough to do a human’s work. In a Meta earnings call in late January, CEO Mark Zuckerberg said, “2025 will be the year when it becomes possible to build an AI engineering agent” that’s as skilled as “a good, mid-level engineer.” Dario Amodei, the CEO of Anthropic, recently said in a talk with the Council on Foreign Relations that AI will be “writing 90 percent of the code” just a few months from now—although still with human specifications, he noted. But he continued, “We will eventually reach the point where the AIs can do everything that humans can,” in every industry. (Amodei, it should be mentioned, is the ultimate techno-optimist; in October, he published a sprawling manifesto, titled “Machines of Loving Grace,” that posited AI development could lead to “the defeat of most diseases, the growth in biological and cognitive freedom, the lifting of billions of people out of poverty to share in the new technologies, a renaissance of liberal democracy and human rights.”) Altman has used similarly grand language recently, imagining countless virtual knowledge workers fanning out across industries.\n\nThese bright visions have dimmed considerably when put into practice: Elon Musk and the Department of Government Efficiency’s efforts to replace human civil servants with AI may be the clearest and most dramatic execution of this playbook yet, with massive job loss and little more than chaos to show for it so far. Meanwhile, all of generative-AI models’ issues with bias, inaccuracy, and poor citations remain, even as the technology has advanced. OpenAI’s image-generating technology still struggles at times to produce people with the right number of appendages. Salesforce is reportedly struggling to sell its AI agent, Agentforce, to customers because of issues with accuracy and concerns about the product’s high cost, among other things. Nevertheless, the corporation has pressed on with its pitch, much as other AI companies have continued to iterate on and promote products with known issues. (In a recent earnings call, Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff said the firm has “3,000 paying Agentforce customers who are experiencing unprecedented levels of productivity.”) In other words, flawed products won’t stop tech companies’ push to automate everything—the AI-saturated future will be imperfect at best, but it is coming anyway.\n\nThe industry’s motivations are clear: Google’s and Microsoft’s cloud businesses, for instance, grew rapidly in 2024, driven substantially by their AI offerings. Meta’s head of business AI, Clara Shih, recently told CNBC that the company expects “every business” to use AI agents, “the way that businesses today have websites and email addresses.” OpenAI is reportedly considering charging $20,000 a month for access to what it describes as Ph.D.-level research agents.\n\nGoogle and Perplexity did not respond to a request for comment, and a Microsoft spokesperson declined to comment. An OpenAI spokesperson pointed me to an essay from September in which Altman wrote, “I have no fear that we’ll run out of things to do.” He could well be right; the Bureau of Labor Statistics projects AI to substantially increase the demand for computer and business occupations through 2033. A spokesperson for Anthropic referred me to the start-up’s initiative to study and prepare for AI’s effect on the labor market. The effort’s first research paper analyzed millions of conversations with Anthropic’s Claude model and found that it was used to “automate” human work in 43 percent of cases, such as identifying and fixing a software bug.\n\nTech companies are revealing, more clearly than ever, their vision for a post-work future. ChatGPT started the generative-AI boom not with an incredible business success, but with a psychological one. The chatbot was and is still possibly losing the company money, but it exposed internet users around the world to the first popular computer program that could hold an intelligent conversation on any subject. The advent of AI search may have performed a similar role, presenting limited opportunity for immediate profits but habituating—or perhaps inoculating—millions of people to bots that can think, write, and live for you.",

        "title": "The GOP’s Fears About Musk Are Growing",
        "source": "https://www.theatlantic.com/",
        "content": "Representative Richard Hudson has a bold prediction for how Donald Trump and Elon Musk’s purge of the federal government will play out for his party in next year’s elections. “I think voters are going to reward us,” the North Carolina Republican told me. “The Democrats have made a huge miscalculation by establishing themselves as the party defending waste, fraud, and abuse.”\n\nAs chair of the National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC), Hudson is tasked with keeping the GOP in power, and his enthusiasm suggests that the party leadership won’t be backing away from Musk and his Department of Government Efficiency anytime soon. When I asked Hudson whether he had any concerns about DOGE or its billionaire leader, he replied quickly and unequivocally: “Not at all.”\n\nSome of Hudson’s Republican colleagues aren’t so sure. They’ve seen the polls showing how unpopular Musk and DOGE are. They’ve heard from angry voters at town-hall meetings who are worried about the loss of jobs and government services. And now they’ve begun registering their own complaints with the White House and DOGE staffers, both in private and in group meetings that Musk has attended.\n\nRead: DOGE is courting catastrophic risk\n\nThe GOP’s fears about DOGE appear to be growing, based on conversations I had with a dozen House Republicans this week. Several of them suggested to me that the Trump administration’s campaign to slash the federal workforce could threaten not only their constituents but also their party’s chance to retain its narrow majority.\n\n“There needs to be more of a strategic approach,” Representative Dan Newhouse, a sixth-term Republican from Washington State, told me. “A lot of the directives seem to be arbitrary.” Newhouse said he had expressed concerns to the White House about agricultural cuts in his district and told the administration that DOGE shouldn’t ignore Congress. “It can’t be just one entity” making spending decisions, he said.\n\nRepresentative Pete Sessions of Texas, a former chair of the NRCC, told me that DOGE’s leadership had failed to adequately communicate to the public what the agency is doing and why. “It’s been controversial,” Sessions said. “There’s a lot of good that has come from it, but it needs to be more organized, better explained.”\n\nIn gently criticizing DOGE, Republicans seem to be weighing their desire to reduce the government’s size and scope—which they have campaigned on for decades—against their unease with the way the administration is going about it. Musk has gloated about feeding entire agencies “into the wood chipper,” and neither he nor Trump has expressed much interest in consulting the branch of government that putatively controls federal spending. (Some Republicans did tell me, however, that in private, Musk has become more receptive to their concerns.) “What people say is Be professional,” Representative Austin Scott of Georgia told me when I asked him what he was hearing about DOGE from his constituents. He repeated the message: “Be professional.”\n\nRead: DOGE’s plans to replace humans with AI are already under way\n\nEven Hudson has sent signals to Republicans that might give them reason to doubt his stated confidence about DOGE’s popularity: Last week he privately urged House Republicans to avoid in-person town halls in favor of teleconferences, which they could more easily control. In our interview, Hudson defended the directive by accusing Democratic activists of “hijacking” public forums in GOP districts. His advice to Republican lawmakers: “If the real people in the district are upset, yeah, you need to take it to heart.”\n\nSo far, the Republican gripes about DOGE fall far short of a revolt. Indeed, a revolt hardly seems likely in today’s GOP. In his second term, the president has demanded complete loyalty from Republicans in Congress—“NO DISSENT,” Trump warned on the eve of a vote this week on government funding—and with few exceptions, his party has complied.\n\nWhen a single House Republican, Representative Thomas Massie of Kentucky, defected on the funding vote, Trump called for him to face a primary challenger and said he’d meet the same fate as former Representative Liz Cheney of Wyoming, who lost her seat after turning on Trump. The next day, The New York Times reported that Musk wanted to contribute $100 million to a group backing Trump’s agenda—a sign that Musk might be willing to use his wealth to help the president keep his party in line.\n\nSome of the Republicans I spoke with were all in on DOGE, especially those from districts that Trump easily carried. Representative Andy Harris, the chair of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, told me that voters in his Maryland district “don’t want their taxpayer dollars paying for fraud, waste, and abuse.” “They want the administration to get to the bottom of it,” Harris said. “They appreciate the efforts that are being made.”\n\nYet because of its proximity to Washington, D.C., Harris’s district includes one of the highest percentages of federal workers of any area represented by a Republican in Congress. I asked him what he’d say to a constituent who had lost their job because of DOGE’s cuts. “I say the same thing to people who are laid off from private industries that have become bloated and inefficient: Look, that’s the way the American economy works,” Harris replied.\n\nSome Republicans began our conversation by voicing unqualified support for Trump and Musk—and ended by contemplating the dangers that DOGE poses to their districts. “I can’t tell you the amount of people that came up to me saying, Keep it up. We want this. We need it. The government has been growing so much,” Representative Juan Ciscomani of Arizona told me. Unlike Harris, who won his reelection easily last year, Ciscomani prevailed only narrowly in one of the nation’s most competitive House races.\n\nBut when I asked about his constituents whose jobs could be jeopardized by federal cuts, Ciscomani’s tone shifted. The southeast corner of Arizona that he represents includes the state’s largest passport-processing center as well as a large number of military veterans, who rely on—and in some cases work at—the Veterans Affairs facilities located in his district. Ciscomani would prefer that Trump and Musk not touch those areas. “I will stand the line on that and defend that,” he told me. Ciscomani said he represents nearly 25,000 federal employees; for comparison, he won reelection last year by only about 10,000 votes. “I’ve got a lot of stake in this, a lot of skin in the game for my district to make sure that we protect these areas,” he said.\n\nTo the frustration of Democrats, some senior Republicans who communicated their concerns to the White House have won reprieves for federal facilities in their districts that the administration wanted to close. And many GOP lawmakers welcomed Trump’s statement last week indicating that Cabinet secretaries, not Musk, would be in charge of staffing reductions at their agencies—an announcement that followed a reported clash between the DOGE chief and Secretary of State Marco Rubio.\n\nRead: Is DOGE losing steam?\n\nEven though Republicans are starting to feel more backlash over DOGE, they declined a key opportunity this week to wrest back their spending power. On Tuesday, the GOP House majority passed a six-month government-funding bill that did little to restore (or codify) the cuts that Trump and Musk are making. Republican negotiators also rejected Democratic demands to add language to the legislation that would restrain DOGE. As a result, Democrats said the bill further empowers the Trump administration to make cuts unilaterally—an argument that GOP leaders themselves then used to win the support of conservative hard-liners.\n\nIn some respects, the spending bill is an odd proposal for Republicans to rally around. It would extend Biden-era funding levels through the first eight months of the GOP governing trifecta. Republicans have, in effect, voted to keep spending money on agencies, such as the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, that the Trump administration has all but shut down. GOP leaders say the move buys the party time to develop a budget that locks in the cuts that Musk has identified and, in many cases, already made. But it also prevents Republicans from having to take politically difficult votes that they’ve dodged in the past. When I asked Andy Harris why Republicans wouldn’t vote to cut spending on USAID—an agency that no longer exists, thanks to Musk’s wood chipper—he replied, “We don’t have to.”\n\nHudson said the decision to forgo major cuts in this funding bill was a matter of prudence. “We can’t just cut blindly,” he told me. “We have to know what we’re cutting.” It’s a message that some House Republicans wish he would deliver to Elon Musk.",

        "title": "The Kind of Thing Dictators Do",
        "source": "https://www.theatlantic.com/",
        "content": "Finding someone whose politics you don’t like and using some flimsy excuse to put him in handcuffs is the kind of thing dictators do. In the United States, we pride ourselves on front-loading our political tests: Once you are a citizen, you can say just about anything you want without government interference, but on your road to naturalization, the government can pull you over for certain speech infractions, such as saying nice things about terrorism or expressing a desire to overthrow the American government. The Trump administration may have had such infractions in mind last weekend, when it detained Mahmoud Khalil, a Syrian Palestinian graduate student with U.S. permanent residency, and said it planned to eject him from the country for leading anti-Israel protests at Columbia University.\n\nOthers have remarked on the legality of this move. The administration still hasn't clearly articulated its case for deporting Khalil. But what little is known about Khalil's activities and the government's case makes me think the decision to deport is most remarkable for its pettiness, its insecurity, and its simultaneous failure to grasp the spirit of America and of academia at their best. Some countries repress dissent; others tolerate it. America is nearly alone in encouraging, even glorifying, it, and giving dissenters every chance to persuade others to their side. One of the more insidious erosions of American power is the implication, by this move, that the United States can no longer withstand the criticism of people like Khalil, and would be stronger without them.\n\nKhalil was scheduled to graduate in May with a master’s degree in public affairs. The Trump administration’s suggestion that Khalil “support[s] a terrorist-type organization” seems to be at best an inference from his vigorous rabble-rousing against Israel and the war in Gaza on the Columbia campus, where he’s been a spokesperson and lead negotiator for the anti-Israel coalition Columbia University Apartheid Divest (CUAD). Khalil’s representatives say he is simply advocating for the human rights of Palestinians.\n\nThe protesters at Columbia seem to favor an approach that might be described as no Palestinian enemies, no Israeli friends. It is unclear which of CUAD’s pronouncements—ranging from reasonable to deranged—Khalil personally agrees with. If he is in favor of human rights, he should oppose CUAD’s unsigned statements, uniformly on the deranged end of the spectrum. They celebrate violence (“the necessity of imposing our demands through force”) and deplore those who try to effect change without armed struggle (reformism is “antirevolutionary,” and “aims merely to make capitalism tolerable”). One statement features an extended tribute to Yahya Sinwar, the Hamas leader whose “crowning achievement” was the October 7 massacre. That tribute at least sounds like it was written by a human being. Most of the statements are written in a robotic, affected revolutionary jargon: Allies are addressed as “comrades” and Mao and PFLP manifestos are quoted as authorities. They read like the work of a large language model trained for its sins on millions of words uttered by Maoist-Leninists between the years 1965 and 1980.\n\nAdam Serwer: Mahmoud Khalil’s detention is a trial run\n\nIt is possible to be outraged at Israel and simultaneously denounce the wanton killing of Israeli civilians. The protesters have chosen a very different path. On October 9, 2023, before the war in Gaza began, Columbia Students for Justice in Palestine proclaimed its “full solidarity with Palestinian resistance” and the “counter-offensive” that was the slaughter of more than 1,000 Israelis two days earlier. That group was enveloped into CUAD, whose posted ramblings refer to hostages held by Hamas as “prisoners of war.” It has expanded its writ and pledged last year not to rest until it achieved “the total eradication of Western civilization.”\n\nThe correct response from Western civilization is to say Bring it on. The view that the West needs dismantling remains, to say the least, unpopular in the West. And the progressively more obnoxious tactics adopted at Columbia reflect frustration at the lack of takers for the activists’ more extreme demands, both at the university and in American politics. The Gaza war has not stopped. Adding the demand that Western civilization burn to ashes is a similarly desperate move, and incidentally antithetical to the approach of the granddaddy of all Columbia Palestinian activists, the late Edward Said—who abhorred philistinism and saw wanton violence against Israelis for the abomination and political dead end that it is.\n\nFor all I know, Khalil thinks the declaration of war against Western civilization is a foolish form of mission creep. But he seems to have been content to speak for a movement that views civilization as its enemy and Hamas as its friend. The folly of deporting him is most apparent when considering the irony of this position. Khalil did not come to the United States to dismantle it. He came to study at Columbia because its international-relations program is one of the best in the world, and if he wanted to study anywhere other than the United States, he’d have had to settle for a much worse program. Hatred of the West is, like hatred of McDonald’s, an elite preoccupation and often a hypocritical one. To hate America and its politics, and yet seek a U.S. green card, is the equivalent of advocating for quinoa bowls but sneaking a Big Mac. Remember the old Woody Allen joke, where one diner at a Catskills resort kvetches about how bad the food is, and the other agrees and adds that the portions are too small.\n\nKhalil has spent much of his time in America complaining that its policies are heinous. Now he is objecting to being forced to leave that same allegedly genocidal country. The Ernest Tubb song “It’s America: Love It or Leave It” encapsulates the Trump administration’s view of this hypocrisy. But America should take the compliment. Certain levels of American patriotism are inaccessible to native-born Americans, who are American by accident of birth and therefore have not, like Khalil, gone to great effort to Americanize themselves. He now looks poised to fight for his right, again enjoyed by native-born Americans only by chance, to remain in America indefinitely. Would he also have contested his deportation from Nazi Germany? Perhaps instead of deporting him, the Trump administration should offer Khalil citizenship.\n\nGraeme Wood: A Gaza protester who’s willing to suffer\n\nLast year, I profiled a Princeton student, David Chmielewski, who undertook a hunger strike in support of Gazans. In doing so he committed no crime, and he used a tactic that, although not totally alien to the Palestinian cause, has been rejected along with all other forms of nonviolence by Hamas. “There’s something very powerful about being able to use your body to show that commitment,” he told me. His hunger strike was small, but it reflected real devotion, expressed in a morally faultless manner. Now Khalil’s body is at stake, and he has a chance to do the same. Columbia University Apartheid Divest has called getting suspended for Gaza “the highest honor.” Surely getting deported for Gaza would be an even higher one, the summa cum laude of activism.\n\nThe decision to detain Khalil was not his. What happens next, however, is at least partly up to him. So far it appears that he will contest his detention and deportation—and as someone who finds the singling out of immigrants for their politics a loathsome development, I hope that he does, and that he prevails. But if he emerges from immigration detention a free man on American soil, I hope his next step will be to show his commitment to his cause, by shredding his green card and booking one-way passage to a country whose policies he finds more agreeable.",

Sign up for it here.\n\nWhen my older sister, Ellen, was 4 or 5, she and a neighbor girl were playing in the front yard of our Berkeley house. The friend, who lived across the street, was the daughter of a Lutheran minister, who our father thought was a pompous and ridiculous person. Suddenly, Ellen slammed through the kitchen door and pounded upstairs to our father’s study.\n\n“Daddy, Daddy!” she cried out in anguish. “Margaret Mumm says there’s no Santa Claus!”\n\nOur father stopped typing, considered briefly what she’d told him, and then said, “You tell Margaret Mumm there’s no God.”\n\nExplore the January 2025 Issue Check out more from this issue and find your next story to read.

So, not long after Ellen ran off, as my father looked through the window above his desk, he saw the man approach like an advancing filmstrip: first the shiny black shoes, then the black pant legs, and soon enough the whole of him, making his way to the bottom step and crossing the street.\n\nIn America in the ’60s, members of the clergy were generally considered moral authorities and accorded a certain measure of respect. But this particular clergyman was placing a very bad bet if he thought he could pay a visit to Tom Flanagan and tell him the right way to talk to his children about God.\n\nAfter the inevitable knock at the door, my father descended the stairs, and then there it was: American Mainline Protestantism face-to-face with post-Hiroshima rational thought. The minister must have assumed that Tom would at the very least invite him in, but he didn’t, so the man was forced to stand on the front porch and reduce his plaint to its elements.\n\n“Your daughter told my daughter that there is no God,” he said, more in sorrow than in anger. I think it was meant to be a pastoral visit.\n\n“And your daughter told my daughter that there is no Santa Claus,” my father replied.\n\n“But—there is no Santa Claus!” the minister sputtered.\n\n“And there is no God.”\n\nWe didn’t have any notion of God in our house, but we certainly had Christmas, and with it revealed truth: the carrots on the front porch, eaten down to stumps! The presents piled under the tree, with our names on them! Our cosmology was just as considered as his.\n\nUntil all of this certainty was challenged.\n\nTen years later, Ellen and I were called down to the living room of a rented house in Dublin, where we were spending one of our father’s endless sabbatical years (I went to first, fifth, and tenth grade in Ireland), and tersely informed that we were going to be baptized.\n\nWe shrieked in horror. If our parents had told us they were getting divorced, we would have taken the news with equanimity. We would have said, “Hey, you gave it your best shot,” and recommended that they wait until we got back to California, where theocracy would not impede their plans. But religion? There was no explanation for it; they certainly didn’t say they’d had their own conversions.\n\nEllen spoke for us both: “I’m not doing it!”\n\nI echoed her: “No way!”\n\nOur parents were up to something, and clearly our mother, Jean, was the instigator. Tom would much later confess that the whole thing was a hypocritical plan that my mother had hatched to get us into Catholic schools (which were like private schools, but cheap) when we returned to Berkeley.\n\nJean was unmoved by our yelps of disgust and fear. We were to be whipped through the tenets of the faith via weekly lessons delivered at a convent school by two nuns (one for Ellen, and one for me), and the event would occur early one evening in December, in time for a drinks party afterward. The guests would be 25 of my parents’ friends. Would we like to invite any of our own friends? We would rather be buried alive.\n\nThe first lesson was the next day, and I began my session with tea in a cup and saucer—very civilized—and biscuits. But no sooner had I eaten the last Jaffa Cake on the plate than we turned to Mr. Toad’s Wild Ride: the virgin birth (“What’s a virgin?” “It’s a girl who hasn’t even met a boy”); the Crucifixion (holy shit!); original sin; confession; the Eucharist; priests’ ability to transform ordinary bread and wine into literal (this was very, very important to understand: not symbolic—literal) human blood and flesh, a tiny bit of which we would be consuming once a week for the rest of our lives.\n\nYou can’t jump people into Roman Catholicism after the age of reason; they have to “come to God” on their own, or be in some kind of trouble. We didn’t believe any of it, and not just because of what our parents had always told us. It didn’t sound plausible. We lay in our beds at night and fumed. At the baptism, Ellen and I would have to have water poured on our long hair, like a couple of idiots. We would have to say something about believing in God, and we would have to reject the devil and all his pomps. (Pomps : shows of magnificence, splendor. Enough said! Rejected!) We took our final lesson, and a rehearsal was staged. Someone made a fruitcake with marzipan icing. In Ireland, when a woman makes a fruitcake, there’s no turning back. We were fucked.\n\nBut then—like a dream, like a magic fish bone—word arrived from Belfast that Seamus and Marie Heaney were coming down for the event, and that Seamus would write a poem. That changed everything for me. Anything the Heaneys were cool with, I was cool with. They were my idea of what a dazzling couple ought to be, and they were always, always kind to us, and we needed kindness.\n\nWhen Seamus stood up and read the poem, “Baptism: for Ellen and Kate Flanagan,” I accepted everything—all of it, all at once: poetry, God, and myself.\n\nFor half a century, I’ve kept the piece of onionskin he typed that poem on, so thin that it’s almost translucent. It’s a blessing on the long, strange project of being Kate Flanagan. That winter night in Dublin, Seamus gave me the one thing I desperately needed growing up in that crazy family: my certificate of belonging, in this world and the next.\n\nPhoto-illustration by Sarah Palmer.

Seamus, Marie, and their two little boys, Michael and Christopher, had come to California so that Seamus could spend the academic year in the UC Berkeley English department. (Their daughter, Catherine Ann, was still circling in the future, choosing her moment.) My parents were almost 20 years older than the Heaneys, my father a professor in the department, and they took the family under their wing as they did for many visiting professors—Jean in her motherly way, and Tom with his incredible erudition and merciless, legendary wit.\n\n“Berkeley swings like a swing-boat, has all the colour of the fairground and as much incense burning as a high altar in the Vatican,” Seamus wrote to his editor, Rosemary Goad, shortly after arriving. That wonderful description spent 50 years in a folder, but now—on the tenth anniversary of his death—has been published in the collected Letters of Seamus Heaney, edited by the poet Christopher Reid. Of course I’ve read and loved Seamus’s poetry most of my life, but the way I actually knew him was in person, talking with people. Every joke, kind word, and cynical quip expressed in the letters—many of which mentioned or were addressed to my father—made me feel that he was in a room just beyond the one where I sat reading.\n\nRead: James Parker on the letters of Seamus Heaney\n\nOne Heaney is fun. All of the Heaneys together are the best time you’ll ever have. Marie is smart and beautiful and funny, and the boys, then 4 and 2, were incredible, with their Northern Irish accents, their serious first names (in America, they’d have been Mike—even Mikey—and Chris), and their fealty to each other. While Ellen was grinding it out in ninth grade—expectations were higher for her, owing to birth order and the obvious fact that she was giving education much more to work with—my mother was blessedly eccentric about my own school attendance. I would report mild health problems and head out with Jean and Marie and the boys on field trips to the pumpkin patches in Half Moon Bay, my mother fearlessly navigating our Plymouth Valiant up and down San Francisco blocks so steep that you would feel the front tires inching across the asphalt until suddenly the center of gravity shifted, physics took over, and for 30 seconds, your fate was anyone’s guess.\n\nThe family wasn’t in Berkeley long before Heaneymania broke out. Berkeley in those days was an archipelago of dinner parties, and my parents were no pikers. There were many mornings when I’d go downstairs to watch cartoons and find Seamus asleep on the couch—he would have driven Marie home to relieve the babysitter and come back so he and Tom could talk and talk, cracking each other up and also taking part in what Seamus would later call the beginning of an ongoing tutorial. If you wanted to discuss Irish history and literature, Tom Flanagan was your man.\n\nFrom the February 1988 issue: Seamus Heaney on Oscar Wilde\n\nImagine being liberated from Belfast in 1970—when the violence and terror of the Troubles ran in parallel with the most narrowly defined social conventions, policed every hour of the day and night by neighbors, teachers, priests, and ministers—for a year in Berkeley! The contrast was as stark as any between two Western cities could possibly be. This wasn’t London, where King’s Road offered velvet pants, joss sticks, and a friendly attitude toward sex between strangers as a thriving, but still circumscribed, performance. This was a citywide retreat from the known social order, with a California twist.\n\nEarly mornings, Seamus would sometimes drive the family across the bay to Sam’s, in Tiburon, for pancakes and champagne, getting home in time to teach his 9 a.m. class. Their first weekend in town, the family went to a Pete Seeger concert. At parties he met the great California poets—Lawrence Ferlinghetti, Gary Snyder. He and Leonard Michaels became friends. His one regret when they arrived was that he’d gotten his hair cut before leaving Ireland.\n\n“It’s lotus land for the moment,” he wrote to friends—a perfect Seamus sentence, suggesting both his ease with the sensual experience of California and his sly, characteristic caution: for the moment. All too soon, from my perspective, the year ended, and the Heaneys packed up their flat, said goodbye to champagne and pancakes, and headed home to Belfast. As Seamus would say, “Back to porridge and gunfire.”\n\nTom and Caitlin Flanagan in Dublin (Sarah Palmer; Source: Courtesy of Caitlin Flanagan)\n\nWe Flanagans wouldn’t be far behind the Heaneys, because my father’s sabbatical year was upon us. Once Ellen and I had re-enrolled at our Dublin school and settled back into our Irish life, we drove north to spend a week with the Heaneys in Belfast.\n\nOf course I knew about the Troubles, but I’d never seen a militarized border before. Tom warned us to be quiet while an officer took our passports and inspected the trunk of the Morris Mini for weapons. Our mother was at the wheel because Tom refused to learn to drive a car, while Ellen and I sat in the back seat, staring out anxiously from beneath a welter of books and the glinting gold wrappers of a dozen Cadbury Milks. A few soldiers (“They’re so young,” my mother said) watched us in a wary and—in the manner of all soldiers on shit deployments—contemptuous way. The mystified officer who waved us through seemed to figure that we were creatures of extreme naivete who would be dealt with, one way or another, once we were in Belfast.\n\nThe country roads were beautiful, but terrible things happened on them. For two decades, the most frightening sound in the north was the screech of brakes preceding a bomb being thrown through the doors of a dance hall or pub. The “proxy bomb” was created during the conflict, such a well-designed instrument of terror that it was later deployed as far away as Colombia and Syria. Gunmen stop a driver on a country road and force him to get into the driver’s seat of a waiting car that has been loaded with a bomb. He will drive that car into whatever target he’s told. The gunmen’s leverage is absolute: They have the man’s family at gunpoint back at the farm—perhaps they will remind him of what the children were wearing that morning.\n\nI remember that Seamus was haunted by an incident in which a van full of workers was stopped by masked men, who demanded that everyone get out and stand in a line. The Catholics were ordered to come forward. In fact, only one of the men was Catholic. The man next to him secretly took his hand and pressed it: Don’t do it; we’ll cover for you. But for whatever reason, habit or loyalty, he stepped forward—and all of the others were swiftly machine-gunned. The ambushers were Catholics.\n\nLeft: Seamus Heaney, the literary critic F. W. Dupee, and Tom in California in 1974. Right: Caitlin with Seamus in California in 1974. (Sarah Palmer; Source: Courtesy of Caitlin Flanagan)\n\nIn Berkeley, one of Seamus’s Black friends once asked him to explain what was happening in the north of Ireland, and when he’d finished a brief accounting, his friend said, “I don’t know the words, but I sure recognize the tune.” It was the old thing, the thing that people do to one another. And as the violence continued, the threads holding the tapestry together started to snap.\n\nBelfast frightened me, but once we got to 16 Ashley Avenue, nothing bad could happen. It was like a family reunion. Ellen and I watched The Magic Roundabout with the boys, and every night at dusk, Seamus and the other men on the street would unroll concertina wire at the ends of the block.\n\nOne evening, the adults were planning to go to a party while Ellen and I watched the boys—the babysitter had backed out. Ellen was extremely beautiful and getting more so by the month. My parents didn’t seem to care that their teenage daughter was stuck at home, fed a constant diet of Seán Ó Riada and the Irish rebellion of 1798, but Marie did. Other young people would be at this party, and Marie many times said it was a shame that Ellen couldn’t go too. I was determined to save the night, and I insisted that I would be the babysitter. Everyone thought it was a weird idea—no one more so than the little boys—but I’m an adamant person. Marie told me that I could call her at the smallest hint of trouble.\n\nEveryone left, the boys got into their pajamas, and we hit the Richard Scarry pretty hard. Soon they were asleep. I felt amazing and useful and like a teenager myself. But after about an hour, I started hearing noises—muffled booms, shouting. Perhaps they were the sounds of any normal city at night, but Belfast in 1972 wasn’t a normal city. I looked in on the little boys, and realized I had taken on more than I could handle. What in the world was I going to do if I had to get them out? In defeat, I called Marie, and she came home. All the rest of my life, I’ve regretted doing it. I could have been the hero; I could have been the Ellen!\n\nBecause what was happening in the north was so violent, because it was unfolding in an English-speaking country, because it could be read as an ethnic minority’s final fight against empire, and—perhaps most important—because it involved Ireland, a country from which millions of Americans claimed ancestry, the Troubles quickly became not just a European story but a global one. And because the six counties of the north were filled with children going to school, women shopping, farmers walking cows down tiny lanes to be milked, and young people’s dances and secret spaces, they produced a river of blood.\n\nWhat did people want from Seamus Heaney at that time? Everything. There was tremendous pressure for him to turn his poetry into a form of opinion writing and take moral command of the situation. He would never have done anything like that. He was a poet, not an on-call political-versification machine. More than that, he understood that what was happening didn’t fit into a neat rubric of oppression and colonial rule. This was a 14-year-old headed to band practice who was abducted, hooded, and murdered. This was an 11-year-old on her way to school when a bomb exploded in her father’s car. This wasn’t an academic debate about the Stormont government or the British army’s casual use of rubber bullets. This was hell.\n\nFrom the July/August 2020 issue: Seamus Heaney’s journey into darkness\n\nSeamus in the early ’70s had become very interested in the bodies that had been discovered in the bogs that stretch across Northern Europe. This type of bog has the perfect conditions to preserve bodies for thousands of years. The majority of those that have been found were Iron Age people, and despite their wide geographic distribution, they tend to have commonalities: A great number were naked, except for perhaps a ceremonial piece of clothing or jewelry; their stomachs were filled with a gruel of local grains; and many had been murdered. Some had been staked into the bog with wooden pegs, as though to protect them from theft or interference, or even to offer them as a sort of display.\n\nIn 1950, an archaeologist named P. V. Glob, who was employed by a museum in Aarhus, Denmark, oversaw the removal of a body from the village of Tollund—the astonishingly well-preserved corpse of a man killed more than 2,000 years earlier. Glob wrote a book about that find and several others, and he gave it a riveting title: not The Bog Bodies, but The Bog People. Who were they? What did they tell us of their beliefs and their cultures?\n\nSeamus knew bogs well; he’d cut turf on the family farm in County Derry. And he knew the things that had been pulled out of bogs: the skeletons of giant Irish elk, long extinct; clay jars still filled with butter. The Bog People inspired him. Soon after his return from Berkeley, he published “The Tollund Man,” a terrifying abduction of a poem that casually welcomes you on a short journey before grabbing hold of you and taking you right down to the underworld.\n\n“Some day I will go to Aarhus,” the poem begins, like an epic:\n\nTo see his peat-brown head,\n\nThe mild pods of his eye-lids,\n\nHis pointed skin cap.\n\nAlready the poem is turning, taking you to the place in the bog “where they dug him out,” wanting to see the “gruel of winter seeds / caked in his stomach.” We are in the territory of Robert Graves and the White Goddess:\n\nI could risk blasphemy,\n\nConsecrate the cauldron bog\n\nOur holy ground and pray\n\nHim to make germinate\n\n\n\nThe scattered, ambushed\n\nFlesh of labourers\n\nLaborers, brothers, children, old men—the ambushed dead; the missing; the disappeared.\n\nWe’re in the underworld now, chthonic and mad, as the townspeople point at the Tollund Man while he is raced in a cart to his murder. How was he chosen? How is anyone chosen?\n\nThe famous last stanza of the poem is the answer to the question people didn’t even know how to pose about the river of blood.\n\nOut there in Jutland\n\nIn the old man-killing parishes\n\nI will feel lost,\n\nUnhappy and at home.\n\nSeamus often compared his bond with Tom to the one between father and son. “I suppose you’re destined to be a father-figure of sorts to me,” he wrote to Tom in 1974. “Blooming awful.”\n\nSeamus had a father, of course, the farmer and cattle dealer Patrick Heaney. But Tom was his “literary foster father.” In the year that Seamus arrived in California, he later told an interviewer, his “head was still basically wired up to English Literature terminals.” It was Tom, he said, who gave him a “far more charged-up sense of Yeats and Joyce” and the “whole Irish consequence.”\n\nFrom the November 1997 issue: Seamus Heaney on W. B. Yeats, “All Ireland’s Bard”\n\nSeamus was a poet in a country known for them. My father often said that Seamus came early into a sense not merely of his talent, but also of the obligations that went along with it. But he didn’t necessarily want to be a poet of the madness unfolding in the north. Of the Tollund Man he later said: “Even if there had been no Northern Troubles, no mankilling in the parishes, I would still have felt at home with that ‘peat-brown head’—an utterly familiar countryman’s face.”\n\nEven as a global figure, Seamus never stopped being grateful to Tom for playing what he saw as an essential role in his development as an artist. In the collection of letters, I came across one he’d written to a friend soon after Seamus had accepted the Nobel Prize in Stockholm. He and Marie were in New York, where they’d driven the two hours to my parents’ house on Long Island—“a chance to see Tom and Jean Flanagan and sit with them in gratitude and sage memory, friendship and wonder at what can happen to a youth from the fields.”\n\nLeft: Seamus reading in New York. Right: Seamus, Tom, and Caitlin on Long Island in the early 1980s. (Sarah Palmer; Source: Courtesy of Caitlin Flanagan)\n\nAs the years went on, Seamus quietly took care of all kinds of needs that Tom had. One year we lived in Ireland in a rental house that had the basics, including a set of cheaply made but brand-new furniture. What it didn’t have was a bookcase. Tom was working on a novel, and his office looked like a graduate student’s squat until Seamus showed up with wood and nails and stain, and built my father a bookcase.\n\nNear the end of Tom’s life, when he was becoming frail, my parents bought another house in the Berkeley Hills, and Seamus came out to see it. My father was anxious to show him the impressive study, which ran the length of the house in a gabled attic. It was a magnificent space but had a very steep staircase, and the second Seamus saw it, he said my parents had to get a banister put in.\n\nMy mother (a former nurse and essentially the breathing apparatus of one Tom Flanagan) had of course been saying that since the day they moved in, and my father (pretty much the hair shirt of one Jean Flanagan) had ignored her. Each time she raised it anew he would say, “Banister, banister, awk, awk,” like she was a parrot in a cage. (I’m telling you, this was one of the world’s great marriages crammed with enough nuclear-level rage to split the world apart like two plates.) But when Seamus said “banister,” my father got the banister.\n\nI used to think that my father was my ace in the hole. He had the same handwriting as Santa Claus, who was, of course, God. He was at absolute ease in any group of great thinkers and writers, and because of him, I grew up around many remarkable people. Sometimes when we were talking, he would say, “That’s a good point,” or even “That’s a very good point.” He never said it to jolly me along; he said it when I’d made a good point. To this day, if you were to observe me thinking—while gardening or cooking or waiting in the TSA line—you might hear me mutter, “That’s a very good point,” and at first opportunity, I’ll go write it down.\n\nWhy would a girl with such a wonderful father ever need a second one? Because someone must have dropped Tom on his head as a baby. A streak of cruelty ran through him that could be channeled into incredibly destructive behavior, sometimes directed at himself, more often at the three people he loved most: my mother, my sister, and me.\n\nIf you had caught up with me 20 years ago, or even 10, I would have showered you with shocking tales. But something happens when you turn 60. You just let go. You finally realize there isn’t ever going to be a reward for thinking about something and talking about it. And you realize (terrible truth though it may be) that, as Philip Larkin—of all people!—reports, “what will survive of us is love.”\n\nOne of the many things I inherited after my father’s death was Seamus’s loyalty. My parents died within a year of each other. Hardly a tragedy: I was almost 40! But who has ever been closer to their difficult parents? My position in the family was that of a suitcase to the traveler. Half of the time it’s an unholy burden, but when you see it thundering back down the luggage chute, you could weep with relief. I was deeply loved, and I was never left behind.\n\nSix months after Tom died, I was suddenly diagnosed with aggressive and life-threatening breast cancer. I felt a strong need to keep the information contained to as small a group as possible. I thought it would hurt my career if people knew I was that sick, and also, in a primitive way, I thought that the fewer people who knew about it, the better the chance it wasn’t real. But somehow Seamus found out.\n\nSeamus didn’t believe in a force as mere as optimism. He believed in something far greater and more powerful: hope.\n\nSo many of Seamus’s letters in the collection begin in apology—over and over again, he makes amends for being so egregiously late in responding to someone. And yet, not 10 days after the diagnosis, a letter arrived from Seamus and Marie. They were aghast at the completely “arbitrary insult upon health and beauty.” Soon after, another letter: He’d heard I’d come through surgery, “as valiantly and gracefully as the great spirit you are and have been.” They would be in St. Lucia for 10 days—probably to visit their friend, the poet Derek Walcott—and he told me how to reach them if I needed them.\n\nEveryone who knew Seamus has a story like that. He had a sense of obligation to others that in anyone else would be incapacitating. Once, when my own children were small, I took them to visit Seamus and Marie. After tea and hugs, we climbed into the taxi, and the driver said, “So you’ve been to see the great man.” Almost around the corner was a billboard with his picture on it, promoting a new documentary. By his later years, there was no escaping himself, and the endless duties the role entailed. He may have fantasized about ditching those duties, but he never shirked them.\n\nThe letters helped; the poems too. After I first got sick, and in the years since, I have returned often to some of his most famous lines, from The Cure at Troy, which argues for faith in an unseen future. Seamus didn’t believe in a force as mere as optimism. He believed in something far greater and more powerful: hope.\n\nSo hope for a great sea-change\n\nOn the far side of revenge.\n\nBelieve that a further shore\n\n\n\nIs reachable from here.\n\nBelieve in miracles\n\nAnd cures and healing wells.\n\nIt was because of those lines that I started ignoring the oncologists who insisted that I would never be cured.\n\nWhen a public person dies as suddenly and shockingly as Seamus did—on an ordinary August morning in 2013, in a hospital corridor on his way to surgery—before the family has an hour to confront the unthinkable, the news flies out the window and circles the world. It was an international story, of course, but in Ireland, the grief was personal, intense, self-reflective.\n\nWhatever it means to be Irish—whatever qualities of heart and mind, whatever generosity and love for the very earth and rocks of that island—millions of Irish people were convinced that Seamus Heaney embodied it. All over Ireland, the grief was not just for a storied Irishman and a great poet. The grief was for a friend.\n\nRead: Seamus Heaney’s plainspoken power\n\nTwo days after he died was the All-Ireland football semifinal. Dublin versus Kerry, no kidding around, and 80,000 people packed into Croke Park. Before the match, a photo of Seamus appeared on two giant screens, and almost unthinkingly, as though rising for “The Soldier’s Song,” everyone in that stadium stood up. The announcer said: “We’d like to mark the passing of one of our greatest literary icons, the Nobel laureate Seamus Heaney.” And with that, the entire crowd began clapping. The announcer said that in addition to his great works and awards, Seamus had played underage football for Castledawson in Derry. The weight given to that last fact was the same as to the first ones. It meant: He was one of us. Among the sacks of letters to The Irish Times was one written by a man called Frank Munnelly: “As a nation we are a man down.”\n\nThe funeral was in Dublin, and the burial was in Bellaghy, and the roads were lined with people. Seamus had read his poetry around the world, and been welcomed everywhere, but he never had any doubt about where the journey would end: in the graveyard of his parish church. “We are welcoming Seamus home,” said the parish priest, while 2,000 mourners strained to hear him. The family was there, of course: those children of the father who had never once failed them and had only and always loved them, and, in the center of everything, always—Marie. Michael (now Mick) spoke briefly, informing the world of Seamus’s last words—a text to Marie that read, “Noli timere”: Don’t be afraid.\n\nMy parents don’t have graves. We were a very anti-death family. They had both suffered devastating losses when they were children, and so they tried to keep the very notion of death a secret from us for as long as possible. When Ellen texted me, “Have you heard about Seamus?,” I knew it could mean only one thing. But for a minute or so I stopped myself from Googling his name. I was giving reality a chance to sort itself out. My rational self reported that if he was dead, then there would someday be a grave and a gravestone, and I instantly decided that if that was true, I would never go see them. It would be an acceptance of a fact I was fighting against.\n\nRead: How so many people got Seamus Heaney’s last words wrong\n\nBut a few months ago, a full decade after he died, I went at last to Bellaghy. My husband took me—“Stalwart Rob,” as my father described him in his last letter to Seamus—and we sailed over the “invisible border,” as it’s now called. There’s no more signage than there is crossing a state line in America—in fact, none at all.\n\nThe sky was darkening because we were late; we’d been having lunch with Marie and Mick in Dublin and hadn’t wanted to leave. We arrived at St. Mary’s church under a spitting rain that would suddenly let up, in bursts of revelation and transfiguration, as Irish rains do. Halfway down the graveyard, dark marble austere against the hard gray of the church wall, the headstone seemed almost to hover a few inches off the earth because of the famous line carved into it: “Walk on air against your better judgement.”\n\nIt’s from a poem, “The Gravel Walks,” and it gives you the ability, the permission, to hold the full, complicated equation of life lightly. I repeat it often. I’ve been sick for many years now, and whenever I get a call that explains some bad finding, I listen stoically and then remind myself that I’ll walk on air despite the news.\n\nThe words are for the world—ours and that of future generations—but most of all, I imagine them as a private communication to Marie. The point of the entire operation was always Marie, the quarry turned way of life.\n\nI’d bought three pots of violets at SPAR market, in the village, and I put the flowers next to the gravestone, feeling a bit sheepish, as though I was performing something I’d learned from the movies, or television, though Seamus—and Tom, come to think of it—would have approved of SPAR market. It was the right way to go about it.\n\nI was inclined to stay there forever; why else had I come? But it was getting cold, and Rob gently kicked at some of the gravel in the path between graves.\n\n“The kingdom of gravel was inside you,” the poem says. “Hoard and praise the verity of gravel. / Gems for the undeluded. Milt of earth.” And yet that’s the poem that ends in air, with the gentle counsel to establish yourself “somewhere in between” the earth and heaven, the gravel and a song.\n\nThen, just past where Rob was standing, I saw a much older headstone, weathered, but its letters clearly read HEANEY. And, in smaller print, beneath:\n\nErected by Patrick Heaney\n\nIn Memory of his son Christopher\n\nDied 25th Feb. 1953 Aged three years.\n\nIt jolted me in a way Seamus’s grave hadn’t. Christopher was Seamus’s little brother, who ran into the road and was struck by a car and killed. “Mid-Term Break”—one of the first poems people read when they discover Seamus’s work—is about Seamus receiving the news at 14, when he was away at boarding school, and then coming home.\n\nIn the porch I met my father crying—\n\nHe had always taken funerals in his stride—\n\nSeamus hated crying—“blubbering”—and I always wondered if this terrible scene was a reason for that.\n\nThe baby cooed and laughed and rocked the pram\n\nWhen I came in, and I was embarrassed\n\nBy old men standing up to shake my hand\n\nA child dead, and a sudden manhood foisted upon Seamus. His early poems are so familiar to me that the events they record can seem like the ones in fiction, the responses of the speaker those of a fictional character. But there was Christopher’s grave, just as real as his brother’s, just as much a marker of a human life.\n\nI’ve been a Catholic since my baptism, but the only Catholic tradition I remember my father handing down to me was lighting a candle “for the dead of the family.” Catholicism provides you with something no rational approach to the world ever will: a cosmology of intercessors, saints. It’s a religion that acknowledges, openly and from the very beginning, that faith itself is a mystery. Walking out of that graveyard left me with a bleakness, but I didn’t have time to confront it, because I was already entering the church so that I could light a candle for the dead of my family.\n\nWe can’t escape it: losing the people we love and need the most. Each death has to be countenanced as a fact, squared away in the record books. But there are people so well known to us, so loved, that death is one more thing that can be turned to air.\n\nSeamus Heaney photographed at the Royal Society of Literature in London, March 16, 1995 (Steve Pyke / Getty)\n\nWhen Tom died, Seamus wrote an obituary for him in The New York Review of Books : “Since our first meeting in 1970, he was like a father to me and like a typical Irish son I felt closest at our times of greatest silence and remoteness.” He described a few of their endless car trips and excursions; only Tom and Seamus would scramble down a cliff path in Antrim to see the site where Roger Casement had wanted to be buried. Let no stone be unturned, no vigil unattended. And then Seamus quoted the poem he’d written at the time of his own father’s death:\n\nAnd there was nothing between us there\n\nThat might not still be happily ever after.\n\nThis article appears in the January 2025 print edition with the headline “Walk on Air Against Your Better Judgment.”",

        "content": "The skid steer’s hydraulic breaker rose up toward the sky, then plunged into the street below, rupturing the concrete and the yellow paint overlaying it. The jackhammer’s staccato thundered over the din of passing traffic. It was a Tuesday morning in March, and people walking by covered their ears. Others took out their phones to capture the destruction. The bright-yellow paint, now fragmented into a growing pile of concrete, had spelled out the words Black Lives Matter over two blocks on 16th Street Northwest, about a quarter mile from the White House.\n\nThe city-sanctioned mural had been created in 2020, after the Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin killed George Floyd by kneeling on his neck for more than nine minutes. Floyd’s death catalyzed racial-justice protests nationwide, including in Washington. On June 1, federal authorities used smoke grenades and tear gas to remove protesters from Lafayette Park; President Donald Trump then marched across the park so that he could pose with a Bible in front of a nearby church. Four days later, the area was renamed Black Lives Matter Plaza and the mural was painted.\n\nMany believed that it would become a permanent fixture in the district, and originally, D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser said that it would be, so it could serve as a “gathering place for reflection, planning and action, as we work toward a more perfect union.” But a few weeks ago, Republican Representative Andrew Clyde of Georgia introduced legislation that would withhold millions of dollars in federal funding from the city if it did not remove the mural and change the name of the area to “Liberty Plaza.” D.C. was already facing funding uncertainty and has been shaken by layoffs of federal workers in the thousands. Mayor Bowser decided that fighting to preserve the mural was not a battle worth having.\n\nFrom the January/February 2024 issue: Civil rights undone\n\n“The mural inspired millions of people and helped our city through a very painful period, but now we can’t afford to be distracted by meaningless congressional interference,” Bowser wrote in a post on X.\n\nI made my way to Black Lives Matter Plaza on Tuesday, the day after construction crews began removing the mural. I have spent the past several years writing about our collective relationships to monuments and memorials that tell the story of American history. I have watched statues being erected, and I have watched others taken down. In both the United States and abroad, I have wrestled with whether monuments are meant to perform a shallow contrition or honestly account for historical traumas. Part of what I have come to understand is that such iconography can rarely be disentangled from its social and political ecosystem. Symbols are not just symbols. They reflect the stories that people tell. Those stories shape the narratives people carry about where they come from and where they’re going. And those narratives shape public policy that materially affects people’s lives.\n\nThe removal of the mural is not the same as a change in policy, but it is happening in tandem with many policy changes, and is a reflection of the same shift in priorities. It is part of a movement that is removing Black people from positions of power by dismissing them as diversity hires, rescinding orders that ensure equal opportunity in government contracts, stripping federal funding from schools that teach full and honest Black history, and suing companies that attempt to diversify their workforce. This goes far beyond an attack on DEI; my colleague Adam Serwer calls it the Great Resegregation:\n\nWhat its advocates want is not a restoration of explicit Jim Crow segregation—that would shatter the illusion that their own achievements are based in a color-blind meritocracy. They want an arrangement that perpetuates racial inequality indefinitely while retaining some plausible deniability, a rigged system that maintains a mirage of equal opportunity while maintaining an unofficial racial hierarchy.\n\nNear the construction site, I walked up to one of the workers holding a stop sign near an intersection. Antonio (he asked me to use only his first name because he wasn’t authorized to speak with reporters) wore a highlighter-yellow vest, his dreadlocks falling down his back from beneath his white hard hat. He told me he lives in Southeast D.C. and remembered feeling a sense of pride when the mural was painted. When he found out that he would be part of the team removing it, he asked not to be behind the wheel of any of the machines. “I just told them I don’t want a part in touching it,” he said, shaking his head. He looked over at the jackhammer pummeling the concrete on the other side of the street. “It was a memorial for the culture, and now I feel like something is being stripped from the culture.”\n\nOn the other side of the street was a woman in colorful sneakers and a green beanie. Nadine Seiler stood alone holding up a large cloth sign above her head that read Black Lives Matter Trump Can’t Erase Us.\n\n“The reason that this is happening is that people want to ‘make America great again,’” she told me. “But the same people who want to ‘make America great again’ don’t want white children to know how America became great in the first place”—by “exploiting people who are not white.”\n\n“They’re trying to erase everything,” she said.\n\nSeiler doesn’t blame Mayor Bowser for removing the statue: “She has been put in a difficult position, because ultimately she’s going to lose anyway.” She blames President Trump, the Republican Party, and the American people themselves who are standing by and allowing democracy to erode all around them.\n\nWhile I was there, Seiler was the only person I saw rallying against the removal of the mural. She came to the United States from Trinidad 37 years ago, and has become something of a full-time protester. She has history with the Black Lives Matter Plaza: She was among the activists in 2020 who hung hundreds of signs affirming Black lives and inveighing against Trump along the fence that surrounds the White House. On multiple occasions, people came and tore the signs down, so for three weeks Seiler “lived on Black Lives Matter Plaza” to protect them. She told me she’s since become the custodian of those signs, and holds many in storage.\n\nI told Seiler I was surprised that more people weren’t there protesting. She said that she wasn’t surprised, but she was disheartened. It was reflective, she said, of the tepid resistance Americans have put up to the new administration more broadly. She’s attended protests over the past several weeks focused on some of Trump’s earliest executive actions: the dismantling of USAID and withdrawal from the Paris Climate Accords and World Health Organization; the indiscriminate firing of thousands of federal workers; the blanket access the president has given Elon Musk and his DOGE team to sensitive and classified information; the assault on the rights of trans people; the effort to end birthright citizenship; the pardoning of Capitol insurrectionists; and more. At those protests, she told me, she’d seen maybe 100 or 200 people. This is wholly inadequate given the gravity of what is happening, she said: “There should be thousands of people in the streets. There should be millions of people in the streets.”\n\nThomas Chatterton Williams: How the woke right replaced the woke left\n\nSomeone drove by, slowed down, and took a picture of Seiler’s sign before driving off. “We’re not rising up,” she continued. In many other countries, she said, there has been more robust resistance to the rise of authoritarianism. “We’re just sitting here and taking it without barely any pushback.” She added, “It’s very disappointing to me, because I’m an import, and I was sold on American democracy, and American exceptionalism, and American checks and balances”—she lowered her sign and folded it up under her arm—“and we are seeing that all of this is nothing. It’s all a farce.”\n\nSeiler, despite having gotten citizenship two decades ago, doesn’t think that it will protect her if the Trump administration starts going after dissenters. The arrest of Mahmoud Khalil, a green-card holder who led protests against Israel at Columbia University and is now in immigration detention, has only reinforced a sense that her days are numbered. “I feel eventually they’ll find a way to come at me,” she said, tears beginning to form in her eyes.\n\nBehind us, the pulverizing of concrete continued. Clouds of dust rose up and surrounded the machines that were cracking the street open. It will take several weeks of work for the mural to be completely destroyed and paved over again. I looked down at the fragments of letters in front of me. The first word they chose to remove was Matter.",

That doctor, A. Norman Guthkelch, was part of a wave of physicians and researchers newly concerned that an epidemic of severe child abuse had been passing, undetected, beneath doctors’ noses.\n\nAs one law-review article recounts, “Prior to the 1960s, medical schools provided little or no training on child abuse, and medical texts were largely silent on the issue.” A turning point was the publication of the 1962 article “The Battered-Child Syndrome,” which urged physicians to consider that severe child abuse may be at play when children came in with injuries such as bone fractures, subdural hematomas, and bruising.\n\nThe article goes beyond offering medical advice to prescribing an ethical framework that would take hold: “The bias should be in favor of the child’s safety; everything should be done to prevent repeated trauma, and the physician should not be satisfied to return the child to an environment where even a moderate risk of repetition exists.”\n\nArmed with these new insights, Guthkelch hypothesized that the children showing up to his hospital were being abusively shaken. Although they did not show up with the usual fractures or visible forms of physical trauma, the presence of a subdural hematoma could indicate what would come to be widely known as “shaken baby syndrome.”\n\nDecades later, Guthkelch would publicly worry that his hypothesis had been taken too far. After reviewing the trial record and medical reports from one case in Arizona, NPR reported that he was “troubled” that the conclusion was abusive shaking when there were other potential causes. “I wouldn’t hang a cat on the evidence of shaking, as presented,” Guthkelch quipped.\n\nThe narrow claim that shaking a baby abusively can result in certain internal injuries morphed into the claim that if a set of internal injuries were present, then shaking must be the cause. On today’s episode of Good on Paper, I talk with a neuroscientist who found himself personally embroiled in this scientific and legal controversy when a caretaker was accused of shaking his child.\n\nCyrille Rossant is a researcher and software engineer at the International Brain Laboratory and University College London whose Ph.D. in neuroscience came in handy when he delved into the research behind shaken baby syndrome and published a textbook with Cambridge University Press on the scientific controversy that embroiled his family.\n\nThe following is a transcript of the episode:\n\nJerusalem Demsas: Many forms of scientific expertise in criminal-justice proceedings have been debunked or come under scrutiny in recent years. Things like bite-mark analysis and blood-spatter analysis used to be commonly understood as rigorous empirical analysis. But these questionable theories often fall apart on closer inspection.\n\nThis is how science is supposed to work. Experts observe, they hypothesize, they test, and they revise their previous understandings of the world. And in academia and in scientific journals, that’s all well and good—but what happens when evolving science is brought into the courtroom? In a courtroom, no one is well positioned to rigorously evaluate a scientific debate: not judges, not jurors, and not even the people calling expert witnesses.\n\n[Music]\n\nDemsas: My name’s Jerusalem Demsas. I’m a staff writer at The Atlantic, and this is Good on Paper. Today’s episode is about abusive head trauma, but you probably know it by its older name: shaken baby syndrome.\n\nBabies cannot speak for themselves. As a result, when doctors or prosecutors accuse a parent or caregiver of having violently and abusively shaken their baby, they are often relying on something that has come to be known as “the triad.”\n\nThe triad refers to three medical findings: subdural hemorrhage, or bleeding in the area between the brain and the skull; retinal hemorrhage, or bleeding in the retina; and brain swelling. If these findings are present, according to shaken-baby-syndrome adherents, that would mean a baby has been abusively shaken. Shaken baby syndrome also indicates that since these symptoms arise rather quickly, the child must have been shaken by the last person he or she was with.\n\nIt’s important to understand that for many years, the presence of all three of these medical events was not indicative of child abuse; it was dispositive. In 2015, Kentucky’s former chief medical examiner, who had personally diagnosed SBS, told The Washington Post that “doctors, myself included, have accepted as true an unproven theory about a potential cause of brain injury in children.”\n\nMy guest today is Cyrille Rossant. He’s a researcher with a Ph.D. in neuroscience who plunged into the world of SBS when a caregiver was accused of shaking his child, an allegation she denied.\n\nThis is a very serious topic, and I want to be clear—child abuse is very real, and our public and private tools for addressing and helping children at risk are distressingly insufficient. But in their zeal to help children, many doctors, prosecutors, and scientists have allowed what one New Jersey appellate court has called “junk science” to tear apart the lives of thousands.\n\nLet’s dive in. Cyrille, welcome to the show.\n\nCyrille Rossant: Thank you for having me.\n\nDemsas: So you have a very personal connection to this issue. Can you tell us about how you first learned about shaken baby syndrome?\n\nRossant: Yeah, sure. So I actually lived a situation myself. So nine years ago, I had a baby who was being cared for by a caregiver. And when my baby was, like, five months old, he was sick. He was vomiting, and his head was getting bigger and bigger. So we brought him to the hospital, and they did a CT scan. And they found so-called subdural hematoma, which is blood around the brain.\n\nAnd from that, they told me that it was shaken baby syndrome. It could be nothing else. So that meant that my baby had been violently shaken. So obviously, it was a very difficult thing to hear, and I was really distressed by the health of my baby. So he was taken care of. He had surgery, and fortunately he was fine after that.\n\nSo now he’s a healthy 9-year-old boy. But at the time, it was very hard. And obviously, since it was a situation of suspicion of child abuse, the hospital had to report the case to authorities and to call the police. And that’s how it all started.\n\nDemsas: When that determination was made about your son, they didn’t leave you any doubt. When they saw the subdural hematoma, they said, Without a doubt, this is shaken baby syndrome?\n\nRossant: Yeah, exactly. So at the time at the hospital, most doctors were really sure that it was shaken baby syndrome, that it could be nothing else. So the thing is that we had a nanny. And my son had symptoms when he was being cared for by the nanny. So she was, like, the prime suspect. But still, it was very hard for us to believe that it was possible at the time.\n\nThat being said, there was one doctor who was less certain about the diagnosis. It was actually the only doctor who was a specialist of child neurology. And he was telling us that it could be shaken baby syndrome, but it could also be something else, namely a medical condition where there’s an excess of fluid around the brain. He told us it could be a risk factor for subdural hematoma and that he was not really sure that my son had been violently shaken.\n\nSo it was a bit confusing for me, to have, like, most doctors who are really 100 percent sure that it was shaken baby syndrome and another one who is supposed to know more about these issues to be less certain. So I was really confused, and I couldn’t really live with this uncertainty, and I needed to know what had happened to my baby.\n\nDemsas: And what happened with the caregiver? Did they arrest her?\n\nRossant: So yeah, basically, it took them maybe six months or something. But yeah, after six months, she was put in custody because, in the meantime, there was a medical expert who looked at the case and said, Well, yes. It’s a shaken baby. So it happened when my baby was being cared for by the caregiver, so it had to be her. So she was put under custody. She was interrogated by the police. And then she was being prosecuted for four years.\n\nDemsas: Oh my God.\n\nRossant: And in this longer legal process, another expert looked at the case, and he did not really agree with the first one.\n\nHe said, like the child-neurology specialist at the hospital, that it could be a medical condition and that maybe it was not shaken baby syndrome. So there were two different opinions in terms of medical experts. And on this uncertainty, the judge decided to drop all charges, and the nanny was cleared after four years.\n\nDemsas: This, I think, really underscores how serious of an issue this is. I mean, when a doctor or a scientific expert tells a court or a public-policy official or a policy maker that they’re certain about what something means, it sounds like they’re talking about a natural law or they’re talking about physics. And there’s often not the ability for public-policy makers or lawyers or judges to independently evaluate the research.\n\nSo as a result of your experience, you dove headfirst into the research here and have even written a book about the finding of SBS. I’m gonna just refer to it as shaken baby syndrome, even though there’s some controversy about whether it should be called that or abusive head trauma, just because I think most people know the term shaken baby syndrome, but I want to note for listeners that there’s some controversy over the use of that term.\n\nBut there are basically three areas of controversy I want us to explore: the mechanism of injury, the diagnostic reliability, and the evidence quality. Let’s start with the mechanism of injury. The fundamental question here is whether shaking your baby is the only way to cause the classic findings of SBS. Can you lay out the scientific debate here over that question?\n\nRossant: Yeah, so actually, I think you can say there are two different questions here. First is: Can shaking cause the injuries that are typically associated with SBS? And second: Are these medical findings always caused by shaking? So it’s kind of two inverse relationships—the causal link, and is it the only cause? If it’s a cause, is it the only one, right?\n\nDemsas: Yeah. The way I’ve been thinking about it is: Can punching a wall create a hole? Versus: If we find a hole in the wall, does that prove that someone punched it?\n\nRossant: Yeah, exactly.\n\nDemsas: I think we can start with, like, can punching a wall create a hole? Can shaking a baby lead to the injuries of the classic findings of SBS?\n\nRossant: So the short answer for this is: We don’t know. We cannot shake babies for science, right? It’s not working like that. So we don’t know today. I really looked a lot for that question in the literature, and I could not find good, reliable scientific evidence linking shaking without impact—and that’s important—to the medical findings associated with SBS: so typically, subdural hemorrhage, retinal hemorrhage, and brain swelling.\n\nWhat’s for sure is that babies are shaken. It exists. There’s no doubt about it. We know that many babies who are shaken—they are shaken not in the most violent possible way. There’s a whole spectrum in the degree of violence you can inflict to a baby. And when it’s not so much violence, it’s still child abuse, obviously, but it might not be enough for the baby to be injured. Okay?\n\nSo we have some interesting data from a lot of countries who asked a lot of parents and caregivers, Well, do you shake your baby? Do you hit your baby? Do you slap your baby? A lot of types of child abuse. And so it’s really just, like, self-admitted abuse, right? And parents actually say yes. And a proportion of them admit doing these kinds of things to their babies, including shaking.\n\nSo it’s something that exists. And still, we can think that 2 percent is not that much, but it’s still, like, 100 times more than the number of shaken baby syndrome diagnoses. So it means that we miss most babies who are really shaken, but maybe they are not shaken that violently, because they don’t appear to be injured. They don’t go to the hospital, and they are not detected. That being said, sometimes the babies are shaken so violently that they are being injured, and it’s hard to imagine how a baby could be shaken in the most violent possible way without the brain being injured.\n\nNow, the exact type of injury you are going to find around the brain, etcetera, we don’t really know. We don’t know. We can imagine that it’s going to harm the brain, but we don’t know how, exactly. There is some data that was obtained on animals. So there’s a whole literature on animal studies, like mice, rats, piglets, lambs, who are shaken for science—it’s horrific when you think about it, but these are things that are done by researchers. So animals are shaken, and they are injured. And we find some injuries in the brain, but they do not really look like what you find in shaken baby syndrome. It’s not exactly the same kind of findings. It doesn’t really match.\n\nDemsas: What’s the difference?\n\nRossant: It’s really technical, but you will find some injuries in the brain itself, like traumatic lesions to the neurons and to the cables between the neurons. You might find some bleeding, but again, it’s not the type of bleeding you find in shaken baby syndrome, which is really specific.\n\nSame for the retinal hemorrhage—you will find very severe retinal hemorrhaging in shaken baby syndrome. And this is not typically what you find in animals who are shaken. It doesn’t really match. So the way researchers are interpreting this typically is to say, Well, these animals are not good animal models for human babies, and human babies seem to have specificities for the kind of injuries we find. So far, we are not able to prove the causal link between violent shaking and the classic medical findings of shaken baby syndrome.\n\nDemsas: So models have failed to show that shaking can generate enough force to cause those injuries, and studies that are on animals haven’t been able to reproduce the classic findings through shaking alone. But there’s still a lot of uncertainty, right? So it’s still possible that shaking your baby could result in the classic presentation of shaken baby syndrome. But it’s also possible that it might be something else.\n\nSo we’ve talked about, can punching a wall create a hole? Now I want to ask you about, if you find a hole in the wall, does that prove someone punched it? Because I think one of the core parts of this controversy is that it’s not just that when a baby presents with these injuries that doctors will say, It’s possible this baby was abused. There’s been a training of doctors to indicate certainty, that if you find this—it’s often called “the triad”—if you find this triad of injuries, then you should presume that the baby was shaken and that the baby was shaken abusively by the last person who was with the child when it began presenting with those symptoms. So why was that the medical consensus? Why did that training happen?\n\nRossant: Yeah. I think you’re right to say that it’s not just a cause; it’s the only cause. That’s the theory, right? Shaking is a possible explanation for the findings. It’s the only possible explanation, and it occurred just before the baby showed symptoms. So it’s a really, really strong theory that has been taught to doctors. Now, why has that been the case? I don’t know.\n\nWhat I know is that historically, and you really need to dig down into the history of shaken baby syndrome to understand how it was born—it was born in the ’70s with this hypothesis that maybe shaking was one of the possible causes of subdural hematoma, but at the time it was just a hypothesis. And today it’s still a hypothesis. And that was in the beginning of the ’70s. And a few years later, doctors in the U.S. started to presume abuse whenever they found subdural and retinal hemorrhage in infants. Why that has been the case, why this mere hypothesis, Maybe it’s shaking, was transformed into, It is shaking, and we need to call the police, that I don’t know. But by the ’80s, you start to see prosecutions based on this theory.\n\nSo somehow—I don’t know—some doctors in the U.S. started to do this. It’s important, also, to say that there was the context of reporting any suspicion of child abuse to authorities. That started in the ’60s. There was a big subject here in pediatrics at the time, because before the ’60s, it was not really obvious for doctors to think about abuse. They didn’t really think about it. And it suddenly changed in the ’60s. And they really realized that it was important for the medical community, and especially pediatricians, who see children all the time, to think about abuse whenever they find suspicious findings, like fractures, bruises, and subdural hematoma. That came in the ’70s.\n\nSo there was this big push for doctors to really report as many children as possible to the authorities whenever they have the slightest doubt on abuse. And since there was this hypothesis that maybe subdural hematoma is one of the signs that should make doctors suspicious of abuse, well, they started to call the police and to report these cases to authorities.\n\nThat being said, I think there’s a difference between being just aware that maybe children are abused and calling the police, and going to court and saying, This is abuse, and this is nothing else, and this is certain. This is a big difference to me. And this is really what I don’t understand, because, to me, doctors should treat patients and report possible child-abuse cases to authorities. But going beyond that and saying to the courts, I’m a doctor, and I know that this child was abused, even though there’s no other piece of evidence apart from the medical findings, this is the thing that is going too far for me.\n\nDemsas: What other things can happen that can cause these symptoms to present in babies? Are there other potential explanations that you found when researching this?\n\nRossant: Yeah. So actually, now we know a lot of possible causes of subdural and retinal hemorrhage. First, there’s everything involving accidental trauma, like short falls and domestic accidents. Whenever there’s an impact to the head, even what appears to be a small impact, it can really cause severe injuries, including what we see in shaken baby syndrome. There’s also biomechanical data about this. Impact is really dangerous for the skull and for the brain in a child.\n\nThen you have many rare diseases, like a genetic, metabolic, neurological conditions that can all cause subdural hematoma or be a risk factor for the development of subdural hematoma after a minor impact, which really happens in most babies. Once they start to sit down, they can fall, and when they try to get up, to stand up, they can also fall. So it’s really, really common for babies to hit their head. Most of the time, it’s not going to cause anything, but if there is a medical condition, if there is a risk factor, then it might cause the findings of shaken baby syndrome.\n\nThere are infections that can cause blood-clotting disorders. There’s really a lot of things. It’s really complicated. It’s really not possible to say that only shaking is the only cause of the SBS findings. There are also risk factors—again, it can be medical conditions.\n\nBut it can be just a prematurity. It’s a big risk factor. These babies are much more fragile. Babies who have a low birth weight, babies who have a large head—there are many little things like this that can increase the risk of a subdural retinal hemorrhage after minor impact. So yeah, it’s really complicated.\n\nDemsas: I want to talk about some of the pushback that people like you have received from other scientists who stand by the shaken-baby-syndrome diagnosis and say that it is perfectly reasonable for doctors to presume, and for the courts to presume, that when these injuries present in babies, that we should assume a caregiver has shaken the child. What they often point to is the fact that numerous perpetrators have confessed and admitted to shaking their babies, and that the confessions often will provide detailed accounts that match the medical findings of shaken baby syndromes, and that they have these consistent patterns.\n\nWhy is that not convincing to you that, perhaps, maybe it’s the case that science hasn’t figured out exactly how shaking will cause these symptoms, but if people are admitting to having shaken their baby and then their baby is presenting with these symptoms, that’s a reasonable cause and effect to presume?\n\nRossant: Yeah, it’s true that confessions—today, it’s the main piece of evidence for shaken baby syndrome. The question is not whether confessions exist or not; it’s how reliable they are, and what you can learn from the confessions. So confessions do exist. And I also want to stress that, obviously, some of these confessions are true, and that some parents do abuse the babies, and they end up confessing when they are being interrogated by the police.\n\nSo yeah, you cannot possibly say that all confessions are false. It’s not working like this. That being said, I’ve studied this question a lot in the scientific literature, and it’s true to say that they are really unreliable scientifically. They are not scientific evidence. And it’s not obvious to realize that, because when you don’t know the subject, you think, Well, if the person admits something that horrible, it must be true. There’s no reason for an innocent person to say they did it if they did not.\n\nBut it’s much more complicated than that. The topic of false confessions in general—not just for a shaken baby, but for any type of crime—has been known for decades. You know the Innocence Project that was able to exonerate a lot of people based on DNA evidence? Well, it turns out that between 25 and 30 percent of all the DNA exonerations had falsely confessed, and they were factually innocent, because that was proved by DNA, which could point to someone else. So it’s something that exists.\n\nNow, you wonder why innocent people confess. So there are many reasons. There’s even a classification that was done by a psychologist and scientist. There’s a psychologist called Saul Kassin, who is an expert of this, and he has devised a classification of false confessions.\n\nSo for example, one of the reasons is just plea deals. So they plead guilty, and they might not go to jail, and they can walk free, but they have to say they did it. But even without that, even in the police interrogation room, innocent people can be led to confess what they did not do, in this context.\n\nFor example, the police can say, Well, if you confess, the child, who is in foster care, can go back to you. You can get back your child if you confess. Or maybe, If you confess, your child can go back to the other parent. There are many incentives that are given by the police to the persons to confess. And the reason for that is that the police are being taught, like medical doctors, that shaking is the only possible cause and that it has to be that last person with the baby at the time of the collapse, right?\n\nThere’s also the whole thing of internalized false confessions. It’s really mysterious. It’s really a psychological effect that can lead innocent people who deny having harmed their child while being interrogated to slowly, in the course of hours or even days of interrogation in a very stressful context, to believe that maybe they did something that they did not think was harmful but was actually harmful, or at least that’s what they are led to believe. And it really happens a lot in this particular type of case. The police can make a lot of scenarios: Okay, maybe you didn’t want to harm your child, but you took the child from the bed a bit quickly, or maybe the head hit something, or you were not careful enough.\n\nThere’s a lot of scenarios that are being fed to the suspect. And in this specific stressful context, innocent parents who are really—they have this guilt of maybe they think they did not do everything they could to save their children. Maybe they tried to resuscitate their child with cardiac massage or something, or maybe they tried to slowly shake the baby, but it’s a very mild type of shaking. It’s really not a violent shaking. So you can always find something.\n\nAnd this really happens, and I’ve seen it a lot, and it’s been documented on videotaped police interrogation. You can see it in some transcripts. So when you really dig into the details of what has been confessed exactly and how it has been confessed, and when you look at all the context of the interrogation, you realize that it’s really not, Okay. Well, okay. I admit it. I just lost my nerves and violently shook my baby. This is very rare. This is not the type of confession you see in shaken baby syndrome. It’s: Oh my God. Okay. Maybe I did it. I didn’t realize my baby was collapsing. And yeah, I tried to revive my child. And maybe in the process, I harmed my child, and I—oh my God.\n\nIt’s a really complex phenomenon. But it’s been documented, and I think it happens a lot. So you cannot just say, Okay, confessions exist, so it must be true, right? That being said, most confessions are obtained after the diagnosis—so typically, after the police have been called, and it’s most often in the police interrogation room, right?\n\nSo there’s this big contamination, and it’s more than that. It’s really a pressure, because the police think they know that the baby was shaken and that this person is guilty, so there’s a whole bias, right? What would be interesting would be to see if confessions can be obtained before—before the police interrogation and even before the medical exam that will show the medical findings that are associated with SBS. Because if it’s obtained before, then there’s no way the diagnosis could influence the confession. Obviously, this kind of confession is very rare, but there is at least one study that was able to find something like 36 cases where the confessions were obtained before any kind of medical exam.\n\nSo there’s a lot of reason to believe that these kinds of confessions are genuine, true, right? And what’s interesting is that, in those cases, you are not going to find the medical findings of SBS. So yeah, there are many reasons to be skeptical of this theory.\n\n[Music]\n\nDemsas: After the break: Shaken baby syndrome goes by a different name now, but the same problems persist.\n\n[Break]\n\nDemsas: I’m hoping you can explain why the term shaken baby syndrome has fallen out of use. Now we’re more likely to hear the term abusive head trauma, and I’d assumed that was due to the criticisms levied by folks like you who’ve become skeptical of the SBS diagnosis. But in a policy statement about the diagnosis, the American Academy of Pediatrics said that the name change to abusive head trauma “was misinterpreted by some in the legal and medical communities as an indication of some doubt in or invalidation of the diagnosis and the mechanism of shaking as a cause of injury.” And then they say that the AAP, “continues to embrace the ‘shaken baby syndrome’ diagnosis as a valid subset of the AHT diagnosis.”\n\nSo what’s your interpretation of what’s going on there?\n\nRossant: Yeah, so it’s true that in 2009, the AAP published a position paper stating that from now on, “abusive head trauma” should be used instead of “shaken baby syndrome.” And the way they justify this was because it was to encompass a broader source of abuse inflicted to babies—not just shaking, but also impact to the head. That’s the justification.\n\nAnd there was one big study in ’87 by [A. C.] Duhaime and a few biomechanicians who really showed, first, that there were very often signs of impact, which was not really compatible with the idea that these babies were just shaken, right? And also, they did a biomechanical study to show that the forces involved with shaking are much lower than when there’s any kind of impact to the head. So impact to the head is really, really severe and implies very big forces to the head and big deformation and big energy. So it’s much more dangerous.\n\nAnd there was some controversy in scientific articles about this that partly led to, I think, this decision to change the name from shaken baby syndrome to abusive head trauma, because it was not just shaking very frequently; there’s also impact.\n\nNow, it’s true that before 2009, especially since the Louise Woodward trial in Boston in 1997, there was a lot of controversy in the media and the scientific articles on specifically shaken baby syndrome, the hypothesis that you could infer abuse just with the triad, without any sign of impact. And yeah, some people believe that this change of name is a consequence of this controversy. Obviously, the AAP, the medical institutions do not really acknowledge this, because their position has always been to say that there is no controversy at all, right?\n\nSo here we are. I mean, we have this change of name that has been more or less accepted by everyone, even though the term shaken baby syndrome is still quite widely known in the public.\n\nThere’s something else that should be pointed out. It’s that the term shaken baby syndrome was criticized—the very term—in particular by Norman Guthkelch, who first identified shaken baby syndrome, or at least the link between shaking and subdural hematoma, in 1971. He criticized the fact that the same term is used to describe both an act—shaking—and a set of injuries. So it conflates a unique hypothetical cause to objective findings. And it’s a real problem because you can’t talk about what you see without accepting that there might be other causes than shaking.\n\nSo that’s why he recommended to use another term, which was, I think, retinal-dural hemorrhage of infancy. That really just describes the fact that you find subdural and retinal hemorrhage in an infant without presuming anything about the cause. Unfortunately, that was not the choice that was made, and now we have abusive head trauma, which is also problematic because it also implies that, well, it’s abuse. So it’s a medical diagnosis that comes after you discover specific medical findings in an infant, and you give the term abusive head trauma, which implies that it was caused by abuse.\n\nSo there’s this whole thing of intent that is really not the job of medicine. It’s for the police and the justice to determine what happened and what the intent was. So the previous term was a problem with this respect, and the new one is still problematic in this respect.\n\nDemsas: Yeah. It was really interesting when I was reading about the controversy with Norman Guthkelch, who you just mentioned. I mean, he’s called, like, the father of shaken baby syndrome because of his 1971 paper. NPR reported that he reviewed a case in Arizona, and they wrote that “he was troubled to see that the medical examiner’s autopsy had concluded that the baby died of shaken baby syndrome while discounting other possible causes.”\n\nSo, you know, given that, why do you think it’s been difficult for the medical community to become more agnostic about whether these injuries that show up in children are necessarily the result of abuse or of some other thing going on? Like, why is the AAP still saying this? I mean, I know you can’t speak about them specifically, but why do you think there’s just been such reticence from the medical community?\n\nRossant: Oh, that’s a very good question, and I am wondering this. I mean, it’s been almost 10 years that I ask myself this very question, and I don’t really know.\n\nI think there’s—I mean, it’s more general than that. It’s, you know, in the human psychology, the fact that it’s very hard to recognize that you were wrong before. It’s very hard to change one’s own mind, especially when doctors have made a lot of diagnoses with very severe consequences: with removal, going into foster care, and, you know, criminal prosecutions, etcetera.\n\nIt’s very hard to accept that, as a doctor, you were wrong and you maybe did some misanalysis and you were responsible for, you know, miscarriages of justice, etcetera. I think it’s really the No. 1 thing that is blocking everything, this psychological aspects of doctors, who are humans, like everyone else.\n\nSome doctors do change their minds with the new science, the new articles, new data, their new experience, new cases. They realize that maybe it was not as easy as we thought before, and they start to change their minds. They start to work for the defense, and then they are being targeted and bullied, attacked, especially by the establishments, and it’s always the same. So yeah, it’s really in human nature.\n\nI think it’s also the scale. I think it’s not just a few errors here and there. It’s really, really massive. I think there are many, many cases which are misdiagnosed and that the so-called shaken babies were not really shaken. I mean, obviously, it exists, and there are many cases where the diagnosis was true, but many where it was not the case. So that’s also why it’s so hard to accept one’s own mistakes, because it's a really massive mistake that was done.\n\nDemsas: Something you just said about how much they react to public censure here: There was a quote from this Milwaukee prosecutor. I believe this is from a ProPublica article, but he’s a deputy district attorney in Milwaukee, and he said it was, “providing reasonable doubt for sale.”\n\nEssentially, there’s some criticisms of people who will provide reasonable doubt or arguments that provide reasonable doubt to accused criminals, whether it’s forensic evidence, like fingerprint analysis or DNA analysis or things like the SBS. But there’s been a real backlash from within the law-enforcement community to scientific evidence being muddled in courtrooms. And I wonder: Have you come across people who react to your work and believe you’re giving cover to child abusers? What do you say to them?\n\nRossant: Yeah, I think I kind of understand because there’s always this tension between, you know, being too safe on the safe side—I mean, is it better to put an innocent person in jail, or to let a guilty person walk free and potentially harm children, right?\n\nAnd personally as someone who believes in democracy and, you know, les lumières, which is a really French thing. I think it’s really important not to harm innocent people. So it’s really kind of philosophical attitude, I think. But yeah, I can understand why some people believe that it’s not possible to take this risk of letting potentially dangerous people walk free.\n\nBut you know, in the end, I think we should all try to do our best and try to be as accurate and scientific as possible. Try to look at all the evidence on the one side or the other side, and then let the criminal-justice system do its work. And that’s why we have this notion of “beyond a reasonable doubt,” you know, the burden of proof, all of these things. They were designed precisely to avoid, as much as possible, putting innocents behind bars, which is a very terrible thing to do as a democracy, I think.\n\nDemsas: Do you have thoughts on how you would’ve preferred to have things play out in your case? When a doctor is concerned about SBS with your child, what do you wish had happened?\n\nRossant: I think most parents, most families would accept something, some kind of measure that is not removing the child. So, you know, a follow-up with the psychologists, social workers, people that go to your place and that look at the room, how you handle your child, that follow you from a few months, maybe one year, I don’t know. It depends on the situation, but that is fine.\n\nAnd we actually had that. Even though the nanny was being prosecuted after the first month, we did have a follow-up with a psychologist and social workers for, like, two years, I think. It was very light. It could have been, you know, more intrusive, and it would’ve been fine. I mean, there’s no problem as long as you have the freedom to have your child with you, right?\n\nIt’s really the fact that to remove a child from its environment, it’s a really big cost, so that should really be done in the most extreme cases. And typically, some judges do say that it only happens in the most extreme cases, and that they tried to do their best not to go that far and to find all possible solutions before resorting, as a last solution, to foster care.\n\nBut in practice, in the cases I know—and especially in the abusive-head-trauma cases—for very, very small children, babies who don’t speak, it’s very often removal into a foster family in a nursery. And that’s really, really hard for the child, and for the parents to know that the child is suffering from being suddenly put into a different place and without parents, without siblings, without the teddy bears and, you know.\n\nDemsas: Yeah, I guess it depends on where you are and how the authorities function. But, you know, I could imagine that most parents would be okay with having an interview with Child Protective Services if, you know, it was respectful and there’s a clear protocol for what was being followed.\n\nAnd I think there are a lot of civil servants who take their jobs seriously and want to make families better. But I think it’s very variable, especially in the United States, where this is not a federalized system. There’s very many different administrations of child protective services. And where you are can vary very differently, how you’re treated and how you interact with and how the state interacts with you.\n\nAnd so, I agree—we would want to create a system where parents felt fine and open and welcome to that kind of surveillance and interaction, but I worry that we don’t actually have that in the entire world.\n\nRossant: Yeah. And it’s actually the same in France. Today there’s no centralized child-protection system. It’s each department, each region of France that has its own system. So there are great disparities between the different regions, and we do see very, very different treatments of similar situations, depending on where you are in the same country. So yeah, it’s a very difficult problem, and some families do not understand why it’s worse in their own case compared to other families.\n\nDemsas: This was obviously a very serious episode, but I always like to end on a question that draws people to think about and reflect on a time when they themselves have believed something that didn’t turn out to be true. So in your life, is there a time where you believed something that ended up being only good on paper?\n\nRossant: Wow. Good question. I really never thought about this. But maybe I can say that initially—and sorry; it’s still about shaken baby syndrome, but initially—I believed that shaken baby syndrome was a thing.\n\nWhy? Because my own father was a pediatrician and an expert in court, and he told me many times about shaken baby syndrome, and he did testify for the prosecution in shaken-baby cases. So I knew it.\n\nDemsas: Wow.\n\nRossant: Yeah, it’s really a crazy coincidence, right? Sadly, he passed away one month before the symptoms of my child. So just before that. He could have been very helpful, obviously. But that’s why I had this bias at the beginning, when I was starting to look into the literature. I was sure that shaken baby syndrome was entirely legitimate, and I thought there was no controversy.\n\nSo when I started looking into it, I really didn’t think that I would change my mind, but I actually changed my mind. It was really hard for me to do it, because I was so convinced that the scientific consensus was right. And even my own father was testifying in court that this theory was correct. So it was not easy for me to change my mind, but I had to, because that’s what the evidence was telling me.\n\nDemsas: Well, that’s a model for what we’re trying to do on this show. Cyrille, thank you so much for coming on.\n\nRossant: Thank you. Thank you a lot.\n\n[Music]\n\nDemsas: Good on Paper is produced by Rosie Hughes.

        "source": "https://www.theatlantic.com/",
        "content": "Steven Soderbergh films are like buses: There’s always another one coming. This isn’t a complaint, exactly, but the director’s prolific nature is on my mind with each of his new projects—he released Presence two months ago, and he’s already got another one? How much effort could he have put into it? Black Bag, a taut spy thriller starring Cate Blanchett and Michael Fassbender, is an argument for the filmmaker’s ruthless efficiency. Yes, the speed with which Soderbergh has hopped from genre exercise to genre exercise of late is a little dizzying; he’s pumped out works of horror, romance, thriller, and comedy all since 2020. His skill with each, nonetheless, is hard to deny.\n\nBlack Bag, like the recent Soderbergh movies Presence and Kimi, was written by David Koepp; he’s a Hollywood stanchion who is best known for major blockbusters including Jurassic Park and Spider-Man. Now, though, Koepp is seemingly hell-bent on reviving the midsize feature that Hollywood has been missing. His latest collaboration with Soderbergh, a cat-and-mouse story about a married pair of spies, is a throwback in many ways—but its observations about the intrusive nature of espionage work on their lives feel sharply contemporary.\n\nThe setup is straightforward. The glamorous Kathryn St. Jean (Blanchett) is a renowned British spy who is accused of being a double agent by an anonymous tipster. The big brass tasks the preening, excessively kempt George Woodhouse (Fassbender) with investigating her and some other colleagues in order to root out the traitor. There is a twist, of course: Kathryn and George are married. The mega-spies live together in a pristine London home that’s a den of class, sophistication, and potential sabotage. Soderbergh has found the two perfect actors for this scenario; they’re impressive yet impassive movie stars who look glamorous even if they’re parked behind a laptop. Their dazzling facades, however, hide unspoken darkness.\n\nBlanchett serves glossy, Hollywood oomph, while Fassbender is playing a fussy, British spin on the hit-man character he portrayed so well in David Fincher’s The Killer. George is a major control freak whose freakery just might be getting the better of him. His favorite pastime, it seems, is inviting people over for dinner and dosing the dishes with a truth serum. (“Avoid the chana masala,” he warns his wife.) This is the informal version of administering lie-detector tests, his professional speciality. But despite being a top mole-hunter, George can’t take quite as brutal or direct an approach with his wife. Thus, he must resort to bouncing his suspicions off her co-workers—performed by a fine-tuned group of talented company players.\n\nRead: A movie about the perils of being a control freak\n\nAmong them is Tom Burke (from The Souvenir and last year’s Furiosa) as an agent with a proclivity for infidelity and booze; and Marisa Abela (known for Industry and the recent Amy Winehouse biopic) as a tech wiz and his on-and-off love interest. Naomie Harris and Regé-Jean Page fill out the cast as more experienced agents growing tired of George’s parlor games, while Pierce Brosnan lurks in the background as a disapproving boss. Soderbergh wisely leverages everyone’s fame to further confuse the audience: Fassbender’s on-screen tendency toward villainous roles makes him a disorienting protagonist to root for, while Blanchett’s natural gravitas renders her difficult not to trust.\n\nAt a blissful 93 minutes long, Black Bag keeps audiences happily guessing before dropping its final reveals. Though it has the same intimacy of many a Soderbergh effort of late—he tends to work quickly to keep budgets low and attract big-name talent—the director manages to squeeze in a couple of globe-trotting moments for some visual panache. Yet these foreign missions are largely glimpsed as surveillance on a computer screen. Most of Black Bag is instead set in enclosed spaces: the oppressive blank offices of the British intelligence services everyone works for, or George and Kathryn’s seductive and candlelit home, a welcoming environment that quickly turns into a pit of vipers when all the spies sit down for a meal.\n\nWill Soderbergh ever make another truly big movie? Black Bag had me thinking about some of his past hits, such as Ocean’s Eleven; these were large ensemble pieces that had proper scope to them. Black Bag is halfway there, although Soderbergh’s approach has an artfulness to it; he’s telling a sweeping story while keeping the excitement mostly confined. The result, while self-contained, is gripping, quietly sexy, and robustly acted. Plus, given the scarcity of films for grown-ups in theaters right now, I cannot complain about a good update on the drawing-room mystery. But maybe one day I’ll sit Soderbergh down, give him a heavy helping of George’s curried truth serum, and ask if he’d ever consider making a grand action epic again.",

        "content": "is a senior writer at Future Perfect, Vox’s effective altruism-inspired section on the world’s biggest challenges. She explores wide-ranging topics like climate change, artificial intelligence, vaccine development, and factory farms, and also writes the Future Perfect newsletter.\n\nModern large language models are really good at a lot of tasks, like coding, essay writing, translation, and research. But there are still a lot of basic tasks, especially in the “personal assistant” realm, that the most highly trained AIs in the world remain hopeless at.\n\nYou can’t ask ChatGPT or Claude “order me a burrito from Chipotle” and get one, let alone “book me a train from New York to Philadelphia.” OpenAI and Anthropic both offer AIs that can view your screen, move your cursor, and do some things on your computer as if they were a person (through their “Operator” and “Computer Use” functions, respectively).\n\nThis story was first featured in the Future Perfect newsletter. Sign up here to explore the big, complicated problems the world faces and the most efficient ways to solve them. Sent twice a week.\n\nThat such “AI agents” sometimes work, sort of, is about the strongest thing you can say for them right now. (Disclosure: Vox Media is one of several publishers that has signed partnership agreements with OpenAI. One of Anthropic’s early investors is James McClave, whose BEMC Foundation helps fund Future Perfect. Our reporting remains editorially independent.)\n\nThis week, China launched a competitor: the AI agent Manus. It produced a blizzard of glowing posts and testimonials from highly selected influencers, along with some impressive website demos.\n\nManus is invite-only (and while I submitted a request for the tool, it hasn’t been granted), so it’s hard to tell from the outside how representative these highly selected examples are. After a few days of Manus fervor, though, the bubble popped a little and some more moderate reviews started coming out.\n\nManus, the growing consensus holds, is worse than OpenAI’s DeepResearch at research tasks; but better than Operator or Computer Use at personal assistant tasks. It’s a step forward toward something important — AIs that can take action beyond the chatbot window — but it’s not a shocking out-of-nowhere advance.\n\nPerhaps most importantly, Manus’s usefulness for you will be sharply limited if you don’t trust a Chinese company you’ve never heard of with your payment information so it can book things on your behalf. And you probably shouldn’t.\n\nThe agents are arriving\n\nWhen I first wrote about the risks of powerful AI systems displacing or destroying humanity, one very reasonable question was this: How could an AI act against humanity, when they really don’t act at all?\n\nThis reasoning is right, as far as current technology goes. Claude or ChatGPT, which just respond to user prompts and don’t act independently in the world, can’t execute on a long-term plan; everything they do is in response to a prompt, and almost all that action takes place within the chat window.\n\nBut AI was never going to remain as a purely responsive tool simply because there is so much potential for profit in agents. People have been trying for years to create AIs that are built out of language models, but which make decisions independently, so that people can relate to them more like an employee or an assistant than like a chatbot.\n\nGenerally, this works by creating a small internal hierarchy of language models, like a little AI company. One of the models is carefully prompted and in some cases fine-tuned to do large-scale planning. It comes up with a long-term plan, which it delegates to other language models. Various sub-agents check their results and change approaches when one sub-agent fails or reports problems.\n\nThe concept is simple, and Manus is far from the first to try it. You may remember that last year we had Devin, which was marketed as a junior software engineering employee. It was an AI agent that you interacted with via Slack to give tasks, and which it would then work on achieving without further human input except, ideally, of the kind a human employee might occasionally need.\n\nThe economic incentives to build something like Manus or Devin are overwhelming. Tech companies pay junior software engineers as much as $100,000 a year or more. An AI that could actually provide that value would be stunningly profitable. Travel agents, curriculum developers, personal assistants — these are all fairly well-paid jobs, and an AI agent could in principle be able to do the work at a fraction of the cost, without needing breaks, benefits or vacations.\n\nBut Devin turned out to be overhyped, and didn’t work well enough for the market it was aiming at. It’s too soon to say whether Manus represents enough of an advance to have real commercial staying power, or whether, like Devin, its reach will exceed its grasp.\n\nI’ll say that it appears Manus works better than anything that has come before. But just working better isn’t enough — to trust an AI to spend your money or plan your vacation, you’ll need extremely high reliability. As long as Manus remains tightly limited in availability, it’s hard to say if it will be able to offer that. My best guess is that AI agents that seamlessly work are still a year or two away — but only a year or two.\n\nThe China angle\n\nManus isn’t just the latest and greatest attempt at an AI agent.\n\nIt is also the product of a Chinese company, and much of the coverage has dwelled on the Chinese angle. Manus is clearly proof that Chinese companies aren’t just imitating what’s being built here in America, as they’ve often been accused of doing, but improving on it.\n\nThat conclusion shouldn’t be shocking to anyone who is aware of China’s intense interest in AI. It also raises questions about whether we will be thoughtful about exporting all of our personal and financial data to Chinese companies that are not meaningfully accountable to US regulators or US law.\n\nInstalling Manus on your computer gives it a lot of access to your computer — it’s hard for me to figure out the exact limits on its access or the security of its sandbox when I can’t install it myself.\n\nOne thing we’ve learned in digital privacy debates is that a lot of people will do this without thinking about the implications if they feel Manus offers them enough convenience. And as the TikTok fight made clear, once millions of Americans love an app, the government will face a steep uphill battle in trying to restrict it or oblige it to follow data privacy rules.\n\nBut there are also clear reasons Manus came out of a Chinese company and not out of, say, Meta — and they’re the very reasons we might prefer to use AI agents from Meta. Meta is subject to US liability law. If its agent makes a mistake and spends all your money on website hosting, or if it steals your Bitcoin or uploads your private photos, Meta will probably be liable. For all of these reasons, Meta (and its US competitors) are being cautious in this realm.\n\nI think caution is appropriate, even as it may be insufficient. Building agents that act independently on the internet is a big deal, one that poses major safety questions, and I’d like us to have a robust legal framework about what they can do and who is ultimately accountable.\n\nBut the worst of all possible worlds is a state of uncertainty that punishes caution and encourages everyone to run agents that have no accountability at all. We have a year or two to figure out how to do better. Let’s hope Manus prompts us to get to work on not just building those agents, but building the legal framework that will keep them safe.\n\nA version of this story originally appeared in the Future Perfect newsletter.

        "content": "Four years ago, Richard Hanania was a little-known right-wing intellectual, one of many posters building a brand with tweets and Substack posts attacking “wokeness” and other conservative bugbears.\n\nBut in the middle of 2021, one of his ideas took off. In an article called “Woke Institutions is Just Civil Rights Law,” Hanania argued that many issues conservatives worry about aren’t just cultural, but also stem from civil rights law — and specifically from Executive Order 11246, an order signed by Lyndon Johnson in 1965 that requires most federal contractors to take “affirmative action” in their hiring. In 2023, Hanania expanded on the article in a book, The Origins of Woke: Civil Rights Law, Corporate America, and the Triumph of Identity Politics.\n\nThat year, Hanania appeared on Vivek Ramaswamy’s podcast, where he talked to the then-presidential candidate about EO 11246 and suggested that the next Republican president should repeal it and replace it with an order banning affirmative action from government contractors. Ramaswamy said he liked the idea.\n\nOn President Donald Trump’s first day in office, he followed Hanania’s blueprint to the letter.\n\n“I was happy,” Hanania recently told Today, Explained co-host Noel King. “I wasn’t anybody special. I didn’t have any reason to think anyone would listen to me. And eventually I saw the outcome that I wanted.”\n\nThis episode is not unique. Many Trump 2.0 decisions, from purging the federal workforce to re-hiring a DOGE employee who made racist comments online, have their origins in a small group of ring-wing intellectuals, what Vox’s Andrew Prokop has called the “very-online right.” This group encompasses well-known figures like Elon Musk and Marc Andreessen, as well as posters like Hanania.\n\nToday, Explained co-host Noel King recently spoke with Hanania about his journey from anonymously posting racist and misogynist diatribes to wielding real political influence in the early days of Trump’s second administration, and why he’s now grown disenchanted with the movement that adopted his ideas.\n\nBelow is an excerpt of their conversation, edited for length and clarity. Listen to Today, Explained wherever you get your podcasts, including Apple Podcasts, Pandora, and Spotify.\n\nIn the summer of 2023, you were a public intellectual. You’d been writing op-eds for the New York Times, the Washington Post, The Atlantic. And then that August, the Huffington Post reported that years earlier you’d written racist, misogynist posts on right-wing websites.\n\nI’m going to read a couple of those here: “For the white gene pool to be created, millions had to die.” “Race mixing is like destroying a unique species or a piece of art. It’s shameful.” “Hispanic people don’t have the requisite IQ to be a productive part of a first-world nation.” You said Muslims can’t assimilate because of “genetic and IQ differences between them and native Europeans.” And you suggested that people with low IQ might be sterilized.\n\nWere those sincere beliefs that you held?\n\nYes. I can’t lie to you and tell you that those weren’t sincere beliefs. Some of the ways I phrased it was sometimes getting a rise out of people. But I can’t deny that I did hold those views. This, I should note, was around 2010, 2011. So by the time it came out of the Huffington Post, it was about 12, 13 years later. But, yeah, I had some views that I now consider repugnant, and [that] I was actually writing against, before that August 2023 exposition.\n\nWhat led to you holding those views?\n\nI think I was just young and angry. I saw these ideas that you couldn’t talk about, certain things like male-female differences, the idea that America was a racist country, which I didn’t believe at the time and I don’t believe now, or at least racist enough to explain disparities between groups of people.\n\nI didn’t like censorship. I didn’t like a lot of the things that conservatives in later years would turn against, [like] DEI, which was at an early stage right there. And so I was angry. I was looking for people who were angry like me. And I think it was probably a lot of personal things going on in my life. By about 2012, 2013, I had sort of grown out of it, which I think often happens.\n\nIn November of 2023, after the Huffington Post exposed you, you tweeted, “people complain about Jews running America. Do they actually believe it should be run by the voters of Baltimore or Appalachia? Doesn’t seem that anti-Semites have thought this through.” So that was years after you were young.\n\nWell, I would make a distinction between that and the earlier stuff. There’s a long intellectual tradition of people not believing in a kind of naive form of direct democracy, going back to the American founders, to today — and even before the American founders, going back to the ancient Greeks.\n\nI said Appalachians and inner-city Baltimore — I was saying generally poor communities, which are on average less informed about politics and have views that might not be the most coherent about making policy.\n\nBringing up the Jews in that context was defending Jews, saying, “Accepting your premise, if Jews do control America, what’s the alternative?” They are disproportionately a smart, educated group of people. And I say smart, educated people having disproportionate power in society is a good thing. So I don’t see that as as racist or hateful or anything like that. While those quotes you read at the beginning, I will grant you that those are things that I wouldn’t stand by and nobody else should.\n\nBy the summer of 2023, you had built a broad audience in both mainstream media and also on Twitter and Substack. What was the thrust of your main argument?\n\nI had an article which eventually turned into my book, The Origins of Woke, which argued that a lot of the cultural issues that conservatives were mad about — a lot of the ideas about disparate impact, a lot of the ideas that, you know, you couldn’t be hard on crime because it has an impact on one group of people more than the other group of people, or you couldn’t have standardized tests or and so forth — a lot of that was kind of baked into civil rights law. Not necessarily the text of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, but a lot of judicial interpretation and executive action that came in the years and decades that followed.\n\nSo I was arguing that conservatives were upset about this thing they called DEI or wokeness, and they were seeing it as mainly a cultural issue. Oh, look at Target, look at the State Department, look at what they’re all doing. And my argument was [that] there is a policy agenda here that you can focus on.\n\nWhen did it become clear to you that this argument that you were making was resonating?\n\nIt was right away. It was something that conservatives were already interested in and they needed to understand that there was a policy solution to the problems they were concerned about.\n\nVivek Ramaswamy, when he was unknown before he was running for president, wrote a book called Woke, Inc. I reviewed it for a publication called American Affairs. I criticized it based on some of my ideas, that he didn’t talk about civil rights law. We were concerned about the same things, but he didn’t bring up the kind of history that I talked about here.\n\nHe actually reached out and we started to be in touch based on that. I explained to him a lot of these things. I appeared on his podcast. He started talking about it. He started going on campaign stops later when he was running for president and saying, “First day, I will repeal Executive Order 11246” [the law requiring affirmative action in federal contracting], and this was the executive order that I mentioned in my book that Johnson signed in ’65.\n\nTrump actually gets into office and Trump does sign a repeal of Executive Order 11246. It does a lot of the other things that I recommended. So it was quite a journey where I think I played a role in putting these ideas on the map.\n\nWhat was the goal of ending 11246? What did you want to happen?\n\nEnding Executive Order 11246 was part of a broader project to take the government out of the idea that it should be taking consideration of race and sex, or enforcing such considerations onto the private sector, in terms of hiring, in terms of promotion.\n\nThere’s perhaps a role for the government to play in terms of ensuring non-discrimination as discrimination was understood. The concept was understood in 1964 when the Civil Rights Act was passed. But a lot of cultural changes within institutions were adopted as a defense against potential lawsuits and against potential loss of government contracts. So I wanted less DEI, less race- and sex-based governance, and less encouraging institutions to take positions that a lot of Americans don’t agree with.\n\nRichard, was corporate America actually complaining? Because it seems like if you run a big American corporation… [you] would look at the idea of diversity and would say, this is a good thing, because I want to sell things to American people and therefore having people within the company at a very high level who understand how to sell things to American people is a great thing. It’s good if they come from all kinds of backgrounds.\n\nWell, that’s true. I would respect business decisions on these things. If they want to have a program, that’s one thing. But these were mandates coming from the government and also the subjects of lawsuits.\n\nAnd sure, you can say, “I want to do market research on Hispanics,” or maybe have someone in the room who knows something about women’s products or things like that. I don’t think that there’s necessarily a strong correlation between that and, say, demographic balancing based on census categories.\n\nAnd I go into how the census categories were determined. It’s kind of arbitrary, right? I mean, it’s like the government cares that you have a certain number of Blacks or Hispanics, they don’t care if they are immigrants who just came here yesterday, or they are people who are culturally completely assimilated into the mainstream, as long as they have a Hispanic name. So there are good corporate reasons to sometimes take into account race, sex, cultural background. I don’t deny that. I don’t think that that’s necessarily what civil rights law has been forcing on companies.\n\nThe Trump administration did what you wanted. It eliminated DEI. And then it put Pete Hegseth in charge of the Pentagon, and Kash Patel in charge of the FBI, and Dan Bongino as the deputy director of the FBI. These gentlemen are not merit picks. And these are obvious examples.\n\nBut this is why Americans who are skeptical of your argument will say, look, you’re never really going to get merit. If we eliminate DEI, we’re going to go back to “the president picks a guy who he thinks looks handsome on TV.” Do you put any stock in that argument?\n\nAbsolutely, Noel. I’ve had some contacts with the Trump administration. I think one reason I have not been even closer to the Trump administration is that I’ve been highly critical of a lot of the non-DEI-related actions that he’s taken. I agree with you.\n\nI think some of these picks are certainly not merit-based. They don’t even rise to the level of public decorum and ethics you often expect from someone who’s going to be the FBI director or the head of the Department of Defense.\n\nI don’t think those are the only two choices: DEI/race-based governance or people that Trump thinks looks good on TV. I think you could have a merit-based system that looks at people, takes them as individuals, takes into account their qualifications, takes into account what the president is trying to accomplish, and that has more responsible people in positions of power.\n\nYou’ve clearly become disenchanted with MAGA. You wrote a piece this week that’s making the rounds. It’s called “Liberals Only Censor. Musk Seeks To Lobotomize.” What happened, Richard?\n\nWhen it looked like Trump was going to be the nominee and he might be president, I wanted my ideas to be listened to, and I wanted them to do certain things. At the same time, I don’t just write about DEI. I write about a wide range of topics. I say what I believe on those topics.\n\nI think there’s a level of corruption here, a level of blatant sort of corruption to the way government is working that is unprecedented, at least in our recent history.\n\nI was always against social media censorship. I thought this was a way to suppress conservative voices. But then Elon Musk buys Twitter. I’m happy. I say, “Okay, we’re going to have free speech.” And my goodness, it’s become a sewer! And I think that honesty and virtue and politics matter, and what I’ve seen from the conservative movement, that I’ve seen from MAGA, the conservative movement in general, as it’s become MAGA-fied, has just horrified me. And I’ve felt the need to speak out about this.\n\nHow do you feel about this movement that you are a part of, descending into what we have today?\n\nI’m unhappy. We all know Trump’s flaws. The first administration, though, we saw him surround himself with mostly responsible people. And so you can have a distaste for Trump and say, “Look, he’s still putting the same judges on the federal judiciary that DeSantis — or in many cases, Ted Cruz or Jeb Bush — would have.” And so you could say, “Well, I don’t like Trump, he can be sort of distasteful, but the movement is more than just Trump.”",

        "source": "https://www.vox.com/",
        "content": "On the first day of Donald Trump’s second presidential term, he signed an executive order about an old American rule: that with very few exceptions, anyone born here is a citizen. Trump’s order stated that the rule should no longer apply to the children of those in the United States illegally or temporarily. And while, within a few weeks, that order had been blocked by multiple federal judges, it was a temporary resolution, with the ultimate outcome yet to be determined, probably by the Supreme Court.\n\nThe US is far from the only country in the world that offers unconditional birthright citizenship. While it’s uncommon in Europe, Asia, and Africa, it’s very common among Western Hemisphere countries, partly because of their history as colonies populated mostly by settlers. But of the many countries with birthright citizenship in the world, the US is by far the largest, with hundreds of thousands of baby citizens born here every year to noncitizen parents. Those numbers naturally raise the questions: Is this what birthright citizenship was meant for? And why do we have birthright citizenship in the first place?\n\nThe short answer is that birthright citizenship in the US came about as a way of granting citizenship after the American Civil War to the large population of formerly enslaved Black people. But that raises a different question: How did a law intended for Black Americans end up creating hundreds of thousands of new US citizens born to immigrant parents every year? In the video above, we trace that history, answer that question, and look at a few of the times that the US has actually had this argument before. Today’s concerns over birthright citizenship may feel specific to our particular immigration debate. They’re actually not.",

His coverage focuses on all things cinema, from the intricacies of film history to the nuts and bolts of filmmaking.\n\nIn 2025, Tom Hanks is 67 years old. Yet, in his latest film Here (directed by Robert Zemeckis), he’s convincingly transformed to appear as young as 18, and aged even beyond his current years. And the effect actually looks … good!\n\nBut de-aging effects haven’t always looked this good. Attempts at de-aging can be seen as early as 2006 — and since then filmmakers have experimented with tools and had … varying degrees of success. While 2D blurring and enhancement was the first iteration, realistic de-aging in motion required 3D methods — but no matter which way you sliced it, the process remained labor-intensive and results were often somewhere between okay and the uncanny valley.\n\nHere’s VFX supervisor Kevin Baillie told me that the current versions of these tools weren’t going to work on the movie. There were too many shots, and the results were too inconsistent for the quality level they were striving toward. So the filmmaking team looked elsewhere, to the bleeding edge of AI tools, to see what was possible. By feeding it a wealth of images featuring Tom Hanks and co-stars Robin Wright, Paul Bettany, and Kelly Reilly, they found they could create images that were remarkably realistic, streamlining the once arduous process.\n\nBut the true game changer was optimizing the speed of this tool to enable a real-time feed on set. This empowered actors, costume designers, makeup artists, hairstylists, and other crew members to ensure that every version of the characters, at any age, felt authentic and believable.\n\nIf you want to learn more about how all this was pulled off, check out Vox Video’s latest!",

        "source": "https://www.vox.com/",
        "content": "is a senior correspondent and head writer for Vox’s Future Perfect section and has worked at Vox since 2014. He is particularly interested in global health and pandemic prevention, anti-poverty efforts, economic policy and theory, and conflicts about the right way to do philanthropy.\n\nMy entire job takes place on my laptop.\n\nI write stories like this in Google Docs on my laptop. I coordinate with my editor in Slack on my laptop. I reach out to sources with Gmail and then interview them over Zoom, on my laptop. This isn’t true of all journalists — some go to war zones — but it’s true of many of us, and for accountants, tax preparers, software engineers, and many more workers, maybe over one in 10, besides.\n\nLaptop jobs have many charms: the lack of a commute or dress code, the location flexibility, the absence of real physical strain. But if you’re a laptop worker and not worried about what’s coming in the next decade, you haven’t been paying attention. There is no segment of the labor market more at risk from rapid improvements in AI than us.\n\nThe newest “reasoning models” from top AI companies are already essentially human-level, if not superhuman, at many programming tasks, which in turn has already led new tech startups to hire fewer workers. Generative AIs like Dall-E, Sora, or Midjourney are actively competing with human visual artists; they’ve already noticeably reduced demand for freelance graphic design.\n\nServices like OpenAI’s Deep Research are very good at internet-based research projects like, say, digging up background information for a Vox piece. “Agentic” AIs like Operator are able to coordinate and sequence these kinds of tasks the way a good manager might. And the rapid pace of progress in the field means that laptop warriors can’t even take comfort in the fact that current versions of these programs and models may be janky and buggy. They will only get better from here, while we humans will stay mostly the same.\n\nAs AIs have improved at laptop job tasks, progress on more physical work has been slower. Humanoid robots capable of tasks like folding laundry have been a longtime dream, but the state-of-the-art falls wildly short of human level. Self-driving cars have seen considerable progress, but the dream has proven harder to achieve than boosters thought. While AI has been improving rapidly, robotics — the ability of AI to work in the physical world — has been improving much more slowly. At this point, a robot plumber or maid is far harder to imagine than a robot accountant or lawyer.\n\nLet me offer, then, a thought experiment. Imagine we get to a point — maybe in the next couple years, maybe in 10, maybe in 20 — when AI models can fully substitute for any remote worker. They can write this article better than me, make YouTube videos more popular than Mr. Beast’s, do the work of an army of accountants, and review millions of discovery documents for a multibillion-dollar lawsuit, all in a matter of minutes. We would have, to borrow a phrase from AI writer and investor Leopold Aschenbrenner, “drop-in remote workers.” How does that reshape the US, and world, economy?\n\nRight now this is a hypothetical. But it’s a hypothetical worth taking seriously — seriously enough that I may or may not be visiting the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers’ apprenticeship application most days, just in case I need work that requires a human body.\n\nFast AI progress, slow robotics progress\n\nIf you’ve heard of OpenAI, you’ve heard of its language models: GPTs 1, 2, 3, 3.5, 4, and most recently 4.5. You might have heard of their image generation model DALL-E or video generation model Sora.\n\nBut you probably haven’t heard of their Rubik’s cube solving robot. That’s because the team that built it was disbanded in 2021, about a year before the release of ChatGPT and the company’s explosion into public consciousness.\n\nOpenAI engineer Wojciech Zaremba explained on a podcast that year that the company had determined there was not enough real-world data of how to move in the real world to keep making progress on the robot. Two years of work, between 2017 and 2019, was enough to get the robot hand to a point where it could unscramble Rubik’s Cubes successfully 20 to 60 percent of the time, depending on how well-scrambled the Cube was. That’s … not especially great, particularly when held up next to OpenAI’s language models, which even in earlier versions seemed capable of competing with humans on certain tasks.\n\nIt’s a small story that encapsulates a truism in the AI world: the physical is lagging the cognitive. Or, more simply, the chatbots are beating the robots.\n\nThis is not a new observation: It’s called Moravec’s paradox, after the futurist Hans Moravec, who famously observed that computers tend to do poorly at tasks that are easy for humans and do well at tasks that are often hard for humans.\n\nWhy? Here we’re less sure. As the machine learning researcher Nathan Lambert once noted, Moravec’s paradox is “based on observation, not theory. We have a lot of work to do to figure out why.” But we have some hypotheses.\n\nPerhaps human-like motions are harder for robots because we gained them relatively early in evolutionary time, far earlier than our capacity for reasoning. Running on two or even four legs is a very old ability that many animals share; it’s instinctual for us, which both makes it harder for machines without that evolutionary history to learn, and harder for us to articulate to those machines.\n\nHarder still is the fact that a robot has to learn to run on two legs by actually running on two legs in real life. This point is key: If OpenAI had its servers pronouncing every sentence that ChatGPT generates, out loud, one at a time, as part of its training process, it probably would’ve taken millennia to get to today’s abilities. Instead, it was able to train the GPT models using millions of CPU cores operating in parallel to analyze vast reams of data, processing trillions of individual words a second. Each new model only requires months or a few years of training because the process happens much, much faster than real time.\n\nHistorically roboticists’ way around this limitation was to make simulated worlds, sort of purpose-built video game environments, in which to train robots much faster. But when you take the bot out of the virtual playground and into the real world, it has a tendency to fail. Roboticists call this the “sim2real” (simulation to reality) gap, and many a noble robot has fallen into it (and over it, and on it) over the years.\n\nFuture Perfect Explore the big, complicated problems the world faces and the most efficient ways to solve them.

This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.\n\nThe optimistic theory of the case is that, given enough real-world data about movement, the same techniques that have made language models so successful can be used to make robots work well. The most bullish takes on robotics I’ve seen, like this from Anthropic co-founder Jack Clark last year, are based on the idea that if you throw enough data (from stuff like YouTube videos of people walking around, or from actual humans operating the robot with a controller) into well-enough designed and fine-tuned transformer models (using the same learning structure as ChatGPT or Claude etc.), the end result will be a model good enough to govern a robot in the real world.\n\nMaybe! So far we mostly have academic demonstrations rather than the real-world, commercialized products that large language models are today. (Disclosure: Vox Media is one of several publishers that has signed partnership agreements with OpenAI. One of Anthropic’s early investors is James McClave, whose BEMC Foundation helps fund Future Perfect. Our reporting remains editorially independent.)\n\nI don’t know the trajectory of cognitive AI and robotics over the next decade. Maybe, as OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has predicted, this year will “see the first AI agents ‘join the workforce’ and materially change the output of companies” (referring, presumably, to software workers rather than robots). Maybe, as critics argue, the cost of training these models will prove too immense and the companies developing them, which are burning through billions in VC funding, will fail. Maybe robotics will continue to lag, or maybe people will have Rosie from The Jetsons dusting their furniture next year. I have my guesses, but I know enough to know I shouldn’t be too confident.\n\nMy median guess, though, is the world outlined above: language, audiovisual, and otherwise non-physical models continue to make very rapid progress, perhaps becoming capable of doing any fully remote job currently done by humans within the next decade; robotics continues to lag, being very useful in advanced manufacturing but unable to garden or change your sheets or empty your dishwasher. Taken to an extreme, this could look like, in the words of Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei, a “country of geniuses in a datacenter.”\n\nWhat does that world look like?\n\nThe work left for the rest of us\n\nOne of the more useful pieces examining this idea came out in January from Epoch AI, a small research group that’s quickly become the most reliable source of data on cutting-edge AI models. The author, Matthew Barnett, uses a commercially available AI model (GPT-4o) to go through a US Department of Labor-sponsored database of over 19,000 job tasks and categorize each of them as doable remotely (writing code, sending emails) or not doable remotely (firefighting, bowling).\n\nA task, notably, is not the same as a job or occupation. The occupation “journalist” includes specific subtasks like writing emails, composing articles, making phone calls, appearing on panels, reading academic papers, and so on. And an occupation as a whole cannot be automated unless all tasks, or at least all absolutely necessary tasks, can themselves be automated. An AI might be able to do some of the mental labor a surgeon has to perform, for instance, but until it can actually cut and suture a human, the surgeon’s job remains safe.\n\nBarnett finds that 34 percent of tasks can be performed remotely, but only 13 percent of occupations have, as their top five most important subtasks, things that can all be done remotely. Thirteen percent can then serve as an (admittedly very rough) estimate of the share of jobs that could, in principle, be fully automated by a sufficiently advanced cognitive AI.\n\nObviously, a world in which 13 percent of jobs are rapidly automated away is one with pretty massive social disruption. But at first glance, it doesn’t seem too different from what’s been happening in many industries over the past couple of centuries. In 1870, about half of United States workers worked in agriculture. By 1900, a third did. Last year, only 1.4 percent did. The consequence of this is not that Americans starve, but that a vastly more productive, heavily automated farming sector feeds us and lets the other 98.6 percent of the workforce do other work we like more.\n\nSimilarly, manufacturing has become so automated that it now appears global manufacturing employment has peaked — it’s not just that factories use fewer workers in the US compared to poorer countries, but that they use fewer workers everywhere, period.\n\n“There’s an upper bound of how much can be remote, and I think we’re kind of at it now.” — Nicholas Bloom, Stanford University economist and leading expert on remote work\n\nAgriculture and manufacturing are also becoming less important as a share of global economic output over time, not just as shares of employment. So this is one possible future: AI rapidly increases productivity in remote-friendly jobs like software engineering, accounting, and writing for Vox.com, leading to sharp reductions in employment in those sectors. People displaced by this shift gradually shift to harder to automate jobs, becoming masseuses, electricians, nurses, and so forth.\n\nBarnett notes that if this happens, the effect on global economic growth could be massive (maybe a doubling of economic output). It would obviously be inconvenient for me, personally, and I would be sad. But it’s basically “the world now, but moreso” — more economic growth and more labor displacement — rather than a brave new world.\n\nThat said Barnett thinks this is probably underselling what might happen. Yes, automation in agriculture and manufacturing has meant that those sectors gradually decline in importance. That doesn’t have to happen, though. Barnett gives the example of the UK after the invention of spinning jenny and flying shuttle. Those and subsequent cotton-processing technologies massively improved productivity in the textiles industry relative to other sectors of the British economy.\n\nWas the result that textiles became less important? Quite the opposite: The sector exploded, and became vastly more important to the British economy. British exports of textiles increased over sevenfold between the 1740s (when those inventions were just being developed and deployed) and the 1750s, and kept growing exponentially from there.\n\nThe difference between these scenarios is a number that Barnett calls the “elasticity of substitution” — in this case, between remote and in-person work, but in principle between any two kinds of work. For some kinds of work, this number is below 1, meaning that if that work gets much cheaper, it will shrink relative to other kinds of work. The two types of work don’t substitute well for each other, so the elasticity of substitution is low. But if the elasticity is above 1, then the work getting cheaper will become more common and more important.\n\nOne way to think about this, Barnett told me, whether your demand for something can be saturated. “There’s a sense in which your utility from food saturates, because the amount of utility you get from just getting 2,000 calories per day is not half the amount of utility you get from 4,000.” he told me. “Assuming you can live comfortably on 2,000 calories per day, then it’s going to be almost exactly the same amount of utility, because you’re probably gonna throw away a whole bunch of food.”\n\nIt makes sense, then, that agriculture shrank in importance once humanity developed the ability to grow more calories than people needed (the world’s farms currently produce about 3,000 calories per person per day, more than enough to feed every human on the planet by sheer quantity). Manufacturing, too, makes some sense in these terms. Most people hit a limit on how much large manufactured stuff they actually are able to use. My first washing machine helped a lot; getting a third or even a second would be pointless.\n\nBy contrast, the world’s demand for textiles in the 18th century was nowhere near a saturation point. You can, in principle, own a limitless supply of clothes, and especially in the time of hand production, there was lots of pent-up demand, in countries around the world, for fabrics that had previously been prohibitively expensive. That meant that Britain could pour more and more resources into that sector of its economy without having returns diminish too much.\n\nWhat if remote work is more like that?\n\nThis supposition might seem fanciful, but let’s fantasize. If you had an on-call computer programmer who could make your computer work exactly the way you wanted, wouldn’t you have a lot to ask it? If you had a personal animator who could make on-demand episodes of your favorite type of TV show with your favorite music in the background, wouldn’t you call on her a lot?\n\nI have a million deeply weird questions I’m too busy and/or lazy to answer — who invented the “You Can’t Hurry Love” bassline? Why were the witness reports in the Dag Hammarskjold plane crash ignored? — that I wish something smarter than OpenAI Deep Research could give me an answer in seconds. Maybe you would too?\n\nIf that’s the situation, then things look very different. If the elasticity of substitution between remote and non-remote work is 10, Barnett finds, then you see US GDP grow tenfold over a decade, an average growth rate of 25 percent. That is completely unheard of in human history. But it would also be incredibly weird growth, showing up in increased consumption of AI-generated products, rather than, say, easier access to child care or cheaper housing.\n\nNicholas Bloom, the Stanford University economist and leading expert on remote work, is taking the under on this bet. It’s better, he reasons, to think of remote and non-remote work as complements than substitutes, which makes a scenario with high substitution, like Barnett’s fast growth situation, hard to believe.\n\n\n\n“There’s an upper bound of how much can be remote, and I think we’re kind of at it now,” Bloom says. That said, part of Bloom’s skepticism about full-remote work comes from his belief in the importance of mentoring, which is much harder to do in a remote work setup. With AI, presumably the need to mentor in-person becomes moot.\n\nWhat are the most remote-friendly jobs? One can of course reason through which jobs are easy to do remotely (graphic design, telemarketing) and which are impossible (surgery, construction). But is it possible to be more systematic? Several researchers have tried to categorize major occupations as remote-able or not, but I like Matthew Barnett’s approach of simply asking a large language model if certain tasks can be done remotely. Here are some examples of jobs where every single task can be done remotely, per the OpenAI model that Barnett asked (GPT-4o): Bioinformatics scientists\n\nBioinformatics technicians\n\nBusiness continuity planners\n\nBusiness intelligence analysts\n\nClinical data managers\n\nCredit analysts\n\nCredit counselors\n\nCustomer service representatives\n\nData warehousing specialists\n\nDatabase administrators\n\nDatabase architects\n\nEditors\n\nEnvironmental economists\n\nFinancial quantitative analysts\n\nGeographic information systems technologists and technicians\n\nInformation security analysts\n\nInformation technology project managers\n\nInsurance underwriters\n\nMathematicians\n\nPreventive medicine physicians\n\nProofreaders and copy markers\n\nSearch marketing strategists\n\nSecurities, commodities, and financial services sales agents\n\nTelemarketers\n\nTravel agents\n\nVideo game designers\n\nWeb administrators\n\nWeb developers\n\nWriters and authors\n\nHow doomed are remote workers?\n\nBefore getting too carried away, it’s worth remembering — we’re not here, yet. At the very least, an AI remote worker will have to use a computer fluently, and perhaps surprisingly, the best benchmarks we have, like OSWorld, do not show AI models doing that. “The fact is right now that models really suck at navigating browsers,” Jaime Sevilla, who runs the Epoch forecasting group, told me. “They’re not at the level of my grandmother currently.”\n\nSevilla suggested that the pace of investment and progress he’s seeing suggests that we might get grandma-level Chrome usage within a year or two. But it’ll be some time from there to actually using Chrome in an economically useful way, or managing a developer team in Slack, or any number of other specific tasks we expect remote workers to do.\n\nWe’ll also probably learn a great deal about the character of the jobs we’re automating. Tamay Besiroglu, also at Epoch, notes that AI became superhuman at playing chess in 1997, when IBM’s Deep Blue defeated world champion Garry Kasparov. Today the top chess engine, Stockfish, is wildly, wildly better than the top-ranked human player, Magnus Carlsen. But chess is arguably more popular than it’s ever been. Carlsen is a global celebrity with more than 1.4 million subscribers on his YouTube channel, where he streams matches and analyzes games from shows like The Queen’s Gambit. His job has been automated to hell, and he’s a millionaire.\n\n“​​We discovered that, actually, the thing that people pay chess players for isn’t their ability to produce very good chess moves,” Besiroglu concludes. “That’s one thing, but not the entire thing. Things like being entertaining, having charisma, being a good streamer — those things are very important. And we don’t have good benchmarks for how entertaining or charismatic an AI system is.”\n\nTo be fair, Besiroglu expects AI to gain those capabilities in the next five to 10 years. But even if it does, I think it’s plausible that people will still be willing to pay for a connection to a specific human, a connection that AI, by its very nature, cannot fully replace. Magnes Carlsen the chess player can be, and has been automated; it’s less obvious to me that Magnes Carlsen, the influencer, can be automated as well.\n\nSo I’m not hanging up my laptop and giving up just yet. Maybe people will still value human-grown hot takes, the way they value Magnus Carlsen’s human-developed chess style. Or maybe not, in which case, electrician school might start looking better.\n\nBut I keep thinking back to Barnett’s conclusion that human-level cognitive AI could maybe do 13 percent of work out of the box. A world where those are the only jobs that get automated is not a situation where the singularity happens (that is, where AI becomes so good that it is capable of recursively improving itself without human intervention and eventually becomes superhuman in all tasks). But it’s one where society is transformed radically all the same.\n\nWhen I talk to people working in AI, they treat that transformation as nearly inevitable, perhaps a lowball for the changes that might actually be on their way. When I talk to everyone else, I get the sense they have no idea what’s coming.\n\n\n\n",

Joseph Prezioso/AFP/Getty Images\n\nTens of thousands of federal workers have been fired recently, and more may be in danger of being let go.\n\nUmair Irfan — a climate change, energy policy, and science correspondent for Vox — has been specifically focused on layoffs looming over the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) of late. His reporting presents a great lens for understanding the firings, and he and I discussed what the NOAA can tell us about the effect federal reductions have on everyday Americans. Our conversation, edited for length and clarity, is below.\n\nUmair, what’s NOAA and why is it so important?\n\nNOAA is the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. It’s tasked with developing weather forecasts for the United States, conducting oceanographic and atmospheric research, and developing long-term climate and weather models. It’s also in charge of fisheries and promoting commerce, particularly in the oceans, which means it does a lot of navigation and mapping work for shipping, and for offshore oil and gas drilling.\n\nThere have been reports that as much as half of NOAA staff might be dismissed. What would everyday Americans lose if that happened?\n\nNOAA has a staff of about 12,000 people, most of them scientists and engineers. If you lost half of that, you’d lose a lot of people doing the research that informs our weather forecasts and our understanding of weather, as well as a lot of the data that industry players rely on for things like aviation and air travel. We’d also lose a lot of our emergency forecasting capability for extreme weather.\n\nNOAA is one of the reasons that air travel is so safe, and one of the reasons that we’ve seen fewer people dying in natural disasters in the US: It has done the work of putting satellites into space, of having scientific ships on the ocean, and aircraft that fly into hurricanes, and has used its decades of data gathering to develop excellent forecasting capability — and one that, through continual work, is improving all the time.\n\nIf we lose all those capabilities, we lose a lot of progress that has been made. Extreme weather will stay dangerous, however, and our ability to drive the risks involved with weather down over time will eventually diminish if we don’t continue to invest in that.\n\nNOAA obviously isn’t the only agency that’s facing cuts here. Do Americans gain anything by shrinking the government the way Trump has been?\n\nCurrent and former agency staffers and leaders I talked to say the cuts aren’t going to help agencies accomplish their missions, and will actually run counter to any goals of efficiency, because remaining employees will have to try to fulfill the functions of their fired colleagues in suboptimal ways.\n\nThat said, there’s always going to be room to optimize a big institution like the government. But we need to do so thoughtfully, stepping back and seeing what our needs are, and what our expectations are from government in general.\n\nSpecifically looking at an agency like NOAA, it’s about looking carefully at exactly how its core functions are being met, where they’re falling short, and where they can be augmented. So far, we really haven’t seen that level of exploration and interest in how these agencies function from the current administration.\n\nBig picture, what do you think Americans should learn from the case of NOAA?\n\nI think it’s easy to forget that the federal government is everywhere in our country — 80 percent of federal employees are not in DC.\n\nNOAA is one of those agencies that has a very far-flung footprint, because it has to do a lot of the local research and data gathering on site, and because its mission is to protect the whole country.\n\nAnd NOAA, like all agencies, is very closely linked to people’s lives in ways they may not expect. You may not have a NOAA app on your phone, but very likely the weather app you do have, and the forecast that you’re getting from your local TV meteorologist, are informed by NOAA’s satellites and data gathering.\n\nWhile there may be layers in between the products you consume and the government, it does provide the foundation for things we take for granted. If agencies like NOAA go away, we would definitely lose things we might not expect.\n\nRelated Elon Musk is coming for our weather service",

She writes primarily about the future of consciousness, tracking advances in artificial intelligence and neuroscience and their staggering ethical implications. Before joining Vox, Sigal was the religion editor at the Atlantic.\n\nThe AI world is moving so fast that it’s easy to get lost amid the flurry of shiny new products. OpenAI announces one, then the Chinese startup DeepSeek releases one, then OpenAI immediately puts out another one. Each is important, but focus too much on any one of them and you’ll miss the really big story of the past six months.\n\nThe big story is: AI companies now claim that their models are capable of genuine reasoning — the type of thinking you and I do when we want to solve a problem.\n\nAnd the big question is: Is that true?\n\nThe stakes are high, because the answer will inform how everyone from your mom to your government should — and should not — turn to AI for help.\n\nIf you’ve played around with ChatGPT, you know that it was designed to spit out quick answers to your questions. But state-of-the-art “reasoning models” — like OpenAI’s o1 or DeepSeek’s r1 — are designed to “think” a while before responding, by breaking down big problems into smaller problems and trying to solve them step by step. The industry calls that “chain-of-thought reasoning.”\n\nThese models are yielding some very impressive results. They can solve tricky logic puzzles, ace math tests, and write flawless code on the first try. Yet they also fail spectacularly on really easy problems.\n\nAI experts are torn over how to interpret this. Skeptics take it as evidence that “reasoning” models aren’t really reasoning at all. Believers insist that the models genuinely are doing some reasoning, and though it may not currently be as flexible as a human’s reasoning, it’s well on its way to getting there.\n\nSo, who’s right?\n\nThe best answer will be unsettling to both the hard skeptics of AI and the true believers.\n\nWhat counts as reasoning?\n\nLet’s take a step back. What exactly is reasoning, anyway?\n\nAI companies like OpenAI are using the term reasoning to mean that their models break down a problem into smaller problems, which they tackle step by step, ultimately arriving at a better solution as a result.\n\nFuture Perfect Explore the big, complicated problems the world faces and the most efficient ways to solve them.

Although scientists are still trying to understand how reasoning works in the human brain — nevermind in AI — they agree that there are actually lots of different types of reasoning.\n\nThere’s deductive reasoning, where you start with a general statement and use it to reach a specific conclusion. There’s inductive reasoning, where you use specific observations to make a broader generalization. And there’s analogical reasoning, causal reasoning, common sense reasoning … suffice it to say, reasoning is not just one thing!\n\nNow, if someone comes up to you with a hard math problem and gives you a chance to break it down and think about it step by step, you’ll do a lot better than if you have to blurt out the answer off the top of your head. So, being able to do deliberative “chain-of-thought reasoning” is definitely helpful, and it might be a necessary ingredient of getting anything really difficult done. Yet it’s not the whole of reasoning.\n\nOne feature of reasoning that we care a lot about in the real world is the ability to suss out “a rule or pattern from limited data or experience and to apply this rule or pattern to new, unseen situations,” writes Melanie Mitchell, a professor at the Santa Fe Institute, together with her co-authors in a paper on AI’s reasoning abilities. “Even very young children are adept at learning abstract rules from just a few examples.”\n\nIn other words, a toddler can generalize. Can an AI?\n\nA lot of the debate turns around this question. Skeptics are very, well, skeptical of AI’s ability to generalize. They think something else is going on.\n\nThe skeptic’s case\n\n“It’s a kind of meta-mimicry,” Shannon Vallor, a philosopher of technology at the University of Edinburgh, told me when OpenAI’s o1 came out in September.\n\nShe meant that while an older model like ChatGPT mimics the human-written statements in its training data, a newer model like o1 mimics the process that humans engage in to come up with those statements. In other words, she believes, it’s not truly reasoning. It would be pretty easy for o1 to just make it sound like it’s reasoning; after all, its training data is rife with examples of that, from doctors analyzing symptoms to decide on a diagnosis to judges evaluating evidence to arrive at a verdict.\n\nBesides, when OpenAI built the o1 model, it made some changes from the previous ChatGPT model but did not dramatically overhaul the architecture — and ChatGPT was flubbing easy questions last year, like answering a question about how to get a man and a goat across a river in a totally ridiculous way. So why, Vallor asked, would we think o1 is doing something totally new and magical — especially given that it, too, flubs easy questions? “In the cases where it fails, you see what, for me, is compelling evidence that it’s not reasoning at all,” she said.\n\nMitchell was surprised at how well o3 — OpenAI’s newest reasoning model, announced at the end of last year as a successor to o1 — performed on tests. But she was also surprised at just how much computation it used to solve the problems. We don’t know what it’s doing with all that computation, because OpenAI is not transparent about what’s going on under the hood.\n\n“I’ve actually done my own experiments on people where they’re thinking out loud about these problems, and they don’t think out loud for, you know, hours of computation time,” she told me. “They just say a couple sentences and then say, ‘Yeah, I see how it works,’ because they’re using certain kinds of concepts. I don’t know if o3 is using those kinds of concepts.”\n\nWithout greater transparency from the company, Mitchell said we can’t be sure that the model is breaking down a big problem into steps and getting a better overall answer as a result of that approach, as OpenAI claims.\n\nShe pointed to a paper, “Let’s Think Dot by Dot,” where researchers did not get a model to break down a problem into intermediate steps; instead, they just told the model to generate dots. Those dots were totally meaningless — what the paper’s authors call “filler tokens.” But it turned out that just having additional tokens there allowed the model more computational capacity, and it could use that extra computation to solve problems better. That suggests that when a model generates intermediate steps — whether it’s a phrase like “let’s think about this step by step” or just “....” — those steps don’t necessarily mean it’s doing the human-like reasoning you think it’s doing.\n\n“I think a lot of what it’s doing is more like a bag of heuristics than a reasoning model,” Mitchell told me. A heuristic is a mental shortcut — something that often lets you guess the right answer to a problem, but not by actually thinking it through.\n\nHere’s a classic example: Researchers trained an AI vision model to analyze photos for skin cancer. It seemed, at first blush, like the model was genuinely figuring out if a mole is malignant. But it turned out the photos of malignant moles in its training data often contained a ruler, so the model had just learned to use the presence of a ruler as a heuristic for deciding on malignancy.\n\nSkeptical AI researchers think that state-of-the-art models may be doing something similar: They appear to be “reasoning” their way through, say, a math problem, but really they’re just drawing on a mix of memorized information and heuristics.\n\nThe believer’s case\n\nOther experts are more bullish on reasoning models. Ryan Greenblatt, chief scientist at Redwood Research, a nonprofit that aims to mitigate risks from advanced AI, thinks these models are pretty clearly doing some form of reasoning.\n\n“They do it in a way that doesn’t generalize as well as the way humans do it — they’re relying more on memorization and knowledge than humans do — but they’re still doing the thing,” Greenblatt said. “It’s not like there’s no generalization at all.”\n\nAfter all, these models have been able to solve hard problems beyond the examples they’ve been trained on — often very impressively. For Greenblatt, the simplest explanation as to how is that they are indeed doing some reasoning.\n\nAnd the point about heuristics can cut both ways, whether we’re talking about a reasoning model or an earlier model like ChatGPT. Consider the “a man, a boat, and a goat” prompt that had many skeptics mocking OpenAI last year:\n\nWhat’s going on here? Greenblatt says the model messed up because this prompt is actually a classic logic puzzle that dates back centuries and that would have appeared many times in the training data. In some formulations of the river-crossing puzzle, a farmer with a wolf, a goat, and a cabbage must cross over by boat. The boat can only carry the farmer and a single item at a time — but if left together, the wolf will eat the goat or the goat will eat the cabbage, so the challenge is to get everything across without anything getting eaten. That explains the model’s mention of a cabbage in its response. The model would instantly “recognize” the puzzle.\n\n“My best guess is that the models have this incredibly strong urge to be like, ‘Oh, it’s this puzzle! I know what this puzzle is! I should do this because that performed really well in the training data.’ It’s like a learned heuristic,” Greenblatt said. The implication? “It’s not that it can’t solve it. In a lot of these cases, if you say it’s a trick question, and then you give the question, the model often does totally fine.”\n\nHumans fail in the same way all the time, he pointed out. If you’d just spent a month studying color theory — from complementary colors to the psychological effects of different hues to the historical significance of certain pigments in Renaissance paintings — and then got a quiz asking, “Why did the artist paint the sky blue in this landscape painting?”... well, you might be tricked into writing a needlessly complicated answer! Maybe you’d write about how the blue represents the divine heavens, or how the specific shade suggests the painting was done in the early morning hours which symbolizes rebirth … when really, the answer is simply: Because the sky is blue!\n\nAjeya Cotra, a senior analyst at Open Philanthropy who researches the risks from AI, agrees with Greenblatt on that point. And, she said of the latest models, “I think they’re genuinely getting better at this wide range of tasks that humans would call reasoning tasks.”\n\nShe doesn’t dispute that the models are doing some meta-mimicry. But when skeptics say “it’s just doing meta-mimicry,” she explained, “I think the ‘just’ part of it is the controversial part. It feels like what they’re trying to imply often is ‘and therefore it’s not going to have a big impact on the world’ or ‘and therefore artificial superintelligence is far away’ — and that’s what I dispute.”\n\nTo see why, she said, imagine you’re teaching a college physics class. You’ve got different types of students. One is an outright cheater: He just looks in the back of the book for the answers and then writes them down. Another student is such a savant that he doesn’t even need to think about the equations; he understands the physics on such a deep, intuitive, Einstein-like level that he can derive the right equations on the fly. All the other students are somewhere in the middle: They’ve memorized a list of 25 equations and are trying to figure out which equation to apply in which situation.\n\nLike the majority of students, AI models are pairing some memorization with some reasoning, Cotra told me.\n\n“The AI models are like a student that is not very bright but is superhumanly diligent, and so they haven’t just memorized 25 equations, they’ve memorized 500 equations, including ones for weird situations that could come up,” she said. They’re pairing a lot of memorization with a little bit of reasoning — that is, with figuring out what combination of equations to apply to a problem. “And that just takes you very far! They seem at first glance as impressive as the person with the deep intuitive understanding.”\n\nOf course, when you look harder, you can still find holes that their 500 equations just happen not to cover. But that doesn’t mean zero reasoning has taken place.\n\nIn other words, the models are neither exclusively reasoning nor exclusively just reciting.\n\n“It’s somewhere in between,” Cotra said. “I think people are thrown off by that because they want to put it in one camp or another. They want to say it’s just memorizing or they want to say it’s truly deeply reasoning. But the fact is, there’s just a spectrum of the depth of reasoning.”\n\nAI systems have “jagged intelligence”\n\nResearchers have come up with a buzzy term to describe this pattern of reasoning: “jagged intelligence.” It refers to the strange fact that, as computer scientist Andrej Karpathy explained, state-of-the-art AI models “can both perform extremely impressive tasks (e.g., solve complex math problems) while simultaneously struggling with some very dumb problems.”\n\nDrew Shannon for Vox\n\nPicture it like this. If human intelligence looks like a cloud with softly rounded edges, artificial intelligence is like a spiky cloud with giant peaks and valleys right next to each other. In humans, a lot of problem-solving capabilities are highly correlated with each other, but AI can be great at one thing and ridiculously bad at another thing that (to us) doesn’t seem far apart.\n\nMind you, it’s all relative.\n\n“Compared to what humans are good at, the models are quite jagged,” Greenblatt told me. “But I think indexing on humans is a little confusing. From the model’s perspective, it’s like, ‘Wow, those humans are so jagged! They’re so bad at next-token prediction!’ It’s not clear that there’s some objective sense in which AI is more jagged.”\n\nThe fact that reasoning models are trained to sound like humans reasoning makes us disposed to compare AI intelligence to human intelligence. But the best way to think of AI is probably not as “smarter than a human” or “dumber than a human” but just as “different.”\n\nRegardless, Cotra anticipates that sooner or later AI intelligence will be so vast that it can contain within it all of human intelligence, and then some.\n\n“I think about, what are the risks that emerge when AI systems are truly better than human experts at everything? When they might still be jagged, but their full jagged intelligence encompasses all of human intelligence and more?” she said. “I’m always looking ahead to that point in time and preparing for that.”\n\nFor now, the practical upshot for most of us is this: Remember what AI is and isn’t smart at — and use it accordingly.\n\nThe best use case is a situation where it’s hard for you to come up with a solution, but once you get a solution from the AI you can easily check to see if it’s correct. Writing code is a perfect example. Another example would be making a website: You can see what the AI produced and, if you don’t like it, just get the AI to redo it.\n\nIn other domains — especially ones where there is no objective right answer or where the stakes are high — you’ll want to be more hesitant about using AI.

        "source": "https://www.vox.com/",
        "content": "is a senior correspondent and editor for Vox’s Future Perfect, covering global health. He has reported on health policy for more than 10 years, writing for Governing magazine, Talking Points Memo, and STAT before joining Vox in 2017.\n\nPeople have known for centuries that drinking too much alcohol is bad for you. The short-term physical effects on cognition and motor function speak for themselves. The longer-term physical consequences of abusing alcohol — liver damage, jaundice, and cancer — have long been impossible to ignore.\n\nSo why, in that case, has there been a widespread belief, even among many physicians, that moderate drinking might actually be good for you?\n\nWe can thank the so-called French paradox for this. In the early 1990s, French scientist Serge Renaud concluded that the French had low rates of cardiovascular disease despite their affinity for fatty foods like beef and cheese because they otherwise adhere to a healthy Mediterranean diet — and because they consumed “moderate” amounts of red wine. Scientists have theorized that the antioxidants in red wine could play a role in reducing cholesterol, for example.\n\nSubsequent studies appeared to affirm the correlation, strengthening the belief among the general public about the benefits of red wine. But over the past decade, new studies and public health warnings have called that conventional wisdom into question, stating emphatically that no level of alcohol consumption could be considered safe — much less beneficial.\n\nAlcohol after all, absolutely is a toxin, and has long been recognized by experts, if not the broader public, as a carcinogen, after all.\n\nSince many people enjoy alcohol to some extent, says Timothy Naimi, director of the University of Victoria’s Canadian Institute for Substance Use Research, “there’s been a far more relaxed scientific standard.” “We all love studies that show, ‘oh, sex makes us live longer, or coffee is good for us, or chocolate is good for us.’ There is this irresistible idea.”\n\nScience has clearly established that excessive drinking is bad for you. But what remains confusing, especially with the steady stream of new studies that sometimes seem to contradict each other, is how bad moderate drinking is — and what “moderate” even means. Here’s what we actually know.\n\n“Moderate” drinking is elusive — and it’s very easy to drink too much\n\nOne of the most important things to understand about drinking and its health effects is what amount of alcohol is actually considered to be excessive. It is a common trope among doctors and alcohol researchers that people misunderstand what moderate drinking means.\n\n“None of us like to think of ourselves as drinking to excess, right?” Naimi said. “Who among us wants to think of ourselves as immoderate? Of course, we’re all moderate drinkers.”\n\nDiners in Paris. Corbis/VCG via Getty Images\n\nEven if we agree in colloquial terms that “one drink a night” is moderate, the details matter. Medical science has far more precise definitions for what constitutes a “drink” than the average person pouring themselves a glass of Chablis. One 12-ounce can of 5-percent alcohol beer, a 5-ounce glass of wine with 12-percent alcohol, or a 1.5-ounce glass of 80-proof liquor are all what constitutes a “standard drink.” So when we pour an extra-large glass of wine at night, we may consider it only one drink, but a doctor sees two or even three. The kind of beer or wine matters too: Your favorite 9 percent IPA is actually closer to two drinks than it is to one, according to medical definition.\n\nPeople today are considered by the medical establishment to be heavy drinkers if, by these definitions, they consume more than 15 drinks in a week for men or more than eight drinks for women. (You are considered to have alcohol use disorder if you have tried to stop drinking in the past year but failed, have alcohol cravings, or believe drinking interferes with your life. It’s less about specific amounts.)\n\nBelow that threshold, based on these scientific standards, you might consider yourself to be a so-called moderate drinker.\n\nThis reflects a lot of progress in our understanding of problematic drinking. For centuries, people have known that excessive drinking could damage the liver, cause long-term health problems, and lead to alcohol dependence. The US temperance movement of the 1800s and early 1900s sought to eradicate those personal and social harms and briefly succeeded in outlawing alcohol during the Prohibition era.\n\nBut, as the failure of Prohibition attests, drinking is deeply embedded in our society. Some popular historians like to say that alcohol (along with caffeine) helped define human civilization. There may even be an evolutionary angle: Many animals consume alcohol (called ethanol when it is encountered naturally). Perhaps it’s because finding fruit with some fermented ethanol means you’re good at finding fruit, period — a natural advantage for survival. That is how deeply rooted our ancestral relationship to alcohol might be.\n\nEven today, one of the biggest challenges in trying to convince people to drink less is the fact that so much of our collective social calendar is scheduled around drinking — let’s go to happy hour or grab some drinks for the big game, for example. Given the seemingly implacability of social drinking, the focus for a long time has been trying to reduce the kind of habitual, excessive drinking that we have historically called alcoholism.\n\nAnd there was some progress made: Americans collectively report consuming less alcohol than they did in the 1970s and ’80s. Today, an estimated 10 percent of Americans 12 and older are classified as having alcohol use disorder, a number that has stayed fairly stable over the past decade. There is even evidence that younger people are drinking less than millennials or Gen X.\n\nAt the same time, however, alcohol-related deaths have been increasing, rising by 70 percent from 2012 to 2022, even with a definition of alcohol-related deaths that is limited to liver disease, poisoning and accidents. The actual count, when considering deaths to which alcohol was at least a contributor, such as cancer in heavy drinkers, is more difficult to quantify but likely much higher. A 2024 estimate by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention put the number at 178,000 deaths attributable to alcohol overuse annually in the US.\n\nThese seemingly contradictory trends — stable rates of alcoholism, but increasing deaths — could be explained by a few things. For one, alcohol use disorder is likely underdiagnosed. Second, “heavy” drinkers may not be alcoholics, but they can still feel the negative health effects of their alcohol use.\n\nAnd then there is an issue that has been worrying doctors for years: binge drinking, usually defined as consuming four (for women) or five (for men) drinks in two hours or less. You may not necessarily be considered an alcoholic if you binge-drink; you may not even be a heavy drinker much of the time. But even more limited episodes of such intense drinking can do serious damages; the immediate risk is death from an accident or alcohol poisoning, but repeated binge drinking raises the risk of longer-term consequences.\n\nPut it all together and what’s become clear is that more people’s health is being put at risk by their alcohol use than was previously realized. And that means even people whose drinking is considered socially acceptable need to be aware of the threats it poses to their health.\n\nIs any level of drinking safe or even beneficial?\n\nOnce you are having more than two drinks a day if you’re a man or one drink a day if you’re a woman, pretty much every researcher agrees that the health risks warrant trying to cut back. But the consensus fractures below that.\n\nIf we imagine the conversation about alcohol’s health effects as a football field, the consensus covers 95 yards of the 100-yard field — almost all the way to the goal of general unanimity. We all agree heavy drinking is bad, but the fight remains on the issue — the remaining five yards — of whether light drinking is truly bad and that is still being debated.\n\nBut a quarter century after that conventional wisdom about red wine benefitting the human heart really took hold, a growing number of public health organizations and researchers started to aggressively dispute the idea that moderate alcohol consumption could be “safe” or beneficial.\n\n“All of the arguing in the past 20 years has been around the health effects of very, very small amounts of alcohol,” Naimi said. “But I don’t think that other than small amounts of alcohol, there’s any question that alcohol consumption is a leading and preventable cause of health and social problems in the US.”\n\nOne of the biggest challenges in trying to convince people to drink less is the fact that so much of our collective social calendar is scheduled around drinking. Eric Baradat/AFP via Getty Images\n\nOne watershed moment was a 2017 publication from the American Society of Clinical Oncology that established that even modest drinking could increase a person’s risk of developing cancer.\n\nThe ASCO was alarmed by surveys that found only one in three Americans knew about the finding decades after medical literature had documented a link between, for example, alcohol use and breast cancer. And with its report, the group aimed to increase awareness among the public that alcohol is a carcinogen and advocate for specific policy strategies to try to reduce excessive alcohol use.\n\nAnother meta-analysis, also published in 2017, examined prior research alleging positive cardiovascular effects from moderate alcohol consumption. This analysis, which Naimi co-authored, found possible statistical errors and other countervailing factors in the earlier studies that appeared to support the French paradox’s framework. For example, moderate wine drinkers tend to be more moderate in general, more active, and in better overall health — all of which could help explain their better health outcomes, without alcohol factoring into it.\n\nAdditionally, some of the apparent abstainers studied in the various observational studies of alcohol use and health outcomes may be former drinkers who could still feel the health effects years later, which would explain the finding that some moderate drinkers live longer than both non-drinkers and heavy drinkers. More recent studies with more rigorous statistical randomization reported that “alcohol consumption of all amounts was associated with increased cardiovascular risk,” with the risk increasing with every drink.\n\nIn 2022, the World Health Organization took an even stronger position, stating that “no level of alcohol consumption is safe for our health” based on available evidence. As they put it, one’s risk appears to increase “from the first drop.” The board of scientists who advise the US government on diet guidelines, too, has advised that the guidance reduce the maximum recommended drinks for men from two to one daily, for example. Their input hasn’t yet been incorporated into the final federal dietary guidelines.\n\nAt the same time, you still have studies that came out in the past decade that acknowledged the cancer risks but continued to report cardiovascular benefits and a possible reduction in the risk of diabetes with modest drinking. Some research suggests that adhering to certain patterns — such as spacing your weekly allotment of drinks out over a few days and consuming them with a meal — may be beneficial. It’s understandable that people are confused.\n\nHere’s what you should know: This is really hard to study. We are mostly relying on observational data, not randomized controlled experiments, which could be compromised by all kinds of confounding factors. In an ideal world, you could compare two groups of people who are alike, except one drinks and the other doesn’t, for life. But in practice, that’s very difficult to do.\n\nIndustry influence has shaped our ideas about alcohol consumption Our ability to make sense of all of the confusing science around drinking is further complicated by the influence of the alcohol industry, which airs advertising campaigns with messages like “drink responsibly” that reinforce the idea that a certain level of drinking can be responsible. The industry also lobbies lawmakers to stymie any attempt to place new restrictions, requirements or taxes on them. One attempt to stand up a randomized alcohol study, which was to be overseen by Kenneth Mukamal of Harvard, was shut down in 2018 because the alcohol industry had provided improper input on the study.\n\nAll of the researchers I spoke to acknowledged the challenge in substantiating alcohol’s effects, positive or negative, but again: Alcohol is a carcinogen; no one needs a randomized control trial to know that, it’s been the international consensus for decades.\n\nThere’s a reckoning with alcohol right now, which can leave people feeling unmoored. But all of this noise obscures the simple way to synthesize all of this: Less is better.\n\n“I think for people that are light drinkers, they probably don’t need to put a ton of brain space here,” Noelle LoConte, who co-authored the ASCO’s 2017 statement on alcohol and cancer, told me.\n\nIf you want to drink less but not abstain completely, there are some obvious things you can do. Don’t pour too much wine in that glass. Maybe skip the 10 percent double IPA. In my own life, I have moderated my drinking by limiting myself to at most two nights per week and at most two drinks per night. I still get to enjoy my coveted Cabernet once in a while, but having some loose rules for myself has made it easier to reduce my intake.\n\n“The people who have one drink with dinner or two drinks with dinner, I think it’s exactly the right way to do it; that’s the right way to calibrate it,” Kenneth Mukamal, a Harvard doctor who authored several of the studies finding some cardiovascular benefits to moderate alcohol consumption, said. “You should have it with food. You should have it with friends and have it in a way that you’re naturally limited in how much you’re going to drink.”\n\nIt is also getting easier — and less awkward — to not drink at all if that’s your preference or you simply want to make a change. The nonalcoholic drink market is flourishing, with better and better options coming to bars and restaurants. It should be more socially accepted not to drink, as fewer people do.",

        "content": "is a senior correspondent who explains what society obsesses over, from Marvel and movies to fitness and skin care. He came to Vox in 2014. Prior to that, he worked at the Atlantic.\n\nIn a show full of unlikable people, it takes a special character to be the absolute, no-contest worst of the bunch. On White Lotus’s season three, it’s without a doubt Greg (Jon Gries) a.k.a. Gary a.k.a. the not-so-grieving widower of season one and two’s Tanya McQuoid (Jennifer Coolidge).\n\nIn a bit of a twist, Greg is the only character to appear on all three seasons of White Lotus, as he was reintroduced to viewers in the first episode of season three. Technically, he’s not a guest at the resort. Having inherited Tanya’s giant fortune, Greg now owns a luxurious house steps away from the White Lotus in Thailand. He’s also dating a model named Chloe (Charlotte Le Bon) who slightly resents him, and is dating him for his wealth — not unlike his own relationship to Tanya. He’s also going by the alias Gary, presumably because law enforcement is looking at Greg as a suspicious person in Tanya’s death.\n\nWhite Lotus is an anthology series, following a different group of appalling rich people around a different lavish resort each season for a vacation that inevitably ends in someone’s death. Although the show has seen some characters return — namely Tanya and Belinda (Natasha Rothwell), the saintly White Lotus Hawaii staffer who Tanya plied with promises of her own spa in season one — it hasn’t seemed to have (or been billed as having) a throughline narrative, until now.\n\nThe problem for “Gary” is that Belinda just so happens to be at the Thai resort as part of an exchange program. She finally recognized Greg in episode three, but while she knew that he distracted their mutual patron from funding Belinda’s dream of owning her own business, she didn’t yet know about Tanya’s untimely demise — or Greg’s role in it. (Quick refresh: Greg employed a coterie of scamming homosexuals to have his wife killed, but ultimately she smacked her own head on the side of a boat while trying to jump to safety.) He denied they’d ever met (he’s Gary after all), but in the season’s fourth episode, Belinda is up to speed thanks to a quick Google, and terrified. So is Greg. If Belinda exchanges enough information with authorities, she could shatter everything he worked to hide!\n\nEpisode four picks up after Greg and Belinda’s face-to-face. He has a boat party to begrudgingly host, and she’s preparing for her son’s arrival. But they can’t stop thinking of each other (negatively) and seem to be on a collision course. Now it seems more and more likely that the man who appeared to be nothing more than a side character/love interest in season one has, this whole time, been taking White Lotus fans on the familiar arc of a true crime romance scammer: seduction, violence, and the desperate struggle to not get caught.\n\nThe customary White Lotus boat trip\n\nAs certain that the sun will rise tomorrow, the characters on White Lotus will get on a boat and have an awful time. In season one, Tanya scattered her mother’s ashes in the Pacific Ocean (or attempted to) with newlyweds Rachel (Alexandra D’Addario) and Shane (Jake Lacy) along for the ride. In season two, Tanya again found herself on a ship in the Mediterranean where she accidentally died after killing the rich gay guys who were trying to murder her. And, in season three, episode four, the White Lotus Thailand’s guests are at sea once more.\n\nWith (presumably) Tanya’s money, Greg has procured a yacht, and at Chloe’s behest invited the Ratliff family — parents, children, and lorazepam stash — as well as Chelsea (Aimee Lou Wood) and Rick (Walton Goggins) all spend a day aboard.\n\nTechnically they’re all Greg’s guests. But most everyone, including Greg, seems a bit miserable.\n\nThe ship is full of older men and their much younger female company. As Chloe says, these old bald guys are all the same. Even on open water with champagne flowing, tension — missing pills, inappropriate flirting, wrong-headed revenge plots, and some previous antipathy between the Ratliffs and the incredibly nervy Rick — is unavoidable. It all goes back to the idea that no matter how rich you are and how many things you buy to throw at your problems, you can still absolutely hate the life you have.\n\nEveryone on this super yacht is miserable! Courtesy of Fabio Lovino/HBO\n\nAt the bar, Tim Ratliff (Jason Isaacs), the rapidly unspooling South Carolina businessman loaded on his wife’s lorazepam and many, many midday drinks, wants to know about Greg’s life in Thailand. When Tim asks if he likes it, Greg tells him, “I never want to leave.” That could be true, but with the police on the lookout, he also never can.\n\n“Just heard someone say that anyone who moves to Thailand is either looking for something or hiding for something,” Tim slurs.\n\n“Neither,” Greg tells him, “I just got sick of the rat race.”\n\nGreg is in a race of his own now, though. Finding him sitting alone on the upper deck, Chloe asks if she can take the boat to a different island to celebrate an upcoming full moon party. The man she calls Gary tells her she can take the boat without him, and she doesn’t seem to care when he tells her, “There’s something I gotta deal with at home.”\n\nThe “something” is Belinda.\n\nBack on land, Belinda spots Greg talking to the hotel’s grinning manager. From the look in his eye, she can’t help but assume it’s her. She and Greg make brief eye contact. Later, in the sleek home Tanya’s fortune bought, Greg looks at Belinda’s Instagram, examining pictures of her and her son.\n\nGiven what we know about Greg’s history of grifting and Tanya’s eventual demise, it certainly can’t be good for Belinda to be in his crosshairs.\n\nIs Greg going to kill Belinda?\n\nWith Belinda knowing who Greg is and Greg knowing that Belinda knows about him and Tanya, it raises a very obvious question: Is Greg going to kill Belinda? And further, is Belinda the mystery person who dies in episode one?\n\nMany signs point to yes. Belinda seems to be the only person in Thailand who knows that Greg isn’t Gary. Even if Belinda is intent on keeping quiet, Greg doesn’t know that. It would seem like this man, who has no qualms about grifting and murder-for-hire, wouldn’t think twice about finding a way to silence Belinda for good. That’s as clear a motive as we see on the show.\n\nBut there’s one absolutely huge reason why he’s not the killer stalking the resort in the season opener — shooting and killing Belinda wouldn’t be his MO or beneficial to his endgame.\n\nThe murder that we get a glimpse of in the beginning of the season is just too blatant for Greg to be the killer. The man is wanted in Italy, and the last thing he wants to do is draw even more attention himself. You know what draws attention? Repeatedly and wildly firing a gun at a luxury resort full of the richest people on earth. There’s a higher chance of Belinda using the gun in some kind of self-defense than Greg shooting her.\n\nGreg has also proven himself to be the type of guy who would not do the murdering himself. Back in season two when he went to Italy with Tanya, Greg actually left Tanya and let the “evil gays” (one of whom Greg had a previous relationship with) toy around with her. If Greg is going to off Belinda, he’s going to figure out a way to do it without being directly involved.\n\nNo doubt, the tension between Belinda and Greg is going to drive the rest of the season. She’s going to be cautious around him. He’s going to want to keep her close, close enough to sniff out how much she knows and whether or not she’ll snitch.\n\nWhat’s fascinating here is what a turn this is for the show, which usually tells contained stories.\n\nWhite Lotus has always been a work made up of closely observed character study (please see this season’s three quietly warring white women who have been friends since childhood). Since his first appearance in season one, though, Greg has been more than a bit of a cipher. He’s taciturn, he’s reserved. Yes, he’s angry, as he proved in season two when Tanya brought her assistant Portia (Haley Lu Richardson) along on vacation, but he’s fairly unknowable. We think he likes fly-fishing, and we’re pretty sure he worked at the Bureau of Land Management. What exactly was his relationship with Quentin (Tom Hollander)? Did he ever really have cancer, as he claimed when he met Tanya in Maui?\n\nBelinda is doing what any normal nosy person would do… Courtesy of Fabio Lovino/HBO\n\nGreg also doesn’t neatly fit into the show’s class criticism. So many characters on the show are cartoonish, exaggerated versions of the one percent. They get away with spoiled entitlement, and impose themselves on places where common people are shut out. Greg’s grift feels slightly different, but maybe more egregious — here’s a thief who is worse than the rich he’s stealing from. Arranging Tanya’s death and getting away with her fortune feels unjust.\n\nWhite Lotus is a show about personal unravelings, what these affluent people really look like when their money can’t buy what they really need. But Greg is wound tight. He may be more desperate than ever, but there is no true sense of who this man is.",

Waiting in line for rides, I’d been checking my phone reflexively, tapping app icons. Like many distracted parents, this triggered a pang of guilt that I was looking at a screen instead of being more present for my little one. I do it at home, too, and I’d like to stop.\n\nIronic that I was distracted once again by a notification telling me to look at my phone in order to learn how to look at my phone less.\n\nScreen time reports — the weekly roundups of time spent on various apps that Apple and Google send its users — are a cornerstone of digital wellness, a concept that’s been around for over a decade. To some, digital wellness might mean simply using their phone less, and to others, it might mean cutting down on distractions, like unwanted notifications.\n\nUser Friendly A weekly dispatch to make sure tech is working for you, instead of overwhelming you.

This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.\n\nFollowing some public backlash about how smartphones were exacerbating mental health issues for young people, Apple and Google gave people additional tools to track and restrict their device usage. In 2018, Apple announced Screen Time, and Google launched its Digital Wellbeing features for Android. These settings were essentially adult versions of existing features that let parents limit their children’s devices, including setting time limits on certain apps. In effect, you could now parent yourself when it comes to digital wellness.\n\nIt’s been seven years now, and I’m not sure I feel digitally well.\n\nIt’s been seven years now, and I’m not sure I feel digitally well. While I’ve experimented with a combination of hacks in my phone’s accessibility settings and tinkered with third-party apps that nudge my behavior away from bad habits, like many people, I still look at my phone more than I’d like to. And I still ended up being that dad at Disney World checking my notifications.\n\nThere is one thing that has helped my phone habits, however. I made my home screen as boring as I could. And when that doesn’t work, I just leave it behind.\n\nScreen time has always been a poor metric\n\nThe mission of digital wellness tools from Apple and Google has always seemed confused. After all, it’s counterintuitive that tech companies would release a set of features designed to make you use their products less. Apple and Google don’t actually want you to put your phone down. They just want you to like them.\n\nAbout a decade ago, a wave of anxiety that smartphones were damaging our brains and, especially, our children’s brains hit the tech industry. In a 2017 Atlantic article, psychologist Jean Twenge asked if smartphones had “destroyed a generation.” The following year, two prominent Wall Street investors asked Apple to study how its products were affecting our health. Screen Time was the company’s answer. Google launched its Digital Wellbeing tools around the same time. Many social media apps, including Instagram, TikTok, and YouTube, now offer features like these, too, usually in the form of parental controls.\n\n3 easy things to do Nobody should feel helpless in our app-saturated world. But you can update a few simple settings to make your phone less habit-forming. Tristan Harris, co-founder of the Center for Humane Technology, offered three tips in a 2018 Vox video that still make sense today: Turn off all nonhuman notifications Make your screen grayscale Restrict your home screen to essential, everyday tools\n\nApple’s Screen Time reports show you some basic stats: total screen time, time spent on individual apps, the number of times you picked up your phone, and total notifications. You can also set time limits for apps as well as downtime, so that only certain apps are available for a period of time. Google’s Digital Wellbeing reports are virtually identical. This is all buried in your device’s settings, and on Apple devices, the data gets deleted after seven days.\n\nThis information is kind of interesting if you’re someone who likes looking at stats to spot patterns. It’s almost like fitness tracking for your attention. But unlike Apple’s Health and Fitness apps which, if you have an Apple Watch, will proactively prompt you to stand up or alert you to loud noises, Screen Time just passively collects this information and delivers it to you once a week through a push alert.\n\nAlthough there’s been a lot of focus on screen time for the past decade, knowing the amount of time you’ve spent staring at a screen isn’t all that helpful. And when it comes to social media apps, it’s a really poor metric, according to Amira Skeggs, a researcher at Cambridge.\n\n“When you say screen time, that could be someone calling their mom on WhatsApp and having a beautiful conversation, really fulfilling, or it could be a 14-year-old looking at self-harm content on TikTok,” Skeggs explained. “And those two things are equated as screen time, and obviously those relationships to well-being are going to be vastly different.”\n\nThe fact that these reports give you numbers and little actionable information is a well-covered topic. The New York Times reported as early as 2019 that “‘Screen time’ is over.” The Atlantic called Screen Time reports “The Worst Feature Apple Ever Made” last year, and Wired said “Tracking Screen Time Is Ruining Your Life” in 2023. These are melodramatic takes, in my opinion, but I do wonder if there’s more that Apple and Google could be doing.\n\nYou need a nudge\n\nTogether, the software made by Apple and Google are running on over 98 percent of mobile devices worldwide. If Apple and Google really wanted to, they could be doing a lot more to integrate digital wellness features into their operating systems. A nudge here or there — something as simple as prompting people to take a break — could help billions of people stop doomscrolling.\n\n“If it was a priority for them, you would be seeing better integration,” Andrew Przybylski, a professor of technology and human behavior at the Oxford Internet Institute, told me. He went on to explain that you can’t easily export Screen Time data and you can’t enroll in clinical trials about your device usage like you can with Apple Health data. Apple does make certain device usage data available to researchers through its SensorKit framework. Researchers also have very little insight into how Apple and Google develop Screen Time and Digital Wellbeing features.\n\n“There are just things in the last seven years that are missing that you would expect,” Przybylski added. “You would expect that there actually would be some independent testing to show that they work.”\n\nI asked Apple and Google about integrating digital wellness tools into their operating systems. Apple declined to comment. Google emphasized that the latest Digital Wellbeing features, namely Heads Up and Screen Time Reminders, are designed to remind users about their phone usage at any given moment without pointing them to a chart. Meanwhile, parental controls have been separated out into a suite of features called Google Family Link.\n\n“The goal is to use technology for joy and fun, and shift users from passive consumption to conscious choice,” said Daniel Goulding, a product manager for Android at Google.\n\nWhen you compare these incremental improvements to third-party digital wellness apps, you can start to get a handle on just how much more Apple and Google could be doing. I’ve spent the last couple of weeks testing out three popular ones — Forest, One Sec, Freedom — and although my reflexive phone-checking isn’t cured, I’m a lot more mindful about how I spend my attention looking at screens.\n\nForest is my favorite app so far. Borrowing from the Pomodoro time management technique , it lets you “plant” a digital tree, and for a set amount of time, you can’t leave the app or the tree will die. Forest rewards you with tokens for focus sessions that you can use to unlock new kinds of trees to plant. It’s $4 to download and own, and it’s oddly compelling to use.\n\nOne Sec , which has a more complicated setup process, essentially adds a time delay when you try to open certain apps. It lets you create custom interventions for each app, including simple tasks to complete before an app will open and activating your front-facing camera to look yourself in the eye before proceeding to doomscroll. The free version lets you do this with one app, and for $20 a year, the Pro version gives you unlimited apps as well as a few other features\n\nFreedom is even more comprehensive and gives you granular control over which apps and websites to block during certain situations. Because it taps into Apple’s Screen Time API, which lets it communicate with your phone’s operating system, Freedom can completely change the way your phone works when it’s on, dimming blocked app icons and preventing websites from loading in Safari. It costs $40 a year.\n\nWhat’s really worked in terms of helping me be on my phone less is just making it less interesting. Making your phone grayscale is the easiest way to do this. It’s boring to scroll through Instagram when everything is black and white. You can also try Apple’s Focus Modes, which let you create presets to minimize distractions for different scenarios — Google’s Digital Wellbeing has similar features — or just turn off notifications altogether.\n\nThe secret to scrolling less is simple: Make your home screen boring. Use the grayscale trick or use the “Tinted” option in your iPhone settings or use your Android settings to make the app icons monochrome. While you’re at it, delete as many app icons as you can. You can keep the ones you really use on your phone and use the search feature to find the rest. You can also use widgets for basic info like your calendar and the weather so you don’t have to open the app.\n\nMost of us don’t even notice how much we’re staring at screens without purpose. In a sense, I had to break my phone to get it to work right. My home screen is now monochrome and sparse. I only get notifications when a human is trying to contact me, and when I really want to pay attention to my family, I just leave my phone in the other room. It’s impossible to scroll when you can’t touch it.\n\nUpdate, March 7, 9:20 am ET: This story, originally published March 5, has been updated with additional information about Google Digital Wellbeing.",

He’s spent 15 years covering the intersection of technology, culture, and politics at places like The Atlantic, Gizmodo, and Vice.\n\nIn a 2019 speech at Georgetown University, Mark Zuckerberg made a bold statement. Rather than to help college kids get dates, he claimed, Facebook was invented as a platform for “free expression.” Six short years later, Zuckerberg’s company is trying to muzzle yet another whistleblower — one who happens to have written a book full of alleged anecdotes about him and fellow Facebook executives that aren’t just embarrassing but also politically damning.\n\nSarah Wynn-Williams, the whistleblower and author, was a director of global policy at Facebook from 2011 until 2017, when she was fired. The book came out on March 11 and is called Careless People: A Cautionary Tale of Power, Greed, and Lost Idealism, a reference to The Great Gatsby, which refers to its wealthy characters as “careless people” who “smashed up things and creatures and then retreated back into their money.” The analogy is not subtle, and neither are the allegations Wynn-Williams makes about her former bosses, including Sheryl Sandberg, former COO of Facebook, and Zuckerberg himself.\n\nUser Friendly A weekly dispatch to make sure tech is working for you, instead of overwhelming you. Email (required) Sign Up By submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice . This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.\n\nMeta took legal action against Wynn-Williams last week, arguing that she violated a nondisparagement agreement she signed when she was a Facebook employee. An arbitrator ruled in Meta’s favor on Wednesday, instructing Wynn-Williams to stop promoting the book and “amplifying any further disparaging, critical or otherwise detrimental comments.” The book’s publisher, Flatiron Books, and its parent company, Macmillan Publishers, were not part of the arbitration case, and the book remains on sale.\n\nAmong the more salacious claims Wynn-Williams makes in the book are that Sandberg once allegedly made her assistant buy $13,000 worth of lingerie for both Sandberg and the assistant. And on a trip home from Davos, Sandberg took the only bed on the plane, and then allegedly told Wynn-Williams, who was visibly pregnant at the time, to “come to bed” with her.\n\nThings get darker from there. Joel Kaplan, who was vice president of global policy and Wynn-Williams’ boss, allegedly did several inappropriate things around this time, including but not limited to telling Wynn-Williams that she looked “sultry.” When Wynn-Williams reported that she couldn’t work while on maternity leave because she was still bleeding from surgery, Kaplan allegedly asked where she was bleeding from. Wynn-Williams reported Kaplan for sexual harassment, and Meta said it conducted a lengthy investigation, including interviews with 17 witness, that cleared Kaplan.\n\nZuckerberg comes off looking bad, too, based on early reviews and reporting on the book’s allegations. NBC News sums up what Wynn-Williams claimed about the Facebook co-founder, now Meta CEO, thusly: “His belief that Andrew Jackson was the greatest American president, his interest in collecting wine from the Jackson era in the 1830s, his desire to have a ‘tribe’ of children and his professed ignorance that Facebook employees were letting him win at the board game Settlers of Catan.”\n\nAll these personal details frankly look quaint compared to what Wynn-Williams has to share about Facebook’s attempts to enter China. Under Zuckerberg’s leadership, the company was prepared to do almost anything to shut down dissent and comply with the Chinese Communist Party’s censorship rules in order to gain access to the country’s billion-plus potential users, according to the book, as well as a 78-page whistleblower complaint that Wynn-Williams filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. According to the complaint, Facebook even planned to employ a “chief editor” to take down unacceptable posts and to share all user data with the Chinese government. Wynn-Williams also alleges that Zuckerberg later told an incomplete version of the truth about its China plan effort to Congress. A Meta spokesperson told Vox that details of its plan to enter China were “widely reported beginning a decade ago.”\n\nRelated Why this Facebook scandal is different\n\nMeta does not like that whistleblower complaint or this book. The company said in a statement to Vox that the book contains “a mix of out-of-date and previously reported claims about the company and false accusations about our executives” and that Wynn-Williams was fired for “poor performance and toxic behavior.” Meta also claims that Wynn-Williams “has been paid by anti-Facebook activists.”",

        "source": "https://www.vox.com/",
        "content": "is a correspondent at Vox writing about climate change, energy policy, and science. He is also a regular contributor to the radio program Science Friday. Prior to Vox, he was a reporter for ClimateWire at E&E News.\n\nThe Environmental Protection Agency announced this week that it’s starting the process of undoing 31 environmental regulations, including a ruling that’s foundational to US climate policy. But undoing any regulation is a cumbersome process, and with the climate rule in particular, the EPA may end up painting itself into a corner.\n\nThe big target here is the 2009 endangerment finding, in which the EPA concluded that greenhouse gases threaten public health and welfare, therefore the agency must limit them. The finding is the foundation for regulations that ensued, like requiring power plants and vehicles to cut their emissions of gases that are heating up the planet. Without the endangerment finding, these regulations could be rescinded.\n\nThe rollbacks are yet another manifestation of the Trump administration’s longstanding antipathy toward all things related to climate change. “By overhauling massive rules on the endangerment finding, the social cost of carbon and similar issues, we are driving a dagger through the heart of climate-change religion and ushering in America’s Golden Age,” EPA administrator Lee Zeldin wrote in the Wall Street Journal.\n\nBut it will take more than press releases and editorials to get rid of greenhouse gas rules. The endangerment finding stems from a 2007 Supreme Court ruling in Massachusetts v. EPA that says greenhouse gases are covered under the Clean Air Act and the EPA has to figure out whether these gases could endanger public health or welfare.\n\nRelated Why the US is freezing as the planet reaches record warmth\n\nEndangerment endangered\n\nBased on science alone, the endangerment finding is on solid ground. The evidence is overwhelming that rising temperatures are worsening problems like heat stress and facilitating the spread of diseases carried by insects, which poses a threat to public health. And on welfare, the text of the Clean Air Act specifically says it includes “effects on soils, water, crops, vegetation, manmade materials, animals, wildlife, weather, visibility, and climate.”\n\nSo to undo the endangerment finding, the EPA would have to establish a factual record that climate change isn’t happening due to burning fossil fuels, and that even if it is, it doesn’t hurt anything.\n\nTrump administration officials have hinted that they are indeed making the case that efforts to limit climate change are worse than its harms and that warming might benefit humanity on balance.\n\n“This is truly ridiculous,” said David Bookbinder, director of law and policy at the Environmental Integrity Project and one of the attorneys who litigated Massachusetts v. EPA. “I could go into the DC Circuit and argue against this in pig latin and win it.”\n\nIt’s likely that states led by Democrats, particularly California, as well as environmental groups, will sue to stop the EPA’s efforts to repeal the endangerment finding, but a lot has to happen before it even gets to that point. The EPA has to make another factual determination, write a proposed rule, provide a justification, and invite public comments, all before they issue a final rule.\n\n“Nothing they’ve done so far on the endangerment finding counts as a final agency action that can be challenged in court, so there’s really nothing to sue on yet,” said Shaun Goho, legal director for the Clean Air Task Force.\n\nThe Trump administration may also face an unexpected complication in its efforts, thanks to a Supreme Court decision that many conservatives cheered. In the 2024 Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo decision, the Court overturned “Chevron deference,” a legal doctrine that lets federal agencies figure out the particulars of implementing complicated laws like the Clean Air Act when the wording is vague.\n\nThe Loper Bright decision gave courts much more authority to second-guess an agency’s decision by claiming that the agency’s action is not consistent with a federal statute. But Bookbinder argued that this actually works against the Trump administration’s climate rollbacks. Since the EPA can’t easily make its own determinations anymore about whether climate change is a threat, it has to stick to the letter of the law, and the law unambiguously says that “climate” is included in the obligation to protect welfare under the Clean Air Act.\n\n“Now we’re in a better position legally with the end of Chevron,” Bookbinder said. The other hurdle for the EPA is that with so many layoffs and job cuts across the agency, it will be much harder to find the staffing power to put together all the paperwork and argue the legal case for reversing the endangerment finding.\n\nThe litigation around the endangerment finding may wend its way back to the Supreme Court, where Republicans have a 6-3 majority, but historically courts have backed it and the case may not be the layup that the Trump administration may be anticipating.",

She writes primarily about the future of consciousness, tracking advances in artificial intelligence and neuroscience and their staggering ethical implications. Before joining Vox, Sigal was the religion editor at the Atlantic.\n\nScarlett, a visually impaired grade 3 student, uses a cane to walk to class at the Inclusive Education Community Resource Center in the Philippines, part of the GABAY project impacted by the Trump administration’s freeze on foreign aid. Ezra Acayan/Getty Images\n\nBut you can help keep some of these lifesaving programs going. Experts who see the immense value of these programs — which prevent and treat diseases, supply food and clean water to people living in extreme poverty, and help refugees fleeing war — have spun up new emergency funds to enable the programs to continue their operations. And they’re seeking donations.\n\nSo if you’re unhappy with Trump’s purge, you are not powerless here. Donating to one of these funds can be a way to resist the administration’s “America First” ethos. And because the funds are supporting programs that are extremely cost-effective — meaning they save more lives than others would with the same amount of money — they offer an unusually powerful opportunity to help the world’s most disenfranchised groups.\n\nSome may question whether it should fall to private donors to fill in the funding gaps this way; isn’t this the government’s job? It is. But in moments when the government isn’t doing nearly enough, individual generosity can really shine by stepping in with emergency aid. This is one of those moments.\n\nIf you’re concerned that private donors stepping in now will reduce pressure to restore USAID later on, consider this: There’s no way donors will manage to fill the massive gap that the government has left behind. Philanthropy may yield millions of dollars, but that’s a drop in the bucket compared to the billions that the government was providing.\n\nBesides, USAID was doing a lot of things donors just can’t do, like steering very large and highly trained staffs and working directly with other organizations and governments. So most experts I spoke with said it won’t be plausible to argue that philanthropy can just replace government aid.\n\nAnd people in urgent situations around the world need help now. They can’t simply keep waiting for their next meal or their next dose of medication. That’s what the three funds below are designed to address immediately. Let’s check them out.\n\n1) The Rapid Response Fund\n\nThis fund was co-created on February 17 by two organizations: The Life You Can Save, a nonprofit dedicated to fighting extreme poverty, and Founders Pledge, a nonprofit empowering entrepreneurs to do the most good possible with their charitable giving.\n\nThese nonprofits have a specialty in finding the most high-impact and cost-effective lifesaving programs out there. They’ve spent years rigorously evaluating programs, finding the ones with the strongest evidence base, and recommending them to donors who want to be sure they’re getting the most bang for their charitable buck.\n\nLess than a month after its launch, the Rapid Response Fund has pulled in over $1.5 million and is already disbursing cash to organizations that it has high confidence in based on past evaluations. They include:\n\nThe International Rescue Committee , which fights childhood malnutrition — linked to almost half of deaths among children under 5 years old — through programs led by community health workers. These programs cost only $130 per child treated and multiple studies have found recovery rates of 53 percent to 82 percent.\n\nThe Iodine Global Network , which prevents iodine deficiency, the most common cause of brain damage in newborns. This work not only saves lives but also improves educational outcomes and breaks cycles of poverty — all at the low cost of 5 cents to 10 cents per person annually.\n\nGoal 3’s IMPALA project , which equips African health care workers with tools like vital signs monitors so they can detect patient deterioration early and intervene when treatments are most effective. Initial results from a Malawian hospital showed a remarkable 59 percent drop in child mortality compared to the previous year.\n\nJessica La Mesa, co-CEO of The Life You Can Save, told me programs like these were severely underfunded relative to their potential impact even before the USAID cuts.\n\n“We needed more before, and we need even more now,” she said. “There’s still a massive funding gap, even just within the organizations we recommend — a $77 million gap across everything we’re looking at funding. So we have a long way to go.”\n\nWant to help fund crucial work like this? You can donate to the Rapid Response Fund here.\n\n2) Unlock Aid’s Foreign Bridge Fund\n\nUnlock Aid is a coalition group aimed at making global development more effective. Its new Foreign Aid Bridge Fund is meant to help sustain the organizations that were impacted by the US government’s cuts.\n\nThis fund is prioritizing organizations that are not only high-impact and cost-effective, but that have a sustainable business model — rather than being dependent on a single source of revenue, like the US government. Since the fund will be temporary, it’s looking for organizations that will be well positioned to continue even after the fund expires.\n\nUnlike The Life You Can Save and Founders Pledge, which are funding organizations they’d already evaluated in the past, Unlock Aid is accepting fresh applications from programs in need. They’ve already received applications from hundreds of organizations. The benefit of that is that they have the chance to encounter groups that aren’t on their radar yet but are doing critical work. But it means their grants committee has to assess a whole lot of material in a short timeframe.\n\nThat said, they’ve been able to move fast: Just days after launching on February 13, they awarded their first four grants, noting, “This rapid turnaround demonstrates our commitment to functioning as a true emergency fund, getting critical resources out quickly to organizations that need them most.”\n\nThose grants are going to two African organizations that provide lifesaving treatment to people living with HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis; another African organization that gives communities access to malaria care; and a humanitarian organization in the Caribbean.\n\nIf you want to fund more similar work, you can donate to Unlock Aid’s Foreign Aid Bridge Fund here.\n\n3) GiveDirectly\n\nGiveDirectly is an organization based on one big idea: If you want to help the world’s poorest people effectively, why not just give them cash?\n\nThe organization has been giving out no-strings-attached cash transfers for years, and along the way, it’s built up an impressive evidence base showing the benefits of these transfers. Cash gives people the agency to buy the things they really need, as opposed to what outsiders think they need. And it can be disseminated much faster than goods, thanks to cellphone-based banking. Cash is now considered the baseline standard for challenges like poverty alleviation, with other interventions judged on whether they’re superior to cash.\n\nGiveDirectly had about 38,000 families across Mozambique, Malawi, Morocco, and Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) slated to receive $20 million in life-changing cash transfers this year, funded by the US government’s foreign aid budget. Unfortunately, seven GiveDirectly programs were among those impacted by the USAID cuts; the organization recently received termination letters.\n\n“I think in DRC it’s been particularly terrible,” Anthea Gordon, GiveDirectly’s country director based there, told me. Over 500,000 people in eastern DRC have been displaced by fighting between M23 rebels and Congolese government forces. When M23 took over the city of Goma, where GiveDirectly’s office is, Gordon lost power and internet — so she initially had no idea about the USAID cuts.\n\n“I was hiding in a corridor,” she said. “When I resurfaced a couple days later, I couldn’t believe it. Out of the DRC humanitarian aid budget, the US funded about 70 percent, so this has had a massive, massive impact — at a time when there was more need than ever for humanitarian aid. It was complete disaster.”\n\nFor the families who were supposed to be receiving cash transfers, the cuts mean they’ll be at risk of being unable to afford essentials like food, medicine, and safe housing. So GiveDirectly has launched its own fundraising campaign, with the hope that it can still deliver cash to as many of the families as possible.\n\nIf you like the idea of showing solidarity with the world’s poorest people in an effective and non-paternalistic way, you can donate to GiveDirectly’s campaign here.\n\nAnd if you want to support one of these three funds, but aren’t sure which, don’t spend too much time worrying about it: Though they each vary a bit in their approach, all three support high-impact, cost-effective programs that can achieve an unusual amount of good with your money at an urgent time like this. That urgency is what Gordon, in the DRC, wants people to remember.\n\n“In terms of individuals’ lives, if you have HIV and you’re taking retrovirals and you don’t have your supply resumed very quickly, it’s game over,” she said. “We need something now to keep the health centers open, to give people cash, to have their next meal.”",

He’s spent 15 years covering the intersection of technology, culture, and politics at places like The Atlantic, Gizmodo, and Vice.\n\nThe next phase of Elon Musk’s plan to entangle his companies with the workings of the federal government is well underway. That entails not only President Donald Trump’s photo op with a Tesla in front of the White House but also, surprisingly, the future of your internet connection.\n\nMore specifically, Musk is making moves that could change the way millions of Americans access the internet by boosting Starlink, the satellite-based internet company operated by his company, SpaceX, of which he is the founder, CEO, and major shareholder.\n\nStarlink and other space-based internet projects work by beaming internet service from satellites in orbit down to Earth’s surface, as opposed to wired broadband internet, which typically relies on fiber-optic cable. Satellite internet’s major advantage is that, with a few exceptions, it can work almost anywhere on the planet. Its drawbacks — including slow speeds, high latency, and spotty reliability — mean that fiber internet is better for the vast majority of people right now.\n\nUser Friendly A weekly dispatch to make sure tech is working for you, instead of overwhelming you. Email (required) Sign Up By submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice . This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.\n\nIn the last week or so, the Commerce Department said it plans to rewrite the rules of a $42 billion high-speed internet initiative in a way that would benefit Starlink. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) meanwhile granted Starlink a waiver that will make its new service, which lets phones connect to satellites, more powerful, as satellite competitors urged the agency to rein in Musk’s company, which they say is “anticompetitive.”\n\nMusk affiliates have also reportedly instructed government agencies to start using Starlink, and the General Services Administration is already doing it, apparently without oversight. SpaceX confirmed that it’s leasing Starlink kits to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), amid reports that the agency might cancel a $2.4 billion contract with Verizon and award it to Starlink instead. The company denied that it was trying to take over the contract.\n\nThere are billions of dollars at stake here, but this isn’t just about the money. (Musk doesn’t really need it.) Some people are worried that these developments represent the early steps of a power shift in the telecom industry, one that could result in the world’s richest man deciding how the nation’s communications network works.\n\n“We have never before had a situation where the owner of a major communications company is inside the government. This is a very unusual situation.”\n\nIn addition to hacking away at the federal government in his unelected position as the head of DOGE, Musk could also become the single individual who is “the dominant force in telecom policy,” according to Blair Levin, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institute and former chief of staff at the FCC. What’s more, the US telecommunications system is key to national security, and Musk’s business interests might not always line up with Washington’s.\n\n“We have never before had a situation where the owner of a major communications company is inside the government. This is a very unusual situation,” Levin said. “It’s very troubling.”\n\nSome of this must sound hyperbolic. It’s also hypothetical — for now. I’ve been writing about Starlink since before it launched its first batch of satellites in 2019, and from bringing remote parts of the world online to connecting Ukrainian soldiers at war, there’s no doubt that the technology is incredible.\n\nBut if recent events are any indication, the Trump administration plans to advantage Starlink in ways that benefit Musk more than the people who need better internet service. It also opens the door for Musk to become a much bigger power broker in the telecom world — and have more of a say in how you get online.\n\nElon’s space internet is not better than Earth internet yet\n\nIt’s tempting to think Starlink is the future of internet service. It’s very easy to set up, which is a huge deal to anyone who lacks broadband access — soldiers in Ukraine, for example, or farmers in rural America. But Starlink is not the same as the fiber-based broadband that’s become the gold standard for internet access.\n\nFor a number of reasons, space internet isn’t as fast, as reliable, or as cheap as terrestrial broadband. That’s why Congress prioritized companies that lay fiber-optic cable with the Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment (BEAD) program, which provides federal funding to bring high-speed internet access to as many as 8 million Americans who have never had it, as part of the 2021 infrastructure bill. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick now wants to make the program “technology neutral,” a change that would increase Starlink’s chances of getting grants. Whereas Musk’s company was on track to receive a little over $4 billion under the old rules, Starlink could now get between $10 billion and $20 billion, according to the Wall Street Journal.\n\nIf the Commerce Department goes through with the proposed changes to the BEAD program, its implementation would be delayed — more than one expert told me it would be by at least a year. Which is ironic given that Republicans made delays in BEAD’s rollout a talking point during the 2024 election. This process involves digging miles of trenches for tubes of cables that connect far-flung parts of the country. It takes time and costs money, but this infrastructure would last for decades.\n\n“It is truly a historic opportunity to get fiber to a lot of these places,” Drew Garner, director of policy engagement at the Benton Institute for Broadband & Society, told me. “We’ll probably never have another opportunity like this.”\n\nStarlink dishes are easy to set up, but they don’t offer the same speed and reliability as fiber. Cate Dingley/Bloomberg via Getty Images\n\nSome argue that Starlink and other satellite-based internet companies could get people online more quickly and without the expense of laying fiber. Starlink already has more than 7,000 satellites in orbit and is trying to add more. But it’s unclear how quickly Starlink could actually add more users, since the company already has a waiting list for people to sign up because its network is at capacity.\n\nThat’s not to mention the fact that, for now, Starlink is neither faster nor cheaper than terrestrial broadband. Starlink delivers download speeds of 50 to 100 Mbps, while the FCC defines broadband as 100 Mbps. The average download speed in the US is about 275 Mbps. Starlink also currently charges customers $80 a month for its “Residential Lite” service, while the average US internet bill is $78 a month.\n\nThis is what makes the Trump administration’s apparent preferential treatment of Musk’s company so frustrating. It’s a poorer solution that takes longer and doesn’t result in savings for most Americans.\n\nMusk posts Starlink into the FAA\n\nWe don’t yet know how things will shake out with BEAD. The Commerce Department could change its mind, and the broadband infrastructure expansion could break ground in a few states this spring. However, the Trump administration is already starting to use Starlink in unusual ways.\n\nThe FAA, like many federal government agencies, is dealing with massive staff cuts at the behest of Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency. Just days after 67 people died in a midair collision near Washington’s Reagan Airport, Musk’s staff urged FAA staffers to accept buyout offers, which more than 1,300 of them did, according to the Atlantic. DOGE also ended up firing about 400 FAA employees. When Musk’s team tried to lay off air traffic controllers, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy finally intervened.\n\nRelated The year space internet takes off\n\nAt the same time — and operating on orders from Musk himself — a SpaceX engineer started to deploy Starlink technology on FAA systems. Musk posted on X that “the Verizon communication system to air traffic control is breaking down very rapidly,” that “the situation is extremely dire,” and that he would send Starlink dishes to the rescue. The FAA has since confirmed that it’s reviewing the $2.4 billion Verizon contract and testing Starlink equipment at several locations, including in Alaska, New Jersey, and Oklahoma.\n\nMusk’s posting-fueled intervention at the FAA is a scary one. Almost single-handedly, the billionaire threw cold water on a contract with Verizon, one that will affect the safety and security of Americans. Although it’s not clear if Starlink will indeed take over this particular contract, we have a glimpse at what it looks like for a singular bureaucrat — one that sells satellite dishes that don’t always work — to call the shots.\n\n“If you’re downloading stuff to your house in a rural area, and your speed drops because the system is oversubscribed, that’s annoying,” said Harold Feld, senior vice president of Public Knowledge. “If you’re the FAA, and your speed drops because the capacity is oversubscribed, that’s deadly.”\n\nProject 2025’s surprising role in all this\n\nElon Musk and DOGE, which is run by employees of Musk’s companies, certainly appear to be operating within the federal government to promote the best interests of those companies. The “why” of it all will take some time to figure out. Less than two months into Trump’s second presidency, we’re too busy keeping track of what’s even happening, especially where Musk is involved.\n\nAs for Starlink and Elon Musk’s apparent ambitions to dominate the US telecom industry, the FCC’s cooperation is essential. And Brendan Carr, the agency’s new chair, happens to be a big Elon Musk fan. Carr first made contact with Musk on X, where the two exchanged complaints about Democrats denying Starlink broadband subsidies and blamed Kamala Harris for rolling BEAD out too slowly. Carr was also the author of the chapter on the FCC for the big report published by the Heritage Foundation’s Project 2025. In it, he argues against terrestrial broadband expansion and in favor of accelerating the development of satellite technology, like Starlink.\n\nStarlink constellations look spectacular after they launch, but each satellite only lasts five years in orbit. George Rose/Getty Images\n\nOne of Project 2025’s main goals is to “dismantle the administrative state,” and in Musk, the right found a key ally. Musk has also found an opportunity: When the bureaucrats are all fired, someone still has to make decisions, and it’s easier to move quickly without any oversight.\n\nAcross the world, people are setting Tesla dealerships on fire to protest Musk’s gutting of the federal workforce and hoping to tank its stock. But what’s happening more quietly with Starlink, the Commerce Department, and the FCC shows that the multibillionaire isn’t just interested in making money. He’s consolidating power in Washington and helping determine what the future will look like.\n\nSelling cars is one thing, but taking control over America’s telecommunications network is another. Musk is not there yet, but we have already seen Musk use Starlink specifically to intervene in military operations abroad — he prevented Ukraine from launching a surprise attack against Russia in 2022. That sets a scary precedent for what the future holds.\n\n“Elon Musk has been pretty cavalier about his ability to turn on or turn off Starlink to influence policy decisions,” Garner, from the Benton Institute, told me, referring to a series of recent posts on X from Musk about cutting off Starlink access in Ukraine.\n\nIt’s not just scary that Musk is becoming more powerful in the telecom industry. It is uniquely terrifying that he alone could decide to bring networks down. And that might be an even more important development to keep our eyes on than the Tesla ad he produced in front of the White House.",

        "content": "is a staff writer for The Atlantic and the author of Me, But Better: The Science and Promise of Personality Change .\n\nIf I ever need a reminder that I’m not a natural extrovert, I need only to look at the journal I kept during the early days of my improv classes. “I am having incredible dread about improv tomorrow,” I wrote one day. “I would literally pay any amount to get out of this class,” I moaned on another. “You can’t be bad at improv, but I feel like I am bad at improv,” I wrote after a class during which I gave up in the middle of a game called Big Booty and said simply, “I can’t take this anymore.”\n\nI had enrolled in improv because I was trying to become more extroverted, as part of a sweeping personality-change project that I document in my new book, Me, But Better. Extroversion is one of the “big five” personality traits that scientists say make up a person’s disposition, along with openness to experience, conscientiousness, agreeableness, and neuroticism. Extroversion is associated with socializing and cheerfulness, and as a hardened introvert, I knew I needed a mechanism to force me out of my house and into gregariousness. Improv seemed like the full-immersion extrovert experience.\n\nThese perks of extroversion would only reveal themselves to me in time, after many, many hours of playing Zip Zap Zop against my will.\n\nBut it wasn’t going well, and at times, I thought about dropping the class or giving up altogether. Even after I got better at improv, I still felt nervous before every class. And the other activities I was doing to boost my extroversion — like going on long hikes with strangers — were only mildly pleasant, at best. I had this notion that, since I was an introvert, I should avoid difficult social situations like, well, improv class.\n\nI’m glad I didn’t give up, though. It turns out that behaving in an extroverted way can have surprising benefits, even if you’re an introvert. And these perks of extroversion would only reveal themselves to me in time, after many, many hours of playing Zip Zap Zop against my will.\n\nWhat spurts of extroversion can do for introverts\n\nCompared to introverts, extroverts are happier, research unfortunately shows. An exhaustingly chirpy series of studies has found that social connection is one of the strongest predictors of well-being, and extroverts are more socially connected. In lab experiments, extroverts tend to interpret ambiguous stimuli more positively, hearing the word “won” rather than “one,” for example, or writing more uplifting short stories based on generic prompts. People who are extroverted as teenagers remain happier even when they’re 60.\n\nVox Culture Culture reflects society.

But Sonja Lyubomirsky, a psychologist who has studied this phenomenon, says it’s worth focusing less on the “extrovert” part of this and more on the fact that these individuals are more enmeshed in community. “Connection is really the key to happiness,” Lyubomirsky told me. And there are ways to square your natural introversion with the universal human need for connection. You don’t have to mingle with everyone at the office party, for instance. You can just call a trusted friend for a one-on-one conversation. Even hanging out with others and listening more than you talk can be a form of “extroversion,” Lyubomirsky says.\n\nOne surprising thing Introverts may believe that behaving like extroverts means going against their nature — but this doesn’t bother us as much as we might think. In one study, introverts even reported feeling truer to themselves when they were behaving like extroverts.\n\nWhile it’s true that extroverts enjoy talking, people, and attention, they also enjoy activity, period. Therefore, to boost your own levels of extroversion, you can just sign up for an activity — in addition to improv, I tried sailing — and commit to going, even if you don’t plan to talk much.\n\nThough there’s nothing wrong with being an introvert, several studies have shown that when introverts occasionally behave in extroverted ways, they experience more “positive affect” — science-speak for good feelings. “I started doing these studies because I didn’t believe them,” says John Zelenski, a psychology professor at Carleton University who has replicated this finding, and who himself is introverted. But “it absolutely seems correct that if you get people to act extroverted — and usually, that means socializing for a few minutes — there’s a big mood boost there.”\n\nThe reason for this twist is that behaving against our natures doesn’t bother us as much as we fear it might. In one study, introverts even reported feeling truer to themselves when they were behaving like extroverts. That’s because, much as we might prize authenticity, we have other desires, too. We want to handle difficult situations appropriately, feel embraced by others, and accomplish our goals — and most of us also want to feel happier and more connected. Sometimes, achieving those things means going against our “natural” personality traits.\n\n“Lots of things that we may not initially like doing actually really benefit us,” says Lyubomirsky, who, as an example, offered that she now loves running but took a while to get into it. “A lot of things in life don’t feel natural at first. … Just because it doesn’t feel comfortable and natural doesn’t mean it’s not authentic.” Authenticity can come from familiarity, and the only way to build familiarity is through experience.\n\nA desire to remain “authentic” is one reason people may balk at the idea of changing themselves — either through personality change or otherwise. But living authentically can also mean acting in ways that feel, at first, uncomfortable, as long as those actions draw you closer to your values and goals. Many of us, if we followed the North Star of “authenticity,” would quit our jobs, neglect our families, and watch Love Is Blind all day. But what is instinctive is not always best.\n\nThis doesn’t mean behaving like an extrovert constantly, just occasionally. I told Zelenski about a time I had to collect “man on the street” interviews as a reporter — a horrible task that involves approaching random strangers and lobbing questions at them in an attempt to find a pattern of responses for your story. One freezing cold night in New Jersey, I didn’t conceal my misery well enough. As I mangled my words and rubbed my hands together, one woman looked at me with pity and said, “Don’t worry, you’re almost done.”\n\n“After a while, it does get old,” Zelenski acknowledged.\n\nHow to coax out your inner extrovert\n\nTo figure out how to get better at these forays into extroversion, I called up Gillian Sandstrom, a senior lecturer in psychology at the University of Sussex in the UK. More importantly for my purposes, she talks to strangers — on the street, on vacation, even in the sacred space of the London Tube. She researches the power of “weak ties,” casual acquaintances with whom we interact, but usually only briefly. People who have lots of weak ties, who make eye contact and idle chitchat with baristas and neighbors, feel happier than those who don’t, her studies find.\n\nInitially, her research felt alien to me. I had stopped working in an office when the pandemic started, and I didn’t miss it at all. I live in the suburbs, so I don’t interact with many people unless I make a point to — and I usually don’t.\n\nSandstrom told me she’s the same way: She’s an introvert and tends to avoid demanding social situations. But she uses talking to strangers as a coping mechanism of sorts. If she’s in a big, crowded room, she finds someone who’s off by themselves and starts a one-on-one conversation.\n\nOne way to open such a conversation is by making a statement, rather than asking a question. For instance, when Sandstrom is on public transportation, she’ll test the waters by complimenting the person sitting next to her. (She recommends remarking on something other than their looks.) Or, she’ll comment on something in the environment — if they have a suitcase, she’ll ask where they’re going. One time, she was walking in a park and noticed a man smiling at some ducks. “Aren’t they cute?” Sandstrom said. She and the man ended up chatting for half an hour, since they were walking in the same direction. At the end of her conversations, Sandstrom just says something like, “Thank you, it’s been nice talking to you,” and walks off.\n\nJust like a mediocre movie wouldn’t make you swear off cinema forever, one bad conversation shouldn’t keep you from trying again.\n\nI told Sandstrom that I don’t miss my weak ties much, and I’m not really one for small talk. We either have to get to the bottom of your childhood trauma, or we’re not talking at all. The thing is, she pointed out, most weak ties probably aren’t going to become long-term relationships. I needed to set the stakes way lower. Her conversations tend to last just a few minutes, and sometimes, they’re nothing special. But just like a mediocre movie wouldn’t make you swear off cinema forever, one bad conversation shouldn’t keep you from trying again.\n\nOver time, these weak ties do benefit us, even if we don’t especially notice them. They make us feel woven into the social fabric, Sandstrom says, like we’re part of something bigger. “When I do talk to people, I feel better,” she told me. “It’s almost always at least an average experience.” And when a conversation is unusually engaging, “it feels awesome, because I wouldn’t expect there to be anything coming from it.”\n\nAs I sped home from my first improv class, I detected something that, honestly, floored me. I was smiling. Even though I would continue to dread it for months, something about the whole exercise was just so fun. I’m rarely immersed in something that’s meant to be light and exuberant, as opposed to correct or exacting. Because it was the middle of the pandemic, it had been months since I’d socialized with a group of people. The electricity of improv had invigorated me, in spite of myself.",

These stories have shaped how billionaires including Elon Musk think about AI and fueled a growing movement of people who believe it could be the best or worst thing to ever happen to humanity.\n\nSo what exactly should we actually be worried about when it comes to AI?\n\nIn Good Robot, a special four-part podcast series launching March 12 from Unexplainable and Future Perfect, host Julia Longoria goes deep into the strange, high-stakes world of AI to answer that question. But this isn’t just a story about technology — it’s about the people shaping it, the competing ideologies driving them, and the enormous consequences of getting this right (or wrong).\n\nFor a long time, AI was something most people didn’t have to think about, but that’s no longer the case. The decisions being made right now — about who controls AI, how it’s trained, and what it should or shouldn’t be allowed to do — are already changing the world.\n\n\n\nThe people trying to build these systems don’t agree on what should happen next — or even on what exactly it is they’re creating. Some call it artificial general intelligence (AGI), while OpenAI’s CEO, Sam Altman, has talked of creating a “magic intelligence in the sky” — something like a god.\n\nBut whether AI is a true existential risk or just another overhyped tech trend, one thing is certain: the stakes are getting higher, and the fight over what kind of intelligence we’re building is only beginning. Good Robot takes you inside this fight — not just the technology, but the ideologies, fears, and ambitions shaping it. From billionaires and researchers to ethicists and skeptics, this is the story of AI’s messy, uncertain future, and the people trying to steer it.\n\nGood Robot #1: The Magic Intelligence in the Sky\n\nBefore AI became a mainstream obsession, one thinker sounded the alarm about its catastrophic potential.

She first joined Vox in 2019, and her work has also appeared in Politico, Washington Monthly, and the New Republic.\n\nTraders watch as then-President-elect Donald Trump walks onto the floor of the New York Stock Exchange on December 12, 2024, in New York City. Spencer Platt/Getty Images\n\nCandidate Donald Trump promised an economic renaissance. President Donald Trump is delivering economic turmoil.\n\nThe US stock market, once the only measure of economic performance that the president cared about, has seen a significant selloff amid fears of an impending recession — and the US is underperforming relative to its global peers.\n\nOther indicators look brighter, but there are troubling signs on the horizon. February’s jobs report said the labor market was holding steady, but the report did not yet capture the full extent of Trump’s mass layoffs of federal workers. Inflation came down slightly in February, but price stability is in trouble as Trump’s tariffs touch off a global trade war.\n\nMeanwhile, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has said the administration is focused on the “real economy,” tracking Treasury yields as an indicator of its health. Declining Treasury yields could help bring down borrowing costs across the economy, spurring investment and leading to economic growth. But amid the chaos created by Trump’s policies, it’s not clear that strategy will work.\n\nThe future looks rocky enough that Trump last weekend refused to rule out a recession.\n\nTrump’s defenders say the pain is temporary and that good times are ahead: “I’d kind of suggest people keep their powder dry and pay attention to a well-thought-out economic plan that will indeed make America great again,” Larry Kudlow, a Fox Business pundit and former Trump adviser, said Monday.\n\nBut the American public remains skeptical: A March Reuters/Ipsos poll found that 57 percent of Americans think Trump’s economic policy has been too erratic. Other recent polls similarly show his approval ratings on his handling of the economy tanking.\n\nHere’s what the economy looks like right now, in four charts.\n\nUS stocks are underperforming\n\nInvestors might have hoped that Trump’s second term would be a boon for the stock market. Trump certainly gave the markets a lot of attention during his first term, when he frequently touted the record highs the stock market reached under his tenure, appearing to view it as a direct reflection of the strength of his economic policies.\n\nIn his second term, the markets have instead been roiled by his tariff policies, which threaten to raise prices for Americans and have set off a trade war, Meanwhile, he has dismissed concerns about a potential recession.\n\n“I don’t see it at all,” Trump told reporters on Tuesday when asked if he thinks there will be a recession.\n\nMajor US stock indices closed higher on Wednesday following the inflation report. But they are still posting losses this year to date. That has put them behind global stock indices. Some of those that exclude US stocks have even posted gains so far in 2025.\n\nJob growth is steady but precarious\n\nThough hiring has remained strong, there are some signs that the labor market is cooling down. The US added 151,000 jobs in February, but the unemployment rate increased to 4.1 percent from 4 percent.\n\nThat uptick might be a sign of a slowdown to come. In February, US employers announced job cuts on par with what was seen during the last two US recessions.\n\nThe February jobs numbers also do not fully reflect the impact of cuts underway at the federal government.\n\nOn Wednesday alone, the Trump administration slashed more than 1,300 jobs at the Education Department, practically halving its size. Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency has also claimed to have made over $100 billion in spending cuts, but his team has been unreliable in their accounting. Those cuts could also affect jobs at businesses that contract with the federal government.\n\nTrump is eyeing Treasury yields\n\nTrump officials have signaled that they’re closely monitoring a benchmark known as the 10-year Treasury bond yield.\n\nThat yield is the interest rate that the federal government pays to Treasury bondholders each year on loans that mature after 10 years. It affects borrowing costs for everything from the $12.6 trillion mortgage market to $5.8 trillion in bank lending. The current yield is about 4.2 percent.\n\nThat rate isn’t determined by the government but rather set by market forces. If financial institutions are feeling good about the US’s financial outlook, their bids at these bond auctions may be lower. If they’re predicting economic turbulence, as is currently the case, those bids may be higher.\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of Trump’s reelection, the 10-year Treasury rate rose sharply. It’s come down since peaking in January, but rose again amid the uncertainty and fear created by Trump’s tariffs.\n\nBessent has said that lowering the Treasury yield could bring financial relief to struggling Americans, and Trump heralded a “big, beautiful drop” in Treasury yields during his recent address to Congress.\n\nHowever, there are some snags in his plans: For one, Germany has triggered a global bond selloff with its recent announcement of major infrastructure and defense spending, causing US Treasury yields to rise. And Trump’s tariffs may actually lead to more inflation, making it difficult for borrowing costs to come down.\n\nInflation is expected to creep up again\n\nNew data from the federal government published Wednesday shows that inflation cooled to 2.6 percent in February, exceeding some analysts’ expectations. But it might be premature to celebrate.\n\nThat’s because Trump’s tariffs may have not yet been fully priced into consumer goods. Trump imposed 25 percent tariffs on all aluminum and steel goods on Wednesday, and the European Union and Canada have responded with retaliatory tariffs on a host of US products ranging from bourbon to motorcycles.\n\nTrump has also imposed a 20 percent tariff on Chinese goods and 25 percent tariffs on imports from Canada and New Mexico, though has exempted broad categories of goods including goods imported by US automakers.",

        "content": "When you get to a place financially where you can begin to start saving rather than living paycheck to paycheck, a big question often comes up: Should I pay off my debt or invest in the stock market? There’s no simple answer, but there’s a rule of thumb that can help you decide what to do with this money to have the best financial outcome in the long run.\n\nThe first place to look is the interest rate on your debt and see if it’s below 7 percent, the rate of return you can conservatively expect from investing in an index fund, like the S&P 500. If your debt — like a mortgage or a student loan — falls below 7 percent, it is usually mathematically more beneficial to invest in the stock market while you pay down the debt by its minimum payments. The logic being that you’ll likely earn more interest by investing than your debt will accrue in that time.\n\nHigher interest rate debt, like credit card debt, should almost always be eliminated as soon as possible, since you are statistically unlikely to see a rate of return from investing past 7 to 10 percent annually. And of course, investing always comes with risk. So the most secure bet is always to work toward being debt-free.\n\n\n\nFind this and other Vox videos on YouTube.\n\n\n\nThis video is presented by Robinhood.

        "content": "It’s not just heterosexual women who are accused of having impossible standards for their male partners. Certain men seem to harbor a very specific fantasy of how their female partners should look and behave too: look no further than the popularity of the “tradwife” or the fact that late last year, actor Sydney Sweeney was labeled “mid” by a bevy of online male commenters. If Sweeney isn’t good-looking enough, one might wonder, then what woman is?\n\nIt should go without saying that maintaining some sort of inventory of qualities you’re looking for is mostly beneficial when choosing a partner. These ideals provide a loose sketch of the type of person you want to date and how you’d like to be treated. There was a time, in the not-too-distant past, where the standard most appropriate for women to have was, “Can he provide enough to ensure we won’t be destitute?” Now, with more freedom, daters want to ensure they align with their partners on values and worldviews. If not, they’re empowered to walk away.\n\nVox Culture Culture reflects society. Get our best explainers on everything from money to entertainment to what everyone is talking about online.

They won’t see it that way. They’ll see it as their standards are really high.”\n\nHowever, singles might end up disappointed when no one measures up. According to a 2019 Pew Research Center survey, among both straight and queer Americans who reported difficulty dating, 43 percent said it was because they failed to find someone who meets their expectations. “I don’t think that people are realistic at all,” says Daphney Poyser, the CEO, matchmaker, and head dating coach at LGBTQ matchmaking service Fern Connections. “People just think that I’m gonna meet my Prince Charming … and we’re gonna live happily ever after. And it just doesn’t work that way.”\n\nWhat men — and women — want\n\nWhy I reported this Many of the straight single women I know have expressed a similar sentiment: “All the guys I’m dating kind of suck.” These are smart, beautiful, successful women who feel like the dating pool is full of duds who can’t answer a text or initiate an actual date. Meanwhile, TikTok is full of talk about red flags and not settling for the “bare minimum.” I wondered: Is it that important to you that he opens the door or pays for the date? So I decided to talk to some singles to find out what’s happening with men’s and women’s dating standards.\n\nMen, on the other hand, consistently aspire to date someone hot. Across the same studies spanning decades, results show men prefer physically attractive mates with “good genes” and “reproductive capacity.” “As a matchmaker,” Poyser says, “I hear a lot of ‘I need someone who’s petite. I want someone who’s younger,’ when it comes to men.”\n\nRaymond Truong, a 27-year-old accountant in Portland, is looking for a woman who is fit, interesting, ambitious, conventionally attractive, and who shares his values. While he’s gone out with a number of women primarily from dating apps — he likes the information he gets up front — only a handful have progressed to second dates.\n\nTruong has been told his standards are too high, but he doesn’t see the point in lowering them. “In the beginning of my dating I did do that,” he says, “and it felt like a waste of time.” He also wonders if the women he’s seeing have better options than him.\n\nMeanwhile, female breadwinners tend to inspire stress among their male partners. When wives outearn their husbands, men are increasingly anxious, research shows. “A lot of these men who are not going on to college are often having trouble finding jobs and then resenting women,” says Campbell Leaper, a distinguished professor of psychology at the University of California, Santa Cruz.\n\nTraditional gender roles still dominate dating\n\nOne reason for the current state of affairs in dating may be that despite society’s shift toward more egalitarian partnerships, young people still support traditional gender roles. In a 2016 study, both male and female college students said men should be the ones to initiate a date, hold the door open, pay for the date, and propose marriage, while women should take the man’s last name. A 2020 study found that gender stereotypes in first dates, where men are proactive and women are reactive, persist and may create unrealistic expectations.\n\nAmong the LGBTQ people Ellen Lamont, an associate sociology professor at Appalachian State University, spoke to for her book The Mating Game: How Gender Still Shapes How We Date, these gendered expectations are a non-issue. When someone wants to make a move, they do so. “In fact, for certain people I interviewed who had been in heterosexual relationships before coming to identify as LGBTQ,” Lamont says, “they discussed having to unlearn those expectations, and they came to see those expectations as very toxic.”\n\nAs for heterosexual singles, even if they say they want an equal relationship, social scripts can be deeply rooted and internalized. Throughout her life, Morgan Moore, 33, observed her parents dote on each other, and watched as her father cheered on her mother when she became the breadwinner. Moore, who works in ad sales in the DC area, yearns for a relationship like her parents — one where values are aligned, and where her future partner “emotionally, physically, financially” takes care of her.\n\n“You should be coming up to me. You are now, as a man, in your feminine energy and putting me in my masculine energy.”\n\nStill, she struggles to find a man who lives up to these standards. “I can’t remember the last time a guy bought me a drink at the bar in my adulthood,” Moore says. While she has no issue approaching men and making the first move, she assumes these prospective partners aren’t serious about a relationship. “The sperm chases the egg,” she says. “You should be coming up to me. You are now, as a man, in your feminine energy and putting me in my masculine energy.” This kind of talk about masculine and feminine energies, it should be noted, is all over social media.\n\nEarnshaw, the therapist, says the examples of love and romance people observe — whether in culture or in their lives — can shape daters’ beliefs around what they should want or how courtship should look. Many men Earnshaw speaks with, she says, were socialized to approach women first, but they realize that’s no longer the expectation or preference. “You’ve got a generation of people,” Earnshaw says, “who feel very stuck in ‘What the hell is my role supposed to be? Society is telling me I want a more modern way of dealing with this, but my heart and my mind and my socialization are telling me that that’s icky, and so I don’t know what I’m supposed to do here.’”\n\nStandards as protection\n\nSo it’s fair to ask: are we all just being too picky?\n\nExceedingly high expectations have given way to “red flags” — habits and quirks that are instant dealbreakers. It’s impossible to know whether your date’s penchant for cutting you off mid-sentence may portend deeper issues, but the impulse to self-protect could lead you to write them off anyway. You may be well-meaning in wanting to avoid an unhealthy relationship, but “it’s very hard to build relationships with people if you’re trying to control everything and if you aren’t able to settle into allowing some things to not be perfect,” Earnshaw says. Dating apps, which lay bare plenty of characteristics, from height to dietary preferences, make it easier to choose — or discount — others based on these qualities under the auspices of having standards.\n\nIronically, the normalization of prioritizing mental health led to greater acceptance of our own flaws and imperfections, Earnshaw says, but less willingness to tolerate that same messiness in others. As a result, minor foibles are filed under red flags and the person possessing them is dubbed as failing to meet your standards. “We’ve made everything toxic when it comes to relationships except ourselves — we’re not toxic,” she says. “We’re wonderful, authentic, should be able to be our full selves. But if somebody isn’t good at texting back, that’s a toxic person.”\n\nOn the other hand, standards provide an effective framework for what behavior is and isn’t acceptable to you in a romantic partner. Without them, you may find yourself in an unfulfilling relationship with someone who’s so misaligned or whose actions make you feel disrespected, unheard, or worse, unsafe. In an effort to pair off with someone who shares their values, singles may decide that dating someone of another political party is off limits, which data suggests they are.\n\nTo say nothing of meeting high standards, evidence points to men failing at the basics. In her research, Lamont has found that men are struggling to fulfill women’s baseline expectations: someone who isn’t controlling, someone who believes in reciprocity, someone who will commit. When men fail to clear these hurdles, some women may raise the bar to weed out those who don’t meet the bare minimum.\n\nIn her research, Lamont has found that men are struggling to fulfill women’s baseline expectations.\n\nKay, a 22-year-old psychology major living in Pensacola, Florida, whose last name is being withheld so she can speak freely about her relationships, feels this lack of effort from some of the men she’s dated. “A lot of men my age seem uninterested in moving forward in life and it’s frustrating because many of them try to hold women back who are focused on advancing their education or career,” she says in an email. “It’s hard to find someone who’s not intimidated by ambition and who is willing to grow alongside me.” While she says financial stability is important in a relationship, she cares more about a potential partner’s values and their willingness to grow together.\n\nCompromise is possible\n\nSo what hope do singles with high standards have if they feel the dating pool is full of duds? First, you need to home in on what qualities in a partner really matter and which are non-essential, Poyser, the matchmaker, says. Sure, dating someone with a six-figure salary would be nice, but do they share your values?\n\nRelated How to make dating suck less\n\nAfter ending a six-and-a-half-year relationship, Gia Aldisert, a 22-year-old content creator based in Los Angeles, reevaluated what she wanted out of a partner. While she admits her past relationship wasn’t unhealthy, there were some boxes her ex left unchecked, some areas where she felt she was settling. Her current list of standards for a boyfriend includes someone ambitious, who embraces romantic gestures, who makes time for her friends and family, and who wants to show her off. “I feel like a major way that dating as a whole for women [changed] is that they understand their value now and they don’t just settle for the first guy that treats them with the bare minimum,” Aldisert says.\n\nStandards are only as good as your ability to reciprocate, Poyser says. If you hope to date someone who prioritizes their career, you should be able to say the same about yourself. “If I’m going to say I want someone who is kind and thoughtful,” Poyser says, “then I need to be kind and thoughtful too.”\n\nYou may also want to interrogate the source of your expectations, especially ones rooted in established gender roles. Singles shouldn’t be ashamed to admit to themselves if they do yearn for more stereotypical dating scripts, such as a man pursuing a woman, Earnshaw says. But you might also come to the realization that you were socialized to believe you desired these traditional dating roles. In reality, many relationships will have some combination of “traditional” and modern: a woman may not care that she outearns the men she dates, but she would like a long-term partner who cares for the lawn and the car. “Just lean into it,” Earnshaw says. “You want traditional? Fine. You’ll find somebody out there that’s like that, but then you have to be willing to lean into that. If you want to be the one to talk to this guy in the bar … then you got to do it.”\n\n“I usually recommend people do three dates in three totally different places,” he says. “Actually give people chances and try to do fun things that you would do anyway.”\n\nStandards can help guide your romantic choices, but they’re best utilized once you have a fair assessment of the person you’re dating. Paul Eastwick, a psychology professor at the University of California, Davis, says we generally don’t have a good read on someone until the third date — so don’t immediately write them off if you’re not instantly physically attracted or felt their jokes were lacking. “I usually recommend people do three dates in three totally different places,” he says. “Actually give people chances and try to do fun things that you would do anyway.”\n\nBut maybe it’s time to unburden yourself from the tyranny of rigid standards anyway. In one of his studies, Eastwick and his collaborators found that while participants tended to be romantically attracted to people who had the qualities they were looking for in an ideal partner, they were equally as attracted to people who had qualities other study participants listed as ideal. In other words, what we think we want in a romantic partner doesn’t matter so much.",

        "source": "https://www.vox.com/",
        "content": "Shortly after his inauguration, President Donald Trump took a set of thick, black permanent markers and signed a sweeping set of executive orders that took aim at everything from immigration and gender to TikTok and climate change. One of his first moves was to withdraw the US from the World Health Organization (WHO), the United Nations’ global health agency responsible for safeguarding and promoting health around the world since 1948.\n\nThe US is one of the WHO’s biggest funders, so any shortage of financial and political support will likely have major ramifications for global health efforts like eliminating malaria, improving access to high-quality health care, and reducing maternal mortality. While that may not directly matter to rich countries like the US that have the means to address their own health challenges, one of the WHO’s most important jobs is to help coordinate the international response to pandemics and outbreaks — events that can threaten everyone, regardless of borders, as we learned during Covid-19.\n\nTo Trump and his supporters, the WHO’s perceived failure on that job is one of the biggest reasons why the US should withdraw. Chief among Trump’s complaints are the WHO’s mishandling of the Covid-19 pandemic and other global health crises, its failure to reform, and its inability to demonstrate independence from powerful but authoritarian WHO member states, namely China.\n\nTrump’s decision has engendered plenty of criticism, including from experts who argue that the US could suffer if it loses access to vital WHO data on outbreaks. Still, the WHO is far from perfect, and even before Trump, scientists, think tanks, and government bodies have been pointing out the WHO’s myriad problems, from the lack of term limits for senior leadership to its massive budget for headquarters staff who are paid additional stipends (around $5,000 to $7,000 per month) to cover the cost of living in Geneva, one of the world’s most expensive cities.\n\nFuture Perfect Explore the big, complicated problems the world faces and the most efficient ways to solve them.

This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.\n\nI’ve seen the inefficiencies and mismanagement first hand: In my almost 10-year career as a global health epidemiologist, I have interacted with the WHO on many occasions, including, at times, coordinating with them to respond to disease outbreaks in Africa. Like Trump, my biggest complaint is that the organization has shown it is loath to reflect on and address its deficiencies — deficiencies that matter hugely when it has been given the monumental responsibility of safeguarding the world’s health. There has always been some intangible and unspoken sense that the WHO cannot be wrong and cannot be questioned, even after it was clear that it bungled certain aspects of the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nBut while the WHO is far from perfect, many of its flaws are symptoms of more fundamental challenges that go beyond how it is governed. Balancing the need to respond to international health threats while respecting national sovereignty means cooperation is a fine line — and it’s one that’s becoming harder for the agency to walk.\n\nFor the WHO to survive, it needs to improve. And for the US to have the best chances of protecting itself from future global health emergencies — especially as the Trump administration also works to dismantle the United States Agency for International Development, another key player in global health and development — it still needs the WHO. But it needs a better one.\n\nWhat Trump gets right — and wrong — about WHO\n\nIn his executive order, Trump reiterated many of the same issues he raised five years ago when he first threatened to withdraw from the WHO.\n\nOne of Trump’s biggest complaints was that the agency was too slow to alert the world of an emerging health threat in China and to move to contain its spread. Local newspapers had been reporting that a mysterious illness was spreading around Wuhan as early as November 17, 2019, a fact backed up by genetic analysis.\n\nBut Chinese health authorities didn’t alert the WHO — which the country was required to do under a legal framework called the International Health Regulations — to a spate of patients with an unknown pneumonia-like disease until December 31. By then, valuable time to contain the disease had been lost, though it is Beijing, not WHO, that is largely at fault for this lag.\n\nStill, while the WHO has limited if any power to compel China or any other country to act, the body should have been more proactive in November and December.\n\n“WHO has country offices, WHO has relationships with Ministries of Health. I would argue they certainly should have been aware this was happening,” said Ashish Jha, the dean of Brown University’s School of Public Health and the White House Covid-19 response coordinator during the Biden administration. “It was showing up in a lot of media, social media, and they should have pushed the government to say, what is this? What is going on here, and why don’t we know more about it?”\n\nWithin five days of learning about the unusual cases in China, the WHO had alerted its member states. But the WHO’s Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus traveled to China and, instead of confronting the government about its obfuscation, heralded Beijing’s response to the outbreak. And then the WHO consistently parrotted inaccurate information from the Chinese government — namely that the virus was not spreading from person to person — to the rest of the world for weeks.\n\nWhile the WHO proclaimed Covid-19 a public health emergency in late January, the messaging from the highest levels of WHO in those early months, when officials believed it was still possible that Covid could be contained, was too often confusing.\n\n“For the moment, we are not witnessing sustained and intensive community transmission of this virus, and we are not witnessing large-scale severe disease or death,” Ghebreyesus said during a briefing in late February. That was simply untrue. By that time, China had reported almost 80,000 cases and nearly 3,000 deaths from Covid-19, while 37 other countries were also reporting cases and deaths.\n\nIt also took the WHO two years, until late 2021, to finally acknowledge that Covid-19 was airborne, despite the mountain of evidence that scientists had amassed just six months after the first cases. A WHO spokesperson pushed back against this. “From January 2020, WHO said transmission was occurring between people when they breathe, talk (later sing) and especially in settings like hospitals, households and long term living facilities,” a spokesperson told Vox by email. While some of this confusion stemmed from longstanding disagreement on what exactly constitutes airborne spread, as late as March 2020 the WHO was still confidently tweeting, “FACT: #COVID19 is NOT airborne,” even as people were being infected through the air.\n\nWHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus at a daily press briefing on Covid-19 on March 11, 2020. Fabrice Coffrini/AFP via Getty Images\n\nTrump has also repeatedly criticized the WHO for not fully investigating the theory that the Covid-19 virus originated from virological work in a laboratory in Wuhan, rather than the conventional explanation that it began in wild animals sold at a meat market. The WHO sent a team of investigators to China in 2021, but Chinese scientists refused to discuss the so-called “lab leak” theory and then pressured investigators to dismiss the possibility altogether, according to the lead scientist on the team.\n\nAgain, though, the WHO has no authority to compel member states to turn over data or to cooperate on investigations. In fact, the WHO cannot even work inside a member state without that country’s permission. This is certainly a limitation of the WHO, but that’s because it answers to its member states — it is not some sort of supra-national health policy enforcement body.\n\nBeyond Covid, Trump has also griped that the WHO requires the US to make “unfairly onerous” payments, because US dues exceed the payment the organization demands of China, which has about four times the number of people as in the US.\n\nThe WHO is funded in two ways. The first is through assessed contributions, essentially membership dues, that each WHO member state is required to pay each year. The United Nations has a process for determining how much each country owes, but it’s essentially based on a country’s gross domestic product (GDP), not its population size.\n\nUS GDP in 2023 was about 1.5 times higher than China’s. That year, the US was required to pay the WHO $218 million, about two times more than China was assessed. So while the US does pay more than China, that difference is almost, though not quite, proportional to GDP.\n\nAssessed contributions, however, make up less than 20 percent of the WHO’s total funds. Its other funding comes from voluntary contributions from member states and non-governmental donors, such as the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.\n\nHere is where the US and China make vastly different contributions to the WHO. In 2023, China gave the organization about $40 million in voluntary contributions plus an additional $935,000 toward an emergency fund on top of its assessed contribution, while the US government donated more than $1 billion in voluntary funds and about $47 million toward the emergency fund. In all, that meant the US gave the WHO about $1.27 billion in 2023, about 18 percent of their total budget, while China gave about $156 million when you tally up all contributions. So while the US does give vastly more to the WHO than China, most of that is in voluntary donations.\n\nOf course, the US doesn’t have to pull out of the WHO altogether to rectify this situation — it could simply choose to donate less to the WHO, or mandate that its contributions come with reform. And the institution does need reform.\n\nWho’s at fault at WHO, explained\n\nCovid wasn’t the first time the WHO came under international fire. Take the 2014 Ebola outbreak in West Africa.\n\nThe organization was criticized back in 2014 for its long delay in declaring the outbreak a public health emergency, which hindered swift containment measures that could have prevented the virus from spreading across borders. From the start, the WHO fundamentally underestimated the severity of the outbreak — Ebola would go on to kill more than 11,000 people primarily in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone, with scattered cases reported in the US and several European countries, too. It ultimately took the WHO and its partners two years to get the Ebola outbreak under control.\n\nDespite the number of deaths, Ebola’s spread was limited largely because it isn’t a respiratory disease like Covid-19; rather it spreads through direct contact with an infected person’s bodily fluids. But that fact makes the failure to contain Ebola all the more glaring.\n\nTo be fair, all outbreak and pandemic responses are chaotic, especially when an entirely novel virus like Covid starts spreading. New information is constantly emerging, and a lot of different individuals and institutions have to come together to coordinate the flow of information and the rollout of interventions or recommendations, even as the full picture of the outbreak is inevitably unclear. Outbreaks often happen in far-flung areas that lack health care workers, hospitals, laboratories, and even roads and internet. Cultural practices, economic conditions, and a preexisting lack of trust in politicians and health officials further complicate responses.\n\nA health worker waits to handle a new unconfirmed Ebola patient at a newly built Doctors Without Borders-supported Ebola treatment center on November 7, 2018, in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. John Wessels/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe WHO also came under fire for delaying the dissemination of vaccines to help curb an ongoing mpox outbreak which began in May 2022 and spread to more than 120 countries before the virus became largely confined to central and eastern Africa.\n\nIn mid-2022, the US and EU approved an mpox vaccine made by the Danish pharmaceutical company Bavarian Nordic. But the WHO, which has its own process for reviewing and approving drugs and vaccines, did not approve the vaccine until September 2024.\n\nThat delay mattered. For one, other organizations like UNICEF and Gavi that play a critical role in procuring and distributing vaccines in developing countries require WHO approval before they can move forward with vaccination campaigns. Many developing countries do not have or have only pared-down versions of drug regulatory agencies so they also rely on the WHO to approve medicines before they roll them out in their countries, explained Rogério Gaspar, the director of WHO’s Department of Regulation and Prequalification. And so when it came to the mpox vaccine, many countries — especially in Africa, where the outbreak was most severe — were waiting for the green light from WHO before they could roll out the needed vaccines, even though the US and Europe had already approved them.\n\nThe WHO blames the long delay on Bavarian Nordic. The WHO claimed that the company did not submit the mpox vaccine for review until August 2024, some two years after the mpox outbreak had begun, and that once it did, the WHO approved it within two weeks, according to a WHO spokesperson.\n\nBut Bavarian Nordic refutes this timeline. A spokesperson told Vox that the pharmaceutical company first met with WHO in August 2022 and submitted a dossier on the vaccine in May 2023. The dossier they submitted to the WHO contained the same information that led to the European Medicines Agency, the equivalent of the FDA, approving the vaccine for use in Europe. It isn’t clear why the WHO didn’t act sooner. Back in August 2024, the WHO director of health product policy and standards, Deusdedit Mubangizi, told reporters that there wasn’t enough data to support its approval. But now, it seems, the WHO has changed its story, ducking accountability once again.\n\nThe entire process has frustrated some public health experts. “It’s almost like WHO saying, hey, we’re not responsible for our own process,” Jha said. “This is the lack of accountability. It’s everybody else’s fault.”\n\n(A WHO spokesperson pointed out that member states did not have to wait until the WHO’s review was complete to buy and distribute the vaccines.)\n\nOver the years, the WHO has tried to address its critics through a laundry list of reform efforts — and there has been some improvement. Between 2020 and 2022, smaller Ebola outbreaks in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Uganda, and Guinea have been contained in just a few months. That’s a hopeful signal the organization has potentially improved not only its own ability to quickly respond to outbreaks, but has also helped build member states’ capacity to detect and contain health emergencies. It also helps that since 2014, scientists have also developed a number of vaccines and treatments that would certainly help quell an outbreak.\n\nStill, while there were improvements in the Ebola response that can be attributable to the WHO, the organization’s dismal performance during the Covid-19 pandemic suggests that these reforms remain insufficient. And the bigger issue is that the WHO simply cannot admit its mistakes. The organization has still not come out and listed the errors it made during the Covid-19 pandemic. Though the WHO convened an independent panel of experts to review the international response to Covid-19, the panel’s reports largely focus on the failures of WHO member states and say little about the WHO’s own shortcomings.\n\n“There is very little interest at WHO in introspection,” Jha said. “There’s very little interest in WHO in figuring out how to do better.”\n\nAnd given how enormous — and how difficult — the WHO’s responsibilities are, that introspection is needed.\n\nThe WHO’s impossible task\n\nThe WHO’s mission is to foster global public health, but what that means in practice depends on what counts as global. As it stands, its 194 member states (193 without the US) have tasked the organization with outbreak prevention and response and other responsibilities that impact nearly all countries. That includes setting international health standards and collecting data on an ever-increasing list of health priorities ranging from maternal and child health and nutrition to sanitation and clean water. But some of the WHO’s work focuses on supplementing national health programs and filling gaps that benefit individual nations — specifically those with the least resources — rather than the world as a whole.\n\nThose responsibilities fit poorly with a Trump administration that is bringing an America First approach to health — and other countries are taking notice. Argentina has announced that it also plans to withdraw from the WHO, while Italian politicians have introduced legislation that would do the same. Other European countries have slashed global health aid budgets in recent years.\n\nThat the US cannot remain a WHO member while also consciously putting itself first highlights a friction in the field. Is global health about containing dangerous outbreaks so they don’t breach your own border and pose a threat to national security? Or is global health about saving lives and improving the health of everyone, regardless of their nationality? Can competing nation-states like China and the US set aside their political warfare and come together on one issue — health — or has the time for international cooperation finally ended?\n\nOne way to address that contradiction would be for the WHO to scale back on the number of health areas it is involved in and focus primarily on issues that actually transcend borders. This would include infectious diseases — but only those that present a truly global threat.\n\nThe WHO itself puts together a list of pathogens with the potential to cause a pandemic. It includes familiar diseases such as West Nile, Zika, Ebola, and Covid-19. Many of these have already caused deadly outbreaks and pandemics. Something else that transcends borders: products such as cigarettes or baby formula. The WHO might also have a role to play in regulating the safety of these products, according to Jesse Bump, a public health professor at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.\n\nThis recommendation is not to say that newborn and maternal health or access to clean water are not important, life-saving services that everyone on Earth should have. But these represent more national health priorities for the countries dealing with these issues and not truly global threats.\n\nWithout some form of additional support, paring down the WHO’s focus areas would have fatal consequences for some places. Particularly in low-income countries, the WHO serves as a lifeline of essential health services and often fills many of the responsibilities that national health agencies in wealthy nations like the US handle, a WHO spokesperson explained.\n\nOf course, the fact that the WHO is tasked with addressing so many different areas of health fundamentally reflects both the massive health disparities around the world and the way the organization is funded. Consider the health challenges that a country like the US faces compared to many developing countries. In places like Niger, Papua New Guinea, Chad, and the DRC, more than half of the population does not have access to clean drinking water or basic water services. More than 50 percent of people in Somalia and Haiti are malnourished. In southern Africa, HIV is still a leading cause of death; in parts of West Africa, malaria is a leading cause of death.\n\nIn much of the global north, by contrast, these health challenges are virtually nonexistent, and where they are present, it’s because of national priorities, not a lack of national resources.\n\nConsider as well the drastic difference in the health workforce around the world. In many low- and middle-income counties, there are major shortages of doctors and nurses, not to mention specialists such as neurologists or surgeons. In more than 50 countries, mostly in Africa and the Middle East, there are fewer than one doctor per 1,000 people in the entire country. The US has almost four times as many doctors per capita.\n\nWhat this means is that the state of health and health care is so grossly unequal across countries that one organization cannot possibly address them all while also ensuring that every member states benefits equally from their WHO membership.\n\nAnd the benefits are unequal, at least in strict financial terms. Last year, countries in Africa and the WHO’s Eastern Mediterranean region — which includes parts of North Africa and the Middle East including some very poor and conflict-afflicted member states such as Afghanistan, Yemen, Syria, Somalia, and Sudan — received $2.9 billion, almost half of the WHO’s $6.8 billion budget. The region of the Americas, which includes the US, received the least amount of funding, just over $300 million. But even here, it’s important to understand that the inequality in who gives and who gets from the WHO is largely a function of the fact that some regions and countries simply have a massively greater need for international aid.\n\nIt’s important to remember that the WHO has limited control over its own agenda. It is member states themselves who vote on the organization’s scope of work and approve its budget. Beyond the required payments, countries and other donors can earmark their voluntary funds for specific causes. The US, for instance, earmarks more than half of its funds for epidemic prevention or response and polio eradication while Nordic countries typically focus their funding on maternal health.\n\nThis approach to funding helps the WHO account for individual member state priorities but also allows countries to use funds to influence the WHO’s scope of work. Ultimately, it means that the WHO has little choice but to expand and scatter its workforce to make sure every country’s pet projects get completed.\n\nIs there any room for WHO in America First?\n\nShort of remaking the WHO into an institution under the leadership of the US government, it’s difficult to imagine that any amount of reform will satisfy the current administration. The organization’s mission is completely misaligned with Trump’s “America First” agenda. In the WHO, as in most other UN international bodies, America does not come first. It has the same vote as every other member state, even though the US contributes more money than any other country.\n\nBut despite its many shortcomings, the US needs the WHO. Only an international health agency such as the WHO can overcome the nuanced complexities of economic competition, geopolitics, and even outright war, to respond to global health emergencies. The WHO serves as a bridge for sharing information and even biological samples of pathogens, which is critical for understanding how a disease will spread and for developing medicines and vaccines.\n\nTrump’s vision of global health or public health, for that matter, is unclear. Just as unclear is whether Trump’s executive order on the WHO is even legal. Members of Congress have asked Trump to reconsider. Though the full impact of the US withdrawal will probably not be felt for about a year, the WHO’s director-general has already ordered a hiring freeze, mandated that some contracts be renegotiated, and directed staff in country offices to provide only essential support.\n\nAs the WHO adapts to a future without US investment, the Trump administration is also gutting other key global health efforts. This month, thousands of USAID staff were laid off, leaving only about 300 employees of a once 10,000-person workforce. It isn’t yet clear what global health areas the drastically smaller agency will work on — or whether it will exist at all — and it wouldn’t be surprising if the administration goes after other global health initiatives like the ones led by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nAmerican retreat from both the WHO and its own broader global health efforts paradoxically makes the case for WHO reform all the more important. Many complaints about how the WHO does its work are valid, especially given its reluctance to confront mistakes. But much of what it is criticized for is built into the way the institution itself operates or reflects a world with hugely varying health problems and national abilities to meet them. Still, the WHO must do better because it is the only organization uniquely placed to bridge diplomatic tensions and address international health threats. The most hopeful read on Trump’s action will shock the bureaucracy into action, and lead the Trump administration to ultimately realize that an American-first approach must include the WHO.",

It’s a good idea to reduce outdoor exercise on hazardous air days to cut down on exposure. Kamil Krzaczynski/AFP via Getty Images\n\nWe’re making this story accessible to all readers as a public service. At Vox, our mission is to help everyone access essential information that empowers them. Support our journalism by becoming a member today.\n\nIt’s not enough to trust the senses to know when it’s a bad air day. Well before you can see or smell smoke, it can start wreaking havoc on the lungs.\n\nThat haze you can see and smell on a particularly polluted day is made of ozone and fine particulate matter.\n\nFine particulate matter, known as PM2.5 (the 2.5 microns describes its size, 30 times smaller than the width of a human hair) can embed in the cells of the lung and the bloodstream, aggravating inflammation, asthma, heart disease, and mental health. And ozone causes similar damage. In the stratosphere, ozone blocks ultraviolet radiation from the sun, but at ground level it can cause shortness of breath and damage to respiratory tissue.\n\nBoth pollutants can affect the entire body in all stages of life: young and old, and even the developing fetus. They come from sources as varied as the tailpipe of a truck, your neighbor’s barbecue, coal plant, or an incinerator. PM2.5 is capable of traveling thousands of miles across the world on the wind — taking, for instance, about five days to reach the US from China.\n\nThe dose makes the poison; there is a difference between moderately bad air and really bad air. Public health experts recommend monitoring changes in air quality as often as you check the weather. But you should also know some basic facts to help you determine your own sensitivity to air pollution and the appropriate action to take.\n\nWhat is the Air Quality Index?\n\nThe Air Quality Index, set by the Environmental Protection Agency, is your guide to how bad the air quality is outdoors. The data that goes into the Air Quality Index comes from 5,000 air monitors across the country, including local, state, tribal, and federal reporting.\n\nThere are actually two AQIs for air quality, one for particulate matter and one for ozone, but when you see just one AQI, you’re looking at whatever pollutant is the higher of the two.\n\nYou can find the latest AQI on the EPA’s AirNow website or by downloading its AirNow app. Weather apps are often using propriety data from a company called BreezoMeter to determine AQI and forecasts. These numbers are based on EPA monitoring but may not be identical to the EPA’s AQI, though they should be in the same ballpark. Outside the US, air pollution monitoring can vary widely depending on the country, so AQIs reported around the world may also be pulling from a mix of computer modeling and satellite data.\n\nThere are some important drawbacks to the AQI. It tries to distill a lot of information into one datapoint, and it depends on air monitors often placed near cities and not close to industrial polluters. Since air pollution can vary widely even over short distances — think a busy highway versus a quiet, tree-lined road — the air could be worse if you’re near a pollution source. Communities of color are systematically exposed to more pollution from industrial sources and transportation, and the AQI doesn’t do a good job capturing that disparity.\n\nThousands of air quality monitors pull data from around the country to calculate the Air Quality Index. While the monitoring captures an accurate high-level view of pollution levels, it doesn’t capture pollution that can vary widely block to block. Hyoung Chang/Denver Post via Getty Images\n\nWho really needs to pay attention to the AQI?\n\nIdeally, everyone should monitor the AQI. EPA experts liken it to understanding the weather.\n\nPeople have different sensitivities to air pollutants, just as people can have different temperatures they’re comfortable at. They can even be more uncomfortable with one type of pollutant than another.\n\nBut the EPA breaks out its recommendations for a general population group and a sensitive population. The sensitive group is actually quite large. If you have asthma or COPD, you fall in this category, but so do young children (under age 5), older adults (over 65), and pregnant people.\n\n“The younger the child is, the faster their breathing, and so pound for pound, they are breathing more air pollution,” said Lisa Patel, a Stanford professor of pediatrics and an executive director of the Medical Society Consortium on Climate and Health. “We use 5 as a cut-off for particular vulnerabilities because age 0-5 is a period of really rapid lung growth. And so exposure to those toxins so early is particularly concerning, but it’s also concerning across the entire spectrum of ages.”\n\nEven if you don’t fall into one of the sensitive categories, an EPA official explained that the public should still “know their number.” The AQI is based on large population studies, so it doesn’t necessarily help you understand your individual risk. By monitoring the AQI regularly and paying close attention to any symptoms, you can get a feel for the level at which you should take proactive action.\n\nWhat are the six levels of air quality? And when should I be concerned?\n\nThe EPA breaks the Air Quality Index into a few categories with different recommendations.\n\nGreen (0–50): The air is safe to breathe.\n\nYellow (51–100): The air quality is considered moderate, except for the most sensitive groups.\n\nOrange (101–150): Sensitive groups should reduce heavy exertion outside or take more breaks, and people with asthma and heart disease should watch for symptoms. The rest of the population may be fine.\n\nRed (151–200): The air is unhealthy for everyone. Sensitive groups should avoid being active outdoors, while everyone else should reduce their time outdoors.\n\nPurple (201–300): The air is very unhealthy for everyone. Everyone should consider moving their activities inside.\n\nMaroon (301 and above): This is the highest level — hazardous — and anyone can be at risk. Everyone should avoid physical activity outdoors, and if you’re sensitive, you should remain indoors.\n\nDoctors and public health experts urge people to monitor any symptoms as pollution levels climb, especially once the AQI is in the orange and red range.\n\nThe symptoms to watch can vary. A surefire sign to take it easy (limiting activity outdoors and potentially seeking medical help) is shortness of breath. Coughing, discomfort, and tightness of the chest can all signal issues with breathing.\n\nOther symptoms could be less obvious, throat irritation, fatigue, a stuffy nose or a headache. An EPA expert explained she feels a side stitch when exercising on a bad air day.\n\nIn infants, Patel suggests to look out for grunting noises, bobbing heads, and using chest muscles to breathe as warning signs. Kids who have asthma should have an asthma action plan set with a health provider on using an inhaler.\n\nIt’s important to pay attention to these symptoms in both adults and children while regularly checking the AQI level at which you start to feel discomfort. Starting this now will help you in the future when you need to decide what precautions to take and when.\n\nWhat are the precautions I should take outdoors, and when should I take action?\n\nThe AQI is most confusing when it falls into the yellow, orange, and red ranges.\n\nIf you are sensitive to air pollution, then you want to reduce your exercise and heavy exertion outside once the AQI hits orange. The entire population should start taking precautions when it is in the red territory. You might even want to reconsider spending extensive time outside at these higher levels, and don an N95 or KN95 mask if you do need to be outside (cloth masks will not protect you from PM2.5).\n\nIt helps to think about reduction in terms of dosage. You can cut your time outside, your exertion level, or both. If you reduce a 30 minute walk to 15 minutes, you’re cutting your exposure to the pollution by half. If you sit on your porch instead of going for a walk or run, you’re also cutting down how much pollution you inhale.\n\nWhen is air pollution at its worse?\n\nThe time of year, and even the time of day, can matter immensely for air quality.\n\nOzone is typically at its worst in warmer months, between April and October in the US. It needs sunlight to trigger its chemical reactions, so late afternoons and early evenings can be smoggier than the mornings. Emissions that come from the tailpipes of cars and burning fossil fuels interact to form ozone that can build up to dangerous concentrations depending on geography and weather patterns.\n\nParticulate matter’s worst months are usually peak wildfire season, so late summer and fall. Again, though, there are no strict rules here. Wildfires are no longer contained to predictable seasons due largely to climate change, as the East Coast experienced when Canadian wildfires caused smoggy extremes in early June. Other sources of PM2.5 include barbecues and fireworks, making July Fourth and the days that follow worse for air quality.\n\nTracey Holloway, an atmospheric scientist at the University of Wisconsin-Madison who works with NASA, also explained that, unlike ozone, PM2.5 “comes in different flavors.” She explained, “There are some situations where PM2.5 is highest at night because it’s trapped [an inversion where the ground is cooler], and there’s some situations where PM2.5 is highest in the middle of the day because it’s cooked up by the sun.”\n\nThough experts focus mostly on the two main pollutants of concern in air pollution, PM2.5 and ozone, there are other substances that can hitch a ride with this pollution. Patel, the pediatrician, said wildfire smoke is especially toxic. Burning trees can release more mercury in the air because of how the pollutant has settled on surfaces. And when fires hit houses and towns, they burn up plastics and petrochemicals, releasing more carcinogenic and metallic substances into the atmosphere.\n\nOne tip is to not dose yourself unnecessarily with pollution when air quality is bad. A hazardous air day is a poor time to fire up the barbecue or gas stove. You could swap out the gas appliance entirely for an induction burner. Patrick T. Fallon/AFP via Getty Images\n\nShould I be concerned indoors?\n\nStaying indoors helps, but there are some additional actions to consider.\n\nIf you have central air conditioning or can access a building with air conditioning, that helps filter out pollutants. Also, HEPA air filters cut down on particulate matter and don’t have to cost a lot. The University of Washington has a manual for building your own low-cost air filter for roughly $20, which can dramatically lower fine particles.\n\nSince you’re getting a hefty dose of air pollution from the outdoors, it’s even more important not to expose yourself unnecessarily inside. Former Director of the Center for Climate, Health, and the Global Environment at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and pediatrician Aaron Bernstein said people do this in ways they don’t realize. They might idle their cars in attached garages, or use fragranced and ozone-forming products, or run wood- or gas-burning stoves and fireplaces that pollute indoor air.\n\nWhat can my community do to reduce air pollution?\n\nThe No. 1 action we can take for better air is addressing the root cause, not just the symptoms. After all, not everyone has control over their outdoor activities, and some communities and outdoor workers face astronomically higher risk from pollution than others. White Americans contribute more to air pollution through their consumption of goods and services, yet Black and Hispanic Americans tend to live in neighborhoods with lower air quality.\n\nOne of the challenges in tackling climate change is that the carbon we’re releasing now will stick around in the atmosphere for hundreds of years. That’s fortunately not the case with particulate matter and ozone. They settle in a matter of days, so air can clear almost immediately once we address the sources of pollution. The world experienced how fast the air can improve when road and air travel came to sudden standstill early in the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\n“A lot of air pollution comes from controllable sources,” Holloway said. “When we implement changes to our transportation, industries, energy systems, and roadways, all of those can immediately improve our air quality. Certainly, we can’t just make a policy change and have wildfires go away. But for many other sources of air pollution, there are a lot of available technologies to make the air cleaner.”\n\nDespite worsening wildfires, air quality has on the whole grown cleaner, especially within the United States over the last 40 years, as states have reduced major industrial sources of smog. Environmental regulations have worked as intended to clean up the worst polluters.\n\n“We have already made huge improvements in having cleaner vehicles and trucks, cleaner power plants, and cleaner industrial facilities,” said Holloway. “And these have been deliberate choices that we’ve made.” Holloway believes “this isn’t a hopeless situation” as long as society moves to tackling the sources of the problem.\n\nWhat other resources are out there?\n\nThis story was originally published on June 28, 2023.",

Previously, she wrote for the Daily Beast and contributed to several publications, including Vulture, W Magazine, and Bitch Media.\n\nSometimes the best advice is the most straightforward. This assumption seems to summarize the appeal of TikTok’s favorite armchair psychologist at the moment, Mel Robbins. Her extremely basic tips for tackling life and “getting anything you want” have made her the go-to self-help queen in our increasingly stressful times.\n\nThe motivational speaker, author, and podcast host has become an A-lister in the virtual advice landscape thanks to her practical approach to productivity and relationships. Even if you haven’t listened to The Mel Robbins Podcast, or bought one of Robbins’s books, you’ve probably been exposed to her work online. She’s the person getting women on social media to make their beds every morning and high-five themselves in the mirror. Most popular is her viral two-word phrase, “let them.”\n\nThe advice is as simple as it sounds: Your teenager wants to dye their hair? Let them. Your spouse is wearing a shirt you don’t like? Let them. You think your co-workers are gossiping about you? Let them.\n\n“Let them” theory has quickly become Robbins’s calling card. It’s the premise of her latest book — The Let Them Theory: A Life-Changing Tool That Millions of People Can’t Stop Talking About, released this past December — and frequently invoked and (sometimes parodied) by her fans on social media.\n\nThis catchphrase has won the attention of Oprah, TikTok influencers, and regular people posting about their relationship to the concept online.\n\nNot everyone is buying what she’s selling, however. To some critics, an empire built on obvious and overly generic advice, from a woman without a social work or psychology degree, reads as another self-help scam, and the mantra like a gimmick.\n\nWhile Robbins has largely managed to evade the cynicism and scandals that emerge when a new self-styled expert blows up online, it’s hard not to notice that her guidance falls into a familiar self-help trap.\n\nA burnt-out lawyer with a knack for public speaking\n\nLike many self-designated experts on life, Robbins has performed a plethora of impressive jobs and leadership roles outside the realm of psychology. After graduating from Boston College Law School in 1994, she worked as a criminal defense attorney for the Legal Aid Society in New York City, and at a large firm in Boston. She’s led life-coaching programs at big corporations. She’s launched (and sold) her own businesses and hosted a call-in radio show. In 2013, she was a legal analyst for CNN during the George Zimmerman trial.\n\nBut back in 2009, at the age of 41, Robbins felt she had “failed at life,” as she tells it in The Let Them Theory. In the midst of a recession, she and her husband were unemployed and operating a failing business, respectively. She was drowning in debt — $800,000, she claims — and facing house liens, while avoiding her problems with alcohol. As Robbins would repeat again and again when recounting her come-up story, she was so anxious and overwhelmed that she couldn’t get out of bed in the morning.\n\nIt was during this time, watching a NASA launch on TV, that Robbins came up with her “five-second rule,” which would later become the premise and title of her 2017 book. The mental exercise is as rudimentary as it sounds: Count down from 5 — as if you’re a rocket — to launch yourself into whatever action you need to complete, whether that’s paying your bills, going to the gym, or, in Robbins’s case, simply getting out of bed. “Using 5-4-3-2-1, I pushed through the excuses, the anxiety, the overwhelm, and the fear,” she writes in The Let Them Theory. “Step by step, day by day, week by week, I slowly took the actions that put my life and career back on track.”\n\nSheinelle Jones, Jenna Bush Hager, and Mel Robbins on the Today show on September 27, 2023. Nathan Congleton/NBC via Getty Images\n\nIn 2010, Robbins published her first book, Stop Saying You’re Fine: The No-BS Guide to Getting What You Want. The next year, the nonprofit TED invited her to give a lecture at one of their first-ever TEDx conferences in San Francisco. The talk, titled “How To Stop Screwing Yourself Over,” became an early hit for the platform, and currently has 33 million views. In the video, she uses ideas from her book to help audience members overcome complacency. She spreads her notably uncomplicated concepts over 20 minutes, filling the time with hypothetical scenarios, funny anecdotes about her family, and a dose of scientific research. More than any piece of advice, Robbins’s public speaking skills and affable, Midwestern persona stand out. She’s magnetic and motivating, rallying her audience out of feeling stuck, able to balance a sense of comfort with tough love.\n\nFor Robbins, this down-home practicality is the point. “There is an obsession with being smart, I think, in the thought leadership space,” Robbins told the New York Times last year. “And I would rather be useful.”\n\nSo is the playbook for Robbins’s career. While she has a knack for sharing relatable, amusing anecdotes about her own life, she’s largely a messenger of other people’s well-tested ideas and wisdom. In Time, she describes herself more like an advice curator: “I am on a mission to find as many stories and pieces of science and research and tools that a person can use to make their life a little better.”\n\nThat’s her methodology on The Mel Robbins Podcast, launched three years ago, where she talks to a wide range of experts and people who inspire her about how to tackle life’s hurdles and reach their goals. It’s also where she debuted her now signature theory for handling other people. Per a 2022 episode, “let them” was originally uttered to Robbins by her daughter after Robbins tried to micro-manage her son’s prom experience. Now, Robbins instructs her followers to stop wasting time trying to control other people by repeating the pithy saying.\n\nControversially, the phrase has been met with plagiarism allegations. In an interview in the Substack newsletter Sage Words, writer Cassie Phillips accused Robbins of cribbing and capitalizing off her viral 2022 “Let Them” poem, which preaches the same idea of radical acceptance.\n\nAn illusion of freedom and simplicity for stressed-out women\n\nIn the self-help guru space, it’s hard to be entirely new. There are only so many ways to empower people. Robbins’s patchwork philosophy feels like a cross between the more emotion-based work of professor Brené Brown and Tony Robbins’s more spiritually macho leadership advice. What this gives her, though, is a platform designed for women who know that they can’t have it all — but are still willing to try.\n\nRobbins’s target audience is markedly goal-oriented, career-minded women, including mothers, trying to optimize every part of their lives. There’s an assumption that her listeners have the time and privilege to keep adding self-improvement rituals, like running a marathon or adopting a perfect sleep schedule, to their plate. She often assures her followers that it’s okay if they occasionally fail at their goals. But the message is that they should constantly be wanting more for themselves, whether it’s more friends, more money, or a fitter body.\n\nAuthor Virginia Sole-Smith compared Robbins’s teachings to diet culture on a recent episode of her Burnt Toast podcast. She says that, like most diet plans, Robbins doesn’t seem to anticipate her followers ever reaching a slow-down stage where they aren’t working as hard.\n\n“There’s no profit in [Robbins’s] followers achieving stasis,” says Sole-Smith. “That’s what it comes down to, in diet culture, in perfection culture. Mel Robbins is never going to give you permission to reach stasis because then why would you buy her next book?”\n\nRae Jones, a therapist at New York-based The Expansive Group, says that the self-help industry as a whole relies on consumers constantly feeling inadequate in order to make a profit. “The industry profits off of people feeling poorly about themselves and believing they need to change or fix themselves in some way, and therefore will absolutely encourage the very type of thinking that keeps the self-help industry in business and making millions,” they said.\n\nStill, Robbins’s advice thrives under the guise of simplicity and accessibility. It makes sense that Robbins’s nuggets have penetrated short-video platforms, like Instagram and TikTok, where she has 8.4 million and 3.9 million followers, respectively. TikTok is overflowing with so-called “hacks” that all too often make whatever you’re trying to do even more stressful and complicated. Compared to the grueling workout challenges and elaborate morning routines that can easily flood one’s feed, Robbins telling women to high-five their bathroom mirror and make their beds every morning may feel like some sort of reprieve. But she hardly seems to be advocating a stress-free, content life.\n\nWhile “let them” has become her trademark, achieving radical nonchalance certainly isn’t the core of her ideology. Scroll through her Instagram, and you’re inundated with an onslaught of tips and life hacks on bettering oneself — often presented in small numbers (“3 Simple Ways to Get The Love You Want”; “4 Nighttime Habits To Feel Energized”) to give the impression that they’re not as overwhelming. She encourages people to control, regiment, and perfect virtually every aspect of their own lives. As Robbins’s profile has grown, so has the range of topics she’s eager to discuss. In addition to her usual motivational fodder, she has podcast episodes dedicated to boosting your metabolism, decreasing alcohol consumption, and intermittent fasting.\n\n“As an upper-middle class, suburban, white mom, I understand why she’s speaking to my people,” says Sole-Smith. “We’ve been trained that the way we uphold all of that privilege is to keep going, going, going, achieve, achieve, achieve — and not actually look around and question the systems that are forcing us into all of these toxic standards.”\n\nTo keep Robbins’s utility at the top of viewers’ minds and feeds, she has to find more hypothetical problems to fix and areas of her followers’ lives to address. This quickly becomes repetitive, especially on her podcast, where she’ll platform numerous experts and approaches on the same issues.\n\nThis might be the conflicting mindset of an overachiever whose hard work didn’t prevent them from collecting tons of debt and having to rebuild their life. While she preaches indifference regarding other people, she can’t help but perpetuate the core principles of hustle culture.",

He worked at Time magazine for 15 years as a foreign correspondent in Asia, a climate writer, and an international editor, and he wrote a book on existential risk.\n\nSandra Lindsay, left, a nurse in New York, received the first Covid-19 shot on December 14, 2020, in New York City. Mark Lennihan/Pool/Getty Images\n\nFor most people, the Covid-19 pandemic, which officially began five years ago this month, marked their first encounter with case counts and N-95 masks and lockdown orders.\n\nNot me, though.\n\nI was a young reporter for Time magazine in Hong Kong in early spring 2003, when we started getting reports about a strange new sickness spreading in southern China, just across the border. On March 15, exactly 22 years ago today, that sickness was given a name by the World Health Organization: severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS).\n\nThe SARS outbreak didn’t get much attention in the US because the country only had a small number of cases, and the worst of it overlapped with the invasion of Iraq. But back in Hong Kong, which became an epicenter of the outbreak, we had no idea when or if it would end.\n\nLooking back on those days now, it feels like a dry run for what the entire world would experience less than two decades later with another coronavirus. Overnight, all of Hong Kong wore surgical masks. Airports, hotels, and restaurants were abandoned.\n\nAt the Time offices in the city, editors sweating through uncomfortable N-95 masks debated sending some staff to work from home, to keep the magazine going if our building were to be closed. I interviewed scientists about the possibility of a vaccine or treatment, and was told that if one were needed, it would certainly take years for it to be developed.\n\nRelated Trump is running from his biggest health care success\n\nWe ended up getting lucky with SARS. The coronavirus that caused it turned out to be far less infectious than it first appeared, and the outbreak ended up petering out — though not before more than 8,000 people were sickened and 774 died around the world.\n\nWith Covid, of course, we were not that lucky. More than 7 million people have been confirmed to have died from Covid so far, a number that is both still rising and almost surely an undercount. The political, social, and educational side effects of the pandemic were enormous, and are still playing out. It was, simply put, a global catastrophe — one of the few events that is truly worthy of that name.\n\nSo why in the world would I put Covid in a newsletter that’s supposed to be about good news?\n\nA Covid pandemic before 2020 would have been far worse\n\nHaving lived through and covered both SARS and Covid, I sometimes like to run a thought experiment: How would we have responded back in 2003 if SARS had turned out to be as dangerous as Covid?\n\nThink back to 2003. Smartphones didn’t exist, and even laptops were less common. Video-calling was essentially nonexistent — if you told someone you were going to “Zoom” with them, you would have gotten very strange looks.\n\nWhat this all means is that remote work and remote schooling and telemedicine — which, as problematic as they all turned out to be, did keep the economy, education, and medical care moving forward during the pandemic — would have essentially been impossible. By one estimate, without remote work, US GDP would have declined twice as much as it ultimately did in that first year of the pandemic. All those Zoom meetings and cloud documents were a literal economic lifeline.\n\nOr take the virus itself. It was months after the first cases of SARS before the coronavirus causing it was successfully identified by scientists. I still remember visiting Hong Kong University’s Queen Mary Hospital in April 2003, and peering through an electron microscope at the virus’s distinctive, sun-like corona. In Covid, thanks to vast improvements in the speed of genetic sequencing, full genomes of the virus were being distributed well before the world was fully aware of what Covid was.\n\nOr vaccines. In 2003, early work on mRNA vaccine technology was only beginning, and BioNTech — the company that was responsible for the groundbreaking research on mRNA vaccines — wouldn’t be founded for another five years..\n\nBefore Covid, it took anywhere from five to 15 years — if not longer — to develop a vaccine for a new virus. Had we needed one during SARS, we would have almost certainly been in for a long wait. But during Covid, the first vaccine candidates were produced by Pfizer-BioNTech on March 2, 2020 — less than two months after work on the vaccines had begun. Sandra Lindsay, a nurse in New York, received the first Covid shot on December 14, 2020, less than nine months later.\n\nAnd while advances in science were the first necessary steps, the US government, for all its flaws, acted with impressive urgency and ambition.\n\nWe never would have received vaccines as quickly without the genius of Operation Warp Speed. By supporting the simultaneous development of multiple vaccine candidates, the parallel execution of multiple stages of vaccine development and trials, and by guaranteeing a market for the vaccines with billions of dollars, Operation Warp Speed lived up to is name.\n\nBeyond the science, the bipartisan relief bills kept poverty from spiking during those first, terrible months of the pandemic. In fact, poverty actually dropped in 2021 compared to the years before the pandemic, with child poverty falling by more than half.\n\nDon’t forget what we accomplished\n\nI realize that almost no one wants to look back at the Covid pandemic, and certainly not with pride. The subsequent virus variants and new waves increasingly evaded even our best vaccines, keeping the pandemic going for years while eroding belief in them. Division over the public health decisions made during the pandemic, from mask requirements to school closures, still linger, poisoning the political atmosphere. Perhaps hundreds of millions of people are experiencing the effects of long Covid, their every day a reminder of the pandemic’s toll. The collective trauma we suffered is still with us.\n\nAnd yet, I worry that all that pain and anger will cause us to neglect the amazing accomplishments of those years. Not just the scientists and officials who got us those vaccines in record time, but the doctors and nurses who toiled endless hours on the front lines of the pandemic, or the essential workers who kept things going while the rest of us isolated. My fear is not just that we’ll forget that heroism, but that when the next pandemic comes — as it inevitably will — we’ll forget that we have shown the ability and the will to fight it.\n\nOn the five-year anniversary of the pandemic, there has been no shortage of articles about what we got wrong during Covid — and yes, in retrospect, we got many, many things wrong. I realize “it could have been worse” isn’t exactly the most stirring rallying cry after something as catastrophic as Covid.\n\nBut it’s still true, and we shouldn’t overlook the people whose work ensured it wasn’t.\n\nA version of this story originally appeared in the Good News newsletter.

Previously, Sean was Vox’s weekend editor.\n\nPresident Donald Trump waits outside of the West Wing before welcoming King Abdullah II of Jordan to the White House in Washington, DC, on February 11, 2025. Jim Watson/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe spate of federal firings that stretched throughout last week escalated last Friday, and continued through the holiday weekend.\n\nNearly all of those fired were “probationary” employees, a status usually conferred on new workers, those that switch agencies, and the recently promoted, that provides fewer protections against removal.\n\nReports have been unclear about exactly how many people were fired and where. However, we do know some details:\n\nThe Trump administration has argued these cuts (and more) are needed to slash federal spending, and to shrink a bloated bureaucracy.\n\nHowever, the latest reduction in force is unlikely to provide taxpayers with major savings, and could jeopardize the government’s mandate to protect its citizens.\n\nTake, for instance, the VA’s claim that its terminations will save $98 million per year. That is a lot of money to me, but it represents only 0.00145 percent of the $6.75 trillion the federal government spent in the 2024 fiscal year. Celebrating that cut is like me jumping for joy because I managed to save a tenth of a penny by foregoing something at the grocery store. Sure it’s money saved, but not really an appreciable sum.\n\nThe point is — and it’s a point others have made — the US will need to make massive cuts, on the trillion, not million, dollar scale if it really wants to appreciably tighten its belt. To do that, it would need to slash spending on expensive programs like Medicare, Medicaid, and the defense.\n\nNow to the other claim: that the government is too big.\n\nMuch like with the VA’s savings, those let go represent a fraction of the federal workforce. If you combine the latest round of layoffs with previous rounds — and even with the roughly 75,000 people who took the government’s buyout offer — then just under 4 percent of the government’s 2.4 million person workforce has been cut.\n\nThat means the government is still pretty big. The good news about that is it means government services are unlikely to keel over tomorrow. The worry is about the day after tomorrow.\n\nWe’re not out of fire season, and fire experts and Forest Service workers are expressing great concern that they won’t have the manpower to keep communities safe.\n\n“It’s just going to be a disaster for the wildfire response this season,” one Forest Service firefighter told Stateline.\n\nSpring break and summer travel season are coming in fast too. The FAA was clear that it didn’t fire any air traffic controllers, but, as you read in this newsletter a few weeks ago, aviation experts believe our flight systems are seriously overtaxed.\n\n“Right now, flight operations are like a rubber band,” the University of North Dakota’s Daniel Adjekum told me recently. “And we keep pulling it.”\n\nAnd it’s not just a matter of fire or flying: a disaster could happen at any time requiring FEMA’s full attention; the CDC might need to be called into action over a new pandemic — federal agencies were already struggling to get bird flu under control.\n\nIt’s impossible to tell you right now what the effects of these cuts will be, and if things will go as badly as some now claim. But the worry is, if things do go south due to lack of personnel, it will be too late — avoidable tragedy will have struck.",

        "content": "is a correspondent at Vox, where he covers the impacts of social and economic policies. He is the author of “Within Our Means,” a biweekly newsletter on ending poverty in America.\n\nA Vox reader asks: What is wealth inequality and class warfare and why is it extra bad at this point in time?\n\n“Wealth” is someone’s net worth — that is, their assets (like savings, stock portfolios, and the value of their property) minus their debts (like student loans). “Wealth inequality” is measured by looking at how total wealth is spread out across the population. The more wealth there is at the top, the more inequality there is because there’s less to go around for everyone else.\n\nExplain It to Me The Explain It to Me newsletter answers an interesting question from an audience member in a digestible explainer from one of our journalists.

Even though incomes across the board rose at relatively similar rates in the decades after World War Two, incomes at the very top started to grow much faster after the 1970s — a trend that’s driven, at least in part, by shrinking union membership. For instance, CEOs’ compensation has grown by 1,085 percent since 1978 while the average worker’s salary has only grown by 24 percent.\n\nAnd though wages at the bottom have grown at a faster clip than those at the top in recent years, that change has not been enough to reverse the overall trend. Since 1979, the top 1 percent of earners saw their wages grow by 182 percent; the bottom 90 percent saw their wages grow by 44 percent. As a result, the concentration of money at the top of the income ladder is at the highest it’s been in nearly 100 years.\n\nBut that’s income inequality, which just looks at the distribution of people’s wages. What’s more extreme is the gap in wealth between rich and poor households. According to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, the bottom half of households have an average net worth of $51,000. Collectively, they own just 2.5 percent of household wealth in the country. By contrast, the top 10 percent of households had an average net worth of nearly $7 million and own more than two-thirds of household wealth — a share that has only been growing over the last three decades.\n\nThere are other worrying aspects of the wealth gap, including racial inequality. On average, for every $1 that white families owned, Black families and Latino families owned 23 cents and 19 cents, respectively.\n\nClass warfare, or class conflict, happens when the tension between social classes comes to a boil. That happens when the interests of different classes diverge, building resentment between them. Oftentimes, this comes in the form of protest or revolt and is generally viewed as a struggle between workers and the ruling class or elites in society. Sometimes this gets violent, as was the case in the Great Railroad Strike of 1877, when workers in multiple states went on strike after railroad workers saw their wages get repeatedly cut. Eventually the rebellion was squashed by the National Guard and private militias, and about 100 people were killed.\n\nWhy does this matter?\n\nPart of the reason you might be hearing phrases like “wealth inequality” or “class warfare” more often these days is because the concentration of wealth and power in the hands of the few has been on full display. In January, for example, Donald Trump, a billionaire, was sworn in as president while being surrounded by other billionaires. (There were many, many millionaires in the audience as well.) So as most Americans who watched Trump’s inaugural address saw it on their screens, a handful of the world’s richest men had a front-row seat. In fact, the combined wealth of everyone at the Capitol that day topped $1.2 trillion.\n\nAt its very core, the reason this level of inequality is bad is because it’s deeply unfair. But it’s not just a matter of fairness. It’s also dangerous. The fact that so few people own so much wealth is a threat to democracy.\n\nIn his farewell address, former President Joe Biden warned the nation that the United States was becoming an oligarchy — a system of government in which power is only shared by a small group of elites. It’s a warning that politicians like Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders have been talking about for years, especially after the 2010 Supreme Court decision Citizens United allowed corporations to spend unlimited amounts of money on elections.\n\nRelated Elon Musk and the age of shameless oligarchy\n\nThe hoarding of wealth is already having an impact on our government. Since Trump returned to the White House, he’s handed over a lot of power to Elon Musk, who, with a net worth of hundreds of billions of dollars, stands to be the world’s richest man. And while Musk is charged with gutting the federal workforce, he’s not required to adhere to certain government standards.\n\nWhy is it that Musk has been able to evade the ethics rules that typically apply to other government personnel? And why is it, anyway, that Musk — now an unelected bureaucrat — has so much influence over policymaking? The answer is that Musk likely gained access to so much power because he spent hundreds of millions of dollars on the election last year in an attempt to help Republicans win, and his investment seems to have paid off. He operates by different rules than everyone else because he can simply buy his way to the White House.\n\nThe concentration of wealth has also degraded some of the country’s institutions outside of government. Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, for example, who owns the Washington Post, directed the newspaper’s opinion pages to avoid publishing views that are in conflict with his own, focusing their coverage on “personal liberties and free markets.” Bezos also killed the Post’s endorsement of Kamala Harris last fall.\n\nIt’s not necessarily the case, though, that America is on the brink of a class war, despite the fact that there’s so much inequality that billionaires are taking joyrides to space while millions of Americans are struggling to make ends meet. In fact, the last election cycle showed that people in different income brackets are becoming less politically divided, with Trump making gains among poorer voters, who historically have overwhelmingly voted for Democrats.\n\nBut if history is any guide, this level of inequality is unsustainable, and the economy might course-correct. Between 1800 and 1920, for example, inequality in the US grew very quickly. But in the 60 years that followed, the gap between rich and poor shrank significantly. During that period, the wealth of the average family grew 40 times its size while the wealthiest Americans saw their fortunes double.",

Dave Chan/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe US and Canada are meant to be the best of friends, but they’re in the midst of a pretty ugly fight.\n\nIt began with President Donald Trump’s ascent to the White House, when he began referring to his outgoing Canadian counterpart as “Governor Justin Trudeau of the Great State of Canada.”\n\nThings escalated from there, with heated meetings and calls leading to the US enacting (then retracting, then enacting, then retracting) tariffs on its northern neighbor, and Canada responding in kind.\n\nProvince leaders got in on the action as well, perhaps most notably Ontario Premier Doug Ford: “If they want to try to annihilate Ontario,” he said early on in the tariff saber-rattling, “I will do everything — including cut off their energy with a smile on my face.” This week, he took steps to make good on that threat, announcing a 25 percent tax on electricity exports to New York, Minnesota, and Michigan. The US responded by promising to increase tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminum to 50 percent. That led to both sides reversing course, and a fresh round of ongoing talks. (Though Trump maintained on Thursday that “Canada only works as a state.”)\n\nI wanted a firsthand account of how all this is affecting normal Canadians and Canadian politics. So I dialed up Vox’s Zack Beauchamp, who lives in Canada, to get the scoop.\n\nZack told me that “Canadians are angry — just out-of-this-world angry about what the United States is doing to them.”\n\nHere’s what else he had to say. (Our conversation was edited for length and clarity).\n\nWhat’s going on in Canada right now?\n\nWell, for over a century, the US-Canadian border has been one of, if not the, most peaceful borders in the entire world.\n\nThere have been extremely strong relations between the two countries and extremely tight economic ties between them. For a long time, it’s been extremely easy to travel back and forth between the United States and Canada. Even before NAFTA, there was open trade for some goods.\n\nThere’s a way in which the economies are so intertwined that it’s not crazy to think about Canada and the US as having a broadly integrated economic system, even if it’s totally wrong to call Canada the 51st state.\n\nI’ll give you an example.\n\nThe US is a big farm country. Canada is too. Farming requires fertilizer, and the US imports 80 percent of its potash — an important fertilizer — from Canada. Then it sells some of the products that it grows back to Canada. When I go to the grocery store, I often find “Product of the USA” and “Product of Canada” in the produce aisle.\n\nBy putting tariffs on agricultural products on both sides, you’re making things more expensive in multiple ways.\n\nThe potash becomes more expensive to import, which also means that farmers have to pay more. It also means consumers in the United States have to pay more, and so do Canadians, because Canada’s putting reciprocal tariffs on the United States.\n\nSo not only are goods more expensive to begin with, but Canadian tariffs on American imports would make my groceries more expensive.\n\nBy going after this very tight economic integration, Trump is likely to wreak havoc on both economies, but especially the Canadians.\n\nThe tariffs on various goods threaten one of the foundations of the Canadian economy, which is trade with its much larger southern neighbor. Now, it’s not like Canada will collapse all of a sudden, but the country will experience pretty significant pain if it’s having trouble exporting or importing from the US.\n\nWith the caveat that there’s a lot of back-and-forth on this, can you tell us a bit more about what’s going on with the tariffs?\n\nI can, but I don’t know how much good it will do by the time this gets published! But right now [as of late Thursday, March 13], we’re at a pause because of both sides backing down.\n\nEarlier this week, the premier of Ontario — the Canadian equivalent of a governor — threatened to put significant export taxes on electricity sent to the United States, which would basically jack up electrical prices for Americans.\n\nTrump threatened some significant tariffs and retaliation. He got really mad.\n\nThey both sort of backed down. Lots of other tariff-related negotiations are going on. And though all this changes constantly, meaning, again, this unfortunately may not be the case when people read this, but the next big date is April 2, which is when the next round of American tariffs on Canadian-related goods will go into effect.\n\nCanada doesn’t want to be the aggressor. What Canadians say, and that includes all sorts of different politicians, is that they want the Americans to stop doing this, because economic warfare isn’t helping anybody. Essentially, “We want our things to go back to the way they were, but you keep threatening us, and so we have no choice but to fight back.”\n\nThe Canadian position is this is a defensive form of economic warfare, and they’re right to be clear. Trump started this for no reason. And I mean no reason. There was no justification given that makes any sense. Our own Eric Levitz wrote a piece looking at Trump’s various different justifications, and they contradict each other.\n\nLet’s explore that a bit. It’s a mystery what Trump wants from all this?\n\nI truly don’t know what Trump wants, and I’m not sure Trump knows.\n\nAfter the election, Trump made some comments about Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau being Governor Trudeau. And at first they seemed like jokes, like, “Hahaha, Canada, right? It’s small America,” just the sort of thing Canadians hate, but Americans engage in sometimes. It was insulting but ultimately harmless.\n\nBut it seems somewhere along the way, inside Trump’s head, this went from being a joke that he made to insult and bully somebody into a serious thing that he actually wanted, to the point where he began to link it explicitly to harmful policies.\n\nAnd now you have Trudeau saying — and this is the official line of the Canadian government as well — that Trump is trying to bully us into becoming part of the US.\n\nI just didn’t believe Trump would do that at first, because it’s so stupid. It doesn’t make any sense. The United States, for all of its power, does not have the capacity to force Canada to become part of America through economic coercion. That would require an invasion or require war, and that’s not happening, right? Trump is not going to invade Canada. (Though if he does, and I eat my words, I will be next speaking to you from the front lines of the Battle of Windsor/Detroit.)\n\nThe only way it makes sense to me is to think of Trump as a mad king. Like the archetype from fantasy literature, who just starts ordering his subjects to do all sorts of crazy things that don’t make any sense in real life. I think Trump somehow got it in his head that it would be really cool if Canada was part of the US. It would be great. It would make him look awesome.\n\nI can’t make any sense out of it otherwise. The relationship between the US and Canada prior to Trump, was as good as any two countries that live next to each other could hope to be right, nearly open trade, no threat of war. There’s literally a bridge that you drive over from Buffalo called the Peace Bridge.\n\nAnd all of a sudden, Trump has antagonized the Canadians for no discernible purpose, and disrupted what was the most peaceful and mutually beneficial border on Earth.\n\nOf course, there’s the explanation that this is all a negotiating stance, and that Trump wants to seem crazy. I find that ridiculous at this point, because it’s not clear what negotiating benefits we’re supposed to be attaining. What can Canada give the US? I don’t know, and from what I understand, the US hasn’t articulated anything privately, other than, “You can make it stop when you become the 51st state.”\n\nTell me more about how that 51st state rhetoric is playing in Canada.\n\nEverything Trump has said and done has led to a level of rage and defiance that I think very few Americans fully appreciate.\n\nPeople hear that 51st state stuff, and say, “America is literally attempting to annex us. They’re trying to coerce us into becoming Americans. And we hate that.”\n\nYesterday, I was walking around my neighborhood, and there were three shops in a row on the main drag in my neighborhood, and every single one of them listed the Canadian-made goods that they were selling.\n\nThere’s a widespread boycott of American-related goods here in Ontario, which is not only Canada’s largest province, but where state-run liquor stores have a semi-monopoly on alcohol sales. And they have taken all American-made products out of those stores. That’s a government initiative, not a citizen boycott. There’s both: Consumers don’t want to buy American goods, and the government is limiting access to certain American goods.\n\nLiang Sen/Xinhua via Getty Images\n\nOntario is currently governed by a Conservative government, one that you would think would have more ideological affinities with the Trumpers. The fact that they’ve been so aggressive is demonstrative of where public opinion is in Canada.\n\nCanadians are so insulted, so infuriated because they have their own real sense of nationhood. One of the pillars of Canadian national identity is being not American, is that Canada is different from the other country near them. To say “You should just become part of the US” is to assail one of the foundations of what makes Canada Canada.\n\nBeing so infuriated has led to a backlash against the United States and against the Trump administration, unlike anything in recent memory, dwarfing even the anti-Americanism you saw in Canada during the Bush administration around the Iraq War.\n\nSo all this is making Canadians very angry. What’s it doing to Canadian politics?\n\nIt’s transforming Canadian politics. I’ve never seen anything like this. So to back up, Justin Trudeau, the outgoing prime minister, and his Liberal Party have been in power for a really long time.\n\nOn Friday, he’s stepping aside in favor of Mark Carney, his successor at the top of the Liberal Party.\n\nIt was widely thought that the Liberals were done, that Trudeau would resign, there would be a new Liberal prime minister for a little bit until Canada has elections, and then the Conservative Party, which is their main rival, would end up winning the elections and be in charge because Trudeau was very, very unpopular — as leaders tend to be after 10 years in power.\n\nAll of a sudden, though, the polling dramatically reversed. What had been a consistent Conservative lead for years became almost a dead heat over the past week or so.\n\nTrudeau stepping down is part of that. But it really is about America for two reasons.\n\nFirst, people like the way that the Liberals have handled the United States. Trudeau and the rest of the Liberal Party have been defiant, aggressive, willing to push back, not giving any ground, calling on Canadians to stand together and stand up for their country in the face of American bullying. And that’s been hugely popular. Trudeau’s approval rating is still negative, but it’s gone up by 10 points, which is striking.\n\nSecond, the Conservative Party made a choice to elevate a guy named Pierre Poilievre to leadership. Poilievre is about as close to a Trump-style conservative, as you can get in Canada. He’s not a danger to Canadian democracy in the same way that Trump’s a danger to American democracy, and he’s less right-wing on a lot of issues, including some big cultural war ones. But he has a penchant for a kind of aggressive policy rhetoric and conspiracy theorizing to the point where he’s developed a bit of a fan club among American conservatives, who praise him.\n\nThat may have seemed like an asset for Poilievre at one time, certainly in his primary race. But now being close to the US or American-style in any way is like a death sentence in Canadian politics. The US government is the one who’s literally trying to destroy your country. It’s not helpful if you’re seen as somebody who can’t stand up to the Americans.\n\nIt’s not that Poilievre hasn’t been trying. He’s been making statements about how he’s willing to push back on the US. But the Liberals are seen as the much more naturally antagonistic party against a Republican-led United States.\n\nNow what was once a shoo-in election for the Conservatives is now a toss-up. And if trends continue, it may even turn into a Liberal favorite election, but that will take some time.\n\nAre we seeing something of a long-term reorientation in US-Canada relations here?\n\nThere are two ways to think about it, both of which could be equally valid.\n\nThe first one is one that I’ve heard from European diplomats and the people who talk to them: One Trump term can be dismissed as a fluke, but two Trump terms suggest that the United States might be like this in the future. That is, every four years you have the possibility of facing an antagonistic, aggressive right-wing, nationalist government that wants to bully you and undermine the foundations of your shared diplomatic relationship.\n\nIf you take that view — that Trump is just what the Republican Party is, and we need to readjust our politics around the fact that America might often be like this — that would lead to a long-term strategic reevaluation of the relationship and a transformation of what the nature of the US-Canadian border is going to look like, what trade is going to look like, what economic ties between the two countries are going to look like.\n\nThe second school of thought is that that’s all really costly. The relationship takes a lot of work to change, and there’d be a lot of short- and long-term pain.\n\nThe US-Canada relationship developed as it did for a reason. Geographic proximity makes it easy to trade, and it makes sense that these big markets with different climates that can grow different crops and easily support different industries would cooperate. It is a naturally congenial economic and political relationship. It would be to everyone’s detriment if the politics were more hostile.\n\nSo it might be that you start seeing a policy that acknowledges the long-term risks and takes some steps to ameliorate them, while attempting to leave the door open for a return to the pre-Trump status quo.\n\nThose schools of thought aren’t mutually exclusive, and you can see elements of both in a Canadian strategy. What I can say for sure is the odds that there will be some kind of political or economic rupture between the US and Canada that lasts decades into the future have gone up substantially just over the course of the past few months.",

        "source": "https://www.pbs.org/newshour/",
        "content": "Claiming the United States was being invaded by a Venezuelan gang, President Donald Trump on Saturday invoked the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, a sweeping wartime authority that allows the president broader leeway on policy and executive action to speed up mass deportations of people — potentially pushing his promised crackdown on immigration into higher gear.\n\nTrump’s declaration targets Tren de Aragua, contending it is a hostile force acting at the behest of Venezuela’s government. The declaration comes the same day that a federal judge in Washington barred the administration from deporting five Venezuelans under the expected order, a hint at the legal battle brewing over Trump’s move. The judge was scheduled to consider expanding the prohibition on deportation just minutes after Trump’s afternoon announcement.\n\nWATCH: How the Trump administration’s deportation policies have affected migrants and citizens\n\n“Over the years, Venezuelan national and local authorities have ceded ever-greater control over their territories to transnational criminal organizations, including TdA,” Trump’s statement reads. “The result is a hybrid criminal state that is perpetrating an invasion of and predatory incursion into the United States, and which poses a substantial danger to the United States.”\n\nThe act was last used as part of the internment of Japanese-American civilians during World War II and has only been used two other times in American history, during World War I and the War of 1812. Trump argued in his declaration that it is justified because he contends the Tren de Aragua gang, a common talking point on the campaign trail, has ties to the regime of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro.\n\nTrump talked about using the act during his presidential campaign, and immigration groups were braced for it. That led to Saturday’s unusual lawsuit, filed before Trump’s declaration even became public. The suit by the American Civil Liberties Union and Democracy Forward on behalf of five Venezuelans whose cases suddenly moved towards deportation in recent hours.\n\nJames E. Boasberg, chief judge of the D.C. Circuit, agreed to implement a temporary restraining order preventing the deportation for 14 days under the act of the five Venezuelans who are already in immigration custody and believed they were being about to be deported. Boasberg said his order was “to preserve the status quo.” Boasberg scheduled a hearing for later in the afternoon to see if his order should be expanded to protect all Venezuelans in the United States.\n\nHours later, the Trump administration appealed the initial restraining order, contending that halting a presidential act before it has been announced would cripple the executive branch.\n\nIf the order were allowed to stand, “district courts would have license to enjoin virtually any urgent national-security action just upon receipt of a complaint,” the Justice Department wrote in its appeal.\n\nIt said district courts might then issue temporary restraining orders on actions such as drone strikes, sensitive intelligence operations, or terrorist captures or extraditions. The court “should halt that path in its tracks,” the department argued.\n\nThe unusual flurry of litigation highlights the controversial act, which could give Trump vast power to deport people in the country illegally. It could let him bypass some protections of normal criminal and immigration law to swiftly deport those his administration contends are members of the gang.\n\nThe White House has already designated Tren de Aragua a terrorist organization and is preparing to move about 300 people it identifies as members of the gang to detention in El Salvador.",

Republicans took control and gained seats in the Senate. The Republicans took control of the White House. They crowed for months after the election that the American people gave them a mandate to govern.\n\nThey then kicked Democrats out of the negotiations away from the table over this continuing resolution. And then, when they discover that they don't have the votes to get this through, suddenly, the narrative, it's the Democrats want to shut down the government?\n\nIf you have a mandate, then use the mandate and pass your Republican-only negotiated bill. And I think one of the things I learned in 2016, the reason why people liked Donald Trump, the people who support him and voted for him, they loved him because he fights. I kept hearing that. He fights for them for what they believe in, and they know he won't win every fight.\n\nThis was an opportunity for Democrats, elected Democrats, to show the base and people who voted for them and people who are upset with Donald Trump that they are willing to fight. If you're not going to fight over this, then what are you going to do when the fight becomes even more terrible, the Trump tax cuts, or even the full faith and credit of the United States by raising the debt ceiling?\n\nI think that's why people are so upset.",

        "content": "WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) — President Donald Trump said he ordered a series of airstrikes on Yemen’s capital, Sanaa, on Saturday, promising to use “overwhelming lethal force” until Iranian-backed Houthi rebels cease their attacks on shipping along a vital maritime corridor.\n\n“Our brave Warfighters are right now carrying out aerial attacks on the terrorists’ bases, leaders, and missile defenses to protect American shipping, air, and naval assets, and to restore Navigational Freedom,” Trump said in a social media post. “No terrorist force will stop American commercial and naval vessels from freely sailing the Waterways of the World.”\n\nHe also warned Iran to stop supporting the rebel group, promising to hold the country “fully accountable” for the actions of its proxy. It comes two weeks after the U.S leader sent a letter to Iranian leaders offering a path to restarting bilateral talks between the two countries on Iran’s advancing nuclear weapons program that Trump has said he will not allow to become operational.\n\nREAD MORE: Trump sends letter to Iran’s supreme leader amid tensions over country’s nuclear program\n\nThe Houthis reported a series of explosions in their territory Saturday evening. Images circulating online show plumes of black smoke over the area of the Sanaa airport complex, which includes a sprawling military facility.\n\nThe airstrikes come a few days after the Houthis said they would resume attacks on Israeli vessels sailing in waters off Yemen in response to Israel’s blockade on Gaza. There have been no Houthi attacks reported since then.\n\nEarlier this month, Israel halted all aid coming into Gaza and warned of “additional consequences” for Hamas if their fragile ceasefire in the war isn’t extended as negotiations continue over starting a second phase.\n\nThe Houthis had described their warning as taking hold in the Red Sea, the Gulf of Aden, the Bab el-Mandeb Strait and the Arabian Sea.\n\nThe Houthis targeted over 100 merchant vessels with missiles and drones, sinking two vessels and killing four sailors, during their campaign targeting military and civilian ships between the start of the war between Israel and Hamas in late 2023 and January of this year, when a tenuous ceasefire in Gaza took effect.\n\nThe attacks greatly raised the Houthis’ profile as they faced economic problems and launched a crackdown targeting any dissent and aid workers at home amid Yemen’s decade-long stalemated war that’s torn apart the Arab world’s poorest nation.\n\nThe United States, Israel and Britain have previously hit Houthi-held areas in Yemen. Israel’s military declined to comment.\n\nThe Houthi media office said the U.S. strikes hit “a residential neighborhood” in Sanaa’s northern district of Shouab. Sanaa residents said at least four airstrikes rocked the Eastern Geraf neighborhood in Shouab district, terrifying women and children in the area.\n\n“The explosions were very strong,” said Abdallah al-Alffi. “It was like an earthquake.”\n\nThe Saturday operation against the Houthis was conducted solely by the U.S., according to a U.S. official. It was the first strike on the Yemen-based Houthis under the second Trump administration, and it comes after a period of relative quiet in the region.\n\nSuch broad-based and pre-planned missile strikes against the Houthis were done multiple times by the Biden administration in response to frequent attacks by the Houthis against commercial and military vessels in the region.\n\nThe USS Harry S. Truman carrier strike group, which includes the carrier, three Navy destroyers and one cruiser, are in the Red Sea and were part of the mission. The USS Georgia cruise missile submarine has also been operating in the region.\n\nTrump announced the strikes as he spent the day at his Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach, Florida.\n\n“These relentless assaults have cost the U.S. and World Economy many BILLIONS of Dollars while, at the same time, putting innocent lives at risk,” Trump said.\n\nBaldor reported from Washington and Magdy reported from Cairo.

        "content": "HAVANA (AP) — Millions of people in Cuba remained without power Saturday after a failure of the nation’s electric grid left the island in the dark the previous night.\n\nThe massive blackout is the fourth in the last six months as a severe economic crisis plagues the Caribbean country. The Ministry of Energy and Mines, in a statement on social media, attributed the latest outage to a failure at a substation in the suburbs of Havana, the capital.\n\nREAD MORE: Cuba shaken by 6.8-magnitude earthquake after enduring hurricanes and blackouts\n\nInternet and telephone service were intermittent about 18 hours after power went out around 8 p.m. local time Friday.\n\nLázaro Guerra, director of electricity at the ministry, said on national television that power was already being generated to support vital services such as hospitals.\n\nA statement from the Cuban Electricity Union released Saturday said the strategy was to create “microsystems” that will connect to each other to gradually restore electricity across the country. Several of these were already operating in the provinces of Guantánamo, Santiago, Las Tunas and Pinar del Río.\n\nIn Sancti Spíritus, the provincial energy company reported on its Telegram channel that more than 200,000 customers in that area had electricity thanks to these microsystems.\n\nMany Cuban families use electric equipment to prepare their meals. The outage could cause food to thaw in refrigerators and possibly spoil due to the island’s tropical climate.\n\n“When I was about to start cooking and making some spaghetti, the power went out. “And now what?” Cecilia Duquense, a 79-year-old housewife who lives in the working-class neighborhood of Central Havana, said Saturday.\n\nIn Havana, people were shopping for food Saturday. Businesses were open, although some were operating using batteries or small home generators.\n\nGas stations were also open, but the tunnel that runs under Havana Bay and connects the city to the outskirts was dark.\n\nCuba suffered similar blackouts in October, November and December. The latest was the first of 2025 but in mid-February authorities suspended classes and work activities for two days due to a shortage of electricity generation that exceeded 50 percent in the country.\n\nExperts have said the electricity disruptions are a result of fuel shortages at power plants and aging infrastructure. Most plants have been in operation for more than 30 years.\n\nThe outages come as Cubans are experiencing a severe economic crisis that analysts have blamed on the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, a program of domestic measures that triggered inflation and, above all, the tightening of sanctions by the United States.",

        "content": "WASHINGTON (AP) — Donald Trump was sworn in as the 47th president Monday, promising a “revolution of common sense” and taking charge as Republicans assume unified control of Washington and set out to reshape the country’s institutions.\n\nWatch all of the Inauguration Day events live in the player above.\n\nTrump, who overcame impeachments, criminal indictments and a pair of assassination attempts to win another term in the White House, will act swiftly after the ceremony, with executive orders already prepared for his signature to clamp down on border crossings, increase fossil fuel development and end diversity and inclusion programs across the federal government.\n\nWatch our PBS News special coverage below.\n\n\n\nWATCH: President-elect Trump speaks to supporters at rally on eve of his inauguration\n\nDeclaring that government faces a “crisis of trust,” Trump said in his inaugural address that under his administration “our sovereignty will be reclaimed. Our safety will be restored. The scales of justice will be rebalanced.”\n\nTrump claimed “a mandate to completely and totally reverse a horrible betrayal,” promising to “give the people back their faith, their wealth, their democracy and indeed their freedom.”\n\nHe added: “From this moment on, America’s decline is over.”\n\nPBS News, in partnership with DPAN, is offering simultaneous translation of our special coverage in American Sign Language. Watch that livestream below.\n\n\n\nThe executive orders are the first step in what Trump is calling “the complete restoration of America and the revolution of common sense.”\n\nFrigid weather rewrote the pageantry of the day. Trump’s swearing-in was moved indoors to the Capitol Rotunda — the first time that has happened in 40 years — and the inaugural parade was replaced by an event at a downtown arena. Throngs of Trump supporters who descended on the city to watch the inaugural ceremony on the West Front of the Capitol from the National Mall will be left to find somewhere else to view the festivities.\n\nREAD MORE: Your schedule of events for Trump’s 2nd inauguration\n\nAt the Capitol, Vice President JD Vance was sworn-in first, taking the oath read by Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh on a bible given to him by his great-grandmother. Trump followed moments after noon, using both a family bible and the one used by President Abraham Lincoln at his 1861 inauguration as Chief Justice John Roberts administered his oath.\n\nA cadre of billionaires and tech titans — including Mark Zuckerberg, Jeff Bezos, Tim Cook and Sundar Pichai — were given prominent positions in the Capitol Rotunda, mingling with Trump’s incoming team before the ceremony began. Also there was Elon Musk, the world’s richest man, who is expected to lead an effort to slash spending and federal employees.\n\nREAD MORE: 4 things that have changed since Trump’s 1st inauguration\n\nTrump began the day with a prayer service at St. John’s Episcopal Church. He and his wife, Melania, were later greeted at the North Portico of the executive mansion by outgoing President Joe Biden and first lady Jill Biden for the customary tea and coffee reception. It was a stark departure from four years ago, when Trump refused to acknowledge Biden’s victory or attend his inauguration.\n\n“Welcome home,” Biden said to Trump after the president-elect stepped out of the car. The two presidents, who have spent years bitterly criticizing each other, shared a limo on the way to the Capitol.\n\nREAD MORE: How move-in day will work when the Trumps return to the White House\n\nTrump’s inauguration realized a political comeback without precedent in American history. Four years ago, he was voted out of the White House during an economic collapse caused by the deadly COVID-19 pandemic. Trump denied his defeat and tried to cling to power. He directed his supporters to march on the Capitol while lawmakers were certifying the election results, sparking a riot that interrupted the country’s tradition of the peaceful transfer of power.\n\nBut Trump never lost his grip on the Republican Party and was undeterred by criminal cases and two assassination attempts as he steamrolled rivals and harnessed voters’ exasperation with inflation and illegal immigration.\n\nWATCH: Leaders in tech, AI and cryptocurrency make big donations to Trump inauguration\n\n“I am ready for a new United States,” said Cynde Bost, 63, from Lake Havasu City, Arizona.\n\nTrump, in his inaugural address, acknowledged that he was taking office on Martin Luther King Jr. Day, which honors the slain civil rights hero. Trump said, “We will strive together to make his dream a reality,” and he thanked Black and Latino voters for their support in November.\n\nLIVE BLOG: Fact-checking Trump’s 2nd inauguration\n\nNow Trump is the first person convicted of a felony — for falsifying business records related to hush money payments — to serve as president. He pledged to “preserve, protect and defend” the Constitution from the same spot that was overrun by his supporters on Jan. 6, 2021. He’s said that one of his first acts in office will be to pardon many of those who participated in the riot.\n\nEight years after he first entered the White House as a political newcomer, Trump is far more familiar with the operations of federal government and emboldened to bend it to his vision. Trump wants to bring quick change by curtailing immigration, enacting tariffs on imports and rolling back Democrats’ climate and social initiatives.\n\nHe has also promised retribution against his political opponents and critics, and placed personal loyalty as a prime qualification for appointments to his administration.\n\nWith minutes to go before leaving office, Biden issued preemptive pardons to his siblings and their spouses to shield them from the possibility of prosecution. He said in a statement that his family “has been subjected to unrelenting attacks and threats” and that he has “no reason to believe these attacks will end.”\n\nEarlier in the day, Biden took a similar step with current and former government officials who have been the target of Trump’s anger. Biden said “these are exceptional circumstances, and I cannot in good conscience do nothing.”\n\nTrump has pledged to go further and move faster in enacting his agenda than during his first term, and already the country’s political, business and technology leaders have realigned themselves to accommodate Trump.\n\nDemocrats who once formed a “resistance” are now divided over whether to work with Trump or defy him. Billionaires have lined up to meet with Trump as they acknowledge his unrivaled power in Washington and his ability to wield the levers of government to help or hurt their interests.\n\nLong skeptical of American alliances, Trump’s “America First” foreign policy is being watched warily at home and abroad as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine will soon enter its third year, and a fragile ceasefire appears to be holding in Gaza after more than 15 months of war between Israel and Hamas.\n\nAlso present will be the head of TikTok, the popular Chinese-owned social media app deemed a national security risk by the U.S. Trump has promised to lift an effective ban on TikTok through one of many executive orders expected to be issued on Monday as the new president attempts to show quick progress.\n\nTrump is planning to swiftly reinstitute his 2020 playbook to crackdown on the southern border — again declaring a national emergency, limiting the number of refugees entering the U.S. and deploying the military. He’s expected to take additional actions — including constitutionally questionable ones — such as attempting to end birthright citizenship automatically bestowed on people born in the U.S.\n\nTrump will also sign an executive order aimed at ending diversity, equity and inclusion programs within the federal government. The order will direct federal agencies to coordinate with the White House on identifying and terminating DEI programs. Conservatives have long criticized programs that give preference based on race, gender and sexual orientation, arguing they violate the Constitution.\n\nOthers orders are expected to allow more oil and gas drilling by rolling back Biden-era policies on domestic energy production and rescind Biden’s recent directive on artificial intelligence.\n\nMore changes are planned for the federal workforce. Trump wants to unwind diversity, equity and inclusion programs known as DEI, require employees to come back to the office and lay the groundwork to reduce staff.\n\nWith control of Congress, Republicans are also working alongside the incoming administration on legislation that will further roll back Biden’s policies and institute their own priorities.\n\n— Zeke Miller, Chris Megerian and Michelle L.

        "content": "WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump has signed into law legislation funding the government through the end of September, ending the threat of a partial government shutdown and capping off a struggle in Congress that deeply divided Democrats.\n\nHarrison Fields, White House principal deputy press secretary, said in a post on X that Trump signed the continuing resolution Saturday.\n\nWATCH: Senate passes Republican funding bill hours before shutdown deadline\n\nThe bill largely keeps government funding at levels set during Joe Biden’s presidency, though with changes. It trims non-defense spending by about $13 billion from the previous year and increases defense spending by about $6 billion, which are marginal changes when talking about a topline spending level of nearly $1.7 trillion.\n\nThe Senate cleared the legislation on Friday in a 54-46 party line vote, with 10 members of the Senate Democratic caucus helping the bill advance to passage despite opposition from within their party — most vocally from colleagues in the House, who exhorted them to reject the bill out of hand.\n\nSenate Democrats argued for days over whether to force a shutdown, livid that Republicans in the House had drafted and passed the spending measure without their input. Democrats said the legislation shortchanges health care, housing and other priorities and gives Trump wide leeway to redirect federal spending even as his administration and the Department of Government Efficiency rapidly dismantle congressionally approved agencies and programs.\n\nIn the end, enough of the Democratic senators decided a government shutdown would be even worse than letting the funding bill pass.\n\nSenate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said a shutdown would have given the Trump administration the ability to deem whole agencies, programs and personnel non-essential, furloughing staff with no promise they would ever be rehired.\n\n“A shutdown will allow DOGE to shift into overdrive,” Schumer said. “Donald Trump and Elon Musk would be free to destroy vital government services at a much faster rate.”\n\nPassage of the funding bill through the House earlier in the week was a victory for Trump and House Speaker Mike Johnson, who managed to hold Republicans together and muscle the bill to passage without support from Democrats — something they’ve rarely been able to achieve in the past.",

        "content": "NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stocks rallied to their best day in months on Friday as Wall Street’s roller coaster suddenly shot back upward. That still wasn’t enough to keep the U.S. market from a fourth straight losing week, its longest such streak since August.\n\nThe S&P 500 jumped 2.1% a day after closing more than 10% below its record for its first “ correction ” since 2023. The last time the index shot up that much was the day after President Donald Trump’s election, when Wall Street was focusing on the upsides of Trump’s return to the White House.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 674 points, or 1.7%, and the Nasdaq composite jumped 2.6%.\n\nREAD MORE: Wall Street tumbles to its first ‘correction’ since 2023 amid Trump’s escalating trade war\n\nA multi-day “relief rally could be coming” after so much negativity built among investors, said Yung-Yu Ma, chief investment officer at BMO Wealth Management. Swings in sentiment don’t go full-tilt in just one direction forever, and the U.S. stock market has been tumbling quickly since setting a record less than a month ago.\n\nOne piece of uncertainty hanging over Wall Street may be clearing after the Senate made moves to prevent a possible partial shutdown of the U.S. government.\n\nPast shutdowns have not been a huge deal for financial markets. But any reduction of uncertainty can be helpful when so much of it has been sending the U.S. stock market on big, scary swings not just day to day but also hour to hour.\n\nTo be sure, the heaviest uncertainty remains with Trump’s escalating trade war. There, the question is how much pain Trump will let the economy endure through tariffs and other policies in order to reshape the country and world as he wants. The president has said he wants manufacturing jobs back in the United States, along with a smaller U.S. government workforce and other fundamental changes.\n\nThe heaviest uncertainty remains with Trump’s escalating trade war.\n\nWhile stock prices may be close to finishing their reset to account for tariffs set to hit in April, Ma said concerns about how big an impact cutbacks in federal spending will have on the economy are “likely to remain for some time.”\n\nU.S. households and businesses have already reported drops in confidence because of all the uncertainties created by Trump’s barrage of on -again, off -again tariff announcements and other policies. That’s raised fears about a pullback in spending that could sap energy from the economy.\n\nWorries look to be only worsening among U.S. households, according to a preliminary survey released Friday by the University of Michigan. Its measure of consumer sentiment sank for a third straight month, mostly because of concerns about the future rather than complaints about the present. The job market and overall economy look relatively solid at the moment.\n\n“Many consumers cited the high level of uncertainty around policy and other economic factors,” according to Joanne Hsu, direct of the survey, and “frequent gyrations in economic policies make it very difficult for consumers to plan for the future, regardless of one’s policy preferences.”\n\nSuch fears have Wall Street focused on whether companies are seeing the souring mood of consumers translating into real pain for their businesses.\n\nUlta Beauty jumped 13.7% after the beauty products retailer reported stronger profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected.\n\nREAD MORE: Stock market sell-off worsens as Wall Street wonders how much pain Trump will endure for the economy\n\nThe company’s forecasts for upcoming revenue and profit fell short of analysts’ targets, but Chief Financial Officer Paula Oyibo said it wanted to be cautious “as we navigate ongoing consumer uncertainty.” Analysts said the forecasts appeared better than feared.\n\nGains for Big Tech stocks and companies in the artificial-intelligence industry also helped support the market. Such stocks have been under the most pressure in the recent sell-off after critics said their prices shot too high in the frenzy around AI.\n\nNvidia rose 5.3% to trim its loss for 2025 so far below 10%. Apple climbed 1.8% to pare its loss for the week, which at one point had been on pace to be its worst since the 2020 COVID crash.\n\nAll told, the S&P 500 rose 117.42 points to 5,638.94. The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 674.62 to 41,488.19, and the Nasdaq composite rallied 451.07 to 17,754.09.\n\nIn stock markets abroad, indexes rose across much of Europe and Asia.\n\nWATCH: ‘None of us will benefit’ from tariffs but ‘we had to react,’ EU ambassador says\n\nStocks jumped 2.1% in Hong Kong and 1.8% in Shanghai after China’s National Financial Regulatory Administration issued a notice ordering financial institutions to help develop consumer finance and encourage use of credit cards, do more to aid borrowers who run into trouble and be more transparent in their lending practices.\n\nEconomists say China needs consumers to spend more to get the economy out of its doldrums, although most have advocated broader, more fundamental reforms.\n\nIn the bond market, Treasury yields rose to recover some of their sharp recent losses. The yield on the 10-year Treasury climbed to 4.31% from 4.27% late Thursday and from 4.16% at the start of last week.\n\nYields have been swinging since January, when the 10-year yield was approaching 4.80%. When worries worsen about the U.S. economy’s strength, yields have fallen. When those worries lessen, or when concerns about inflation rise, yields have climbed.\n\nAP Business Writers Matt Ott and Elaine Kurtenbach contributed.",

        "content": "CAIRO (AP) — Hamas said Saturday it will only release an American-Israeli and the bodies of four other hostages if Israel implements their ceasefire agreement, calling it an “exceptional deal” aimed at getting the truce back on track. Meanwhile, Israeli airstrikes killed nine people in Gaza including local journalists, according to medics and a watchdog.\n\nREAD MORE: Hamas agrees to release a U.S.-Israeli hostage and bodies of 4 other dual nationals\n\nA senior Hamas official said long-delayed talks over the ceasefire’s second phase would need to begin the day of the release and last no longer than 50 days. Israel also would need to stop barring the entry of humanitarian aid and withdraw from a strategic corridor along Gaza’s border with Egypt. Israel has said it won’t withdraw there, citing the need to combat weapons smuggling.\n\nHamas would also demand the release of more Palestinian prisoners in exchange for hostages, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the closed-door talks.\n\nEdan Alexander, 21, who grew up in New Jersey, was abducted from his military base during Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023, attack that ignited the war. He is the last living U.S. citizen held in Gaza. Hamas still has 59 hostages, 35 believed to be dead.\n\nThere was no immediate comment from Israel, where government offices were closed for the Sabbath. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office on Friday accused Hamas of “psychological warfare” after the initial offer, before the militant group spelled out the conditions.\n\nAirstrikes kill nine\n\nTwo Israeli airstrikes in the northern town of Beit Lahiya near the border killed at least nine people, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry.\n\nThe Palestinian Journalists’ Protection Center, a local watchdog, said the dead included three Palestinian journalists who were documenting aid distribution. Local health official Fares Awad identified one as Mahmoud Islim, who was operating a drone.\n\nThe Israeli military said it struck two people operating a drone that it said posed a threat to soldiers in the area. It said it launched another strike at a group of people who came to collect the drone equipment. The army identified all of those targeted as suspected militants, without providing evidence.\n\nHamas in a statement called the attack a “serious escalation” showing Israel’s attempts to “sabotage any opportunity” to implement the ceasefire agreement.\n\nAlso Saturday, Israel’s military said it removed a platoon of soldiers from Gaza who were seen in a video posted on social media opening fire during a celebration of the Jewish holiday of Purim. The video shows several soldiers shooting, apparently randomly, while another performs the customary reading of the Book of Esther. The military said the soldiers “will face disciplinary measures.”\n\nNo major fighting has occurred in Gaza since the ceasefire took hold on Jan. 19, but Israeli strikes have killed dozens of Palestinians who the military said had entered unauthorized areas, engaged in militant activities or otherwise violated the truce.\n\nIsrael has cast doubt on Hamas’ offer\n\nThe United States said it presented on Wednesday a proposal to extend the ceasefire a few weeks as the sides negotiate a permanent truce. It said Hamas was claiming flexibility in public while privately making “entirely impractical” demands.\n\nTalks continued in Egypt after senior Hamas leader Khalil al-Hayya arrived Friday. Egypt and Qatar have served as key mediators with Hamas in the indirect talks with Israel.\n\nIsrael and Hamas were to begin negotiations on the ceasefire’s second phase in early February, but only preparatory talks have been held. In Phase Two, Hamas would release all remaining hostages in exchange for a lasting truce.\n\nAfter the first phase ended at the beginning of this month, Israel said it had agreed to a new U.S. proposal in which Hamas would release half the remaining hostages in return for a vague commitment to negotiate a lasting ceasefire. Hamas rejected that offer, accusing Israel of backtracking on the signed agreement.\n\nPalestinian official says no fuel left for wells\n\nFor two weeks, Israel has barred the delivery of food, fuel and other supplies to Gaza’s roughly 2 million Palestinians, and cut electricity to the territory a week ago, to pressure Hamas to accept the new proposal.\n\nThe southern city of Rafah, on the Gaza-Egypt border, said it could no longer provide fuel needed to pump water from dozens of wells.\n\nAhmed al-Sufi, head of the municipality, said fuel shortages caused by the Israeli siege have forced it to “suspend essential services, threatening the lives of thousands.”\n\nThe war has destroyed vast areas of Gaza, displaced most of the population and left nearly everyone dependent on international aid.\n\nThe ceasefire’s first phase saw the release of 25 Israeli hostages and the bodies of eight others in exchange for nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners. Israeli forces pulled back to a buffer zone along Gaza’s border and allowed a surge of humanitarian aid.\n\nThe war began when Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking 251 hostage. Most have been released in deals, while Israel rescued eight living hostages and recovered the bodies of dozens more.\n\nIsrael’s military offensive has killed over 48,000 Palestinians, mostly women and children, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry, which does not say how many were combatants. Israel says it has killed around 20,000 militants, without providing evidence.\n\nAssociated Press writer Natalie Melzer in Nahariya, Israel contributed to this report.",

        "content": "ST. LOUIS — Providers across Missouri are resuming abortion services, months after voters approved a measure to enshrine reproductive rights in the state constitution.\n\nPlanned Parenthood’s Midtown location in Kansas City, Missouri, opened up its doors on Feb. 15 to help its first abortion patient — a Missouri resident who’d planned to travel to Kansas to seek care. They were able to get medical treatment closer to home instead.\n\n“We’re really lucky to get ahold of a patient who was thrilled to get to come in earlier than she’d expected,” said Emily Wales, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood Great Plains.\n\nAbortions are available again in Missouri, two and a half years after the state became the first in the country to ban abortion following the Supreme Court’s 2022 reversal of Roe v. Wade.\n\nResidents and medical providers had been in limbo since voters backed a constitutional amendment for reproductive freedom in November’s election. Almost immediately after Amendment 3 passed, Planned Parenthood filed a lawsuit to restore abortion access. Since then, the issue has been caught in a legal back-and-forth as opponents challenged the amendment and providers fought challenges. In early February, a judge temporarily halted a key challenge prohibiting abortions from being performed in the state.\n\nClinic staff volunteered right away to come in as they navigated how to open up care to the public, Wales said.\n\nDuring the ban, patients seeking abortion care in Missouri had to travel elsewhere. According to data from Planned Parenthood Great Plains, 25 percent of patients in Kansas came from Missouri, 15 percent from Oklahoma, and the majority — 28 percent — traveled from Texas.\n\nSince Feb. 15, Planned Parenthood’s Kansas City, Missouri, location said it has provided one abortion in the city’s Midtown location and four in Columbia.\n\nREAD MORE: How the fight over 2 major voter-approved ballot measures is playing out in Missouri\n\nPatients in Columbia, which is about halfway between St. Louis and Kansas City, were able to seek abortion care for the first time since 2018, about four years before Roe was overturned. That location stopped performing abortions in 2018 when its license expired after it could not meet several state restrictions, including one that required abortion providers to have admitting privileges at a local hospital.\n\nAbout two hours away in St. Louis, the recovery room in the Planned Parenthood in the Central West End sits empty. It’s one of the clinics that are, in some ways, starting from scratch. The clinic is looking to bring back the staff, equipment and medications required for abortion care, said Dr. Margaret Baum, interim chief medical officer at Planned Parenthood Great Rivers, which serves St. Louis and Southwest Missouri.\n\n“All of our resources went to Illinois, our staff and our equipment and our medications, everything, because Illinois let us take care of patients as we know how they need to be taken care of. So now we are actively working to reopen here. So restaffing, bringing back things, getting everything set up,” she said.\n\nIt’s a process that will take time. Mary Ziegler, a law professor at University of California Davis, likened the process to when the Supreme Court first ruled in Roe V. Wade in 1973.\n\n“It wasn’t as if the court made a decision and magically, clinics appeared,” she said. “People had to decide how they were going to provide services, raise money to start … all of that needed to happen.”\n\nLegal challenges and restrictions\n\nIn the weeks after November’s election, lawmakers challenged attempts to restart abortion in the state. The state said that clinics did not meet licensing restrictions on abortion clinics.\n\nIn a three-page ruling on Feb. 14 blocking those restrictions, Jackson County Circuit Court Judge Jerri Zhang said the statues and regulations the state referenced “apply only to abortion facilities and not to any other similarly situated health care facility.”\n\n“The regulations mandate physicians to perform certain exams and testing that are unnecessary when the physicians themselves are authorized and enabled to make the determination on what is and is not necessary for their individual patients,” Zhang wrote.\n\nWhile the ruling allowed abortions to resume, it is only temporary. Another hearing is scheduled for January 2026, said Margot Riphagen, president of Planned Parenthood Great Rivers.\n\nIn the meantime, one concern for Baum is misinformation.\n\nWATCH: More pregnant women face life-threatening sepsis in wake of strict abortion laws\n\nAttorney General Andrew Bailey announced last week his office intended to serve a cease and desist letter to Planned Parenthood, claiming it was violating state law because it did not have an approved complication plan for the small number of patients who have adverse effects from medication abortion.\n\nBailey referenced concerns often touted by the anti-abortion movement about the FDA’s approval of the drug mifepristone, considered safe by the medical community. Bailey wrote that “chemically inducing an abortion creates a serious risk of injury.” This echoes a since-retracted study about emergency room visits by patients who’d had medication abortions.\n\n“The Courts have stripped away basic licensing requirements that protect women, but I will not stand by while Planned Parenthood continues to flout the law and put women’s lives at risk,” he said in a press release.\n\nIn a letter responding to these claims, Planned Parenthood said it was not providing medication abortion and was waiting for the state to approve its complication plan, which it filed about two weeks earlier. It called the notice “baseless political posturing.”\n\n“To date, Great Rivers has received zero response from DHSS despite our repeated follow up inquiries. Rather than urging DHSS to respond to Great Rivers’s weeks-ago-submitted proposed complication plan, you instead threaten to ‘take action’ against Great Rivers for hypothetical, future medication abortion occurring without such a plan,” the letter, signed by Riphagen, read.\n\nDHSS confirmed to PBS News that Planned Parenthood Great Plains’ plan was received Feb. 19, and Planned Parenthood Great Rivers’ plan was received Feb. 20.\n\n“I do not have an anticipated timeline for approval or denial of the pending complication plans,” Lisa Cox, communications director for the department, said by email.\n\nThe attorney general’s office did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nWhat this means for the region\n\nToday, Missouri and its neighbors, Kansas and Illinois, allow abortions again, Baum said, which could mean some people may not have to travel as far.\n\n“Every day that I provide abortion care in Illinois, I see patients from Texas, Louisiana, Florida, Mississippi, Tennessee, all over … and it is routine to hear, ‘I got up at four yesterday morning and we drove 13 hours,” Baum said. “And then folks get a three-minute procedure, sit in a recovery room for half an hour, and they’re getting right back in their car to drive home.”\n\nMissouri is one of seven states that passed amendments codifying abortion in their constitutions in November’s election. Measures in Nebraska, South Dakota, and Florida all failed.\n\nWhile some states offer more robust protections now than they did under Roe v. Wade, in some ways the opposite can also be true, Ziegler said.\n\n“If there were some sort of federal limit, it would override whatever Missouri voters had tried to do and that obviously means the protections. So the protections in some way are stronger in the sense that they reflect the will of the people of Missouri, but they’re also weaker in the sense that if the federal government were to put its thumb on the scale, Missourians wouldn’t be able to do a whole lot about that other than vote against people who did that,” she said.",

        "content": "ROME (AP) — Pope Francis entered the fifth week of hospital treatment for double pneumonia Saturday very much looking ahead as he worked on a signature priority of his papacy and signs of his recovery remained on a positive trajectory.\n\nWorking from the Gemelli hospital, Francis has approved a three-year implementation and evaluation process for his reform project that aims to make the church a more welcoming and responsive place. The Vatican office for the synod, or gathering of bishops, released a timetable through 2028 to implement the reforms and said Francis had approved the calendar last week.\n\nREAD MORE: Pope receives cake and glad tidings in the hospital on 12th anniversary of his papacy\n\nIn a new medical update, the Vatican said that doctors were working to reduce the pope’s nighttime reliance on the non-invasive ventilation mask, which will allow his lungs to work more.\n\nDoctors underlined that while the pope’s condition is stable, he still requires hospitalization for both physical and respiratory therapy, which are ‘’showing further gradual improvements,” the Vatican said Saturday in the first medical update in three days.\n\nBesides treatment, the pontiff spent the day alternating between prayer, rest and some work.\n\nThe Vatican has announced that it would provide medical updates on the pope less frequently, in what it called a positive development. The next medical update will be made in the middle of next week, the Vatican said. It also has ceased issuing brief morning advisories that the pope had slept well and was starting his day.\n\nDoctors this week said the 88-year-old pontiff was no longer in critical, life-threatening condition, but have continued to emphasize that his condition remained complex due to his age, lack of mobility and the loss of part of a lung as a young man.\n\nFrancis was admitted to the hospital on Feb. 14 after a bout of bronchitis that made it difficult for him to speak. Doctors soon added a diagnosis of double pneumonia and a polymicrobial (bacterial, viral and fungal) infection.\n\nThe first three weeks of his hospitalization were marked by a rollercoaster of setbacks, including respiratory crises, mild kidney failure and a severe coughing fit.\n\nBut medical updates this week have focused on his continued physical and respiratory therapy, as well as the rotation from high-flow oxygen through nostril tubes during the day and a non-invasive ventilation mask at night to help ensure his rest. An X-ray this week confirmed that the infection was clearing. Doctors have not indicated how much longer Francis will be hospitalized.\n\nThe pope this week participated in Lenten spiritual exercises from the hospital, which Vatican officials have said implied a lighter workload. He received a cake and hundreds of messages wishing him well on the 12th anniversary of his papacy Thursday.\n\nThe only public sign of life from the pope since his hospitalization was a recorded audio message thanking people for their prayers for his recovery in a weak and labored voice. It was played in St. Peter’s Square for the faithful gathered for a nightly recitation of the rosary prayer earlier this month.\n\nFor the last four Sundays, the traditional blessing that the pope delivers from a window overlooking St. Peter’s Square has been released as a text.",

        "source": "https://www.pbs.org/newshour/",
        "content": "NORMAN, Okla. — Meteorologists and climate scientists are raising alarms about major cuts to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, saying they will harm the country’s ability to forecast and respond to major weather events and put lives at risk.\n\nHundreds of employees, including some of the country’s top meteorologists and researchers, had their jobs terminated on Feb. 27, part of a broader elimination of probationary employees by billionaire Elon Musk and his team at the Department of Government Efficiency.\n\nNOAA is now tasked with cutting an estimated 10 percent of its workforce, or 1,029 jobs, current and former employees told PBS News. If plans for these latest cuts move forward, nearly 20 percent of NOAA’s 13,000-person workforce would be cut.\n\nThe federal agency is responsible for monitoring and forecasting weather across the U.S. and tracking climate trends. NOAA also oversees the National Weather Service and the National Hurricane Center, maintaining a network of radar systems, satellites and weather balloons to help predict and track extreme weather events.\n\nThe agency’s research supports marine commerce by providing up-to-the-minute weather forecasting for cargo ships and other vessels. Beyond meteorology, NOAA’s research arm also manages fisheries, protects endangered marine life, monitors ocean health and studies the long-term effects of climate change.\n\nTom Di Liberto, who worked as a climate scientist and public affairs specialist for NOAA in Maryland, was fired about two weeks before his two-year probationary status ended. He said the immediate effect of these budget cuts is that many of these already understaffed NOAA offices are now being staffed with two or three fewer people than before.\n\n“At some point those offices will have to determine what are the most important things to be done, and determine what other things will have to go by the wayside during severe weather events,” he said. “That’s not going to be good for now or the future of forecasting.”\n\nIn some places, key forecasting operations have already been disrupted. Staffing shortages have suspended some launches of weather balloons, a critical tool in tracking atmospheric conditions. Scientists say further reductions could hamper real-time storm tracking and predictive modeling. Citing staffing shortages following the first round of cuts, NOAA is suspending its monthly U.S. and global climate updates with the media.\n\nProtesters with handwritten signs gathered in late February outside the entrance to the National Weather Center in Norman after cuts were announced.\n\nThe hundreds who gathered at the center urged residents to call their elected officials and demand answers for why the agencies responsible for forecasts and severe weather alerts were targeted in the Trump administration’s efforts to eliminate federal “bloat.”\n\nFormer NOAA employees are trying to warn about the consequences of these kinds of cuts. In Oklahoma, the state saw a record number of tornadoes in 2024, while also fighting off one of its most severe droughts in recent years.\n\n“It’s terrifying because these organizations keep us safe,” Di Liberto said of ongoing cuts. “They still have that job but now they will have to do it with less people.”\n\nThe federal workers fired in the recent cuts worry for anyone who relies on the agency’s forecasts.\n\nOne person fired in the first wave of cuts, who worked at the National Severe Storm Laboratory in Norman, researched ways to observe and predict severe weather to “save lives and reduce economic loss.” The worker asked to not be identified by name because they feared retaliation as they searched for a job within the same industry.\n\nThe former NSSL employee said around a dozen people from the lab and the Storm Prediction Center in the Norman facility have already been let go. The cuts reduced the staffing capabilities for the agencies to model and track storms as well as provide alerts for people in affected storm areas, the worker said.\n\nIn the lab, the worker helped analyze data collected from storms and worked on improving systems to get better real-time data. The job required a move across the country and was a lifelong goal.\n\n“This was my dream job,” the worker said. “I wanted to help bring new innovations and expertise to help my community. This is what I had been working toward.”\n\nWhy cut from NOAA and NWS?\n\nWith climate change fueling increasingly severe and unpredictable weather patterns across the country, the importance of NOAA and NWS cannot be underestimated, said Jeff Frame, who teaches climate, meteorology and atmospheric sciences at University of Illinois.\n\n“It’s terrifying because these organizations keep us safe.”\n\nIn the short term, these cuts are problematic because it stretches severe weather alert teams thin, forcing employees to monitor bigger swaths of the country for longer hours, Frame said. As hurricane season approaches, he’s concerned by the possibility of increasingly powerful storms being underestimated because the employees who track a hurricane’s intensity at landfall no longer have their jobs.\n\n“For decades we’ve seen a slow but steady improvement in tracking forecasts,” Frame said. “These people were developing better tools to better forecast those specific situations. I don’t see how that’s an unnecessary position.”\n\nThe moves appear to align with a broader conservative push to shrink the federal government. Project 2025, a policy blueprint created by the Heritage Foundation and other contributors, including some current and former membrs of Trump’s administration. It called for the “break up” of the entire NOAA, labeling it “one of the main drivers of the climate change alarm industry.”\n\nDi Liberto said he’s not sure if a desire to squash climate change research was a reason for the cuts, but he does think the tools and programs used to track extreme weather could go undeveloped as a result of these firings.\n\n“It’s frustrating because it’s a completely self-inflicted sort of thing where you’re making these products worse and you’re making people less safe,” he said. “You’re not saving any money either because a dollar into NOAA or a dollar into the weather service gives you a lot more money back out because the preparation that it provides for people to deal with disasters.”\n\nThe Project 2025 plan’s four pages on NOAA lays out how to break up and downsize the agency by privatizing weather services and eliminating some climate research.\n\nIn recent weeks, DOGE flagged as many as 19 NOAA facilities for lease termination.\n\nFrame said the privatization of weather data is only possible because of NOAA itself and its vast network of satellites, radars, and research programs that form the backbone of American weather forecasting.\n\nDOGE listed the Radar Operations Center as part of its federal leases to be terminated. The center is a crucial hub for maintaining the nation’s Doppler radar network, which provides real-time data that operates 24 hours a day. It provides precipitation and wind data to meteorologists across the country.\n\nRep. Tom Cole, R-Okla., has attempted to reassure constituents, stating that the National Weather Center in Norman, including the radar center, will remain operational.\n\nCole said he doesn’t support the cuts to staff at NOAA and the NWS because he believes they provide vital services. He also said the federal cuts directed by DOGE are necessary.\n\n“You try to be cooperative where you can. You recognize everybody’s going to have to make some sacrifices,” he told PBS News. “Important facilities that provide services that are absolutely critical, both economically and in terms of the protection of life and property and NOAA is one of those.”\n\nMore than 500 probationary employees were terminated across NOAA in the first round of cuts, JoAnn Becker, national president of the National Weather Service Employees Organization, wrote in an email to PBS News. This includes 108 NWS employees who were terminated, though a few have been reinstated and brought back, according to the union, which represents NWS’ 4,000 workers. About 170 NWS employees also accepted the White House’s deferred resignation package, according to the union.\n\nCole said he understands more than most the need for NOAA’s services. Cole’s home is in Moore, Oklahoma, which has seen two of the deadliest tornadoes in Oklahoma history.\n\nThe research being done by NOAA to combat climate change and to make advancements for forecast improvements should continue, he said, though he shares the concerns that the cuts might hamper those efforts. The longtime Oklahoma lawmaker also said cuts to more “frivolous spending” could be beneficial in the long run.\n\n“I do worry about the research budgets,” Cole said. “But I will also tell you, you have waste and the best way to protect those things is get rid of the things that aren’t as relevant.”\n\nProtests and concerns for NOAA and NWS cuts\n\nThe broader scientific community is also sounding the alarm.\n\nProtesters have gathered in cities from Boston to Denver to Washington, rallying under the banner “Stand Up for Science.” Their message: Efforts to gut NOAA aren’t just a threat to science but also to public safety.\n\nA former NOAA scientist and researcher, who left the agency before cuts started, said the uncertainty caused by these cuts will last for years. He asked not to be identified by name because he feared retribution against his former colleagues. Those now in school training to become meteorologists or weather scientists will have to decide whether to find work with NOAA and the NWS or seek private sector roles that may have more stability.\n\n“I feel like a lot of these federal workers are the very essence of what it means to be a public servant,” they said. “We don’t do this work to make a lot of money. We do it to keep our community safe and to see that undervalued is heartbreaking.”",

        "content": "BELGRADE, Serbia (AP) — At least 100,000 people descended on Belgrade on Saturday for a mass rally seen as a culmination of months-long protests against Serbia’s populist President Aleksandar Vucic and his government.\n\nLarge crowds of flag-waving protesters clogged the downtown area of the capital despite occasional rain, with people hardly able to move and many stuck hundreds of meters away from the planned protest venue.\n\nFollowing apparent sporadic incidents between protesters and the police, university students — who have been leading the peaceful protests for the past four months — abruptly called for an end to the demonstration Saturday, saying they no longer can guarantee safety at the rally.\n\nMost of the protesters dispersed, but thousands remained on the streets as tensions surged.\n\nPolice said the crowd reached 107,000 people at the peak of the protest. Serbian independent media described the rally as the biggest ever in the country, saying the numbers were much higher. All public transport in Belgrade was canceled as protesters streamed into the city from various directions.\n\nThe rally was part of a nationwide anti-corruption movement that erupted after a concrete canopy collapsed at a train station in Serbia’s north in November, killing 15 people.\n\nREAD MORE: Serbian prime minister resigns after weeks of anti-corruption protests\n\nAlmost daily demonstrations that started in response to the tragedy have shaken Vucic’s firm grip on power in Serbia like never before in the past 13 years in charge. Many in Serbia blamed the crash on rampant government corruption, negligence and disrespect of construction safety regulations, demanding accountability for the victims.\n\nSaturday’s rally was dubbed “15 for 15,” referring to the date of the protest and the number of people killed in the city of Novi Sad on Nov. 1. The crowds fell silent for 15 minutes in the evening to honor the victims.\n\nAhead of the demonstration, Vucic repeatedly warned of alleged plans for unrest while threatening arrests and harsh sentences for any incidents.\n\nA deafening sound of whistles, drums and vuvuzelas filled the air on Saturday. Some protesters carried banners that read, “He’s Finished!” Crowds chanted “Pump it Up,” a slogan adopted during past four months of student-led protests.\n\n”I expect that this will shake his authority and that Vucic will realize that people are no longer for him,” Milenko Kovacevic, a protester, said.\n\nThe massive rally is not the endgame in a struggle for a more democratic Serbia, Dejan Simic, another protester, said. “This is just the beginning of the end, a process which I hope will end soon,” he said.\n\nProtesting university students have been a key force of the anti-graft movement with their call for justice. Students’ determination has struck a chord among the citizens who are disillusioned with politicians and have lost faith in the state institutions.\n\nHundreds of police deployed in city\n\nOn Friday evening, tens of thousands of people staged a joyous welcome for the students who have been marching or cycling for days from across Serbia toward Belgrade.\n\nInterior Minister Ivica Dacic told state RTS broadcaster that 13 people were detained overnight. He said police detained six opposition activists for allegedly plotting to stage a coup and stir unrest.\n\nBy Saturday morning people were assembling in various parts of the city as they marched toward the center. The entire downtown zone was flooded with people hours before the scheduled start of the gathering.\n\nReflecting the tensions, police said they arrested a man who rammed his car into protesters in a Belgrade suburb, injuring three people. Hundreds of police officers were deployed inside and around government buildings and in front of the presidential palace.\n\nMany railway and bus links toward Belgrade have been canceled, in an apparent effort to prevent people from attending the rally. The transport company said the cancellation was made “for security reasons.”\n\nSeveral reporters from neighboring Croatia as well as Slovenia have been turned back from Serbia’s border under explanation that their presence at the rally “represents a security risk.”\n\nVucic claims West is backing protests\n\nVucic has rejected earlier proposals for a transitional government that would prepare an early election. Fueling fears of clashes, Vucic’s supporters have been camping in central Belgrade in front of his headquarters. They include ex-members of a dreaded paramilitary unit involved in the assassination in 2003 of Serbia’s first democratic Prime Minister Zoran Djindjic, as well as soccer hooligans who are known for causing violence.\n\nPrivate N1 television on Saturday broadcast footage of dozens of young men with baseball caps going into the pro-Vucic camp.\n\nVucic has been claiming that Western intelligence services were behind almost daily student-led protests with an aim to oust him from power. He has presented no evidence for the claims.\n\nPrevious student-led rallies in other Serbian cities have been peaceful while drawing huge crowds.",

        "content": "At the First Baptist Church of Phenix City, Alabama, the last Sunday of October 2023 was Pastor Appreciation Day. The church was festive, the service well attended. There was strawberry cake, Pastor Copeland’s favorite, and special music in his honor by two of his closest friends, who sang a program of Baptist hymns, accompanying themselves on piano. Bernard Vann, the church’s elder statesman, spoke from the pulpit on behalf of the congregation, testifying as to how blessed they all felt that Bubba Copeland had entered their lives and bestowed his gifts, bound them together as a spiritual community. After reading a very long list of duties that make up a churchman’s life, Vann ribbed Bubba that he sure was getting a lot of attention that day for a job that’s just “one day a week.” Then he turned to Bubba and said, “We as a church love you, and we appreciate you for everything you’ve done,” with the true feeling of an old man, as he embraced his pastor.\n\nOnce Vann took his seat, Bubba stepped up to the pulpit. “I am so undeserving,” he said. “I don’t come from a background of being a pastor. I come from a background of loving people. And I believe there’s a giant difference between being a Christian and being Christlike. I try my best to be Christlike. There’s a lot of Christians that hurt people. What we should strive to do is go out of our way to love people unconditionally, despite who they are, what they are—because you know why? Jesus loves me.”\n\nBubba would often talk about how his life had been suffused with a grace that was beyond his comprehension. He believed that was the essence of God, and today he was telling his congregation that if God could love him—of all people—it was a sure sign that God loved everyone created in His image.\n\nThat last Sunday of October 2023 would be the last Sunday of Bubba Copeland’s life.\n\nBY ANDREW HETHERINGTON Copeland was forty-nine and the mayor of his hometown. In his corner of the world, he was needed, and he loved being needed.\n\nWe all have things that we don’t want other people to know about us. Things that might be hard to explain, even to ourselves. The world can be an unforgiving place, quick to judge, and friendships can be fleeting. Would the people whose regard means the most to us look at us differently if they learned of our hidden selves? Would they abandon us? Surely God knows our secrets. What does He think of us?\n\nThis is a story about just that—what God thinks. It’s also a story of identity and exposure, of revenge and public humiliation. Of deep love and senseless loss, and the unending grief of a small town.\n\nAnd secrets. It is a story about secrets.\n\nBubba Copeland had many secrets. And as a servant to both God and man, the judgments of heaven and earth were the alpha and omega of Bubba’s existence. What God thinks of anything, much less any of us, is difficult to discern, if we are honest. But the people of the First Baptist Church of Phenix City, Alabama, unabashedly adored Bubba.\n\nHe was empathetic and industrious and always seemed to be doing something for somebody. By last fall, he had been the senior pastor at First Baptist for four years and the church’s youth minister for fifteen years before that. Bubba was not seminary trained and was not what you might call an intellectual from the pulpit, but what he lacked in academic theology he made up for in his eagerness to answer to the spiritual and material needs of others, no matter the time or expense. According to the people in his church family who knew him best and loved him most, Bubba possessed an enormous capacity to serve, and his sermons were personal, compassionate, and often funny. As a Christian and as a pastor, he thought that in a pinch the Sermon on the Mount was just about all the Bible a man would ever need, and his favorite verse was Matthew 7:1—“Judge not, that ye be not judged.” All he knew about the ministry he had learned by the side of his first father-in-law, Dr. Eugene Langner, who pastored to the souls of the congregation at First Baptist Church for thirty years until his death in 2013. Even after Bubba and Merrigail, Langner’s daughter, got divorced, the two men maintained a loving friendship. Bubba and Merrigail had given Langner a grandson, after all. Young Carter Copeland would grow up underfoot at the church, singing hymns from the pulpit with a poise that would make his father cry. Grandfather, father, and son remained exceptionally close, their relationships unburdened by the strain that often comes with divorce.\n\nBy the last Sunday of October 2023, not only were Bubba and his second wife, Angela, and his two stepdaughters the first family of First Baptist Church, but the Copelands were also the first family of nearby Smiths Station, Bubba’s hometown, where he was finishing his second term as mayor. He was renowned for bringing a Love’s truck stop to the main highway through town, a feat of economic development that most mayors of towns the size of Smiths Station (population: 5,470) can only dream of—to hear the awe with which the people there talk about that truck stop, you’d think Bubba had brought IBM to town. When a tornado struck Smiths Station in 2019, killing twenty-three East Alabamians in the neighboring community of Beauregard, he was a twenty-four-hour one-man rescue crew—removing debris, providing supplies and reliable information to his people, and offering hugs when nothing else would do. That same year, when a high school senior in Smiths Station named Lexi Webb took her own life, Bubba initiated #SSNotOneMore, a suicide-prevention campaign. On the night before school started, without telling anyone they were doing it, Bubba and a group of volunteers scattered hundreds of signs all over town: YOU ARE WORTHY OF LOVE. YOUR MISTAKES DO NOT DEFINE YOU. YOU MATTER. DON’T GIVE UP. He had Post-it notes printed with the same affirmations and had volunteers pass them out at all the schools.\n\nIn his spare time, Bubba also owned and operated the Country Market over in Salem, where he had a reputation for employing local folks who might have trouble finding work elsewhere. His social-media feed was always full of cheerful posts about the latest specials on pork butts and paper towels. Life was good, if maybe a bit hectic.\n\nIn his corner of the world, Bubba Copeland was needed, and he loved being needed.\n\nDavid White, a retired doctor and chairman of the First Baptist Church board of trustees, was always urging Bubba to take a break, get out of town with Angela and the girls on vacation, disconnect for a while. “My only concern for Bubba was that he was spread too thin,” White says. “But his idea of a vacation was thinking up new outreach programs for the church.”\n\nThe Reverend Ralph Wooten, who for several years was pastor of the First United Methodist Church in Phenix City, says he first saw Bubba “emerging from a cloud of barbecue smoke” at the First Baptist annual cookout, and the two men became dear friends. “Bubba was a father of a blended family. He was a husband. He was a pastor. He was a successful small-business owner. And he was the mayor of a town that he loved,” says Wooten. “Any one of those things is enough for one human being, and yet he was all of those things. I knew it was a lot and encouraged him to take care of himself. He seemed to be taking it all in stride.”\n\nAndrew Hetherington Carter Copeland, Bubba’s son, is a student at Auburn and was asleep when the story about his father broke. He awoke to a text from his best friend: “I’m so sorry. I don’t know what to say.”\n\nDaniel Windsor, a dentist in Phenix City and a longtime member of Bubba’s church, says that Bubba was a “five-finger friend”—that is, he was one of a small group of cherished people in Windsor’s life so vital that you can count them on one hand. “He was an indispensable friend—and I loved him dearly,” Windsor says.\n\nJay Jones, the sheriff of Lee County, Alabama, says that “Bubba was hard not to like. He was that selfless and that reliable, the sort of person who rushes toward need, no questions asked. There aren’t that many people like Bubba in this world.”\n\nThe sign on the lawn in front of Bubba’s church read ALL ARE WELCOME. And all were welcome. For Bubba, that was how God worked in people. You might call it the essence of the Copeland theology. “Ain’t God good?” he would say to friends and strangers alike. And with Bubba, you were never a stranger for long.\n\nDan Elkins became a member of First Baptist Church in 2018. He was himself a Baptist minister and for ten years had successfully tended his own flock in an “itty-bitty” town in southern Alabama. Married with two kids, Elkins had tried to make his marriage work even though he had known for years that he was gay. After he and his wife divorced in 2003, he resettled in Phenix City, where he would meet his husband, Jason Price. Their first date was at the Home Depot. “In case it didn’t work out, you always need something at Home Depot, right?” Price says with a laugh.\n\nBoth Elkins and Price have a deep faith and struggled to find a church that would be a true spiritual home for them, where they would be welcomed as full-fledged members, not “as lesser than.” “There’s churches that will cash our checks and let me and my husband sit in the back pew, but we didn’t want that. We feel that we have a lot to give and love being involved in a vibrant community,” Elkins says. They had heard good things about First Baptist in Phenix City, but Price had serious reservations about committing to a Baptist church. “I thought, I ain’t going to no Southern Baptist church,” he says. “Been there, done that.”\n\nElkins first wanted to talk to the pastor, have a frank conversation, and manage everyone’s expectations from the start. Elkins called the mayor’s office in Smiths Station, and Bubba said to come on by. “We sat there across from each other, and I told him that Jason and I wanted to be members of a church where we would be treated with dignity and respect and welcomed without reservation.” Instantly, Bubba responded, “Dan, you are my brother. God has blessed our church by sending you to join us.” Bubba added that his son was gay and that he was “not sure how to relate to him. God has brought you into my life to be Carter’s gay stepdad.”\n\n“So we joined First Baptist and never looked back,” Elkins says. “It’s hard for me to express the depth of my gratitude for what Bubba gave us.”\n\nIt’s not that Bubba’s friends idealized him or thought he was perfect—they didn’t, and he wasn’t. For one, he had to keep a laminate of the Lord’s Prayer in a right-hand corner of the pulpit at First Baptist, as he sometimes forgot the words. A bigger problem for Bubba was that he worried too much about what people thought of him. And he spent way too much time looking at his phone. These days, of course, there is a direct correlation between those two things. Bubba felt an unending sense of responsibility to the people of his church family and to the people of Smiths Station. An unkind comment on Facebook could keep him up at night. If this is a common modern affliction, Bubba had an acute case.\n\nIt would be his undoing.\n\nAt the end of the Pastor Appreciation Day service, Bubba joined Dan Elkins and Daniel Windsor at the piano on the altar to sing a favorite song. The Lord did not bless Bubba with much of a singing voice, but what he lacked in talent he made up for in effort. The song was “Sweet Beulah Land,” and the second verse goes like this:\n\nI’m looking now, just across the river\n\nTo where my faith shall end in sight\n\nThere’s just a few more days to labor\n\nThen I will take my heavenly flight\n\nThree days later, on the morning of Wednesday, November 1, an online news site called 1819 News, which states as its mission the promotion of “Alabama values,” published a story about Bubba Copeland and all his secrets. Titled “The secret life of Smiths Station Mayor and Baptist pastor F. L. ‘Bubba’ Copeland as a ‘transgender curvy girl,’ ” the story was about Bubba’s hidden online life and featured pictures of him in makeup and a blond wig, wearing women’s underwear and clothes. He had posted the pictures to Reddit subgroups, including one called TransLater, where they would collect comments such as “Sister you look beautiful. Cute outfit,” and Bubba would reply, “Thank you doll!”\n\nAndrew Hetherington Dan Elkins and David White at White’s dinner table, where a somber group gathered the morning after Bubba’s death to plan the future of First Baptist Church.\n\nWhen the 1819 News correspondent, Craig Monger, had called for comment, Bubba had begged him not to publish the story, fearing that news of his private life exploding into public view would embarrass his family, his town, and his church. Dressing up was something he and his wife had done on a lark, he told Monger. He then went further, saying that cross-­dressing was something he had done on occasion since he was a young man, a hobby to relieve stress. “I have a lot of stress,” he told Monger. “I’m not medically transitioning. It’s just a bit of a character I’m playing.”\n\n“The more I talked to them, the more turned around it got,” Bubba would tell a friend.\n\nWhen the story hit the next morning, Bubba’s son Carter, a junior at Auburn, was still asleep. He woke up to a text from his best friend that read, “I’m so sorry. I don’t know what to say. I don’t know what to do.”\n\n“I had no idea what she was talking about,” Carter says. “I called her, and she told me what had happened. Immediately, I looked up my dad’s name online and saw it everywhere. It was early in the morning, and every news outlet I’d never heard of had already jumped on it, like piranhas. I watched the whole world tear him down almost instantaneously.”\n\nCarter and his father were extremely close. Over the years, each had confided in the other about their innermost struggles—in high school, Carter had come out to his father, and Bubba had shared his secrets with his son. Carter was shocked at the meanness of the story and was overcome with a visceral fear that he had never known before. In a panic, he called his dad.\n\n“He picked up and said, ‘Good morning, buddy.’ And I said, ‘What are you talking about, Good morning?!’ Trying to calm me down, he again slowly said, ‘Good morning, buddy.’ And I said, ‘Okay, good morning.’ And then I said, ‘Dad, we have to talk.’ And he said, ‘No, we don’t. I need to get into a meeting. I have people I need to take care of. We’ll talk later.’ ”\n\nAfraid, and not knowing what else to do, Carter wrote to the story’s author, whose email address was posted on the 1819 News website. He received no response. The next day, Thursday, November 2, he wrote to him again:\n\n\n\nMr. Monger,\n\n. . . I am Bubba Copeland’s son. What you have done is not by any means journalism. You have hurt the man who has been here for me my entire life. My father is my hero, always has been, and always will be. I have seen some awful things in this world and experienced a great deal of hatred myself as a gay man. You have fueled a fire of hatred and bigotry unlike any other I have ever seen in my life. I have over the last 24 hours watched my father completely break down. I truly wish I could express to you the emotions and the feelings I feel towards you and your colleagues, but I am unable at this time. My only wish now is that you are able to carry on with your life and have the peace which you have so heartlessly taken from countless lives by writing this article. . . . If you find time in your day to step aside from your [duties] I would greatly appreciate a call. More than anything else I would like to tell you the kind of person my father really is. You should truly be ashamed of yourself.\n\nBy that day, Bubba’s family, his church family, and several of his closest friends in Smiths Station had become concerned that he might harm himself. The 1819 News story was all anybody was talking about. And another story—more lurid, more humiliating, harder to explain—was on the way and would reveal the last of Bubba’s secrets to the entire world. He was in disbelief at the coverage, and the brutal anonymity of the hate pouring onto the First Baptist website and Facebook feed beggared belief.\n\nHypocrite!\n\nHAHA faggot.\n\nYou should kill yourself.\n\n\n\nJason Price and Dan Elkins were the administrators for the church accounts. Along with another volunteer from the church, they would stay up all night taking down the comments so that Bubba wouldn’t see them. But Bubba couldn’t sleep and was fixated on the velocity and reach of the Internet and its lacerating judgments. As the calendar turned from Thursday to Friday, the community of people who knew him best and loved him most—the people you have just met, and many more besides—desperately tried to form a bulwark between him and the ugliness of the world.\n\nBubba, hold your head high. You are so loved and have so much support.\n\nBubba, you are going to get through this—we are going to get through this, together.\n\nBubba, just hold on, brother—get out of town for a few days, this will blow over.\n\nBubba responded: These are dark days.\n\nSensing his growing despair, his friends and family began sending more urgent messages:\n\nBubba, where are the guns?\n\nBubba, we can’t do this without you. How are we going to live our lives without you?\n\nWhen the world comes at you, though, it comes at you.\n\nThe story had gone global, and Bubba couldn’t look away from his phone. Have you seen the New York Daily News? he would ask friends, obsessing over the latest headline.\n\nThis article appeared in the April/May 2024 issue of Esquire\n\nsubscribe\n\nElizabeth White, a WRBL News 3 crime reporter based in Auburn, Alabama, who reported on Bubba in his capacity as mayor of Smiths Station, says that “Bubba was down, and they just kept kicking and kicking and kicking. It wasn’t enough for them to just expose him. They wanted to hurt him. It’s devastating to know that for all the good he did, he spent his last days and moments in unbearable anguish.”\n\nOn the afternoon of Friday, November 3, feeling all but destroyed, Bubba Copeland finished the job and killed himself.\n\nThe Lee County coroner, Daniel Sexton, would write in his report that the cause of death was a .38 slug to the right side of Bubba’s head, just above the ear. But no clinical description of what a handgun can do to flesh and bone will ever capture the true cause of Bubba Copeland’s death.\n\nThe next morning, Bubba’s son again wrote to Craig Monger:\n\nI hope if you ever have children, they never have to face what I am now going through. I hope that they never have to find out that their father caused another man’s death by his own hand. You and your colleagues took my father from me. . . . I hope the Lord’s judgment for you is swift and deliberate.\n\nCarter Copeland is still waiting for a reply.\n\n\n\nWhen a stranger comes to a small town asking painful questions of a grieving community, the third degree is not only understandable, it’s to be expected.\n\n\n\n“You like coffee?” David White asks me. “Well, if you’re in Phenix City anyway, then I guess you should come by so we can look each other in the eye and size each other up.”\n\nThe doctor and his wife, Lori, live across the street from First Baptist Church. He is quick to point out that on Easter Sunday in 1865, Union general James H. Wilson began one of the last battles of the Civil War from his yard, staging his attack on Confederate fortifications across the Chattahoochee River in Columbus, Georgia, before going on to capture Jefferson Davis, the president of the Confederacy. White is bemused at his proximity to this history. In fact, he seems to wear a bemused expression as his face’s default setting. The staging area used by Wilson’s Raiders is now used to stage White’s beehives; his family’s annual “canning kitchen,” in which they put up thousands of jars of fruit preserves and jellies and pickles to give away to friends and strangers far and wide at Christmas; his own small vineyard, where he cultivates grapes for a wine that’s “best served in Dixie cups”; and the pits for the church barbecue on the last Saturday in April, where they’ll smoke two thousand pounds of pork.\n\nCourtesy of family Bubba would describe his cross-dressing as “a hobby I do to relieve stress.”\n\nWhite is from Phenix City, fifth generation, and grew up in this house, which was built in 1906. During the Spanish flu epidemic of 1918, as there were no hospitals, the house was made into a flu infirmary, with the sick and dying in the front and concerned family members coming and going from the back, the two halves separated by a heavy curtain that no one was allowed to cross except for the nurse. The doctor would come once a day to leave morphine and aspirin, pronounce the dead, and figure out where to put the new arrivals. “There’s a Black community a quarter mile that way,” White says. “We all grew up together. That’s the way it was. And in those days, nobody had anything, so there was no economic distinction between neighbors. It wasn’t perfect, it wasn’t good, but it was a lot of people striving together to get by. It wasn’t all Ku Klux Klan.”\n\nPer the census, Phenix City has a population of thirty-eight thousand, spread out along the Chattahoochee River, straddling Lee and Russell counties. But it has the feeling of a smaller town, essentially a modest suburb of Columbus, Georgia, directly across the river. Roughly half Black and half white, the diverse population is reflected in First Baptist’s congregation.\n\nWhite’s father was born in this house in 1917 and was a newborn when both of his parents became gravely ill with the flu. The nurse was caring for White’s grandparents, who were laid out in the front of the house, and the baby was quarantined on the back porch. The need was so great, and the nurse was doing the best she could, but at one stretch she forgot about the newborn and went forty hours straight without crossing the curtain. When she realized what she’d done, she just knew that the baby was dead. She rushed through the curtain to the rear of the house only to find a six-year-old Black boy named Roy Pierson—who had sick family in the front of the house, too, and had himself been lost in the shuffle—caring for the baby, who was quite alive. “Roy was not big enough to pick him up. So he would sleep under the cradle and rock him, and he did his best to keep him clean, but he couldn’t figure out how to feed him. So he would get food and he would chew it up, and he would take it from his mouth and put it into my father’s mouth,” White says. “So when I came along in the South in the early sixties, my Uncle Roy was a Black man. He was my father’s brother, as much of a brother as my father would ever have, and they could not have been any closer had they been related by blood. That’s kind of the weave of the history here.”\n\nHe is wearing that bemused expression, but just the night before, White had been on the phone for half an hour, sternly interrogating me about why I had come to Phenix City. “We are hurting, our friend is gone, and we don’t need more salaciousness and scandal,” he said. “The press—so-called—did this to Bubba. Why would we talk to the press? People are concerned.”\n\nHe pours the coffee and says, “The people you are here to meet are still in shock at what happened and feel a profound sense of failure at not being able to save our friend. But if we are talking to you, it’s because we don’t want 1819 News to be the last word on Bubba Copeland.”\n\nThe people who exposed Bubba’s secrets said they presumed several things about him, chiefly that he was a hypocrite, preaching hate publicly for the life that he led privately. Bryan Dawson, the founder of 1819 News, would say publicly the week after Bubba’s suicide that Copeland was “pretending to be one thing—uber-conservative, Baptist, Trump, Christian, all of that”—while living a life that made a lie of those claims. Maybe Dawson was making broad assumptions about what it means to be a Baptist preacher in Alabama, but if he and his editorial team had known more about Bubba Copeland, they would have known that that assertion was far from accurate. Dawson would also admit that not only had he never heard of Bubba Copeland before receiving “a tip” about his online life, he had also never heard of Smiths Station.\n\nThe story of the Internet is of tribes hurling rocks over the horizon at targets they cannot see, doing damage that they do not care to measure. In this case, those assumptions and that ignorance would make Bubba less a human being than an ideological target in a raging culture war, and the damage radiating through these towns is now plain for all with eyes to see. And it’s not just these towns. Coinciding with the breakdown of our social order and abetted by technology of astonishing power, we find ourselves in a conflict over rapidly changing conceptions of gender and sexual difference. In the backlash to this upheaval, the casualties are mounting.\n\nTo learn about Bubba, who he actually was and what he cared about, it’s important to meet his church family, and the best place to do that is here, at David White’s dinner table. Here is where so many people have broken bread and laughed and carried on. Here is also where the trustees and deacons held an emergency meeting the Saturday morning after Bubba died to figure out if and how the church would continue. Lori White made biscuits and coffee, and a somber group sat around this table to plan the next day’s service, which is about all they had in them to do. One service at a time. Get through Sunday, then give some thought to the funeral.\n\nIt was decided White would lead the service the next day. He is an easy public speaker with a deep familiarity with scripture, and it was not unusual for him to offer a sermon. Bubba was eager to share his pulpit with speakers he saw as more talented than himself, and White had already been scheduled to do the talk that Sunday. But his sermon would need to be very different now. From there, he and Dan Elkins would share pastoral duties, and other area clergy—even including a Methodist pastor named Laura Eason—would be invited in to help keep the church going.\n\nBY ANDREW HETHERINGTON The evening of November 1, after the 1819 News story had broken, Bubba led his last Bible study at First Baptist. He chose a fateful passage to teach: Psalm 23:1-6, which had him walking through the valley of the shadow of death.\n\nTo keep going is the point of a church. Just as White and his family are fed at this table, so too are they fed at the church across the way. The need for spiritual sustenance doesn’t explain why we believe what we believe, but the two are intimately related, as with common purpose comes community. Coming together in awe and doubt in the face of eternity might be the last human feeling that AI can’t take from us. If a religion splits over a breach in heavenly doctrine or earthly politics or a combination of the two—as the Baptist church did in 1845, cleaved down the middle due to the belief held by what would become Southern Baptists that slavery was an “institution of heaven”—then the community splits, too, profoundly and perhaps irrevocably. The Southern Baptists are no longer confined to the South and now have churches in forty-one states, which makes them the largest Protestant denomination in the United States. In 1995, church leaders apologized for the faith’s racist origins and at the same time repented for the church’s opposition to the civil-rights movement and interracial marriage.\n\nThere have been other fault lines more recently, involving the enduring Old Testament penchant of more-conservative Christians to take it upon themselves to cast people into hell, as well as contemporary social issues—whether women can preside over services (an emphatic no in Southern Baptist churches) and whether God loves gay people (the Southern Baptist position might best be described as “hate the sin, love the sinner”).\n\nWhat they all seem to agree on is that the Bible is a well-worn daily instruction manual and not some ancient relic. It is important to White that I understand the First Baptist ethos and the mark that Bubba left on the church in Phenix City.\n\n“Our philosophy is this: We open those doors,” he says. “You can read your whole Bible, and nowhere in it does the Bible give you permission to judge your fellow man. But time after time after time, it tells you to love your fellow man. No matter what. That was Bubba’s attitude. It’s the attitude our church shares.”\n\nIt seems an uncontroversial point and a handy distillation of the foremost of the Christian commandments, familiar to anyone with a passing knowledge of the New Testament. All of the gospels enunciate a version of this basic tenet of Christianity, and the Gospel of Mark makes clear that there is “no commandment greater” than to love God and to “love your neighbor as yourself.”\n\n“It’s not that complicated,” says White, “although because we are human, we keep pretending not to understand how this is supposed to work. We keep pretending that God intended for us to rough each other up using his Word. Buddy, there but for the grace of God go I. Maybe we don’t cross-dress and that kind of stuff, but we all have our faults, and none of us deserve the harsh judgment of other flawed humans. First and foremost, Bubba Copeland was my friend. I don’t fully understand what was going on with him, in his life and in his home, but I also don’t know that I’m supposed to. I don’t think it’s my business.”\n\nThe evening of November 1, after the 1819 News story had broken, Bubba led his last Bible study at First Baptist. He chose a fateful passage to teach: Psalm 23:1–6, which had him walking through the valley of the shadow of death. After the session, he walked into a very tense meeting of the church’s board of trustees that began in anger and ended two hours later in tears and hugs. The trustees, led by White, had, like everyone else, been blindsided by the story and just wanted to know one thing: Bubba, is it true?\n\nHe maketh me to lie down in green pastures . . .\n\nYes, the pictures were real, he told them. They were private and never meant to be public. It was dumb to post them on the Internet. He was abjectly sorry for the embarrassment he would cause, adding that he would never purposely do anything to hurt the church or his friends.\n\nHe restoreth my soul . . .\n\n“We did not suspend him. We did not reprimand him. We did not fire him,” White says. “We talked to him frankly. We expressed our shock and disappointment, and then we replaced that with our concern and our love and our support for our brother, who was suffering. The church would be fine. Now it was Bubba we were worried about.”\n\nI will fear no evil, for thou art with me . . .\n\nThe next morning, one of the trustees from First Baptist who had been in the meeting the night before received a call from a man from the Russell County Baptist Association. The caller wanted to know what First Baptist planned to do to punish its pastor and why it hadn’t done so already.\n\nThou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies . . .\n\nThe First Baptist trustee told the caller from the Baptist Association that as First Baptist had not been aligned with the Southern Baptist Convention for decades, the situation with Bubba Copeland was none of the association’s business.\n\nThou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over . . .\n\nThe trustee added that just as the New Testament instructs in the books of Matthew, Luke, and Galatians, when a brother goes astray, as Paul wrote in his letter to the early Christians of Galatia, “you who are spiritual should restore him in a spirit of gentleness.”\n\nSurely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life, and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever.\n\nMatthew emphasizes that this counseling should be done privately; Luke, the importance of forgiveness after repentance. And that, the trustee told the caller, was how First Baptist planned to address the situation with its brother Bubba Copeland. Thank you for calling.\n\nAndrew Hetherington Phenix City is roughly half Black and half white, and the town’s diversity is reflected in the First Baptist congregation. “Our philosophy is this: We open those doors,” says David White. “You can read your whole Bible, and nowhere in it does the Bible give you permission to judge your fellow man.”\n\n“We haven’t been Southern Baptist for twenty years,” White says. “And you’re probably not going to find another Baptist church in a small town anywhere that has gay couples that come to church every Sunday. Of course, you have to be sensitive, because we have members that are old-school, in their eighties and nineties, and they might not be ready for all of that, but they’re accepting. After Gene Langner died, we started looking for a pastor. I was on the search committee that brought the next pastor here, and we had people in church that were gay. It was generally known but not discussed. And the older members, some of them—the staunchest, most Republican, redneck guys, I mean—I grew up around them and I watched God change them, but they’re still very conservative. And more than one of them came up to me and said, You’re looking for a pastor, but, you know, so-and-so sits over there in the third row. They’re kind of different. Don’t you bring anybody here that’ll hurt them or turn them away.”\n\nThe Southern Baptist Convention still regards sexual difference as an abomination against God, and even homosexual desire not acted on is “always sinful, impure, degrading, shameful, unnatural, indecent and perverted,” according to the denomination’s “Resolution on Homosexual Marriage.” As a remedy for impure thoughts, the SBC endorses sexual reorientation.\n\nWhen Dan Elkins had his country church in southern Alabama and was struggling to reconcile his ministry with his sexuality, he came out to his then wife. That was 1996, and it would be seven years before they would divorce. “We did counseling, and I was told, You can beat this with prayer and fasting, and I prayed, and I fasted, for years—ever the good little Baptist boy—but I was earnestly trying to change something that simply can’t be changed,” Elkins says. “I had come out to a confidant at church, and that person betrayed my trust and it got out in the community, but I didn’t know it. We showed up for church one Wednesday night and the parking lot was full, and I’m like, Something’s going on. This was January 2002. Oh my word. If Facebook had been around then, I’m not sure I’d be here. I’m not sure that I would have seen the way out. Like Bubba couldn’t see the way out.”\n\nIn this pocket of East Alabama, though, the church doors are open, and the Bibles say that God loves everybody. “That’s how this church has evolved,” says White. “We have members who are gay and married and accepted, and that’s relatively new. And we have older members who are accepting even if they don’t understand. It’s been a long trip for them. You cannot fail to recognize how far they’ve come.\n\n“And that’s Bubba’s legacy,” White adds. “I can tell you that his legacy is not defined by that week. His legacy is defined by the friends he leaves, by the people that he led to the Lord, by the life and values he lived. That’s his legacy. Not 1819 News. 1819 News is to journalism what a quack is to the practice of medicine.”\n\nBryan Dawson believes in redemption narratives. Especially his own. The founder of 1819 News (so named because 1819 is the year Alabama became a state) has a compelling personal story that he has honed into a performance piece on various podcasts and pulpits across Alabama for the past several years, although he is not from the state or even the South.\n\nBY ANDREW HETHERINGTON When a high school student in Smiths Station took her own life, Bubba started a suicide-prevention campaign, putting up affirmations all over town.\n\nAs a young man, Dawson lived in Colorado Springs, and it’s there that his life of crime gave him the material for his story. He trafficked in weed, cocaine, and meth; was the kingpin of a “motorcycle, automobile theft ring”; and in spring 2007 beat a “snitch” over the head with a chain with a padlock at the end of it, for which he would be charged with attempted murder, among other felonies. (He would eventually plead to reduced charges and receive a sentence of sixteen years in prison.) These experiences have been memorialized numerous times in the press, in stories such as “From Breaking Bad to Redemption: The Story of Bryan Dawson” in Newsweek and in an interview on his own website titled “From Tragedy to Triumph, the CEO of 1819 News Shares His Story.”\n\nIn his story, he tells of a sad and lonely young man with no self-esteem raised in a broken home, who is always put in the “friend zone” by young women and who only ever feels comfortable as himself when he is high or drunk. And then he becomes a violent criminal, faces hundreds of years in prison, is extended grace and kindness over and over again by strangers and the state, finds God, and is ultimately salvaged by a community that forgives him seventy times seven (Matthew 18:21–22). In the details and framing of his story, Dawson is pleading for understanding, and his adoring interviewers give it to him; one even adds at the end, “I think if you had been born way back, you would be in the Bible.”\n\nYes, you might say that Dawson’s Colorado Springs redemption epic is like Saul on the road to Damascus, if Saul had attempted to murder a man with a padlock on a chain, causing “permanent disfigurement,” according to the attending physician in a police report, who added that “the victim was lucky to be alive.”\n\nSaul of course repents, calls himself the “foremost of sinners,” and becomes Paul, the greatest writer of the New Testament. In his redemption narrative, Dawson also becomes a different person, but when he tells his story this new person doesn’t mention the man he tried to kill, doesn’t indicate how he feels about him or whether he ever thinks about how he might be getting on with his permanent disfigurement. Instead, in his redemption story, Dawson occasionally shines a little light on his supporting cast—his wife, his mother—but mostly he finds satisfaction in the power of his own narrative. His interviewers feel the same way, and they interrupt him to say things like It’s just like in the movies!\n\nSARA PALCZEWSKI/OPELIKA-AUBURN NEWS/AP (COPELAND). MARK WARREN (SIGN). JULIE BENNETT/THE NEW YORK TIMES/REDUX (MEMORIAL) Left: The memorial in front of the church in the days after Bubba killed himself. Right: One of the signs with affirmations that Bubba put up around Smiths Station after a local high school student took her own life.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhich brings us to his fresh start in Alabama, where he grew an apostolic beard, started to allow the slightest bit of a twang in now and then, joined a Baptist church in Wetumpka where he sometimes preached from the Old Testament and where just ten days before his life intersected with Bubba Copeland’s he delivered a sermon that revealed him to be an aspiring theocrat. Preaching from Deuteronomy and Samuel, he refers to “God’s government”; is entranced by the “rod of correction,” the “power of the sword,” and offenses against God that are “punishable by death”; warns of the consequences that will come when a church “neglects to use the sword properly”; and says things like “We’ve done a great job of rooting out the rubbish and the refuse of the Philistines in our church. We’ve done a phenomenal job” and “Right now in the state the fear of God is not before their eyes, so they just do whatever they want.”\n\nAppearing on a podcast this past January about the “Dangers of Progres­sive Christianity,” Dawson said that “progressive Christianity comes from feminism creeping into the church” and that the one true faith had fallen victim to “soccer moms” and their tendency to be more welcoming and less judgmental. In the same broadcast, he trained particular fire on a prominent evangelical minister who had sparked controversy by advocating that churches be more supportive of the LGBTQ+ community. For this, Dawson called the minister an “apostate” and a “full-blown heretic” and then went on to improvise that the man was gay and was cheating on his wife, and to finish the point he said, “I wish there were Old Testament lightning strikes that happen to people when they blaspheme the Lord the way that he does.”\n\nThe Lord did not bless Bryan Dawson with a talent for public speaking, but what he lacks in fire he makes up for in brimstone. His Christianity seems somewhat unfamiliar with its namesake. In that, he is a familiar figure, older than time, and not only among Christians—a religious enforcer who knows just enough of a holy book to be dangerous. You might say that he put down his padlock, picked up his Bible, and didn’t skip a beat.\n\nDawson then merged his brutal version of the Christian faith with the often brutal politics of Alabama on the always brutal platform of the Internet and in late 2021 founded 1819 News to counter the most prominent news site in Alabama, AL.com, which is, he says, “communist propaganda.”\n\nThese details of Dawson’s story are important, because in the moral calculus of 1819 News, Bryan Dawson is allowed a redemption narrative sanitized of victims, but Bubba Copeland is not. Perhaps that is because Dawson’s violent felonies were manly crimes, just like in the movies, whereas Bubba Copeland’s transgressions were of thought and behavior that Dawson could not square with his version of the faith and would not tolerate, and rather than extend Copeland the grace that he himself had been the beneficiary of so many times, he ignored Bubba’s plea for mercy and leveled him instead. He and his editor in chief, Jeff Poor—an alum of the Daily Caller and a regular contributor to Breitbart—would make the case that it was Bubba Copeland, who did not preach violence from his pulpit, who was the dangerous one. After his death, they would assert publicly that he was a troubled man, that he had victims, that it was their duty to expose him, and that, as Poor would say, “the people at First Baptist Church, Phenix City, had a right to know what their worship leader was doing.”\n\nOn the day that Bubba Copeland took his own life, 1819 News published its second feature on his fantasy life online. This story was even more lurid than the first, detailing pieces of erotic fiction that Bubba had posted as his alter ego. Some of the fiction was gruesome—one story in particular dealt with a trans protagonist who stalked and killed a woman so that she could have a relationship with her victim’s husband. The story was titled “Dangerous Obsession”: “In my cubicle I scanned her page. She posted a new picture! Excited I screenshot it to add to my ever-growing collection. To say I was a stalker would be a bit of an understatement. Every post she made I studied it, analyzing and taking notes of her daily routine. What she ate, what she drank, from her favorite coffee to her favorite alcoholic drink. Her life had become my obsession.”\n\nIn the two days since 1819 News had posted its first story, it had been alerted that Bubba had used pictures of at least two real people from the Phenix City area in at least one of his posts—a meme about transitioning. The two were a brother and sister, and people from the community have confirmed for me that the brother was a minor when the picture that Bubba used was taken. In his second feature, correspondent Craig Monger wrote that the father of the children pictured had called 1819 News, informed the site that the pictures were of his children, and asked them to remove the images. (The photo of the boy was taken from the father’s social-media account.) In his posts, Bubba seemed to use photos from the Internet both purposefully and indiscriminately, once including an image of a teenage girl who was not from the area.\n\nBY ANDREW HETHERINGTON Lisa Deason worked with Bubba in the Smiths Station mayor’s office. She engaged in a physical strug­gle with him in a vain effort to keep him from ending his life.\n\nA local woman had contacted the site to say that Bubba had used pictures of her in some of his posts. Monger also discovered that Bubba had used the name of another local woman in “Dangerous Obsession.” I reached out to the father of the brother and sister but did not hear back, and also to both of the women. One did not reply, the other wrote back, “No need to bring all of that back up as those . . . families heal.”\n\nWhen Dawson and Poor had published their exposé on Bubba two days earlier, the 1819 News editorial team had apparently not been aware that he had used the names and images of people he knew in posting to his online community. But in the days after his death, his poor judgment would become their justification for having published the stories in the first place. 1819 News’s initial imperative—to expose a cross-dressing pastor that its editorial team had assumed to be a hypocrite—would no longer be enough.\n\nThe week after Bubba’s suicide, Dawson and Poor released a thirty-­four-minute video podcast on which they outlined all that had gone into their decision to publish their exposé. The timeline, they say, is that they received a tip about Bubba’s online life on Monday, October 30. They called him for comment. They published on Wednesday morning after deliberating for three hours the night before on whether to go through with it.\n\nIn the video, the two strike a sober pose. “It’s a tragic situation where no one wins,” says Dawson. They grant themselves absolution for doing the right thing and say that they feel besieged by criticism on social media that 1819 News had acted irresponsibly. Dawson does not allow himself to understand the reaction in anything other than ideological terms. “This story,” he says, “has shaken things up in the leftist community!”\n\nPoor wears the look of a man surprised to find himself in the middle of a matter of such consequence and bristles at the suggestion that decisions he was party to might have contributed to the death of a man. Don’t assume that Bubba Copeland killed himself because of those stories, he says. “We may never know, but don’t assume that.”\n\nAs they hash out their reasons, Dawson and Poor repeatedly refer to “Dangerous Obsession,” acknowledging that the story is fantasy while nonetheless treating it as if it were evidence of real conduct. Poor becomes exercised and shouts, “What if people don’t ever find out about this? What if it just is allowed to continue on into the future?” And then, with no apparent basis in fact for saying so, he adds this: “We don’t know what else is out there—don’t assume that there’s nothing else out there. This behavior does raise a lot of unanswered questions. . . . I think maybe a little caution here is warranted.”\n\nSix days after Bubba Copeland killed himself and his family and community had been devastated, the editor in chief of 1819 News began to urge caution while continuing to assassinate his character.\n\nNear the end of their podcast, Poor says that although he was “not celebrating the death of Bubba Copeland,” he was “at peace” with the decision to publish.\n\nIt’s easy to see that Bubba was wrong and crossed an ethical line in using the names and images of people he knew in his fiction and other posts. One can only assume that it must have been an awful experience for those two women and the father of that brother and sister to be unexpectedly swept up in this story. But in this Alabama skirmish in a hellish culture war—over gender and speech and objective reality itself—with its dehumanized politics and competing conceptions of heaven, suffused with rage and loss and bereft of much clarity, two things are clear: First, 1819 News wanted the whole world to see Bubba’s posts, without fully understanding what they contained. Before posting its stories, the editorial team there also didn’t seem to know much beyond the few facts they had discovered, things they saw as sensational and repugnant. And second, Bubba Copeland was desperate for his hidden life to remain hidden and never intended for anyone other than perhaps his wife and the other pseudonymous members of his online community to see his posts. He was shattered at the sudden collision of his private and public identities and killed himself.\n\nThe last story 1819 News published about Bubba Copeland came on November 11, eight days after his death. It was a short essay in support of the editorial decision to run the stories, and its conclusion was that Bubba had completed “his rejection of God’s laws” because he had “murdered himself.”\n\nI wrote to 1819 News four times, asking to discuss the stories it published about Bubba Copeland. I did not receive a reply.\n\n\n\nHe gave himself the nickname, as he didn’t much care for “Fred Copeland Jr.” and thought that “Bubba” sounded friendly. He was a standout linebacker for the Smiths Station high school football team, but his real passion in school had been acting in drama productions, because, as he would tell his son, “you can become someone else for a moment.”\n\nWhen he and his first wife, Merrigail, were dating, Bubba sat her down one night and said he had something to tell her. “Have you heard of transgender?” he asked her.\n\n“Bubba, I have no idea what you’re talking about,” she answered. He explained it as best he could, and then Merrigail asked, “Why are we talking about this?”\n\n“Well, I dabble in that,” he said. “There have been times that I have dressed up.”\n\nThe news threw Merrigail, but the attraction between them was so strong that she thought their relationship could withstand anything. The couple were married in 1997, and she would soon come to believe that Bubba had a compulsion that he couldn’t control. When they’d been married for a year or so, they decided to buy a dog. When the day came to pick up the dog, Bubba was working, and so Merrigail and her father, Pastor Langner, walked out to the garage to get some rope to secure a large crate. When she opened up the tool chest on Bubba’s truck, she found that it was full of women’s clothes. Merrigail turned to her father. “Dad, I don’t want to embarrass him,” she said.\n\n“I won’t,” her father said.\n\nA few years later, when she was pregnant with their son Carter, she discovered some “transgender stuff” on his computer one afternoon. When Bubba got home from work, he found Merrigail crying. He apologized profusely, saying that the stress at work was too much for him and that dressing up was an escape. “I’ll try to do better,” he told Merrigail. She knew how bad her husband’s stress was. Bubba worked with his father, who, she felt, “talked to him like he was a dog.” Fred Sr. was a hard man, a combat veteran who had returned from Vietnam and made his fortune in the grocery business in Georgia and Alabama. Bubba would often come home saying that he wanted to do something different with his life.\n\nMerrigail’s father told her, “Sweetheart, he can’t help it. This is who he is.” Langner would counsel his son-in-law with compassion, saying, “Bubba, Christ didn’t come into this world for us to be two people. You can only live one life. You need to decide which life you’re going to lead.”\n\nBY ANDREW HETHERINGTON Mechanics­ville Cemetery, where Bubba would often go to meditate when he was troubled and needed to “calm down.”\n\nIn East Alabama, though, Bubba couldn’t imagine a world where he could be himself in a way that people would accept. The marriage broke down, and when the couple divorced in 2009, Bubba was so despondent that he seriously contemplated suicide. One morning, when Carter was eight years old, he found his father sitting on the floor in the shower, sobbing. “I said, ‘Dad, are you okay? I love you,’ ” Carter remembers. “And he said, ‘I’m okay, buddy. I just need a second.’ ” There’s a nineteenth-century cemetery—Mechanicsville Cemetery, it’s called—near the grocery store Bubba owned, and he would sometimes go there to think when he was troubled. After dropping Carter off with the babysitter, Bubba went to the cemetery, intending to kill himself. He had the barrel of a handgun in his mouth when his phone rang. It was an old friend from town, who told Bubba, “Hey, buddy. The Lord put you on my heart, and I just wanted to tell you I love you.”\n\nThe call stopped Bubba. But his torment would continue.\n\nAfter the divorce, Carter lived mostly with his father and attended the Glenwood School in Smiths Station, a private Christian academy. Bubba was a devoted father, and in the years before he met Angela, his life revolved around Carter. Two things happened in the years before Bubba remarried that would define the relationship between father and son. When he was twelve, Carter came across a digital camera in his father’s closet full of pictures of Bubba dressed in women’s clothes. “This is not something that I ever wanted you to find out,” Bubba told his son.\n\n“I just need to know if you’re doing something really wrong, Dad,” Carter replied.\n\n“Absolutely not,” Bubba answered. “This has been a hobby of mine for a while. It’s my escape.”\n\nWhen Merrigail found out that her son had discovered his father’s secret, she said, “Your dad is an incredible man. Don’t let this change the way that you feel about him.” It didn’t. In fact, it gave Carter the feeling that he could talk to his father about anything.\n\nTwo years later, when Carter was a freshman in high school, he told his father that he was gay and that he was struggling with how to live honestly at school and in the world. He wanted to be free to be himself. God had made him this way. Why would he hide who he was? His father was afraid for Carter and angry that he couldn’t talk him out of coming out publicly. He knew what would happen to him, doing so at such a young age in such a small town, and the two fought bitterly. Bubba wanted him to wait until college to come out, wanted him to go far away, be happy, live his life. Carter decided instead to come out to a cherished teacher who betrayed him to a school administrator, who called Carter into his office and told him that he was going to hell. Once the news spread, Carter experienced what felt like torture. Students would spit on him in the bathroom, throw food at him in the lunchroom, and threaten to physically attack him. The teachers were of no help, as they now hated him, too. There was no safe harbor for the gay kid at the Christian school.\n\nThere is nothing like being the singular locus of a compounding hatred, in a closed system that justifies the hatred and calls it good. After school one day, Carter went home, his head full of monsters, and he swallowed a bottle of pills. And then he walked into his favorite room, the family library with its cathedral ceilings, and lay on the floor and looked up and watched the ceiling fan turn. His father found him there, saw the empty pill bottle, and dragged him to the bathroom, where he put his fingers down Carter’s throat.\n\nIt would be the first of several suicide attempts for Carter. Time after time, his father would save him. And the last time, Bubba just held Carter and told him, “God loves you, Carter. And I love you, too. Don’t listen to those people at school. There’s nothing wrong with you. The only thing wrong with you is the judgment of the world.”\n\n“And then he said this: ‘Carter, if I can survive this, you can survive this, too.’ And we made a pact with each other that day that we would live. We would make ourselves happy, we would make others happy, we would live fulfilled lives. And as long as one of us had to do it, the other had to do it, too. ‘No suicides. Promise?’ ”\n\nCarter says now that he realizes that by coming out when he did, he was trying to show his father that it’s okay, that you can be who you are. It’s all right.\n\n“I had reached a point in my life where I had begun to accept myself,” he says. “I had finally gotten to that point, and now my own father had to go through it. And the people that hated me and wanted me to be morally punished were the same people that took my dad from me.”\n\n\n\nAndrew Hetherington A memorial to Bubba, which was unveiled on March 26, 2024. Part of the Smiths Station memorial sidewalk, the marker is located in front of the Historic Jones Store Museum, a local heritage project that he had championed and that opened in 2019.\n\nIt was the afternoon of Friday, November 3, 2023. The last hour of Bubba Copeland’s life. For days, those who knew him best and loved him most had encircled him, lifting him up, trying to hold tight to keep him from slipping away. Their efforts had seemed to be working. Earlier that day, Bubba had gotten a couple new tires for one of his cars, he’d stopped by the government center in Smiths Station to pick up his new city credit card, he’d checked in at the country market. He’d also sent a long and heartfelt letter to the congregation of First Baptist, thanking them for Pastor Appreciation Day, in which he seemed to see a future. “I look forward to continuing our journey of faith, growth, and service together,” he’d written. Now he’d gone missing. In Auburn, Carter Copeland received a call from his stepmother, Angela. “Your dad just called me. And he said that he loves me and that he’s always loved me and to go to my parents’ house. And then the call dropped off, and now every time I call him, it goes straight to voicemail. I don’t know what to do, Carter. You know him better than anybody. Where is he?”\n\nBy then, the Lee County sheriff’s department had fanned out all over the county to find Bubba and make sure he was okay. It wasn’t just law enforcement, either—Bubba’s friends and family had also begun searching for him, and as Carter ran to his car to make the drive from Auburn, Lisa Deason, who had worked as Bubba’s communications director in Smiths Station, had gone looking for him, too, and was pulling up at Bubba’s house. Deason had helped him draft letters of resignation as mayor and pastor just the day before. The letter resigning from his position as pastor read, in part, “Admittedly, there have been instances where my wife and I have taken private pictures within the confines of our home, which should have never been shared online. I realize this was a significant lapse in judgment and a personal failure, for which I bear complete and absolute responsibility. . . . I apologize for any distress or humiliation my actions may have caused. Love to all, Bubba.” The letter would never be sent.\n\nLike many of his other friends, Deason had been urging Bubba to get out of town for a few days, let the Internet find somebody else to destroy, let things blow over. That morning, though, 1819 News had dropped its second feature on Bubba and, mesmerized by the coverage on his phone, he had started telling people that he didn’t know if he could go on. The night before, Dan Elkins and Jason Price had had a long talk with Bubba about his growing despair, and Elkins had asked him, “Bubba, where are your guns?” Bubba said that he had surrendered his handgun to a safety officer in Smiths Station. As several of his friends would say, though, he lives in the South and his name is Bubba—he’s got more than one gun.\n\nThe latest 1819 News piece seemed to break something in Bubba, unleashing a lethal shame, and by that afternoon his phone was as dangerous a weapon as his gun.\n\nNot finding Bubba at home, Deason stood in the driveway of his house and called 911, saying that her friend was suicidal, and at that moment, his Tahoe pulled up in front of the house on Oakhurst Drive. He got out and left the motor running. “What are you doing here?” he asked her.\n\n“I came to check on you.”\n\n“Who’s with you?”\n\n“I’m by myself.”\n\n“Do not tell Angela where I am. I mean it. Don’t you tell a soul where I am.”\n\nBubba went into the house for no more than thirty seconds, and when he came out he was walking fast and moved to get back in his truck. “I love you,” he told Deason, “but I got to go.”\n\nShe said, “No, I’m not going to let you do this, Bubba! Please don’t do this. You have way more people that love you than you can even imagine. Don’t do this. Don’t do this to your family. Please. Don’t.” Deason was sobbing now and trying to hold on to Bubba, with her arms wrapped around him. No, I’m not letting you leave. Realizing she couldn’t restrain him, she let go, ran around him, jumped into the driver’s seat, turned off the ignition, and grabbed the steering wheel. I’m not going to let you leave.\n\n“I’m going to do it in front of you if you don’t move,” he said. Bubba pulled her out of the truck, and in desperation, she was thinking, What the hell can I do? In that instant, 911 called back, and instead of the operator, it was Jeff Pitts with the sheriff’s department on the line.\n\n“What’s going on?” Pitts asked.\n\n“He’s trying to leave and he won’t listen to me! He’s adamant. He says he’s got to end it.”\n\n“Let me talk to him.”\n\n“Bubba, it’s Major Pitts, Jeff Pitts.”\n\n“Jeff, man, I love you,” Bubba said. “But I’m done. I can’t do this no more.”\n\nBubba handed the phone to Deason, got in his truck, and peeled away.\n\nAs he drove, a cousin who had joined the search pulled up behind him. Bubba told him, If these deputies make me stop, you’re going to see something that I do not want you to see.\n\nCarter was driving 100 miles per hour toward Mechanicsville Cemetery, because he knew his father might be there. He called his father’s number over and over. Nothing. And then his father called him.\n\n“I love you, buddy,” Bubba said. “I’ve lived my whole life to make sure that you are successful and that you have what you need. And I just want you to know that I love you more than anything in this world.”\n\n“I knew immediately what that meant,” Carter says. “And I just said, ‘Please, Dad, please tell me you’re not doing what I think you’re doing. Please, we can get through this.’ ”\n\n“It’s too late, son. I love you. I’m so sorry.”\n\n“I told him, ‘You have nothing to be sorry about. There’s nothing to be sorry for. I love you. You’re my hero. Always will be. This is going to be horrible. We’ll get through it.’ ”\n\n“I’m sorry. This is what I have to do. This is the only way out.”\n\nCarter remembers feeling desperate to hold on, desperate to find the words that would make his father stay, desperate. He screamed at the top of his lungs and felt a rush of emotion such that he thought his vocal cords might explode. I love you! I love you! I love you! I love you! “I screamed it as loud as I could for as long as he was on the line, because I knew he was listening. I knew. I could see he was still on the call. I kept screaming. That’s all I knew to say was, I love you! It’s okay. I love you. It’s okay!”\n\nAnd then silence.\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of Bubba’s death, along a country road in the town of Beulah, Lee County sheriff Jay Jones took possession of his electronic devices, and his office searched them for evidence of criminal conduct. They found none. “In my view, Bubba Copeland would never intentionally do anything to harm anyone,” Jones told me. “I just don’t think that he was that type of person.”\n\nDavid White would write a new sermon for the Sunday after Bubba’s death, staying up well past midnight the night before, sitting at his dinner table, writing in longhand. He would preach Psalm 23:1–6, just as Bubba had in his last service. And he wanted to make sure the world knew that the church had remained true to its pastor and always would. “Despite what may have been implied in the media,” he wrote, “members of this church have been steadfast in their love and concern for our pastor.”\n\nWe all have things that we don’t want other people to know about us. Things that might be hard to explain, even to ourselves. The First Baptist Church of Phenix City did not abandon Bubba Copeland, even after learning the secrets that he might not have been able to explain even to himself.\n\nBubba’s body would be turned away by the two Baptist cemeteries in Smiths Station, his hometown, the town that he loved. He is buried in a private family plot many miles away.\n\nAs I finished my reporting for this story, I took to asking the people in Bubba’s life what they might say to the people at 1819 News if they had the chance. Several told me that they are required to love them and will be praying for them. As Bubba Copeland always said, “God loves you, and so do we.”\n\n",

        "source": "https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/",
        "content": "(Optional Video Accompaniment to This Post)\n\nNow that we’re in a full-fledged trade war with Canada, of all places, I believe we are at a profound disadvantage, because Canadians understand how tariffs work and the president of the United States does not now know how they work and likely never will. From CTV:\n\nOntario Premier Doug Ford says Trump’s tariffs will have devastating impacts on the U.S. auto manufacturing sector, suggesting that assembly lines could “shut down” in the United States within a week. Ford made the comments during an interview with CNN on Tuesday morning. “We are going to continue seeing, in the U.S., plants close, assembly lines shut down. In the auto sector, they may last five maybe eights days,” the premier said. “This is unnecessary and we do have to retaliate and I apologize to the American people. It is not you. It is your president that is causing this problem.” ... Ford tells The Wall Street Journal that the province will slap a 25 per cent export tax on the electricity it provides to 1.5 million homes and businesses in New York, Michigan and Minnesota. Ford also told the newspaper that he will direct energy producers in Ontario to stop exports to the U.S. entirely if President Donald Trump follows through on a threat of implementing more tariffs as of April 2.\n\nPrime Minister Justin Trudeau addressed the nation on Tuesday morning and, showing an understanding of how tariffs actually work, explained that Canada is unimpressed with the political salience of our president’s abject ignorance. From CTV:\n\nToday, the United States launched a trade war against Canada, their closest partner and ally, their closest friend. At the same time, they’re talking about working positively with Russia, appeasing Vladimir Putin, a lying, murderous dictator. Make that make sense. Canadians are reasonable and we are polite, but we will not back down from a fight. Our tariffs will remain in place until the U.S. tariffs are withdrawn and not a moment sooner. I want to speak first directly to the American people: We don’t want this. We want to work with you, as a friend and ally. And we don’t want to see you hurt, either. But your government has chosen to do this to you.\n\nDonald, in the over eight years you and I have worked together, we’ve done big things. We signed a historic deal that has created record jobs and growth in both of our countries. We’ve done big things together on the world stage. And now, we should be working together to ensure even greater prosperity.\n\nIn this, Trudeau is referencing the deal cut during the president’s first term in office, which the president declared at the time to be the greatest bargain struck since Napoleon sold President Jefferson the entire Big 12 Conference back in 1803. This was a deft turning of the knife. In response, the president reached deeply into his bag of incoherence. From the Hill:\n\nTrump said Monday that “vast amounts of fentanyl got poured into our country” mostly through Mexico and from China and suggested car manufacturers build factories in the U.S. to successfully sidestep the levies. “So, what they have to do is build their car plants, frankly, and other things in the United States, in which case, they have no tariffs.\"\n\nInterestingly, given this country’s dependence on Canadian timber, the president on Monday announced that he would be opening up huge portions of the country’s national forests for timber harvesting, completely ignoring existing regulations regarding the preservation of endangered species because ignoring his duty to see that the laws are faithfully executed is about his only real skill. From The Guardian:\n\nTrump has instructed the US Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management to increase logging targets and for officials to circumvent the US’s Endangered Species Act by using unspecified emergency powers to ignore protections placed upon vulnerable creatures’ habitats.\n\n\n\nThe order also stipulates logging projects can be sped up if they are for purported wildfire risk reduction, via “thinning” of vegetation that could ignite. Some scientists have said that aggressively felling forests, particularly established, fire-resistant trees, actually increases the risk of fast-moving fires. “This Trump executive order is the most blatant attempt in American history by a president to hand over federal public lands to the logging industry,” said Chad Hanson, wildfire scientist at the John Muir Project. “What’s worse, the executive order is built on a lie, as Trump falsely claims that more logging will curb wildfires and protect communities, while the overwhelming weight of evidence shows exactly the opposite.”\n\nSo far, the tariffs have not touched Canadian lumber imports, but the handwriting is pretty much carved into the trunks. The president has ordered an “investigation” into whether lumber imports from Canada are endangering our national security. From The New York Times:\n\nThe president has also initiated national security investigations into steel, aluminum and copper, but those metals are directly used by the military to make planes, ships and weaponry. Asked about the national security justification, the White House official said that the military was a major consumer of lumber.\n\nTo paraphrase Jim Hightower, if lumber is necessary to our national security, I want the logging rights to the president’s head.",

        "source": "https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/",
        "content": "So we’re disappearing people now? Nice to know.\n\nFrom Zeteo:\n\nAccording to the advocates, at around 8:30 PM, Khalil and his wife—who is eight months pregnant—had just unlocked the door to their building when two plainclothes DHS agents pushed inside behind them. The agents allegedly did not identify themselves at first, instead asking for Khalil’s identity before detaining him.\n\nThe agents proceeded to tell Khalil’s wife that if she did not leave her husband and go to their apartment, they would arrest her too. The agents claimed that the State Department had revoked Khalil’s student visa, with one agent presenting what he claimed was a warrant on his cell phone. But Khalil, according to advocates, has a green card. Khalil’s wife went to their apartment to get the green card. “He has a green card,” an agent apparently said on the phone, confused by the matter. But then after a moment, the agent claimed that the State Department had “revoked that too.” Meanwhile, Khalil had been on the phone with his attorney, Amy Greer, who was trying to intervene, asking why he was being detained, if they had a warrant, and explaining that Khalil was a green card holder. The attorney had circled back to demanding to see a warrant when the agents apparently instead hung up the phone. Khalil is currently being held in an ICE detention center in Louisiana, per the ICE detention tracker.\n\nThat’s a comfort to his wife, I’m sure, and to those of us who remember being angry at the Bush Administration’s rendition policies. Are we now allowing the rendition of legal residents to black sites in the United States? Where would he be in Louisiana? Angola? That would be fun. There are six federal prison facilities in that state. One of those facilities in Oakdale was the subject of a Department of Justice report in 2020 for refusing to follow the Covid protocols mandated by the U.S. Bureau of Prisons during the pandemic. Eight prisoners died there.\n\nIn any event, what the hell is this? Disappearing a legal resident because he led a protest against the actions of another country? . From The New York Times:\n\nA spokeswoman for the Department of Homeland Security, Tricia McLaughlin, said in a statement on Sunday night that Mr. Khalil had been arrested “in support of President Trump’s executive orders prohibiting antisemitism.” “Khalil led activities aligned to Hamas, a designated terrorist organization,” she said. “ICE and the Department of State are committed to enforcing President Trump’s executive orders and to protecting U.S. national security.” Secretary of State Marco Rubio shared a link on X to a news article about Mr. Khalil’s arrest and issued a broad promise: “We will be revoking the visas and/or green cards of Hamas supporters in America so they can be deported.”\n\n“Aligned to”? That’s what they have? Until there’s a complete airing of the reasons for Khalil’s detention, I have no problem believing this to be an attack on protected political speech—and a dress rehearsal for what this administration has planned if widespread protests of its other policies break out. (And that may be closer than you think. There were large demonstrations in Chicago this weekend, and the president and his lacke ... er ... officials already have made ominous noises about revenging themselves against people and institutions that harsh their mellows. Maybe Vice President J. Divan Vance can lecture his boss about free speech the way he lectured Europe a few weeks back.",

        "source": "https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/",
        "content": "(Optional Musical Accompaniment to This Post)\n\nSometimes, and more often these days, the headline says it all. From Reuters:\n\nNASA terminates chief scientist role...\n\nWhy should NASA, of all places, have the luxury of a chief scientist? Is that waste or fraud or abuse?\n\nNASA’s acting administrator Janet Petro told employees by email on Monday the Office of the Chief Scientist, the Office of Science, Policy, and Strategy, and the diversity, equity and inclusion branch within the Office of Diversity and Equal Opportunity would be closed. The email was seen by Reuters.\n\nMany of NASA’s 18,000 employees have been anxious over the Trump administration efforts to trim back the federal bureaucracy, which have been spearheaded by Elon Musk and the Department of Government Efficiency. Musk’s rocket company, SpaceX, has contracts worth roughly $15 billion with NASA, according to federal contracting data.\n\nActually, were I seeking to eliminate waste in the NASA budget, I might examine the $15 billion parceled out to a company that’s been regularly raining debris all over the Caribbean, but that’s just me.\n\nPetro said in the email that NASA had been actively working with the U.S. Office of Personnel Management to implement Trump’s January executive order directing government agencies to reduce and reorganize their workforce. NASA’s policy, diversity and science offices are the latest space-focused units in the U.S. to be affected by Trump and Musk’s government efficiency agenda.\n\nIt is important—and very sad—to note that the current chief scientist, Katherine Calvin, is a prominent climatologist who has contributed to several United Nations reports on the climate crisis, and last month Calvin and several other delegates were denied permission to attend a climate conference in China. And this reminds us that the administration is laying off 1,100 people at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. But this administration has wished the climate crisis out into the Phantom Zone, so I’m sure none of this will matter.",

        "source": "https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/",
        "content": "From Politico:\n\nTo fulfill conservative demands to cut non-defense funding, Republican leaders are seeking to zero out funding for a slew of programs—much of which had previous been subject to earmarks personally requested by lawmakers. The bill, for instance, does not renew $40 million in fiscal 2024 funding for more than 70 programs that help children and families. Most had been requested by Democratic senators, but not all: Republican Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith previously secured $250,000 for a group that works to prevent child abuse in her home state of Mississippi and GOP Sen. Lisa Murkowski requested more than $5 million to help fund homeless shelters and prevent child abuse in Alaska.\n\nAlso forgone are $890 million in grants for health care facilities and equipment. Again, the fiscal 2024 funding had been distributed on a bipartisan basis: GOP Sens. Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, Markwayne Mullin of Oklahoma, Roger Wicker of Mississippi were among those who requested funding for clinics and hospitals in their states. Bipartisan emergency preparedness and disaster mitigation projects funded through $293 million of earmarked FEMA dollars are also not renewed, as well as $116 million in Small Business Administration funding and $107 million in workforce development projects. Clean water projects, law enforcement grants and tribal assistance are also targeted in the bill.\n\nThis is the “stopgap” bill that Speaker Moses plans to pass in the House on Tuesday, whereupon he reportedly intends to adjourn the House, dumping this extraordinary lump of toxic cruelty in the Senate’s lap. With a Friday deadline for a government shutdown, this allegedly would put pressure on Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer. If enough Democrats don’t cross party lines to vote for the bill and the government does shut down, they could get blamed for it. But Speaker Moses needs eight Senate Democrats for this strategy to work—Kentucky Republican Senator Rand Paul already has come out against the bill. (Senator Aqua Buddha has his reasons, but I think paramount among them is his unquenchable desire to be a pain in the ass.)\n\nI don’t think Schumer can lose eight members of his caucus over this bill, but given the mixed signals from all parts of the Democratic Party these days, I’m not sure anything can be taken for granted. What I do know is that this bill should have been smothered in its cradle by any legislator with a soul. Targeting clean-water projects? Man, fck these people.",

        "source": "https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/",
        "content": "(Permanent Musical Accompaniment to the Last Post of the Week from the Blog’s Favourite Living Canadian)\n\n\n\nIt appears at the moment that the reign of error brought to the government by Elon Musk and the Cargo Shorts Crew may be coming to an end. First of all, the White House is showing signs that it’s run out of patience with Musk’s independent rampage through the executive branch. From The New York Times:\n\nYou have fired “nobody,” Mr. Musk told Mr. Rubio, then scornfully added that perhaps the only person he had fired was a staff member from Mr. Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency. Mr. Rubio had been privately furious with Mr. Musk for weeks, ever since his team effectively shuttered an entire agency that was supposedly under Mr. Rubio’s control: the United States Agency for International Development. But, in the extraordinary cabinet meeting in front of President Trump and around 20 others—details of which have not been reported before—Mr. Rubio got his grievances off his chest.\n\nMr. Musk was not being truthful, Mr. Rubio said. What about the more than 1,500 State Department officials who took early retirement in buyouts? Didn’t they count as layoffs? He asked, sarcastically, whether Mr. Musk wanted him to rehire all those people just so he could make a show of firing them again. Then he laid out his detailed plans for reorganizing the State Department.\n\nLittle Marco Unchained!\n\nCabinet officials almost uniformly like the concept of what Mr. Musk set out to do—reducing waste, fraud, and abuse in government—but have been frustrated by the chain saw approach to upending the government and the lack of consistent coordination. Thursday’s meeting, which was abruptly scheduled on Wednesday evening, was a sign that Mr. Trump was mindful of the growing complaints. He tried to offer each side something by praising both Mr. Musk and his cabinet secretaries. (At least one, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who has had tense encounters related to Mr. Musk’s team, was not present.) The president made clear he still supported the mission of the Musk initiative. But now was the time, he said, to be a bit more refined in its approach.\n\nWhen this president resorts to How Things Are Supposed to Work, you know he’s cornered. He and his people have to be aware that Musk and what he’s done, while popular in theory, is incredibly unpopular in specific cases. Republicans in Congress, particularly in the Senate, are beginning to find themselves heated up back home. I mean, some of them even pleaded their case directly to the Porcelain Man himself. From The Washington Post:\n\nThough many Republican lawmakers support Musk’s mission, some have in recent weeks complained about a lack of communication about DOGE plans. Musk told a group of Republican senators in a closed-door lunch that he wanted to set up a direct line for them when they have questions, allowing them to get a near-instant response to their concerns, senators said. Some senators were given Musk’s phone number during Wednesday’s meeting, and the entrepreneur said he would “create a system where members of Congress can call some central group” to get problematic cuts reversed quickly, Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-South Carolina) said.\n\nThe meeting was the first sign that, after weeks of burrowing into federal agencies and attempting to lay off hundreds of thousands of federal workers, Musk recognizes he needs Congress’s cooperation to make a lasting impact on U.S. spending. On Wednesday, the Supreme Court rejected the Trump administration’s ongoing freeze of nearly $2 billion in foreign aid—a decision Musk told the senators he had read.\n\nNice of him to realize we still have a Constitution and all that. Somebody strike his Medal of Freedom. It also seems to matter that his chain-saw routine has begun to result in a noticeable losing streak in the federal courts. In his newsletter, Josh Marshall blows the whistle on the whole DOGE and Pony Show.\n\nBut it remains unclear if Republicans are willing to vote to support Musk. Some lawmakers are worried about the political price they could pay for DOGE, as constituents deluge their offices with angry phone calls and show up in droves to town halls that leaders have urged lawmakers to avoid. Some members have resented that lack of communication.\n\nBut the key is that the budget is being changed without anyone actually knowing what’s happening. Even members of Congress. It’s important to note that literally nothing DOGE is doing is public. Everything we think we know is from press reporting based on leaks. So no one knows what’s happening and no one who is accountable to anyone at an election is actually doing it. Some Republican senators are coming in now, as the article explains, and saying ‘hey we get the final word here. Nothing is official until we vote.’ But that’s BS. USAID and CFPB and huge swaths of the federal government have already been shut down. So for calendar 2025 the decision has already been made. And to a great extent DOGE is creating faits accompli into the future. Once you fire everyone and cancel all the contracts you can’t just flip a switch and it comes back into existence. That’s all by design.\n\nEssentially, the Republican legislators are asking Musk to bail them out so they don’t have to vote in public on his foolishness. The fundamental cowardice of Republican officeholders is really something to see.\n\nOver at the DOD, Secretary Pete Hegseth has been beavering away at wringing the DEI out of Defense Department materials. This is being done with the careful processes that are a hallmark of this administration. From the AP:\n\nDefense Secretary Pete Hegseth had given the military until Wednesday to remove content that highlights diversity efforts in its ranks following President Donald Trump’s executive order ending those programs across the federal government. The vast majority of the Pentagon purge targets women and minorities, including notable milestones made in the military. And it also removes a large number of posts that mention various commemorative months—such as those for Black and Hispanic people and women. In some cases, photos seemed to be flagged for removal simply because their file included the word “gay,” including service members with that last name and an image of the B-29 aircraft Enola Gay, which dropped the first atomic bomb on Hiroshima, Japan, during World War II.\n\nSeveral photos of an Army Corps of Engineers dredging project in California were marked for deletion, apparently because a local engineer in the photo had the last name Gay. And a photo of Army Corps biologists was on the list, seemingly because it mentioned they were recording data about fish—including their weight, size, hatchery and gender.\n\nClowns to the left of me, clowns to the right of me, volleyed and thundered...\n\nWeekly WWOZ Pick to Click: “Ghost of the Blues” (Sidney Bechet): Yeah, I still pretty much love New Orleans.\n\nWeekly Visit to the Pathé Archives: It being Women’s History Month and all, here, from 1916, is the first woman zookeeper in the UK. Granted, her duties were limited to working with chickens in an exhibit demonstrating how keeping your own poultry was a good hedge against wartime shortages, but small steps, right? And don’t get too arrogant about the whole thing. This week, in 20freaking25, the Secretary of Agriculture recommended that we keep our own chickens if egg prices continue to rise. History is so cool, especially when it repeats itself.\n\nThe very worst story to come out of the Grand Sellout is probably this one served up by Politico Europe. It seems that the administration has been in touch with Ukrainian opposition politicians in an effort to submarine the Zelenskyy government. If you interpret this news as the administration’s possible willingness to countenance a coup that would install a government that would agree to the kind of draconian deal favored by both the Trump and Putin governments, well, shame on you, anyway.\n\nThe official line from the U.S. administration is that Trump is not interfering in Ukraine’s domestic politics. This week, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick denied his boss was “weighing into Ukrainian politics,” adding all that Trump wants is a partner for peace. But the behavior of Trump and his officials suggests quite the opposite. Trump has accused Zelenskyy of being a “dictator without elections,” and hinted he would not be “around very long” if he didn’t do a deal with Russia. Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard has falsely accused Kyiv of canceling the election. (In response to the news in this article, Elon Musk tweeted: “Ukraine needs to hold an election. Zelensky would lose by a landslide.”)\n\nPolls suggest otherwise, of course. Musk doesn’t know fck-all about Ukrainian politics. But history tells us that, when the U.S. arranges a coup, they usually work. Zelenskyy needs to watch his back.\n\nDiscovery Corner: Hey, look at what we found! From Smithsonian:\n\nBeginning some 3,000 years ago, Southeast Asian peoples began voyaging out into the Pacific and settling the islands of Polynesia. These ancient sailors navigated by the stars, traversing the ocean in large canoes carved from trees. Now, one of those boats, known as a waka, has been found in hundreds of pieces in New Zealand’s Chatham Islands. Experts say the artifact could be one of the most significant discoveries of its kind. “No matter how old it is, we can’t overstate how incredible it is,” Justin Maxwell, the archaeologist leading the investigation, tells the Guardian’s Veronika Meduna. “It will go down as one of the most important finds of all time in Polynesia.”\n\nAs regular visitors to the shebeen know, we have a preference for accidental finds that change history, and this one is a doozy.\n\n“My son and I were just loading the boat up and taking the dogs for a run up the beach … just after a big rain,” Vincent, a local fisherman, tells Radio New Zealand. Then, Nikau saw pieces of timber in the river. The wood sported strange holes, and it appeared to be well preserved. “We were like, ‘Sweet, some new timber for us to use,’ ” Nikau tells Myjanne Jensen and Hikurangi Jackson of the TV series “Te Ao with Moana.” “We took it all home [and] started putting it together, just trying to find out what it was about. … And we were like, ‘Hey, this is starting to form the shape of a boat.’ ”\n\nA fisherman. His son. Their dog, and a find that thrills the experts. Get me the Netflix people, stat!\n\nHey, Popular Science, is it a good day for dinosaur news? It’s always a good day for dinosaur news!\n\nFrom its well-preserved bones, the paleontologists believe that Chadititan was a small and slender dinosaur, with elongated vertebrae and delicate limbs that set it apart from other titanosaurs. It was an herbivore and belonged to the Rinconsaurian group.\n\nAt 22 feet, this new find is one of the less titanic of the titanosauria, but it was found in the middle of a treasure trove of other fossils, including hundreds of turtles.\n\nThe bones were uncovered near a salt flat in the Anacleto Formation in northern Patagonia, Argentina, and found among fossils of ancient snails, garfishes, crocodile relatives, clams, freshwater turtles, and other organisms. Among this prehistoric treasure trove, the team uncovered the first fossil record of a family of tropical land snails—Neocyclotidae—and the first example of a small, tropical air-breathing land snail in the genus Leptinaria. This area was once a small pond surrounded by sand dunes and palm trees in what was a more arid and dry environment.\n\nNice to know it had company. And “air-breathing land snail” is odds-on to be useful in our coverage of the current administration. Just another way that they lived then to make us happy now.\n\nI’ll be back on Monday, for whatever fresh hell awaits... Be well and play nice, ya bastids. Stay above the snake-line and wear the damn masks, and take the damn shots, especially the boosters and the New One. In your spare time, spare a thought for everyone touched by the floods in Kentucky and in West Virginia, and by the crash in Washington, and by the measles outbreak in the Southwest, and in the fire zones in Los Angeles, and for all the folks in Ukraine, who stubbornly fight on, and all the folks in Gaza, and all the people in New Orleans, Las Vegas, Nashville, and Queens, who were visited by the Crazy before the year had hardly begun. And the folks in L.A., now fighting floods and mudslides exacerbated by the recent wildfires. And the folks in Lahaina, who are still rebuilding. And all the folks we regularly cited here in the year gone by, and especially for our fellow citizens in the LGBTQ+ community, who deserve so much better from their country than they’ve been getting. And for all of us, who will be getting exactly what we deserve.",

        "content": "Mark Peterson/Redux\n\nDonald Trump won the 2020 election,” Steve Bannon pronounces. “Of that there is not even a question.\"\n\nObviously you expect me not to agree with you, I say. “Of course I expect you not to agree with me,” he says. “And I’m also not looking for you to agree with me. And I also don’t give a fuck who in the mainstream media agrees or disagrees with me.”\n\nAnd so off we go—about this and about Covid (the Bannon view: “It’s 100 percent a bioweapon—fucking not even a question”) and about vaccines (“I would never in ten million years get this vaccine,” Bannon says, and asks if I would; I simply hand him my vax card, which he looks at with apparent amazement: “I’ve never . . .”) and about what I view—but naturally Bannon doesn’t—as his incessant anti-Semitic dog-whistling. At one point, he rhapsodizes about the range of information available to people these days.\n\nOr misinformation, I say.\n\n“A wide range of information,” he counters. “One man’s misinformation may be somebody else’s Holy Grail, right?”\n\nI hardly agree—this seems a terrifying equivalence to me—but he’s already on to something else.\n\nWe are sitting out back of a home Bannon has near Tucson on the last day of July. The conversation is interrupted by a call on his cell. Here, for the record, is how Bannon says hello: “What the fuck don’t you understand about one o’clock?” The caller is Peter Navarro, who worked in the White House on economic issues throughout the Trump administration. Navarro went missing for this morning’s prerecorded episode of Bannon’s mouthpiece TV show and podcast, War Room, when Bannon was expecting him to pick apart Ron DeSantis’s new speech on economic policy. Bannon’s soon making nice but, as he often does, led with the loud.\n\nCall over, he’s soon back in the flow. When I ask him what he wants people to think of him, he offers up the manifesto of a valiant, tireless warrior.\n\nMark Peterson/Redux Asked about the potential for history to judge him wrong about everything, Bannon said, “That will be impossible.”\n\n“I don’t care,” he replies. “Whatever they think. You’ve got so much time in this vale of tears, right, to use your agency. And you’ve got to be able to look in the mirror every day and just say, I’m leaving it all on the field, and I’m nonstop, all that. And whatever they think, they think. Remember, as much as I’m hated by—and/or dismissed by—the mainstream media or the Left, I’m much more hated and dismissed by the Republican establishment. Hated. Hated. So I don’t care. History is going to be the judge. Remember, over time history judges things very differently. There are people today that are heroes that were looked at as goats. I mean, look at Oppenheimer. It changes over time. So I think you just got to do what you have to do and let the cards fall where they may. I can look at the results. I can see what’s happening. I see how we’re changing American political history. We’re ascending. We’re getting bigger.”\n\nAnd what if history decides you were wrong about everything?\n\n“That will be impossible.”\n\nWe continue this back-and-forth, which somehow seems both necessary and futile, for more than three hours, then take a break for the day. As for what happens later that evening, how you choose to interpret it may depend on how you feel about science and meteorology and the vagaries of energy flow; on how you feel about chance and numbers and the random play of improbable events; on how you feel about the existence or nonexistence of God and His interventionist tendencies; on how you feel about fate and symbols and auguries. And, of course, on how you feel about coincidences.\n\nThese, anyway, are the facts:\n\nBannon goes to bed early. Around eight o’clock in the evening, he is awoken by what sounds like an explosion. (“Dude, I’m telling you, we thought the house had blown up. I’ve never had, even on my Navy ship—I’ve never been that direct a hit.”) Right outside the front door of Bannon’s house, just to the left as you enter—and precisely above War Room’s makeshift Arizona studio—stands a date palm, maybe forty feet high. A lightning bolt had hit the palm’s trunk, just above the height of the roof, and flames are now climbing both upward to the fronds and down the trunk.\n\n“That entire beautiful palm was literally lit up like a torch,” Bannon tells me. “It was raining fire.”\n\n\n\nOne problem with hating pretty much everything Steve Bannon says and everything he stands for is that it might be exactly what he wants. “I hope they say I’m a devil,” he’ll tell me. “I hope they say I’m a fucking demon. I could give a fuck less. All I want to do is win.” Another is that maybe such dilemmas are a distraction, masking more crucial questions. For instance: Is Bannon truly someone forever playing the game several levels above and ahead of the rest of us, his every ambiguous zig and zag calculated to further a majestic master plan? Or is he actually just one more big-talking huckster, brazenly improvising whatever he can with whichever tools he can muster, making it all up as he goes? Or—maybe the most chastening possibility of all—might it be that in our modern-day runaway world of increasingly fractured and divided truths, there’s no longer a meaningful difference between the two?\n\nBannon’s past offers contradictory clues. He launched himself into most people’s consciousness as the unkempt, take-no-prisoners agitator who took over Donald Trump’s faltering presidential campaign in August 2016. After Trump defied most predictions by winning the election that November and Bannon was appointed chief strategist in the White House, a notorious Time magazine cover story suggested that Bannon might be the second-most-powerful man in the world. The implication was that Bannon—“the great manipulator,” as Time’s cover line proclaimed him—was pulling the strings of the first. Six months later, in circumstances that remain disputed, Bannon was gone. Since then, he has hovered hazily in the middle distance. Looked at through one lens, he is the radical Right’s great ideologue, propagandist, and strategist, orchestrating both overtly and covertly a global agenda that is currently focused on bringing Donald Trump back to the White House before fundamentally reordering American society. Looked at through another, that’s exactly what he needs people to think as he wages the endless uphill battle for relevance and influence.\n\nWhatever he is, he’s not lazy. War Room typically broadcasts live twenty-two hours a week, preaching a version of America crafted to horrify anyone not swept along with its relentless presentation of a country at the precipice’s edge, time running out unless enough good people inform themselves of the truths being hidden from them, then organize themselves to resist. To an outsider’s ears, it is not just the supposed truths, and the cavalcade of what are presented as supporting facts, that can seem at best unfamiliar, at worst poisonously inaccurate. This is a world with a whole disorientating language of its own. Here—to get a sense of both the substance and cadence of this upside-down world—is a selective glossary:\n\nThe Keebler Elves: Bannon’s disdainful collective term for the other candidates running against Donald Trump for the Republican nomination. Bannon, as an all-in Trump advocate, agitates against what he depicts as a pointless competition, a needlessly divisive distraction, and a waste of resources given that, in his way of seeing, the end result is already inevitable.\n\nMark Peterson/Redux Bannon often embraces harsh criticisms—that he’s “a cancer,” for example, or that he has no conscience—as a kind of proof of purpose.\n\nThe Biden crime family: It is an article of faith in this world not just that Hunter Biden’s international business relationships embodied an extensive, calculated corruption and criminality, one that has been systematically covered up by the Democratic and judicial establishments, but also that President Biden and other members of his family knowingly participated in, and received large sums of money from, these relationships, and that the president is consequently compromised in his dealings with sundry foreign powers.\n\nJudas Pence: Another inviolable article of faith in this world is that the 2020 election was stolen. For those who believe this, pretty much everything that ensued was part of a valiant fight for truth, a fight in which they were betrayed on January 6, 2021, by Vice President Pence’s supposed failure to prevent the certification of the 2020 vote.\n\nLawfare: A further article of faith is that all of the current legal proceedings against Donald Trump are coordinated charges that have been concocted to prevent his return to power, and that in this the judiciary is controlled and steered by the Democratic establishment in what amounts to an act of warfare by putatively legal means, i.e., lawfare.\n\nThe Uniparty: Bannon expresses as much, if not more, disdain and hate for the Republican establishment as for Democrats. In his vision, the two share so many common interests in the status quo that they resist in lockstep the kinds of radical changes Bannon believes are needed, effectively operating in the shadows as a single united party (an idea, Bannon points out, once explored in the writings of Gore Vidal).\n\nTV for stupid people: Bannon’s routine term for his hated Fox News, which he considers “an insidious cancer inside the conservative movement.”\n\n“No coincidences”: A phrase regularly invoked in reference to a sign in Bannon’s Washington studio that reads, “There are NO conspiracies, but there are NO coincidences. Stephen K. Bannon”—a convenient rhetorical back door to what often seems exactly like conspiratorial thinking.\n\nThe sunlit uplands: The term Bannon often throws out—generally, as with all these terms, without explanation—to denote a happier place we will eventually find ourselves at the end of the necessary turmoil he aims to instigate. The phrase is borrowed from a famous speech given by Winston Churchill in 1940 to inspire the British people in their fight against Hitler.\n\nThat is the sound of War Room. There are often, however, soft words about one particular subject. “We’re getting the best Trump right now,” Bannon told his audience this morning. “I can tell you, having had the honor and privilege of working with the president since 2016, when you meet, when you see him now in private, this is the best Trump we’ve ever had: on point, focused, on fire, take-no-prisoners, understands exactly what the task and purpose is.”\n\nLater, Bannon and I retire once more to his Arizona back patio for further conversation. A fountain burbles behind us; hummingbirds flit around. Lizards skitter across the ground. At one point a hawk flies by. “They keep the rats away,” he says, “so God bless them.” He continues where he left off on the show: “Here’s why I tell people, donors and all these guys. I said, You’re missing the point. You may hate Trump. You’re stuck with Trump. There’s nobody, while Trump’s breathing, that they’ll vote for.”\n\n\n\nEngaging in discourse with—and writing about—someone like Steve Bannon presents a peculiar challenge.\n\n\n\n\n\nLast year, in The Atlantic magazine, Jennifer Senior wrote an extensive and compelling profile that forensically unpicked the ways she saw Bannon “attempting to insert a lit bomb into the mouth of American democracy.” Senior referred to his “industrial-grade bullshit” and “straight up megalomania” and to his War Room show as “a mighty river of ordure.” In her story, a chorus of former colleagues fingered Bannon as “a con man” and “a cancer,” someone who “stumbled into the MAGA movement as a way to make money and to get fame and fortune” and who “may well be mentally unstable, in a frightening, disturbing kind of way,” even someone who could be legitimately compared—“we have seen his sinister form before”—to Hitler. Though the article also respectfully strained to convey something of the world as Bannon sees it, I presume that most Atlantic readers consumed it as a devastating takedown.\n\nThough, as it turns out, not all of them.\n\n“I thought that was terrific,” Bannon tells me. “I thought it was a great piece.”\n\nIt’s hard not to let it get into your head, this imperviousness. It’s not just that Bannon seems impervious to the most obvious lines of attack; it’s that he seems to relish and feed off them. Here is CNN’s Jake Tapper speaking of this world: “And where do people like that go to share the big lie? MAGA media. . . . I wish, I wish in my soul, that any of these people had a conscience.” And why am I so familiar with this quote? Because it is part of the montage that begins every episode of War Room, a montage that is generally followed by fresh media snippets from the previous twenty-four hours, frequently showcasing full-on, pointed—and often, to my ears, effective—mainstream eviscerations of the latest events and tendencies in what we might call Bannon-Trump world. You might expect the targets of such critiques to ignore or sidestep them; instead, Bannon leans into them, as though he considers them testimonials, as proofs of purpose. For instance, one day in August he’ll play a long clip from Morning Joe of Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski taking apart the duplicitous logic of the Right, culminating in Scarborough saying, “They know it’s a lie. They really do. They know it’s a lie. They know the game they’re playing. . . . They can never just say, ‘It’s wrong that he stole nuclear secrets and no president or former president has ever done that in American history.’ ‘It’s wrong that he tried to overthrow a presidential election.’ ” And then the broadcast cuts to a clearly delighted Bannon, smirking. “This was a gem,” he tells his audience. “They’re just in full meltdown.” The front Bannon presents, whether as astute tactics or bluff, is: Agree with us and we fly. Attack us, deride us, scorn us, demean us and we soar.\n\nThis article appeared in the Winter 2023 issue of Esquire\n\nsubscribe\n\nNot long after Bannon left the White House, he was contacted by the documentarian Errol Morris. Back in 2003, Bannon had attended the American premiere of The Fog of War, Morris’s artful (and Oscar-winning) interrogation of Robert McNamara’s role in the debacles of the Vietnam War, at the Telluride Film Festival. “It’s one of the things that motivated me to really want to be, eventually, a documentary director,” says Bannon. (One of the many strands of Bannon’s earlier career—sometimes depicted as a triumphant restless visionary journey through a dazzling array of disciplines, sometimes as a textbook example of how a man who talks the right kind of game can keep failing upward—is his role as the maker of ambitious proselytizing right-wing documentaries.) “The nonlinear way he told the story just blew me away. Plus the fact that McNamara still didn’t quite get it, right?” Later, Bannon saw The Unknown Known, Morris’s 2013 film about Donald Rumsfeld: “I thought that was a disaster for Rumsfeld. I thought it exposed all the things that people had thought about him, of how he’s so certain on stuff—just like McNamara—and it’d get you in these horrible situations, right?” As Bannon remembers it, Morris now proposed making a film about Bannon that would be the third in this series, and Bannon’s response was this: “I said, Look, Robert McNamara and Rumsfeld, those guys are world historical figures. I’m some schmendrick that ran a little news site”—before taking over the Trump campaign in 2016, Bannon had been in charge of the right-leaning website Breitbart News—“and I spent a couple months at the White House. There’s no film there. And he goes: Let me determine that.”\n\nOn the surface, the strangest thing about Bannon’s account of this film’s genesis is his apparent lack of worry about being the third panel of a triptych, slotted in alongside Morris’s coruscating portrayals of McNamara and Rumsfeld. The resultant film, American Dharma, was anchored around excerpts from fifteen or so hours of Morris interviewing Bannon. “I made the movie ultimately because I was interested in Steve Bannon—or, if you like, the nature of Steve Bannon’s evil,” Morris tells me. “I’ve always been interested in difficult characters, in morally compromised characters, and Bannon didn’t seem to me in any way outside of that interest.” To its maker, it was perfectly clear what the movie showed. “American Dharma, properly considered, is a warning,” Morris says.\n\nBannon’s reaction to the film will, by now, come as little shock. “I thought it was fantastic,” he tells me. “If you look at Rumsfeld and McNamara, you come out and understand how they got us into these debacles and still don’t understand what they did. Well, I think there’s no doubt in that film Stephen K. Bannon fully understands exactly what he has helped wrought and is quite comfortable taking 100 percent accountability for that.”\n\nPerhaps more surprising—and perhaps a bellwether of the increasingly intolerant ways in which storytelling around divisive and controversial subjects is nowadays judged—was how many commentators saw American Dharma as sympathetic to Bannon, and unacceptably so. For whatever it was worth, in the interviews Morris gave to promote the film he allowed less room for doubt, talking of “Bannon’s sadism” and “almost diabolical destructiveness,” his “smokescreen of bullshit” and “world of real nastiness.” Morris warned that Bannon “is not a moron but he is a cynical bastard, and no one, absolutely no one, should turn their back on him” and noted that he might be “one of the most dangerous men in the world.”\n\nBannon tells me that he considers these last two observations compliments.\n\nThe morning after the lightning strike, Bannon stands outside his house, surveying the damage, alongside a man who has come to work out what should be done about it. The fire department arrived last night in about six minutes, extinguishing the flames, but the top half of the trunk is blackened and embers litter the ground. The palm tree, Bannon is told, is dead and must be removed. Bannon asks whether they can replace it with one of the same height.\n\n“Maybe a little bit shorter?” the man proposes. Bannon seems disheartened by this suggestion. The man points out that, in time, the new tree will grow.\n\n“Okay,” says Bannon, “but how long does it take to grow that high? I won’t be around that long.”\n\nBrent Stirton/Contour Photos/Getty Images Bannon was in the orbit of the January 6, 2021, insurrection—he spoke with former president Trump that morning and evening—but he hasn’t elaborated on his involvement.\n\nWhen we return to the back patio—the temperature will peak at 102 today, but Bannon is in his usual two collared shirts over a T-shirt—we further discuss Donald Trump. From the outside, his alliance with Trump has sometimes looked less than straightforward. Bannon concedes that he was not an easy fit with what was required in his abbreviated time in the White House. “Look, I’m incredibly headstrong, I got that,” he says. “And I want you to be a partner if you kind of agree with where we ought to go.” Immediately after his departure, he and his former boss remained in contact—when Bannon gave a high-profile interview about his experiences to 60 Minutes, Trump called him and was, says Bannon, “very positive.” A schism became apparent a few months later, in January 2018, when Michael Wolff’s book Fire and Fury, an intimate account of the Trump presidency’s early days, was published. Bannon appeared to be a key source, and his views of Trump and others around him were not always flattering. Trump put out a statement denouncing Bannon—“when he was fired, he not only lost his job, he lost his mind”—then followed up with a tweet referring to “Sloppy Steve Bannon, who cried when he got fired and begged for his job. Now Sloppy Steve has been dumped like a dog by almost everyone. Too bad!”\n\n“That’s a great line,” says Bannon when I cite the “cried when he got fired” sentence. “It’s a great line. I’ve got an older brother, so I know how people say things. I think if you asked President Trump today, he would say that was quite an exaggeration.”\n\nDid you cry?\n\n“No. God no. I resigned. I wasn’t fired. I resigned.”\n\nBannon argues that he has always been a loyalist. He points out that after January 6, 2021, most people peeled away, assuming that the Trump era had come to an end, but Bannon never did: “I had a lot of people call me, say, ‘It’s over, and you’re a smart guy, and you can help drive this into a positive way.’ I said, ‘That’s not a positive way. You’re just surrendering. I’m never going to stop. You scratch me and you just get a hardheaded mick.’ ” (Bannon often refers to his Irish family heritage in this way, usually in the context of resilience, hotheadedness, and stubbornness.) “ ‘It’s just the way I’m built. And we’re not going to stop. And I can see, if we hold, that Trump’s going to return to the White House.’ People fucking laughed at my face.”\n\nTwo and a half years later, with Trump the presumptive Republican nominee, that laughter has subsided. And as for his actual relationship with Trump now, Bannon says this: “I don’t want to talk about the specific conversations, but we speak pretty frequently, yeah. . . . It’s normally about what’s happening on the show and the clips and the poll numbers and what’s happening at the rallies.”\n\nGiven those words, and also bearing in mind the impression of personal intimacy with Trump I’ve heard Bannon convey to his War Room audience, what I will now relate might be taken as evidence of just how strange and unconventional the deep bond running between Trump and Bannon is. Though it could also, if you are so minded, be used to question its nature, or even its very existence.\n\nOn April 28, 2023, Bannon filmed a live episode of War Room from the library of Mar-a-Lago, a special to promote the vainglorious new coffee-table book Letters to Trump. The broadcast began with Bannon speaking with the book’s publisher, Sergio Gor. About fifteen minutes in, well ahead of the agreed schedule, Trump appeared off camera and greeted Bannon. “He starts smiling: ‘My Steve!’ ” Bannon recounts. The show cut to an ad break, and when it returned, Trump was in the interviewee seat, answering Bannon’s questions.\n\nAll very unremarkable, you might think, except for one astonishing aspect: By Bannon’s own account, this moment was the first time he and Trump had met in the flesh since Bannon left the White House in August 2017, almost six years earlier.\n\nBannon fills me in on how things proceeded that day. How afterward Trump invited him to stay for dinner, and though at first Bannon demurred, Trump insisted. And how they were then joined by Melania. Bannon describes the ensuing reintroductions: “He goes, ‘Steve . . . Melania.’ I go, ‘First Lady, so great to see you again. Haven’t seen you in a long time.’ She goes, ‘I always liked you, Steve.’ And I go, ‘I know, Melania, you and I, we hate the same people.’ And she laughed. A very knowing laughter.”\n\nI ask Bannon whether he wants to give me a list, assuming he’ll sidestep, but he doesn’t entirely.\n\n“Listen,” he says, “it’s no doubt we had some hard feelings with Jared and Ivanka and others. . . .”\n\nAt dinner, he says, they all talked, and sitting there at the table, Trump DJed from his iPad.\n\n“He knows Melania hates it when he’s DJing,” Bannon notes.\n\nThere has since been a second meeting between Bannon and Trump, on July 19, before a screening of the movie The Sound of Freedom at Trump’s golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey. Bannon says that he spoke with Trump for about twenty minutes beforehand and also had a long conversion with Jared Kushner, one he presents as a rapprochement.\n\nOne day, we go on an outing. The many twists of Steve Bannon’s early career have been well-documented but are nonetheless littered with curiosities, and the site of one of these lies a half hour or so north of where we are. Biosphere 2 was completed in 1991, a self-contained, domed system of different environments in which a group of people would be enclosed for extended periods of time and studied as they tried to subsist. At the time, what seemed like a weird futuristic experiment was an object of intense media coverage and some controversy, and in 1993 an investment banker was brought in to rationalize parts of the operation. This was Steve Bannon, who ended up running the project for about two years, along with a team including his younger brother Chris.\n\nChris is still involved, and today the three of us are heading up there. Steve has lost his glasses, so Chris drives. In the front, they talk about sharing a bedroom in their home in Richmond when they were young and reminisce about the local band they loved to see all the time, Steel Mill—“played at my high school, at the prom,” says Bannon. Steel Mill being Bruce Springsteen’s band before he had a recording contract. (This tracks. In his autobiography, Born to Run, Springsteen describes how Richmond became Steel Mill’s second home, where they built up a following and even “got hired for school events.” It was, Springsteen wrote, “one of the two places where we could make a buck.”) And then Bannon’s off, talking about seeing the Dead in ’73 and New Riders of the Purple Sage. On the Biosphere 2 property, before Chris Bannon gives me a tour (the Biosphere itself, part research site, part tourist attraction, is now run by the University of Arizona), we first go to the ranch house where Steve Bannon lived for two years in the 1990s—without, as he notes, air conditioning—and continue our conversations. I’ve told Bannon I want to talk to him about Michael Wolff’s books. Over a series of publications—2018’s Fire and Fury, 2019’s Siege, 2021’s Too Famous (and, to a lesser degree, 2021’s Landslide)—Wolff could be seen as the great chronicler of Steve Bannon, though perhaps not always of the man Bannon would now wish people to see.\n\nThe discussion gets puzzling right from the start. When I ask Bannon when he first met Wolff, his response is “After I left the White House? I don’t remember.” When I press that Wolff was clearly around him before that, Bannon offers a second, very specific date—that it was when Wolff and Kellyanne Conway did an onstage interview about the first hundred days of the Trump administration, which was on April 12, 2017. This perplexes me, but for now I decide not to challenge him further on it. Likewise, when I read Bannon a summary Wolff has written of their interactions—“We logged hundreds of hours of conversation together in Trump Tower, the White House, the frat-style accommodations he occupied on Capitol Hill, the luxury suites he favored when he was in New York, during a trip to Europe we took together, and over dinners at my house in Greenwich Village”—Bannon says, “Ridiculous,” adding, “I have ex-wives I haven’t spent hundreds of hours with.” (Bannon has been married three times—his eldest daughter, Maureen, works mostly behind the scenes at War Room—but says that these days he has no ongoing romantic relationship. “I’ve directed my chakras in a different direction,” he says. “I’ll be seventy shortly. I got a window here to have an impact.” In this regard, he mentions something that I can’t get out of my head. He tells me that even years ago, when he’d interview people for his own firm, his second or third question would be about their personal life. He says that it didn’t matter what they actually said: If they spoke for more than sixty seconds in response, they wouldn’t be hired.)\n\nAs Bannon tells me that he has read none of Wolff’s books, I quote to him some relevant passages. I do so less in the expectation that the 2023 version of Bannon is likely to reaffirm the opinions that Wolff reports he once had and shared, more in trying to understand how his present role and his relationship with Trump may—or may not—transcend this material. For instance, there’s this passage from Siege: “But Bannon also believed that if you could get around Trump’s repellent character, intellectual deficiencies, and glaring mental health issues, you ought to be able to see that Trump was being savaged—with the powers that be trying to run him out of office—for doing much of what he had been elected to do. Trumpism, in fact, was working.”\n\n“I haven’t heard these,” Bannon responds, “and I think the reason that you haven’t heard these is that people realize it’s nonsense. It’s just Wolff trying to sell books. Is anybody out there in the media right now, anybody out there in the Republican staff, anybody out there, either lovers of Trump or haters of Trump, that don’t understand that I am Trump’s closest ally?”\n\nJared Siskin // Getty Images Author Michael Wolff has written extensively about Trump. When Bannon appeared to be a key source in Wolff’s 2018 book Fire and Fury, about the early days of the Trump presidency, Trump took to calling his former advisor “Sloppy Steve Bannon.”\n\nAt one point, as I read him a series of further examples of how Bannon was said to have, as Wolff summarized in 2021, “conducted a riotously entertaining monologue about Trump and his family’s stupidity, avarice, incompetence, and corruption,” Bannon protests that if all this were true, “Why would Trump and I be this close today?” Which is, indeed, in all kinds of ways, the question.\n\nThe most explicitly damning material comes from the later books, but it was Fire and Fury that drew Trump’s “Sloppy Steve” pushback and so whose contents Trump presumably has some knowledge of. One passage—which I also read back to Bannon—strikes me as particularly relevant, again not so much for what it says about Trump’s capabilities (a debate that has its own life out in the world) but for how Trump might feel about someone who has questioned them like this: “Steve Bannon was telling people he thought there was a 33.3 percent chance that the Mueller investigation would lead to the impeachment of the president, a 33.3 percent chance that Trump would resign, perhaps in the wake of a threat by the cabinet to act on the Twenty-fifth Amendment (by which the cabinet can remove the president in the event of his incapacitation), and a 33.3 percent chance that he would limp to the end of his term. In any event, there would certainly not be a second term, or even an attempt at one. ‘He’s not going to make it,’ said Bannon at the Breitbart Embassy. ‘He’s lost his stuff.’ ”\n\n\n\n“No,” Bannon tells me. “I don’t remember saying that.”\n\nI mention other sources I’ve come across that seem to echo, and attribute to Bannon, something of the same idea. One is a quote I read in an interview with the 60 Minutes producer Ira Rosen, promoting a book he had written, referring to how Bannon had told him about Trump showing signs of early-stage dementia and raising the genuine possibility that because of this, Trump might be removed from office by the Twenty-fifth Amendment.\n\n“Nonsense,” says Bannon when I relay what Rosen said. “Total nonsense. And I’ve never talked to Rosen, ever, except for the 60 Minutes interview, ever.” Bannon further argues that for that 60 Minutes interview, he had agreed to answer questions on anything—if he had said this to the show’s producer, why didn’t they ask about it in the interview? “No, I certainly never had that opinion. I don’t ever remember expressing it. President Trump—look how sharp he is today. I don’t remember anybody ever questioning his ability to perform the office.”\n\nI ask him how he feels, if so, about a story like this being out there.\n\n“It’s irrelevant. Nobody talks about it. Trump knows it’s bullshit. I didn’t even know he’d written a book. Have you heard anybody talk about that? Listen, I sell books—just the mention of Bannon and you can make whatever. . . . This is why, if I had to chase down every . . . remember, I’m an anti-Semite, I’m a white nationalist . . .”\n\nAnd, for now, we talk of other things.\n\nWhatever Bannon did or didn’t once say about him, his proximity to Trump and his ideas has certainly had marked legal consequences. Bannon was somewhere in the orbit of the events of January 6, 2021. He was part of strategic Washington hotel discussions in the days before and spoke to Trump both in the morning and evening of January 6, but beyond that he has refused to clarify much further. Whether out of abstract principle or contrariness or because he had secrets he didn’t want to tell, Bannon refused to comply with a subpoena to testify before the select committee investigating January 6. He was subsequently charged with contempt of Congress, found guilty, and sentenced to four months in prison, a verdict he is appealing.\n\nBrandon Bell Bannon at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in 2022. He routinely fosters the notion among his followers that he is close with former president Trump.\n\nThat is not the only legal peril he has been facing. In August 2020, Bannon was one of four men accused of diverting funds from a nonprofit, We Build the Wall, established to raise money for the private construction of barriers on the U. S.–Mexico border. If Bannon expected support from a president neck-deep in reelection maneuverings, none was forthcoming. “I didn’t like that project,” said Trump when the news of Bannon’s arrest broke. “I thought that was a project that was being done for showboating reasons.” (Bannon blames others for this: “That’s what Jared had told him. . . . Knowing the facts as he knows them now, he’s, I think, very supportive.”) Bannon’s three codefendants are now in jail. And Bannon? On Trump’s final day in office, he was pardoned.\n\nI ask Bannon how he got the pardon.\n\n“I have no idea,” he avers. “It was just him.”\n\nYou must have advocated for it.\n\n“No, never.”\n\nReally?\n\n“No. Never advocated.” Bannon adds that he believes Rudy Giuliani may have brought it up “of his own volition.”\n\nBut you must have been pleased for it to happen?\n\n“Sure. Definitely. There’s no doubt about that. I think that’s President Trump. I think he can think these things through.”\n\nWhy do you think he did it?\n\n“I think he did it because he knows I’m an honest guy.”\n\nNot that the whole affair is behind him. In September 2022, Bannon was indicted on state charges, which are unaffected by a presidential pardon, related to the same events. He claims to be unworried. “I have no doubt I’ll be exonerated at trial,” he says. “I never took one penny from this.” Likewise, when it comes to the four-month sentence he already faces, he professes to be “100 percent confident” that he will never serve any time. He talks about all these legal matters as though they’re just bothersome, minor paperwork errors that will be corrected in due course. It’s hard to determine how much of this is smart strategic thinking and clearheaded analysis, how much is unanchored self-belief, and how much is pure bluff.\n\n\n\nThose things Bannon told me in Arizona, when pushing back against people who had reported comments he had made in earlier times about Trump . . . afterward, I can’t figure them out. Did he think I wouldn’t check further? Had he really reshaped the past in his memory to better fit the present? Does he genuinely think none of it really matters? Or did he just think that handling these questions as he did was the best tactic, however strong or weak his hand?\n\nEither way, much of what he said that was checkable seems to have been wildly far from the truth. First, Michael Wolff. Bannon had eventually indicated to me that his initial contact with Wolff came in April 2017, in the first hundred days of the Trump presidency. Many of the details contradicting this are in Wolff’s books, and I also spoke with Wolff to clarify things further. Wolff describes first encountering Bannon at the Orlando airport in early 2016, when it was Bannon, who was still running Breitbart News, who recognized and approached Wolff. That summer, soon after Bannon took over the Trump campaign, he invited Wolff up to Trump Tower. “I probably saw him three or four times that fall,” Wolff says; they carried on speaking throughout his time in the White House. “I liked him,” says Wolff. “I mean, he was an enormous pleasure to spend time with. He could not have been more open, more accessible—a better source and better company.” When I tell Wolff that Bannon pushed back against the notion that they had logged hundreds of hours of conversation over the years, he says, “Well, it’s all on tape.” He confirms that he heard Bannon’s disparaging summary of Trump’s chances, and of Trump having lost his stuff, directly from Bannon. “Oh yeah, many times,” Wolff says. “I mean, possibly he’s convinced himself otherwise. I don’t know. As I say, I have not spoken to him in some amount of time, but he’s come to make his money off of a different point of view. He knows where his bread is buttered. He plays a role. I mean, in a sense, when I was with him he was just playing a different role. At the time, he was the apostate Trump, the clear-eyed person, and all of the other people were incredible sycophants.”\n\nThen there’s Ira Rosen, the 60 Minutes producer whom Bannon claimed to barely know, telling me he only ever spoke to him for the 60 Minutes interview. I get hold of a copy of Rosen’s book, Ticking Clock: Behind the Scenes at 60 Minutes. The story it tells is so at odds with what Bannon professed that it is staggering. Rosen explains how he first met Bannon when working on a 60 Minutes story about insider trading in Washington—this was back in 2011—and how Bannon subsequently became someone he would meet up with periodically when Bannon was in New York. Rosen would trawl for gossip about Fox’s Roger Ailes while Bannon “encouraged me to do stories about the Washington swamp.” Immediately after Bannon took over the Trump campaign, Rosen, too, was invited up to the campaign headquarters. In his book, Rosen details some of their interactions and conversations, noting in passing that he and Bannon have exchanged more than a thousand text messages.\n\n\n\nCamerique/ClassicStock In 1993 Bannon, then an investment banker, was hired to help run Biosphere 2, near Tucson, a domed system of man-made environments where humans can practice subsistence. His brother, Chris, is still involved.\n\nAs for what Rosen says that Bannon told him about Trump’s purported dementia? One very good reason this didn’t form part of the substance of Bannon’s 60 Minutes interview is that these exchanges took place in the weeks and months afterward. Here is what Rosen wrote: “His criticism of Trump privately to me took on a different tone. He believed Trump was suffering from early-stage dementia and that there was a real possibility he would be removed from office by the Twenty-fifth Amendment, where the cabinet could vote that the president was no longer mentally capable of carrying out his duties. Bannon began to push that story hard. Bannon said that the president had no attention span, didn’t read, and now doesn’t listen. He said Trump repeats himself a lot, telling the same story minutes after he told it before.” In the book, Rosen describes how he sent Bannon an extract from a David Brooks column in The New York Times recounting that a group of senators recently meeting with Trump had seen “a president so repetitive and rambling, some thought he might be suffering from early Alzheimer’s,” and that Bannon texted back, “You need to do the 25th amendment piece . . . BTW brother I never steer u wrong.” I call up Rosen, who reaffirms that all of this is documented.\n\nAfter I leave Arizona, Bannon texts me intermittently, but the tempo increases as the battle toward a possible government shutdown nears. “Next couple of weeks going to be crazy nasty,” he predicts. “Toxic and Lit.” Reading his texts and watching his shows, I find it difficult to determine how much he is reporting on events and how much he may be playing a role in orchestrating them. (He certainly often seems to know what is going to happen next well before it happens.)\n\nA couple days before the shutdown deadline at the end of September, I visit Bannon in Washington. He returned from Arizona earlier that week. The burned-up palm tree, he updates me, has been taken down—“It broke my heart,” he says—but he’s still resisting its replacement by a shorter tree. He wants one the same size. He chooses to offer the following troubling analogy: He was always adamant that they should have built back the World Trade Center towers exactly where they were but one foot taller. “I want my palm tree,” he says.\n\nWe are in the Breitbart Embassy, just a couple blocks from the Capitol. (Bannon has War Room studios in various homes, but this is the principal one.) As ever, he is personally affable in a way that offers an almost baffling contrast to so many of his words and opinions. It’d be convenient to assume that this is all a front, that he is working me, but while I certainly don’t discount that component, for the most part I think that’s too easy an explanation. Whoever Steve Bannon in messy aggregate actually is, I don’t think you can begin to understand him without acknowledging that this version—the often considerate, genial, self-deprecating, open-to-other-opinions one—is, maybe confoundingly, a real part of him, too.\n\nI expect today’s conversation to be awkward. After we spend maybe an hour scuffling back and forth on other matters, I move to the lengthy list of statements and disavowals he made in Arizona that don’t seem to tally with what I’ve since found. Regarding his interactions with Michael Wolff, Bannon initially reiterates that he first met Wolff when he was in the White House but when pressed now recalls an earlier encounter the previous fall when Wolff was writing an article for The Hollywood Reporter. But we reach an impasse over many of the opinions and words Wolff describes and quotes Bannon as saying. “You have to come to your own assessment,” Bannon eventually declares. “You’re the writer. This shouldn’t be a tough one you have to struggle with. Two people have very different opinions.”\n\nI know, but one of them has got the quotes and the documented record of it, and I find it very hard to get past that.\n\n“Then you’re going to have to write that that’s true and that I’m lying to you and I misled you. I don’t have a problem with that.”\n\nOkay.\n\n“This is not an existential moment.”\n\nIt feels to me that what he is saying here is something like this: People like you are hung up on the quaint idea that it’s truth that always matters the most. Sure, it has its uses, but in the big picture—and especially when things really heat up—it’s often way down any sensible list of priorities.\n\nWhen I move on to Ira Rosen and remind Bannon what he told me about only speaking to Rosen around the 60 Minutes interview, he immediately says, “Yes,” agreeing with himself. I explain that Rosen’s book gives a very different impression. “I don’t care what he says in his book,” Bannon retorts. I press on regardless.\n\nWould you agree that you were constantly texting each other?\n\n“I don’t remember that. So he’s got the text?”\n\nYeah. He says he has more than a thousand texts.\n\n“Are they in the book?”\n\nSome of them.\n\n“I don’t remember.”\n\nAre you saying they don’t exist?\n\n“I’m saying I don’t remember being in constant contact with Ira Rosen.”\n\nIt feels obvious to me that here and elsewhere Bannon is navigating a careful, evanescently thin line: repudiating what he can and then otherwise saying that he doesn’t remember, whether or not these are things someone could credibly fail to remember, rather than fully calling anyone a liar, with all the awkward new doors that might open.\n\nWhen I remind Bannon that Rosen’s name first came up, back in Arizona, when I read him Rosen’s quote about the Twenty-fifth Amendment, Bannon protests with renewed confidence as he did before—grounds for repudiation!—that if this were true it would have been asked about in the 60 Minutes interview. When I point out that this all took place after that, Bannon recalibrates his defense. “How did I have that then?” he says, as though he was suddenly so removed from Trump world that he would have had no means of judging anything like that about his former boss. “I didn’t speak to Trump for years,” he says. “That’s ridiculous.” (Aside from the fact that this contradicts both the general impression he has given me and others and his description to me of the call Trump made to him in Hong Kong after the 60 Minutes interview, Bannon is on more formal record stating otherwise. When he was interviewed by the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence investigating purported Trump ties to Russia, on January 16, 2018, he was asked how many times he had spoken with Trump since leaving the White House. At first he answered, “I don’t remember,” but when pressed, “Is it more than ten?” he replied, “Yes.”)\n\nI say that Rosen claims to have all of this documented and read to Bannon his own text about the Twenty-fifth Amendment.\n\n“Okay, well, then you’ll have to go with . . .” He pauses. “I don’t remember that. And I don’t remember having that relationship with Ira Rosen.”\n\nA couple minutes later, Bannon tries a different tack. “Haven’t you been in the same situation as those two guys? Have I told you anything untoward to the president? That’s a yes-or-no question.”\n\nI agree that he has not.\n\n“Okay, fine,” he says, as though a point has been proved.\n\nI suggest that the real takeaway is maybe that he used to share a lot of uncareful thoughts with people and that he’s learned not to do so.\n\nDrew Angerer Trump speaks by phone to Russian president Vladimir Putin from the Oval Office on January 28, 2017, accompanied by, from left, Chief of Staff Reince Priebus, Vice President Mike Pence, and Bannon, then the White House Chief Strategist.\n\n“Then you’re going to have to write it how you have to write it,” he says. “We just have a disagreement. I think I’ve been very straightforward. Did we put any restrictions on this at all? You’re going to write what you’re going to write. You will lay out your case about Steve Bannon the way you see it. It’s your perspective. I have no problem with that. I’m not sitting here trying to talk you out of it: ‘Oh, please don’t . . .’ You just got to do what you got to do. Can I say something else? It’s also—it’s meaningless. But you ought to write it as you see it.”\n\nI ask him to explain what he means by “it’s meaningless.”\n\n“Because everybody knows that my loyalty to this movement and to him are unquestioned. If you look at the demonstrable record, there’s not even a question of who’s gone out of their way to support Trump the man and Trump the politician and the Trump movement. That’s just irrefutable fact. A couple of guys saying, ‘Hey, he said this, he said this’? That’s fine. I disagree with that. I don’t remember it. I don’t remember having long relationships with Michael Wolff or with particularly Ira Rosen. But I feel quite comfortable with my place in history, juxtaposed to what I’ve accomplished and what we’re accomplishing here. I feel pretty damn good.”\n\nHe says this as though it should, or even could, prove that the other stuff—the leaking and the careless trash-talking—is not true. (Bannon likes to use false binaries as a rhetorical device.) But of course they can both be true, and I suspect that they probably both broadly are. I try to return to the main reason, weeks ago, that I was asking about any of this—its effect, or otherwise, on his relationship with Trump. I begin by saying that although perhaps Trump is not aware chapter and verse of all this stuff that’s been published—at which point Bannon interrupts.\n\n“Oh, he knows it,” says Bannon. “Trust me. Anything has been published, they have put under his nose many times.”\n\nWe talk about different ways someone like Trump might view all this, and I float the possibility that Trump might allow someone like Bannon back in but that one’s card is nonetheless marked permanently, and one would never really be trusted. Bannon surprises me by allowing this possibility.\n\n“It may be,” he says. “It may be. Time will tell on that.”\n\nBoth in Arizona and in Washington, Bannon seemed keen that I should speak with Trump. Esquire sent the former president a series of questions about his and Bannon’s relationship but received no response.\n\nBy now I’ve spent a couple months watching War Room every day. I don’t agree with much, and I sometimes worry that I’m getting desensitized to thoughts that in clear fresh air would horrify me, but there are parts that I can just about see as fair’s-fair strong partisan advocacy. When it comes to issues like immigration and the war in Ukraine and the debt ceiling, while one might strongly dispute much of what is presented as fact, and the conclusions reached, these are nonetheless real, difficult quandaries where there exist good reasons for sensible, thoughtful people to disagree. Sometimes, though—a lot of the vaccine stuff, for instance—it just seems to me like crazy conspiratorial nonsense. Likewise the way in which disasters of almost any kind—the fire in Maui, the war in Israel, for instance—are opportunistically grabbed, with what seems to me as sickening glee, as notional proof of tendentious, and again often conspiratorial, government malfeasance. And every now and again what is broadcast seems just so nasty and vengeful and wrongheaded that I feel soiled just watching. As an example, there’s a recurrent subtext, dog-whistled but perfectly transparent, often when child trafficking is being discussed, that intimates in true QAnon style that some broad coalition of the Democratic and Hollywood establishment consists of pedophiles. Both what is being said and the manipulative if-you’re-smart-and-paying- attention-you’ll-know wink are repellent.\n\nAs accustomed as I become to all this, sometimes my reactions take me by surprise. One Wednesday in mid-September, Bannon launches into a sustained invective against Merrick Garland that, somehow, seems to step so far, heedlessly and recklessly, over any line. It’s the words themselves—“he is a purely evil individual . . . and he will pay for the evilness when we imprison him”—but also how insensibly and self-righteously angry Bannon seems. It makes good enough sense for Bannon, from his perspective, to disagree with Garland, and also to question whether Garland’s every decision is made in good faith. And I certainly doubt that Garland is without his flaws. But this attack just seems both wildly poisonous and, in its scale and certainty, empirically wrong. As Bannon himself says, history reveals. I suppose history could endorse Bannon’s view, but all my instincts are that there is no sensible reason for thinking this to be true, wherever you stand politically—and that to proclaim this, never mind potentially inspire people to act on its basis, goes unacceptably beyond fighting one’s corner.\n\nAt one point during our conversation in Washington, Bannon challenges me. “Do you think I believe this?” he asks, meaning what he advocates sitting here in the War Room studio. I explain, quite honestly, that I have thought about this question a lot. And then I tell him how shocked I was by the Merrick Garland diatribe.\n\n“I think Merrick Garland is evil. I shocked you?”\n\nYes, it really shocks me. Not only do I think you’re wrong; I think it’s disgusting that you think that.\n\n“Okay. Okay.”\n\nI can’t believe that there’s anything that you know that gives you the prerogative to think that.\n\n“Why do you say that? All the facts are out there of what he’s done. Look, he’s overseen rolling up of a thousand of these people. This one guy we talked about yesterday is three years hadn’t gone to trial. That’s pure evil of what he’s done about the J Six thing. Pure evil.”\n\nThat’s not evil. The whole thing was a complete shit show, and the rule of law is slowly working its way through it.\n\n“It’s not the rule of law. Upgrading to terrorism charges?”\n\nThere’s plenty to argue about there. I think Garland is trying to do his job. Evil? I don’t agree at all.\n\nChip Somodevilla Florida Republican Matt Gaetz (second from left, next to Tennessee Republican Tim Burchett), speaks to reporters in October 2023 during maneuverings over the House speakership. Gaetz, who made efforts to win concessions for MAGA Republicans, was a frequent guest on Bannon’s show during the chaotic run-up to a potential government shutdown.\n\n“This is the unbridgeable gap in the country. They think we’re evil. I saw last night! They think we’re building the Confederate army. That’s on MSNBC. That’s their belief. We’re building the Confederate army. They think we are pure evil. They think we’re racist. They think we’re domestic terrorists. They think we’re insurgents. This is what they think. And we think they’re evil. And you’re not going to bridge that gap.”\n\nBut that’s a tragedy.\n\n“Why is it a tragedy?”\n\nBecause in those terms, I think that you’re both wrong. (That is to say, insomuch as Bannon’s extreme characterization of the “other” side is accurate.)\n\n“Okay. You’re a reasonable man in the middle. You can weigh in measuring—you’re a kindhearted person, you think both sides are wrong. It’s like Ecclesiastes. It’s just not your time. I hate to say it: It’s just not your time. It’s us versus them. They hate us and we hate them. One side’s going to win here. And it’s going to get ugly. It’s going to get messy.”\n\nIn the days around and after my Washington trip, Bannon becomes far more visibly at the center of things.\n\n\n\nEven so, the looming end-of-September shutdown at first seems to play like something of a humiliation for him. His preference seemed to be for a disorderly shutdown, or at the very least for there to be major concessions to the MAGA wing. His show has been filled with those like Matt Gaetz maneuvering for this, and Bannon appears to be deeply involved in the strategizing. Then, on the final afternoon, Speaker of the House Kevin McCarthy makes a last-minute deal with the Democrats. The tempo of Bannon’s texts had been increasing, but after that, contact dries up and I assume that he is smarting. Gaetz has consistently said, and Bannon has echoed loudly, that if McCarthy did anything like this, Gaetz would move for McCarthy’s removal. Now Gaetz must either back down and look weak or press ahead, but the conventional wisdom is that his bluff has been called and he will be put in his place. Either hardcore MAGA Republicans will blanch at taking this final step or the Democrats will passively or actively move to allow McCarthy’s survival; Gaetz will be isolated as an extremist renegade.\n\nI’m traveling, so I don’t learn the result of the vote at the time. Not for another six minutes, anyway, when my phone pings with a two-word text from Bannon: “Told Ya.” McCarthy has gone, Congress is in turmoil, and things have played out Bannon’s way. By the end of the week, Bannon is back on the front cover of The New York Times, photographed in mid-broadcast, jabbing the index finger of his left hand to drive home a point.\n\nStill, after that, it zigs and zags back and forth. Candidates opposed by Bannon, candidates supported by him, crash and burn all the same. After two weeks of this, I text him, asking what way he sees out of this chaos. Or, I add, is the chaos okay?\n\nHis answer comes back immediately.\n\n“Chaos,” he writes, “is our friend.”\n\nThis, of course, is just a skirmish. Just a minor messiness. When the MAGA–friendly Mike Johnson eventually prevails as Speaker, I get a sense that for Bannon this is less a major victory than a fruitful bit of low-level agitation. The real mess, the real chaos, the real if-you-tear-it-down-they-will-come rupture . . . if Steve Bannon has his way, and he seems hell-bent on doing so, that is still to come.",

        "source": "https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/",
        "content": "Happy Mardi Gras! Laissez les bon temps rouler and all dat, cher. As the floats roll down St. Charles and the beads fly high over Claiborne and Jackson, spare a moment to consider the other Louisiana, the poisoned place where so many people live and where all the garish colors of parade season can be found in the water, and the earth, and the ground beneath your feet. And for the people who live there, Cancer Alley is as much a state of mind as it is a specific geographic area. And they are all being abandoned again to the tender mercies of a “business-friendly economy.” From The Washington Post:\n\nThe Justice Department is poised to drop a landmark lawsuit alleging that cancer-causing pollution from a Louisiana petrochemical plant poses an imminent danger to nearby communities, according to two individuals briefed on the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the decision is not yet final. The lawsuit alleges that the Denka Performance Elastomer plant in LaPlace, Louisiana, threatens local residents by releasing unsafe levels of the toxic chemical chloroprene. The Environmental Protection Agency considers chloroprene—which is used to make synthetic rubber—a likely carcinogen, and the suit sought to compel the plant to curb these emissions.\n\nTrump officials’ decision to abandon the case, which was first reported by the New York Times, has prompted alarm from environmental and public health advocates. They warn that the plant’s continued operations could harm the health of thousands of residents, including hundreds of young children who are especially vulnerable to carcinogens. The move is expected to draw praise, however, from top Louisiana officials including Gov. Jeff Landry (R). They have argued that the facility provides significant economic benefits to the state and the region, and that the pollution concerns are overblown.\n\nChloroprene is a particularly vicious chemical, linked to serious cases of liver and lung cancer. The people in LaPlace, deep in the heart of the ecological dead zone of Cancer Alley, had hung a lot of their hope for a slightly healthier place to live on the lawsuit that had been filed by the previous administration’s EPA. From The New York Times:\n\nThe lawsuit had given the neighboring community a measure of hope that pollution levels might finally come down, said Robert Taylor, a founder of Concerned Citizens of St John Parish, a community group. “The fact that they may drop this is very hard for us,” said Mr. Taylor, who has been fighting pollution from the plant for more than a decade. “We need to regroup and revitalize ourselves and get ready for a very difficult struggle.”\n\nIn announcing the lawsuit, the E.P.A. said that it had found that children under 18 accounted for about 20 percent of the population living within two and a half miles of the Denka plant. More than 300 children who attended an elementary school located less than 500 feet from the Denka facility had been exposed to chloroprene emissions, the agency said.\n\n(Last September, there was a major leak of chloroprene from the facility, which made Landry’s attack on the Biden administration’s efforts to bring Denka to heel sound even more idiotic. In February, Landry got the current administration to refuse to designate an 11-mile area of the River Parishes to be a historic district, which would have curtailed further industrialization in the area. Not to worry, however. Landry and the brainiacs in the Louisiana legislature are fighting to make sure that the Ten Commandments are hung in all the classrooms of that school, so it’s all good. And, as we know, elections have consequences.)\n\nThe Biden administration made environmental justice—the idea that all communities should be protected from environmental harms—a priority. Michael S. Regan, the second Black person to serve as E.P.A. administrator, took a “journey to justice” tour in 2021 to low-income communities in Mississippi, Louisiana, and Texas as part of a push to increase monitoring and enforcement of federal rules regarding air and water quality. He promised “strong action,” later buoyed by $60 billion provided by the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act for environmental justice programs.\n\nThe Trump administration is now eliminating government programs aimed at environmental justice, and, last month, the E.P.A. placed 168 employees who work on the issue on administrative leave.\n\nThe bon temps are rolling mighty slow these days.",

        "source": "https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/",
        "content": "By a 5–4 decision, the Supreme Court on Wednesday upheld a lower court ruling that would force the president to release $2 billion in previously appropriated USAID money. This, of course, was a ruling that confounds the basic business plan that has guided the president through his entire career—namely, stiff your creditors and dare them to sue. It turns out that the agencies of the government may be more formidable opponents than the gardeners and glaziers of New Jersey. From The Washington Post:\n\nChief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. and Justice Amy Coney Barrett joined the court’s three liberal justices in the 5-4 order, which was the high court’s first significant move on lawsuits related to President Donald Trump’s initiatives in his second term. … As is customary in emergency orders, the majority did not explain the reasoning for its decision. It directed the lower court to clarify what obligations the government must fulfill to global health groups, with consideration of the “feasibility of any compliance timelines.” Soon after the ruling, U.S. district Judge Amir H. Ali ordered the government to develop a timeline to restart the payments.\n\nThe primary dissenter was Justice Sam Alito, who seems to be a bit confused about how this whole judicial system is supposed to work:\n\nDoes a single district-court judge who likely lacks jurisdiction have the unchecked power to compel the Government of the United States to pay out (and probably lose forever) 2 billion taxpayer dollars? The answer to that question should be an emphatic ‘No,’ but a majority of this Court apparently thinks otherwise. I am stunned.\n\nThat parenthetical is a bit of typical Alito snottery. The money in question represents payment for work that already has been done. Alito’s assertion that the money is something “probably lost” is a barely camouflaged assertion that the money somehow was not earned by the people doing USAID work around the world. This is money that literally will save lives around the world. Alito’s petulance is not only tasteless, but also, in the most profound way, it is inhumane.\n\nI wish the majority had issued a formal argument for why it ruled the way that it did. Not having done so leaves the Alito dissent as the only formal stated argument for the record—an odd position for the argument that did, after all, lose. But once again, justices Barrett and Roberts seem to be gingerly stepping around the crude Trumpist version of the unitary executive theory. I have no idea of the depth of Roberts’s tortured judicial conscience, but Justice Barrett seems to be finding her feet as a kind of wild-ish card in the deck. You find the sunshine where you can.",

        "content": "I paid no attention to the appearance before Congress of a vulgar-talking yam, because I have tired completely of the threadbare lies and the inevitably unhinged rant. Here’s one example of the kind of line I cannot stomach:\n\nI believe that my life was saved that day in Butler for a very good reason. I was saved by God to make America great again. I believe that.\n\nYeah, no time for that blasphemous swill. Not from the most thoroughgoing heathen ever to hold high public office in this country. No time, either, for triumphal pronouncements about freeing us all from “unelected bureaucrats” shortly after praising Elon Musk’s idiotic clear-cutting of the executive agencies. Not only did I not vote for Elon Musk, but he doesn’t believe anyone should get to vote for anyone ever. Don’t waste my time with this bullshit. I feel the need for a decontamination shower just reading the transcript.\n\nI was more interested in the official Democratic response from Senator Elissa Slotkin just to see how appalled the Democratic legislative elite would answer the genuine threat that hides behind the lies and the delusions of competence.\n\nThe answer ... eh?\n\nYou can find that same sense of patriotism here in Wyandotte, Michigan, where I am tonight. It’s a working-class town just south of Detroit. President Trump and I both won here in November. It might not seem like it, but plenty of places like this still exist all across the United States—places where people believe that if you work hard, and play by the rules, you should do well and your kids do better. It reminds me of how I grew up. My dad was a lifelong Republican, my mom a lifelong Democrat. But it was never a big deal. Because we had shared values that were bigger than any one party.\n\nOh, my dear God in heaven, it is not 1992 any more. The American republic is in genuine peril. Democracy is hanging over the abyss on a very thin thread. And if that thread gives out, a lot of people everywhere, including Wyandotte, are going to feel the impact very deeply.\n\nPresident Trump loves to promise “peace through strength.” That’s actually a line he stole from Ronald Reagan. But let me tell you, after the spectacle that just took place in the Oval Office last week, Reagan must be rolling over in his grave. We all want an end to the war in Ukraine, but Reagan understood that true strength required America to combine our military and economic might with moral clarity. And that scene in the Oval Office wasn’t just a bad episode of reality TV. It summed up Trump’s whole approach to the world. He believes in cozying up to dictators like Vladimir Putin and kicking our friends, like Canada, in the teeth. He sees American leadership as merely a series of real estate transactions. As a Cold War kid, I’m thankful it was Reagan and not Trump in office in the 1980s. Trump would have lost us the Cold War.\n\nJust shoot me now. I never have been thankful for Ronald Reagan in any goddamn context whatsoever. In fact, just yesterday, one of the guys who really won the Cold War, Lech Wałęsa, formerly of the Gdansk Shipyard, and several of his fellow freedom fighters wrote to El Caudillo del Mar-a-Lago reprimanding him for his betrayal of Ukraine and for being subservient to Vladimir Putin.\n\nWe were also terrified by the fact that the atmosphere in the Oval Office during this conversation reminded us of the one we remember well from interrogations by the Security Service and from the courtrooms in communist courts.\n\nBut Elissa Slotkin summons up Ronald Reagan. It’s not 1982 anymore, either.\n\nThere followed banal encomiums to American greatness and to citizen involvement, as well as the standard rhetorical wha-dee-doo-dah that has been rendered obsolete in the face of the bonfire into which this administration is feeding everything that truly is great about the country. I’m sure Elissa Slotkin is completely sincere, and I do hope she gets reelected to the Senate every time she runs again. But as for responses to what the president said on Tuesday night, give me Rep. Al Green, the Democrat Congressman from Texas who stood and shook his cane at Trump until House Speaker Mike Johnson ordered the sergeant at arms to remove him. After all, I believe that every citizen deserves to give exactly the same amount of respect to this president as he gives to the office he holds and to the oath he took just over a month ago. Which is to say, not a damn bit.",

        "content": "The Secretary of Health and Human Services, a noted roadside taxidermist, gave an interview to Fox News on the subject of the current measles outbreak in West Texas and New Mexico. His explanations were ... unconventional. From :\n\nHe issued a muffled call for vaccinations in the affected community, but said the choice was a personal one. He suggested that measles vaccine injuries were more common than known, contrary to extensive research. He asserted that natural immunity to measles, gained through infection, somehow also protected against cancer and heart disease, a claim not supported by research. He cheered on questionable treatments like cod liver oil, and said that local doctors had achieved “almost miraculous and instantaneous” recoveries with steroids or antibiotics.\n\nCod-liver oil? Is this guy possessed by the restless spirit of my grandmother? Why not Father John’s Medicine? Or Carter’s Little Liver Pills? Or even one of those old cough remedies that advertised the benefits of heroin. Wait, forget I said that.\n\nIn the interview, Mr. Kennedy appeared frustrated that a vaccine-preventable illness rather than chronic disease had drawn national attention during his first weeks as secretary. “We’ve had two measles deaths in 20 years in this country—we have 100,000 autism diagnoses every year,” he said. “We need to keep our eye on the ball. Chronic disease is our enemy.” The suggestion that vaccines cause autism has been discredited by dozens of scientific studies.\n\n\n\nAsked whether he opposed so-called measles parties—events that parents hold to purposely spread measles from a sick child to healthy children—Mr. Kennedy said he would “never advise someone to get sick.” But he also praised the benefits of natural immunity, protection gained after becoming infected with a virus, claiming that it lasted longer than vaccine-induced immunity and may later protect against cancers and cardiac disease.\n\nThe secretary suggested that we all consult “frontline doctors,” who, he said, were getting great results from various unconventional nostrums “on the ground.” On the ground in Gaines County, Texas, epicenter of the outbreak, however, the frontline doctors seem to be asking him not to help quite so much.\n\nMr. Kennedy’s focus on unverified treatments has frustrated some doctors in Gaines County, who have been trying to explain to patients that there is no antiviral for measles and that they have little control over which patients suffer serious symptoms. “We already are dealing with people that think measles is not a big deal,” said Dr. Leila Myrick, a family medicine doctor in Seminole, Texas, who has been caring for patients with measles for several weeks. “Now they’re going to think they can get this miracle treatment and that they definitely don’t need to get vaccinated. It’s 100 percent going to make it harder.”\n\nAnd, in the Beyond, Hippocrates gets out of the business.",

        "source": "https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/",
        "content": "There are other courthouses in other places. They’re not in Washington. They’re the repair shops of the law. They hammer out the dents that result from the collisions of ordinary people living ordinary lives. And they’re where the law comes closest to Atticus Finch’s optimism. They’re where the leveling happens. —Something I Wrote Once\n\n\n\nLong ago, I learned a valuable lesson about verdicts in criminal cases. The lesson conforms to the late William Goldman’s classic assessment of Hollywood: Nobody Knows Anything. This is especially true in that tremulous time between when the case goes to the jury and when the jury comes back with a verdict. Once, while covering a political-corruption case at The Boston Phoenix, we killed that time in the best possible way. Somebody got up a poker game in the press room. (Heavens to Hildy Johnson!) At one point, a court officer poked his head in to remind us that gambling in a federal courthouse was, you know, non-legal. “Yeah, right,” we replied. “I’ll raise you a quarter.”\n\nRelated Story The Truth About Trump That Only the Courts See\n\nThe chatter over the nickels and dimes was all about what the extended deliberations “meant.” This is the oldest sucker’s bet in journalism. Nobody can tell what twelve individual minds can divine from the evidence presented, let alone how they can come to agree unanimously on what that evidence proves one way or another. Nobody knows anything, and only a fool would bet on it. (Brief Historical Note: The jury in that trial came back quickly, and the defendant was acquitted. I came away half a buck ahead.)\n\nWhen the jury—and, therefore, the System—brought down the ten-pound hammer on the former president* Thursday afternoon, it also shattered much of the instant, freeze-dried speculation. There was no acquittal. There was no hung jury. There was no “mixed verdict.” There were thirty-four felony counts and there were thirty-four guilty verdicts, and it took the jury less than a day to bring that gravid judgment back. I would never call their job easy. There were death threats in the air throughout the trial. There were thick clouds of squid ink billowing from the defense table. And the defendant was formerly the president* of the United States. But when the jury left the courtroom and went in back to deliberate, all extraneous ballyhoo evidently fell away and all the crooked places were made straight. Left alone with the evidence and their own common sense, the members of the jury brought strength and clarity to the proceedings, to themselves, and, one hopes fervently, to the country as well.\n\nThe Executive was crooked. The national legislature was inert. And the independent judiciary, at its most common level, stepped up and did its job. This is how that whole “separation of powers” thing was designed to work. Now we can only hope that a good New York jury and a brave New York judge have shamed the Supreme Court into tossing the spurious “executive immunity” claim onto the ash heap where it belongs and that, down in Florida, Judge Aileen (Slow Loris) Cannon will take a lesson from Juan Merchan on what being a judge is supposed to be about.\n\nDonald Trump is a convicted felon. Stormy Daniels is an American hero. And a little porn star shall lead them.\n\nCase closed, motherf*ckers.\n\nRelive the Magic: More Charlie on Trump’s Hush-Money Trial",

        "source": "https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/",
        "content": "What are the latest Deep Thoughts from MAGAland? Let’s take a look.\n\nHere’s Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins on Fox News endorsing a unique strategy to cope with the rising cost of eggs.\n\n“I think the silver lining in all of this is, how do we, in our backyards—we’ve got chickens too in our backyard—how do we solve for something like this? And people are sort of looking around thinking, ‘Wow, well maybe I could get a chicken in my backyard,’ and it’s awesome.”\n\nRemember the Nevada Senate primary, when GOP favorite Sue Lowden suggested that people pay for their medical care with chickens, like the frontier farmer doctors used to do? (Admit it. You do remember it, ya bastids.) Turns out she was ahead of her time. We could have an entire economy conducted with a poultry-based currency by now. Still a better idea than tariffs.\n\nAlso, too: bird flu!\n\nThen we move along to the latest from Alina Habba, the famous parking-garage attorney. From NBC News:\n\nSpeaking to reporters on the White House lawn, Habba was asked about fired workers whom Democrats have invited to President Donald Trump’s joint address to Congress on Tuesday night. Habba defended the cuts and said she had no sympathy for the thousands of people who have lost their jobs. “I really don’t feel sorry for them,” Habba said. “They should get back to work for the American people, like President Trump and this administration.”\n\nA reporter then noted that some military veterans have been part of that group.\n\n“That’s something the president has always cared about—anybody in blue, anybody that serves this country. But at the same time, we have taxpayer dollars, we have a fiscal responsibility to use taxpayer dollars to pay people that actually work,” she said. “That doesn’t mean that we forget our veterans by any means. We are going to care for them in the right way, but perhaps they’re not fit to have a job at this moment, or not willing to come to work. And we can’t, you know, I wouldn’t take money from you and pay somebody and say, ‘Sorry, you know, they’re not going to come to work.’ It’s just not acceptable.”\n\nConsidering that 90 percent of the hires of this administration are “not fit” for the jobs they hold, including Ms. Habba her own self, this is a bold position to take.\n\nThen there are the Fox News weekend C-listers, including the wife of our present secretary of transportation, lauding Idaho for bringing back cursive writing in the public schools. From C&L:\n\nFox News hosts posited that Democrats were conspiring to end cursive writing in schools so children are unable to read the U.S. Constitution. During a Sunday segment on Fox & Friends Weekend, co-host Rachel Campos-Duffy noted that one Idaho bill would force schools to teach cursive in elementary schools. “So you guys, I didn’t realize this is a generational thing,” Campos-Duffy said. “I talked to our producers, who are a lot younger than us. And they said some of them don’t write in cursive, and they don’t even know how.”\n\nCo-host Peter Doocy noted that Democratic former President Joe Biden had “bad” cursive handwriting. “But you know, one of my favorite conspiracy theories, and I kind of believe it, is that the reason Democrats don’t want people to learn how to write cursive is so they can’t read the actual Constitution,” co-host Charlie Hurt opined.\n\nDoes Mr. Hurt drop in f’s in place of s’s when he writes home to his mother? That must be very confusing.\n\nAnd, finally, there’s Kingsley Wilson, a deputy director of public affairs at the Defense Department, who would like you to know that everything you know about an infamous case of lynching in 1915 is wrong.\n\nLeo Frank raped & murdered a 13-year-old girl. He also tried to frame a Black man for his crime. The ADL turned off the comments because they want to gaslight you.\n\nActually, I suspect they turned off the comments because they got tired of the looney revisionism in a 110-year-old case that is still fraught with controversy.\n\nJesus, these really are the mole people.",

        "source": "https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/",
        "content": "Another rough couple of days for the administration in the nation’s courts. On Tuesday, an appeals court upheld common sense, always a losing issue for this bunch. This comes after a judge in another court told the DOGE and Pony Show to, well, pony up, because he said so, that’s why.\n\nOne of the most audacious acts of this administration is the president’s delusion that he can simply sign away the 14th Amendment’s plain guarantee of birthright citizenship with a stroke of his mighty pen. (Why do they laugh at his mighty pen?) However, Judge David Barron of the Court of Appeals for the First Circuit was having none of it. He points out that the administration’s crack legal team didn’t even address this fundamental issue in its brief.\n\nThe Government expressly declines to make any developed argument that it is likely to succeed on appeal in showing that the Executive Order is either constitutional or compliant with 8 U.S.C. § 1401. Nor does the Government contest that, for more than a century, persons in the two categories that the Executive Order seeks to prevent from being recognized as United States citizens have been so recognized. Instead, the Government contends that it can make the requisite showing for a stay of the preliminary injunction even without developing an argument to us that the Executive Order is lawful and even though the enforcement of the Executive Order would dramatically break with the Executive Branch’s longstanding legal position and thereby disrupt longstanding governmental practices.\n\nMeanwhile, another judge, District Judge Christopher Cooper, has told DOGE to open its books so we can all know what the hell is going on. From Politico:\n\nU.S. District Judge Christopher Cooper said the vast and “unprecedented” authority of DOGE, formally known as the U.S. Digital Service, combined with its “unusual secrecy” warrant the urgent release of its internal documents under the Freedom of Information Act. ... “The authority exercised by USDS across the federal government and the dramatic cuts it has apparently made with no congressional input appear to be unprecedented,” Cooper wrote in a 37-page opinion.\n\n“The rapid pace of [DOGE’s] actions, in turn, requires the quick release of information about its structure and activities,” Cooper wrote. “That is especially so given the secrecy with which DOGE has operated.” Cooper leaned heavily on news reports suggesting that Musk’s operation had led to the firing of tens of thousands of government employees, the dismantling of the U.S. Agency for International Development, a government-wide deferred resignation program and widespread access to sensitive government databases for relative outsiders.\n\nThis is how, in all legal propriety, you call something a rogue agency and tell it to stand and deliver the reasons why it should continue to operate as one.\n\n“Congress needs the requested information in a timely fashion to use it effectively. The electorate also requires the expeditious production and publication of this information,” Cooper said. “Voters may seek to influence congressional representatives to take action responsive to USDS at any point along the road. And ‘[t]he dissemination of information’ sought by CREW would contribute ‘to an informed electorate capable of developing knowledgeable opinions and sharing those knowledgeable opinions with their elected leaders.’ ”\n\nIt’s becoming quite plain that the president’s hail of executive orders is little more than a rain of shadows. Most of them are so deeply unserious that the only people taking them as anything more than empty gestures are the members of the president’s cult in Congress and some of the more credulous members of the media. Once again, the real crunch will come when he runs out of appeals and tries to ignore the final judgments of the courts. That will be the true reckoning.",

        "title": "Shall We See How the President’s Brilliant Trade War Strategies Are Affecting the Folks?",
        "source": "https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/",
        "content": "(Permanent Musical Accompaniment to This Post)\n\nBeing our semi-regular weekly survey of what’s goin’ down in the several states where, as we know, the real work of governmentin’ gets done, and where they sing “Amazing Grace” all the way to the Swiss bank.\n\nLet’s take a brief look around the country to see how the president’s brilliant trade-war strategies are affecting the Folks. From CNBC:\n\nCaleb Ragland, a soybean farmer in Magnolia, Ky., voted for President Donald Trump in 2016, 2020 and 2024. Now, however, he has to navigate a tariff minefield at a time when the sector is already facing major headwinds. … As pressures mount in the industry as a result of tariffs imposed by the second Trump administration—as well as retaliatory levies from other countries—he’s worried about the longevity of his business. “My sons potentially could be the 10th generation if they’re able to farm,” Ragland, who is also the president of the American Soybean Association, told CNBC. “And when you have policies that are completely out of our control—that they manipulate our prices 20%, 30%, and on the flip side, our costs go up–we won’t be able to stay in business.” This isn’t the first time farmers have had to deal with new tariffs. Back in Trump’s first term, the trade war with China in 2018—a time when Ragland said the agricultural economy was “in a much better place than it is right now”—cost the U.S. agriculture industry more than $27 billion, and soybeans made up virtually 71% of annualized losses.\n\nI would point out that Mr. Ragland works in an market that got brained by the president’s trade policies in 2018, the last time the president was in office. And yet he voted for him twice since then. I have given up trying to understand this way of thinking. If you can’t rely on simple self-interest as an explanation for voting patterns, then political science might as well be alchemy or necromancy.\n\nIf the trade war has a front line, it probably runs through places like Point Roberts in Washington State. From Global News:\n\nPoint Roberts is a community of about 1,100 people and it is located just south of Tsawwassen. However, it relies on British Columbia for much of its commerce. “Half of us here are dual citizens, including me—Canadian and American, half of us,” Point Roberts resident Brian Calder and former president of the Point Roberts Chamber of Commerce told Global News. “So there’s 500 of us here that have very strong ties to Canada. And I get that they’re upset and angry that their sovereignty is being threatened for no good reason whatsoever. And the animosity and the apprehension, the anger is very, very detrimental to Point Roberts. They stay away.”\n\n“It’s absolutely devastating for Point Roberts businesses, those that are left because we lost half our businesses in the COVID 20 months lockdown, they couldn’t carry themselves through that long period of time,” Calder said. “And of those left, now, they’re just barely hanging on.”\n\nNone of this, of course, is necessary. It is all so much gratuitous negligence. This is the first international conflict playing out completely in the deteriorating mind of an American president. Which doesn’t mean there are no casualties.\n\nCalder said Point Roberts residents consider British Columbians and Canadians brothers and sisters, not just neighbors. “We didn’t do anything wrong. They didn’t do anything wrong. Why are we in this mess? It’s absolutely stupid and it’s not productive and it’s not necessary or needed. And no one wins.” Calder said tensions are high on both sides of the border but some residents have expressed that they are facing hostility when they cross into Canada, which is part of the reason for the bumper sticker. \"We’ve had people actually try and push people over in traffic,” he said. “We’ve had people confronted down at the drug store in Tsawwassen. ‘What are you doing here? Get back to your own (country)’. We don’t have a drug store.”\n\nWe move along to Utah, which was a pioneer in adopting mail-in voting and which remained a reliably conservative state anyway. Now, however, out of what appears to be pure spite, the state legislature seems determined to blow up that proud history. From Bolts:\n\nLannie Chapman, the county clerk who runs this office and serves as the top elections official in Utah’s most populous county, eyed the artifact and considered how different, and difficult, her work would be if the state ever went back to voting the way it did when the old booth was in use. “No, thank you,” she said at the prospect, laughing. “It’s fun for a photo op, but that’s about it.”\n\nThe hypothetical may be a bit too close for comfort. A few miles up the road from Chapman’s Salt Lake City office, at the Utah State Capitol, lawmakers have just put the finishing touches on a major voting-system overhaul: House Bill 300, which passed the Republican-controlled legislature March 6, would end universal vote-by-mail in Utah. It’s a landmark reform that would close an era in which Utah occupied a unique place in the national patchwork of election rules: Since 2019, it’s been the only reliably red state in the country to automatically mail a ballot to every registered voter. HB 300 would instead require any Utah voter to proactively request a mail ballot. It would also impose additional restrictions on how they must return these ballots, for instance by ending the grace period for when they must be delivered to election offices by postal workers. “We are known for safe, secure, and convenient access, and this is going to make everything a lot more difficult,” Chapman said. “It’s not fair to our voters.”\n\nThis is simply conservative fanaticism run amok. Voting officials in Utah from both parties swear by the current vote-by-mail system, and the people seem to like it a great deal. But as Bolts learned, the people carrying the water for these changes are doing so for people far from the Beehive State.\n\nBolts put the question to state Representative Jefferson Burton, the Republican lawmaker who championed the bill. Burton conceded that the audit found no widespread fraud in Utah, and that vote-by-mail has increased turnout. But he cited an “Election Integrity Scorecard” by the Heritage Foundation, the influential national conservative think tank that published Project 2025, the right-wing blueprint for Donald Trump’s second term. The scorecard ranks Utah 33rd among all states and the District of Columbia, docking Utah significantly for its policies on voter ID and absentee balloting. Burton said he expects that HB 300 will vault Utah into the list’s top 10, and made clear that he tailored his bill to that aim. “They [Heritage] think it should be a conscious decision for a voter to opt in to vote by mail,” he said. The lobbying arm of the Heritage Foundation, Heritage Action, has endorsed Burton’s bill.\n\nVivisecting a successful election system in Utah in order to gain brownie points with a right-wing intellectual chop shop in Washington is quite cultlike.\n\nAnd we conclude, as is our custom, in the great state of Oklahoma, whence Blog Official Cod-Soaker Friedman of the Algarve brings us a tale of bad chemistry. From News4 in Oklahoma City:\n\nLane Garrett and his family bought their land along the banks of the Cimarron River 16 years ago. “It’s real quiet out here,” Garrett said. “There’s lots of wildlife out here—turkey, quail, deer. There’s a river right over there.” The property sits at the very edge of Logan County, far from the noise and pollution of city life. “Very few people get to look out their kitchen window and see a river,” Garrett said.\n\nSounds idyllic. What could go wrong in paradise?\n\nThat’s why he and his family were frustrated when, in June 2024, they learned a pipeline would be running through their land. Phillips 66 went through the courts to condemn part of the family’s land, securing an easement to build the oil pipeline.\n\nOh, that could go wrong.\n\nConstruction began in January. “They bored underneath the river, and then it came up there on that north bank,” Garrett said. But with the work came a mess. “Just trash, you know, pop cans, chip cans,” Garrett said. “Cigarette butts, things like that.” Then, his brother, William, smelled something near the crew’s boring machine. “I was like, What? What is that? I know that smell, and I know it’s not good. What is that?” William Garrett said. “And then finally looked down and just a pool of hydraulic fluid.” Hydraulic fluid—and a lot of it—was seeping into their pasture. “I would say a good 20 feet to the north, you’d find it on the mud, little drops of where hydraulic fluid had just been sprayed in kind of a west-out direction,” Lane Garrett said.\n\nAfter first denying the whole thing, Phillips 66, the extraction beast that owned the pipeline, assured the Garretts that the hydraulic fluid had been cleaned up. They made a big show of doing so, even though the Garretts thought all the company was doing was “pushing dirt around.” When the cleanup was finally done, Garrett drilled a borehole into the area that allegedly had been cleaned. You can probably guess what they found.\n\n“You can see all that goopiness, all that hydraulic fluid,” William Garrett said. Sure enough, it was all still there—and thanks to recent rains—now heavily soaked into the groundwater all over their pasture, just yards away from the Cimarron River. Land—that the Garretts rely on. “I cut hay, bale hay, and then feed it, you know, to my neighbor’s cattle,” Lane Garrett said. It was supposed to be his family’s quiet paradise, away from the pollution.\n\n“It’s land that I put a lot of blood, sweat, and tears into,” Lane Garrett said. But now, he says it’s land—he just can’t trust. “Now, rather than having chemicals just sitting on top of my pasture, now I’ve got a ball of chemicals, you know, five, six feet down underground in there, and that’s all going to kill everything above it,” Garrett said. “I just—I wanted all that stuff cleaned up. You know, I wish that, you know, the guys on the site, that they would have just been upfront, said, hey, look, there was an accident. This is what happened.”\n\nPipelines leak, and the companies that own them lie. That’s all ye know and all ye need to know.\n\nThis is your democracy, America. Cherish it.\n\n\n\n",

Never forgetting, but forgiving. There is power in forgiving.”\n\nNORMAN JEAN ROY Salaam with his wife, Sanovia, and their son Yusef Jr. Note Salaam’s ring, which he designed himself to commemorate the exoneration.\n\nSpare a thought for the falsely accused. For the man sent to prison as a boy for something he didn’t do. Does anyone ever allow the reality of a false accusation to sink in and upset the equilibrium for even a moment, or is it just in and out and on to the next, like everything else? That accusation, after all, was leveled on our behalf. State power is derived from us. Justice is meant to make us whole. But what does an injustice do to us? When an innocent person serves a full prison sentence, gets out carrying the excruciating knowledge that justice is for other people and facts and innocence don’t matter when you’re a kid raised by your mom in an apartment on Fifth Avenue, uptown—Harlem, U. S. A. Spare a thought for the falsely accused.\n\nHe can’t walk down the street for getting stopped by people who have never met him but to whom he is famous. In this neighborhood, the man who was falsely accused is well-known. The elders have known him for decades, since he was a tall, skinny kid with a flattop, on the front page of all the papers. The city was coming apart in 1989—you could’ve lit the air with a match, the racial tension was that combustible. And the crime that he was accused of committing was so terrible that once he and his codefendants were identified to the public on the word of the police, the case was over before it even began. White victim, a young professional out for a jog in Central Park, raped and beaten nearly to death with a tree branch, three quarters of the blood in her body soaked into the ground. The accused were Black and brown, five of them, aged fourteen to sixteen, four confessing on videotape. What more is there to know? New York in the aftermath was a tinderbox, braying for justice, instead finding vengeance, which is supposed to belong only to God, according to God Himself.\n\nRead We are celebrating our 90th anniversary with a wildly ambitious package called The Next 90. Learn more about it, as well as Esquire’s living legacy, in this letter from Editor-in-Chief Michael Sebastian.\n\nA local man who had inherited a real estate fortune even took out full-page ads in all the local papers calling for the state to bring back the death penalty, writing: “What has happened to the respect for authority, the fear of retribution by the courts, society and the police for those who break the law . . . ?”\n\nBut that was a lifetime ago, and so some others here in Harlem seem to recognize the falsely accused man not as Yusef Salaam of the Central Park Five but as Yusef Salaam, current candidate for public office, running to represent Harlem on the New York City Council. He’s not yet even in office, but the expectation invested in him is daunting. On the street, Harlemites are taking him in, greeting him with broad smiles and queuing up for selfies, bumping elbows and shaking hands, happy that this gracious man of forty- nine has not only come through the time the state stole from him without bitterness but has agreed to be a voice for the ambitions, grievances, and despair of this beautiful, historic, and desperate neighborhood in America’s largest city. He has a ready smile and a welcoming face. “Blessings, blessings, blessings!” he will greet old friends and new. As a politician, he is a complete novice, but for the retail politicking that is the bedrock of democracy—hearing from people on the street where they live—he has a natural gift. He is inexperienced enough at the game that he will stay and talk until you’re done with him. And a city-council district may be democracy in its purest form—big enough to require a proper campaign in order to prove your worth, small enough that an officeholder, especially a rookie, might legitimately feel responsible for every soul and pothole in it.\n\nSalaam likens any neighborhood to a human body, and each of us to cells in the body—if you put healthy, nutritious food into a body and take care to educate the mind, do things in moderation and get good rest, the body will be functioning, flourishing, and happy. If you eat badly or partake in unhealthy habits, do drugs or sleep irregularly, then the body gets sick. Dies. It’s not a bad metaphor for how society works, and it allows for just how interdependent we actually are much more than our current politics does. If some of us are left out or are doing poorly, the health of all of society is put at risk.\n\nThe needs of this body, of Salaam’s neighborhood, are intense. And as he makes his way up and down its streets, from all sides, his fellow Harlemites come to him:\n\n“You know how long it’s been since the senior center had a coat of paint?” says a man holding a cue stick at the Lieutenant Joseph P. Kennedy Jr. Center. “And we sure could use another pool table—gives people a place to gather in the evenings. . . .”\n\nNORMAN JEAN ROY\n\nThis article appeared in the 90th Anniversary issue of Esquire\n\nsubscribe\n\nA woman buttonholes him at a community meeting at Graham Court, a Gilded Age gem on Adam Clayton Powell Jr. Boulevard that has seen better days: “What are you going to do about the defecation and the urination that goes on outside my front door?!”\n\n“I applied for affordable housing, but affordable housing ain’t affordable!” says a man who stops him on 135th Street and comes in for a hug. “We need a two-bedroom, and they’ve had us in a studio for twenty years! . . . I sound Black, right?” He is Asian, and points this out by circling his face with his index finger. “People here don’t look like me, but they sure live like me.” He complains to Salaam about the conduct of corrections officers. “But they just scared. I don’t talk from no textbook—I did fifteen years.” As Salaam begins to walk away to his next appointment, the man reaches out for his hand and issues a plea: “You’ve come too far. Don’t sell yourself out.”\n\nAn older woman on 110th Street stops short of asking for his attention, instead holding back as he speaks to a small cluster of people. Her eyes brimming with tears, she clutches your arm and shakes it gently. “I just can’t get over how much time he lost,” she says. “They are so hard on our men.”\n\nYou point to him and say that Salaam somehow seems unbroken by an experience that might well have destroyed him—publicly vilified at fifteen, wrongfully convicted at sixteen, imprisoned for almost seven years in appalling conditions upstate, on parole for three years, required to register as a sex offender for another three. She dabs her eyes with a tissue and shakes her head hopefully.\n\nEvery concern, every conceivable “issue” that a human life encounters finds its way to Salaam on these streets—hunger, housing security, economic insecurity, public safety, public health, lousy landlords, race discrimination, the human capacity to produce trash, the human tendency to triple- park, for starters.\n\nSpare a thought for the city-council candidate. We drive from Central Harlem down toward his old neighborhood at the northeast corner of Central Park, and Salaam is careful not to go a tick over the speed limit. He’s been pulled over during the campaign and is very mindful not to give anyone any excuse to interrupt his peaceful movements. He pulls into a parking space on 110th Street across from Central Park, not a hundred yards from the building he lived in growing up, just a few hundred yards from the spot in the park where the state said he had committed the crime that altered the course of his life. Salaam hops out of the car and walks around to the passenger side, opens the door for his mother, a soft-spoken woman of regal bearing with shoulder-length salt-and-pepper dreadlocks, who steps out onto the sidewalk, into the neighborhood that her son will soon represent on the New York City Council. Yusef starts to walk his mother in the direction of home when a young man, slight and intense and wearing a backpack, approaches him.\n\n“Excuse me,” the young man says. “You’re running for office?”\n\n“Yes,” Salaam says. “I recently won the Democratic primary.” He smiles. “And my opponent in November is apathy.”\n\n“His opponent in November is Write In,” his mother corrects.\n\n“Okay, great,” says the young man. “Let me ask you—what’s the . . . what’s the point?”\n\nSalaam hesitates for just a moment, uncomprehending. “The point of . . .” He leans forward toward the man, as if trying to better pick up his signal. “. . . running for office?\n\n“No,” the young man answers. “I’m out here every two and four years, and I listen to all of you, and I just need to know What’s the point?” He flashes a brilliant smile and projects a crackling energy. There’s a touch of violence in his eyes. In this moment, though, he is intently waiting for an answer.\n\n“Well,” Salaam says, “I believe that in this neighborhood we hold great power that we have never fully exercised. We are too busy dividing ourselves, going after each other—”\n\nThe young man interrupts. “We play by their rules—they play by no rules,” he says. “Oh, they go on about their rules and their Constitution, but when it comes to keeping n***ers down, they just make it up as they go!”\n\n“Okay, okay,” Salaam says. “Now, I know something about them keeping us down.”\n\nIt is pretty clear that the young man doesn’t know who Salaam is. He looks to be about thirty, and although he grew up in Harlem, he likely wasn’t yet born when Salaam was sent to prison. He interrupts again.\n\n“I’m sure you’ve been through some things,” he says. “Well, I’ve experienced some things, too.”\n\nThe air between them bristles.\n\n“Tell me about your life, brother,” Salaam says.\n\nThe young man has a wide view and is well versed in politics, local and national—and he speaks urgently. He also has a specific issue. He sells weed, is an “entrepreneur,” and has been paying keen attention to the city’s pronouncements and actions, as over the past two years, Harlem has steadily filled with smoke shops that are killing his business. “I’m trying to figure out why outsiders are now selling legal marijuana on our streets. These shops aren’t licensed and could be a danger to the public. I want to participate in the legit economy, but these motherfuckers . . .”\n\nSalaam has been watching the young man closely as he flashes rage with his eyes and immediately takes it back with his smile. An astonishing dynamic is emerging on this sidewalk in Harlem. Yusef Salaam, who had every reason to give up on society, or “the system,” or America, is straining to prevent the young man from doing the same. And the young man, well, he is desperate for a reason to believe and is not yet sure that he is finding it.\n\n“Brother, we are trapped inside of someone else’s hundred-year plan,” Salaam says. “The only way to break out of it and make our own plan is together. The only thing I know is that we as a community have never used our power—”\n\n“Is there a we?!” the young man snaps. “Am I a we?” He flashes that smile as he looks inward, momentarily amused by the wordplay. “Who are we?”\n\nAnd then he drops the smile and levels his gaze. “Because I’m not playing—I’m ready to burn this motherfucker down. What is the strategy, and why should I give a shit in the first place? Why be involved?”\n\nSalaam: Because I know enough from when the spike wheels of “justice” ran over me and my family thirty-four years ago that if we are not involved and in numbers, and using our voice to change the world, then they will use our voices against us. Brother, you have to trust me when I say that divided, we won’t stand a chance.\n\nYoung man [more urgently this time]: Hear me out. Do we have to burn it down, or what kind of political changes you talking about?\n\nSalaam: I’m not a politician, brother.\n\nYoung man: Then what are you?\n\nSalaam: I’m you.\n\nNORMAN JEAN ROY The future councilman in Harlem. “There was a saying in my neighborhood: When the cops come looking for you, any n-i-g-g-e-r will do.” He is careful to spell out the word.\n\nThere were twenty boys rampaging in the park that night.\n\nThere were thirty-two. There were forty.\n\nIt was the Central Park Ten.\n\nThe Central Park Six.\n\nThe Central Park Five.\n\nThere was “plenty of physical evidence” linking the five to the attack.\n\nThere was no physical evidence linking any of the five to the attack.\n\nThe police interrogations were conducted by the book.\n\nThe defendants were coached, their confessions were coerced, and they were told that if they just admitted involvement in the jogger attack, they could go home.\n\nFor a case that has now been closed twice, there remains a lot in dispute. Well, maybe better to say that some very powerful people cling to a version of events that has since been abandoned as untrue. What is now clear is that the convictions of the Central Park Five were won in spite of grievous flaws in the evidence—perhaps it’s better to say in spite of a grievous lack of evidence. Because what is also now clear is that there was physical or biological evidence connecting only one person to the assault on the jogger that night—a person not among the five defendants. For that night in April 1989, there is no reliable accounting for exactly where those five teenagers were and when, nor exactly what they may or may not have been doing. Maybe better just to say that the Central Park Five didn’t commit the terrible crime for which they were convicted.\n\nWhat is not disputed is that on the night of April 19, 1989, a young investment banker named Trisha Meili was out for a run in Central Park when she was attacked, raped, viciously beaten, and left for dead in the bushes three hundred feet from the park’s 102nd Street crossover. Unconscious and near death, she would be found by passersby at 1:30 a.m.\n\nEarlier that evening, witnesses would tell police that some kids had been assaulting pedestrians near the Central Park reservoir, several blocks south. In response, cops had flooded the park and hauled a large group of teen–agers to the precinct located at the center of Central Park. Among them were fourteen-year-old Raymond Santana and fourteen-year-old Kevin Richardson, who did not know each other. The boys were expecting to be sent home when Meili’s near-lifeless body was found. A call from a detective at Metropolitan Hospital would stop their release and mark the beginning of a legal and social nightmare that would come to be recognized as one of the most shameful failures in the history of American justice.\n\nThe next day, April 20, based on descriptions from the boys already in custody, fifteen-year-old Antron McCray was also questioned by police. No one seems to know for sure how the police came to be looking for Yusef Salaam, but it seems that the cops had a description of another boy—tall kid with a flattop—that sounded like Yusef.\n\nSalaam’s brother Shareef had heard that the police were looking for his brother and begged him not to go outside that afternoon. Salaam’s sister, Aisha, remembers that Shareef, who was bigger than his older brother, wrestled Yusef to the floor to keep him from leaving the apartment. “Aisha!” Yusef yelled. “Get him off of me!” Shareef finally let go of his brother, and Aisha and Yusef took the elevator down to the lobby, where they ran into Yusef’s friend Korey Wise, sixteen, who also lived in the building. The building security guard told them that at least three police officers had just taken the elevator up to the Salaam apartment.\n\nAisha is the oldest of the siblings and says she thought that if she could just talk to the police, they’d understand their mistake. Her brother was a placid young man, averse to physical confrontations, she says. When a mugger once demanded his money, he emptied his pockets without hesitation. Another time, when Yusef was on his bike and a thief approached him and said, “Get off,” Yusef got off.\n\n“Let’s go up and talk to them,” Aisha Salaam remembers telling her brother. Korey Wise went upstairs with his friend and offered to go with Yusef to the precinct to keep him company. Those five—Santana, Richardson, McCray, Salaam, and Wise —would become the Central Park Five.\n\nWhen the police came for Yusef on the evening following the rape and beating of Trisha Meili, they knocked on his apartment door on the twenty- first floor of 1309 Fifth Avenue. Shareef Salaam answered the door in his underwear. Get dressed, you’re coming with us, they told him. What? Why? the confused teenager asked the cops. Are you Yusef Salaam? they asked. That’s my brother, he said. And that, Yusef Salaam says, is how close his brother came to also being a member of the Central Park Five.\n\n“There was a saying in my neighborhood,” Salaam tells me. “When the cops come looking for you, any n-i-g-g-e-r will do,” taking care to spell the word rather than say it.\n\nSharonne Salaam was a single mother who taught fashion design at Parsons School of Design in Greenwich Village. When she got home from work that evening, Aisha and Shareef were both hysterical that the police had taken Yusef in for questioning in connection with the crime that was exploding in the news across the city that day. Sharonne at first thought they were joking. She walked through the apartment, looking in closets and under beds. Okay, that’s enough—you can come out now. When she realized that her oldest son really wasn’t there, Sharonne sat Aisha and Shareef down and said, Calm down and tell me the full story again, from the beginning.\n\n“I was a pariah. They said I was born a mistake. I’m not a mistake,” Salaam tells me. “And I think that what I have been through gives me perspective on what people go through in life. I never thought about politics or holding elective office until recently, but I feel that this—I guess you might call it empathy—will be helpful to me as I serve my community. If, as Nietzsche says, you can find the why, then you can live any how. We all need a reason to live. This is mine. I was supposed to go through what I went through.”\n\nWe are sitting alone in a cluttered little office on 135th Street—a local Democratic club that doubles as his campaign office. There are mismatched photographs of past club officers on the wall, the flooring is peeling, and campaign literature is piled haphazardly on every surface. It was from here that Salaam took on and defeated two establishment candidates in the primary for his council seat. He now has a fully germinated idea of how his story fits into the larger story of loss and struggle and perseverance that defines the Black experience in this town and in this country, and he speaks it in full paragraphs, only occasionally lapsing into the rote poetry of the motivational speaker he now is. “For Black Americans, robbed of our names, our culture, our God, it is just a short step further to lose your mind, too,” he says. “But what if a person doesn’t lose his mind? What if a person instead taps back into the memory in Sankofa, which is the sacred knowledge from your past that enables you to live in your present?”\n\nHe takes special meaning and great comfort from this African concept—Sankofa—of looking back to live forward. With meaning comes purpose, with purpose comes acceptance. So that in part explains how he came through the fire, as his uncle Frank describes the experience. Many people never come through it but instead are consumed by it. The other part was the unstinting support of his mother, his grandmother, his siblings, and his uncle, who is a father figure. Without their belief, he says, he may well have lost his own.\n\nIt was Salaam’s grandmother who told him to find meaning in the tribulation. She told him, “Yusef, I don’t know why they’re doing this to you, but be still and listen.” When he was in prison, she wrote to him every week, addressing the letters to “Master Yusef Salaam,” because she wanted whoever processed the letters to know that her grandson was somebody.\n\nIt was Salaam’s mother who made sure that he did not confess on videotape, and he was the only one of the five who didn’t. It was Salaam’s mother who repeatedly refused consent for police to question Yusef. It was Salaam’s mother who insisted instead that her son be given an attorney and who told him to stop talking to investigators immediately. “She told me: ‘You will not participate in your own destruction,’ ” Salaam says. “They were breaking us down. They would have broken me, too, without my mother.”\n\nAfter his conviction, his mother would keep vigil at the prison, making the trip upstate from the city once or twice a week for the entire six years and eight months that he was incarcerated—to Dannemora, Harlem Valley, wherever they moved him to. She would often switch the days of the week so as to disrupt routine—a sort of surprise inspection, so that prison staff would never know for sure when she might show up. “It was the only way to make sure he stayed alive,” she says. “I had to keep Yusef alive.”\n\nIt was his mother who would call him in 2002 to tell him that the person who had actually committed the crime for which he was convicted—a serial rapist and killer named Matias Reyes—had confessed to the rape and assault of Trisha Meili. By then, Salaam was living in Stone Mountain, Georgia, trying with difficulty to put together some kind of life. Reyes had found Jesus, she told her son. Knew details only a crime’s perpetrator would know. The swabs taken from the victim that night so long ago had immediately matched Reyes’s DNA. Sharonne Salaam delivered this news, and then they both sat in stunned silence on the phone for what seemed like a long time.\n\nSpare a thought for the mother of the falsely accused.\n\nThe young man’s eyes narrow as he processes what Salaam has just said: “The spike wheels of justice ran over your family?” His eyes widen as the identity of the man he’s talking to dawns on him. Not fifty yards from where we stand there is now an entrance to Central Park called the Gate of the Exonerated, dedicated last year as a monument to the falsely accused men, and as an admonition to the unwritten future to do better than we have done. It also stands in stone as a reminder that even in a time defined by our seeming inability to acknowledge error, extend grace, apologize to each other, and correct course, lost truths can still be found and long-delayed justice is not always justice denied. The young man’s shoulders soften, the brilliant smile takes over his face, and he offers Salaam his hand but instead comes in for a hug. If Salaam has reason for hope, the young man seems to concede, how insurmountable could his grievances be?\n\nThe young man walks into the afternoon, and Salaam stands on the street in his old neighborhood, thinking of the exchange and of the challenge of persuading others to believe in a system from which they feel estranged. If anyone understands that, it is Salaam. No one in a position of power and direct responsibility for his indictment, conviction, and imprisonment has apologized or even acknowledged error. When the prosecutor who oversaw the case against the Central Park Five heard of Reyes’s confession and the conclusive evidence of his guilt, she said, “I think Reyes ran with that pack of kids. He stayed longer when the others moved on. He completed the assault. I don’t think there is a question in the minds of anyone present during the interrogation process that these five men were participants not only in the other attacks that night, but in the attack on the jogger.”\n\nThe New York police commissioner ordered a review of the investigation, and the resulting report found the department blameless, asserting despite a paucity of evidence that “it is more likely than not that the defendants participated in an attack upon the jogger.” As if “more likely than not” were an acceptable standard of criminal justice anywhere anyone would want to live.\n\nWhen asked if he regretted placing the ads in all the local papers calling for the death penalty in the wake of the attack, ads that contributed to the toxic atmosphere in New York City and potentially compromised the defendants’ ability to receive fair trials, that real estate heir, Donald Trump, who by then was president of the United States, declined to apologize, saying, “They admitted their guilt.”\n\nSpeaking about this ignominious record, Salaam is encyclopedic. The people who are vested in the false accusation are, he thinks, also the people who remain vested in the notion that it is simply inevitable that people who look like him must eventually wind up in the system. The deference to prison is still that powerful. And it is that matrix that he believes must be broken. Yusef Salaam’s time on earth puts him at the nexus of many things that have come to define American life—our never-healing racial wound, our deeply ingrained antipathy between police and communities of color, and, in the most promising instance, our response to the revanchism of the Trump-led reversion to our worst impulses—in the stubborn hope that we can be and do better by participation in public life.\n\nSalaam is surprisingly light and free of rancor. Appreciates complexity and nuance in an era not known for either. As a budding public servant, for instance, he believes in the police. “We can all be victims of crime,” he says. “Some of us are also victims of the police. That doesn’t mean all policing is bad. It means that we need better policing. I know in an intimate way the cops who get away with doing bad things by saying that they were just doing their job—they were not just doing their job.”\n\nHe doesn’t seem to relish obvious opportunities to settle scores. When asked for a reaction earlier this year after former president Trump was criminally indicted in New York City, Salaam offered a simple one-word response: “Karma.”\n\nAs he stands here on his mother’s street, he contemplates what it might mean to absolve those who resist responsibility for their actions. What does an injustice do to us? The state has the power to condemn, to absolve, to forgive on behalf of society, the people, us. But whose power is it to forgive a recalcitrant state when the state doesn’t possess the grace or wisdom to even seek forgiveness?\n\nIt is a supreme irony of our time that that power belongs to the powerless, to the wronged, to the falsely accused and imprisoned. It belongs to the victims of misused state power. It belongs to Yusef Salaam. It is the most aggrieved who must, it seems, also be the most gracious.\n\nSalaam raises his arms and opens his hands, as if releasing something into the New York sky. “I have had to learn how to forgive. It is the only way I know to repair myself. I have to forgive Donald Trump,” he says, gesturing down Fifth Avenue. “I forgive the prosecutors . . . I forgive the police . . . I forgive those who have threatened me and who told me to watch my back forever. I forgive. I forgive. I forgive.”\n\n\n\nStory: Mark Warren\n\nPhotos: Norman Jean Roy\n\nStyling: Bill Mullen\n\nProduction: Danelle Manthey at Somersault Productions\n\nProduction Design: Michael Sturgeon\n\nTailoring: Joseph Ting\n\nCreative Direction: Nick Sullivan\n\nDesign Direction: Rockwell Harwood\n\nVisuals Direction: Justin O'Neill\n\nExecutive Producer, Video: Dorenna Newton",

FALLON // Getty Images In this photo from 2022, three-year-old Anna Kuts sleeps on a suitcase after arriving with her family to the Tijuana airport, where volunteers would then shuttle them to the U.S. Anna and her family had fled the war in Ukraine after Russia invaded the country in 2022.\n\nThese fcking people. From Reuters:\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump’s administration is planning to revoke temporary legal status for some 240,000 Ukrainians who fled the conflict with Russia, a senior Trump official and three sources familiar with the matter said, potentially putting them on a fast-track to deportation. The move, expected as soon as April, would be a stunning reversal of the welcome Ukrainians received under President Joe Biden’s administration. The planned rollback of protections for Ukrainians was underway before Trump publicly feuded with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy last week. It is part of a broader Trump administration effort to strip legal status from more than 1.8 million migrants allowed to enter the U.S. under temporary humanitarian parole programs launched under the Biden administration, the sources said.\n\nOn Thursday morning, the White House denied the report, calling it “fake news.” Later in the day, Trump acknowledged he’s weighing the decision. “There were some people that think that’s appropriate, and some people don’t, and I’ll be making the decision pretty soon,” he said.\n\n\n\nIt is possible that this move is just part of the draconian anti-immigrant policies that a group of mayors—including Boston’s Michelle Wu—tore up before a congressional committee on Wednesday. As the Reuters story points out, the rollback was ongoing before the Oval Office ambush of Zelenskyy last week. But it should be seen in the context of other events, not merely the ambush but also Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth’s ordering the cessation of U.S. cyber operations against Russia. (The Pentagon has subsequently denied that this ever happened. YMMV.) It should be colored by the accurate perception that the administration is doing the Kremlin’s business by selling out Ukraine for a “peace” deal by which Ukraine gains nothing, and by edging toward an abandonment of NATO that is so obvious that French president Emmanuel Macron took to the electric TV machine to warn that the lamps are beginning to dim all over Europe again. The president has allied the country with a failing kleptocracy run by an international thug who is even money one day to flee to a Pacific island with all of his country’s wealth he can grab on the way out of town.\n\nUkrainian refugees were an international feel-good story in the immediate aftermath of the Russian invasion. (Among other places, Ireland welcomed them with open arms.) Now—in this country, anyway—they’re just another bargaining chip in a rigged game between a couple of incompetent autocrats. It is to weep.",

        "content": "The prosecution of El Caudillo del Mar-a-Lago wrapped up in Manhattan, but not before things got lively again. The defense called as its first witness one Robert Costello, who once advised prime prosecution witness Michael Cohen. (Costello was a close associate of Rudy Giuliani, which figures.) Costello has been a critic of the state’s case in the Stormy Daniels payoff case, and of Cohen, once the latter hit the silk on the former president*. There was extended legal wrangling over whether Costello could testify at all and, at least, about the limits of what he would be allowed to say. Once he got on the stand, however, he put on a very impressive show. Judge Juan Merchan was not amused. From The Guardian:\n\nJudge Juan Merchan ordered the courtroom cleared of reporters after warning Robert Costello about his responses to sustained objections. “I want to discuss proper decorum in my courtroom,” Merchan said. “So when there’s a witness on the stand and you don’t like my ruling, you don’t say ‘jeez,’ and you don’t say ‘strike it.’ Because I’m the only one who can strike....You don’t roll your eyes, do you understand that? Do you understand that? Are you staring me down right now?”\n\n“Clear the courtroom,” he then ordered.\n\nThe media have been allowed back inside after Judge Juan Merchan ordered to clear the courtroom. Court officers and Merchan would not let an attorney for the press make an application to argue for the right to stay in the courtroom. Under the law, a representative for the media or even a member of the media is allowed to petition in open court for the opportunity to stay. Trump’s non-lawyer entourage was allowed to stay.\n\nMonday’s “non-lawyer entourage” included Bernie Kerik and Alan Dershowitz. I guess we’re down to the U-Team now.",

        "source": "https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/",
        "content": "Not that it will matter to anyone except the farmers in California, and then not until this summer when things get hot and dry, but the administration’s release of a massive amount of water on January 30 was almost altogether a photo op. At the time, more than a few people noticed that the release of the water, ostensibly to help quench the epic wildfires that had been raging in and around Altadena and Pacific Palisades, wasn’t doing any good.\n\nCol. Chad W. Caldwell, commander of the Army Corps’ Sacramento district, wrote that the water that poured out of Lake Kaweah and Success Lake “could not be delivered to Southern California directly.” To do so would have required several steps of coordination with state and federal agencies to transport the water to a rarely used connection point, and it quickly became clear that was impossible in such little time, according to the memo.\n\nThe release was done to satisfy Trump’s executive order, Caldwell wrote. And the colonel had also been asked to send photos of the water to Washington, according to an official familiar with the request who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly. Trump posted a photo of water flowing from Lake Kaweah on X the next day.\n\nThere is something so ridiculous and clumsy about this scheme—and it says so much about the childish irresponsibility of the administration—that it’s easy to lose sight of what a destructive episode this likely will turn out to be. Two reservoirs vital to the Central Valley’s growing season have been prematurely drained.\n\n... the episode, a week and a half into Trump’s second term, drew criticism from farmers and officials from both parties in the Central Valley. It also angered many California water officials, who charge that the Trump administration squandered local water supplies in a part of the state where every drop counts, to score quick political points.\n\n“This was completely unprecedented,” said one water official in California who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe concerns about the federal government’s approach. Even though the Los Angeles fires were declared contained soon after the release began, Trump celebrated what he called the “beautiful water flow that I just opened in California ... I only wish they listened to me six years ago,” Trump wrote on X on Jan. 31. “There would have been no fire!”\n\nThat’s pretty much where we all are these days—drowning on the wrong side of the mountains to do any good.",

        "source": "https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/",
        "content": "America is a great country because every foul-tempered has-been hack can grow up to be president. From Politico:\n\n“I’ve only been back two months, I have no idea what I’m doing,” Rahm I. Emanuel, operative-turned-politician-turned-diplomat told me before adding his stock line since returning from serving as ambassador to Japan. “I’m not done with public service and I’m hoping public service is not done with me.”\n\nI’m telling you, Tiger Beat on the Potomac’s Jonathan Martin is positively aglow at the thought of this boorish triangulator back in the spotlight. In the immortal words of the late Mr. Zappa—“Oooh, gooey, dripping, steaming!”\n\nSince coming home in January from his stint in Tokyo—a job he repurposed to be American envoy to all of Asia—Emanuel has been as visible as any other Democrat. Never mind that he currently holds no office and hasn’t been on a ballot for a decade. Name the political podcast and Emanuel has likely been on it or will be shortly. He immediately snagged a CNN contract and regular Washington Post column, no small accomplishment for a former official at a moment of retrenchment for news organizations. He’s also hitting the lecture circuit, appearing for paid and gratis gigs before audiences such as the Realtors and the Chicago Economic Club. Emanuel is pointedly avoiding Ivy League campuses and later this month will make his first stop on a service academy tour when he speaks at West Point. Just as striking is to talk to anybody in high-level Democratic politics who knows Emanuel—which is to say most everyone—and hear how matter of fact they are about the inevitability of his candidacy.\n\nI cannot think of another Democrat more unsuited to the current political moment than Rahm Fcking Emanuel, whose only real political gift is alienating members of his party’s political base. He is now recasting himself as the man with all the grown-up concerns. He’s following the recent trail blazed by Gavin Newsom, except that, unlike Newsom, Emanuel isn’t directly attacking a segment of the trans community. He’s asking the Democrats to blow past the issue entirely, and it’s making Jonathan Martin positively giddy.\n\n“I am done with the discussion of locker rooms, I am done with the discussion of bathrooms and we better start having a conversation about the classroom,” Emanuel said, drawing applause as he alluded to a new study showing more than two-thirds of eighth graders can’t read at grade level. He kept coming back to the study and eventually and explicitly tied the policy to the politics, in Rahm’ian fashion.\n\nOoooh, he has his own adjective now. Do go on.\n\nShortly after his trip to Washington, Emanuel dashed out to Los Angeles to appear on Bill Maher’s show, where he went even further for a less sober audience. “In seventh grade, if I had known I could’ve said the word ‘they’ and gotten in the girls’ bathroom, I would’ve done it,” he said. “We literally are a superpower, we’re facing off against China with 1.4 billion people and two-thirds of our children can’t read eighth grade level.”\n\nThere it all was, in two appearances. Emanuel’s gift for finding a towering issue hidden in plain view; his tactical skills for grasping the political benefits it could confer, delivered with a snappy sound bite to elevate statistics off the page; linking domestic policy to geopolitics and sending a message about another, more controversial topic; and not merely urging Democrats to move on from trans youth issues, but using them as a vehicle to shift the conversation to ground he, and most in his party, would prefer to fight on. Gavin, are you listening?\n\nChristmighty, get a room, will you?\n\nFor the record, Emanuel's history with public education is...how you say?...spotty. As mayor of Chicago, he went to war with the city's teachers and their unions. In 2012, 26,000 members walked out in protest of stalled negotiations on a new contract. The strike went on for seven days despite Emanuel's failed attempt to get a court to order the teachers back to work, and the teachers cleaned his clock. The strike was so successful that it is credited with a revival of unionism in America generally, and with breaking the bipartisan consensus on education \"reform,\" particularly in the area of standardized testing, which has lost a great deal of its allure.\n\nIn fact, Emanuel's tenure as mayor of Chicago unquestionably will be the focus of all the oppo should he actually run for president, and the most fruitful area of research will be Emanuel's relationship to the renegade Chicago Police Department. (How renegade? The Guardian revealed that the CPD was running what essentially was a black site in an old warehouse.) It was his pattern to deflect and stonewall on police accountability until cornered by the weight of public outcry and/or the power of a federal investigation. At which point, Emanuel would make a great show of getting \"out in front\" of the issue. The classic case was the police murder of 17-year old Laquan McDonald in 2014. From Bloomberg:\n\nBy the time of the 2015 deaths of Freddie Gray in Baltimore and Sandra Bland in Texas—both of whom died under questionable circumstances while in police custody—the BLM cause was ascendant. And nowhere did a collision between BLM and the police seem more inevitable at that point than in Chicago, where evidence of decades of police corruption and brutality concerning Black and Latino civilians was surfacing, and it was beyond refutation.\n\n\n\nThis was the political climate that greeted Emanuel as he started his second term as mayor in mid-2015, and he could have gotten in front of the policing issue before a clash happened. Instead, just months into that term, he antagonized both sides. At an October 2015 White House gathering of law enforcement officials, Emanuel said Chicago police officers had gone “fetal”—that they were shrinking back in their public safety duties because of social media-driven backlash to police brutality, or out of fear they’d get caught on live-streaming services doing something shady. In that one statement, he scapegoated police reform activists and infantilized the police force.\n\nThis, I guess, is what Politico would call Emanuel’s tactical skills for grasping political benefits.\n\nI guess that’s what Politico would call Rahm’ian fashion. And then I, for one, will throw up.\n\n\n\n",

        "content": "Lee Zeldin, the new boss of the Environmental Protection Agency, isn’t kidding around. He’s spoilin’ for some despoilin’, and he doesn’t care who knows it. From :\n\nLee Zeldin, the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, reframed the purpose of the E.P.A. In a two-minute-and-18-second video posted to X, Mr. Zeldin boasted about the changes and said his agency’s mission is to “lower the cost of buying a car, heating a home and running a business.”\n\n“From the campaign trail to Day 1 and beyond, President Trump has delivered on his promise to unleash energy dominance and lower the cost of living,” Mr. Zeldin said. “We at E.P.A. will do our part to power the great American comeback.” Nowhere in the video did he refer to protecting the environment or public health, twin tenets that have guided the agency since its founding in 1970.\n\nBecause, as we know, there is no public cost to environmentally inflicted disease or industrial pollution.\n\nMr. Zeldin said the E.P.A. would unwind more than two dozen protections against air and water pollution. It would overturn limits on soot from smokestacks that have been linked to respiratory problems in humans and premature deaths as well as restrictions on emissions of mercury, a neurotoxin. It would get rid of the “good neighbor rule” that requires states to address their own pollution when it’s carried by winds into neighboring states. And it would eliminate enforcement efforts that prioritize the protection of poor and minority communities.\n\nGive Zeldin credit. He may have decided that his job is to help Republican donors poison the whole damn country, but he has by God learned his lines well.\n\nIn perhaps its most consequential act, the agency said it would work to erase the E.P.A.’s legal authority to regulate carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases by reconsidering decades of science that show global warming is endangering humanity. In his video, Mr. Zeldin derisively referred to that legal underpinning as “the holy grail of the climate change religion.” Mr. Zeldin called Wednesday’s actions “the largest deregulatory announcement in U.S. history.” He added, “today the green new scam ends, as the E.P.A. does its part to usher in a golden age of American success.”\n\nIt is a well-established fact that the average American corporation doesn’t have the social conscience God gave the Gaboon viper. Now that attitude has a friendly administration. Zeldin’s brief is to keep the Environmental Protection Agency from doing anything substantive to protect the environment. Here is what passes for optimism.\n\nThe announcements do not carry the force of law. In almost every case, the E.P.A. would have to undergo a lengthy process of public comment and develop environmental and economic justifications for the change.\n\nFirst of all, Zeldin and the administration couldn’t care less about what is said in the “process” of public comment, and they will pull their environmental and economic justifications for the despoilin’ out of the collected works of Professor Otto Yerass. And nobody will be there to stop them. And not for nothing, as Senator Sheldon Whitehouse points out, Zeldin probably lied during his confirmation hearings.\n\n“Today is the day Trump’s Big Oil megadonors paid for,” Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, Democrat of Rhode Island, said. He called the E.P.A. moves a series of attacks on clean air, clean water and affordable energy. “Administrator Zeldin clearly lied when he told us that he would respect the science and listen to the experts,” Mr. Whitehouse said, referring to Mr. Zeldin’s confirmation hearing.\n\nNot that anyone who matters cares. Rivers will die now, choked to death by Fox News talking points.\n\n",

The plaintiffs are an impressively varied array of organizations: the Japanese American Citizens League, the OCA-Asian Pacific American Advocates, the Sierra Club, and the Union of Concerned Scientists...\n\nThe actual casus belli is the promiscuous bloodbath that the DOGE and Pony Show has unleashed among the administrative agencies—the firing of the forest rangers; the elimination of National Park personnel at, among other sites, the national monuments dedicated to the memory of Japanese Americans held in concentration camps during World War II; and, of course, the complete incompetence demonstrated in connection with nuclear safety. But the real meat of things can be found in this outburst of old-fashioned plain talk that introduces the plaintiffs’ filing.\n\nDefendant Elon Musk is not, legally, the President of the United States, nor is he a federal elected official of any kind. And Mr. Musk is not a Senate-confirmed officer of the United States. But he and his so-called “Department of Government Efficiency” (DOGE)—not, in fact, a federal executive department—are lawlessly and unconstitutionally wielding sweeping power across the executive branch. As Mr. Musk and DOGE lawlessly seize power over large swaths of federal spending, decimate the federal workforce, and dismantle federal agencies, they are severely harming, and threatening further imminent harm, to everyday Americans. 2. Mr. Musk and DOGE are running roughshod over the constitutional separation of powers.\n\nFurther, Mr. Musk is exercising the authority of a principal officer of the United States without Senate confirmation—and, indeed, exercising authority even in excess of a principal officer. These actions are ultra vires, violate the U.S. Constitution’s separation of powers, and, as to Mr. Musk, also violate the Constitution’s Appointments Clause. Mr. Musk and DOGE’s lawless actions threaten the bedrock of our democracy, and they are already causing severe harms in a wide array of areas of daily life.\n\nSee how easy that is?",

        "content": "Here is some stupid for lunch.\n\nAnd serving it up is Tail Gunner Ted Cruz, the Texas Tourist, who is now sufficiently MAGA that he’s probably got some AI-generated photos showing his father in a sixth-floor window of the Texas School Book Depository on November 22, 1963. It seems that, inspired by the assault on the federal government by Elon Musk, the Tail Gunner has launched his own dragnet through the executive branch. The Tail Gunner’s probe produced a catalog of waste, fraud, and abuse, except it apparently was run by marmosets. From ProPublica:\n\nA few months ago, Sen. Ted Cruz announced that he had uncovered $2 billion of science grants funded by former President Joe Biden’s administration that prioritized “radical political perspectives” or “neo-Marxist theories.’’ His aides on a congressional committee assembled the list by searching the project descriptions for 699 key terms like “women,” “diversify,” “segregation” and “Hispanic culture.”\n\nWhen Cruz released the database of this allegedly “woke” research earlier this month, we decided to run our own experiment. We asked one of the models powering ChatGPT, which can sift through large amounts of data, to evaluate all 3,500 grant descriptions in the database as if it were an investigative journalist looking for Marxist propaganda, “woke ideology,” or diversity, equity and inclusion.... We found that Cruz’s dragnet had swept up numerous examples of scientific projects funded by the National Science Foundation that simply acknowledged social inequalities or were completely unrelated to the social or economic themes cited by his committee.\n\nThis highly scientific approach to data gathering has produced the inevitably hilarious results.\n\nAmong them, for example, was a $470,000 grant to study the evolution of mint plants and how they spread across continents. As best we can tell, the project ran into trouble with Republicans on the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation because of two specific words used in its application to the NSF: “diversify,” referring to the biodiversity of plants, and “female,” where the application noted how the project would support a young female scientist on the research team.\n\nGive these intrepid gumshoes enough time and God alone knows what waste, fraud, and abuse they could find in the average issue of House & Garden.\n\nOther projects our AI assistant led us to included: developing a device that could treat severe bleeding. It seems to have caught the committee’s attention for using the words “victims”—as in gunshot victims—and “trauma.\"\n\nCreating biosensors to detect infectious diseases. The grant appears to have been tagged for the repeated use of “POC,” an acronym often used for “people of color” but in this context meaning “point of care”—that is, the place where people receive medical treatment—and “barrier,” referring to a part of the biosensor itself.\n\nDesigning eye-tracking technology for diagnosing and treating concussions. It appears to have gotten flagged for referencing “traumatic” brain injuries and the “status,” meaning the condition, of patients.\n\nGenius, I tells ya. Next, how recipes for “mince pie” advance the gay agenda.\n\nElsewhere, Elon Musk’s DOGE and Pony Show isn’t doing much better. It produced what it called a “wall of receipts” purporting to demonstrate how much WF&A its own sleuthing had uncovered. Except it reckoned without the indefatigable David Fahrenthold and his colleagues at The New York Times:\n\nWhile the DOGE team has surely cut some number of billions of dollars, its slapdash accounting adds to a pattern of recklessness by the group, which has recently gained access to sensitive government payment systems. Some contracts the group claims credit for were double- or triple-counted. Another initially contained an error that inflated the totals by billions of dollars. In at least one instance, the group claimed an entire contract had been canceled when only part of the work had been halted. In others, contracts the group said it had closed were actually ended under the Biden administration.\n\nDOGE since has deleted many of the erroneous claims made in the wall of receipts. But between DOGE’s wild inaccuracy and Cruz’s inability to tell mint plants from human beings, I think things are going awfully well, don't you?\n\n",

Here’s how we test products and why you should trust us.\n\n(Permanent Musical Accompaniment To The Last Post Of The Week From The Blog's Favourite Living Canadian)\n\nBy now, a number of people have shared the video of Rep. Bill Keating's standing up for Rep. Sarah McBride against her being deliberately misgendered by dumbass Rep. Keith Self (R-Texas). In fact, Keating's righteous blast at Self was so loud that it almost obscured McBride's neat little thrust of the shiv when she responded to Self as \"Madam Chair.\" Sweet.\n\nAnyway, up here, Keating's response to Self's nasty introduction of McBride came as something of a surprise. In a congressional delegation containing a number of high-profile members, Bill Keating is something of a backbencher, even though he's been in Congress since 2011, representing a district that includes Cape Cod and the south coast of Massachusetts. He's always been a stalwart on issues affecting the LGBTQ+ communities. But the iron in his spine that he demonstrated in Congress the other day comes as no surprise to those of us who remember his noble but failed attempt to overthrow William Bulger as president of the state senate in 1994. This roughly coincided with Bulger's serial killer brother, Whitey's, decision to go on the lam for 16 years. Still, not many people crossed either Bulger and walked away. Keith Self was no problem at all.\n\nOn Thursday, my friend, John Feinstein, passed away unexpectedly at the age of 69. During my days as a daily sports columnist—and, before that, as a daily sports reporter specializing in college basketball in the winter and tennis in the summer—John was a fairly consistent presence in my life in the traveling sportswriting circus that follows the major events of the calendar. A Final Four, or a US Open in Flushing Meadow, without John was unthinkable—although I have to admit, two weeks at the Open with John's constant (and bad) imitation of Ivan Lendl could be a trial. In 1986, of course, he published , an account of a year spent with Bob Knight's Indiana Hoosiers that, through the dint of his dogged reporting, was the first look into the fact that IU's basketball team was being run by a sociopath (although, ultimately, the book pulled that punch). No matter, the book has now sold over eight million copies, and it broke the bestseller lists for sports books of all kinds. After that, John turned out one book after another, like clockwork, every spring. There were two giants of the Father's Day book sales. One was Abraham Lincoln and the other was John Feinstein.\n\nHe could be impossible. He was as dogmatic as anyone I ever met. He knew what he knew, and he thought he knew what you knew, and he would not be shaken in either belief. He had his favorites and he was also unshakable in his support of them. (The most heated argument we ever had was over his support of the late Jim Valvano, whom John adored despite his disdain for most coaches who bent the rules as badly as Valvano did.) But dammit, he also had a heart as big as the Ritz, and that made all the difference, and how can you not love a guy who responded to Knight's calling him both a \"whore\" and a \"pimp\" by saying he wished Knight would make up his mind so he'd know how to dress.\n\nThe great Dave McKenna has written a proper obituary over at Defector. We ran in different circles the past few years, and we'd fallen out of touch. Apparently, his last few years have been tinged with more than a little melancholy. I will miss knowing that he's out there in the world, which is a much quieter place these days, and there are too many empty chairs at the table these days. May his memory be a blessing.\n\nWeekly WWOZ Pick To Click: \"Stomp Off, Let's Go\" (Fat Babies): Yeah, I pretty much still love New Orleans.\n\nWeekly Visit To The Pathé Archives: Here, from 1955, is the arrival of Barbara Porritt, the one-millionth migrant to land in Australia. She shares the video with a Dutch family of 16. Considering how many \"migrants\" arrived in Australia against their will, the sunniness of this arrival is a nice historical antidote. History is so cool.\n\nIn advance of Himself's Day on Monday, Micheál Martin, Taoiseach of Ireland, stopped by the White House this week and got a good closeup look at what we've done to ourselves these days. He was greeted by a presidential \"episode\" that must have made him wonder if all those decades of emigration had been worth it after all. From the AP:\n\nAsked if Ireland, a member of the EU, was taking advantage, too, Trump said, “of course they are. I have great respect for Ireland and what they did and they should have done just what they did, but the United States shouldn’t have let it happen.” He was referring to the concentration of U.S. pharmaceutical companies in Ireland, due to the country’s tax policies. “We had stupid leaders. We had leaders that didn’t have a clue or let’s say they weren’t businesspeople, but they didn’t have a clue what was happening and all of a sudden Ireland has our pharmaceutical companies,” Trump said.\n\nMartin affected the look of a man who suddenly had found himself involved in a carny sideshow as the president went a'wandering in his mind.\n\nAt one point, Trump became distracted as he talked about inflation in the U.S. “By the way, I love these socks. What’s with these socks? I’m trying to stay focused, but I’m very impressed with the VP’s socks,” Trump said, drawing chuckles from others in the room. Vance had worn socks patterned with small green shamrocks as a nod to Martin’s visit. When a reporter asked Martin why his country would let [Rosie] O’Donnell move there, Trump jumped at the opening. “I like that question,” the president said, adding that Martin was ”better off not knowing” about O’Donnell.\n\n(The \"reporter\" who lobbed this hunk of insane banality into the dialogue was Brian Glenn of the Real America's Voice, a wingnut marionette who was the guy who criticized Volodymyr Zelenskyy for not wearing a suit when he met with the president, and who also is famously the current main squeeze of Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene. Here's Tiger Beat On The Potomac's taking Glenn's bullshit seriously.)\n\nDiscovery Corner: Hey, look at what we found! From Smithsonian:\n\nThe Donggung palace complex in present-day South Korea was once an elaborate lakeside retreat with at least 26 buildings used for hosting festivals and banquets. Now, archaeologists have also discovered several innovative “flush” toilets at the 1,300-year-old site, including one that likely drained into a nearby waterway. During recent excavations at the complex, researchers found a small two-room building with a hole in the middle of a cut granite slab, according to a statement from the Korean Heritage Service. On either side of the hole, they found wide stepping stones.\n\nExperts think waste from the toilet funneled into an underground holding chamber, similar to those used in outhouses or portable toilets. A servant likely poured water into the hole to flush the waste down a drain and into the chamber. Inside the palace, researchers also found a flush toilet that “directly discharges human waste into the river through a drain,” Kim Gyeong Yeol, an archaeologist with the Korean Heritage Service who led the recent excavations, tells Live Science’s Owen Jarus. The interior toilet was probably reserved for use by the crown prince and his court ladies.\n\nI would point out that this is pretty much the same system to which the Supreme Court gave its blessing not that long ago. Plus ca change, plus ca ick.\n\nHey ABC News, is it a good day for dinosaur news? It's always a good day for dinosaur news!\n\nThe large rock was excavated from the Callide Basin in central Queensland and gifted to the Moura State High School, where it sat unnoticed for two decades, according to the University of Queensland. When paleontologists were asked by the school to examine a cluster of three-toed track marks on the boulder, they found it contains one of the highest concentrations of dinosaur footprints per square meter ever documented in the country, according to a paper published Monday in Historical Biology.\n\nThe rock contains 66 footprints from 47 individual dinosaurs, Anthony Romilio, a paleontologist at the University of Queensland and lead author of the study, said in a statement. The footprints were likely imprinted onto the boulder as the dinosaurs passed across a patch of wet, white clay, possibly walking along or crossing a waterway during the Early Jurassic period, about 200 million years ago, Romilio said. \"It's an unprecedented snapshot of dinosaur abundance, movement and behavior from a time when no fossilized dinosaur bones have been found in Australia,\" Romilio said.\n\nIn addition to being the name of my next prog rock band, Dinosaur Abundance appeals to me as a concept. Maybe they were all having a dance back in the day. In any case, they gathered then to make us happy now.\n\n\n\nI'll be back on Monday, for whatever fresh hell awaits. Be well and play nice, ya bastids. Stay above the snake-line and wear the damn masks, and take the damn shots, especially the boosters and The New One. In your spare time, spare a thought for everyone touched by the floods in Kentucky and in West Virginia, and by the crash in Washington, and by the measles outbreak in the Southwest, and in the fire zones in Los Angeles, and for all the folks in Ukraine, who stubbornly fight on, and all the folks in Gaza, and all the people in New Orleans, Las Vegas, Nashville, and Queens, who were visited by The Crazy before the year had hardly begun. And the folks in L.A., now fighting floods and mudslides exacerbated by the recent wildfires. And the folks in Lahaina, who are still rebuilding. And all the folks we regularly cited here in the year gone by, and especially for our fellow citizens in the LGBTQ+ community, who deserve so much better from their country than they’ve been getting. And for all of us, who will be getting exactly what we deserve.",

        "content": "I was going to avoid commenting on the automobile ad cut on the White House grounds on Tuesday starring the president of the United States, his principal policy advisor, and the kid. I was going to give it a good leaving alone because I thought it was so self-evidently tacky and inappropriate as to beggar description. I mean, seriously, what’s next? The Tostitos Department of State?\n\nIt was established long before he got into politics that El Caudillo del Mar-a-Lago was the reigning king of garish excess. Every one of his buildings was a gilded palace of sins against good taste. Years back, there was some talk about his buying the New England Patriots, and I distinctly remember writing a column for the Boston Herald in which I speculated that he was likely to build a waterfall into what was then Sullivan Stadium and probably add a white grand piano to one end zone. (Truth be told, the Pats were so bad in those days that any distraction would have been welcome.) And as evidenced by the fact that his wife tore up Jacqueline Kennedy’s rose garden and turned the East Wing into\n\ninto the set of a David Lynch movie for Christmas during his first term, his taste has not been refined very much.\n\nBut this spectacle on Tuesday, with Elon Musk standing there like Beelzebub in a ball cap, was envelope pushing taken to its extreme. “You want the future to look like the future,” Musk explained. “What kind of truck would Blade Runner drive?” Being a replicant himself, Musk has a natural interest in the answer to that question. But the president is just a terrible pitchman. He’s as desperate as one of those guys from Glengarry Glen Ross, talking fast, bragging about his great “imagination,” and apparently sending semaphore with his hands while waving around some promotional material Musk had provided him.\n\n“It’s like a golf cart that goes really fast,” Musk burbled as the president climbed into the driver’s seat.\n\nExcept, of course, sometimes they blow up, and sometimes they sink, and sometimes you have to walk through crowds of people who think Elon Musk really is Beelzebub in a ball cap just to get a test drive that you hope will not blow up or sink. It’s the new Golden Age, folks. Act today. Operators are standing by,",

        "title": "These 10 House Democrats Voted with the Republicans to Censure Rep. Al Green for Interrupting Trump",
        "source": "https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/",
        "content": "On Thursday, the House of Representatives censured Rep. Al Green (D-Texas) for interrupting the president’s farrago of lies and fantasies the other night. Speaker Moses was really puffed up, especially when Democrats in the chamber began singing “We Shall Overcome,” and he had to pound his gavel to try and get them to stop. (Narrator: They didn’t.) Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene and Lauren Boebert, both of whom greeted former president Biden’s State of the Union like a matched set of howler monkeys, voted to censure Green without blinking, as did Rep. Joe Wilson, whose lasting fame is yelling, “You lie!” at President Obama. These were shameful turns of events, but they were nothing compared with the spectacular dive taken by the Democratic congressional elite.\n\nThe buggering out began in the Senate. CNN reported that Senate Democrats were disappointed by Green’s protest. That was a kind of signal to the House Democratic caucus that it was okay to hit the silk on one of its own. From CNN:\n\nHouse Minority Leader Jeffries told CNN earlier Wednesday that the “overwhelming majority” of Democrats approached the speech with seriousness. When asked about Republicans wanting to censure Green and whether that’s appropriate, Jeffries said only: “I haven’t had that conversation with anyone.“ Democrats do not plan to whip members against the censure resolution, allowing lawmakers to vote how they want, according to a person familiar with the matter.\n\nRemind me to cancel Jeffries’s reservation in my foxhole. Yeesh.\n\nUltimately, ten Democrats voted with the Republicans. They were:\n\nAmi Bera of California Ed Case of Hawaii Jim Costa of California Laura Gillen of New York Jim Himes of Connecticut Chrissy Houlahan of Pennsylvania Marcy Kaptur of Ohio Jared Moskowitz of Florida Marie Gluesenkamp Perez of Washington Tom Suozzi of New York\n\nHimes and Kaptur are genuine disappointments, and what a show pony Moskowitz has turned out to be. Himes compounded his surrender by giving to CNN this knives-to-a-gunfight explanation.\n\n“I don’t mind being one of 10 Democrats who said, no, there’s a deeper principle at stake here, which is reverence for this institution,” Himes said after the vote, adding that lawmakers need to act “with the decorum and with the civility that says to the world that we are a serious country. I have no love for Donald Trump, but I do have reverence for the Office of the President,” he told CNN’s Pamela Brown.\n\nI think a proper axiom for the moment is to treat the presidency with the exact amount of reverence for the office displayed by its current occupant. Which is to say as an ATM at a roadside rest stop in the Mojave. And for the benefit of readers not familiar with the Classics, decorum is an ancient Latin word for “chickenshit.”\n\nFor himself, God bless him, Green remains unbowed. It was he who began the singing in the chamber that so aggravated Speaker Moses. I was about to make a joke about preaching to the choir, but I realized that wasn’t so funny anymore.\n\n\n\n",

        "title": "Wyoming Appears to Be in the Middle of an Economic Boom—of Corporate Malfeasance",
        "source": "https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/",
        "content": "(Permanent Musical Accompaniment to this Post)\n\nBeing our semi-regular weekly survey of what’s goin’ down in the several states where, as we know, the real work of governmentin’ gets done and where the deputy walks on hard nails and the preacher rides a mount.\n\nWe begin in Wyoming, which our friends at the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists have been studying because it has become the Rocky Mountain equivalent of an offshore corporate haven, where hundreds of phantom corporations are based. And in the latest installment of the Wyoming saga, the ICIJ reports that millions of dollars from the Paycheck Protection Act may have disappeared in that maze of corporate sleight of hand during the course of the pandemic.\n\nIn the spring of 2020, in an attempt to avert an economic collapse amid COVID-19 shutdowns, the U.S. government began dispensing billions of dollars in emergency loans to American businesses to maintain their payrolls. Among the millions that received the Paycheck Protection Program funds was a Wyoming-registered firm called the Alo Group*, which received $531,562 to support the wages of 36 U.S.-based employees the firm said it had, according to public records.\n\nBut it’s unclear whether the Alo Group was a legitimate business. The firm has no public profile, and on a state corporate filing it listed a disposable email address—vayapef199@homapin.com—at a domain name that has been used by scammers, according to the fraud detection firm IPQS. After it received the large COVID relief payment, the Alo Group switched its listed mailing address to a building in China, according to corporate records, before dissolving completely for failing to file required state paperwork.\n\nThe Alo Group traces its origin to a single-story storefront in Sheridan that is a hotspot in the state’s thriving corporate formation industry. The small building is home to the Sheridan office of Registered Agents Inc., a national corporate services firm; more than 266,000 companies incorporated using the address of this modest office between 2019 and 2024, according to an International Consortium of Investigative Journalists analysis of information provided by the data firm OpenCorporates.\n\n[Editor’s note: *No relation to Alo Yoga]\n\nAccording to the ICIJ, this storefront in Sheridan, Wyoming, was, on paper anyway, busier than 55 Water Street in New York City.\n\nCompanies registered at the Sheridan storefront are listed in a half-dozen criminal indictments of people across the country who allegedly stole millions in COVID relief payments from the federal government, according to an ICIJ analysis. Hundreds more companies that together received tens of millions of dollars in Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loans share the same Sheridan address: 30 N. Gould St. Some of these appear to be legitimate firms, but dozens, like the Alo Group, have little trace of aboveboard business.\n\nAnd Wyoming is in the middle of an economic boom of corporate malfeasance.\n\nThe fraud indictments add to growing evidence that Wyoming is a major new destination for people outside the state—including criminals, suspected North Korean sanctions evaders, and those with wealth of dubious origin—to incorporate secretive limited liability companies, or LLCs, and other entities to hold and move cash. In December, ICIJ reporting showed that the state had overtaken Delaware in its rising per capita number of incorporations, leaving officials in the least populated U.S. state grappling with how to oversee a proliferation of anonymous shell companies.\n\nDelaware dethroned!\n\nTara Berg, the county assessor for Wyoming’s Fremont County, told ICIJ that over the past several years residents have begun complaining about shell companies that, in an apparent attempt to appear legitimate, have falsely used the residents’ home addresses on corporate filings. “We have people bringing us stacks of mail that they’re getting for these companies at their addresses,” Berg said. “People are panicked.”\n\nA single storefront at 30 N. Gould Street in Sheridan is the alleged home of 40 percent of the new incorporations registered in Wyoming in the past five years. And some of them are real prizes.\n\nSuch cases include that of Andrew Marnell, who pleaded guilty to bank fraud and money laundering and was sentenced in 2023 in a Los Angeles federal court for using shell companies to obtain nearly $9 million in PPP loans for hundreds of fictitious employees. Marnell spent the proceeds on, among other items, Rolex watches, a Range Rover, and a Ducati motorcycle, according to federal prosecutors. One of the key firms in his scheme, Slatestone LLC, was registered at 30 N. Gould St. and received more than $1.3 million to support 75 people the firm claimed to employ, according to prosecutors.\n\nAccording to a 2024 indictment and corporate records, a Florida-based man named Jared Dean Eakes established an array of shell companies—all registered at 30 N. Gould St.—that took in $4.8 million in fraudulent loans from the federal government. Eakes, a former Merrill Lynch financial adviser and broker, also allegedly used companies registered at the address to steal more than $2 million from people who transferred him funds believing he was a private wealth manager, according to the indictment. Eakes pleaded not guilty to the charges and the case is pending.\n\nIn August 2024, Andre Shammas, in San Diego, pleaded guilty to helping to set up shell companies, including one registered at 30 N. Gould St., to defraud the government’s emergency relief program and obtain more than 40 PPP loans with a total value exceeding $5 million.\n\nSheridan, Wyoming—the Caymans of the northern Rockies. Aren’t business-friendly environments great?\n\nWe move along to North Carolina, where the state’s Republicans simply cannot stop themselves from playing monkey-mischief with the state’s reapportionment processes. From the NC Newsline:\n\nExperts say it would run afoul of the U.S. Constitution and long-established U.S. Supreme Court precedent, but that hasn’t deterred a group of Republican members of the state House from reintroducing an amendment to the state constitution that would dramatically alter how North Carolinians elect state senators. Under the proposal, each of the state’s 50 senators would represent two of the state’s 100 counties, rather than a roughly equal number of state residents, as is the case now. Rep. Jay Adams (R-Catawba), who is one of the measure’s chief sponsors, filed House Bill 234, which is entitled “Little Federal Model NC Edition,” on Feb. 26. Adams introduced the same proposal in 2023, but it died in committee.\n\nRep. Adams is nothing if not persistent, and he has a specific goal in mind.\n\nThe proposal would almost certainly have the effect of further expanding Republican dominance in the Senate—where it currently enjoys a 30–20 advantage—by allotting many more senators to conservative, rural areas. Wake and Mecklenburg counties, the homes of Raleigh and Charlotte, respectively, are the state’s most populous. They each have six senators representing portions of the counties in the 2025–2026 legislative session, according to the General Assembly’s website. Of these 12 lawmakers, only one is Republican: Rep. Vickie Sawyer, whose district covers part of Mecklenburg County and all of Iredell County.\n\nIf the proposed amendment were to become law, one senator would represent Wake and a neighboring county—the text declares districts must consist of “contiguous territory.” This means that instead of six Democratic lawmakers representing portions of Wake County, there would be only one, whose constituency would be comprised of North Carolina’s most populous county and an additional adjoining county.\n\nI don’t think the Republicans in North Carolina have any intention of letting an election be decided on the square ever again. Issues? What are those?\n\nAnd we conclude, as is our custom, in the great state of Oklahoma, whence Blog Official Portuguese Man of War Friedman of the Algarve brings us one small step short of faith healing. From Oklahoma Voice:\n\nHouse Bill 1224, authored by Rep. Kevin West, R-Moore, moved through the Health and Human Services Oversight Committee Monday with a 7–6 vote with bipartisan opposition. Around 30 health care providers from around the state gathered at the Capitol and filled the committee meeting to advocate against the bill. They said they were disappointed by the outcome of the vote. The legislation, which West said has been successful in a handful of states, could allow a physician, or an entire hospital, to choose not to offer procedures that conflict with personal beliefs. This excludes emergency care, although the bill does not define the parameters that create that situation. No specific procedures or types of care are outlined in the bill, meaning a health care provider, institution or payor could choose to stop offering STD testing, blood transfusions or elective procedures.\n\nNaturally, because you want as much ambiguity as possible while you’re bleeding out on the floor of the ER.\n\nThis is your democracy, America. Cherish it.",

        "title": "Chuck Schumer Just Shredded His Own Credibility",
        "source": "https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/",
        "content": "Chuck Schumer is done like dinner. His announcement on Thursday that he is surrendering to the House’s stopgap vivisection of what vital programs still have survived this administration’s bloodletting shreds what’s left of his credibility as a leader in the Senate and as a national leader in the Democratic party. It doesn’t matter whether he can muster enough votes to stay minority leader—and given what he did on Thursday, he’s likely to be the leader of a Democratic Senate minority for a long time—it no longer matters. As the months go on, and as the president and his ketamine-fueled button man continue their assault on the federal government, now with the complicity of both houses of Congress, Schumer is going to look increasingly silly and irrelevant. Absent an outright mutiny on the Senate floor, that complicity will gain his party ... nothing.\n\nSchumer certainly orchestrated his surrender well—a speech to the Senate, a press conference, and an op-ed in The New York Times. He never can say he wasn’t allowed to make his case. From Politico:\n\nHis points were two-fold: First, a shutdown would play into Trump and Musk’s hands, he argued, allowing them to continue with their slash-and-burn campaign overdrive. His second argument was more political—and in keeping with his long history as a leading strategist counseling his party to pay heed to the concerns of America’s middle class above all else. “For Donald Trump, a shutdown would be a gift,” Schumer said. “It would be the best distraction he could ask for from his awful agenda.\n\n“Right now, Donald Trump owns the chaos in the government. He owns the chaos in the stock market,” he added. “In a shutdown, we would be busy fighting with Republicans over which agencies to reopen, which to keep closed, instead of debating the damage Donald Trump’s agenda is causing the American people.”\n\nThe obvious rejoinder is to point out that, for all practical purposes, the administration is shutting down the government anyway, and that by walking away from the fight and giving away what little leverage he has, Schumer has foreclosed any real political opportunity that might have presented itself by making the president “own” the chaos in government. Quite simply, Schumer now “owns” a part of the chaos going forward. The only question is how many Democrats want to partner with him in this new acquisition.\n\nA substantial portion of the Democratic caucus in the House feels hosed. They unanimously lined up against the plan—unafraid of the perils that so spooked Schumer about a shutdown. I think the Democratic members of the House recognized the obvious—that there is no palpable political advantage to be gained in helping the current administration. And if the most recent Quinnipiac poll is to be believed, 53 percent of respondents already blamed the Republicans for any shutdown before Schumer hit the silk. This is because those people looked at what the Republicans already were doing.\n\nMoreover, Schumer’s unilateral surrender completely ignores the fact that the administration is being rendered into sticks and splinters every time it finds itself in front of a federal court. Most recently, we had federal district judge William Alsup’s almost unprecedented ass-kicking in which he angrily ruled that thousands of laid-off federal workers be offered their old jobs back forthwith. From Politico:\n\nAlsup issued his ruling in a lawsuit brought by federal employee unions. He lashed out at the Justice Department over its handling of the case, saying he believes that Trump administration lawyers were hiding the facts about who directed the mass firings. “You will not bring the people in here to be cross-examined. You’re afraid to do so because you know cross examination would reveal the truth,” the judge said to a DOJ attorney during a hearing Thursday. “I tend to doubt that you’re telling me the truth. … I’m tired of seeing you stonewall on trying to get at the truth. ... It is sad, a sad day when our government would fire some good employee and say it was based on performance when they know good and well that’s a lie,” Alsup said.\n\nAnother federal district judge, this one in Maryland, ruled the same way on the same day. From The Washington Post:\n\n[James] Bredar, the judge, had signaled at a recent hearing he was likely to agree, noting to a Justice Department attorney that the case was not about whether the government can terminate people, but if those terminations were conducted legally. At one point, Bredar quoted the Silicon Valley mantra embraced by DOGE head Musk: “Move fast and break things.”\n\n\"Move fast? Fine,” Bredar said. “Break things? If that involves breaking the law, then that becomes problematic.”\n\nSchumer’s capitulation takes a lot of the political power out of how staunchly the federal courts have stood against the onslaught of the MAGA crew. Sooner or later, the administration is going to act in obvious contempt of court and, possibly, that will go up to the Supreme Court, which would have the opportunity to revisit its horrendous presidential-immunity decision from last July. This is only one of the righteous fights on which Chuck Schumer now has taken a pass. It’s time for someone to buy him a gold watch, thank him for his service, and shuffle him off the stage. He is not a wartime consigliere.\n\nRelated Story EPA Chief Lee Zeldin Is on a Mission to Let the Polluters Pollute\n\n\n\n",

        "source": "https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/",
        "content": "As long as nobody calls it a cult or anything.\n\nOn Monday, two United States senators, Tommy Tuberville and J.D. Vance, took a pilgrimage to the Manhattan courthouse in which Michael Cohen was explaining to a jury everything he did while being paid by the former president* to be a schmuck to the entire outside world. By all accounts, Cohen was a model witness, though we should hold all tickets on that bet until we see how he does under cross-examination. Far more interesting were the two legislative acolytes who came to pay homage. It’s like the courthouse is now Fatima, with farts. From Politico:\n\nOn Monday, former Trump attorney Michael Cohen faced ridicule from Trump’s entourage visiting the courthouse, including GOP Sens. J.D. Vance of Ohio and Tommy Tuberville of Alabama, as the prosecution’s star witness had his first day on the stand. “This guy is a convicted felon who admitted in his testimony that he secretly recorded his former employer, that he only did it once allegedly, and that this was supposed to help Donald Trump,” Vance told reporters outside the courthouse. “Does any reasonable, sensible person believe anything that Michael Cohen says?”\n\n“We got a courtroom, this most depressing thing I’ve ever been in,” Tuberville said. “Mental anguish is trying to be pushed on the Republican candidate for the president of the United States.”\n\nAnd they weren’t alone. The senators were joined in their witness by Rep. Nicole Malliotakis, Republican of New York, as well as the attorneys general of Iowa and Alabama, who apparently have little to do these days. Taxpayers in those two states certainly got their money’s worth paying the salaries of these two clucks. Moreover, Tuesday promised even more pilgrims to the shrine. Vivek Ramaswamy, re-emerging from having his operating systems updated, promised to come and pay tribute, as did Speaker of the House of Representatives Mike Johnson.\n\nFor the benefit of those keeping score at home, Speaker Moses, who is a very good Christian man, is going to New York to support an unapologetic defendant in a criminal scheme that violated at least half the Ten Commandments. That should be a tinhorn tent revival of a type unseen since Jimmy Swaggart took to the podium and tearfully copped to doing missionary work in various motels in the neighborhood we like to call Out by the Airport. It is Politico’s analysis that these pilgrims are coming to court in order to meet the press and say all the stuff the defendant can’t say because Judge Juan Merchan may toss him in the hoosegow. How did these young journos ever get so cynical?",

        "content": "I get the feeling that the sooner that trial in the Manhattan courthouse goes to jury, the better for us all, because it seems to me that, here in the homestretch, the entire exercise is in danger of going to the zoo and never returning. Inside the courtroom, defense attorney Todd Blanche has led Michael Cohen through all the shenanigans in which he engaged on the former president*’s behalf in an attempt to delegitimize everything Cohen has done since flipping on his former boss, apparently in the belief that nobody outside the courthouse has ever a seen a legal drama in which somebody “turns state’s.”\n\n\n\nOutside, in a desperate attempt to keep the public’s interest, the TV coverage is starting to slide toward the notion that Blanche has been brilliant in his cross-examination of Cohen. Meanwhile, someone released a series of penis-shaped balloons with the names and faces of various Trump antagonists attached to them. In addition, Thursday’s emissaries from the cult’s Washington outpost included Reps. Lauren Boebert, Matt Gaetz, Andy Biggs, and Anna Paulina Luna in what can fairly be called the D-Team. At least nine of them were there and, as The Hill shrewdly pointed out, this completely banjaxed the GOP’s wafer-thin majority in the House.\n\nThe trip to New York comes on what was scheduled to be a busy day in particular for the House Oversight Committee and the House Judiciary Committee. Both had scheduled morning hearings for a top GOP priority: holding Attorney General Merrick Garland in contempt of Congress.\n\n\n\nA source confirmed to The Hill on Wednesday that the last-minute shift in the Oversight schedule was to allow the lawmakers to make the trip to New York. Trekking to Trump’s trial means Gaetz and Biggs will miss the Judiciary hearing on the matter, while Oversight members such as Boebert and Luna may be back for the hearing that has since been moved to 8 p.m. EDT. “Due to member schedule conflicts, the markup is now starting at a different time to accommodate members’ schedules,” a spokesperson for the House Oversight Committee told The Hill on Wednesday.\n\nAny late return could also complicate other matters for House Republicans. The chamber is voting at 4 p.m. on a bill to reverse Biden’s hold on certain transfers of arms to Israel. The White House has said Biden would veto the bill. A number of Democrats had signaled some support for the measure, but Democratic leaders are now whipping against it. As a result, heavy absences by Republicans could make it difficult for GOP leaders to get it across the finish line.\n\nNaturally, the business of governing the nation must give way to their obligation to go to New York to pay homage to their God-Emperor Schitzinpants. The difference between the members of Thursday’s congressional pilgrimage and the clutch of penis-shaped balloons that took flight not far from them isn’t vast.",

        "title": "Does Elon Musk Actually Know What a ‘Ponzi Scheme’ Is?",
        "source": "https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/",
        "content": "Hey, we may experience a historic first, thanks to the ineffable wisdom of the American people, the oldest of whom may well be facing the FO portion of their likely truncated golden years. From CNBC:\n\nSocial Security has never missed a benefit payment since the program first began sending individuals monthly benefits more than eight decades ago. But the recent actions at the U.S. Social Security Administration by Elon Musk’s so-called Department of Government Efficiency are putting monthly benefit checks for more than 72.5 million Americans at risk, former commissioner and former Maryland governor Martin O’Malley told CNBC.com. “Ultimately, you’re going to see the system collapse and an interruption of benefits,” O’Malley said. “I believe you will see that within the next 30 to 90 days.” Ahead of any interruption in benefits, “people should start saving now,” O’Malley said.\n\nEighty years, and not a single missed payment. Now that’s what I call an efficient government service. If I were running a fake Cabinet operation that allegedly dealt with government efficiency—and, I mean, it’s right there in the fake Cabinet organization’s name—I would point to Social Security as the beau ideal of a government program. Not one missed payment. Ever. Praised be FDR and blessed be his name.\n\nElon Musk has decided the whole system is “a Ponzi scheme.” This, again, is an old conservative talking point that heretofore has been considered largely debunked by the eight decades of success of the program. Plus, it radically misunderstands what a Ponzi scheme actually is. We here in the Commonwealth (God save it!) can explain, proud as we are of our boy from School Street in Boston who got himself famous.\n\nMusk and the DOGE and Pony Show have threatened Social Security’s perfect record in the traditional Republican fashion, except with an extra-volatile flamethrower. Used to be that the Republicans would try to kill a program by appointing someone opposed to the program’s fundamental mission to run it. (The Reagan people were very good at this—James Watt at Interior, Anne Gorsuch at EPA, etc.) This administration has gone several steps further down the line. It has created what is essentially a hit squad of postadolescents in cargo shorts to clear-cut the executive branch, firing enough people to whittle down any agency’s ability to do a proper job for its clients. Those clients then become frustrated and lose faith, first in the agency and then in the government. This is where the privatizers come in like real estate sharpies when property values get set up to go down. That’s how they’re going to come for Social Security, which works too well to survive, I guess.",

        "content": "Transcript\n\nHey, Vogue, it's Gabrielle Union\n\nand I'm gonna walk you through my everyday skincare routine\n\nand my fresh day's makeup look.\n\nFirst step, kick out the retainer.\n\n[retainer clicks]\n\nWhen you don't wear it regularly,\n\n[Gabrielle giggles]\n\ndon't tell my orthodontist.\n\nMe and my husband both have retainers.\n\nAnd every night, just like the scene in Bring It On,\n\nwe pop our retainers in and we pop ours out.\n\nThis is the U Beauty, it's the U Beauty,\n\nit's the U Beauty cleanser, which I love.\n\nAnd just in case, y'all thought I came in here\n\nwith some kind of little makeup situation on, I did not.\n\n[upbeat music]\n\nUh-oh, see,\n\nhomegirl didn't get all the makeup off last night.\n\nThis is Witch Hazel, which I use as my toner.\n\nI was very lucky,\n\n'cause I never really had crazy problem skin,\n\nnot until my hormones changed.\n\nAnd then, it was like, Is this acne?\n\nHow do you get acne as a fully grown-ass woman?\n\nBut I found a way.\n\nAnd I had to just start experimenting\n\nand so, I think I'm probably like you guys.\n\nYou try a bunch of different things,\n\nyou see what fits, what doesn't fit.\n\nMy next step is my PCA Skin pore refining exfoliator.\n\nWhen I lived in Miami,\n\nI was, ooh, I was like an oil slick like,\n\n[Gabrielle mouths sound]\n\nbut in California where it's dry heat,\n\nI've also gotten a little dry in my older age.\n\nSo, I have to switch up my routine based on where I'm at.\n\n[upbeat music]\n\nIf you see someone's skin that you like,\n\nwhat are you doing,\n\nlike tell me the products, tell me the routine.\n\nYeah and I hope that it works for you.\n\nAnd if it doesn't, it's like dating.\n\nYou just keep trying.\n\nMy aunt once said, she said it much more crass than this,\n\nBut men or women are like Kleenex.\n\nYou try one, you use it.\n\nOh look, another one's popped up in its place.\n\nJust keep trying.\n\nNext up is 111SKIN.\n\nThis is their retinol oil.\n\nI'm gonna do it like the TikTokers.\n\nThis is probably the cringe stuff\n\nthat my daughter Zaya is talking about.\n\nTrying to do like a little skin influencer thing.\n\nGet ready with me.\n\nSo, some people have very strong opinions\n\nabout retinol in the daytime, mainly because of the sun.\n\nFor me, it's kind of interchangeable,\n\nbecause I'm psycho about protection from the sun.\n\nThe Therabody face thing.\n\nAnd this is how you know it's mine,\n\nbecause that, something spilled in my luggage.\n\nAnd you can use the cold function,\n\nor you can use the heat function.\n\nI'm using cold because mama didn't sleep.\n\nAnd it stays cold.\n\nI used to just use like a little bowl of ice in the morning.\n\nYou know what?\n\nThe thing about ice is it melts.\n\nIt doesn't stay as cold as I would like.\n\nAnd in this case, yes, I am going inside to outside,\n\nbecause I'm trying to push that inflammation,\n\nthat swelling right on out.\n\nSo, I am a device sucker!\n\nI love a device.\n\nSo, sometimes, you gotta go to the Shani Darden.\n\nThis is when I need backup.\n\nMy whole face is vibrating.\n\nI met Shani when I was doing a little show,\n\ncalled L.A.'s Finest\n\nwith one of her best friends, Jessica Alba,\n\nJessica swears by Shani.\n\nAnd so, Shani's a homegirl now.\n\nIf I had a hero product, it's the resurfacing compound.\n\nI started using U Beauty in September,\n\nabout this much I use,\n\nI've never gotten more compliments on my face.\n\n[upbeat music]\n\nWell, I wish I was the one who got my husband into skincare.\n\nWe have the same amazing facialists.\n\nThe more he started doing work on TV\n\nand retired from the NBA,\n\nhe was like, Oh, I need to get into a routine.\n\nAnd he moved this beautiful chair\n\nthat was in our living room into his bathroom.\n\nBecause he really likes\n\nto luxuriate during his skincare routine.\n\nIt's quite cute.\n\nThis is the vitamin B brightening serum.\n\nUse exactly what the directions say,\n\nbecause I have a problem with that.\n\nIf it says like a dime size, girl,\n\nI'm going for a half a dollar.\n\nAnd with all the things I've used thus far,\n\nyou have to commit to sunscreen.\n\nBecause these products left without any protection\n\nfrom the sun will work against you.\n\nWe have the U Beauty, the return.\n\nThis right here helps to bring these girls back.\n\n[upbeat music]\n\nKaavia is obsessed with beauty, all things beauty.\n\nShe is the girliest girl ever.\n\nAnd she loves more makeup.\n\nShe's not really into like the skincare part of it.\n\nBut makeup?\n\nChild, she could do a beat.\n\nShe does eyes better than me.\n\nBut Zaya definitely has a skincare routine.\n\nI mean, but she's also,\n\nwhen you're walking the runways of Miu Miu,\n\nshe's gotten very much into skincare\n\nand the whole like having her own beauty routine.\n\nI don't know who else out there has a problem\n\nwith TikTok Shop.\n\nI can't stop myself.\n\nThe Babe Lash lash serum,\n\nthe new organic lash serum.\n\nAnd I use one on one eye and the other on this one.\n\nAnd I just wanna see which one is better.\n\n[upbeat music]\n\nSunscreen, I go 50 and it's Invisible Sunscreen Gel\n\nand it just disappears right into my face.\n\nHonestly, I didn't think black people needed to,\n\nI didn't think we needed to wear sunscreen.\n\nAnd that was a lie!\n\nBecause I used to think,\n\nOh my God!\n\nLook at all these freckles and moles.\n\nThey are so cute.\n\nAnd then, they started changing shape\n\nand I had to get them removed.\n\nMy girl Winnie Harlow came up\n\nwith this line called Cay Skin.\n\nThis is her lip balm, which I'm obsessed with.\n\nChocolate for the chocolate girls.\n\nBut I also discovered probably around 40\n\nwhen I was going through a lot of hormonal issues\n\nthat if I give up gluten, dairy, alcohol and caffeine,\n\nI was getting rid of a lot of inflammation\n\nand a lot of those perimenopausal challenges,\n\nhormonal challenges kind of disappeared the more I worked\n\non eliminating inflammation.\n\nSo, I'm just doing tinted moisturizer.\n\nToday, we're gonna go with the Laura Mercier slanted brush.\n\nI'm just gonna load her up like that.\n\n[upbeat music]\n\nThe beautiful thing\n\nabout more people getting into the beauty business,\n\nis that there's so many more options\n\nand there's so many more FUBU options, For Us, By Us.\n\nThere was a time though where I'd go to work\n\nand they wouldn't have the shade, child\n\nand I would look gray.\n\nSo, you start bringing your own makeup,\n\nyou start buying your own makeup.\n\nSo, now, you're paying for things\n\nthat you shouldn't have to pay for.\n\nAnd it's completely unfair and it still happens.\n\nAnd there was a time\n\nwhere there were only a few brown girls.\n\nThey're like, Be lucky girl!\n\nAnd I'm like, I don't wanna be the only one.\n\nI want there to be the range of black beauty.\n\nI want you to see the diaspora\n\non screen, behind the screens,\n\nin front of the camera, behind the camera.\n\nBut it's a fight, it's still a fight.\n\nConcealer next.\n\nI use Makeup by Mario, my honey Mario.\n\nI feel like I'm just gonna go with the darker one.\n\nAnd this is number 440.\n\n[upbeat music]\n\nI think, the first time I got my makeup done professionally,\n\nI had been discovered at Trudys dress shop.\n\nTrudys was known as the prom dress capital of the world.\n\nThis lady comes up and she's like,\n\nWould you ever consider being\n\nin our prom dress commercial?\n\nAnd so, when I was getting my makeup done,\n\nit was the same products\n\nthat you could get at any drugstore,\n\nbut it was the touch, it was the feeling like a star\n\nthat I really loved, I really did love it.\n\nI learned to do my own makeup\n\nwhen I started going to the teen clubs.\n\n[Gabrielle giggles]\n\nAnd I was like, I want a boyfriend.\n\nI don't know if you guys are familiar with Danessa Myricks\n\nand this is magic.\n\n[upbeat music]\n\nSee, it's giving me a little yellow,\n\nso, maybe, I will go back over it with a little Mario.\n\n[upbeat music]\n\nSo, my next thing is CHANEL.\n\nIt's a little blush.\n\nSo, sometimes, when you've pulled an all-nighter,\n\nyour eyes might not be as white as you'd like.\n\nAnd these LUMIFY, first of all,\n\nyou can see this is my real stuff,\n\nbecause there's not even a label.\n\nAnd it's just,\n\n[upbeat music]\n\ntake a breath.\n\n[Gabrielle breathes out]\n\nI wasn't meditating, you guys.\n\nI was just thinking about fun songs that I like.\n\nI personally only love songs if they came out before 1995.\n\nAnd that's mainly because I know the lyrics.\n\nSo, this morning, it was Dionne Warwick.\n\n♪ Do you know the way to San Jose ♪\n\n[Gabrielle mouths music]\n\nThis is the CHANEL like for a little extra,\n\n[Gabrielle mouths sound]\n\nyou know?\n\nCenter nose, what?\n\nSo, during the filming of Riff Raff,\n\nstarring the legend Jennifer Coolidge,\n\n[upbeat music]\n\nI play Sandy, she is Ed Harris' second wife\n\nand I was a second wife myself,\n\nis a little art imitating life.\n\nAnd this is my Mario, my Makeup by Mario liner.\n\nSo, she had like a really,\n\nit was pretty like a very nice, neutral,\n\nkind of like this, but with swollen eyes, you'll see it.\n\n[upbeat music]\n\nMy girl RiRi!\n\nAnd this is a Fenty classic\n\nand I literally have 51100 of these\n\nin every purse, every drawer.\n\nKaavia has taken several.\n\n[upbeat music]\n\n[Gabrielle mouths sounds]\n\nThey're glossy, they're luscious.\n\nI still want more lip glosses.\n\nSo, I'm not gonna be the friend that's like,\n\nRi, where's the album?\n\nI'm not asking, 'cause I'm like, More please.\n\nSo, this is Damone Roberts, the brow pencil.\n\nLuckily, Damone just did my eyebrows.\n\nSo, I don't really have to do much.\n\n[upbeat music]\n\nI had a thin brow, y'all.\n\nAnd I thought it like made me more,\n\nI don't know, sophisticated,\n\nbut it just made me look mean.\n\nI'm not really mean.\n\nI played a lot of mean girls, which is fun.\n\nBut I'm so my mother's child from Nebraska.\n\nI'm still trying to give my neighbors May Day gifts.\n\nAnd I don't know if that's just a Midwest thing.\n\nI have been anxious since I was 19.\n\nAnd at 19, I was sexually assaulted,\n\na story I've talked about many, many times.\n\nBut after that, I got PTSD.\n\nAnd a part of that is I just have extreme anxiety\n\nabout everything,\n\nwhich I have been working on for the last 25-plus years\n\nwith the same therapist with varying degrees of success.\n\nAs I've gotten older, it's gotten a little better.\n\nIt's a lifetime thing.\n\nAnd this is my Victoria Beckham.\n\nWhen I get really, really anxious,\n\nI talk to myself and I say,\n\nWhat's the worst that can happen?\n\nWhat is the absolute worst thing that can happen right now?\n\nIt's not gonna happen, you're okay.\n\nAnd if that doesn't work, it's the 10 deep breaths.\n\nDo they make me a little lightheaded?\n\nYes, they do, but the anxiety slowly dissipates.\n\n[upbeat music]\n\nI'm one of these people\n\nthat this feels like a surgical tool.\n\nWhen people come in, right, with, they come in like this,\n\nI definitely feel like you're gonna get my whole lash\n\nand people have.\n\nAgain, look at the mouth open.\n\n[upbeat music]\n\nHourglass, baby!\n\nIt's translucent tan.\n\n[upbeat music]\n\nMm-hmm [affirmative].\n\nAlso, I think I bought 57 of these,\n\n5711 of these from Costco.\n\nSecond to the last, Sakura.\n\nIt's so light, but like hmm,\n\nthat's a ranch [indistinct], like it's so good.\n\nThe last thing and this is my favorite,\n\nwell, one of my favorite products from my line,\n\nit's the Styling Glaze\n\nwhere I could have just done with my finger, but.\n\nI hope you guys enjoyed it.\n\nI hope you learned a little something more about me,\n\nthe products that I use.\n\nAnd I hope you have a great day.\n\nI will.",

use this,\n\nand I use it on this really cool questionable device.\n\nI've been asked a lot of questions\n\nby anyone who notices this,\n\nand you can use it to wash your face.\n\nLet's just keep it at that.\n\nIt vibrates, which is really fun.\n\n[light upbeat music]\n\nI've been using it for quite some time.\n\nI find it to be really effective in cleaning my face,\n\nand it feels good.\n\nI usually use this, OCuSOFT Lid Scrub,\n\nbecause I have dry eyes.\n\nYes, I do.\n\nIt really just, it seems counterintuitive,\n\nbut I just clean my eyes,\n\nand I guess it helps me not to have dry eyes.\n\nThe next thing that I use is Real Ferment Micro Essence.\n\nI just feel like it kind of like re-wets my skin.\n\nThis is something\n\nthat my sister-in-law told me about.\n\nI saw this like in her van\n\nwhen we were on like a surf trip,\n\nand I was like, What the hell is that?\n\nIt's snail mucin.\n\nAdam gets into the mucin.\n\nWe share, we're like a mucin family.\n\nI feel very moisturized right now.\n\nAnd then can you believe\n\nI have another serum that I put on?\n\nMoisture Boost Plumping Serum.\n\nI did get on the SPF train pretty early,\n\nwhich I'm glad about.\n\nI use these two things usually together.\n\nOne is tinted and one isn't.\n\nI mix it together, and it's kind of lighter.\n\n[light upbeat music]\n\nIf we're being honest,\n\nthat's like mostly what I just do most days.\n\nBut I'm just gonna bump it up a little bit\n\n'cause this is fun.\n\nThere's no reason why I'm doing this part.\n\nIt's fun, and they're sort of like getting prepped.\n\n[light upbeat music]\n\nIt is Kosas.\n\nWhen I was like late teens, early 20s,\n\nI got really like into\n\nmy little sitting on the floor in front of the mirror\n\nkind of makeup routine.\n\nI basically would do like five auditions in a day,\n\nand so there was just like a moment of meditation.\n\nI had like hot rollers\n\nand like a full like face of makeup,\n\nwhich over, you know, the last 20 years\n\nI've really just been like,\n\nI actually like how my skin looks without foundation on.\n\nI'm gonna do a little eye makeup.\n\nI'll just use what's ostensibly the lightest color in here.\n\nAnd I do that.\n\nYou just slap it on there,\n\nand I kind of rub in this little zone.\n\n[light upbeat music]\n\nThe glam stuff is like a really fun element\n\nwhen you get ready to go to an event.\n\nIt's like this really glamorous\n\naspect to the business that I enjoy.\n\nSpeaking of glam,\n\nthis one right here, this dark guy.\n\nI just kind of go a little bit closer,\n\nblend it a little bit, just a little bit.\n\nWow.\n\nTake a look at this cool eyeliner.\n\nIt all squished out.\n\nNot to fear, you use a little brush like this.\n\n[light upbeat music]\n\nIt's definitely like me time\n\ngetting your little skincare\n\nand even just, whatever, minimal makeup in.\n\nI just think this is so pretty,\n\nand I kind of just wanna like try it.\n\nI'm gonna make my eyes a little bit shinier.\n\nI like this kind of thing.\n\nThis is, I think, for bronzing...\n\nContouring.\n\n[light upbeat music]\n\nAnd I kind of put it here 'cause I see people do that.\n\n[Leighton laughs]\n\nWell, I should probably do this part.\n\n[light upbeat music]\n\nI like to try to just be nice to myself.\n\nIt's so basic, but it's very helpful for me\n\nnot to say negative words about myself.\n\nIt would be like in meetings or on set,\n\nI'd be like, This is a dumb idea, but whatever.\n\nOr, I'm sorry to ramble on, I'm sorry to rant.\n\nIt's more helpful generally for me\n\nto just say nice words to myself about myself.\n\nI just sort of instinctively\n\nstart absorbing that and believing it.\n\nOkay, mascara.\n\n[light upbeat music]\n\nMy kids, they get what we do.\n\nThey come on location a lot.\n\nI don't think that they're phased at all\n\nbecause they get a lot of us off set\n\nand a lot of us like not working,\n\nwhich has been always like a really big benefit\n\nfor both of us.\n\nNow, actually, I'm gonna use this like shiny thing.\n\nI have seen this little thing happen before,\n\nand I don't mind.\n\nI'm gonna do it.\n\nOkay, I'm gonna do this,\n\nwhich is like for your lips and cheeks.\n\nThis thing is real left field.\n\nYou won't believe that I'm using this, an essential balm.\n\nAnd it looks like this,\n\nand I feel like it kind of looks cool up here.\n\nIt just looks a little bit like, you know, dewy and wet.\n\nAnd then I guess this would be the right time\n\nto do this part.\n\nI have more blush, and it's this crazy,\n\nI mean, it's so bright,\n\nbut it's kind of subtle.\n\nI know that I try really hard to be all shiny,\n\nbut now I'm doing this matte powder thing.\n\nLip liners, to me,\n\nthey're just too concrete so much of the time\n\nwhere I'm like, I'm locked in,\n\nand this is what I'm gonna have to do and stick with.\n\nBut if I think if you just kind of like\n\njust do it a little bit and then kind of like smudge it.\n\nGroundbreaking, I know.\n\n[light upbeat music]\n\nSo I'll do this, this little guy.\n\nThis is new to me.\n\nI've had makeup artists do this.\n\nThis smells really good.\n\nThis was so very fun.\n\nThank you for watching.\n\nBye!

Just like with their cold-weather ensembles, their medley of scarce and candid paparazzi shots are stored, saved, and venerated to curate a well-rounded wardrobe. Not only do they show us the items we want to buy, but they also demonstrate to us how a strong sense of self can further amplify your personal style. Think of silhouettes, accessories, layering techniques, and textures that make you feel the most you.\n\nWe’re yearning for warm weather, and with spring on the horizon, there’s no better time to dive into our Olsen twin-style archive for outfit inspiration as emerge from our frozen cocoons.\n\nVogue’s Olsen Twin Style Guide:\n\nAs we set aside our wrap coats and heavy boots, we’re asking ourselves, “How would the Olsen twins prepare for the new season?” They would let proportion do the talking—with oversized cotton poplin blouses, languid trousers, and flouncy skirts. Instead of wearing a going-out blouse for the evening, they’d opt for a lightweight knit and a silky maxi skirt. Instead of boots, they’d both pull out an unexpected pair of crochet ballet flats that embody the essence of spring. The key? Start with the basics, and build on those essentials.\n\nAhead, the Olsen spring wardrobe starter pack featuring the pieces you’ll wear through the season, and after.",

        "content": "Transcript\n\nWhat's up, Vogue?\n\nI'm Doja Cat and we are performing at the Oscars today.\n\nAnd so I'm getting ready\n\nand I want you to watch and I'm nervous.\n\nA healthy amount of nervous.\n\nLet's go, come on.\n\nIt is 12:15 in the afternoon.\n\nShe needs to be ready by 3:00 PM for the carpet.\n\nThe dress is not here yet,\n\nbut I have all faith within Hollywood traffic\n\nand Oscars madness that it will be here.\n\nWe did our final fitting last night.\n\nIt is an insane piece of couture that Balmain did.\n\nShe looks like Betty Boop.\n\nIt's really crazy.\n\nWith Amala, who's like my sister,\n\nbut then being Doja Cat\n\nand showing up in leopard print,\n\nI don't know if anyone else\n\ncan really pull that off beyond her.\n\nSo I'm performing Diamonds Are Forever by Sherry Bassey.\n\nI wanted to respect the original sound\n\nbeing it's from like the 70s\n\nand so I wanted to channel her\n\nbut also give just like a essence of myself within it.\n\nI love doing things that are not usual to me.\n\nI'm learning how to talk as a singer.\n\nAnd so I'm trying to split the difference between\n\nbeing raspy and myself\n\nand also being like this,\n\njust giving them a little bit of warmth and tone.\n\nIt's protective towards the voice,\n\nbut without also, see, there's two different...\n\nIt's like I'm trying to find the middle ground of that.\n\nAnd I feel like that voice comes with a character.\n\nMy vocal coach did suggest that I speak in a dopey tone,\n\nso I didn't wanna scare you when he walked in\n\nand start talking like this.\n\nSo the dresses for today have arrived.\n\nBalmain has done two amazing custom looks for us.\n\nThe leopard print is where we're going for carpet.\n\nIt's an insane moment.\n\nThis is all hand beaded from top to bottom.\n\nI know there was like 50 different artisans on it\n\nthat were stitching by hand all of these insane beads\n\nand our lovely tailor here in LA has been up all evening\n\nbeating the scarf for us to go around her neck.\n\nThey had this dress that was built I think in 1957\n\nthat this was inspired by, but Olivier did his spin on it\n\nand it has like the sweetheart neckline.\n\nIt's definitely corseted to the gods.\n\nBut yeah, it's just super special.\n\nAmala is moving into this new album cycle that there's a bit\n\nof an 80s essence.\n\nAnd so this is kind of bringing it to life,\n\nespecially with the glam.\n\nSo we were inspired by Mugatu, I'm just kidding.\n\nI love my natural hair and I love playing with it.\n\nI love like the shapes that it can take on.\n\nAnd so I really loved the idea of sweeping it upward.\n\nIt's kind of something that's been calling me\n\nfor the last couple of months.\n\nI'm just loving this kind of square top head shape.\n\nAnd so I wanted to bring it to this\n\n'cause I think the dress is so incredibly strong\n\nand to kind of keep the upper head area more top\n\nand more separate from the dress as opposed\n\nto long trusses hanging over the dress.\n\nI think it lets the dress stand out.\n\nI think right off the bat, you can kind of compare it a bit\n\nto Grace Jones and the silhouette of it.\n\nI love that head shape, I love angular hair too.\n\nI think like it was something maybe more prominent\n\nin the 80s and I want to kind of play with that.\n\nI think that can be really fun\n\n'cause I can take my hair when it's not like this,\n\nbut like in the morning,\n\nI can just go like that and it stays like that.\n\nI go like this, it stays like that.\n\nIf I sweep it back, it's like very malleable\n\nand why not take advantage?\n\nSo I have conversations with him for the most part\n\nbecause hair is like hair.\n\nIt's a very defining characteristic of the body.\n\nMakeup is depending on where you are creatively.\n\nI think for this, me and Ivan\n\njust wanted to be very like, elegant, sexy,\n\nand not anything too experimental.\n\nI think a lot of the energy is coming from the dress\n\nand the silhouette.\n\nWith the gold dress,\n\nOlivier did a blue version of it\n\nthat was a long sleeved a couple collections ago,\n\nand I fell in love with it when I saw it then.\n\nBut when this opportunity came up for Oscars,\n\nit's a really special moment for her.\n\nThis being her first time going to Oscars,\n\nlooking like a female version\n\nof the Oscar made me quite excited.\n\nSo this is what she's wearing after the show.\n\nIt's, again, an insane amount of bead work\n\nthat there was multiple people in the 40s\n\nis what I remember hand beading this.\n\nAnd then at the bottom,\n\nthere's a fringe, there's a fabric fringe,\n\nand then there's a beaded fringe.\n\nSo when she moves,\n\nthere's a lot of beautiful movement to it.\n\nWe have some very amazing pieces from Messika\n\nand this necklace has not been worn yet\n\nand it's super special.\n\nIt's like, I don't wanna say how many carats it is,\n\nbut it's a canary diamond and it's insane.\n\nIt's always experimenting in the end\n\nbecause we don't get jewelry kind of till the last second,\n\njust for insurance reasons.\n\nBut I want to try it with the dress.\n\nBut they did this really beautiful scarf\n\nthat just adds to that like classic elegance on the carpet\n\nthat feels like it's an accessory enough.\n\nBut yeah, we'll see.\n\nWhen we get to the dressing, we'll find out.\n\nAll right, Vogue, I'm done with makeup and hair\n\nand we are gonna move on to getting dressed.\n\nIt's really, really, really special.\n\nYou look incredibly stunning, I want to cry.\n\nI know that this is honoring Barbara Broccoli tonight.\n\nSo I mean, it's an honor for me really\n\nthat I get to do this.\n\nIt really is a classic\n\nand a perfect series of films\n\nthat I really am very grateful.\n\nShe's gonna be a Bond girl.\n\nI hope she enjoys it.\n\nOkay, he wants me to be a Bond girl.\n\nI'm down, but I don't know what that entails.\n\nBut yes, I hope they enjoy it.\n\nI hope everybody at the Bond Industries enjoys that.\n\n[upbeat music]\n\nThat's a wrap and I am going\n\nto go perform now for the Oscars.\n\nWish me luck and thanks again, Vogue, for everything.\n\n[bright music]",

ANGELA WEISS/Getty Images Givenchy fall 2025 Photo: Courtesy of Givenchy\n\nNot one day after Sarah Burton showed her inaugural collection for Givenchy, Blanchett appeared at the New York premiere of her film Black Bag wearing a look from the show: a black leather bomber and midi skirt with a cinched waist, double-zipper collar, and rounded shoulders. But Blanchett didn’t stop there. On Monday, she wore an eye-catching look from Haider Ackermann’s first collection for Tom Ford—less than a week after it first came down the catwalk. She opted for a dusty pink suit with a neon green blouse underneath, which she wore with oversized cat-eye sunglasses and black pumps.\n\nWhile the two looks were worlds apart, aesthetically speaking, they scratched the same sartorial itch. Both come from buzzy debut collections from designers with whom Blanchett has a rich history. (She attended the 2012 Met Gala with Burton, and watched her take her final bow at Alexander McQueen in 2023; In May, Blanchett wore a dress from Ackermann’s Jean Paul Gaultier couture collection to the Cannes premiere of The Apprentice.) And while the sloped shoulders of the black leather Givenchy were by all accounts the total opposite of the sharp-shouldered, candy-colored Tom Ford suit, both speak to a love of impeccable tailoring, be it hard or soft.\n\nIn New York. The Hapa Blonde Tom Ford fall 2025 Photo: Filippo Fior / Gorunway.com\n\nIf this week has proven anything, it’s that Cate Blanchett is a force of fashion, no matter what she’s wearing. (It doesn’t hurt if it’s fresh off the runway, though.) But the actor has a lifetime of outfits under her belt worth revisiting. Below, watch as Cate Blanchett revisits her life in looks.",

        "title": "The With Love, Meghan Reactions Prove What We Already Know: Meme Culture Has Become Too Powerful",
        "source": "https://www.vogue.com/",
        "content": "More troubling still is why these takedowns are so ubiquitous: There is, these days, a financial incentive to go viral. Once upon a time if someone spread gossip or lies to a tabloid, the upshot was pure personal satisfaction and maybe vengeance. (Even if they sold Page Six a photo, at least that photo was real.) But now, with the advent of things like creator funds for TikTok and Instagram—and the rise of influencing as a career more broadly—virality has financial stakes. And not all output is created equal either: Study after study shows that negative, divisive, or otherwise anger-stoking content is more likely to be shared…and therefore go viral.\n\nWhile society’s long-established appetite for tearing down powerful women certainly seems to be at play in the Meghan example, the craze around Saltburn back in 2023 helped me identify another endemic online behavior worth addressing. I like to avoid movie spoilers, but there was no escaping the onslaught of horrified reaction videos to that film, leading me to believe Saltburn would make The Talented Mr. Ripley look like a children’s movie. But when I finally watched the film for myself, I realized that these scenes—represented online as being too vile and depraved for words—just weren’t that bad, if they existed at all. Here, again, the memes had fairly little to do with the truth.\n\nA meme in its best, most harmless form spins a nugget of reality into a joke. But what’s increasingly happening is that people are getting clout from inventing a new “reality” altogether. More often than not these spins have one end goal: to dismiss or discredit someone or something. And the danger of being dismissive is cutting off another point of view.\n\nWhat ever happened to forming an opinion of your own? It might be true that Meghan’s life is difficult to relate to, but my plea is for you to get there on your own and not based off a lifted clip. Watch the TV show, see the movie, listen to the podcast, decide how you feel about it, and then see what people are saying on TikTok. As Abraham Lincoln once said, “Don’t believe everything you read on the internet.”",

        "source": "https://www.vogue.com/",
        "content": "How did we get here? You have to go back to where most unusual beauty trends start: TikTok. There you’ll find video after video crediting model and controversial content creator Nara Smith with popularizing a purported natural solution for treating dry skin, eczema, and acne: beef tallow. A form of rendered beef fat, which is usually found around the organs of a cow, beef tallow is more commonly used in cooking. But now it’s making its way into some people’s skin routines.\n\n“[It] speaks to a growing desire for natural, minimalist skin care,” says Chris Tomassian, MD, board-certified dermatologist and founder of the Dermatology Collective, of the trend. “Many people seek alternatives to synthetic ingredients found in modern products.”\n\n“There’s a growing interest in traditional whole-ingredient skin care inspired by what our ancestors used before commercial skin care existed,” agrees celebrity esthetician and brand founder Sofie Pavitt. “People are gravitating toward ‘skinimalism’ and using pure, unprocessed ingredients like tallow.”\n\nBut as with any viral skin-care trend, one must ask: Is it doing anything beneficial for our skin?\n\nWhat is beef tallow supposed to do?\n\nAccording to Marisa Garshick, MD, FAAD, board-certified dermatologist at MDCS Dermatology, beef tallow is thought to help with dry skin and boost your natural radiance, thanks to its hydrating and anti-inflammatory properties. “Tallow is rich in omega fatty acids to help support the skin barrier. For this reason it can help moisturize and nourish the skin,” Dr. Garshick says. “Containing linoleic acid, tallow has anti-inflammatory properties to help reduce inflammation and soothe the skin. This is why it may be considered for those with eczema or psoriasis (though [this] hasn’t been tested in these patients).”\n\nBeef tallow also contains vitamins A, D, K, and E, which Pavitt says can nourish and protect the skin. It is an ingredient in balms, creams, soaps, and even SPF. Some consumers, like Smith, use pure beef tallow as the base of moisturizers.\n\nDoes beef tallow actually work?\n\nThe answer to this is a resounding no, experts told Vogue. Dr. Garshick explains that while beef tallow is rich in omega-3 fatty acids and essential nutrients that can be helpful to our skin’s overall health, further research is needed to determine its efficacy and, more importantly, safety. She adds that beef tallow is not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for use in skin care.",

The season saw plenty of our newer favorites like Alex Consani and Loli Bahia—and, of course, no season is complete without some cameos: Bella Hadid and Anok Yai emerged for Saint Laurent, while Naomi Campbell took her world-famous walk to Dsquared and Burberry. Sarah Paulson and Laura Harrier continued Miu Miu’s longstanding celebrity casting tradition, while Jason Isaacs and Richard E. Grant delighted us on the Burberry runway.\n\nBut there were plenty of exciting new faces to behold this season, too. Thirteen models stood out to us over the course of the fall 2025 circuit, hailing from all corners of the world—from Qingdao, China to Orlando, Florida. Quite a few from this freshman class have helped realize the new creative vision at Calvin Klein Collection, Givenchy, Tom Ford, and Dries Van Noten this season.\n\nEarly into their runway careers, these fresh-faced models already have some very impressive accomplishments under their belts: Libby Taverner opened Chloé while Claire Biegalski closed McQueen. Outside of fashion month, this crew is popping up in campaigns left and right: Karyna Maziar is the face of Versace’s spring 2025 campaign while Xiaohan Chen has been tapped as a new Miu Miu girl.\n\nBelow, get familiar with the 13 breakout models from the fall 2025 season—you’ll be seeing them a lot.",

        "source": "https://www.vogue.com/",
        "content": "The NFL star also admits it wasn’t his first time planning to propose—in fact, he’d wanted to do so during a family trip to Turks & Caicos last year, but their hectic schedules got in the way. “She was releasing her album at the time, and I didn’t want to give a hint that we had to go to Turks during her album release. I really wanted to come up with an idea and plan that would flow easily, and that’s what I did.” After revealing these long-gestating plans to Normani, she was even more surprised than before. “I was like, ‘Baby you knew for over a year?’” Normani says, laughing again. “I’m replaying everything, trying to see where he actually might have given me a hint, but I was just clueless. To get anything past me for over a year is crazy!”\n\nNormani and Metcalf’s three year relationship began in 2022, while public speculation began linking them as far back as June of that year, when they were spotted having dinner at the celebrity-favorite Italian restaurant Giorgio Baldi. A year later, in July 2023, they shared their relationship publicly for the first time via an Instagram post. It turns out, however, that their romantic connection was facilitated by their mutual friends Ciara and Russell Wilson. (Indeed, Metcalf shares that he made sure to run the engagement ring by Wilson for approval.) “Me and Ciara are really close, and Russell and DK were teammates on the Seattle Seahawks,” Normani shares. “About two years prior to us even meeting, they were playing music videos in the locker room and ‘Motivation’ ended up popping up on the screen. He was like, ‘The moment that I saw you come up on that screen, I said, ‘That's going to be my wife. That’s going to be my girlfriend one day.’’ I was in a relationship at the time, and then the chips just fell the way that they did.” Two years later, Ciara was throwing a party for her rum brand, and was adamant that Normani come, in what was an elaborate set-up. “I ended up going, and lo and behold, he ended up being there, and the rest is history.”\n\nFor Normani, walking down the aisle has been something she’s always dreamed about—and she’s already thinking about what she’ll wear to their big celebration. “I was definitely that little girl dreaming of what my wedding dress would look like, what my ring would look like, and what my dream proposal would look like,” says Normani. “But for me, the most important part is that God has just been there. He’s been faithful to both of us, and I have found my dream man. There’s nobody that I would want to spend the rest of my life with and do life with. He’s literally my best friend, and I’m just really grateful that we found each other.” Adds Metcalf, “I will say this: our relationship hasn’t always been easy, we’ve been through trials and tribulations. I want to commend her for sticking by me through all of it. She’s been resilient, I’ve been resilient, and over the past three years, it’s shown the love we have for each other. A big shout out to both of our families because they’ve been loving us, praying for us, and supporting us the whole time.”\n\nPhoto: Courtesy of Normani Photo: Courtesy of Normani\n\nSo is Normani already entering into wedding planning mode? “Oh, girl, I’m trying my best to just be present in this season,” says Normani, laughing. “We literally went from the proposal to—thank you, God—him being signed to the Pittsburgh Steelers, so it was two big really big days for both of us. This is the first moment that I’m really getting the opportunity to just reflect and process everything.”",

        "content": "Transcript\n\nHello, Vogue.\n\nI'm Cate Blanchett, and this is My Life in Looks.\n\n[upbeat jazzy music]\n\nI'm a little nervous, but je ne regrette rien, right?\n\nOh, my giddy aunt.\n\nI think I'm wearing my mother's sweater,\n\nand it looks like my school shirt.\n\nI'm probably also wearing the underpants\n\nthat my mother made me.\n\nUntil about 10 years ago,\n\nI still had the underpants that my mother sewed.\n\nClearly not wearing any makeup.\n\nGod bless me, I look like I'm 12,\n\nbut this was at the Sydney Theater Critics Awards,\n\nand I won Best Newcomer.\n\nI was in a production of Oleanna,\n\nand then I loved it so much, I ran the company.\n\nI think I might've come straight from rehearsals.\n\nClearly, I didn't realize\n\nI was gonna be photographed or win.\n\nNext.\n\nOh, look, this is the very first time I went\n\nto the Academy Awards.\n\nI had done a shoot in Australia,\n\nand I'd fallen in love with this dress\n\nthat John Galliano had designed that was knitted,\n\nwhite knitted, and was embellished\n\nwith all of this amazing embroidery,\n\nand I met him in London\n\nand he said that he would design something for me,\n\nand he said, Let's change the color.\n\nAnd he sat down, it was like being on the couch,\n\nand he asked about my family and my marriage,\n\nand then he embellished, I think you can just see it\n\nat the bottom there, there's a little hummingbird,\n\nand there's two hummingbirds on the dress,\n\nand one was me, and one was my husband Andrew.\n\nso there's kind of a real beautiful story.\n\nI gave it to amfAR,\n\nso now someone else is wearing it, sadly. [laughs]\n\nBut anyway, I love that dress so much.\n\nOh, an A for effort.\n\nThis is me at the BAFTAs. I played Queen Elizabeth I.\n\nWhen we made the film, we actually thought,\n\nwe'll have to take the first off there,\n\nbecause maybe an audience would think\n\nthere was a sequel coming, that it was Elizabeth Part One,\n\nbut it was Elizabeth I, and I'm glad I'm wearing a slip.\n\nI mean, you just take the slip off,\n\nI guess you could wear that today.\n\nAm I an early adopter of that?\n\nNo, or am I holding something? I have got my glasses on.\n\nOh, this was a dress that Jean Paul Gaultier designed.\n\nMy father-in-law, who's no longer with us,\n\ncalled it an exit dress.\n\nHe said people don't think much when you come into the room,\n\nbut when you leave, they go, wow.\n\nThere was obviously a lot of jewelry Jean Paul Guttier\n\nhad put on the dress, but Cynthia Bach then provided\n\nall of the amazing pieces.\n\nI was playing a psychic in Savannah\n\nin a small film called The Gift with Sam Raimi,\n\nand I had never been to a psychic,\n\nand I got her to do a reading for me,\n\nand she made some predictions, wild predictions.\n\nI'd play a writer who had short hair\n\nwho died for what she believed in, Guavin Guevin.\n\nI played Veronica Guerin,\n\nand she said that I would wear a dress\n\nthat was gonna change my career, and then I wore that.\n\nI don't know if it's changed my career,\n\nbut I'm very pleased I wore it.\n\nOh, bless.\n\nNow, that is my own hair,\n\nand that's just me on a Sunday morning in the pond.\n\nNext, in a little-known film called Lord of the Rings,\n\nplaying Galadriel.\n\nI did have someone I deeply respect say to me,\n\nLook, they're making this weird film in New Zealand,\n\nand they want you to play an elf for three weeks.\n\nYou don't wanna do that, do you?\n\nYeah, I did.\n\nAfter the film was over, my husband,\n\nhe's fallen out of the habit,\n\nhe sort of does it to the children now,\n\nbut he used to drag me around by my ears.\n\nIt was playful, and so I told the guys at Weta\n\nwho did all of the prosthetics this,\n\nand they gave me, it was kind of creepy,\n\na chocolate box full of ear tips\n\nthat they'd made to look like chocolates,\n\nand then they bronzed my ears\n\nso I could give 'em to my husband.\n\nThat is me on the set of The Aviator,\n\nwhich Martin Scorsese directed.\n\nI think it's between takes.\n\nI was playing Catherine Hepburn.\n\nOne of the more daunting things I've ever done,\n\nbut when Scorsese asks you to do anything,\n\nI'd be a tree for him.\n\nThat was the first time I worked with the great Sandy Powell\n\non the costumes, and my relationship with costume designers,\n\nI've realized over time,\n\nis really pivotal to creating a character,\n\nand obviously, even before you utter a word,\n\nan audience is gonna start reading your character\n\nby what they wear and how they wear it,\n\nand something that Marty did,\n\nhe liberated me from having to do any imitation of Hepburn.\n\nHe played a lot of those early screwball comedies she did,\n\nand Bringing Up Baby was one of them, so I watched that.\n\nCatherine Hepburn is so raked thin,\n\nand then you don't plan for these things,\n\nand then the film got nominated, and I did,\n\nand so I had to do a lot of red carpets pregnant,\n\nand Donna Karan made me this amazing stretchy dress\n\nthat really celebrated the fact I was pregnant.\n\n[gasps] Oh, this is back in 2006 for Vogue.\n\nIt's a very memorable shoot.\n\nTonne Goodman styled it, and Steven Klein shot it.\n\nThe clothes were insane.\n\nI mean, this one was another Galliano.\n\nThe pose was really difficult to hold,\n\nand I learned so much about making a picture working\n\nwith Steven Klein and Tonne on this shoot.\n\nNext.\n\n[gasps] Oh, this was the first time I went to the Met Ball,\n\nand I went with Nicolas Ghesquiere\n\nwhen he was at Balenciaga.\n\nSo we just shot with Irving Penn that day,\n\nand Nicolas had done his take on an Elizabethian garment,\n\nand then we went straight from there,\n\nwe had to do a quick 360 and then show up to the Met Ball.\n\nThe theme was Poiret: King of Fashion.\n\nI mean, I just went to the exhibition\n\nand could have stayed there.\n\nIt's always so great.\n\nI mean, the room is really vibrant, of course,\n\nbut it's always important to remember the exhibition\n\nand the reason why you're there.\n\nOkay, next one. [gasps] There we go.\n\nHere is the photograph that Irving Penn took,\n\nand this was in Penn's studio.\n\nThe taking of the picture was incredibly quick,\n\nbut the sitting and preparing,\n\nit's like I've had the great fortune\n\nof being photographed by Penn and by Avedon.\n\nIt's all about their regard\n\nand knowing when to press the shadow,\n\nand so to be beheld by him was just unforgettable.\n\nThis was the second time I played Queen Elizabeth\n\nin Elizabeth: Golden Age.'\n\nThe costumes were designed by Alexandra Byrne.\n\nI mean, she referenced a lot of haute couture,\n\nand there were a lot of Balenciaga references,\n\nand she made one dress that was so enormous,\n\nI couldn't fit through the doorway of the cathedral\n\nthat we were shooting in. [laughs]\n\nHello, Bob.\n\nI've worked with the great Todd Haynes a couple of times,\n\nand I hope I get to do it a couple of times more.\n\nHe's so fantastic to work with.\n\nI had literally walked off the set\n\nof playing Queen Elizabeth\n\nin Queen Elizabeth: The Golden Age on a Friday, wrapped,\n\nand then had to be on set playing Bob Dylan\n\nin Montreal on Monday.\n\nTodd had divided Bob's persona, Bob, like I know him,\n\nDylan's persona into many different characters,\n\nand the late, great Heath Ledger was one of them,\n\nand Christian Bale. and I played this electric silhouette.\n\nI think he wanted a woman inside this period\n\nof Dylan's musical career.\n\nIt meant that there was a separation between\n\nhow iconic this period and this look of Dylan's was\n\nand the character playing,\n\n'cause you know there's a woman inside that,\n\nbut it was so liberating.\n\nI had fantastic eyebrows and sideburns.\n\nWas that the only time my husband hasn't wanted to kiss me?\n\nOh, this is from Carol, a Todd Haynes film.\n\nI played alongside the wonderful Rooney Mara,\n\nand that coat was a nightmare.\n\nSandy Powell did the costumes again, and once again,\n\nI mean, she can do an enormous,\n\nwe worked together on Cinderella with unbelievable costumes\n\nwith a much bigger budget,\n\nand then we had $2.50 to pull this one together,\n\nand she had two coats, and one was great and stable,\n\nand this one was like a little fragile creature\n\nthat kept falling apart, and I said,\n\nI'm really sorry, Sandy. I think it's that one.\n\nAnd she goes, I know, I knew you were gonna say that.\n\nSo Sandy, the great Sandy Powell,\n\nwas literally behind the car in between every take,\n\n'cause we had to get out, and it was really windy,\n\nand the coat would come apart,\n\nand so she was there in between takes sewing it up.\n\nI felt a responsibility for this for sure,\n\nbecause films like this, up to this point,\n\nweren't really made and certainly not made\n\nin the mainstream, and really,\n\nif anyone comes up to me in the supermarket,\n\nthis is the film that they talk about,\n\nand so it was really, really important to a lot of people.\n\n[gasps] Oh, this is Sarah Burton when she was at McQueen,\n\nand it was the most exquisite piece of embroidery.\n\nThe bottom, you can't really see there,\n\nbut it was all feathers.\n\nso I love that dress so much that then, during COVID,\n\nI presided over the jury in Venice, and there was no time.\n\nAll the ateliers were closed, so I said,\n\nCould I borrow that piece of embroidery again?\n\nAnd then I had a pair of pants and wore it,\n\nbecause I thought, when you have something\n\nso beautiful like that, it's a crime to wear it once.\n\nIt's even more beautiful in person.\n\nThe year I was nominated for Blue Jasmine\n\nat the Golden Globes,\n\nMr. Armani had designed this beautiful preve dress.\n\nIt was an impossible gown,\n\nand you didn't really see the back,\n\nbecause it goes right down to this plunging base.\n\nThe back is bare, and this beautiful lace,\n\nwhich has become quite signature,\n\nI was at on the jury in Cannes,\n\nand I wore it to the opening night,\n\nand I remember people saying to my publicist, [laughs]\n\nOkay, Kate's wearing the-\n\nShe's worn that dress before, as if I didn't know.\n\nOh, really?\n\nAnd I was so pleased to wear it again\n\nbecause I'd loved it so much.\n\n[gasps] Sarah Burton, there she is in Cannes.\n\nSarah made this beautiful, it was like a tuxedo,\n\nbut it was a dress, and had this massive bow on the back,\n\nand it was actually shown on the runway as a jacket,\n\nand she said, why don't I try and turn it into a dress?\n\nAnd so I love that, and I wore that again\n\nto Sarah's final show for McQueen.\n\nHere we are back at the Venice Film Festival,\n\nand this is a Schiaparelli flummery\n\nwhich I'd seen on the runway and absolutely loved\n\nand managed not to poke myself in the eye with it.\n\nThis was an example on Tar\n\nof the character coming to life, really.\n\nThe script by Todd Field was just,\n\nhe didn't change a syllable,\n\nit was so exquisitely wrought and written.\n\nIt was like, how do you make a female conductor look,\n\nsomeone who was in incredibly powerful\n\nand very, very aware of her presence?\n\nAnd so we went for this,\n\nI guess what has been termed quiet luxury look,\n\nreally great tailoring.\n\nI've had a couple of experiences in my life\n\nwhere I've just been so in sync with a director\n\nand a script, and you're lucky if you have one\n\nof those experiences in your life,\n\nbut I've had a handful of them, and I'm so grateful,\n\nand Tar was definitely one of them.\n\nMusic has come back into my life in a really major way,\n\nand that's because of this experience.\n\nHere we are. This is Armani Prive.\n\nThis is the dress that just keeps on giving,\n\nThat was from the current Prive collection, and I said,\n\nLook, I know there's this leftover lace from the dress\n\nthat I'd worn to the Globes all those years before,\n\nand they found an offcut,\n\nand so they made the internal corset out of that offcut.\n\nIt's felt great, and I've since worn it again\n\nwith the actual piece that goes underneath it,\n\nand I wanted to wear it with a T-shirt,\n\nbut Mr. Armani wouldn't let me.\n\nYou gotta respect the maestro, right?\n\n[gasps] Oh, hey. Well this is an oldie but a goodie.\n\nWith my first paycheck as an actor,\n\nI bought an Armani suit, and this is it,\n\nand I wear it wherever I can,\n\nand I think we were there in Milan for a Prive show.\n\nOkay.\n\nOh, well, this is at Cannes,\n\nand this is the incomparable Nicolas Ghesquiere.\n\nIt's a particular type of beading,\n\nso the dress is incredibly heavy,\n\nbut such is his mastery that he makes it look so light,\n\nand the shoulders are really big.\n\nIn the hands of someone else, could look really solid,\n\nbut then he's got that beautiful drape,\n\nbut yeah, I can't wait to wear this one again.\n\nIt's beautiful.\n\nThis is Brandon Maxwell.\n\nI'm going to Good Morning America.\n\nLooking so good. Did my own hair and makeup, right?\n\nHave that time in the morning.\n\nI love a Canadian tuxedo, double denim, triple denim,\n\nand this wasn't actually denim, it was more like a velvet,\n\nso it was really comfy and cozy.\n\nOh, once again, this is also for Borderlands,\n\nand I'm obsessed with this Swedish designer.\n\nShe's taken sustainable dressing to a whole new level\n\nand seamed this piece that was a dress all done in spoons.\n\nUnderneath this is kind of a cotton netting\n\ninto which she put the spoons on when you get dressed\n\nand it's backless, and then she put some spoons\n\nonto sort of a suit that I wore\n\nfor the Disclaimer premiere in Toronto for the festival.\n\nI mean, it was a crazy bonkers COVID film that I made.\n\nI really love the films of Jodorowsky,\n\nand there was one film of his\n\nwhere they were all in the desert,\n\nand the character has these incredible fingerless gloves.\n\nI thought it'd be good to have something on your hand\n\nin a close-up.\n\n[gasp] Oh, this is the 2024 Rumours premiere\n\nat the New York Film Festival,\n\nand I'd seen this, and I just thought it was hilarious.\n\nIt's Fiorucci, I think.\n\nI wear those leather pants every Wednesday.\n\nMy favorite pair of leather pants.\n\nYeah, it's a bit my Cousin Itt look.\n\nNot breathable, and don't go near me with a naked flame.\n\nThis is the thing,\n\nwhen you think about re-wearing something, you think,\n\nhow could I wear it?\n\nIt would kind of be cool as a skirt.\n\nBlack Bag.\n\nWorking again with Steven Soderbergh,\n\none of the most stylish filmmakers around,\n\nand Alan Mirojnick, who is one\n\nof the greatest costume designers, and I play a spy,\n\nand the only thing Steven said to me is, I want big hair.\n\nIt's a great film, and really fantastic cast.\n\n[upbeat jazzy music] [pen scratching]\n\nThanks, Vogue. That wasn't so painful after all.\n\n[upbeat jazzy music continues]",

That was fun.’” Judging by the lingering revelry that stretched late in the night, that mission was steadily accomplished.\n\nA mixture of the city’s cultural set across sectors showed out for the evening—from artists Lucien Smith and Lorenzo Amos, to fashion’s Lauren Santo Domingo, Talita von Fürstenberg, Sabine Getty, and Angelica Hicks.\n\nWith flourishes such as spherical, yellow-light lamps and a giraffe print sourced from artisans around the globe, the space exudes an eclectic warmth, balancing elegance with a touch of the unexpected.\n\nRed-jumpsuited servers carried silver trays of bites, including an alluring taste of what's to come at Obvio (expect fluke ceviche, tuna tartare tacos, a shrimp and uni flatbread, and more). DJs parsed out the energy of the room, building a crescendo of dance-forward classics and energetic bass as the crowd swayed under the golden glow of the evening.\n\nThe atmosphere lived on through the night as glasses clinked and the team mingled with their guests on the establishment’s first tour of fun—like a great melody or a well-told story, pulling partiers back for more.",

(I’m particularly obsessed with his entry about the 1974 film version of The Great Gatsby: “Shows the barrenness of greed and wealth.” Well, yes!)\n\nAt a time when King Charles III is insisting that he listens to Beyoncé, seeing what a famous person is watching and responding to, almost in real time, whether for fun or research, is just cool. Take Rachel Sennott on Ari Aster’s Beau Is Afraid: “Omg I think of myself as an anxious person but this movie made me feel French.” Funny! Or Hari Nef on White Chicks: “last night, i wept so violently that i vomited; my boyfriend held my hair back. then he was like, ‘should we watch white chicks?’ we did, and it made me feel better.” Sweet! (Though he’s not on Letterboxd—publicly, anyway—Steven Soderbergh’s riveting and chaotic “Seen; Read” lists scratch the same itch. Isn’t it nice to know how much he likes Hacks? And that he got really into Jaws lore last year?)\n\nEven if you’re too cynical to take advice from celebrities on what jeans to buy or what high-protein diet to follow, it’s nice to be able to let the stars guide you through the always-expanding constellation of Hollywood blockbusters and indie sleeper hits out there. Just make sure to move fast, because at this rate, Letterboxd is bound to become as cheugy as, well, the word “cheugy” before too long.",

        "content": "While foundation can cover imperfections and lend a hint of dewiness to dull skin, the best CC cream for mature skin provides color correction—and a host of other benefits—as well. “CC creams are great for mature skin,” says celebrity makeup artist Julianne Kaye, whose clients include 52-year-old Toni Collette and 65-year-old Emma Thompson. “They provide coverage, hydration, and anti-aging benefits.”\n\nVogue’s Favorite CC Creams for Mature Skin:\n\nIn This Article:\n\nIt’s worth considering CC creams as either a base for foundation or as a one-and-done product for light coverage and antioxidant protection in the morning (provided, of course, that the formula contains SPF.) As with any product choosing the right one for your beauty bag requires a bit of critical analysis.\n\n“It’s important to ask yourself what type of skin you have,” Kaye says. “Are you looking for oil-free or super hydrating? What kind of finish are you looking for? There are so many great options out there, but I would look for one that addresses all your needs.”\n\nHandpicked by celebrity makeup artists, the CC creams below represent the, ahem, crème de la crème for mature skin, offering even coverage, a boost in radiance, and plenty more.\n\nClinique Moisture Surge CC Cream\n\nWhy We Love It: Celebrity makeup artist Chelsea Roach says Clinique’s CC cream “packs a real punch with hydration—and as we all know, skin loses hydration as we age.” Formulated with squalane, glycerin, and activated aloe water, the oil-free cream is gentle on sensitive skin; it’s allergy-tested, noncomedogenic, and fragrance-free. “It is incredibly hydrating, but since it’s oil-free you won’t have that ‘greasy’ finish,” Roach notes.

        "content": "Le Sserafim is back to top off their trilogy—and all we have to say is that it’s super hot. The album, also coincidentally titled Hot, is the final chapter of their ambitious musical saga, following mini albums Easy and Crazy.\n\nThe girl group knows how to ride the pop machine’s momentous arc. Their subversively fierce and edgy sound and dance moves pushed at the boundaries of the K-pop sphere, and made them one of the earliest rookie K-Pop groups to perform at Coachella. It probably helps that three out of the five members (Chaewon, Sakura, and Yunjin) were contestants in Produce 48, Korea’s toughest music survival program, which has produced some of the country’s top idols. On TikTok, you’ll find hundreds of fans making dance videos to their songs or trying to recreate the girls’ makeup and hairstyles.\n\nBeyond music, the group’s influence even extends to fitness. The most recent TikTok trend sees fans follow Le Sserafim’s workout routine—a hundred jumping jacks and burpees set to their song “Crazy.”\n\nBut Hot is all about exploring a new, unfamiliar terrain for the group. Fans will know that in 2024, the group weathered some controversies with other groups, as well as lipsynching allegations after their Coachella performance. But “Ash”, of the album’s tracks, co-written by the group’s main lyricist Huh Yunjin, is about “burning yourself to be reborn from the ashes. I wrote the lyrics about the beauty found in the pain of that process.” This rebirth signals an era that’s all about rebellious music, jaw-dropping fashion, and even hotter dance moves.\n\nBelow, Le Sserafim and their stylist Hyesoo Kim give Vogue an inside look at the making of the “Hot” music video.",

However, when I heard Lindsay Lohan and Jamie Lee Curtis would be reprising their mother-daughter roles in a Freaky Friday reboot inventively titled…Freakier Friday, I knew immediately just how seated I would be for said film.\n\nWhile Freakier Friday isn’t out in theaters until August 8, we’ve officially been blessed with a trailer as of this Friday (shrewd release date on Disney’s part, IMO).

        "content": "Transcript\n\nHi, it's Simone Ashley\n\nand I'm gonna be showing you a little bit of my skincare\n\nand a very simple date night look.\n\nSo I'm just gonna clip my hair away.\n\nI like to use my La Mer cleansing gel.\n\nAs you can see, it's nearly finished.\n\nThat's because I love it so much\n\nand I used just a teeny tiny amount.\n\n[upbeat music]\n\nI never grew up doing much of a skincare routine.\n\nI always took care of my skin,\n\nbut everything I do, I really like to do it simply.\n\nOtherwise I feel like I'm like overloading my face\n\nand my skin with products.\n\nI had my first skin facial, like back in 2021\n\nand then I was, you know, transitioned to the dark side ll\n\nand I realized how great it is to take care of your skin.\n\nI was very naive and I thought\n\nbecause I have dark skin, I didn't need to use sunscreen,\n\nwhich I think a lot of women with dark skin might feel.\n\nDark skin needs some protection\n\njust as much as any other skin.\n\nI love to use an exfoliator on my face.\n\nThis one is Goldfaden.\n\nI dunno why I say McFaden. [laughs]\n\nIt's pretty empty 'cause I clearly use it a lot.\n\nI try not to exfoliate too much,\n\nmaybe like twice a week or something.\n\nAnd then I mainly go in around my nose\n\nand then I'm gonna go on my lips.\n\nOne day she's dry, one day she's oily.\n\nMuch like my personality. [laughs]\n\nI use body lotion on my face before I put my makeup on\n\njust 'cause it doesn't roll.\n\nYou know when you use certain moisturizers\n\nand they react to your makeup and then it starts rolling.\n\nAnd I usually do my makeup when I'm in a rush,\n\nso I haven't got time for that.\n\nSo I love to use La Roche-Posay. [laughs]\n\nThere's no other way of saying it, La Roche-Posay.\n\nBut in Simone's world it's La Roshay Posay. [laughs]\n\nThen I just like to put that all over my face.\n\nWhen I was a kid I used to use like hand lotion\n\nand now I've upgraded to slightly fancier body lotion.\n\nAnd then just to finish off, I'm gonna use a teeny tiny bit\n\nof sunscreen.\n\n[music continues]\n\nMy skin is prepped\n\nand ready to have some makeup on it.\n\nI kind of work backwards with my makeup.\n\nSo I'm actually gonna start with my lip gloss.\n\nI wanna see the vision\n\nas it's developing, if you know what I mean.\n\nSo I start with a little lip gloss.\n\nPlump Ambition [laughs] from L'Oreal.\n\nThat's my nickname. [laughs]\n\nLips are locked and getting loaded\n\n'cause we'll go back to them at the end.\n\nBut I can feel them like sizzling away\n\nand they're having a bit of a party.\n\nI am then gonna go in with my blush.\n\nI actually sometimes just use a little bit\n\nof the lipstick color that I'm gonna eventually use.\n\nI'm gonna go in with this Armani one.\n\nIt's called Lip Power.\n\nLittle bit, they can be friends.\n\nI actually realize I don't need to put as much on\n\nas I might think I do.\n\nYou know when you're in high school\n\nand you start experimenting\n\nand learning how to do your makeup,\n\nI always loved like a clumpy mascara and I still kind of do.\n\nSo my eyebrows are a little bit crazy.\n\nThey're kind of sparse.\n\nCan you see?\n\nThere's like little gaps in them, which is fine.\n\nI like to stain the skin just a little bit.\n\nAnd then I go in with another brow pencil and I fluff it up.\n\nMe and this eyebrow, we're not friends.\n\nThis one just, there we go.\n\nSo then I go in with my Anastasia eyebrow pencil\n\nin granite or dark brown.\n\n[music continues]\n\nEyebrows are now done.\n\nHappy with those.\n\nTea break.\n\nGirls with dark skin, color correcter changed my life.\n\nI had never really understood what it was\n\nuntil a few years ago.\n\nI get a lot of shadow around my mouth\n\nand color corrector just kind of balances out the shadow.\n\nI go in with my brush\n\nand then do a little bit here, a little bit there.\n\nI think when I was younger I was picking out color tones\n\nthat were maybe a lit a bit too light for me.\n\nAnd then I started just buying stuff, whatever worked\n\nfor me at work on set\n\nand I just stuck to that shade for a bit.\n\nAnd then maybe on another job I'd be like,\n\nOh, this one's actually better.\n\nI would just kind of follow what the pros are using.\n\nI've got a little friend over here, so we're just gonna\n\nask him to go away.\n\nMy first experience as an actor was for a kids show\n\nand they asked me if I was okay with my makeup\n\nand I was sat in the chair and they were like,\n\nOh, you happy with everything?\n\nAnd I was like, Me?\n\nLike, you're asking if I am okay with my makeup?\n\nAnd I wasn't used to, I just thought I was,\n\nI had to do what I was told.\n\nAnd they were like, No, it's your face.\n\nThen I really started watching\n\nhow people were doing my makeup\n\nand learn what I liked and what I didn't like.\n\nI'm gonna go in with a little bit of a tinted moisturizer.\n\nI like using this Urban Decay one in shade 70.\n\nNeeds some waking up.\n\nCome on, come on. [laughs]\n\nI've put a little bit, literally teeny tiny bit.\n\nThis is actually, I would say this is too much.\n\nI really don't like going out on a date\n\nor going out with my friends and the makeup\n\nlike over a few hours I start noticing it.\n\nI just wanna forget that I've even got makeup on my face.\n\nSo less is more for me.\n\n[music continues]\n\nAnd then this guy's really annoying me.\n\nMy forehead, I don't like,\n\nI don't put too much makeup on there,\n\n'cause that's where I'm prone to getting spots\n\nand unwanted visitors.\n\nI remember Sex Education kind of well,\n\nit feels like years ago.\n\nWe all auditioned for the same role\n\nand then they kind of workshopped characters around us.\n\nAnd that's when I suggested Olivia like had bubble gum\n\nand blue bubbles and stuff.\n\nAnd she wasn't really a mean girl,\n\nshe was just finding her way.\n\nAnd the more I rewatch watch the series, you realize\n\nthat she's just finding her identity still.\n\nI'm gonna go in with a little bit of concealer now.\n\nOh holy concealer.\n\nWhat would we do without you?\n\nFeeling tired?\n\nConcealer.\n\nGot a spot?\n\nConcealer.\n\nI use the shade Walnut.\n\nThis is my NARS concealer.\n\nJesse actually used this on me in Bridgerton\n\nand I never looked back.\n\n[music continues]\n\nBridgerton feels very transformative.\n\nI turn up at 5:00 AM in my pajamas\n\nand then hours later I step out looking like a viscountess,\n\nwhich is just amazing.\n\nI think the girls on Bridgerton really, we all go\n\nthrough such a transformation with the wigs and the makeup\n\nand the dresses.\n\nIt's such a dream.\n\nEvery season I fall in love with Kate's looks more and more.\n\nHer makeup looks are just so, they started off very plain.\n\nShe wasn't wearing much makeup.\n\nAnd then the softer she got, the more lashes were fluttering\n\nand the more color were on her cheeks.\n\nAnd a little bit of lip stick, lip color.\n\nI learnt so much from the makeup department on Bridgerton\n\nand I wish I could say it was my real hair, but it's not.\n\nIt's a wig.\n\nI can't say anything about this season.\n\nI would say as the characters progress, their makeup,\n\ntheir hair, their costumes, all progress with them.\n\nI'm gonna attempt a little bit of eye makeup.\n\nI would happily step out like this, with a bit of mascara,\n\nbut I'm gonna make an effort.\n\nI've got this Rare Beauty bronzing stick.\n\nI'm gonna just get my ring finger\n\nand dab it on my eyelids a little bit like that.\n\nAnd just put it on the lid.\n\nWe're gonna bring it down to the lash line there.\n\nMy mom didn't wear too much makeup.\n\nShe always wore like kohl eyeliner, very Indian.\n\nI'm just gonna get this guy\n\nand I'm just gonna go on like my waterline.\n\nToday I'm in a rush,\n\nso I'm just gonna use a crayon eyeliner,\n\nthe same one I used to stain my eyebrows.\n\nI want to just go in a tiny, tiny bit.\n\nI might be a little bit too smoky.\n\nSo we're just gonna go in with my brush.\n\nAnd then it has a little, it has a jacket. [laughs]\n\nI'm really excited for this year.\n\nI've got some very cool things going on.\n\nOne being the first movie I've ever produced.\n\nPicture This, which is my rom-com.\n\nSo I'm very tired. [laughs]\n\nI'm kidding.\n\nI had lots of creative control,\n\nwhich was really important for me\n\nbecause I grew up watching Bridget Jones\n\nand all the classic studio rom-coms back in the nineties.\n\nAnd I always wanted to be that girl.\n\nI never really saw anyone that looked like me.\n\nSo I was like, you know what, if we're gonna do this,\n\nlet's try and do it right.\n\nSo I had creative say on the character quite a lot,\n\non Pia's character and her background, which was super fun.\n\nAnd I was just really grateful that I could have,\n\nyou know, that the team at 42mp trusted me with that.\n\nI'm gonna use my mascara, which is my L'Oreal Paradise.\n\nNot just Paradise.\n\nIt's Paradise Big Deal. [laughs]\n\nAnd then I also have the F1 movie coming out this year.\n\nIt's produced by Louis Hamilton.\n\nI would say that's one of the dream movies\n\nthat I've ever been part of.\n\nThat was an incredible experience.\n\nI'm just gonna go in with this guy.\n\n[music continues]\n\nWhen I have downtime, when I'm not filming or in the studio\n\nor doing press, I'll go to the banya, which is\n\nlike a sauna and do ice baths and sweat it all out.\n\nI have such a tight knit of girlfriends\n\nand friends in my community in London\n\nand I just hang out with them really.\n\nAnd time with my dog.\n\nMy dog!\n\nLook, I've got this little necklace that has her face on it.\n\nI'm just gonna go in with a little bit of lip gloss.\n\nSo let's take the hair down.\n\nLet's give it a bit of a zhuzh.\n\nI think it's very minimal.\n\nI didn't use too much products on my skin,\n\nso I feel like I'm gonna last all night.\n\nThis was so much fun\n\nand I hope it was helpful for anyone who wants\n\nto learn how to do their makeup\n\nor any girls with skin similar to mine.\n\nWe're gonna put on some Whitney Houston\n\nor some George Michael and dance around\n\nwith an espresso martini.\n\nBye Vogue, thank you.

        "content": "It’s been a confusing few months for anyone obliged to write about Kate Middleton’s wardrobe for a living. First, there was a not-quite announcement, through a source quoted in The Times, that the Palace would no longer be issuing details on the Princess of Wales’s outfits. “She wants the focus to be on the really important issues, the people and the causes she is spotlighting,” the royal insider said. “There will always be an appreciation of what the Princess is wearing from some of the public and she gets that. But do we need to be officially always saying what she is wearing? No.” The story raised so many eyebrows that a Kensington Palace spokesperson felt the need to backtrack—taking responsibility for the comments before concluding, somewhat confusingly: “To be clear, there has been no change in our approach to sharing information about Her Royal Highness’s clothing.”\n\nRegardless of whether the Palace has changed its tack when it comes to fashion credits, Kate’s wardrobe has remained, as ever, prim, proper and predominantly Catherine Walker-led thus far in 2025 (although she has, on occasion, recycled noughties pieces, such as a Ralph Lauren jacket she first wore in Cheltenham back in 2007). For today’s Wales v England match in Cardiff, however, the Princess wore the polar opposite of a headline-generating look: a navy, military-style coat over a classic black turtleneck.",

Gabby Windey rounded out Traitors in an Ellie Misner gown with a sculptural, handprint bodice—but it was her loose waves and gradient glossy lip that had us gripped. Lady Gaga’s righthand woman and choreographer Parris Goebel went “Abracadabra” red for Club Mayhem, while newly engaged Normani kept her hair oil slick sleek. Jenna Ortega took a dip into the cherry cola hair trend, Le Sserafim’s Sakura Miyawaki showed off some perfectly piece-y bangs, and model Alva Claire went for corkscrew ringlets and a diamond-bright highlight.\n\nElsewhere, Simone Biles took a twist on a classic French manicure to the poolside, and Alexa Chung kept herself holed up in her hotel room to wind down with a wellness essential. “IT Girl” singer Jade gave us a lesson in a cutting smoky eye, and Cosima put her bleach blonde hair in springtime ready pigtails.\n\nScroll through the week’s best celebrity beauty looks, and head over to the Vogue app to vote for your favorites.",

        "title": "The Best Time to Eat Protein, According to Experts",
        "source": "https://www.vogue.com/",
        "content": "What is the best time to eat protein—and how much is too much? For nearly 28 years, I never gave my protein intake much thought. It was just another part of my meals—grilled chicken, a hamburger, salmon—eaten, enjoyed, and forgotten. That all changed when I started working out. Suddenly, I suddenly understood the gym bros: Protein wasn't just food but also the backbone of my workout, the holy grail of my muscle recovery, and an essential part of my fitness journey.\n\nProtein boosts metabolism, strengthens muscles, speeds up recovery, and prevents tissue and muscle breakdown—but here’s the catch: the time that you consume protein can be just as impactful as how much you consume. While there’s no one-size-fits-all rule, so being strategic about your intake can enhance results based on your fitness goals. Let the experts break it down.\n\nWhy protein?\n\n“Protein is a vital macronutrient made up of amino acids, which are the building blocks of muscles, tissues, and enzymes,” says Nicole Linhares Kedia, a sports nutritionist and integrative health coach. “It is crucial for muscle repair and growth, especially after an intense exercise. When you work out, muscle fibers undergo stress and tiny tears; protein helps to repair these fibers, promoting muscle strength and recovery.”\n\nBut it’s not just for those who hit the gym. Eshanka Wahi, a culinary nutritionist and holistic wellness coach, points out that protein plays a key role in regular biological functions, from immune response to enzyme activity and cell signaling. In short, whether you work out or not, protein is non-negotiable.\n\nWhen is the best time to eat protein?\n\nDepends on what your goal is:\n\nGain muscle and strength\n\nWhen to eat: Before and after workouts, ideally within 30 to 60 minutes post-exercise.\n\n“This ensures the body gets the essential amino acids needed for muscle repair and growth,” says Wahi.\n\nHow much: 1.6 to 2.4 grams of protein per kg of body weight post-workout.\n\nPrevent muscle loss\n\nWhen to eat: Throughout the day, especially in the morning and evening. “Frequent protein intake helps prevent muscle breakdown, especially during periods of caloric deficit, menopause, or aging,” explains Kedia.\n\nRakhee Jain, a certified nutritionist, emphasises the importance of complete protein sources like eggs, poultry, fish, seafood, dairy, and soy. “Avoid working out on an empty stomach and consume some protein 1.5 hours before exercise to prevent muscle loss.”",

        "source": "https://www.vogue.com/",
        "content": "Walton Ford is at it again, spellbinding us with the stories he tells through his bravura oversized watercolors, but this time he’s going about it in a very different way. Yes, like in his past, animals are present: Two ferocious-looking cheetahs star in each one of the four paintings here, but the cheetahs are there because they’re the pets of Luisa Casati, the eccentric and wealthy Milan-born marchesa who lived in the Palazzo Non Finito (now Palazzo de Leoni) in Venice before Peggy Guggenheim moved in. More importantly, it’s the first time he’s telling one of his fantastical tales through a woman. It’s also the first time his story is as much about the person as the animals.\n\nDodie Kazanjian: So tell me Walton, how did the two of you meet?\n\nWalton Ford: I recently did an installation in Venice during the last Biennale and ended up living in Venice for about a month. It was wonderful, obviously, and I went to the Peggy Guggenheim Museum, as one does, and they had the Jean Cocteau show, which I loved, but I became aware of the fact that before Peggy Guggenheim bought that Palazzo, the Palazzo de Leoni, the Marchesa Luisa Casati lived there. It used to be called the Palazzo Non Finito because it was never finished. It was meant to be many stories high, and they only got to the first floor. I guess they ran out of money in the 18th century, and it became a ruin and a problem for Venice. They didn't know what to do about it. So the Marchesa bought it and moved in.\n\nDK: How did you find out about her?\n\nWF: By seeing a wall text at the Guggenheim Foundation. Then, I had a show at the Morgan Library, and simultaneously they had a show about the Ballet Russes. And Marchesa Casati used to commission Léon Bakst, who designed costumes and sets for the Ballet Russe, to design costumes for her because she would throw these magnificent, hugely expensive masked balls in Venice that were the social event of the season. We're talking around 1913, right before the First World War, and they had a book in the Morgan Library bookshop about the Marchesa Casati because she was in one or two images in the show about the Ballet Russes—and because she was a patron of the arts and she would spend millions of dollars of pre-First World War money on her parties. She was wild in the way she entertained. Anyway, I saw this book about her called Infinite Variety. When I started flipping through it and saw a picture of her with her pet cheetah...",

        "source": "https://www.vogue.com/",
        "content": "Throughout the film, Moretti’s wardrobe only gets more over-the-top. When he performs for the group of journalists at his compound, he is seen wearing a custom futuristic look by threeASFOUR, including a golden shielded hood that seems from outer space. “It looked like armor, but it's actually more of a vinyl, so it was more bendable and he could move around,” says Kurata. Taking such practical considerations into account was also true for his climactic finale look. Without ruining the ending, there is a scene where Moretti’s draped white ensemble catches fire; Kurata had to find a design and fabric that would offer the right amount of flammability. “Silks burn too fast, so we used a cotton-velvet,” she says. “We tested a bunch of different fabrics with the pyro guy.”\n\nPhoto: Courtesy of A24\n\nBut Kurata did not only have one fabulous main character to dress: There were also 200 cult members to outfit. The costume designer zeroed in on giving the spooky followers matching looks that were all about rigid uniformity—all designed in varying shades of indigo. “It wasn’t too representative of a specific existing cult,” says Kurata of the costumes. “There’s also an art to indigo dying—the Japanese take it really seriously—and we thought that's something that the cult would be into. We hired a dyer that was working hours and hours just dying things—mostly secondhand or thrifted items.”\n\nThere was also the question of giving the imperiled journalists, influencers, and TV hosts at the compound unique personalities with their clothes. For Edebiri’s character, for instance, Kurata favored a smart and preppy look. (When we first meet her, she is wearing a colorful Bode sweater vest.) “We were going for a Black Ivy look, says the costume designer. For the talk show host character portrayed by Lewis, Kurata leaned into a more flashy—and admittedly “trashy”—aesthetic, including a red sequin Rodarte dress. While their fates in the film shall remain a secret, one thing is for sure: They all looked damn good while screaming for their lives.",

        "content": "Celebrity engagement rings are both an object of affection for the famous wearer and an object of fascination for the general public. Not only do they show off the celebrity’s personal style (take Meghan Fox’s two-stone emerald and diamond ring from Machine Gun Kelly) but they also give us an insight into high-profile love stories we’ve always wondered about.\n\nMeghan Markle’s ring from Prince Harry, for example, was made with stones from Princess Diana’s private collection, whereas George Clooney made sure he had an ethically sourced diamond for his human rights lawyer fiancée Amal Alamuddin. Then there’s the fact that, due to the significant wealth of the couples involved, the rings are typically, well, huge. Though technically a gift rather than an engagement ring, who can forget Elizabeth Taylor’s 33-carat diamond from Richard Burton? Or Jennifer Lopez’s 8.5-carat green diamond from Ben Affleck?\n\nBelow, ring inspiration galore from some of the dazzling gems sported by stars, royalty, and socialites. While their marriages don't always last, these celebrity engagement rings prove that at least a diamond is forever.\n\nNormani",

Even if that means diving back into the aesthetics of a long maligned British subculture.\n\nThe actor stepped out for the premiere of her latest film On Swift Horses at SXSW conference in Austin, Texas, wearing fresh-off-the-runway Gucci. She wore a plunging, lace fluro-green bodysuit with a skinny, Gucci-stamped belt, a shiny pale green pearlescent pencil skirt, and patent black pumps. Jones, styled by Dani Michelle, swapped out the necklace worn on the runway for another heavy gold chain from the collection. She wore her enviable bangs swept into curtains, and a pale pink manicure.\n\nPhoto: Getty Images\n\nThe look comes straight from Gucci’s Fall 2025 show, an interim collection following Sabato De Sarno’s surprise exit last month.

        "content": "Transcript\n\nWelcome to Vanity Fair Oscar Party live. This is the hottest party of the year and the\n\none place where anything can happen. Hello everybody. I'm Tan France and I'm so excited to be back\n\nhere live at Vanity Fair's legendary Oscar bash, here in the heart of Beverly Hills.\n\nThe stars are pouring in to celebrate Hollywood's most iconic night as a designer. You know, I'm all about the fashion, and we\n\nalready have had the most amazing looks. There have been so many incredible ones. There's already, uh, Kelly Rowland on the red\n\ncarpet. Looks incredible. We've had Sarah Paulson, who gave us the most\n\nincredible moment. Selma Blair looked magical. Old Hollywood.\n\nUm. Oh, gosh. Who do we have here?\n\nLooking like a vision in gold. But let's kick things off. Let's really get things going with the\n\nwonderful Ben Stiller and his wife, Christine. Hi, Ben.\n\nGood to see you. Hi, Christine. Good to see you.\n\nHi. You lot. How are you?\n\nI'm so. well, I would love to really focus on you and I promise I'm going to come back.\n\nBut your wife, Christine, you look like a knockout.\n\nThank you so much. Do you get a temp check from Ben before you head out of the house?\n\nI do, you do? I feel like he's my biggest fan. Oh, I know.\n\nI mean, this is. Yeah. This was very special, though.\n\nWould you tell her if you were like, honey, I don't know. No, no no, no, I'd say that's the\n\nright answer. That is the right answer. That is the right answer.\n\nNow, can I gush real quick about severance? Oh. Thank you.\n\nNo thank you. I was obsessed with season one. I saw Adam last year, and I'm sure you get\n\nthis reaction a lot at the end of the season. One, I literally stood up from my sofa and held the TV because I couldn't believe that\n\nthat's the way you ended it. Um, the installation you did for the launch of season two was wild.\n\nGrand central station? Yes. Yeah.\n\nUm, can you tell me what the response has been from the audience for season two? It's been so exciting because we were off the\n\nair for three years, as you know. Yeah. And we had a really strong sort of almost\n\nlike a cult audience. I think for the first season, people who were so into it.\n\nBut it wasn't, I don't think, huge numbers. And then the second season, we were offered three years and we came back and somehow a\n\nlot of people discovered us, and we're really happy about that.\n\nI don't know if you know this, Ben, I think. Have you been to England much? Do you know what a tenner is?\n\nWhen I say a tenner, it means 10 pounds. Okay. You might owe me a tenner or 20.\n\nBecause I am the reason that so many people tuned in for season two. I have told everyone I know.\n\nThank you everyone, and I've said it a thousand times over. It's one of the greatest shows I've ever seen\n\nin my entire life. I loved it so much. Thank you everybody who works on the show.\n\nWe have such an amazing team of people making the show so incredible, incredible, um, I did this might be a little controversial, but I'm\n\ngoing to go here. You're one for clapping back on social.\n\nMhm. Um. Oh yeah.\n\nUh, which is really surprising. Yeah. Was it just a night I find it fun.\n\nWas it just one night thing, or are you just like, you just want to comment on what you're seeing?\n\nIt depends. It just depends what mood I'm in. By the way, you're moving your hand.\n\nI'm like, you've got an opinion. I want to hear it. No, no.\n\nDo you tell him not to? I always say do not engage. Yeah, but sometimes you feel like engaging\n\nand you give it a shot. I get, but to be honest, it's hard not to engage.\n\nYeah. Okay, on that note, go engage with everyone behind me.\n\nEnjoy your night. You both look gorgeous. Thank you.\n\nLovely. Lovely to see you. Amazing.\n\nThank you so much. Thank you, thank you. Okay.\n\nWhen it comes to pop culture, no one has their finger on the pulse. Quite like Hannah Berner and Paige Desorbo,\n\naka the Giggly Squad, who are here to chat with the stars the only way they can. Hello, ladies.\n\nWhat's going on? Hello, tan. No, the giggly squad is here.\n\nWe are so scared right now. It's a lot of yelling, but the best people watching I've ever seen.\n\nAnd let's not make her wait anymore. Amy Poehler, can you come in away from us, Amy?\n\nGet right in the middle. Tom. Get in here!\n\nOkay. Stunning. Stunning.\n\nThank you. Thank you. So, since when are women in comedy just so\n\nbeautiful? Since 2025. Since 2025.\n\nSomething happened in the planets. No. Women have always been beautiful and funny.\n\nHave you ever done anything crazy to prepare for a night like this? Ooh.\n\nLike a salmon. Salmon like facial or something. Like a mucin situation?\n\nYeah. I wish I don't do. I don't think I do enough.\n\nEvery time I like, I, you know, I ate a croissant today, which is like, I don't do enough.\n\nYou wrapped yourself in velvet, and I love that. Thank you very much.\n\nI gorgeous. I had the trifecta tonight, which never happens where I liked how.\n\nI'm just going to say I like how I look, which never happens. You can say that Timothée Chalamet say I want\n\nto be one of the greatest. You're the greatest of how you look like the Michael Jordan of this party.\n\nYes. Um, and, um, and I liked how it looked. I had fun with my date, and my feet don't\n\nhurt though. That's it. It's only going downhill from here, Amy.\n\nWhen you go in there, what are you at a party like? Are you the wallflower?\n\nI cannot wait to leave. Yeah, yeah, I get that. I cannot wait to get in there so I can do a\n\nlap and then leave. I heard they have the best food, like at this party.\n\nI saw an In-N-Out truck. Fantastic. Yeah.\n\nNow, Amy, you've had some of the most viral moments in the world. Do you feel pressure?\n\nThe whole world, at least. America. Do you feel pressure to, like, outdo your\n\nviral moments, or have you just settled with the greatness that you already have? Thank you so much for saying that.\n\nI do think award shows are kind of funny, and they should be silly and people take them very seriously.\n\nAnd I, you know, it's a big night for a lot of people. I understand they work really hard, but I do\n\nlike it when people goof around. They work hard. But I think when people goof around, it's\n\nfun. So you're saying if you won an Oscar, you wouldn't cry?\n\nI mean, I feel like I feel like I would just disassociate so much. I'm not sure I would cry, but is that the\n\nprice that like you should want? I feel like you have to shed one tear. Even if it's a fake one.\n\nJust shed one. One just a single tear. When you're getting married, if the guy\n\ndoesn't cry. Immediate divorce, divorce I get. I have a lot of feelings about men that cry\n\nat weddings. It's very strange to me. We have time to talk about it.\n\nActually, when they saw we talk about it, they haven't told us to stop yet.\n\nNo. They said. They just said, wrap it up.\n\nThey said, wrap it up. Amy, you're the best. Thank you so much, Amy.\n\nYou look beautiful. We'll send it to Andy over there.\n\nHi, kids. Here's another star lighting up the red carpet.\n\nHe's right there in the screen. Hi, Andy. Look at him.\n\nOh, a corduroy look. He's right there. She's right there.\n\nWhere are you? Holy. Should we talk?\n\nDo you know what? This interview is over. It's these two chatting to each other.\n\nHi, Andy. Good to see you. How are you?\n\nHow are you? Very well. For those who don't know.\n\nLook, I would love to focus on Andy, but I discovered last year that he is married to an icon, Joanna Newsom.\n\nThat's right. I know she couldn't be with us here today. She's hiding away.\n\nShe is. She doesn't do interviews. That's okay.\n\nBut I would like to pretend that you're her tonight. Give me what you got.\n\nHow's life? How's it treating you? Um.\n\nYou've been to this party before. What's it like being married to Andy Samberg? Uh.\n\nOh, boy. I can't answer the last one. Uh, life is beautiful.\n\nOur life is full. Uh, there's music and love flowing out of our home.\n\nI did ask you off camera if she sings around the house and you said yes. Absolutely.\n\nDo you request it, or is she just voluntarily volunteers it? I never have to request it.\n\nGood. Also, it wouldn't matter if I did. Okay, good.\n\nIt happens when? When she wants it to happen. Dream.\n\nAbsolute dream. Um, can you talk about SNL 50? Oh, yeah.\n\nTell me about it. Stressful. Exciting.\n\nCan you believe it's 50? It was stressful for me because I worked on it a lot up until it was happening, and then\n\nit was absolute joy and so much fun and being there and watching it live and seeing so many incredible stars from the history of the show\n\ninteracting and doing comedy together and Paul McCartney performing and Lil Wayne and Paul Simon and like, it was kind of like\n\nrelentlessly incredible. It was very overwhelming. It was one of the most exciting moments in TV\n\nI've seen in a really long time. And the fact that you got to be a part of it is just mind blowing.\n\nIt was cool. I met Bonnie Raitt. All right, we're gonna end there.\n\nYeah. We can't beat that. Thank you so much.\n\nI'll see you at the party. Yeah. It's untoppable.\n\nIt is what it is. Thank you. Tan.\n\nWe're joined by the one and only Vanessa Hudgens. Hi.\n\nNo. Our Lord and savior. Literally.\n\nI'll take it. Have you had any moments yet with any celebs? Like in the bathroom or anything fun in the\n\nline? Have you have you crossed paths with anyone or are you like, pretty cool because you've\n\ndone this for a long time. I mean, I feel like I've been coming here for for a good minute of everyone.\n\nNo, you're definitely not sick of everyone. I feel like the last carpet I did was literally a year ago here.\n\nWow. So, wait, when you were to be back when you were preggers, I was popping.\n\nOh my God. Should we have a baby or not? Great question, Hannah.\n\nGreat question. Yes. Okay, fine.\n\nAnd we'll do it. Yes. Well, Keke Palmer just popped one out.\n\nYou just popped one out. And you guys are, like, iconic in every way. Thank you.\n\nAre you. You do what you can. Yeah.\n\nOkay. Vanessa, also, we have to talk about your dress because it's stunning.\n\nI love a feather. I'm a big feather girl. I think they're so good.\n\nWhat's like your process when you're picking your Vanity Fair? Look, because it's different from other red\n\ncarpets. Yeah. I mean, like, I am that girl who genuinely\n\ntries on a dress, and the first one I try on is always the dress.\n\nIt's like a man. It's like a man. You gotta go with your instincts.\n\nIt's like a man. Yeah. It's dating.\n\nIf you don't know in the first 30s. It's not for you, honey. I have a controversial question.\n\nYes. Side part or middle part? I'm normally a middle part girl.\n\nI know. Tonight we're rocking. Yeah.\n\nAnd I'm so jealous cause I can't pull off a look at that. You can pull off a side.\n\nYou totally can. Believe in yourself. Okay.\n\nThank you. I didn't think I could either. But you just got to go for it.\n\nI'm making this interview about me, and I need to stop. I need to stop.\n\nSo are you. Is there any fashion look that you're kind of or trend that you're kind of over?\n\nI don't know. I mean, nothing really pops to mind.\n\nI mean, I feel like we saw a lot of, like, bigger is better moments. I mean, Cynthia's dress, that Louis Vuitton\n\nwas so iconic. I don't know how she sat. Yeah.\n\nNo, I don't know if she did. It was art. Yeah, it was art.\n\nIt was truly art. The girls are standing on business today. Yeah.\n\nVanessa, thank you so much for stopping by. We'll see you inside. Have fun and welcome back.\n\nYes. And shout out to your baby tan. Back to you.\n\nThank you. Gosh, I love it. Back to me.\n\nPeople are arriving on the carpet. Have you seen them all? They're looking incredible.\n\nWho we got? Serena Williams looking like a vision. VA VA voom has an incredible two.\n\nWho else we got on that red carpet? You know, I can barely see. I'm short sighted.\n\nHere we go. Okay, who have I got? Do you know what?\n\nNever mind. Now let's go to our fellow co-hosts, actor and filmmaker Francesca Scorsese, who's with\n\nSarah Paulson. Okay, so I'm here with Sarah Paulson. Welcome.\n\nThank you. You've worked with Ryan Murphy on so many twisted Tales.\n\nWhat is your favorite horror trope? My favorite horror trope.\n\nOh, God. You know, it's a hard question. The final girl.\n\nI always loved. The final girl. I've been the final girl a couple of times.\n\nThat's true. I'm looking forward to not being the final girl sometimes, but the final girl trope\n\nworks for me. Good. And you've done everything from horror to\n\ndrama. What genre would you like to explore that you haven't yet?\n\nOh, I'd like to do a big stinking comedy because nobody lets me do it.\n\nSince I'm wearing this dress, I feel like comedy will lend itself because, you know, go big or go home is my my motto.\n\nYeah, I love that. That's amazing. And what is the first thing that you plan to\n\ndo when you get into the party? Go straight to the bar. Amazing.\n\nAnd if anyone doesn't say that, they're a loser. Yeah, totally.\n\nI mean, I mean, for all the sober people out there. I don't mean that about you.\n\nI can just, you know, we live in a world now where I'm going to get 22 tweets about how no tweets.\n\nDoes anybody tweet anymore? Okay. I mean, yes, but blue sky, what are we doing\n\nthese days? I don't even really know. I don't even know what it's called.\n\nBlue sky. Blue sky. Sky.\n\nBlue sky. Or blue sky.

I'm really just waking up and living my life.\n\nBut I'm really glad that everyone's on board. No, you are the coolest one here, for sure. She put, like, conditioner on her hair cause\n\nshe was tired and everyone just copied her and was like. And now we put conditioner, coconut oil\n\nbecause my hair was greasy. Yeah. And it worked out.\n\nA lot of power comes. Great responsibility. What's the next trend?\n\nDo you think is going to be happening? Give us what are we going to do?\n\nGuys don't follow trends. That's the next trend. Don't follow a trend.\n\nSo iconic of you to say that was so iconic. Okay, I have a fashion question. Okay.\n\nYou come to a lot of these.

We've never.\n\nPaige is never asked a man anything. 100%. My husband has good taste.\n\nMy husband has really good taste. I mean, he wears glasses.

Thank you for stopping by. Thank you for having me on.\n\nBack to tan. Thank you. Los Angeles is the heart of Hollywood, but\n\nthe recent wildfires have deeply impacted this city. Matt Bomer is here to share how the community\n\nis coming together to rebuild. Thank you. Tan.\n\nI am here with Courtney Bailey, who oversees fundraising for Mptf, the Motion Picture and Television Fund, which is a wonderful\n\norganization close to my heart because they're committed to helping everyone in our industry in times of need.\n\nThe recent devastation caused by the LA wildfires demonstrates how critical Mptf is to members of our community who have lost\n\neverything and who are now trying to rebuild their livelihood.\n\nAnd it's not just actors, right, Courtney?

We're also providing guidance and helping people navigate insurance claims, FEMA\n\ngrants, along with so many social services to help them cope and manage the truly enormous gravity of the situation.\n\nThat's incredible.

Oh my gosh, do we have a best dressed?\n\nOkay, I don't want to give any early predictions, but who do you like? No, I'm gonna say I loved Kim Kardashian.\n\nI was just about to say it, but I didn't want to be too obvious. She looked incredible.\n\nShe was giving cloud a ethereal. She was honestly giving bed vibes and I loved it.\n\nI also thought that her friend Steph Shep looked amazing. Steph.\n\nGorgeous. Gorgeous. Iconic.\n\nShe's always chic and as you would say, tan. Stunning. Stunning.\n\nAbsolutely stunning. You know who else was stunning? Who?\n\nI'm jealous that you got to speak to Nicole. Oh, well, she's just elegant in every way.\n\nSofia. Sofia. I was gonna say I got her name wrong.\n\nSofia. I was gonna roll with it. I was like, I was like, you are such a ride\n\nor die. You're such a ride. Thank you so much.\n\nI You guys, you guys have got to stop you. Are you looking at the monitor? Look at Jeff Goldblum.\n\nI mean, okay, shades on a red carpet for Jeff.\n\nLook how he's posing. Oh, I love him so much, guy. Okay, you guys, how's your first time going?\n\nThis is your first night hosting this. Are you doing okay? Holding up?\n\nThere's so much adrenaline. We took two beta blockers, and we are in it for the long haul.\n\nWe can't feel a thing right now. Beta blocker.\n\nWe wouldn't feel it. Has there been anyone that you were desperate to talk to that just passed you?\n\nThis is. Well, Serena Williams. Where is she?\n\nOh, don't get me started. She's agile. She got away.\n\nDid she? She's the fastest woman on the planet. So I think I missed her, but I heard people\n\nyelling, so I'm really upset. But I'm a tennis nerd. So that was I was.\n\nI'm obsessed with everything she does. We also we missed Julia Fox, which I'm livid about.\n\nShe did look incredible. I do love that you made a sport reference though, Hannah, as if I might know what\n\nyou're talking about, so I'm gonna have to move on real quick. Francesca's on the red carpet with Leslie and\n\nChelsea. I feel like I'm so excited. You've given me a microphone.\n\nIt's all over. Your job is going to be gone. I know.\n\nHonestly, if I could go. Okay.\n\nI'm so excited to have you guys join me. This is the lovely Chelsea Handler and Leslie Bibb.\n\nThank you. So if the two of you were to team up for a comedy show, what would it be about?\n\nOh, it would have to be some sort of road trip, right?\n\nThink Thelma and Louise. We're on a train. Like a high end train like the Orient Express\n\nor meets Midnight Run. Something like that. Yeah, I think it's Thelma and Louise meets\n\nMidnight Run. And we wouldn't have to do much acting. It would just be improvizational and just\n\nwith, like, loose, loose outlines.\n\nYes, absolutely. This would be exactly what's happening. Her talking and me laughing.\n\nThat's amazing, I love it. And Leslie, The White Lotus is all about secrets and scandals.\n\nSo if this party had a twist ending, what would it be? If this party had a surprise ending.\n\nYeah, we all die.\n\nI mean, that would be very White Lotus. Absolutely. Absolutely.\n\nBody. One body bag. Not one body bag.\n\nOne body bag. No one. You need Mike white.\n\nMike White I'm not a writer, but Mike white would tell you what's best. I love it.\n\nThank you both so, so much. Thank you, thank you, thank you.\n\nOh, VA VA VA voom. Gabrielle Union looks absolutely stunning. Gosh, I love a column dress.\n\nAnd she looks gorgeous in that. Um, who do we have next? Who's this vision?\n\nUm, do you know that dress? Couldn't be hotter. Oh, my God, it's Cyd Sydney Sweeney.\n\nHi, baby girl. Oh, she looks absolutely beautiful when she not looked gorgeous.\n\nI've got to say, Julia Garner might be on my best dressed list for the night.\n\nI'm assuming it's Gucci because she is their brand ambassador and looks Heavenly yaskin.\n\nAnd that girl knows how to pose. Gosh that's good. Love that.\n\nI love that she's giving us texture. Christina Ricci ah, we call her Nina. Hi, Nina.\n\nUm, Christina's looking beautiful.\n\nOh, wow. Oh, and here we have Ben. Gorgeous.\n\nBen. Um, okay. Shall we get back to it?\n\nFrancesca's on the carpet with our darling Dan and Clea.\n\nLet's hit it.\n\nSo I am joined by Dan Levy and Clea Duvall. Thank you so much for being here and for talking, for having us.\n\nUm, Dan, you've mastered the art of fashion both on and off screen. How do you stay true to your personal style?\n\nI don't know, I always feel like when you try something on and you feel your best in it, that's generally what you should be going\n\nwith. But often people can put you in some pretty easy stuff.\n\nYeah. Do you think it's fashion, but if you can't wear it, there's no point.\n\nIt's all the confidence of it. So anyway, sometimes the simpler way to go is always the best.\n\nIt's true, it's true. And is there a genre or role that you've always wanted to explore that you haven't\n\nyet? Um, I mean, I'm fascinated for this answer.\n\nI the genre I'm most excited about is one that I've actually been in as an actor, but as a director, I'd really like to do horror.\n\nLove that. I would love to do horror. I love horror.\n\nI don't think anyone would take me seriously in a horror, really. I would put you in a horror movie.\n\nHorror? Yeah. Okay, great.\n\nOkay, done. Thank you. A horror film.\n\nOkay. All right, so who asked who to this event? Do you guys have, like, a kind of promposal\n\nthing? I said, Cleo, will you come to the Vanity Fair party with me in rose petals?\n\nYeah, in front of Cleo's House. I burst into tears. Into tears.\n\nWow. And I said, of course. The rest is history for us.\n\nReally? God. That's amazing.\n\nThat's so lovely. Yeah. Thank you.\n\nThank you for. Thank you for joining me. And I hope you have the best.\n\nThank you for having us.\n\nGosh, Mr. Stanfield, you have never looked more handsome. I love a Saint Laurent suit on a man.\n\nAnd I'm assuming this is his partner who is looking equally stunning. Wow.\n\nCould you imagine being a couple? That's hot. That is that hot?\n\nLike, where do you go from there? You wake up in the morning just knowing this is it.\n\nYou're perfect. Um, you guys, at some point soon, hopefully we're going to see Selena Gomez because she\n\njust rocked up and I see her in line and she's looking she's standing right behind us and we're trying to get out.\n\nI'm so jealous. I know I tried to pretend I was cool too. She looked incredible.\n\nI'm sweating just knowing she's near because I don't want her to know we're talking about her.\n\nNah. Do it. Do it.\n\nShe's wearing so many diamonds. I just burnt out my retina. And you know what?\n\nThe thing is? She's not. They're not on loan, I bet.\n\nLike she's Quincy. She can afford to keep those.\n\nYeah, those are hers. Those are just. Those are her.\n\nHer Saturday night diamonds. Not the regular. Like dishwashing diamonds.\n\nShe'll wear those in the kitchen, I'm sure. She's one of those guys. She also must be tired because she has been\n\non a press run. Do you know what? No.\n\nThat one's got so much energy. She's been doing this for years. She is trained.\n\nShe's a machine. True. I did watch her documentary.\n\nShe's been busy for a long time. Yeah. And she's not stopping anytime soon.\n\nOh, I love when men go for something fun. And they don't just do the traditional.\n\nIt's pirate chic. Pirate chic? Yeah.\n\nI love that you're calling it pirate chic. It is fully Saint Laurent. And you just referred to it as pirate chic.\n\nLOL. Saint Laurent loves a boat.\n\nSaint Laurent has been on a boat before. That's so funny. That's so funny.\n\nAll right. One of the best things about award season is getting to see a more candid, unfiltered side\n\nof Hollywood's biggest stars. Vanity Fair has been capturing such moments for some of our favorite nominees and winners\n\nall season long. They remain. They're still in the city.\n\nThe aspirations of the film really speak to me on many levels. One as an artist, as someone who wants to\n\nleave behind a body of work that is of some significance.\n\nEven distilling work in a film is similar to an architect erecting a building and creating something.\n\nThere's a foundation of work.\n\nSo joining me now is the host of this fabulous party, Vanity Fair editor in chief Radhika Jones.\n\nWelcome. Hi, Francesca. Hi.\n\nWhat is so special about tonight? Well, the Oscar party is always special. It is the end of a long season of hard work\n\nand campaigning on the part of the actors and directors and everyone who comes to the party.\n\nIt's it's such an incredible night of celebration, and it's literally the high point of many people's lives.\n\nIt's like the night that they win an Oscar, so that's great. But, you know, we're also conscious this year\n\nthat it's been a difficult start to the year for LA with the wildfires.\n\nWe are happy to be partnering with Baby to Baby and Mptf to provide help out with some wildfire relief for families and for industry\n\nprofessionals. So it feels good to be here to lift those causes up and also to celebrate some amazing\n\ntalent. That's amazing. And what does this party mean to you?\n\nI mean, well, I was thinking on the way over. This is my seventh Oscar party. Lucky seven.\n\nI know. So I think it's going to be a great night. And honestly, it's just so much fun and\n\neveryone comes in and has a wonderful time, so I'm looking forward to the same.\n\nAmazing. Thank you so much and enjoy. Thank you.\n\nAwesome. We are joined by Madison Beer, who I currently have beef with because we both have\n\nthe same good side. We're both going to talk to her like this. That's so crazy.\n\nBecause Hannah wouldn't let me stand on that side for my dress. It's a real fight.\n\nI actually need to stand like this, too. But the crazy thing is, Madison beer does not have a bad side.\n\nAnd you? You do? What are you talking about?\n\nNo. She does. No, I do.\n\nI really do. I do. She said no, you do.\n\nI Vanity Fair Vanity Fair almost fired me because of it.\n\nWait, you're you're singing. Career is blowing up. Your fashion has never been better.\n\nOh my God. What are the vibes right now? I don't know.\n\nAre you excited to be here and talking to us? Absolutely. I'm so honored that I'm here.\n\nThis is amazing. And I feel like you're so nice of you. Sorry.\n\nYou've done. No, she's really nice. She's not looking over here.\n\nSorry. I'm like. You're so nice.\n\nOh my God. I love you guys.\n\nShould we just go in and have a cocktail? I feel like we just want.\n\nOh, wait. So when you're at a party, who are you like? Are you the wallflower?\n\nAre you socializing? Are you just observing? No.\n\nI'm terrified. You're terrified the whole time. But I'm trying to be more confident just in\n\ngeneral. Even if it's, like, fake it till you make it, you know?\n\nYeah. This is how we got here. Trying really hard.\n\nYeah, we lied on our resume when we got here. It's just been fake it till you make it. Yeah.\n\nYeah, I think I'm just trying to be more confident, but internally, I'm like, who am I?\n\nWell, what's your trick when you're not feeling confident, what's your go to thing to do?\n\nPretend. Yeah, you have to pretend. And that's why you deserve an Oscar one day.\n\nIf there's someone that you look up to that you feel like always embodies, like, confidence and stuff, think about them.\n\nThat's what I do. Honestly, I'll think about someone that I'm like, I know this person is always eating.\n\nThey're always confident I love, and I just, like, honestly pretend that I'm them if I'm feeling insecure.\n\nOkay, we have to talk before you go. We have to talk about your dress. Yes.\n\nUB sass. Thank you. It's giving old Hollywood.\n\nI love the black and white. Yeah. No, she's a tall drink of water.\n\nShe's so gorgeous. And I love the high pony. Thank you.\n\nHow do you pick your hairstyle for, like, to match the dress? I never wear my hair up.\n\nEver. Neither do I. Are we twins?\n\nWe look the same. I hate my ears. We do look the same.\n\nWe're twins. Wait. Someone told me I had elf ears when I was\n\ngrowing up. Someone was like. You should get your ears pinned back.\n\nAnd it ruined my life. So here we are. That's so crazy.\n\nI love my ears. No, no, she loves. And you can hear me so well right now.\n\nYou know what I mean? No, absolutely I do. I can hear them across the street.\n\nNo, but nothing gets past you. I honestly just, like, I don't know, I just feel like I try to look at an outfit.\n\nI honestly did this fitting with my hair up, and I was like, I kind of like it, and I hate that I like it.\n\nSo hopefully I don't hate all the photos that come out. No, you crushed it.\n\nYou're absolutely. We look up to you. You killed all the time to think about you.\n\nWhen we want to be confident, when we get inside. Yes.\n\nWe love you. Back to him.\n\nI'm thinking. No thank you. Thank you for doing this.\n\nYou okay? I don't get this. I could.\n\nI'm sorry. You caught me gossiping. I know we were.\n\nWe were gossiping. Emma's my girl, I love you. You know I love you so much.\n\nSo much. This is all the conversation is gonna be. I love you so much.\n\nWe're just gonna gush, but I'm gonna be professional and say this. Okay.\n\nYou look incredible. Thank you so much. Now, I do need you to know.\n\nI knew as soon as she walked off, I was like Jean-Paul Gaultier, right? Yeah.\n\nObviously, it's Jean-Paul Gaultier. Bye, Ludovic. Unbelievable.\n\nI, like, saw this collection, and I was like, if I don't wear that, I'm gonna be sad. I'm gonna be heartbroken with the hat.\n\nLike, it's all so tough, baby. Thank you. It's so tough.\n\nIt's the best you've ever looked. Wait. Stop!\n\nIs it? Thank you. I know she always looks good.\n\nAnd I need you to know I said it off camera, too. And if I don't like someone's.\n\nLook, I don't say it. I love that about you. I'll find a way to come up with something\n\nelse. I love that. It's the best you've ever looked.\n\nI love the short on you. And it's not easy to pull off for most people.\n\nThank you for giving me 80s. I love that. Well, I just like to be honest.\n\nThe reason why I did it and the reason why I chopped it all off was because, honestly. Well, I wanted a change.\n\nI was kind of sick of, like, long hair. I've had it my whole life. But also, it's so much easier to have short\n\nhair. I wake up. Sure is.\n\nAnd my hair is just done. I love that we are almost twinning.\n\nI'm going to go. I'm going to go for your blond soon, I'm sure.\n\nLet's do it I would love I would love so much. Good.\n\nOkay. We were talking about this before you guys joined us.\n\nChamberlain. Coffee? Yes.\n\nYou launched a store? Yes. Wait.\n\nWhat are we calling it? A cafe. Cafe?\n\nA cafe? A cafe that went nuts. It's been truly like an incredible\n\nblessing. Is this the first of many? It's the first of many, hopefully.\n\nBut I always am like. Oh, God. Now, did I jinx it or something?\n\nBut I would love to give me an exclusive. Where's the next one? Opening?\n\nI actually don't know. You know, I would give you the exclusive, but.\n\nAll right, all right. But we're, like, almost house hunting. Do you know what I mean?\n\nIt's like. Which is so fun. Yeah, we're shopping for the next place, but\n\nit's like you want the aura of the space to be, right? And that takes time.\n\nI'm telling you, this one's going to rule the world one day. She's the baddest around, all right?\n\nRight. If you don't rule the world first, I can't gush anymore.\n\nYou got to go. She's gonna go to the party. I'm gonna see you in the party.\n\nI love you. I love you. I love this girl.\n\nI love you. That's it, that's it. We're out.\n\nI'm going home. I'll see you all later. No.\n\nI'm joking. Well, come join us. Come join us.\n\nLook at this switcheroo. Don't worry about it. Hello, Alan.\n\nHow are you, sir? Good to see you. Very well.\n\nThanks. You're so dapper. You look so dapper.\n\nSo I met you at a party earlier on this year or last year with Corinna.\n\nUm. And you were wearing a gorgeous white suit. And I asked her was that man styled himself\n\nbecause he looks incredible. And you do stuff that most people don't do. Can you tell me about how you get ready for\n\nan event. Do you work with a status or do you just tell yourself?\n\nNo, I work with the stylist Erica Cloud, but do you push that stylist to push you harder because you don't dress like most men?\n\nI do push her to like. I push her to push me. Do you?\n\nYou care about fashion? I do care about fashion. Yeah, yeah, yeah.\n\nIt's very much a, like a, like a big part of my life. And I have, like, whenever the cameras\n\nweren't rolling. Yeah. You know, and, um, living in Los Angeles and\n\nnow living in New York, you know, the style is the is the same, but it's different. It sure is.\n\nAnd. Yeah. Yeah, I think the I, you know, I've never\n\nworn sweatpants on a plane, I'll say that. You haven't? Gosh, I live in sweatpants on a plane.\n\nAbsolutely not. I think it's crazy when people get dressed up for a plane.\n\nOkay, wait. I think it's crazy that people get dressed up for a plane.\n\nAbsolutely crazy. I think it's so insane. I just wanna be comfortable.\n\nOkay, enough about fashion. Because I really want to talk about White Lotus.\n\nAnd I know I don't have you for long, right? Um, the the new season of White Lotus has gone nuts, like everyone is talking about it.\n\nDo you do you feel pressure going into White Lotus because it's such a massive show? Yeah.\n\nI mean, I think anybody would be lying if they didn't. If they didn't say that.\n\nYeah. You feel pressured. You don't want to disappoint Mike white first\n\nand foremost. And you don't want to disappoint the fans. Yeah.\n\nAnd you don't want to disappoint the people that you're working with. Right.\n\nYeah. But all of those concerns, like coming to your mind, even, like working with Quentin,\n\nyou know, like Tarantino a couple of times. You always have that kind of going into an experience.\n\nYeah. And then, you know, pretty quickly thereafter, you realize, oh, wait a minute,\n\nI'm a storyteller. That's what I do for a living. I'm going to tell this story as best I can.\n\nNot just the best you can. You're killing it. I'm loving.\n\nI'm such a massive fan. I'm loving the new season. Thank you so much.\n\nAnd you're so damn good on it. Thank you, I think. Terrifying.\n\nA complete A-hole. But I know that you're a lovely man in real life now.\n\nI promise. I promise you that. That by the end of it, we'll fall in love\n\nwith you when it's all said and done. This guy, Rick Hatchet, and the journey that he's on will say something very profound.\n\nAnd it will be visceral in ways that you could not expect. We love a tease that doesn't really give too\n\nmuch away. I'll take that for now. Thank you so much.\n\nWe'll see you in the party. Have fun tonight. Thank you mate.\n\nCheers, buddy. Cheers, buddy. And then we're going to swap.\n\nWe're gonna do a switcheroo again. Look at all these pictures. Thank you so much, mate.\n\nHello, my darling. How are you? Okay, everyone.\n\nCheryl, look at this vision. Um. We did it.\n\nI think I did this with you last year, and I was gagged. I was left gagged, and we had a lovely time.\n\nWell, because you're an angel sent down from heaven. Thank you very much.\n\nYou know, you have the best reputation in Hollywood. Thank you.\n\nUm, can you talk to me about what goes into planning for tonight? Because this is stunning.\n\nThank you. This is Valdrin Sahiti, and my stylist does such an excellent job.\n\nAnd, you know, I think about where we started three years ago to where we have arrived now. Classic simplicity.\n\nTimeless. I am so thankful. I'm so thankful.\n\nShe's so talented. And you look back in 20 years and say, yeah, I looked incredible.\n\nIt's timeless. Um, I wanted to ask you this for a long time. Yes.\n\nNow, when you get up on stage and you say something, it's always profound. As if I've gone to the most incredible\n\nchurch. Do you plan it in advance or. You just are so beautifully philosophical.\n\nAlways. You know something? I'm going to have to take the compliment and\n\nsay that that's just a part of my makeup. It's just a part of who I am as a human being.\n\nI truly, truly believe life is short, and if people don't acknowledge how short it is by spending their days, by being as good as they\n\ncan, as kind as they can, they are wasting their time on this earth.\n\nI could not agree more, and I don't want to take up any more of your time. So go enjoy that party because it's a good\n\none tonight. It's a real good one. The gorgeous Cheryl upstate.\n\nI've got nothing else to say. What's up man? We got Brooklyn, Queens, Albany in the\n\nbuilding. We're actually starting some kind of some kind of band or cult.\n\nJesse, congratulations. You've been on a crazy press tour. Yeah.\n\nYeah, yeah. And, like, you've been killing it with Kieran.\n\nOh, thanks. How do you hype yourself up before an interview?\n\nEspecially if you have social anxiety like this one. Yeah.\n\nWe're nervous. If you've heard or seen me in any interviews, I don't hype myself up at all.\n\nI'm very, very low. Low wattage? Yeah.\n\nUnderpromise and overdeliver. That's it. Yeah, exactly.\n\nI'm obsessed with that. Yeah. Have you, like.\n\nDo you like this party? Like, what are you, like, at a party? Like, is this one that you're like, oh, I'm\n\ngoing to dance. Well, I am like, at a party is somebody who's doing a favor for my wife.\n\nYou're a good husband. Oh, it's like. Like your wife took you shopping and you're\n\nsitting and waiting for her. That's like the energy. Pretty much that.\n\nYes, it's pretty much that. And then she often will walk out with a bag. Yes.\n\nYeah, it's pretty much the same thing. I like that a lot. What a date night.\n\nThe Vanity Fair. Yeah. This should net me several things that I\n\ndon't have to go to in the next six months. Has anyone come up to you for a selfie? Who's really famous?\n\nOh, no. I didn't mean to put you on the spot like that.\n\nNot one person. I couldn't compute your question of like, wait, why?\n\nI don't understand. Oh, have they asked me for a weight? You mean because.\n\nOh, because you're awesome. Jessie. Yeah.\n\nNo no no, no, but I'm not. I think they could tell that I'm not the selfie.\n\nYou're not the kind of guy. Yeah, I think so. I think I give off energy of you'll ruin the\n\nselfie. Something fun. And we had our phones.\n\nWe would take a selfie with you. Then I would. Then you would be my answer.\n\nYeah, yeah, that makes that makes sense. And when you're coming together with a look, do you have opinions with your stylist?\n\nAre you like, this is the vibe I want to put out tonight or does your wife pick your outfits?\n\nUm, sorry. We're hearing a lot of questions.\n\nListen. I'm prepared. No, I they put this on me five minutes before\n\nI left. Yeah. And then, you know, I could take it off and\n\nnever have to wear it until somebody gets married or bar mitzvah in my family for the next several years.\n\nYeah. Do you ever complain about your feet like that?\n\nYour shoes hurt? No. I complain about my feet for other reasons.\n\nOh, okay. Yeah, it's kind of more of a bunion issue. Maybe we'll get into that a little later.\n\nThanks. We'll discuss our bunions more in depth. Vanity Fair is telling us we can't discuss\n\nbunions. That's actually the one thing we weren't allowed to talk about tonight.\n\nAre you working on any new projects? How do you find inspiration for a new project?\n\nLook at me. Just asking the deepest question I could think of.\n\nYou know, we're on this purpose on this planet, Jesse. Listen, we all float around for it feels like\n\na second. Um, look, we're just feathers tonight. Makes it feel like gone with the wind.\n\nYes, yes, it's been amazing. Yeah, it's been amazing. And I think people are ready for this\n\ninterview. I think people are going to. I think just with everything that's going on\n\nin the world, I think people are going to be ready for this interview. I know that it's going to change the climate\n\nin some capacity. Yeah. If anything, Hannah's wearing extensions.\n\nI wear extensions really important. Yeah. Do you know what extensions are?\n\nOf course I know what extensions are. Where? Where I can't even get in a fight.\n\nJesse. I was just asking if you knew. I do, and they are seamless.\n\nThank you. Thank you so much. Would you ever bleach your hair blond.\n\nUh, yeah. Yeah, I definitely do that. Yeah, yeah.\n\nYeah, definitely. Just like on a movie part, I wouldn't like you wouldn't do it like on a Saturday.\n\nWell, even if you're going through a hard time, you might do it on a Saturday because, you know, usually shooting on Monday.\n\nRight? Okay. So you want to do all the hair dyeing on the\n\nweekend. You're smart with logistics okay. Honestly, he's handled everything we've\n\nthrown at him. And we are so impressed by you. Oh.\n\nThanks, Jesse. You're killing it. Go have fun at the party.\n\nYou've survived. Get away from us! You're so funny.\n\nYou survived. We love you. This was a nice back to you, tan.\n\nThat was great. You guys are great. Oh my God.\n\nJesse, um. Oh, my God, is that Cynthia? Please tell me that.\n\nCynthia. I see the nails. It's got to be Cynthia.\n\nOh, Lina. Love this couple so much. Wow, I love that.\n\nUm, Cynthia's giving us a third look of the night. Well done.\n\nCynthia. Sofia Carson, who said she watched my Netflix specials?\n\nSo obsessed. I love her. We ride at dawn.\n\nLook at this moment. A vision, a vision. You guys.\n\nYou guys look beautiful. How did you decide? Hair up or hair down?\n\nYeah, the hair up was easy because there was a lot. See?\n\nWe're all friends. Sorry. That's Hannah's best friend.\n\nHailey Bieber. We just said hi. Hayley, I'm right here.\n\nThat was crazy. Really cool. No!\n\nStop! It's because she's wearing extensions. I know, she's been acting different.\n\nI Halle Bailey it's the hair. It's the long hair. That's why I asked you.\n\nHair up. There was a lot happening here, so it was an easy decision to take it out.\n\nHave you ever done anything crazy to prep for an event like this? No, I'm pretty boring.\n\nI actually had my first shot of tequila before a carpet. Ever.\n\nJust now. Oh my God. Just now.\n\nHow do you feel? I feel great. Okay, good, good.\n\nNo we're not. It's nice. It's like takes the edge off.\n\nWe're sober. If anyone's wondering, this is us sober. Oh my gosh.\n\nSo when you go to these events, do you have any advice for talking to super famous people?\n\nBecause we've not been doing a great job thus far. What have you guys been doing in your\n\napproach? I just we've just been asking silly questions.\n\nThat's nice though. Yeah. Who are you at a party?\n\nAre you a wallflower? Are you not? I like that.\n\nWe're asking her questions that we asked. We're asking her if our questions were good to other people.\n\nNo. You feel like a girl's girl. And so I feel comfortable.\n\nWe do feel comfortable. I feel comfortable. We do feel comfortable with your energy.\n\nUm, but, yeah, when you go into a party, do you have any advice for, like, looking cool? No, because I'm not cool.\n\nI've never been cool. I was a nerd in school, and I still am, so I just, like, approach them like a fan.\n\nBut I try to be, like, subtle about it. And I still say, like, I just admire you so much and I never know if it's the party to do\n\nit, but everyone seems to take it well. Now I have to ask, did you practice posing in your dress?\n\nYou did practice. What did you come up with? I show you.\n\nYes, yes. Show us please. Okay, so we're fluffing.\n\nWe're fluffing. Keep it down. Yes!\n\nIt's gorgeous. It's like a goddess. This is.\n\nTake note of this. This is important. Right on the hip bone.\n\nRight on the hip bone. It's giving angles. Yes, yes.\n\nOh, my. I'm blind. I'm blind.\n\nThis is crazy. Oh, sorry. Took your mic.\n\nYeah. What's your, like, day to day outfit when you're at home?\n\nThe closest thing to pajamas. Yes. Pajamas.\n\nThe closest thing like to comfy sweats. Oversize everything all the time. Girlhood is about balance.\n\nIt really is. Am I right? When you're right.\n\nWhen you're choosing an outfit. Do you ever choose for comfort? Or do you always go for style?\n\nI've ever chosen for comfort. So to be honest, I will say though, today I was between this dress and another dress that\n\nwas a little out of my comfort zone and this one felt the most me.\n\nYeah. So if that's comfort, then maybe this was the dress, but it's not.\n\nParticularly if you look good, you play good. Exactly. No, it's so true.\n\nIt's about how you feel. Yeah. Yeah, it really is.\n\nSofia, thank you so much for coming. We too nice to us. Such a pleasure.\n\nAnd. Yeah. Thank you.\n\nGet out of here. Get out of here! Go hang out with someone.\n\nCool. Oh my God! Yes, yes.\n\nUm, okay. I don't even know what to say right now, but my best friend is here.\n\nWe're freaking out. Haley bleeping Bieber is Haley.\n\nHow are you? Hi. Nice to meet you.\n\nIt's so nice to meet you. My best friend talks about you all the time. She said my best friend too.\n\nNo, Haley. It's it's. Where's Kendall?\n\nBecause I feel like she's coming. She's coming because that's my best friend you're trying to have, like.\n\nYeah, like a Charlie's Angels moment. You always say crush it on the red carpet. Like, truly, always the queen.\n\nThank you. When you're, like, in the fitting for your dress, for something like this.\n\nDo you know, in the first 30s or are you, like, someone that has to try it on, put it back on, take a picture.\n\nKind of more that because once I try something on, I start conceptualizing the whole thing.\n\nThe hair, the makeup, the whole. You give her a persona? The whole thing head to toe.\n\nBut tonight, I actually was really torn between two dresses. But I went with this one.\n\nIt's custom YSL gorgeous. I love it, I'm super happy.\n\nAnd your skin looks so good. Exactly. That's what I want to know.\n\nWhat road are we wearing right now? Um, well, all my skin prep is always road. And then I also have some of our blush on our\n\npeptide lip shape, a lip treatment. Call it out. Hale's.\n\nCall it out. My mom stole one of my lip treatments. So, mom, we'll discuss this later.\n\nIt's okay. I'll replace it for you. Thank you.\n\nI do, I'm like. Mom, I know someone. I'm good.\n\nSo, Hailey, you go to these parties a lot. Are you ever trying besides me? Are you trying to make any new friends in\n\nthere, or is it kind of. You stick with the group. I'm.\n\nI like to stick with my friends, but I am a social butterfly. I start to kind of just, like, run around and\n\nfly around and talk to people. She literally has an aura around her where you just want to befriend her.\n\nI can feel it. She can literally, literally the best. That's how I feel about you.\n\nAnd now you. Haley. We're the three best friends.\n\nHello. We want to know any posing advice. Because you every carpet you just like.\n\nYou look like you're seven feet tall. I always still get nervous about the way to pose, because, you know, I obviously wanted\n\nto look. Well, they're screaming at you, and it's very overwhelming.\n\nI need a beta blocker. It's very overwhelming. You feel like you're about to get robbed?\n\nYeah. It's crazy. Also, as a mother.\n\nNow on the red carpet. How has it changed your perspective on all these crazy events?\n\nLike having something to ground you? Well, you're just thinking about such different things now.\n\nI'm like, I'm going to go inside and be checking my, my, my baby monitor nonstop. So I have a different mindset.\n\nI have a furbo, so I know I check on my cat. She's a mother. She's a she's a mother.\n\nI'm a mother. To actually Haley as a trendsetter, any trends for that are coming up that you're\n\ninto in terms of fashion because we're just or any trends that you're like, I'm so over it.\n\nYou know, what's so annoying is I just answered that, like, I thought about this the other day and I'm like, people ask me this\n\nquestion a lot. I have to remember my answer and now I forget.\n\nI forget. I'm so annoying. You could literally punch us in the face and\n\nwe don't care. Like you don't have to say anything right now.\n\nYou are incredible. Keeping you. We're obsessed with you.\n\nI'm so happy to see you. Thank you for talking to us.\n\nI'll see you tomorrow for brunch. Get out of here. Get out of here.\n\nThank you. Thank you. Lil NAS x, are you kidding me?\n\nOh my God. Guys. We're just.\n\nYay! I like how I'm here. Guys, they have my name with a Z on the\n\nteleprompter instead of an S right now. And we. And that person did just get fired.\n\nYou're fired. No, that person got fired. Get out!\n\nGet them. Literally out also. We've just been staring at ourselves in the\n\nmonitor the whole time, so work it. A vision in white. I'm obsessed.\n\nNo, no, I love it, I love it. I love a cropped blazer, honey. Yes!\n\nOh my God. And the shoe. And the shoes.\n\nCan you, like, lift your leg up? Because I feel like the people at home.\n\nThis is very in right now. I heard, I heard we, Mr. X, I have questions for you.\n\nWhen do you decide to go tiktoking or when do you stop? Because I feel like you.\n\nDo I stop? You know, you go, you disappear for like ten years.\n\nYou come back. Stop it. Right.\n\nHow do you decide? I randomly do it. I like to do it when I like.\n\nHave fun. I don't like to do it, like. Feel like it's an obligation.\n\nYeah. No, I don't like obligated TikTok. Like we.\n\nI wait for this content. I drool for your content, I can't wait. Um, okay.\n\nHow involved are you with putting together looks? Because they're always.\n\nSo you. Yeah. I'm, um.\n\nI'm pretty involved. I never get, like, too crazy. I don't like to step on, like, the stylish\n\ntoes. Yeah. You're not like, yelling.\n\nThey had this. They had this in black. And I was like, okay, can we get it white?\n\nI want to feel godly. Yeah. Can we get, like, on the arm, like my stencil\n\nfor my my next album. Yeah. Like dream boy.\n\nLike I'm getting it on. Yeah. Always be promoting.\n\nPeople don't talk about he lived. He leaves a lot of, um. What does Taylor Swift do?\n\nEaster eggs and stuff. Easter. Easter eggs.\n\nYes. Easter eggs. Shout out to Taylor, shout out Taytay, we\n\nlove you! I need to know, like when you go into a party like this, do you just stunt on everyone\n\nbecause you're a better dancer? Like, are you like, hey, watch this. No, I'm like trying to dance with everybody.\n\nI want to make everybody who looks like they're uncomfortable feel like I'm like. I'm like, yay!\n\nSee if I could dance like you. I'd be like, form a circle around me. I'm going to do something here, you know?\n\nWait, are you guys going to make out? Are you guys going to make out? We're going to do it.\n\nNo, no, not this time. We're streaming so we could. It's not on real time.\n\nNo, no. I'm scared. And also look, his nails look good too.\n\nOh, yes. Oh, yeah. They just came.\n\nThey just came like this. I didn't touch them little things. I used to play your songs all the time to\n\nprep for my stand up. You need to get back to doing it, baby. No, no.\n\nLike when when you're first song came out, you guys aren't going to make out okay. Now he's mad.\n\nNow I'm in a fight. I'm mad. It's okay.\n\nJust scream the next one, okay? I was like, what kind of sexual dungeon are you in right now?\n\nAnd I was like, Lil NAS X. Like, I'm just playing him having fun. No, we are obsessed with you.\n\nYeah. Has anyone, um, like, cool asked you for a selfie?\n\nI'd like to hear tonight. No, because I just got here and I wasn't at the Oscars.\n\nSadly. That's okay. Neither were we.\n\nThis is where the party is. That's cool. Yeah, that was cool.\n\nWhen are you gonna act? When am I going to act? Yeah.\n\nI've had so many opportunities. I keep getting scared. I'm going to do it next time, though.\n\nYeah, do it next time. Getting scared next time. Rooting you on.\n\nYeah. You got it. Euphoria season 18 I'm on you.\n\nImagine if you've been scared in the past. You wouldn't have been where you are today. Okay, I'm not going to.\n\nUm, Mel Robbins, you right now. Let's get back to tan. Thank you so much.\n\nThank you guys so much. Thank you so much. Hi, Lil NAS x.\n\nGosh, that man's handsome. Um. Wow.\n\nGorgeous. Everyone, check out Cynthia. She's always got a look.\n\nShe's one of the best dressed on every red carpet, if not the best.\n\nUm, and this is her third look of the night. She wore two looks at the Oscars, and now she's giving us this drama.\n\nLook at that pose, too. Magical. Magical.\n\nOkay, so we've compared, uh, last year's locks or her past Vanity Fair locks.\n\nIf you see the side of the screen on the right, you'll see what she's worn in the past and she's worn Louis Vuitton in 2024.\n\nIn 2022. Actually, this is the Louis Vuitton look that she wore in 2022.\n\nUm, and the one you just saw was the. Wow. I'm going to repeat that for you.\n\nThis one here is from 2022. And the one with the red backdrop is from 2024 that we saw last year.\n\nAnd she looked gorgeous. Um, and I'm going to throw back to the girls who are with.\n\nLet's see. I can't see I can't see who she's with. Let's see.\n\nShe's with Rachel outside. I will never forget you should. Girls here with Rachel.\n\nWe're literally forgot we were what we were doing as a job. We are here with Rachel Sennott, who's\n\neverywhere right now and is currently going viral for admitting that she's on beta blockers.\n\nAnd, you know, we're on beta blockers. We're strong believers in it. Yeah I didn't.\n\nAre people reacting like it's a big deal? I actually I don't look at the comments. I'm not allowed to.\n\nBut me neither. I think it's a chill, natural thing. Better than heroin.\n\nNatural thing. It truly is. Let me just say it's not something where you\n\nfeel like good, but you just don't feel bad. That's what it is. You don't feel I'm.\n\nI'm literally numb from the neck down. But you know, what I appreciate is we have so much pressure all the time, and people like\n\nto be like, oh, I'm just being me. No, you're like, it gets nerve wracking. And sometimes I pop a pill.\n\nYou can't just raw dog life. That's crazy. No, I'm not being me.\n\nI don't know who this is, but I'm being someone.\n\nI'm obsessed with this dress. You and your stylist, Jared Ellner, are crushing it.\n\nWhat do you tell him before an event to pull off these outfits? Do you have, like, a specific vibe where\n\nyou're like, this is what I want to give tonight? Yeah.\n\nSo, okay. Jared is a genius. Yeah, I would say I want to like Jared, and I\n\nwill mood board. Like, sometimes he'll come over to my house, and then we'll just pull a bunch of photos.\n\nLike, let's just Pinterest a quesadilla. Yeah. But I will say Jared has the vision.\n\nLike he always I'm like, you're amused. He shows me something, and sometimes I'll be like, I don't know.\n\nAnd then I put it on and I'm like, you're a genius. Also, Rachel is hysterical, but also, like,\n\niconically beautiful. You're known for your pout. Can you teach us how to do your iconic pout?\n\nLet's do it in the camera. Like, how do we pull it off? I would say so what?\n\nWhat side of your face do you like better? This. We've been over this.\n\nNo, we've been fighting about it. Okay, so do your favorite side of the face. Okay.\n\nChin down. A little kind of dead eyes. Dead.\n\nAnd then. Sorry, I can't talk because I'm doing it, so.\n\nOh, I feel like I feel like we got the energy of it, though.\n\nBlow out of the lips. I think we got it. I'm obsessed.\n\nAlso, as a comic, you're chatty. You're a yapper. So am I.\n\nTotally. Are you yapping to people in there, or are you playing it cool to everyone?\n\nAre you kidding me? I can't not yeah, yeah. I mean, if you're not yapping, you're not\n\nyapping. Are you alive? You're not living, you know.\n\nRachel Sennott, get out there. We love you. We can't wait to watch your new show coming\n\nout. I'm so excited. Thank you.\n\nThank you, guys for coming. Back to you. Thank you for shopping with us.\n\nAnd we have all been heartbroken by the devastating fires that have ravaged Los Angeles.\n\nFrancesca is with one local organization aiding in the recovery.\n\nI'm here with Nora and Kelly from the incredible organization Baby to Baby. We all know that the Oscars celebrate the\n\nbest performances. What is the best act of kindness that you've witnessed recently?\n\nWell, baby to baby. We've had so many people coming to volunteer to help the cause, coming to donate supplies,\n\nbut also providing, you know, funds and emergency essentials to baby to baby and the families and children we serve.\n\nPeople have been coming in to volunteer just in droves from across the country and here in LA, but also people who even lost their own\n\nhomes have been showing up for us to support the families affected by the Eaton and Palisades Fire.\n\nSo it's been really incredible to see. That's amazing. That's beautiful.\n\nVanity Fair is thrilled to be partnering with Baby to Baby this year, and you've all done so much for children and families here in LA.\n\nCan you tell us a little bit about your work so far?\n\nAbsolutely. We're so grateful to Vanity Fair for the resources for coming in and rolling up their\n\nsleeves. And helping baby to Baby provides emergency essentials to children and babies in\n\nparticular. And so already in the last eight weeks, we've distributed 12 million items, including\n\ndiapers, wipes, hygiene products, blankets, strollers, cribs, clothing and those are going to children and families and babies\n\nimpacted by both the Eaton and Palisades fires.\n\nWow. That's amazing. And now that the LA community is turning\n\ntoward rebuilding, What plans does baby to baby have for the future?\n\nWell, we know from our disaster response because we've been doing it for over ten years that families really need help for\n\nmonths and years to come. It's not just these eight weeks, I mean, and immediately, obviously, we were able to\n\ndistribute these emergency supplies to children and families.\n\nBut this will continue and our work will continue for a long time to come. It's a long road ahead for families,\n\nespecially who've lost their homes, their jobs, their livelihoods. So baby to baby will be here.\n\nAnd we can't thank Vanity Fair enough for the incredible support they've given.\n\nThank you Francesca. We are with the one and only Jeremy Pope. This is what my husband wants to do to me\n\nwhen I get too chatty. That's. You look incredible.\n\nWhat is the story of that? What is the story tonight? I'm feeling inspired.\n\nI'm feeling creative. I'm in my Dune era. We're celebrating Dune.\n\nNo, it's. It was a fun look that I love. It's Egan lab.\n\nI pulled it to myself, you are wearing like, are these heels or platforms like a Rick Owens?\n\nCan I, can I lift a little? Okay. Yeah.\n\nNow are they comfy? Are they are a big old chunky platform okay.\n\nAnd if you get tired in the party, you can just literally wrap that around your head. And if you don't want to talk to people, just\n\ncover it up. Wait. I love a man wearing at least some platforms\n\nbecause we're this close to tearing an ACL at all times, and Men Don't Understand has never been the same.\n\nNo, if Prince can do it, then we should all be able to do it. I love Prince, he was a big inspiration in\n\nthis look tonight. Yes. Oh my God.\n\nUm, also, do you get annoyed with people saying your eyes are beautiful?\n\nI appreciate it, that wasn't a compliment. No, you were just saying that was a statement.\n\nJust a statement. I am very grateful. No, JP, we love you.\n\nThank you for coming and getting that party. You're awesome. So much fun.\n\nAh, JP, which does sound like a lacrosse player. JP I did, um, tan back to you.\n\nGood one. Hannah, thank you so much. I am now joined by Conan and his lovely wife,\n\nLiza. Hi, guys. It's a big night for you.\n\nYeah, it was a lot of fun. Yeah, it was fun. Yeah, it was really fun.\n\nOkay. Was it fun going in, or is it fun now that it's over?\n\nUh, it was fun when you get to hit the stage. Okay. And then before.\n\nThat is a lot of worrying and work. Okay. A lot of worrying and work.\n\nAnd Liza was very patient. Well, the funny thing is, last couple of months, because I've been a little bit of a\n\nmental case, but once you get on the stage and you're ready, it's fun.\n\nConan, um, I know that this is about you right now, but I need your wife's opinion.\n\nCan you tell me the real, real. What's he like preparing for something like this?\n\nIs he wildly frustrating at home? Not frustrating, not frustrating, not frustrating.\n\nJust very. I have my moments. Does he does he hard working and focused?\n\nAre you his sounding board? Not alone. There are many people who make up the sound.\n\nShe's not the only sounding, but I try a lot of material out on on Liza. But are you honest?\n\nIf you're not feeling something he's going to include. Oh, God.\n\nYeah. No, we had a joke, which I won't repeat, but are you sure you can?\n\nIt's a safe space here. No, no, no, I don't trust you. I don't trust any of you.\n\nUh, but, um, Liza was like, nah, I don't think that's the right way to go. And she was right, and she was right.\n\nAnd it was a joke that the writers really liked. But we got I got rid of it because you\n\nweren't feeling it, and I'm really glad I did. Every writer's favorite way.\n\nNow tell me when you watch him, when he starts to present. Sorry.\n\nWhen he starts to host the Oscars, are you sat there thinking, come on, you can do it. You can do it.\n\nLike, are you a proud, never nervous. Wow. Not at all.\n\nWow. I have faith in him above pretty much anything else.\n\nWill you marry me? Absolutely. I'm a very homosexual man, but very welcoming\n\nin this relationship. It could be a throuple I would love. I've always wanted to be a throuple.\n\nAnd I love my husband. He's great, but he's okay in my life. He's all right.\n\nHe lives for my life. I want to just talk about your hair before we kiss you off.\n\nYeah. Your hair's not as high as it typically is. And I need you to know that I had very high\n\nhair. Also, you know it. It's the weather.\n\nOkay. And my hair is barometric. My hair is barometric.\n\nSo when the hair. When it's humid, when it's just right, it fluffs up, and then it can fall down\n\nsometimes. Conan, you. I don't know if you know, but I had a version\n\nof your hair, so I'm on a Netflix show, and people used to compare me to you constantly. I was the Brown Conan.\n\nYes. And then only a few months ago, I changed it. My question before you leave is, would you\n\never go for something a little different other than the quiff? I think it's too late.\n\nI did it. I went with this a long time ago, and there's nothing we can do.\n\nAll right, all right. Well, on that, we'll let you go. Thank you so much for a lovely evening.\n\nCongratulations for tonight. That's amazing. And thanks for having us.\n\nLovely to meet you. Thank you so much. Thank you everyone.\n\nNow we're going back to Hannah and Bedhead.\n\nThe best of me. I am newly in the Redhead Club. Yes.\n\nWelcome, welcome. Hi. It's nice here.\n\nI do have to say, I watched your documentary on Amazon Prime.\n\nI was so inspired. After that, I wanted I could take over the world.\n\nI'm so sorry. What was your inspiration behind this? Yeah, I just really wanted to give.\n\nLike, she's baring it all at Vanity Fair. Eco friendly. You're crushing.\n\nShe's definitely giving poison ivy. Yes, yes, yes. Green is crushing it.\n\nAnd I love a feather I freakin love. Look at that. The body is body.\n\nNo. It's body. Oh, my God, I'm obsessed.\n\nSo when you go in this party, are you dancing or are you just holding it tight? Posing.\n\nI'm not going to lie to you. I'm standing still. I'm giving statue.\n\nI'm giving Oscar. I feel like they have to pay to, like, see you perform.\n\nI told you that was a different live stream. Yeah, yeah. Don't.\n\nDon't do that for free. That's crazy. I do it for the hotties everywhere, though.\n\nYeah, yeah. No, you do it for the girls. And we appreciate that.\n\nYeah. You give so much confidence to women everywhere.\n\nWhat do you do when you're not feeling confident? I start my day with you and only you.\n\nOh my God. I'm gonna cry. Don't cry.\n\nWe're lying. No I know. No.\n\nYour music has literally, like, made me want. When I want to fight someone. I listen to your music.\n\nYou want to throw that fighting out the window, and you want to get cute and be a bad.\n\nWhen people are talking, I go turn on Megan. Body ody ody. I look beautiful.\n\nI look so great. Wait. No.\n\nYou look so good when you're. But I know because I watched your documentary.\n\nYou've been through so many dark things. How do you get yourself up and inspire people?\n\nI've never seen her this passionate. I just look in the mirror and I'll be like, damn you, that girl.\n\nYeah, right. Yeah, you are that girl. So go outside and act like you're that girl.\n\nNo, we love you. That's how I tackle my day. That I'm crying would be the one that made me\n\ncry. I'll take my pictures. Don't cry.\n\nCry. Do you cry a lot? I do cry.\n\nI'm a crier, I love that. What's your sign? I'm an Aquarius.\n\nOh, I don't cry much when I cry for a reason. Yes, you let it go. Well, keep, keep like letting it all into\n\nyour music. Never, never, never stop. I want to know.\n\nThat was so good. Come on girl. No.\n\nI know we've been staring yourself all the time. Meg, what are you wearing, though?\n\nWhen you're, like, just writing new music. What are you wearing? Big t shirt and panties.\n\nA big t shirt. Like, with stains on it and stuff. No.\n\nNo stains. Oh, sorry. That was me.\n\nLike the perfect big getting ready t shirt. No, just a plain white t shirt. Yeah, or like a graphic T or something.\n\nOne of my favorite celebrities on it or something. Okay.\n\nMy panties. Yeah, yeah, you are, as you should. Your thong.\n\nGranny thong. Always okay. Cheeks always out.\n\nCheeks out. Um, Meg, go in there. You've spent way too much time with us.\n\nWe love you so much. Somebody said they stole my place in line, I gotta go.\n\nOh, oh, oh, I think we should end every stream with cheeks. I'm joined by John Mulaney and Olivia Munn.\n\nWelcome. Thank you for being here. You've been part of iconic SNL moments.\n\nHow did it feel to be back for the 50th anniversary special? Are there any behind the scenes memories that\n\nyou're still laughing about? Um, there was a great pep talk in the cue card department before we started the three\n\nhour show, where they had stacks of cue cards about as high as me and Wally.\n\nThe cue card guy told everyone to just have fun. And everyone laughed because no one was\n\nreally going to have fun until the show was over. The show is over.\n\nYeah. That's great. And John, your Netflix talk show is coming\n\nback in a few weeks. If you could have any guest on the show, living or dead, who would be your dream to\n\ninterview and why? Oh, that's a good question. David Bowie would be my dream guest.\n\nOh, yeah. Yeah, that's a really good one. Yeah, yeah.\n\nAnd between the two of you, who's more likely to end up leading the charge to the dance floor tonight.\n\nIt would be me. 100%. But everyone knows that on site.\n\nI love that. Thank you both so much. Have an amazing night.\n\nHave a great night. Nice to see you. Nice to see you.\n\nOh my goodness. We're live. We are live with the one and only Nate\n\nBargatze, who's changing the world for comedy right now.\n\nThey don't let most comedians in, especially stand ups, because most of us are dirty. Yeah.\n\nHow did you get into this event? You know, I got I got invited this year, I got invited, I feel I still have it.\n\nSo I feel like this is the gateway to the Oscars. Yeah.\n\nSo if you can get here. Yes. Then maybe five years from now, I can get\n\ninto five years, like. Yeah. I figure it's a long plan, but, yeah, I'll be\n\na good game. It's a long game. Yeah.\n\nYeah. So how involved is your wife? Your wife in your fits?\n\nLike, does she give opinions? Yeah, she helps me out. Like she said, put that brooch on and you\n\nsaid okay. Oh, yeah. Yeah.\n\nI wouldn't have even known that was a brooch if you wouldn't have pointed at it. I would have been like, I don't know what\n\nshe's talking. I go, I go, she's a page, right? Pages.\n\nLose her mind here. Lost her mind. I won't make you spell it, but yeah.\n\nNo, it is a brooch. I saw a lot of people had them. Yeah, there's a lot of guys.\n\nWell, actually, not a lot of people did, because you're wearing it now. All the men are going to start wearing them.\n\nYeah, yeah. Out of the bar. Trendsetters.\n\nThis is where it starts. At the bar. Do you ever.\n\nDo you ever come to these events and you're like, wow. I'm like one of the only comedians.\n\nDo you ever say a joke that just, like, doesn't land with all the respected actors? Yeah, yeah.\n\nI mean, if they don't know the context of, like, me being a comic, you can say something, especially a long story that can.\n\nOh, yeah. That's hard. Like, you will know when you know it's not\n\ngoing to hit even really hear you. You get out of it. They get their security and they're like, can\n\nyou get this guy? I'll wait till someone drags him off, and then I get back to them and go, let me finish\n\nwhat I was. Yeah. Let me get back into it.\n\nSo he golfs with some very famous people all the time.\n\nUm, do you have any advice for dealing with pressure on the golf course and on stage?\n\nBecause you're a calm man. You're a calm man. Like I gotta call you the Ice Man.\n\nIs that. Do they? Yes.\n\nAll right. Oh, God. He lived right.\n\nYeah. I don't know who he is. Uh, the ice man.\n\nWell, isn't that is that, uh, Top Gun?\n\nNate, you've already lost me. I was just trying. Yes, I'm the iceman.\n\nI mean, how do you stay calm before all these intense SNL monologue? Yeah.\n\nIt's, uh, you know, you prepare. Yeah. That's all you do.\n\nIf I get out of the preparation, I'll be in big trouble. And you study hard.\n\nHe goes. Maybe work hard for once. Maybe try a little harder.\n\nYeah. Just give it a shot.

She never says that. And I never compliment a man.\n\nIt's against my religion. I really I can't do it. Oh, my velvet, the satin.\n\nOh, it's so good. I appreciate it. Brunello Cuccinelli, are you single?\n\nI'm not. I'm very married. Oh.\n\nMe too. Very happy. What?\n\nWhat do I not look like? I could trap a man.

This looks good.\n\nI love it. So, did you want the red or did your stylist force it on you?\n\nIt looks great. I didn't mean it like that. Yeah, I don't know that.\n\nI thought about the pocket square, to be honest with you. The red is a nice pop, though.\n\nIt does look good. That's how you know. You didn't think about it.\n\nYou didn't even know he was wearing one. Alessio, over at Brunello and Jason Bolden, my stylist, they they they they conspired and\n\ncollabed and then they sent it to you. This whole thing. They said, hey, put this on.\n\nYou said, okay. And I said, okay. Yeah.\n\nHow many different glasses do you own?\n\nWe've all been wanting to know a lot. Yeah, I only take pictures in glasses. Yeah, I'm not sure why.\n\nIt makes you look like you know something we don't know. Yeah.\n\nWhat are you preparing? It's like. It's like the English.\n\nIt's like. It's like my version of a British accent. Yes yes yes yes yes yes.\n\nWho sounds so clever and witty? Everything he says sound unprepared because we don't have accents.\n\nWait. My brother. Oh, that's my brother from another.\n\nHe's running over my guy. Come on. He's literally just jumped over Kylie Jenner.\n\nNo, I'm just kidding. And now the men are hugging, and now the men are hugging.\n\nI thank you so much for coming out. Yeah. Thank you for stopping by.\n\nI'm not really sure why I came over here, but we don't. We're sorry.\n\nThree minutes of. You can yell at your publicist after because that's what she said.\n\nTraumatizing. And we get it. Three minutes that he'll never forget.\n\nThat's what she said. Get out of here. All right, I'm out, I'm out, I'm out.\n\nOh, get out of here with your pocket square. Oh my God. Wait.\n\nNow we're joined by the one and only Tinashe. Oh my God. A vision.\n\nA vision. No, do not apologize to us. This corset is insane.\n\nI think it's insane. No, it's the texture. The color, the fit.\n\nIt's gorgeous. I feel like my rib cage is, like, overlapping right now.\n\nI'm obsessed. Wait, you have a sexual energy I can. It's radiating off you.\n\nNot only on the carpet, but in your music. Have you always, like, had just been sexy?\n\nHonestly, I feel like music is a great outlet for me to, like, bring that sex appeal, that ego, that alter ego.\n\nHonestly, I feel like in my day to day life, I'm like very chill, very toned down. Yeah.\n\nAnd so, like with my music, I feel like I can, like, walk, you know. So okay, you say like in your day to day,\n\nyou're toned down. So like, you're not going to the grocery store in this.\n\nUnfortunately not. What's your like normal day style. Like on sweatpants?\n\nYeah. Sweatpants. Hoodie.\n\nYeah. All the things. Like the comfiest clothes, no bra.\n\nYeah. So do you like getting dressed up for stuff like this, or are you, like, my feet hurt?\n\nI mean, it's nice. It's nice to be able to, like, have the range.\n\nYeah, the range to do both. Get a girl who can do both. Who do you like better?\n\nMusicians or actors? I thought you were gonna say me or you. And I was like, please answer.\n\nWe're live.\n\nWe are not going to tell anyone. We won't tell. I honestly, I actors are kind of chill, I\n\nlike them. Yeah. I do have to say.\n\nYeah. Musicians, some of them are a little. They are larger than life at times.\n\nYou have a lot of feelings they can be. I was going to say they can be quite emotional.\n\nOh my God, I dated one. He cried so much, but it was my fault. Yeah.\n\nWhen you go in there, what's your vibe? Are you a wallflower? Are you dancing?\n\nI'm going straight for the champagne. Yes. I'm gonna hit the dance floor.\n\nYes. Where I should be? Yes.\n\nJust bopping and grooving. I love it so much. Are you going to ask for a selfie from\n\nanyone? Or is that like, oh my gosh, I am so not the ask for selfies type.\n\nYeah, neither are we. Like in the bathroom in there. Are you ever just like, oh, and that's\n\nKendall Jenner chill. I'm like, oh my God, I've seen you all. You're all friends.\n\nYou're like, does anyone want a tampon? Yeah. Yeah, exactly.\n\nYou're like, everyone's a human inside. I'm like, oh my God. But you know, keep it chill.\n\nYeah. You always look so good with your fists. Are you very opinionated with your stylist?\n\nLike, I want to wear this. Yes, definitely. You have to be girl.\n\nYou have to be especially. I feel like once you've done a couple of carpets and you come out looking crazy.\n\nYeah, you know that you can't do that anymore. And you have to be kind of decisive.\n\nWell, you crushed it tonight. You truly did. We loved you so much.\n\nLook so beautiful. Thank you so much. So much fun in there.\n\nAnd we love your freckles. Yes. You could not be cuter.\n\nThank you so much. Thank you so much. Have fun and.\n\nYeah. Have fun. Get out of here.\n\nThank you so much for being here. Um, John, we've seen you at a few Vanity Fair parties.\n\nAre there any standout moments that still make you laugh when you think about them? I was here for the slap.\n\nWe were here for the slap. We were here for the mix up. The La La Land mix up.\n\nSo yeah, there's been quite a few standout moments in the bathroom during this lap. Yes, I was in the in the bathroom for both of\n\nthose, but I saw the aftermath. Yes, Ron Howard gave us the play by play. Never go to the bathroom at the end of the\n\nshow. It's going to. It's going to come back to haunt you.\n\nYeah. Oh my gosh, that's wild. Um, and you've both done drama and comedy.\n\nIf you could swap roles with one of your characters for a day, who would it be and why?\n\nOh, jeez. I mean, I don't think I'd want to swap characters, swap places with Don Draper.\n\nThat'd be a real bummer. Um, but I don't know, maybe. Maybe the guy in in Top Gun.\n\nThat'd be pretty fun. Run an aircraft carrier or something?\n\nI have to say, my character from Mad Men, because that would be great.\n\nThat's a good one to be in 1970. In Big sur. So it sounds like a fun time.\n\nYes. Thank you guys so much for being here. Have an amazing night.\n\nYou look. You look amazing. Thank you.\n\nYes. Beautiful color. I am now joined by the hottest couple in\n\ntown. Actually, in the world. We have dove, Cameron and Damiano.\n\nHello, guys. How are you? We're so good.\n\nHow are you? Very well. Thanks.\n\nQuestion. Did we plan the outfits together? Did we want to coordinate?\n\nYes. I knew I was going to be all black. And he.\n\nHe had a secret wish for me also to be all black. Do you typically get to decide first?\n\nI had a fever dream. I came to her and I was like, I want to be like the Beckhams.\n\nWow. So that we're we're working on it. That's a really good inspo.\n\nThat's a wonderful inspo. Now we off camera, we were talking about this and I just want to hit it real hard.\n\nYour style evolution, you were always great, but you were grungier and now you're going for a lot more classic.\n\nWhat was the what was the the impetus for this?\n\nUh, it looks like we are a new band, but we've been actually doing it for quite a lot, and I just need.\n\nI just felt like I needed something different and I needed to be more focused on, like, what I really want to do.\n\nIt's so chic. It's almost like 50s inspired that you're that you're rocking now.\n\nI love it so much, dove. I know we all know what a rock star you are, but is it awkward when you're, like, at a\n\nconcert and everyone's going nuts for this one? No, not at all.\n\nI'm usually the one going the most nuts. I listen, I'm just as obsessed, so I totally get it.\n\nI can listen, I would love to really talk to you, dove, but it's really hard to look at. If you could see close up what I'm seeing,\n\nit's so difficult to look at her. Brown people don't blush easily. But under my skin.\n\nYou are a knockout. Me knockout. It's fine.\n\nI'm a very gay man. He's perfectly safe. I've never dabbled in that.\n\nRight. Do you know Teyana Taylor, by any chance? Yes.\n\nYou're absolutely beautiful. Hi. Come say hi.\n\nJoin us. Hi, love. Hi.\n\nOkay, I'm gonna let you guys. I'm gonna let you guys go. Thank you for joining me.\n\nIt was so good to meet you both. Can I get one mic? Yes.\n\nLovely to see you guys, darling. Hello, darling. How are you?\n\nOkay, I'm going to help you talk. Talk to me about this number.\n\nHold on. What's going on? I see some needle and thread.\n\nOh, no. Okay, listen. In the car.\n\nI'm gonna. I'm gonna do this. Oh, damn.\n\nThe back's even better. Are you willing to show the back?\n\nYou guys, can we see that on camera, please? Damn.\n\nHave you seen that? Okay. Who are we wearing?\n\nLaquan smith. Oh, we love Laquan Smith. Is this custom?\n\nYes, it is runway. Okay. Question.\n\nYou've been to this event many times. Yes. Are you still intimidated by that?\n\nYes I am. See, I'm, like, nervous right now. I'm so shy and people don't know that I don't\n\nbelieve in Red Carpet. I'm trying to practice how I'm going to post up, like, okay, do I stand like this?\n\nDo I? Okay, here's the problem. So I practice my poses in the mirror.\n\nAnd then as soon as I get onto the red carpet and they're shouting, you forget it all. They'll be like, can you stand right here?\n\nI'll be like, okay, I know. And you look back thinking, that was one of my poses, man, it's a dirty game.\n\nWhy do we work on right now? You acted last year or the year before?\n\nLast year. Okay. Are we working on a new movie?\n\nWorking on a new project. Are we focusing on music?\n\nEverything. Yeah, I actually have three movies coming this year.\n\nAnd a show with Ryan Murphy I'm very, very excited about. Where are you finding the time?\n\nOh, baby, I don't even know. You're working every hour that God sends. Yeah.\n\nI'm, like, literally filming multiple things at once. And.\n\nAre you recording my music? Um.\n\nStay tuned. Let's see. That's a yes.\n\nThat's a yes, folks. We know how to read through that. Thank you so much.\n\nOkay, read the carpet. I'm gonna to try and get too many secrets out if I don't let her go.\n\nSo, Tiana, I'm gonna kiss you off for now. You look gorgeous. Thank you.\n\nThe incomparable Tiana.\n\nWe are so excited to be here with Michelle Rodriguez.\n\nWhat up? Okay, I can't drive. I don't have my driver's license.\n\nAn interview question, am I right? Do you have any advice for looking cool when driving?\n\nUh, do it right. Don't like hit people and stuff? Yeah, don't hit people.\n\nKeep your eye on the road. Keep your emotions to yourself.\n\nWell, we just found out she's from Jersey, so. And they learned that in Jersey to keep their\n\nemotions to themselves. I'm super stoked. You know, we got a Jersey boy as a winner for\n\nbest picture today. Yes. No.\n\nThat's so exciting. I love new Jersey I love Sean Baker, he's awesome.\n\nYes. Represent Sean so good. And how do you think the accents were?\n\nBecause I'm from Brooklyn too, and I thought they nailed it. It was pretty intense.\n\nYeah, yeah I he has a he has a tendency to pick like real, real people for the role. And then, you know, they always just come to\n\nthe table with great performances. I think every film that he's ever directed, he's just really he just knows how to capture\n\ntruth. You know what I mean? And you can feel it when you watch any of his\n\nfilms. So yeah, I'm super happy for him. Yes.\n\nShout out to Sean and Michelle. You've taken on so many badass female roles. Is there something you look for in particular\n\nwhen you're, like, reading scripts? Yeah. You know, because.\n\nBecause of the last name. Yeah. And because I'm a woman I've always had to\n\nbattle for the last 25 years. Cartels. Hookers.\n\nUm, maids. Anything that's poverty porn.\n\nSo I stay away from all that stuff. I basically, you know, I don't like to, uh, representation matters.\n\nIt really does. Well, what you're saying, what you're doing with your presence, I think matters.\n\nYou know, if I were, like, if everybody were doing, you know, amazing work and we had lots of representation.\n\nI could probably be an actress and not so much an activist, but for the last, you know, 25 years that's been pretty much my you're\n\nvery purposeful with the roles you take, for sure. I kind of have to be because nobody, you\n\nknow, there's not a lot of people doing it. So you got to kind of like, and you do not want to be just.\n\nYeah, squared into one place. Yeah. Yeah, yeah.\n\nNo. And speaking of not boring. No, we have to talk about your fashion\n\nbecause the cape. I'm obsessed. It's so powerful.\n\nAnd I love that. It's, like, tight and then, like, flaring out a little.\n\nAnd this is the color of the season. You're so on trend. Yeah.\n\nHow did you pick this? Was it between a couple or. You know Hugo is amazing.\n\nAnd he's he's the fantastic genius behind it all.\n\nBecause you know me, I'm such a tomboy. No, you wouldn't know it in this dress. You wouldn't know it.\n\nGorgeous. Is there a story behind this necklace? Because it's cool.\n\nYeah. Um. So, um, Basically, I get this jewelry from\n\nthis Polish designer who 3D prints everything. Wait.\n\nSo cool. Macabre. And so I have all of his jewelry remade in\n\ngold and silver. Wow. A true Jersey girl.\n\nA jersey figuring it out. Michelle, keep rocking it. I'm obsessed with you.\n\nI look up to you and have fun inside, okay? Beautiful night. Thank you for stopping by with us.\n\nThank you. Tan. Back to you.\n\nOh. Thank you.

Yeah, basically, babies are in bed.\n\nI get it. It really is what it is. Like.\n\nYou put your kids to bed and you're like, now it's our time. What do Mom and dad do on a night off other\n\nthan this? Oh, well, we have too much fun.\n\nNever too much, I'm sure. We love our good date nights. We love a good meal.\n\nThat's like my love language. I love good food, but can you go out or do you have people in?\n\nWe go out. Yeah we do. We do a date night every Friday.\n\nSo we make sure that we spend that quality time, which is good, especially when she's looking like this and wearing this kind of\n\ndress. Listen, I have been a gay man my entire life, but Sierra is one of the very few people on\n\nthis planet I've seen thinking, what is it about this lady that's doing something to my heart?\n\nI don't know. Since I was a kid, you've been. Oh, just phenomenal.\n\nCan you talk about what's going on in your life right now when it comes to work? Oh my gosh, so much.\n\nI'm excited.

But I have a new song called ecstasy coming up, and it is the ultimate just everything.\n\nIt's like the big sister to my song Ride and Promise for my die hard fans, and I'm super excited for it.\n\nSo videos, grinding everything, my skincare OEM, my rum 10 to one loving on my amazing husband that you have been.\n\nAre you also her biggest fan when it comes to her music? Of course she plays.\n\nYou loved her music ever since. One, two step and goodies. Don't get me started.\n\nI think that we just have a great time just to be able to raise kids and do this. And obviously we're also getting the\n\nproduction space too, with new productions. And so we're getting going. We're excited about some things we have going\n\non.

Are you sweating?\n\nNo, no, he doesn't sweat. Colman Domingo doesn't sweat. Coleman.\n\nSweat. If you do anything illegal. No, there's no fingerprints.\n\nThat's why the gloves. Precisely. And that's why we're amateurs at these\n\nthings. You can't steal a snack. I need gloves here.\n\nI need gloves. You don't want to try better next year. That's why I came over here.\n\nI'm like, no gloves. And let's be honest, you don't want to touch us.\n\nBut you're not. We're mere mortals. We look like idiots without gloves.\n\nMore gloves. I'm out of here. We miss the glove memo.\n\nYeah. Yeah. All right, keep going.\n\nGet gloves. This was it. I think we've done it.\n\nYeah, we've done it. We did it. Thank you so much.\n\nThank you. Thank you so much. That was.\n\nOh my God. That was the best thing ever. I mean, yeah, great.\n\nI Oscar you're getting so into acting. You were just in the SNL movie. I was.\n\nAnd we were talking about. She loves comedians and comedy. I think you're going to have a stand up\n\nspecial soon. Absolutely not. That's why I'm friends with stand up\n\ncomedians, because they make me funnier. I was in bottom. You were incredible.\n\nI was in bottoms. Okay. I feel like people ask you this all the time,\n\nbut modeling or acting, you got to pick one. What are we doing? I couldn't possibly do that.\n\nThe thing is, you. All your actors are in campaigns, so, you know, you don't have to choose one.\n\nWow. She's right. All your favorite actors are on billboards.\n\nYou're right. You don't ever have to pick one thing. Being multi-hyphenate.\n\nUm, Kia. Thank you for having me. I can't believe, Colman.\n\nThank you for coming. That was amazing. That was pretty cool.\n\nThank you, thank you. Get out of here.

Thank you so much for being here.\n\nUm, do you have any group text chats still going from any of your projects? Oh, yeah, a bunch.\n\nI have one from Glass Onion that we still talk all the time. All of them.\n\nI think Edward is up for an award tonight. We're all very excited for him and for everyone.\n\nI have one for the studio. I think he just wants to talk to you about it.\n\nYeah. And, um. Uh, one for Agatha.\n\nYeah. I love a group chat after it's gone. I get very sad when something's over, so it\n\nmakes me happy to continue on with the group. It's like a family. Yes.\n\nIt is. Oh. That's amazing.\n\nAnd have you ever been to this party before? A few times, but it's every time as overwhelming as the time before.\n\nOkay. Just by the sheer amount of star wattage.\n\nYeah. It's true. It's true.\n\nConsolidated into one place. Yeah. It's overwhelming.\n\nI remember the first time I was like, I couldn't even make eye contact because it was too much in one room.\n\nIt's true. No, I know that's how I'm feeling.

Straight to series.\n\nSisters from another Mister. Hello. We are so excited to be here.\n\nI just want to say, Bowen and you as well. Did you guys just fly here from a second ago?\n\nIn the words of Taylor Swift. Yeah. Jet lag is a construct, a construct.\n\nHonestly, it's for mentally weak people. He got on a 6 a.m.. What is it, 6 a.m.?\n\nFlight to land. JetBlue. You're welcome.\n\nBecause you're a man of the people. I'm a man of the people. My carbon footprint is going to be\n\ndistributed evenly. Yes. Yeah.\n\nThere you go. It's important. Congrats.\n\nLast night was amazing. You two have incredible chemistry. Yeah.\n\nHow long? Now. Come on.\n\nHave you guys actually been friends? Like for real? The year 2008 and then 2009, you had a big\n\nfight when Pink Friday by Nicki Minaj came out.\n\nThat's when that's important. We really. That's your anniversary.\n\nYou're both off book on the same Nicki Minaj songs. And then it was like, okay, because our\n\nfriends were like, I was in the sketch group. He was in the improv group. We were both gay and they were like, be\n\nfriends. We're like, no, we're not going to be friends just cause we're gay.\n\nAnd then we were friends just for two. They're amazing. Podcast.\n\nI feel like, how the hell have we not met before? Have you been?\n\nI know, I know, it's rude. Okay, this is the scoop. We've been trying to get y'all on the podcast\n\nfor ages. No, no, we're coming tomorrow. We're coming, we're coming on it.\n\nWe're coming tonight. Yeah. This is a podcast.\n\nThis is the podcast. Record it actually. Yes.\n\nMe and Matt have hung out before. We've got. We've been in bed.\n\nIt's crazy. We've gotten in bed. I haven't even gotten a Snapchat.\n\nI haven't gotten anything in these streets. So you guys, when you go in there, do you approach people or just vibe alone?\n\nIt depends. We get a little brave. Like he had to convince me to go up to\n\nSebastian Stan number one talent crush. It was amazing. No, I need to go up to Sebastian Stan.\n\nI'm obsessed. Jawline. Look at us talking.\n\nWe forgot we're in. We're actually we're. This is a job we have to do.\n\nWe literally forgot when you guys go in there, we you when you guys go in there, do you separate like, do you break and then come\n\nback? No, no, I'm, I'm glomming on to this one. Come on.\n\nYeah, yeah. Who's more outgoing? It depends on the context.\n\nYou guys are both quite shy.\n\nYeah. You're kind of. You give wallflower.\n\nWait. Have you guys ever hooked up accidentally? No.\n\nNever. No. We keep it.\n\nWe're sisters. Us neither. But like, the night is young.\n\nYou got to talk to this. We're at Vanity Fair. You want to hook up with Amelia?\n\nI love how he's like. Please stop talking to us. No, no, no, we've been eating up so much\n\nairtime. You have to talk to her. No.\n\nAmelia, come. Hello. It's a literal party.\n\nOh, my God, all these funny hot people. I know it's too many. Too many hot, too many hot funny people.\n\nOh, we're getting there. We love you. Yeah, yeah.\n\nGood luck on your pictures. Good luck. I have to let you guys know.\n\nAmelia Dimoldenberg. And I love how they put how to pronounce my name.\n\nDemi Moore. And let's be honest, everyone, everyone says Amelia Demi Moore.\n\nAnd you know exactly who we're talking about. It's Amelia. Dims.\n\nAmelia dims. We went up to you two days ago and said, do you have any advice for the carpet?\n\nYeah. Can I tell you I was very starstruck meeting you the other night.\n\nI'm just very. Is that why I thought you were shy? I am shy, but I'm just very impressed by you.\n\nI was watching you on the television yesterday when I was trying to prep, and I was trying to relax, and you were just on\n\nBravo, and I was like, oh, my God, there you are. You relaxed.\n\nDid it relax you? Absolutely relaxed. Me.\n\nNothing like really hot, funny people in a house to relax me.\n\nNo. Amelia. How does it feel to be interviewed?\n\nYeah, guys, I feel like I'm like, I just had a tequila shot.\n\nI'm feeling. Where is everyone getting the tequila? Yeah.\n\nNo one's offered us over to us. I feel like. Yeah.\n\nYeah. I mean, but then, anyway, um, it feels great to be interviewed, actually, because it's a\n\nbit of a switch to me doing all the questions.\n\nCan I call it out, though? Amelia obviously crushing it in comedy. A journalistic icon, but fashion wise,\n\nyes, it's next level. I'm screenshotting all her looks. This is gorgeous.\n\nGuys, this has, like, texture to it. Yeah, I feel like they're not getting the vibe.\n\nYeah, it actually feels good. It's almost like an animal. It's giving the British JLo I said it.\n\nWait, what? I said. And now we've said it.\n\nObsessed. And now we've said it. Obsessed.\n\nI just said it. Okay. Obsessed.\n\nNow my head's gonna explode. Wait, how? How are you guys?\n\nSee? She's turning it. Turning it?\n\nNo one. No one's asked that yet. No one's asked us.\n\nAnd we haven't. We don't really like reflecting on our own feelings because then we get into a dark\n\nplace. It's true. But I feel like you're killing it.\n\nWe're trying our best, and we haven't looked at the comments yet. We'll find out soon.\n\nDon't read the comments. Our team is going like this constantly. Keep going.\n\nAmelia. Get in there and we'll ",

        "content": "Unexpected, sensorial ingredients, exceptional sunscreens, and an abundance of disappearing sheet masks were just a few of the treasures I expected to unearth in my exploration of K-beauty regimens—but I’ll admit the vast world of ingestibles caught me by surprise. Specifically, the best Korean collagen supplements are proving to be the real secret to achieving bouncy, supple skin.\n\nVogue’s Favorite Korean Collagen Supplements\n\n“Collagen is king!” Olive Kim, founder of two of Korean’s favorite supplement brands Clöud Café & Collagelée, tells Vogue, emphasizing that while topical collagen is a staple, we’ll be seeing the rise and innovation in ways to consume it (or inject it directly into the body). Remember, collagen is a structural protein rich in amino acids, found in abundance in the body. However, these levels decrease as we age—making replenishing those reserves integral to maintaining a youthful appearance. And because collagen is a larger molecule, thought as generally too large to be absorbed into skin topically, most health experts recommend ingesting it. “Collagen supplements may help improve skin elasticity and hydration by supporting the body’s natural collagen production,” registered dietitian and host of women’s health podcast, Flourish Heights Valerie Agyeman previously shared. She goes on to explain that collagen is by no means a quick fix, but it can help keep skin feeling and looking youthful.",

        "source": "https://www.vogue.com/",
        "content": "The internet’s current obsession? Protein. Starting the day off with enough protein—a.k.a. a breakfast with around 30 grams—can have a dramatically positive effect on your day. Studies show it can help one have a clearer mind, fewer PMS symptoms, more energy, and better concentration. Here’s how I was able to up my protein consumption, getting between 28 and 32 grams every morning. And after doing it for a month, spoiler alert: I have no plans to stop.\n\nWhy protein is so important\n\nMost people have already internalized the importance of a protein-rich diet: Protein supports the body in building and repairing muscles, skin, and organs and helps in the production of enzymes and hormones that control our metabolism and immune system.\n\nProtein is especially important for women because it helps regulate hormones like estrogen and progesterone, as well as plays a role in mood and sleep. A lack of protein can also lead to hormonal imbalances.\n\nHow to get 30 grams of protein at breakfast\n\nI used to eat a single boiled egg in the morning, which I now know is only 7 grams of protein. Here’s how I revamped my breakfast to make it bigger, better, and filled with lots of healthy, filling foods. I currently switch between three dishes:\n\nAn omelette made with three eggs, a cup of cottage cheese, and a side of cucumbers, avocado, and tomatoes\n\n8 ounces of full-fat Greek yogurt topped with flaxseeds, organic berries, and a tablespoon of almond butter\n\nA recipe by Seline Pettersen that I stumbled across by chance: Boil 50 grams of rolled oats in unsweetened almond milk, add half a banana and mash with a fork, mix in cinnamon and berries (frozen organic berry mix), and finish with 8 ounces of cottage cheese. Yes, the cottage cheese sounds out of place, and I was also reluctant at first. But the combination of sweet and salty is heavenly—and everyone who’s tried it so far confirms this!\n\nAll three breakfast alternatives can be varied using spices or by changing their preparation, and they keep me full for several hours.\n\nHow a protein-filled breakfast has changed my life\n\nEating such a protein-rich meal first thing in the morning or mid-morning definitely gives me more energy throughout the day, something I noticed on day one. I also realized I’m never distracted by snacks at work, and I feel full until lunch. Consuming a higher amount of protein in the morning has brought much more calm into my day.",

        "title": "10 Spring Beauty Trends of 2025, According to the Pros",
        "source": "https://www.vogue.com/",
        "content": "Ahead, all the leading spring beauty trends you need to know, according to the pros—plus how to achieve them yourself.\n\nPastel Colors\n\nPastels for spring? Groundbreaking. “While always a seasonal favorite, this year warm pastels are in queue to be the number one standout on faces,” Chanel makeup artist and groomer Tasha Reiko Brown says. “Warm pastels in dewy textures will take center stage, while chalky or milky tones will be passed over in favor of hues like peach, apricot, and coral. The perfect way to achieve this dewy look is to apply your eye shadow or blush in a single, diffused swipe over the eyelids and onto the apples of the cheeks.” Keep Ilia’s Eye Stylus Shadow Stick on hand in a hue like Nectar, which is a summery peach. Play up the color on the lips and cheeks, too, or give the nails a flowering touch with Chanel’s polish, available in a host of lively pastels.\n\nChanel Le Vernis Longwear Nail Colour in Immortelle $33 CHANEL Ilia Eye Stylus Shadow Stick in Nectar $32 ILIA\n\nRed Light District\n\nRed light therapy is by no means new technology, but in 2025 the space continues to innovate, with LED interest surging. For those not in the know, board-certified dermatologist Dr. Blair Murphy-Rose previously explained that “red light has been shown to reduce inflammation in the skin and to stimulate fibroblasts to produce collagen, which can reduce and prevent wrinkles and can improve skin texture.” Other light wavelengths like blue and near-infrared offer other benefits, from blemish control to reducing inflammation. This spring take your pick of the red light therapy devices currently available. Standouts on the market include Omnilux’s best-selling mask, which has earned the approval of board-certified nurse practitioner Dr. Catie Boucher, DCNP, FNP-C. “Aside from its 40 published clinical studies and FDA approval, it fits seamlessly into my life,” she says. You could also opt for CurrentBody’s neck and décolletage mask or hair-growth helmet (read our full review of the latter here).\n\nPowder 2.0\n\nCheek color has often been a toss-up between glow or matte. Cakey matte options have dominated in recent years, but this spring we’re embracing the best of both worlds. “The heavy matte moment is phasing out as we lean into a more fresh, approachable skin moment,” Jaikaran says. “The goal is always fresh, hydrated, and healthy skin—whether that’s through skin care or lightweight complexion products, the goal can be realized either way.” To achieve this glowy base with a blurred finish, reach for new-age powders atop a creamier makeup base. Minimal, finely milled setting powders along the undereye and T-zone or well-pigmented Saie powder blushes can achieve a soft focus without compromising radiance.\n\nReturn of the Sculpt\n\nWe’re sensing renewed interest in facial sculpting and depuffing—dare we say, trending upwards to the NuFace heyday? This spring everyone’s putting their best foot forward to alleviate puffiness via a host of face massagers. Board-certified physician assistant Paula Brezavscek, PA-C is partial toward Beautology Lab’s Cryo Toning Tools for lymphatic drainage, depuffing, and skin tightening. “These cryotherapy wands work wonders to calm inflammation, reduce fluid retention, and give your face a lifted, sculpted look,” she says. “Store them in the fridge for an instant cooling effect anytime your skin needs a refresh.” Our team, on the other hand, has a penchant for Therabody’s TheraFace wand, which treats skin with cold or heat therapy.\n\nSmudged-Out Liners\n\n“The softness of spring colors pairs perfectly with a soft-focus eye,” Brown says. “Smudged-out brown and copper eyeliners compliment warm, pastel cheeks and lips, as they add strong impact while being softer in dimension.” Opt for a creamy eye pencil like the Chanel Stylo Yeux Waterproof Long-Lasting Eyeliner in Brun Agapé or Espresso, or Victoria Beckham Beauty’s Satin Kajal Liner in Cinnamon, applied close to the lash line. Brown continues, “Then, with your ring finger or a small brush, subtly drag out the liner with a flick into a small wing. The point is to not be precise, as the result should be imperfect with soft-focus smudges. Finally, repeat this process on the bottom lash line for added easy drama.”\n\nLip Tints\n\n“Softer shades in softer textures are big for the warmth of spring,” says Brown. “Lip tints provide color in soft, sheer washes so that the lips have a transparent flush of color.” Embrace a more laidback approach to dressing the lips with these moisturizing, precision-free salves in peach, apricot, or coral shades, per Brown. A lip stain is an editor favorite, like Benefit Cosmetics’ Benetint, which subtly colors the lips for several hours of wear. Or enhance your pout with Chanel’s Rouge Coco Baume for more sheer color. “Really rub the lipstick into your skin to create a soft, long-lasting lip tint,” Brown concludes.\n\nWatercolor Blush\n\nThe blush trend for spring 2025? Watercolor flushes. “Diffused blush should mimic your natural flush, which tends to focus on the apples of the cheeks, with soft edges all around,” says Brown. “The best way to achieve this look is with a high blendable, dewy cream blush, like the N°1 de Chanel Lip and Cheek Balm in Vibrant Coral or Wakeup Pink or the Chanel Les Beiges Water-Fresh Blush in Light Peach or Warm Pink. Begin by buffing the product onto the apples of the cheeks backwards along the cheekbone. Then use any product remaining on your fingertips to tap the color onto the bridge of nose and chin for a soft color balance.” Or you could use a good powder brush to achieve that diffused finish. “Choose a loosely packed, fluffy blush brush and work in a soft buffing motion for easy diffusion. Be sure to tap the tops of the cheekbones with a transparent balm to provide an extra glow onto the cheeks,” says Brown.\n\nFull Body Care\n\nBody care as a larger beauty category rose to popularity in 2023, and we anticipate the interest to continue through spring. “We’re going to be paying more attention to our arms, our legs, stomach, neck, hands, wanting to deliver the same level of care to these areas as we are the face,” says board-certified dermatologist Azadeh Shirazi, MD, highlighting ingredients like retinol, vitamin C, peptides, and ceramides as essentials to find in your body-care products. “Body masks and sprays are another way to rejuvenate and smooth the skin, enhancing its the health and appearance.” U Beauty’s Resurfacing Compound is a great example of this—it’s packed with peptides, exfoliating acids, and retinol to make way for softer, smoother skin. Follow up with a glistening body oil like Costa Brazil’s Kaya Jungle Firming Body Oil—rich in vitamins A and E, plus omega-3, -6, and -9—to provide equal parts protection and radiance.\n\nBiotech Ingredients\n\nDr. Shirazi is predicting a surge of biotech ingredients such as exosomes, synbiotic skin care, and peptides coming to the forefront of the skin-care conversation. With formulations becoming more widely available to consumers, it’s inviting offerings once relegated to clinics and dermatology offices into the regimens of the masses as a form of upkeep or newfound skin repair. As far as the ingredients to be on the lookout for, Dr. Shirazi has a brief explanation of their efficacy. “Exosomes are the avatars of stem cells,” she says. “The skin’s microbiome is gaining more and more respect, as it plays such a crucial role in our skin’s health and well-being. Synbiotic skin care uses prebiotics to feed the nutrients to the good bacteria on your skin, making them grow and thrive.”\n\nMonotone Lids\n\nFrom twinkling shimmers to mattified washes, single shadows are taking over for spring. Perfect for accentuating the eyes with minimal effort but maximum payoff, all it takes is buffing on your favorite hue with your fingers or a brush. Take your pick of pastels and sweet hues by Chanel for a feminine touch, or lean into mauves, grays, and chocolate browns for night.\n\nChanel Ombre Essentielle Multi-Use Longwearing Eyeshadow $40 CHANEL Armani Beauty Eye Tint Longwear Liquid Eyeshadow $38 NORDSTROM\n\nSkin-Barrier Buzz\n\nSkin-barrier repair has become a sort of skin-care buzzword, but I’m actually okay with that because of its importance in your overall skin health. “Your skin is your largest organ and your first line of defense against the environment,” says Gunn. “When your skin barrier is compromised, you will notice acne, dryness, irritation, etc. More medical-grade skin-care brands are now creating products containing ceramides, niacinamide, and fatty acids to help strengthen and rebuild the skin barrier. Think of it as the foundation of your house—it has to be in great shape or everything else falls apart.” To ride the skin-barrier wave, pack your routine with plenty of nourishing products like InnBeauty Project’s Extreme Cream and Dr. Barbara Sturm’s new ceramide face oil, which will keep your skin glowingly soft and smooth well into summer.\n\nMeet The Experts",

If you or someone you know has been affected, click here to get six months of Slate Plus free.\n\nWhen I was growing up in Seattle in the 1990s, the city was shifting from the home of Nirvana and grunge music into a shinier, techier metropolis. A decade before Silicon Valley entered the general parlance, Seattle natives Bill Gates and Paul Allen were founding Microsoft and ushering in a new era of American innovation—and of the American ultrarich. For most of the period between 1997 and 2017, Gates was the richest man in the world, and Allen also amassed a large fortune. And with this new technological era came a new kind of billionaire: The nerd made good, who generally came along with a kind of bland good-guy libertarianism.\n\nMany of these early tech billionaires, Gates most prominent among them, were avid philanthropists too, giving away enormous sums and starting their own nonprofit entities. But by the time Amazon founder Jeff Bezos surpassed Gates as the world’s richest man in the 2010s, the tech billionaire vibes had shifted. Yes, the billionaire philanthropists carried on. But another group—call them the hostile libertarians—were growing in power. And it’s those men who now dominate the industry—and who are taking over American government and American media in a spectacular revenge of the nerds.\n\nThese men have largely rejected any obligation to public service, choosing to hoard their wealth or spend it on vanity projects rather than use it to aid the far less fortunate. They tend to adhere to a libertarianism that claims to stand for broad personal liberties and expansive rights to free speech. The problem, though, is that they are ultimately thin-skinned and morally immature. When they get into positions of power, their libertarianism morphs from “Freedom for All” to “Freedom for Me”—including freedom from criticism or complication. And with Donald Trump in charge, a man for whom “Freedom for Me but Not for Thee” is practically a lifelong mantra, we’re seeing these self-identified libertarians behave unapologetically illiberally.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTake Bezos. His politics have long seemed to be liberal-libertarian: He has donated to support same-sex marriage and lower taxes for the rich, and has given to Democratic politicians as well as Republican ones, along with the libertarian Reason Foundation. When he bought the Washington Post, he pledged to maintain its independence even under pressure. And by most accounts, he did—until Trump’s reelection loomed.\n\nIn a now-infamous move, he ordered the Post’s editorial board to scrap its endorsement of Kamala Harris, declaring that the paper would no longer back any political candidate. It’s an order that would be controversial at any point, but coming as it did, 11 days before an election, was a shocking overreach and resulted in a mass exodus of subscribers from the paper. Then, after Trump was elected, Bezos again used his position at the outlet to exert wildly inappropriate editorial control, sending a note to staff that read: “We are going to be writing every day in support and defense of two pillars: personal liberties and free markets. We’ll cover other topics too of course, but viewpoints opposing those pillars will be left to be published by others.” Those others? They can be found, he said, on “the internet.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne wonders which definition of personal liberties includes refusing to publish views at odds with the paper’s tech billionaire founder. Thanks to Bezos’ meddling, the Post is hemorrhaging subscribers. Many of its opinion writers have left. One has to imagine that, even though Bezos has not yet exerted control over the Post’s reporting, its journalists—who are among the best in the business—are anxious about what is to come and are looking elsewhere. The country may now lose one of its last great national newspapers: an outlet that broke the Watergate story, that provides unparalleled coverage of the nation’s capital, and that remains one of the last remaining publications to post correspondents overseas, bringing the rest of the world to American readers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf Bezos had any decency left, he would sell off the paper—or, better yet, create a trust that would fund it into perpetuity, then make his exit. But he seems more interested in pleasing Trump than in maintaining a newspaper that is foundational to the free press, a pillar of American democracy. This is an entirely self-serving decision. Bezos is transparently attempting to curry favor with Trump because of, one suspects, his interest in securing government contracts and possibly in being spared some pain in the trade war Trump wants to wage. (As Paul Krugman suggested back in November, one purpose of the Trump tariffs may be to allow the president, who can grant tariff exemptions to particular companies, to financially reward loyalists and punish dissenters.) To see his encroachments on the free press spoken of in the language of liberty and freedom is especially cynical.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis through-the-looking-glass definition of liberty is in line with how several other Trump-adjacent tech titans define freedom, which seems to be: Criticism of me trespasses on it; censoring views I disagree with does not.\n\nElon Musk, for example, is a self-styled “free speech absolutist.” When he bought Twitter and rebranded it as X, he criticized its content moderation policies and pledged that the site would no longer censor controversial views. “Free speech is the bedrock of a functioning democracy, and Twitter is the digital town square where matters vital to the future of humanity are debated,” Musk said when the acquisition was announced. He was right on both counts: Free speech is essential, and social media platforms, including Twitter, are modern town squares.\n\nRelated From Slate It’s Clearer Than Ever What Jeff Bezos Wants With the Washington Post Read More\n\nHis free speech absolutism, though, doesn’t seem to have been anywhere near absolute. X complies with most government requests to remove content, and it complies more often than the company did when it was still Twitter. Several journalists who cover Musk saw their accounts suspended after he took over. (Musk claimed, falsely, that those journalists shared “basically assassination coordinates” of where he was.) He permanently banned the account @ElonJet, which tracked the location of Musk’s private plane—information that is publicly available. But blatant white supremacists, Nazis, misogynists, and disinformation purveyors remain, because free speech. If X is a town square, it’s a pretty unpleasant one.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMusk has also said that he hopes individuals and organizations that publish media safety standards—and that tell companies which social media platforms are responsible and worthy of advertising on, and which are not—are criminally prosecuted (because, of course, these groups sometimes suggest that a platform home to members of various hate groups is maybe a bad bet for ads). He has asserted that journalists who publish stories he doesn’t like or thinks are incorrect should be fired or imprisoned. In this, he mirrors fellow tech billionaire and former PayPal collaborator Peter Thiel, who at once claimed to “strongly believe in the First Amendment” while secretly bankrolling the case that put Gawker out of business, because he didn’t like what it published.\n\nThis is, to be fair, a broader right-wing problem. Trump himself was elected by a modern right galvanized by an opposition to “cancel culture” and embracing the language of free speech, but in truth it seems eager to use claims of censorship primarily to gain power. With Trump in office, speech has been constrained in ways that are best characterized by various ignominious -ists: McCarthyist; fascist; and, with the attacks on education, language purges as a means of eliminating the ideologies behind them, and the elevating of true lie-parroting believers over competent and honest actors, approaching Maoist. The administration has a list of banned words, making verboten everything from diversity to gender. Mahmoud Khalil, a U.S. green-card holder and graduate student at Columbia University, was recently arrested by immigration officials and shuttled off in secret, seemingly for speech this administration has deemed antisemitic and a threat to national security (a designation not made of the various far-right figures in Trump’s orbit, including self-identified Christian nationalists, antisemitic conspiracy theorists, and men who throw up the Nazi salute). The arrest seems transparently politically motivated and intended to send a message: Protest, and you pay.\n\nHypocrisy from the MAGA movement and the Christian right is nothing new. Tech leaders, though, seemed to promise something different. Their money, the implicit argument went, shielded them from the concerns of mere mortals, and certainly of politicians. They could be advocates of ultimate freedom, and they could (literally) afford to be ideologically consistent.\n\nBut as we’re now seeing, commitment to a particular philosophy was never the real driver of these tech leaders’ views; selfishness apparently was.",

Irvin sketched an angular, armored military vehicle: the Casspir, a ubiquitous sight in the nation’s townships during the final decades of apartheid. The apartheid state deployed the Casspir to patrol and terrorize Black African communities in the name of keeping “peace.” Irvin’s drawing captured how, for Black people under apartheid, the hulking steel frame of the vehicle represented an intimidating and oppressive military intrusion into everyday life.\n\nDecades later, the Tesla Cybertruck, lately a prime target for protesters demonstrating their dislike of CEO Elon Musk, blurs the boundaries between the battlefield and the public street. When Tesla released the Cybertruck in 2023, its dramatic style polarized the public. Popular theories abounded about its unusual look. Many speculated that its inspiration had come from spaceships of science fiction. In discussing the car’s aesthetic early on, Musk referenced cyberpunk and Blade Runner, a film that features sleek metallic vehicles, though with rounded silhouettes designed for aerodynamic speed. He’s also used the phrase “The future should look like the future”—a reference, his biographer Walter Isaacson said, to a question his son Saxon asked him once: “Why doesn’t the future look like the future?”\n\nWhether or not this was intentional, the Cybertruck’s harsh, sharp edges remind us, instead, of something from the past: the larger armored personnel vehicles that patrolled streets throughout Musk’s youth in apartheid South Africa. In the 1980s, the Casspir proliferated across the country, moving from the battlefield and onto the streets. Initially improvised as a way to circumvent international sanctions against the apartheid government, the Casspir mine-resistant ambush protected vehicle was invented and produced domestically. It was a rugged all-terrain vehicle intended to withstand gunfire and mine explosions. It could drive up to 60 mph and be modified to add artillery functions.\n\nEventually, the Casspir was deployed to patrol townships, the residential neighborhoods where many Black South Africans lived. As violence and flames engulfed the streets of the nation, Black South African children like Irvin drew and wrote about the apartheid security forces and its tools—dogs and Casspirs—chasing and shooting at them in their schools, streets, and homes. By the 1990s, the Casspir had become an iconic global symbol of apartheid oppression.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMusk would have likely seen the Casspir vehicles in the South Africa of his childhood. He was born in Pretoria, one of the nation’s three capitals, during apartheid, in June 1971. When he was 5 years old, tens of thousands of Black South African children protested the government’s policy to impose Afrikaans, the Dutch-based language of the apartheid state, in schools. In Soweto, where Irvin lived, the South African police fired bullets into a crowd of unarmed, protesting children, killing scores of them. This episode became known as the Soweto uprising. It was one of many massacres.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAround 1985, when Musk was in his early teens, Oliver Tambo, the leader of the then-banned African National Congress, called for people to resist apartheid and “make South Africa ungovernable.” The apartheid regime called a state of emergency and decided to conscript white South African men 18 years old and above to serve in the South African Defence Force to protect its white citizens. In this effort, the SADF invaded, attacked, and killed apartheid’s “enemies” at home and abroad in Angola, Botswana, Lesotho, Mozambique, and Namibia.\n\nMusk left South Africa in 1988, after graduating from the prestigious Pretoria Boys High School, and a year shy of being subject to military conscription.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut South Africa is not the only place where military vehicles have roamed civilian streets. Over the past few decades, the U.S. military has been steadily off-loading military-grade equipment to U.S. police forces for use on domestic civilian populations.\n\nThe Casspir, too, is part of this story. In addition to shielding and supporting the apartheid government until the late 1980s, the U.S. purchased and deployed Casspirs during the second Gulf War invasions of Iraq and Afghanistan, before manufacturing its own Casspir-inspired mine-resistant ambush protected vehicles. These vehicles are part of the military-equipment transfers, and they now patrol American streets. We saw them during the spectacular use of force against Black Lives Matter protesters in places like Ferguson, Missouri.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRelated From Slate Why Elon Musk Is Attacking a Website That Used to Adore Him Read More\n\nAmerican pop culture across the political spectrum is infused with romanticized frontier violence and militarism, from camo and Americana fashion styles to gun culture and the popularity of tradwife and prepper consumption. These trends ask us to imagine survival individualistically and not as a product of social movements or collective interdependence. Rather, they constrict the imagination, narrowly encouraging us to fortify literal and metaphorical walls, to consume our way into fantasy 21st-century homesteads, and to envision modern warfare finally coming to U.S. soil.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Cybertruck capitalizes on these fears. Its marketing, for example, explicitly taps into the current apocalyptic visions pervading both right- and left-wing political imaginaries—from climate disaster to nuclear, civil, and class warfare. Heralded as being “built for any planet,” it showcases a Bioweapon Defense Mode and a “built-in hospital grade HEPA filter” that “helps provide protection from 99.97% of airborne particles.” One third-party Tesla modification company, aimed at civilian and government clients, sells Cybertruck upgrades so it can run on jet fuel, diesel, biodiesel, and electricity.\n\nThe idea that a Cybertruck could become an artillery vehicle is not just hypothetical. Unsanctioned by Tesla, various users, ranging from a YouTuber to Chechen forces fighting for Russia in Ukraine, have modified a Cybertruck by mounting machine guns to its bed, turning it into a lightly armored weaponized machine. Government forces, such as the police in Southern California and Dubai, are using the Cybertruck as part of their fleets—although in those cases its usage is symbolic and not for patrol duties. (Irvine’s vehicle will be part of its DARE program, for example.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo be clear, the Cybertruck is not designed for actual combat, but it allows consumers to play make-believe. For some, the vehicle’s appeal lies in its vision of the world as an apocalyptic battlefield. During the Cybertruck’s launch, Musk himself declared that “sometimes you get these late-civilization vibes” and that the “apocalypse can come along at any moment, and here at Tesla we have the best in apocalypse technology.” Its pseudo-futuristic vision is militaristic, stainless-steel fortified, masculinist, individualistic, and unforgiving. Indeed, some Americans’ embrace of the Cybertruck is not entirely surprising. It builds on the nation’s historical popular adoption of militarized personnel vehicles, such as the civilian consumption of Jeeps and Hummers. Jeeps came into civilian use after their deployment in World War II, and Hummers were the civilian adaptation of Humvees featured in American wars in the second half of the 20th century.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhether or not Musk or the Cybertruck’s designers made a conscious decision to draw inspiration from the Casspir, the Cybertruck can be understood as part of this darker history of science-fictional, militarized vehicles, used in civilian life, that make a show of their own impenetrability—one captured, for example, by 12-year-old Irvin in apartheid South Africa. More broadly, these historical linkages force us to rethink and seriously question the militarization of our public spaces and culture and the attempts to normalize and monetize them. Whether through Casspirs or the Cybertruck, apartheid’s militarized, cultural, and psychological legacy roams our streets.",

All of a sudden, one of the world’s most competitive rental markets found itself with very few renters.\n\n“Things totally changed,” Cash Jordan, a licensed real estate broker in the city, said in an interview with the trade publication the Real Deal. “Renters were in high demand. There are just so many empty apartments, and the supply and demand just flip-flopped.”\n\nTo survive as a realtor in this unprecedented market, Jordan got creative. He started posting several times a week, to his YouTube account, videos of himself walking through his listings. The footage often opened with b-roll from around the neighborhood, followed by introductions to hidden neighborhood gems, like coffee shops or restaurants. During these virtual showings, he injected lighthearted commentary, sometimes even poking fun at an apartment’s cramped closet or tiny bathroom.\n\nBut five years since he posted his first virtual showing video and almost two decades since he moved here, Jordan—who was one of New York City’s most well-known realtors on YouTube, promoting the dream of living here—has now become one of its most vocal critics. Once innocuous videos, such as “Living in a Tiny Box-Apartment on an NYC Roof” or “SEE a $2,900 Brooklyn PENTHOUSE with ROOF DECK and a BALCONY,” have given way to clickbait titles like “NYC is Now So Dangerous … Nobody Can Live Here,” “NYC Installs Cameras … To Tax Trump Supporters,” and “Venezuelan Gang Invades Manhattan … As NYC Collapses.”\n\nEqually misleading are his preview thumbnails, which now exclusively feature images that appear to have been created by generative A.I. tools to depict throngs of gangs or rioters flooding every corner of the city, evoking scenes reminiscent of The Walking Dead rather than bustling Midtown Manhattan.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile surprising, Jordan’s heel turn is just one example of a larger trend of creators taking advantage of social media algorithms that reward sensationalism and fearmongering over facts. Since YouTube is now one of the most popular sources of news in America, the site has become a target for creators and news influencers like Jordan to leverage their platforms and parlay them into lucrative sponsorship deals—at the expense of their audiences and the truth.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“Fundamentally, this is all about the algorithm,” Claire Wardle, an associate professor at Cornell University and a leading expert on misinformation and user-generated content, told Slate. “In many ways, these videos emulated Trump’s remarks, Fox News, or One America News. But this is not Trump or the Murdochs, but just a dude who may have figured out a way to maybe make a ton of money.”\n\nJordan did not respond to multiple requests for comment.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn recent months, Jordan has landed multiple brand sponsorships, from a large personal-injury law firm to a local moving company. Meanwhile, his channel has ballooned to more than 1.2 million subscribers at the time of reporting, a number that surpasses many local TV stations and outlets on YouTube. But instead of providing news grounded in facts, Jordan wields his megaphone to falsely portray New York as a real-life Gotham City. His stories cite migrants overwhelming the city, criminals running amok in the subways, and homeless people “destroying” its beloved public parks, claims that have led some tourists to question whether they should reconsider their plans to visit and others to wonder if it’s safe to take the subway at all. Some original fans have lamented that this once fun and informative property channel has become a hub for demonstrably untrue claims about New York City, with some accusing Jordan of grifting and capitalizing on the age-old fear of the crime-ridden urban center.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJordan has found a successful niche by sensationalizing crime and chaos in one of the world’s most populated and frequently visited cities. Since he posted the first series of videos on these topics starting in late 2023, engagement of his videos have soared, leading his subscriber number to double within a year. Many of his videos now garner more than a million views.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHis rise in popularity may provide another example of how technology and profit motives enable misinformation to spread easily. Americans are increasingly being misled not by Macedonian teens or the Russian intelligence service, but by creators who see a viable business model in simply amplifying misleading narratives and reinforcing division in an already deeply polarized society.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor example, Jordan’s relentless fearmongering about subway safety and alternative transportation—including the ongoing plan to expand protected bike lanes throughout the five boroughs—not only is misleading online but may have bolstered arguments from local and national politicians against initiatives aimed at making commuting safer and reducing car reliance. In 2024 vehicle collisions resulted in 251 fatalities, including 147 pedestrians and cyclists, while 10 people lost their lives on the subway.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn recent years, social media platforms have either drastically loosened their moderation policies or eliminated fact-checking altogether in the United States, reverting to an approach before QAnon memes and “Plandemic” videos flooded the internet. That wave of disinformation helped fuel the violent Jan. 6 riots, during which thousands of extreme supporters of Donald Trump used these same platforms to mobilize and attempt to stop the peaceful transfer of power.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCritics have long argued that social media platforms don’t just enable misinformation but incentivize it, rewarding misleading content by sharing ad revenue with creators and providing features that help them sell merchandise or collect donations from fans. Take Tim Pool as an example. The former Occupy Wall Street livestreamer turned alt-right talking head has frequently hosted supporters of QAnon, “Stop the Steal,” and other conspiracy theories on his shows over the years—and has in the past four years taken in more than $1.3 million in fan donations on YouTube alone.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo be fair, not all news influencers profit from misinformation and polarization. But a Pew Research study from last fall found that some of the most popular news influencers in the United States are disproportionately male and tend to be more right-leaning politically. And that’s why many postelection pundits hypothesized that Joe Rogan and other prominent “podcast bros” have helped rehabilitate Trump and expand his reach, while negative content about Kamala Harris from news influencers was twice as likely to be critical, according to Pew. But the opportunity to profit from advertising revenue and sponsorship money has also attracted side hustlers just like Jordan, who hope to generate income outside their full-time jobs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlso of concern, as some social media users have noticed, is the proliferation of so-called faceless accounts. These are creators who have learned that they can rack up views on YouTube by repurposing highly partisan culture-war material—often from cable networks and right-wing influencers—into news clips. On some occasions, these “faceless” creators have openly boasted about their monetization strategies and how they use A.I. tools to generate thumbnails and titles and even automate their entire workflow.\n\n“7 million views a month,” one such creator boasted in an X post, in which they also claimed that they earned tens of thousands of dollars from multiple YouTube channels specializing in anti-woke content such as “When Elon Musk DESTROYED a Woke Reporter …” and “ALL Celebrity & Liberal Meltdowns As Trump WINS ELECTION.”\n\nCombating this misinformation used to be the responsibility of the platforms themselves. However, due to recent content moderation policy changes and attitude shifts in Big Tech in the wake of the 2024 election, these platforms are largely shirking these duties—leaving their users to fend for themselves.\n\nRelated From Slate I Spent a Day Looking Only at What Donald Trump Fans See Online. Sure Does Look Nice From Here. Read More\n\n“In 2020 you might have asked the platforms to do more. But we’re in a different era now,” Wardle said. She added that the issue is exacerbated by emerging technology such as A.I. As such, she’s concerned that the information environment is only becoming more polluted and that the public will have a much harder time accessing quality information.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo spot false news or A.I.–generated visual content, media literacy experts and fact-checkers often advise readers to look out for vague or overly exaggerated language, inconsistencies in images such as mismatched shadows or unnatural proportions, and visuals that appear almost too perfect to be real. And if readers decide to share content on social media, they recommend verifying the context and tracing the original source to ensure accuracy.\n\nHannah Covington, of the News Literacy Project, told Slate that it’s crucial “to be able to understand what credibility looks like” and “recognize it in action.”\n\n“These are ‘digital survival skills,’ ” she added.\n\nStill, stronger moderation and algorithmic oversight by social media companies is essential to curb misinformation on their own platforms. But with Big Tech in the U.S. moving in the exact opposite direction, spreading misinformation is going to get a lot easier—while spotting it gets a whole lot harder.",

        "content": "I imagine that it is frustrating, for some, to begin a show about a superhero, then discover, right in the first episode, that the series is about the protagonist quitting the superhero business. Yet that is what Daredevil: Born Again did almost immediately when it debuted on Disney+ last week, in a premiere that kills fan-favorite character and protagonist Matt Murdock’s (Charlie Cox) career as the vigilante Daredevil. The show’s focus then shifts, jumping forward a year to focus on a Murdock who has resolved to never put on the costume again, committing fully to his law practice.\n\nThere’s a resemblance to the Surf Dracula problem here. Born Again, however, makes a pretty great case (ha ha) for this decision—and for its sheer existence as a revival and continuation of the Netflix series—by its second episode, “Optics.” After a double-episode premiere that functions mostly as a coda to 2015’s Daredevil (and is likely inscrutable to anyone who never watched that series), “Optics” goes about laying the groundwork for Born Again’s parallel through lines: Matt Murdock’s attempts to be a lawyer and leave his alter ego behind, and the goings-on of his nemesis, the crime lord Wilson Fisk (Vincent D’Onofrio), as he settles into the New York City mayor’s office.\n\nAnd then there’s the story of Hector Ayala—one of the most moving and devastating plots to unfold in a Marvel project, and reason alone to make watching Daredevil: Born Again worthwhile.\n\nIt starts like any case-of-the-week show would. In “Optics,” Ayala (Kamar de los Reyes) is Murdock’s latest client, a man wrongfully accused of killing a cop. This immediately takes Born Again into the sort of topical territory the MCU tends to avoid. That in itself is novel, but of course, novel doesn’t necessarily mean good—good is when the episode reveals that Ayala, unbeknownst to Murdock, is secretly the vigilante known as White Tiger. What begins as a story about police brutality takes on a personal dimension, putting the screws to Murdock’s decision to quit being Daredevil when a broken justice system ensnares men like Ayala and empowers rogue cops to abuse them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAcross two episodes, the second of which aired Tuesday night, Ayala’s case lays out the thematic ground of Born Again in miniature: the failure of institutions and the ways people are compelled to compensate for them, and the ripple effect that superheroes and their iconography can have on such a rotting system. Ayala, as the White Tiger, is positioned as the positive end of that spectrum: a man who does what he does simply because people need help and it’s the right thing to do. At the other end lies another vigilante, Frank Castle, aka the Punisher, who looms over the show in absentia (for now) as a symbol adopted by lawless cops, wearing his signature skull on vests and tattoos, even putting it on bullet casings.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSuspended between these two is Murdock’s past as Daredevil, which continues to cause him moral anguish. Did he put on the costume because it was the right thing to do, like Ayala? Or, like Castle, did he just enjoy the violence and its immediate results? And between those two poles, which of them is tempting him to let the devil out once more?\n\nIn addition to being vintage comic-book angst—some of the genre’s best material stems from heroes torn between their masked and unmasked personas, à la Spider-Man 2—the White Tiger two-parter smartly arranges all of Born Again’s pieces around Murdock in a way that is palpably suffocating. Murdock still won’t put on the costume, but he does act out: doing some extracurricular ass-kicking; pissing off his colleagues, who realize that the case is getting to him; and, as a result, deploying a reckless, ill-advised gambit in the courtroom in a last-ditch effort to win the trial. It’s good television. He pulls it off. Ayala is acquitted.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDespite all this, Ayala doesn’t get much screen time; the actor Kamar de los Reyes died of cancer in December 2023, after filming his parts. But the portrayal, brief as it may be, succinctly presents a moving sketch of a principled man who felt a sense of obligation to his community, one that he sometimes struggled to square with his personal life. In a quiet moment with Murdock, he tells the lawyer of one of the things that brings him peace: the memory of a small beach near his hometown in Puerto Rico, and the sound of the coquís, the small frogs native to the island, whistling out against the surf.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAyala’s story works well in part because it is a direct adaptation of a comic-book two-parter by Brian Michael Bendis and Manuel Gutierrez, which gives Born Again a narrative spine around which to build these two episodes. While the specifics are different this time around, both stories end in tragedy. Set free after the acquittal, Ayala immediately resumes his work as White Tiger—but now that he’s been outed, one of the Punisher-loving cops is waiting for him. He’s ambushed and killed, his murderer obscured in shadow, but the Punisher’s skull is visible on his chest.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne of the failings of the modern era of superhero storytelling is a lack of reflexivity, an incuriosity about what any of these theatrics might mean—a strange omission for stories about characters known for wearing symbols on their chests. With Hector Ayala’s trial, Daredevil: Born Again reconfigures the pieces from Marvel’s Netflix era of TV shows in such a way that those symbols, and what they mean, are the central thrust of the show’s plot, building a moving melodrama about the humans behind them whose actions give those symbols meaning or turn them noxious. Then, in a quiet and gutting move, the episode gives the viewer the space to contemplate that as the credits roll: not with a fitting song or Born Again’s moody theme but with the music of coquís, singing as the waves crash along the beach.",

        "content": "Dear Prudence is Slate’s advice column. Delia Cai is filling in as Prudie for Jenée Desmond-Harris while she’s on parental leave. Submit questions here.\n\nDear Prudence,\n\nI’m a young-ish woman starting therapy for the first time. It’s been an overwhelming process both because of the logistical hurdles of finding someone in network in addition to working on my own internalized stigma towards therapy, but I was able to find someone and make an appointment with them. Several days after making the appointment, I dug deeper and out of curiosity looked my soon-to-be-therapist up on various social media platforms (I had done a very cursory google search of her but didn’t go much deeper than that). I was shocked when I found her personal Instagram account.\n\nIt was full of racy photos of her, some of which showed her face, posing suggestively in what looks like bondage gear and lingerie—along with links to her Only Fans account! I felt shocked that given her professional role, she would have her first and last name attached to these. I’m already kind of a prude (which is something I do want to talk about in therapy and unpack!) but I don’t think I could focus with a therapist when all I can think about is what she looks like posing in a leather thong. When I told my friends I was thinking about canceling my appointment and finding another therapist because it made me uncomfortable, they said I was slut shaming and that there’s nothing wrong with a therapist having an Only Fans. One of them even said that this was actively discriminating against sex workers and that seeing a therapist who is a sex worker would be beneficial for me to “humanize” them and that it could help me work through my own issues (I come from what many people might consider to be a very sexually repressed background). Any thoughts about what I should do? Is it discrimination to switch to another therapist because of this? And more generally speaking, do you think it’s OK for someone in a professional role like this to post public content like that? My friends evidently think it’s unabashedly OK, but I know other people in my life would find it unfathomable, so I’m curious where you stand on this.\n\n—Prude or Prudent?\n\nDear Prudent,\n\nYou can and absolutely should switch to another therapist. For one thing, I’d say that being exposed to your therapist’s social media—whatever its contents are—is simply too much information to have. In my experience, a successful therapeutic relationship requires the ability to see your therapist strictly as your therapist. I have had two therapists over the past eight years, and both of them took great care to never reveal much about themselves or their personal lives; I think that was a necessary part of the dynamic, because otherwise I would have been projecting all kinds of irrelevant judgments and assumptions on them. I probably wouldn’t have taken their advice as seriously, especially if I knew about their choices.\n\nThere’s a general belief that we often gravitate toward therapists who “replicate” certain dynamics with key figures for us; this was a key plot point in Season 4 of This Is Us for Randal Pearson’s storyline, for example. I can personally attest to the fact that I saw my first therapist, who was middle-aged and male, as a father-like authority, and that I see my current therapist, who is my age and female, as an older sister-like figure. What I’m saying is that it’s extremely important to the overall project of going to therapy to feel comfortable with your therapist, because they are going to provoke a lot of feelings and model how you feel about other relationships in your lives. So really, if you’re not comfortable with a certain therapist for any reason, I’d advise you should switch.\n\nI think your friends are being judgy; this isn’t discrimination, but you are also being judgy, too. To answer your question about whether it’s OK to post that kind of public content as a professional: My general rule is that I think adults can do whatever they want as long as they’re not harming others, but I personally don’t have to approve of anyone’s choices. And neither do you. We all get to make judgments about what kind of behavior we like or dislike in other people, and we’re all allowed to make decisions based on those judgments.\n\nMaybe you do have a few beliefs that would qualify as “prudish,” and that affects what kind of people you surround yourself with. That’s entirely okay. You’ve already mentioned that this is something you’d like to address in therapy anyway.\n\nIt often takes a few tries with different providers to find the therapist that you click with totally, so this is all quite normal. Just resist the urge next time to look them up!\n\n\n\n\n\nGet advice—submit a question! Please keep questions short (<150 words), and don‘t submit the same question to multiple columns.

When we visited, I was barely allowed to bring extra underwear because all our luggage was crammed with gifts. I hated it—I would have third or fourth cousins screaming in my face that they wanted brand new iPhone and Air Jordans and we better pony up even more money. I understand the country is very impoverished, but I never felt more like a sheep getting sheared. We were raising three kids in a two-bedroom townhouse and sharing a car as old as our oldest and my ex would be sending money to build yet another house for some random relative. I hit my breaking point after getting a second job in order to save money for getting braces for our girls and maybe make another bedroom for our son. My ex raided it and sent the majority back to support a local church that one of her cousins attended.\n\nWe got divorced, and since our girls turned 18 last year, the child support has ended. My ex lost her job and the house has a cracked foundation and water damage, but she is still sending thousands a month back to her relatives. My girls both dropped out of school and are working full time in retail. They give their mother their entire paycheck and they coming to call on me for more money. I am already covering their car and medical insurance, but it kills me when they call me crying because the light bill hasn’t been paid again. My girls refuse to consider moving out and leaving their mom. I have begged, pleaded, and bargained with them, nothing works. I am disgusted and disappointed about how my ex is leeching off our kids like she did me in our marriage. I don’t know what to do, just this situation is not sustainable.\n\n—No Room for the Old Country\n\nDear No Room,\n\nThe unfortunate truth is that, quite often, our loved ones will choose to spend their money in ways that we don’t approve of. You experienced this lesson in the extreme with your ex; it sounded like she made financial decisions that you didn’t support, and this became untenable for your marriage. Now that you are no longer in any kind of joint financial arrangement with her (via marriage or child support), that means you are both financially independent from each other—which means that you really don’t have any kind of permit to judge her choices anymore.\n\nObviously, this has become a painful situation because she has involved your children in her decisions. But the other unfortunate truth is that your daughters are now adults, which means that it’s their choice as a grown-up to spend their money the way they want (even if that means supporting their mother’s choices). To put it bluntly: If everyone’s an adult, you don’t have a say in how they spend.\n\nIt goes both ways, though, because that means they also don’t get a say in how you spend your money (i.e. whether you give them assistance or not). I think you need to draw a hard boundary with your daughters. Of course, it’s easier to absolve your financial responsibility to an ex than it is to your children, but as you said yourself, this situation where you’re being asked to send money and then feel utterly resentful about it is unsustainable for your relationship with your children. You will have to find a way to explain to them clearly and neutrally something along the lines of, “Now that you’re adults, I respect the choices you make about the money you earn, even though you know how I feel about these choices. I think it’s better for our relationship to keep my support limited to your car and medical insurance, because otherwise, I’m only going to grow resentful and attach strings to the money I give you.”\n\nIt’s highly possible that your daughters will take this as an affront, and they might even give you the cold shoulder for a while. But it’s up to them to learn the hard lesson of deciding where their values and priorities lie, and to deal with the consequences of those decisions. That’s what adulthood’s all about, and you’re only holding them back from these lessons the longer you try to keep control.\n\nDear Prudence,\n\nMy husband and I have worked ourselves to the bone to provide the best start for our three kids. I only make around 40k a year and the majority has gone towards paying for our kids to go to college without loans. My husband and I were very blunt that we expected our kids to keep their grades up and graduate in four years. Our kids are all roughly four years apart. There is no way we could pay for more than one a year.\n\nWe also told them not to expect us to fund their lifestyles. They could always come live at home, but they would need to work and save money. We weren’t going get into the Peter Pan trap of many of our peers. My own mother worked herself into an early grave because my brothers never grew up beyond hitting on younger girls and spending all their money on weed.\n\nOur daughter, “Darla,” has always been difficult. We fought a lot over her refusal to consider summer classes because she wanted to socialize instead. She skated through school and changed her degree twice. That meant she was only half done with her degree by the time her younger brother started college. It was a huge blow out when we told her she to get a job and loans. She has moved in and out of our house several times because she found the house rules not to her liking. Darla was of the mind that she could come and go as she pleased, take the car without asking, and have her boyfriends sleep over, and quit her job if she didn’t get the shift she wanted.\n\nIt has been exhausting. When Darla met “Brandon,” she seemed to finally calm down and grow up. They share an apartment and both of them work. Darla has talked about finishing her degree and even grad school. Then they announced their engagement. We were happy but told our daughter that we wouldn’t be able to contribute much to the wedding. We needed to save for retirement, and our youngest was in his final year of college. (He took a two year hiatus after being in a car wreck that killed his girlfriend and two others. A drunk driver plowed right into them.) How our daughter responded was disgraceful. Darla screamed about how we always favored her brothers and we were obligated to pay for the wedding by tradition. My husband told Darla the marriage license was $50 and he would cover it if they wanted to get married next week, and that it sounded more like she wanted to play princess for a day than actually be a wife.\n\nDarla responded by attacking her brother and daring to blame him for the deaths. I think my son would have decked his sister if we weren’t in the room. Since then our family is fractured. Neither of our sons will talk to their sister and have spoken about boycotting the wedding. Darla only calls us when she wants to relitigate the fight. I love our daughter, but we didn’t raise her with this sense of entitlement. I married her father in a borrowed dress at the local church. Our first dance was to a cassette tape. So what do we do here?\n\n—About Darla\n\nDear About Darla,\n\nFrankly, I don’t think there’s anything you can do here. Darla’s anger and resentment is a problem that she has to deal with on her own, and there’s nothing you can say that will magically speed up that process.\n\nYou and your husband have set a reasonable boundary with her, and she’s reacting by lashing out. Everyone’s an adult here and is making their own choices, which are equally valid (if not equally reasonable). Resist the urge to play family peacemaker, and let your adult children decide if and how they want to work this out. In the meantime, stick to your boundary and reiterate, if need be, the specific ways you can offer support (i.e. the $50 marriage license, or time on the phone with a son who needs to vent). But I’d urge you to stay in the wings of the larger wedding conflict as best as you can; Darla will likely continue to not handle things the way you’d want, but she’s grown-up now, and unfortunately, that’s her prerogative. You have to step back and let her be who she’s going to be.\n\n—Delia\n\nCatch up on this week’s Prudie.\n\nMore Advice From Slate\n\nMy husband has always been very healthy, but he is now well into his 50s and is starting to develop issues. The problem is that he refuses to treat his health seriously. He doesn’t even have a general doctor, has had none of the milestone checks he should have had at his age, and will see somebody only if I make it harder not to, which I am reluctant to do.",

        "source": "https://slate.com/",
        "content": "Sign up for the Slatest to get the most insightful analysis, criticism, and advice out there, delivered to your inbox daily.\n\nLast Saturday, immigration agents arrested Mahmoud Khalil, a lawful permanent resident of the U.S., at his home in New York City, declaring that he would be deported as soon as possible. The Trump administration did not charge Khalil with a crime, nor did it seriously allege that he had committed one. Instead, it targeted him for his leadership in last year’s pro-Palestinian protests at Columbia University. Although Khalil holds a green card and is married to an American citizen, the administration asserted that it had the legal authority to expel him on the basis of his participation in First Amendment–protected speech, without even the pretense of due process. It swiftly transferred him to a notoriously dangerous immigrant detention center in Louisiana, where he remains while his lawyers fight his removal.\n\nOn this week’s Slate Plus bonus episode of Amicus, Dahlia Lithwick and Mark Joseph Stern discuss the government’s persecution of Khalil, the disturbing precedent it sets, and the broader threat it poses to all our civil liberties. A preview of their conversation, edited and condensed for clarity, is below.\n\nDahlia Lithwick: You and I have been following the Trump administration’s decision to more or less abduct and then disappear Mahmoud Khalil under a statute that opens the door for any green-card holder to be removed in apparent violation of basic constitutional rights. On Thursday morning, a spokesman for the Trump administration was literally unable to answer the question of whether this means any green-card holder can be deported on the basis of protected free speech. There was an emergency habeas hearing in Judge Jesse Furman’s New York courtroom on Wednesday. The government’s lawyers did not even pretend that Khalil had committed a crime. They just argued that they thought he was dangerous, dusting off an old statute to do it, and then said they moved him from New York to Louisiana—quite deliberately, so that Judge Furman would not have jurisdiction over the case.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI see these actions as so dangerous for basic constitutional protections. If Khalil committed a crime, charge him with a crime. But holy cow, this feels like the whole shooting match in terms of speech and assembly and other First Amendment–protected values. And I don’t know how to think about the fact that this administration doesn’t even believe he deserved due process.\n\nMark Joseph Stern: It is ghastly and horrifying. And no matter what anyone thinks of the underlying speech here, I don’t think any American should approve of what the Trump administration is doing—because, as you said, this really is sort of the endgame for free speech and due process. The administration is citing an old law from the second Red Scare, originating in the Immigration and Naturalization Act of 1952, that says “an alien whose presence or activities in the United States the Secretary of State has reasonable ground to believe would have potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences for the United States is deportable.” Secretary of State Marco Rubio has said that he thinks that Khalil’s free speech would have adverse foreign policy consequences, so Khalil must be deported. That is from the government’s papers so far; that is evidently the entire basis of this removal.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt’s really important to remember that this is an obscure and largely untested provision of the law. The only other time in recent history it was invoked was when the Clinton administration wanted to deport a former Mexican government official who was accused of corruption. But a federal judge at the time ruled that the law was an unconstitutional violation of due process.\n\nThat judge was Maryanne Trump Barry, the sister of Donald Trump. And the constitutional issues were never definitively resolved because the Justice Department decided to indict the official anyway, which is what it should have done in the first place, and then he died before the case could reach completion. That is the sum total of the precedent that the Trump administration is purporting to build off in its quest to jettison these basic constitutional principles—that the government has to follow some process before abducting and deporting you; that the government cannot retaliate against your constitutionally protected expression; and that the government should at least be able to cite some criminal activity you allegedly engaged in before it disappears you in the night.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI think this shows that the government’s legal arguments are on really thin ice. The law in question was enacted in a very different time, the second Red Scare, when there were much fewer civil liberties guaranteed to everyone, including immigrants. A lot of legal reasoning from that period has been totally discredited. And so I hope that the courts will step in and do the right thing. Judge Furman seems to want to. But as you noted, the first thing that the government did was try to move Khalil to a state within the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit, so that the 5th Circuit would have jurisdiction over his claim instead of, well, a real court. That’s a dark place to be.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI want to reiterate something you said, because it’s deadly serious: No matter what you think of what Khalil said and did, he was charged with no crime. He was given no notice. He was simply taken from his home and disappeared. And we have to be really, really afraid when there isn’t even an attempt on the part of government lawyers to say there was a crime—when, instead, they simply hang everything on a dusty old statute and a dubious claim that we think he’s dangerous to the United States. Because if they’re coming for that, they’re coming for all of us.\n\nRelated From Slate What’s the Deal With Amy Coney Barrett Lately? Read More\n\nI also want to emphasize that the First Amendment doesn’t distinguish between citizens and noncitizens, or lawful permanent residents and everyone else. So the idea that your green card is subject to revocation because of something you said is really hard to square with the constitutional text. And it’s important to notice the administration just pulling out these old, discredited statutes and using them to say: “Oh, we don’t need to do due process at all. We don’t need to give notice and the ability to be heard. You’re done.” There’s an irony here, because when the Biden administration tried to use old statutes as the basis for major policies, the Supreme Court came down like a hammer. But I guess using Red Scare statutes that have never been lawfully deployed to this end because, you know, it’s just the fundamental right to speak and assemble—nothing too important, right?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt is especially hard for me to swallow coming off of four years of the Biden administration getting smacked down at every turn whenever the Justice Department tried to use a relatively old or arguably obscure law to justify and defend its policies. And some of these laws weren’t even obscure! The Biden administration tried to impose a clean power plan through the Clean Air Act, which has clear language empowering the EPA to do just that. But the Supreme Court dismissed that language as a “backwater” provision and struck down the plan. There was a major federal law passed after 9/11 that gave the Education Department sweeping authority to relieve student loans, but when the Biden administration invoked it to try to forgive student loans because of COVID, it got smacked down. Rinse and repeat with the bump stock ban, the eviction moratorium, and more—Biden’s Justice Department cited a valid law from yesteryear, the Supreme Court said it didn’t really count.\n\nNow we have the Trump administration trying this tactic, but with an evil provision of a dangerous law based on a discredited conception of the Constitution. It certainly makes me fear that the Trump administration is going to come out soon with an argument based on the Comstock Act to restrict medication abortion. After all, the Justice Department recently notified courts that it is reviewing its position on medication abortion. I think it’s very likely that it will start citing the 1873 Comstock Act—this dusty old law that courts treated as unconstitutional for decades—and use it as a basis to restrict access to abortion pills. Again: Either this tactic is legitimate and all presidents can use it, or it shouldn’t be done at all, and laws have a de facto expiration date. It cannot be that only Republican presidents get to sic their lawyers on the law books and have them pluck out one sentence from a statute no one has read in 50 years and say it’s the basis for unlimited, unchecked power.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI see your 1873 Comstock Act and raise you the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, which by comparison makes Comstock look like a shiny newborn baby. The administration is reportedly trotting out the Alien Enemies Act to grant themselves wartime authority to hurry along unlawful mass deportation plans in the weeks ahead. This is, again, a statute entirely of another era, designed to be invoked when the United States is at war with a foreign country or under invasion. There’s no credible claim that we are at war or facing invasion, yet this will be the 18th-century lever that gets Trump where he wants to go.\n\nSo I want to underline what you’re saying, Mark, which is that any idiot can pull some old statute out of a book, melt it down, and repurpose it to do evil. But the degree to which this is cynically being done in one area after another, day after day, in a kind of hurricane of bad faith, so that it’s almost impossible to keep up, raises this question you and I keep asking: Can the courts possibly keep up? And what will the Supreme Court do? Are we just sitting here watching basic tenets of freedom and democracy being disassembled in this cynical way and hoping that Amy Coney Barrett and John Roberts will save us? It’s a really grim day for the rule of law.\n\nThe Alien Enemies Act was the basis of interning law-abiding immigrants during World War I and World War II. It was the basis of early Japanese internment at the outset of World War II. Now we have to hope that John Roberts meant it when he said that Korematsu has been repudiated by the court of history. And whenever thousands of people’s rights ride on John Roberts and Amy Coney Barrett deciding that civil liberties can survive for 24 more hours, we’re in a bad place.",

My aunt and mother both live in the house too, and take care of my grandmother. Our rent was reduced in exchange for us taking care of the yard and doing other upkeep of the property. We keep a baby gate on the stairs because my aunt and mother each have a pack of yappy little monsters.\n\nThose yappy monsters aren’t the problem, though. My cousin’s yappy little monsters are.\n\nShe has six kids under 10. They are destructive and obsessed with trying to get into our area. We have a gaming system and my boyfriend’s hobby is building and painting models. Her kids have stolen them multiple times and even wrecked one that was over eight hundred dollars. They know they aren’t supposed to go upstairs. They don’t care. They want to, and their mom says it is okay.\n\nThe problems go beyond that. I have deep cleaned the kitchen to come back to find it wrecked. We were peeling the old wallpaper in the front hall and painting, only for the kids to run screaming through our work area. They ended up kicking the paint can and ruining the rugs. My cousin doesn’t care. They are ”just kids.” My aunt is just obsessed with seeing her grandchildren and my mother will not stand up to her. We finally switched our rooms so the bed was in the rec room and our living area was in the bedroom with a lock and key. It hasn’t helped. We can’t sleep in or get intimate without the worry one of the brats is going to run up screaming they need to use our toilet or want to watch our TV. I finally had it out with my cousin that if she wanted her kids to get an eyeful she might as well put on a porn movie and save us all the hassle. She cursed me out and said no one else has a problem with her parenting. I shot back our grandmother takes out her hearing aid and locks herself in her room when they come over.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow it is a huge mess. We can’t afford to move out and my family can’t afford to pay the taxes on the place without our rent. We are completely stuck. Help!\n\n—Stuck\n\nRelated From Slate My Co-Workers Go Around the Table at Lunch and Declare Which of Our Foods Will Make Us Fatter Read More\n\nDear Stuck,\n\nI totally get why you’re frustrated. It must be exhausting to have your space constantly invaded and no one to take it seriously.\n\nBut the problem isn’t the kids. It sounds like they’re just being, well, kids. Without limits and boundaries, life with kids can be chaotic, and right now it sounds like they have full rein to do whatever they want. Hence, the chaos.\n\nIf your cousin has six kids under 10, she’s probably overwhelmed and exhausted, and while the situation is not ideal for you—or anyone, really—the reality is that she might not have the capacity to do better right now. Don’t get me wrong. I’m not saying you have to simply accept chaos in your space, but a little empathy might help you get through to her. Right now, it sounds like the way everyone is approaching the problem is just escalating the conflict.\n\nMaybe instead of telling her what she’s doing wrong, try framing the conversation with some compassion and then a solution. Something like: “You have a lot on your plate, and we need some boundaries so we can all live here peacefully. My boundary is that the upstairs is off limits, since that’s our living space. Can we figure something out together so that the kids have their own space to play and stay out of the upstairs area?”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou said you’ve tried a lock and key, but there have to be other solutions, too. Are there taller gates to keep the kids out? Could you create a special “kid zone” downstairs to deter them from going upstairs? The kids might also want some attention from you—could you schedule some “special time” with them downstairs? Maybe tell them you’ll bring down some special toys and play with them, but only if they respect your boundaries and stay out of the upstairs. Ultimately, though, it’s up to the parent to enforce these limits, and your cousin will probably be more willing to do so if you can empathize with her situation instead of dehumanizing her children by referring to them as “brats” and “yappy little monsters.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYour aunt and mom need to step up, too. If they’re willing to watch the kids, they should also be willing to help manage them. They rely on your rent, so it’s in their best interest to step up, and you might need to let them know that this is a dealbreaker for you. If nothing changes, maybe you should look for alternative living arrangements, even if it means a tighter budget elsewhere or living in a house with other roommates—ones who won’t break your things or barge into your room.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGet advice—submit a question!

Dear Pay Dirt, * Your letter signoff Your pronouns Your email (optional and confidential—please include if you're open to Pay Dirt following up) Submit\n\nDear Pay Dirt,\n\nMy friend has asked my opinion about the conversation she and her husband are having regarding their wills. The backstory is this: My friend, “Joan,” wanted a kid so she hit up a sperm bank and voila, “Olivia.” When Olivia was 8, Joan married a divorced man, “Matthew.” Matthew has three kids of his own, all boys. Both Joan and Matthew make good incomes, but Matthew has less to contribute to the marriage because he was making maintenance payments to his ex-wife, Allison. Matthew and Allison had a 50/50 custody arrangement. After marrying Joan, Matthew adopted Olivia. So Matthew has four children and Joan has one child and three step-children. She views herself as a “bonus mom.”\n\nNow, Joan is considering three options for her will. Of course, Matthew is her main beneficiary. But the question is what happens when they both die. Possibility #1 is that she and Matthew leave each of the four kids 25 percent. But then that’s all Olivia gets, and the boys will also inherit from their mother. Possibility #2 is that Matthew splits his half four ways (12.5 percent per kid) and Joan leaves her half to her child, Olivia (50 percent). Olivia would end up with 62.5 percent and the boys would each have 12.5 percent. Possibility #3 is that Matthew splits his half four ways and Joan leaves most of her half to Olivia with a smaller amount for the boys, so maybe Olivia ends up with 40 percent and each boy gets 20 percent.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo me, it’s obvious that Olivia should get the largest inheritance, because they are both her parents (and Joan didn’t spend any of her money on an ex-spouse) but Joan is concerned that an uneven inheritance could cause problems for Olivia with her brothers. What do you think is the most common and/or fairest way to divide this inheritance?\n\n—Blended Money and Families Can Be Complicated\n\nDear Blended,\n\nJoan’s concerns are valid. At the same time, any of these options could cause problems. It seems fair to me, too, that Olivia should get a larger inheritance in some way. After all, the boys will also be inheriting from their mother and Joan is the “bonus” mom, as she puts it.\n\nBut … is Joan sure that’s all true? Is she certain the boys are getting an inheritance from Allison? Does she know anything about Allison’s financial situation? If they’re on good terms, Matthew and Allison should probably have a separate conversation about this to make sure they’re on the same page. I’m sure they both want to make sure their boys are financially set in the future, so if they’re in a friendly place where they can have an open and transparent conversation about this, they should. It might give Joan and Matthew more information to figure out what to do with their own planning.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut again, whatever choice they make, there is the potential for issues to arise. Family disputes are common when it comes to will and estate planning, and there’s no way to avoid them, even if Joan and Matthew try to be as thoughtful as possible. (Also, those percentages get tricky if they die at very different times, or have assets of their own that they keep separate. Money: it’s really complicated even before you factor in the emotions!) There are, however, a few things they can do to keep things smooth. The first is to set up a trust. A trust is a legal arrangement that specifies exactly how a person’s assets should be distributed after they die. It skips the messy, drawn-out probate process, which will be especially useful if they think tensions will run high between the siblings.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBeyond that, they can talk to the kids now about what’s going to happen in the future, and they can foster good communication and relationship skills around this tricky topic. This might mean being transparent with the kids about what the plan is, and if any potential issues pop up, they can talk through them to make sure everyone feels the arrangement is as fair as it can be. Even if one child ends up with less than they think they deserve, it might help them to know that their parents were trying as hard as possible to do right by everyone.\n\nIt’s easier said than done, of course, but creating strong sibling bonds now might mean fewer headaches later. And a fair dose of open communication will ensure they’re all a happy bunch.\n\n—Kristin",

Submit questions here.\n\nDear Prudence,\n\nI need serious help because my son, Terry, has taken his stupidity to new and terrifying levels. Terry is a gym-obsessed, protein-chugging, testosterone-fueled jock who barely reads anything that isn’t the label on a tub of creatine. He lifts weights for hours, talks about his “gains” like they’re his life’s work, and believes any problem can be solved with either more reps or more chicken breast.\n\nOne of his gym buddies made an offhand joke about how “chicks dig athletes” and how it’s a shame that lesbians don’t get to experience top-tier genetics like his. Most people would roll their eyes and move on. Terry, in all his meat-headed glory, took it as a “mission.” His solution? He decided to donate sperm exclusively to lesbian couples. And not in a normal, through-the-clinic kind of way. No, that would be too simple. He started personally offering his services. He actually approached lesbian couples he knew and “pitched” himself like he was some elite genetic lottery prize. Apparently, he thought he was being helpful. And somehow, it never occurred to him that maybe, just maybe, this was wildly inappropriate. He genuinely seemed to believe he was performing a public service, like holding a door open.\n\nWell, reality finally hit him in the face when his cousin Claire called him out (Terry had offered to donate to her wife). She told him, in no uncertain terms, that lesbians weren’t looking for random gym bros to “gift” them sperm. She told him it was offensive, invasive, and, above all, completely ridiculous. Terry just stood there, nodding slowly, like he was finally understanding a really hard math problem. Then he said, “Wait… so you don’t actually want my help?” I swear, I nearly lost my mind.\n\nHe’s crushed now. He keeps asking if he should apologize and talking about how he “just wanted to do something good.” I told him the best thing he can do for the lesbian community is leave them alone. But knowing him, I have a feeling he’ll just redirect all this misplaced energy into some other equally idiotic project. How do I knock some sense into him before he finds a “new” way to embarrass himself (and me)?\n\n—Terry’s Mortified Mom\n\nDear Mortified Mom,\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI’m assuming your son is an adult, in which case, the short answer here would be that you likely just need to back off and let Terry learn a few lessons on his own about having some manners and keeping his sperm to himself.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOtherwise, the only role that really makes sense for you to play as his mother is to offer a listening ear and source of non-judgment (even though of course, by the sounds of it, you definitely have some judgments about his misguided behavior). Ask him to talk about how he feels about Claire’s conversation with him, and try to gently point out things to do or say that will actually make him feel useful to the people he cares about. Affirm his intentions to be helpful, and offer examples from your own life when you’ve perhaps been misattuned to someone’s needs. Your son isn’t going to change his personality overnight; this is more of a matter of redirecting inappropriate behavior rather than rewiring his entire belief system.\n\nDear Prudence,\n\nI am very worried about my 25-year-old daughter. She has had out-of-control, nearly violent reactions to basic life changes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHer father and I hadn’t been happy in our marriage for years but stuck it out for our kids. We knew the kids would be upset, but our daughter went into a screaming rage that we weren’t allowed to do this to her. She then disappeared and wouldn’t even get in contact with her brothers for several days. I get a promotion and have to sell the house for a move—she has a temper tantrum and forbid me from doing it (she hadn’t lived at home since she was 19).\n\nOur family dog got attacked by a wild animal and needed to be put down. When I called to tell my daughter, she was utterly vile to me. I had to hang up on her and was left shaking. She has constant fall-outs with friends, and one of my sons refuses to be around her anymore.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe most disturbing thing to me are her reactions to her father starting to date again. She acts more like a jealous lover than a daughter. She has gone through years of some of these women’s social media profiles to find some flaw to justify her dislike. More than once she fought with me because I wasn’t upset enough that her father was seeing someone. My ex-husband was a man of many faults, but he was a devoted father and a kind man. I am happy that he is finally happy. He announced his plans to remarry. I met his fiancée several times, and she seems lovely. My daughter reacted to the news with such a fury that I was physically afraid. She moved in with me last fall after a break up. She was ranting and raving about her father’s “betrayal,” and she wasn’t going to let this “bitch win.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLater, I confronted my daughter and told her this was not normal, and that she needed to see a professional. She refused and denied she had any problems and no one normal would be happy about getting a stepmother. I don’t know what to do here. I am walking on egg shells. I am very worried my daughter might do something. I don’t know what. Do I reach out to my ex-husband? How do I even start this conversation?\n\n—Egg Shells\n\nDear Egg Shells,\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you’re feeling physically afraid of your daughter and her anger, this shared living arrangement is not going to be sustainable. I do think you should reach out to your ex-husband, both to give him a heads up about your daughter’s state and so that you can present a united front when you take action. Tell him that you’re worried about, and that you need to work as a team to figure how to set some firm boundaries with her. In my opinion, it’s time for both of you put some major distance between you and your daughter; her rage sounds incredibly destructive and her behavior sounds potentially abusive.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI share your concerns about your daughter’s well-being, particularly since the average onset for many mental illnesses, including depression and bipolar disorder, happens in one’s twenties. But if she’s an adult and refuses to seek treatment, there’s not much you can personally do on that front. However, it’s within your control to seek some professional help with this situation; dealing with abusive family members requires long-term support and solutions, and it sounds like you need both. All I can tell you is that your daughter’s behavior is going to continue affecting your relationships (and those of your ex’s) for as long as you’re willing to tolerate it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGet advice—submit a question!

Because of my profession, I feel it’s important to constantly be learning about and recognizing other people’s experiences, especially if they’re different from my own. My husband and I grew up in a Christian faith in which we are still both active. When I’m watching my show, if my husband happens to walk in on someone speaking out on police brutality or two women sharing a kiss, he makes a jab about “is this the kind of stuff you watch when I’m gone?” It has really been bothering me lately because I feel he thinks he’s better than me for being bothered by the content of my shows, even though it’s nothing pornographic. I’ve tried to discuss this with him, but it just turns into a bigger fight about our differing politics. I’m not sure how to handle this.\n\n—Feeling Judged\n\nDear Feeling Judged,\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt’s time to institute a blanket rule with your husband about not commenting on each other’s entertainment choices.

I thought our relationship had a “normal” level of conflict, with the usual highs and lows that every couple faces. Three years ago, while on vacation, we had a disagreement on something minor that resulted in my partner blowing up and then ignoring me and the kids for a week. When he decided to end the silent treatment, it was to announce (in front of the kids) that he was moving out.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFast forward three years and he still haven’t left—although he’s asked for a separation/divorce three other times all preceded by days/weeks of the silent treatment. Every time, I agreed to his request, but when it comes down to working out the details, he refuses to engage in meaningful discussions/decisions (on money, custody, etc.). We talk in circle for hours straight (like 8+ hours) and then when his anger subsides, we both make concessions to try and be better parents/partners. The last two times, I suggested that we go to couples counselling, but it never happens. He initially agrees but then later insists that counselling won’t help, doesn’t work, or isn’t required anymore.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrustrated with the recurring cycles, I started individual counselling and during my third session, the counsellor looked at me and stated, “You know you’re in a wildly abusive relationship, right?” I was shocked because the term “abuse” wasn’t on my radar. I thought that we have different parenting/communication styles, and we just needed some tools to help us deal with our conflicts better.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis happened a week ago and I feel almost numb. Am I in an abusive relationship? I worry that the info I gave the counsellor was too one-sided and unfair to my partner. I worry about what this means about me as a parent. How could I be in an abusive relationship, and subjected my kids to the same abuse, for years and not realize it? I feel lost and embarrassed, and I don’t know what to do next. I can’t seem to bring myself to schedule a fourth session. Am I in denial?\n\n—Victim?\n\nDear Victim,\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI think you are in shock. I often consider how marriage is a kind of secret contract, behind the legal one, that people enter into with another person, and the specifics of everyone’s contract are often very different and known only to the two parties involved. As a result, it’s impossible to see your own marriage clearly or “objectively” the way someone outside of it would; it’s like being asked as a kid to evaluate your childhood when you’re not totally sure what it’s “supposed” to be like. That’s all to say that it’s very, very understandable that you would have a strong reaction when someone from the “outside” has characterized your marriage in a way that doesn’t fit with how you’ve understood it for the past three decades. No one ever sees their relationships clearly when they’re still in them, and especially not when abusive behavior slowly escalates over time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe question that I urge you to consider is not “Have I been in an abusive relationship this whole time?” which will only make you spiral out and feel shame about the past. But more so, “Is my husband behaving abusively?”—which brings your attention to the present. It certainly sounds to me that your husband is exhibiting abusive behavior: making constant threats (which don’t have to be about physical harm) and using the silent treatment (to you and your kids!) are both unequivocally harmful behaviors that no one should have to tolerate in any kind of relationship. Whatever good may have transpired in your marriage in the previous decades simply does not make up for the fact that your husband has started regularly holding your relationship hostage to his whims and moods. Maybe that doesn’t line up with your own idea of what “abusive” behavior looks like, but it is certainly not healthy. While each individual blowup may have been bearable for you, I’m here to tell you that his overall pattern of behavior is not going to serve you or your children going forward.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI think it’s hugely important that you have a counselor or therapist to speak to about how you’d like to proceed with your marriage, but it doesn’t necessarily have to be the one you’re seeing right now. In my experience, a good counselor (especially one who has treated patients in your situation) usually avoids making big judgments like that early in the therapeutic relationship for the exact reason that you just described: Because it will provoke a reaction in the patient to that judgment that ultimately distracts from the real issue at hand. I would encourage you to seek out a counselor who isn’t as worried about categorizing your relationship as “abusive” or “not abusive” as they are about helping you figure out if his behavior—whatever you want to call it—is acceptable or not, and where to go from there.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDear Prudence,\n\nAny tips on surviving the honeymoon phase? I’m in my early twenties, and this is my first romantic relationship, though not my partner’s. A few months in, I believe we’ve moved properly into the honeymoon phase, as being away from one another is agony now! We recently spent six days apart, calling and texting all the while, and it was a complete drag. The seventh day we spent together put me right up to cloud nine. It’s been three days since then, and I truly feel so lonely without her, which is ridiculous. We see each other tomorrow. I am an adult with friends, a job, and a life outside of her. This is a life I’m proud of and happy to have curated for myself. Yet all I want to do at any given moment is be by her side! I’m sure my friends are tired of me bringing her up so often, as much as I try not to. I feel like a teenager. I keep pinching myself that I’ve found love. I’m so lucky she feels the same way. But oh, it hurts to be apart!\n\n—A Silly Inquiry\n\nDear Silly Inquiry,\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOh yes, it definitely sounds like you’re in love. How amazing! Honestly, my first instinct is to just tell you to enjoy it. The agony of being apart, especially in those early days, is a part of the bonding experience, and it reduces even the most independent amongst us into a needy pulp.\n\nMy other thought is a bit contradictory, but I think you can both allow yourself to be swept up while also making a concerted effort to tend to your other priorities. Obviously, you can’t tend to your friends or hobbies at the same level as you did as a single person, and it will feel like a pain to be purposefully separated from your beloved, but you can think of this almost as a form of “emotional exercise.” (A metaphor here might be: Say you have a regular daily work-out routine you enjoy, and now you’re going on vacation. If it’s a short trip, you probably won’t find it useful to hit the gym at all. But if you’re going away for a whole summer, then you will want some kind of new routine, even if it isn’t daily or up to the level you’re used to—just to keep your muscles feeling useful.) What I’m saying is: Eventually your honeymoon phase will even out, and you’ll figure out how to balance all of your priorities along with your relationship. But it’ll be an easier transition overall if you make the effort now to keep up these other parts of your life, even at a minimal level, so it won’t feel too much like “reality” is hitting.\n\n—Delia\n\nClassic Prudie\n\nI, like countless others, have a complicated relationship with my mother-in-law.\n\nShe is negative, casually insulting, and dismissive, and is apparently clueless about how her words and attitude affect others.

This is not unexpected given there have been several air accidents in the first months of 2025. And while commercial air transport is extremely safe, what is making people squeamish has little to do with numbers. Rather it is based on two notions about flying that are as firmly held as they are false.\n\nThe first is that airplane accidents are not survivable. This misconception is the result of the lack of coverage when accidents end with zero fatalities. But low- to no-casualty events are the most common of air accidents: Between 2010 and 2020 there were an average of 29 accidents a year, according to National Transportation Safety Board. In only two of those years, 2010 and 2013, were people killed in any of them.\n\nSo while many people hear the phrase “air accident” and imagine flying into the side of a mountain, plunging into an ice-clogged river, or bursting into flames midair, those horrible events really are the outliers.\n\nIf the numbers alleviate your worries even a smidgen, then it is time to disarm the second fallacy about flying: that there’s nothing you can do should things go wrong on your flight. Because there are actually plenty of things you have control over.\n\nThere are obvious reasons why we, as passengers, feel we cede so much control when flying. To travel by air is to move in a highly restricted environment, and be told where to go, what to do, and when to do it. So circumscribed is our behavior that airline employees sometimes refer to passengers as “self-loading cargo.” Claiming agency over anything at all seems downright revolutionary. And yet, in any unlikely event that disrupts that environment, the prepared jet-setter can shine using the same techniques that have helped pilots, flight attendants, and other passengers who have experienced the big “Uh-oh!” and survived to tell about it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFormer Navy Lt. Greg Fletcher was the pilot during one of the internet’s more curious air accidents in November 1973. While flying a Navy transport plane across a remote region of Iceland, he lost both engines in an ice storm and had to land on a desolate beach on the country’s frigid southern coast. The plane remains where it landed to this day, and is a popular tourist attraction (maybe helped by its appearance in the Justin Bieber music video “I’ll Show You”). Bieber may have made it famous, but it is Fletcher who deserves the applause. By spotting the beach through a brief break in the clouds, he was able to get an unpowered airplane on the ground with all seven people on the flight surviving. (One pilot took a wound to the head, but everyone else was unharmed.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nToday, Fletcher credits the successful outcome to the simple concept of paying attention to what is going on around you. “Situational awareness is one of the most critical factors in aviation. Period,” Fletcher said. “If you are a flight crew, or as a passenger, you have a responsibility to be situationally aware.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis means finding out where the exits are in case you need them in a hurry and spotting any potential obstacles, like baggage on the floor, or sleeping or intoxicated seatmates. It also means making a plan for how you will deal with those things if you need to.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKnowing what’s going on outside the plane is also key during takeoff, approach, and landing. More than half of all accidents occur during these phases of flight. Obliviousness will seriously slow your reaction time, so during these times, window shades should be up and noise-canceling headphones and sleep masks set aside.\n\nMaintaining awareness lets travelers plan their responses should things go wrong. Jerry Schemmel, a play-by-play announcer for the Colorado Rockies, knows that well, because he had a life-changing experience on a United Flight in 1989, when he was 29 years old.\n\n“People don’t survive plane crashes, that’s what I thought,” Schemmel told me. Following the loss of all flight controls on the DC-10 Schemmel was on, pilots were able to get the plane on the ground in a cornfield near the Sioux City, Iowa, airport, though on impact, the fuselage broke into four pieces. Of the 296 people on board, 112 were killed, but 184 survived—mostly those who were seated away from where the plane had split apart.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSchemmel was in Row 23, hanging upside down, when the plane came to a halt. But after freeing himself and running into the field, he returned to the smoke-filled cabin to help others. He heard a baby crying and found an 11-month-old girl who had been tossed on impact into an overhead bin.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDuring the 40 minutes between the emergency and the landing, Schemmel said flight attendants talked to the passengers about what to do and what to expect, making them feel capable. “All of us were so confident we knew everything we needed to know before we crashed,” Schemmel told me.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“We were told what was going to happen. We got ourselves ready. The knowledge, the preparation, the thinking through it—that is what paid off.”\n\nWhat about those who died? Their legacy is embedded in the airplanes you fly on now, in significant and effective improvements in seats and cabin materials that have made them more protective on impact and in case of fire.\n\nI’m no flight attendant, though several years ago for a news story I spent a week training at the Emirates Academy in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. That experience, and 25 years as an air-safety specialist, leads me to add my own tips to the guidance above.\n\nDon’t wear leggings.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhether you’re rocking a $100 pair of Sweaty Bettys or an $8 pair from Target, these chemically produced fibers get hot enough to melt into your skin. The Federal Aviation Administration in 1999 recommended that garments made of cotton, wool, leather, and yes, even denim were preferable over synthetics. I wouldn’t trust every bit of fashion advice from 1999, but this tip remains true today.\n\nWear sensible shoes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd keep them on for takeoff and landing. While fatalities are rare in air accidents, there are plenty of instances where passengers need to get off the plane fast, and it won’t be pretty. The ground could be cold, wet, icy, or hot, or covered in glass, fuel, or airplane debris. You’ll want your shoes on for all of that. Since heels can puncture the evacuation slide, opt for flats with a substantial sole that are easy to get off and on.\n\nAny seat is a safe seat if you’re buckled in.\n\nPeople often ask me what the safest seat on a plane is. There is little to show that location matters. It is demonstrably true, however, that there is lifesaving magic in the seat, the belt, and the structure holding it all to the floor. It is a system designed and tested with your survivability, if not your comfort, in mind. Buckle up and stay that way throughout the flight and you will be protecting yourself—and not a creating an additional hazard by freestyle moshing into those around you during turbulence or an accident.\n\nGet a handle on your gadget.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMany travelers worry about turbulence, but pilots fret most about smoke and fire. This is especially true now that everyone on a plane is toting multiple lithium ion–powered devices. Incidents of smoke and fire emanating from passenger devices have quadrupled over the past 10 years, according to the FAA. On a flight to Miami last summer, a laptop in a carry-on bag started smoking, causing the evacuation of the flight while it was still at the gate; three passengers were injured.\n\nCharging them, dropping them, or even getting them wet could cause the batteries to get hot and smoke or catch fire. So always pay attention to your device and the devices around you.\n\nOne extra tip? Wear your phone on a lanyard while in flight. It won’t drop between the seats or get lost. And you’ll have it when you land—however you land.",

        "source": "https://slate.com/",
        "content": "When he got his first glimpse of a movie studio, Orson Welles excitedly proclaimed it “the biggest electric train set any boy ever had.” But with a reported budget of more than $300 million, Joe and Anthony Russo’s The Electric State makes Welles’ train set look like a busted caboose. The most expensive movie in Netflix’s history, it’s also among the costliest of all time, joining a list that includes the brothers’ own Avengers: Infinity War and Avengers: Endgame. If the Russos are the most profligate creators in history—their Amazon series Citadel is also one of the most expensive TV shows ever made—they’re among the most successful too. Endgame and Infinity War grossed nearly $5 billion in movie theaters alone. And yet for all the money they’re making, and all that they’re allowed to spend, they don’t seem to be enjoying themselves very much.\n\nThe Electric State certainly wants you to think you’re having a good time. Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely, who, with the exception of the typographically doomed Cherry, have written all of the Russos’ movies since 2014’s Captain America: The Winter Soldier, populate their world—an alternate mid-1990s in which labor-saving robots have been a fact of life for nearly four decades—with a range of quirky machines, from animatronic popcorn buckets to a chatty barbershop chair that keeps pestering Chris Pratt’s shaggy metalhead to submit to a haircut. Although the story is set mostly in the aftermath of a war between humanity and robots that cost countless lives, the tone is consistently, even aggressively, chipper. (Humans themselves generally stay at home, puppeteering mechanized exoskeletons they can manipulate from afar through a primitive version of the internet.) Every character speaks in the same quippy, sarcastic patter, and their jokes are double-underlined, first by another character’s shocked response, then by the original speaker’s smug Yeah, I said that smirk.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRelated From Slate Why Netflix’s Most Expensive Movies Keep Getting Worse Read More\n\nA common complaint with modern megabudget movies is that it’s impossible to tell where the money went. Watching the Russos’ nondescript Netflix action thriller The Gray Man, for example, it’s easy to look at its washed-out colors and uninspired set pieces and think, $200 million for that? The Electric State at least looks expensive. Much of the story takes place in the Ex, an arid chunk of the American Southwest that has been turned into a reservation for the defeated robot survivors, where hundreds of intricately designed and meticulously realized sentient devices have gathered in an abandoned shopping mall. There are massive battles in which cars collide with skyscrapers several stories up, and belowground there’s a cavernous lair filled with black-market memorabilia. (In the post-conflict ’90s, G.I. Joe lunch boxes have suddenly become valuable contraband.) And yet the movie suffers from a constant lack, not of resources but of imagination, of inspiration—of, to put it simply, fun.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere are plenty of things in The Electric State that ought to be fun, like the revelation that the robot uprising’s leader was a familiar commercial mascot, a human-sized legume with a top hat and monocle. But when we’re informed that “Mr. Peanut signed the treaty of surrender with President Clinton,” there’s no wink at the underlying absurdity, just a flat recitation of fact. In the movie’s reality, self-governing robots were first realized by Walt Disney in 1955 as a theme-park attraction, and they retain an element of midcentury kitsch, but we never get a chance to linger on the darkly humorous implication that untold thousands of human soldiers must have met death at the hands of an ambulatory doughnut or homicidal pay phone. The story cries out for some of Paul Verhoeven’s consumerist satire, but instead the Russos have chosen to play it as Spielberg—or, more specifically, like the cut-rate Spielberg imitations that clogged multiplexes in the 1980s after E.T.’s runaway success had the studios scrambling to keep up. Its villains, a monomaniac tech mogul (Stanley Tucci) and a bloodthirsty general (Giancarlo Esposito), are like a child’s imagined version of what their parents do at work, inhabiting vacant, generic spaces that tell us nothing about who they are or what they represent.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor most of The Electric State, we’re stuck following Michelle (Millie Bobby Brown), a rebellious teenage foster kid who lost her entire family in a car crash just before the war. For reasons Markus and McFeely’s script can’t be bothered to explain, Michelle becomes convinced that her younger brother somehow survived the accident and is remotely controlling the movements of a robot named Cosmo, a grinning, metallic humanoid with a Bob’s Big Boy pompadour, who clanks his way into her backyard one night. This ought to entail a massive leap of faith, one made even more daunting by the fact that Cosmo speaks only in catchphrases gleaned from a children’s TV show. But the Russos don’t seem to care about a young girl wrestling with the idea that the brother she’s mourned for years might still be alive, so they simply skip past the emotional deadweight and move on to the next eye-catching spectacle. The beats of a Russo brothers movie are so predetermined they don’t bear lingering on, but The Electric State might be the first time they’ve opted to just skip over them altogether.\n\nFor as much as it owes to the Spielberg movies of the ’80s, The Electric State is most directly indebted to Ready Player One, which likewise takes place in a world built of pop-cultural discards and conglomerated intellectual property. But as much film-geek fun as Spielberg had rummaging through the Warner Bros. vault, he at least realized he was creating a dystopia. The Russos don’t see anything viscerally wrong with a world built entirely out of other people’s creations, because that’s how they make movies, bringing nothing of their own but a saw and a bucket of glue. (There’s nothing wrong with pastiche, but you still have to contribute something original.) It doesn’t occur to them that giving the defeated robot army’s military commander a courtly Southern drawl (courtesy of Matthew McConaughey) evokes Confederate nostalgia, any more than they can process the contradiction in putting Captain America at the heart of a ’70s-style paranoid thriller, because they’re just stripping the past for parts. As the music swells at the climax of The Electric State, you start to notice a familiar melody creeping into the underscore, and then you realize: It’s just “Wonderwall.” Why write your own tune when you can buy one from Oasis?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Russos are pushing the boundaries of the film industry’s economics, if nothing else. But they’re branch managers at heart, at their peak when they’re enthusiastically carrying out directives from the head office. Their Marvel movies draw on decades’ worth of comic-book storylines, dreamed up by people whose names are saved for the end-credits crawl, and they put just enough spin on familiar conventions to make audiences feel as if they’re seeing them anew (although, in truth, it’s their inevitability that makes them feel satisfying). But when they have to make something of their own, for a company that now seems content to simply copy whatever’s already popular, it’s almost awe-inspiring how little they come up with. They’ve got the coolest toys imaginable, and all they can think to do is follow the instructions.",

        "source": "https://slate.com/",
        "content": "Dear Prudence is online weekly to chat live with readers. Here’s an edited transcript of this week’s chat.\n\nQ. Big Mother: My mother recently installed an indoor smart camera at our family cabin “for security,” and insists it is left on even when we’re there (i.e. just my husband and I or with my other siblings and their partners, friends, what have you). We all feel very uncomfortable with this, as none of us trust her not to spy on us or use it against us. She insists she’ll never look at it when we’re there and that we’re never to unplug it just in case, but just recently we were up and put a box over it (it has a 360-degree swivel so it’s not as simple as blocking it) and she lost it on us, and said I know who covered it, all but proving our fears that she is using it to spy on us… This feels so invasive and inappropriate, and borderline illegal. It has always been a family cottage that we’ve all shared but now we feel so uncomfortable. Help!\n\nA: If you’re a co-owner of the cabin, stand firm, continue to cover the camera, and let her lose it on you if she wants. If “family cottage that we’ve all shared” translates to “cottage that my parents own and let me use for free,” I’m afraid you’ll have to play by your mom’s rules or head on over to Airbnb.\n\nQ. Sick Breakup: Am I a horrible person for wanting to break up with my boyfriend now that he has a long COVID? My boyfriend and I have been dating for about six months and he got COVID about a month ago. Before that, he was always more into the relationship than I was. I realized shortly before he contracted COVID that there were some big choices he made in his life that I wouldn’t want in a long-term partner. After that point, I was fine with us being in a not-so-serious relationship until one of us wanted out, but I figured he probably wouldn’t want that. I was going to talk to him about this, but then he got COVID. He’s been struggling so much and I feel terrible for him. He hasn’t been up for much fun stuff and he has been leaning on me for help a lot more than before. He has friends he could ask but he keeps saying, “This is stuff a girlfriend is supposed to do.” If I didn’t have such a good support system, I think I’d be miserable. I just want out but that seems like I’d be kicking him when he’s down. To top it all off, he’s good friends with a good friend of mine, so I know this might cause a rift in that friend group. Is there any way I can break up with him without seeming like a horrible person?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA: “Before that, he was always more into the relationship than I was” is all I needed to hear. You’re not breaking up with him because he has a long COVID, you’re breaking up with him because you were never that crazy about him. Not to mention, he’s placing weird gender-based demands on you and seems like a little bit of a jerk. People end relationships all the time. Get out ASAP and I promise you, the friend group will get over it.\n\nQ. The Silver Fox: I am dating a man who is 78 years old. He is cheerful, active, and really seems to get me. My mother is against me seeing him, saying he only sees me as a “trophy girlfriend” and an ego-booster. Prudence, I am 34, and I don’t feel that is too large of an age gap. What should I do?\n\nA: If you like it, I love it. Your mother may be totally right about how he feels, but you are completely grown up and get to make your own choices, and you’re happy. Remind her of that.\n\nQ. Domestically Challenged: I’m a 26-year-old person (they/them) with ADD. I struggle a lot with executive functioning; messy rooms, laundry piling up, dishes sitting out… (Due to my physical and mental health, I currently live at home.) I don’t like being messy, but no matter how hard I try I can’t get past that barrier. I have found over the years that I function best when I live with someone else; when I’ve lived alone for school the mess has been even worse, there’s been no structure to my days, and I’ve often ended up skipping meals (or filling up on snacks), whereas in a shared space I feel responsible for cooking a real meal for everyone and keeping to a schedule, and I feel bad if I let stuff pile up too much. Part of it is a division of labor—if I cook and someone else does the dishes, of course, the dishes get done—but part of it is just me needing external motivation. What I’m concerned about is this: If I ever have the means to move out, and if I end up living with a potential future partner, isn’t that unfair to them? Surely even someone who loves me won’t want to be responsible for making sure I behave like a functional adult? I feel an enormous amount of shame about my inability to handle this on my own, and I’m worried that it will sour any romantic relationship beyond repair. Will it?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA: I think stigma around having ADD has made you feel like your challenges are somehow more shameful than those of people who don’t have a diagnosis. They’re not! Everyone brings their own stuff to a relationship, including some qualities that could be considered “unfair” to a partner. Student loan debt. Ailing parents. Seasonal affective disorder. Hair that falls out and clogs up the tub. Snoring. A person who wants to be in a relationship with you will do it because you’ve been honest about what it’s like to live with you and because they’ve decided the good qualities you bring to the table balance out your shortcomings. Be totally transparent about what you can and can’t do, what you’re working on (there probably are some strategies you could use, with the help of a counselor or coach), and what’s a permanent part of your life. And make sure you remember that you have strengths and delightful quirks, too (you didn’t list them but I’m sure you do). There’s more to being in a relationship than housekeeping.\n\nQ. Ballet: I’m a senior in high school. One thing that I’ve always loved is ballet. I love watching it and analyzing it, and I used to dance when I was very young. However, I had to be pulled out because I kept getting skin infections and lung problems. Even now, I still look back on that and I feel sick because of how much I wanted to continue. I remember crying in my parents’ arms when they told me I wouldn’t go back. I tried to forget it until two people came into my life. Both are incredibly skilled dancers, both with experience in ballet. So much so that one of them does it professionally, and the other is currently being recruited. Every single time they bring up their experiences I can’t help but feel some jealousy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI value both of them highly, one of them is my best friend. I would defend them to the moon and back! I can’t just go “Hey, whenever you bring up the fact you’re literally basically a pro in what was one of my dreams as a kid it kinda makes me feel like crawling in a sewer and getting eaten by a croc!” and ask them never to talk about it. They’re passionate about what they do, and I love that for them! I attend performances, compliment their dancing, and I will happily watch videos they show me about their skills. I just feel so terrible about being so jealous of something that will never come to fruition for me.\n\nI don’t want to go into ballet professionally anymore—and there is no possible way I could. From what I’ve seen, I don’t even have a chance to go en pointe. But still, seeing two close people in my life excel in something that I barely ever had a chance to do makes me almost want to mourn, and I don’t even know why. It’s been almost 10 years. How do I get over this?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA: Congratulations on handling the jealousy. Seriously. It says a lot about you that you’ve been such a good, supportive friend to these people who remind you so much of something you desperately want for yourself.\n\nNow listen carefully: Sign up for a ballet class! Your health is better now. You’re barely older than Misty Copeland was when she started! I’m not saying you’ll go pro—I believe you that you won’t. And I’ll take your word for it that you might not even go en pointe. But you love ballet and you can do ballet a few times a week if you want. You don’t have to keep getting better and better. You can just do as much ballet as your body allows, and enjoy it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen, and if, you feel like you’ve maxed out, I can see one of two scenarios happening: Either you shift to a different kind of dance (like modern, hip-hop, or tap that gives you a new challenge, a new group of people to learn with, and opportunities to perform) or you find a way to get involved in ballet in a different way. Could you teach toddlers? Or work at a dance summer camp? Or get a part-time job doing something on the administrative side for a studio or company? The opportunities are endless and I really believe your passion will lead you to something that’s a much better use of your time and energy than suppressing jealousy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJenée Desmond-Harris: That’s it for today, friends. Talk to you next time!\n\nDiscuss this column on our Facebook page!\n\nMore Advice From Slate\n\nLast weekend, my wife’s and my mutual friend had a pool party for her 16-year-old daughter’s birthday party (at our condo pool). The birthday girl invited male and female schoolmates to the party, all around 15-to-17-year-olds. My wife started to put on her one-piece swimsuit to join the swimming until I stopped her.

        "content": "This is Checking Out, a column about how we shop, what we buy, and how it all makes us feel. Email tips and ideas to checking.out@slate.com.\n\nThere are two types of kitchens.\n\nWell, there are many types of kitchens—but in the world of influencer kitchens, of the kind you might see on your For You page, there are two polarities. On one side, the crunchy or trad or zero-waste kitchen, with its mason jars full of sourdough starter and unpasteurized milk. At the other end of the spectrum is the containerized kitchen, with its dozens of plastic storage vessels and “Refill my snack drawer” single-serving approach. In both kitchens, we see a panoply of clear jars, an attention to display, and an affection for decanting.\n\nThe people who run these kitchens seem to have very little in common. The crunchy creator lives in a world of linen aprons and label-less bottles. The container influencer hasn’t handled a raw ingredient since Obama was in office. And neither of them has very much in common with us, the noninfluencer class, who cook and eat in serviceable but generally less aesthetic ways. You could argue that these kitchens aren’t even real—they’re stage sets where creators perform stories about food and style and health for vociferous audiences.\n\nHowever, what I see in both these kitchens is a bone-deep anxiety around the ways we currently relate to food: how we buy, store, cook, and eat it. The crunchy kitchen and the container kitchen present two equally mythic visions of domestic care and nourishment. Each one offers an identity that can be adopted and, with that, a set of rituals and stylistic tropes intended to protect the family from contaminants, scarcity, or both.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe founding myth that underlies the crunchy kitchen is the vision of the peasant kitchen, where food is as natural as can be and is fully embedded in the great flow of life. “The peasant meal is in the middle of the day, surrounded by work,” writes John Berger in his 1976 essay “The Eaters and the Eaten,” a comparison of bourgeois and peasant modes of consumption. What is vital about the peasant kitchen is its sense of contiguity. The main meal takes place in the center of the day, eating happens in the same room where the food has been cooked, and food passes from hand to hand, from field to basket to kitchen table, with each person slicing off a chunk from the communal loaf. “The relationship between implements, food and eaters is intimate,” writes Berger. The peasant sees where their food came from—they or a neighbor likely grew or raised it—and receives it as kin.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe preindustrial cadence of rural life, a time before the invention of Dusen Dusen pepper grinders and frozen lasagna, is what the tradwives of Instagram are channeling, though they can muster only a shallow simulacrum of it. Still, in crunchy kitchens as diverse as the zero-waste haven of Alessandro Vitale and the God-and-guns suburbia of Gwen the Milkmaid, the valorization of unadulterated ingredients and “from scratch” production all hark back to an era when mealtime sprang directly from land and labor—the crunchy kitchen spans the political spectrum. In the notably rustic-lux Ballerina Farm kitchen, children scamper underfoot as Hannah Neeleman curdles whole milk into a fresh cheese, the ingredients and the children alike contributing to the sense of a room attuned to nature’s wholesome rhythms. Never mind that the dreamy kitchen is a product more of industrial family wealth than of rural toil; the production of simplicity that takes place on-screen is enough.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe mythic image of the peasant kitchen also shows up in other parts of the food world, especially in recent years, as “slow food” and farm-to-table cooking have exploded into the mainstream. Chad Robertson’s sourdough bible, Tartine Bread, begins its heartfelt preface with a painting that calls back to Berger’s bread-loving peasant. “My strongest inspiration came not from real bread but from images—images of a time and place when bread was the foundation of a meal and at the center of daily life,” writes Robertson. He describes a large rustic loaf “held close to the heart,” sliced toward the body in a communal sacrament, representing an elemental and ancient loaf unsullied by ultra-processing or bleached flour.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCentrally, the fantasy driving the elemental loaf and the Ballerina Farm mozzarella is that it’s a raw product that has never touched packaging or industrial processing. Carried hand to hand from one person to another, poured from vessel to vessel, the ingredients’ essence is maintained and protected, avoiding the contamination and abstraction of the super-processed supermarket product. In the crunchy kitchen, food has aura. This aura is enhanced through the aesthetic of the kitchens themselves: raw wood, ceramic, metal. Unadorned implements and ingredients visible in glass containers. Nothing that would diminish the purity of the milk or leach BPAs into the rising poolish. Some version of this has manifested in the content of protein-obsessive, macro-counting creators, with their unsettling repasts of ground beef and banana presented on a wooden cutting board as though something as conventional as a plate would disturb the integrity of the meal.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMany of these tropes strike me as a series of fretful rituals to ensure (and demonstrate) that the food being consumed is safe and pure. Fretting is understandable. The modern supermarket is full of perils that threaten the crunchy home, from listeria outbreaks to emulsifiers with multisyllabic names and additives that are illegal in Europe. It is the contiguity at the heart of the modern-day peasant kitchen that promises safety: If you watch the ingredients carefully as they pass from field to casserole dish, if they are free of “interference” from Big Ag or unfamiliar processes, if you understand your relation to the food and cut the loaf toward your heart, then no harm will come from what you eat.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhere the peasant kitchen has glass jars full of raw ingredients, the containerized kitchen is stocked with single-serve pouches. It is a kitchen of clicks and clacks, of ASMR, of packets ripped open and weekly restock hauls. This is not a landscape in which someone strains curds with a square of cheesecloth—we are far from the ingredient kitchen. In Khloé Kardashian’s infamous kitchen pantry, every product can be found in multiples, arranged across the huge expanse like strange found-object sculptures. TikTokers like Julie Kay and Catherine Benson make hay from the visual splendor of the well-apportioned kitchen, stocking their refrigerators like a particularly fancy hotel minibar and doing things with Tupperware you could never imagine. This is a space where consistent units are moved and sorted, the food itself playing second fiddle to the process of organization.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUnlike the natural and holistic appearance of the crunchy kitchen, the container kitchen is akin to a retail logistics space, with stocking instead of harvesting. Here, ingredients and foodstuffs have no aura in themselves—in fact, the unpackaged ingredient represents disorder and unpredictability, something to be managed rather than revered. Modern life is stressful and chaotic. The clear vessels of the container kitchen (its main aesthetic connection to the crunchy kitchen) and the omnipresent single-serving packets represent organization, visibility, and predictability.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn these containerized kitchens, we see the bourgeois meal updated for a new century. In the 19th-century bourgeois household of Berger’s description, “everything that can be is kept untouched and separate. Every dish has its own cutlery and plate. … The meal is a series of discrete, untouched gifts.” Clearly, patterns of commerce and consumption have changed beyond recognition from the kitchens Berger describes. What remains consistent is that in these kitchens, food is abstracted from its source and re-presented as something new. It is packaged and commodified, wrested from its continuity with the world and from its intimate relation to the body.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRelated From Slate Influencers Taught Us How to Overconsume. Can They Also Help Us Break the Habit? Read More\n\nNot everyone who maintains a containerized kitchen is bourgeois, of course. For many, the individualism and accumulation of the container kitchen is aspirational, a way of demonstrating plenitude and sufficiency regardless of your actual class position or relation to labor and ownership. Despite the room’s appearance as a kind of mini-warehouse, the container creator in these videos is not playing the role of the warehouse worker. They are the warehouse owner, overseeing the inputs and outputs and running the household as an efficient enterprise.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe anxious decanting of the container influencer points to a fear of scarcity or disorder. This seems reasonable: Have you tried to buy eggs lately? Have you heard the news at all? Grocery shopping is more of a trial than ever, as the retail spaces that once offered customer-focused pleasure increasingly resemble just another logistics space, while online ordering adds another layer of anhedonic abstraction. In this fragmented landscape, the way to cope is by becoming a manager, embracing industrial processes and the logic of logistics to ensure that the food supply reflects the cleanliness and order of the distribution center.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBeneath the rusticity of the crunchy kitchen and the plasticity of the container kitchen lies a dysfunctional relationship to our contemporary American food landscape. Crunchiness and containerization offer a retreat into aesthetics, as well as a rubric for manifesting safety and security in an insecure time. These myths can have malign consequences, as is clear to anyone tracking the MAHA movement or worried about the environmental scourge of single-use plastics. The container kitchen glosses over the violence and harms enacted by the logistical frameworks it apes—the labor of gig workers and warehouse workers alike is purposely kept from view, and the consequences of the weekly pallets of bottled water are less important than the visual thrill of the fridge restock. The peasant kitchen is inclined toward nativism and xenophobia; Berger describes the peasant’s aversion to “foreign” provisions, which are not part of the intimate local foodway and are thus unknowable and untrustworthy. This plays out today as a fixation on tradition (which can be a dog whistle for whiteness and patriarchal family structures) and a suspicion of technological intervention, even if it means forgoing the vital public health benefits of pasteurization or vaccination.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUltimately, the pageantry of these kitchen archetypes is disconnected from the real lives of the people playing them out. The home kitchen is not a distribution center, and most container influencers lack the resources to absorb endless price increases without the whole edifice falling apart. The supposedly unalienated family hearth of the peasant is long gone, and the emphasis on “family” of today’s trad influencer tends to be deployed to enforce conservative values or to discipline the labor force they rely on by claiming there is no need to delineate between owners and workers (as Robertson did when the Tartine bakery staff attempted to unionize). In the crunchy kitchen, we’re all family. Except we’re not.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt a time when stricter government control on food seems increasingly unlikely, and global supply chains grow more fragile due to climate change and economic turmoil, it makes sense to seek comfort and certainty where we can. For some of us, that self-soothing means playing out a version of rustic life or managerial life in our own kitchen. For others, watching professional tradwives or fridge restockers on a screen in 15-, 30-, or 60-second clips provides the reassurance and repetition missing from our uncertain culinary lives. It may be thin consolation, but during the brief moments we’re there in the mythic kitchen, we get to be part of the illusion too.",

Now, he might get that chance. On Jan. 28, Florida Rep. Anna Paulina Luna introduced legislation directing the secretary of the Interior to “arrange” for the carving of Trump on Mount Rushmore and add his portrait to those of Washington, Jefferson, Lincoln, and Theodore Roosevelt. The idea has received support from Republican members of Congress, conservative media, and Elon Musk, who even offered to help chisel Trump’s visage into the granite.\n\nIt is easy to understand why Trump and the broader MAGA movement have become fixated on Mount Rushmore, favoring the large sculpture in the Black Hills of South Dakota over other iconic American monuments like the Statue of Liberty or Lincoln Memorial. Ever since Donald Trump spoke at Rushmore on July 3, 2020, holding a highly unusual political rally at a nonpartisan national park, the memorial and the 60-foot faces that compose it have seemed, to many, allied with Trump’s version of American history and identity—one that champions the idea of America’s manifest destiny and the righteousness of our past and founding ideals.\n\nThis framing is reflective of how the memorial’s sculptor, Gutzon Borglum, originally conceived of his work of art. In August 1924, South Dakota state historian Doane Robinson asked Borglum whether he would be interested in carving a “heroic” sculpture in the Black Hills. Borglum was then working on the mammoth Confederate Memorial at Stone Mountain—he was enmeshed politically, financially, and personally with the Ku Klux Klan—and Robinson reached out because of Borglum’s experience carving portraits into granite.\n\nAs American commodities prices cratered following World War I, Robinson sought ways to diversify South Dakota’s rural economy. He struck on an idea to carve representations of the American West into the granite pinnacles of the Central Black Hills: The Lakota leader Red Cloud, Lewis and Clark, George Armstrong Custer. He envisioned works of art that would attract car tourists and bring money to a depressed state, but when he invited Borglum to join as sculptor, the project’s tenor shifted.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBorglum first saw Rushmore a year after receiving Robinson’s letter. In August 1925, in search of a location for his sculpture, Borglum was being guided on horseback through the Black Hills when he was shown a gnarled, knobby shelf of granite almost 2 billion years old. Native communities called the mountain Igmu Tanka Paha, Cougar Mountain, and Tunkasila Sakpe Paha, the Six Grandfathers. But when Borglum first saw the mountain, it had been renamed after New York City lawyer Charles Rushmore, who had been representing tin-mine investors when he rode around the mountain in 1885 and provided its eponym.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBorglum dismounted from his horse, climbed up the mountain face in an ascot, golf pants, and cowboy hat, and began to transform Rushmore into the political monument we know today. “A group of Empire makers,” he wrote in his journal that night. “Jefferson = Lincoln = Roosevelt.” George Washington, though omitted from this equation, had always been present in Borglum’s vision of a sculpture that would represent the manifest destiny that had shaped the United States. Borglum believed the American political system was the apotheosis of human civilization, and he wanted his sculpture to stand alongside the Parthenon and pyramids as testaments to grand civilizations and cultures.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt is this vision of American history and identity that Trump’s second administration has championed in its early weeks. Trump has advocated for expansionist American policies both abroad and in outer space, renamed nature to fit his nationalist vision, and promoted a distinctive view of American history, culture, and identity. In many ways, the idea of including Trump among this group makes a certain kind of historical sense. It certainly reflects the memorial’s thorny origins as a monument to “Empire makers.”\n\nBut as I’ve learned while researching my upcoming history of the memorial, Mount Rushmore has come to mean something different in the 100 years since Gutzon Borglum’s hike. Placing Trump on Mount Rushmore would add even more conflict to the memorial’s already contentious existence, would reduce its audience, and would narrow our historical narratives.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe name “Black Hills” derives from the Lakota term Paha Sapa or He Sapa, Black Hills or Black Ridge, descriptions that distill the beauty of the ponderosa pine as they appear from a distance: a lush, black oasis that rises above the plains. The name also underscores the historical conflict of who owns the land Mount Rushmore sits on. In 1868, after the two-year Red Cloud’s War, a beleaguered United States signed the Treaty of Fort Laramie. The treaty gave the lands of today’s western South Dakota to the Lakota Nation, an area that included the Black Hills, which many Native American tribes relied on for food, shelter, and medicine, and that are still sacred and holy today—the home of ceremonies, myths, and origin stories.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTraces of gold were found in the hills in 1874, however, and after Custer’s 7th Cavalry was routed at the Battle of Little Bighorn in June 1876, an enraged United States forced the handover of the Black Hills and the annulment of the 1868 treaty. It was an action that has been described by American federal courts as “a ripe and rank case of dishonest dealing,” and many in the Lakota Nation and broader Native American community see Mount Rushmore as a reminder of this action and the damage wrought by Europeans and Americans as we moved west in pursuit of the manifest destiny that Trump and his movement idealize.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat Mount Rushmore exists on stolen, sacred land is well documented. And though South Dakota and the memorial have grappled with this historical complexity—some would say not enough—what is at stake both at Mount Rushmore and in the discussion over whether to include Trump is historical narrative, historical memory, and historical truth. They are debates that reflect our contemporary moment, when the narratives of our past inform the policies of our present, when national memories shape American identity, and when simple historical truths—such as that the Capitol was attacked on Jan. 6, 2021, by a Trump-inspired mob, or that Russia invaded Ukraine—are contested.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHistorical memory is at the heart of Mount Rushmore. Few know that instead of commemorating four important presidents or embodying its moniker as the “Shrine of Democracy,” Mount Rushmore National Memorial was built to commemorate the first 150 years of the United States. This emphasis on American history is why placing Trump on Mount Rushmore would be so troublesome. Trump tells a national history rife with errors, a sanitized story that omits the complexity—alternately ugly and hopeful, bitter and beneficent, full of violence and ingenuity—that makes the history of the United States so compelling and remarkable. The best memorials and monuments reflect these complicated histories, and though they are often physically staid and immutable, the meanings of monuments evolve.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRushmore embodies this evolution. When Borglum orchestrated the first dedication of Mount Rushmore in 1925, the emphasis was on “Empire,” on manifest destiny. By the time construction halted on Halloween, 1941, five weeks before the United States was attacked at Pearl Harbor, Rushmore had shifted to being the “Shrine of Democracy.” When we emerged victorious following World War II, Rushmore became synonymous with freedom. As we grew to understand the complicated relationship many Native communities have with the mountain of Rushmore, the memorial evolved to include the rich history and culture of the more than 20 tribes that have historic ties with the Black Hills. Today, in large part because of his speech in 2020, Rushmore has come to reflect Trump and the MAGA movement. Conservatives like Rep. Luna want to capitalize on this latest shift of meaning to alter Rushmore to fit this moment.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYet through all these changes of meaning, the sculpture itself has been unchanged. This is in part due to geology, as the National Park Service has said no room on the mountain exists for another face. But beyond this fact—facts don’t faze Trump—I like to also think it is due to our understanding of historical evolution. How we view our country’s history in 2025 will not reflect how we view it 10, 20, or 100 years from now. As it is, Rushmore struggles to be a memorial for all Americans, and this struggle is part of its power, part of its complexity. If Trump were to be carved next to Lincoln, the potential Rushmore holds to interrogate our dominant national narratives would be squandered, its audience diminished by a man and movement that are of a moment. Carving Trump onto Mount Rushmore would diminish that complexity and cause the memorial to lose resonance for many Americans. But since Trump and his supporters have consistently shown little regard for these concerns, we may yet see Trump’s portrait in the Black Hills.",

        "content": "Sign up for the Slatest to get the most insightful analysis, criticism, and advice out there, delivered to your inbox daily.\n\nWhen the first Trump administration separated thousands of immigrant children from their parents, there was massive public outcry at the cruelty of family separation. Then the administration admitted something extraordinary: The cruelty was the point.\n\nNow, the cruelty is back. This time, immigration officials are threatening to prioritize unaccompanied immigrant children for deportation, while at the same time working to deprive them of access to legal services and representation. These moves in tandem would destabilize the lives of hundreds of thousands of children, putting them at heightened risk of violence, exploitation, and trafficking. They would also unlawfully deprive children of the very legal services that Congress has provided to protect them from these harms.\n\nIn 2008, Congress passed the William Wilberforce Trafficking Victim Protection Reauthorization Act, or TVPRA, which provides enhanced protections for children—including immigrant children—who are particularly vulnerable to trafficking and exploitation. Under the TVPRA, the government is required to “ensure, to the greatest extent practicable” that unaccompanied immigrant children “have counsel to represent them in legal proceedings” and “to protect them from mistreatment, exploitation, and trafficking,” including from harms perpetrated by the government.\n\nCourts have interpreted the mandate that the government provide these children with legal services “to the greatest extent practicable” to require a real, substantive effort on the government’s part to get kids lawyers. Historically, this has meant that Congress has appropriated substantial funds, and relevant agencies have contracted with nonprofit legal services providers to provide representation for children. The current federal contract for legal services is administered by the Acacia Center for Justice, for which I serve on the Academic Advisory Board. That contract is ordinarily renewed by the agency on a regular basis. The current contract is set to expire at the end of March, and for the first time in nearly two decades—despite continued Congressional funding—its future is uncertain. What is certain, however, is that failing to renew the contract would be catastrophic.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRelated From Slate What’s the Deal With Amy Coney Barrett Lately? Read More\n\nThe impact that legal services have for these kids can hardly be overstated: Children who have lawyers are nearly 300 percent more likely to obtain relief from an immigration judge than those who don’t. This is not because lawyers are finding secret loopholes in the law. Rather, it’s because lawyers are adults who are trained in and understand the law, and who can facilitate a child’s ability to tell their story to obtain the relief to which they are legally entitled. Immigration law is a complex web of dense statutes and regulations, precise procedural requirements, and high evidentiary demands, conducted through proceedings that often involve multiple agencies and courts. The government is represented by its own capable attorneys who prosecute children in immigration court. It is absurd to think that children could navigate this system and effectively assert their rights alone. Under federal law, and for their own physical safety, they should not have to.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd yet, the Trump administration is trying to undermine the existing statutory scheme that protects children. On Feb. 18, as part of its chaotic and destabilizing efforts to defund the federal government, the Trump administration suddenly issued an unlawful stop-work order requiring that organizations that provide legal services to unaccompanied immigrant children cease their operations indefinitely. Three days later, just as capriciously, the administration changed its mind and rescinded the order.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere is no doubt that the administration will continue its efforts to undermine access to counsel for unaccompanied immigrant children. This is an administration led by a president who has shown an unabashed willingness to interfere with access to counsel across the board. On Feb. 25, President Donald Trump signed an executive action directing agencies to revoke security clearances for all attorneys employed by the law firm representing former special counsel Jack Smith, which would make it impossible for these attorneys and firms to work on cases involving classified information. The executive action further penalized the law firm—simply for representing someone the president dislikes—by effectively barring the government from doing business with the firm. While signing it, Trump said, “Wait, I just want to savor this one, please.” He then indicated that he would be “doing this with other firms as time goes by,” issuing a clear threat to lawyers who dare to challenge him and his policies.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA week later, Trump issued an even broader (and unconstitutional) executive action targeting another law firm—this time, Perkins Coie—for the “dishonest and dangerous activity” of, basically, representing Trump’s political rivals.\n\nWeaponizing the office of the president to specifically target lawyers who represent people or causes that Donald Trump disfavors is a dangerous move that violates the rule of law and pushes us from a government of laws toward a government of principally one man. Just because Trump has declared himself to be the king doesn’t mean he actually is one. The president’s powers are limited under our Constitution, and any presidential action to unilaterally eliminate access to counsel for unaccompanied children would violate the substance and the spirit of existing laws duly enacted by Congress.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs I tell my constitutional law students, our federal government is built on a system of checks and balances that requires coordination and pushback among the branches to work well. When the president overreaches in his assertions of executive power, it’s imperative that our other institutions—Congress and the courts—stand up for due process and the rule of law. And, in a democracy like ours, it’s imperative that We, the People, hold our government to account when it falls short.\n\nIn this case, holding our government to account includes ensuring that unaccompanied immigrant children continue to receive access to legal services. As the Trump administration moves to prioritize unaccompanied children for deportation, these kids will need lawyers to ensure that they have a fighting chance to have what we all want for our own kids—safety, security, and a chance to thrive as they grow up.",

Submit it here or post it in the Slate Parenting Facebook group.\n\nDear Care and Feeding,\n\nI am not a parent, but this advice column was recommended to me by a friend who’s a mom. I’m 34 years old and found out I was pregnant a few days ago.\n\nI absolutely do NOT want to have kids, ever. I’ve been using birth control pills, but I know they’re not always 100 percent. When I saw the test, my husband and I both immediately knew I needed to schedule an abortion (luckily, I live in a state where reproductive healthcare is very easy to access). I have the procedure scheduled in a week.\n\nHere’s the problem: My mother has a pattern of violating boundaries. I don’t know why, but the next time I saw her, I blurted out that I was panicked because of the positive test. I was crying and really stressed, and her response was … not great. She hugged me and told me congratulations and immediately started giving me parenting advice. I told her there was no way in hell I was continuing the pregnancy. Since then, she will not stop calling me and texting me, trying to convince me to keep it. My mother was extremely abusive (we had CPS show up multiple times when I was young), and I do not want to repeat those patterns. I have PTSD and am in treatment for it from my childhood experiences. She keeps talking about how she was single, poor, very young, and unprepared to have me, but she’s “so happy” she did it anyway. I finally blew a gasket and basically told her, “You keep telling me about why YOU are happy and how it gave YOU a purpose, but have you ever thought about how your lack of preparedness affected me?”\n\nI told her that her line of reasoning was extremely selfish and that she was more focused on her feelings and wants than the safety and wellbeing of her children and theoretical grandchildren, and I wasn’t going to do that in my own life. I ended the conversation by saying even if I had the best childhood ever, this is my life and decision, as ultimately the burden of parenthood would be on me and my husband, no one else. She absolutely freaked out, called me names, and tried to call and text so many times I had to block her from my phone. My question is: Was I too harsh on her? Should I apologize? Or is this even a relationship worth maintaining? This whole ordeal has stressed me out to the point of not eating or sleeping. I know I shouldn’t have told her, but it was just a moment of panic. I really just never want to talk about this with her ever again. And is there a way for me to set some boundaries around my privacy? This has all made me realize maybe she has way too much information about my life, and I don’t think she’s earned a super-close relationship with me.\n\n—No Kids Wanted\n\nDear No Kids Wanted,\n\nI know how incredibly polarizing the abortion topic is, so I’ll just start by saying that I believe every person with a uterus should have the right to do whatever they want with their body. However, the only opinion that should matter regarding this isn’t mine or your mom’s, but yours.\n\nThe way you handled your mom is fine with me because you kept it real. Could you have been a little softer? Perhaps, but I’m not going to fault you for having years of unresolved childhood trauma bubble to the surface in a heated moment.\n\nHowever, not eating or sleeping is a big problem. I think you should apologize for anything hurtful you may have said to help rid yourself of guilt, but in doing so, you also need to set clear and firm boundaries. You can say something along the lines of, “Mom, I’m sorry for being mean, but this is a really stressful situation for me. To be clear, I have no desire to be a mother, and I’m going through with the procedure—and if we’re going to have any relationship at all, I need you to respect that decision. I also do not want to talk about this ever again.”\n\nAt that point, you both will have a decision to make. She’ll either fall in line, and you can continue managing your complex relationship, or she’ll defy your wishes, which means you’ll have to learn to love her from a distance. Either way, you shouldn’t be forced to maintain a relationship with anyone, blood-related or otherwise, who doesn’t respect how you choose to live your life.\n\n—Doyin\n\nMore Advice From Slate\n\nMy wife of more than 10 years has always been a bit of a nudist.

Submit it here.\n\nDear Care and Feeding,\n\nMy ex died when my daughter was 13 and my son was 17. He wasn’t a good partner, but he was a devoted dad. His death devastated my kids, especially my daughter. I ended my long-term relationship at the time because, in her grief, my daughter became very hostile towards my boyfriend. I had to get a second job to make ends meet and put my daughter in therapy.\n\nThe problem is that a decade later, my daughter still acts like that. Any time I mention seeing anyone, she gets cold and hostile. It got worse the few times she has come home to live after college. She interrogates me about my comings and goings like I am a criminal on probation. She ended a childhood friendship because I dared to start dating her friend’s father. It is exhausting and frustrating because no matter what I say or do, it never sinks in with her. My daughter moved across the state last year to live with a boyfriend she had only been seeing for a few months. I love her, but it was a weight off my chest to have the house back to myself.\n\nMost recently, I ended up reconnecting with the man I had been dating when my ex died. It is like nothing has changed between us, and we are talking marriage. We have plans for him to move in with me. My son was delighted when I broke the news, and my daughter threw a fit. She ranted and raved, and something in me finally snapped. I told her this obsession with my love life has lasted too long. She doesn’t have to like or pretend to be happy for me, but she needs to grow up and act civil. I am the parent, and she is the child; she doesn’t get to control me.\n\nShe didn’t talk to me for several weeks, and then, out of the blue, she announced she was moving back home. I told her no. She screamed at me that I was an awful mother who always chose men over my children. I told her that she and her brother would always be my priority, but they were adults now. I get to put me and my life first sometimes, and she needs to stop punishing me for the death of her dad. She screamed that her dad would never do this to her, and I blurted out that her dad had been cheating on me with girls younger than she was. That is why he stopped being a teacher and went into sales.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI immediately regretted it. I never told my children the reason for the divorce. I didn’t want to tarnish their father in their eyes. My daughter hung up on me and blocked my number. She is talking to her cousins, so my sister gives me some second-hand information, but I am just so frustrated I want to cry. My son thinks his sister is mentally ill and needs professional help. He told her that, and she blocked him too. My partner thinks moving in together might be a bad idea, and that my daughter needs a little more time to adjust to the situation. It has been years. I love my daughter, but am tired of putting my life on hold. I sent her a card for her birthday with an apology and asked if we could start fresh. She hasn’t responded. So what now?\n\n—Torn Mother\n\nDear Torn Mother,\n\nI think your son may be right about your daughter needing some help; at this stage of her life, she shouldn’t be this bothered about the prospect of her mother dating. Continue reaching out to her and letting her know that you want to fix your relationship, but that she has to accept you having a life of your own. If you’re able to establish sustained contact with her, encourage her to get some professional help. In the meantime, continue your plans with your partner and live as you see fit; you deserve to be happy and you’ve sacrificed that for your daughter long enough. You can’t force her to talk to you, she’s going to have to decide for herself that she wants to reconnect. Stop putting your life on hold for her; it’s time to focus on yourself.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGet parenting and family advice—submit a question!

I am disabled and unable to work full-time. Moving out isn’t feasible for us. My daughter, “Sonia,” won a scholarship to an elite private school. She is doing well but is struggling to carve out the peace she needs to study. She shares a room with her two younger cousins who adore her, but they can’t figure out why Sonia can’t just drop her school work to play pretend like she did before. It doesn’t help that my sister will contradict me and send her girls to Sonia when she gets tired of their antics.\n\nI have been letting Sonia stay in my room with the door locked when she needs to study, but everything blew up when one of her cousins went in and took and hid her school laptop and didn’t confess for three days. Sonia was beside herself with worry since we would have to pay to replace it, and she ended up failing a major test. My niece finally brought the laptop out, and I had to get between my daughter and her. Sonia was fixing to hit her cousin and hard.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI made Sonia apologize, but I didn’t punish her. This enraged my sister, who says there is never an excuse for violence. I pointed out that she encouraged her daughters and that she didn’t punish her daughter for lying and the theft. Sonia refuses to have anything to do with her cousins now. She yells at them to go away and leave her alone. She tells them that she hates them, and it causes her cousins to act out more and more. I moved her bed into my room, but this is only a temporary stopgap. The tension is sky-high in the house, and even my parents are fighting about it. I don’t know what to do here. My ex lives overseas and hasn’t seen Sonia since she was 3. I don’t have any other friends or family to turn to. Help!\n\n—Trapped\n\nDear Trapped,\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCall the entire household together for a meeting. Acknowledge that things have been difficult since the laptop incident but that you all need peace in order to survive in your shared home. Talk about Sonia’s challenges in studying and encourage her to share how she felt about failing her test and being generally unable to concentrate on her work. Explain that her cousins are missing the days when she could freely play with them and allow them to share their feelings as well. Talk about Sonia almost hitting her cousin and how violence can’t be tolerated in the home. Allow your parents and sister to speak their piece. Ask that Sonia and her cousins commit to respecting each other’s space. Continue to let your daughter use your room as a quiet place when she needs it. Ask your sister and parents to support your efforts in getting the girls to get along; remind them of what a tremendous opportunity your daughter has with her scholarship and that you’ll need everyone’s support for her to succeed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCatch Up on Care and Feeding\n\n· Missed earlier columns this week? Read them here.\n\n· Discuss this column in the Slate Parenting Facebook group!\n\nDear Care and Feeding,\n\nI’m in the middle of a divorce right now. We have a 3-year-old son and a 4-year-old daughter. We both wanted kids and had many discussions about how we would/wouldn’t raise them, but the reality was far from what my husband had imagined. As the kids came out of the baby stage, he was utterly unable to cope with the stress that came with toddlers. He would regularly yell at either/both kids for completely normal 1-to-3-year-old things (accidentally spilling a drink, taking forever to put on socks/shoes, etc.) and get extremely angry and defensive with me anytime I tried to talk to him about it. He refused to change his habits at all, keeping his boys’ nights, organizational commitments, and picking up overtime (that wasn’t financially needed) without ever speaking to me about it. Meanwhile, I have been away from the house at bedtime a total of six times since our second was born because he gets so overwhelmed by our well-established routine.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen he stayed overnight at work one night with no notice, and I realized I was relieved because it meant I wouldn’t have to worry about him getting angry at us, I knew I had to make a change. I told him how bad I saw it had become and gave him real examples of how we had all been affected over the last few months. I told him I wanted to start couples counseling and that I thought he should do individual counseling as well to work on his responses to stress and anger. Predictably (but heartbreakingly), he said no and told me if I thought he was that terrible of a husband and father, I should divorce him. I asked him again a week later, and he said the same thing. So, I started the process.\n\nI hate it. I hate that the man I loved so profoundly has disappeared to be replaced by this angry, bitter man and that this divorce is only going to cement the negative personality in place even more. I hate that he won’t put the work in to keep our relationship and our family together when we used to seem like the most important thing in the world to him. I hate that I now have to worry about what custody will look like and if our kids are okay when they are with him on their own or if he’s angry and yelling the whole time. I hate (while also being very thankful) that he requested very limited custody because what does that say about how he feels about our children? I am heartbroken, but I know I had to do this. I couldn’t let our children get treated the way they were on a nearly daily basis, and I also wouldn’t let them see me accepting his treatment and think that’s what their future relationships should look like. I know we’ll be better without him, and it also kills me that it’s true.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe problem is that the majority of our friends and family don’t know how bad it has been and are largely shocked about the divorce, especially his family. My in-laws are asking how I could tear our family apart like this. My (soon-to-be-ex) husband’s version of the story is that I blindsided him with the divorce, giving him no warning or chance to work on our relationship, which just had the usual issues all couples/parents work through. I don’t want to trash-talk him, especially to our kids, as I am a private person and believe behaving respectfully is still right, but he isn’t making the same decision. I am afraid of what will get said to/in front of my kids and that they will think of me as the reason we don’t have our happy little family since that’s how he and his family are presenting it. Can I clear my name/share my side in a respectful way, or do I just need to stay strong and consistent through all this and hope it all cools off a little further out?\n\n—I Didn’t Want This\n\nDear Didn’t Want,\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFirst, I just want to affirm that you did the right thing here. Divorce is painful and the blame you are receiving is unfair, but your relationship and home situation had absolutely become untenable, and your husband’s outbursts, if left unchecked, could potentially endanger your children beyond yelling (which is already bad enough). It’s OK to mourn the family life you’d hoped to have, but I want you to feel assured in your decision to make a better life for you and your kids.\n\nNow, if you’re up to it, you can reach out to your in-laws and share your side of the story; however, it sounds like they are likely to continue taking your estranged husband at his word, so it’s probably not worth your limited energy. As far as other family and friends go, spend some time thinking about what you want them to know about your divorce and share accordingly—you can probably set the facts straight without engaging in unnecessary trash talk. What’s more important is how you discuss the split with your children. It sounds like they are still pretty young, so you’ll basically just going to want to tell them that you and their father were not happy with one another anymore, but that doesn’t impact the love you each have for them.\n\nA final note: If you’re concerned that your husband will mistreat your kids when they’re in his care, you should push for his visits with them to be supervised, and be watchful for any signs of abuse. Don’t let your desire for him to have a relationship with them put them in harm’s way.\n\n—Jamilah",

        "content": "Sign up for the Slatest to get the most insightful analysis, criticism, and advice out there, delivered to your inbox daily.\n\nU.S. District Judge William Alsup delivered a furious rebuke to the Trump administration over its mass purge of civil servants during an extraordinary hearing in San Francisco on Thursday. Alsup condemned the terminations of thousands of probationary workers as a “sham” designed to circumvent the law, accused the Justice Department of filing a bogus declaration, and declared in open court that he felt “misled” by dishonest government lawyers. He closed the hearing with a sweeping order compelling the administration to rehire thousands of workers whom it had unlawfully laid off.\n\nOn this week’s Slate Plus bonus episode of Amicus, Dahlia Lithwick and Mark Joseph Stern discussed Alsup’s extraordinary hearing, and what it signified with respect to the ongoing efforts to rein in lawlessness in federal courts. A preview of their conversation, below, has been edited and condensed for clarity.\n\nDahlia Lithwick: Let’s start with the “will he/won’t he” soap-opera drama here. Judge Alsup summoned Charles Ezell, acting director of the Office of Personnel Management, to show up to testify in federal court on Thursday under threat of sanctions. He did not show up. Mark, you and I have been waiting for meaningful sanctions. Is this the conflict between Trump lackeys and the courts we’ve been waiting for?\n\nMark Joseph Stern: The answer is yes and no. And to explain why, let me expand on the wild background here. Judge Alsup is overseeing this big case that challenges Trump’s mass firings of “probationary” civil servants—people who’ve been in their current positions for less than a year. There’s a mountain of evidence that the Office of Personnel Management directed these firings. There is further evidence that the acting director of OPM, Charles Ezell, was in charge of forcing agencies to lay off tens of thousands of employees. Yet when unions and organizations filed suit—arguing, correctly, that OPM has no authority to mandate layoffs—the government responded with a declaration from Ezell in which he claimed he did not order a single firing. In fact, he insisted that, under his watch, OPM did not order any purges.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat declaration was the only evidence the government put forth that OPM was not directing the mass layoffs. So the plaintiffs told Alsup they wanted to cross-examine Ezell in court because, according to their evidence, he wasn’t telling the truth. Alsup agreed and summoned Ezell to court. But he didn’t show up on Thursday. The big question was: What would the judge do? The good news is that Alsup absolutely chewed out the Justice Department and, by extension, Ezell. He sounded furious. From the bench, he said this: “The government has tried to frustrate the judge’s ability to get at the truth of what happened here and set forth a sham declaration, then withdrew it, then substituted another. That’s not the way it works in the U.S. District Court.”\n\nRelated From Slate What’s the Deal With Amy Coney Barrett Lately? Read More\n\nYet Alsup did not impose sanctions. Instead, the Justice Department voluntarily pulled Ezell’s declaration—which now looks a lot like perjury—and Alsup accepted that. He has now given the plaintiffs permission to depose somebody else, a DOGE guy named Noah Peters, and we’ll see if the government allows that to happen. It is satisfying to hear a judge bring down the hammer like this, but it’s also unfortunate that real sanctions and contempt were not brought to the table.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI think I file this under “Two steps forward, one step back.” Because we have been waiting for judges to evince anger and frustration, and we’re really starting to see that in courtrooms. We’ve seen it from Judge Coughenour, and from Judge Howell on Wednesday. Now we’ve seen it from Judge Alsup. I think the words “sham” and “sham declaration” are really important, and I’d like to read a little more from the judge on Thursday morning. He said from the bench:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou will not bring the people in here to be cross-examined. You’re afraid to do so because you know cross-examination would reveal the truth. This is the U.S. District Court. Whenever you submit declarations, those people should be submitted to the cross-examination, just like the plaintiffs’ side should be. Then we get at the truth. … I tend to doubt that you’re telling me the truth whenever we hear all the evidence eventually. Why can’t you bring your people in to be cross-examined or deposed at their convenience? I said two hours for Mr. Ezell. A deposition at his convenience. And you withdrew his declaration rather than do that? Come on. That’s a sham. It upsets me, I want you to know that. I’ve been practicing in this court for over 50 years and I know how we get at the truth. And you’re not helping me get at the truth. You’re giving me press releases, sham documents. I’m getting mad.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo yes, he’s really mad. And I know a lot of people were hoping he’d issue sanctions. But he’s saying two things that seem important: One, you’re lying to me, and two, we can’t do this jurisprudential project and test the truth if you don’t bring me something that can be verified as truth.\n\nI would also say, in Judge Alsup’s defense, that he then moved on to give the plaintiffs something they wanted even more than sanctions, which is a decision in their favor. At the end of the hearing, he ordered the government to rehire thousands of probationary employees that it had unlawfully fired at six major federal agencies. He ruled that the government was lying when it claimed to lay off all these workers based on their performance. And he said it was “a sad day when our government would fire some good employee and say it was based on performance when they know good and well that’s a lie.” That order means that, at least for now, the government is obligated to rehire many of these people who were wrongly laid off and falsely accused of underperformance.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThen—and this is technical but really important—Judge Alsup said that he was going to revisit a decision he had made earlier in this litigation, in which he told the union plaintiffs that they couldn’t get relief from his court because they had to channel their grievances through specific federal agencies: the Office of Special Counsel, the Merit Systems Protection Board, and the Federal Labor Relations Authority. That decision had limited his jurisdiction over the case. But on Thursday, he noted that Trump has kneecapped all of those agencies and illegally fired their leaders. Trump fired Hampton Dellinger, the special counsel, and he removed leaders of the MSPB and the FLRA. Courts have ordered those individuals to be put back in place at the MSPB and FLRA, but their orders are tied up on appeal.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo the reality is that, as Alsup put it, the channel that Congress created for workers’ grievances “has been ruined.” He ordered more briefing on this topic, but I think it’s pretty clear that he’s going to say these employees don’t have to futilely take their claims to an agency that has been totally paralyzed by Trump. Instead, he will consider their claims. And that will put the plaintiffs on stronger grounds for standing and harm and a broader remedy. It’s also important because it would really strike a blow against the catch-22 in which the Trump administration has tried to trap the civil servants and unions. The administration illegally laid off all of these workers, then simultaneously made it impossible for them to object to their illegal terminations by hobbling the agencies that were designed to protect them. Judge Alsup sees this more clearly than any other judge to consider the issue; he said he was “misled” by the government about the “efficacy” of these agencies. He knows there’s funny business going on here and he has reached the limit of his tolerance for it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt is a change from what we saw in the first couple weeks of this administration. Alsup is willing to move outside the claims the Justice Department keeps making to say, “I know why you fired the probationary employees. I know this wasn’t done on a case-by-case basis on their merits.” And by the same token, it matters that he’s saying “I will not give up jurisdiction if all the entities that might otherwise have jurisdiction have been hobbled.” I think that shows a willingness to live with one foot in the real world and one foot on the bench. I know we might have liked to see real consequences for shoddy lawyering and big lying, but I think it’s consequential that Judge Alsup is now willing to say: “I see what you’re doing here, and I’m not going to play along.”",

        "content": "Netflix is often full of crap. Netflix is also where I just watched Adolescence, a new four-episode miniseries that, in addition to topping the streamer’s charts, is some of the best television of the year. This British import, written by Jack Thorne and Stephen Graham, is about a crime: A 13-year-old boy, Jamie Miller, has been accused of stabbing a classmate to death. Each episode is a one-shot—done in a single take, in an immersive style that feels alternately hectic and unbearably intimate. Each episode bites at the question “How did Jamie get here?” from a different angle. But the show’s only nominally about an investigation into the means, motive, and execution of the crime in question—at its core, Adolescence is about a whole lot more than that.\n\nTV about the internet’s effects on kids can be hard to pull off, and this show runs the risk of looking like “issue television,” something that’s only for people who already care about what children are doing online. But these four episodes have more to say than almost any recent work of television about the making of the modern self—the way our personalities and offline histories tangle up with online life, making it harder and harder to understand people’s motivations and actions. Because it has unflinching regard for the impossibility of this conundrum, Adolescence inflicts a mood of subtle devastation that’s very difficult to shake, even long after you’ve finished watching the series.\n\nEpisode 1 starts in a way that consumers of crime fiction would find familiar. The camera follows the officers who go into the Miller family home and arrest Jamie the morning after the crime. They drive him to the station, book him, get him a solicitor, take his DNA, and inform him of the evidence against him. His family—his weathered plumber father, Eddie, played by the excellent, gruff Graham; stay-at-home mum, Manda (Christine Tremarco); and older sister, Lisa (Amélie Pease)—seems straightforwardly supportive, nothing but stunned by the accusations. Jamie, played with terrifying efficacy by the total newcomer Owen Cooper, cries in the van on the way to the station, asking over and over for his dad as the camera focuses on the back of his head, where dark brown hair curls on his tender young neck. You feel like there must be some mistake—but Detective Inspector Bascombe (Ashley Walters), who put together the case, and who’s the point-of-view character for much of the episode, seems quite competent, and he’s sure he has the right kid. You see at the end of the episode that he has good reason.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDI Bascombe, with his partner Detective Sergeant Frank (Faye Marsay), are our guides in the second episode, set a few days later and located entirely in Jamie’s school, where they go to ask kids questions about the relationship between the victim and the accused. The school is a crowded, raucous place, full of agitation produced by the recent news of the death of a schoolmate. The halls are overstuffed with fighting, yelling kids in uniform and teachers who do nothing but press play on videos and scream at students for using their phones. Because DI Bascombe also has a kid in this school—a bullied kid, who often tries to fake sickness to get out of attending—and it’s the detective’s broad shoulders that the camera is following down the dingy halls, you really sop up the intensifying unease. (Where, you see him wondering, am I sending my kid?) No teacher, and neither of the cops, can connect with any student in this school. It’s a building seething with failure.\n\nThe problem at the school could be shorthandedly identified as being “about the internet”: The teachers don’t understand the kids’ online lives; the kids scorn the teachers as being totally out of it. When the concept of the manosphere comes up between the cops, after DI Bascombe’s son helps him interpret some emojis that the victim used in a comment on one of Jamie’s Instagram posts, DS Frank says, “Sure, I’ve heard of that … Andrew Tate?”—the exact kind of reaction a concerned older person who looks in on this world from the outside might have. But the kids have gotten things so tangled up, deploying these concepts to hurt one another with utmost cruelty, that the adults have no hope of parsing it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe third episode—the series standout, and one you’re going to want to set aside time to watch without any distraction, from start to finish—confines itself mostly to one room in a detention facility, where a young psychologist (Erin Doherty) interviews Jamie so she can write a pretrial report. Cooper, in a display of acting sophisticated for someone so young, ratchets between sweet youthful cheer, anger, confusion, and back to anger. As Jamie describes what happened between him and the victim online, he drops in lines that sounds like @-replies on a toxic Twitter thread—describing a leaked nude of the victim’s chest shared with every boy in the class, he cruelly calls her “a bit flat—not my type,” before going on to explain that he tried to ask her out, given that she had been socially reduced by the experience and he thought she might feel vulnerable enough to say yes. “I thought you said she wasn’t your type?” the psychologist, keeping a perfect poker face, gently asks.\n\nThe hardest stretch of this conversation comes when Jamie tries to get the psychologist to say whether or not she thinks he’s handsome, attempting to crack into her professional facade. Is he doing this honestly, to connect with her, to understand her as a person? Or is this more manosphere stuff—is he talking this way because he picked up the idea that men and women can be assigned values based on their attractiveness, and those values will determine all of their future interactions? The havoc this eugenic idea has wreaked in his life, we can see, is infinite. But Adolescence doesn’t let you off the hook. During a break from the conversation, the camera follows the psychologist into the booth of a security guard, where she politely answers his overeager, borderline flirtatious questions while looking at footage of Jamie. By showing us the mismatch between this beautiful young professional and the homelier, pockmarked security guard, who tells her he hates his job, Adolescence asks: Is Jamie right, though? Is the world really just cruel?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRelated From Slate What if the Manson Murders Weren’t What We Thought? Read More\n\nIn the final episode, the series returns to the Miller family, who we haven’t seen on screen since the first installment. On the father’s 50th birthday, the family, now reduced to three, makes plans for a small celebration. But the father’s van has been vandalized by local kids, and they go to a hardware store to buy solvent to remove the paint. On the way there, with the camera positioned at the top of the windshield capturing the trio sitting across the front of the van, they try for normalcy, with the parents telling a tag-team story about how they first started dating when they were about Jamie’s age. Even that memory is bittersweet, as we silently realize that the ordinary humiliations of the parents’ youth—Eddie slipping and falling in front of everyone at a school dance—resulted only in good memories, not simmering resentments. The question hangs in the air: Why did the parents pass through this portal, while Jamie got stuck?\n\nThe fragile good mood gets ripped apart when the family arrives at the store and encounters a worker who confides in the father that he recognizes him. “I’m on your son’s side … I’ve seen the pictures of her, so you’ve got my support … You should crowdfund for a lawyer, there’s a lot of us,” the guy confides, as the two stand in a quiet aisle. Eddie slowly descends into barely concealed fury and panic, a mood Stephen Graham is an expert at conveying. Here, too, the questions pile up: Was it Eddie’s latent anger that, in turn, made Jamie so angry? Was it Eddie, who tried to make his art-loving son over into an athlete, who “did this”? Was it Manda, who let Jamie disappear into his bedroom after school and stay up late, doing who-knows-what on the computer that still looms in the corner of his bedroom, where we finish the series with Eddie on the twin bed, weeping for his absent son?\n\nThe great strength of Adolescence is that there is no one answer. Fear porn about kids’ online socialization is not the entirety of this show—Adolescence is far from just some TV adaptation of The Anxious Generation, though parents may certainly emerge from a watch newly determined to strip their children of all access to the internet. Adolescence is about the fracturing of society, and the way that kids transitioning between childhood and adulthood see it for what it is—and make up their own stories to explain it, for better or for worse.",

        "content": "Dear Prudence is Slate’s advice column. Delia Cai is filling in as Prudie for Jenée Desmond-Harris while she’s on parental leave. Submit questions here.\n\nDear Prudence,\n\nMy wife “Angie” has created a difficult situation with our neighbors by blowing what I think is something trivial completely out of proportion. Last month, our daughter and her family needed to stay at our place for a week while their furnace and duct work were undergoing replacement. They have young children and could not remain in the house without heat. My wife and I have an parrot, “Ray,” and our grandson is allergic to birds. Luckily, our neighbors “John” and “Sally” were kind enough to take Ray for the duration of the time my daughter and her family needed to stay with us.\n\nThe week passed uneventfully, and John dropped Ray off back home as soon as my daughter and her family left. I returned from getting the mail later that day to find my wife on the phone screaming at Sally and accusing her and John of “corrupting” Ray. I quickly took the phone away from her, apologized, hung up, and asked what was going on. Angie said that Ray was making what she described as “sex noises” and that John and Sally must have taught them to him. After about 10 minutes, Ray let loose with a string of what sounded like a man and a woman crying out while having intercourse. I called Sally back and told her what I had heard from the parrot and asked her if she had any idea where he might have learned it. Sally was greatly embarrassed and asked if she could come over to explain what had happened.\n\nSally told us that she and John had kept Ray in their bedroom with the door closed the entire time they had him because they have two cats and wanted to make sure he stayed safe. She said there were several nights when she and John had been intimate. Sally apologized profusely and said she and John would have held off had they known Ray might mimic the noise from their activities. I told her that it was OK and joked that we would “wash his beak out with soap,” but Angie angrily told her to leave our house and never come back. Sally hurried out; I managed to catch up to her outside. I apologized for my wife’s behavior and told her to give her some time to cool off.\n\nSince then I looked up some information on re-training parrots on the internet and learned not to give a reaction to negative behaviors and to try and teach new words and give rewards for positive behavior. It’s been working—Ray is making the “bedroom noises” a little less each day. Unfortunately, things are not going so smoothly with Angie. My wife is holding a grudge; she won’t even so much as wave to Sally or John when she sees them in the neighborhood. She says as far as she’s concerned, we’re done with them. Sally and John are very nice people and they did us a tremendous favor at a moment’s notice even if Ray did inadvertently end up learning some inappropriate sounds. I think Angie is being ridiculous and I don’t want to lose their friendship over something so insignificant. Any suggestions on how to get her to relent?\n\n—The Bird Who Heard Too Much\n\nDear Heard Too Much,\n\nYou are handling this debacle reasonably; your wife is not. But I’d encourage you to try to see things from her point of view. Sure, there are certain kinds of pet owners who are extremely sensitive and judgmental about the way their pets are treated by anyone other than themselves. But I could imagine how incensed I would feel, for example, if I dropped my dog off with a boarder and came back to find that he’d picked up a bad habit of humping furniture.\n\nThe fact that your wife used the word “corrupting” to describe Ray’s new habit of mimicking sex noises probably also speaks to your wife’s personal discomfort to know that Ray was in Sally and John’s bedroom when the, uh, audio imprinting happened. If Ray’s role in the family (or with your wife) resembles something of a child-like figure, it’s easy to imagine how upset she would be that her sweet bird was “exposed” to what amounts to normal adult behavior.\n\nI think that, rather than invalidating your wife’s fury over this as “insignificant,” you need to have a talk with her where you invite her to share the full depth of her feelings over this whole episode. Take the level of her anger and shock as an indicator of some deeper nerve that has been touched. It might have to do with her attachment to Ray or even her broader sense of what she considers to be impropriety. Once she has fully aired out her grievances, reaffirm that it is valid for her to feel however she wants about the situation, but share that it’s become difficult for you to watch her take these feelings out on Sally and John. Tell her that her grudge is making you feel uneasy, so much so that it’s starting to affect your marriage. Hopefully, you want to steer the conversation to a place where you can say something along the lines of, “What/who is this really about?”\n\n—Delia\n\nClassic Prudie\n\nI love my girlfriend but she grew up in an upper-class bubble where being poor meant missing the yearly family vacation.

        "content": "Dear Prudence is Slate’s advice column. Submit questions here.\n\nDear Prudence,\n\nI have this co-worker, “Vanessa,” who’s always had a weirdly competitive attitude towards me. I have no idea why, unless she resents that I’m at least as skilled and valued an employee as she is, despite not being skinny or “hot.” Our company’s summer picnic was our first in-person family party since pre-COVID, and Vanessa met my husband for the first time. Since then, she has not shut up about how cute he is and the things she’d like to do to him. I suspect this is partly if not solely to screw with me, since my husband does not seem like Vanessa’s usual type. I would go to HR, except our HR manager is a close friend of Vanessa’s, so I’m afraid that might impact me worse than her.\n\nVanessa and her long-term boyfriend are in an open relationship, a fact she is extremely candid about. She wants me to tell my husband that she’d like to have a threesome with him and one of her hot, younger girlfriends. She swears this would just be a one-time thing and completely consensual and aboveboard. If I won’t tell him, she wants me to give her his cell number so she can get in touch with him herself. She keeps repeating that if I won’t at least let her put the offer to him, it means I don’t trust him and my marriage is a sham.\n\nPrudie, my husband and I have been married 13 years, we have three kids under 10, we love each other to death, we’re monogamous and have always been faithful … but I can’t be 1000 percent sure he’d say no to a one-time threesome with two gorgeous women if I left it completely up to him. Is there any merit at all to Vanessa’s assertions that this means we’re better off divorced? What should I do?\n\n— Trouble Trusting This\n\nDear Trouble Trusting,\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf Vanessa in fact resents you for doing your job while not being skinny and wants to mess with you as a result, well 1) that’s disgusting, and 2) she’s unfortunately succeeded. The fact that you’re even considering this absolutely unhinged bully’s view of your marriage is evidence that this situation is way out of control, and you need a reset.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFirst step: Put a stop to this. Here’s your script. “Vanessa, I’ve been entertaining your comments for too long. I want you to know that what you’ve said about having sex with husband makes me uncomfortable and is totally inappropriate for work. Please limit your conversations with me to professional matters and don’t mention my relationship or my personal life again.” If you truly don’t trust HR, I’ll take your word for it. But document your exchange with her just in case you do need to get someone else involved in the future. Because this feels a lot like it’s getting into sexual harassment territory, and if it doesn’t stop, you may need to take more aggressive action.\n\nNext step: Get a hold of yourself. You have allowed her to walk all over you and make you question your marriage, despite knowing, on some level, that her motivation is to harm you. You need to speak to someone who has your best interest in mind—whether it’s a close friend, your husband, or a therapist—to reassure yourself that a random, disturbed work frenemy doesn’t have any standing to determine the fate of your marriage.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDear Prudence,\n\nI am attending a wedding with a formal dress code. I don’t know the bride very well, none of us do. The groom is a longtime friend of my husband and our circle of friends. We are happy to attend, but the dress code makes me nervous. I have never attended a formal event before and I bought a dress for the occasion. Now, I’m scared to be overdressed. I don’t feel close enough to the bride to ask her advice and besides, it is too late now.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI have to admit the dress is gorgeous. Navy blue with a champagne jupon. Age appropriate (I’m 45), discreet accessories, sober shoes. Thing is: Is this what she meant by formal or did I go a bit too far? To me, it feels like I’m dressed for the red carpet or a ball at Versailles. On the other hand, my husband is one of the groomsmen, and I know how much he had to pay for his suit. I felt a pressure to match the price range. I may have taken that as a guide for my own shopping. Was I wrong? Is it better to be underdressed or overdressed at such an event?\n\n— Overdressed in Montreal\n\nDear Overdressed,\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGoogle “formal wedding guest dresses” and see if yours looks reasonably similar to the images that pop up. I’m sure it will. Also, even if it’s a little too formal: Not a big deal. (Too white? Potentially a problem. Too revealing? Maybe something guests will whisper about. But the worst thing people are going to think about you being “too formal” for a formal wedding is “Wow she looks really nice … I wonder when they’re going to cut the cake.” Yes, as I’ve mentioned before, I’m convinced most wedding guests spend significant energy anticipating the cake.) While I don’t think matching the price range is necessarily the right way to think about this, it is better to be overdressed than to be underdressed. It shows you care.\n\nThat said, it sounds like you’re super anxious about how you’ll look. If you go through the Googling exercise and you still don’t feel comfortable, don’t wear the gorgeous gown. Not because you shouldn’t, but because you’ll be all preoccupied, taking stock of everyone else’s clothes and trying to figure out if anyone is wearing a jupon (full disclosure: I had to look up “jupon”) as ornate as yours, or if you’re the only one who looks like you’re going to a ball at Versailles when you’re supposed to be listening to your husband’s groomsman speech and small-talking about how beautiful the bride looks. This will ruin the evening for you.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut can I weigh in on a larger issue, too? Men are allowed to communicate about weddings. Your husband is close friends with the groom. You know the “Hey, is this the look you were thinking of when you set the formal dress code?” text you might have sent if you were close to the bride? He could have fired that off to his friend, who is one of the two people in charge of the vision for this event. And you could have had a quick, clear answer. In fact, you still could!\n\nHow to Get Advice From Prudie\n\nSubmit your questions anonymously here. (Questions may be edited for publication.) Join the live chat every Monday at noon (and submit your comments) here.\n\nDear Prudence,\n\nThe time has come for us to submit photos to our senior yearbook. Our friend group has pretty bad luck with taking photos, and we have very few good ones. I was scrolling through and I found the needle in the haystack photo: all of us are included, it’s fairly recent, and we all look pretty good. I sent it to the group chat, and everyone loves it and wants to use it except for “Gemma.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGemma is not letting us use it because of a relatively minor concern with how she looks in it (think being a bit bloated after a meal). I understand that we all have our insecurities and am against using the photo if she is this uncomfortable, but I really don’t know what other options I have. I truly wouldn’t even suggest the photo if I thought it was unflattering to anyone, and everyone in our group is saying over and over again how great she looks in it. All the ones she suggests don’t include everyone, and I don’t want to exclude someone else from the photo because Gemma is being a bit difficult.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe’ve tried reasoning with her (she looks great, the photo will be super tiny on the page, we can dim it) but she is firmly against it. I don’t want to put a picture in without her as that would feel a bit shady (we are really close), and I don’t have enough space for two. The deadline is nearing, and I don’t know if I should bother talking to her or if I’m really in the wrong here. What should I do?\n\n— Not Smiling for the Cameras\n\nDear Not Smiling,\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGemma is going to look back at this picture years from now and realize she looked fantastic and have a major moment of regret around not appreciating it at the time. She’s going to wish it was both in the yearbook and on a large billboard. But there’s nothing you can do to get her to see that now. Find a different picture—or better yet, make a collage that combines photos that everyone in the group loves. And put this one in a frame in your bedroom.\n\nMeanwhile, remember that while end-of-high-school traditions can feel hugely consequential, you have already made the memories that are going to stay with you forever. And whether your friendships survive and thrive into adulthood will depend on the energy you put into staying connected when you all go your separate ways. In other words, worry less about how you’re all pictured together and more about how you really are together. That could start with honoring Gemma’s wishes now, even if you think she’s being unreasonable. You have my permission to tell her “I told you so” at your 20-year reunion, when I’m sure she’ll happily allow you to submit the shot to the slideshow.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDear Prudence,\n\nA close childhood friend of mine, “Anna,” has been struggling with infertility. We both married our spouses in early 2019, and they began trying for a baby on their honeymoon. My husband and I held off due to the pandemic and started trying after we’d received our COVID-19 jabs. We were fortunate to get pregnant right away. Unfortunately, Anna has had the opposite experience and has since tried multiple rounds of IVF. I have tried to keep my pregnancy updates, details about our baby boy, and talk about becoming a mum as infrequent as possible. I purposely don’t bring up my son as often as I would with other friends in order to be sensitive to her feelings. She claims she’s happy for me, but it’s hard for her to hear about my pregnancy and newborn, which I understand.\n\nBefore I had my son, she was forthcoming about her infertility struggles, and I provided a shoulder to lean on and ear to listen whenever she wanted to talk. I checked in on how she was doing regularly, and have continued to do so, but ever since my son was born she has shut me out. She met him once when he was a few weeks old but shortly after had another unsuccessful round of IVF. I have tried to contact her many times about a funny program or good book I’ve read (any topics far from mum life/pregnancy) and have seemingly been ghosted. If she responds she’s quite short. My heart hurts for her and I really, really miss my friend. There’s nothing I want more than for her to have the pregnancy and motherhood experience she so desires. But I’m at a loss as to how to proceed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe have had a chat where I told her I wanted to be sensitive to her circumstances and have tried to initiate conversations without bringing up my son or how much my life has changed. It’s been difficult, as I was diagnosed with postnatal depression, which I felt I was unable to confide in her as I would never want to cause her any additional hurt or pain. I have since opened up to her about my diagnosis and mental health, but it was a difficult conversation. Throughout my pregnancy I felt overwhelming guilt and anxiety at having gotten pregnant so quickly and even more so now that my son is nearly four months old. Aside from a birth announcement, I have avoided sharing photos and updates of my son on social media, as she has mentioned in the past that pregnancy and baby posts are difficult for her. I’m currently on leave through the end of the year and am therefore unable to facilitate the typical back and forth regarding work, though I’ve made it a point to ask how her recent promotion has been going.\n\nIt’s been nearly a month since we last spoke, and our phone conversation was awkward and stilted at best. She has not responded to my messages since. What can I do to mend our relationship? I’m hesitant to have another “I’m here for you” chat as she has expressed she does not want sympathy and prefers I not ask how she’s faring. Yet my attempts at otherwise innocuous conversation have been met with a brick wall. We have been close since primary school, I consider her to be the sister I never had, and I really don’t want this to end our decades-old friendship.\n\n— New Mum Missing Her Best Friend\n\nDear New Mum,\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen I started reading your question I was like, “Oh good, I have a few ideas here: Check in on her to see how she’s doing. Share that you’re having a difficult time too. Minimize the baby updates. Remind her that you’re there for her. Talk about lighthearted stuff. Ask about other important areas of her life.” And then … it turned out that you’d already tried them all. This is really tough.\n\nSo, I want to suggest a script that gets at all the issues you’ve mentioned about how much you value the relationship, but also puts the ball a little more in her court. “Hi Friend, it’s been a while since we talked. I know you’re doing through so much with infertility and IVF right now, and I’ve been dealing with my own struggles with my mental health. I just want to say I miss you so much, and I don’t want us to drift apart during this hard time. But I also don’t want to put any pressure on you to stay in touch if it’s too difficult. So I’m going to keep checking in with you every once in a while about non-baby stuff, just to let you know I’m thinking about you. If you don’t reply, it’s okay. If that annoys you let me know, otherwise I’ll just keep reminding you that I’m here. And whenever you are feeling like talking about light or heavy topics, or if you need something from me, just reach out and know that we can pick up where we left off the minute you’re ready.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThen, to the extent you can, put this aside. I know it’s hard, but you can’t force her to want to be close right now. And you don’t want your relationship (or lack thereof) with her to dominate this time in your life. Allow her retreat to make room for other people who would love to be close to you and support you during what’s been a really challenging period.\n\nYou’ve spent a lot of time focused on her feelings and struggles, but you also have your own very legitimate ones, and you deserve the same kind of extremely thoughtful support that you’ve been offering up.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDear Prudence Uncensored\n\nHelp! My Oldest Friend Has Shut Me Out Now That I’m a Mom.\n\nJenée Desmond-Harris and friends discuss a letter in this week’s Dear Prudence Uncensored—only for Slate Plus members.\n\nDear Prudence,\n\n“Jane” and I have been friends for almost 20 years, the longest I’ve ever kept a friendship going. We have a number of interests in common, but our core values do tend to be different. I’m a bleeding-heart liberal, pansexual, polyamorous woman; and she’s conservative, traditionally Christian, and straight. I valued her friendship because of these differences, and because we could discuss them respectfully. And because she’s a compassionate person, who can accept people who disagree with her.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOr, so I thought. I recently got an email from her saying that we should part ways as friends because our core values are too far apart. She even gave examples that include some hurtful assumptions on her part—I have no idea what I could have said that makes her think I’m against free speech—as well as some that make me wonder if she ever really knew me. I sent her a reply telling her that I don’t like it but she’s gotta do what she’s gotta do, and that I hope she has a good life. But the more I think about it, the more I want to talk to her about it. This is all complicated by the fact that she suffers from manic-depression, and this coming out of the blue makes me worry that she’s having a meltdown. I have no way of getting in touch with her family or I’d give them a heads-up to check on her and leave it at that. Do I try to contact her to ask if she’s okay? Do I try to have a discussion and salvage a relationship I think is worth saving? Or do I just process the loss and let it go?\n\n— Not Ready to Say Goodbye\n\nDear Say Goodbye,\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWell, you valued her because she could accept people who disagreed with her. But now she can’t. So the best case scenario, if you’re able to salvage this relationship, is that you have a friend who doesn’t actually have the qualities you think she had and who has said she doesn’t respect your values, and that friend may be having a meltdown that you’re powerless to help with. I don’t know that you actually have the option to salvage the relationship, even if you very much wanted to. Let it go.\n\nGive Prudie a Hand in “We’re Prudence”\n\nSometimes even Prudence needs a little help. Every Thursday in this column, we’ll post a question that has her stumped. This week’s tricky situation is below. Join the conversation about it on Twitter with Jenée @jdesmondharris on Thursday, and then look back for the final answer here on Friday.\n\nDear Prudence,\n\nMy partner and I were lucky to find a home in a sleepy neighborhood, with mostly nice and friendly neighbors. We’re not super social people, but we’ve enjoyed getting to know our neighbors, and feel glad to have largely positive friendships with folks close by who can sometimes lend a cup of flour, pick up a piece of mail, or water your plants when you’re out of town for a few days. We are, of course, happy to return these favors and are often asked to house or pet-sit for neighbors who are away.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe problem is one household who we pet-sit for. These are otherwise kind and reasonable people, but it has become clear that they don’t place a lot of value on hygiene in their home or for their animals. Think: bugs in the pet food, dried up feces on the floor, litter pans and food dishes crusted over, open bags of used litter sitting around, stacks of papers falling, and more. We’re asked to pet-sit more than a dozen times a year, and this problem is escalating to the point where it’s upsetting to see and smell their animals living in such conditions. It seems like the health of the animals is declining as well. Sometimes we’re asked to pet-sit for weeks at a time!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat can be done in this situation so we don’t ruin the relationship with these neighbors? We don’t mind the occasional pet-sitting, but this has become uncomfortable and troubling given the frequency with which we’re asked to help out. If it’s rude to comment on other people’s parenting, it’s probably rude to say something about how they keep their home and animals–right? What’s a socially acceptable way to move forward here, knowing we’re going to get another spur of the moment text to pet-sit soon?\n\n— Smelly House, Why Aren’t They Cleaning You?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDear Prudence,\n\nI am a man in my mid-twenties. Over the years I have joined a spiritual community in which we are able to ask someone to be our spiritual mentor. My mentor and I have had a close relationship over many years and developed a friendship as a result. One thing I have always struggled with was my body image. While I was only slightly overweight in middle school, I was constantly made fun of for being fat. This created much anxiety in me. Friends and family would make fun of my weight in public, monitor my food intake, and tell me how what I would eat would make me gain weight. Despite getting into weight training and losing the weight, these comments continued well into my twenties. As a result, I began to develop an unhealthy relationship with food and exercise where I would over-exercise to the point of injury, and have incredible anxiety over having a cookie. I would not go out to eat at restaurants, and I would obsess over how much I ate or how I looked. Last year, I realized how much control this had had over my life and truly began to change my relationship with food. I saw that my view of my body was distorted, especially as I was in very good shape and had weighed the same since high school (165-170 lbs.). Where before eating a piece of bread would cause me to emotionally spiral, I now enjoy all types of food and now go by moderation as opposed to rigid diets. I feel much happier as a result as well because I love food! I still get the occasional comment of being fat by strangers, which I attribute to their own issues now. I feel that I made a lot of progress!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMy mentor had been instrumental in helping me with my distorted issues around my body and I was incredibly thankful. Until recently, that is: I was over at his house when his partner asked me a question about pizza. When I enthusiastically shared with him a recommendation, my mentor called out that if I kept eating pizza I was going to get fat when I am older especially because I was short (I’m 5’9”). I was dumbstruck. I said that my eating habits work for me, and I feel as if I have it under control. He began to argue with me. I could feel myself getting angry, and I said that we could agree to disagree about my eating habits and I quickly left. A couple of days later I called him and said that I felt hurt by his comment as this was an issue I still was working through. He got upset with me and said I was overreacting to an offhand comment he had made and that I obviously have not recovered in this area of my life. Afterwards, he said we could not hang out together since I am too sensitive to offhand comments. I ended up ending the mentor relationship later over some of his bigoted viewpoints, however I am still haunted. Was I overreacting to this entire situation? How can I even tell?\n\n— A Weighty Issue\n\nDear Weighty Issue,\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI don’t know what one has to do to become a “spiritual mentor,” but I can’t imagine that “making your mentee feel worse” and “being cruel in response to totally reasonable feedback” are part of the job. In fact, I’m pretty sure these things should be disqualifying. And he has other bigoted views, too?? Uh, no, you didn’t overreact.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis guy was a fraud and a bad person. It sounds like you’ve done amazing work to overcome the abuse you endured around food and your body. The way you stood up for yourself is a testament to that. Keep doing what you’re doing, and take what you need from this spiritual community while remembering that the other people in it are only human and shouldn’t be listened to over your own instincts and hard-won wisdom.\n\nClassic Prudie\n\nMy grandmother once had a diamond necklace that was a family heirloom. My grandfather, who didn’t know how to keep things in his pants, ended up giving it to one of his mistresses. My grandmother mourned the loss of the necklace until the day she died.

        "source": "https://slate.com/",
        "content": "Sign up for the Slatest to get the most insightful analysis, criticism, and advice out there, delivered to your inbox daily.\n\nLast week, Reddit administrator Worstnerd shared a significant update to the social network’s content-moderation standards. As of March 5, “users who … upvote several pieces of content banned for violating our policies will begin to receive a warning.” They added that the company will “consider adding additional actions down the road.”\n\nOn its face, the move is perplexing. Why would a website that ostensibly prides itself on giving its users and communities a platform for free speech choose to punish the same users and communities for simply voting on content? The answer comes down to the onetime Reddit user, alleged CEO killer, and quasi–folk hero known as Luigi Mangione.\n\nUp- and downvotes, as Worstnerd noted, are the key engine of the Reddit infosystem. The public gauge of approvals and disapprovals afforded to a given post or comment determines its visibility within its home subreddit, its prominence across the website at large, and the poster’s reputation within the user base. This serves as both a form of community moderation and a popularity contest, the means by which humble Redditors may earn wider attention or find themselves buried. It’s imperfect, like any moderation forum, but as a longtime fixture of the Reddit ecosystem, it’s something that’s recognized and (mostly) functional.\n\nBut there’s another important reason why the voting infrastructure has held as durably as it has: Although Redditors understand the power their votes have, they’d never had to worry about whether their votes would lead to their accounts being disciplined by Reddit. They never had to fear that clicking an arrow in one direction or the other could lead to top-down digital persecution—especially when it came to discussion of fraught and frequently policed topics, like the shooting of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYet that’s how the implications of this new voting policy became unavoidable. On Friday, just two days after Worstnerd’s announcement, a moderator for the r/popculture community—which has existed since 2008—announced that the subreddit had been “closed.” They further noted that one of their fellow moderators “was suspended for approving comments that mentioned” just Luigi, not even his full name.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“Apparently saying ‘luigi’ is now against the rules too even though they never told us. All comments with the word ‘luigi’ get flagged as possible inciting violence,” the r/popculture moderator wrote. They linked to a screenshot that purportedly showed the suspended user getting flagged by a moderation bot for a comment that featured a YouTube link to the 1950s Louis Prima track “Luigi.” (The vintage big-band anthem has seen something of a social media revival as a frequent accompaniment for edited videos of Mangione.) R/popculture continues to feature new posts on a limited basis, having been “restricted” from wider view by Reddit for the time being, and its primary photo is now a reimagining of Mangione as a Jesus-like figure.\n\nA company spokesperson then told the Verge that there’s no “sitewide filter for the word ‘Luigi’ or expectation that users stop talking about Luigi Mangione.” That didn’t seem to assure the broader community. The initial announcement, which had been flooded with skeptical comments, was cross-posted to dozens of other subreddits, occasionally with captions like “Literally 1984” and “Extremely bad news from our admin overlords.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat same moderator shared a PSA in r/FreeLuigi (“a community to discuss healthcare reform and … keep up to date on the case”) that “the word ‘luigi’ is now flagged by reddit for violence.” They included a screenshot in which a user’s question about whether the community could still discuss the video game Luigi’s Mansion 3 had been flagged by the violence-moderation bot for mentioning the name Luigi.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n(After publication, a Reddit spokesperson wrote to Slate that “one of the mods of r/popculture was suspended for approving a large number (at least 20) of comments containing direct calls for violence, including images celebrating Thomas Matthew Crooks and content calling to assassinate the president.” They added that “because r/popculture only had one remaining mod, we added Automod filters” to help filter reported posts and to flag “certain keywords”: “This action is specific to this one subreddit, temporary, and the mod can still approve the flagged content if it isn’t violating. This was done because there was only one mod and a high volume of content.”)\n\nI spoke to one of r/FreeLuigi’s moderators shortly after this PSA had been shared. “I remember r/LuigiMangione got banned, then r/LuigiMangione2, then r/LuigiMangione3, and I think it went up to r/LuigiMangione6 before people were like, ‘We’re not going to keep doing this,’ ” she told me in a phone conversation. “I’d made one called r/LuigiFever, which was just photos of him, and that got banned too.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe r/FreeLuigi moderator wanted to make clear that she and the large majority of her 36,000-strong community are not condoning violence against health insurance CEOs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“The main goal of the subreddit is to maintain the presumption of innocence—the subreddit, the media, and the general public does not have the right to determine if he’s guilty,” she said. “No one in r/FreeLuigi wants anyone to get murdered, and no one is celebrating that a man died. There are obviously some crazy people on the internet who are. But an entire community of 30,000 people shouldn’t be punished for one person’s actions.”\n\nShe added that her own subreddit was taking extra moderation precautions, including using bots to monitor any troll activity, restricting mentions of Mangione to his mere initials, and forbidding the use of the phrase “Deny, Defend, Depose”—the words that were inscribed on the bullets used to kill Thompson. It’s all part of the effort to, as she put it, preserve r/FreeLuigi’s position as the “last safe space.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe r/FreeLuigi moderator also pointed to another factor that she and many other Redditors believe led to this change on the website: Elon Musk. President Donald Trump’s extremely online lackey has aimed plenty of ire at Reddit from his perch at DOGE, first attacking the federal workers he’s been firing en masse for discussing the chaos on r/FedNews, then expanding his purview from there.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI spoke with the moderation team for r/PublicFreakout, who told me: “It started with r/comics.” In late January, a cartoonist was permanently banned from the comics subreddit for “Nazi apologia,” after posting a comment dismissing the idea that Musk had made a Nazi salute at the inauguration (a gesture that, notably, had inspired a wide swath of moderators to block X links from their subreddits). Musk found that cartoonist’s tweet and called his ban “insane,” inspiring his followers to assail r/comics.\n\nSome of the moderators of that subreddit also happened to help moderate r/WhitePeopleTwitter. So, while they were distracted by the comics brouhaha, an X account called “Reddit Lies” shared screenshots from r/WhitePeopleTwitter discussing the identities of Musk’s DOGE flunkies. The X owner then baselessly accused the subreddit of having “broken the law.” That led Reddit higher-ups to ban r/WhitePeopleTwitter for 72 hours, due to “a prevalence of violent content.” The community returned with some restrictions applied; cheekily, it now refers to itself in its bio as “White People Twitter BlueSky.” (Naturally, its members continue to heavily criticize Musk.)\n\nThere was yet another factor that members of the r/PublicFreakout team told me affected them personally. About a month ago, the right-wing technocentric outlet Pirate Wires—founded by an executive at Peter Thiel’s Founders Fund—published an “investigation” accusing a “terrorist” network (read: pro-Palestinian users) of “astroturfing” its agenda within various popular subreddits, including r/PublicFreakout. After Musk boosted the article and brought it even more attention, Reddit’s Worstnerd announced that, although the company had “not identified widespread terrorist content on Reddit,” it was launching a formal investigation into Pirate Wires’ allegations.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter a couple of weeks, Worstnerd announced that they hadn’t found evidence of widespread manipulation or content sourced from “terrorist organizations.” While they did uncover “four pieces of terrorist propaganda” from a previously banned account, it was nothing remotely close to what the Pirate Wires article had claimed.\n\nStill, Worstnerd noted that Reddit was implementing extra moderation actions, such as “expanding our vote manipulation monitoring to detect smaller-scale manipulation attempts.” From what various Reddit moderators told me, it likely wasn’t a coincidence that the platform’s announcement in regard to vote-policing was posted the very next day.\n\n“It’s a lot to deal with back to back to back,” the r/PublicFreakout moderators wrote to me. “This change not only puts pressure on users to correct their behavior—it makes users afraid to engage with voting. It puts pressure on mods to remove content before anyone sees it so that the user base isn’t punished.” The r/popculture moderator recently disclosed that they were “getting a lot of people reporting anything that mentions Luigi as inciting violence.”\n\nRelated From Slate Why the CEO Shooter Makes the Perfect American Folk Hero Read More\n\nTo the moderators of r/SecularTalk—a community for fans of the popular progressive commentator Kyle Kulinski—the fact that this change came after a controversy involving pro-Palestinian users clearly sent the message that “they want to warn and then ban people for upvoting Luigi or anything pro Palestine.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“We know all of us are at risk of being banned or having the sub taken away at any time. We would rather that outcome than to censor anti-genocide posts or censor anti-Elon or anti-DOGE posts,” the r/SecularTalk mods wrote to me. Still, that hasn’t stopped their subreddit and user base—which is smaller than either r/PublicFreakout’s or r/FreeLuigi’s—from tangling with the new reality.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe mods said they had one instance when a user’s comment that simply read “agreed” was removed by Reddit. The mods manually approved it multiple times only to see it taken down by Reddit until the account was “suspended or banned.” They claimed, sharing screenshots with me, that the site is removing posts and comments and not putting them in the queue for mods to see, forcing them to manually snuff out instances of unfair retaliation. The r/seculartalk team also pointed out other examples of public discussions and topics that had run afoul of Reddit’s “community safety” filters in recent times, including H-1B visas (a favorite topic of Musk’s), health care, and even political town halls.\n\nThere are a lot of theories as to why Reddit is taking such a hard approach—but nothing clear. The r/FreeLuigi mod suggested that this was to placate advertisers, since Reddit is now suffused with customized ads whose vendors would prefer not to be seen as endorsing contentious topics. The revamp also may have resulted from the fact that Reddit went public in 2024, which led to the C-suite implementing controversial, much-protested changes in order to make actual money and get a nice stock value for its initial public offering. (Reddit’s share value is currently about 40 percent lower than what it was just a month ago.) The r/PublicFreakout team suggested that because of this public scrutiny, from both shareholders and government-linked figures like Musk, “Reddit is under serious pressure to get its userbase under control” and imposing whatever haphazard measures it can to accomplish this.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut Reddit’s moves might come back to bite the network. Its most fervent users are clearly angry with Elon Musk and with a social media ecosystem that’s already been happy to suppress frank discussions of identity, race, gender, and class warfare under the censorious mandates of the Trump administration. Redditors continue to post anti-Elon and pro-Luigi content despite being removed and “filtered.” Users have threatened to leave the platform en masse before, but they might actually do so now that the most basic and fundamental mechanism of the website (i.e., voting) could lead to them being punished. It’s almost as if Reddit wants to drive away the very people who made it the front page of the internet in the first place.",

Submit it here!\n\nDear Care and Feeding,\n\nWe are currently getting our daughter registered for next year’s pre-K program, which has to be completed by the end of this month and is a binding commitment. It involves choosing between full- or half-day (morning or afternoon) options and selecting whether or not to participate in district-provided transportation. My mother-in-law wants very much to provide care for my daughter around pre-K and has let us know that she thinks the best option is for our daughter to attend either of the half-day programs, with her picking up/dropping off and watching her for the remainder of the day. My husband and I had been seriously considering this, because she’s great with our daughter and we know she would enjoy this arrangement; our daughter would too.\n\nHowever, my mother-in-law has just been diagnosed with cancer. She is in the testing stage to determine details and treatment plans. Nevertheless, she continued to urge us to accept the half-day program and decline transportation.\n\nBoth our kids (we also have a younger son) are currently in full-time day care, although my mother-in-law had offered to watch them full-time when I went back to work. We felt that having both kids all day was significantly more than she could reasonably handle. But the idea of her taking on half-day care of our daughter alone seemed like a good one—a perfect way for us to give her more contact with one kid at a time. Since the cancer diagnosis, though, I don’t think making a plan that hinges on her being available and feeling well enough for multiple hours every day is wise, since we don’t have a reliable backup and my husband and I both work jobs with limited flexibility. I think we need to schedule our daughter for the full-day session and use the district’s transport, which would pick her up just before my husband needs to leave for work, and bring her home just after I get home from work. My husband agrees, but he had been hesitant to have this conversation with his mom, as he knew it would hurt her, and she is already so stressed by her diagnosis and all the unknown factors it entails.\n\nWe have now talked with her and my father-in-law and, as expected, she was very upset. She told us how much she had been looking forward to the extra time with our daughter (then our son the following year, assuming we would make the same arrangement once he was in pre-K) and emphasized that we don’t know how she’d feel or be doing next year—telling us she might well be fine by then. She also expressed worry about our daughter being at school for the full day (we don’t share these worries; we have no doubt she is ready for that). We agreed that the future is unknown, but reminded her that we need to make a binding decision by the end of this month, so we have to work with the information available now and in the next few weeks. We assured her that we would arrange for her to see the kids both together and separately regularly (as we already do) and would absolutely consider this arrangement for our son the following year, depending on the circumstances when the time for that decision comes. She ultimately agreed that it was the right choice, but was definitely distressed.\n\nMy FIL stayed quiet through the discussion, but later that night, he called us and berated us, saying that we had just let them know that we were sure my MIL was going to die. He said we should be ashamed of ourselves for taking away something that was giving her so much to look forward to and reminded us that patient attitude plays a factor in treatment outcomes, basically saying that if she doesn’t have a positive outcome from the cancer treatments, it will be our fault for suggesting she might not be well enough to carry out this childcare plan. My husband was great. While I sat in stunned silence, he calmly told his father that this diagnosis is scary for everyone, but he doesn’t get to take his stress over the situation out on us. He told him that we were making the best decision we could in a crummy situation. My FIL hung up on us. My husband sat with me on the couch and cried, saying that he knew that was exactly how this would go.\n\nWe know we are making the best decision we can, but is there something more/different we can do with my in-laws to help them process it?\n\n—Too Much Unknown\n\nDear Unknown,\n\nI think you’re doing the best you can. I suspect your mother-in-law sees this—or will—and that your father-in-law behaved as he did because anxiety, fear, and dread can make people behave in awful ways. I understand where your husband was coming from when he responded as he did (and no doubt there is a long history between them that played out at this heightened emotional juncture too), but perhaps he could be a little gentler with his father. He might acknowledge that his father is so understandably distraught he said some hurtful things he’s sure he didn’t mean. He might even apologize for the “you don’t get to take it out on us”—which was not your husband’s best moment—but aside from that (if he can bring himself to do that; I hope he can), I don’t believe there is much that can be done right now.\n\nHis parents are in for a long, hard ride. They’re both going to need a lot of support. You’re doing the right thing for your family (I would have done the same); now it’s time to move on from that discussion. It’s done. Where your in-laws are concerned, concentrate on being loving and supportive and on making an (even greater than usual) effort to bring your children and their grandmother together. If the childcare arrangements come up again, all you need to say is, “As you know, that’s all settled now,” then change the subject.\n\n—Michelle\n\nMore Advice From Slate\n\nOur married daughter’s in-laws are, sadly, pretty immature people. The week of these kids’ wedding, my wife was forced into playing therapist to convince them of the importance of attending their son’s outdoor wedding (fear of COVID nearly kept them away!). This was hugely stressful for my wife. In the three years since then, we’ve been amazed by their self-pitying comments and guilt-inducing remarks directed at their adult sons and daughters-in-law.",

        "source": "https://slate.com/",
        "content": "Democrats were cornered this week. After House Republicans banded together to pass a bill funding the government through September, Senate Democrats faced a choice. They could put up enough votes to break a filibuster and allow the bill to pass, or they could filibuster it, likely sending the government into a shutdown. This strictly 9-to-5 newsletter was sent to the printer before the final vote was cast. But Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer had announced Thursday that he would vote to break a filibuster, signaling that enough Democrats would cave with him to keep the government open. The amount of flak Schumer has taken since his announcement—and not just from progressive Democrats—has been breathtaking. But we’ll use this space to defend his choice (before, like the slimy turncoats we are, criticizing it in the next entry). We’ve believed from the get-go that this leverage point wasn’t much of one at all. The obvious play for Republicans was to put a clean-ish extension of funding up for a vote and dare Democrats to filibuster it. Despite what a poll here or there may say now, Republicans would have a strong hand in the ensuing blame game: Democrats shut down the government by blocking the funding bill. If Democrats found themselves getting the blame, then their exit strategy from a losing position could get grisly. To reopen the government, Democrats would have to cave for less than they’re being offered now. And Trump and Elon Musk might decide that they’re not interested in reopening the government for a while—really, that they’re quite happy slashing nonessential functions and personnel in the absence of congressional action. We’d note that Chuck Schumer doesn’t like being called a traitor by every left-of-center person. He's touchy about it. He has to have a substantial reason to light himself aflame like this. Could it be that he’s absorbing the heat for a lot of Senate Democrats, many of whom are voting the other way but privately agree that blocking the bill would prove to be a critical strategic mistake?",

        "content": "Sign up for the Slatest to get the most insightful analysis, criticism, and advice out there, delivered to your inbox daily.\n\nIn the seven years since Donald Trump Jr. and Vanessa Trump ended their marriage, Don Jr.’s love life has never strayed far from the spotlight. For most of that time, he was engaged to former Fox News personality and current ambassador to Greece, Kimberly Guilfoyle, whom he only recently parted with in somewhat scandalous fashion. (In lieu of any breakup announcement, Jr. simply went out and about with a new woman, socialite Bettina Anderson, leaving Guilfoyle looking jilted and raising questions about how and why she scored that ambassadorship.) Meanwhile, no one heard much of anything about Vanessa—until Thursday, when it emerged that she is now dating Tiger Woods.\n\nYes, that Tiger Woods, who is having a busy week, having also just announced that he is recovering from surgery to repair a ruptured Achilles tendon, while, meanwhile, Barack and Michelle Obama are looking to make a biopic about him. Time for a third-act rewrite to add in Vanessa! The Daily Mail reported that the two have been dating since Thanksgiving. It’s unclear exactly how they met, but Vanessa, who is 47, has close ties to the golf world in the form of her and Don Jr.’s oldest daughter, 17-year-old Kai, who is an accomplished golfer. According to Page Six, Kai attends the same school as Woods’ two teenage children. Woods, 49, has also known President Donald Trump for years; just last month, the two played golf together and Woods was separately honored at a White House Black History Month event. (I guess DEI is OK if Trump can find a way to make it about golf.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile it is tempting to think that Don Jr. might feel somewhat insecure to know that his ex has moved on with one of the most famous athletes in the world, the only thing we know about Don Jr.’s reaction to this news is that an “insider” told People that he is “cool” with it. He’s usually really level-headed, so that seems right. He and Vanessa were married for 12 years and share five children together; their marriage was plagued by rumors of infidelity and financial tensions. During their divorce, tabloids reported that Vanessa had been “emboldened” to file after inheriting a small fortune thanks to her father’s investment in Rao’s Specialty Foods, which brought her what People called at the time a “marinara-sauce windfall.” (As if we needed further confirmation that Don Jr. is sauceless.) The two have been mostly cordial since the split, with Vanessa attending President Donald Trump’s second inauguration earlier this year alongside Don Jr.’s new squeeze Anderson, who is reportedly a former friend of hers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThough it’s been a while, you may recall that, in addition to being considered one of the greatest golfers of all time, Tiger Woods is also one of the most notorious cheaters of all time. The revelation of his affairs during his marriage to Swedish model Elin Nordegren, who is the mother of Woods’ two children, was huge news in 2009. His romantic life has calmed down somewhat since then—though there was also a spat with an ex-girlfriend over a nondisclosure agreement a couple years ago—but you can see how his history might give some women, er, pause before entering into a new relationship with him. Before Don Jr., by the way, Vanessa was linked to an accused member of the Latin Kings gang, a Saudi prince, and Leonardo DiCaprio. So maybe the concept of red flags is just lost on her.\n\nUltimately, what are we to make of this pairing? Can we count it as a win that it’s probably giving Don Jr. a conniption, or is it too depressing that another public figure has become further entrenched in Trumpworld? To be honest, it’s probably a little bit of both. A sick part of me, of course, is wondering how Trump himself feels about this news. It takes a lot for me to be at all interested in golf, so kudos to everyone involved for that.",

        "content": "How to Do It is Slate’s sex advice column. Have a question? Send it to Jessica and Rich here. It’s anonymous!\n\nDear How to Do It,\n\nMy best friend “Megan” recently attended a sex party. Not long afterward, she called to tell me she was “pretty sure” my husband “Dave” is cheating on me. Except, the story she told me is so insane and unbelievable that I don’t know what think.\n\nWhen I asked her what would make her think he was cheating, she said that the invitation to the party requested all the women arrive ahead of the men for the purpose of a game called “Who’s Who.” When she got there, the hosts had the women assemble in the living room where a sheet with a hole cut in it was hung to completely cover the living room doorway. Then when the men arrived, they took turns putting their dicks through the hole in the sheet and the women tried to guess who each man was before the party began. Megan said my husband’s name came up three times!\n\nDave and I do not have an open marriage, nor do we attend those kinds of events, so there is no other conclusion to draw other than my husband must be cheating on me. How do I go about confronting him with this revelation?\n\n—Game Over\n\nDear Game Over,\n\nI don’t know what kind of party this was, but from your question, it seems like both first and last names came up during the guessing segment. That is extremely indiscreet for a sex party, but if there’s any ambiguity at all, your first step should be checking with Megan to make sure it was indeed your husband Dave who was identified (there are a lot of people named “Dave.”)\n\nI have to tell you that this scenario is, at minimum, unconventional. I’ve never heard of this game, I’m not sure how or why it’s played (is the gag that the partygoers have seen these dicks before, but not generally in their flaccid state, so that’s the challenge?). Could Megan have information that she’s not sharing with you? Could it be that she knows Dave is cheating on you but has changed key (or perhaps all) the details in the story to protect herself? It’s all confusing.\n\nI’m going to recommend getting more information out of Megan. Can she describe any of the dicks attributed to Dave? Maybe there’s more to tease out of this that will help clear things up. Can Megan put you in touch with someone else who was there and may have a different perspective/better means of articulating the scenario? It’s really tough to present someone with a story this convoluted as evidence of wrongdoing.\n\nIf and when (emphasis on the if) you are sure sure, I think the best and most direct way to go about doing this is to tell him what you heard. Instead of introducing it as ironclad proof that he’s cheating on you, set up the scenario much as you did in this letter: Your friend (whether you want to identify Megan or not is your call) went to a sex party, and Dave’s name was mentioned several times as a possible attendee. Ask him why and listen to his answer. It might help to, ahead of confronting him, think about how he might explain himself out of the situation or even possible scenarios in which he isn’t cheating. I can’t think of any, but maybe you can.\n\nThe idea is to be prepared and not accept bullshit, but also not to get so wrapped up in Megan’s story that you can’t receive Dave’s. He might have a verifiable alibi! If he doesn’t, there’s some chance he’ll confess when presented with the evidence. If the conversation gets too heated to continue but you are unconvinced of an explanation he’s trotted out, let him know that you don’t believe him and that you’ll pick this conversation up later. It’s astounding to consider that your partner would be so brazen as to cheat on you at sex parties that are close enough to your circle (in proximity and social overlap) that your best friend would also be in this scene, but some people really are that brazen. I worry that if he’s willing to do that, he’ll also lie right to your face and never come clean. You can’t make someone tell you the truth, but you can let him know that you don’t believe his lies. Now is the time to consider what this, if true, will mean for your relationship and your own future.\n\n—Rich\n\nMore Advice From Slate\n\nThe other day, I was looking for my cat under my son’s bed and I found a number of really strange “things.” Not sex toys, like … unidentified objects next to a bottle of olive oil he’d apparently been using for lube.

It’s anonymous!\n\nDear Good Job,\n\nI am a teacher. Several very racist teachers work in my school. Last year, two white teachers used the N-word while speaking with students, another teacher had the N-word written on their door during Black History Month (purposefully). We have a history teacher who thinks (and has said to students!) that Black people need to “get over” slavery. We have Trump supporters who hang signs about the importance of borders in their classrooms. My administration will do nothing about this. They coddle the racists and keep their heads down.\n\nMost of our students are Black and Latino. I myself am a Black educator and have fielded so many complaints and feelings of genuine horror or confusion from students who are hearing racist, dehumanizing, and horrible things from their teachers who are supposed to care for them. I am disgusted by these colleagues. However, they are my co-workers and I have a leadership position at my job. Some of the worst offenders drop by often to chat with me about their concerns (it is my job to deal with them); we see each other daily.\n\nI don’t know how to deal with these people. I dislike them intensely, but I fake collegiality to make it through the day. This makes me feel like a hypocrite and a fraud. Why should I be nice to people who I think are harming children? Am I compromising my own morals to “fit in” and make my life easier? If this were not at work, I’d be banging pots and pans and telling them exactly how I feel. I want to show up for my students and be honest, but I know that the fallout will be intense, and that my racist co-workers would be confused by a seemingly sudden attitude shift. I also understand that in life, my students will meet people who are racist, xenophobic, homophobic, etc. and that I can’t prevent that from happening … but these are their teachers and they are young and impressionable. How can I stand up for what I believe in, manage my professional relationships at work, and support my kids?\n\n—Yes, That’s Racist\n\nDear Yes,\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI’m so sorry you and your students are stuck in a school system that tolerates and empowers racists. Thank you for listening to the students who come to you and affirming that they are right to be confused and horrified. Your encouragement now could echo throughout their adulthoods—research shows that having just one caring adult in their lives can help a child thrive even in a dysfunctional environment.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe fact that your school employs at least three racist teachers and doesn’t act decisively when another teacher experiences racist vandalism shows that the problem is at a scale that requires action. That action doesn’t necessarily have to come from you, or not just from you alone, but you and other people in your school community do have some options.\n\nRegardless of how you decide to proceed, the first step is documentation. Whether you witness discrimination yourself or hear about it from a student or another teacher, write an account of what you know and share it with your human resources department. Depending on how they respond, you may choose to escalate by sharing the information with your principal. You could bring the issue to your union. You could complain to the school board. You could encourage students or their parents to document what they’ve experienced and speak out to administrators and school board members as well. At each step, clearly detail the discrimination, even if you’re not the victim and it’s second-hand, and keep copies for yourself.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEmployers are required by federal civil rights laws to protect employees from racial harassment. Any teachers who have been subject to harassment could file a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. (While the EEOC has been in the news lately for being undermined by the Trump administration, you are still protected by federal law.) The EEOC doesn’t cover students, but Title VI of the Civil Rights Act protects anyone at institutions that receive federal funding, which most schools do. “Schools have an obligation to protect students from harassment,” said Jake Knanishu, an attorney with Radford Scott LLP, an employment law firm in Atlanta.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou would have additional legal protections in some states, such as California and New York. But regardless of what state you live in, federal civil rights laws protect teachers from retaliation for reporting discrimination, which the National Education Association explains in more detail here. “She is going to be protected as long as she has a reasonable, good-faith belief that what she is opposing is illegal,” Knanishu said, based on a synopsis of your letter. “And obviously with such blatant and virulent harassment, she would have a reasonable basis.”\n\nAnother option is to share what you know with local journalists or with reporters at national newspapers who cover education. You can ask to speak with them on condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNone of this is easy, and it shouldn’t be on you to protect your colleagues and your students from racism. You mentioned that you have a leadership role in the school, so you might consider using your position to build alliances with like-minded teachers and pressure the racist ones to suppress their bigotry. Talk to the non-racist teachers about how you collectively could take on the racist-coddling administration. The racism at your school may get more blatant now that bigots feel even more politically empowered. This is a good time to build networks of people you can trust.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSend Your Questions to Good Job!\n\nLaura Helmuth and Doree Shafrir want to help you navigate your social dynamics at work.

My husband works at a partner company in the same industry but in a different field, and when someone says my boss’s name, they speak poorly of her.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI can’t disagree with their complaints, but I get on with her just fine. I get on with most people just fine, even those who I know talk about me behind my back. (I’m a stickler for the rules, and don’t really care if these people are my friends. I only care if they are disrespectful to my face. My work speaks for itself and we’re a highly regulated industry where any paperwork misstep can cost a whole department their bonuses for multiple years.) But I would like to minimize the shit-talking—of everyone!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt’s fine to say, “This is Jake and Rob’s project so brace yourself for last-minute changes” because that’s reality. It’s the nature of their accounts. Complaining about the existence of these accounts is blowing off steam and not personal, and my assistants have been very helpful in identifying pain points and compliance issues. But, “Deb is really on a tear today, isn’t she?” just seems gossipy in a way that I don’t want to participate in—even when Deb is totally on a tear.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIdeas for shutting down negative commentary in a professional way? I don’t want to seem like I’m disagreeing (I’m not) but I also want to be pretty neutral. After all, this person is treating me and my assistants very well and is in charge of our raises and bonuses. But she is angering everyone around me in a way that it might be beneficial to obliquely acknowledge if I want to move up in my career. Help!\n\n—If You Can’t Say Anything Nice, Leave Me Out of It\n\nDear Nice,\n\nCongratulations on maintaining a successful working relationship with your difficult boss. That can’t be easy. I hope when your boss, Deb, goes on a tear, she doesn’t direct it at you. But witnessing her tear into other people must be unpleasant, even for the most level-headed and agreeable person.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe colleagues who gossip about her trust you enough to know they can speak to you safely. That’s a compliment, in its own weird and unwanted way. To these colleagues, try a short reply that doesn’t prolong the conversation. A shrug or eye-roll would do it, or a quick, “She gets stuff done” or “I wish I could help.” Then shift the conversation to something else entirely. Ask about the weather, what they’ve been cooking, or if they’ve been reading any good books lately.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe colleagues who speak behind your back are a different problem. They may well be irritated by anyone who goes by the rules. Or they may think of you as Difficult Deb’s sidekick and assume you agree with her way of doing business. It’s fine to ignore them, as you’re doing. If you want to improve your relationships with them, you can ask whoever told you what these colleagues said about you (I’m assuming you didn’t overhear it) to let the gossipers know they can come to you directly. Or you can tell them yourself that you hear they have some concerns. Say you understand that working here can have its challenges (with an optional eye-roll or raised eyebrows to acknowledge the unspoken off-putting-ness), but that you and your assistants have a good record of easing pain points when you learn about them. Tell these colleagues you are open to discussing any problems at work so you can solve them together.\n\nSlate Plus members get more Good Job every week.

Why does one expensive t-shirt count as business casual and another, cheaper one doesn’t when the only difference is fabric, which isn’t even visually obvious? Why do you have to pretend to want a job for anything other than a paycheck? Why does it matter whether or not I have tattoos, piercings, or dyed hair? How do I navigate the work world when every time someone says the word “professional” I want to scream about how discriminatory against women, POC, queer, poor, and disabled people these arbitrary rules are? Just say “level-headed” or “courteous” because nine times out of ten, one or both of those seem to cover what people actually want to say when they say “professional”! And that last one out of ten is always “follows these arbitrary rules that do nothing to actually improve a workplace.”\n\n—Professional Is a Bigot’s Complaint\n\nDear Don’t-Say-Professional,\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou are absolutely right. “Professional” is one of those coded words that reinforces bigotry and discrimination. Professionalism is also central to the notion of “cultural fit.” A ton of research has been conducted using identical resumes aside from clues to an applicant’s race, gender, age, or class. Researchers send these resumes out to companies and then analyze which resumes get interview requests. The results overwhelmingly show pervasive biases. Some companies have the gall to excuse their preference for an applicant who was in, say, the sailing club rather than track and field by saying the former is a better cultural fit. It’s another example of how bias harms the bigots, because Ms. Relay Team had to work much harder and smarter than Mr. Yacht Rock to achieve the same resume, and that kind of determination would make her a great hire.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnyway, what can we do about it? There are some legal remedies. Twenty-four states have passed the CROWN Act, which prohibits discrimination based on hair style, because some employers claimed that afros or dreadlocks are “unprofessional.” But we can also, collectively, challenge cultural expectations. You can support your colleagues who don’t look, dress, act, or speak like the dominant group. They’re more likely to be spoken over or ignored in meetings, so praise and amplify their ideas: “Brad, if I could interrupt you for a second, Janelle made a great point and I’d like to hear more.” You could push the boundaries yourself in how you interpret your workplace’s dress code or unspoken rules about appearance. You could ask your human resources department to provide anti-bias training (which isn’t enough, but can be a start). If you hear someone using the word “professional,” ask them if they know the term has historically been used to exclude people. They might not know—people are lousy at recognizing biases—and good people appreciate the chance to learn.\n\n—Laura\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nClassic Prudie\n\nI have a friend, “Anne,” that I’ve known since sixth grade. We were amazing friends for many years, and then I moved away. Our relationship has gone from close to less- close over the years. It got worse after she got married and had a child. I do not consider someone a close friend if they only text me every couple of months and only see me a few times a year. She has no idea what’s going on in my life anymore and vice versa. I know she considers me to still be a close friend, though, because she’s mentioned being fine with the infrequent contact and has recently talked about being a bridesmaid in a hypothetical wedding I might have had with my ex. Well, my ex and I had a terrible break up. I had saved up a ton of vacation days and so I planned a huge trip…",

Submit it here!\n\nDear Care and Feeding,\n\nMy husband’s brother, “Kirk,” and his wife are coming over for their first visit with our six-month-old son next month. The thing is, the thought of him holding my baby fills me with dread.\n\nKirk is an absolute klutz. I expressed my concerns to my husband, but his response was that I was exaggerating. He thinks everything will be fine. When I reminded him of the time our 4-year-old niece slipped out of Kirk’s grip once when he tried to pick her up (thankfully she was less than two feet off the floor when she fell), he dismissed it as a “fluke.” I’m worried to the point that I’m considering faking an illness when it gets close to the time they will be coming to get them to cancel their visit. What’s the answer?\n\n—Scared in SoCal\n\nDear Scared,\n\nYeah, I’ve gotta say, faking illness to get out of this feels kind of excessive. First of all, clumsy people (hi) also have kids and manage to care for and raise them to adulthood. Second, there’s no rule saying Uncle Kirk has to hold the baby just because he’ll be there for a visit. But you could also just ask Kirk to sit down on the couch before you hand the baby over. (Use extra pillows for support if it makes you feel better!) Even if your son managed to wriggle out of Kirk’s grasp, it would be a super short distance and a soft landing for him. If he starts crying or needs to be changed or fed or walked around the house, you or your husband can take over.\n\nYou might be fixated on Kirk’s clumsiness due to some deeper anxiety about not being able to always protect your child—if so, I get it. The world is terrifying and full of peril, etc. But by now, you have probably realized that it just isn’t possible to avoid every risk or control for every possible variable at all times. You can be as vigilant as you want; your relatives and friends and other caregivers can be as careful as they want—parenting will still find new and surprising ways to alarm you. Take a deep breath and try to remind yourself that your son is safe and well. You’ve been taking great care of him for six months now. You’re always going to worry for him—he’s your child! That’s not something you can turn off—but he’s going to face tougher things than a klutzy uncle, and he is also going to be okay.\n\nMore Advice From Slate\n\nI’m a full-on adult who can’t seem to handle arguments. From major disagreements with loved ones to mild, low-stakes debates online, I just feel awful when I get into it with someone. My heart races, my jaw clenches, I can’t think about anything else, I make counterarguments in my head endlessly, and I generally feel like garbage.",
