This is kind reciprocal,\" he said.\n\nTrump held up a chart with a list of nations and what the new U.S. tariffs against them will be. At the top was China, which Trump said was set to be hit with a 34% tariff rate as he claimed it charged the United States 67%. (The new 34% tariff would be on top of a 20% U.S. tariff on China already in effect -- bringing the total tariff to 54%, according to Trump's senior counselor for trade Peter Navarro.)\n\nPresident Donald Trump speaks during an event to announce new tariffs in the Rose Garden at the White House, April 2, 2025, in Washington, D.C. Mark Schiefelbein/AP\n\nThe 10% baseline tariff rate goes into effect on April 5, according to senior White House officials. The \"kind reciprocal\" tariffs go into effect April 9 at 12:01 a.m., officials said, and will affect roughly 60 countries.\n\nThe \"reciprocal\" tariffs are based not just on what was listed on the chart but also on alleged currency manipulation and trade barriers.\n\nTrump described trade deficits as a \"national emergency\" and that his actions will usher in what he called \"the golden age of America.\"\n\n\"In short, chronic trade deficits are no longer merely an economic problem. They're a national emergency that threatens our security and our very way of life. It's a very great threat to our country,\" he said.\n\nWednesday's tariff announcement is a moment months in the making for the president, but one that comes with significant political and economic risk.\n\nSome experts warn his moves could cause the economy to slide into a recession and markets seesawed ahead of Wednesday's announcement, after weeks of turmoil as Trump's tariff policy shifted and took shape.\n\nThe White House had been mum on details ahead of Wednesday's event. One senior administration official said the situation was \"still very fluid\" after meetings on Wednesday morning and that Trump and his top advisers were trying to find some common ground where they agreed.\n\nSome options debated in recent weeks, ABC News Senior White House Correspondent Selina Wang reported, were a 20% flat tariff rate on all imports; different tariff levels for each country based on their levies on U.S. products; or tariffs on about 15% of countries with the largest trade imbalances with the U.S.\n\nPresident Donald Trump signs an executive order on tariffs, in the Rose Garden at the White House in Washington, D.C., April 2, 2025. Leah Millis/Reuters\n\nWednesday's tariffs build onto levies already imposed by the administration, including on steel and aluminum as well as certain goods from China, Canada and Mexico.\n\nThe actions have strained relations with Canada and Mexico, two key allies and neighbors. Prime Minister Mark Carney said last week the U.S. and Canada's deep relationship on economic, security and military issues was effectively over.\n\nCanada has vowed retaliatory tariffs and Mexico said it will give its response later this week. The European Union, too, said it has a \"strong plan to retaliate.\"\n\nBut Trump and administration officials are plowing full steam ahead, arguing America's been unfairly \"ripped off\" by other nations for years and it's time for reciprocity.\n\n\"For decades, our country has been looted, pillaged, raped and plundered by nations near and far, both friend and foe alike,\" Trump said on Wednesday.\n\nPresident Donald Trump speaks during a trade announcement event in the Rose Garden at the White House, on April 2, 2025, in Washington, D.C. Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n\nPresident Donald Trump speaks on the day of his remarks on tariffs in the Rose Garden at the White House in Washington, D.C., April 2, 2025. Carlos Barria/Reuters\n\nThe chart he held up had one column showing what it called tariffs imposed by what Trump suggested were the top five offending countries next to a second column with what it said were the U.S. \"discounted reciprocal tariffs\" against them.\n\nThey include:\n\nChina at 67% compared with 34%\n\n\n\nThe European Union at 39% compared with 20%\n\n\n\nVietnam at 90% compared with 46%\n\n\n\nTaiwan at 64% compared with 32%\n\n\n\nJapan at 46% compared with 24%\n\nThe list includes a massive 44% tariff on Myanmar, currently reeling from a devastating earthquake, saying that country imposes an 88% tariff on the U.S.\n\nThe economy was the top issue for voters in the 2024 presidential election, with Americans casting blame on President Joe Biden for high prices and Trump promising to bring families financial relief.\n\nThe administration has painted tariffs as a panacea for the economy writ large, arguing any pain experienced in the short term will be offset by what they predict will be major boosts in manufacturing, job growth and government revenue.\n\n\"Jobs and factories will come roaring back into our country, and you see it happening already. We will supercharge our domestic industrial base,\" Trump said. \"We will pry open foreign markets and break down foreign trade barriers. And ultimately, more production at home will mean stronger competition and lower prices for consumers.\"\n\nBut economists say it will be American consumers who bear the brunt of higher costs to start.\n\nIt's unclear how much leeway the public is willing to give Trump to get past what he in the past called \"a little disturbance.\"\n\nAlready, little more than two months into his second term, polls show his handling of the economy is being met with pushback.\n\nAn Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research survey published on Monday found a majority of Americans (58%) disapprove of how Trump has been handling the economy.\n\nOn his protectionist trade negotiations with other nations, specifically, 60% of Americans said they disapproved of his approach so far. It was his weakest issue in the poll among Republicans.\n\nSpeaker of the House Mike Johnson takes questions on tariffs while meeting with reporters at a news conference, at the Capitol, in Washington, April 1, 2025. J. Scott Applewhite/AP\n\nTrump's GOP allies on Capitol Hill have said they're placing trust in the president, but acknowledged there will be some uncertainty to start.\n\n\"It may be rocky in the beginning but I think this will make sense for Americans and it will help all Americans,\" House Speaker Mike Johnson said at his weekly press conference on Tuesday alongside other members of Republican leadership.\n\nDemocrats, meanwhile, pledged to fight the tariffs \"tooth and nail\" and were trying to force a vote aimed at curtailing his authorities to impose levies on Canada.\n\n\"Trump's done a lot of bad things. This is way up there,\" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said earlier on Wednesday.\n\nABC News' Mary Bruce, Katherine Faulders and Fritz Farrow contributed to this report.",

Elizabeth Warren speaks during a news conference with Democratic Senators about protecting Social Security benefits for Americans, at the Capitol, April 1, 2025.\n\nSen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., is launching a \"Save Our Schools\" campaign on Wednesday against President Donald Trump and Education Secretary Linda McMahon's attempt to dismantle the Department of Education.\n\n\"The federal government has invested in our public schools,\" Warren said in an exclusive interview with ABC News. \"Taking that away from our kids so that a handful of billionaires can be even richer is just plain ugly, and I will fight it with everything I've got.\"\n\nWarren suggested she is working with students, teachers, parents and unions to \"sound the alarm\" nationwide.\n\n\"My starting point with this campaign is that I know the power of telling stories and the power it brings to organize people into the fight. We need numbers to win, and this is how we start,\" Warren said.\n\nIn a short video obtained by ABC News that Warren is posting to her roughly 20 million social media followers Wednesday morning, Warren says she is launching an investigation into reported plans to replace Department of Education call centers with chatbots. ABC News has not independently confirmed these reports.\n\nSen.

Jim Watson/AFP via Getty Images\n\nWarren said that through a combination of federal investigations, oversight, storytelling and even lawsuits, she will work with the community, including lawmakers in Congress, to do everything she can to defend public education. Warren did not provide further details on how she plans to challenge the administration through federal oversight and lawsuits.\n\nA former special education teacher, Warren said she opposes the Trump administration's agency overhaul because she said it may result in fired teachers and increased class sizes, adding that programs for students with special needs will \"disappear.\" However, the Trump administration has vowed to keep statutory funding, such as the programs for students with special needs.\n\nTrump said those services for students with disabilities, such as those protected by the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, will be rehomed in other departments, including the Department of Health and Human Services, which is undergoing massive layoffs itself.\n\n\"They think that the American people are stupid [and] will be fooled by slapping a different title on the door and that somehow our kids will get the help that they're entitled to,\" Warren told ABC News.\n\n\"No one is fooled and certainly not the kids who need that help,\" she added.\n\nThe Trump administration has said it is returning education to the states in dismantling the federal department and that students will be better served by their state departments.\n\nThe campaign is also personal for Warren. In the video obtained by ABC News, Warren said she has seen with her own eyes what the Department of Education does for special needs families and that she is doing everything she can to \"fight back.\"\n\nWarren said she was inspired by her second grade teacher to join the education ranks.\n\n\"Whenever someone asked about my future, I would stand a little taller and say: 'I'm going to be a teacher,'\" Warren recalled. \"It guided my entire life.\"\n\nLast month, Trump signed an executive order that aims to gut the Department of Education. It directs McMahon to close the department using all necessary steps permitted under the law. Still, eliminating the department would require an act from Congress because it was created by Congress.\n\nSecretary of Education Linda McMahon stands with President Donald Trump during the signing ceremony for an executive order to shut down the Department of Education in the East Room at the White House in Washington, Mar. 20, 2025. Carlos Barria/Reuters\n\nThe campaign comes in the wake of the department cutting nearly half its workforce last month. Hundreds of employees in the Federal Student Aid Office were let go, which Warren said could have \"dire consequences\" on the tens of millions of student loan borrowers who rely on the department's $1.6 trillion student loan portfolio to achieve higher education. Trump has said student loans will now be handled by the Small Business Administration.\n\n\"The Department of Education (ED) appears to be abandoning the millions of parents, students, and borrowers who rely on a functioning federal student aid system to lower education costs,\" Warren and a group of Democratic senators wrote in a letter urging McMahon to reinstate the fired federal employees.\n\nThe FSA's operations have already been affected, according to a source familiar. The federal student loan website was down briefly less than 24 hours after the agency cuts. Fired IT employees were called frantically to join an hourslong troubleshooting call to restore the website for millions of borrowers, according to the source.\n\nAs part of Warren's campaign launch, the senator said she will also highlight the real-world impact on educators, students and families through a series of story collections. She said she is encouraging community members to share submissions on how public education has influenced their lives and what it means to them. Warren told ABC News she did a similar campaign with federal employees at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau earlier this year.\n\nThe headquarters of the Department of Education are shown Mar. 12, 2025 in Washington. Win McNamee/Getty Images\n\nHowever, Warren's investigations and federal oversight could be hampered by Democrats' position in Washington.\n\n\"Democrats are in the minority in the House and the Senate, and obviously we don't have the White House, but not having as much power as we want does not mean having no power,\" Warren told ABC News. \"We've still got a lot we can do, and this combination of investigations, oversight, storytelling and lawsuits is that we can combine more power and push back hard, and it's already yielded some results.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the administration's quest to abolish the department has already triggered a legal battle by a coalition of states and education and civil rights groups, including ​​a group of teachers unions and public school districts in Warren's home state of Massachusetts.\n\nThe senator said she is hopeful every person who cares about education joins her campaign.\n\n\"We've got to fight for an America where it's not just the kids of billionaires who get a good education but it's every kid in every community who gets a great education,\" she said. \"This fight is our fight.\"",

Instead, the shooter, Audrey Hale, left behind “a series of notebooks, art composition books, and media files created by Hale documenting her planning and preparation for the attack, the events in her life that motivated her to commit the attack, and her hopes regarding the outcome of the attack,” police determined.\n\nThe report says Hale researched other shooting locations, including highly traveled roads and shopping malls. By December 2018, Hale also began planning an attack at a different middle school, the report says.\n\nDuring the March 2023 shooting at the private, Christian school, those killed were Evelyn Dieckhaus, Hallie Scruggs, and William Kinney, all 9 years old, alongside Cynthia Peak, 61; Katherine Koonce, 60; and Mike Hill, 61.",

Nathan Howard/Reuters\n\nA sell-off from Trump, the company's largest individual shareholder, could panic investors and damage the company's stock price.\n\nAs of midday Wednesday, the company's stock price was down about 5%.\n\nTrump Media and Technology Group pushed back on the possibility that Trump may attempt to sell any shares in a statement on Wednesday.\n\n\"Legacy media outlets are spreading a fake story suggesting that a TMTG filing today is paving the way for the Trump trust to sell its shares in TMTG. To be clear, these shares were already registered last June on an S-1 form, and today TMTG submitted a routine filing that re-registers them on an S-3 form in order to keep the Company's filings effective. In fact, there currently is no open window for any affiliate to sell shares,\" the statement said.\n\nThe president also has previously said he plans to hold his stake in the company.\n\n\"I don't want to sell my shares. I don't need money,\" Trump told reporters in September.\n\nThe SEC filing effectively puts investors on notice about millions of shares that could be sold on the open market, finance experts told ABC News.\n\nPresident Donald Trump's social media platform Truth Social is shown on a cell phone on March 25, 2024 in Chicago, Illinois. Scott Olson/Getty Images\n\nThe filing provides updated information about Trump's majority stake in the company and flags the possibility of an additional 8 million shares hitting the open market, according to University of Florida finance professor Jay Ritter, who described the filing as a requirement if the company insiders attempted to sell off their shares.\n\n\"In this offering it says the Trump trust could sell shares -- it doesn't necessarily mean that they will,\" Seth Goldstein, an analyst at research firm Morningstar, told ABC News. \"It signals to the market that they could.\"\n\n\"This leaves it up in the air if and when a share sale will happen,\" Goldstein added.\n\nSome insiders have been able to sell shares at a profit, taking advantage of the company's high stock price.\n\n\"Trump Media has been pretty unsuccessful at creating an operating business model, but they have been quite successful at selling their stock,\" Ritter said.\n\nAccording to Ritter, a sell-off by company insiders like Trump could \"really tank the share price\" by signaling declining confidence in the company's business model.\n\n\"The sale of the Resale Securities being offered pursuant to this prospectus, or the perception that these sales could occur, could result in a significant decline in the public trading price of our Common Stock,\" the filing said.\n\nABC News' Max Zahn contributed to this report.",

Jim Banks, R-Ind., telling a man on Capitol Hill who identified himself as a recently fired Health and Human Services employee that he \"probably deserved it\" because \"you seem like a clown\" has gone viral.\n\nThe man engaged with Banks in the video is identified as Mack Schroeder.\n\nABC has not independently confirmed that Schroeder is a fired federal employee, but Schroeder told CNN on Wednesday he wasn't at the Capitol to \"get his job back\" but wanted to ask lawmakers what they were going to do to ensure residents were \"getting the services that they're entitled to.\"\n\n\"As we cut workers who are really ensuring that grants are going out the door to programs,\" Schroeder said on CNN. He said that he had worked on programs that support people with disabilities and older adults.\n\nSenate Armed Services Committee member Sen. Jim Banks questions retired Air Force Lt. Gen. John Caine during his confirmation hearing to be promoted to general and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, April 1, 2025, in Washington, D.C. Manuel Balce Ceneta/AP\n\n\"So, I was hoping he would have, you know, some sort of plan to say, this is why we're cutting workers. This is how we're going to continue supporting residents in Indiana. But he just responded, as you saw,\" Schroeder said.\n\nSchroeder told USA Today he was among a small group of other fired federal workers protesting on Tuesday when he recorded the interaction with Banks, telling him, \"Hi, I was a worker at HHS. I was fired illegally on February 14. There are many people who are not getting social service programs, especially people with disabilities. Are you going to do anything to stop what's happening?\"\n\nThat's when Banks told Schroeder he probably deserved to be fired.\n\nSchroeder told CNN he was shocked by Banks' sharp reaction.\n\n\"First of all, I didn't ask him what is he doing to help me get reinstated in my position? I wasn't asking, 'Why did I get fired? What are you going to do to make sure me and other employees get their jobs?' I was just asking, 'What are you doing about the social services that are being cut specifically for people with disabilities?'\" Schroeder told CNN.\n\n\"He didn't even answer my question … I still have not heard a response about what the plan is, as many of these staff get cut and the programs are potentially defunded,\" he added.\n\nShortly after Schroeder's appearance, Banks appeared on CNN and referred to Schroeder as an \"instigator\" who is \"in the hallways of the Senate office buildings every day chasing down Republicans like me and cheering for Democrats who walk through the hallways.\"\n\n\"It doesn't take a whole lot here to deduce from that he is a left-wing activist and what I have no tolerance for is anyone who believes they are entitled to a taxpayer-funded job.\"\n\nHe stood by his interaction with Schroeder and said he was glad Trump was eliminating wasteful jobs in the government.\n\n\"I'm not going to shy away or back down or apologize for what I had to say [Tuesday]. This was a calculated instigator activist in the hallways of the Senate and I don't have a lot of tolerance for it.\"\n\nAsked by CNN if he had similar views about every employee who was laid off, Banks said, \"Of course not. My comments were directed at this fellow who, again, can't even explain what he does. It was a woke job that wasted taxpayer dollars and I'm thankful that President Trump eliminated that job to save tax dollars.\"\n\nBanks is fully embracing the blowback he's getting.\n\nFirst, he reposted the video of his exchange on X, in which he's seen calling the man a \"clown,\" adding, \"Hard truth.\"\n\nFormer NFL star wide receiver Antonio Brown dubbed Banks the \"Cracker of the Day,\" and Banks replied, \"Thanks, AB. I'm honored!\"\n\nHe's also changed his profile picture on X to his smiling face through the crack of the elevator door, and another video post where he declares, \"I won't apologize for speaking the truth. I 100% support President Trump and DOGE's mission to cut woke spending and government waste.\"\n\nAnd yet another post on X: \"I have no sympathy for left-wing activists who have been let go from overpaid positions that should never have existed. I do have sympathy for the hardworking Hoosiers whose tax dollars have been wasted on bankrolling these positions.\"",

        "source": "https://abcnews.go.com/",
        "content": "A unanimous Supreme Court on Wednesday backed the Food and Drug Administration's refusal to authorize the sale of kid-friendly flavored e-cigarettes and vapes, including the flavors \"Killer Kustard Blueberry,\" \"Rainbow Road,\" and \"Pineapple Express.\"\n\nJustice Samuel Alito, in his opinion for the court, rejected the manufacturers' claims that the agency had acted arbitrarily and capriciously in violation of federal law by changing the requirements for product approval in the middle of the process.\n\n\"In the end, we cannot say that the FDA improperly changed its position with respect to scientific evidence, comparative efficacy, or device type,\" Alito wrote. He returned the case to a lower court for further review.\n\nThe ruling effectively holds the line on the government's decision to severely limit the number of flavored tobacco products legally available in the U.S. market out of concerns over the impact on children.\n\nKid-friendly flavors, such as fruit, candy, mint, menthol and desserts -- which are largely not approved by the FDA and are currently sold on store shelves illegally -- have been fueling an explosion in retail sales of e-cigarettes.\n\nWhile vaping among youth is declining, more than 1.6 million children use the products, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Nearly 90% of them consume illicit flavored brands.\n\nThe United States Supreme Court in Washington D.C. STOCK PHOTO/Getty Images\n\n\"Today's ruling is a major victory for the health of America's kids and efforts to protect them from the flavored e-cigarettes that have fueled a youth nicotine addiction crisis,\" said Yolanda Richardson, president of the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, an advocacy group. She noted the FDA has denied over 26 million flavored e-cigarette product applications so far.\n\n\"While the FDA has authorized the sale of only 34 e-cigarette products, manufacturers continue to flood the market with thousands of illegal, unauthorized products,\" Richardson said in a statement. \"To end this crisis, the FDA must deny marketing applications for flavored e-cigarettes and step up enforcement efforts to clear the market of illegal products. Today's ruling should spur the FDA to act quickly to do so.\"\n\nAn attorney for the companies -- White Lion Investments LLC, operating at Triton Distribution, and Vapetasia LLC -- said in a statement they view flavored vapes as a safe and valuable alternative for smokers trying to quit.\n\n\"We are obviously disappointed in the outcome. Triton and Vapetasia continue to believe in the great harm reduction potential of their products for cigarette smokers. We look forward to further proceedings before the Fifth Circuit on the prejudicial error issue that the Supreme Court remanded,\" said Eric Heyer, the Thompson Hine partner who argued the case.\n\nSTOCK PHOTO/Getty Images\n\nSince 2009, federal law requires sellers of new nicotine products to provide regulators with scientific evidence to show that the products would promote public health, but the statute does not spell out specifically what evidence is necessary and sufficient. The FDA's guidance on how to meet that requirement was at the center of the case.\n\nWhile the first Trump administration had taken a hard line against the marketing and sale sweet and candy flavored vapes, President Donald Trump said during the campaign that he wants to \"save\" flavored vapes. It's not clear how the FDA, newly under his control, may modify regulations around flavored vapes or alter the approval process.\n\nDespite their loss in the case, vape manufacturers are able to reapply for approval with the FDA in a new application and attempt to show how benefits of the product to public health would outweigh the dangers to teens.\n\n\"In light of the statutory text and the well-documented and serious risks flavored e-cigarette products pose to youth, it should have come as no surprise that applicants would need to submit rigorous scientific evidence showing that the benefits of their products would outweigh those risks,\" Justice Sonia Sotomayor concluded in a short concurring opinion in the case.",

Now, his wife has been charged with his murder.\n\n\"We as a community have been devastated,\" Kelli Edwards, Bonnell's girlfriend, told ABC News. \"How do you comprehend something like this? There's really no comprehension.\"\n\nShe added, \"Whatever's happened to him he didn't deserve -- no one deserves any of that -- but he was just a really beautiful human being.\"\n\nBonnell was in his second semester of physician's assistant school at Methodist University in Fayetteville, North Carolina, and was the president of the cohort, Edwards said.\n\n\"This is a Green Beret who was a patriot to the Corps, who served for our country, who helped his fellow teammates with all their injuries, who deployed on teams, who went all around the world and he comes home and retires in three weeks and this is what happens? This is not okay,\" Edwards said.\n\nShana Cloud in police photo. Cumberland County Sheriff’s Office\n\nEdwards said Bonnell told her he was already going through the process of getting a divorce. Bonnell said he and his wife had been living separately for a couple of years and he had met with divorce attorneys, she said.\n\n\"After trying to make a marriage work for a long time, he decided it was best to cut cords and move on. And so when I met him, he was already at that stage,\" Edwards said.\n\nShe added, \"He was very intelligent, highly intelligent. But I think he really tried to see the best in everybody he was around. You have that personality which is a really great trait to have and sometimes it can be a flaw.\"\n\nPolice said a wellbeing check on Bonnell was called in by an employee at the Methodist University on Jan. 28 after Bonnell did not attend class. When deputies arrived to the home, they spoke to his wife, Shana Cloud, who said she had not seen Bonnell since the day before, according to the Cumberland County Sheriff's office.\n\nBonnell's vehicle, school bag and other items were found in the residence, police said. A second wellbeing check was requested later in the evening by a friend of Bonnell, according to the sheriff's office.\n\nHe was ultimately declared a missing person. Police executed multiple search warrants before human remains were found in a lake on Feb. 25.\n\nKelli Edwards and Clint Bonnell. Courtesy Kelli Edwards\n\nSeveral weeks later, the remains were identified as belonging to Bonnell.\n\nHis wife has now been charged with first degree murder and felony concealing an unnatural death.\n\nCloud, a former traveling nurse who worked for the Virginia Department of Corrections, remains in custody without bond. Her attorney maintains her innocence, according to ABC station WTVD in Durham, North Carolina.\n\n\"Ms. Cloud looks forward to her day in court,\" her defense said.\n\nIn court, prosecutors alleged Cloud was seen on video near the location where Bonnell's remains were found, according to WTVD.\n\n\"Mr. Bonnell told his girlfriend that he had let the defendant know about the divorce and his plans the night before,\" said Cumberland County District Attorney William West in court Monday. \"We believe he was killed the following morning.\"\n\nBonnell was shot multiple times, prosecutors say. A search of the couple's home uncovered bullet holes in his book bag and laptop, according to WTVD.\n\nEdwards said she started noticing some uncomfortable patterns and things happening in Bonnell's life as their relationship got more serious.\n\n\"He didn't really talk much about his wife in the beginning. I just knew more about his daughter, how much he loved his daughter and all the things that you know she'd brought to his life,\" she said.\n\nEdwards said she saw Bonnell the Monday he went missing and said you could tell he had a lot on his mind.\n\n\"The last text was that he was going to bed and good night basically. And that was it. And the next morning I texted an early morning text and there was no delivery,\" she said.\n\nKelli Edwards speaks with ABC News. ABC News\n\nEdwards said she called in a welfare check when she wasn't hearing back from Bonnell the next day.\n\n\"I knew that something was wrong because we were in communication a lot during the day -- mostly text messaging because he was in school -- and I didn't hear from him on the 28th of January,\" Edwards said.\n\nEdwards said she wants people to remember Bonnell as an amazing human who left an impact on many people.\n\n\"He was a very, just a jovial, happy human and he was really looking forward to his next part of his life, closing a chapter, coming out of the Army after 20 years, being in PA school -- he was looking forward to the next chapter,\" Edwards said.\n\nThe Cumberland County Sheriff's Office said, \"Our hearts go out to the Bonnell family, the Special Forces community, and the Methodist University Physician’s Assistant Program during this difficult time.\"\n\nNo additional details will be released in the case \"out of respect\" for Bonnell and the integrity of the investigation, the sheriff's department said.",

Sydney Kamlager-Dove is proposing the Defending American Diplomacy Act, which would prohibit the executive branch from reorganizing the State Department without Congressional consultation and approval.\n\n\"They are gutting foreign assistance, and I'm not going to be complicit in that,\" Kamlager-Dove, who sits on the Foreign Affairs Committee, told ABC News in an exclusive interview ahead of the bill's release Wednesday. \"It is unfortunate that they are crushing USAID -- What that means is American farmers are not going to have contracts that they would normally have to produce crops to sell them to other countries. By crushing foreign assistance, it also means that people in other spaces are going to get sick.\"\n\nProtesters hold signs and sing chants during a protest against Elon Musk and his Tesla car company outside the Tesla dealership in Boston, March 15, 2025.

And if we are going to get rid of those tools in our toolbox because of some dodgy thing called DOGE that is using taxpayer dollars to actually hurt taxpayers, I feel like I have a responsibility to step up and say no.\"\n\nThe bill has consequences for noncompliance built into the legislative text, directing Congress to cut funding for DOGE and even prohibit travel for President Donald Trump's political appointees, including every member of his cabinet, if the administration initiates a reorganization that circumvents Congress.\n\n\"DOGE has been operating in the shadows,\" Kamlager-Dove said. \"So part of the noncompliance elements of the bill is about bringing in a little sunlight so that we have a sense about what is actually going on.\"\n\nWhile the administration has signaled that some eliminated jobs could be potentially absorbed by other federal agencies, the bill also prohibits that from happening without Congressional say-so.\n\nKamlager-Dove explained that her gripe with DOGE \"is not about efficiencies.\"\n\nTesla CEO Elon Musk wears a 'Trump Was Right About Everything!' hat while attending a cabinet meeting at the White House, in Washington, Mar. 24, 2025. Carlos Barria/Reuters\n\n\"It is about unlawfully accessing our systems and our codes and stealing taxpayer dollars and doing things in the shadows,\" the representative said.\n\n\"The American people deserve to know what is happening, and if what DOGE is doing is so great, then I would think they would be more than willing to come to Congress and share with us and the American people all that they are doing,\" she added. \"But the reality is they are not willing to share that information.\"\n\nWith narrow Republican majorities in both chambers and a Trump White House -- there is virtually no chance the bill becomes law in this session of Congress. But at a minimum, it gives Democrats who are powerless on the legislative front another messaging tool to campaign alongside their hopes to seize congressional majorities.\n\nStill, Kamlager-Dove argues the measure is more than a messaging bill.\n\nU.S. Rep.

If it does come up for a vote, then they would have to put their cards on the table,\" Kamlager-Dove said. \"They would have to say, I recognize that Congress is being complicit in self-neutering itself and yielding all of its power to Donald Trump.\"\n\nDespite the long odds, Kamlager-Dove maintains optimism that her bill won't be lost among thousands of other bills as Democrats toil in the minority.\n\n\"My hope is that having this bill, having other bills like this, talking about these issues in committee, will rattle their brains and clear out the hypnotic fog that they're in,\" she said. \"If you continue to beat the drum, you do make headway, and that's what this bill is about: Beating the drum.\"",

Mike Waltz and Matt Gaetz heated up in recent weeks.\n\nBoth lawmakers resigned to join the Trump administration, although Gaetz withdrew his nomination as attorney general when it became clear that he did not have sufficient support in the Senate to be confirmed.\n\nRep.

The GOP would hold onto its majority no matter what the results of the Florida elections, but if they lost a seat, that will make legislating more difficult, especially on measures where every Republican doesn't vote with the party.\n\nWhile Republicans will hold on to their majority regardless of the results in Florida, the election comes amid concerns over maintaining that power -- a concern that spilled into the public when President Donald Trump recently asked Rep. Elise Stefanik to withdraw from her nomination as U.S. ambassador to the United Nations rather than give up her seat.\n\nTrump endorsed both Republican candidates and campaigned for them by phone, although he had also expressed concerns on Monday that one of the races would be \"a little bit close.\"\n\nHe touted the power of his endorsement in a post on his Truth Social platform, writing, \"BOTH FLORIDA HOUSE SEATS HAVE BEEN WON, BIG, BY THE REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE. THE TRUMP ENDORSEMENT, AS ALWAYS, PROVED FAR GREATER THAN THE DEMOCRATS FORCES OF EVIL. CONGRATULATIONS TO AMERICA!!!\"\n\nThe 6th District race was in play more than expected, with uncertainty among some Republicans over whether Fine could keep the seat in GOP hands, given that he lagged far behind Democrat Josh Weil in fundraising.\n\nFine had about 57% of the vote while Weil had 43%. Waltz won the district in 2024 by just over 30 percentage points and Trump carried it by 30 points.\n\nAnd while the race in the 1st District was not forecast to be competitive, the initial vote count showed it closer than expected.\n\nPatronis had 57% of the vote, while Democratic candidate Gay Valimont had 42%. Gaetz won over Valimont by 32 percentage points in 2024, and Trump carried it by almost 40 points.\n\nFine pushed back against insinuations that he had underperformed in his race.\n\n“I won, last time I looked, by 14 points. So I think it’s hard to say that’s an underperformance by any stretch ... I won by 14 points. That’s not an underperformance.”\n\nSpecial elections usually have lower turnout than on-cycle elections and turnout and results can be tough to predict.\n\nOn the fundraising front, according to filings with the Federal Election Commission, Fine has raised or received around $987,000 from late November 2024 through mid-March, while Weil has raised or received more than $9 million since Oct. 1, 2024 through mid-March. Fine also donated $600,000 to himself, according to later filings.\n\nRep. Randy Fine answers a question about his House Bill 3-C: Independent Special Districts in the House of Representatives April 20, 2022, at the Capitol in Tallahassee, Fla. Phil Sears/AP\n\nWeil's campaign has spent more than $8 million of what he's raised, per the filings; Fine's campaign had also spent much of its cash on hand before his donations to himself.\n\nBut Fine does have Trump's strong endorsement.\n\nTrump said on Thursday of Fine: \"He will be there whenever I need him, and he wants to be there whenever we need him. He wants to be there for you.\"\n\nFine has expressed confidence. He told ABC News Live anchor Diane Macedo on Monday, \"We're doing great,\" and later added, \"What we're seeing is angry Democrats, and Republicans having to understand what's at stake.\"\n\nWeil, who was endorsed by Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., on Friday, told ABC News Live Prime anchor Linsey Davis on Monday night, \"People want someone who will fight for them in Washington and that's what we're offering.\"\n\nHe said that Sanders' endorsement, which Fine had criticized, seemed to be an asset when talking to voters who appreciated the senator's message.\n\nJosh Weil, a schoolteacher and Democratic candidate for Florida's 6th Congressional District seat in the U.S. House of Representatives, speaks at a town hall event in Ocala, Fla., March 26, 2025.

And now he wants to keep on fighting for Florida in Congress, and he's going to do that, and he'll vote to defend Social Security, protect Medicare, all these things ... under great danger with the Democrats.\"\n\nPatronis, speaking after Trump, told listeners, \"Look, if you're not fired up to hearing the president right now, then you need to get your pulse checked with President Trump and the White House.

This came after police released the audio from the 911 call in which a woman reported an alleged assault and a shooting at the home and urged the public for help in identifying her voice in the audio recording. The call was made from a 911-only phone, according to police.\n\nIn this Aug. 18, 2018, file photo, rapper Young Scooter performs onstage during StreetzFest 2K18 at Cellairis Amphitheatre at Lakewood in Atlanta. Paras Griffin/Getty Images, FILE\n\nCourt records show that Spence's bond was set at $7,500. Records also show that she was scheduled to appear for her first hearing on Wednesday. ABC News reached out to Spence's attorney, but requests for comment were not immediately returned.\n\n\"They started shooting, but this, the house needs to be investigated,\" the 911 caller that police identified as Spence says in audio released by police. \"They're definitely doing -- so they're doing illegal stuff over there.\"\n\nThe caller refers to an injured girl who is \"bleeding profusely.\"\n\n\"She's trying to get away, and they're holding her,\" the caller said. \"She's being held hostage … She ran outside naked, and then he was fighting her outside.\"\n\nThe caller noted that there's \"a child in danger as well because she had a baby.\"\n\nAccording to police, Spence was charged with a felony for allegedly transmitting a false public alarm that led to \"serious bodily harm, or death.\" Under Georgia law, if she is convicted, she faces up to 10 years in prison and a fine not less than $50,000.\n\nAhead of Spence's arrest, APD homicide commander Lt. Andrew Smith was asked during a press conference on Friday about the alleged assault and shooting that was reported in the 911 call.\n\n\"We have not been able to substantiate any of that,\" Smith said.\n\nSmith noted that as police who responded to the residence worked to establish a perimeter, \"two males fled out of the rear of the house. One male returned back into the house, the other male jumped two fences as he was fleeing.\"\n\n\"When officers located him on the other side of the fence, he appeared to have suffered an injury to his leg,\" Smith added. \"Officers rendered aid and he was transported to Grady Hospital, where he was pronounced deceased.\"\n\nThe male who suffered a leg injury was later identified as Bailey by the Fulton County Medical Examiner's Office, who confirmed his identity to ABC News on Saturday.\n\nIt is unclear why Bailey ran from police when they responded to the residence. Since he died in police custody, the Georgia Bureau of Investigation announced on Saturday that it has launched a probe into Bailey's death, at the request of APD.\n\nAsked about the status of the investigation, APD and GBI told ABC News that they have no further updates.",

Additionally, Schimel's cozying up to President Donald Trump in a technically nonpartisan race wasn't successful either.\n\nDemocrats and liberal judge Susan Crawford, however, were successful in making this race a referendum on the world's richest man and rallying support on a key issue that may come before the court -- reproductive rights.

Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., said.\n\nBefore the vote, Schumer said of Senate Republicans, \"They know [the tariffs are] a tax hike on the American people. They know that the stock market is in turmoil, risking people's retirements. They know that consumer confidence is down and the odds of a recession --- something people hate, it's harder to find a job, keep a job, maintain your weekly budget if a recession occurs -- and now our greatest financial prognosticators are saying the chances of recession because of these tariffs, this tariff tax, goes way up.\n\n\"So, we're going to fight these tariffs tooth and nail. Trump's done a lot of bad things. This is way up there,\" Schumer said.\n\nTrump, in an early morning post on his social media platform, pressured Republicans to oppose the measure -- going so far as to call out some specific members of his party by name.\n\n\"Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, and Rand Paul, also of Kentucky, will hopefully get on the Republican bandwagon, for a change,\" he wrote on his social media platform.\n\nThe president added the bill \"is just a ploy of the Dems to show and expose the weakness of certain Republicans, namely these four, in that it is not going anywhere because the House will never approve it and I, as your President, will never sign it.\"\n\nHouse Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries also preemptively slammed Trump's tariffs, saying they will make goods more costly.\n\n\"This is not Liberation Day.

Henry McMaster, a Republican, issued executive orders disqualifying Planned Parenthood from receiving state Medicaid reimbursements for non-abortion services, such as cancer screenings and contraception treatments.\n\nThe group has reported drawing 34% of its overall revenue nationwide, or $699 million, from government grants, contracts and Medicaid funds.\n\nJulie Edwards, who has Type 1 diabetes and sought medical care at a Planned Parenthood clinic in Columbia, South Carolina, sued the state alleging a violation of the Medicare and Medicaid Act, which guarantees Medicaid beneficiaries a \"free choice of provider\" that is willing and qualified.\n\n\"If the individual can't sue, then this provision will be meaningless,\" Nicole Saharsky, the plaintiff's attorney, told the court during oral arguments.\n\nEach state has discretion to determine which providers are \"qualified.\" The medical qualifications of Planned Parenthood physicians were not questioned by South Carolina. Instead, the state excluded the clinics solely out of opposition to abortion.\n\nIn this June 24, 2022, file photo, Missouri and American flags fly outside Planned Parenthood in St. Louis. Jeff Roberson/AP, FILE\n\nThe Supreme Court's Democratic-appointed justices seemed to agree unanimously that Edwards has a right to sue under the \"free choice of provider\" provision.\n\n\"A problem that motivated Congress to pass this provision was that states were limiting the choices people had. Some states were saying only state facilities would provide the benefit. Other states were identifying a more limited subset of providers,\" Justice Sonia Sotomayor said.\n\n\"The state has an obligation to ensure that a person ... has a right to choose their doctor,\" Justice Elena Kagan said. \"That's what this provision is. It's impossible to even say the thing without using the word 'right.'\"\n\nThe state of South Carolina argued that federal law does not explicitly establish a \"right\" of individuals to sue over the availability of certain providers in Medicaid and that doing so could open the floodgates to litigation.\n\n\"Telling a state you have an obligation to provide something is not the same as telling a state an individual can sue over it,\" said John Bursch, the attorney for the state.\n\nSeveral of the Supreme Court's Republican-appointed members appeared inclined to side with South Carolina.\n\nJustice Brett Kavanaugh indicated there needs to be clear \"magic words\" in a law indicating a right to sue, suggesting the language might not be clear in this case.\n\n\"One can imagine a statute written as an individual benefit that's mandatory on the states but isn't a right-creating,\" Justice Neil Gorsuch noted.\n\nJustice Samuel Alito suggested that only the federal government could take action against a state if it were alleged to have violated the Medicare and Medicaid Act's \"free choice\" provision.\n\n\"That's the norm for spending clause legislation,\" he said, referring to the state-federal partnership in administering Medicaid.\n\nChief Justice John Roberts and Justice Amy Coney Barrett appeared by their questions more circumspect about their positions on the case.\n\nAn undated photo shows the U.S. Supreme Court building standing in Washington, D.C. Garen Meguerian/Moment via Getty Images, STOCK PHOTO\n\nThe outcome of the case could have a significant impact for Medicaid beneficiaries nationwide, Planned Parenthood clinics that rely on federal funding and anti-abortion advocates hoping states will be more aggressive about ways to cut off the funds.\n\n\"Medicaid beneficiaries often face significant barriers to obtaining care, particularly in South Carolina. Twenty-five percent of state residents live in medically underserved areas,\" the Planned Parenthood plaintiffs wrote in their brief to the high court.\n\n\"[Congress] enacted the free-choice-of-provider provision to ensure that Medicaid patients, like everyone else, can choose their own doctor,\" they added. \"Congress specifically enacted this provision in response to some States' efforts to restrict Medicaid patients' choice of provider.\"\n\nWhile federal law already prohibits any government funding of abortions, South Carolina contends it has the right to target non-abortion funding to abortion providers.\n\n\"Because money is fungible, giving Medicaid dollars to abortion facilities frees up their other funds to provide more abortions,\" the state told the court.\n\nIf the justices allow the suit to go forward, affirming a right to sue over the eligibility of a qualified Medicaid provider, Edwards and Planned Parenthood can continue to challenge the clinics' exclusion from the state's Medicaid program in a lower court.\n\nIf the justices side with the state, they would bolster efforts to cut off Planned Parenthood from sources of government funding and effectively limit the number of providers available to Medicaid recipients.\n\nA decision in the case is expected by the end of the court's term in June.",

Pettersen says it was 'difficult' decision to bring infant son to House floor to fight for proxy voting\n\nDemocratic Rep. Brittany Pettersen, who on Tuesday held her newborn son during a speech on the House floor in support of a bipartisan effort to allow proxy voting for new lawmaker parents, said the decision to bring her 9-week-old was \"difficult,\" but illustrated the need to pass the petition.\n\n\"We have the ability in 2025 to make sure that our voices and our constituents' voices are represented here, even when we have a medical reason for not being able to be here in person,\" Pettersen, holding her son Sam, said in an interview on ABC News Live on Wednesday. \"You know, this is the way things were done hundreds of years ago, I think that we can accommodate for the new workplace challenges here in Congress to make sure more women and in young families can be represented here now.\"\n\nOn Tuesday, a bipartisan group of lawmakers came together over proxy voting for new parents. Nine Republicans joined Democrats to tank a procedural rule that would have blocked a petition to allow new mothers and fathers to vote by proxy.\n\nWith her newborn in her arms, the Colorado Democrat on Tuesday spoke in support of a resolution that would allow new parents -- both mothers and fathers -- the ability to vote by proxy up to 12 weeks after the birth of a child. In her speech -- during which Sam cooed, squealed and squeaked -- Pettersen pleaded for bipartisan cooperation on a measure that she said addressed life events such as parenthood for lawmakers.\n\n\"It was a very difficult decision to fly across the country with Sam, and it's just a decision that nobody should have to make,\" said Pettersen, who added that returning to Washington to work after her son was born prematurely put her in an \"impossible\" situation where she had to both care for a vulnerable newborn and do her job.\n\nRep. Brittany Pettersen with her son on the House floor, April 1, 2025, in Washington, DC. House TV\n\nPettersen is only the 13th member of the House to have given birth while serving in Congress. Fellow new mom, Republican Rep. Anna Paulina Luna -- who had a child in August 2023 -- introduced the petition.\n\nThe House voted to torpedo the procedural rule that would have blocked Luna's proxy vote measure -- throwing the House into disarray and paralyzing the chamber. The vote also called into question Speaker Mike Johnson's ability to control Republicans' razor-thin majority.\n\nHouse Republican leaders, including Johnson, had said they would take the unprecedented step to block Luna's petition\n\nRep. Brittany Pettersen, with her son, speaks to ABC News Live. ABC News\n\nAfter the vote, Johnson said because it failed, \"we can't have any further action on the floor this week.\"\n\nJohnson has said proxy voting is unconstitutional and is the start of a slippery slope that could lead to more and more members voting remotely.\n\nAsked by ABC New Live Anchor Diane Macedo about her response to Johnson's argument, Pettersen said \"my message to Speaker Johnson is just let us vote.\"\n\n\"If we have narrow reasons why people can have their votes represented here if they can't be here in person, that's something that we should be able to vote on,\" she said on ABC News Live.\n\nPettersen had stronger words for Johnson after the rule vote, telling ABC News' Jay O'Brien that her message to the speaker was \"don't f--- with moms.\"\n\nIt's not the first time Pettersen has brought her son along to a House vote. In February, she brought her son to vote in the House budget blueprint.\n\nABC News' Lauren Peller, Jay O'Brien, John Parkinson and Arthur Jones II contributed to this report.",

His term would be up around the end of May, but it was widely rumored that the White House could take steps to keep him on or extend his employment status in some way.\n\nAs ABC News has previously reported, Musk's decision-making has divided Trump's top aides and at times has sparked rifts among those closest to the president.\n\nSome of Musk's defenders in the White House caution reporting that Musk is being pushed out is overblown, sources said.\n\nTrump remains pleased with what Musk and his Department of Government Efficiency team have done with their cost-cutting across the government, despite the backlash publicly and in the courts, according to sources.\n\nElon Musk speaks as President Donald Trump hosts a cabinet meeting in the Cabinet Room of the White House, Mar. 24, 2025, in Washington.

The president was asked specifically about the 130-day special government employee time limit.\n\n\"Well, I think he's … amazing. But I also think he's got a big company to run. And so, at some point he's going to be going back. He wants to,\" Trump said.\n\nABC News previously reported that some White House officials who had grown frustrated with Musk had resigned themselves that the billionaire is unlikely to be reined in anytime soon and had instead focused on managing the situation as best they can until his special government contract comes to an end in May.\n\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt refuted the Politico report in a post on X Wednesday.\n\n\"Elon Musk and President Trump have both *publicly* stated that Elon will depart from public service as a special government employee when his incredible work at DOGE is complete,\" Leavitt said.\n\nThis is a developing story.

(AP Photo/Mike Carlson, File)\n\nWASHINGTON -- Hurricanes Helene, Milton and Beryl were so nasty last year that their names are being retired.\n\nThe World Meteorological Organization on Wednesday officially replaced the names of the trio of 2024 storms that killed more than 300 people and caused more than $119 billion in damage. Brianna, Holly and Miguel take their place in the rotating six-year list of names for Atlantic storms set in advance by a committee of international meteorologists. Retiring the names of killer storms is a regular practice and the list of retired names is approaching 100.\n\nHelene was by far the deadliest and most expensive of the trio with its flooding claiming 249 lives, the most in the United States since 2005's Katrina. It also was the seventh most expensive storm in American history, with damages reaching $78.7 billion, according to the National Hurricane Center. While it came out of the Gulf and hit Florida's Big Bend region as a Category 4, most of the deaths and damage were inland in North Carolina and South Carolina.\n\nMilton came on the heels of Helene, bringing high winds, flooding and tornadoes to cause $34.3 billion in damage, almost all of it in Florida. Beryl, which in June because the earliest Category 5 storm to form in a season, killed 68 people in the United States, Grenada, Venezuela, Jamaica and St. Vincent and the Grenadines.\n\nIn the Pacific region, the name Jack is replacing John, a Category 3 storm that killed 29 people in Mexico.\n\n___\n\nThe Associated Press’ climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

Melanie Stansbury, D-N.M., was speaking at the podium as the secretary appeared at the press conference.\n\n\"We are extraordinarily grateful that the secretary gave us the space to have these conversations, but with all due respect, madam, I think my biggest concern is that the states will not be able to protect the programs and services that you would like to devolve with them,\" she said before ceding the microphone, noting that the mood during the meeting was \"collegial.\"\n\nThen, the secretary stepped to the podium in front of the group of Democratic lawmakers, who had met with her in her office for about an hour.\n\n\"I just want to express my gratitude to all of these folks who came today so we can have an open discussion about what I believe is one of the most important things that we can have a discussion on or action on in our country, and that is the education of our young people,\" McMahon said upon taking the podium.\n\n\"This is not a partisan issue. This is about the children of America and its next generation after that, and if we want to have our leaders and if we want to have that next group of engineers and doctors and lawyers and plumbers and electricians and HV/AC operators, then we need to focus on how they can best have their education,\" she added.\n\nEducation Secretary Linda McMahon during a press conference outside of the Department of Education in Washington, D.C., April 2, 2025.

Pool via ABC News\n\nLater Wednesday, McMahon posted on X about the meeting.\n\n\"This morning, I hosted a meeting with House Democrats to hear their concerns,\" she said. \"Our collective goal should be to support students, not the broken bureaucracy.\"\n\nThe meeting comes after weeks of confusion in Washington as the Department of Education slashed nearly half its workforce and lawmakers have been demanding answers from the Trump administration.\n\nReps. Jamie Raskin, D-Md., Veronica Escobar, D-Texas, Frederica Wilson, D-Fla., Don Beyer, D-Va., and Greg Casar, D-Texas, also attended the meeting..\n\nChaos ensued outside the agency the last time Democrats tried to meet with department officials as Takano and around two dozen lawmakers were rejected access inside the building.\n\nThis time they met with McMahon amid the administration's attempt to dismantle and spearhead the historic overhaul of the department as directed by President Donald Trump.\n\nThe members said McMahon took the right step in meeting with them and that she assured them she would work with Congress to move statutory functions to other agencies and follow federal law. However, Wilson said McMahon indicated she is following the president's directive in moving the student loan portfolio for more than 40 million people to the Small Business Administration.\n\nMcMahon also told the Democratic lawmakers in the meeting that there will be additional workforce cuts at the department, Takano said.\n\nMeanwhile, the meeting seemed to leave many with unanswered questions, and after McMahon left the podium, Stanbury said the secretary has no plans that she shared with them.\n\nCasar, the Congressional Progressive Caucus chairman, said he grew frustrated and even more alarmed during the meeting because he suggested McMahon's mission will gut public schools.\n\n\"What she tried to say, in the nicest of terms, is that she wants to get rid of the guardrails and protections for all of our kids and instead say, No, we can have it set up so that states can give money to the private schools that we like and take away money from the public schools that we may not like,\" Casar said.\n\nWilson, a senior member of the House Education and the Workforce Committee, passionately defended public education.\n\n\"For the Department of Education to be dismantled, it is going to bring a shock to this nation,\" said Wilson, a former principal and lifelong educator. \"Schools are the bedrock of this nation. When schools are working, our country is, too.\"",

Trump described such duties as \"reciprocal tariffs,\" though he noted that the U.S. would impose tariffs at half the level of the trade barriers slapped on U.S. products.\n\n\"We will charge them approximately half of what they are and have been charging us,\" Trump said. \"We're kind people.\" He added later in his remarks, \"This is not full reciprocal.

In each case, the U.S. will impose a reciprocal tariff rate at 50% of the level attributed to a given country.\n\nUnder the \"reciprocal\" tariffs plan, the U.S. will impose the following levies on goods imported from the following countries at these rates:\n\nChina: 34%\n\nEuropean Union: 20%\n\nJapan: 24%\n\nBoth China and Japan were among the top five importers to the U.S., according to the U.S. Trade Representative.

The total value of goods imported from the European Union in 2022 was more than $553 billion.\n\nThe 34% reciprocal rate for China is in addition to a previous 20% tariff Trump slapped on the nation -- bringing the effective tariff rate on one of the U.S.'s biggest trading partners to 54% total.\n\nWhat's not covered by the new tariffs?\n\nMexico and Canada -- two of the U.S.'s biggest trading partners -- are not affected by the reciprocal tariffs. Goods that fall under the U.S.-Mexico-Canada free-trade agreement will continue to not see tariffs, while non-USMA goods are already under a 25% tariff, announced by Trump last month.\n\nIn addition, some goods will not be subject to the new reciprocal tariffs, including steel and aluminum imports, which are already under a 25% tariff that went into effect last week. The reciprocal tariffs also do not include copper, pharmaceuticals, semiconductors and lumber.\n\nWhen do the new tariffs take effect?\n\nThe universal 10% tariff is set to take effect on the morning of April 5, and the reciprocal tariffs will hit products on the morning of April 9, White House officials said.\n\nEconomists widely expect tariffs to raise prices for U.S. consumers, since importers typically pass along a share of the tax burden in the form of higher costs.\n\n\"For decades, the U.S. slashed our trade barriers on other countries while those nations placed massive tariffs on our products,\" Trump said.\n\n\"This all happened with no response from the United States of America -- none whatsoever,\" Trump added. \"But those days are over.\"\n\nABC News' Jack Moore contributed to this report.",

He later filed an I-589 application for asylum and although Abrego Garcia was found removable, an immigration judge \"granted him withholding of removal to El Salvador.\n\n\"Defendants' protestation that Plaintiff is an MS-13 member, their legal argument that he is estopped for arguing otherwise, and Plaintiff's contention that the gang allegations arise from the flimsiest of unreliable anonymous informants, will be properly addressed to an immigration court,\" Sandoval-Moshenberg said in Wednesday's filing.\n\nAlleged members of the Venezuelan criminal organization Tren de Aragua who were deported by the U.S. government, are detained at the Terrorism Confinement Center in Tecoluca, El Salvador in a photo obtained Mar. 16, 2025.

He was then sent to El Salvador on March 15.",

Strom Thurmond, who filibustered the Civil Rights Act of 1957 for 24 hours and 18 minutes.\n\nBooker was \"very aware\" of Thurmond's record going into the speech.\n\n\"I was very aware of Strom Thurmond's record since I got to the Senate.

He had pleaded not guilty.\n\nHo declined to endorse the DOJ's desired outcome.\n\n\"In light of DOJ's rationales, dismissing the case without prejudice would create the unavoidable perception that the Mayor's freedom depends on his ability to carry out the immigration enforcement priorities of the administration, and that he might be more beholden to the demands of the federal government than to the wishes of his own constituents. That appearance is inevitable, and it counsels in favor of dismissal with prejudice,\" Ho decided.\n\nNew York City Mayor Eric Adams speaks during a press conference at City Hall in Manhattan in New York City, March 24, 2025. Jeenah Moon/Reuters, FILE\n\nFollowing the judge's decision, a Justice Department spokesperson said the Adams case, which was brought during the Biden administration, \"was an example of political weaponization and a waste of resources.\"\n\n\"We are focused on arresting and prosecuting terrorists while returning the Department of Justice to its core mission of keeping Americans safe,\" the spokesperson added.\n\nHo's 78-page opinion dismantled the Justice Department's stated rationale for dismissal: so Adams could focus on the Trump administration's immigration priorities.\n\nThe judge said he could find no other example of the government dismissing charges against an elected official to enable the official to facilitate federal policy goals.\n\n\"DOJ's immigration enforcement rationale is both unprecedented and breathtaking in its sweep,\" Ho said. \"And DOJ's assertion that it has 'virtually unreviewable' license to dismiss charges on this basis is disturbing in its breadth, implying that public officials may receive special dispensation if they are compliant with the incumbent administration's policy priorities. That suggestion is fundamentally incompatible with the basic premise of equal justice under the law.\"\n\nHo also made clear he was not weighing the facts of the case and said his decision \"is not about whether Mayor Adams is innocent or guilty.\"\n\nStill, Adams' lawyer celebrated the decision to drop the charges without the fear of them being revived after the mayoral election in November -- as the Justice Department had threatened.\n\n\"The case against Eric Adams should have never been brought in the first place -- and finally today that case is gone forever,\" Alex Spiro, Adams' lawyer, said in a statement. \"From Day 1, the mayor has maintained his innocence and now justice for Eric Adams and New Yorkers has prevailed.\"\n\nAdams echoed that sentiment in remarks outside Gracie Mansion on Wednesday.\n\n\"Let me be clear, as I've said all along, this case should have never been brought and I did nothing wrong,\" Adams said. \"I'm now happy that our city can finally close the book on this and focus solely on the future of our great city.\"\n\nAdams also held up Kash Patel's 2023 book, \"Government Gangsters,\" in which the now-FBI director called for a \"comprehensive housecleaning\" of the Justice Department.\n\n\"I'm going to encourage every New Yorker to read it,\" Adams said. \"Read it and understand how we can never allow this to happen to another innocent American.\"\n\nNew York City Mayor Eric Adams appears before a House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform hearing with Sanctuary City Mayors on Capitol Hill, Wednesday, March 5, 2025, in Washington. Rod Lamkey/AP, FILE\n\nThe decision to dismiss the charges came just days after Adams' lawyer had pushed for them to be dismissed ahead of the April 3 deadline for petitions to be submitted for mayoral candidates to get on the June primary ballot. Adams has said he will run as a Democrat in the primary despite criticism from opponents he has cozied up to the Trump administration in recent months, meeting with the president and attending his Inauguration instead of scheduled Martin Luther King Day events in the city.\n\nThe decision by Ho followed the recommendation from Paul Clement, who served as solicitor general under the Bush administration and was appointed by Ho to make an independent assessment of the case.\n\n\"A dismissal without prejudice creates a palpable sense that the prosecution outlined in the indictment and approved by a grand jury could be renewed, a prospect that hangs like the proverbial Sword of Damocles over the accused,\" Clement said.\n\nThe eventual dismissal came after a scathing letter from acting U.S. Attorney Danielle Sassoon to U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi, suggesting acting Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove and other members of DOJ leadership were explicitly aware of a quid pro quo suggested by Adams' attorneys, saying Adams' vocal support of Trump's immigration policies would be boosted by dismissing the indictment against him.\n\nSassoon, who was appointed by President Donald Trump, resigned in protest along with several other career DOJ officials.\n\nSpiro, Adams' lawyer, balked at the notion of a quid pro quo following Sassoon's resignation: \"The idea that there was a quid pro quo is a total lie. We offered nothing and the department asked nothing of us.\"",

        "content": "Why the Congo Basin appears to be more resilient than the Amazon remains an incredibly complex question, and researchers are looking for answers in the trees. Back at Yangambi, Yakusu leads me down a trail through the surrounding forest and then signals that we should head deeper into the underbrush. As we leave the path, the texture of the ground suddenly changes, crackling softly as dried branches snap beneath our feet and then grow squishy as we step over the soft husk of a decomposing tree trunk. We finally stop in front of a huge tree with a wide, smooth trunk that juts high into the canopy. Part of the mahogany family of trees, it belongs to a particular native species called Entandrophragma utile.\n\nThe tree is part of another long-term survey that’s been happening at the station. To inspect it properly, Yakusu unslings his backpack and produces a wood borer shaped a bit like an oversize corkscrew, placing it against the trunk a few feet above the ground. When he turns the handle, the hardwood seems to resist at first, creaking under the pressure being applied. After a few minutes, Yakusu extracts a long, thin core sample of wood from the inner layers, which he carefully inserts into a protective sleeve. “You have to be careful to not let it break,” he says.\n\nInside the station’s modern wood biology lab—another first in the DRC—researchers would be able to compare the tree’s height and trunk diameter with visible rings from the core sample to determine changes in its growth over time in relation to the climate. “As we’ve demonstrated, the rainforest is warming,” Yakusu says. “This means that the environment in which these trees grow is changing and the conditions for growth are no longer optimal.” In the long run, decreased tree growth could lead to higher tree mortality in the region, one factor responsible for the Amazon’s diminishing capacity to store carbon.\n\nAlready some tree species are disappearing. In the research station’s archives, detailed records on a tree from the same genus, Entandrophragma palustre, show that it was once the most studied species at Yangambi. “But in this forest, you won’t find a single palustre today,” says Yakusu. At the same time, some trees are proving more resistant to extreme climate shifts, which could hold the key to helping the forest adapt. Chadrack Kafuti and Brice Djiofack, two tropical ecologists working at Yangambi’s wood lab, have been closely studying the adaptations of Pericopsis elata, a large-leaved hardwood with the surprising capacity to pause its growth during periods of drought or when sunlight is scarce. That kind of resilience could help direct replanting in areas where the forest has been logged for lumber or affected by wildfires, which are increasingly common.\n\n(Our report on when the Congo Basin reopened to large-scale logging.)",

        "source": "https://news.nationalgeographic.com/",
        "content": "“For millennia, man used his fingers to bring food to his mouth,” explains Galasso. “It was probably for this reason that the need for a fork was felt less than that of the spoon and knife; in fact, it was born last, and its use was sporadic before its definitive adoption towards the middle of the 19th century.”\n\nThis preference for hand-eating wasn’t just practical, but cultural. Across Europe, communal eating from shared platters was common. Hands and knives were used to tear and share food, reinforcing a sense of closeness and shared experience at the table.\n\nReligious leaders took issue with the fork's similarity to the devil's pitchfork. Photograph By The Metropolitan Museum of Art While forks were primarily used for cooking and serving in ancient civilizations, the utensil's popularity later amongst the upper class was a point of contention. Photograph By The Metropolitan Museum of Art\n\nThe fork's resemblance to the devil’s tines\n\nThe first major scandal involving the fork took place in the 11th century when Princess Maria Argyropoula, a Byzantine noblewoman, married the Venetian Doge’s son. At her lavish wedding feast, Maria produced an ornate, two-pronged golden fork and used it to bring food to her lips.\n\nUnlimited Access for Less Subscribe now and save $10 SUBSCRIBE\n\nShortly after the event, a Venetian clergyman publicly condemned her actions in a passionate sermon. “God in his wisdom has provided man with natural forks—his fingers,” he declared. “Therefore, it is an insult to Him to substitute them with metal forks.”\n\nFor the clergy, the fork wasn’t just unnecessary—it was an affront to the divine order. Hands were how people were meant to eat, just as Christ and his disciples had at The Last Supper. Inserting a man-made tool between hand and mouth disrupted a sacred, natural act.\n\nThe use of the fork was seen as a filthy rejection of divine intention. Painting By Ugolino da Siena (Ugolino di Nerio) Photograph By The Metropolitan Museum of Art\n\nThe fork’s rise amongst the upper class during the 11th century left a bad taste in the mouths of religious leaders and cultural purists. The clergy feared it signified a dangerous shift in how society controlled food, power, and behavior.\n\nReligious leaders also couldn’t ignore the fork’s disturbing resemblance to the devil’s pitchfork. At a time when Satan was frequently depicted holding a three- or four-pronged trident, the fork felt too close for comfort.\n\n(The hellish history of the devil: Satan in the Middle Ages.)\n\nAccording to Galasso, the Church’s resistance to the fork also reflected deeper fears about wealth, indulgence, and moral decay. “The Church preached simplicity at the table,” she explains. “Hands were seen as a direct, humble connection to food—something that all people, rich or poor, shared. The fork, by contrast, was an emblem of excess, a sign of aristocratic vanity.”\n\nBefore the fork, dining was all about getting your hands dirty—literally. “Medieval tables were chaotic, but structured by social negotiation,” says Albala. “You reached into shared dishes, carved off what you needed, and physically connected with both the food and the people around you. Dining was intimate; you literally touched the same food as your companions.” Even royalty embraced this hands-on approach, sharing directly from common plates and oversized platters, reinforcing bonds through the messy, primal act of eating.",

It scratches the tree, puts its paws down, saws and disappears into the darkness,” Kadur recalls of the moment that set him on the course of his life’s work.\n\nHe was a 15-year-old boy in Bangalore, India who had buried himself in books about big cats, mostly books by hunter-turned-conservationist Jim Corbett . Inspired, Kadur and a friend rode their bikes into the jungle one night and pedaled toward a particular tree that sat above a watering hole, one frequented by the “man-eating tigers or leopards” described in Cobertt’s literature. Kadur had, in his imagination, camped out with Corbett in moonlit trees several times before, waiting for big cats. This time it was real.\n\n“In that beautiful dappled moonlight and shadow, that’s when I realized that this was what I wanted to do when I grew up. Experience moments like this, capture them and share them with the world.”\n\nAs an acclaimed wildlife filmmaker and photographer, Kadur has dedicated his life to illuminating endangered species and their fragile habitats.

And above all does the method develop Leadership and a sense of responsibility? These are the questions the Powers that be are asking themselves. They realise the enormous possibilities of applied Scouting and, hence—my raison d’etre.”\n\nCookie Moore arrived at a critical moment for the Girl Scouts, when the organization was one of several competing for political support, financial resources, and the loyalties of girls in the United States. In the early 1920s, active membership in Girl Scouts held a distant second place to Camp Fire Girls, who boasted close connections to the fabulously popular Boy Scouts, with a half million boys.\n\nOutdoorsy organizations flourished due to major social changes. Families were moving away from fields and farms and into villages, towns, and cities. The 1920 Census determined that the country was more urban than rural for the first time ever—and children increasingly spent their days indoors at schools rather than working in the fresh air. This shift alarmed some parents and social reformers, says Pamela Riney-Kehrberg, distinguished professor of history at Iowa State University. “There’s this real fear that children are going to be damaged physically, emotionally, mentally, by not having contact with the natural world,” she says. “Scouts allowed children to explore many different activities: sports, hiking, nature, cooking. Opportunity after opportunity.” And unlike school, kids were allowed to choose how they learned about the world.\n\nScouting boomed for boys, with camping as a centerpiece, but the two girls’ organizations interpreted female abilities quite differently. True to the name, Camp Fire Girls did camp, but the program overall emphasized household roles. One proponent encouraged a fun time with: “Find poetry in washing dishes.” In contrast, Girl Scouts offered a more expansive view of thrills girls might chase, even as they abided by societal expectations for learning household duties.\n\nAs Cookie settled in at Camp Andree, the divergent philosophies of the two groups were on display in their monthly magazines where both organizations promoted photography contests. Everygirl published a partial page of general guidance by the national executive of the Camp Fire Girls, a businessman. The American Girl published a two-page spread of technical tricks, critiques of photos, and guidance on how to craft a visual story, all written by Jessie Tarbox Beals, one of the first female photojournalists. A camera “is an instrument of great power and influence if understood and used correctly,” she told her young readers, and even a cheap model, she said, could provide a path to a full-blown career for any Girl Scout.",

        "content": "The river flows vast and soundless. It’s December in southern Kazakhstan, and the landscape near the Syr Darya River is smudged in shades of brown and taupe—dormant grasses, silted floodplains, leafless trees. This is not the most picturesque stretch of riverbank, strewn as it is with food wrappers, bottles, a decomposing sedan. Overhead, the sun is obscured by a haze of coal- and woodsmoke. But when it comes to what Bernie Kuhajda is searching for, the spot feels perfect.\n\n“This is the habitat we need,” says Kuhajda, an aquatic conservation biologist with the Tennessee Aquarium Conservation Institute. He’s hoping to find a species of sturgeon—the Syr Darya—that’s native to these waters but hasn’t been seen since the 1960s, after a series of Soviet dams was built throughout the river system. Those projects blocked access to the fish’s spawning grounds and forever changed the flow of the Syr Darya, which drains from the high peaks of Kyrgyzstan into what is now the remnants of the Aral Sea. If the sturgeon somehow still exists, Kuhajda thinks this silty, shallow expanse of river is where it can be found.\n\n(Critically endangered sturgeons threatened by proposed dams in Caucasus.)\n\nSome months earlier, Kuhajda had been contacted by the conservation organization Re:Wild, which administers a program to search for what it calls lost species—creatures that haven’t been seen for at least a decade and could be extinct, but there’s not enough data to be conclusive. The officials at Re:Wild reached out to Kuhajda knowing that he was one of a very small collection of scientists who have ever laid eyes on the Syr Darya sturgeon. As a graduate student in the 1990s, he visited museums in London, Moscow, and St. Petersburg and videotaped 27 spindled specimens, bleached white from years of storage. “They said, ‘You’re the expert,’ ” Kuhajda says, remembering the call with Re:Wild. “And I said, ‘Well, I’ve seen them dead in a jar.’ ”",

        "content": "Mei Zhang grew up amid the emerald-cloaked mountains of Yunnan, China, where an old joke mentions that the gorges were so narrow, and their slopes so steep, that you could shout across the valleys to ask your nearest neighbors to dinner. The punchline—in a region where walking paths were the only links between some rural homes—is that it would still take them all day to arrive.\n\n“The mountains and the trails shaped the way people lived,” recalls Zhang, a National Geographic Explorer and founder of the travel company WildChina. They defined Zhang’s childhood, even as the landscape fired her yearning to see the world. “When you looked out in front of you, it was mountains after mountains. And you didn’t know what was beyond,” she says.\n\nMany of the trails that Zhang walked as a child fell into disrepair as modernizing China sprouted cities, railroads, and highways at a breakneck pace. But today, some are newly accessible to travelers, who can explore in the footsteps of those who forged them.\n\nIn part, that’s thanks to Zhang’s work to revitalize one of the oldest and most iconic paths in Yunnan, the 1,000-year-old Tea Horse Road. Once a trade route joining lush Yunnan tea forests with markets in highland Tibet, it was gradually abandoned—and at times lost entirely. Reimagining the path as a hiking route, Zhang hopes the Tea Horse Trail will help sustain the mountain culture she grew up with and bring economic gains to little-visited rural areas.\n\n“They offer this feeling of connection to the land, connection to tradition, connection to heritage,” Zhang says. “I’m like … there’s got to be a way to keep these going.” The question of how to do that is the subject of her dissertation at the University of California, Berkeley, where Zhang is a Ph.D. candidate studying the Tea Horse Trail; this spring, she’s returning to Yunnan to walk and conduct research along it.\n\n(Related: Rediscovering China’s ancient Tea Horse Road, a branch of the famous Silk Road.)\n\nWhere to hike an ancient footpath\n\nHer work goes beyond academia, too. The Tea Horse Trail is a cornerstone of WildChina’s GUDAO Project, which aims to restore the Tea Horse Trail and other largely forgotten paths across China. (“Gudao” means ancient trails in Chinese.”) In February of this year, WildChina launched a series of new walking tours along those trails, from an overnight trek through the West Mountains outside Beijing to a 6-day Biluo Snow Mountain trip in the footsteps of early Catholic missionaries.\n\nNuodeng, a former Tea Horse Trail town, has some of the best-preserved examples of traditional Bai architecture in China’s Yunnan Province.

Photograph by Leisa Tyler, LightRocket via Getty Images\n\nIf the initiative is a personal passion for Zhang, it also comes at a time when historic walking trails are making a comeback around the globe, backdropped by landscapes as varied as the cultures calling them home. In the dense forests of northern Sweden and Norway, the 149-mile Finnskogleden follows paths taken by 17th-century Finnish immigrants; many of the trail’s 13 sections are accessible as day hikes, and you can walk the entire trail in around two weeks.\n\nAmid the rock formations and desert peaks of southern Jordan, the newly opened, 75-mile Wadi Rum Trail knits together old trade routes and Haj pilgrimage paths. In keeping with ancient Bedouin traditions, most hikers explore the trail alongside guides from local tribes.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the Slow Ways project aims to map and promote walking routes between every British town and city, including along prehistoric paths dating to the Neolithic period; visitors can use an online route planner to find nearby trails or plot multi-day adventures. The 250-mile Trans-Bhutan Trail, which opened in 2022, follows 16th-century Buddhist pilgrimage routes, winding from village to village across the mountain kingdom. The nonprofit that founded the trail offers guided hikes, including two annual departures that tackle the entire distance—an epic, 36-day trek.\n\n(Related: Why ancient pilgrimages are back in vogue in the UK.)\n\nFrom slow travel to slow living\n\nHiking such trails offers more than a scenic walk in nature, says Daniel Svensson, an associate professor at Sweden’s Malmö University who has studied the Finnskogleden and other heritage paths. “There are these longer perspectives on history that you can find on these trails,” he says. “[They] are connected to a way of life where slow mobility was more common.”\n\nThat way of life is within living memory in Yunnan and other places where the trails have reemerged. Construction on Bhutan’s first road began only in 1960, notes Sam Blyth, founder of the Bhutan Canada Foundation, which led the initiative to restore the Trans-Bhutan Trail. Before the second half of the 20th century, walking paths were the only way to get from place to place in the country. When hiking the Trans-Bhutan Trail, Blyth says he met elders who recall how, as the old trails and bridges lapsed, villages were severed from their nearest neighbors, divided by a steep slope or rushing river.\n\n“They lost touch with people who had been part of their lives, and communities, for decades,” Blyth says. By rebuilding bridges and paths, the Trans-Bhutan Trail helped restore such ties, while also delivering income sources to far-flung places. “They’re fixing up rooms in their house for travelers, they’re opening cafes and small restaurants,” says Blyth, noting that a walking trail can more directly help local people than big resorts and hotels. “We wanted to see real grassroots benefits.”\n\n(Related: Discovering misty peaks and monasteries on the newly restored Trans-Bhutan Trail.)\n\nLiving traditions on the trail\n\nFor nomadic Bedouin communities in Jordan and Egypt, meanwhile, guiding visitors on the ancient trails draws on skills passed down between generations, from navigation to desert survival, says Olivia Mason, a lecturer in geography at Newcastle University who has studied the geopolitics of walking trails.\n\n“The trails can be really important, because they work with livelihoods that are mobile in some ways, and actually continue to promote that,” says Mason, contrasting the culturally relevant, meaningful work of guiding walkers with more typical tourism jobs, such as working in a gift shop. While doing research among Bedouin communities near trails in Jordan, Mason has noticed that for some families, guiding work has the potential to keep young people in rural places, offsetting a trend to seek jobs in urban areas. “When I speak to the children of the trail guides, the children say, ‘I want to be a guide, like my father,’” she says.\n\nThat living history is vital because trails are heritage unlike any other. If left untended, trails swiftly vanish, whether swallowed by evergreen forests, or buried in desert sands, or wrapped in a spongy carpet of moss. It’s only in the walking that trails survive for generations to come, says Daniel Svensson, the Swedish trails researcher. In that light, travelers on ancient trails aren’t just seeking out history—they’re actively participating in its preservation.\n\n“You can’t take a trail and put it in a museum … it’s something you need to continue to use,” Svensson says. “It’s a physical manifestation of history.”\n\n(Related: Discover the real Transylvania on a new long-distance hiking trail.)",

Over time, Romanian chefs and home cooks have skillfully reinterpreted these diverse flavors, crafting dishes that honor local resources while enriching the deep culinary traditions that have flourished here for centuries.\n\nNicknamed “Little Paris” between the two World Wars for its elegant architecture and grand boulevards, Bucharest has an enduring admiration for French refinement. That same sensibility is now shaping Bucharest’s gastronomic scene. A new generation of chefs — many trained in top European kitchens — are returning home, eager to blend modern techniques with Romania’s rich culinary heritage. They join Romanian cooks and expat chefs who have made Bucharest home, to create a dynamic and diverse gastronomic landscape.\n\nBucharest's award-winning dining scene is getting noticed by people all over the world. Photograph by John Wreford, SOPA Images/AP Images\n\nEat where the locals eat\n\nWith hundreds of restaurants catering to a city of two million people, choosing where to eat can be daunting. While guidebooks often lead tourists to iconic spots like Caru’ cu bere and Hanu’ lui Manuc, locals have their own best-kept secrets, tucked inside historical mansions or disguised as humble market stalls.\n\nYou’ll find Bǎcǎnia Veche in an old building just off the lively Piața Romană. With its exposed brick walls and wooden shelves lined with artisanal preserves and wildflower honey, it sets the stage for nostalgic dishes that bring back childhood memories and grandmother’s cooking. Its fork-tender pork roast lays on the fluffiest mashed potatoes and it is smothered in a silky, smoky plum sauce.\n\nArzu is a bright and bustling spot reminiscent of Yotam Ottolenghi’s London delis, prides itself with delivering “unapologetically excessive, bold flavors” to its faithful clientele: Smooth chicken pâté topped with boozy raisins soaked in wine, sweet potato wedges sprinkled with spicy peanuts, and quiche with five-spice roasted pumpkin, feta cheese, and hazelnuts.\n\nHidden on a quiet residential street in a charming Art Nouveau villa, 15A transports diners to the early 1900s with its antique furnishings and soft candlelight. But the menu is thoroughly modern: Crisp-edged crêpes stuffed with feta and spinach, pork roulade wrapped in salty prosciutto, and perch au gratin with wild mushrooms and ham. On a warm summer evening, the enchanting outdoor patio is the perfect setting for a slow meal with a glass of Feteascǎ Neagrã wine.\n\nFor a quick bite, Senviș comes highly recommended by locals for premium ingredients and a creative flavor profile. This small but mighty sandwich shop is known for enticing fillings: Think creamy artichoke sauce, eggplant chunks sautéed in olive oil, and a generous serving of caprese salad, all wrapped in a pillowy, artisanal pita bread.\n\nIf you want to eat like a true Bucureștean, head to Terasa Obor. This unassuming street food vendor located in the busy Obor Market is the place to sample the best mici in town: Juicy, char-grilled meat rolls sizzling over an open flame. The secret mix of ground beef and pork gives them a rich and smoky depth. A dash of baking soda makes them airy, and a hint of garlic seals their signature taste. Enjoy them hot off the grill, with a fluffy bread bun and a dollop of zesty mustard — they are the ultimate Romanian street food.\n\n(Related: A guide to Bucharest, Romania's underrated capital)\n\nFine dining with a Romanian twist\n\nWhile Bucharest’s backstreets hide cozy, traditional eateries, its fine dining scene is making waves, too, reimagining Romanian flavors with modern techniques.\n\n“The food scene in Bucharest is evolving,” says Radu Ionescu-Feher, executive chef at KAIAMO restaurant. “It resembles an escargot, a snail. Slowly moving on its way, I want to believe in the right direction. Nonetheless, the good thing about a snail is that it carries its home with it, always, on its back.” Recognized by Gault & Millau Romania as one of the best restaurants in the country and included in the 50 Best Discovery guide, KAIAMO is at the forefront of the fine dining movement. Here, simple ingredients like beetroot, goat cheese, and shallot marmalade reinterpret Henri Matisse’s \"La Blouse Roumaine,\" a delicate plate that tells a story of Romania’s past and future.\n\nKAIAMO's menu is exclusively a tasting menu, and changes daily. Salată Trancu-Iași 1939 is named after a recipe from 1939. Photograph by Platon – Fotograf Culinar\n\nAt NOUA, chef Alex Petricean takes diners on a journey across Romania’s regions.\n\n\"Romania On A Plate\" is an experience that begins with a wooden puzzle map of the country, where each piece comes with a dish rooted in local traditions reinvented with modern precision. Imagine a Moldovan stuffed grape leaf reimagined with unexpected textures, or a surprising potato foam with fermented plums.\n\nCompleting this elite trio is Kané, where chef Daniel Pǎlici emphasizes using seasonal and locally grown products in an imaginative and ever-changing menu. Mindful of sustainable and humane farming practices and drawing inspiration from a combination of memories and familiar flavors, chef Pǎlici brings an element of surprise and dynamism to the table. In his creative kitchen, eggplant that has been cured for several days takes on the creamy, earthy qualities of Camembert, while pigeon leftovers are masterfully turned into an umami-rich garum sauce.\n\nWhere to go for international cuisine\n\nBucharest’s appetite for international flavors is growing, with new cafes and restaurants opening at a dizzying speed. For exceptional sushi, go to Tobiko Sushi Fusion, where chef Alexandru Gușǎ creates a sweet and sour dragon maki roll — tempura shrimp is wrapped in avocado and kabayaki-style eel, then topped with fresh strawberries and mango sauce. Napoletinii serves wood-fired pizza crafted with love, using original recipes from Naples. Truffle and prosciutto crudo meet mozzarella di bufala and sundried tomatoes in a pie that makes an impression. IMZA is a fine dining Turkish spot in the heart of the busy Dorobanți area. They serve delicacies like pastrami-stuffed phyllo balls and juicy lamb kebabs seasoned with fragrant spices from Anatolia. Located in an upscale residential area near Piața Victoriei, Pata Negra is a beautifully designed restaurant (complete with a refined outdoor patio). The menu reads like a love letter to Spain: Crispy octopus croquettes, silky tuna tataki, and a delicate king crab mousse, each plate presented with an artist’s touch.",

        "source": "https://news.nationalgeographic.com/",
        "content": "This article was produced by National Geographic Traveller (UK).\n\nFamilies know what to expect from a visit to Florida, right? Disney World, Universal Studios and other theme parks are the main reason for many visits to the southern state. Yet Florida has a lot more to offer kids on a stimulating, active and even educational family holiday. You can snorkel or try Snuba off the coast, kayak through mangrove channels inhabited by manatees, visit the holiday home of one of the world’s greatest inventors, explore the Everglades swamps, track dolphins on Marco River and learn about the culture of tribespeople who once inhabited the region. You won’t go hungry, either: this is the spot for the freshest seafood and the US’s classic Key lime pie. And the weather is reliably pleasant: there’s a reason why Florida’s nickname is the Sunshine State.\n\nDolphin spotting\n\nBest for: marine ecology\n\nYou can see wild dolphins all year round in Florida, thanks to its warm climate and food-rich waters. Key West National Wildlife Refuge, off the southern tip of the state, is a collection of reefs and mangrove islands much loved by the bottlenose variety. Families can head out to see them aboard the Squid — an electric boat operated by Honest Eco Tours. Alternatively, join naturalist Bob McConville at Marco Island in southwest Florida on a Dolphin Explorer excursion. He’s been studying the resident population for approximately 20 years and his stories about the dolphins of the Big Marco River feel like a soap opera of the animals’ lives.\n\nEverglade kayaking\n\nBest for: hands-on history\n\nPart of the Everglades National Park, Ten Thousand Islands is a tightly packed collection of mangrove-covered coastal islets whose channels harbour colonies of egrets, breeding manatees and ospreys that swoop on mullet in the shallow waters. Five hundred years ago, some of the islets were inhabited by the Calusa Indian tribe, who bravely resisted would-be Spanish colonialists when they pitched up in the 1500s. Take a tour with Don McCumber in his flat-bottomed boat to learn about the wildlife and history. The trip includes a chance for a gentle kayak from the main boat to the shores of some of the islets to see ancient pottery and tools fashioned from conch shells by the tribespeople.\n\nClassic Florida food\n\nBest for: Americana on a plate\n\nFood in Florida comes in family-sized portions, meaning kids can often share meals to keep costs down. For staggering seafood, don’t miss the Half Shell Raw Bar in Key West, where staff shuck oysters by the dozen at the open kitchen, and serve platters of lobster tail, clams and stuffed shrimp. They also do burgers, sandwiches and a mean Key lime pie. For a taste of an American diner, head to Ford’s Garage in downtown Fort Myers, which has booth seating, burgers with sides of high-piled onion rings, and a vintage Ford hanging from the ceiling. For sweet treats, visit Kilwins in Naples, which makes renowned ice creams and fudges.\n\nAlligators are common companions on tours through the swampy Everglades. Photograph by Dennis Axer, Getty Images\n\nBoardwalk adventures\n\nBest for: alligator appreciation\n\nThe most notorious residents of the Everglades are alligators and the wetlands have raised boardwalks that make searching for them an accessible adventure for families. Exploring on foot also allows you to get up close to other fascinating species, such as fishing spiders and red-bellied turtles. Northeast of Naples in southern Florida, the two-mile boardwalk through Corkscrew Swamp Sanctuary is a classic. For something less visited, try the one-mile boardwalk through Six Mile Cypress Slough Preserve, a wetland that hosts otters, wading birds and lots of other wildlife.\n\nTurtle hospital touring\n\nBest for: budding vets\n\nTurtles face numerous hazards in the Florida Keys: being hit by boat propellors, caught in fishing nets and choked by plastic bags. The Turtle Hospital, in Marathon, admits hundreds of sick and injured creatures each year. Families can tour the operating theatre and rehab tanks to learn about the hospital’s work and visit the patients — including green, hawksbill and at-risk Kemp’s Ridley turtles. Entry fees help keep the centre running.\n\nFlorida Keys exploration\n\nBest for: aspiring scuba divers\n\nSnuba is perfect for kids keen to explore underwater. The mix of scuba and snorkelling requires no special training and lets you go six metres beneath the waves while breathing through a tube linked to tanks on the surface. Sundance Watersports runs catamaran trips to coral reefs around Islamorada in the Keys, with an option to Snuba for kids aged eight and above. Those who feel nervous can snorkel instead, keeping an eye out for green turtles and angelfish.\n\nEdison house hotel\n\nBest for: Inspiring inventors\n\nEven pioneering inventors need a break once in a while. In the late 19th century, Thomas Edison — who helped usher in the age of electricity — built a holiday home in Fort Myers in southwestern Florida. His friend and motor luminary Henry Ford based himself there too and you can visit the rooms where they relaxed and entertained. Older children will enjoy Edison’s laboratory and the display of early Ford cars and prototypes of Edison’s inventions, while younger kids can follow a pelican-themed scavenger hunt.",

I’ve literally had a front-row seat to the wonders of nature, young and old, big and small. Every day, I’m thrilled and amazed by who stares into my camera lens, especially when they’re newly minted.\n\nI’ve also learned that cuteness has zero to do with the mechanics of survival in the wild. While the tapir exhibited one strategy for hiding, there are myriad ways to overcome the vulnerability of youth. As I see it, if you’re a youngster in this dog-eat-dog world, you have three main methods to make it: You can blend in, take off, or let your parents defend you.\n\nHiding makes a lot of sense for many animals. Shorebirds often scrape a simple depression in gravel or sand, then lay eggs that blend right in. Once hatched, their chicks are nearly as speckled and are camouflaged too. You literally can have a nest between your feet and miss it. Aquatic invertebrates can vanish under rocks on the floor of a streambed. Young geckos blend perfectly into the moss on a tree.\n\nRunning off is another option. Ungulates like wildebeests and zebras go from newborn to walking in minutes. Precocial birds from ostriches to prairie chickens hatch, dry, and are ready to follow Mom soon after. She’ll teach them what to eat, how to shelter from storms, and how to escape from the bad guys.",

        "content": "On winter evenings throughout much of Europe and North America, an hour before sunset, thousands of starlings gather in the skies. Before descending to their nighttime roosts, the birds put on one of nature’s most spectacular displays. They pulse, ripple, and wheel as if they were a single entity—an amorphous, shape-shifting creature with the delicate beauty of calligraphic brushstrokes and the erratic chaos of flickering flames.\n\nHow could so many birds be so tightly coordinated? That’s a mystery that researchers have sought to solve for more than a century. In 1931, the ornithologist Edmund Selous argued that a starling murmuration, which he described as “a madness in the sky,” could only arise through telepathy. The birds “must think collectively, all at the same time,” he wrote. Like many others, Selous assumed that complex behavior must have equally complex origins. But in the 1980s, programmers and physicists started showing otherwise. They created computer models in which virtual individuals interacted according to deceptively simple rules but nonetheless moved in ways that resembled coordinated flocks. These simulations were compelling, but researchers lacked good data on actual flocks to compare them against. Then, in 2005, a team led by married physicists Andrea Cavagna and Irene Giardina in Rome took a giant leap forward. Over many chilly evenings across three years, they climbed to the rooftop of the Palazzo Massimo to photograph the city’s especially epic murmurations with pairs of cameras. Using these images, they reconstructed the 3D position of each individual in murmurations that included more than 4,000 members.\n\n(Starling murmurations are dazzling, ubiquitous, and puzzling.)",

Be careful not to look into the sun when observing Mercury, especially through binoculars or a telescope.\n\nLyrid meteor shower—April 21–22\n\nThe Lyrid meteor shower is expected to peak between April 21 and 22, allowing one to spot up to 18 meteors per hour under ideal conditions. The shower runs from April 17 to 26, but this two-night window is the best time to catch the show.

        "source": "https://news.nationalgeographic.com/",
        "content": "Luigi Frizzo was warned that the property he was about to lease could be in a flood zone because of its proximity to the water and rising sea levels in Venice, Italy. It actually sparked his decision to name his bookstore Acqua Alta (High Tide).\n\nIn addition to coming up with his bookshop's name, Frizzo also took proactive steps to create a flood-proof infrastructure plan to protect more than 400,000 books, including first editions published more than a century ago. He decided to store hundreds of books in bathtubs and gondolas, long row boats that have provided transportation through Venice's narrow canals since the 11th century.\n\nIn case you didn't know, Acqua Alta is located less than a mile north of Piazza San Marco, the principal public square in Venice. It's easily flooded because it is one of the lowest areas in the city, but it's only a nine-minute walk from the piazza to the famous bookstore. Visitors arrive via Calle Lunga Santa Maria Formosa (in the Castello neighborhood), a narrow street where a billboard proclaims Libreria Acqua Alta is “the most beautiful bookshop in the world.”\n\nAs Venice recorded its worst flooding since 1966, Libreria Acqua Alta lost hundreds of books and thousands of euros in damage. But its owner, Luigi Frizzo, had a rescue plan: Venice’s famous gondolas would be used to protect his books from future floods. Photograph by Justine Kibler\n\nVisitors to Acqua Alta can see firsthand the innovative infrastructure upgrades the bookstore had to implement after the flood in 2019, one of the worst floods in in Venice's history. Water levels reached more than six feet above average sea level.\n\nToday, gondolas and bathtubs were put on top of large wooden tables to shield the bookstore’s precious goods from the threat of rising water levels. While they were initially preventative measures, the gondolas became an emblematic feature for millions, making Libreria Acqua Alta arguably one of the most famous bookstores in the world. Its staircase, for example, is among the most photographed spots in all of Venice.\n\n“The staircase was created to store encyclopedias. I had already papered the courtyard, where two walled-up windows could not be reopened and I started to move the encyclopedias into the garden, where I then began what would later become the staircase,” said Frizzo, the 82-year-old bookshop owner who was born in Trissino, a small town in the Veneto region of northern Italy.\n\nHe added, “I would never have imagined that what I considered a simple practical solution would have had so much success.”\n\n(Related: Free things to do in Venice.)\n\nBibliophiles will find more than 5,000 books at Libreria Acqua Alta, and some are found in stacks sitting outside of the TikTok-famous bookshop. Photograph by Bettina Strenske, Alamy Stock Photo\n\nI saw it on TikTok!\n\nIn 2002, Libreria Acqua Alta opened as a gathering place for locals to enjoy an eclectic selection of books that spanned from Venetian Art and the storied history of the Republic of Venice to novels and comics inspired by the city.\n\nThe bookstore is also home to secondhand books such as the first edition of Le Fiale, a collection of poems written by Italian poet Corrado Govoni. This rare find—hidden from the gaze of the patrons— was published in 1903 in Florence and costs 1,500 euros ($1,619 USD) today.\n\nMuch like many European cities, Venice didn’t escape the increasing number of visitors fueled by its growing popularity on social media platforms like Instagram and TikTok. Acqua Alta benefited from the social media phenomenon and can be seen in thousands of vertical videos on TikTok and hashtags on Instagram posts used over 50,000 times.\n\nDominique, the resident black cat at Libreria Acqua Alta, offers a pensive star as she watches tourists pass through the bookstore. Photograph by Jacky Chapman, Alamy Stock Photo\n\nAt the entrance, where a billboard proclaimed Acqua Alta as \"the most beautiful bookshop in the world,\" visitors form a line and move ahead slowly and intermittently, passing by a large gondola located in the heart of the building, abandoned bathtubs filled with magazines, piles of rare and seemingly old books, and crossing paths with the resident black cat, Dominique.\n\nMost guests to the popular bookstore join dozens of others on a pilgrimage to head to the terrace, where they must wait their turn to climb up the staircase for the long sought-after social media snapshot with a view of the River Tetta.\n\nWhile the city of Venice strives to curb overtourism and day-trippers by charging an entry fee, Acqua Alta continues to welcome the crowds while adopting some organizational rules, according to Diana Zanda, a supervisor at Acqua Alta since 2023.\n\n“We ask groups of 10 or more people to call us in advance,” says Zanda. “As for the staircase, we had to assign a bookstore employee to advise visitors that they only have a few minutes to take a photo, which helps to keep the line moving along.” She says the bookstore welcomes between 2,000 and 5,000 people on a busy day.\n\n“Most of the visitors are tourists who come because they saw something on Instagram or they saw someone who created a video about us on TikTok,” adds Zanda. A female patron interrupts, “Yes, I saw it on TikTok!”\n\n(Related: A look at Europe’s tourist taxes—have they helped curb overcrowding?)\n\nLiberia Acqua Alta welcomes thousands of people every day who ascend this famous makeshift staircase made of books to pose for the perfect photo to post on social media. Photograph by Cristi Croitoru, Alamy Stock Photo\n\nBookshops are tourist attractions\n\nJorge Carrión is the author of Bookshops, a book that explores the significance of bookstores as cultural and intellectural spaces as well as their role in communities. Carrión believes that since 2013, places like Acqua Alta are no longer just bookshops, but they have evolved into popular tourist destinations.\n\n“Cultural tourism, like all tourism, began to change in 2010 with the emergence of Instagram. At that time, a new type of tourist attraction began to exist, one that went viral and that encouraged the circulation of your selfie and TikTok has only amplified this trend,” says Carrión.\n\nAn old, unused gondola sits at the rear of Libreria Acqua Alta bookshop on the Rio della Tetta canal in the Sestiere Castello of Venice.

They aren’t the best, but they are the most photogenic.”\n\nSo, how does Acqua Alta manage to survive economically at a time when visitors are increasingly more interested in taking selfies with books in unique shops, instead of buying them?\n\nMany visitors buy bookmarks, postcards, calendars, and magnets as souvenirs, but selling secondhand books, out-of-print editions and other rare finds also helps keep the TikTok-famous bookshop afloat.\n\n(Related: These are the must-see sights of Italy's Veneto region.)",

But even paradise needs protection — the archipelago faces significant threats from climate change, ranging from rising sea levels encroaching on low-lying habitats to coral bleaching damaging the reefs that sustain marine life and shield shorelines from erosion.\n\nThat’s why hotels across Fiji are inviting guests to be part of the solution, making conservation a hands-on part of the travel experience. Across the country, resorts have launched sustainability programs aimed at guests keen on making a real impact — like planting mangroves to fortify coastlines, working alongside marine biologists to regenerate coral reefs, and rolling up their sleeves for beach clean-ups and restoration projects. And the momentum is only growing. On April 7, Tourism Fiji will launch Loloma Hour — a new initiative rooted in the local concept of loloma, meaning to act with generosity, driven by love — designed to inspire travelers to give back to the environment during their stay.\n\nTurtle Island's 5-acre garden supplies the resort with fresh vegetables, herbs, and fruit. Photographs by Turtle Island Fiji\n\nHere’s where to go to experience Fiji at its most breathtaking—and most meaningful.\n\nSitting in the heart of the Great Astrolabe Reef — the fourth most extensive reef system in the world — this ultra-luxurious retreat features villas equipped with breezy living areas, kitchenettes stocked with local fruit juices and chocolate-enrobed honeycomb, and a soaking tub in the primary bedroom, as well as a yard decked out with an infinity pool, sun-drenched patios, and swaying hammocks strung between coconut palms.\n\nBeyond the plush comforts, Kokomo is deeply committed to conservation , and its most unique initiative invites guests to play a role in protecting the resident manta rays — endangered gentle giants with an average wingspan of over 18 feet. During snorkeling excursions, guests can photograph the creatures, capturing the fingerprint-like spot patterns on the bellies. When uploaded to a database, those photos allow scientists to track the movement of the rays, which helps with monitoring and protecting the fish's habitats.\n\n(Related: Why 'White Lotus' fans should skip Thailand and travel to this island instead)\n\nWith pearlescent beaches, a jungle spa, and a lineup of water-based adventures, deciding how to spend the day at Six Senses Fiji is no easy task. But after sunset, we'd argue the activity has to be joining the sustainability team to track Fijian Crested Iguanas.\n\nOnce thought extinct on the island, more than 40 of these rare, mint-green reptiles now call the property home. At night, their scales reflect torchlight, making them easier to spot. Monitoring their population is essential — not just to count their numbers but also to assess their health, behavior, and breeding patterns. With that data, scientists can make informed decisions about habitat restoration and other strategies to ensure the species’ survival.\n\nWith soaring thatched ceilings and intricate hand-carved woodwork, each of the residences, suites, and villas at Nanuku Resort spotlight Fijian craftsmanship, while floor-to-ceiling windows frame with ocean views fringed by wax palms and bird of paradise flowers.\n\nAt the heart of the resort, the open-air lobby and restaurant area serve as both a gathering place and a hub for conservation. Just off to the side, you’ll find Nanuku’s mangrove nursery — an incubator for one of nature’s most powerful carbon-sequestering trees . The tidal tree’s root systems create habitats for baby fish and are essential for stabilizing coastlines, buffering against erosion from the pounding of waves and currents. Once the seedlings have grown enough, guests are invited to take part in replanting the young trees along the Serua coast. So far, Nanuku’s team has successfully transplanted more than 15,000 mangrove trees.\n\n(Related: Saving our shores: coastal conservation projects making positive change)\n\nSet along the powdery sands of Natadola Bay, InterContinental Fiji Golf Resort & Spa is a sprawling complex with a slew of suites and villas, multiple specialty restaurants and bars, a full-service spa, and a lively kids’ club. But beyond the indulgent amenities, one of the resort’s most dazzling features lies just offshore — a thriving house reef bursting with kaleidoscopic marine life (Fiji is home to more than 1,200 varieties of tropical fish, 75 types of sharks and rays, and five of the world’s seven marine turtle species).\n\nPart of the reason the underwater ecosystem is doing so well is because staff and guests are actively gardening it. Travelers can play a direct role in reef restoration by collecting small, living coral fragments — often broken pieces that would otherwise tumble across the ocean floor — and carefully securing them to specially designed coral frames or reef structures. These stable foundations allow the coral to regenerate, helping expand the reef and ensuring that the vibrant marine ecosystem continues flourishing.\n\n(Related: 7 luxurious hotels you can feel good about checking into)\n\nEncircled by eight world-class breaks — including the legendary Cloudbreak, one of the most iconic barrel waves on the planet — Tavarua Island Resort is a dream destination for surfers. But this heart-shaped private island isn’t just for those chasing the perfect wave. It offers beachfront bures (traditional Fijian wood-and-straw accommodations), a restaurant focusing on ocean-to-table dining, and spectacular snorkeling and scuba diving — made even more special by Tavarua’s groundbreaking giant clam conservation program.\n\nAcross the Pacific, these reef dwellers have been over-harvested, putting delicate marine ecosystems at risk (they are a keystone species, after all). But here, marine biologists are working to turn the tide with an on-land hatchery where juvenile clams are tended to until they’re strong enough to be transplanted — first to a protected lagoon, then onto the surrounding reefs and beyond. Guests can help by hand-cleaning the clams of invasive snails and the larvae that might otherwise devastate the population between moves while learning about their lifecycle, their predators, and the vital role they play in maintaining reef health.\n\nSprawling 500 acres, yet hosting just 14 couples at a time, Turtle Island’s intimate atmosphere makes it popular for honeymooners (here, they get their own secluded beachfront bure and can reserve an entire private beach for the day).\n\nBut it’s not just a retreat for romance — it’s also a refuge for endangered green and hawksbill turtles. Each year, the animals return to lay their nest on the shores or their namesake island. By partnering with marine biologists, guests can help monitor the vulnerable nesting sites and safeguard hatchlings as part of the conservation efforts. Visitors can even assist in tagging rescued, full-grown turtles before releasing them back into the ocean.\n\n(Related: How playing Aquaman helped turn Jason Momoa into an ocean advocate)",

        "title": "Bertie Gregory’s filmmaking offers a front-row ticket to wildlife in action",
        "source": "https://news.nationalgeographic.com/",
        "content": "It’s far from his first time filming in extreme conditions, with eight Antarctic expeditions under his belt. In 2021, he led a team to Antarctica’s Elephant Island. The remote location, infamous for the Endurance’s tragic fate , was rumored to host a massive gathering of fin whales . The species was decimated during the whaling era, but Gregory and his team uncovered a story of possibility.\n\nAfter six weeks of brutal weather — with only six days suitable for filming (even calm days saw 25-knot winds) — they documented an unprecedented sight: 300 fin whales , the largest gathering ever filmed, feeding on krill within a few football fields expanse. “This particular day, all I could see on the horizon were just hundreds of cannons going off. It looked like an old sea battle, and it was the 20-foot-high blows of the whales,” Gregory recalls.\n\n“Towering blows that were backlit by the rising sun. The horizon was just like party poppers.”\n\nThe resurgence is a testament to the 1980s whaling moratorium, explains Gregory, and offers a rare story of hope. New science has underscored whales’ vital role in carbon sequestration , with a single whale equaling 30,000 trees.\n\n“It’s perfectly possible that some of the whales I was diving with were alive when our species was trying to hunt them to extinction,” says Gregory. “Everywhere wildlife is on the back foot but with these fin whales it’s one of the only places in the world where it hasn’t been better in 100 years. The sighting was caught on camera for National Geographic’s “ Epic Adventures with Bertie Gregory .”\n\nWildlife will come back on an unbelievable scale if you give it the chance, and that’s great news for wildlife and great news for us as well.\n\nGregory is clear on his perspective about facing danger in his work: “It’s not about being reckless or an adrenaline junkie, it’s just about expanding your comfort zone.” Yes, he’s dived alongside one of the biggest schools of hammerhead sharks ever recorded, and stood feet away from packs of wolves , but it’s not the animals he’s worried about.\n\n“On a shoot the most dangerous species we encounter is always humans. Whether directly dangerous or a human misinterpreting wild animal behavior and putting us and the animal in a difficult situation. You’ve got to be so unlucky to have an unsolicited attack by a wild animal.”\n\n“Controlled suffering” is how he describes wildlife filmmaking. “You just need to be good at being cold and miserable,” and he emphasizes the value of failure. “The failures are just as important as the successes. Sometimes we just fail and we make a show about that.”\n\nThis resilience, he believes, was partly honed through his family’s love of water sports. “I think when you spend the amount of time I did bobbing up and down on a surfboard off the coast of Cornwall, being cold and having waves break on your head, you gain an appreciation for the outdoors.”\n\nEarly photography eventually led Gregory to National Geographic photographer Steve Winter, who offered him an assistant role. At 20, Gregory joined Winter documenting leopards in South Africa, Mumbai and Sri Lanka which resulted in a Nat Geo WILD special .\n\nNational Geographic Explorer Steve Winter is pictured on assignment with assistant Bertie Gregory at Yala National Park, Sri Lanka. Photograph courtesy Steve Winter/National Geographic\n\nGregory recalls that at the time, Winter flashed his iconic photo of a mountain lion in front of the Hollywood sign to him one night, before it was published. It further fueled his interest in urban wildlife, particularly the peregrine falcon, his favorite animal.\n\nHe sees the potential of urban wildlife as a way to reconnect people with nature. “I discovered that if you look hard enough, you can have a wildlife experience in a city that’s just as wild as anywhere else.”\n\nIn 2015, Gregory became an Explorer. His 16-part online wildlife series, National Geographic’s first-ever of its kind, documented elusive coastal wolves of Vancouver Island. He went on to work for the BBC’s Natural History Unit, shooting for David Attenborough’s “Seven Worlds, One Planet,” and later returned to produce and host subsequent seasons of the online series before developing the streaming shows “Epic Adventures with Bertie Gregory,” and “ Animals up Close with Bertie Gregory .”\n\nThe award-winning filmmaker is motivated by storytelling’s conservation impact. His drone imagery of bats and their habitat loss in Zambia’s Kasanka National Park, for example, was used in courts to push back against destructive agriculture projects.\n\n“One thing I’m really keen on now is making sure that every project, in addition to contributing towards the general public’s appreciation for nature and their awareness of environmental issues, also has some quantifiable impact alongside that,” says Gregory.\n\nHe hopes his work entertains and inspires, encouraging viewers to engage with and protect nature.\n\n“Wildlife will come back on an unbelievable scale if you give it the chance, and that’s great news for wildlife and great news for us as well.”\n\nABOUT THE WRITER\n\nFor the National Geographic Society: Natalie Hutchison is a Digital Content Producer for the Society.

        "title": "Inside Amazon’s Race to Beat OpenAI’s ‘Stargate’ Project",
        "source": "https://time.com/",
        "content": "Rami Sinno is crouched beside a filing cabinet, wrestling a beach-ball sized disc out of a box, when a dull thump echoes around his laboratory. “I just dropped tens of thousands of dollars’ worth of material,” he says with a laugh. Straightening up, Sinno reveals the goods: a golden silicon wafer, which glitters in the fluorescent light of the lab. This circular platter is divided into some 100 rectangular tiles, each of which contains billions of microscopic electrical switches. These are the brains of Amazon’s most advanced chip yet: the Trainium 2, announced in December.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nFor years, artificial intelligence firms have been dependent on one company, Nvidia, to design the cutting-edge chips required to train the world’s most powerful AI models. But as the AI race heats up, cloud giants like Amazon and Google have accelerated their in-house efforts to design their own chips, in pursuit of market share in the rapidly-growing cloud computing industry, which was valued at $900 billion at the beginning of 2025. This unassuming Austin, Texas, laboratory is where Amazon is mounting its bid for semiconductor supremacy. Sinno is a key player. He’s the director of engineering at Annapurna Labs, the chip design subsidiary of Amazon’s cloud computing arm, Amazon Web Services (AWS). After donning ear protection and swiping his card to enter a secure room, Sinno proudly displays a set of finished Trainium 2s, which he helped design, operating the way they normally would in a datacenter. He must shout to be heard over the cacophony of whirring fans that whisk hot air, warmed by these chips’ insatiable demand for energy, into the building’s air conditioning system. Each chip can fit easily into the palm of Sinno’s hand, but the computational infrastructure that surrounds them—motherboards, memory, data cables, fans, heatsinks, transistors, power-supplies—means this rack of just 64 chips towers over him, drowning out his voice.\n\nLarge as this unit may be, it’s only a miniaturized simulacrum of the chips’ natural habitat. Soon thousands of these fridge-sized supercomputers will be wheeled into several undisclosed locations in the U.S. and connected together to form “Project Rainier”—one of the largest datacenter clusters ever built anywhere in the world, named after the giant mountain that looms over Amazon’s Seattle headquarters. Project Rainier is Amazon’s answer to OpenAI and Microsoft’s $100 billion “Stargate” project, announced by President Trump at the White House in January. Meta and Google are also currently building similar so-called “hyperscaler” datacenters, costing tens of billions of dollars apiece, to train their next generation of powerful AI models. Big tech companies have spent the last decade amassing huge piles of cash; now they're all spending it in a race to build the gargantuan physical infrastructure necessary to create AI systems that, they believe, will fundamentally change the world. Computational infrastructure of this scale has never been seen before in human history.\n\nThe precise number of chips involved in Project Rainier, the total cost of its datacenters, and their locations are all closely-held secrets. (Although Amazon won’t comment on the cost of Rainier by itself, the company has indicated it expects to invest some $100 billion in 2025, with the majority going toward AWS.) The sense of competition is fierce. Amazon claims the finished Project Rainier will be “the world’s largest AI compute cluster”—bigger, the implication is, than even Stargate. Employees here resort to fighting talk in response to questions about the challenge from the likes of OpenAI. “Stargate is easy to announce,” says Gadi Hutt, Annapurna’s director of product. “Let’s see it implemented first.” Amazon is building Project Rainier specifically for one client: the AI company Anthropic, which has agreed to a long lease on the massive datacenters. (How long? That’s classified, too.) There, on hundreds of thousands of Trainium 2 chips, Anthropic plans to train the successors to its popular Claude family of AI models. The chips inside Rainier will collectively be five times more powerful than the systems that were used to the best of those models. “It’s way, way, way bigger,” Tom Brown, an Anthropic co-founder, tells TIME.\n\nNobody knows what the results of that huge jump in computational firepower will be. Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei has publicly predicted that “powerful AI” (the term he prefers over Artificial General Intelligence—a technology that can perform most tasks better and more quickly than human experts) could arrive as early as 2026. That means Anthropic believes there’s a strong possibility that Project Rainier, or one of its competitors, will be the place where AGI is birthed.\n\nThe flywheel effect Anthropic isn’t just a customer of Amazon; it’s also partially owned by the tech giant. Amazon has invested $8 billion in Anthropic for a minority stake in the company. Much of that money, in a weirdly circular way, will end up being spent on AWS datacenter rental costs. This strange relationship reveals an interesting facet of the forces driving the AI industry: Amazon is essentially using Anthropic as a proof-of-concept for its AI datacenter business.\n\nIt’s a similar dynamic to Microsoft’s relationship with OpenAI and Google’s relationship with its DeepMind subsidiary. “Having a frontier lab on your cloud is a way to make your cloud better,” says Brown, the Anthropic co-founder who manages the company’s relationship with Amazon. He compares it to AWS’s partnership with Netflix: in the early 2010s, the streamer was one of the first big AWS customers. Because of the huge infrastructural challenge of delivering fast video to users all over the world, “it meant that AWS got all the feedback that they needed in order to make all of the different systems work at that scale,” Brown says. “They paved the way for the whole cloud industry.” All cloud providers are now trying to replicate that pattern in the AI era, Brown says. “They want someone who will go through the jungle and use a machete to chop a path, because nobody has been down that path before. But once you do it, there’s a nice path, and everyone can follow you.” By investing in Anthropic, which then spends most of that money on AWS, Amazon creates what it likes to call a flywheel: a self-reinforcing process that helps it build more advanced chips and datacenters, drives down the cost of the “compute” required to run AI systems, and shows other companies the benefits of AI, which in turn results in more customers for AWS in the long run. Startups like OpenAI and Anthropic get the glory, but the real winners are the big tech companies who run the world’s major cloud platforms.\n\nTo be sure, Amazon is still heavily reliant on Nvidia chips. Meanwhile, Google’s custom chips, known as TPUs, are considered by many in the industry to be superior to Amazon’s. And Amazon isn’t the only big tech company with a stake in Anthropic. Google has also invested some $3 billion for a 14% stake. Anthropic uses both Google and Amazon clouds in a bid to be reliant on neither. Despite all this, Project Rainier and the Trainium 2 chips that will fill its datacenters are the culmination of Amazon’s effort to accelerate its flywheel into pole position. Trainium 2 chips, Sinno says, were designed with the help of intense feedback from Anthropic, which shared details with AWS about how its software interacted with Trainium 1 hardware, and made suggestions for how the next generation of chips could be improved. Such tight collaboration isn’t typical for AWS clients, Sinno says, but is necessary for Anthropic to compete in the cutthroat world of “frontier” AI. The capabilities of a model are essentially correlated with the amount of compute spent to train and run it, so the more compute you can get for your buck, the better your final AI will be. “At the scale that they're running, each point of a percent improvement in performance is of huge value,” Sinno says of Anthropic. “The better they can utilize the infrastructure, the better the return on investment for them is, as a customer.”\n\nThe more sophisticated Amazon’s in-house chips become, the less it will need to rely on industry leader Nvidia—demand for whose chips far outstrips supply, meaning Nvidia can pick and choose its customers while charging well above production costs. But there’s another dynamic at play, too, that Annapurna employees hope might give Amazon a long-term structural advantage. Nvidia sells physical chips (known as GPUs) directly to customers, meaning that each GPU has to be optimized to run on its own. Amazon, meanwhile, doesn’t sell its Trainium chips. It simply sells access to them, running in AWS-operated datacenters. This means Amazon can find efficiencies that Nvidia would find difficult to replicate. “We have many more degrees of freedom,” Hutt says.\n\nBack in the lab, Sinno returns the silicon wafer to its box and moves to another part of the room, gesturing at the various stages of the design process for chips that might—potentially very soon—help summon powerful new AIs into existence. He is excitedly reeling off statistics about the Trainium 3, expected later this year, which he says will be twice the speed and 40% more energy-efficient than its predecessor. Neural networks running on Trainium 2s assisted with the team’s design of the upcoming chip, he says. That’s an indication of how AI is already accelerating the speed of its own development, in a process that is getting faster and faster. “It’s a flywheel,” Sinno says. “Absolutely.”",

        "title": "The Rising Demand For Electricity Is About More than AI",
        "source": "https://time.com/",
        "content": "How much will AI drive up power demand in the next few years? That’s been the big question at the center of the energy and climate conversation recently. Many analysts have warned that AI-driven electricity usage is expected to more than double in the next five years as consumers and businesses find varied applications for the technology. But others urge caution: not all data centers in the planning process will ultimately be built and AI could become much more energy efficient than it is today.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nThis is a crucial debate—but the full picture is even more complicated. Even if AI guzzles less energy than the zeitgeist suggests, a wide range of electricity demand drivers lurk just around the corner. A report released earlier this week from the International Energy Agency (IEA) gives a sense of the picture: global electricity demand grew by 4.3% last year due to a range of causes that include not just data centers but also electrification of everything from building heating to cooking, along with more air conditioning thanks to record high temperatures, among other things. “We see one very clear trend: electricity growth,” says Fatih Birol, the IEA’s executive director. Widening the aperture of the conversation around future power demand can help prevent us from fixating on a single technology (however transformative it might be), and avoid the risk of overlooking the complex interplay of factors that will shape our energy future—and the challenges and opportunities that will arise from it.\n\nTo understand the nature of electricity demand growth, it’s helpful to break it down by geography. And there’s no better place to start than in emerging markets and developing countries. Electricity demand ticked up 7% in China and by more than 4% in other emerging and developing economies; meanwhile, electricity consumption in the European Union grew by about 1.5%, according to the IEA. Some of that growth is the simple product of expanding economies. More wealth means more electricity use. But a significant portion of the rising demand came from high temperatures—particularly heat waves in India and China—that pushed consumers and businesses to crank up air conditioning. Electricity usage also grew in the U.S. by about 2% last year, according to government data. Unsurprisingly, the most significant source of that growth was new data centers, but other factors contributed, too. Federal programs enacted during the Biden Administration, like the Inflation Reduction Act, have helped boost the country’s advanced manufacturing footprint. That means a wave of new facilities drawing electricity in previously unoccupied land or revitalized vacant facilities. Moreover, today’s manufacturing plants rely more on electricity than they would have a generation ago, when they might have onsite power from fossil fuels.\n\nAnd then there are electric vehicles. Headlines would have you believe that EVs now face an insurmountable challenge in the U.S. market as people aren’t buying as many as expected. That may be true, but the IEA reports that sales actually continued to grow in the U.S. at greater than a 10% clip. In the coming years, increased EV penetration inevitably means greater power demand. There are a few lessons to draw from this story. For one, if you’re betting on an AI-efficiency breakthrough to save the world from an electricity crunch, you’re missing the bigger picture. Yes, we know a range of developments, like more energy efficient language models, could reduce AI’s future electricity demand, but that won’t address all of the other sources of demand. There are also some positive elements that emerge from this story. Most obviously, the IEA says that 80% of new electricity generation globally last year came from renewable energy or nuclear power. That dynamic means that emissions grew at a slower pace than the economy. “If we want to find the silver lining, we see that there is a continuous decoupling of economic growth from emissions growth,” says Birol.\n\nThat’s small consolation at a time when emissions need to not just slow down but actually decline in order to avoid some of the worst effects of climate change. But I see another opportunity that could emerge from this imminent power crunch: we may be forced to finally confront the full range of solutions available to us. Yes, power companies are eagerly trying to build natural gas to meet demand. But they’re building solar power and battery storage, too. And because neither will be enough, companies have rediscovered the value of nuclear power. In these circumstances, demand-reducing technologies like smart grids and demand response are already taking on newfound importance and companies are incentivized to find more energy efficient ways to run their business. That importance should only grow.\n\nTo get this story in your inbox, subscribe to the TIME CO2 Leadership Report newsletter here.",

        "source": "https://time.com/",
        "content": "The Trump Administration is withholding millions of dollars allocated for family planning services from more than a dozen organizations. Enacted in 1970, the federal family planning program known as Title X makes millions of dollars available to clinics that provide health care services like birth control, cancer screenings, and STI testing for people from low-income households. On March 31, Planned Parenthood—one of the largest Title X providers—said in a press release that nine of its affiliates received notices from the federal government that their Title X funding would be withheld starting April 1.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAccording to Planned Parenthood, more than three-quarters of its affiliates receive Title X funding, and in 2023, there were more than 1.5 million visits to Planned Parenthood health centers that received Title X funding. One of the nine affiliates affected is Planned Parenthood Great Northwest, Hawai’i, Alaska, Indiana, Kentucky (PPGNHAIK), which serves those four states as well as Idaho and western Washington. Its CEO, Rebecca Gibron, estimates that, as a result of the freeze, about $3 million a year will now be withheld from five of the six states PPGNHAIK serves: Idaho, Indiana, Kentucky, Alaska, and Hawaii. Gibron says that over half of PPGNHAIK’s health centers across six states serve more than 40,000 patients a year through Title X. “In our states, we are a safety net provider providing affordable birth control, cancer screenings, STI testing, and treatment,” Gibron says. “These patients rely on Title X for their health care, and without this program, patients may have no access to this care at all.” Planned Parenthood Action Fund President and CEO Alexis McGill Johnson said in a press release that if people aren’t able to access this care, cancers could go undetected, access to birth control could be reduced, and sexually transmitted infections could increase.\n\nA spokesperson for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) told TIME in an email that the department is withholding Title X funds from 16 organizations “pending an evaluation of possible violations of their grant terms, including based on Federal civil rights laws and the President’s Executive Order 14218, ‘Ending Taxpayer Subsidization of Open Borders,’” which Trump signed on Feb. 19. The Executive Order declares that undocumented immigrants are prohibited “from obtaining most taxpayer-funded benefits.” “HHS is conducting this evaluation to ensure these entities are in full compliance with Federal law and applicable grant terms, and to ensure responsible stewardship of taxpayer dollars,” the spokesperson said. They did not respond to questions about the details of the “possible violations,” how much money was being withheld from the affected organizations, and which organizations were being impacted by the funding freeze.\n\nOn March 25, the Wall Street Journal reported that HHS was considering freezing $27.5 million out of the more than $200 million allocated for Title X’s annual budget. Gibron calls the withholding of funds \"politically motivated.” She accuses the Trump Administration of wanting to “shut down Planned Parenthood health centers to appease their anti-abortion backers,” saying that the Title X freeze is the “latest attempt” by the Administration to defund Planned Parenthood. “The fact is that Planned Parenthood health centers across the country serve millions of patients every year, regardless of their immigration status, political affiliation, race, or gender—everyone is welcome in a Planned Parenthood health center,” Gibron says. “Access to fundamental reproductive and sexual health services is health care that everyone needs.” In 2019, during the first Trump Administration, the federal government implemented a new restriction on Title X recipients, barring them from providing abortion referrals (Title X dollars don’t fund abortion services). The Guttmacher Institute, which researches and supports sexual and reproductive health and rights, found that that the restriction—often referred to as the“domestic gag rule”—combined with the COVID-19 pandemic, led to the loss of 981 health care centers from the Title X program and resulted in about 2.4 million fewer patients receiving care through the federal program in 2020 compared with 2018. The Biden Administration rescinded the domestic gag rule in 2021.\n\nRead More: South Carolina Wants to End Medicaid for Planned Parenthood Essential Access Health, which distributes Title X funds to clinics in California and Hawaii, said in a press release shared with TIME that it also received a notice that its Title X funds were being temporarily withheld while the group responds to “an inquiry regarding compliance with federal policy and practices related to civil rights and Executive Orders focused on DEI activities within 10 days.” The day he took office, Trump signed an Executive Order aimed at dismantling diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) efforts. “This unprecedented, arbitrary, and immediate pause in distribution of critical resources is harmful to patients and providers,” Essential Access Health said in a press release shared with TIME. “Any funding delay is detrimental, and an extended delay would devastate our family planning safety net.” Reproductive rights experts have condemned the Trump Administration’s move to freeze Title X funds. Amy Friedrich-Karnik, director of federal policy at the Guttmacher Institute, says she wasn’t shocked by the move, but that it is “absolutely devastating.” According to Friedrich-Karnik, early estimates from Guttmacher Institute experts indicate that between 600,000 and 1.25 million people could be impacted by this funding freeze annually, based on the most recently available data on Title X from 2023.\n\n“The impact of that program on people’s access to needed reproductive health care services is so clear—how people have benefitted from that access and how it is a program that fills a very important gap for folks who can’t get health care elsewhere,\" Friedrich-Karnik says. “Not only are reproductive health care services like contraception, STI testing, cancer screenings at risk, [but] for many people, this is their only touchpoint with the health care system at all.” According to data from the HHS Office of Population Affairs, about 83% of patients who received care from clinics that received Title X funding in 2023 had family incomes at or below 250% of the federal poverty level. Friedrich-Karnik says data also shows that people of color are disproportionately likely to access Title X services. She calls the freeze “a direct attack on health equity,” adding that Title X was established “to ensure that historically underserved communities were able to access health care and reproductive health care,” and the Trump Administration’s actions are penalizing Title X recipients “for doing exactly what the program is set up to do.”\n\nFriedrich-Karnik says that the freeze is “definitely an attack” on people from low-income households, “who already have the most barriers to accessing health care services.”",

        "source": "https://time.com/",
        "content": "Donald Trump has called tariffs the “most beautiful word” in the dictionary. He’s said they will make Americans “rich” and restructure the economy for the better. Standing in the Rose Garden on Wednesday, with political and business leaders around the world watching closely, Trump bet his faith in tariffs against the hard reality of economics as he launched what is expected to be one of the single largest increases in U.S. trade barriers in a century.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nTrump announced he was signing an executive order “instituting reciprocal tariffs on countries throughout the world. Reciprocal—that means they do it to us and we do it to them.” In practice, the White House said that will translate into a new 10 percent tariff on all imported goods, and additional import taxes on 60 other countries. Those additional tariffs vary and were determined by looking at the rules in those countries around U.S. exports, according to the White House. Trump’s new tariff regime will be on top of various tariffs the U.S. already has in place, and ones Trump had already set in motion targeting imports of cars, steel and aluminum. The reciprocal tariffs would go into effect Thursday, he said. Speaking to staff, cabinet secretaries and reporters gathered outside the West Wing, Trump gave a rambling and sometimes contradictory explanation of his tariff plan. He said that his administration would calculate what a country charges the U.S. imports through tariffs, “non-monetary barriers and other forms of cheating” and would charge the country half of that in a flat rate. The new tariffs were not a “full reciprocal,” he said. “I would like to have done that.”\n\nReading from a large chart, he said goods coming from China, for example, would be charged a duty of 34%, goods from the European Union would carry a 20% tariff, Vietnam would have 35% and Taiwan 32%. An eight-page chart handed out to reporters in the Rose Garden listed 60 countries as being charged rates above the baseline of 10%. Trump had previously announced a separate 25% tariff on all auto imports that is slated to kick in on April 3. He’s imposed 20% tariffs on all imports coming from China and put in place 25% duties on steel and aluminum. He had previously delayed 25% tariffs on goods from Mexico and Canada over his accusation that those countries weren’t doing enough to stop fentanyl from coming to the U.S. That delayed tariff kicks in Wednesday and will be stacked on top of the new sweeping tariffs Trump announced. Trump has called the day of his announcement “Liberation Day” and billed it as a moment he is remaking the American economy. He promised that income from the new tariffs would reduce taxes and pay down U.S. debt.\n\nAmerican businesses have struggled in recent weeks to plan ahead as Trump’s tariff threats have injected so much uncertainty into their supply chains. Stock indices have dipped. Expectations of inflation have soared. Investors are rattled. Last month, JPMorgan Chase lowered its prediction for GDP growth by 0.3% because of the uncertainty around Trump’s trade policy. Leading economists say the costs of tariffs are mostly passed on to consumers. On the campaign trail last year, Trump often disputed that. More recently, he has said Americans will have to brace for some temporary economic pain in order to strengthen the U.S. economy over the longer term. But he didn’t mention that on Wednesday. Trump's announcement will test his support among Republicans in Congress—all of whom will be hearing about the fallout from their constituents. Iowa Sen. Chuck Grassley expressed concerns about how the new tariffs will impact farmers in his state. As an example of the ripple effect, he pointed to potash, a fertilizer from Canada that is essential for soybean production. “If that goes up by 25% that's going to hurt the family farm already not making money,” he tells TIME.\n\n—WITH REPORTING BY NIK POPLI",

        "source": "https://time.com/",
        "content": "Since President Donald Trump has returned to the Oval Office, Social Security—a program which sends retirement and disability benefits to over 70 million people—has been the subject of many conversations. Although Trump initially assured voters that Social Security wouldn’t be touched, there have since been reports of potential staff and office cuts spearheaded by the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). A new policy by the Social Security Administration (SSA) was announced on March 18, with a plan to enforce online and in-person identity proofing as opposed to that which can be done over the phone. This was an attempt to “implement stronger identity verification procedures,” the press release said. The changes were initially scheduled to go into effect on March 31.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nHowever, after much confusion and backlash, the SSA backtracked on some of the new measures and also extended the timeline, allowing more time for the system—and Social Security recipients—to prepare for the new identity proofing requirements. Here’s what you need to know ahead of the new Social Security identification policy. What are the new Social Security ID policies? The new SSA ID policy includes a transition to requiring “stronger” identity proofing procedures for both benefit claims and direct deposit changes—identity proofing that can no longer happen over the phone for most beneficiaries of Social Security. Recipients will instead have to verify their identity via an online account, but those who do not have an account will need to prove their identity “in-person” at an SSA field office. People can call 1-800-772-1213 to schedule an in-person appointment. Per the SSA, “the updated measures will further safeguard Social Security records and benefits for millions of Americans against fraudulent activity.”\n\nTesla CEO Elon Musk, who is leading the charge with DOGE, previously characterized Social Security as “the biggest Ponzi scheme of all time,” claiming that the program is riddled with fraud and waste. Some experts have stated that the levels of fraud within the Social Security system are not as prominent as the Trump Administration says. During a March 29 interview on MSNBC, Sen. Tina Smith, a Democrat from Minnesota who serves on the Senate Finance Committee, voiced concerns about the Trump Administration and DOGE’s intentions regarding Social Security. “They’re creating so much chaos and havoc in this system, it’s causing so much anxiety for my constituents and people all over the country,” she said. “I will tell you, I could see my Republican colleagues on the Finance Committee this week, as we were clearing the nominee [Frank Bisignano] for Social Security Administration, reflecting back the anxiety they’re getting from their constituents. But at the same time, are they willing to do anything to stop this? Apparently not.”\n\nDuring Bisignano’s hearing on March 25, Smith declined to ask a question and instead made a statement. “This is a travesty. We can see what’s going on here… this is a wholesale effort to dismantle Social Security from the inside-out. This is not about rooting out waste, fraud, and abuse,” she said. Speaking on MSNBC, Smith said Bisignano was “deflecting” during his hearing, and cast doubt on his assurances that he would protect Social Security. Read More: What Is Happening to Social Security Under the Trump Administration and Should You Be Concerned About Yours? Who will be affected by these new policies and who is exempt? The new policy initially drew criticism from lawmakers and advocates who stated that it alienated those for whom it would be incredibly difficult to make in-person visits to SSA field offices—including those in rural communities far away from offices, those with disabilities, and seniors.\n\nAARP, formerly the American Association for Retired Persons, posted a statement, requesting the SSA “rethink” these requirements, pointing out that “requiring rural Americans to go into an office can mean having to take a day off of work and drive for hours merely to fill out paperwork.” During Bisignano’s hearing, he answered questions about these changes from lawmakers worried about the alienation of citizens. Sen. Elizabeth Warren posed a hypothetical scenario to Bisignano in which a senior with a disability has trouble with traveling to a field office and is eventually turned away. She asked him: “Is that a benefit cut?” To which he replied: “I have no intent to have anything like that happen under my watch.” On March 26, the SSA posted an update to these new changes, stating that some people will be exempt from these new rules, allowing people applying for Social Security Disability Insurance, Medicare, or Supplemental Security Income (SSI) to complete their claim by other means.\n\n“We have listened to our customers, Congress, advocates, and others, and we are updating our policy to provide better customer service to the country’s most vulnerable populations,” Lee Dudek, Acting Commissioner of Social Security, said in the update. “Medicare, Disability, and SSI applications will be exempt from in-person identity proofing because multiple opportunities exist during the decision process to verify a person’s identity.” All other beneficiaries who are unable to use the online portal must still visit an in-person SSA office, that includes “people applying for Retirement, Survivors, or Auxiliary (Spouse or Child) benefits.” However, the agency states that this will not be enforced in “extreme dire-need situations.” These extreme scenarios include terminal cases or prisoner pre-release scenarios—though the agency says it is still working on a process that will allow for these cases to bypass the new policy.\n\nRead More: What Is SNAP and What Challenges Is It Facing Under the Trump Administration? When will the new Social Security ID policy go into effect? With the new shift in policy, the update from the SSA announced a delay in the timeline of the new identity proofing requirements, stating the changes will apply to all beneficiaries beginning April 14. This was in part due to an attempt to have more time to train employees. The changes come amid the SSA denying reports that they are closing multiple field offices. “Since Jan. 1, 2025, the agency has not permanently closed or announced the permanent closure of any local field office,” the SSA statement read. “From time to time, SSA must temporarily close a local field office for reasons such as weather, damage, or facilities issues, and it reopens when the issues are resolved.” Still, experts worry that with planned staff cuts, it may be harder for beneficiaries to receive benefits. Pamela Herd, professor of public policy at the University of Michigan, told TIME on March 26 that the effects are already being felt.\n\n“People are waiting for hours to get through on the phone and then getting cut off before they can actually talk to a representative. The field offices, that honestly were already a bit overwhelmed [already], are now completely overwhelmed,” she said. “So there's a real disconnect between the statement, ‘I'm not going to cut benefits,’ and in practice, what is going on in the agency.” How to prepare for the new ID policy Those who are not applying for Medicare, Disability, and SSI should prepare for the new ID policy by creating a “my Social Security” account on the SSA website, if they do not already have one. That way, they will not have to provide identification in-person. This option is the “easiest and most secure” way to verify one’s identity, according to the SSA. People can create their account through either one of two credential service providers: Login.gov or ID.me, and they must have a valid email address. For those who are unable to utilize the “my Social Security” account and therefore must go to a field office in-person, the SSA allows for several different kinds of primary and secondary proofs of identity, including a driver's license, passport, alien or voter registration card, or union card to verify your identity.\n\nThe SSA has its own priority list of acceptable identification documents listed online.",

        "source": "https://time.com/",
        "content": "Michelle Zauner wants to set the record straight: She is not trying to reclaim the label “sad girl music.” Since announcing the title of her highly anticipated fourth studio album, For Melancholy Brunettes (& sad women), the author, director, and front woman of indie-pop band Japanese Breakfast has been surprised to see how divisive the title has become, and the assumptions it’s given way to. Some thought she was writing a collection of sad breakup songs; others that she was taking ownership of a label that has previously been wielded with the intent to belittle or insult.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n“I think [the album title] was a little bit tongue-in-cheek,” Zauner says with a chuckle over Zoom in early February. “And it was maybe taken very literally.” “Sad girl music” is a fraught subject, and Zauner chooses her words carefully. “I don’t want to get into trouble,” she says, explaining that a lot of brilliant women songwriters get unfairly punted into that category. And it’s true: the music industry and the internet have made a nasty habit of reducing songwriting by women that deals with complex emotions in this way—Phoebe Bridgers, Mitski, and Lana Del Rey have had to fend off these degrading designations for years.\n\nZauner, though, is interested to see what people will say once they’ve had a listen to the project in its entirety. With the album due March 21, Zauner, 35, finds herself in a constant state of “caring, then not caring, and then pretending to care.” Her mood matches the weather outside our windows: “I’m a winter person in the sense that I feel like I must suffer through something to enjoy the coming season,” she says and laughs heartily. The stakes feel high after her past few years. For Melancholy Brunettes arrives four years after Zauner’s rise from indie-music darling to literary heavyweight with the release of her wildly successful, gut-punching memoir Crying in H Mart, which explored her Korean American identity and her relationship with her late mother Chongmi, who died of cancer in 2014. Written in arresting, empathetic prose, it became an instant New York Times best seller and is currently in its 39th printing.\n\nRead More: Michelle Zauner Is on the 2022 TIME 100 List Zauner followed up Crying in H Mart with Japanese Breakfast’s third studio album, Jubilee. Unlike the book, the album took a sharp turn away from grief into cathartic joy, blending dreamy synth-pop chords with shoe-gaze sensibilities. It was equally met with critical success, earning the group nominations for Best New Artist and Best Alternative Music Album at the 2022 Grammys. For Melancholy Brunettes (& sad women), though, is worlds away from the sonic landscape of Jubilee. It’s not quite in the sphere of Crying in H Mart, either. Here, Zauner is exploring something bleaker—crueler and more punishing. She’s trying to see what darkness, of all different kinds, looks like when you stare it right in the face.\n\nWhen I ask what comes to mind when Zauner thinks of melancholy brunettes, she excitedly whips out her phone to rattle off some references: Paintings like L’Absinthe by Edgar Degas, Tired by Ramón Casas, and The Wedding Dress by Frederick Elwell—all interpretations of women experiencing massive despair—were hugely informative to the record. They were especially important to the album art, which sees Zauner looking like a gothic, Brontëesque character, face down on a table surrounded by a plentiful feast. “I like the idea of being someone just collapsed on a table, surrounded by a wealth of goods. Like a spoiled prince or something,” she explains.\n\nWhen Zauner began writing For Melancholy Brunettes in the winter of 2022, she was clear that she wanted to do something from a more introspective place. She wanted to write songs that were also more guitar-focused, compared to Jubilee’s lush horns and slinky synths, and teamed up with producer Blake Mills (who, among his vast repertoire of acts, has worked with other virtuosic rock acts like Fiona Apple, Perfume Genius, and Alabama Shakes) to record the album at Sound City in Los Angeles—making it the band’s first proper studio release after working on their first three records with friends in makeshift recording studios. As she began piecing the songs together, Zauner was also reading—a lot. She wanted to explore how the concept of melancholy has evolved in stories of love and longing, society and familial relationships over time. She worked her way from European Romanticism to Greek mythology before turning to Gothic Romance classics like Jane Eyre, Wuthering Heights, and Frankenstein, and even modernist staples like The Magic Mountain by German author Thomas Mann, which is her husband and fellow bandmate Peter Bradley’s favorite book and directly inspired a song on the album.\n\nShe also became increasingly fascinated with works “that could be categorized as part of the incel canon,” Zauner says—books that the mostly male subculture of self-described “involuntary celibates” has glorified for their depiction of loneliness and manhood—think American Psycho by Bret Easton Ellis and Infinite Jest by David Foster Wallace. Zauner hoped to better understand why this type of “confused masculinity” and Joker-like anger and loneliness emerges; how these aggrieved and occasionally violent men process the world. “If I look back at my very early work, it’s always been [there]—this fear of men,” she says. “There is this disappointment and fear of men, and these creepy stories—like an ominous thing has happened or is about to happen—that threads the songs together.”\n\nZauner, second from right, performs with Japanese Breakfast Todd Owyoung—NBC/Getty Images\n\nIndeed, listening to the new album feels not unlike you’re Cathy (or Heathcliff) staring at the misty English moors, as impending doom envelops you from all angles: On “Honey Water,” a woman finds herself in a marriage to a slimy, unfaithful man, and equates him to a thirsty bug. On “Mega Circuit,” a lustful spectator watches a gang of incels meander around over a feverish, sinister guitar shuffle. On “Little Girl,” perhaps one of the most devastating ballads on the record, a father, urinating in a corner of a lonely hotel room, wonders how he became estranged from his daughter. (“Seven years of running at this breakneck speed/ Convalescing cheaply far abroad/ Dreaming of a daughter who won’t speak to me/ Running for her father coming home.”) Dramatic as they may seem, these sentiments are strikingly relatable—feelings of yearning and amorphous despair on an album releasing in the middle of a public-health crisis of loneliness.\n\nThe lyrics, the storytelling, the sparse, meticulous melodies—it’s all so beautifully punishing, and that is exactly the point.\n\nAfter her mom died, Zauner says, she “became very work-obsessed.” While work was a grounding force, it came at a cost: “I kind of lost track of any form of self-care or personal life, or family and friends.” Following the release of Crying in H Mart and then Jubilee (and a much-needed sabbatical in Korea), Zauner found herself thinking about what it means to be a creative working woman in her mid-30s—the price one pays for their ambitions. It was playing on Zauner’s mind a lot as she was making For Melancholy Brunettes, especially when she thought about balancing her work with expanding her family. “There is this anticipatory grief about wanting to become a mother and having to reckon with the creative loss that that will usher in,” Zauner says. “I was thinking about how much I’ve excused men for poor behavior because of their positions of power and the work that they’ve had to do to provide for their family.” Now, as Zauner has grown into her creative career, she questions the elusive balancing act between the “narcissism that comes with being an artist and [the desire to be] a good human being.”\n\nIt’s what drew her to write the album’s lead single, “Orlando in Love.” Inspired by John Cheever’s nod to Orlando Innamorato, an unfinished epic poem by the Renaissance poet Matteo Maria Boiardo, the song is a story about “a foolish, romantic guy” who succumbs to a siren’s call, and in some ways, Zauner’s personal reflection on success. “You’re pursuing your dreams in a very foolhardy way, and sometimes you’re punished for just how straight you’re going with it,” she says. “Like, if you go too far in your ambitions, it likely will not end well.”\n\nThe 2025 Grammys happened a week before Zauner and I spoke, and the internet was still buzzing not only from Beyoncé’s finally winning Album of the Year, but another artist who unequivocally spoke their mind that night: Chappell Roan. Roan, who received the Grammy for Best New Artist, got up to the podium and called out the record industry for not supporting emerging artists with necessities like a livable wage and health insurance. When Zauner heard this, she immediately took to X to congratulate Roan, writing, “f-ck ya Chappell!!!!!” That got her in a bit of trouble: some people interpreted “ya” to mean an insulting “you” instead of an enthusiastic “yes.” Zauner couldn’t believe it.\n\nRead More: Leave Chappell Roan Alone\n\n“Let the record show that I thought it was amazing, and I think it’s so ridiculous how much crap she has to endure for all of the good that she’s putting into the world. She inspires me to be a more outspoken, braver artist,” Zauner says. Having been nominated in the same category, she finds it a bit funny that these award shows so aggressively avoid naming the problems that plague the same industry they are celebrating. But Roan, she says, “very eloquently and very courageously said exactly what the problem is.”\n\nPerhaps that’s what For Melancholy Brunettes (& sad women) is trying to do, too. Naming the problem—and hoping that despite the scars, the battle wounds, the punishment, and the castigations, we’ll all come out the other end into the light.",

        "title": "Breaking Down The Apothecary Diaries Season 1",
        "source": "https://time.com/",
        "content": "Warning: This article contains spoilers for The Apothecary Diaries Season 1, and the Apothecary Diaries manga and light novels. Since its October 2023 premiere, historical mystery anime The Apothecary Diaries (also known as Kusuriya no Hitorigoto) has become a bona fide hit, building on the success of its light novel source material. In February 2024, Maomao, the anime’s poison-obsessed teen protagonist, became the first fictional character to grace the cover of Japan’s Ministry of Health, Labour, and Welfare’s monthly magazine. Later that year, U.S.-based entertainment outlets like Polygon, IGN, and Vulture named it one of the best anime series of the year. Now, The Apothecary Diaries’ first season is available to watch on Netflix in the U.S., launching a new era in the anime’s global takeover.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nSet in a fictional country loosely inspired by Imperial China, The Apothecary Diaries introduces us to Maomao, the adopted daughter of an apothecary who has taught her the art of medicine. She uses her growing expertise to treat the brothel workers in the red-light district where she was raised, until she is kidnapped by bandits and sold into indentured servitude at the nearby Imperial Palace. Maomao is placed in the Rear Palace, where the Emperor’s hierarchy of concubines live. What begins as a laundry maid position soon morphs into a greater responsibility when Maomao figures out the mysterious illness that's ailing the children of the Rear Palace. Her cleverness catches the eye of Jinshi, a beautiful eunuch who oversees the Rear Palace’s operations, and Maomao is soon promoted to lady-in-waiting and taste tester to one of the Emperor’s favorite concubines. The first season sees Maomao solving a series of medical mysteries that are revealed to be part of a larger, murderous conspiracy at work within the palace walls.\n\nSeason 1 of The Apothecary Diaries was originally simulcast on Crunchyroll from October 2023 to March 2024, but its arrival on Netflix in the U.S., Canada, and other regions has made the anime accessible to an even wider audience. For those who have just found the show, let’s break down the twisty ending and major mysteries of Season 1. Who wants to kill Jinshi? Much of The Apothecary Diaries’s ongoing mystery comes to a head in Episode 19, “Chance or Something More,” when Maomao uncovers and narrowly stops an assassination attempt on Jinshi, who is clearly hiding some major details about his true identity. The plot was instigated by court lady Suirei, with whom Maomao has crossed paths a few times in the palace. Like Maomao, Suirei has an interest in herbal medicine and grows plants that can be used for various recipes in the palace. Unlike Maomao, though, Suirei has not been using this medical knowledge chiefly to help people, but rather to take out a series of officials and workers associated with the Board of Rites.\n\nThe Board of Rites is tasked with making sure the ceremonies performed by the imperial nobles go off without a hitch, and its members have been dying throughout the series. Master Kounen’s death by salt poisoning—a murder Maomao solves in Episode 9, “Suicide or Murder?”—and the food poisoning of his successor is suspicious, but Maomao’s Sherlock Holmes-like skills of deduction are triggered when military official Lihaku tells Maomao about the recent theft of some ceremonial tools. The tools were stolen during the warehouse fire seen in Episode 14, “The New, Pure Consort.” In Episode 16, “Lead,” Maomao solves a case involving the will of a court metalworker who left a mysterious trilogy of inheritances to his three sons. The late metalworker specialized in the use of a lead alloy that melts near an open flame. In Episode 19, Maomao speaks to an archivist who was demoted after he raised concerns about the safety of a heavy pillar in the Altar of the Sapphire Sky, a building used for important ceremonies. She theorizes that the fixture holding the heavy ornament in place, one of the ceremonial tools stolen, has been replaced with one made from the metalworker’s lead alloy. Maomao puts this all together just as the next ceremony is about to begin.\n\nHow Maomao rescues Jinshi While Maomao doesn’t know the noble target, she races across the palace to the Altar of the Sapphire Sky to do what she can to stop the plot. Her efforts are met with resistance. A guard nearly knocks her unconscious with a punch to the head. Bleeding and swollen, Maomao still doesn’t give up and, with the help of court tactician Lakan, manages to make it through. Maomao tackles the target just as the massive pillar hanging over the altar crashes to the ground. Her leg is cut open in the accident, but before she passes out from blood loss, she realizes the person whose life she saved is Jinshi. “Why is Master Jinshi here? And why does he have such a sad look in his eyes?” she thinks before losing consciousness. Jinshi carries Maomao in his arms out of the Altar of the Sapphire Sky and to medical care. While it’s unlikely court lady Suirei was acting alone, she is the only person with a clear tie to the plot. Maomao first suspects Suirei when Lihaku tells her that the warehouse fire was started by an ivory pipe gifted to a guard by a tall woman who smelled of medicine. Before she can be arrested, Suirei is found dead. However, when her body goes missing, Maomao suspects that Suirei actually used a “resurrection drug” that allowed her to fake her own death. Maomao is desperate to find Suirei so she can find out more about this thornapple poison.\n\nJinshi’s true identity in the Imperial family Jinshi becomes a much more important figure than simply a high-ranking official courting palace intrigue in Season 1. We learn in the season’s conclusion that Jinshi is not actually a eunuch, but has been taking a medicine that leads to impotence while he works in the Rear Palace. Uncastrated men are forbidden from entering the Rear Palace, unless they are a part of the Imperial family. Jinshi is hiding his true identity, but Season 1 does not reveal why. Earlier in the season, it’s implied that Jinshi has a familial connection with Lady Ah-Duo, a concubine who has retired in the Rear Palace. In Episode 11, “Reducing Two to One,” Ah-Duo’s departure from the palace hits Jinshi particularly hard. Before Ah-Duo leaves, Maomao notices Ah-Duo and Jinsi’s strong resemblance to one another. But it’s also implied that Jinshi is the son of the former Emperor and Empress Anshi, which would make him the current Emperor’s younger brother. The secret of Jinshi’s Imperial identity is one of the biggest mysteries heading into Season 2.\n\nHow Maomao’s mother and father are reunited Maomao, too, begins the season with a somewhat mysterious parentage. We know she was raised by Luomen, and that she has a connection to the Verdigris House, a high-class brothel in the red-light district, but it’s unclear who her parents are. By season’s end, we discover she is the child of a courtesan named Fengxian and court tactician Lakan. The two brilliant young people fell in love over a Go board. Fengxian wants her contract to be bought out by Lakan, but he does not have enough money. In an attempt to lower her “value,” Fengxian has sex with Lakan, conceiving Maomao. However, Lakan is unexpectedly sent away by his family before he can buy out Fengxian’s contract or learn of baby Maomao. In his absence, Fengxian is forced into more precarious sex work and contracts syphilis. By the time Lakan returns three years later, Fengxian is very sick and the Madam at the Verdigris House leads Lakan to believe that she has died. Actually, the Madam and other women at the brothel have taken on the responsibility of caring for an ailing Fengxian, who is unable to take care of herself let alone a child.\n\nMaomao is raised by the women at the Verdigris House, and then by Luomen. She grows up knowing who her father is, but dislikes him for abandoning her ill mother. Lakan later earns enough money to buy out the contract of even the most expensive courtesan at the Verdigris House. When Maomao wins a bet with Lakan by beating him in a game of Go, she asks him to redeem a courtesan from the Verdigris House. When Lakan goes to the brothel, he is allowed to hear the sound of Fengxian’s lullaby from the annex where she is kept. The lovers are reunited, and Lakan spends an exorbitant amount of money to redeem Fengxian from the brothel. The two marry, and Maomao dances for her mother on the palace walls. How The Apothecary Diaries Season 1 end? In the final scene of The Apothecary Diaries Season 1, Jinshi finds Maomao dancing. When the leg wound she suffered during the incident at the Altar of the Sapphire Sky opens up, he insists on carrying her off of the palace walls. The next day, Jinshi gives Maomao the ox bezoar he promised her for investigating the palace plot. She is overjoyed, and Jinshi tells Maomao he has another mission for her—adventures we’ll see in Season 2.\n\nThe Apothecary Diaries Season 1 Courtesy of Hyuganatsu, Imagica Infos/The Apothecary Diaries Project\n\nDoes Maomao like Jinshi? Jinshi develops romantic feelings for Maomao quite early in the Apothecary Diaries story, but it is less clear how Maomao feels about Jinshi. As a character, Maomao is sardonic and emotionally reserved. While she rarely expresses affection for the people she cares about, Maomao’s deep feelings tend to be revealed through her actions. Their romance will unfold, along with more palace intrigue, in more installments of the series. How old are The Apothecary Diaries characters? Maomao is 17 years old at the start of the series, and 18 by the end of Season 1. Jinshi is 18 when the series begins, and 19 by the end of Season 1. However, as with other aspects of his identity, Jinshi obscures his true age, pretending to be older.\n\nWhere can I watch Season 2? The Apothecary Diaries is currently being simulcast on Crunchyroll. Season 2 begins with Episode 25, “Maomao and Maomao.” The streamer is currently gearing up for the second cour of Season 2. A cour is an anime term for episode runs that last roughly a quarter of a year, or three months. This typically equates to 12 or 13 episodes. At the time of this writing, new episodes of The Apothecary Diaries were being released every Friday at roughly 12:15pm EST on Crunchyroll. The second season will continue through the spring anime season, wrapping up at the end of June. Is The Apothecary Diaries based on a manga? The Apothecary Diaries actually has two ongoing manga adaptations, but the source material for both the manga and the anime is the Apothecary Diaries light novel series, written by Natsu Hyuuga. The first season of The Apothecary Diaries adapts the first two light novel volumes.\n\nHyuuga actually began the story as a web novel, posted on Japanese self-publishing platform Syosetu beginning in 2011. The web novel acts like a draft for the light novel, which Hyuuga began publishing in 2012. Light novels are books traditionally aimed at younger audiences that make use of frequent illustrations.\n\nWhere can I read the Apothecary Diaries?\n\nThe first 13 volumes of the Apothecary Diaries light novel series are available in English via ebook or paperback. The English-language edition of the 14th volume will be published on May 30, 2025. The web novel is not easily accessible to English-language readers, as it is posted on Japanese self-publishing platform Syosetu.\n\nWill there be a Season 3?\n\nWhile there has yet to be an official announcement confirming a third season of The Apothecary Diaries, given its immense popularity globally, a third season seems like a safe bet. The second season is expected to get through Volumes 3 and 4 of the light novel source material. If the anime continues at this pace, it will have many more seasons of source material to adapt.",

        "source": "https://time.com/",
        "content": "In the penultimate episode of Season 3 of The White Lotus, Rick confronts his father's killer Jim Hollinger, brandishes his gun, decides not to commit murder, kicks over the old man's chair, and finds closure. Now he and Chelsea can live happily ever after, right? Probably not. This is The White Lotus after all, and to quote a certain monk, \"You cannot outrun pain.\" Pain will find Rick in the finale. And we have a theory as to how Rick's life may yet turn upside down: Hotel owner Jim Hollinger—played by veteran actor Scott Glenn of The Right Stuff, Silence of the Lambs, The Leftovers, and Daredevil—is actually Rick's dad.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nWatch: The White Lotus Season 3 cast talks about what to expect\n\nThe White Lotus has been dropping hints throughout the season that Rick and Jim may be related, and the interaction between the two men in Episode 7 cemented our suspicions that Rick has inherited a number of traits from Jim. Here are all the clues that suggest Jim is Rick's father—and what could happen next. The \"do-gooder\" story about Rick's dad is too good to be true During a conversation with his girlfriend Chelsea (Aimee Lou Wood) on the yacht, Rick (Walton Goggins) gives the full account of what he believes happened to his dad. \"I never knew my father,\" he says. \"He was a do-gooder. He came to Thailand to help people. He was trying to help these locals to keep a shady American from stealing their land. I really don't know all the details. But my father was here trying to do the right thing, and one day he disappeared. And they never found him. My mother told me the name of the guy who did it, and he owns this hotel and half of f-cking Thailand, I guess.\"\n\nThe story is vague. Why was Rick's white father in Thailand helping locals? What exactly was he doing to help them? Even Rick admits he doesn't know the details. The White Lotus has explored colonialist themes before: Wouldn't it be far more likely that Rick's dad was the \"shady American\" than some white savior? After hearing the story, Chelsea asks Rick, \"Is this a bit, 'You killed my father. Prepare to die' kind of?\" quoting The Princess Bride. (For those who have not had the pleasure of watching that film: Mandy Patinkin plays a master swordsman bent on avenging the death of his dad and, when he confronts the killer, famously repeats over and over, \"Hello, my name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die.\") The Princess Bride is a literal fairy tale, albeit one that delivers its fantastical adventures with a knowing wink. The fact that Chelsea immediately compares Rick's situation to one of the most famous fantasies of all time indicates that something about this story doesn't ring true.\n\nThe closer analogy may actually be to Star Wars, a story about a boy named Luke Skywalker who is told that a dastardly villain called Darth Vader killed his father, Anakin Skywalker, only to discover that Vader is his father. Turns out, Vader killed Anakin in the metaphorical sense. Jim Hollinger may have similarly shed the identity of his younger self—perhaps even changed his name—in order to manifest the robber baron he became in Thailand. It would be fitting for this particular season of The White Lotus, which focuses on spiritual enlightenment (or lack thereof), if what Rick interpreted as a literal death was meant by his mother as a spiritual death: The man she knew died, and this monster replaced him. Chelsea casts further doubt on the story As they leave the yacht, Chelsea asks Rick, \"How can you be sure this is the right guy? It happened so long ago. I mean, how do you know?\" Rick shoots back, \"Because my mother told me who he was on her deathbed. You don't forget sh-t like that.\" Again, we're putting a lot of stock in the word of a dying woman we know very little about, except that she was a person who ultimately succumbed to her drug addiction. The fact that she struggled with sobriety shouldn't mean we doubt her word. But it is easy to imagine that any mother would spend her last moments conjuring a nice fairytale to spare her 10-year-old child from a lifetime of hurt.\n\nChelsea immediately recognizes that Rick might do something \"stupid.\" She says, \"I know you, Rick. This is what you do.\" She later tells her friend Chloe (Charlotte Le Bon) that Rick is a \"hot-head\" and \"f-cking mental\" who always gets into fights. Does that sound like the child of a do-gooder...or might it be possible that it's the child of a man renowned for morally questionable actions?\n\nAimee Lou Wood and Walton Goggins in The White Lotus Fabio Lovino—HBO\n\nJim recognizes Rick as \"my kind of drinker\" When Rick and Frank (Sam Rockwell) finally make it to the home of Jim and Sritala (Lek Patravadi), Rick asks for a whiskey. He drinks it all in one gulp—in part because his old buddy Frank is falling off the wagon before his eyes. Jim says, \"My kind of drinker\" and smiles at him. It's a very \"like father, like son\" moment.\n\nJim discusses his (other) children's idyllic childhood—in contrast to Rick's miserable one Rick asks Jim if he has kids. Jim says he has two daughters. \"I bet they had a happy childhood growing up here,\" Rick says. \"You bet. Spoiled rotten,\" Jim replies. \"Well that's good because if you don't have a childhood you don't have much, right?\" Rick says. There's really no reason for Rick to ask about Jim's kids except for White Lotus creator Mike White to draw our attention to the differences between Rick's upbringing and that of Jim's daughters. Rick has been obsessing over the fact that his childhood—his entire life—was \"ruined\" by this man who killed his father. He had previously told Chelsea, \"The guy ruined my f-cking life from day one. He doesn't have to answer to me?\" That may be true. But the comparison between the two sets of children suggests that Rick was disadvantaged not because his father died but because his father was giving his financial resources and love to his other children.\n\nJim recognizes Rick's mother's name\n\nLek Patravadi and Scott Glenn Fabio Lovino/HBO\n\nWhen Rick confronts Jim with the gun, Rick asks, \"Gloria Hatchett ring a bell?\" citing his dead mother. Jim clearly recognizes her name, squinting. Rick interprets this moment of hesitation as Jim searching his memory for a woman he doesn't remember. But it looks to us like he is surprised and recalling a previous sexual entanglement with a woman he hasn't heard about in decades. \"She had a husband!\" Rick yells. Jim shakes his head slowly. Again, Rick interprets this as lack of recognition, but it could be Jim saying, \"No, she didn't have a husband.\" Perhaps Jim and Gloria were never married, or he even had an affair with her while already married to Sritala. (Jim tells Frank he first came to Thailand in 1962. In an earlier episode, when Chelsea says Rick is like \"her child,\" Chloe shoots back, \"He's 50.\" Assuming that number is accurate, Rick would have been born around 1975, probably after Jim started doing business in Thailand. It's unclear when Jim would have wed Sritala, but either Jim was traveling back and forth to the U.S. or Rick's mother traveled to Thailand.)\n\nAs Rick recites the various details of his mother's story, Jim repeats the name back to him with disbelief in his voice: \"Gloria Hatchett?\" We don't get to hear any more from Jim because Rick pulls out the gun and tells Jim to \"Shut the f-ck up.\" Ultimately, Rick doesn't shoot Jim. He chooses to bury the hatchet. (This may sound corny, but note Rick's mother's last name is literally Hatchett.) Rick tells Frank that he couldn't pull the trigger because Jim was nothing but a frail old man. But on a subconscious level, does Rick maybe recognize the possibility that Jim is his father, not his father's murderer? Rick is the architect of his own misery Now that we've watched this confrontation between Rick and Jim, let's look back at Rick's conversation with the spiritual counselor Amrita (Shalini Peiris) at the White Lotus. Rick says his father was murdered and insists, \"I never had an identity...I'm already nothing.\" He then adds, \"Nothing comes from nothing,\" which interpreted literally could mean that Rick believes because his father \"died\" before he was born, he never got the benefit of forming himself in his father's image—or even in contrast to it.\n\nAmrita gently tries to show Rick that he is compounding his own misery by defining himself by this tragedy. \"The identity you've created brings you suffering,\" she tells him. Rick has made being an orphan his entire personality. That's not entirely his fault: He believed a possibly false narrative. But he bought into his mother's tale so wholeheartedly that it has warped his life. On a show filled with ironic twists, it would be fitting for that identity that defines him to be false. A random killer isn't responsible for ruining Rick's life. Rick has to take responsibility. Rick hasn't found closure, but he still can Rick seems finally—finally—satisfied at the end of the episode that he confronted his father's killer. He tells Frank that he achieved closure. But we still have another hour of television to come. If Rick finds out that Jim is actually his father, it will upturn not only his perception of that confrontation but his entire life. He could spiral into an even darker place than when he first arrived at the White Lotus hotel.\n\nOr he could find something rare on this television series: peace. Before Rick leaves for Bangkok, Amrita tells him, \"You are not stuck. You can let go of your story, escape the karmic cycle, find peace in this life. I have hope for you.\" Amrita can't know when she says this to Rick that Rick is about to confront his father's supposed killer—or that that man may be Rick's dad. But her advice to stop the karmic cycle holds. If Rick's father is a violent man, Rick can choose to not enact violence himself. He accomplished that by deciding not to shoot Jim. Satisfaction is rare on The White Lotus. Arguably only Quinn Mossbacher (Fred Hechinger), who ran away from his family in Season 1 to paddle off into the sunset, achieved something close to it. (And even that happy ending is undercut by the practical fact that he is a minor whose parents will surely find a way to retrieve him.) Perhaps Mia and Lucia in Season 2 achieved happiness with Mia securing a singing gig and Lucia conning a guest out of money—but they are not guests at the hotel and, as locals, seem exempt from the torturous travails of the ultra-privileged.\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nRick ditches the gun Courtesy of HBO\n\nRick and Chelsea's story is far from over. A few practical questions linger. If this theory is correct, will Jim feel compelled to explain the confrontation to his wife, and maybe even tell her about the child he conceived either before their union, or possibly out of wedlock? Did Jim even know about Rick until now? How will Rick find out about his parentage? And how will he react? Will he want to hurt the father who abandoned him? Reconcile with the parent he never knew? Scheme to inherit his immense wealth? And what happened to the already frail Jim after Rick pushed over that chair? Was he fine? Or did he perhaps suffer an injury or even die later on? Rick is responsible for whatever happened to Jim, and Rick's bodyguards might come looking for him, either in Bangkok where he's partying with Frank or, more ominously, the White Lotus where Chelsea will be staying in their shared hotel room.\n\nWe know a shooting will take place at the White Lotus. And Chelsea has been ominously repeating that bad things happen in threes, and she's already almost died two times, when the hotel boutique was robbed and when Rick set those poisonous snakes free. Then again, trios are major part of White Lotus this season: There are three Ratliff children, three friends on vacation, three Russian jewelry thieves, a threesome with Chloe and the two brothers.\n\nSo perhaps Chelsea will be spared and have plenty of time to work with Rick through his new revelation about his parentage. Rick, after all, is her soulmate and she repeatedly says that she is the light in his life, counteracting his darkness. Plus, it's clear that she'll do anything for her love. To quote The Princess Bride again: \"Love is many things, none of them logical.\"",

Instead, as the televised briefing began, Zelensky reached for another one of his gifts. It was a folder containing a series of gruesome photographs, showing Ukrainian prisoners of war after their time in Russian captivity. Some of their bodies were grotesquely emaciated. Others showed signs of torture. “That’s tough stuff,” Trump said, his face leaden, as he took the photos from Zelensky and began leafing through them.\n\nThose pictures, according to some U.S. officials, marked the point when the meeting went wrong. Had Zelensky offered the championship belt, the gesture might have lightened the mood. The photos had the opposite effect. They seemed to get Trump’s guard up, as though he were being blamed for the suffering of those soldiers. Still, even today, Zelensky does not regret his decision to present these images. He had been trying to reach beyond Trump’s transactional instincts, beyond his need for flattery, and appeal to Trump as a human being. “He has family, loved ones, children. He has to feel the things that every person feels,” Zelensky says. “What I wanted to show were my values. But then, well, the conversation went in another direction.”",

        "content": "Entering 2025, underlying the calm surface of the U.S. labor market were currents of anxiety, dissatisfaction, and stagnation. Companies were taking longer to fill open roles, and a growing numbers of employees were disengaged but staying in their roles out of concern it would be difficult to find something better. Now, President Donald Trump, Elon Musk, and their Department of Government Efficiency have laid off thousands of federal employees. These workers are now re-entering the job market. Plus, companies and employees alike are trying to anticipate the impact of rollicking financial markets thanks to constant changes in tariffs. This economic tumult is bringing the stormy currents of the labor market to the surface.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nIn the face of these challenges, many job seekers are turning to new AI-powered apps meant to help them find jobs. But ironically, these tools are likely to exacerbate the present challenges and make it harder, not easier, to find jobs. To understand why AI tools designed to help individuals apply to jobs will make the job market more challenging to navigate, it helps to understand the history of those tools and how companies actually hire people today. AI isn’t a new phenomenon in the job-application process. Its mainstream use began on the employer side when companies deployed AI-powered tools in the 2010s to filter through the hundreds of job applications they were receiving for open online job postings. The AI tools baked into these applicant tracking systems—software that companies use to manage the hiring process—looked for matches between the words on incoming resumes and those in job descriptions. If there was enough of a match, then a job seeker’s resume likely made it through the filter.\n\nOn its face, this seemed to offer an advantage to companies over job seekers. In reality, although companies did use these tools to winnow their hiring funnels, most actual hires weren’t made from the pool of people applying online without a connection to the hiring manager. Instead, despite the democratization of job postings online, estimates suggest that well over half of jobs—and perhaps as high as 85%—are still found through personal connections. This is due in no small part to a lack of trust that job seekers and companies have in each other when interacting online. Online job descriptions today have become a long list of skills, qualifications, and platitudes about work style and culture cribbed from past job descriptions, competitors’ postings, and requirements for pay and title grading at the desired level of the role. They have become so vague and meaningless that roles can be impossible to fill as described. Think of the myriad entry-level postings that call for “two years of experience,” for example. Or all the job descriptions that require college degrees—even when current employees in the same roles lack them. Indeed, if you peruse enough job postings, you sometimes get the feeling that employers are seeking employees who do not exist.\n\nSimultaneously, as AI-powered applicant tracking systems sort out individuals that don’t match the desired skills, experiences, and characteristics listed in these job descriptions, prospective employees have learned to embellish their resume and make themselves look like superheroes. In order to get past AI-powered gatekeepers, it has become common for applicants to exaggerate their experiences. This cycle has generated mistrust in the resumes and cover letters coming in from the internet. As a result, managers often prefer to source candidates through a referral they can trust from someone they know. Sure, that might mean it takes longer to fill open roles. But the delay can be worth it from a company’s perspective if it results in a better match. The consequence of this dynamic is that as job seekers begin using AI tools to apply to jobs online, it’s unlikely to help them. It’s actually likely to send the job market into an AI-driven hiring doom loop—the result of which will be employers relying on their personal networks for hiring even more.\n\nAccording to a recent survey by Canva, 45% of global job seekers use AI to create and fine-tune their resumes and cover letters. And a growing number of job seekers are doing something more radical: They are using AI-powered tools like LazyApply and JobCopilot to apply directly to open jobs on their behalf. But unfortunately, positive experiences with these AI-powered apps tend to be the exception, not the rule. As more job seekers leverage these automated application tools, it may become even more difficult for job seekers to find a job online because they will flood hiring managers with more applications than they could ever consider. Employers that were receiving hundreds of applications for open roles already tell us that they now receive thousands. With even less trust in the AI-tailored resumes pouring in, companies are likely to rely on personal connections even more to help them find employees.\n\nHiring processes that overly rely on personal connections creates problems—both for companies and job seekers. Companies seeking to boost the diversity of their funnel by gathering large numbers of applicants will likely continue to end up with new hires in similar social circles as their existing employees. Network-based hiring has downsides for job seekers as well. If getting a job is all about who you know, those with limited networks are often left out. As Harvard University’s Raj Chetty’s Opportunity Insights research has shown, networks are strongly based in class—particularly at the top. This means that individuals from low socio-economic backgrounds often have significantly fewer high-income connections. And given the number of jobs filled by who you know, that means that low-income Americans are less connected to higher paying opportunities in the workforce. If these personal connections become even more important when looking for a job, individuals must beef up their networks—not just on social media or with AI bots, but in real life.\n\nTo be sure, networking can “feel dirty,” but as AI makes the job search process more difficult, it will be increasingly critical. So what to do? Rather than connecting with a potential member of your network with the explicit goal of asking for a job, make a habit of being curious about the work other professionals do. Talk with people who hold roles that interest you to learn about what they do on a day-to-day and week-to-week basis. The focus, in other words, should be about learning and growth. Over time, you will expand your network and learn about the roles that are good fits for you, your unique skills and experience, and the types of work that energize you. The goal should be to become a self-aware individual who understands what opportunities are out there, recognizes what they bring to the table, and demonstrates real interest in others. That will, in turn, set you apart as someone worth recommending by those that others trust—which is something AI can’t do.\n\nMichael B.

        "content": "Jan. 28, 1986, was a day that changed Rashid Johnson. He remembers the TV set being rolled into his elementary-school classroom in Evanston, Ill.He remembers watching with his classmates as the space shuttle Challenger flew into the air and transformed into a stream of white cloud. “I remember how that affected my thinking, recognizing that failure was possible amongst adults, amongst folks who we were supposed to trust,” says the artist, sitting in his spacious Brooklyn studio, surrounded by works that are being prepared for a massive midcareer survey at the Guggenheim in New York City. “That was a big one for me.”\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nSeeing the footage of Rodney King being beaten by police in Los Angeles in 1991 also loomed large in Johnson’s life, as well as the acquittal of those officers of any wrongdoing, and the riots that followed. “I was in my young teenage years at that point,” says Johnson, now 47. “And becoming aware of the angst and anxiety and frustration of Black folks in America against the backdrop of what absolutely felt like incredibly unfair decisionmaking by the collective.” The artist has lived through joyous moments in history too—two days before the Challenger explosion, the Bears won their first and only Super Bowl—but it’s the alarming ones that made the biggest impression. “I was an anxious kid,” he says. “I think what we’re exposed to at different stages in our lives absolutely informs how we see the world.” Johnson has spent his career exploring, via his hands, what it means to be unsettled and what it means to be Black and what it means to be male and what it means to be Rashid Johnson, using whatever medium he finds inspiring at the time. His artworks, which include paintings, sculptures, mixed-media assemblages, mosaics, photographs, and film, are full of mood and foreboding. There’s beauty, humor, and exuberance as well. But it is the anxiety, especially as represented by a square-headed figure with whirlpool eyes and a frantically scribbled mouth, for which he is best known.\n\nThese days Johnson manages his anxiety in many ways. He’s extremely punctual. He works out daily. He goes to the Russian baths a couple of times a week. He has given up alcohol, is a regular at AA meetings, and frequently deploys the Serenity Prayer. He recently decided that he can trust the things he can’t control to God. Even so, as we speak he breaks out a packet of high-end Daneson toothpicks and chews on one. “This is born of an oral fixation after I quit smoking six years ago,” he says.\n\nErik Tanner for TIME\n\nHe also works that anxiety out through his art, in series with such titles as Anxious Men, Broken Men, Anxious Red, Surrender Paintings, and Bruise Paintings. The first of these was made in 2014, during the Black Lives Matter protests. He was a father by then and newly sober, so his reasons to worry increased just as he cut off access to his go-to liquid soothers. “I was thinking about my anxiety,” he says, “and kind of almost humorously depicting this character of anxiety, or trying to illustrate what anxiety might look like, through a set of wild gestures.”\n\nThe motif became newly relevant during the pandemic amid the stay-at-home measures and the increase in police-brutality videos that surfaced after George Floyd’s murder. “When people were taking ownership of it,” he says, “I began to make crowds and groups of anxious men, because I recognized that it was a collective position.” Now the Anxious Man has become one of his signatures. And like Keith Haring’s Radiant Baby or Jean-Michel Basquiat’s crown, it has attained totem status; it’s on T-shirts, plates, and jewelry. Not only does Kendall Roy wear a $30,000 dog-tag pendant with the image on it during his “progressive” phase in Succession, the actor who plays him, Jeremy Strong, owns another version of the necklace, with his daughters’ names and birthdays engraved on the back.\n\nOne thing Johnson has rarely had to worry about is critical or commercial support. His solo show at the Guggenheim, “Rashid Johnson: A Poem for Deep Thinkers,” opens April 18, and will feature some 25 years of work, including photos he took in his early 20s, which were selected for Thelma Golden’s seminal “Freestyle” show at the Studio Museum in Harlem in 2001. He has pieces in galleries and public spaces across the globe and has had solo shows on nearly every continent. His work is prized by collectors and keeps getting more valuable. (In November, a triptych of Anxious Men paintings sold for $2.7 million at Christie’s.) He and his wife, the artist Sheree Hovsepian, have swoon-worthy houses in Manhattan’s Gramercy Park and the beach town of East Hampton. On the day TIME visits his studio, he is wearing a $4,000 cashmere tracksuit and a $200,000-plus Rolex Daytona Le Mans, which isn’t even his fanciest watch.\n\nGolden exhibited Johnson’s photographs of homeless men, which he’d printed using a 19th century technique known as Van Dyke brown, because she recognized “these deeply intimate and engaged portraits that felt old while they were at the very same time, very new,” she says. “Van Dyke prints often indicate to us a certain sense of historic photography. Rashid, as a young artist, was taking that on in a way that I felt also showed how much he had looked at the history of photography and portraiture as a base.” Golden wasn’t the only person who intuited Johnson’s success early. McArthur Binion, a painter who took Johnson under his wing in the graduate program at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, noticed right away that he had all the ingredients to make it big. “You have to have the right brain cells and the right support. Rashid is fourth-generation college-educated, and as a Black person in America, that’s amazing,” says Binion. But it wasn’t just the education. “Pardon my French, but he has balls. He’s smart. He’s good-looking,” says Binion. “He has a level of patience; he allows things to come to him.”\n\nUntitled (Shea Butter Table), 2016 Martin Parsekian—Courtesy Rashid Johnson\n\nUntitled (Shea Butter Table), 2016 Martin Parsekian—Courtesy Rashid Johnson\n\nBinion used to meet former students at a bar every second Wednesday. At one of those soirées a few years after Johnson graduated, Binion told him he could see his future. “I told him, ‘Next year you are gonna make at least $100,000 from your art.’ And he laughed at me. He said, ‘No way,’” says Binion. “And he made $200,000.”\n\n“I’ve been rewarded in ways that I would never have expected to be rewarded as an artist,” says Johnson, who grew up more or less middle class. His mother Cheryl Johnson-Odim was a history professor and anti-apartheid activist in Chicago and is still a poet, and his father Jimmy Johnson owned an electronics company. “I’m grateful every time a work of mine is acquired,” he says. But he feels no obligation to feed the art market. “I don’t have to pander to that wealth creation.” Things were different when he showed at Nicole Klagsbrun’s Manhattan gallery in 2008. A few days before the exhibit came down, nothing much had sold. The show was mostly photographs from Johnson’s The New Negro Escapist Social and Athletic Club series, faux-historical portraits of sharply dressed Black men one might find in an old-school club lounge, with names that evoke Black history such as Emmett and Thurgood. There was also a crosshair sculpture that referenced the logo of the band Public Enemy.\n\nIt seemed an unlikely venue for a breakthrough. “Nicole was located, like, on the sixth floor of some monster building,” says Mera Rubell, an influential collector and the co-founder of the Rubell museums. “You know, you get off the elevator and walk three miles inside the building to get to a door.” Rubell may be foggy on the location, but she has a crystal-clear recall of what she found behind that door. “We walked in and we said, ‘Wait a minute. How is this possible, that this work is available?’” she says of the visit with her husband and co-founder Don and her son Jason, who works with them. “We just were kind of blown away. This is a talent that we didn’t know, which is what we live for.” They bought six pieces for their show “30 Americans,” which traveled to 17 other galleries, and they put one of Johnson’s photographs on the cover of the catalog. (They now own 22.) There’s never just one big break in an art career, but that was a good-size one.\n\nBoth Golden and the Rubells were drawn in by the work, but what really sealed the deal was meeting the artist. “He’s far more educated and sophisticated than most artists,” says Don, unable to resist jumping in on his wife’s speakerphone call from Miami. Johnson has a serious but friendly way of bringing people into his vision. “I’ve always tried to be really attentive to answering questions,” he says, “so that if there’s an audience in the future and they have the curiosity and the ambition and the enthusiasm to search out what I was thinking about around it, I’d provide the language.” And while Johnson grew up around “wordy people”—his younger sister is also a poet and his older brother is a lawyer—he’s not precious about the way his art is talked about. “I really don’t like the idea that my project, even with all of its diversity and complexity, is opaque,” he says. “I want people to feel agency to talk about it, say what they feel when they see it, and to trust themselves.”\n\nArt handlers hold a painting by Johnson titled Untitled Anxious Audience at Christie's in London on June 20, 2023. Wiktor Szymanowicz—Future Publishing/Getty Images\n\nThe Guggenheim is something of a homecoming for Johnson; he served on its board for seven years until 2023. (“While the idea of organizing an exhibition has been in progress for a long time, plans did not proceed until after Rashid’s tenure on the board was over,” says a museum spokesperson.) As he’s revisited his work and figured out how to display it best in the museum’s famous curved ramp, he’s had a chance to reflect on the many paths he’s explored. These paths have included, so far, working with hair lotion, shea-butter soap, wax, shelving, at least one piano, mirrors, tiles, vinyl records, and old wooden floors as well as such conventional art products as oil paint and canvas. “My interests happen to consider both the aesthetic sensibility of an art object, how it can be rewarding to witness, and how it can be rewarding to think about in a more critical way,” he says. “That dichotomy is very specific to how I think.”\n\nTake shea butter, for instance. Johnson grew up using the soap in his home. He saw it for sale in Afrocentric stores or on the street. “It became this tool that was understood as a representation of an Africanness,” he says. “But it also has a utility, it moisturizes your body. Some people, historically, would cook with it. So I became really interested in the material, and I found ways to deploy it.” The show is also allowing him to revisit some old ideas, and to play with them. “There’s a body of work called Cosmic Slops that I was making around 2008 that were about incising and the removal of material and how you create lines,” he says. He points to two cream paintings in front of him. “These works, which I’m calling Quiet Paintings, are actually the children of those. They were finished yesterday.” He seems to be relishing the opportunity to get away from just being the Anxious Man. “I’m also a person filled with joy. I have an endless number of positive interactions and family and experiences and things that make me, you know, happy,” he says. “I think the Guggenheim show will kind of amplify that, like, this sh-t to me is sometimes very funny.”\n\nJohnson has the kind of success people dream of. He’s wealthy beyond his wildest imagination. He has enough influence that he can—and does—shine a light on other artists. He and his L.A. art dealer David Kordansky have resurrected the careers of several overlooked Black artists, including Sam Gilliam before he died. But asked when he knew that he was going to make it as an artist, Johnson can’t quite get there. “I’ve always been a person who aspired to the freedom of the idea that I would at some point have the resources and enthusiasm of an audience that would allow me to do this in perpetuity. That’s absolutely something I aspire to,” he says. “I think I’m getting closer.”\n\nCorrection, March 31\n\nThe original version of this story misstated the opening date of Johnson's show at the Guggenheim. It is April 18, not April 16.",

        "source": "https://time.com/",
        "content": "If you can’t spend an hour or two with Colman Domingo in real life, you can still find the key to his spirit—the sense of the joy he both draws from the world and puts back into it—in a family photograph from Easter 1976. There’s Colman at age 6, a pint-size gent perched between his older sister and brother, wearing a candy-striped blazer so groovy you wouldn’t be surprised to see it on Sammy Davis Jr. at a Cocoanut Grove show. Elegant and poised, he gazes straight at the camera, his legs crossed just so. He brought this picture along when he appeared on The View in late November, and after the show’s hosts had finished cooing over its adorableness, he provided the backstory: The navy pants he’s wearing in the photo had a matching jacket, but it was too small. He grabbed the striped one instead, though his mother observed that it didn’t quite match. “But it makes me feel good!” he told her, and instead of arguing, she told him, “Wear what makes you feel good,” setting him on the path he follows to this day.\n\nDomingo, now 55, is known for his creative yet classic red-carpet style, inspired by influences ranging from Fred Astaire to the Ohio Players, Cary Grant to Harold Melvin & the Blue Notes—it makes perfect sense that he’s been named one of the chairs of this spring’s Met Gala, the theme of which is “Superfine: Tailoring Black Style.” Style is integral to Domingo’s spirit, as a way of communicating, of pushing out into the world, of connecting with Black men and women who came before him—which is to say that anyone who believes style is superficial hasn’t met Domingo. How he dresses, how he moves, even how he sips from a coffee cup: all these things are so casually entwined with who he is—as a performer, certainly, but also as a writer, director, producer, and, just generally speaking, a person who’s alive to the world—that they charge the air around him.\n\nGenerosity begins with the self, and Domingo is so at ease that he has extra grace to spare. In a politically and emotionally precarious world, where people seem to have stopped caring for one another, those molecules of grace are like gold. “Everything I do is about radical love,” Domingo says, over a coffee at the Chelsea Hotel in New York City. “It's about seeing each other. What am I doing as a creative? It's about getting people to think, maybe helping people think differently. You know, that's all I can do. The macro I can't take care of. But I can take care of the micro.”\n\nPhotograph by Campbell Addy for TIME\n\nClick here to order your copy of this issue\n\nDomingo has earned a Best Actor Academy Award nomination for his superb performance in Sing Sing, Greg Kwedar’s drawn-from-real-life film about men who find redemption through a prison theater program. This is Domingo’s second nomination in as many years: he was also recognized for his turn, both charming and fiery, as civil rights activist Bayard Rustin in George C. Wolfe’s 2023 biopic Rustin. (He’s the first actor to be nominated two years in a row since Denzel Washington, who earned nods for Fences, in 2017, and Roman J. Israel, Esq., the following year.) He’s the anchor of Netflix’s multipart thriller The Madness, in which he plays a media pundit who stumbles into a murder plot in the woods of the Poconos. And the projects he’s got going, for 2025 and beyond, stack far into the sky: He plays patriarch Joe Jackson in Antoine Fuqua’s upcoming Michael Jackson biopic and stars in Tina Fey’s upcoming series The Four Seasons, a reimagining of Alan Alda’s 1981 comedy. He’s ready to direct and star in a Nat King Cole biopic he’s written, and to direct a drama about the romance between Sammy Davis Jr. and Kim Novak too.\n\nBut even if the spotlight around Domingo now seems particularly bright, he has in fact been everywhere for a while now: In the early 2000s he splashed out in Broadway shows like Passing Strange and The Scottsboro Boys, garnering a Tony nomination for the latter. In 2022 he won a Primetime Emmy for his recurring role in Euphoria. Moviegoers know him from pictures like Lincoln, Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom, Zola, and The Color Purple.\n\nStill, after working as one sort of performer or another for some 35 years, he’s grateful for—and more than a little surprised at—all the extra attention he’s gotten in the past five years or so. “How can I say it? I did not intend for this at all. I wanted to be a respected actor, and I found my work as a character actor mostly in the theater. I feel like that's where I was most useful, and that's where I was best being served.” As he began to take more television roles, opportunities began shifting. “It felt like the roles were meeting me and I was meeting the roles.” Now, he knows exactly how fortunate he is, and he’s also in a place where he can effect change for others. “I’m like, ‘Oooh, I get to have an impact? What can I do? What can I disrupt?’” He laughs, a great, sonorous laugh that sounds as if it could have rolled in from the ocean, even though Domingo was born and grew up in West Philly. “That's what I want to do, and really do it in the most loving, gracious, generous way possible.”\n\n****\n\nOne of Domingo’s early gigs was as a “party starter” for bar mitzvahs, getting recalcitrant guests out on the dance floor. Though he has no formal dance training, he moves through the world on springy, lily-stem legs, and it’s hard to imagine Mrs. Rosensweig, or anyone, resisting his effervescence. But given the way he carries himself in every interaction, it’s likely Domingo offered something else too: not just charm and fancy footwork but safety, the feeling that, if you join him, he’ll have your back.\n\nFor his appearance on The View, he invited his two nieces—one is actually a family friend, but he considers her family—to hang out in the greenroom with him beforehand and later watch the show from the audience. And to observe him with family—or even the small cadre of assistants on hand to make the day go smoothly—is to see a man who doesn’t think twice before opening a door for others, literally or figuratively. It’s not only fun to be around him, but almost calming—as if he were looking after the welfare of everyone in his orbit, even amid all the demands that come with being a hardworking performer and, now, a truly famous person.\n\nHis friends seem to feel that way too. Writer-director-actor Bradley Cooper met Domingo when the two found themselves on the awards circuit last year, Cooper for his Leonard Bernstein biopic Maestro and Domingo for Rustin. “I think it was like a CAA party after the Golden Globes or something,” Cooper says by phone from New York. “I went up to him, and we had a wonderful conversation. He was just a luminous human being.” The two exchanged numbers and have since built a friendship. Domingo says Cooper has been a great sounding board for his Nat King Cole project; Cooper demurs—he doesn’t think he’s helped that much—but he values having a friend he can talk to about projects that matter. “It's always nice to talk to somebody who's going down or has gone down a similar path,” he says, “and whenever he wants to talk about anything, I would just share my experience and things that I've learned and need to work on, or want to work on. Anytime he's asked me something, I actually feel privileged that he even wants my input.” Cooper is also, simply, happy to have found a true friend. “As you get older, you tend not to make new friends. But I made a new friend, which is kind of wonderful. And he allows that space to be a friend to somebody, which is beautiful.”\n\nColman Domingo photographed in London on Jan. 19 Campbell Addy for TIME\n\nDomingo, like Cooper, has ideas to spare. He’s eager to take on bigger and more ambitious projects—more disruption of the loving, gracious, generous kind. But like lots of successful people, he’s earned his self-assurance day-by-day. He never thought the career he has now was a sure thing. “I'm happy that I'm being met in this moment on my terms, in the way that I wanted to be seen. I didn't have to become some kind of other artist, who has to leave parts of themselves behind. I bring all of me into it. I bring all my years as a theater practitioner, as a director, as a writer, as a producer. Even when the industry wanted me to just pick one.”\n\nBy showcasing his talent across film and TV, Domingo has broadened his scope in a way that allows him to share the wealth. All through 2024, as studio and streaming execs balked at greenlighting risky or ambitious projects—even as many who make their living in TV and movies were still scrambling to recover not just from the pandemic, but from the actors’ and writers’ strikes—the motto of many who’d seen work dry up was “Survive till ‘25.” And that was before so many lost their homes in the horrific Los Angeles wildfires. (Domingo’s house, in Malibu, was spared.) So while he’s riding high, he’s using his career not just to gain recognition for himself but also to help determine which stories get told. In other words, it isn’t just about climbing higher; it’s about lifting others.\n\nHis involvement with Sing Sing, as both an actor and an executive producer, is a case in point. When he signed on to play John “Divine G” Whitfield—a man, wrongly imprisoned, who finds a lifeline in the performing arts—director and co-writer Kwedar, along with the film’s other writers and producers, suggested a parity model in which everyone involved would be paid the same rate. Domingo loved the idea. “My heart just opened. I don’t know if it works for every project. But I think there are elements of it that can work, especially when it comes to low-budget features. You're doing it because you love it, and you want to be a part of it.” And when the project succeeds, everyone benefits, not just a few people at the top. “I think that's just fair,” Domingo says. “So when we did sell the movie to A24, the most beautiful thing was to know the checks were being written out to every single department, and every person. That felt so good and so meaningful, especially right now, when the industry is having an existential crisis. This model can help be a game changer, so that everyone feels respected.”\n\nColman Domingo photographed in London on Jan. 19 Campbell Addy for TIME\n\nDomingo’s Sing Sing co-star, Clarence Maclin, is a veteran of the real-life prison program that inspired the film, Rehabilitation Through the Arts, and one of the many formerly incarcerated men who have roles in the movie. He plays a version of himself, a man whose capacity for growth expands when he becomes involved with the program. Maclin, who’d gotten his acting training at Sing Sing, with its terrible acoustics and, as he puts it, “sucky sound system,” knew how to project; Domingo helped him tailor his performance to the intimacy of the camera lens. But what Maclin took from their collaboration goes beyond mere tips about technique. “He’s the genuine article when it comes to someone who definitely is going to be there, someone who means what they say about what they want to do and what their intentions are,” Maclin says via Zoom. “The things I want to be, I see in him already, and it's like a guide.”\n\nThe idea, as Maclin clearly gets, is that living in the world means so much more than looking out for No. 1. We need to focus on what connects us rather than divides us. I met with Domingo three weeks after the election, at a time when many were still feeling stunned—and more than a little helplessly frozen—by the results. As a gay Black man, one who stands up for the people and causes he cares about, he knows the road ahead might be bumpy. But when he woke up on Nov. 6, he didn’t panic. Instead, “I thought, OK, this is where we are.” Again, he vibrates with so much radiant energy that it’s impossible to feel hopeless around him. A conversation with him leaves you with the feeling that he’s handing you a key; it’s up to you to find the right door to open, but you know you can do it, even if you’re not a spectacular-looking six-foot-plus movie star who moves through every space—and the world—with lanky, liquid grace. “The pendulum does swing,” he says. “My parents went through a lot, my grandparents went through even worse. And I am here, where I am in my life, but also as a proud descendant of slaves who lived, loved, and fought, and sacrificed, so I could be here. So I can't hold my head down and be sad or despondent about anything. I have to roll up my sleeves to continue to get to work: Fight, love, be joyful in a very revolutionary way.”\n\nThis is how you honor those who came before you while also opening a corridor for everyone who will follow. This is how you get the party started.\n\nSet design by Ibby Njoya; styling by Ola Ebiti; grooming by Mata Mariélle; production by Ragi Dholakia Productions; retouching by Touch Digital",

        "title": "Why Nicole Kidman Never Stops Working",
        "source": "https://time.com/",
        "content": "In the days after giving birth, Nicole Kidman found herself unable to breastfeed. “I was so terrified, asking, What just happened? Where’s my milk?” she says. “I remember standing naked in the shower, and my sister helped me. She was my source of strength. She’d had five children—she had the wisdom to pass on.”\n\nKidman and I are curled up in chairs beside a fireplace inside a historic Nashville home, not far from the house the Oscar winner shares with her husband Keith Urban, their two daughters, and a serene poodle named Julian. Kidman is warm and disarmingly inquisitive: she wants to hear about my postpartum experience too.\n\nPerhaps I shouldn’t be surprised by the ease of this conversation about vulnerable moments in our lives as women. Kidman, 57, has emotionally exposed herself on screen for decades. On the drama Big Little Lies, she huddled under a towel between shooting scenes of domestic violence. In her latest film, Babygirl, she growled while masturbating on the floor. She marks all her scripts with notes about her characters, coded for privacy. Then she shreds them: “It’s too personal. I want it gone.”\n\nPhotograph by Petra Collins for TIME\n\nBuy your copy of the Women of the Year issue, featuring Nicole Kidman here\n\nFilmmakers adore her rawness. “People believe if you have power, you don’t have to go to a place of vulnerability,” says Oscar-winning director Jane Campion, Kidman’s longtime friend. “A lot of actors won’t do that because it’s uncomfortable.” For Kidman to be truly open with a director requires a leap of faith. She describes herself as trusting to a fault. “It’s how I approach all of my relationships. I’ve been hurt because of that, but I’m still not jaded,” she says. “I’m delicate, but I’m very giving. The emotions I offer are very, very real, so I need to know that if I’m giving that to you, you value it.”\n\nShe has found that women behind the camera often offer a support reminiscent of how her sister cared for her in those early days after childbirth. And Kidman has made it her mission to use her immense star power to shine a light on emerging directors like Halina Reijn, who helmed the bold Babygirl, about a CEO who submits to an intern in a dominant-submissive affair. Many actors called out the dearth of opportunities for female filmmakers in the #MeToo era, but few followed through on promoting talent. Kidman pledged in 2017 to work with a woman director every 18 months. She has far exceeded her promise, partnering as a producer and actor with 19 in film and TV over the past eight years.\n\nIn 2023, fewer than 15% of films released theatrically were directed by women. For those who do receive funding and support, Kidman says, there’s undue pressure to “be perfect” on the first outing. “It can be changed,” she says, “but it can only be changed by actually being in the films of women.”\n\nWith curly, strawberry-blonde hair and a preternaturally intense stare, Kidman stood out among the 14-year-olds in the Sydney-area youth acting school that a 27-year-old Campion once visited to cast her student film. Kidman won the part but dropped out, fearing she’d look silly in the stocking she had to wear on her head for the costume—now one of her biggest regrets. But the two stayed in touch, and Kidman consulted Campion after making the jump to Hollywood where, at first, her newsmaking marriage to Tom Cruise in 1990 threatened to overshadow her work.\n\n“By the time she was married to Tom, people in America didn’t understand Nicole had a whole career in Australia that was revered,” Campion recalls. “They just thought she was riding on his career. She was in despair about the roles she was being offered, and wondering how she could change her trajectory.” Kidman jumped at opportunities to work with directors she admired. A series of performances in the late 1990s, in Gus Van Sant’s To Die For, Campion’s The Portrait of a Lady, and Sam Mendes’ staging of The Blue Room in London, proved her bona fides.\n\nPetra Collins for TIME\n\nKidman has since worked with auteur after auteur. When certain directors call, she doesn’t even read the script before saying yes: she gleefully signed onto Lars von Trier’s 2003 avant-garde thriller Dogville; Yorgos Lanthimos’ unsettling 2017 drama The Killing of a Sacred Deer; and Robert Eggers’ bloody 2022 fable, The Northman.\n\nAnd, of course, Stanley Kubrick’s Eyes Wide Shut. Reijn has said that Babygirl was, in part, inspired by Kidman’s performance. In the 1999 movie, her character shares a sexual fantasy that triggers a crisis of masculinity for her husband, played by Cruise. Reijn fantasized about Kidman’s character carrying out the imagined affair. It’s the kind of evolution Kidman hopes to encourage by opening doors for women: “Stanley was dealing with it from the male perspective, and Halina chose to reinterpret it as a woman.”\n\nBabygirl, released on Christmas, capped a year of stories about women’s sexuality in midlife. Miranda July’s best seller All Fours, the Anne Hathaway romance The Idea of You, the Laura Dern movie Lonely Planet, and another Kidman project, A Family Affair, all featured women in their 40s and 50s entangled with younger lovers. “It’s always been there—it just hasn’t been told. Maybe it’s threatening,” Kidman says. But she is, as TIME’s film critic Stephanie Zacharek posited in her Babygirl review, in her “don’t give a f-ck” era. Kidman doesn’t swear, but she admits, giggling, that the sentiment resonates. “I have the philosophy to never fight anything,” she says. “Surrender.”\n\nShe’s come a long way from the teen who was embarrassed to wear a stocking on her head, Campion says. “That was a lesson to her later: be brave.”\n\nWhen we meet, Kidman has spent the previous day filming the crime series Scarpetta with Oscar winner Jamie Lee Curtis in Nashville and will fly to Berlin in the evening to wrap Season 2 of Nine Perfect Strangers before turning around to promote Mimi Cave’s thriller Holland at SXSW in Austin in March. Last year alone, she starred in A Family Affair, the Lulu Wang–directed Expats, Susanne Bier’s beach-set The Perfect Couple, and the CIA drama Lioness—all before Babygirl hit theaters.\n\nPetra Collins for TIME\n\nKidman is able to partner with so many female directors in part because she never stops working. “People go, ‘You’re a superwoman,’” Kidman says. “I hate it.” She doesn’t feel super—she gets fatigued like anyone else—but she’s a lifelong people pleaser. She fretted over bringing home perfect grades. If she can’t think of the exact right response to a text, she’ll ignore it for weeks. She’s often compelled to say yes to roles because doing so creates jobs. “People work when Nicole works,” Curtis says. “I’m working because Nicole is working.”\n\nAnd she knows it’s a privilege. She remembers times when she contemplated quitting: “When there was nothing exciting or relevant coming my way, when there was massive criticism or bullying, when your self-esteem is shattered, when you’ve been hit with some massive loss or grief and go, ‘I don’t want to get out of bed. It’s too frightening.’”\n\nCampion has witnessed Kidman pull herself out of moments of strife. “She’s always been a star, and that star has come up and come down, but Nicole knows that in itself is not what makes her happy. What makes her happy is her work.”\n\nKidman has been on a run of producing and starring in projects about privileged matriarchs whose lives unravel when a secret comes to light. It’s not that she’s particularly attracted to her glamorous yet guarded characters—those just happen to be the stories that get greenlighted. “I am so open to starting something completely a mess and shattered,” she says. “Where is it? Give me the material.”\n\nBut the part works. Audiences eat up her rich, icy characters. Campion, art house to the core, concedes there’s value in Kidman’s ability to tap into a hungry, predominantly female audience. “You can’t have power without being commercial,” she says. “You have to make money. Women want material that fits them, not just macho superheroes.”\n\nAnd there’s something deceptively progressive in those stories. Prestige roles for women often involve playing the supportive wife. But in her projects, Kidman is the star, with accomplished male actors—Alexander Skarsgard, Liev Schreiber, Antonio Banderas—bolstering her performances. When she says her onscreen husbands have been egoless, I can’t help but raise an eyebrow. “I’ve worked with some of the greatest male actors in the world, and they’ve been so generous. All of them. Is that crazy?” Kidman laughs. She wasn’t intending to flip a trope on its head. She just did it.\n\n—\n\nStyled by Stella Greenspan; hair by Italo Gregorio; make-up by Gucci Westman; production by Perfect Projects.",

        "title": "Mallory McMorrow: Democrats Must Reclaim the American Dream",
        "source": "https://time.com/",
        "content": "Mallory McMorrow has been considered an up-and-comer in the Democratic Party since 2022, when she went viral after a speech responding to Republican attacks that she was a \"groomer\" for supporting trans kids. On April 2, the Michigan state senator announced she is launching a campaign for the U.S. Senate seat that will be vacated by the retiring Democratic incumbent Gary Peters. \"We need new leaders,\" McMorrow, 38, says in a video announcing her candidacy. \"Because the same people in D.C. who got us into this mess are not going to be the ones to get us out of it.\"\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nTIME spoke to McMorrow earlier in March, as she was contemplating a Senate run, about her party's messaging mistakes, the story the Democrats should be telling, and how to reclaim the American dream. This interview has been condensed and edited for clarity. So what went wrong for the Democrats, and how can they fix it? I think people just do not know what Democrats stand for and what Democrats are actually going to do for them. And I don't know if it's PTSD, I don't know if it's just struggling with how to manage this moment, but watching Democrats fall back into talking exclusively about what Donald Trump is doing and what Elon Musk is doing, it does not give the alternative vision or a reason to positively vote for Democrats. I think at this point everybody knows who Donald Trump is. We need to say who we are and what we stand for, and we haven't done that. What do you think is the positive vision? What is the reason to vote for Democrats?\n\nDemocrats fight for the American dream. The idea that if you work hard, you get a good education— which should be available no matter where you are—you will be able to have a good life, afford to buy a house and raise a family, and in a place like Michigan, maybe have a place up north and go on vacation. We've just lost that universal value. We're the first generation that did worse than our parents. And I think people just are so angry with the idea that, ‘I did everything right, and I still can't afford anything, and I am never going to get to where I want to be.’ Democrats have to show that that is what we stand for, and we will fight for you, at a moment when the Republicans are just once again giving massive tax breaks to billionaires. So how specifically should Democrats do that? You have to do contrast, and that isn't just to say, ‘Donald Trump is bad.’ Something that has been really frustrating for me is watching Democratic messaging talk about things like tax cuts for billionaires as if it is just free money that falls out of the sky. We have to made it abundantly clear: these are our taxpayer dollars as Michiganders that go to Washington, and then the Republicans are turning around... and giving your money to Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg. This is reverse Robin Hood at its grossest.\n\nAnd what Democrats want to do—we've been doing this here in Michigan—is we expanded the earned income tax credit. We have vastly expanded childcare. We passed the first permanent funding in the state budget to expand housing units across the state. We are on the path to universal pre-K. We recognize that for a lot of people, the American dream is no longer an option, and we are fighting to make sure that you have good schools, you have enough housing, you have solid infrastructure so that you can realize the American dream again. What do you wish Democrats would stop talking about? I wish Democrats would stop talking about Donald Trump in extremes. Throughout a lot of the 2024 election, the message from Democrats was, ‘Donald Trump is a unique threat to democracy, and he is a fascist, and if you vote for him, democracy will end.’ And the perception that people took away is that that means it will end immediately. And then when you turn around and you're attending the State of the Union and maybe you're wearing a pink blazer, but you're still there, and you're treating it like somewhat normal, you are losing trust with people because you are perceived as the boy who cried wolf.\n\nThe last time the Democrats had a robust internal policy debate, it was about health care during the 2020 election. What issue should be at the core of the Democrats agenda moving forward? Talking exclusively about healthcare was too in the weeds. I really focus on the American dream because it is that aspirational vision that I think people are missing. Healthcare is just one piece of it. Everybody wants to know that they can afford to go to the doctor, or if they have an emergenc they can go to the ER and not end up bankrupt. But there's a lot more to life than that. It feels like Democratic messaging is always about the bare minimum. I constantly get draft mailers in my office that say things like, ‘Democrats are fighting so you could put food on the table.’ That is the bare minimum. That is not aspirational. And I think that has left a massive vacuum where, you may not like Donald Trump or Elon Musk, but there is something aspirational to the idea that if I work hard enough, I want to be rich. And look, they're rich and successful, and maybe we should have them in charge.\n\nWhat's the story that Democrats should be telling? We are dealing with an Administration who for the next few years is going to be robbing from you, taking your hard-earned dollars to give it to the wealthiest. They are robbing you of your American dream. And the reason to change in the next two years, in the next four years, is to get that future back for you. Most people are tired of how chaotic and crazy everything is, and they just want it to be normal. So if you can present a very normal, very American future to people, that's really appealing. I can tell you, based on the reaction on the ground right now, regardless of party, people are anxious and angry, and that's not sustainable. I think that if you look at the results of the 2024 election and how and where Democrats lost, it wasn't just with one group of people. It was small enough numbers of people across every single demographic, across every county, across every state, you know, basically every age bracket, except black women. Which said to me that even if you are somebody who's struggling to put food on the table, your aspiration is still the same as everybody else. Your aspiration is not, 'Well, I just want to pay the bills and put food on the table.' It's, 'I want to be able to work myself out of this situation to where I have a house in a great community and my kid is going to a great school.'\n\nWe spend too much time just talking about the individual policy pieces that impact the most vulnerable, when really the message is universal and the same. And Democratic messaging too often talks about people's worries. And I think it keeps people in that state of anxiety. People want to be comfortable. You came to national prominence for the floor speech you gave about defending trans kids. Now the landscape around that issue has changed a bit, and some Democrats are questioning whether putting trans equality so close to the center of their priorities has alienated people, or has been a mistake. What do you think about that? I think that that's bull---t, because Democrats did not make these issues the center of our agenda. Republicans made it the center of Democrats' agenda. Donald Trump spent millions and millions and millions of dollars on one ad: 'Kamala Harris is for they/them and Donald Trump is for you,' right? Where I think Democrats go wrong is taking the bait and falling into the trap. I think the right answer in this moment is to say, unequivocally: yes, sports should be fair, but is that an issue that a politician should be deciding? In the same way that a politician should be deciding whether or not you have reproductive rights and what you can do with your own body? No, I think that a local sports governing body is the best place to make those decisions.\n\nWhere Democrats have fallen short is taking the bait and falling into the trap and debating whether or not trans people have a right to exist and instead of just saying this is not a decision for politicians in Washington. It's just not. Sports should be fair. And the ultimate decider on whether or not a sport is fair is the governing body of that sport, period.\n\nThe fear that I have, and I say this very candidly as a woman who has a deeper voice, is that [this debate] is opening the door to be very dangerous for girls. That if you don't look a certain way, and if you don't sound a certain way, or you present in a way that somebody deems is not feminine enough, that they're gonna examine your genitals before you can play a sport. I'm sorry, that is terrifying and disgusting to me, and that is the path that this is going down.\n\nYou know, I have a square jaw and a deep voice, and there are no shortage of people online who've posted pictures of me and they accuse me of being a man. So I'm on the receiving end of a lot of what girls would face if what Republicans are proposing became law and normalized.",

        "source": "https://time.com/",
        "content": "SAN FRANCISCO — Protesters against billionaire Elon Musk’s purge of the U.S. government under President Donald Trump demonstrated outside Tesla dealerships throughout the U.S. and in some cities in Europe on Saturday in the latest attempt to dent the fortune of the world’s richest man. The protesters were trying to escalate a movement targeting Tesla dealerships and vehicles in opposition to Musk’s role as the head of the newly created Department of of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, where he has gained access to sensitive data and shuttered entire agencies as he attempts to slash government spending. The biggest portion of Musk’s estimated $340 billion fortune consists of his stock in the electric vehicle company, which continues to run while also working alongside Trump.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAfter earlier demonstrations that were somewhat sporadic, Saturday marked the first attempt to surround all 277 of the automaker’s showrooms and service centers in the U.S. in hopes of deepening a recent decline in the company’s sales. Read More: Tesla Protest Movement Prepares for its Biggest Day Yet By early afternoon crowds ranging from a few dozen to hundreds of protesters had flocked to Tesla locations in New Jersey, Massachusetts, Connecticut, New York, Maryland, Minnesota and the automaker's home state of Texas. Pictures posted on social media showed protesters brandishing signs such as “ Honk if you hate Elon ” and “ Fight the billionaire broligarchy.” As the day progressed, the protests cascaded around the country outside Tesla locations in major cities such as Washington, Chicago, Indianapolis, Cincinnati and Seattle, as well as towns in Virginia, Pennsylvania and Colorado. Smaller groups of counterprotesters also showed up at some sites.\n\nElon Musk looks on as U.S. President Donald Trump hosts a meeting in the Cabinet Room of the White House on March 24, 2025, in Washington, D.C. Brendan Smialowski—Getty Images\n\n“Hey, hey, ho, ho, Elon Musk has got to go!” several dozen people chanted outside a showroom in Dublin, California, about 35 miles (60 miles) east of San Francisco, while a smaller cluster of Trump supporters waved American flags across the street. A much larger crowd circled another showroom in nearby Berkeley, chanting slogans to the beat of drums. “We're living in a fascist state,” said Dennis Fagaly, a retired high school teacher from neighboring Oakland, “and we need to stop this or we'll lose our whole country and everything that is good about the United States.” Anti-Musk sentiment extends beyond the U.S.\n\nThe Tesla Takedown movement also hoped to rally protesters at more than 230 locations in other parts of the world. Although the turnouts in Europe were not as large, the anti-Musk sentiment was similar. About two dozen people held signs lambasting the billionaire outside a dealership in London as passing cars and trucks tooted horns in support. One sign displayed depicted Musk next to an image of Adolf Hitler making the Nazi salute — a gesture that Musk has been accused of reprising shortly after Trump's Jan. 20 inauguration. A person in a Tyrannosaurus rex costume held another sign with a picture of Musk's straight-arm gesture that said, “You thought the Nazis were extinct. Don’t buy a Swasticar.” “We just want to get loud, make noise, make people aware of the problems that we’re facing,” said Cam Whitten, an American who showed up at the London protest. Tesla Takedown was organized by a group of supporters that included disillusioned owners of the automaker’s vehicles, celebrities such as actor John Cusack, and at least one Democratic Party lawmaker, Rep. Jasmine Crockett from Dallas.\n\n“I’m going to keep screaming in the halls of Congress. I just need you all to make sure you all keep screaming in the streets,” Crockett said during an organizing call this month. Another Democratic lawmaker, Rep. Pramila Jaypal, showed up at a protest in Seattle, which she represents in Congress. Musk backlash has included some vandalism Some people have gone beyond protest, setting Tesla vehicles on fire or committing other acts of vandalism that U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi has decried as domestic terrorism. In a March 20 company meeting, Musk indicated that he was dumbfounded by the attacks and said the vandals should “stop acting psycho.” Crockett and other Tesla Takedown supporters have been stressing the importance of Saturday’s protests remaining peaceful. But police were investigating a fire that destroyed seven Teslas in northwestern Germany in the early morning. It was not immediately clear if the blaze, which was extinguished by firefighters, was related to the protests.\n\nIn Watertown, Massachusetts, local police reported that the side mirror of a black pickup struck two people at a protest outside a Tesla service center, according to the Boston Herald. The suspect was promptly identified by police at the scene, who said there were no serious injuries. Musk maintains that the company's future remains bright A growing number of consumers who bought Tesla vehicles before Musk took over DOGE have been looking to sell or trade them in, while others have slapped on bumper stickers seeking to distance themselves from him. But Musk did not appear concerned about an extended slump in new sales in the March meeting, during which he reassured the workers that the company’s Model Y would remain “the best-selling car on Earth again this year.” He also predicted that Tesla will have sold more than 10 million cars worldwide by next year, up from about 7 million currently.\n\n“There are times when there are rocky moments, where there is stormy weather, but what I am here to tell you is that the future is incredibly bright and exciting,” Musk said. After Trump was elected last November, investors initially saw Musk’s alliance with the president as a positive development for Tesla and its long-running efforts to launch a network of self-driving cars. That optimism helped lift Tesla’s stock by 70% between the election and Trump's Jan. 20 inauguration, creating an additional $560 billion in shareholder wealth. But virtually all those gains have evaporated amid investor worries about the backlash, lagging sales in the U.S., Europe and China, and Musk spending time overseeing DOGE. “This continues to be a moment of truth for Musk to navigate this brand tornado crisis moment and get onto the other side of this dark chapter for Tesla,” Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives said in a recent research note.\n\n—Associated Press writers Terry Chea in Berkeley, California, Mustakim Hasnath in London and Stefanie Dazio in Germany contributed.",

        "content": "I wake up from the anesthesia and a black tide washes over me. The world seeps slowly back. A hospital room. The face of a doctor and two nurses mouthing something I can't understand. This is not the first time I've woken up from surgery. The first ones I had gave me my cochlear implants. The last one I had gave me my chest scars. This time, seven new bolts of metal have been added to my left arm—I took a fall while bike training for an upcoming ride this summer with a deaf bike group from San Francisco to LA in support of the San Francisco AIDs Foundation and the Los Angeles LGBT Center.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nMy best friend pushes open the door and walks toward me, her eyes soft. Gazing at her with heavy lids, I allow myself to fall apart. Anesthesia, I later learned, has a way of bringing your subconscious, deepest thoughts to the surface. “I’m having such scary thoughts,” I keep saying, over and over, between sobs. “You know how I can’t ever seem to imagine my future…” I hesitated. Saying it out loud would make it real. \"It’s clear now that I was never planning to kill myself,\" I admitted. \"I thought someone else was going to.\" We exhaled together. Her expression remained unchanged, like she already knew something I was only now beginning to realize myself. Growing up in rural Pennsylvania, I spent so many years being invalidated for being a deaf, trans person of color. I spent my last few years of high school listening to my peers chant \"Electrocute the gays\" and attach Trump stickers to every locker during Donald Trump’s first administration. I felt very stuck—I couldn’t vote because I was underage, and while I was out, I hadn’t yet realized that I was trans. I certainly didn’t feel safe enough to share that with my classmates, and I didn’t know how I could tangibly contribute to the fight against the hatred I was seeing around me. Every day, I was trying to do what I could to hold on to my soul—to survive.\n\nNow, Trump is in office once again, but despite his full-scale assault on trans lives, something within me is different this time: I have a kind of joy I only felt as a young child—joy without conditions.\n\nCourtesy Chella Man\n\nThis concept is a bit new to me—it wasn’t always this way. For so long, I thought my joy had to be in resistance to those who want to erase me. Years ago, I had made a deal with myself: I made a choice to give my life to fighting for a just world. I wrote down, full of love for who I was and my communities: I am willing to fight until I die against the unfathomable injustices that pervade our society. I moved forward knowing I had set a timer for my own life, anticipating that one day someone would be saying my name in memoriam.\n\nThat was the only ending I could see at the time. Not because of anything I did, but because of who I was: Deaf, trans, Asian, Jewish, and highly visible as these identities. Because people like me don’t survive the systems we live in. I never had a death wish. I just figured it was inevitable. For years after that, I went to protests, sat on panels, and gave talks all across the country to universities and at brand headquarters. At various points, I imagined someone standing in the crowd and pulling a gun on me, making that day my last. But I showed up anyway because I had made my choice. In the end, I found myself in situations where my heart broke again and again. I fought so hard, thinking the world would change. I thought if I was a martyr—if I gave my life to the cause—it would catalyze the world I want to live in. That was the story I told myself. Until now. For the past few years, I’ve been making space to listen to my grief—letting it settle in my chest, listening to what it has to say. I’ve committed to meditation with relentless discipline. I’ve learned that stillness is a crucial part of our fight for liberation and is the balance that our movements need. I can’t offer authenticity to others if I’m not rooted in myself first. Showing up for myself isn’t a betrayal. It’s the only way I can truly show up at all.\n\nCourtesy Chella Man\n\nTurning inward, I found myself sifting through thousands of diaries from the past two decades to jog my memory of who I was and who I’ve grown into. I see how much I endured for so many years, in part because I felt like I was in the dark for so long. No single person, place, or resource held the full truth of my lived experience. I found fragments of myself in different places. I had to be my own representation, my own role model, my own life-saving resource. I see why I had to fight so hard. I had to grieve that so many people did not know how to fight for my freedom, even if they tried. Unlearning martyrdom can be unsettling that way—but necessary.\n\nCourtesy Chella Man\n\nNow, the moments that feel like the world is changing are unexpected: when I paint; when I scale a mountain on a bike; when I lose track of time in the woods; when I notice the leaves of the trees applauding me like they would in sign language, when I nuzzle into the people I love; Change is the peace I feel within, knowing what I want and where I need to be. The world is shaped, etched, and molded every day by people like me. People who are my neighbors, my peers, my elders. But true change starts with the world that exists inside of ourselves, first. On the surface, you may not notice the way things begin to shift. In the morning, for instance, when the light streams through my bedroom window, I used to slap on my cochlear implant immediately. Now, the silence allows me to tune into my inner voice. There is peace in welcoming transformation through stillness, knowing that change is inevitable–our lives are the proof.\n\nIn the reverberations of our chaotic political climate, it’s worth asking: What is your inner voice telling you? How are you thinking for yourself? What do you choose to believe? How can you show up for yourself and build toward a culture in which we all meet our needs and therefore our communities?\n\nFor me, it means recommitting to myself: My joy for being alive is not born out of resistance to any system, no matter who is in office. My joy does not need any reason to exist. It just is. And that has to be more than enough.",

        "source": "https://time.com/",
        "content": "This article is part of The D.C. Brief, TIME’s politics newsletter. Sign up here to get stories like this sent to your inbox. On Capitol Hill, there was one universal sentiment circulating among Republicans of all political stripes: Finally. Wednesday’s word—if accurate—that billionaire Elon Musk was poised to leave President Donald Trump’s inner circle in the coming weeks came as a relief to top GOP aides who saw Trump’s favorite chaos agent as a drag on their efforts to deliver on a conservative agenda. There were some suggestions that Musk may not leave the Administration entirely, but rather downgrade his public involvement. The murkiness of the scale-back was typical for a President who hates to be boxed in or give his critics validation.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nMusk, the Tesla chief who purchased Twitter and has vowed to populate Mars, has been a colossal distraction and a magnet for controversy from what should be a unified Republican team in control of the House, the Senate, and the executive branch. He has been a ubiquitous presence at the White House, an annoyance to Cabinet Secretaries and department chiefs, and a walking personification of the Trump orbit’s amateurism and kleptocracy. Musk and his Department of Government Efficiency have been rushing through Washington, slashing programs and jobs with what even some small-government conservatives view as too fast and with little consideration for the consequences, all while cashing billions in government contracts for his own companies. News of Musk’s expected withdrawal, first reported by Politico, came less than 24 hours after troubling results for Republicans in special elections in Florida and Wisconsin. Those early verdicts on the second Trump era saw Republicans underperform in MAGA Country and completely fail in a state Supreme Court race that Musk all but made his own personal crusade. It’s that last race, in a state typically decided by one percentage point or so but on Tuesday saw the liberal candidate win by 10 points, that left the most obvious damage.\n\n“Day late. Dollar short,” one Hill aide texted me, linking to the Politico story. “Glad we made the WI-SC race all about Elon.” The sarcasm dripped. Another responded with a clip of a Lizzo lyric: “About damn time.” The report got immediate pushback, especially among Trump’s apologists. The argument went something like this: Yes, Musk hurt the GOP brand and his work in Wisconsin was nothing short of a failure, but his celebrity marries nicely with Trump’s self-image. Plus, Musk remains the world’s richest man and his pockets are ripe for raiding. For its part, the White House officially called the report “garbage.” But there have been hints that Musk’s time was short, including the President who said Musk would at some point have to return to the private sector. “At some point, Elon’s going to want to go back to his company,” Trump said on Monday. To a tee, Hill Republicans have tolerated Musk because he clearly has the ear of the President, who has invited his billionaire patron to join Cabinet meetings, bill signings, and even his joint address to Congress. Musk’s star has overblown any other shine in the Trump Cabinet, and spats inside the inner circle have seeped into the open as the folks actually charged with leading the government have bristled at orders from the billionaire bestie. Lawmakers have complained that they’ve been blindsided by cuts and changes, leaving them exposed while home. Musk and his hacker minions have blown into departments, demanding access to highly sensitive data in pursuit of finding waste, fraud, and abuse—often making cuts and promoting the reductions before fully understanding what was going on.\n\nWhat has resulted in the first weeks of Musk’s campaign against government has been reports of veterans being fired, whole agencies mothballed—probably unconstitutionally, courts are declaring—and benefits thrown into risk. The result has been an unrelenting pile of bad headlines, although White House aides have done their best to mask the setbacks, knowing Musk spent more than a quarter of a billion dollars on Trump’s last election and has pledged $100 million going forward. For their part, lawmakers have tried to flag for the White House the back-home problems for constituents, but have been careful not to come off as anti-Musk. Trump voters may say they want government slashed, but are less supportive when the details come out—particularly as farm subsidies are thrown into question, V.A. clinics are threatened, and popular programs in rural schools are put at risk. Simply put, the local ripples could end up causing a national tide.\n\nTuesday’s election results were the first real warning sign of those troubles and their costs. Musk made the Wisconsin race his Waterloo, saying Western civilization itself hung in the balance. He visited the state over the weekend, campaigning for a Trump-backed candidate and handing out checks to voters. The state is no stranger to out-of-town political activists—it has long been a testing ground for the network of groups funded by the billionaire Koch family—but the enthusiasm among Democrats in rejecting Musk’s bid was unstoppable. In Florida, Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis on Wednesday trashed the results and credited Trump with saving the pair of races in deep-red MAGA territory. DeSantis, who has savaged one of the nominees as uniquely terrible, nonetheless acknowledged this was not the right trajectory for the GOP. So, as White House aides figured out how to spin the setbacks, the most obvious answer was also the easiest: cut Musk loose. By the very nature of his position, Musk was always going to be a short-time fed, likely exiting in May. His DOGE gig remained a side-hustle as he kept running his companies and launching rockets into space. Hastening his exit, or at least advertising his move into the background, would help Trump.\n\nAfter all, Trump has proven in the past that his loyalty is conditional. Rather than take the political discomfort, he has shoved aide after aide out the door. While Musk has commanded Trump’s respect and awe—and has an unmatched pocketbook—there’s no reason to think he can’t eventually be sidelined as well. It’s been precisely what traditional Republicans have been counting on, and they took heart on Wednesday that some patterns never fail. The specifics of Musk’s climb down remain to be seen, but the fact that chatter about it is being received with such glee among Hill Republicans may be the validation that moves Trump to a hard yes on Musk’s shift.\n\nMake sense of what matters in Washington.

        "content": "Each year TIME honors individuals whose actions have had an indelible impact on global efforts to address one of the most pressing crises facing our planet: climate change. This year marks TIME’s third annual Earth Awards, and the stakes couldn’t be higher. In 2024, the planet breached 1.5°C of warming above pre-industrial temperatures, an ominous milestone—and a reminder of the urgency with which the world must tackle this challenge. And although climate action faces headwinds from the rising tide of populist politics around the world, this year’s group of honorees remain steadfast in championing sustainability and shaping a greener future.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nThere is the Environmental justice leader Catherine Coleman Flowers, who has a legacy of advocating for marginalized communities, particularly Black and rural families affected by untreated sewage. She has gone on to work with Democrats and Republicans alike in an effort to bring about lasting change. Alongside, we honor Jay Inslee, the Governor of Washington from 2013 to 2025, and a leader in local climate action. As co-founder of the U.S. Climate Alliance he has brought together two dozen states to drive progress towards a clean economy. There is former New York Mayor and U.N. Special Envoy Michael Bloomberg, who is steadfastly dedicated to supporting innovative solutions. In January, when President Donald Trump announced the U.S. would withdraw from the Paris Agreement, Bloomberg Philanthropies stepped up to coordinate an effort to continue funding the nation’s climate goals. In Ghana, chef Selassie Atadika, the founder of Midunu—an experiential restaurant that highlights the region’s culinary heritage—and Midunu Chocolates, uses her food to advocate for sustainable agriculture and showcase the power of the African kitchen. In 2024 she was announced as Yale's inaugural Global Table Fellow in an effort to highlight the connection between sustainability, health, and culture.\n\nBack in the U.S., Former Tennessee Republican Senator Bill Frist is calling for climate change to be recognized as a public health crisis. He serves as the global chair of The Nature Conservancy which last year launched the Senator Bill and Tracy Frist Initiative for Planetary Health.\n\nAnd actor Rainn Wilson is on a mission to better communicate the urgency of the climate crisis. With that goal in mind, in 2022 he co-founded Climate Basecamp, an organization that brings scientists and trendsetters together to make talking about the reality of climate change more accessible.\n\nBuy a copy of the Earth Awards 2025 issue here",

        "title": "What We Must Understand About the Dark Enlightenment Movement",
        "source": "https://time.com/",
        "content": "Filippo Tommaso Marinetti liked automobiles, particularly his four-cylinder Fiat sports car. For him, the car represented innovation and vitality, even violence. Most of all, it signified the future. An Italian poet, performer, and pamphleteer, Marinetti was a reactionary; he loathed egalitarianism and democracy. He also wasn’t a conservative in any traditional sense, for there was little that he, and others in the Futurist art movement that he founded, wished to conserve. In his 1909 treatise, Founding and Manifesto of Futurism, he wrote, “We will destroy the museums, libraries, academies of every kind.” A precursor to the fascism that would envelop Europe, Marinetti was an influence on Benito Mussolini, and that ideology, which would soon fulfill that dark promise of destroying Europe’s museums, libraries, and academies.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nMarinetti’s stronghold over Mussolini has striking parallels to America today—particularly with the rise of the “Dark Enlightenment” movement and its most vocal steward: software engineer and blogger Curtis Yarvin. Largely ignored by academic philosophers, the “Dark Enlightenment” movement and Yarvin have curried favor and influence with tech executives in recent years. A software engineer by training, Yarvin has become a kind of official philosopher for tech leaders like PayPal cofounder Peter Thiel and Mosaic founder Marc Andreessen. Not unlike the Futurists, Yarvin advocates for replacing democracy with a kind of techno-feudal state—for the government to be run like a corporation, with the president as its “CEO.” This new system is elitist—“humans fit into dominance-submission structures” Yarvin wrote in 2008; and it’s authoritarian—“If Americans want to change their government, they’re going to have to get over their dictator phobia,” he said in 2012. There are shades of Yarvin’s philosophy in Thiel’s 2009 essay for the Cato Institute, where he wrote “I no longer believe that freedom and democracy are compatible.” And Thiel, through his venture capital firm, Founders Fund, was an early investor in the blogger’s startup company Urbit. As for Yarvin’s controversial opinions and whether or not Thiel holds them, Yarvin has said that his patron is “fully enlightened,” as he had been “coaching Thiel.” What’s more, in a recent interview with the Hoover Institution, Andreessen quoted Yarvin and called him a “friend.”\n\nWhat’s even more alarming is that Yarvin’s outsize influence on tech executives has now made its way to Washington. The signs are everywhere: Yarvin was a feted guest at Trump’s so-called “Coronation Ball” in January 2025. Vice President J.D. Vance, a protegee of Thiel’s, spoke admiringly of the blogger’s influence on his thinking when interviewed on a podcast in July 2024. And while Andreessen’s role in the Trump White House is unofficial, The Washington Post reported in January 2025 that the executive “has been quietly and successfully recruiting candidates for positions across Trump’s Washington.” Meanwhile, Elon Musk, though not outwardly tipping his hat to Yarvin, seemingly has a similar philosophy: In 2020, Musk told the Wall Street Journal that the “government is simply the largest corporation.” Five years later, Musk has been using his position as an unofficial advisor to the second Trump administration and the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) to operationalize what Yarvin has called “a hard reboot” of the government.\n\nRead More: Inside Elon Musk’s War on Washington As such, it behooves us to be more familiar with Yarvin and other associated figureheads of this far-right philosophy. Understanding their motivations is essential to understanding what the stakes currently are—and how history can repeat itself. Much can be gleaned about the attractions of this ideology to many of those in power from simply parsing the name of the movement. “Dark Enlightenment” portends the upending of the liberal order that has defined democratic aspirations for nearly three centuries. Where the Enlightenment promised liberty, emancipation, equality, and solidarity, “Dark Enlightenment” offers servitude, hierarchy, bondage, and ruthlessness. The movement is most often associated with the British philosopher Nick Land. Land was a founder of the Cybernetic Culture Research Unit at the University of Warwick in the United Kingdom until 1995 when his own increasingly erratic behavior had him expelled. Land is actively anti-democratic, desiring a system where great men (guided by algorithms and artificial intelligence) steer the ship of state. This is an explicitly nihilistic vision—“Nothing human makes it out of the near-future,” wrote Land in 1994—an ideology combining technological utopianism with deep misanthropy, a variant of what the historian Jeffrey Herf described as “reactionary modernism,” but which we might as well call cybernetic authoritarianism or technological fascism.\n\nThis leads us to Yarvin. A polemical blogger, Yarvin wrote for years under the goofy name “Mencius Moldbug” where he advocated for his own form of techno-authoritarianism in opposition to democracy. Like Marinetti, Yarvin expressed disdain for those symbols of American culture that he sees as oppositional to “Dark Enlightenment”—from free voting to free inquiry, a vibrant media to the open university. Yarvin, writing in 2021, posited (with significantly less poetry than the Futurists), “Because the university is the heart of the old regime, it is absolutely essential to the success of any regime change that all accredited universities be both physically and economically liquidated.” Yarvin speaks disparagingly of something that he calls “The Cathedral,” a nexus of educational, media, and nonprofit organizations that he believes sets the tenor for discourse, but that also impedes the liberty of executives to do what they will. Rather his aspiration is, as he wrote in 2007, that “the state is simply a real estate business on a very large scale.”\n\nUsing a variety of mixed metaphors, Yarvin advocates for a “Butterfly Revolution,” a “full power start” to the U.S. government accomplished by “giving absolute sovereignty to a single organization.\" This is imagined as an internal coup meant to privatize the government and replace democracy with complete executive authority. Two years ago, Yarvin laid out his strategic program with the acronym “RAGE,” or “Retire all government employees.” Yarvin argued that a hypothetical future Trump administration should terminate all nonpolitical federal workers to have them be replaced by loyalists. The government’s coffers must then be impounded and redirected, according to the blogger. When courts prevent unconstitutional orders, Yarvin says that they should just be ignored. After that, the free press and universities must be curtailed, as well—Yarvin said no later than April after the inauguration.\n\nThat so much of this seems to mirror the actions of the Trump administration and DOGE may not be a coincidence. So far, some 30,000 federal employees—across departments as varied as the FDA, the National Park Service, and the FAA—have been fired by DOGE in the name of government efficiency. Yarvin’s musings in 2009 that the “definition of a sovereign is that a sovereign is above the law,” hold a mirror to Trump’s February tweet that “He who save his country, violates no law.”\n\nYarvin’s claim that “No brand or building can survive” is perfectly congruent with the tech industry’s notorious ethos to “Move fast and break things.” But what’s also being seemingly witnessed is a harbinger of the “monarchism” that Yarvin desires. On February 19, Trump posted a doctored image of himself in a crown with the caption “Long Live the King!” on his social media app Truth Social.\n\nAs is so often the case with Trump, pundits have a tendency to assume a lack of seriousness or intention with what the president says. The same dismissiveness sometimes accompanied the Futurists, and Mussolini’s fascists for that matter, when they were ascendant. Now, as Trump threatens longtime American allies from Panama to Mexico, Canada to Denmark, a belief of the Futurists even more disturbing than their worship of technology should be remembered: Marinetti’s claim that “War is the hygiene of the world.”",

        "source": "https://time.com/",
        "content": "WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. — President Donald Trump said Sunday that “I’m not joking” about trying to serve a third term, the clearest indication he is considering ways to breach a constitutional barrier against continuing to lead the country after his second term ends at the beginning of 2029. “There are methods which you could do it,” Trump said in a telephone interview with NBC News from Mar-a-Lago, his private club. He elaborated later to reporters on Air Force One from Florida to Washington that \"I have had more people ask me to have a third term, which in a way is a fourth term because the other election, the 2020 election was totally rigged.” Trump lost that election to Democrat Joe Biden.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nStill, Trump added: “I don’t want to talk about a third term now because no matter how you look at it, we’ve got a long time to go.” Read More: Donald Trump Keeps Teasing a Third Term. Here’s What to Know The 22nd Amendment, added to the Constitution in 1951 after President Franklin D. Roosevelt was elected four times in a row, says “no person shall be elected to the office of the President more than twice.” Any attempt to remain in office would be legally suspect and it is unclear how seriously Trump might pursue the idea. The comments nonetheless were an extraordinary reflection of the desire to maintain power by a president who had violated democratic traditions four years ago when he tried to overturn the election he lost to Biden. “This is yet another escalation in his clear effort to take over the government and dismantle our democracy,\" said a statement from Rep. Daniel Goldman, a New York Democrat who served as lead counsel for Trump's first impeachment. \"If Congressional Republicans believe in the Constitution, they will go on the record opposing Trump’s ambitions for a third term.”\n\nSteve Bannon, a former Trump strategist who runs the right-wing “War Room” podcast, called for the president to run again during a speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference last month. \"We want Trump in ’28,\" he said. Kayla Thompson, a 30-year-old former paralegal in Wisconsin, said she would “absolutely” like Trump to serve another term. “America needs him. America is headed in the right direction and, if he doesn’t do it, we’re probably headed backwards,\" said Thompson, who was attending a campaign event Sunday with Elon Musk in Green Bay for a state Supreme Court race. Jeremy Paul, a constitutional law professor at Boston’s Northeastern University, said \"there are no credible legal arguments for him to run for a third term.” NBC's Kristen Welker asked Trump if one potential avenue to a third term was having Vice President JD Vance run for the top job and “then pass the baton to you.”\n\n“Well, that’s one,” Trump responded. “But there are others too. There are others.” “Can you tell me another?” Welker asked. “No,” Trump replied. Vance’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment from The Associated Press. Read More: For 2026, Trump Bolsters Young Upstarts to Carry MAGA Torch Derek Muller, a professor of election law at Notre Dame, noted that the 12th Amendment, which was ratified in 1804, says “no person constitutionally ineligible to the office of President shall be eligible to that of Vice-President of the United States.” Muller said that indicates that if Trump is not eligible to run for president again because of the 22nd Amendment, he is not eligible to run for vice president, either. “I don’t think there’s any ‘one weird trick’ to getting around presidential term limits,” Muller said. In addition, pursuing a third term would require extraordinary acquiescence by federal and state officials, not to mention the courts and voters themselves.\n\nHe suggested that Trump is talking about a third term for political reasons to “show as much strength as possible.” “A lame-duck president like Donald Trump has every incentive in the world to make it seem like he’s not a lame duck,” he said. Trump, who would be 82 at the end of his second term, was asked whether he would want to keep serving in “the toughest job in the country” at that point. “Well, I like working,” the president said. Trump suggested that Americans would go along with a third term because of his popularity. He falsely claimed to have “the highest poll numbers of any Republican for the last 100 years.” Gallup data shows President George W. Bush reaching a 90% approval rating after the attacks on Sept. 11, 2001. His father, President George H.W. Bush, hit 89% following the Gulf War in 1991. Trump has maxed out at 47% in Gallup data during his second term, despite claiming to be \"in the high 70s in many polls, in the real polls.”\n\nTrump has mused before about serving longer than two terms before, generally with jokes to friendly audiences.\n\n“Am I allowed to run again?” he said during a House Republican retreat in January.\n\nRepresentatives for the congressional leadership — House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York, Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., and Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York — did not immediately respond to requests for comment from the AP.\n\n—Associated Press writers Tom Beaumont in Green Bay, Wisconsin, and Gary Fields in Washington contributed to this report.",

On the federal level, climate change was first acknowledged as a national security threat by President George W.

The issue has typically been included on the annual threat assessment list because of its destabilizing impact—both domestically and abroad. “The annual threat assessment is projecting forward about where the areas of concern and the areas of competition [are], and where the U.S. national security sector should be focusing its attention,” says Nevitt. “Because climate change is just destabilizing different parts of the world, through extreme weather, through droughts, through sea level rise…the intelligence community wants to be ready for future conflicts and future areas of competition.”\n\nClimate change is often referred to as a “threat multiplier” by the intelligence community, because it aggravates already existing problems, while also creating new ones. “It takes things that we were already worried about, like extremism or terrorism, and exacerbates the scale or nature of those threats,” says Scott Moore, practice professor of political science, with a focus on climate and security, at the University of Pennsylvania. “If you have these intensified climate change impacts, they place stress on things like food systems, and worsen already existing tensions within countries.” Climate migration, for example, is on the rise around the world—more than half of new internal displacements within countries registered in 2023 were caused by weather related disasters, according to the Migration Data Portal. “Mass migration leads to a lot of political and social tensions as well as border issues,” says Karen Seto, professor of geography and urbanization science at the Yale School of the Environment. “That … could affect national security, because it could destabilize an entire region.” One study from the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences found that extreme weather is contributing to migration into the United States through the southern border—with more migrants from agricultural regions in Mexico settling in the United States following extreme drought.\n\nSuch displacement can have major impacts on people's lives and livelihoods, experts say—especially in already fragile regions. “If you have, for example, a really extreme and intensified drought in a country in which extremist ideologies are percolating, these climate change impacts may make it more likely that people are going to stop farming, or might migrate to cities where they may face difficult employment prospects, be socially dislocated and may be more vulnerable to extremism or engaging in some type of violence,” says Moore. On a domestic level, considering climate change helps the U.S. military ensure that infrastructure is built to withstand extreme weather events—and respond to national disasters both domestically and abroad. “You need the National Guard, the Coast Guard, the U.S. military, to basically help out their community when there's an extreme weather event,” says Nevitt. As extreme weather events intensify with climate change this could strain military resources and put more lives at risk if the military does not prepare to address the threat.\n\nInfrastructure within the U.S., like energy and internet grids, also need to be fortified. If regions were to lose power in the case of an extreme weather event, the networks could be vulnerable to attack. “Our energy grid is highly at risk, and we've seen wildfires happening across the country, and so these could again be threat multipliers,\" says Seto. “I think the national security risk is that we are not ready to respond to any threats from foreign agents that may take advantage of the weaknesses that we might have.” Showing that the climate crisis is a priority is also necessary to maintain the United States’s diplomatic strength—especially in regions that see climate change as a top concern. “Other countries, in particular countries that are very significant for the U.S. defense posture, like the Pacific Island countries, really care about climate change a lot. They want to hear what the United States is willing to do to help them deal with climate change,” says Moore. “And so when you have the instructions to essentially ignore climate change, or in an extreme version almost censor mention of climate change, that's going to have a harmful effect on diplomatic engagement with some pretty important countries.”\n\nAnd experts say that removing climate change from the list—and deprioritizing the issue writ large—is only going to leave the U.S. more vulnerable. “This is going to make the administration and national security sector less nimble, because they might not have the people, the plans, the policy, [and] capacity in place when disaster inevitably strikes,” warns Nevitt. “You can't just wish climate change away.”",

        "source": "https://time.com/",
        "content": "Fellow actors, industry figures, fans, and family are mourning the death of Val Kilmer. Kilmer died from pneumonia at age 65 on April 1, according to his daughter Mercedes. The award-winning actor, who starred in 80s and 90s blockbusters Top Gun and Batman Forever and was also known for portraying musician Jim Morrison in Oliver Stone’s The Doors, was diagnosed with throat cancer in 2014 and recovered after two tracheotomies but severely damaged his vocal chords. A critically-acclaimed 2021 documentary about his career and health struggles, Val, showcased hundreds of hours of footage of Kilmer through the years and was narrated by Kilmer’s son Jack. TIME film critic Stephanie Zacharek said in a review of Val that the documentary “draws us deep into the life and career of a bold and sometimes headstrong performer” and offers “a portrait of an actor who poured his all into his work.”\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nKilmer once held a reputation of being hard to work with, but others said he was simply serious about his craft—which also extended to television, theatre, poetry, and memoir. Film critic Roger Ebert said of Kilmer in 1992, “if there is an award for the most unsung leading man of his generation, Kilmer should get it.” Kilmer reflected on his legacy in Val. “I have behaved poorly. I have behaved bravely. I have behaved bizarrely to some,” he said. “I deny none of this and have no regrets because I have lost and found parts of myself that I never knew existed. And I am blessed.” Tributes from Hollywood friends, colleagues, and admirers have started pouring in since the news of Kilmer’s death. “See ya, pal. I’m going to miss you. You were a smart, challenging, brave, uber-creative firecracker. There’s not a lot left of those,” actor Josh Brolin posted on Instagram. “I hope to see you up there in the heavens when I eventually get there. Until then, amazing memories, lovely thoughts.”\n\n“After so many years of Val battling disease and maintaining his spirit, this is tremendously sad news,” filmmaker Michael Mann, who directed Kilmer in the 1995 action film Heat, told the Hollywood Reporter, adding that he “always marvelled at the range, the brilliant variability within the powerful current of Val’s possessing and expressing character.” “Remembering Val Kilmer, whose indelible cinematic mark spanned genres and generations. RIP Iceman,” the official Top Gun movie account on X posted, referencing the name of Kilmer’s fan-favorite character in the franchise. Visual effects studio Industrial Light & Magic, which worked on the 1988 film Willow, shared a photo of Kilmer as the film’s character Madmartigan. “We are deeply saddened to learn of the passing of our friend and colleague, Val Kilmer,” the studio posted on Threads. “From his memorable roles as Madmartigan, Iceman, Doc Holliday, and Jim Morrison, Val cemented himself as one of the greats. He will be deeply missed and our thoughts are with his family at this time.”\n\nLucasfilm executive Pablo Hidalgo posted on BlueSky, “Oh man, not Val Kilmer. His comedic chops were top notch but he had a fascinating storm roiling beneath the surface.” “RIP Val Kilmer. If it wasn’t for our chance encounter at the Source [a Hollywood restaurant] in 1985, I may never have been cast in FULL METAL JACKET. Thanks, Val,” actor Matthew Modine posted on X. Film critic Richard Roeper said Kilmer deserved Best Supporting Actor award nominations for his roles in Heat and 1993 western Tombstone. “He was a brilliant presence in some of the most enduring films of his generation. Rest well. Thank you for the incredible work,” Roeper posted on X. Author Don Winslow called Kilmer a “brilliant actor and a good man” in a tribute on X. Bill Simmons, founder of the sports and pop culture website The Ringer, posted on X: “There wasn’t anyone quite like Val Kilmer. Really enjoyed his work. RIP.”\n\n“You fought so valiantly Val. Your kindness and your heart will always be remembered by me professionally,” entertainment industry publicist Danny Deraney posted on X. “As a kid, your films put a stamp on me that will never be forgotten. Rest in power Val Kilmer. You earned it.”\n\nComedian and writer Mike Drucker posted on Bluesky: “Val Kilmer felt like an actor who, no matter what the material, always understood the assignment.”\n\nWriter-director Dylan Park-Pettiford posted, “Listen, Val Kilmer had me wanting to fly fighter jets, be Batman, rob banks, and hunt lions as a kid. They don’t make too many movie stars like him anymore. Generational.”\n\n“Thank you for defining so many of the movies of my childhood,” actor Josh Gad wrote in an Instagram post. “You truly were an icon.”\n\nDirector David Zucker, who cast Kilmer in 1984's Top Secret!, shared: \"I am especially sad to hear of Val's passing, and although we had been in communication over the years - we lived on the same street, shared an attorney and I was aware of his condition - I find myself still a bit shocked to lose him. My brother Jerry, Jim Abrahams and I, had the distinction of giving Val Kilmer his first movie role in Top Secret!. In his audition he broke into an impromptu Elvis song and blew us away!\"",

        "source": "https://time.com/",
        "content": "The three gold medals that sprinter Gabby Thomas won at the Paris Olympics last summer are currently resting in what is, she says, their proper place: her sock drawer. She’s stuck her silver and bronze from Tokyo in there too.\n\nThomas, 28, is in no rush to build any sort of living-room shrine to her athletic accomplishments. “The medals are truly just objects for me,” she says. “I don't look at them and genuinely feel like, ‘Oh my God, those are so cool.’” One day, she may enjoy staring at all that precious metal, as a reminder of past glories. But now is not that time. “I genuinely feel like I'm not done yet,” says Thomas. “I’m still on my journey. I'm still in that process. I have so many more to come.”\n\nPlus, her life is more than mere medals. When her track career comes to a close, Thomas has designs on leading a nonprofit organization like Austin’s Volunteer Healthcare Clinic, where she has helped manage fellow workers, interacted with patients—many of whom are uninsured and live in underserved Latino communities—and arranged for one of her sponsors, New Balance, to donate shoes. “What I do now only fuels that thought,” says Thomas, who wrote her master’s thesis at the University of Texas about racial disparities in sleep epidemiology, after majoring in neurobiology and global health as a Harvard undergrad. “We see the difference that we make in the community. We are, in fact, bridging that racial health disparity gap, which is really important to me.”\n\nOne woman who received new footwear at the clinic last spring was moved to tears and shared with Thomas that she was going through some personal turmoil. “It felt like somebody was looking out for her,” says Thomas. “You feel alone and you're in a dark place, and something so small can make a big difference.”\n\nAfter the Paris Olympics, where Thomas won the 200 m and pair of relay golds in the 4x100 and 4x400, she headlined Athlos NYC, a female-only track event backed by Reddit co-founder and venture capitalist Alexis Ohanian. Athlos doled out a record prize purse, including $60,000 for the winner of each of the six sprint and middle-distance races. Thomas finished second in the 200 m. Megan Thee Stallion provided the post-race entertainment. “It was a great cultural moment for us,” says Thomas. “Because when you actually look at who's running track and field, most of us are Black women. And we had an event that really celebrated that.”\n\nOver these past few months, Thomas has also appeared on the cover of Vogue, snapped a picture with Rihanna at an awards show, attended Fashion Week, and served as grand marshal of the New York City Marathon. Now she’s training for the upcoming season, which includes the debut of Grand Slam Track, a new league founded by legendary sprinter Michael Johnson, likely another Athlos event, and world championships, where she’ll aim to win her first individual gold. These commitments have forced her to step away from her management role at the clinic, although she still regularly checks in on patients.\n\nGoing into the next Olympic cycle, Thomas has started strong off the blocks. “The gold medals, while they do add pressure, have given me a lot of confidence, have truly showed me what I'm capable of,” says Thomas. “So I'm definitely looking forward to the next couple of years. The fact that LA 2028 is in America, in my home country, I just don't think it could be wrapped more beautifully for me.”",

        "content": "'A hostile state': Why some travellers are avoiding the US\n\n3 days ago Share Save Lindsey Galloway Share Save\n\nGetty Images (Credit: Getty Images)\n\nAs the list of nations issuing travel warnings to the US grows, some visitors are opting to boycott it entirely. Here's why many foreigners are changing their travel plans and what this could mean for Americans.\n\nAs President Donald Trump implements sweeping new policies, issues tariffs on longtime allies and leads an immigration crackdown, some international travellers are rethinking their travel plans to the US.\n\nThe cold shoulder has been particularly noticeable from the US's northern neighbour, Canada, which sends more than 20 million visitors to the country per year – more than any other nation. In response to Trump's proposed tariffs and repeated threats to annex the nation, former prime minister Justin Trudeau recently urged his fellow Canadians: \"Now is the time to choose Canada,\" adding, \"it might mean changing your summer vacation plans to stay here in Canada.\"\n\nAlamy Justin Trudeau recently urged Canadians to stay in Canada instead of travelling to the US (Credit: Alamy)\n\nThe appeal seems to have caught on, as many infuriated Canadians are now boycotting US holidays. In February, border crossings were down by more than 20%, according to Statistics Canada. The US Travel Association estimates that even a 10% reduction in Canadian visitors could result in $2.1bn in lost spending and 14,000 job losses.\n\nWhile some Canadians are snubbing the US because of policy changes, others say they simply don't feel as safe as they once did.\n\n\"My partner and I decided not to go ahead with our planned vacations to the US this year,\" said Canadian travel journalist Kate Dingwall. \"I worry about the border and getting stuck somehow, especially with how prickly Trump is to Canada. There's just a sense of uneasiness around visiting America at the moment.\"\n\nKeith Serry, a writer and comedian based in Montreal, Quebec, cancelled five April appearances in New York City (including four shows at the upcoming New York City Fringe festival) due to the tense political situation.\n\n\"This decision will, of course, rob me of the opportunity to share my art with many of you in New York I've grown to know and love,\" he wrote on his Facebook page. \"That said, the honest truth is that I just don't feel safe travelling to the States right now. In addition, I feel a powerful disinclination to spending my money in any way that might aid the economy of a hostile state.\"\n\nAlamy Some international travellers have been inexplicably detained by US officials (Credit: Alamy)\n\nIn recent months, some Canadians have faced tougher border security than ever before – even those with clean records and valid documents. One woman made international headlines as she was detained by ICE for two weeks in reportedly bleak conditions after her visa was revoked.\n\n\"We're a country that prides itself, imperfectly but intentionally, on values like inclusion, equity and human rights. When those values feel out of step with what's happening across the border, it becomes harder to justify participation,\" said Amar Charles Marouf, a Canadian citizen who works as growth strategist at the international law firm Gowling WLG. \"The political climate raises broader questions. What kind of treatment are we normalising? What assumptions are being made about who is welcome and who isn’t?\"\n\nIt's not that Canadians aren't traveling internationally; many are simply swapping their traditional destinations. Marouf says Mexico, South America and Europe all feel more welcoming at the moment. \"California will be there when this is all over, but I just feel like there's less risk going to Portugal instead,\" added Dingwall.\n\nSome international properties have seen a bump in traffic, directly attributable to Canadians now spurning the US. \"In the last several weeks, we've received 10-plus leads from Canadians seeking to relocate events from the United States this summer,\" said Diarmaid O'Sullivan, director of sales & marketing at Hamilton Princess Hotel & Beach Club Bermuda. \"This is a mix of leisure travellers, including those planning weddings, and companies relocating business events. This represents an approximately 20% increase in forecasted revenue from the Canadian market.\"\n\nAlamy Ironically, the US had recently been touted as the world's top tourism market (Credit: Alamy)\n\nInterestingly, all of this is happening just as the US had been experiencing record growth in the travel and tourism sector. Marta Soligo, professor at UNLV and director of Tourism Research at the UNLV Office of economic development, points to The World Travel & Tourism Council (WTTC)'s 2024 Economic Impact Trends Report, which showed the US as the world's top travel and tourism market. Not only did the industry achieve an unprecedented economic impact of $2.36tn in the US, but the US Bureau of Labor Statistics projections indicate that the US economy will add more than 800,000 jobs in the leisure and hospitality sector.\n\n\"Such numbers help us understand the importance of the sector in the US, showing that a decrease in tourism from top-origin countries could significantly damage the US economy,\" said Soligo. \"The consequences of these issues can impact both large US-based corporations, such as hotel chains, and small businesses alike.\"\n\nThe change in travel patterns is already having a tangible effect on the US economy. Tourism Economics recently updated its inbound US travel forecast from a predicted 8.8% growth, to a 5.1% decline, attributing the change to \"strained\" travel sentiment, \"sweeping tariffs\" and \"exchange rate shifts\" making travel to the US more expensive.\n\n\"The combination of travel bans and a reduction of US travel could have a material impact on tourism and economic development,\" said Jeff Le, former deputy cabinet secretary for the State of California and the state's federal coordinator during the first Trump Administration.\n\nAlamy International travellers to California contributed $24bn in 2023 (Credit: Alamy)\n\nIn California alone, international visitors provided more than $24bn in local economies in 2023, reports Le. \"Losing this would likely hurt both people and local government funds,\" he said. \"It is harder to measure reputational loss, but I cannot imagine active boycotts help.\"\n\nWhile the broad impact of boycotting travel to the US could have substantial national and governmental effects, some advocacy organisations also warn that the loss of tourism dollars is most likely to be felt by individuals.\n\n\"It's US workers and small businesses who get affected by US travel boycotts,\" said Thomas F Goodwin, leader of the Exhibitions and Conferences Alliance. Goodwin notes that more than 99% of the US business and professional events industry is made up of small businesses, and more than 80% of all exhibitors are US and international small businesses. \"When international business travellers forgo coming to the US, everyone from exposition booth builders and general service contractors to venue caterers and individual skilled labourers suffer – not politicians or the government. Boycotts have a knock-on effect on hotels, taxis, restaurants, local entertainers, high street commerce and more.\"\n\nThere is also a cost that is harder to quantify: the global influence of American culture.\n\nAlamy Hotels, restaurants and local businesses are likely to feel the effect of travel boycotts (Credit: Alamy)\n\n\"Visitor numbers declining in the US sends a signal that the US is losing its soft power – the influence it once held through openness, cultural leadership and global goodwill,\" said Neri Karra Sillaman, entrepreneurship expert at the University of Oxford and author of the forthcoming book Pioneers: 8 Principles of Business Longevity from Immigrant Entrepreneurs. \"If this trend continues, it may force tourism boards or even local governments to create counter narratives to win back trust. I am not sure if it will be effective, however, since at the end of the day, it is the policies of the government that give the ultimate direction and influence perception.\"\n\nSillaman notes that travel boycotts also have a long-term cost to culture, the economy and overall innovation. \"When academics, scientists, artists, designers and entrepreneurs start to choose other countries instead of US, the US is going to lose more than just visitors,\" she said. \"In the long term, it's going to lose its competitiveness, goodwill and it will turn into a closed society that stifles growth and innovation.\"\n\nAlamy Fewer travellers suggest the US may be losing its power and influence (Credit: Alamy)\n\nThis human impact of boycotts also shows up in a myriad of ways, noted Missouri lawyer John Beck. \"I've worked with hundreds of non-citizens over the last 15 years and seen firsthand how policies between governments can result in individuals – regular travellers, students, families – getting caught in the middle,\" he said. \"It's rarely about the politics. It's about missed weddings, lost business deals or being unable to visit a dying parent.\"\n\nBeck says he has worked with at least 80 clients who have either delayed or cancelled US travel due to real or perceived hostility over the past few years. This causes complications with split families, international companies who can't move talent quickly and lost business due to the lack of ease of movement. Even though the geopolitical stakes are high, there is a human aspect on both sides of the border.\n\n\"Most Americans have little to do with the policies that frustrate global travellers,\" he said. \"They just want safety, fairness and dignity. That's what we need to protect.\"\n\n--\n\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.",

        "content": "The return of Sicily's ancient 'white gold'\n\n5 days ago Share Save Vittoria Traverso Share Save\n\nAlamy (Credit: Alamy)\n\nIt's mentioned 17 times in the Bible and was harvested in the Mediterranean for more than a millennium. Now, a farmer is reviving this ancient \"superfood\".\n\nIt's a hot and muggy summer day in Sicily's Madonie mountains, a rugged range of ridges about 65km east of Palermo. In a field of ash trees, the buzzing of cicadas is interrupted by a voice. \"You came at the right time,\" says Giulio Gelardi, a local farmer pointing towards a white-streaked branch. \"This is the famous manna.\"\n\nAlong the bark of each tree are thick lines of manna, a white mineral-rich resin referenced in the Bible 17 times that has been used as a natural sweetener and medicinal aid for centuries. Manna harvesting (the practice of cutting the bark of Fraxinus ornus trees to collect their sap), used to be a common practice throughout the Mediterranean. But in the past 80 years, urbanisation and industrialisation have led to it nearly vanishing.\n\nFor the past 30 years, Gelardi has made it his mission to put this Biblical superfood back on our tables, and today, this once-forgotten sap is being used by chefs and pastry makers in innovative ways.\n\nVittoria Traverso Manna is a white mineral-rich resin that has been harvested for more than a millennium (Credit: Vittoria Traverso)\n\nEven if you've never tasted manna, you may have heard of it. The phrase \"manna from heaven\" refers to a Biblical story where a food falls from the sky to nourish the Israelites as they crossed the Sinai desert. In Exodus, manna is described as a \"flaky substance as fine as frost blanketed on the ground\". While experts disagree what substance, specifically, this passage refers to, a honey-like, flaky and frost-coloured resin named manna has been extracted from the bark of ash trees in the Mediterranean region for more than a millennium.\n\nIn the Madonie mountains – home to the 40,000-hectare Madonie Natural Park – manna harvesting dates back to at least the 9th Century when the island was under Arab rule. During the Renaissance, Sicilian farmers used to collect this sweet sap – which tastes like cane sugar with almond undertones – and sell it to merchants from around the Mediterranean, a highly profitable trade that led the Kingdom of Naples to put taxes on it during the 16th Century.\n\nUntil World War Two, manna farming was a way of life for many Sicilian families. Footage from 1936 shows local farmers harvesting the substance, which was commonly sold to pharmaceutical companies to extract mannitol, a sugar alcohol used as a sweetener and a diuretic. In the 1950s, scientists found a way to synthesise mannitol, and in the decades that followed, manna harvesting virtually disappeared.\n\nWhen Gelardi came back to his hometown of Pollina in 1985 after 15 years away, he realised that one of the core components of his local culture was vanishing. \"When I was growing up, everyone knew how to extract manna,\" he explains. \"When I came back, there were less than 100 farmers who could still do it.\"\n\nAlamy Pollina is a medieval hilltop town surrounded by the Madonie mountains (Credit: Alamy)\n\nPollina is a 3,000-person medieval town that seems sculpted out of the surrounding limestone hills. As a child, Gelardi learned to harvest manna in the summer from his parents. \"Manna harvesting involved the whole family,\" he explains. Men used handmade billhooks to make thin cuts along the bark, women collected the overflowing sap using dried prickly pear stems and children turned the goopy nectar into cylindrical cones called cannoli, due to their resemblance to the popular Sicilian sweet.\n\nAccording to Gelardi, the hardest part of manna harvesting is knowing when to cut the bark. Ash trees produce sap year-round but only produce enough resin to harvest during the hottest days of the year. Gelardi says if you cut the bark too early, it can cause the trees to stop making manna altogether. \"Finding out when the moment for cutting has come is a unique skill based on observation and intuition,\" he says, explaining: \"[It's necessary to] listen to each plant.\"\n\nFor example, leaves turning from dark green to lighter green with yellow marks may mean that a tree has reached peak manna production. Spotting cracks in the ground near the roots can also mean it's ready for harvest, as plants produce surplus sap to overcome dry spells. When the tree looks ready, manna farmers make a shallow cut in the bark and observe the plant's reaction. If a plant is mature enough, a small amount of resin will ooze from the cut. Farmers can then proceed to make deeper carvings, as small streams of sticky manna will flow towards the roots.\n\n\"Manna harvesting is not something you can learn from a book,\" Gelardi explains. \"If we don't pass these skills down to the next generation, we would lose centuries-old local farming knowledge.\"\n\nVittoria Traverso Gelardi has made it his mission to revive the ancient practice of manna harvesting in his hometown of Pollina (Credit: Vittoria Traverso)\n\nA few months after returning to Pollina, Gelardi set out to revive the waning tradition. At first, most locals did not meet his \"manna renaissance\" with enthusiasm. \"My friends thought I was crazy. They said manna was a thing of the past,\" he says. Undeterred, Gelardi spent months learning all he could about it.\n\nHe spent time with elder farmers to refine his harvesting skills and visited Palermo's public library to study manna. \"I knew manna was used locally as a sweetener, a moisturiser and a diuretic,\" he says. \"But I learned that it could also be used to treat food intoxication, a variety of skin conditions, arthritis and cold symptoms.\"\n\nGelardi also started to realise how manna shaped local geography and culture. For example, Gibilmanna, a nearby hill home to a famous sanctuary, owes its name to the Arab words \"gibil\" (mountain) and \"manna\". Local expressions are also shaped by manna, like the local phrase, \"vivere di mieli e manna\" (\"to live of honey and manna\"), meaning living an affluent life.\n\nIn 1986 Gelardi began handing out pamphlets containing facts about manna to tourists staying at a nearby resort. \"People were captivated by manna's healing properties and its impact on local culture,\" he recalls. By the 1990s, he was leading tours demonstrating how to harvest manna to international travellers. \"They started to see it as our local superfood,\" he says.\n\nVittoria Traverso Gelardi developed a new and more efficient way to harvest manna (Credit: Vittoria Traverso)\n\nManna is mostly composed of mannitol, a naturally sweet crystal compound, as well as minerals like potassium, magnesium and calcium. According to Vivienne Spadaro, a professor of botany at the University of Palermo, this thick white resin can be used as a dietary supplement to reintegrate minerals, especially potassium, and as a base for several medicines. \"Manna has been used to treat constipation, cough, sore-throats and skin wounds due to its decongestant and soothing properties,\" she says. And because of its low glycemic index, Spadaro says some manna can be used as a sweetener for diabetic people or those on hypo-caloric diets.\n\nWhere to find manna In addition to Hostaria Cycas and Nangalarruni, look for manna at La Manna di Zabbra. This family-owned B&B and restaurant in Pollina offers a salad of local edible flowers sprinkled with manna flakes as well as jams. If you visit between July and August, you can witness the century-old process of manna harvesting in the family’s ash tree field.\n\nWhile leading manna tours, Gelardi developed a more efficient way to harvest the substance with far less risk of contamination from bark or insects. He created a \"clean manna\" technique by attaching a small aluminum spout to the tree so that manna flows away from the trunk along a fishing line attached to the spout. This allowed Gelardi to nearly double his manna production.\n\nIn the following years, Gelardi started selling his manna to bakers and pastry chefs, who incorporated it into everything from cannoli, wafers, flakes and chocolates. He also sold manna to pharmacies to make laxatives, minerals supplements and skin products. In recent years French skincare companies Biotherm and Yves Roche have used it to make skin moisturisers.\n\nIn 2002, manna from the Madonie was declared a protected ingredient by Slow Food, an international organisation that promotes endangered food traditions. By the mid-2000s, manna became a sought-after ingredient for local chefs and pastry-makers.\n\nAlamy Today, manna is used by a variety of local and international chefs, including in nearby Castelbuono, Sicily (Credit: Alamy)\n\n\"I started using manna to make pandolce (fruitcake) with manna and almonds, but then realised it goes well with savoury dishes, too,\" says Giuseppe Zingales, chef at Hostaria Cycas in the nearby medieval village of Castelbuono. The restaurant offers many manna-infused dishes, including manna-crusted pork tenderloin; risotto with asparagus, bacon and manna; and wild thistle flan with manna fondue. At another Castelbuono eatery, Ristorante Nangalarruni, chefs Peppe Carollo and his daughter Francesca use crushed manna to create one of the restaurant's signature dishes: suckling pig with almonds, pistachio and manna crust.\n\n\"The key is to [use] it well,\" Francesca Carollo explains, \"A small portion of sweet-tasting manna offers a nice contrast to roast meat flavour, but too much manna can make this dish too sweet.\"\n\nPastry chefs are particularly interested in manna. Nicola Fiasconaro, one of Italy's most famous patissiers, now produces a special edition of panettone, Italy's traditional Christmas fruitcake, made with chocolate and frosted manna, while Michelin-starred chef Davide Oldani featured chocolate-covered manna sticks as part of the menu of his Milan-area restaurant D'O from 2014 to 2016. In recent years, the Madonie's \"white gold\", as it is sometimes called, has reached a price of €200 per kg and has been used to make a variety of sugar-free baked goods, from muffins to biscotti.\n\nMost chefs buy manna from the Madonie's Manna Consortium, a cooperative created in 2015 by Gelardi and other farmers to market manna products and promote manna harvesting to younger farmers.\n\nAlamy Nicola Fiasconaro's pastry shop in Castelbuono sells manna flakes (Credit: Alamy)\n\n\"I grew up hearing about manna but had never learned how to harvest it,\" says Mario Cicero, who belongs to the Consortium. Born in Castelbuono, he spent years working around the world as a chef before returning to the Madonie. As part of his training, Cicero spent months with older farmers, including Gelardi. \"Giulio's taught me many tricks,\" he says, \"but he mostly passed on a contagious passion for manna harvesting.\" Cicero now tends 200 ash trees in his farm near Castelbuono and hopes that more young people will take up manna harvesting.\n\nSeeing young farmers like Cicero becoming ntaccaluori (Sicilian for \"cutters\") is what Gelardi is most proud about. As he explains: \"Every young person that learns how to harvest manna will ensure the survival of a centuries-old tradition.\"\n\n--\n\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.",

        "content": "'The forgotten Monet': How masterful paintings by the artist's stepdaughter are finally getting recognition\n\n15 hours ago Share Save Lucy Davies Share Save\n\nArt Institute of Chicago/ Arthur M Wood/ Collection of Alice and Rick Johnson\n\nBlanche Hoschedé-Monet has barely been acknowledged in art history. But not only did she help her stepfather Claude, she created her own fine works – often of the same scenes as him.\n\nHaystack at Giverny, Poplars at the Water's Edge, Morning on the Seine. These painting titles bring only one name to mind – the great Claude Monet, whose flickering evocations of light and atmosphere are the cornerstone of Impressionism.\n\nBut while Monet painted these very subjects, the paintings belong to the oeuvre of his stepdaughter, and subsequently daughter-in-law, Blanche Hoschedé-Monet (1865–1947). She learned to paint at Monet's shoulder, and exhibited and sold her work through the leading Parisian dealers of the time. Her finest paintings suggest an artist of such flair that you wonder how she has slipped from history's grasp.\n\nAlamy/ Collection of Alice and Rick Johnson Claude Monet's Morning on the Seine near Giverny (1897) and Blanche Hoschedé-Monet's Morning on the Seine (c 1896) (Credit: Alamy/ Collection of Alice and Rick Johnson)\n\nA new exhibition and accompanying monograph – the artist's first – seeks to restore her reputation. Blanche Hoschedé-Monet in the Light at The Sidney and Lois Eskenazi Museum of Art, Indiana, brings together 40 of her paintings, along with sketchbooks, photographs and letters, establishing not just her impressionist credentials, but her role as Monet's assistant and companion on plein air painting expeditions – the only one of his children, blood-related or otherwise, whose passion for painting mirrored his own.\n\nThe difficulty of extracting Hoschedé-Monet from history has been compounded by the fact that few of her 300-ish works are in public collections. In her native France, the former Musée Municipal de Vernon, near the Normandy village of Giverny, where the Monet family lived for decades, holds the largest number – eight paintings and one pastel – and was valiantly renamed the Musée Blanche Hoschedé-Monet last year to coincide with the 150th anniversary of Impressionism. Meanwhile Paris's Musée d'Orsay (widely regarded as the best collection of Impressionist art) has only a further two – neither of which, at the time of writing, is on display.\n\nWhile Blanche Hoschedé-Monet's work remains relatively unknown, it is clear that she is gaining more recognition with collectors and institutions – Julia Leveille\n\nThere are no Hoschedé-Monet paintings in British public collections at all, and in the US, only one, The Weeping Willows on the Lily Pond at Giverny (c 1893-7) at the Columbus Museum of Art in Ohio. The Indiana exhibition is the artist's first solo show on US soil, in fact, and an indication that her reputation is finally growing.\n\n\"While Hoschedé-Monet's work remains relatively unknown and somewhat underappreciated in the marketplace, it is clear that she is gaining more recognition with collectors and institutions,\" says Julia Leveille, head of modern-day auctions at Sotheby's New York.\" Strong prices have been set for her work at auction recently, and we are excited to see where her market goes from here.\"\n\nWhen Blanche came into Claude's life\n\nHoschedé-Monet was the daughter of Eugene Hoschedé, a wealthy businessman and connoisseur of avant-garde painting. Édouard Manet, Auguste Renoir, Gustave Caillebotte, Mary Cassatt and of course Monet were regular guests at his beautiful homes on the Boulevard Haussmann in Paris, and at his estate at Montgeron, on the city's edge.\n\nHoschedé-Monet was 11 when she first met Claude Monet in 1876. The then-35-year-old had been commissioned by her father to paint a quartet of panels for the dining room at Montgeron. Hoschedé was an important early patron of Monet's – in fact, it was he who bought Impression, Sunrise (1872), the painting that gave Impressionism its name.\n\nArt Institute of Chicago, Arthur M Wood/ Collection of Alice and Rick Johnson Claude Monet's Stacks of Wheat (End of Summer) and Blanche Hoschedé-Monet's The Small Grainstacks (Credit: Art Institute of Chicago, Collection of Alice and Rick Johnson)\n\n\"I remember his arrival. He was introduced to me as a great artist, and he had long hair,\" she recollected in autobiographical notes she wrote towards the end of her life, which her brother Jean-Pierre then used as a basis for a personal and intimate account of Monet's life and family at Giverny. \" That struck me, and I immediately had sympathy for him because we could tell he was fond of children.\"\n\nBlanche's touch is more emphatic than Monet's, out of concern for capturing what she saw on her canvas rather than what she felt – Philippe Piguet\n\nIn her notes, Hoschedé-Monet also singled out Monet's Springtime or The Reader (1872) as the painting she loved most in her father's considerable collection. She was \"deeply struck\", she said, by the touches of sunlight on the skirt of the woman – Monet's first wife, Camille.\n\nThe six months Monet spent at Montgeron in 1876 led to a magnificent set of paintings that includes the much-loved Turkeys and Willows at the River's Edge, though they did not remain in Hoschedé's possession for long. Dire financial pressures forced him to sell most of his collection in 1878, along with both of his homes.\n\nMonet brought Hoschedé, his wife Alice and their six children (Marthe, Blanche, Suzanne, Jacques, Germaine, and Jean-Pierre) to live with him, Camille and their two sons Jean, 11, and newborn Michel, at his home in Vétheuil, northwest of Paris.\n\nCamille's health deteriorated post-partum, however, and in 1879 she died, after which Alice and Monet entered into \"what we believe was a domestic partnership,\" says Haley Pierce, co-curator of Blanche Hoschedé-Monet in the Light. But they didn’t marry until 1892, after Hoschedé had passed away. [Hoschedé] had been estranged from the family for a while at this point.\"\n\nJuvenalia aside, the earliest works in the show date from 1882, when the newly-merged family rented a house in the seaside resort of Pourville, near Dieppe. Monet's painting Cliff Walk at Pourville features the then-17-year-old Hoschedé-Monet with her elder sister, Marthe, and Hoschedé-Monet filled a sketchbook with her own sunlit views.\n\nClark Art Institute/ Alamy Claude Monet's Spring in Giverny (1890) and Blanche Hoschedé-Monet's Shadows on the Meadow (Credit: Clark Art Institute/ Alamy)\n\nIn spring 1883, Monet moved the family to Giverny, where Hoschedé-Monet began to paint in earnest. Delighted by her enthusiasm, he began taking her with him on his outdoor painting expeditions. According to the biography of Hoschedé-Monet's which her brother Jean-Pierre also wrote, \"she helped him in all circumstances… transporting his canvases and easel as well as her own. She did it all with the help of a wheelbarrow, following elusive paths, across fields and meadows sometimes drenched in dew. That was the case, for example, with his morning views of the Seine. Here again, she would help her stepfather by taking up the oars of the canoe.\"\n\nMonet also suggested exhibitions she might enjoy. In 1891, for instance, he asked his friend Gustave Geffroy, an influential critic, to obtain a pass for her to the Salon of the Société Nationale des Beaux-Arts, and later that year, took her with him to dine at the home of the British artist James McNeill Whistler in London (they were visiting her brother Jacques in Lymington) and to see the famous Peacock Room that Whistler created for shipping magnate Frederick Leyland's mansion near Hyde Park.\n\nHow the two Monets compare\n\nMonet's 1887 painting In the Woods at Giverny: Blanche Hoschedé at Her Easel with Suzanne Hoschedé Reading, confirms that he and Hoschedé set up their easels within spitting distance of each other, or even, if she is the figure in the white dress at an easel in John Singer Sargent's oil sketch, Monet in his Bateau Atelier (also 1887), squashed together in the floating studio which Monet designed to paint while drifting along the river.\n\nUnsurprisingly, then, Hoschedé-Monet's paintings often share her mentor's visual vocabulary: Shadows on the Meadow (Giverny, the Ajoux plain) matches his Spring Landscape at Giverny (1894) for instance, and The Small Grainstacks (Les Moyettes) (c 1894) his Stacks of Wheat (End of Summer) (1890-91). Julie Manet, daughter of the impressionist Berthe Morisot and Manet's brother Eugène, would also describe two of Blanche's paintings of \"trees reflected in the Epte [that] are very like Monsieur Monet's painting\" while visiting Giverny in 1893.\n\nAs Hoschedé-Monet's great-nephew, the art historian Philippe Piguet, further explains, \"her touch is more emphatic, out of concern for capturing what she saw on her canvas rather than what she felt\" – meaning that Hoschedé-Monet's paintings can be described as more solid or direct in their rendering and composition, and less atmospheric, as compared to Monet. She also preferred to paint a subject from varying viewpoints, he adds, rather than, as Monet did, at different times of day.\n\nConsider her painting Haystack at Giverny alongside the Monet Haystacks at Giverny (1893) that was sold at Sotheby's last year. \"They're at the same or approximate location, but she has distinctly chosen a different view,\" says Pierce. \"Her painting is also more solid. She has less interest in the quality of atmosphere, and more in really getting down her subject. Her compositions are very well thought out.\"\n\nCollection of Philippe Piguet-Claude Monet The photo from July 1915 captures Claude Monet working at a painting, with Blanche by his side (Credit: Collection of Philippe Piguet-Claude Monet)\n\nBy now, Hoschedé-Monet was blooming. The previous year, the US artist Theodore Robinson noted in his diary: \"I saw some things by Mlle Blanche, she has improved greatly since I saw her work last – a spring landscape, sold to [the Chicago millionaire] Potter Palmer quite charming.\" Her rapid progress excited Monet, too: away in Norway in 1895, he wrote to Alice, \"I can't wait to see what she has done in my absence, especially from what you tell me\".\n\nIn 1897, Hoschedé-Monet married Jean and they moved to Rouen, but returned to Giverny at weekends. For a time, her upward trajectory continued – in 1905, she began exhibiting with the Salon des Indépendants in Paris, and in 1907 the Salon de la Société des Artistes Rouennais – but when Jean had a serious fall in 1912, she gave up painting to care for him.\n\nWe might see Blanche as the comet's tail of Impressionism, though perhaps her greatest contribution to it was her steadfast support\n\nWhen Jean died two years later, Hoschedé-Monet returned to live at Giverny, where the recently widowed Monet was panic-stricken that he was losing his sight and finding it difficult to work. Her decision delighted his friends. Geffroy told her he was \"happy for him and happy for you. Your mutual misfortune makes your reunion stronger.\"\n\nHer reassuring presence gave Monet the strength he required to begin the monumental compositions of water lilies that occupied his final years and which he hoped would create \"the illusion of an endless whole\". The exhibition includes a photograph of him working on these \"Grand Decorations\", as he called them, with Hoschedé Monet at his side.\n\nMonet's close friend, Prime Minister Georges Clemenceau, later wrote that she had prepared the canvas grounds, but Hoschedé-Monet refuted the claim. \"Contrary to what has been said and what has been written, I didn't make a brushstroke on [Monet's] canvases. It would have been a sacrilege.\" She also described Monet's death in 1926: \"It was the soul of the house who left… Everything here was illuminated by him.\"\n\nWith Michel's approval, Hoschedé-Monet remained at Giverny for the rest of her life, caring for the house and studio, and tending to Monet's beloved gardens. She resumed painting again almost immediately, and in 1927 had her first solo exhibition at Galerie Bernheim-Jeune in Paris. Critics took great interest in her renaissance, with one from newspaper Le Peuple proclaiming her \"more than the heiress of a great name\".\n\nLA County Museum of Art/ Mr and Mrs George Gard De Sylva Collection/ Museum Associates/ LACMA In this 1887 painting, Monet depicts Blanche at her easel (Credit: LA County Museum of Art/ Mr and Mrs George Gard De Sylva Collection/ Museum Associates/ LACMA)\n\nImpressionism lost its grip on the art world almost as soon as Monet died, but Hoschedé-Monet always remained loyal to her mentor's painting style. We might see her as the comet's tail of that hugely influential artistic movement, though perhaps her greatest contribution to it was her steadfast support. \"Without her, Claude Monet would have lived in an isolation that would have killed him,\" wrote the art dealer René Gimpel. \"It was she who kept him alive for us, posterity must not forget her.\"\n\nBlanche Hoschedé-Monet in the Light is at the The Sidney and Lois Eskenazi Museum of Art, Indiana until 15 June.\n\n--",

        "content": "The unexpected origins of Houston's favourite po' boy\n\n24 March 2025 Share Save Rebecca Treon Share Save\n\nAntone's Famous Po' Boy\n\nIt's a mashup of an Italian-style hoagie and a Southern po' boy, with a distinctly delicious Middle Eastern twist.\n\nIn 2007, I was a recent newcomer to Houston, a humid Texas city on the Gulf of Mexico that felt as foreign to me as if I had moved around the globe. Unsurprisingly, this incredibly diverse city was teeming with international culinary influences. There was Mexican food from across the border; fresh Vietnamese flavours brought by refugees in the 1970s; and New Orleans-style food from people who moved here after Hurricane Katrina. Middle Eastern food was everywhere too, from vast emporiums stocked with brined olives, tabbouleh and vats of hummus to street vendors serving freshly made kebabs. But Houston's most distinctive sandwich was something entirely different: a mashup of an Italian-style hoagie and a Southern po' boy, with a distinctly delicious Middle Eastern twist.\n\nA take on the popular New Orleans-style sandwich, its Texan cousin, the Houston po' boy is layered with sliced ham, salami, provolone cheese, mayo and spicy dill pickle slices, before being slathered in chow chow, a Southern relish made of cabbage, green tomatoes and hot peppers. But what sets the sandwich apart is its creator: Jalal Antone, the Louisiana-born, Texas-raised son of Lebanese and Syrian immigrants. His version of a chow chow recipe had a bold Middle Eastern influence, swapping out traditional mustard and celery seeds for paprika and turmeric, giving the relish a striking orange hue and a deeper, spiced complexity.\n\nAntone dreamed of starting a Middle Eastern import store but was unsure of how it would be received by Houstonians at the time. In 1962, he finally opened Antone's Import Company on Taft Street, selling imported spices, olives, hummus, falafel and tabouli. At the time, most of Houston's half a million residents were unfamiliar with Middle Eastern food. To win them over, he devised a simple but effective solution: a sandwich.\n\n\"Houstonians were eating burgers in those days,\" explains Craig Lieberman, CEO of Antone's. \"The story is that he asked his friends 'How do I sell a product to Houstonians?' They said, 'Come up with a chow chow recipe and put that on your sandwich'.\"\n\nAntone's Famous Po' Boy Jalal Antone came up with a twist on a classic sandwich to encourage people to come to his Middle Eastern import store (Credit: Antone's Famous Po' Boy)\n\nAntone sourced French bread from a local bakery, layered it with his imported meats and cheeses and added his signature spiced chow chow. The result? A sandwich that became a Houston staple.\n\nBy the late 1960s, Antone's had become a wild success, with people flocking there from far and wide. A postcard dating from Antone's early years describes the store as a \"tempting world of foreign foods\" while a 1965 Houston Chronicle article notes that the store was stocked with cheeses, olives, eels and even squid pickled in their own ink. But what kept people coming back were the sandwiches.\n\nWorld's Table BBC.com's World's Table \"smashes the kitchen ceiling\" by changing the way the world thinks about food, through the past, present and future.\n\nRestaurant critic Alison Cook remembers eating the affordable, filling Antone's Original sandwiches as a student at Rice University in 1966, describing the experience in a 2017 Houston Chronicle article. \"It was founded to cater primarily to the local Syrian and Lebanese community, but the po' boys made it a mecca for Houstonians of all stripes. To my impressionable 19-year-old brain, the rambling Antone's space was an exotic wonderland, chockablock with foodstuffs from the Middle East and beyond, festooned with sausages and crammed with cheeses I'd never heard of. In a city where steakhouses, seafood palaces and Italian American spots ruled the dining scene, Antone's pointed the way to a wider world.\"\n\nSome of Houston's most iconic restaurants were started by immigrants – Megha McSwain\n\nThrough the 1970s and 80s, the Houston po' boy cemented itself as a local lunchtime staple, on par with tacos and barbecue. Antone's success sent a message to the owners of other local Middle Eastern restaurants that if you sold a Houston po' boy, you could also sell everything from baba ganoush to zaatar, and a new type of sandwich was born. Inspired by Antone's, imitators like Droubi's and Kojak's built empires of their own, each with their own take on the sandwich and a slightly different spin on the signature chow chow.\n\nAntone's Famous Po' Boy Antone’s po’ boys are also sold at the groundbreaking Antone’s nightclub in Austin, which brought the blues to Texas (Credit: Antone's Famous Po' Boy)\n\n\"Some of Houston's most iconic restaurants were started by immigrants and kind of took on their own path based on a mix of their family recipes combined with what people in Houston wanted and were familiar with,\" says Houston-based food writer Megha McSwain. \"These were really adventurous flavours for people at the time. The story of how they moved forward by creating something unique is why they've lasted so long.\"\n\nWhere to try Houston's most iconic sandwich\n\nAlthough Antone's original import store is long gone, the Houston po' boy lives on. Antone's Famous Po' Boys still has two locations in Houston – one inside The Galleria, the city's massive megamall, and another in the Heights neighbourhood, where you can grab a sandwich alongside Lebanese tabouli and dolmas.\n\nIf you can't make it to a sandwich shop, Antone's po' boys are sold in grocery stores across Texas, including H-E-B, Randall's, Kroger, and Brookshire Brothers. They're even stocked in hospital cafes and at Texan universities like Baylor and The University of Texas. If you're looking for a taste of Antone's at home, their proprietary chow chow can be bought by the jar at local supermarkets along with their pickles.\n\nAntone's Famous Po' Boy Visitors to Houston can find jars of Antone's chow chow in local supermarkets (Credit: Antone's Famous Po' Boy)\n\nThough Houston's food scene continues to evolve, the po' boy remains a symbol of the city's culinary melting pot – a sandwich born from Middle Eastern ingenuity, shaped by Southern tradition and beloved by generations of Houstonians.\n\n\"I can't tell you how many Texans grew up on Antone's,\" says Lieberman. \"We still use the same bread from Royal Bakery and the same recipes that Jalal created; it's a very nostalgic and beloved Texas brand.\"\n\n--\n\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.",

I bought a ticket from a small office on the Malecón promenade and navigated my way past a cluster of wooden houses on stilts to a row of floating platforms beside the Amazon River. There were no proper steps down to the water. Instead, I clambered down a slippery bank and showed my ticket to a busy attendant handing out life jackets.\n\n\"Puerto Nariño?\" I asked, checking that I wasn't mistakenly getting on a boat to Brazil or Peru. \"Sí,\" he nodded, ushering me towards a covered motor launch. I sank thankfully into a plastic seat near the bows and enjoyed my first uninterrupted view of the world's most voluminous river.\n\nLocated 75km apart on the banks of the Amazon, Leticia and Puerto Nariño, Colombia, are jungle municipalities with radically different personalities. The former is a hot, frenetic border town full of swarming motorbikes and hustling vendors. The latter is a tranquil experiment in sustainable living where motor vehicles are banned and the streets are as clean as Copenhagen's. In a world accustomed to pessimistic climate predictions, Puerto Nariño offers a positive news story about a municipality that's on the right track compared to many large cities around the globe – and the measures are mostly Indigenous led.\n\nBoat is the only way to get to Puerto Nariño from the outside world, a captivating two-hour journey along the Amazon from Leticia with Peru on one side and Colombia on the other. Pulling into the community's diminutive boat dock at the confluence of the Amazon and Loretoyaco rivers, it quickly became apparent that I'd arrived in one of the jungle's more unusual outposts.\n\nBrendan Sainsbury The only way to get to Puerto Nariño is via a two-hour boat trip along the Amazon River (Credit: Brendan Sainsbury)\n\nKnown locally as \"the natural cradle of Colombia\", Puerto Nariño is an encouraging example of a community living in relative harmony with nature. In 2012, it was the first town in the country to be certified a \"sustainable tourist destination\" by the Ministry of Commerce, Industry and Tourism. It's surrounded by the kind of endangered rainforest that dominates discussions about climate change, and attracts a growing trickle of curious visitors keen to examine the health of the planet's \"lungs\" from the inside.\n\nRecent news from the Colombian Amazon has been mixed. While deforestation rates reputedly fell 70% in 2023, the region also suffered a record-breaking drought that endangered wildlife and led to unpredictable harvests.\n\nNotwithstanding, my first impressions of Puerto Nariño were encouraging. Neat terracotta walkways lined with shapely trees and bushes fanned out in a well-ordered grid from the riverbank, and attractive wooden houses decorated with extravagant murals and eye-catching handicrafts reflected a strong Indigenous presence: around 80% of the settlement's 6,000 inhabitants are from the Ticuna, Cocama and Yagua ethnic groups.\n\nIn contrast to other congested Colombian cities, cars and motorbikes are banned. In fact, the town has no roads and only two registered vehicles: a tractor for collecting rubbish and an ambulance in case of emergencies. Shiny silver litter bins stood at almost every street corner and, serenaded by birdsong, the place exuded an air of peace, tidiness and order.\n\nBrendan Sainsbury The town has no roads and only two registered vehicles, including a tractor for collecting rubbish (Credit: Brendan Sainsbury)\n\nAfter paying a COP$15,000 (£3) entry tax that goes towards town maintenance, I got acquainted with the community on an exploratory walkabout. It wasn't a typical Amazonian village of muddy paths and unkempt foliage. Manicured grass-fronted stores selling colourful crafts, and a striking selection of surrealistic statues depicted the local wildlife (turtles, pink dolphins and parrots all featured). A boisterous game of five-a-side football was taking place under a large metal canopy by the river and community members with wheelbarrows and brooms were busily sweeping the pathways.\n\nFounded in 1961, Puerto Nariño drew most of its population from Indigenous people who had been living in the region for centuries in separate family malocas (longhouses). It didn't take long to lure adventurous travellers.\n\n\"Starting in the 1980s and '90s, the town began to attract small groups of tourists, who stayed in wooden hotels with basic services,\" said Luz Jenny Torres, leader of sustainable tourism in the municipality. \"Then at the beginning of the 2000s we started to see a more regular flow of tourists – family groups and university students. In 2004, the then-mayor Edilberto Suárez Pinto began to implement a vision for sustainability working hard to beautify the urban area, strengthen tourism in Indigenous communities and manage the tourist infrastructure.\"\n\nIn 2007, Torres proposed to the mayor that the municipality act as a pilot model for sustainable tourism countrywide. A plan was hatched, and Puerto Nariño became a poster child for green, grassroots tourism in a country still rejuvenating after years of conflict.\n\n\"There are five environmental programmes that are constantly monitored,\" explained Torres of the current setup. \"Management of water, energy, solid waste and pollution; along with the protection and conservation of flora and fauna.\" For residents and travellers, this means showering with recycled rainwater, strolling streets unsullied by litter and enjoying close-up encounters with wildlife, from monkeys to eagles.\n\nMatthieu Cattin/Alamy Puerto Nariño has become the poster child for green, grassroots tourism in Colombia (Credit: Matthieu Cattin/Alamy)\n\nThis environmental stewardship is nothing new. Nurturing a deep understanding of their natural surroundings, the area's Indigenous people have practiced sustainable agriculture since pre-Columbian times. Farming is still mainly organised through a network of chagras, small plots of land cleared of foliage and planted with crops during the dry season before being rotated to enable the soil to regain its fertility.\n\nLocal families grow enough food on their chagras for their own needs and then sell the surplus at a daily market that convenes down by the waterfront. Browsing the stalls, I admired brimming mounds of cassava, chillies, onions, squash and chicory, along with fruits such as bananas, papayas and mangos.\n\nDine in town and this is the food you'll be eating. Everyone, including Puerto Nariño's \"poshest\" hotel, Waira Selva, buys the bulk of their ingredients at the market.\n\nAmazon fish were also on show, the basic protein in most dishes. There are 68 species in the surrounding rivers, including catfish, piranhas and pirarucu, one of the world's largest freshwater fish.\n\nThe local fishers double as environmental custodians monitoring wildlife in tandem with a foundation called Natütama, founded in 2005, that maintains an interpretation centre of river life in town staffed by Indigenous guides. Through Natütama, fishers recorded 1,044 pink dolphin and 134 highly endangered manatee sightings in 2023, with more detailed surveys planned for 2024. The numbers are not just important for conservation. Dolphin watching is a big lure for tourism, a mainstay of the regional economy. Wildlife trips can be organised with Indigenous guides who head off in small wooden motorboats called peque-peques in search of pink dolphins, sloths and turtles in nearby Lake Tarapoto, nominated a Ramsar wetlands site in 2018.\n\nBrendan Sainsbury The town's strong Indigenous presence is represented in colourful murals and eye-catching handicrafts (Credit: Brendan Sainsbury)\n\nAs well as monitoring endangered species, Natütama staff tutor children about Amazonian ecology and organise environmental workshops in local colleges and Indigenous communities. \"Over the years, we have strengthened environmental and cultural education in schools, focusing particularly on the importance of grandparents,\" said Marelvi Laureano, an education coordinator for the foundation, of their work sowing intergenerational understanding. \"They are the people that provide the cultural knowledge that helps generate respect and care towards the community.\"\n\nThe interpretation centre acts as an environmental and educational hub. \"It recreates the year's two different seasons,\" explained Laureano, referring to exhibits that teach visitors about the wet and dry times of year. \"Inside, you'll learn about the local lakes and jungle, how to identify the plants, fish and aquatic animals, and how they are divided on a natural scale.\"\n\nVisitors can learn dances, taste typical Indigenous food, hear myths and legends about different animals, and see the work we do caring for the environment\n\nElsewhere in the municipality, travellers can get an insight into Indigenous life. \"Visitors can learn dances, taste typical Indigenous food, hear myths and legends about different animals, and see the work we do caring for the environment,\" said Laureano.\n\nOne of the refreshing aspects of Puerto Nariño's conservation is that it's locally led. \"Indigenous people represented by the organisation ATICOYA, have always participated in everything related to the process,\" Torres explained.\n\nEnlightened after a visit to Natütama, I took a guided boat trip to Lake Tarapoto where I was allowed to swim (despite the piranhas!) and rounded off the day by climbing Puerto Nariño's emblematic wooden tower for a panoramic view of the river and surrounding jungle.\n\nBrendan Sainsbury The town's lookout tower offers superb views over the river and jungle (Credit: Brendan Sainsbury)\n\nAt the foot of the tower is one of several outlets that sell homemade ice cream in an array of tropical flavours. I chose camu camu, made with a purplish cherry-like fruit high in vitamin C, and strolled around town soaking up more of its creative eco-initiatives: plant pots fashioned out of recycled plastic bottles; fastidiously kept gardens; and a water filtration plant where most of the town comes to refill their drinking containers.\n\nCarbon Count The travel emissions it took to report this story were 0.30 metric tons of CO2e. Find out more about how we calculated this figure here.\n\nMy favourite spot was a small restaurant with a terrace opposite the five-a-side football court where I enjoyed grilled fish to the soundtrack of cheers from the players before retiring to my modest cabin accommodation.\n\nNighttime in the traffic-free tranquillity of Puerto Nariño's was cathartic. Fed by the grassroots power of the community, the town has created an unlikely blend of jungle mellowness and Scandinavian-style order in the middle of the world's largest rainforest. It might not be the ultimate cure for the tricky environmental issues facing the Amazon, but it's an encouraging start.\n\nGreen Getaways is a BBC Travel series that helps travellers experience a greener, cleaner approach to getting out and seeing the world.\n\n--\n\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news delivered to your inbox every Friday.",

On a clear day, panoramic views of the Dead Sea, Bethlehem and Jerusalem stretch across the horizon. According to the Bible, it is the last place Moses gazed upon before his death. Today, it's the first sight walkers see as they set out on their journey along the Camino de Egeria, a pilgrim route first taken by a 4th-Century nun.\n\nThe view is \"magical\", says Silvano Mezzenzana, who recently undertook the three-day hike. He recalls standing atop that peak on the Moab plateau, a dry Sun fanning out over the ridges and farmland beneath, noting that it is fascinating both in the morning when the Sun lights up the Palestinian bank and the city of Jericho, and in the afternoon when the sunset draws the silhouettes of the hills of Judah up to Jerusalem. Up there, \"you do not realise that you are on a mountain\", he adds.\n\nBeginning on the eastern edge of the Great Rift Valley, the 50km route winds through farmland and rugged hills – a voyage that is far greener than its European equivalent, the 800km Camino de Santiago pilgrim trail undertaken by around 500,000 people each year. Following the January announcement from Jordan and Spain of a merger twinning the Camino de Egeria with the Camino de Santiago to boost their respective cultural heritage, locals hope that the newly-renovated Middle Eastern trail can become a similar phenomenon. The goal is to highlight the significance of the eponymous Egeria, the Spanish nun believed to have travelled by donkey from Jordan through Palestine, Egypt, Syria, Mesopotamia and Asia Minor to visit the holy places recounted in the Bible. She is thought to be the first woman to make the journey, which pre-dates the famed Camino de Santiago by five centuries.\n\nThe hike is typically split up into three days (though can be done as quickly as in two, or a leisurely five). The terrain is not particularly challenging, but the distance – of around 17km per day – makes the hike unsuitable for total novices. Last year, wide paths were fixed between the rocky valleys and hills along much of the route, ushering in what the Ministry of Tourism hopes will mark a new era for international interest in the country.\n\nSilvano Mezzenzana Mount Nebo is believed to be where Moses stood to view the Promised Land before his death (Credit: Silvano Mezzenzana)\n\nThe effort is already seeing results. \"Although I have lived in Jordan all my life, walking this trail has shown me parts of the country I've never experienced before,\" says Nadeen Dabbas. She recalls the flow of the water at the Moses Springs and the Jordan Valley, where she was surrounded by fields of bananas and corn, as moments that \"made me feel alive\".\n\nThe Best of 2025 Jordan was named one of BBC Travel's 25 best places to visit in 2025, a list highlighting destinations that are not only welcoming visitors, but using tourism as a force for good. See the full list here.\n\nThe first major landmark on day one features a small monastery built by Egyptian monks in Moses' memory, built in the latter half of the 4th Century, enlarged a century later and rebuilt in the 6th Century to a mosaic-filled basilica that still stands today. The trail then passes through the ancient city of Livias, before reaching its showpiece on day two: Al-Maghatas, or Bethany beyond the Jordan. A Unesco World Heritage site, this is believed to be the location where Jesus was baptised by John the Baptist. Pilgrims can explore Byzantine and Roman remains of chapels, churches and monasteries, along with the cave of John the Baptist, and even \"spend the second night there in one of the pilgrim houses of Bethany, just next to the Jordan River\", explains Oscar Koshebye, a guide who helped formalise the current tourist trail. The route finishes here, or at the King Hussein Bridge at the Jordan-Israel border.\n\nWhile the hike offers striking natural beauty, the real draw may prove to be the woman who likely inspired it. \"Egeria's account is significant because it is one of the oldest written accounts of pilgrimage to the Holy Land that has survived – and the first incontrovertibly penned by a woman,\" says Anne McGowan, associate professor of liturgy at the Catholic Theological Union and co-author of Pilgrimage of Egeria. Egeria's work was little-known until the 1880s, McGowan adds, originally written in the form of letters to her \"sisters\" (likely holy women similar to herself). An incomplete manuscript dating to the 11th Century is currently the oldest known record of her route.\n\nSilvano Mezzenzana The 50km route has recently been twinned with Spain's Camino de Santiago (Credit: Silvano Mezzenzana)\n\nEgeria travelled during the 4th Century, when many Christians took long-distance pilgrimages – something that fell out of favour from the 7th Century until around the mid-19th (aside from a \"blip\" in the wake of the Crusades, in the 12th-13th Centuries), McGowan explains. At that point, \"travel to the Holy Land became easier once again. Going on pilgrimage aligned well with the Romantic Era's renewed enthusiasm for the personal and the subjective on the one hand and an idealised past on the other; and Protestants as a group became more intrigued by pilgrimage possibilities connected to places associated with the life and death of Jesus in a way they hadn't been previously.\"\n\nBut now, with religious appetite dwindling (a study published last year found that atheists now outnumber theists in the UK), Koshebye is hoping that a new generation can be drawn in. \"We can consider it now, after centuries of abandonment, a route for tolerance between faiths, a way to improve intercultural exchange,\" he says.\n\nPlan your trip The Egeria Way branch office is at the Kawon bookshop in Madaba. From here, registered visitors will be taken to trail's start point, 15km away in Mount Nebo. Packages from different tour operators will soon be offered by the Egeria Way Association. Travel within Jordan is safe, though the UK Foreign Office advises against travel within 3km of the border with Syria.\n\nThe Spanish national and keen hiker began mulling a walking route to Jerusalem five years ago. Having already walked the Spanish Camino, he mentioned his plans to his father, who likened his son's idea to the devout Egeria – who he had never heard of. Koshebye began reading about the nun and scouring old maps in search of her original route. He later made a YouTube video about his plans, was contacted by the Jordanian tourist board, and then got in touch with the Spanish embassy in Jordan – a series of collaborative efforts that led to the merger being born.\n\nKoshebye hopes that the partnership leads to a surge of interest in this three-day version of the hike and wants it to be extended a further 30km to Jerusalem, another stop on Egeria's route. Plans for signage along the Jordanian route and more guesthouses where walkers can rest in between are already afoot.\n\nAlamy The three-day hike takes in some of Jordan's most sacred Christian sites (Credit: Alamy)\n\nWhile steeped in religious significance, ancient routes of this kind aren't just for those intent on retracing paths drawn by scripture, McGowan says. \"Taking a very long walk still has the capacity to pull one into an inner journey. Younger people are still spiritual seekers, even if their search is typically less closely tied to traditional religious beliefs and practices,\" she believes. \"Their pilgrimages might be more oriented toward the experience of journeying itself, as it seems Egeria's was as well; she does not so much set out on a round trip to visit one particular place, for example, as to experience as many places as possible.\"\n\nWith time – and a few more signposts – those involved in the project hope that Jordan's historic trail can achieve the same cultural significance as its Spanish counterpart. Mezzenzano, for one, has no doubt. \"I would not only recommend\" the trail, he enthuses, \"but I plan to repeat it\".\n\n--\n\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.",

        "content": "'Our plan worked': How Vienna prepared itself for a 5,000-year flood\n\n20 September 2024 Share Save Sophie Hardach Share Save\n\nGetty Images Vienna escaped Storm Boris relatively unscathed due to its flood defences (Credit: Getty Images)\n\nStorm Boris is the latest deluge in one of the most flood-plagued periods in Europe in the past 500 years, but one city escaped relatively unscathed. The steps Vienna took to prepare for extreme rainfall may hold lessons for how other cities can face deluges to come.\n\nAnd yet, considering the onslaught of water, \"we got away quite lightly\", noted a Viennese journalist, referring to reports of an estimated ten lightly injured people, and 15 evacuated houses in the city. \"On the whole, the [city's] ingenious flood management system resisted the masses of water,\" concluded another local journalist.\n\nIn fact, evidence from previous big floods suggests that a number of protective strategies used by Vienna, and Austria more generally, are proving effective – and offering vital lessons to others battling increasingly extreme weather.\n\n\"Austria has really invested in flood management over the past decades, not least because we had two big floods, in 2002 and 2013,\" says Günter Blöschl, a hydrologist and director of the Centre for Water Resource Systems of the Vienna University of Technology, who has helped shape Austria's flood risk management strategy.\n\nIn Vienna, a flood defence system developed decades ago has played a crucial role in protecting the city, Blöschl explains.\n\n\"Vienna's flood defence system is designed to cope with a flood discharge of 14,000 cubic metres per second – that's equivalent to a 5,000-year flood,\" he says. A flood of that size last occurred in 1501, he adds. During the flood over the weekend, around 10,000 cubic metres per second flowed through Vienna's waterways, \"significantly below the system's 14,000-cubic-metre capacity,\" he adds. \"Without this system, there would have been widespread flooding.\"\n\nGetty Images Over just five days, Storm Boris doused parts of Austria with five times as much rain as they would get in an average September (Credit: Getty Images)\n\nOne cornerstone of this flood defence system is an artificial island, the Danube Island, and a flood control channel, the New Danube. Both were built in the 1970s, in reaction to a powerful flood in 1954 that had overwhelmed existing defences. The New Danube is usually closed by weirs, creating a kind of lake. \"The weirs are opened before the flood arrives, and for three, four days, the channel takes in flowing water,\" relieving Vienna's main river, the Danube, Blöschl says.\n\nThe system was put to a dramatic test in 2013, when the Upper Danube Basin experienced one of the largest floods in the past two centuries. The Danube's flood discharge in Vienna reached around 11,000 cubic metres per second, but major damage was avoided due to the city's flood defence system, according to a report by the city. \"Not a single household was threatened in Vienna, compared with 400,000 households across Austria,\" the report stated.\n\nThat does not mean the system wholly contains big floods, however. During the big flood last weekend, the Wienfluss, a smaller river in Vienna, swelled and spilled onto the tracks of an underground train, and public transport has been interrupted as a result.\n\nThe damage we've avoided is far higher than the investment in flood protection. It's a success story – Günter Blöschl\n\nAustria as a whole has also ramped up its defences. It invests around €60m ($67m and £50m) a year in flood protection measures – and has seen a reduction in the devastation caused, according to official estimates. The protective strategy includes regular drills for emergency measures such as mobile walls, put up to hold back masses of water; and a more sophisticated and accurate forecasting system.\n\nAccording to an official evaluation, the big flood in 2002 caused €3bn ($3.6bn, £2.5bn) in damage in all of Austria. Even though the 2013 flood was also big, the damage it caused was much less, estimated at around €866m ($967m, £727m), thanks to the flood protection measures. Data also backs up the accuracy of the forecasts: after the flood over the 13 September 2024 weekend, Austria's weather service found that the actual rainfall was in line with the expected amount.\n\nLooking at the impact of the flood last weekend, \"We've seen that it's been worth it,\" Blöschl says of the measures. \"The damage we've avoided is far higher than the investment in flood protection. It's a success story.\"\n\nGetty Images Firefighters and volunteers in Lower Austria pile up sandbags in defence against Storm Boris (Credit: Getty Images)\n\nManaging the huge volumes of water during such a big flood is especially difficult as there are now fewer floodplains, where the water can safely expand without threatening humans or their property. Instead, there are now towns and farms on the previously uninhabited floodplains – which are defined as areas alongside rivers that are naturally prone to flooding.\n\nIn 1899, when Vienna experienced a flood of a similar size to the one in 2013, \"there were basically no dams,\" he says. \"But there were almost 1,000 square kilometres (386 sq miles) of floodplains [upstream of Vienna]. They held back a lot of the water. Those aren't there anymore, so with the same rainfall, you get a lot more discharge into the Danube in Vienna.\" With more water flowing into the city, the rivers swell more, and are more likely to spill over unless they are contained.\n\nThe 'levee effect': why dams don't equal safety\n\nParadoxically, while dams, levees and other barriers help protect people by holding back the water during a flood, they can actually increase the overall risk in the long run, studies suggest. That's because they can give people a false sense of safety, and encourage them to settle close to waterways and underestimate the risk of flooding, a phenomenon known as the levee effect. At worst, it can leave them unprepared in an emergency.\n\nIn the United States, for example, levee construction is associated with a 62% acceleration in urban expansion in floodplains, compared to a 29% increase in the wider county, according to one study. The studies' authors warn that this highlights \"a clear change in risk perception after levees are built\", but also note that regulation can reduce that push into floodplains.\n\n\"Vienna is a good example for the levee effect,\" says Blöschl. \"When a city is protected, for example through levees, people get a feeling of safety. And then, through urbanisation, the flood risk rises, as that risk is defined as the probability of a flood, times the expected damage. And when more people move into the floodplains, that expected damage is greater.\"\n\nHowever, preventing people from settling near rivers is difficult, he says – because floods occur rarely, and riversides and floodplains can be attractive settlement areas. In fact, research suggest that around 2 billion people in the world live on floodplains. Research also suggests that people in fact have a short memory when it comes to flooding risk, with public awareness of the danger and how to respond soaring in the wake of a big flood, but then falling fairly quickly.\n\nFlood drills are really important. Unless you prepare with practical exercises, it's not going to work during emergencies – Günter Blöschl\n\nIn Austria, accurate forecasts and flood management drills helped save lives during the most recent flood, not only in Vienna but also in other parts of Austria, Blöschl says. \"We had flood drills at every level, for the firefighters and the military. Unless you prepare with practical exercises, it's not going to work during emergencies. My message is that flood management drills are a really important element,\" he says.\n\nEmergency responders practiced how to put up mobile walls to hold back the flood, for example. \"If that doesn't run like clockwork, you're not going to get them up in time\" before the water comes, he says. \"A lot can go wrong – there can be parts missing, and if there's even a tiny gap, the water gets through. So you have to practise, and they did, and it worked.\"\n\nAccurate forecasts also helped decide where dams were at risk of being breached, and where people had to be evacuated, he adds.\n\nGetty Images Workers clean up debris from subway tracks after the Wienfluss canal in Vienna spilled over its banks after Storm Boris (Credit: Getty Images)\n\nSuper-charged storms\n\n\"This event was intensified by climate change, particularly the warming of the Mediterranean sea,\" says Blöschl, pointing to record-breaking Mediterranean Sea surface temperatures this summer. Because of this unusually warm Mediterranean summer, Storm Boris \"was able to take up more energy and water\", he explains.\n\nThere is other evidence that such warming is super-charging storms. A study found that a record-breaking marine heatwave and human-made climate change substantially contributed to the development of an extremely powerful storm over the Mediterranean Sea in August 2022.\n\n\"All the studies (based on numerical simulations or on statistical analysis) seem to confirm that especially the warming of the sea surface is responsible for producing an increase in the intensity of these storms,\" says Mario Marcello Miglietta, a research director at the Institute of Atmospheric Sciences and Climate (CNR-ISAC) in Padua, Italy, and one of the authors of the study. \"In the climate conditions of a few decades ago, [these storms] would have not formed.\"\n\nAnother reason for the rise in floods in northern Europe is a broader northward shift in global rainfall, because of changing pressure between the Arctic and the equator, as the two are warming at different rates, Blöschl explains. The Arctic is warming faster than the equator because the melting ice results in the surface being less reflective and instead, more absorbent of sunlight, which reinforces the warming effect, he says.\n\n\"All the countries north of the Alps, so for example, Austria, Germany, France, the British Isles, the West Coast of Scandinavia, have seen a rise in floods over the past 30 years,\" says Blöschl. His research with colleagues suggests that the past three decades have been among the most flood-plagued periods in Europe in the past 500 years.\n\nGetty Images European countries north of the Alps have seen an increase in flooding over the past 30 years (Credit: Getty Images)\n\nIn 2021, shocking images of torrents of water ripping through western European towns, fuelled by record-breaking rainfall, showed the impact of such disasters and also raised questions over how to prepare for them. More than 200 people died in that flood, including 184 people in Germany, prompting soul-searching over whether such a wealthy country could not have protected its people better. In 2024, a German report on lessons from that disaster recommended giving clearer warnings with specific action to be taken, including maps and chart to help people understand exactly what to do and distributing the warnings in many different ways to reach as many people as possible. This was after a survey of survivors in the German disaster zone revealed that a third of respondents did not receive any warning, and of those who were warned, 85% did not expect very severe flooding and almost half did not know what to do.\n\nIn the climate conditions of a few decades ago, these storms would have not formed – Mario Marcello Miglietta\n\nAnd while Vienna may have resisted the most recent flood relatively well, it wreaked havoc in many parts of central Europe – causing 'a catastrophe of epic proportions', in the words of a Romanian mayor. More than 20 people died and thousands of people were evacuated, including the entire town of Nysa in Poland – more than 40,000 people. In Austria, farmers saw their harvests destroyed, with millions of euros of damage.\n\nResearch suggests that sharing lessons across borders is vital in helping European countries prepare for future extreme weather. In 2023, a team of European scientists who analysed historic megafloods found that 95.5% of megafloods could have been anticipated based on previous events in other, comparable places in Europe. The scientists emphasised that while megafloods may be rare in each country, they are more common across the whole region, concluding that \"local surprises are not surprising at the continental scale\".\n\nIn fact, record-breaking rainfall and widespread flooding has become a regular occurrence in Europe, and an estimated one in eight Europeans lives in areas potentially vulnerable to flooding.\n\nBased on models projecting increased and more extreme rainfall in northern Europe, leading to more floods, Blöschl says: \"The prognosis is that it's going to continue like this\".\n\n--\n\nFor essential climate news and hopeful developments to your inbox, sign up to the Future Earth newsletter, while The Essential List delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights twice a week.",

But America's playground – or to use its better-known nickname, Sin City – is going green. From water conservation and waste management to solar power, the city has invested millions in pushing sustainability initiatives.\n\n\"The effort began in earnest in 2005,\" says Marco Velotta, who serves as the city's sustainability officer, \"and accelerated with the Recovery Act in 2009\". The federal act set targets for renewable energy, water conservation, recycling and green buildings.\n\n\"With the Recovery Act and City Council direction, the city was able to make an initial investment of $75m (£58m) in sustainability projects,\" Velotta says.\n\nDespite a dramatic population increase, water consumption has dropped \"significantly\", he says. By 2030, 50% of all Nevada's electricity is expected to be generated from renewable resources.\n\nThe Las Vegas strip in particular has doubled down on efforts to switch to renewable energy. Most resorts developed sustainability initiatives thanks to a 10-year-long 50% property tax abatement programme previously offered by the city (the scheme has now closed). The resorts are also required to comply with the state's standard of deriving energy from 40% renewable sources. \"Most have exceeded 40%,\" says Velotta. \"Las Vegas has come a long way in a short amount of time.\n\n\"Initially tourists were also surprised by the city's sustainability efforts. However, since Las Vegas has emerged as a leader in this area, sustainability has become a part of the city's overall story.\"\n\nGetty Images MGM Resorts International has developed a 100-megawatt solar installation to power 11 of its properties in Las Vegas (Credit: Getty Images)\n\nEven though the progress made by Las Vegas's notoriously excess-laden strip may seem impressive (Las Vegas's commercial sector accounts for one third of Nevada's total energy usage), the strip started from a \"relatively low baseline\", points out Steffen Lehmann, professor of architecture and urbanism at the University of Las Vegas, Nevada. He adds, though, \"notably, the strip is making strides, with a concerted effort to enhance the energy efficiency of resort hotels through solar power integration and increased natural daylight\".\n\nSolar city\n\nLas Vegas is second in the US for solar capacity per capita – Honolulu is number one. \"Sin City could be called Solar City,\" says Lehmann. And resorts have been capitalising on the 320 days of sunshine the city receives every year.\n\nThe hospitality company MGM Resorts International developed its own 100-megawatt solar array, which provides power to 11 of its properties in Las Vegas – the equivalent of powering 27,000 homes. But even this, plus additional energy bought from a solar supplier, isn't enough to power the 11 properties round the clock. The company has a goal to source all its energy from renewables by 2030.\n\nLas Vegas lies in the water-scarce Mojave Desert, which makes water conservation \"paramount\" in the hotel chain's efforts to make its operations sustainable, says Michael Gulich, vice president of environmental sustainability at MGM Resorts International. He says the MGM hotel properties on the strip have conserved 16 billion gallons of water since 2007, thanks to \"aggressive\" water policies. These include replacing grass with desert-friendly landscaping, installing water-efficient taps across all properties, and reusing water at aquariums and in the Bellagio Fountain.\n\n\"The overall water use per capita [in Vegas] is still far too high,\" warns Lehmann. \"There was simply such excessive waste before [resorts] started to conserve water in 2007.\"\n\nAlamy Las Vegas's commercial sector accounts for one third of Nevada's total energy usage (Credit: Alamy)\n\nIn 2023, Resorts World Hotel announced it had achieved a milestone – being powered entirely by renewable energy sources, two years after it opened. NV Energy supplies the 3,500-room resort with renewable energy, derived from solar, geothermal and wind plants in Nevada.\n\nThe hotel's head of sustainability, Brandon Morrison, says that during construction, 13,000 tonnes of steel was salvaged from the framework of a development that was abandoned during the 2008 economic downtown. The firm invested more than $1bn (£772m) in energy efficiency upgrades, he adds.\n\n\"Although Resorts World presents impressive sustainability figures, it stands as an anomaly among the Strip's hotels, many of which perform poorly in terms of environmental responsibility,\" says Lehmann.\n\nThe significant solar power and water-saving initiatives that many resorts in Las Vegas are using are \"necessary steps for a rapidly growing desert city\", he adds. \"The Strip has emerged as a notable case study in the effective use of renewable solar energy and water conservation.\"\n\nA work in progress\n\nThere are still great challenges ahead for this vastly energy-intensive city.\n\n\"The primary sources of greenhouse gas emissions in the city are twofold: transportation, particularly from cars and trucks, and the excessive use of air conditioning,\" says Lehmann. \"As a young desert city – only 119 years old – Las Vegas must work diligently to be resourceful and sustainable.\"\n\nMore resorts are developing their own solar power systems, which include battery backup systems so solar power can be stored and used when the Sun goes down. More than 97% of water used in Las Vegas is recycled, adds Lehmann, vital considering the rapidly depleting Colorado River on which the city depends for freshwater.\n\n\"It is gratifying for us to note that at one time Las Vegas was viewed as a city of waste and excess,\" says Velotta. \"However, through our extensive sustainability efforts, we are now recognised as a world leader in sustainability and environmental commitment.\"\n\n--\n\nFor essential climate news and hopeful developments to your inbox, sign up to the Future Earth newsletter, while The Essential List delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights twice a week.",

        "content": "Do skin probiotics actually work?\n\n15 hours ago Share Save Jasmin Fox-Skelly Share Save\n\nGetty Images\n\nThe bacteria and fungi living on your skin play a surprising role in keeping us healthy. Is it possible to give them a boost?\n\nAll-the-more reason to look after our skin microbiome. But how do we do this? One method that has become increasingly popular is the use of topical skin probiotics – which technically means applying live microorganisms to the skin to improve its health.\n\nAs far back as 1912, scientists were rubbing bacteria into people's faces in an attempt to improve conditions such as acne and seborrhea – a common form of dermatitis that causes a red, itchy rash and white or yellow scales.\n\nToday there are dozens of skincare companies selling what they describe as probiotic products, from serums to cleansers and moisturisers. In each case, the balms offer to rebalance the delicate skin microbiome, leaving it \"renewed\" and \"refreshed\".\n\nBut while skincare products often claim to be \"probiotic\", very few, if any, actually contain live bacteria.\n\nWhat's more, as probiotic skin treatments are classed as \"cosmetics\" and not medicines, their manufacturers don't have to share the results of any trials that have been conducted on their products, so it's difficult to know how effective they are.\n\n\"The rules around skin care products are very different to the rules around drugs, so claims can be made with less rigorous testing than would be made for a pharmaceutical agent,\" says Richard Gallo, a dermatologist at UC San Diego School of Medicine.\n\nMost \"probiotic\" skincare products contain either prebiotics – nutrients that feed and encourage the growth of good bacteria on the skin, or postbiotics – proteins or other products made by beneficial bacteria.\n\n\"What we are seeing more and more are approaches that try to influence the microbiome,\" says Bernhard Paetzold, co-founder and chief scientific officer of S-Biomedic, a company that aims to treat conditions by restoring the skin's microbiome through bacterial \"transplants\".\n\nAccording to Paetzold, the main reason for this is that live bacteria are extremely difficult to keep alive throughout the manufacturing, storing and distribution process. Once on the skin there's no guarantee that they'll even take hold, as they must fight to compete with the millions of other microbes already living there.\n\nGetty Images Many probiotic skin creams contain substances designed to promote the growth of beneficial microbes, but applying live microbes might have a greater effect (Credit: Getty Images)\n\nThe idea of promoting a healthy skin microbiome is rooted in the theory that bacteria and fungi living on the outside of our body help to protect us from those that might do us harm.\n\nYet the science behind how certain \"bad\" bacteria can contribute to skin diseases isn't yet fully understood. What we do know is that people with eczema, rosacea, acne and psoriasis all have different types or levels of certain bacteria living on their skin.\n\n\"What exists at the moment is a lot of papers showing that nearly every skin disease imaginable is associated with a shift in the skin microbiome,\" says Paetzold. \"But this observation just shows an association. It doesn't say that the shift in the microbiome causes that disease. It could also be that the disease changes the skin environment, and that's why the bacterial population changes.\"\n\nTo prove that a particular strain of bacteria is causing a disease, you would need to either give a healthy person that skin disease by slathering the \"bad bacteria\" on their face, or cure their disease by applying \"good\" bacteria. While the first option is likely to encounter ethical barriers, there are a few researchers attempting the latter.\n\nThe limited clinical trials that have been published, however, do show promising results. Most focus on using live bacteria to treat eczema, also known as atopic dermatitis. They are based on the findings that the skin of people with eczema is dominated by Staphylococcus aureus, a bacterium that can often be pathogenic.\n\n\"One of the big problems in the skin for diseases like eczema, is that certain pathogenic bacteria like S. aureus live on the surface of the skin and cause rashes, cause disease, and cause infection,\" says Gallo, whose own research group has been searching for ways of harnessing the skin microbiome to fight off the harmful bacteria found thriving on eczema patients. \"We mined the bacteria types that usually live on healthy skin looking for bacteria that could produce things that would fight off those bad bacteria\".\n\nGallo's are focusing on Staphylococcus hominis, a naturally occurring skin bacterium which is present in 21% of healthy people, but only 1% of atopic dermatitis patients.\n\n\"Our skin provides commensal bacteria like S. hominis with a safe place to live, so some of them have evolved a way of protecting their environment from these bad bacteria that are trying to invade,\" says Gallo.\n\nUsing special formulations of living bacteria could well help to make the skin's microbiome healthier\n\nIn the case of S. hominis, the bacterium produces anti-microbial peptides – small fragments of protein – which directly kill S. aureus. They also produce chemicals called \"autoinducing peptides\", which stop bacterial cells from communicating with one another. Some bacteria like S. aureus signal to one another when their population density reaches a certain level – a mechanism known as quorum sensing – triggering the secretion of toxins that can cause skin inflammation. Disrupting that communication can prevent the toxins from being released.\n\nIn 2021, Gallo's team conducted a phase one randomised controlled trial with 54 adults with atopic dermatitis by applying a cream containing live S. hominis over the course of one week. The results showed that treatment with S. hominis dramatically reduced S. aureus colonisation, and even decreased the redness and itch associated with atopic dermatitis in a subgroup of patients compared to a control group given a placebo cream.\n\nThe findings suggest that using special formulations of living bacteria could well help to make the skin's microbiome healthier. But more work needs to be done to prove its effectiveness before it can be used as a treatment. The team are now recruiting for a phase two randomised trial which will assess the efficacy of the treatment over a longer 14 week timescale.\n\nElsewhere, other researchers have also had success treating eczema with probiotics. In one 2003 clinical trial, 11 patients with atopic dermatitis were given a cream containing the bacterium Streptococcus thermophiles, which they applied for two weeks. The results showed that the cream enhanced the skin's production of ceramides – lipids that help to keep the skin hydrated and maintain it as a healthy barrier.\n\nMore recently, in 2018 10 adults and five children with atopic dermatitis were given a \"microbiome transplant\", where live Roseomonas mucosa bacteria collected from the skin of healthy volunteers was then applied to the skin of the patients twice a week. After 16 weeks, the treatment improved their symptoms by more than 50%.\n\nGetty Images Staphylococcus aureus is a common bacteria that is thought to be involved in some skin conditions (Credit: Getty Images)\n\nAlthough clinical trials focusing on other skin conditions are somewhat rarer, they also show promising results. Acne, for example, is linked to colonisation by the bacterium Cutibacterium acnes. Some researchers are therefore looking for bacteria that produce antimicrobial peptides to inhibit or kill this bacterium. In one clinical trial, a lotion containing the bacterium Enterococcus faecalis was given to patients suffering from severe acne. The lotion significantly reduced pustules compared to a placebo lotion.\n\nPaetzold and his company S-Biomedic, meanwhile, published a clinical trial in 2019 where they gave patients with acne a cream containing specific strains of Cutibacterium acnes. The results showedsome reduction in acne.\n\nGallo is also researching whether a strain of Staphylococcus capitis bacteria could be an effective acne treatment, with studies in animals showing promising results.\n\n\"The basic mechanism of action is very straightforward. It just inhibits the C. acnes growth, much in the same way that topical antibiotics or oral antibiotics are used to treat acne,\" says Gallo.\n\nUnlike topical antibiotics, however, the treatment specifically targets C. acnes, so the wider skin microbiome is left unharmed, he says.\n\nGallo's team has even found a specific strain of Staphylococcus epidermidis bacteria that produce molecules that may inhibit the development of sun induced skin cancer.\n\n\"It generates a small molecule that inhibits DNA synthesis in transformed or mutagenic skin cells,\" says Gallo. \"We've found in animal models that if these bacteria are present on the surface of mice that undergo UV radiation damage, they get far fewer skin tumours than mice that have the same species of bacteria, but not the genes [in the bacteria] that make this anti-metabolite.\" Of course, such a treatment will have to go through much more testing and clinical trials before it can be shown to have a similar effect in humans.\n\nGetty Images Yoghurt contains bacteria that can produce substances that promote healthy skin (Credit: Getty Images)\n\nWhile most studies have looked at treating specific diseases with probiotics, there are also a few that have examined whether pre- or postbiotics could improve skin health generally. For example, some researchers are looking at whether inulin – a dietary fibre frequently found in cosmetics and personal care products – could serve as a prebiotic when taken as an oral supplement or applied topically to the skin. Preliminary results suggest that inulin makes the skin more smooth and supple, providing a more favourable environment for beneficial bacteria to thrive. Other studies have shown that slapping on sphingomyelinase, an enzyme produced by bacteria such as Staphylococcus thermophilus – which are commonly found in fermented milk products and yogurt – can boost production of ceramides, which are needed to keep the skin healthy.\n\nHowever in all cases, large randomised double blind clinical trials – the gold standard of medical research – are needed to confirm whether any of these creams are effective.\n\nFor example a recent review study examined all of the data from clinical trials conducted to date and concluded that while \"oral and topical probiotics appear to be effective for the treatment of certain inflammatory skin diseases and demonstrate a promising role in wound healing and skin cancer, more studies are needed to confirm these results\".\n\nGallo agrees that more work is needed but is hopeful about the future of the field.\n\n\"It's moving in the right direction,\" he says. \"We've come to realise as a field that we need to understand what exactly they're doing, and there's a lot of efforts being put into that, as well as other ways to design microbes to help benefit us. So I'm very optimistic about where we'll be in a few years with probiotics.\"\n\nHowever for people who don't have a skin disease, but who might want to increase the smoothness of their skin, prevent wrinkles, or boost hydration levels, there is little evidence that probiotic creams readily available in shops will have any benefit.\n\n\"I think many of the probiotics on the market now don't have very strong evidence behind them, so I wouldn't recommend those necessarily,\" says Gallo. \"You can try them – but it might not be the best use of your money.\"\n\nWhile your skin microbiome changes as you age and encounter different environments, there are a few things you can do to help your skin's natural microbiome flourish.\n\n\"It's a two-way street, because the types of things that we're already doing to moisturise our skin or protect the skin from UV damage are creating an environment that's more hospitable for these beneficial organisms to live in,\" says Gallo.\n\n\"So normal skin care, appropriate moisturising and cleansing – all of those things will promote skin health.\"\n\n--\n\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.",

But it had long been preparing for just such an event, and survived almost intact.\n\nA few days into December 2017, Maeve Juarez, a wildland fire specialist for the Montecito Fire Department, learned an enormous wildfire was creeping toward the Southern California town.\n\nShe was about to be on the frontlines of a community of less than 10,000 people facing off against the Thomas Fire, California's largest ever wildfire at that time.\n\nThe community, however, had several advantages over the approaching fire, the most significant being that it had been preparing for this moment for 30 years.\n\nThe community's collective efforts are what truly make the difference – Maeve Juarez\n\nA decades-long programme had ensured people in the town took regular measures – from clearing up dried leaves around town to fire-proofing their own houses – and installed a level of community trust and cohesion that made fast action possible in the face of a quickly encroaching fire.\n\nAs climate change brings the wildfire threat closer to many communities, they are likewise considering what measures they can take to protect themselves. They may not have 30 years to develop these strategies, but looking at Montecito's long-running experiment can help other communities come up with plans of their own.\n\n\"You don't start preventing dementia once the signs are there; similarly, we don't want to start preparing for wildfire once it's coming into our neighbourhoods,\" says Juarez.\n\nA long night\n\nOn 16 December 2017, the Thomas Fire's flames emerged above Montecito, almost a full week after residents had evacuated. By then, the Sundowner winds – strong down-sloping winds that typically hit the area in the early evening – reached 65mph (105km/h) and the fire team braced for the worst.\n\nBut Montecito's long history of preparation, along with the support of over 8,000 firefighters, turned the town into a wildfire success story.\n\nAs the fire peaked around 6am, firefighter reservers came to help the crews positioned to keep the fire at bay. Over the next 12 hours, they worked together fighting spot fires that cropped up from falling embers. By nightfall, the Sundowner winds had died down, and the fire had moved away from the coastline and Montecito.\n\nKari Greer As the Thomas Fire's flames emerged above Montecito, the town's firefighters braced for the worst (Credit: Kari Greer)\n\nDespite the ominous setup, the town's extensive preparations had paid off. The Thomas Fire burnt through some 282,000 acres (114,000 hectares) of Californian land, including parts of nearby Ventura and Santa Paula. But once the flames and embers abated, only seven homes in Montecito had burned down.\n\n\"Hundreds of structures benefited from the vigilant fire suppression resources that had been deployed in advance,\" says Juarez. \"The level of damage was considerably lower than projected in the 2016 Montecito community wildfire protection plan or what we experienced during previous fires.\"\n\nA unified approach\n\nMontecito's long journey to that moment started in 1994 when, prompted by worsening wildfire seasons, the Montecito Fire Department launched a programme led by wildland fire specialists to develop ways to mitigate wildfire threats. Since then, they have consistently helped the community come together to maintain these strategies as a united front.\n\nWith the guidance of wildland fire specialists like Juarez, community members have long been asked to take critical steps to reduce fire fuel (such as dried leaves and dead plants) around the town. The fire department organises regular neighbourhood cleanups, offers free wood-chipping services, and clears overgrowth and brush in remote areas that might help spread wildfire.\n\nThey also have a comprehensive evacuation plan in place to protect residents and clear the way for first responders to do their job. Community members are kept up to date on the best fire mitigation practices, such as how to incorporate new fire-resistant materials into home hardening projects.\n\n\"Our strength lies in ensuring that our entire community is prepared for wildfires,\" says Juarez. \"While following all the recommended checklists is essential, the community's collective efforts are what truly make the difference.\"\n\nThis work is very hard, [and] complex, and many communities have experienced trauma from the severe negative impacts of extreme wildfire – Emily Troisi\n\nThe other major advantage Montecito had during the Thomas Fire was time. Due to how the fire was moving, they were able to deploy firefighting resources (130 engines and 30 crews) four days before the fire encroached on the town.\n\nThey even had the bandwidth to use bulldozers to clear vegetation along a perimeter above and around Montecito, which is known to burn quickly, while water tankers spread retardant across around 16 miles (26km) of upper roadways.\n\nTime also helped them to implement a calm, measured evacuation, although this also owed something to the town's long-standing preparations for wildfire, Juarez says.\n\nThe established trust between the fire department's wildland fire specialists and the community led to high compliance with evacuation orders, meaning firefighters had the chance to clear brush.\n\nWillingness to follow requests to leave private driveway gates open, meanwhile, meant firefighters could strategically set up fire trucks and hose lays around individual properties.\n\nWildfire risk: where to start\n\nWildfires in the Western US are growing bigger and more intense as climate change triggers longer, dryer summers. But that just sets the stage; urban sprawl and accidental ignition by humans also increase the risk of megafires by creating more fuel and then lighting the match, so to speak.\n\nErica Fischer, assistant professor of structural engineering at Oregon State University in the US, studies how community infrastructure is impacted by natural disasters, with a particular focus on wildfires and earthquakes. She says the science behind how communities can be retrofitted to withstand wildfires is some 100 years behind that of withstanding earthquakes.\n\nIf a community doesn't have a unified, collaborative mitigation strategy, she says, the burden often falls entirely on individual homeowners.\n\nSo, where can communities without a wildfire mitigation strategy begin? Fischer says the first step is to identify their most vital infrastructure and develop a plan to protect it from burning – a strategy known as asset mapping.\n\n\"What would burn in this community that would destroy it economically [and] prevent it from coming back?\" says Fischer. \"Previous research shows that [it's] often schools and hospitals, particularly if they only have one of them in a town, which means that they're usually the largest employers.\"\n\nKari Greer A willingness to follow requests to leave private driveway gates open allowed firefighters to set up fire trucks and hose lays around individual properties (Credit: Kari Greer)\n\nEvery community is different and will have a unique set of priorities. In Ashland, Oregon, for example, which is currently developing its wildfire mitigation strategy, the town prioritised protecting its theatre, Fischer says.\n\nIdentifying areas where fire is likely to spread is also a high priority. For example, if there's an older wooden church in the centre of town that could quickly catch fire if embers fell on it, that should be hardened against fire first.\n\nMeanwhile, protecting water infrastructure should not be overlooked, stresses Fischer. \"There's been a lot of water infrastructure damage throughout the West due to wildfires, and that includes contamination within the water distribution system.\" One helpful approach is to create defensible spaces around water supplies, such as natural watersheds and reservoirs.\n\nAll parts of a community need to understand their own level of risk, adds Abby Silver, outreach programme coordinator for Wildfire Partners, a non-profit in Boulder County, Colorado. \"Before the Marshall Fire [in Boulder, Colorado in 2020], those who lived in the more urban parts of the east county thought of wildfire as something that happens 'up there in the hills',\" says Silver. Now they're beginning to realise that wildland fire can turn into urban conflagration under the right conditions.\"\n\nExtra effort may be needed to include and support parts of the community likely to have a harder time recovering if they lost structures in a wildfire. Financially and/or socially vulnerable areas might not have as direct access to firefighting resources as more affluent parts of a community, says Fischer, nor as much representation in a town hall setting.\n\nErica Fischer Mobile homes are highly combustible and parks are vulnerable during wildfires, as seen in this case during the 2018 Camp Fire in California (Credit: Erica Fischer)\n\nExperts agree that every wildfire-at-risk community needs a concise evacuation plan that is broadcast widely and accessible to all community members. If a community can be efficiently evacuated ahead of a wildfire, it clears the way for firefighters and emergency crew to do their job.\n\n\"During a wildfire, emergency responders' first priority is life safety, then structure defense,\" says Silver. \"The less energy they have to devote to helping residents evacuate, the more they can devote to response. Educating the public to evacuate early, without necessarily waiting for an evacuation order, facilitates the work of first responders.\"\n\nNo panacea\n\nConnecting people, stories and ideas to spread fire adaptation practices to different communities and help with peer support play an important role, too, says Emily Troisi, director of the Fire Adapted Communities Network (FacNet), a non-profit that helps provide fire-at-risk communities with the education and tools they need to better mitigate the impacts of fires. \"This work is very hard, [and] complex, and many communities have experienced trauma from the severe negative impacts of extreme wildfire.\"\n\nDoing retrospectives of towns that were destroyed or partially destroyed by wildfires, unlike Montecito, can also help communities see where the gaps in protection were, says Fischer. This, in turn, can help them prioritise what they need to shore up. \"These towns where portions of the towns were down, those are the real success stories that we should be engaging with and talking about a little bit more.\"\n\nHowever, Fischer cautions that Montecito's mitigation strategies aren't a panacea that will work for every fire-at-risk community. \"When [you've been] doing this staged approach [for 30 years], not only is it not so much of a financial burden to the community itself, but you're doing a little bit over a long period of time, and that changes the culture and the perception of risk and hazard within the town.\"\n\nMost communities in the US are also not as homogenous as the small, affluent town of Montecito. It's challenging to get everyone in a community on board with a complex wildfire mitigation plan, even with incremental change, when there's economic and social disparity.\n\n\"To tell a community that you need to do all of this wildland mitigation in addition to all of this mitigation within your community, and you need to do it immediately, or else your town is going to burn down? It's overwhelming, financially,\" says Fischer.\n\nTroisi also advises against putting too narrow a focus on only preventing fires or stopping structures from burning. FacNet focuses on tools that aid overall community evaluation and relationship-building to help people think through who and what needs to be included in resilience efforts, she says.\n\nKari Greer The 2017 Thomas Fire was the largest in recorded Californian history at the time, but has since been surpassed in size by eight others (Credit: Kari Greer)\n\nUnderstandably, not every community has the budget to develop an expensive wildfire mitigation programme. However, Juarez says, there are several grants available that include salaries for wildland specialists like her. Numerous non-profits around the US are also helping at-risk communities become more fire aware.\n\nFires can be incredibly destructive, but they can also be beneficial if handled respectfully. Prescribed burns are often instrumental in reducing the risk of megafires, according to a 2023 report from the Wildland Fire Mitigation and Management Commission, which gave recommendations to Congress on how to improve federal policies related to wildland fires. (Read more about the benefits of prescribed burns for nature).\n\nBeyond a fire-proof home\n\nWhile experts advise communities to harden their homes against wildfires collectively, there are also several steps individual homeowners can take to make their property less likely to catch fire.\n\nAccording to Juarez, quick and impactful measures include retrofitting vents with galvanised steel screening; filling and covering exposed wood on siding, doorways and windows with caulk and fresh paint; and sealing garages and doors with weather stripping. She also recommends installing gutter screens since gutters can collect dry leaves and debris that ignite easily. In all cases, it's important to use ignition-resistant construction materials whenever possible .\n\nCARBON COUNT The emissions from travel it took to report this story were 0kg CO2. The digital emissions from this story are an estimated 1.2g to 3.6g CO2 per page view. Find out more about how we calculated this figure here.\n\nPerhaps the most impactful step homeowners can take is to create a buffer zone around their property (the recommended buffer area can vary depending on a state's wildfire risk; in California, the zone is 100ft (30m).\n\n\"Use non-combustible materials like pebbles or river rock within the first 5ft (1.5m) of your home,\" says Juarez. \"This area should have little to no vegetation to minimise anything that could catch fire from embers.\" Clearing flammable materials, such as brush and weeds, beyond this zone is also a good idea.\n\nBut as Montecito shows, wildfire protection goes far beyond these individual measures. As climate change fans the flames of wildfire destruction further, mitigation experts say it takes connections and continued, active participation between everyone to develop defensive strategies that will work.\n\n\"It has to be a collaboration between land management agencies, governments, and homeowners,\" says Fischer. \"All three have to buy in, and all three need to be at the table ready to do something.\"\n\n--\n\nFor essential climate news and hopeful developments to your inbox, sign up to the Future Earth newsletter, while The Essential List delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights twice a week.",

        "content": "Om Ali: An 'unforgettable' sweet with a sinister history\n\n14 March 2025 Share Save Soumya Gayatri Share Save\n\nAlamy (Credit: Alamy)\n\nAs millions of people break their Ramadan fast, many believers around the world reach for a wildly popular dish tied to an unbelievable legend.\n\nOn a hot and sultry August evening in 2011, I sat at a table in my favourite restaurant in Kuwait City, facing the calm waters of the Persian Gulf, waiting for my iftar platter to arrive. The elaborate meal – consisting of fresh juices, stuffed dates, vegetable samosas, lamb pilaf, shish tawook (a marinated chicken kebab), local bread, coffee and desserts – was delicious.\n\nYet, what still lingers on my tongue and in my mind more than a decade later isn't the delightful crunch of the samosa or the sapid juiciness of the shish tawook but the sweet taste of Om Ali, a simple-but-flavourful Egyptian dessert with a surprisingly dark history.\n\nFlash forward to 2025 and I'm standing in a small confectionery store in downtown Cairo, sharing another bowl of Om Ali, this time with my 12-year-old son, and I still can't stop drooling over the dish, despite having tried it in every Middle Eastern city I've visited during the last 14 years.\n\nSoumya Gayatri The author seeks out Om Ali in every Middle Eastern city she visits (Credit: Soumya Gayatri)\n\n\"A good bowl of Om Ali is unforgettable,\" says Nermine Mansour, a former Egyptian diplomat-turned-food writer and founder of the food blog, Chez Nermine. \"It is the perfect balance of flavours, textures and nutrition – the star of Egyptian cuisine,\" she adds.\n\nOm Ali (also known as Umm Ali or Oum Ali) is a decadent bread pudding made from spice-infused milk, puff pastry, roasted nuts and sugar. Traditionally baked in a deep clay dish for about 20-25 minutes, it has a crunchy, caramelised coating at the top and a silky, creamy layer at the bottom, giving the dessert a unique texture. According to Mansour, the creaminess of the milk, the juiciness of the soaked puff pastry, the crunch from the nuts and the sweet earthiness lent by the clay pot come together to give Om Ali a rare appeal, making it one of the most popular desserts in Egypt.\n\nWhere to find Om Ali Although Om Ali is available at all major cafes and bakeries in Egypt throughout the year, the variety and volume are staggering during Ramadan. Some of the best places to sample authentic Om Ali in Cairo are El Malky, Simonds Bakery & Café and Nola Bakery.\n\nOm Ali is also a favourite across the Middle East, particularly during Ramadan and Eid celebrations when dessert consumption skyrockets. Earlier this year, B Laban, one of the fastest-growing Middle Eastern dessert companies, posted a video of Om Ali on Instagram and thousands of people quickly swooned over it.\n\n\"I get why Om Ali is so popular. It is affordable, easy to digest and can be prepared quickly using ingredients available at home, making it equally accessible to the rich and the poor,\" says Moustafa Omran, an Egyptologist and my local tour guide in Cairo. \"Despite the fame of this dish, a question always lingers in the minds of [Om Ali] lovers: who is Ali and who is his mother, after whom this dish is named?\" Omran points out, drawing my attention to the dessert's name.\n\nAlamy Om Ali is especially popular during Ramadan, and is one of Egypt's most beloved sweets (Credit: Alamy)\n\nWith my mouth stuffed with soaked puff pastry and my mind going nuts over the creaming pudding at El Malky, one of the most famous dessert chains serving Om Ali in Cairo, I cannot help but agree.\n\nOm Ali, which means \"Mother of Ali\" in Arabic, is an admittedly unusual name for a dessert. Yet, what's even more unusual, as many Egyptians tell me, is that it is rumoured to be named after a murderer.\n\nOm Ali was the first wife of the first sultan of the Mamluk dynasty, which ruled Egypt from the mid-13th to early 16th Centuries. In 1250, her then-husband, Izz Al-Din Aybak overthrew the Ayyubid dynasty and established the Mamluk reign in Egypt, marrying Shajar Al-Durr, the last Ayyubid queen, to solidify his rule. The marriage was merely a political union and Al-Durr had frequent disagreements with Aybak before finally deciding to murder him as he took a bath.\n\nIn a bizarre turn of events, Om Ali decided to avenge her husband's death by beating Al-Durr to death with wooden clogs. After killing Al-Durr, Om Ali instructed her cook to bake something special to commemorate her success and the eponymous dessert was allegedly born and named in her honour.\n\nAlamy Om Ali is rumoured to hark back to the Mamluk dynasty – and a bizarre murder (Credit: Alamy)\n\nAs surprised as I am to learn that Om Ali's origins may be rooted in murder and betrayal, deeper research reveals that the dish's origins are even more complex, and still baffle historians.\n\n\"There are no historical records that tell us if the dessert Om Ali is connected to the murder of Al-Durr,\" says Dr Mennat-Allah El Dorry, a food historian at the American University in Cairo. \"Although we know for sure that Queen Om Ali killed Al-Durr, we do not have any concrete evidence linking the dessert to the murder… I have absolutely no idea how the narrative came about and how the dessert got its name.\"\n\nWorld's Table BBC.com's World's Table \"smashes the kitchen ceiling\" by changing the way the world thinks about food, through the past, present and future.\n\nFurther, the oldest recorded recipe for Om Ali comes from a more recent 19th-Century Arabic cookbook titled Kitāb nasị̄hạt al-anām fī hụsn al-tạʻām, which adds another layer of mystery to the dish's origins and nomenclature.\n\nYet, according to Mansour, the 13th-Century Om Ali narrative may hold some truth. \"Egyptians have eaten a thin phyllo bread called roqaq since ancient times,\" she says. According to the book The Pharaoh's Kitchen by Magda Mehdawy and Amr Hussein, roqaq has been a staple at Nubian banquets since the 3rd Century BCE. \"So, it is quite possible that Om Ali's cook used the leftover roqaq in the palace and baked it with milk and nuts to create the iconic dessert that we all love today.\"\n\nAlamy Om Ali is also known as Egyptian bread pudding or Egyptian bread roqaq (Credit: Alamy)\n\nDespite the dessert's muddled origins, its connection to the killer of Al-Durr live on in Egyptian popular culture. Today, the name Om Ali is synonymous with good triumphing over evil – in this case, the unjust queen.\n\n\"We love it because of its association with the story of the victory of justice over injustice,\" says Omran. \"Also, we [Egyptians] love stories; therefore, this dish has gained immense popularity,\" he explains. The legend continues to endure in social media, food blogs and television, such as the 2004 popular drama series Abbas Al Abiad Fi Al Yawm Al Aswad, in which famous Egyptian actor Yehia El-Fakharany recounts the legend of Om Ali to his onscreen family.\n\nThe popularity of Om Ali swells during Ramadan, as sugar-based desserts take centre stage in iftar meals around the globe, providing instant nourishment to a fasting body that has run out of glucose. \"In addition to sugar, Om Ali contains protein and calcium from milk, vitamins and fibre from nuts, and carbohydrates from bread,\" Mansour points out. \"That's why, [Om Ali] is a guilty pleasure you can easily justify. It feels like a warm hug in a clay pot filled with goodness,\" she adds. (A calorie analysis reveals that Om Ali has fewer calories compared to other Middle Eastern desserts like kunefe and baklava.)\n\nBesides, Om Ali is an easy dessert to make. \"It requires only simple ingredients found in every Egyptian kitchen,\" Mansour adds. Depending on the size of the iftar parties, this dish can be scaled up or down, making it a favourite among chefs and home cooks during Ramadan and Eid.\n\nAlamy The dish provides simple, sugary nourishment to those during Ramadan (Credit: Alamy)\n\nOm Ali holds a special place in Egyptian cuisine because it is simple, nutritious and evokes feelings of warmth and goodness. \"The creaminess of the pudding, the crunch of roasted nuts and the story of the victory of good over bad – a bowl of Om Ali just feels right and makes me happy after a long day of fasting,\" says Omran.\n\n--\n\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.",

        "content": "An F1 driver's fast and furious guide to Tokyo\n\n12 hours ago Share Save Gregory Wakeman Share Save\n\nBen Cooke (Credit: Ben Cooke)\n\nRed Bull's driver Yuki Tsunoda talks us through the must-see places in Tokyo ahead of his home race at the Japanese Grand Prix.\n\nWhenever Yuki Tsunoda returns to fast and furious Tokyo after months of (literally) racing around the globe, it's the city's bountiful food options that help remind him he's home.\n\nThe SpeciaList Formula 1 driver Yuki Tsunoda, the youngest ever Japanese F1 driver, began his career at AlphaTauri in the 2021 season. He has driven 90 races for the team, which rebranded as RB at the start of the 2024 campaign. At the 2024 Japanese Grand Prix, he became the first homegrown racer to score a point at the Suzuka Circuit since 2012.\n\n\"When I'm back I always make a detailed plan of where I'm going to eat,\" declares the young Red Bull driver; known for being one of Formula 1's biggest foodies. \"On every single street and every single block there are so many great restaurants. The competition for food is so high as currently Tokyo has the highest concentration of Michelin star restaurants in the world.\n\nA native of Sagamihara city, around 47km south-west of Tokyo, Tsunoda – who now lives in Faenza, Italy – heads straight to Tokyo whenever he's back in Japan. \"Even when I return to Japan now, which happens around three times a year, I normally stay in Tokyo,\" he says. \"That's where I can do business, enjoy the food and experience the nightlife. It's always so fun to be back there.\"\n\nEach April, Tsunoda's return to Tokyo is particularly triumphant when he races in his home Grand Prix. For Tsunoda, what separates the Japanese Grand Prix from the other tracks is the scintillating and contagious atmosphere, which he insists he \"can feel in the car\". Every time Tsunoda emerges at the Suzuka Circuit, he's greeted with a tidal wave of cheers and support that only increases when he's in the car and racing around the circuit.\n\nThe excitement was particularly vibrant at the 2024 Japanese Grand Prix, when he finished 10th to become the first Japanese drive to score points since 2012. \"As soon as I got out of the car, I could see so many people were happy,\" he says. \"With that kind of support, you just feel like a hero. You also feel extra pressure too, and responsibility. But it's a special feeling.\"\n\nAfter the race, Tsunoda had no shortage of ways to celebrate. As the world's most populous metropolitan area, home to more than 41 million residents as of 2024, Tokyo is constantly abuzz with energy and excitement. Visitors (and locals) get lost in its bustling markets and bask in its futuristic, neon-lit shopping and nightlife sectors, while the city's many parks, gardens and ancient temples mean there's also room for contemplation and self-reflection.\n\nHere are Tsunoda's top ways to enjoy Tokyo – off the grid.\n\nAlamy Tokyo Skytree is 634m high and offers amazing views of the entire city (Credit: Alamy)\n\n1. Best scenery: Asakusa and Tokyo Skytree\n\nThe city now known as Tokyo began life as a small fishing village called Edo, inhabited since ancient times. Today, its centuries of rich history are proudly on display in its captivating backdrop of modern skyscrapers set against historic temples. Each of the city's 23 wards offers unique sights – like youthful, trendy Shibuya with its iconic \"scramble\" street crossing; and Ginza, lined with elegant luxury boutiques.\n\nTip: The best time of year to visit Tokyo is undeniably the end of March or in April, says Tsunoda. There's one very good reason for that: cherry blossom season. \"They're only around for a very short time, so you need a bit of luck. But the cherry blossom trees bloom across all of Tokyo. It makes the city so beautiful.\" Tsunoda's favourite place to enjoy the sight is down by Meguro River. It's home to a tree-lined path that's more than 4km long; a picturesque and relaxing place to soak up Japan's natural wonder.\n\nWhen Tsunoda wants to soak up Tokyo's modern-meets-ancient scenery, he heads to Asakusa, a serene neighbourhood known for its traditional charm and for being one of Tokyo's main geisha districts. \"If you want to see the traditional side in Japan, the Sensō-ji temple is so nice,\" says Tsunoda. Known for its majestic Hozomon Gate, Sensō-ji is the oldest temple in Tokyo; a five-storey pagoda and Buddhist place of worship that instantly transports you to 7th-Century Japan. Visitors to Asakusa can also stroll down Nakamise-dori; one of Japan's oldest shopping streets.\n\nAnd for a mile-high view of the city, Tsunoda suggests visiting Tokyo Skytree. The tallest freestanding tower in the world at 634m, Tokyo Skytree offers stunning, all-encompassing views of Tokyo and beyond. \"It's the highest building in Tokyo and you can see the whole city from there,\" says Tsunoda. Visitors can also enjoy the mammoth tower's 300-plus shops and restaurants. Reserving a ticket in advance is strongly recommended to avoid queues.\n\nWebsite: https://www.senso-ji.jp/english/ Address: 2 Chome-3-1 Asakusa, Taito City, Tokyo 111-0032Phone: +81 3-3842-0181\n\nWebsite: https://tokyo-skytree.net/ Address: 1 Chome-1-2 Oshiage, Sumida City, Tokyo 131-0045, Japan Phone: +81 570-550-634 Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/tokyoskytree_official\n\nAlamy Osoba no Kouga soba shop in Minato City is one of the city's most delicious – and reasonably priced – Michelin restaurants (Credit: Alamy)\n\n2. Best culinary experience: Osoba no Kouga\n\nWhenever he's in Tokyo, Tsunoda always hits Osoba no Kouga in Minato City for their soba (buckwheat) noodles. Helmed by Hiroshi Kouga – who has been making soba for more than 20 years – the elegant space remains one of Tokyo's most affordable Michelin-starred soba noodle shops.\n\nTsunoda also insists that visitors try wagyu steak when they're in Tokyo. Translating to \"Japanese cow\", wagyu is globally regarded as premium beef for its flavour and tenderness, made rich and juicy by the distinctive marbling pattern of fat. Tsunoda insists, \"Wagyu just tastes different when it's from a cow fed in Japan.\"\n\nTsunoda's favourite place to enjoy wagyu steak is Ukai-Tei in the upscale Ginza district, lauded for its opulent mixture of Art Noveau and Japanese design. Watching its chefs prepare dishes on a teppan grill adds to the entertainment factor.\n\nWebsite: https://osobanokouga.com/ Address: 2-14-5 Nishiazabu, Minato-ku, Tokyo 106-0031 Phone Number: +81 3-3797-6860\n\nGetty Images Tokyo locals love visiting Tsukiji Outer Market for its fresh seafood market and excellent food stalls (Credit: Getty Images)\n\n3. Best for seafood: Tsukiji Outer Market\n\nSeafood is a staple in Japanese cuisine, taking the starring role in dishes from traditional breakfasts of grilled fish and rice to delicious, rainbow-coloured sushi.\n\nTip: With sushi restaurants seemingly on every corner, Tsunoda offers this advice when picking one: \"You want to make sure it has a counter table and you can sit there and watch the chef cook right in front of you,\" he says. \"It might be a little more expensive. But it's worth it.\"\n\nFor the best fish in town, Tsunoda heads to Tsukiji Outer Market, locally known as Japan's \"Food Town\". Located next to the historic Tsukiji Market where the city's famous tuna auctions were held for decades, the lively market is crammed with stalls selling the freshest seafood. Some of the city's most famous restaurants come here to get their fish, but the market is also packed to the brim with hole-in-the-wall spots where you can snack on some of Japan's most famous foods, like tamagoyaki (omelette on a stick), mochi (glutinous rice cake) and wagyu beef skewers. It's also where Tsunoda says you can find some of Tokyo's best sushi.\n\n\"There are many sushi restaurants at Tsukiji Outer Market,\" he says. \"And since it is a fish market, the fish is very fresh, especially in the morning when you can enjoy it right there… It's just really great to watch people, walk around the fish market and soak up the atmosphere.\"\n\nWebsite: https://www.tsukiji.or.jp/english/ Address: 104-0045 Tokyo, Chuo City, Tsukiji Phone number: +81 3-3541-9444 Instagram: @tsukijicity\n\nAlamy Harajuku is Tokyo's premier shopping district, and where Tsunoda heads for a hit of high fashion (Credit: Alamy)\n\n4. Best shopping: Harajuku\n\nWith scores of luxury and indie boutiques, Tokyo is a shopper's paradise – and there are a variety of areas that cater to Tsunoda's eclectic tastes. \"I go to Harajuku when I want more street-style fashion that younger people wear. There's a lot there,\" he says. Located just east of Shibuya, Harajuku – known as Japan's top fashion district – is full of colourful street art, while its mass of clothing and cosplay stores, hip bars and alluring dessert shops means it's constantly buzzing with youthful vigour.\n\nTsunoda's first port of call in Harajuku is GR8, which is home to many of the city's up and coming designers, selling popular clothes and footwear from the US and Europe. Its neon interior and wooden entrance makes it one of the most distinct shops in the city, too. But if Tsunoda is after vintage fashion, he heads to the Shimokitazawa neighbourhood, regarded as one of Tokyo's most bohemian areas, full of music venues, cafes and clothing stores. \"That's where you'll find more casual stuff,\" he says. When in Shimokitazawa, Tsunoda shops at BABE store, a used and vintage clothing shop where you can easily spend hours looking for lost gems amidst its mass of items.\n\nFor luxury clothes shopping, Tsunoda suggests the very fashionable Omotesando district, sometimes referred to as the Champs-Elysees of the city. \"That's where you get the brand stuff,\" he says. \"The items that are higher in price and where the most famous brands are.\"\n\nTsunoda likes jumping from store to store in the Tadao Ando-designed Omotesando Hills shopping complex. Home to high-end designer boutiques and imports from across the world, there's also the occasional vintage store and fine dining option, too.\n\nAlamy Bar Centifolia – famed for its theatrical bartenders – is Tsunoda's Tokyo nightlife pick (Credit: Alamy)\n\n5. Best nightlife: Bar Centifolia\n\nThe one drinking establishment Tsunoda always tries to frequent when he's in town is Bar Centifolia, located in the laid-back Azabu Juban neighbourhood; home to embassies as well as a smattering of bars and restaurants.\n\nThe tiny bar has an exclusive, intimate feel with just 12 seats, and its theatrical bartenders have earned the spot a reputation for doubling as a performance space — tipplers will witness staff ferociously throwing bottles into the air, using liquid nitrogen and blue fire to create a specific taste and even chopping ice with a katana.\n\n\"Its bartender Yuzo Komai recently went viral because of the drinks that he makes,\" says Tsunoda. \"A lot of famous people have started going there. A lot of tourists, too. But it's such a nice bar.\" Komai's attention to detail when making cocktails, mixing each drink with surgical precision, recently saw him land the Suntory Cocktail Award Champion, one of the most coveted bartender prizes in the city.\n\nBBC Travel's The SpeciaList is a series of guides to popular and emerging destinations around the world, as seen through the eyes of local experts and tastemakers.\n\n--\n\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.",

        "content": "'Banal and hollow': Why the quaint paintings of Thomas Kinkade divided the US\n\n6 days ago Share Save Nicholas Barber Share Save\n\n(Image credit: The Kinkade Family Foundation)\n\nBeloved by many, despised by others, Thomas Kinkade's quaint rustic scenes and his wholesome image belied a dark and tortured story that contrasts with his 'sugary' artworks.\n\nThomas Kinkade was one of the best-selling artists in history, as well as one of the most divisive. When he died in 2012, the American painter had been rocked by business problems, but at his commercial peak a decade earlier, his company was bringing in more than $100m a year. And yet his work was despised by many critics – not because it was blasphemous or obscene, but because, well, he specialised in quaint pictures of thatched-roof rural cottages nestling in leafy groves. \"Thomas Kinkade's style is illustrative saccharine fantasy rather than art with which you can connect at any meaningful level,\" Charlotte Mullins, the author of A Little History of Art, tells the BBC. \"It is schmaltzy pastiches of Disney-style woodland scenes, complete with cutesy animals and fairy tale cottages. They are… like the images you find on cheap greetings cards – sugary and forgettable.\" And compared to some critics, Mullins is being polite.\n\nHis branding was so effective that you didn't know there was this really complicated and I would say tortured artist behind it all – Miranda Yousef\n\nThese critics don't just consider Kinkade's paintings to be nauseatingly sickly, they detect something disturbing and ominous about them. In her 2003 book on California, Where I Was From, Joan Didion summed up his art by saying. \"It typically featured a cottage or a house of such insistent cosiness as to seem actually sinister, suggestive of a trap designed to attract Hansel and Gretel. Every window was lit, to lurid effect, as if the interior of the structure might be on fire.\" As harsh as that sounds, Didion may have been more perceptive than she realised. Art for Everybody, a new documentary directed by Miranda Yousef, shows that the man who called himself the \"Painter of Light\" did indeed have a dark side. \"His branding was so effective that you didn't know there was this really complicated and I would say tortured artist behind it all,\" Yousef tells the BBC. \"He lived a Greek tragedy of a life.\"\n\nThe Kinkade Family Foundation Kinkade specialised in quaint pictures of rural cottages, which were loved by many, but despised by critics (Credit: The Kinkade Family Foundation)\n\nThe documentary features audio tapes recorded by Kinkade when he was a long-haired, bohemian-looking art student in California in the 1970s – and even then, he was already fretting over the question of whether he could make an impact as an artist while making a decent living. After a stint in Hollywood, painting backgrounds for Ralph Bakshi's 1983 animated feature film, Fire and Ice, he concentrated on idealised, nostalgic American landscapes, and he and his wife Nanette sold reproductions of them outside a local grocer's shop. In the 1990s, he took the idealism and the nostalgia to new heights, and swapped his rugged vistas for soft-focus pastoral scenes that a Hobbit might deem a bit on the twee side. Old-fashioned lampposts and cottage windows glowed. Streams twinkled beneath slender stone footbridges. Bushes burst with pastel flowers. And cash registers rang. Kinkade didn't sell the paintings themselves, but the hazy idylls they depicted were soon being printed on collectible plates advertised in newspapers and magazines. For many Americans, they were comforting refuges from the modern world.\n\nToday we would think they had been produced by AI, designed as if by algorithm to a certain formula – Charlotte Mullins\n\nIn Art for Everybody, Christopher Knight, the art critic of the Los Angeles Times, is contemptuous of Kinkade's imagery. \"It's a cliché piled upon a fantasy piled upon a bad idea,\" he says. \"The colour is juiced and the light coming from inside those cottages is intense and blaring.\" Just as importantly, as far as his critics were concerned, Kinkade's pictures had nothing to them beyond their superficial decorative qualities. \"They are banal and hollow, with no intent to say anything meaningful,\" says Mullins. \"Today we would think they had been produced by AI – designed as if by algorithm to a certain formula.\" But Yousef insists that Kinkade's skill can't be discounted. \"There were actually other people who were painting cottages and Christmas scenes and putting them on plates and all that stuff,\" she notes, \"and the thing is that Kinkade's were so much better. His works just blew everybody else's out of the water.\"\n\nShe also believes that Kinkade's paintings, rather than being wholly market-led, were linked to his childhood in Placerville, California, where he was raised by his single mother and only intermittently saw his violent father. \"It's a common criticism that his cottages look like they're on fire on the inside. And then you learn that it was because when he was growing up it was always cold and dark in the house when he got home, because they didn't have the money to keep the heat and the lights on. He was painting the thing that he wanted.\"\n\nThe Kinkade Family Foundation Kinkade focused on idealised, nostalgic American landscapes, before swapping his rugged vistas for soft-focus pastoral scenes (Credit: The Kinkade Family Foundation)\n\nKinkade's deprived upbringing, says Yousef, didn't just inspire his choice of subject matter, but drove him to make as much money as he could. He and his business partners printed pictures on an industrial scale, as well as putting his immediately recognisable imagery on furniture and ornaments, and selling them on the QVC shopping network. They also set up hundreds of faux olde worlde Thomas Kinkade Signature Galleries in shopping malls around the US, and trademarked the \"Painter of Light\" brand. Again, Yousef doesn't see Kinkade as entirely calculating. Having grown up in a house with no pictures on the walls, \"He sincerely believed that art should be accessible to everyone.\"\n\nBehind the fantasy\n\nWhatever you thought of the paintings, the mass-marketing of the work of a single artist was certainly groundbreaking. In interviews at the time, Kinkade asserted that he was no different from an author selling stacks of novels or a musician selling CDs. He even declared that by industrialising his output, he was doing what Andy Warhol had always dreamt of. But Mullins argues that Kinkade was being \"obfuscatory and disingenuous\" by churning out reproductions by the thousand, paying his assistants to add a few dabs of paint here and there, and then selling these prints for thousands of dollars, as if they were rare and precious works of art. \"Prints offer an affordable way of buying art by great artists,\" she says. \"They retain their value through the limited nature of the edition. This was never Kinkade's strategy.\"\n\nThe Kinkade Family Foundation Kinkade printed pictures and merchandise on an industrial scale and trademarked the \"Painter of Light\" brand (Credit: The Kinkade Family Foundation)\n\nStill, this sort of disagreement between Kinkade and his critics was one of his selling points. Art for Everybody features news reports and promotional videos, in which he tells adoring audiences that his art could be understood and appreciated by everyone, whereas only the snooty elite could see anything artistic about Chris Ofili putting elephant dung on his canvases, or Tracey Emin presenting her unmade bed to gallery-goers. \"This is not legitimate art,\" he proclaimed. As much a televangelist as a painter, Kinkade was a born-again Christian who assured his devotees that buying his work put them on the right side of a political and spiritual line separating them from decadent metropolitan tastemakers. He trademarked the sobriquet \"Painter of Light\", not just because of all the sunlit clouds and fiery cottages in his pictures, but to signify that he was a force for virtue and Christianity. \"The art world is a world of darkness today,\" he thundered. He, in contrast, was \"someone who stands up for family and God and country and beauty\". A doughy, plaid shirt-wearing fellow with a thick moustache, he often appeared on television with his blonde wife and his four blonde daughters: the embodiment of wholesome, traditional, all-American values. His fans weren't just paying for his pictures; they were paying to associate themselves with this proudly conservative persona.\n\nBut that persona, like the pictures themselves, was more a fantasy that Kinkade wished for than an accurate representation of reality. He was prone to swearing after the directors of his mawkishvideos called \"cut\". He relied on alcohol to cope with work pressures. And, in the documentary, his daughters say that they were encouraged to smile in videos and personal appearances, but often felt as if their father cared more about his career than about them. \"Thomas Kinkade and his persona and his brand really cast an extraordinarily long, dark shadow over his entire family,\" says Yousef, \"and there was a lot wrapped up in perpetuating the brand and preserving it.\"\n\nIn order to maintain this brand and the vast business empire that went with it, Kinkade had to present himself as a Christian paragon, and he had to complete a stylistically identical painting every month. That meant that he had to suppress other, more conflicted parts of his psyche. The strain became too much. In the mid-2000s, Kinkade fell out with his business partners, and had legal battles with gallery franchisees. He reinvented himself as a womanising, hard-drinking hellraiser. After some interventions by his friends and family, some time in rehab, and the collapse of his marriage, he died of an accidental overdose of alcohol and diazepam at the age of 54.\n\nArt for Everybody The documentary Art for Everybody explores the dark, troubled person behind the wholesome persona Kinkade had created (Credit: Art for Everybody)\n\nIt was only after his death that his family sorted through the vault containing his artwork, and uncovered a stash of bleak, violent drawings and paintings that seemed to express his inner rage and fear in a way that his cottage paintings never could: a shack in the middle of nowhere on a murky night; a nun pointing a gun at herself; giant monsters and distorted faces. Art for Everybody raises the questions of whether these pictures are more authentic than the ones the public knew about. Do they express how Kinkade really felt about his difficult upbringing and his frightening father? Would it have been healthier for him to explore the shadowy netherworlds in these pictures instead of shutting himself inside his stifling sylvan cottages, year after year? And were his critics right to say that his famous paintings were disturbing all along? \"One of the things that was obvious early on,\" says Yousef, \"was that his fans had a two-dimensional view of him and his critics had another completely different two-dimensional view of him. I knew there was a three-dimensional person in there somewhere, and that's what I wanted to try to find.\"\n\nIn some ways, Kinkade was ahead of his time. First, he was a culture warrior before culture wars were being fought as fiercely as they are now. As someone who claimed that he was taking a stand for Christianity and patriotism and against the intellectual elite, he was staking out territory occupied by more and more in the US today. He was also ahead of his time as an artist with such a brazen commercial side. \"Today we're seeing all these artist collabs,\" says Yousef. \"There's Yayoi Kusama who's working with Louis Vuitton, and Tom Sachs is working with Nike, and Kehinde Wiley is doing a collab with American Express, whereas you see in the movie an MBNA bank card with a Thomas Kinkade painting on it. He was already doing it 20 or 30 years ago.\"\n\nFinally, by calling himself the Painter of Light, and by trading on his pious family-man persona, Kinkade turned himself into a kind of product. \"Look at where we are today with social media, and everybody being a brand,\" says Yousef. \"He was really ahead of his time with that. But I think that one of the big questions of the film is, what are the costs of turning yourself into a brand?\" In Kinkade's case, the costs were unbearably high.\n\nArt for Everybody is released on 28 March in the US.\n\n--",

        "source": "https://www.bbc.com/",
        "content": "Mālama: The word embodying the spirit of Hawaii\n\n2 days ago Share Save Kate Eshelby Share Save\n\nAlamy (Credit: Alamy)\n\nMeaning \"to give back\", this ancient concept is a way of life – and a tourism initiative offering travellers fascinating local experiences and perks.\n\nI watched as smooth, purple poi streamed from the grinder, filling a large bucket in the centre of the small room. Earlier, I'd scraped away the rough skin of taro (the Pacific's answer to the potato), washing and cubing them with a knife. From a raised ledge, two men waited to grind it into the thick, starchy paste that has sustained generations of Hawaiians.\n\nMy husband, children and I were at the Waipā Foundation headquarters; a nonprofit on Kaua'i's lush North Shore dedicated to land conservation and reviving traditional agricultural practices. Waipā exemplifies the ancient Hawaiian concept of mālama (\"to care for\") which encourages visitors to give back to the environment and local communities through activities like habitat restoration, beach cleanups or food provision. But Mālama goes beyond eco-tourism: it's about leaving a place better than you found it. And after seeking out these experiences during a three-week stay, we found mālama not only improves Hawaii, it also made our time there much more meaningful.\n\nAlamy From restoring native forests to preparing poi, Hawaii is full of mālama-inspired volunteer experiences (Credit: Alamy)\n\nWe had begun the morning sipping traditional māmaki tea and eating homemade banana bread in the sunshine, as Waipā's guide, Kelsey Ke'alohilani Rogers, shared the legend of kalo (taro in Hawaiian) and how this root vegetable became an iconic part of Hawaiian culture. According to local beliefs, Earth Mother and Sky Father had a stillborn son. From the spot where he was buried, the first kalo plant grew, later nourishingtheir next son, Hāloa, the first human. \"This is why kalo is more than food; it's family,\" Rogers explained.\n\nThe best of 2025 Hawaii was named one of BBC Travel's 25 best places to visit in 2025, a list highlighting destinations that are not only welcoming visitors, but using tourism as a force for good. See the full list here.\n\nBut keeping this sacred staple on Hawaiian tables is becoming harder. Land in Hawaii is expensive, and the high cost of living requires many families to work multiple jobs, which is why Waipā gives nutrient-rich poi away or sells it at cost to locals.\n\n\"Here, you're not just learning – you're supporting people by producing affordable food,\" Rogers added. \"Simply paying for knowledge is extractive, but this is reciprocal.\" Waipā offers several food and farm tours, as well as a monthly volunteer morning to help with agroforestry, reforestation and removing invasive weeds.\n\nThe roots of mālama run deep. Hawaii is the most isolated archipelago on Earth, a volcanic cluster of eight main islands, marooned 2,390 miles south-west of California. Centuries before mass tourism, Hawaiians thrived under a sustainable resource management system known as ahupua'a. As she spoke, Rogers traced her finger along a colourful paper map showing how everything was interlinked from the mountains to the sea: what happened upland affected the reefs, waterways and forest. Mālama 'āina (caring for the land) has always been a deeply ingrained Hawaiian value – a fact the Mālama programme's participants are keen to teach visitors today.\n\nAlamy Mālama 'āina was the law of the land before mass tourism (Credit: Alamy)\n\n\"Living on these distant islands meant we had to be self-sufficient and understand our environment,\" she said. \"The Western world was different – it just conquered and took what it needed.\"\n\nNow, generations after Hawaii became a US state in 1959 and the rise of jet travel propelled this \"Paradise of the Pacific\" to become a major tourist destination, many Hawaiians and local residents believe a return to the islands' traditional ways is long overdue.\n\n\"Mālama today is more vital than ever,\" Rogers said. \"Too many tourists trample over our land, ignoring restrictions and damaging sensitive ecosystems… Don't just think Hawaii is beautiful; help keep it that way. It's a shared responsibility.\" As Rogers explained, mālama isn't about seeing or appreciating a landscape; it invites visitors to connect and contribute to it, with the idea that caring for a place fosters a stronger relationship with it.\n\n\"Most tourists leave never knowing anything about our culture,\" she continued. \"Despite what many think, it's not just about going to a lū'au or surfing.\"\n\nNearby, outside the poi mill in the Waipā base, I listened to the rhythmic sound of singing as Hawaiians joined hands in a piko (circle), symbolising connection, to bless the food.\n\nAlamy The Four Seasons Resort Maui at Wailea, where the first season of The White Lotus was filmed, is part of the Mālama programme (Credit: Alamy)\n\nAs part of the initiative, we stayed at two hotels that encourage mālama: the Grand Hyatt Kauai Resort & Spa, which offers a free fifth night if guests participate in a beach cleanup; and 1 Hotel Hanalei Bay. Both properties highlight mālama-focused experiences in their daily programmes, partnering with organisations like the National Tropical Botanical Garden, the Surfrider Foundation, Waipā and the Kaua'i Humane Society. Our youngest was especially keen to try the latter, which lets visitors adopt a shelter dog for the day and take it out exploring.\n\n\"For many, Hawaii is just a playground, a Disneyland,\" a lifeguard by the Hyatt hotel pool told me. \"A huge number of homes have become holiday rentals, pushing locals out. If tourism is going to work here, it must benefit the local community.\"\n\nAfter volunteering at the Waipā Foundation, we visited Common Ground, also on Kaua'i's North Shore – a regenerative farm that was once a sugar plantation, and which encourages mālama 'āina. We joined one of its food and feast tours, where guests are shown around before sharing a meal that celebrates the island's bounty.\n\n\"Monoculture plantations like sugar were run by big companies that came to our islands, stripped the soil bare, and then left,\" our guide, Sophia Reinheimer, explained. But this farm is different: here, the soil is nurtured through regenerative practices, such as planting diverse crops rather than just one. All of the ingredients used in the food served come from Kaua'i – either grown on the farm itself or sourced from nearby producers. That's rare in Hawaii, where 90% of the food is imported.\n\nKate Eshelby The author's family took part in a lei-making workshop (Credit: Kate Eshelby)\n\n\"Mālama also means eating responsibly, choosing ocean-friendly restaurants and shopping at the many farmers'markets,\" Reinheimer added. But it extends beyond food – supporting local businesses and buying locally made souvenirs has a positive impact, too.\n\nWe also took part in a newly launched lei-making workshop in Common Ground's lush garden. As we twisted ti leaves into a lei hili (a rope-like lei), our teacher, Ivory Lloyd, shared the deeper significance behind the tradition. \"Lei making is the ultimate expression of aloha (the Hawaiian belief that all things, people and nature, are connected and deserve love),\" she said. \"It connects us to the land; we honour the plants we use and ask permission before picking them.\"\n\nYet, like many aspects of Hawaiian culture, traditional lei-making faced obstacles. After Hawaii's 1898 annexation by the US, many cultural practices – including the Hawaiian language and hula – were banned. It wasn't until the Hawaiian Renaissance of the 1960s that these traditions began to revive, and today, mālama plays a role in keeping them alive.\n\nMaile Brown from the Kaua'i Visitors Bureau told me how the mālama programme began. \"After Covid, we saw how much healthier the land was without the crowds,\" she said. \"We wanted to redefine tourism, to encourage greater respect for Hawaii's people and place.\"\n\nAlamy Visitors can volunteer at Limahuli Garden & Preserve on Kaua'i (Credit: Alamy)\n\nWhat began as a list of participating businesses has evolved into a broader initiative, offering visitors opportunities to either volunteer during their stay, or engage with local businesses and nonprofits that embody mālama. Since Covid, the islands' message to visitors remains simple: come as you would into someone's home, and if you're willing, here's how you can help care for it.\n\n\"Tourism is about education,\" Brown continued. \"If you leave understanding the complexity and beauty of a place, you develop a reverence for it.\" While volunteering is one way to practise mālama, learning about Hawaii is just as essential. \"It's about perpetuating local culture,\" she continued. \"This is our kuleana, our responsibility.\" Then, she added, with a smile, \"Of course, be sure to enjoy the island's beauty, the variety of activities – just put mālama into the mix, and in your heart.\"\n\nOn another day, we joined the Surfrider Foundation, which organises beach cleanups for volunteers, including tourists. We were the only non-locals, so as we collected plastic, we talked about island life. At the end, as a rainbow revealed itself above, we shared homemade cookies and cupcakes. Our sons enjoyed exploring the beach while filling hessian sacks, and, under supervision, helped to cut the discarded ropes. It was shocking to learn that more than 52 metric tonnes of debris enter Hawaii every year – much of it from the Great Pacific Garbage Patch, with almost half composed of commercial fishing waste.\n\nOn our last day on Kaua'i, we went to Limahuli Garden & Preserve. While we chose to wander on our own, guided tours (Tuesdays and Thursdays at 09:00) highlight its conservation work. \"We steward a modern ahupua'a,\" volunteer coordinator Sonia Adame said. Visitors can volunteer too, removing invasive species or planting in the nursery.\n\nKate Eshelby Greg Solitario and his son, Devak, press their foreheads and noses together in the ancient Hawaiian greeting (Credit: Kate Eshelby)\n\nAfter eight days on Kauai'i, we ventured to Molokai, the least visited of all the Hawaiian Islands. There are no resorts, no chain stores, no billboards – just swirling seas at the foot of some of the world's tallest cliffs, forests of flaming red ʻōhiʻa trees and candy-coloured clapboard churches.\n\nWe travelled deep into Hālawa Valley on the island’s far eastern edge to visit Greg Solatario, a native Hawaiian cultural practitioner who lives off-grid on the land his ancestors have stewarded for centuries. Solatario embodies mālama – committed to nurturing the land and preserving Hawaiian culture. After welcoming us into his home, he led us through long-abandoned villages lost to the jungle and moss-cloaked heiau (temples).\n\nAs we approached, his son, Devak stepped out to greet us and blew a conch shell, which his father answered with another. \"This is to ask permission before entering the land,\" he explained.\n\nBut it was his parting words that lingered longest: mālama can, and should, be a global value, not just a Hawaiian one.\n\n--\n\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.",

        "content": "Your Friends and Neighbors review: 'Radically different from any other show'\n\n12 hours ago Share Save Caryn James Share Save\n\nApple TV+\n\nJon Hamm excels in Apple TV+'s \"emotionally real but absurdist\" drama about a desperate corporate man who resorts to stealing from his neighbours.\n\nJon Hamm has his best role since Mad Men and brings all his sharp comic timing and dramatic nuance to it as Andrew Cooper, known as Coop, a hedge-fund manager who loses his job and manoeuvres to maintain his elaborate lifestyle and sense of himself. If you took Don Draper and dropped him into 2025 he might be Coop, a corporate man with a broken marriage and two teenaged children, a decent guy and a charmer with all-around bad judgement. Your Friends and Neighbors is emotionally real and affecting but also absurdist and funny, a rare combination.\n\nThe series is edgier and smarter than its entertaining surface suggests\n\nThe show begins with Coop waking up in a pool of blood next to a man's dead body in the foyer of a neighbour's mansion. He cleans up the blood – a bad move – and in one of the many mordant voiceovers that run through the series, looks back four months to reflect on \"the swirling hot mess of my life\". His worst choice is replacing his lost income by stealing loot from friends so rich they'll never miss it. The robberies are the comic vein in the story, but also a Trojan horse for its drama. Coop is hurt and distraught over the loss of his marriage, but that theme exists next to the caper-like thefts. The series is edgier and smarter than its entertaining surface suggests, as it deftly takes on issues of family, class privilege, vapid materialism and toxic masculinity.\n\nLike most series, this could start a bit faster, as it sets up the life Coop is accustomed to in a suburban New York community of huge houses and country clubs, where $200,000 cars and $60,000 donations to charity are ordinary. That was his life until he found his wife Mel (Amanda Peet) in bed with his so-called friend, Nick (Mark Tallman), a former basketball star still in great shape. The divorce has sent Coop out of his expansive home into a smaller rental house nearby.\n\nBut soon enough the first episode gets to its boldest turn as we see why Coop lost his job. A woman who works at his firm, whom he has never met and who doesn't report to him, comes on to him in a bar. Months later, that consensual hookup leads to his being fired for violating the company's HR rules. Pop culture has at times gingerly dipped a toe into the theme of sexual harassment. On The Morning Show, Steve Carell's character, a toxic predator, was sent off a cliff to die. But there has been nothing as complicated as this. The show doesn't deny Coop's bad judgement but also makes it clear through the woman herself and Coop's ruthless boss that the HR rule was a convenient excuse to get rid of him while keeping his clients. The show doesn't go far beyond that in exploring the issue, but it sets up the series' complex realism about social standards.\n\nA non-compete clause makes Coop unhireable, but he insists on keeping up appearances. His burglaries are treated like adventures, punctuated by mock ads as he describes the luxury items he's lifting, with voiceovers that slyly echo Hamm's in all those Mercedes-Benz commercials. \"The Patek Phillippe Nautilus: sealed 18-carat white gold...\" Coop says, talking about an item no one really needs.\n\nThe series' real strength, though, is in his relationships, most of them driven by his wounded pride, and the way his identity has been tied to his role as a successful man of the world. Hamm smoothly navigates the shifts in tone, never allowing the humour to flag while letting us see the emotional pain Coop won't reveal to anyone around him. There is a lot of residual affection between Coop and his cheating ex-wife, whom Peet manages to make sympathetic. When Mel worries and asks him what's wrong, he displays a classic alpha-male inability to share feelings. \"I'm fine,\" he tells her when clearly he is not. Olivia Munn has less to do as Sam, a divorced neighbour and Coop's occasional fling. And Lena Hall is brilliant as Coop's sister, Ali. Briefly off her meds, she stalks her ex-fiancé, sitting on his lawn with her guitar and singing. Hall, who won a Tony for her role in the Broadway revival of Hedwig and the Angry Inch in 2014, sings occasionally through the series – an asset, not an intrusion. She makes Ali empathetic, funny and warm, and the bond between the brother and sister is touching. After she is back on her meds, her romantic subplot suggests that theirs really is a family full of bad choices.\n\nA second season of the show has already been ordered, so the question of whether Coop will pay for his crimes will linger. That plot is an effective hook, but his resonant feelings and increasing self-knowledge set the show apart. At a party of male friends hosted by Nick – why is Coop even there? more bad choices – he looks around at the men who still have their jobs and money, and sees the person he might have become. \"Their future was already written, and so the quest to stave off the emptiness began,\" he says in voiceover, observing their devotion to \"Scotch and cigars\", to \"custom golf clubs and high-end escorts\". He recognises that there are \"entire industries built to cash in on the quiet desperation of rich middle-aged men\". By even acknowledging that desperation, through a hero who is sympathetic – however wrong-headed his path to self-awareness – Your Friends and Neighbors is radically different from any other show around.\n\n★★★★★\n\nYour Friends and Neighbors is on Apple TV+ from 11 April.\n\n--",

But rather than deconstructing the simple ingredient beyond recognition, Eidukevičiusd slow-roasted and lightly smoked the root vegetable before serving it with gira, Lithuania's traditional fermented beverage.\n\n\"I wanted to create a dish that highlights the traditions of Lithuania on a plate, and using gira to make the glaze brought so many flavours together without over-complicating things – it was a no brainer,\" says Eidukevičius. \"The gira adds acid, sweetness and a pleasant tang, which gives more complexity to the otherwise simple vegetable.\"\n\nWhile Eidukevičius' creative approach no doubt helped capture the attention of Michelin inspectors, gira remains largely absent from Lithuania's fine-dining scene. Instead, the naturally fermented drink is a household staple, enjoyed chilled in summer or as a soothing remedy for a sore throat. Once brewed in homes out of necessity – particularly during Soviet times when things were scarce – in recent years, its increased popularity has led it to be mass produced and sold by the can in soft-drink aisles of supermarkets and corner shops throughout the country.\n\nDating back to ancient times, gira is more commonly known as kvass across north-eastern Europe where it can be made with grains, fruits or vegetables, and is widely popular in Baltic and Slavic countries where fermentation traditions run deep.\n\nIeva Šidlaitė The fermentation process produces a slightly carbonated drink that's full of \"good\" bacteria (Credit: Ieva Šidlaitė)\n\n\"Traditionally, [in Lithuania] it was a homemade drink using old rye bread because it was a smart way to use up leftovers,\" says Tomas Josas, a beer historian and 2023 beer sommelier champion of Lithuania who grew up drinking his grandparents' homebrewed gira. \"Fermentation not only preserved nutrients but also lowered the pH, killing harmful bacteria – meaning kvass was often safer to drink than water.\"\n\nA traditional recipe involves soaking toasted or dried-out rye bread in hot water to extract the flavour. Once cooled, yeast and maybe sugar in the form of raisins are added to kickstart the natural fermentation process. It is then cooled, strained and bottled, to be consumed within three to five days. The result is a slightly tart, mildly effervescent drink with an ABV of up to 1.2%, akin to traditionally brewed kombucha, and contains healthy probiotics that benefit gut health and immunity. In Lithuania, traditionalists see it as a tonic for the common cold because it can be made with honey, ginger and other herbs as an immunity booster.\n\nWorld's Table BBC.com's World's Table \"smashes the kitchen ceiling\" by changing the way the world thinks about food, through the past, present and future.\n\n\"When I was little, my grandmother would make gira for Easter and Christmas as a festive drink but I also remember drinking gira when I was sick – consuming it more commonly as a natural remedy,\" explained Ieva Šidlaitė, a cultural historian and the author of Naturally Fermented who teaches fermentation classes on her farm outside Vilnius. \"In the 20th Century, when sugar was available to everyone, it became sweet,\" she added. \"Before this time, it was completely fermented and a sour liquid without any bubbles. It was mostly used to acidify food, make soups and also sauces because in our culture, food is dominated by a sour taste.\"\n\nJosas agrees. \"Many believed kvass was good for digestion and immunity, thanks to its probiotics. My great-grandparents made traditional homebrewed gira, very different from today's commercial versions [that are sweeter]. It had a funky, tangy flavor from lactobacillus – like sauerkraut has, but in liquid form. I wasn't a fan as a child since it lacked sugar, but once I got into beer, I learned to love its complexity,\" he says.\n\nIeva Šidlaitė Kvass is often made with fruit or vegetables, with beetroot being a popular option (Credit: Ieva Šidlaitė)\n\nThe early '80s is what Josas describes as \"the golden age of gira\" with mobile barrels selling it on every street corner during summer. However as global soft drinks like Coke flooded the Baltic market, gira struggled to compete, losing its appeal and audience. To survive, manufacturers began mass-producing the drink using sugar for appeal and cheap malt extract to speed up the process, shifting it closer to soda than traditional fermentation.\n\n\"Kvass lacks a strong identity, a clear drinking culture or an image that appeals to younger generations,\" says Josas, noting that while gira shares the same probiotic qualities of kombucha, it has never been \"hyped\" as a health drink. But things are changing, he says. Artisanal gira brands are reviving traditional methods, tapping into kombucha's success.\n\nOne of Lithuania's largest producers of beer and gira is Gubernija Brewery in northern Lithuania who, despite their large-scale production, still make their gira traditionally: with black grain bread. However, the 360-year-old brewery is also adapting for modern palates.\n\n\"We have created different varieties of kvass to widen our audience in the last few years,\" says Jogailė Čojūtė, export specialist for Gubernija Brewery. \"For example, our white wheat bread gira is aimed at younger consumers who like trendy soft drinks. The taste is much milder. Another popular item we have is the dark rye bread gira with hemp and hints of lime; it is a unique and refreshing twist to our traditional recipe and proves that gira really can stand the test of time.\"\n\n\"In 2024, we observed an 18% increase in the sales volume of owned gira brands compared to the previous year,\" she continues, \"while export sales volume grew by 47%.\"\n\nIeva Šidlaitė In Lithuania, traditionalists see gira as a tonic for the common cold (Credit: Ieva Šidlaitė)\n\nGlobally, interest in non-alcoholic beverages and low-ABV drinks is soaring, and kvass is catching on. In the US, breweries, bakeries and even restaurants have released their own versions of kvass with great success. Dan Woods of Beaver Brewing Company in Pennsylvania produces kvass in his nanobrewery; while at Honey's in East Williamsburg in New York, kvass made an appearance on tap. Made with chunks of toasted dark sourdough rye bread which were left to ferment, the slightly tart drink was sweetened with a touch of honey and also served as a cocktail.\n\nWhere to try Gira In Vilnius, traditional restaurants like Lokys have kvass on the menu; it pairs incredibly well with a plate of smoked cold cuts. Elsewhere around the city, small batch gira made traditionally with bread can be found in health food shops as well as popular city bakery Kmyninė, which uses its leftover sourdough rye.\n\nIn Australia, a string of bakeries have collaborated with local craft breweries to make stronger alcoholic versions, such as Three Mills Bakery in the nation’s capital, Canberra; while in Leeds in the UK, Northern Monk releases a seasonal kvass each year.\n\nWhile some international versions exceed 4% ABV, for Lithuanians, it remains a drink with cultural significance that should only be fermented to 1.2% ABV at most. \"It should not be considered a direct substitute for beer,\" says Čojūtė.\n\nInstead, Eidukevičius says, the beauty of the unassuming drink lends itself to a nice refresher anytime of the day with its sweet, acidic, tangy and even funky taste.\n\n\"Gira, for all its refreshing qualities, can be a bit of a mischievous drink,\" Eidukevičius adds. \"There's a running joke in Lithuanian households about 'gira explosions' because it ferments in closed containers where enormous pressure can build up like a bottle of Champagne. There's nothing quite like walking into a cellar and finding gira sprayed across the walls and ceiling like some kind of fizzy, rye-bread-scented geyser. It's a testament to how alive this drink is. It's a reminder that we're working with natural processes, and sometimes, those processes have a mind of their own.\"\n\nSo, if you find yourself in Lithuania looking for a low-alcohol beverage, consider a glass of gira. \"Drinking gira is a connection to our land and to the traditions that have shaped Lithuania's culture,\" says Eidukevičius.\"It has a long tradition in my beautiful country as more than just a beverage; it's a part of our cultural heritage and a link to our ancestors' traditions.\"\n\n--\n\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.",

A new exhibition explores this close friendship, and how it benefited art history.\n\nOn 23 December, 1888, the day that Vincent van Gogh mutilated his ear and presented the severed portion to a sex worker, he was tended to by an unlikely soulmate: the postman Joseph Roulin.\n\nA rare figure of stability during Van Gogh's mentally turbulent two years in Arles, in the South of France, Roulin ensured that he received care in a psychiatric hospital, and visited him while he was there, writing to the artist's brother Theo to update him on his condition. He paid Van Gogh's rent while he was being cared for, and spent the entire day with him when he was discharged two weeks later. \"Roulin… has a silent gravity and a tenderness for me as an old soldier might have for a young one,\" Van Gogh wrote to Theo the following April, describing Roulin as \"such a good soul and so wise and so full of feeling\".\n\nCourtesy Museum of Fine Arts, Boston Van Gogh's Postman Joseph Roulin, 1888 – Roulin was a close friend and loyal ally of the artist (Credit: Courtesy Museum of Fine Arts, Boston)\n\nPaying homage to this touching relationship is the exhibition Van Gogh: The Roulin Family Portraits, opening at the MFA Boston, USA, on 30 March, before moving on to its co-organiser, the Van Gogh Museum, Amsterdam, in October. This is the first exhibition devoted to portraits of all five members of the Roulin family. It features more than 20 paintings by Van Gogh, alongside works by important influences on the Dutch artist, including 17th-Century Dutch masters Rembrandt and Frans Hals, and the French artist Paul Gauguin, who lived for two months with Van Gogh in Arles.\n\nRoulin wasn't just a model for Van Gogh – this was someone with whom he developed a very deep bond of friendship – Katie Hanson\n\n\"So much of what I was hoping for with this exhibition is a human story,\" co-curator Katie Hanson (MFA Boston) tells the BBC. \"The exhibition really highlights that Roulin isn't just a model for him – this was someone with whom he developed a very deep bond of friendship.\" Van Gogh's tumultuous relationship with Gauguin, and the fallout between them that most likely precipitated the ear incident, has tended to overshadow his narrative, but Roulin offered something more constant and uncomplicated. We see this in the portraits – the open honesty with which he returns Van Gogh's stare, and the mutual respect and affection that radiate from the canvas.\n\nA new life in Arles\n\nVan Gogh moved from Paris to Arles in February 1888, believing the brighter light and intense colours would better his art, and that southerners were \"more artistic\" in appearance, and ideal subjects to paint. Hanson emphasises Van Gogh's \"openness to possibility\" at this time, and his feeling, still relatable today, of being a new face in town. \"We don't have to hit on our life's work on our first try; we might also be seeking and searching for our next direction, our next place,\" she says. And it's in this spirit that Van Gogh, a newcomer with \"a big heart\", welcomed new connections.\n\nCourtesy Museum of Fine Arts, Boston A pen, ink and chalk portrait of Roulin, 1888, is among the exhibits in the show Van Gogh: The Roulin Family Portraits (Credit: Courtesy Museum of Fine Arts, Boston)\n\nBefore moving into the yellow house next door, now known so well inside and out, Van Gogh rented a room above the Café de la Gare. The bar was frequented by Joseph Roulin, who lived on the same street and worked at the nearby railway station supervising the loading and unloading of post. Feeling that his strength lay in portrait painting, but struggling to find people to pose for him, Van Gogh was delighted when the characterful postman, who drank a sizeable portion of his earnings at the café, agreed to pose for him, asking only to be paid in food and drink.\n\nBetween August 1888 and April 1889, Van Gogh made six portraits of Roulin, symbols of companionship and hope that contrast with the motifs of loneliness, despair and impending doom seen in some of his other works. In each, Roulin is dressed in his blue postal worker's uniform, embellished with gold buttons and braid, the word \"postes\" proudly displayed on his cap. Roulin's stubby nose and ruddy complexion, flushed with years of drinking, made him a fascinating muse for the painter, who described him as \"a more interesting man than many people\".\n\nCourtesy Museum of Fine Arts, Boston Portrait of Joseph Roulin, 1889 – Van Gogh's paintings of the Roulin family were full of warmth and optimism (Credit: Courtesy Museum of Fine Arts, Boston)\n\nRoulin was just 12 years older than Van Gogh, but he became a guiding light and father figure to the lonely painter – on account of Roulin's generous beard and apparent wisdom, Van Gogh nicknamed him Socrates. Born into a wealthy family, Van Gogh belonged to a very different social class from Roulin, but was taken with his \"strong peasant nature\" and forbearance when times were hard. Roulin was a proud and garrulous republican, and when Van Gogh saw him singing La Marseillaise, he noticed how painterly he was, \"like something out of Delacroix, out of Daumier\". He saw in him the spirit of the working man, describing his voice as possessing \"a distant echo of the clarion of revolutionary France\".\n\nThe friendship soon opened the door to four further sitters: Roulin's wife, Augustine, and their three children. We meet their 17-year-old son Armand, an apprentice blacksmith wearing the traces of his first facial hair, and appearing uneasy with the painter's attention; his younger brother, 11-year-old schoolboy Camille, described in the exhibition catalogue as \"squirming in his chair\"; and Marcelle, the couple's chubby-cheeked baby, who, Roulin writes, \"makes the whole house happy\". Each painting represents a different stage of life, and each sitter was gifted their portrait. In total, Van Gogh created 26 portraits of the Roulins, a significant output for one family, rarely seen in art history.\n\nCourtesy Museum of Fine Arts, Boston Roulin's wife is portrayed in Lullaby: Madame Augustine Rocking a Cradle (La Berceuse) 1889 (Credit: Courtesy Museum of Fine Arts, Boston)\n\nVan Gogh had once hoped to be a father and husband himself, and his relationship with the Roulin family let him experience some of that joy. In a letter to Theo, he described Roulin playing with baby Marcelle: \"It was touching to see him with his children on the last day, above all with the very little one when he made her laugh and bounce on his knees and sang for her.\" Outside these walls, Van Gogh often experienced hostility from the locals, who described him as \"the redheaded madman\", and even petitioned for his confinement. By contrast, the Roulins accepted his mental illness, and their home offered a place of safety and understanding.\n\nThe relationship, however, was far from one-sided. This educated visitor with his unusual Dutch accent was unlike anyone Roulin had ever met, and offered \"a different kind of interaction\", explains Hanson. \"He's new in town, new to Roulin's stories and he's going to have new stories to tell.\" Roulin enjoys offering advice – on furnishing the yellow house for example – and when, in the summer of 1888, Madame Roulin returned to her home town to deliver Marcelle, Roulin, left alone, found Van Gogh welcome company.\n\nVan Gogh Museum, Amsterdam/Courtesy Museum of Fine Arts, Boston The Baby Marcelle Roulin and Armand Roulin, both 1888 – Van Gogh created 26 portraits of the family (Credit: Van Gogh Museum, Amsterdam/Courtesy Museum of Fine Arts, Boston)\n\nRoulin also got the rare opportunity to have portraits painted for free, and when, the following year, he was away for work in Marseille, it comforted him that baby Marcelle could still see his portrait hanging above her cradle. His fondness for Van Gogh shines through their correspondence. \"Continue to take good care of yourself, follow the advice of your good Doctor and you will see your complete recovery to the satisfaction of your relatives and your friends,\" he wrote to him from Marseille, signing off: \"Marcelle sends you a big kiss.\"\n\nVan Gogh lived a further 19 months, producing a staggering 70 paintings in his last 70 days, and leaving one of art history's most treasured legacies\n\nVan Gogh's portraits placed him in the heart of the family home. In his five versions of La Berceuse, meaning both \"lullaby\" and \"the woman who rocks the cradle\", Mme Roulin held a string device, fashioned by Van Gogh, that rocked the baby's cradle beyond the canvas, permitting the pair the peace to complete the artwork. The joyful background colours – green, blue, yellow or red – vary from one family member to another. Exuberant floral backdrops, reserved for the parents, come later, conveying happiness and affection – a blooming that took place since the earlier, plainer portraits.\n\nArt history has also greatly benefitted from the freedom this relationship granted Van Gogh to experiment with portraiture, and to develop his own style with its delineated shapes, bold, glowing colours, and thick wavy strokes that make the forms vibrate with life. In the security of this friendship, he overturned the conventions of portrait painting, prioritising an emotional response to his subject, resolving \"not to render what I have before my eyes\" but to \"express myself forcefully\", and to paint Roulin, he told Theo, \"as I feel him\".\n\nCredit: Van Gogh Museum, Amsterdam/ Courtesy Museum of Fine Arts, Boston A photograph of Joseph Roulin in 1902, 12 years after the death of his friend Vincent van Gogh (Credit: Credit: Van Gogh Museum, Amsterdam/ Courtesy Museum of Fine Arts, Boston)\n\nHad Van Gogh not felt Roulin's unwavering support, he may not have survived the series of devastating breakdowns that began in December 1888 when he took a razor to his ear. With the care of those close to him, he lived a further 19 months, producing a staggering 70 paintings in his last 70 days, and leaving one of art history's most treasured legacies.\n\nLike the intimate portraits he created in Arles, the exhibition courses with optimism. \"I hope being with these works of art and exploring his creative process – and his ways of creating connection – will be a heartwarming story,\" Hanson says. Far from \"shying away from the sadness\" of this period of Van Gogh's life, she says, the exhibition bears witness to the power of supportive relationships and \"the reality that sadness and hope can coexist\".\n\nVan Gogh: The Roulin Family Portraits is at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston from 30 March to 7 September 2025, and at the Van Gogh Museum, Amsterdam from 3 October 2025 to 11 January 2026.\n\n--\n\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.",

        "content": "'Food is a language everyone understands': Yotam Ottolenghi on how cuisine connects people\n\n6 days ago Share Save Christopher Luu Share Save\n\nNatassja Ebert (Credit: Natassja Ebert)\n\nThe famed chef and author tells the BBC's Katty Kay that it was finding academia too “esoteric” that led him to seek out a simpler path: to help the world simplify its food.\n\nYotam Ottolenghi's singular style of cooking has been embraced across the globe. Focusing on simple ingredients and treating food as a way to bring friends and family together, he's become a renowned chef, a best-selling author and a touchstone for home cooks looking to incorporate global flavours into their everyday rotations.\n\nThe chef, father and former philosophy student explains to BBC special correspondent Katty Kay, in her interview series Influential, that having parents who cooked helped shape his path. However, he says that it was the sense of belonging that came with cooking – not family expectations – that truly drew him in.\n\n\"There was a quiet expectation that I would probably become an academic,\" he says. \"I don't remember having a conversation, which must have happened. 'What do you want to be when you grow up?' I don't remember that.\"\n\nHis parents were both in education – his father, Michael, was a chemistry professor at Jerusalem's Hebrew University – but Ottolenghi notes that his folks both had experience in the kitchen.\n\nNatassja Ebert Ottolenghi became a household name after the opening of his restaurant in Notting Hill (Credit: Natassja Ebert)\n\n\"Food was very important. We had good ingredients, good cooking. Both my parents were good cooks,\" he says. \"My father used to cook a lot because he worked more flexible hours. My mother was a head teacher at school [...] She also cooked but he cooked even more.\"\n\nThe 56-year-old chef – who has authored 11 cookbooks – tells Kay that rather than having an epiphany about his future path, he saw the kitchen as a space for curiosity and play, something that he's now passed onto his own children.\n\n\"My kids – I've got a 9 year old [and an] 11 year old – they play, you know?\" he says. \"They go in the kitchen and they make an omelette and this and that. I call it cooking as play. So, I used to do a bit of that but I wasn't obsessive about cooking.\"\n\nFood should be healing rather than routine, says Ottolenghi\n\nBefore making his name in the culinary world, Ottolenghi dabbled in philosophy but found the subject matter too isolating and \"esoteric\".\n\n\"The conversation was being held amongst a group of, like, four people, you know like groundbreaking stuff but actually nobody was participating,\" he said of his time in university, where he tackled topics like the meaning of photography and what images mean to their viewers. Instead of that very specialised field, he turned his focus to something simpler, literally.\n\nNatassja Ebert Ottolenghi says his approach to cooking has changed as he's seen the public's shifting attitudes to food (Credit: Natassja Ebert)\n\nIn 2018, following the success of his eponymous Notting Hill café and shop, Ottolenghi published his fifth cookbook, Simple, distilling all the techniques and preparations that he'd become known for into something accessible and approachable.\n\n\"Food is a language that everybody understands,\" he says. What surprised him about that, however, was that the books started to eclipse the food. \"Rather than just being a book to sell and share, the publishing arm of Ottolenghi became the dog wagging the tail in this respect. The books became the main thing, almost.\"\n\nWhere to find Influential with Katty Kay Watch Influential with Katty Kay live on Fridays at 21:30 ET on the BBC News channel or stream the full episode on YouTube.\n\nThe books were a way for fans of the restaurant and of Ottolenghi's pared-down, flavour-forward recipes to access that world at home. He tells Kay that he hopes to be part of a movement to take cooking from being a chore into something healing and restorative.\n\n\"Home-style cooking and family-style serving are way more popular now than they used to be. I really put that down to, first of all, cost of living, but also Covid. In that moment, we understood that actually food should be healing rather than just one of all other activities that we do all day long that push us.\"\n\nFans soon saw the changes in his books, shifting from the exact recipes served at his restaurants to something less haute cuisine and more streamlined, boasting titles like Simple, Plenty and his latest, Comfort.\n\n\"I think since Simple, I have been spending more of my time thinking, 'What does it actually mean to cook this recipe?' You know, 'When do I cook – when does one cook it? How much effort goes into it?'\" he says. \"Funnily, from a grand old age talking to younger chefs, I say to them, 'Is someone actually going to cook this?' I want people to cook my food.\"\n\nThat pared-down approach has even turned \"Ottolenghi\" into an adjective – used to describe food that offers high impact with few ingredients and straightforward techniques. He remains humble, brushing off the distinction and putting the focus back on his desire to make cooking comforting.\n\n\"Food really is one of those activities that shouldn't induce anxiety. It's as simple as that,\" he says.\n\n--\n\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.",

        "content": "Donald Trump has offered varying justifications for tariffs, depending on his audience and what's expedient at any moment. When the president chooses to mount an economic case for levies, it usually comes with the contention that trading partners are ripping off Americans. Factories need to come home — to the extent they ever left — and duties will do the trick. He professes to not care much about the crockery broken in the process, and has dubbed Wednesday “Liberation Day” in honor of his protectionist broadsides. Yet the global system he sees as a prison was anything but.\n\nBarely mentioned is that for decades, American companies were buoyed by making products abroad. The practice brought benefits for the domestic economy, helped put a lid on inflation, and delivered influence for Washington. US partners prospered and, as their living standards climbed, they in turn bought goods and services from firms headquartered stateside. It would be too easy to call this arrangement a win-win; unions complained about outsourcing and wealth wasn’t always spread evenly in host nations. There was, however, a circle of self-interest. It worked for a long time, and still can, if Trump's team recognizes the pluses that accrued and not just the drawbacks.",

That means they do it to us, and we do it to them,\" Mr. Trump said in his Wednesday remarks.\n\nMr. Trump also said such levies will boost domestic manufacturing and level the playing field with other countries that impose higher tariffs on U.S. imports than the U.S. charges for their products. Still, economists are forecasting that the tariffs will cause inflation to reignite, while also prompting some trade partners to retaliate with higher tariffs on American imports to their nations.\n\nIf the tariffs are maintained by the Trump administration and if other nations impose retaliatory tariffs, both the U.S. and other countries \"will suffer serious recessions,\" said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics, in an email to CBS MoneyWatch.\n\nFull list of Trump's reciprocal tariffs by country\n\nWhen will these tariffs go into effect?\n\nThe reciprocal rates will become effective at 12:01 a.m. on April 9. That's in addition to a baseline 10% tariff which goes into effect at 12:01 a.m. on April 5.\n\nHow did the Trump administration decide what tariffs to charge which countries?\n\nMr. Trump said his administration determined the tariff rate for each country based on the monetary levies those nations charge on U.S. imports, as well as non-monetary trade barriers like regulations that make it tougher for American products to enter those markets.\n\nThe president added that the reciprocal tariffs are still only half the rates charged by those nations on U.S. products, characterizing his new levies as \"kind.\"",

        "source": "https://www.cbsnews.com/",
        "content": "President Trump announced two new types of tariffs on April 2, or what he's calling \"Liberation Day,\" aimed at erasing trade deficits between the U.S. and its trading partners.\n\nThe two new tariffs are:\n\nA 10% universal import duty on all goods brought into the U.S.\n\nSo-called reciprocal tariffs\n\nMr. Trump, who announced the tariffs in the White House's Rose Garden on Wednesday afternoon, said his plans reflect \"one of the most important days in American history; it's our declaration of economic independence.\" Even so, economists say the tariffs will boost prices on many products purchased by American consumers, at a time when inflation still remains elevated.\n\nAn overview of Mr. Trump's new \"Liberation Day\" tariffs\n\nThe first tariff will be a 10% across-the-board tax applied to all imports to the U.S.\n\nThe second tariff, reciprocal tariffs, will be applied to imports from 60 countries and are aimed at equalizing the trade imbalances between the U.S. and those nations. Mr. Trump said that reciprocal tariffs \"means they do it to us, and we do it to them.\"\n\nHe added, \"It can't get any simpler than that.\"\n\nOne example provided by Mr. Trump is that the U.S. charges a 2.5% tariff on automobile imports, while adding that the European Union charges a 10% tariff on American car exports to EU nations.\n\n\"Such horrendous imbalances have devastated our industrial base,\" he added.\n\nWhat is a reciprocal tariff?\n\nAt the moment, the U.S. and its trading partners charge each other different levies on the same products. Germany, for instance, puts higher tariffs on vehicles made in the U.S. than what Washington, D.C., charges on German vehicle imports.\n\nTruly reciprocal tariffs would apply the same tax on U.S. imports that other countries place on American exports on a product-by-product basis. By charging countries only 50% of what they charge U.S. products, Mr. Trump said he is imposing \"kind reciprocal\" tariffs.\n\nMr. Trump said that the reciprocal tariffs will also include calculations to cover non-monetary trade barriers, such as when nations devalue their currencies to help boost demand for their products from other nations.\n\nWhen do the tariffs go into effect?\n\nThe baseline 10% tariff will go into effect at 12:01 a.m. on April 5, while the reciprocal rates will become effective at 12:01 a.m. on April 9.\n\nWhy is Trump imposing these new tariffs?\n\nDuring his announcement, Mr. Trump said the goal was to revitalize the industrial and manufacturing base of the U.S., promising that doing so will \"make America wealthy again.\"\n\nMr. Trump said the tariffs will help convince foreign businesses to relocate their factories to the U.S. The president also promised that the tariffs would lead to lower prices for Americans, although most economists are projecting that Mr. Trump's tariffs are likely to boost inflation and lead to higher costs for the typical U.S. household.\n\nFor instance, the core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index — an inflation measure closely tracked by the Federal Reserve — could rise 0.5 percentage points to 3.5% by year end, according to a March 30 Goldman Sachs report. The core PCE rose 2.8% in February on an annual basis, reflecting a slight increase from the prior month.\n\nThat estimate is based on Mr. Trump's previously announced tariffs, including his 25% import duty on auto imports, as well as Goldman's expectation for reciprocal tariffs that would average about 15%.",

        "source": "https://www.cbsnews.com/",
        "content": "President Trump is considering announcing the creation of what he calls the \"External Revenue Service\" on Wednesday as the White House launches his new trade agenda and collects tariff revenues from around the globe, according to sources familiar with the planning.\n\nMr. Trump is also aiming to again alter Washington's trade relationship with Beijing, and will likely charge tariffs on low-value merchandise shipped from China to individual U.S. consumers.\n\nDetails of Mr. Trump's final decision were unclear as of Wednesday afternoon.\n\nMr. Trump has considered attaching a fee of $25 on low-value packages from China, one of the sources told CBS News. White House spokespeople didn't answer requests for comment. It wasn't clear what levy the president chose.\n\nCurrently, a U.S. loophole allows duty-free shipments of Chinese goods worth less than $800.\n\nIt has enabled Chinese e-commerce companies such as Shein and Temu to skirt import fees. The practice has undercut other retailers, including American firms, that must pay those fees when buying product in bulk. The so-called de minimis exemption is limited to one shipment per person per day.\n\nThe changes, if adopted, would put a pinch on the online shopping habits of American consumers seeking clothing, household products and other goods from China at ultra low prices.\n\nThe president is scheduled to hold an event in the Rose Garden at 4 p.m. to herald his tariffs strategy.\n\nMr. Trump has previously described his idea for the External Revenue Service – meant to be a play on the unpopular domestic tax collection agency – as an arm of government \"to collect tariffs, duties, and all revenue that come from foreign sources.\"\n\nIn February, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said Trump's goal was \"very simple.\" It was to \"abolish the Internal Revenue Service and let all the outsiders pay,\" he said on \"Jesse Watters Primetime\" on Fox News.\n\nThe practicalities of fully replacing the income tax with tariff revenue, a drastic economic overhaul, would be complex. Abolishing the IRS would require an act of Congress.\n\nCollecting tariffs on goods at ports of entry is currently the responsibility of U.S. Customs and Border Protection. Whether the new External Revenue Service would fully assume those duties is unclear, and its establishment could undercut Mr. Trump's promise of shrinking the federal bureaucracy.\n\nThe staggering volume of packages from direct-to-consumer Chinese retailers shipped under the de minimis exemption have raised concerns about fentanyl, and other illicit drugs, and counterfeit goods slipping past U.S. screeners.\n\nThe Trump administration targeted cheap products from Chinese retailers a couple months ago, but reversed course amid problems and confusion.\n\nTariffs on the merchandise shipments that took effect on Feb. 4 were partially rolled back on Feb. 7 after packages piled up at ports of entry. The U.S. Postal Service temporarily paused all small-value deliveries from China and Taiwan as it tried to figure out how to collect the duties.\n\nThe White House has invited steel and autoworkers to Wednesday's tariffs announcement, as well as most of Mr. Trump's cabinet, officials told CBS News. Several members of Congress were also on the guest list, including House Speaker Mike Johnson, House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, Senate Majority Leader John Thune, Sens. Bill Hagerty and Bernie Moreno.\n\nFin Gómez and Richard Escobedo contributed reporting.",

        "source": "https://www.cbsnews.com/",
        "content": "President Trump has argued that some of the tariffs he's imposing this week could help the government raise over $1 trillion in the next year or so, helping to reduce the national debt and even potentially offset some income taxes.\n\nBut economists are skeptical that these tariffs can bring in as much as Mr. Trump claims, as consumers will likely reduce their spending on foreign goods when prices go up.\n\nTariffs are often charged as a percentage of the price that importers pay foreign sellers. They aren't paid by foreign nations, but by U.S. companies who often pass the cost to American consumers by raising prices.\n\n\"You're going to see billions of dollars, even trillions of dollars coming into our country very soon in the form of tariffs,\" the president said last week.\n\nWhile economic analyses indicate Mr. Trump's tariffs could meaningfully increase annual tariff revenue, the president's trillion-dollar estimates are significantly higher than those provided by think tanks and even some of his own officials.\n\nHow much Trump's new auto tariffs could generate\n\nIn a recent news conference, White House staff secretary Will Sharf estimated that Mr. Trump's 25% tariff on vehicles and auto parts imported into the U.S. could raise \"roughly $100 billion in new revenue.\" At the same news conference, Mr. Trump claimed moments later \"anywhere from $600 billion to $1 trillion will be taken in over the relatively short-term period, meaning a year from now.\"\n\nThe White House did not respond to a request to clarify the source of the discrepancy.\n\nThe Yale Budget Lab, a nonpartisan think tank, has estimated that the auto tariffs could raise roughly $600 billion to $650 billion over a period of 10 years — not in a single year, as Mr. Trump suggested.\n\n\"On an annual basis on average that's $60 to 65 billion. We're not even close to trillions,\" said Ernie Tedeschi, director of economics at the Yale Budget Lab.\n\nThe Yale Budget Lab also found that motor vehicle prices could rise by 13.5% on average for Americans, or an additional cost of $6,400 for an average new car.\n\nHow much Trump's tariffs on Canada, Mexico, and China could generate\n\nThe same researchers found Mr. Trump's 25% tariff on goods from Canada and Mexico, which are slated to go into effect this week, along with the additional 20% tax on Chinese imports that the president has already put in place, could generate roughly $150 billion annually, or up to $1.5 trillion over 10 years. They also found the average household could lose $1,600 to $2,000 each year in inflation-adjusted disposable income as a result of higher prices.\n\nMeanwhile, Goldman Sachs previously made higher estimates that Trump's increased tariffs on these countries could generate roughly $300 billion in new income per year.\n\nEither would be a meaningful increase over the $88 billion in customs duties collected at ports of entry in 2024.\n\nHowever, economists argue there's a ceiling to tariff revenue that remains below $1 trillion per year.\n\nThe U.S. imported about $3.3 trillion in foreign goods last year, according to the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis. The Peterson Institute of International Economics estimated that even if Mr. Trump were to apply a 50% tariff to foreign imports from every country — which exceeds his stated plans — it would generate at most about $780 billion annually.\n\n\"If you make something 50% more expensive, you don't expect people to buy the same amount,\" said Kimberly Clausing, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute.\n\nCould tariff revenue replace income taxes?\n\nMr. Trump has repeatedly floated the idea of using his tariff agenda to offset or even replace income taxes.\n\n\"Under the American first economic model, as tariffs on other countries go up, taxes on American workers and businesses will come down,\" Trump said in a speech to the House GOP in January.\n\nIncome taxes generate over $2 trillion per year, according to the Department of the Treasury. Even if a president imposed 50% tariffs on all imports, the income generated would represent less than 40% of what income taxes bring in, according to the Peterson Institute.\n\n\"The problem is it can't raise anywhere near the amount of revenue you'd need to scuttle the income tax. And that's the really, I think, ironclad point,\" said Scott Lincicome, a vice president of general economics and trade at the Cato Institute, which is a libertarian think tank.\n\nHistorians on U.S. trade note that tariffs have not been viewed as a primary way to raise revenue since income taxes were introduced in 1913.\n\nIn 2024, tariff collections on imports represented just 1.7% of the more than $4.9 trillion in total federal revenue. And according to the Congressional Research Service, tariffs have not accounted for much more than 2% of federal revenue in the last 70 years.\n\ncontributed to this report.",

        "source": "https://www.cbsnews.com/",
        "content": "CBS News is tracking the already sharply rising cost of products most impacted by tariffs imposed and new ones announced by President Trump on April 2, from the cost of common grocery items to the the purchase and operation of cars and trucks.\n\nWe will continue updating the weekly prices of groceries and the monthly costs of new vehicles, used vehicles, parts, repairs, insurance premiums and construction and manufacturing raw materials.\n\nEconomists and other experts say consumers can expect to see higher prices for imported items targeted by the latest round of tariffs in the coming weeks and months.\n\nGroceries\n\n\n\nPerhaps the most impacted day-to-day purchases for American families will be at the grocery store, where a large share of our most commonly purchased fruits and vegetables are imported from Mexico, Canada, China and other countries facing tariffs. Experts suggest the cost of those tariffs will be passed on to consumers in the grocery checkout lane.\n\nWe examined the prices for fruits, vegetables and juices that are primarily imported from other countries, according to USDA data. The average prices are drawn from weekly surveys that the Agriculture Department conducts at hundreds of stores across the country. We've tracked the weekly price data from 2020 through last week.\n\nCars and trucks\n\nThe cost of owning and operating a car or truck in the United States is a major focus ahead of the threatened White House tariffs on vehicles manufactured in other countries — a change experts predict will add thousands more to the cost of ownership, parts, repairs and insurance.\n\nIn the wake of the COVID pandemic, supply-chain interruptions and the inflation that followed, the price of buying new and used cars rose sharply. So did the cost of parts, repairs and insurance.\n\nThe charts show the price as an index — the percentage above a baseline. For new and used vehicles, we're using an example of a small SUV to translate the percentages into dollars to explain the recent years' change.\n\nUsed car prices spiked after the COVID pandemic because major supply chain disruptions and a global computer chip shortage severely slowed down new vehicle production. In some cases, late-model used vehicle prices soared to nearly the same as new models of the same or similar vehicles.\n\nSome of the same phenomenon drove up the price of auto parts, and consequently, consumers' bills at repair shops.\n\nIn addition to the rising cost of repairs, labor shortages, driving habits and increasing crash trends have driven up the cost of automobile insurance premiums, aggravating the total cost of owning and operating personal cars and trucks.\n\nConstruction and manufacturing supplies\n\nBaked into the cost of everything from homebuilding to the manufacture of durable goods like appliances are the cost of core supplies like steel and aluminum, which are also targeted by the administration's tariffs.",

Bigger majorities feel this way about trains, buses and driving, boosted in part by the views of \"never\" flyers who rate these modes of transportation as safe in higher numbers than they do flying.\n\nMost Americans rate the overall safety record of commercial air travel positively — as either excellent or good. Today's ratings are largely on par with those in 2014, when CBS News last asked about this, weeks after the disappearance of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370.\n\nThe CBS News poll has often asked about people's views of flying after air travel incidents. We have seen ratings of commercial airline safety sometimes dip after such instances, but they have remained majority positive.\n\nThis CBS News/YouGov survey was conducted with a nationally representative sample of 2,351 U.S. adults interviewed between March 24-26, 2025. The sample was weighted to be representative of adults nationwide according to gender, age, race, and education, based on the U.S. Census American Community Survey and Current Population Survey, as well as 2024 presidential vote.

        "source": "https://www.cbsnews.com/",
        "content": "After more than 15 months in captivity, and while dealing with burying the bodies of his wife and two young children, freed Israeli Yarden Bibas made a public appeal.\n\nHe implored Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to end the fighting in Gaza, determined to see the return of the other hostages taken on Oct. 7, 2023. Despite his heartfelt plea, the ceasefire with Hamas ended this month, with Israel resuming bombing in Gaza. Every bomb that falls jeopardizes the hostages still held in captivity, Bibas said. He spent most of his time in captivity in Gaza's tunnels and lived through bombings.\n\n\"You don't know when it's gonna happen. And when it happens, you're afraid for your life,\" he said. \"The whole earth would move like an earthquake, but underground.\"\n\nYarden Bibas\n\nBibas, his wife Shiri and their two, red-headed sons — 4-year-old Ariel and 9-month-old Kfir — were among those taken hostage during the Oct. 7 Hamas-terrorist attack on Israel, which sparked the war. In all, some 1,200 civilians and soldiers were killed that day and 251 people were abducted.\n\nIn the months since, an estimated 50,000 Gazans have been killed, according to the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between civilians and militant combatants. Most of those are women and children.\n\nYarden Bibas 60 Minutes\n\nBibas lived through much of the deadly bombing in Gaza before his release during a January ceasefire. During his time in captivity, he was forced to sit on camera after he was told by Hamas that his wife and sons were killed by an Israeli air raid. Israeli officials have since said that forensic evidence shows Bibas' children were killed by their captors.\n\n\"They were all murdered in cold blood, bare hands,\" Bibas said. \"They [Hamas] used to tell me 'Oh, doesn't matter. You'll get a new wife. Get new kids. Better wife. Better kids.'\"\n\nShortly after Bibas was freed in January, Hamas released the bodies of his wife and children as part of a ceasefire deal.\n\nBibas started advocating for the hostages still in Gaza almost immediately following his own release. He wrote a letter to Netanyahu pleading to stop the fighting. Bibas does not believe continued fighting will encourage Hamas to release the hostages.\n\nNow Bibas is hoping to reach the ears of President Trump.\n\n\"I know he can help,\" Bibas said. \"I'm here because of Trump. I'm here only because of him. I think he's the only one who can stop this war again.\"\n\nBibas said the president should convince Netanyahu and Hamas to agree to another ceasefire.\n\nHe worries about the safety of the hostages still in Gaza, including his best friend, David Cunio, and Cunio's brother, Ariel. Cunio was kidnapped with his wife Sharon and their kids, who were released during the first ceasefire in November 2023. Cunio and his brother are still being held hostage and are presumed to be alive.\n\n\"Probably the hardest thing: I have to move [on] with my life, and David is not with me,\" Bibas said. \"I lost my wife and kids. Sharon must not lose her husband.\"\n\nKeith and Aviva Siegel\n\nBibas is not the only freed hostage hoping for another ceasefire. He's joined by Keith Siegel, an Israeli-American who was also released in January. Siegel's wife, Aviva, was also kidnapped by Hamas and later freed.\n\nKeith Siegel 60 Minutes\n\nThe Siegels lived in Kibbutz Kfar Aza, near the border with Gaza, and were taken from their home. They were driven into Gaza and taken down into a tunnel.\n\n\"We were gasping for our breath,\" Keith Siegel said.\n\nAviva was with her husband for 51 days, until she was released during a brief ceasefire in 2023. They were held with several women and children, and said there was constant abuse.\n\n\"I witnessed a young woman who was being tortured by the terrorists. I mean literal, you know, torture, not just in the figurative sense,\" Keith Siegel said.\n\nHe said female hostages were sexually assaulted, with other captives made to watch.\n\nSiegel said conditions worsened for him after his wife was released and that early ceasefire collapsed.\n\n\"The terrorists became very mean, and very cruel, and violent,\" he said.\n\nThe Israeli-American said he was beaten and starved. His captors would eat in front of him. He said once a month, he would get half a bucket of cold water to clean himself.\n\nHis spirit, he said, was broken.\n\n\"I felt that I was completely dependent on the terrorists, that my life relied on them, whether they were gonna give me food, bring me water, protect me from the mobs that would lynch me,\" he said. \"I was left alone several times and I was very, very scared that maybe they won't come back and I'll be left there. And what do I do then?\"\n\nWith the couple now back home, Aviva Siegel worries over two neighbors — 27-year-old twins Gali ans Zivi Berman — still languishing in captivity in Gaza.\n\n\"There needs to be a deal that will bring them back, and finish with this whole thing,\" she said.\n\nIsraelis still in captivity\n\nAn estimated 24 hostages are still believed to be alive in Gaza, including best friends Guy Gilboa-Dalal and Evyatar David. Hamas took them from the Nova Music Festival.\n\nRecently released hostage Tal Shoham, 40, spent 471 days with them in captivity. Shoham recently met with the parents of Guy Gilboa-Dalal and Evyatar David to tell them about their sons.\n\nReleased hostage Tal Shoham, right, recently met with the parents of Guy Gilboa-Dalal and Evyatar David to tell them about their sons, who are still being held captive in Gaza. 60 Minutes\n\n\"It's important for us to know exactly what's going on with our children,\" parent Ilan Dalal said.\n\nShoham didn't hold back when he spoke with Gilboa-Dalal's parents.\n\n\"One moment he's, like, partying in the Nova, the second moment he's in the worst place in the world,\" Shoham told them of their son. \"It took him, I think, five or six days just to stop crying, to start to realize that this is the reality now.\"\n\nShoham said they were mostly confined to a narrow tunnel, where they were beaten daily and made to share minute amounts of pita bread, rice and water.\n\n\"Sometimes the water tastes like blood, sometimes like iron. Sometimes it was so salty that you could not drink it, but you don't have anything else,\" Shoham said. \"You don't need too much to stay alive.\"\n\nBut they were resourceful, coming up with odd ways to win favors. For instance, they discovered one of the guards liked back rubs.\n\n\"The exchange was that he will get a massage every day and he will bring us some more food. And different food,\" Shoham said.\n\nHamas also brought Guy Gilboa-Dalal and Evyatar David in a van to watch fellow hostages be released. Hamas released a video of them begging for their freedom.\n\n\"And then they moved them back to the tunnels. So this can be devastating to them,\" Ilan Dalal said.\n\nGalia David, mother of hostage Evyatar David, said she wants everyone to hear about what's happened to the hostages.\n\n\"Maybe someone will hear it and he will save our sons. I don't know,\" she said.",

        "source": "https://www.cbsnews.com/",
        "content": "Senior Food and Drug Administration leaders are planning for cutbacks to the number of routine food and drug inspections conducted by the agency, multiple officials say, due to steep layoffs this week in support staff.\n\nAround 170 workers were cut from the FDA's Office of Inspections and Investigations, according to two federal health officials who were not authorized to speak publicly.\n\nThe Department of Health and Human Services has said layoffs ordered by Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., with some 10,000 workers let go from the department, would not directly cut FDA's inspections staff. But in meetings among federal health officials, the agency's remaining leaders have grappled with how to deal with major delays and disruptions caused by the loss of administrative and management staff who had supported the agency's inspectors, according to two FDA officials.\n\n\"These administrative functions are being streamlined as part of HHS' transformation initiative to make the agency more efficient and responsive. FDA inspectors were not impacted and this critical work will continue,\" an HHS spokesperson said in a statement.\n\nThe inspections and investigations office will now need to work with FDA's drug, device and food centers to reprioritize their workload for the rest of the year, one official said. That will mean trimming routine \"surveillance inspections\" for more urgent tasks, the official said, like inspections of firms where the agency has been alerted to a safety risk or follow-up visits to ensure that drugmakers or food producers have fixed previous violations.\n\nOne of the biggest immediate impacts on the agency's inspectors stems from the elimination of the office's travel operations division, one official said. The team's work ranged from booking flights to coordinating with the State Department to secure translators needed for inspections of drugmakers and food producers abroad.\n\n\"As of yesterday, all front-line investigators will now be spending significant time processing their own travel and related administrative requirements, rather than spending that time in firms ensuring the American consumer is protected,\" one FDA official told CBS News.\n\nA pilot program of unannounced foreign inspections has also been paused due to the cuts, an official said, because of the loss of staff that had been tasked with quickly securing translators around the world.\n\nThe FDA has long struggled to meet its own inspection goals, which was worsened by a backlog created during the COVID-19 pandemic. According to a January report by the Government Accountability Office, the FDA was facing a swelling list of food safety inspections that were on track to miss deadlines mandated by Congress, as they struggled to hire and retain qualified inspectors.\n\nWhile current inspections are still taking place, multiple FDA officials said that cuts are likely to worsen delays caused by other challenges introduced by the Trump administration's efforts to cut spending in recent months.\n\nAs one example, multiple officials said that field operations have been hampered by a new government-wide $1 limit on spending cards. Any spending above that limit requires a cumbersome approval process.\n\nInspectors had already been asked to plan their inspections a month in advance due to the delays caused by the spending limit, one official said.",

        "content": "Tony Bennett's two daughters have filed a new lawsuit against their brother, alleging he illegally enriched himself at their expense against their father's wishes both before and after the legendary singer's death in 2023.\n\nAntonia and Johanna Bennett filed the lawsuit Monday in New York against D'Andrea \"Danny\" Bennett, who was their father's manager and heads their family trust.\n\n\"Since Tony's death, Johanna and Antonia have discovered that Danny exercised complete and unchecked control over Tony and his financial affairs prior to and following his death through multiple fiduciary and other roles of authority that Danny has abused, and continues to abuse, for his own significant financial gain,\" the suit alleges.\n\nFILE - From left, Johanna Bennett, Susan Benedetto, Tony Bennett and Antonia Bennett attend Tony Bennett's 85th birthday gala in New York, Sept. 18, 2011. Charles Sykes / AP\n\nIt says Danny Bennett took advantage of his father's diminished capacity late in life due to Alzheimer's disease to make deals to make millions for himself and his company, including the sale shortly before his death of Tony Bennett's catalog and his name, likeness and image rights to the brand development firm Iconoclast.\n\nThe sisters previously sued their brother in June seeking an accounting of their father's assets, and alleging Danny Bennett had mishandled them. The new suit alleges he has breached his fiduciary duty and seeks to remove him as head of the family trust.\n\n\"This lawsuit is yet another baseless attempt to distort the public and the court's understanding of Tony Bennett's clearly stated wishes,\" a spokesperson for Danny Bennett said in a statement. \"Danny has followed his father's plans with integrity and care, and it is disappointing that those Tony supported throughout his life — and continues to support through his estate — are now challenging Danny's integrity with unsubstantiated and unfounded claims.\"\n\nDanny Bennett was his father's personal and professional manager with power of attorney, was manager of his company Benedetto Arts, and is the trustee of the family trust, the suit says.\n\nDanny Bennett came up with the idea for the late singer to hold two big concerts at the Radio City Music Hall in New York City with Lady Gaga, he told CBS News in 2022. They were his final performances.\n\n\"The pandemic was a big ... it was a big thing for me. Like, ending his career on that note,\" Danny Bennett told \"60 Minutes.\" \"(It) couldn't end that way. After all that he did.\"\n\nThe new lawsuit accuses Danny Bennett of benefiting from \"self-interested and conflicted transactions, excessive and unearned commissions,\" and \"substantial loans and gifts to himself and his children\" that have diminished assets that Tony Bennett's will calls for his four children to split equally.\n\nAnother brother, Daegal \"Dae\" Bennett, and Tony's widow, Susan Bennett, were also named as defendants in the lawsuit. Susan and Tony had been together for more than 30 years. She was also his full-time caregiver.\n\nThe first lawsuit noted Daegal and Susan were named solely because of their capacity as a beneficiary of the Family Trust \"in anticipation that one or more parties, or the Court, may deem her to be a necessary party to this action.\"\n\nThe new suit says the sisters have received a \"single modest distribution\" of $245,000 apiece that is \"nowhere close to what they believe they are entitled to receive.\"\n\nThe sisters also allege their brother has gotten rid of items of great sentimental value to them in a \"malicious and retaliatory manner\" after their attempts to get an accounting through the previous lawsuit.\n\nBennett's piano, which Antonia says was promised to her, was in \"terrible condition\" when they were allowed to see it in a tour of the singer's apartment, where they say they were denied access to much of his property, the lawsuit says.\n\nThe lawsuit seeks damages to be determined at trial.\n\nTony Bennett, a legendary interpreter of classic American songs who created new standards including \"I Left My Heart In San Francisco,\" died in 2023 at age 96. There was no specific cause, but he had been diagnosed with Alzheimer's in 2016.\n\nBennett released more than 70 albums. The last was released with Lady Gaga in 2021 — after his Alzheimer's disease had already progressed. He won 19 Grammy Awards, including two for that album, and a Grammy lifetime achievement award.\n\n\"Tony and Danny's record of unprecedented success speaks for itself,\" the defense statement said, \"and Danny remains committed to honoring and preserving his father's memory and legacy.\"",

        "title": "What are reciprocal tariffs, and why does Trump want to impose them on other countries?",
        "source": "https://www.cbsnews.com/",
        "content": "A core element of the protectionist trade policies President Trump announced on Wednesday — a planned import tax blitz he has referred to as \"Liberation Day\" — are so-called reciprocal tariffs.\n\n\"Reciprocal. That means they do it to us, and we do it to them,\" Mr. Trump said in his Wednesday news conference, touting such levies as a way to boost domestic manufacturing and level the playing field with other countries that impose higher tariffs on U.S. imports than the U.S. charges for their products.\n\nBut some economists say that tit-for-tat tariffs with key trading partners could be hard to structure, while also roiling global commerce and driving up costs for U.S. consumers and businesses. Here's what to know about reciprocal tariffs.\n\nWhat are reciprocal tariffs?\n\nTruly reciprocal tariffs would impose the same tax on U.S. imports that other countries charge on American exports on a product-by-product basis. For example, if a country imposed a 6% levy on American-made shoes, Mr. Trump would tax that nation's footwear at the same rate.\n\nCurrently, the U.S. and its trading partners charge each other different levies on the same products. Germany, for instance, puts higher tariffs on vehicles made in the U.S. than what Washington, D.C., charges for German vehicle imports.\n\n\"Reciprocal means that if a country has higher tariffs than we do on certain products, we would raise it to that level,\" Alex Jacquez, chief of policy and advocacy at Groundwork Collaborative, a left-leaning public policy think tank, told CBS MoneyWatch.\n\nThat would be administratively complex given the tens of thousands of codes that determine the tariff rates on a variety of products.\n\n\"Setting up reciprocal tariffs across every product category with every trade partner would be completely infeasible with our administrative capacity,\" Jacquez said.\n\nOther experts suggest the goal is less about driving companies to shift their production to the U.S. or generating federal revenue than about pressuring other nations to strike trade deals that the Trump administration is comfortable with.\n\nAre reciprocal tariffs the same as country-based tariffs?\n\nRather than impose perfectly reciprocal tariffs, the White House announced country-specific tariff rates calibrated to the their trade imbalance with the U.S.\n\nMr. Trump on Wednesday said his administration will impose reciprocal tariffs at roughly half the rate of duties charged by other nations. The White House used a formula to calculate the sum of all the trade practices it deems unfair from other nations, including currency manipulation, tariffs and other barriers.\n\nFor example, the U.S. will match China's 67% rate with a 34% tariff on Chinese exports to the U.S.\n\n\"They will probably come up with a blended rate that is not reciprocal by product, but is reciprocal by saying their tariffs are 10% higher than ours on average, so we'll be imposing 10% tariff across-the-board on all goods,\" said Jacquez, who formerly worked as an economic policy analyst in the Biden administration.\n\nThat approach could result in the U.S. taxing other nations' products at vastly different rate than they do ours.\n\n\"It will hit a lot of products very differently in a proximate way, because it would be balanced by country but not by import or export,\" Jacquez said. \"That is where complications will arise, and you could see a scenario in which countries retaliate against us.\"\n\nWho are the \"Dirty 15\"?\n\nTrump administration officials have singled out a group of nations they dubbed the \"Dirty 15,\" a reference to the 15% of countries expected to be hit hardest by the new reciprocal tariffs given their trade surplus with the U.S.\n\nThose nations account for \"a huge amount of our trading volume,\" U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told Fox News' Maria Bartiromo on March 18, without naming the trade partners. National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett also told Fox News that the White House is targeting 10 to 15 nations with the biggest trade surplus with the U.S. Like Bessent, he also refrained from naming those nations.\n\nSimon MacAdam, deputy chief global economist with Capital Economics, thinks likely targets include leading U.S. trading partners such as China, the European Union and Vietnam. In 2024, the largest U.S. trade deficits around the globe — meaning countries from which the U.S. imports more than it exports — was with the following nations, according to federal data:\n\nChina ($295.4 billion)\n\nEuropean Union ($235.6 billion)\n\nMexico ($171.8 billion)\n\nVietnam ($123.5 billion)\n\nIreland ($86.7 billion)\n\nGermany ($84.8 billion)\n\nTaiwan ($73.9 billion)\n\nJapan ($68.5 billion)\n\nSouth Korea ($66 billion)\n\nCanada ($63.3 billion)\n\nIndia ($45.7 billion)\n\nThailand ($45.6 billion)\n\nItaly ($44 billion)\n\nSwitzerland ($38.5 billion)\n\nMalaysia ($24.8 billion)\n\nIndonesia ($17.9 billion)\n\nFrance ($16.4 billion)\n\nAustria ($13.1 billion)\n\nSweden ($9.8 billion)\n\nAre reciprocal prices likely to drive up consumer prices?\n\nFor now, it remains unclear what reciprocal tariff rates the U.S. might charge, although UBS analysts note that the levies imposed during Mr. Trump's first term were smaller and mostly targeted China.\n\nMore certain is that reciprocal tariffs would mean added costs for U.S. businesses, experts say, which in turn would likely raise consumer prices as companies look to protect their profit margins.\n\n\"Tariffs are a tax on a business bringing a product into the country. When they receive it at a port of entry, whether it be an airport or seaport, they have to pay the duty to have it admitted into the country,\" Chris Barrett, a professor at Cornell SC Johnson School of Business, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"You've just added a cost on for the business, and those costs get passed on, at least to some degree, to consumers.\"\n\nHow much prices could rise remains unclear. Meanwhile, prices could fall if Mr. Trump later lowers or removes reciprocal tariffs following trade negotiations.\n\nBut when there is no good substitute for a particular good, consumer costs are likely to rise more sharply.\n\n\"The more price insensitive they are, the more likely they are to shoulder the burden of the tax,\" Barrett said.",

        "source": "https://www.cbsnews.com/",
        "content": "As the Trump administration makes major cuts to federal health agencies, including the National Institutes of Health, cancer patients and doctors are worried about stalls in research and medicine that could affect treatments.\n\nThe NIH is the world's leading medical research agency and largest funder of cancer research, providing about $8 billion in cancer science funding annually.\n\nAbout 1,200 jobs are expected to be cut at NIH as part of the layoffs at the Health and Human Services Department, and the administration also has canceled hundreds of NIH grants to scientists around the country. Across HHS, nearly a quarter of staff, or 20,000 people, is expected to be laid off or take early retirement or voluntary separation offers.\n\n\"HHS deals with Americans from birth to death. There is absolutely no way you can lose 25% of the workforce without directly affecting Americans across this country,\" former HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius recently told CBS News, adding this includes \"research and science at NIH, which is the gold standard of the world.\"\n\nAnjee Davis, the CEO of Fight Colorectal Cancer, a patient advocacy group, told CBS News her reaction to the cuts was fear.\n\n\"We're scared that these blanket mandates could erase decades of progress fighting cancer,\" she said. \"This isn't about politics. It's about protecting the progress we've fought so hard to achieve in cancer care and research over the past two decades.\"\n\nNIH is \"how we end up with new drugs and other advancements in medicine,\" Dr. Céline Gounder, CBS News medical contributor and editor-at-large for public health at KFF Health News, recently told \"CBS Mornings.\"\n\nWhile the exact impacts of the cuts remain to be seen, she said, it does raise immediate and long-term concerns, including a slowing of biomedical research and potential delays in drug approvals.\n\nFollowing the Trump administration's executive orders to make cuts to the U.S.'s health research infrastructure, Fight Colorectal Cancer surveyed patients being actively treated for colorectal cancer.\n\nDavis said 75% of respondents said they were worried the moves would delay their care and slow new research; 17% said they were unsure what would happen, but felt anxious about losing access to future treatment; and 9% said they felt progress on cancer research and treatment would continue despite these changes.\n\nDelayed and even lost care is already happening for some, Davis said.\n\n\"We have a member who is being treated for stage IV colorectal cancer. She had just qualified to enter a clinical trial that was going to be her last chance effort to slow the spread of her cancer. ... Her trial was about to start when NIH funding was pulled overnight, and the trial was canceled,\" she said. \"That's just one example. There are countless others.\"\n\nDespite cancer deaths steadily declining in the U.S. since the early 1990s, the disease is still the second leading cause of death in the country, highlighting the importance of continued research.\n\n\"Discoveries are going to be delayed, if they ever happen,\" Dr. Kimryn Rathmell, former director of the National Cancer Institute, told The Associated Press.\n\nGounder added we may also lose our top talent to other countries.\n\n\"We've already seen China and European countries trying to recruit our scientists, because scientists here are concerned about their job opportunities. I just heard of a few from Yale who just left for Toronto,\" Gounder said, adding students may also shy away from the field. \"You have students who are worried about going into research, because they don't know that there will be jobs.\"\n\nEven with a lot still in the air, Gounder called the cuts \"very concerning, both in terms of the immediate impacts on health care, public health, and the longer term impacts on whether we will maintain our leadership in the health space.\"",

His grieving daughters, Mary Wenzel and Christine Gabriel, organized what they thought was a modest funeral in Illinois, but it cost more than $12,000 — money they simply didn't have.\n\n\"I lost my father and my job on the same day,\" Christine Gabriel said.\n\nFor many families, planning a funeral is like planning a wedding, except they only have a few days. It gets expensive. Nationally, the median cost of a funeral, including casket and burial, is more than $8,000, according to the National Funeral Directors Association.\n\n\"Someone dies and you realize you don't have a way to take care of them, and you're left strapped, grieving,\" said Sara Williams, president of education nonprofit Funeral Consumers Alliance.\n\nOnce a month, Williams hosts \"Death Cafes,\" where attendees can talk about dying and the costs associated with burials and funerals. While it may sound grim, Williams says what's worse is waiting too long, guessing about someone's wishes and overpaying.\n\n\"Always shop around. Visit several funeral homes. It will be the biggest gift you ever give your family,\" Williams said.\n\nMary Wenzel and Christine Gabriel have started making $300 monthly payments on their father's funeral bill. At that rate, paying it off will take more than three years. Their other worry is their mother, who is 86 and has dementia.\n\n\"We can't have another $12,000 bill,\" Gabriel said.\n\nHer advice to other families is to \"sit down, have the conversation,\" sooner rather than later.",

        "content": "Washington — President Trump on Wednesday announced the U.S. will impose a minimum baseline of 10% tariffs on goods imported from all foreign countries, as well as higher, \"reciprocal\" tariffs on nations that impose tariffs on U.S. exports, despite warnings from economists over increased prices.\n\nThe president, who signed an executive order to impose the tariffs, insisted the days of the U.S. being taken advantage of are \"over.\" The reciprocal tariffs, Mr. Trump said, will amount to roughly half the tariff rate those countries impose on U.S. exports, or less. Countries that will see tariffs higher than 10% include the European Union, China and Israel.\n\nSenior administration officials said the 10% worldwide tariffs take effect April 5 at 12:01 a.m., and the higher reciprocal tariffs go into effect on April 9 at 12:01 a.m.\n\n\"In short, chronic trade deficits are no longer merely an economic, they're a national emergency that threatens our security and our very way of life,\" the president said in a White House Rose Garden announcement. \"And for these reasons, starting tomorrow, the United States will implement reciprocal tariffs on other nations.\"\n\n\"For nations that treat us badly, we will calculate the combined rate of all their tariffs, non-monetary barriers and other forms of cheating, and because we are being very kind, we're a kind people, very kind,\" Mr. Trump said. \"You're not so kind when you're ripped off… We will charge them approximately half of what they are and have been charging us.\"\n\nAs he spoke, the president proudly held up a chart showing the new tariff rates the U.S. will begin to impose on allies, foes and everyone in between,\n\nPresident Donald Trump speaks during an event to announce new tariffs in the Rose Garden at the White House, Wednesday, April 2, 2025, in Washington. Mark Schiefelbein / AP\n\nCountries that will see \"discounted reciprocal rates,\" according to a sheet handed out by the White House, include China at a rate of 34%, on top of the tariffs the U.S. already imposes on China; 20% on goods from the European Union; 32% on Taiwan; 25% on South Korea and 17% on Israel.\n\nCanada and Mexico are not subject to these tariffs for now, senior administration officials said, but tariffs the president has already imposed, citing fentanyl and migration issues, persist.\n\nMr. Trump said \"horrendous\" trade imbalances have hurt the U.S. and put national security at risk, placing blame on previous U.S. presidents and administrations.\n\n\"It's our declaration of economic independence,\" the president said in the White House Rose Garden. Mr. Trump labeled Wednesday \"Liberation Day.\"\n\nThe president lamented that the U.S. imports phones and other electronics, as well as pharmaceuticals, saying that if there's a war, the U.S. would struggle. He said his moves Wednesday are also standing up for U.S. farmers and ranchers who have been \"brutalized\" by other countries, specifically blasting Canada.\n\nMr. Trump said the Americans \"subsidize\" a lot of other countries, calling out the European Union, China, South Korea and Australia for their trade practices.\n\n\"They've taken so much of our wealth away from us,\" Mr. Trump said of other countries.\n\nThe president said he expects complaints from \"globalists,\" \"outsourcers,\" \"special interests,\" and \"fake news\" in the days ahead, but insisted those groups have been wrong about trade before.\n\n\"In the first term, they said tariffs would crash the economy,\" Mr. Trump said. \"Instead, we built the greatest economy in the history of the world.\"\n\nIn the audience for the president's announcement were rank-and-file steelworkers and auto workers, House Speaker Mike Johnson, as well as most of Mr. Trump's Cabinet, including Vice President JD Vance.\n\nWhat new tariffs did Trump announce today?\n\nPresident Trump's White House shows which nations will see higher tariffs on the exports to the United States. April 2, 2025. White House\n\nThe president says his plan will place a minimum baseline of 10% tariffs on all countries, with reciprocal tariffs on many trading partners that have their own tariffs placed on the U.S. The 25% tariffs the president previously announced on foreign cars and foreign auto parts are set to go into effect at midnight.\n\nA White House official said the reciprocal tariffs are additive, meaning they will be imposed in addition to any previous tariffs already in place, unless a specific good is exempt under Section 232 of the Tariffs Act, which carries a flat 25% rate on certain things like steel and aluminum.\n\nHere are some of the tariff rates that Mr. Trump announced:\n\nChina — 34%\n\nEuropean Union — 20%\n\nTaiwan — 32%\n\nSouth Korea — 25%\n\nIndia — 26%\n\nIsrael — 17%\n\nNicaragua — 18%\n\nNorway — 15%\n\nJordan — 20%\n\nCountries that will see only the baseline 10% tariff rates include: Guatemala, Honduras, Argentina, El Salvador, Ecuador, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Australia and the United Kingdom.\n\nReciprocal tariff rates on China, Taiwan, India, Japan and the European Union were among the tariffs announced by President Trump on April 2, 2025. CBS News\n\nShawn Fain, president of United Auto Workers, told CBS News' \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" Sunday that tariffs are one tool to get companies to bring jobs back to the U.S.\n\n\"Tariffs are a tool in the toolbox to get these companies to do the right thing, and- and the intent behind it is to bring jobs back here,\" Fain said. \"And, you know, invest in the American workers. The American working class people have been left behind for decades, and they're sick of it.\"\n\nWhat are tariffs, exactly?\n\nTariffs are duties paid on goods imported into the U.S. The most common type of tariffs are ad valorem tariffs (Latin for \"according to the value\"), which represent a fixed percentage tax on the value of a product. The 25% auto tariffs are these types of tariffs.\n\nThere are also \"specific\" tariffs, which are levied as a fixed charge per unit, and \"tariff-rate quotas,\" which are taxes triggered by reaching a specific import threshold.\n\nWhat do financial experts say about tariffs?\n\nEconomists and taxpayer advocacy groups have their doubts, and are warning tariffs could upset economic growth and will almost surely contribute to higher prices for American consumers. Some automakers have already announced higher car prices, after the president announced tariffs on foreign cars and parts.\n\nMore than a dozen leaders at think tanks and taxpayer advocacy groups, including at the National Taxpayers Union, the Taxpayers Protection Alliance, the Small Business & Entrepreneurship Council and the Competitive Enterprise Institute, on Tuesday sent a joint letter to congressional leaders and the commerce and treasury secretaries, urging them to consider how tariffs on steel, lumber, energy, pharmaceutical and medical supplies and cars and car parts will increase prices.\n\n\"We encourage you to consider whether tariffs may, in many cases, undermine President Trump's broader long-term economic goals by increasing the cost of goods subject to tariffs,\" they wrote. \"We are especially concerned about tariffs on inputs needed by U.S. manufacturers that make it harder to compete with finished goods made abroad and tariffs that increase the price of necessities like food and housing.\"\n\nAlex Jacquez, who worked on the Biden White House National Economic Council, said that although it's hard to know the exact impact of Mr. Trump's tariffs without knowing all the details, CEOs are telling investors and shareholders they will be hiking prices.\n\n\"What the major retailers and companies who may be affected by tariffs are planning to do and they're planning out in public here is pass these costs along to consumers as much as they possibly can,\" Jacquez, now the chief of policy and advocacy at Groundwork Collaborative, said on a call with reporters Tuesday.\n\nColin Grabow, associate director at the libertarian Cato Institute's Herbert A. Stiefel Center for Trade Policy Studies, wrote in a USA Today op-ed that \"tariffs are a costly and inefficient tax usually borne by the importing country's customers.\"\n\n\"Americans may have voted for lower prices in November, but under the guise of tariff reciprocity, the Trump administration is set to deliver something very different,\" Grabow wrote.\n\nA reporter on Tuesday asked Leavitt if the president is thinking about seniors on fixed income who are stressed about the recent swings in the stock market, swings partly attributed to the president's tariff announcements. Stocks have struggled as Wall Street braces for the next round of tariffs.\n\n\"Well certainly, they are legitimate concerns and the president takes those concerns very seriously,\" Leavitt said. \"And he's addressing them every single day. And tomorrow's announcement is to protect future generations of the senior citizens you mentioned. It's for their kids and their grandkids, to ensure that there are jobs here in the United States of America for their children to live the American dream, just like they presumably did.\"\n\nAnd the president told NBC News he \"couldn't care less\" if his tariffs lead to automakers raising their prices.\n\n\"I couldn't care less if they raise prices, because people are going to start buying American-made cars,\" he told NBC.\n\nand contributed to this report.",

        "content": "Washington — The U.S. citizen wife of a 29-year-old man who the Trump administration has admitted was mistakenly deported to El Salvador said she fears for his safety in the infamous mega-prison where he's being held, maintaining that her husband is \"an amazing father\" and \"not a criminal.\"\n\nKilmar Abrego Garcia was deported to El Salvador on March 15 and imprisoned inside that country's maximum-security prison known as CECOT, as part of a series of U.S. deportation flights that have ignited a high-stakes legal battle in American courts.\n\nThe Trump administration has acknowledged in federal court that his deportation was an \"administrative error,\" since an immigration judge in 2019 had granted him legal protection from being sent to El Salvador. But it has rejected requests to bring back Abrego Garcia, saying the U.S. no longer has custody over him. It is also accusing him of being part of MS-13, a transnational criminal gang. Abrego Garcia's lawyers have said in court documents that their client has no criminal record, a finding the government has not contested.\n\nDuring an exclusive interview with CBS News, Jennifer, Abrego Garcia's wife, said she confirmed her husband had been deported from the U.S. and imprisoned at the CECOT prison after identifying him in a photo posted by the Salvadoran government.\n\n\"When I saw it, I immediately broke down 'cause I knew it was him,\" she said. \"I was scared for his life.\"\n\nJennifer, who requested that her surname be withheld, said she was \"very scared\" about Abrego Garcia's transfer to CECOT because it houses some of El Salvador's most dangerous gang members. After all, she said, the reason a U.S. immigration judge in 2019 granted him a reprieve from deportation was because of concerns that he could be persecuted by gangs in El Salvador.\n\n\"I've seen news of that prison,\" she said. \"I know they take criminals there. And my husband's not a criminal.\"\n\nAbrego Garcia came to the U.S. in 2011, when he was 16. According to court documents, he entered the country illegally, without being inspected by immigration officials.\n\nIn 2019, Abrego Garcia was arrested by Immigration and Customs Enforcement after an encounter with local police outside of a Maryland Home Depot. Abrego Garcia's attorneys said he went there looking for work. He remained in ICE detention for months, while an immigration judge reviewed his case.\n\nCourt documents show an immigration judge initially denied Abrego Garcia's release on bond, partially due to information submitted by the government that it said tied him to MS-13. The judge's bond denial, which was upheld by an immigration appeals board, mentioned information from an informant who the government deemed to be credible.\n\nBut Abrego Garcia was ultimately released from ICE custody after another immigration judge granted him \"withholding of removal,\" a legal classification that bars officials from deporting individuals who prove they are more likely than not to face persecution in their home country. In his order, the judge said Abrego Garcia could be targeted by gangs if sent to El Salvador.\n\nJennifer said her husband attended regular check-ins with ICE after he was released. He became their family's main breadwinner, she added, and helped her raise their 5-year-old disabled son, as well as two children from a previous relationship. He worked five days a week as a sheet metal worker while also attending college classes, she said.\n\nOn March 12, however, Abrego Garcia was again arrested by ICE. Jennifer said he was driving with their 5-year-old son with disabilities when he was stopped. She said she rushed to the location and was told by ICE officials that her husband's status had \"changed\" and that he would be fingerprinted and detained.\n\nOver the next few days, Jennifer said her husband was transferred to different immigration detention centers, including ones in Louisiana and Texas. During their last phone call, Jennifer said Abrego Garcia told her that he was going to be deported to El Salvador and imprisoned at CECOT.\n\nJennifer said she couldn't believe it. She told her husband there was no reason for the U.S. to send him to a foreign prison. He said that if she didn't receive another call from him, it would be because he had been deported.\n\n\"He never called,\" Jennifer said. \"I waited and waited. He never made that call.\"\n\nJennifer said she has not heard from her husband since that call and has not found a way to communicate with him. She's now suing the government as part of a lawsuit before the federal district court in Maryland that is demanding that the U.S. government take steps to bring Abrego Garcia back to the country.\n\nWhile it has conceded it mistakenly deported Abrego Garcia, the Trump administration has defended the merits of his deportation and has told the federal court in Maryland it opposes his return to the U.S.\n\nThe Justice Department has argued that federal courts lack the authority to facilitate Abrego Garcia's return, since he's now being held by the Salvadoran government and no longer in U.S. custody. Even if they did have the power to order his return, the Justice Department said in a filing, there has been \"no showing that El Salvador is even inclined to consider a request to release a detainee at the United States' request.\"\n\nTrump administration officials, including White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt, have described Abrego Garcia as an MS-13 \"leader\" who is implicated in human trafficking. Officials have yet to disclose concrete evidence that supports those claims.\n\nJennifer strongly refuted the White House's accusations, saying she would know if her husband was a gang member. Court documents indicate Abrego Garcia has traffic violations, but no criminal charges or convictions, in the U.S.\n\n\"He's not a criminal,\" Jennifer said. \"My husband is an amazing person. An amazing father.\"",

        "source": "https://www.cbsnews.com/",
        "content": "Washington — The Senate approved a measure Wednesday aimed at blocking the Canada tariffs, as a handful of Republicans bucked President Trump.\n\nIn a 51 to 48 vote, four Republicans joined all Democrats in favor of the measure. But the House is unlikely to take up the resolution, making the vote largely a symbolic one.\n\nJoining Democrats in support of the measure were Republican Sens. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Susan Collins of Maine and former GOP leader Mitch McConnell, along with Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, a Republican who co-sponsored the legislation.\n\nThe resolution, led by Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia, would terminate the national emergency that the president is using to impose the tariffs, effectively blocking the sweeping levies on foreign imports. Kaine forced the vote under the National Emergencies Act, bypassing Senate Republican leadership.\n\nThe president first threatened the tariffs on Canada and Mexico in January, touting a need to enhance border security and stop the flow of fentanyl over the nation's borders, before they were twice delayed. In a major White House announcement Wednesday, Mr. Trump said he was imposing what he termed \"reciprocal tariffs\" on about 60 nations, but exempted Canada and Mexico.\n\nCanada and Mexico are, however, facing tariffs under separate policies targeting aluminum and steel, which took effect in February, as well as vehicle imports, which are set to take effect Thursday. Speaking on Fox News Wednesday evening, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said that goods from Mexico and Canada that are currently covered by the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement would remain exempt from tariffs for now.\n\nKaine, who called the tariffs \"attacks on everyday people,\" said ahead of the vote that the president has justified the imposition of these tariffs on \"a made up emergency.\" He argued that while fentanyl is a \"real emergency,\" it's not from Canada, while warning that the Canadian tariffs will tax groceries and food products, building supplies, fertilizers, along with materials that produce ships and submarines and implicate U.S. national security.\n\nWith 47 Democrats and independents in the chamber, the resolution required the support of at least four Republicans for approval. Mr. Trump put pressure on the GOP leading up to the vote, urging that \"Republicans in the Senate MUST vote to keep the National Emergency in place, so we can finish the job, and end the scourge.\"\n\n\"Don't let the Democrats have a Victory,\" the president said in a post on Truth Social Tuesday. \"It would be devastating for the Republican Party and, far more importantly, for the United States.\"\n\nSens Tim Kaine, Ron Wyden, and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer speak to reporters following the weekly Democratic Senate policy luncheon at the U.S. Capitol on April 01, 2025 in Washington, DC. Kayla Bartkowski / Getty Images\n\nAhead of the vote, the president called out the Republican senators who supported the measure, saying in a post in the wee hours Wednesday that \"Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, and Rand Paul, also of Kentucky, will hopefully get on the Republican bandwagon, for a change.\"\n\n\"The Senate Bill is just a ploy of the Dems to show and expose the weakness of certain Republicans, namely these four, in that it is not going anywhere because the House will never approve,\" Mr. Trump continued, asking the senators' constituents to reach out to them.\n\n\"They have been extremely difficult to deal with and, unbelievably disloyal to hardworking Majority Leader John Thune, and the Republican Party itself,\" the president added.\n\nThune criticized the measure ahead of the vote, warning that it could threaten efforts to stop fentanyl from entering the country.\n\n\"We would be wrong to view this as solely a southern border problem,\" Thune said, arguing that cartels will expand fentanyl smuggling operations at the northern border if it's not addressed.\n\nThe majority leader pledged that Republicans intend to keep a promise to \"end the lawlessness at our borders.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer urged Republicans to join Democrats in supporting the resolution, calling the tariffs a \"tax increase on American families, plain and simple.\"\n\n\"Every single Senate Republican should support Tim's resolution, and support American families,\" Schumer said.\n\nThe New York Democrat cited Mr. Trump's urging of the GOP to oppose the measure, claiming that the president is \"very worried\" about the resolution.\n\n\"He knows they might lose here in the Senate,\" Schumer added.",

        "title": "Supreme Court considers South Carolina's attempt to strip Planned Parenthood of Medicaid funding",
        "source": "https://www.cbsnews.com/",
        "content": "Washington — The Supreme Court weighed Wednesday a yearslong court fight over South Carolina's attempt to boot Planned Parenthood from its Medicaid program and whether beneficiaries can sue to enforce their ability to see their preferred health care provider.\n\nSouth Carolina moved to withhold Medicaid funds from a Planned Parenthood affiliate in 2018, four years before the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade and left the issue of abortion policy to the states. But since that then, the landscape for abortion care has shifted drastically, with a dozen states enacting near-total bans on abortion and another four states, including South Carolina, outlawing the procedure after six weeks gestation.\n\nWhile Planned Parenthood provides abortion services outside of Medicaid as allowed under state laws, anti-abortion rights groups and lawmakers at the state and federal levels have long been working to keep public health dollars away from the group. Its clinics also offer contraception, pregnancy testing, gender-affirming care and screenings for cancer and conditions like diabetes and high blood pressure.\n\nThe question in the case is a technical one: whether Medicaid beneficiaries can sue to enforce a provision of the Medicaid Act that allows them to seek care from the qualified and willing provider of their choosing. But if South Carolina prevails in the dispute, it could pave the way for more states to defund Planned Parenthood through their state Medicaid plans.\n\nThe court, which has a 6-3 conservative majority, appeared divided over whether Medicaid recipients can sue under a federal civil rights law to enforce the provision, known as the any-qualified provider requirement.\n\n\"We need something that's out of the ordinary that signals to the federal court, this is not just something that the state must do, this is something that allows the individual to go into court and get enforcement,\" Justice Samuel Alito said of a statute's language.\n\nBut Justice Elena Kagan warned that if the Supreme Court were to accept South Carolina's argument that a statute must include words such as right, privilege or entitlement in order to allow an individual to file a suit to enforce it, it is \"changing the rules midstream.\"\n\nNicole Saharsky, who argued on behalf of Planned Parenthood, told the justices that South Carolina is trying to disqualify a provider from its Medicaid program for reasons that are unrelated to its medical qualifications. It has been established that the state violated Medicaid patients' ability to choose their own doctor, \"the only question is whether she can do something about it,\" she said.\n\n\"Congress expected that an individual would be able to sue in the rare instance when a state is keeping a needy patient away from a qualified and willing provider,\" Saharsky said. \"If the individual can't sue, this provision will be meaningless.\"\n\nThe legal battle over Planned Parenthood's funding in South Carolina began in July 2018, when Gov. Henry McMaster issued an executive order directing the state's health department to deem abortion providers unqualified to provide family-planning services under Medicaid and terminate enrollment agreements.\n\nFederal law prohibits Medicaid from paying for abortions except in cases of rape or incest, or to save the life of the mother. But the state argued that because money is fungible, giving Medicaid dollars to abortion providers frees up other money to provide the procedure.\n\nThe South Carolina Department of Health and Human Services notified Planned Parenthood South Atlantic, which has clinics in Charleston and Columbia, that its provider agreements were being cancelled because it was no longer qualified to provide services to Medicaid recipients.\n\nPlanned Parenthood South Atlantic offers prenatal and postpartum services, as well as cancer screenings, physical exams and screenings for health conditions and cancer. But the state says that there are more than 140 other federally qualified health clinics and pregnancy centers across South Carolina who accept Medicaid and can provide services to low-income patients.\n\nNearly 20% of South Carolina residents are insured through Medicaid, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation, and 25% of its residents live in medically underserved areas.\n\nAfter Planned Parenthood was disqualified from participating in South Carolina's Medicaid program, Julie Edwards, a patient who received health services from the Planned Parenthood affiliate, and the organization filed a lawsuit challenging the state's termination decision.\n\nEdwards alleged in her lawsuit that the state's cancellation of Planned Parenthood South Atlantic's agreement violated her right to choose her provider under the Medicaid Act and asked a federal district court to issue an order allowing her and other patients to continue receiving care from Planned Parenthood.\n\nThe district court sided with Edwards, finding that Medicaid patients can sue to obtain health care services from their preferred qualified and willing provider. The court also held that South Carolina likely violated the any-qualified provider requirement by terminating Planned Parenthood's participation in the state Medicaid program without cause.\n\nA federal appeals court on numerous different occasions concluded that Edwards' had a right to sue and blocked South Carolina from excluding Planned Parenthood from its Medicaid program. The Supreme Court agreed in December to take up South Carolina's appeal.\n\nDefenders of South Carolina's move have argued that states are better suited to decide where to spend the Medicaid dollars they receive from the federal government, which they said leads to better treatment for low-income patients and their families.\n\n\"You've got roughly 200 publicly funded health care clinics in South Carolina that provide a broad range of high-quality health care services, including family-planning services,\" said John Bursch, a lawyer with the Alliance Defending Freedom, a conservative legal group. Bursch is arguing on behalf of South Carolina at the Supreme Court.\n\nHe continued, \"South Carolina is entitled to decide that there are better options, and that's exactly what it's done.\"\n\nBursch told the justices during oral arguments that Congress knows how to write legislation that clearly grants a private right that can be enforced through the courts, as it has done so in other statutes. But the provision at issue in the case involving Planned Parenthood doesn't use the word \"right\" or similar words like \"privilege\" or \"entitlement.\"\n\n\"If there is any ambiguity in this context, the state has to win because it's not put on notice of when it might be sued,\" he said. \"At the end of the day, putting states on clear notice requires explicit rights-creating language.\"\n\nJustice Brett Kavanaugh said that the goal is to provide clear guidance for courts to follow.\n\n\"I'm not allergic to magic words because magic words, if they represent the principle, will provide the clarity that will avoid the litigation that is a huge waste of resources for states, courts, providers, beneficiaries and Congress,\" he said.\n\nSeveral states have taken steps to block Planned Parenthood from receiving Medicaid funding, including Texas, Mississippi, Missouri and Arkansas. Two federal appeals courts, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 8th Circuit, ruled that Medicaid patients do not have a right to sue over the state's decision to exclude Planned Parenthood from states' Medicaid programs.\n\nBut several other appeals courts have blocked state efforts to cut off the organization from Medicaid dollars. If the Supreme Court rules for South Carolina, it would clear the way for more states to exclude Planned Parenthood from their Medicaid programs.\n\n\"The reason why they would do that is pretty simple,\" Bursch said. \"Many Americans don't want their tax dollars propping up the abortion industry, especially when those dollars can be better spent on real health care.\"\n\nBut Saharsky said that Congress' goal when writing the law was to stop states from excluding Medicaid providers from their programs arbitrarily, which she said South Carolina is doing with its effort to stop Planned Parenthood from receiving public health dollars. While Saharsky noted that a state would receive significant deference if it disqualified a provider from its Medicaid program because of questions of medical competence, she said that is not what is at issue in this case.\n\n\"It is only that there is something Planned Parenthood is doing outside of Medicaid that the state wants to disqualify it from the program,\" she said.\n\nKagan warned that if states were allowed to provide their own justifications for terminating Medicaid provider agreements without the potential for recourse by patients, it would pave the way for states to \"split up the world by providers.\"\n\n\"That does not seem what this statute is all about, is allowing states to do that and then giving individuals no ability to come back and say, 'that's wrong. I'm entitled to see my provider of choice regardless of what they think about contraception or abortion or gender-transition treatment,'\" she said.\n\nBefore the arguments, Amy Friedrich-Karnik, director of federal policy at the Guttmacher Institute, a pro-abortion rights research organization, said at stake in the case is the ability of Medicaid beneficiaries to get the health care they need from the provider they know and trust.\n\n\"A loss in this case not only means that Medicaid patients in South Carolina would be unable to access Planned Parenthood, the ripple effect of that could mean that Medicaid patients across the country and particularly in states that might be inclined to want to restrict Medicaid recipients' ability to get care, it could affect all of those folks, and it fundamentally affects their ability to access really needed reproductive health care services that Planned Parenthood provides,\" she said.\n\nFriedrich-Karnik also said that a win for South Carolina would encourage the Trump administration to urge states to kick Planned Parenthood off state Medicaid plans.\n\n\"It emboldens the federal government, and it emboldens state governments who would like to restrict people's access in this way to do so,\" she said.\n\nThe Trump administration is backing South Carolina in the case and warned that a decision affirming the lower courts would invite a flood of litigation as beneficiaries seek to enforce other provisions of the Medicaid law and other statutes.\n\nJustice Amy Coney Barrett questioned what would flow from a ruling that allowed Medicaid recipients to bring lawsuits to enforce the any-provider provision.\n\n\"We're here because of Planned Parenthood not being a qualified provider in South Carolina, but would this open the floodgates of people bringing\" lawsuits because they can't see the provider of their choice, she asked Kyle Hawkins, counselor to the solicitor general, who argued for the federal government.\n\nSeparately, Project 2025, the policy blueprint overseen by the conservative Heritage Foundation, calls on the Department of Health and Human Services to limit Planned Parenthood's funding through Medicaid in part by issuing guidance reemphasizing that states can strip the group of its public dollars in state plans.\n\nA decision from the Supreme Court is expected by the end of June.",

        "source": "https://www.cbsnews.com/",
        "content": "New York City Mayor Eric Adams' historic federal corruption case has been dropped.\n\nJudge Dale Ho has agreed to the U.S. Department of Justice's request to drop the charges against Adams, but he did so \"with prejudice.\" That means Adams cannot be re-tried on the same charges at a later time - a stipulation the Justice Department sought in its initial request to dismiss the case.\n\nThe decision to formally drop the case comes after Judge Ho appointed Paul Clement as a \"friend of the court\" to present arguments over the DOJ's request. The initial hearing on the request did not include anyone who opposed the move. In his filing to the court, Clement argued the case should be dropped with prejudice to prevent the appearance that Adams remains under political pressure.\n\nTimeline: The corruption case against NYC Mayor Eric Adams\n\nThe outcome appears to put an end to the legal jeopardy that Adams had been in ever since he was indicted last September on five counts of bribery, conspiracy and campaign finance violations.\n\n\"The case against Eric Adams should have never been brought in the first place—and finally today that case is gone forever. From Day 1, the mayor has maintained his innocence and now justice for Eric Adams and New Yorkers has prevailed,\" Adams' attorney Alex Spiro said.\n\n\"This case was an example of political weaponization and a waste of resources. We are focused on arresting and prosecuting terrorists while returning the Department of Justice to its core mission of keeping Americans safe,\" the Department of Justice said in a statement.\n\nIn the DOJ request to drop the case, prosecutors said having it hang over Adams interfered with his 2025 mayoral campaign and his ability to cooperate with the Trump administration's crackdown on immigration.\n\nThe initial request to drop the charges made note that the decision was not based on \"the strength of the evidence or the legal theories on which the case is based.\"\n\nThat triggered concerns that Adams could not effectively govern the city because he would be beholden to the Trump administration, as long as the possibility of the charges returning remained in place.\n\nAdams and his attorneys have vehemently denied any wrongdoing.\n\nMayor Adams responds to charges being dropped\n\nAdams spoke at Gracie Mansion after the case against him was dropped.\n\n\"As I've said all along, this case should have never been brought and I did nothing wrong,\" Adams said. \"I am now happy that our city can finally close the book and focus solely on the future of our great city. I want to thank New Yorkers who stood by my side, who prayed for me, who supported me from day one and stuck with me while we focused on the work at hand.\"\n\nHe offered an apology to New Yorkers.\n\n\"I also want to apologize to New Yorkers for having to go through this with me, a baseless case that should have never been brought in the first place,\" Adams said.\n\nAdams said New Yorkers are his \"north star\" and he thinks about them every day.\n\n\"I'm a New Yorker, and this is the greatest city on the globe, and it's a privilege being your mayor, something I did not take for granted one day, and I'm going to continue to serve you,\" Adams said. \"As I have repeatedly said, I have always been solely beholden to the people of this city. No special interests, no political opponents, but just everyday New Yorkers. Just you, and I'm going to continue to do that. So today we turn the page, we move forward together.\"\n\nBefore he went back into Gracie Mansion, Adams held up a copy of \"Government Gangsters,\" a book by FBI Director Kash Patel.\n\n\"Read it and understand how we can never allow this to happen to another innocent American,\" Adams said.\n\nMore on the judge's ruling\n\nJudge Ho's decision includes words Adams' opponents are sure to focus in on: \"Everything here smacks of a bargain, dismissal of the indictment in exchange for immigration policy concessions.\"\n\nIn his ruling to dismiss the case with prejudice, Judge Ho took issue with the Department of Justice's request to dismiss the case without prejudice, meaning he could've faced trial on the same charges again at a later time.\n\nJudge Ho summarized the DOJ's reasoning to drop the case as based on three things: It's tainted with impropriety, detrimental to national security and immigration enforcement, and was a weak case to begin with.\n\n\"There may or may not be good reasons to drop this prosecution. But the reasons articulated by DOJ, if taken at face value, are inconsistent with a decision to leave the charges in the Indictment hanging like the proverbial Sword of Damocles over the Mayor,\" Judge Ho wrote. \"And there are many reasons to be troubled by DOJ's proffered rationales—further supporting dismissal with prejudice.\"\n\nJudge Ho also addressed why he couldn't continue to pursue the case after the DOJ moved to dismiss it.\n\n\"Some will undoubtedly find today's decision unsatisfying, wondering why, if DOJ's ostensible reasons for dropping this case are so troubling, the Court does not simply deny the Motion to Dismiss altogether. But, as explained above, the Court cannot order DOJ to continue the prosecution, and it is aware of no authority (outside of the criminal contempt context) that would empower it, as some have urged, to appoint an independent prosecutor,\" Judge Ho wrote. \"Therefore, any decision by this Court to deny the Government's Motion to Dismiss would be futile at best, because DOJ could—and, by all indications, unequivocally would—simply refuse to prosecute the case, inevitably resulting in a dismissal after seventy days for violating the Mayor's right to a speedy trial. That route would simply postpone finality in this case to a date uncomfortably close to the June 24 mayoral primary. The public interest would not be served by such an outcome.\"\n\n\"To be clear, the Court again emphasizes that it does not express any opinion as to the merits of the case or whether the prosecution of Mayor Adams 'should' move forward,\" Judge Ho added.\n\n\"Legally speaking, he is innocent until proven guilty, and he will never be proven guilty - that is an unequivocal, it is rare when we can rarely say things that definitively - but he will never face legal consequences for the allegations that were against him in this case,\" Hofstra Law Professor James Sample said.\n\nImpact on the mayor's race\n\nThe timing of the decision to drop the case is critical for Adams, who is facing a Thursday midnight deadline to file petitions to run for mayor in New York City's Democratic primary.\n\nThe decision means Adams is now free to run without the threat of going to jail, or facing a politically damaging trial.\n\nCBS News New York has learned that Adams is immediately jumping into the political fray, and he plans to participate in a mayoral candidates forum sponsored by the National Action Network Thursday.\n\n\"He looks forward to engaging with fellow candidates and community leaders to discuss the future of our great city,\" a spokesman said.\n\nSince there's no possibility of the charges against him resurfacing, Adams can also say he is not beholden to President Trump or his administration, since they can no longer bring the same case against him. Adams has repeatedly said that, and just Tuesday night, New York City joined a suit against the Trump administration to challenge cuts that would cost New York City $100 million in CDC funding.\n\n\"When federal policies directly impact our city, we have been, and will continue to be, the first and loudest to advocate for New Yorkers. These funds are crucial in protecting public health, and the reversal will have serious consequences for communities across the five boroughs,\" Adams said in his statement Tuesday night.\n\nEven before Adams officially learned that his case had been dropped, Adams made it clear at a National Action Network event Wednesday that suggestions he was \"under the finger\" of President Trump were, in his mind, false.\n\n\"I do not know who you think I'm under the finger of,\" Adams said Wednesday morning. \"But I'm on the finger of Eric Adams, the mayor of the city of New York, and I'm going to continue to do so.\"\n\nAdams also made an argument voters can expect to hear if he seeks another term.\n\n\"I'm the same person that made sure we put $17 billion in the [minority and women-owned businesses] in this city, that invested in foster care children, that built more housing in year one and year two of our administration than in the history of this city,\" Adams said.\n\nAdams has not made clear how he intends to run for re-election - as a Democrat, independent, or perhaps even as a Republican.\n\nAdams has previously told CBS News New York's Marcia Kramer to expect twists and turns in the upcoming mayoral election.\n\nAdams' opposition speaks out\n\nThe mayor's detractors were also speaking out.\n\n\"Either way, I think there was tremendous damage that was done to this city because of an Adams administration, so the quickest we can get away from this administration, I think the better for the city,\" Public Advocate Jumaane Williams said.\n\n\"It's absolutely disgusting. You have a man that broke the law. We want to remind people that it wasn't just about flight upgrades. This was a man who illegally held a campaign donor scheme, and the fact that the judge unfortunately bowed to Trump is appalling,\" mayoral candidate Michael Blake said.\n\n\"The ruling does not change the facts: Eric Adams works for Donald Trump, not New Yorkers,\" mayoral candidate and city Comptroller Brad Lander said.\n\n\"Eric Adams has sold out New Yorkers and put himself above the public at every chance he could. Even the judge in the case agrees: this slimy deal reeks of a quid pro quo with the Trump administration. In exchange for his freedom, Adams has looked the other way while the federal government detains and disappears New Yorkers, steals money from our city, and wages war on working people. Adams should resign in disgrace,\" mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani said.\n\nMove to drop charges sparked resignations\n\nThe DOJ memo seeking to drop the charges set off a spate of resignations that started in City Hall, at the very heart of Adams' inner circle, and reached all the way to the U.S. attorney's office. At issue was then-Acting U.S. Attorney of the Southern District of New York Danielle Sassoon's allegation that the request to dismiss the case amounted to a quid pro quo, namely Adams' cooperation on President Trump's immigration enforcement in exchange for his charges being dropped. Sassoon resigned, rather than drop the charges, as did several other people in the U.S. attorney's office.\n\nThe mayor and his attorney pushed back strenuously against the notion of a quid pro quo.\n\n\"The idea that there was a quid pro quo is a total lie. We offered nothing and the department asked nothing of us,\" Adams' attorney Alex Spiro said.\n\nAllegations that Adams had been compromised by the Trump administration and was operating, essentially, under its thumb led four New York City deputy mayors to resign and spurred numerous calls for Adams to step down. Gov. Kathy Hochul, who has the power to remove Adams from office, then met with key leaders to discuss his future. She ultimately acted to limit Adams' powers in a bid to restore trust in government, but said she wouldn't remove him.\n\nWhat Adams has been accused of\n\nLast September, federal prosecutors alleged Adams had been abusing his power for almost a decade. They said he solicited illegal campaign donations from wealthy foreigners and corporations, including a Turkish government official.\n\nIn the 57-page indictment, Adams was accused of receiving gifts he didn't disclose, including luxury travel, worth more than $100,000, in return for political favors.\n\n\"These upgrades and freebies were not part of some frequent flyer or loyalty program available to the general public. As we allege, this was a multi-year scheme to buy favor with a single New York City politician on the rise,\" then-U.S. District Attorney for the Southern District Damian Williams said as he announced the indictment.\n\nProsecutors accused Adams of pressuring FDNY officials to approve the Turkish consulate building in Manhattan, despite fire safety concerns.\n\nThe Adams campaign was also accused of using \"straw donors\" for illicit contributions, enabling it to tap into $10 million in matching funds.\n\n\"These are bright red lines, and we allege that the mayor crossed them again and again for years,\" Williams said.\n\nBefore the DOJ stepped in, prosecutors appeared to be ramping up their case, claiming they had uncovered \"additional criminal conduct.\"\n\nAdams associates also under investigation\n\nThe historic indictment came amid multiple investigations into Adams' campaign, as well as other administration officials.\n\nNumerous top members of the Adams administration resigned before the indictment was announced, including former NYPD Commissioner Edward Caban and his twin brother, James Caban. Former Schools Chancellor David Banks and his wife, former Deputy Mayor Sheena Wright, and his brother, former Deputy Mayor Philip Banks III, were also investigated.\n\nIngrid Lewis-Martin, a longtime Adams advisor, pleaded not guilty to bribery, money laundering and conspiracy in a case involving her son and two real estate developers. The mayor's former liaison for the Muslim community, Mohamed Bahi, was also charged with conspiracy for his role in collecting illegal donations for Adams' 2021 mayoral campaign and has agreed to plead guilty, according to court documents.\n\ncontributed to this report.",

        "content": "Man accused of trying to kill Brett Kavanaugh in 2022 plans to plead guilty\n\nNicholas Roske of California, who was found outside Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh's home with weapons in 2022, intends to plead guilty to a federal charge of attempting to assassinate a justice of the United States, court filings obtained by CBS News revealed.\n\nAccording to a submission Wednesday afternoon from Roske's defense attorney, \"Mr. Roske wishes to plead guilty to the one-count Indictment pending against him.\" Roske had pleaded not guilty following his arrest.\n\nA new plea hearing could be scheduled for as early as Monday in federal court in Greenbelt, Maryland.\n\nRoske was found in June 2022 outside Kavanaugh's Montgomery County, Maryland, home armed with a gun, knife and burglary tools, according to court documents.\n\nRoske, who was 26 when he was arrested, is from Simi Valley, California. If convicted, Roske faced a maximum sentence of 20 years in federal prison.\n\nOn June 8, 2022, U.S. deputy marshals reported seeing a person dressed in black clothing and carrying a backpack and suitcase get out of a taxi that stopped in front of a current justice's house at roughly 1:05 a.m., according to an FBI affidavit filed in court. The person looked at the two marshals and turned to walk down the street, an FBI agent wrote.\n\nThe Montgomery County Emergency Communications Center then received a call from a person, who identified himself as Roske, saying he was having suicidal thoughts and had a firearm in his suitcase. Roske also said he came from California to kill a \"specific United States Supreme Court justice,\" according to the filing.\n\nMontgomery County police officers were dispatched to the location, where they found Roske. He was taken into custody without incident, and authorities seized his backpack and suitcase. Police found in his belongings a black tactical chest rig and tactical knife, a Glock 17 pistol with two magazines and ammunition, pepper spray, zip ties, a hammer, screwdriver, nail punch, crow bar, pistol light, duct tape, hiking boots with padding on the outside of the soles, and other items, the affidavit states.\n\nAfter he was transported to the police department in Bethesda, Maryland, Roske told a detective he was upset about the recent leak of a draft Supreme Court opinion in a blockbuster abortion case and the recent school shooting in Uvalde, Texas. At the time, the Supreme Court was also set to issue a decision in a case involving a New York law imposing limits on concealed carry of handguns in public. The court ultimately struck down the law.",

        "source": "https://www.cbsnews.com/",
        "content": "Washington — Senate Republicans unveiled a budget resolution on Wednesday, as the GOP seeks to move forward with the budget plan that will enable them to implement President Trump's agenda later this week.\n\nThe Senate Budget committee released the 70-page budget resolution on Wednesday, which would serve as a blueprint, directing congressional committees to craft their own proposals to hit spending targets, increasing or decreasing funding by adjusting programs and policies that fall under their purview. The plan is a key step toward implementing the president's priorities on border security, defense, energy and taxes. It aims to make the 2017 tax cuts permanent, along with authorizing $1.5 trillion in additional tax cuts, while raising the debt ceiling by as much as $5 trillion.\n\nThe blueprint is a compromise resolution that comes after a key meeting between Senate Majority Leader John Thune, House Speaker Mike Johnson and top tax leaders last week. Though House and Senate Republicans had previously forged ahead with their own budget blueprints in recent weeks, the two chambers must adopt the same budget plan to continue on in the reconciliation process — a complicated maneuver that allows Congress to bypass the 60-vote threshold typically required to advance legislation in the Senate.\n\n\"It is now time for the Senate to move forward with this budget resolution in order to further advance our shared Republican agenda in Congress,\" Thune said in a statement as the resolution was released.\n\nThune said the budget resolution will \"pave the way for a generational investment in border security and national defense and unleash American energy dominance,\" while demonstrating a commitment to \"reducing the size and scope of the federal government by cutting waste, fraud, and abuse.\"\n\nSenate Majority Leader John Thune speaks as Senate Budget Committee chairman Sen. Lindsey Graham listens during the Senate Republicans' news conference in the Capitol on Tuesday, Feb. 11, 2025. Bill Clark/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images\n\nThe Senate set relatively low minimum floors for spending cuts for a number of committees, at just a few billion dollars, while it calls for at least $1.5 trillion in spending cuts over a 10-year period in the House. The Senate is expected to find far more than the floor outlined in the resolution, but the figures are aimed at giving them flexibility moving forward.\n\nThe Senate majority leader outlined to reporters earlier Wednesday that he plans to file the resolution on the floor after its release, which would start a clock of up to 50 hours of debate and set up a late week vote-a-rama, where senators are allowed to introduce an unlimited number of amendments and force the chamber to vote through the night. The timeline could set the House on a path to adopt the changes to the budget resolution next week, delivering a key win for President Trump and congressional Republicans before lawmakers leave town for Easter recess.\n\nThe budget resolution's release comes as the majority leader and Senate Budget Committee Republicans met with President Trump earlier Wednesday at the White House, where Thune said committee members aired their views with the president.\n\nSen. John Kennedy, a Louisiana Republican, told reporters after the meeting that the members made the point that their priorities are to extend the Trump tax cuts, to further refine the tax code to encourage growth and extend the debt limit while reducing spending. And he noted that the meeting allayed some of the concerns of budget hawks.\n\nSen. Ron Johnson, a Wisconsin Republican, said after the meeting that feels \"a lot more comfortable\" with the budget resolution, saying \"there's just a real commitment to returning the federal budget to a reasonable pre-pandemic baseline.\"\n\nThe development also comes as Senate Republicans opted to proceed without the Senate parliamentarian's sign off, arguing in recent days that they don't need the parliamentarian's permission to move ahead with the current policy baseline, an accounting approach that would make it appear that extending the current tax policy would cost nothing.\n\nIn order to approve legislation using the reconciliation maneuver, lawmakers must first approve a budget resolution and direct committees to craft bills reconciling spending with the new budget goals. The final product can only include provisions dealing with taxes, spending or the debt limit, and any new spending must be paid for. The Senate parliamentarian must also sign off on the package, confirming that the provisions have direct budgetary consequences, if an item is challenged.\n\nKennedy reiterated the widely held GOP position Wednesday that \"we don't need the parliamentarian's permission,\" arguing that the Budget Committee chairman, Sen. Lindsey Graham, has the authority to make that decision on the current policy baseline. He projected that Senate Democrats will challenge it, but \"they'll lose.\"\n\nGraham said in a statement upon the resolution's release that \"I have determined that current policy will be the budget baseline regarding taxation.\"\n\n\"This will allow the tax cuts to be permanent – which will tremendously boost the economy,\" he added.",

        "content": "San Ysidro, California — On the U.S. side of the border between San Diego, California, and Tijuana, Mexico, there is a section in between double fencing that is used by U.S. Customs and Border Protection as a makeshift holding facility to process migrants who cross into the U.S. illegally.\n\nIt's here that Bri Stensrud of Colorado Springs recently brought a group of 15 women to the border for the first time to meet with some of those migrants. Stensrud is director of Women of Welcome, a nonprofit migrant aid group made up of evangelical women from across the U.S. who are attempting to help asylum seekers, something they say is a Biblical calling.\n\n\"The Bible doesn't say anything about U.S. immigration policy,\" Stensrud told CBS News. \"But it does have a heck of a lot to say about God's heart for the immigrant.\"\n\nStensrud describes herself as an abortion-rights opponent and staunch conservative. But she says one particular experience clouded her views on immigration.\n\n\"Visiting an unaccompanied migrant shelter, I met two young girls, 11 and 13, who were mothers, and that was shocking to me because I had a young daughter at home, and no child chooses to be a mother at that age,\" Stensrud said. \"So I immediately realized what America is being told was not the full story.\"\n\nShe says the story the U.S. is being told is that \"those who are coming to the border all have nefarious reasons for coming. They are the worst of the worst of every country. And that's not what I saw.\"\n\nWhite evangelical Christians helped deliver President Trump his November victory, and a campaign that was built on his promise to stem illegal immigration. He won the support of about eight in 10 voters in that voting bloc, which represented about a quarter of the total electorate, according to CBS News exit poll data.\n\n\"I think any time a more conservative evangelical engages in the issues of immigrants and immigration as a whole, you do feel like you're in a very lonely spot,\" Stensrud said.\n\nThat prompted Stensrud to create a space that's a little less lonely for other conservative women. And her group gives them a firsthand experience of the realities at the border.\n\nOn this particular day, the Women of Welcome brought by Stensrud met with migrants from Mexico and Turkey who were being held in the makeshift processing area, providing them with snacks, water and information on what would happen next.\n\nStensrud also took her group across the border into Tijuana to visit a migrant shelter.\n\n\"What we're asking these women to do is to go over and sit with another person, and to care about where they came from and why they came,\" Stensrud said. \"And we're going to say, 'You matter.' And that's powerful.\"\n\nShe adds, \"Why are we forcing a family to wait on a dirt trash pile and use a dirty porta potty and get fed a granola bar a day, when I know we can do better?\"",

        "content": "Netanyahu vows to intensify pressure in Gaza as Hamas says it approved ceasefire proposal\n\nJerusalem — Israel's renewed military offensive in the Gaza Strip is \"expanding to crush and clean the area\" of militants and to seize \"large areas that will be added to the security zones of the State of Israel,\" Defense Minister Israel Katz said in a written statement on Wednesday. The Israeli government has long maintained a buffer zone just inside Gaza along its security fence, which has greatly expanded since the war with Hamas was sparked by the groups Oct. 7, 2023 terrorist attack.\n\nIsrael says the buffer zone is needed for its security, but Palestinians view it as a land grab that further shrinks the narrow coastal territory, home to around 2 million people.\n\nKatz didn't specify which areas of Gaza would be seized in the expanded operation, which he said includes the \"extensive evacuation\" of the population from fighting areas. His statement came after the Israeli military ordered all civilians to evacuate the southern city of Rafah and nearby areas — an order that came about two weeks after Israel abandoned a ceasefire that brokered by the U.S., Qatar and Egypt and resumed its bombardment of the Palestinian territory.\n\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said Israel aims to maintain an open-ended but unspecified security control of the Gaza Strip once it achieves its aim of crushing Hamas.\n\n\"The only way to end the war\"?\n\nKatz called on Gaza residents to \"expel Hamas and return all hostages.\" Hamas, long a U.S.- and Israeli-designated terrorist organization, still holds 59 captives, of whom 24 are believed to still be alive, after most of the rest were released in ceasefire agreements or other deals.\n\n\"This is the only way to end the war,\" Katz said.\n\nThe Hostage Families Forum, which represents most captives' families and has long pushed for an agreement to end the war and bring their loved ones home, disagreed with that assessment, however. The forum issued a statement saying the families were \"horrified to wake up this morning to the Defense Minister's announcement about expanding military operations in Gaza.\"\n\nThe group said the Israeli government \"has an obligation to free all 59 hostages from Hamas captivity — to pursue every possible channel to advance a deal for their release,\" and stressed that every passing day puts their loved ones' lives at greater risk.\n\n\"Their lives hang in the balance as more and more disturbing details continue to emerge about the horrific conditions they're being held in — chained, abused, and in desperate need of medical attention,\" said the forum, which called on the Trump administration and other mediators to continue pressuring Hamas to release the hostages.\n\n\"Our highest priority must be an immediate deal to bring ALL hostages back home — the living for rehabilitation and those killed for proper burial — and end this war,\" the group said.\n\nDeath and displacement in Gaza 16 days after Israel resumes war\n\nIsrael continued to target the Gaza Strip 16 days after abandoning the ceasefire, with airstrikes overnight killing 17 people in the southern city of Khan Younis, hospital officials said. Officials at the Nasser Hospital said the bodies of 12 people killed in an overnight airstrike that were brought to the hospital included five women, one of them pregnant, and two children. Officials at the Gaza European Hospital said they received five bodies of people killed in two separate airstrikes.\n\nPalestinians mourn over loved ones killed in Israeli strikes at the Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis, southern Gaza, April 2, 2025. Hani Alshaer/Anadolu/Getty\n\nThe war was sparked by the Hamas-led terrorist attack on southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, which killed about 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and saw 251 others taken as hostages back into Gaza.\n\nIsrael's retaliatory war in Gaza has killed more than 50,400 Palestinians, including at least 1,066 killed since the ceasefire fell apart on March 18, according to Gaza's Hamas-run Health Ministry, which doesn't differentiate between civilian and combatant casualties.\n\nIsrael claims to have killed around 20,000 militants in Gaza, but it has not provided evidence.\n\nAs of March 23, more than 140,000 people had been displaced again since the end of the ceasefire, according to the latest U.N. estimate — and tens of thousands more are estimated to have fled under evacuation orders over the past week. Every time families have moved during the war, they have had to leave behind belongings and start nearly from scratch, finding food, water and shelter. Now, with no fuel entering due to an Israeli blockade, transportation is even more difficult, so many are fleeing with almost nothing.\n\n\"With each displacement, we're tortured a thousand times,\" said former university professor Ihab Suliman, who spoke of having to flee eight times during the war with this family.\n\nFleeing from Rafah on Monday, Hanadi Dahoud said she was struggling to find essentials.\n\n\"Where do we go?\" she said. \"We just want to live. We are tired. There are long queues waiting for bread and charity kitchens.\"\n\nUnited Nations spokesman Stephane Dujarric said Tuesday that the U.N.'s myriad humanitarian aid agencies were \"at the tail end of our supplies,\" forcing the World Food Program to close all 25 of its bakeries in Gaza due to a lack of flour and cooking fuel.\n\n\"WFP doesn't close its bakeries for fun,\" Dujarric said, adding that the food situation remained \"very critical\" since Israel closed all crossings into Gaza a month ago, cutting off virtually all humanitarian deliveries into the enclave.\n\nCOGAT, the Israeli military body in charge of civilian affairs in the Palestinian territories, said Tuesday that nearly 450,000 tons of aid entered Gaza during the ceasefire. COGAT claimed at least some of the aid from the U.N. and its humanitarian partners was being diverted to Hamas.\n\nDujarric rejected that saying: \"The U.N. has kept a chain of custody, and a very good chain of custody, on all the aid.\"",

        "source": "https://www.cbsnews.com/",
        "content": "Industry leaders and business owners are warning that sweeping new tariffs on U.S. imports announced by the Trump administration on Wednesday could raise prices for American consumers.\n\nPresident Trump said the U.S. would impose a 10% tariff on all countries and matching, or \"reciprocal,\" tariffs on roughly 60 nations that charge higher duties on American exports.\n\nConsumer Technology Association CEO Gary Shapiro said in a statement to CBS News that the reciprocal tariffs amount to \"massive tax hikes on Americans that will drive inflation, kill jobs on Main Street and may cause a recession for the U.S. economy.\"\n\n\"Americans will become poorer because of these tariffs,\" he added.\n\nMichelle Korsmo, CEO of the National Restaurant Association, said that the reciprocal levies could disrupt the industry by hiking food and packaging costs, which operators will have to pass on to consumers in the form of higher prices.\n\nMichael Cervantes, who owns the Banks Alehouse in Fairbanks, Alaska, expressed concern about the new tariffs.\n\n\"It's not just 10% because there is a ripple effect trying to get the product out of Mexico, for example. It's going to cost the distributors more, and they're not going to do it for free, so the 10% will trickle down,\" he told CBS MoneyWatch. \"They might put a little something else on it, and by the time it gets to me I am estimating it will cost around 18% more\" than before the tariffs were in place. \"And that's coming right off my bottom line.\"\n\nAlthough Cervantes said he'll have to pass some of the added costs along to patrons, he is reluctant to raise prices too much given that his restaurant serves comfort food.\n\n\"I can't just say, 'My burger costs $25.' People won't pay for it,\" he said. \"This is one more piece [Trump] is taking away from us.\"\n\nLouis Amoroso, co-founder of Full Glass Wine, a Los Angeles-based direct-to-consumer wine merchant, said upwards of 60% of the wine it sells is made domestically, while some 40% comes from abroad. Responding to Mr. Trump's tariff announcement Wednesday, Amoroso told CBS MoneyWatch that the company will have to adjust that ratio.\n\n\"We will look to do rejigger some of our buying so we have as little impact on our customers as possible,\" he said. \"We'll bring less than we were in from France and Italy because we're all about providing value to our customers, who are very cost- conscious.\"\n\nAmoroso said he plans to source more wine from California and from countries that aren't subject to steep reciprocal tariff rates.\n\nShoe manufacturers also could face significantly higher costs given that the U.S. imports a large share of its footwear from other countries. Matt Priest, CEO of the Footwear Distributors and Retailers of America, a trade organization representing shoe manufacturers, said in a statement Wednesday that the new levies will be \"catastrophic\" for Americans.\n\n\"We had hoped the president would take a more targeted approach, but these broad tariffs will only drive up costs, reduce product quality and weaken consumer confidence,\" he said. \"Our industry is already dealing with inflationary pressures, and this move will force families to think twice before making a purchase. That's bad for Americans and the economy.\"\n\nFor his part, Mr. Trump had a clear message for companies that object to his foreign trade policy.\n\n\"To any company that objects... if they complain, if you want your tariff rate to be zero, then you build your product right here in America because there is no tariff,\" Mr. Trump said in a briefing in the White House's Rose Garden.\n\nMr. Trump also cited some major corporations that he said have committed to investing in domestic manufacturing, including Apple, Japanese automaker Honda, AI leader Nvidia, pharmaceutical company Johnson & Johnson and Taiwanese chipmaker TSMC.\n\n\"They've committed to build, build, build,\" Mr. Trump said.",

        "content": "What to know as prosecutors seek death penalty for Luigi Mangione\n\nFederal prosecutors were directed by U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi this week to pursue the death penalty against Luigi Mangione, the man accused of murdering United Healthcare CEO Brian Thompson last year in New York City.\n\nMangione allegedly shot Thompson as the executive was headed to a health care conference on Dec. 4, killing the father of two on the street. The 26-year-old faces federal murder and stalking charges and 11 state charges, including murder and terrorism charges, which are not eligible for the death penalty.\n\n\"After careful consideration, I have directed federal prosecutors to seek the death penalty in this case as we carry out President Trump's agenda to stop violent crime and Make America Safe Again,\" Bondi said in a statement Tuesday.\n\nLuigi Mangione appears at a hearing for the murder of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson at Manhattan Criminal Court on Feb. 21, 2025 in New York City. Getty Images\n\nMr. Trump signed an executive order on his first day in office directing the Department of Justice to seek the death penalty where applicable.\n\n\"This move is one in a series of moves for the Trump administration to 'restore' the federal death penalty,\" said Corinna Barrett Lain, death penalty expert and a law professor at the University of Richmond School of Law.\n\nThe Mangione case is the first high-profile one to come under his administration's directive, Lain said; however, the federal death row landscape has changed dramatically since Mr. Trump's first term — and the appetite for executions nationwide has plummeted. In 2024, there were 26 new death sentences; in 2004, there were 125, she said.\n\nNew York State, where Mangione is charged, abolished the death penalty in 2007, according to the Death Penalty Information Center, a not-for-profit organization based in D.C. According to their tracking, although there were prisoners on New York's death row in 2007, an execution hasn't taken place there since Eddie Mays in 1963.\n\nFederal prosecutors might find themselves in the same situation with Mangione, Lain said, who has written a book on lethal injection, as it can take a federal death penalty case at least two decades to wind its way through the legal system.\n\nWhat is the federal death penalty?\n\nThe federal death penalty is in all 50 states and U.S. ter­ri­to­ries but is used rel­a­tive­ly rarely compared to the use of capital punishment by states. How it is applied is decided by a policy the U.S. Department of Justice has written in its justice manual, Robin Maher, executive director of the Death Information Policy Center, told CBS News.\n\nThe manual details how — or why — federal prosecutors decide to seek a federal death sentence, said Maher.\n\n\"It's not clear that that process has been followed with respect to this decision to seek death for Mr. Mangione,\" Maher said.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Justice said the death penalty can only be imposed on defendants convicted of capital offenses, such as murder, treason, genocide, or the killing or kidnapping of a congressman, the president, or a Supreme Court justice. Mr. Trump expanded the scope in his January executive order, saying federal prosecutors will seek the death penalty \"for the most serious, readily provable offenses.\"\n\nEach case is autho­rized by the Department of Justice headquarters in Washington, D.C., in con­sul­ta­tion with local U.S. Attorney offices, who prosecute the cases.\n\nWhat is a federal execution?\n\nA num­ber of fed­er­al death sen­tences were pros­e­cut­ed in states that have abol­ished the death penal­ty, the Death Information Policy Center said. Inmates who have received a federal death sentence are executed at the fed­er­al death cham­ber in the U.S. Penitentiary Terre Haute in Indiana.\n\nMost federal executions are carried out by lethal injection — until 2020, it was the sole method of execution. Methods were then expanded to include ones autho­rized by the state in which the fed­er­al death sen­tence was imposed. In some cases this could be by firing squad, such as the recent execution in South Carolina, or by nitrogen gas, which was used in Alabama and Louisiana.\n\nBetween the rein­state­ment of the fed­er­al death penal­ty in 1988 and 2024, 80 federal defen­dants were sen­tenced to death and 16 were exe­cut­ed.\n\nUnder the first Trump administration, 13 people were executed over 6 months in 2020-2021, DPI confirmed to CBS News.\n\nWho is on federal death row?\n\nFed­er­al death row pris­on­ers from all over the coun­try are housed in the Special Confinement Unit at U.S. Penitentiary Terre Haute in Indiana.\n\nMany death row inmates die from old age, Lain said, and many are never executed. Cases can take at least a decade to wind through court and millions of dollars to judge, \"is this a life worth saving?\" said Lain, who said each death row case has two trials, one for the crime and the other for sentencing. In effect, criminals are being sentenced to \"life without parole with a random chance of execution,\" and the government is paying millions for the prosecution, she said.\n\nThere are three prisoners currently on federal death row: Roberts Bowers, who was convicted in 2023 for the mass shoot­ing at Tree of Life Synagogue; Dylann Roof, who was convicted in 2017 for the fatal shoot­ing of nine parish­ioners in a Black church in Charleston, South Carolina; and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev for the 2015 Boston Marathon bomb­ing.\n\nThen-U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland put a moratorium on federal executions in place shortly after taking office so that an internal DOJ review of execution policies and practices could take place, Maher said. That moratorium on executions was in place until the end of the Biden administration.\n\nFormer President Joe Biden com­mut­ed the death sen­tences of 37 out of 40 fed­er­al death row pris­on­ers to sen­tences of life without parole on Dec. 23, 2024, before he left office.",

        "source": "https://www.cbsnews.com/",
        "content": "President Trump announced two new types of tariffs on April 2, or what he's calling \"Liberation Day,\" aimed at erasing trade deficits between the U.S. and its trading partners.\n\nThe two new tariffs are:\n\nA 10% universal import duty on all goods brought into the U.S.\n\nSo-called reciprocal tariffs\n\nMr. Trump, who announced the tariffs in the White House's Rose Garden on Wednesday afternoon, said his plans reflect \"one of the most important days in American history; it's our declaration of economic independence.\" Even so, economists say the tariffs will boost prices on many products purchased by American consumers, at a time when inflation still remains elevated.\n\nAn overview of Mr. Trump's new \"Liberation Day\" tariffs\n\nThe first tariff will be a 10% across-the-board tax applied to all imports to the U.S.\n\nThe second tariff, reciprocal tariffs, will be applied to imports from 60 countries and are aimed at equalizing the trade imbalances between the U.S. and those nations. Mr. Trump said that reciprocal tariffs \"means they do it to us, and we do it to them.\"\n\nHe added, \"It can't get any simpler than that.\"\n\nOne example provided by Mr. Trump is that the U.S. charges a 2.5% tariff on automobile imports, while adding that the European Union charges a 10% tariff on American car exports to EU nations.\n\n\"Such horrendous imbalances have devastated our industrial base,\" he added.\n\nWhat is a reciprocal tariff?\n\nAt the moment, the U.S. and its trading partners charge each other different levies on the same products. Germany, for instance, puts higher tariffs on vehicles made in the U.S. than what Washington, D.C., charges on German vehicle imports.\n\nTruly reciprocal tariffs would apply the same tax on U.S. imports that other countries place on American exports on a product-by-product basis. By charging countries only 50% of what they charge U.S. products, Mr. Trump said he is imposing \"kind reciprocal\" tariffs.\n\nMr. Trump said that the reciprocal tariffs will also include calculations to cover non-monetary trade barriers, such as when nations devalue their currencies to help boost demand for their products from other nations.\n\nWhen do the tariffs go into effect?\n\nThe baseline 10% tariff will go into effect at 12:01 a.m. on April 5, while the reciprocal rates will become effective at 12:01 a.m. on April 9.\n\nWhy is Trump imposing these new tariffs?\n\nDuring his announcement, Mr. Trump said the goal was to revitalize the industrial and manufacturing base of the U.S., promising that doing so will \"make America wealthy again.\"\n\nMr. Trump said the tariffs will help convince foreign businesses to relocate their factories to the U.S. The president also promised that the tariffs would lead to lower prices for Americans, although most economists are projecting that Mr. Trump's tariffs are likely to boost inflation and lead to higher costs for the typical U.S. household.\n\nFor instance, the core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index — an inflation measure closely tracked by the Federal Reserve — could rise 0.5 percentage points to 3.5% by year end, according to a March 30 Goldman Sachs report. The core PCE rose 2.8% in February on an annual basis, reflecting a slight increase from the prior month.\n\nThat estimate is based on Mr. Trump's previously announced tariffs, including his 25% import duty on auto imports, as well as Goldman's expectation for reciprocal tariffs that would average about 15%.",

        "content": "A mother and her three children were detained last month in an immigration operation in northern New York state near the U.S.-Canada border, according to an immigrant advocacy group. New York Gov. Kathy Hochul said the operation was \"just plain cruel\" and called on the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency to return the family to the state.\n\nThe operation and outcry from officials come as the Trump administration carries out its controversial immigration crackdown throughout the country.\n\nFederal agents carried out the New York operation last Thursday at a dairy farm in the town of Hounsfield, according to CBS affiliate WWNY-TV. The Department of Homeland Security told the news station ICE and other federal law enforcement agencies had started conducting operations in parts of New York to enforce immigration law on March 24. WWNY-TV reported eight people were detained at the farm, according to officials.\n\nAn immigrant advocacy group, the New York Immigration Coalition, said the mother and her children were detained in the operation and sent to a detention facility in Texas. The group didn't identify the mother or her children, but its leader said their case had been working its way through the U.S. immigration system.\n\n\"We are supposed to live in a nation of laws, but while this family was correctly navigating the immigration system and attending their immigration court hearings, they were instead taken by ICE agents and sent thousands of miles away from their home and community,\" Murad Awawdeh, the coalition's president and CEO, said in a statement Sunday.\n\nICE didn't immediately respond to CBS News' request for comment on the operation.\n\nWhile Hochul said that she supports working with the federal government to deport violent criminals who pose a threat, she called for the family to be returned to New York.\n\nNew York Gov. Kathy Hochul speaks during a news conference on congestion pricing in New York City on March 21, 2025.

It's just plain cruel. I want this family returned to New York State and believe ICE needs to immediately answer for these actions.\"\n\nHochul's statement followed outcry from local officials who also want the family back.\n\n\"These kids are, they're classmates, they're good friends, they are wonderful students, and they are part of the fabric of our school community,\" Jennifer Gaffney, superintendent of the Sackets Harbor Central School District, told WWNY-TV in an interview broadcast Monday, \"and they need to be returned to their classrooms.\"",

        "source": "https://www.cbsnews.com/",
        "content": "The American children of a British couple held captive by Afghanistan's ruling Taliban regime appealed Wednesday to President Trump in a video, asking for his help in securing their release.\n\nBritons Peter and Barbie Reynolds, both in their 70s, were detained by the Taliban on Feb. 1 this year alongside their American friend, Faye Hall, and their Afghan interpreter, as they traveled to the British couple's home in Afghanistan's central Bamiyan province, the Reynolds family told CBS News.\n\nFaye Hall, an American citizen, was released last Saturday into the custody of Qatari officials who helped broker her release and return to the U.S., just as the Reynolds family marked eight weeks of their parents being in Taliban captivity.\n\nSuhail Shaheen, the Taliban's ambassador in Qatar, told CBS News that Hall was released as a \"goodwill gesture\" and that they \"want to have positive relations with (the) U.S. and other countries.\"\n\nPeter and Barbie Reynolds have lived in Afghanistan for 18 years, where they run a registered organization that provides teacher training to local schools and education reform that integrates Islamic values, their family told CBS News. They have Afghan passports that allow them to travel freely in and out of the country, and their work is known and supported by local Afghan elders and police, the family said.\n\nAfter the Taliban's return to power in 2021, the Reynolds were invited to present their work to senior leaders, and Barbie was awarded a Certificate of Appreciation, believed to be the first such award ever given to a woman by the Taliban, the family said.\n\n\"We are overjoyed that Faye Hall has been released after eight weeks in an Afghan prison. She endured an unimaginable ordeal. We are in close contact with her and deeply grateful she's safe,\" the Reynolds' children said.\n\nBut their parents continue to be held without being charged. \"Each week, they are promised a court date that never materializes,\" the family said.\n\n\"Our father's health is rapidly deteriorating. He's run out of vital medication,\" the family also said. \"Our mother is also weak and desperately in need of iron supplements. Their physical condition is worsening by the day.\"\n\nIn a video filmed by the family outside the White House on Wednesday, the Reynolds' American son, Jonathan, with his daughter Annabelle by his side, appealed to President Trump. \"We are continuously told that (our parents) have done nothing wrong, they have committed no crime, and they will be released shortly. But still they remain in jail. Last week, you were somehow able to get Faye Hall out,\" Jonathan states in the video, addressing Mr. Trump directly.\n\n\"We have been told by the British government that they're doing everything they can to see my parents released. Yet—as a (Briton) by birth, American by choice—I'm standing here appealing to you to help get my parents out of that jail. I love this country. I've lived here for 26 years, and I'm standing here with my youngest daughter and the youngest grandchild of Peter and Barbie Reynolds. They have 13 American citizen grandkids, great grandkids and children, and we are appealing to you to do everything that you can to get them out of that jail and out of their country,\" Jonathan also said in the video.\n\n\"Please get my grandparents out. I just want to see them again, please. I know you can, and I really want you to. Please,\" Anabelle said in the video.\n\n\"My whole family—13 American citizens—are appealing to you, Mr. Trump, as one leader that we believe can actually do this,\" Jonathan said at the end of the video.\n\nPeter and Barbie have four children, 17 grandchildren and 3 great grandchildren, of whom two sons, 13 grandchildren and one great grandchild are American citizens, their daughter Susie Romer told CBS News. Their sons, including Jonathan, live in Chicago, and Susie, who is a green card holder, lives in California.\n\nFriends detained together\n\nPeter and Barbie Reynolds were detained by Taliban authorities along with Faye Hall in Bamiyan province, central Afghanistan on Feb. 1.\n\nHall, an American citizen from California and friend of the Reynolds, had traveled to Afghanistan to visit the couple and help them with their humanitarian work, according to the Reynolds family.\n\nJust one day after Hall arrived in the country, the three traveled from Kabul to central Bamiyan province, where the Reynolds' Afghan home is located, and were arrested along with their Afghan interpreter.\n\nAfter eight weeks of imprisonment, Barbie Reynolds and Faye Hall were summoned by Taliban authorities to the gate of their prison compound last Thursday, according to the Reynolds family, who have been granted permission by the Taliban to speak with their parents by phone. Both women then insisted that all four detainees should be released together, but the Taliban authorities forcibly separated Hall from Barbie Reynolds and took her away. The Reynolds family told CBS News that Hall had again pleaded for the release of the other three, but was told by Taliban authorities, \"We are only dealing with you.\" Hall was then released to Qatari officials shortly after.\n\nPeter and Barbie are still being held in separate wings of the same Kabul prison, in \"harsh and degrading conditions\", the Reynolds family said, with no consular access or legal representation. The U.S. and U.K. suspended embassy operations in Kabul when the capital fell to the Taliban in August 2021. The Taliban have repeatedly denied written requests by Peter and Barbie to see each other, the family said.\n\nThe family has told CBS News that the Taliban had given prior assurances that the case of all four detainees would be resolved as a group. The family also told CBS News that they're not aware of any coordination by both the U.K. and U.S. governments towards trying to get all three hostages out at once prior to Faye Hall's release.\n\nA U.K. Foreign and Commonwealth Office Spokesperson said in a statement, \"We are supporting the family of two British nationals who are detained in Afghanistan.\" A U.K. official also told CBS News, \"We do not comment on specific cases. Our travel advice is clear that individuals should not travel to Afghanistan. There is a heightened risk of British nationals being detained and the Government's ability to help those in need of consular support is extremely limited\".\n\nOn Hall's release, the State Department said in a statement, Monday, \"We extend our sincere gratitude to the Government of Qatar for its support of American citizens in need and we thank the European Union delegation in Kabul for their assistance.\"\n\nTrump's former special envoy for Afghanistan, Zalmay Khalilzad, confirmed Hall's release via a post on X on Saturday. Khalilzad accompanied Adam Boehler, whom the White House has told CBS News is a \"special government employee for hostage negotiations\", to meet Taliban authorities in Kabul last month. The visit was the first by U.S. officials since the 2021 Taliban takeover. American George Glezmann was released after that visit, in what Trump's former envoy for Afghanistan also described as a \"goodwill\" gesture by the Taliban.\n\nPresident Trump intends to withdraw his nomination of Adam Boehler for the official State Department role of Special Envoy for Hostage Affairs, two sources told CBS News last month, so that Boehler can avoid divesting from his own business interests. \"Adam Boehler will continue to serve President Trump as a special government employee focused on hostage negotiations,\" White House Deputy Press Secretary Anna Kelly told CBS News.\n\nThe Taliban have arbitrarily detained many U.S., British and other Western nationals in the past three years in what appears to be a deliberate effort to use them to secure concessions from the West.\n\nIn January, Americans Ryan Corbett and William Wallace McKenty were freed in a prisoner exchange between the U.S. and the Taliban, for Khan Mohammed, an Afghan serving a life sentence in a federal prison in California.\n\n, and contributed to this report.",

Multiple sources confirmed to CBS News that the Treasury Department temporarily lifted sanctions so that the State Department could issue the necessary visa for him to travel here.\n\nWitkoff, initially appointed as Trump's envoy to the Middle East, has emerged as a key negotiator in the new administration. He previously met with Dmitriev as well as other high-level Russian officials in Riyadh in February for a round of ceasefire talks, three years after the Russian invasion of Ukraine.\n\nWitkoff also traveled to Russia in February, which resulted in the release of American Marc Fogel.\n\nWitkoff told Margaret Brennan on \"Face the Nation\" on Feb. 23, shortly after that trip, that he spent over three hours with Russian President Vladimir Putin in what he described as a \"great discussion.\"\n\nAfter Witkoff's meeting in Moscow, Reuters reported that Dmitriev, who is the head of Russia's sovereign wealth fund, said the Russians expect a number of American companies to return to Russia this year. Witkoff told Brennan that he did not have that specific discussion with Putin, but \"obviously there would be an expectation that if we get to a peace deal, that you would be able to have American companies come back and do business there.\"\n\nWednesday's meeting between Witkoff and Dmitriev comes just days after Mr. Trump told NBC News he was \"very angry\" and \"pissed off\" at Putin for comments he made suggesting Ukrainian President Zelesnkyy was not a legitimate leader. \"I was pissed off about it. But if a deal isn't made, and if I think it was Russia's fault, I'm going to put secondary sanctions on Russia,\" Mr. Trump said.",

        "source": "https://www.cbsnews.com/",
        "content": "Your home equity loan interest rate could rise or fall until it's formally locked in. Getty Images\n\nBorrowing from your home equity with a home equity loan can be a cost-effective financial move in most economic climates. But in the economy of April 2025, it's one of the rare ones available. Thanks to an extended fight against inflation and an elevated federal funds rate, among other factors, interest rates on popular options like personal loans and credit cards are now in the double digits. Credit cards, in particular, have average interest rates of around 23% right now. Not only is that a record high, but it's about three times the cost of a home equity loan, with an average rate of 8.37% as of April 2.\n\nAnd home equity loan interest rates have been declining, both in 2025 and for much of 2024. Understanding this dynamic, then, and with the knowledge that the average home equity amount is high now, many prospective borrowers may be wondering about their home equity loan options. The benefits here are two-fold: a high amount of equity to borrow from and a low, fixed-interest rate that the home equity loan comes with. But can that rate change after you've been approved for the loan?\n\nThat's an important question homeowners may want to consider, especially if they're trying to take advantage of a temporary drop in rates. Below, we'll detail what to know now.\n\nSee what home equity loan rate you'd currently qualify for here.\n\nCan your home equity loan interest rate change after approval?\n\nIn short, yes, your home equity loan interest rate can change after you are approved for the loan. If you didn't lock in your rate upon approval, it can change and likely will until it's locked in with the lender. That said, this may not always be detrimental. If the home equity loan rate climate has cooled since your approval (rates change often), it could actually prove to be beneficial, as the rate you ultimately lock-in will be lower than the one you first secured. At the same time, if rates ticked up during that time, your home equity loan rate likely will, too. Similarly, if your credit score or borrowing profile changed, then the rate could change in reply. Fortunately, there are multiple ways in which you can avoid having your home equity loan rate change after approval:\n\nLock it in: Got approved for a home equity loan at a rate you feel is affordable? Then consider locking it in right away, before the interest rate climate has a chance to impact it one way or the other.\n\nKeep your credit score high: The home equity loan rate you secure with a high credit score won't be the one you're offered with a lower one, even if the rate drop isn't substantial. So be sure to keep your credit health in check, both during the home equity loan approval process and over the full repayment period.\n\nBe ready to act: Requests for documentation or additional information from lenders can slow the process between approval and home equity loan closing. That delay could result in a change to the home equity loan rate you were initially approved for, so be prepared to respond to requests for information and documentation promptly to avoid this scenario.\n\nStart exploring your home equity loan options online now.\n\nDon't forget about HELOCs\n\nWhile a continuously changing interest rate may seem risky, it could be a benefit if you pursue a home equity line of credit (HELOC) instead of a home equity loan now. That's because HELOCs have variable interest rates likely to change monthly for borrowers. And that's a major advantage now that HELOC rates have declined by almost two full percentage points since September 2024 and could fall further this April and spring. So, if you're comfortable paying a different rate and amount each month, now could be a smart time to explore your HELOC options or, at a minimum, to compare them to what's available with fixed-rate home equity loan offers.\n\nThe bottom line\n\nA home equity loan interest rate can and likely will change in the time between being approved for the loan and closing on it, unless you lock it in. So consider locking it right away. You could always explore unlocking and relocking a new, lower rate before closing if your lender allows it. And look into HELOCs as a viable alternative now, too. HELOC rates are more than 25 basis points cheaper than home equity loans at the start of April 2025 and they are poised to drop further soon.\n\nEven if your home equity loan rate falls after you've closed on it, you'll still need to refinance (and pay refinancing closing costs), to lock in that lower rate. Finally, no matter which option you choose, be sure to only borrow an amount of equity that you can comfortably afford to pay back. With your home functioning as collateral in these exchanges, it could be repossessed if you're unable to make repayments as agreed to.",

The pair team previously interviewed with CBS Colorado as they prepared in Colorado Springs for the March's world competition.\n\nIn accordance with competition regulations after O'Shea's injury, the team says they notified U.S. Figure Skating about the injury. The team says backup plans involving alternates were made and O'Shea underwent 24 hours of intensive medical care including \"a numbing injection, which is used in other professional sports like football, for athletes with similar injuries,\" Meeks said.\n\nTwo days after the injury, O'Shea skated a full final training program and was cleared by USFS to skate. O'Shea says the team did not yet know the extent of his injuries.\n\nThe intensive ice and compression routine alongside numbing injections continued throughout Oshea's time at the competition in Boston to manage swelling and pain.\n\n\"His biggest motivation was to help Team USA secure three spots at next year's world championship, and give the team the chance to earn a third spot for the Olympic Games. And despite the immense amount of pain he was in, and the emotional and psychological trauma this situation caused to both him and Ellie, somehow they were able to perform to a seventh best place in the world,\" Meekins said.\n\nThe pair team's 7th place finish, alongside other strong performing U.S. athletes, earned Team USA a third Olympic spot for the upcoming games. Experts in the field say it's an opportunity Team USA has not in decades.\n\nOnce the competition ended, O'Shea went to a hospital in Boston to be evaluated. Meeks says formal imaging of Danny's foot showed a bad break of his fifth metatarsal.\n\nO'Shea underwent surgery on Wednesday at the Colorado Center of Orthopedic Excellence.

        "source": "https://www.cnn.com/",
        "content": "CNN —\n\nThe liberal prevailed in a technically nonpartisan Wisconsin State Supreme Court race that took on national importance as a proxy fight between Democrats and Republicans supporting President Donald Trump.\n\nTurnout in the race was remarkable for an off-year election in which state supreme court judge was the highest ranking office on the ballot — an indication that Americans remain deeply engaged in the electoral process.\n\nThere were 1.8 million votes cast in the state’s last supreme court race in 2023. More than 2.3 million people voted in Tuesday’s contest. Compared with that 2023 race, turnout is higher in every single county.\n\nWhile that turnout was still low compared to a presidential election (more than 3.4 million people voted in Wisconsin last year) it was much closer to the roughly 2.7 million people who voted for governor in the 2018 and 2022 midterms.\n\nThe win by Susan Crawford maintains a liberal majority on Wisconsin’s highest court as they gear up to decide issues ranging from whether the state should adhere to an 1849 abortion law, whether it should redraw congressional maps that favor Republicans and whether Tesla should be able to sell vehicles from its own showrooms.\n\nBut the race is also being viewed as a temperature check for the policies of Trump and his chief ally in downsizing government, Elon Musk, who poured tens of millions of dollars into supporting conservative Brad Schimel.\n\nCrawford got 55% of the vote compared to Schimel’s 45%, a solid victory for the liberal Tuesday night.\n\nComparing a presidential election to a state supreme court race is a fraught and complicated exercise, but there are some interesting contrasts to make.\n\nThe liberal judge won in 10 counties carried by Trump last November, which will please Democrats looking to this race for hope. It also continues a trend in American politics, where Democrats, motivated by their opposition to Trump, perform better in lower turnout races outside of the general election.\n\nAmong the Trump counties that turned to Crawford is Brown County, a population center which includes Green Bay, although Brown County was also won by the liberal in the 2023 race, Justice Janet Protasiewicz. Musk campaigned in Brown County, wearing a cheesehead hat and handing out $1 million checks in a test of election law.\n\nCrawford actually under-performed Protasiewicz in all but two of the counties she won, but crucially overperformed both former Vice President Kamala Harris and Protasiewicz in Milwaukee, Wisconsin’s most-populated county. Turnout in Milwaukee County increased from 45% to 55% of registered voters since the last 2023 court race, a 10-point jump.\n\nRacine County, south of Milwaukee, is the only county that went for the conservative in 2023 and Trump in 2024, but switched to the liberal Tuesday.\n\nFor Trump supporters looking for a silver lining, Schimel, the conservative, won in five counties — Dunn, Grant, Jackson, Lafayette and Pierce — carried by the liberal in the 2023 state supreme court race, although Trump also won those counties in the presidential race.\n\nMore voters took part in Tuesday’s contest than the state supreme court contest two years ago. Turnout was nearly 70% in the Democratic stronghold of Dane County — an improvement over the county’s 62% turnout in 2023.\n\nTurnout approached two-thirds in Washington County and approached 70% in Waukesha and Ozaukee counties. All are hotly contested vote centers around Milwaukee.\n\nTurnout appeared to increase the most in the Northwestern part of the state, where Schimel made inroads in counties won by Trump, but not nearly enough to win Tuesday’s race.",

        "title": "Fact check: Trump’s false claims about tariffs and trade",
        "source": "https://www.cnn.com/",
        "content": "CNN —\n\nPresident Donald Trump made a series of false claims about tariffs and trade – most of which he has made before – in the Wednesday speech in which he announced a sweeping set of global tariffs.\n\nHere is a fact check of some of Trump’s remarks.\n\nCanada’s dairy tariffs\n\nTrump correctly noted that Canada has tariffs exceeding 250% on some US dairy products. However, he falsely claimed that merely “the first little carton of milk” exported to Canada faces a “very low price,” but “then it gets up to 275, 300%.”\n\nIn reality, Canada has guaranteed that tens of thousands of metric tons of imported US milk per year, not merely a single carton, will face zero tariffs at all; Canada conceded a certain guaranteed level of tariff-free US access to its dairy market as part of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) that Trump’s own first administration negotiated.\n\nTrump also didn’t mention something the US dairy industry acknowledges: The US is not hitting its zero-tariff maximum level of exports to Canada in any category of dairy product, so the Canadian tariffs aren’t being applied; with regard to milk in particular, the US isn’t even at half of the tariff-free quota. (There is a vigorous US-Canada debate about why the US is so far from the maximum, with each country blaming the other. Regardless of who’s right, the tariffs aren’t hitting US milk.)\n\nTrump has persistently omitted key facts about Canada’s dairy tariffs. You can read more here from a previous CNN fact check.\n\nUS trade deficit with Canada\n\nTrump, claiming “we subsidize a lot of countries,” falsely said “it’s close to $200 billion a year” with Canada. Trump has repeatedly used this $200 billion figure to describe the US trade deficit with Canada in particular, which is actually far lower than $200 billion; official US statistics show the 2024 deficit with Canada in goods and services trade was $35.7 billion and $70.6 billion in goods trade alone.\n\nTrump didn’t mention the trade deficit in particular this time, but even if he was intending to use the word “subsidize” more broadly, there is no basis for the claim.\n\nWho pays tariffs\n\nTrump repeated his frequent false claim that, because of the tariffs he imposed on China during his first term, the US “took in hundreds of billions of dollars” that “they paid.” In fact, US importers, not foreign exporters like China, make the tariff payments, and study after study has found that Americans bore the overwhelming majority of the cost of Trump’s first-term tariffs on China; it’s easy to find specific examples of companies that passed along the cost of the tariffs to US consumers.\n\nPrevious presidents’ tariffs on China\n\nTrump also repeated his frequent false claim that, before his first presidency, China “never paid 10 cents to any other president” from tariffs. Aside from the fact that US importers make the tariff payments, the US was actually generating billions per year in revenue from tariffs on Chinese imports before Trump took office; in fact, the US has had tariffs on Chinese imports since 1789. Trump’s predecessor, President Barack Obama, imposed additional tariffs on Chinese goods.\n\nUS wealth\n\nTouting the supposed benefits of tariffs, Trump claimed that “the United States was proportionately the wealthiest it has ever been” from 1789 to 1913, when tariffs made up a higher percentage of federal revenue before the passage of a 1913 law reestablishing the federal income tax.\n\nTrump didn’t explain what he meant by “proportionately the wealthiest,” but by standard measures, the US is far wealthier today than it was in the early 20th century and prior. Per capita gross domestic product is now many times higher than it was then.\n\nDouglas Irwin, a Dartmouth College economics professor who studies the history of US trade policy, said in February after Trump had made similar claims, that if Trump’s unclear comments are interpreted to be about per capita income, as “economists usually take this,” it is “obviously not true,” since “real per capita income and standards of living are so much higher today than the past. … It is nice to have indoor plumbing, running water, not outhouses, etc.”\n\nIrwin noted then that it’s possible Trump had been referring to how the federal government after the Civil War “ran consistent budget surpluses and almost paid off the national debt,” since “he seems to view the government taking in more money than it is spending as making the country rich.” Irwin added, though, that “big fiscal surpluses don’t make a country rich, per se.”\n\nInflation under Biden and Trump\n\nTrump falsely claimed that, during Joe Biden’s presidency, the US had “the highest” inflation “in the history of our country.” Trump could have fairly said that the year-over-year US inflation rate hit a 40-year high in June 2022, when it was 9.1%, but that was not close to the all-time record of 23.7%, set in 1920. (And the rate then plummeted. Inflation in the last full month of the Biden administration, December 2024, was 2.9%; it was 3% in January 2025, a month partly under Biden and partly under Trump.)\n\nTrump also claimed that there was “virtually no inflation” during his first presidency. He gave himself some wiggle room with the word “virtually,” but it’s worth noting that there was inflation during his first four years in office; prices rose about 8% from the beginning of that presidency to the end. Year-over-year inflation was 1.4% in the month he left office, January 2021.\n\nGas prices\n\nTrump, claiming he has brought prices “way down” since taking office again in late January, said that “gasoline is way under $3.” That is true in some parts of the country, but the national average for regular gasoline on the day he spoke was about $3.24 per gallon, according to data published by AAA – higher than on Trump’s inauguration day, when the AAA national average was about $3.12.\n\nThat’s not to say Trump is responsible for the increase; presidents have a limited impact on gas prices, and there was a larger increase over the equivalent period last year. But the national average has not fallen during this presidency to date.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional details.",

        "content": "CNN —\n\nVal Kilmer, a movie star who throughout his career proved he was up for any task, from playing a cocky naval pilot to wearing the Batman suit, died on Tuesday, according to his daughter Mercedes Kilmer, who released a statement to the New York Times and the Associated Press. He was 65.\n\nThe cause of death was pneumonia, Mercedes Kilmer told the media outlets.\n\nCNN has reached out to representatives for Kilmer and his family for comment.\n\nKilmer had recovered from a 2014 throat cancer diagnosis that required tracheotomy surgery that altered his voice.\n\nIn recent years, Kilmer largely stepped away from acting, but made a brief return to the craft in “Top Gun: Maverick,” the sequel to the original film that launched him and that cast into superstardom.\n\nThe sequel, which released in 2022 after a two-year delay, deftly blended Kilmer’s off-screen health issues into the film’s story, with his Tom “Iceman” Kazansky, the smug but cool rival to Tom Cruise’s Pete “Maverick” Mitchell, ultimately succumbing to an ailment in the film.\n\nAs one of Kilmer’s last film roles, it concluded one of the most interesting — and bankable — careers in Hollywood history.\n\n(From left) Val Kilmer and Tom Cruise in 'Top Gun.' Sunset Boulevard/Corbis Historical/Getty Images\n\nAn impressive career\n\nBorn and raised in California’s San Fernando Valley, Kilmer studied at the Hollywood Professional School before heading to New York where, at 21, he became the youngest student at the time to be accepted into Julliard School’s drama department.\n\nHe began his film career in the 1984 comedy “Top Secret!” and acted in several movies throughout the ‘80s including his breakout role in 1986’s “Top Gun.”\n\nThen came an incredible streak of successful genre-spanning movies in the 1990s: A superhero film (with 1995’s “Batman Forever,” in which he played the Dark Knight), a Western (1993’s “Tombstone,” where he played Doc Holliday), a biopic (1991’s “The Doors,” in which he portrayed Jim Morrison) and a crime film (Michael Mann’s 1995 masterpiece “Heat”).\n\nOne of his less lucrative pursuits included his one-man stage show “Citizen Twain,” about Mark Twain, whose work he deeply admired and referenced frequently in interviews.\n\nIn all, Kilmer’s films made nearly $2 billion at the global box office, according to Comscore.\n\nVal Kilmer in 'Val.' A24/Courtesy Amazon Studios\n\nThroughout his career, the roles that Kilmer played possessed an iconic quality while underscoring the way his career frequently zigged at the point where it could have zagged, to his detriment if not in terms of the quality of the work but how Hollywood and the public perceived him.\n\nKilmer enthusiastically agreed to star as Batman, for example, but quickly soured on that experience, passing on another sequel in favor of the forgettable reboot “The Saint.”\n\nSimilarly, he took a role in “The Island of Dr. Moreau” in order to play opposite Marlon Brando, only to clash with director John Frankenheimer (exchanges caught on camera) and be disappointed when a detached Brando periodically refused to come to the set, letting a stand-in take his place.\n\nHe reflected on his career and life in the 2021 documentary “Val” through interactions he had videotaped with his family and on film sets for years, including behind-the-scenes footage from “Tombstone” and the “Top Gun” cast partying after hours (“We were all at the start of our careers,” Kilmer recalled).\n\nAt the time, Kilmer was recovering from throat-cancer surgery, so his son, Jack, read the actor’s written narration — sounding uncannily like his father.\n\nKilmer frequently expressed about his desire to work with certain directors, showing audition videos that he shot for parts he failed to land in “Goodfellas” and “Full Metal Jacket,” seeking to impress directors Martin Scorsese and Stanley Kubrick, respectively. He also documented his laborious auditioning and preparation process for portraying Jim Morrison in “The Doors.”\n\nUltimately, in the documentary, he expressed excitement about all that would come next.\n\n“I have behaved bizarrely to some. I deny none of this and have no regrets because I have lost and found parts of myself that I never knew existed. I am blessed,” he said in the movie.\n\nActor Val Kilmer poses for a portrait in 2017.

Trump is set to announce today exactly what tariffs will be imposed and whether they will target entire sectors. Jim Watson/AFP/Getty Images\n\n“Who pays the tariffs imposed by the White House: the government of the foreign country? Or, American based businesses that buy goods and services from other countries?,” Ruth, from the Midwest asks.\n\nIn response your question, Ruth, it has been at times confusing identifying who has to pay the tariff.\n\nPresident Donald Trump and members of his administration have often shrugged off concerns about the additional cost tariffs present for US businesses, claiming foreign countries are the ones who pay for it. That’s not exactly true, though.\n\nDomestic businesses that import products into the country pay the tariffs up front, contrary to Trump’s claims that exporting nations foot the bill.\n\nThe actual transaction occurs at the 328 points of entry into the US designated by Customs and Border Protection to take in imports, including airports, railways, roads and ports.\n\nAt those ports of entry, CBP agents collect tariff revenue from the domestic businesses importing the products, which is calculated based on how the merchandise is classified and where it came from, said Ted Murphy, a lawyer at Sidley Austin who specializes in advising businesses on customs compliance issues told CNN in March.\n\nBut Trump isn’t entirely wrong in saying that other nations pay for tariffs levied on them, Murphy said. That’s because when businesses know they’ll have to spend more to import goods from one country versus another, they may decide it makes more financial sense to find a new supplier elsewhere or, in Trump’s ideal world, shift their production to the US.\n\nIn either case, the economy of the country whose goods are tariffed can suffer from the loss of revenue, potentially resulting in job losses.\n\nBut exporting nations often don’t just accept tariffs without fighting back.",

        "source": "https://www.cnn.com/",
        "content": "CNN —\n\nMore than 240 people on board the luxury Queen Mary 2 cruise ship have fallen ill with the highly contagious norovirus stomach bug.\n\nThe US Centers for Disease Control and Protection (CDC) reported the outbreak just as the Cunard cruise liner was nearing the end of a four-week-long return voyage from the UK to the Caribbean.\n\nQueen Mary 2 regularly sails transatlantic crossings. It’s a journey — and a ship — designed to hark back to the golden age of luxury ocean liners. Cunard is owned by Carnival Corporation\n\nThe vessel set sail on March 8 from Southampton and is due to return to the English port on April 6. During the voyage, 224 of the 2,538 passengers have fallen sick with the gastrointestinal virus, while 17 of the 1,232 crew members have also became unwell, according to CDC data.\n\n‘The cruise ship virus’\n\nInfectious disease expert Dr. William Schaffner, a professor at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, told CNN Travel earlier this year that norovirus is “known obviously as the cruise ship virus.”\n\nNorovirus is notoriously contagious, and therefore people in close quarters — such as a cruise ship — may be more likely to spread the disease.\n\nThe CDC also notes the virus’ spread among travelers in other similarly confined spaces such as camps, dormitories and hotels.\n\n“This is a virus that can infect you with very few viral particles. In other words, the infectious dose is very small,” said Schaffner. “It can persist for days or even a week on environmental surfaces, which means that if you put your fingers on a contaminated surface, you can pick up a few viral particles, touch your mouth and then initiate an infection.”\n\nPredominant symptoms on board the Queen Mary 2 are diarrhea and vomiting. The CDC said that Cunard Line increased cleaning and disinfection on board the ship following the recent confirmed outbreak. Infected passengers have also been quarantined from others on board and stools are being tested.\n\nThe CDC’s Vessel Sanitation Program (VSP) which keeps track of outbreaks at sea, also confirmed it’s “remotely monitoring the situation, including review of the ship’s outbreak response and sanitation procedures.”\n\nThe VSP also confirmed that Cunard Line had consulted with the program about cleaning procedures on Queen Mary 2, and reporting illness on board.\n\nCunard told CNN Travel that the cruise line is “continuing to closely monitor” guests with gastrointestinal symptoms.\n\nThe cruise line also highlighted the “comprehensive deep clean of the ship” and said its swift activation of health and safety protocols were proving to be effective, adding that “we are already seeing a reduction in reported cases.”\n\nA rise in illness at sea?\n\nThe outbreak comes on the heels of the worst year for cruise ship-based gastrointestinal outbreaks in over a decade, according to CDC data. The majority of these record-breaking 2024 gastrointestinal outbreaks at sea were norovirus-related.\n\nThe CDC reported a total of 16 gastrointestinal cruise outbreaks across 2024, the highest in over a decade, while in 2023, there were a total of 14 reported outbreaks.\n\nSpeaking to CNN Travel in January, a CDC spokesperson said that “while 2023 and 2024 both had higher numbers of cruise ship outbreaks than in years prior to the pandemic, we do not yet know if this represents a new trend.”\n\nThere were fewer reports in the 2020-2022 period, during which time the cruise industry shut down — and then slowly restarted — in the wake of the Coronavirus pandemic. Back in 2019, there were 10 reported outbreaks, according to CDC data.\n\n“Cruise ship travel during the Covid-19 pandemic was limited, and prior to that, we saw that the rates of gastrointestinal illness on cruise ships decreased (during 2006-2019),” said the CDC spokesperson.\n\nCDC data only covers ships under the agency’s jurisdiction — meaning the ship’s voyage must include a US port, a foreign itinerary and be carrying more than 13 passengers. While this criteria counts for a lot of the world’s cruise ship fleet, it doesn’t cover every vessel traversing the world’s oceans.\n\nIn a statement provided to CNN Travel in January, industry organization Cruise Lines International Association said: “Incidents of illness onboard cruise ships are extremely rare.”\n\nThe CDC also notes that “outbreaks are found and reported more quickly on a cruise ship than on land,” thanks to reporting protocols. On average, some 19-21 million instances of norovirus illness occur in the US every year, according to the CDC.\n\nSo far in 2025, the CDC has reported 11 outbreaks of gastrointestinal illness on board cruise ships, including the Queen Mary 2 infection. Of these instances, nine were caused by norovirus.\n\nStaying healthy on board\n\nThe norovirus-stricken Queen Mary 2 is currently finishing up a transatlantic crossing. Pictured here, the ship docked at Brooklyn Cruise Terminal back in December 2021. Andrew Kelly/Reuters/FILE\n\nCruise passengers who present stomach bug symptoms can help limit the spread of infection by “promptly reporting their illness if they are sick and following medical staff recommendations,” according to the CDC spokesperson who advised CNN Travel earlier this year.\n\nPassengers are also instructed to practice “washing their hands often, especially after using the toilet and before eating or drinking.”\n\nCruise ships also pride themselves on taking steps to control outbreaks, as Queen Mary 2 recently demonstrated. Measures include quarantining passengers and crew with symptoms, and increasing cleaning and disinfection of impacted vessels.\n\nStill, infectious disease expert Schaffner said that due to the supremely infectious nature of norovirus, “it is likely to go beyond all those barriers and interventions that have been put in place” by cruise lines.\n\nSchaffner’s advice to prospective cruise passengers is “number one, if you’re feeling at all ill, stay home, rebook for a later cruise.\n\n“Number two, pay meticulous attention to all the hygienic instructions that you are given on the cruise ship, and pay particular attention to hand hygiene. And in this circumstance, soap and water is actually better than using the sanitary hand wipes or lotions that we use, because norovirus is not very affected by the alcohol that’s in the hand wipes and the lotions.”",

        "title": "Wisconsin loss a warning sign for GOP about Musk’s campaign role",
        "source": "https://www.cnn.com/",
        "content": "CNN —\n\nTuesday’s decisive victory for the Democratic-backed candidate in the Wisconsin Supreme Court race offered a warning for Republicans that Elon Musk’s unfavorability with voters may outweigh the millions he’s pledged to spend for Republicans in next year’s midterms.\n\nMusk, the Tesla CEO who has become the face of the Department of Government Efficiency and President Donald Trump’s efforts to slash government spending, went all-in on the Wisconsin Supreme court race, spending more than $20 million and holding a rally in the state backing the conservative candidate last weekend.\n\nBut his efforts to boost conservative Brad Schimel — which, combined with liberal donors, made Tuesday’s contest the most expensive judicial contest in US history – did not prevent Schimel’s 10-point defeat to liberal Susan Crawford. She won with a campaign focused heavily on Musk’s involvement in the race, even referring to Musk as her “opponent,” rather than Schimel, in campaign rallies.\n\nTuesday’s results in Wisconsin and Florida, where Republicans won two House special elections but under-performed Trump’s 2024 numbers by double-digits, have fueled GOP concerns about this year’s New Jersey and Virginia governor races and next year’s midterms, and whether Musk’s DOGE chainsaw has become a drag on Trump’s – and the Republican – brand.\n\n“Musk was more of a motivator for the left than the right. At some point I felt bad for the candidate because his voice got smothered,” former Wisconsin GOP Rep. Reid Ribble told CNN, referring to Schimel.\n\nMusk’s DOGE cuts are hardly the only reason Republicans are apprehensive about future races. Historically, the president’s party does poorly in the lower-turnout midterm – Democrats took back the House in Trump’s first term, for instance – and voters have already made clear they’re concerned that Trump’s tariffs risk harming the economy and driving up prices. Democrats have also in the Trump era become the party of high-propensity voters, turning out in off-year and special elections more than Republicans do.\n\nBut Musk’s high-profile role in Trump’s government – and his outsized presence in the Wisconsin race – have made him an obvious foil for Democrats, a cause they can rally around even as they remain divided on how their party should move forward.\n\n“The Republicans are going to try to distance themselves now from Elon Musk. It’s not going to work. It’s too late. You’re attached at the hip, and you’re going to feel the consequences of it, just like you did in Wisconsin last night,” House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries told reporters on Wednesday.\n\nMusk’s midterm moves\n\nDespite the Wisconsin loss, Musk intends to remain engaged in next year’s midterm races to help Republicans retain their majority in the House and Senate, according to someone familiar with the Tesla CEO’s thinking.\n\nMusk doesn’t plan to cede contests to Democrats in the future, and nothing that happened Tuesday is deterring the world’s richest man from his plans to invest in politics, the person said.\n\nMusk always viewed the Wisconsin race as an uphill battle, but he decided to engage to force Democrats to spend more money than they otherwise would have – and in an attempt to energize Republicans, the source said.\n\nAs CNN and others have reported, Musk has previously committed to putting $100 million into political groups controlled by Trump. Musk spent nearly $300 million last year to help elect Trump and Republicans in Congress.\n\nInvestments by Musk and groups aligned with him in the Wisconsin race topped $20 million. He also thrust himself into the center of the contest — bounding on stage wearing a foam cheesehead hat at a rally Sunday in Green Bay to campaign on Schimel’s behalf and deliver $1 million checks to voters as part of an effort to drive turnout. Musk’s rally was in Brown County, a swing county that Trump won with 53% of the vote in November. Crawford flipped the county blue Tuesday night.\n\nDemocrat-backed Wisconsin Supreme Court candidate Judge Susan Crawford reacts after voters elected her to the state Supreme Court in Madison, Wisconsin, on Tuesday. Vincent Alban/Reuters\n\nMusk was circumspect about Tuesday’s election result, suggesting there was a moral victory even after telling his supporters at Sunday’s rally that winning the election was “important for the future of civilization.”\n\n“I expected to lose, but there is value to losing a piece for a positional gain,” Musk posted on X Wednesday.\n\nTrump says DOGE to end “at some point”\n\nAs the president held the first outdoor event of the year in the Rose Garden on Wednesday afternoon, where he announced his new tariff policy, Musk was not on hand for the marquee program. The absence was notable for a man who has been at the president’s side – or watching from a close distance – for most every major moment of the new Trump presidency. Trump touted Republican victories in two special Congressional elections in Florida on Tuesday, but did not say a word about the Wisconsin race.\n\nThe president not only blessed Musk’s outsized role in the Wisconsin election, his advisers told him Republicans may not be able to win without it because Trump voters have often only turned out in high numbers when the president’s name is actually on the ballot.\n\n“Sure, Musk fired up Democratic voters, no doubt about it,” a longtime Wisconsin GOP official who was in frequent touch with the White House during the campaign. “But he also reminded Trump voters the president needed them.”\n\nTrump, who did not campaign in Wisconsin ahead of the Supreme Court race there, was disappointed by the results but did not view them as a referendum on his first weeks in office, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nIn some ways, Musk assuming the more public role for Republicans in the state helped shield Trump from assuming as much of the blame as he ordinarily might — a fact that did not go unmentioned among some of Trump’s advisers the day after the race.\n\nThe president has no intention of distancing himself from Musk, a top Republican official who visited the West Wing on Wednesday said, with their relationship forever solidified by how he helped deliver a White House victory last fall.\n\nYet Trump this week suggested Musk’s time in the government could be limited. As a special government employee, Musk’s tenure would be limited to 130 days, and Trump said that “at some point,” his Department of Government Efficiency would end, and he’d return to run Tesla and SpaceX.\n\n“You know, at a certain point, I think it will end,” Trump said. “There’ll be a point at which the secretaries will be able to do this work and do it very, you know, as we say, with the scalpel, and that’s what we want.”\n\nWhile Trump continues to value Musk’s role within his administration, and holds respect for him personally, he hasn’t made any internal push for his most powerful adviser to remain past the 130-day window permitted for a special government employee, people familiar with the matter said.\n\nRepublicans welcome Musk’s cash\n\nOne congressional GOP operative who was closely studying the results in Wisconsin said it’s hard not to see the race as a “referendum on Elon,” pointing to months of polling that showed Musk performing poorly among swing voters. (A CNN/SSRS poll in early March found just 35% of Americans overall had a favorable view of Musk.)\n\nBut in the House, that’s not translating to worried members phoning GOP leadership about what Tuesday’s results mean for their districts — at least not yet, according to multiple GOP sources.\n\nSenior Republicans insist they’re not concerned about the impact on an election that’s almost 600 days away, and they believe that Trump’s team will take care of Musk before then if they see him as a risk to House or Senate races.\n\nCongressional Republicans themselves have no interest in trying to force out Musk while he remains one of Trump’s closest allies in Washington.\n\n“The two people you cannot criticize today in Republican politics are Donald Trump and Elon Musk,” according to a senior GOP operative who works on congressional races.\n\nAnd Musk’s pledge to donate $100 million for the upcoming midterms is a boon to the fundraising efforts the party needs to try to keep control of a razor-thin House.\n\n“From the Republican standpoint, there’s also a positive aspect to Musk – and that’s his money. His money is very green, and it can pay for a lot of messaging,” former GOP Pennsylvania Rep. Charlie Dent told CNN.\n\n“So Republicans have to weigh that,” Dent added. “He’s a double-edged sword.”\n\nAlex Conant, a veteran Republican strategist, cautioned against extrapolating too much from one special election.\n\n“I think the Democrats would love it if he turned off the spigot for Republican candidates,” Conant said of Musk. “And I think similarly, Republicans rail against some of the big Democratic donors. Ultimately those attacks aren’t very effective. I think this is just a little different because Musk is so high-profile doing controversial things with DOGE.”\n\nMixed views on DOGE cuts\n\nSome Hill Republicans have privately expressed concerns to their leadership about how the cuts Musk is making could impact their districts. But beyond the cuts DOGE is making – cuts that Republicans have generally backed – Musk has also generated headlines by demeaning federal workers and accusing Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona of being a “traitor” after he visited Ukraine.\n\n“I do think some of those statements are unnecessary,” said Nebraska Rep. Don Bacon, one of three Republicans who won congressional districts in November carried by former Vice President Kamala Harris. “Those things are not needed. They do not help us. … His job is to audit the federal government.”\n\nRepublican senators largely brushed off the potential negative impact of having Musk on the campaign trail when asked about Wisconsin’s Supreme Court election result on Wednesday\n\nSen. Josh Hawley, a Missouri Republican, said he would “leave that up to the candidate,” when asked by CNN’s Manu Raju if Musk should be a visible presence in future key races. But Hawley predicted that candidates will “clamor” to have Trump with them on the trail, “because the president turns out votes, we know that.”\n\nSen. John Kennedy of Louisiana told reporters Musk has a “right to his opinion,” and defended the Tesla CEO.\n\n“I’m glad he’s on my side. He’s a formidable advocate, and I’d like to see more people weigh in,” Kennedy said.\n\nCaroline Wren, a longtime Trump fundraiser and adviser, accused Musk’s opponents of trying to scapegoat him for the Wisconsin loss.\n\n“Republicans have consistently underperformed in special elections,” she said. “He came in to fix a problem but Republicans have bigger structural issues having to do with infrastructure and turnout. At the same time, yes, there are limitations to what you can do even with unlimited money.”\n\nHouse Democrats’ campaign arm quickly seized on Musk’s loss, targeting vulnerable Republicans like New York Rep. Mike Lawler – who got $1.7 million in campaign help from Musk’s PAC last cycle –– in attacks that offered an early preview of their 2026 message.\n\nWisconsin Democratic Party Chair Ben Wikler told CNN the results of the Supreme Court race send a message nationwide that the Republican Party will be tied to Musk even if he steps back from his government role.\n\n“If Elon Musk is going to keep getting involved in elections like this, then Republicans are going to reap the whirlwind,” Wikler said. “If he is pushed off center stage, then eventually probably the focus will come back to Donald Trump, who’s not very popular either.”\n\nThis story has been updated with additional reporting.\n\nCNN’s Kevin Liptak, Edward-Isaac Dovere, Arlette Saenz, Alison Main, Manu Raju, Morgan Rimmer, Haley Talbot, and Casey Riddle contributed to this report.",

        "content": "CNN —\n\nIn his 20 years working in pediatric infectious disease, Dr. John Schieffelin has never seen another illness like pertussis.\n\nAlso known as whooping cough, it’s a contagious respiratory illness that can develop into a painful, full-body cough. The coughing fits can be severe, often accompanied by a whooping sound when the person tries to catch their breath. And it’s continuous, even if a person needs to be placed on a ventilator, says Schieffelin, an associate professor of pediatrics at Tulane University.\n\n“For infants, it’s really rather terrifying,” he said. “They’re just coughing so much, they can’t eat, they can’t drink, and they often get a pneumonia, which means we have to put them on a ventilator. … They just never stop coughing.”\n\nIn Louisiana, two infants have died of pertussis in the past six months, according to the state health department, the first deaths from the disease in the state since 2018.\n\nLouisiana has had 110 cases of pertussis reported so far this year, the health department said – already approaching the 154 cases reported for all of 2024.\n\nCases are on the rise nationally, too. There were more than 35,000 cases of whooping cough last year in the US, the highest number in more than a decade, and 10 people died — six of them less than 1 year old. Experts say they see peaks and valleys with these kinds of illnesses over the years, but there have been about 6,600 cases already in 2025, almost four times the number at this point last year.\n\n“When you start to see these outbreaks … it tends to be as a result of that increased circulation of the microbe in the community, as well as populations with no immunity or reduced immunity that are susceptible to the infection,” said Dr. Lisa Morici, a professor of microbiology and immunology at the Tulane University School of Medicine.\n\nConcerned about increasing cases, experts are urging vaccination.\n\nThe US had more than 200,000 cases of whooping cough every year before the vaccine was introduced. By 1948, the vaccine was widely used, and infection rates began to drop. They started to rise again in the 1980s, largely due to increased surveillance and some waning vaccine immunity, but fell during the Covid-19 pandemic, when spread of many infectious diseases slowed due to measures like masking and distancing.\n\nChildren are recommended to get a dose of the diphtheria-tetanus-acellular pertussis, or DTaP, vaccine at the ages of 2 months, 4 months, 6 months, between 15 to 18 months and again between 4 to 6 years, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Adolescents should get a booster with a version of the vaccine called Tdap between age 11 and 12, and adults are urged to get Tdap boosters every 10 years.\n\nInfants too young to be vaccinated are susceptible to the bacteria, which is why officials recommend that pregnant women get the vaccine in their third trimester, so the antibodies will be passed to the newborn. This prevents 78% of pertussis cases in young infants and is 91% effective against hospitalization, the CDC says.\n\nAnother strategy that can protect infants is “cocooning,” in which members of the child’s household all get vaccinated to ensure protection, Schieffelin said.\n\nBoosters are recommended because protection from the vaccine can fade over time, which may be one reason for the ongoing outbreaks.\n\nDeclining vaccination rates are another reason. The percentage of US kindergartners who received the DTaP vaccine has steadily declined over the past five years, leaving thousands vulnerable to infection.\n\nOrganizers within the state say that although many people have become hesitant about vaccinations, another issue is a lack of access.\n\n“Especially in a state like Louisiana, we’ve got a lot of poverty. We’ve got a lot of rural populations, and not everyone has access to regular medical care,” said Dr. Jennifer Herricks, founder of Louisiana Families for Vaccines, a nonprofit that educates about vaccination. She says this is what makes state services and messaging even more important.\n\nPertussis cases in Louisiana are rising just weeks after the state Department of Health said it was ending vaccine promotion through events like health fairs.\n\n“The State of Louisiana and LDH have historically promoted vaccines for vaccine preventable illnesses through our parish health units, community health fairs, partnerships and media campaigns,” Surgeon General Dr. Ralph Abraham wrote in a memo. “While we encourage each patient to discuss the risks and benefits of vaccination with their provider, LDH will no longer promote mass vaccination.”\n\nThe memo differentiated between seasonal vaccines, such as Covid and flu vaccines, usually given at the state’s mass vaccination clinics and routine childhood vaccines, which it called “an important part of providing immunity to our children.” But local officials still expressed concern about the message being sent to residents.\n\n“When you cast aspersions or doubt about the safety and efficacy of one vaccine, I think it really has a ripple effect for all vaccines,” said Dr. Jennifer Avegno, director of the New Orleans Health Department.\n\nLast week, Abraham shared vaccination guidelines on Facebook while acknowledging the pertussis deaths and increasing cases in the state.\n\n“I’ve been encouraged that our state Department of Health is putting out good messaging about pertussis, but I worry that it’s going to get sort of lost in the in the shuffle,” Avegno said. “It’s maybe too little, too late.”\n\nCNN’s Deidre McPhillips contributed to this report.",

        "source": "https://www.cnn.com/",
        "content": "CNN —\n\nAudrey Hale felt no hatred against anyone at the school where the former student gunned down six people. In fact, the 28-year-old relished fond memories of The Covenant School and wanted “to die somewhere that made her happy,” Nashville police said.\n\n“Hale bore no grudge against the school or staff” and considered them to be “‘innocents’ and victims on par with herself,” the Metropolitan Nashville Police Department said.\n\nThe revelation came in a trove of new details released in a report by Nashville police Wednesday – two years after Hale randomly slaughtered three teachers and three 9-year-old children at the private Christian school.\n\nShortly after the massacre on March 27, 2023, Hale was gunned down by police – leaving myriad questions about the inexplicable killings that remained unanswered until now.\n\nAfter conducting interviews and reviewing Hale’s digital devices, online accounts, artwork and writings, detectives managed to piece together the killer’s preparation and motivation behind the gruesome attack.\n\nNotoriety was the motive\n\nHale attended The Covenant School in the early 2000s, from kindergarten through fourth grade. The former student denied suffering any emotional or physical abuse during this period, investigators said in the report obtained by CNN.\n\n“She felt safe and accepted at The Covenant and made friends with other students,” the report said. “She considered her family life during this time as happy, with a positive relationship with both of her parents and her brother.”\n\nBut more than 16 years after leaving the school, Hale targeted the beloved alma mater “due to the notoriety she would obtain” and “because she had a personal connection to the school from earlier in her life and felt she had to die somewhere that made her happy,” police said.\n\nWhile the killer “identified as a male and used he/him as preferred pronouns,” Nashville police said, “Under Tennessee law, a person’s gender identity must correspond with their biological sex or with information present on their certificate of live birth.”\n\nAs a result, authorities described Hale as a female in their 40-plus-page report.\n\nInvestigators discovered Hale left “material behind intentionally to be found and analyzed,” including “her detailed plan to commit carnage in a school, with timelines, diagrams, etc.,” Nashville police said.\n\n“The publication of the writings would serve three purposes: to document her struggles with her mental health; to show how … her mental health conditions helped her ‘to execute the perfect plan’; and to show others like her how to best plan and carry out an attack,” the investigative report states.\n\nIn the days leading up to the attack, Hale started to transfer writings onto a thumb drive so “they could be found and studied,” the report states.\n\n“Notoriety was the motive,” the report summary says. “It is known that Hale, and other mass shooters, studied material from Columbine High School prior to committing their attacks.”\n\nMourners pray while visiting a memorial for the victims killed at The Covenant School in Nashville in March 2023. Cheney Orr/Reuters\n\nHale rated other mass shooters based on the number of people they murdered and considered those who killed a low number of people to be “amateurs” who weren’t worthy of respect, Nashville police said. But Hale “made exceptions for those offenders with documented mental health histories showing they had serious mental health diseases or disorders, as she believed they were ‘too sick’ to formulate an effective plan to kill an adequate number of victims.”\n\nHale wanted books, documentaries and movies “to be made about her life and her attack,” police said. The killer also wanted “her firearms to be placed in a museum” and “wanted her bedroom to be left as it was when the attack occurred as a memorial to her.”\n\nIn a statement Wednesday, families of the victims, as well as children who were at the school the day of the shooting, said, “There would never be closure after a crime like this. No words can diminish the depths of loss we feel without Evelyn, Hallie, William, Mike, Katherine, and Cindy.”\n\nThe shooter killed three 9-year-olds: Evelyn Dieckhaus, Hallie Scruggs and William Kinney. Three adults were also fatally shot: Mike Hill, the school custodian; Katherine Koonce, the head of the school; and substitute teacher Cynthia Peak.\n\n“No facts can lessen the trauma and grief we have been bearing the past two years,” the statement read. “This report summarizes the reality we’ve been living with, that this was truly a senseless crime committed by a deranged, selfish, evil individual who relished the killing of innocent children. This report is bleak. We hope no one else ever has to go through this.”\n\nEric Osborne, an attorney representing some of the victims’ families, said the findings establish “beyond a doubt that our legal battle against the public release of the shooter’s evil material is just, appropriate, and should silence any critics of our efforts.”\n\n“Please remember that there are real children and families who are suffering and who will never be the same,” Osborne said in a statement. “Keep your focus on the victims and survivors of that horrific day.”\n\nThe shooter carried stuffed animals next to firearms the morning of the killings\n\nHale suffered from anxiety and social phobias, “which led to her self-isolating more often,” the investigative report said.\n\n“Her isolation and loneliness led Hale to begin believing the only true friends she could confide in were her stuffed animals, who she felt would never abandon her,” police said.\n\n“She assigned them names and personalities, took them with her whenever she travelled, and began creating cartoons and digital media, including stories where they demonstrated some of the same emotions she felt.”\n\nAround 8 a.m. the morning of the killings, Hale left home “carrying a large duffle bag which contained several firearms, ammunition for those firearms, tactical gear, and her stuffed animals,” the investigative report states.\n\nStuffed animals were found in Hale's car, which was left in The Covenant School's parking lot. Metropolitan Nashville Police Department\n\n“She also had with her a backpack containing two notebooks and assorted items. She loaded these bags into her vehicle” and drove to a local gun range, authorities said.\n\n“Once there, she donned her tactical vest and affixed magazine pouches to her belt. The vest was loaded with several spare magazines, an automatic knife, and other equipment. She then assembled and loaded three different firearms. She then remained in her vehicle in the parking lot of the location for over an hour and finally left the location at 9:33 a.m.”\n\nHale then went to The Covenant School around 9:53 a.m. and waited in the car for several minutes. “During this time, Hale sent a goodbye message to a friend through Instagram Messenger,” police said.\n\n“At approximately 10:09 a.m., she exited her vehicle, slung two firearms around her neck and shoulders, and approached one of the west entrances to the building.”\n\nHale’s firearms included an AR-15 pistol, a semi-automatic AR pistol, a semi-automatic carbine rifle and a semi-automatic pistol.\n\nAfter the deadly rampage, detectives searched Hale’s vehicle and found several stuffed animals on the front passenger seat, “along with five fully loaded magazines containing 5.56mm ammunition,” police said.\n\n“In the front passenger floorboard was a backpack. Inside the backpack were two notebooks containing handwriting and sketches, along with two thumb drives.”\n\nHale’s parents and therapist tried to help, but the shooter didn’t tell them everything\n\nInvestigators determined Hale was sane, but evidence suggested worsening anxiety, depression and rage.\n\nBefore the massacre, Hale’s parents assisted their child “with obtaining mental healthcare despite them not being legally required to do so,” police wrote.\n\nBut “Hale chronicled that she withheld information from providers to prevent her from being stopped,” authorities said.\n\nThe killer often wrote about the level of secrecy needed to carry out the attack, including withholding information from the therapist, taking steps to delete browsing history, and concealing guns and ammunition, police said.\n\nEven though Hale’s “disappointments in relationships, career aspirations, and independence fueled her depression, and even though this depression made her highly suicidal, this doesn’t explain the attack,” police said.\n\n“As Hale wrote on several occasions, if suicide was her goal then she would have simply killed herself,” the report states. “Throughout the writings and videos, Hale frequently commented that her death needed to matter and be remembered.”\n\nInvestigators learned Hale felt chronic loneliness and disappointment.\n\n“She felt abandoned and ignored by those she longed to befriend and engage with romantically, which angered her more than anything else,” the report says.\n\n“She believed that by simply committing suicide, she would be quickly forgotten and not even worthy of a footnote in history. She craved the notoriety Harris and Klebold attained following Columbine.”\n\nThis undated picture of Audrey Hale was provided by the Metropolitan Nashville Police Department. Metropolitan Nashville Police Department\n\nEric Harris and Dylan Klebold were the teen gunmen who killed 13 people at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colorado. The 1999 massacre has been cited as an inspiration for other school shooters in the decades since.\n\nHale focused on how the Columbine killers’ “documented mental health history and societal views were similar to her own and how the notoriety they achieved following their deaths led them to becoming ‘gods,’” Nashville police said.\n\nHale “sought to become a ‘god’ like Harris and Klebold by killing victims nobody would forget: children.”\n\nThe killer admitted the victims were innocent\n\nLike Harris and Klebold, Hale “longed for her name and actions to be remembered long after she was dead,” police said.\n\n“She openly acknowledged none of those she would kill were guilty of anything and denied any personal motivation for targeting them,” Nashville police wrote. Instead, the killer “felt their deaths were necessary to give her death meaning.”\n\n“She wanted her mental health to be a prominent topic of discussion and debate,” investigators said.\n\n“Most disturbingly, she wanted the things she left behind to be shared with the world so she could inspire and teach others who were ‘mentally disordered’ like her to plan and commit an attack of their own.”\n\nYet Hale “often complained how she didn’t know enough about the mental health history or motives of most mass killers, as nothing was publicly documented regarding their struggles,” the reports says.\n\nNonetheless, “Hale felt she would be a failure if she killed less than 10 people during the attack,” the report said.\n\nHale took a guided tour of the school in 2021, claiming to be “an alum who wanted to reminisce about her time in elementary school,” the report said. In reality, Hale was casing the school and “discreetly photographed different locations,” police said.\n\nCNN has reached out to the school for comment.\n\nLess than two years after that visit, Hale burst into her beloved former school wielding an assault-style rifle and gunned down six people.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional information.\n\nCNN’s Ray Sanchez and Karina Tsui contributed to this report.",

        "source": "https://www.cnn.com/",
        "content": "CNN —\n\nThe US Food and Drug Administration has delayed granting full approval of Novavax’s Covid-19 vaccine despite it being on track to be cleared until Tuesday afternoon, a person familiar with the situation told CNN.\n\nThe agency is seeking more data on the vaccine, said the source, who declined to be named because they weren’t authorized to speak publicly about the situation. The Wall Street Journal first reported that the FDA had missed its decision deadline.\n\nThe move came as the FDA named Dr. Scott Steele acting director of the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, which oversees vaccine regulation, days after former director Dr. Peter Marks was forced out. In his resignation letter, Marks cited “efforts being advanced by some on the adverse health effects of vaccination” that he called “concerning.”\n\nUS Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a longtime anti-vaccine advocate, has falsely called vaccines for Covid-19 “the deadliest vaccine ever made” and more recently made misleading statements about the safety of the measles vaccine amid a deadly outbreak centered in West Texas.\n\nThe Novavax vaccine, which uses more traditional protein-based technology than the newer mRNA vaccines from Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna, has been subject to emergency use authorization since 2022. But with FDA action, it would be the third vaccine against Covid-19 to receive full FDA approval. Full approval would make the vaccine available beyond an emergency declaration and could provide additional reassurance to people seeking the vaccine.\n\nThe company said Wednesday that it hadn’t received an official decision from the FDA but that April 1 was the date by which the agency had been set to issue the decision.\n\n“As of Tuesday, April 1, we had responded to all of the FDA’s information requests and we believe that our [Biologics License Application] is ready for approval,” Novavax said in a statement, noting that the application “included robust Phase 3 clinical trial data that showed our vaccine is safe and effective for the prevention of Covid-19.”\n\n“We are confident our well-tolerated vaccine represents an important alternative to mRNA Covid-19 vaccines for the US,” Novavax said.\n\nThe FDA’s press office was put on administrative leave Tuesday as part of the HHS Reduction in Force effort. A spokesman for HHS told CNN, “The FDA’s independent review process for the Novavax vaccine, like all vaccines is based solely on ensuring safety and efficacy, not political considerations. Any delays are a result of scientific review.”",

        "source": "https://www.cnn.com/",
        "content": "CNN —\n\nFour Senate Republicans joined with Democrats on Wednesday to deliver a rare bipartisan rebuke to President Donald Trump over trade policy.\n\nThe Senate adopted a resolution by a vote of 51 to 48 aimed at blocking the Trump administration’s proposed tariffs on Canadian imports. The four Republicans who voted with Democrats were: Sens. Rand Paul, who cosponsored the resolution, Susan Collins, Mitch McConnell and Lisa Murkowski.\n\nThe move amounts to rare bipartisan pushback against Trump in the GOP-led Senate and comes after Trump criticized the measure and urged Republicans to vote against it.\n\nThe impact of the Senate vote may remain largely symbolic. House GOP leaders are not expected to take up any efforts to rebuke Trump over tariff policy – and even moved earlier this year to prohibit such a move. Some House Democrats believe, however, they may have found a way to circumvent GOP leaders on the issue of tariff policy.\n\nThe Democrat-led Senate measure to rebuke the administration’s trade policy has been in the works for some time and was not a direct response to Trump’s tariff announcements on Wednesday.\n\nThe resolution would overturn a national emergency declaration that the Trump administration cited in February to announce planned tariffs on imports from Canada. Democrats have described the measure as a way to undo tariffs on Canadian goods.\n\nTrump on Wednesday announced tariffs of at least 10% on practically all goods coming into the United States, plus even higher rates on dozens of countries that have the highest trade deficits with the United States.\n\nThe new policy represents a dramatic shift in global trade and economic policy. It’s aimed at restoring US manufacturing prowess and the balance of trade. But it threatens to escalate an emerging global trade war and raise prices for American consumers at a precarious time for for the economy.\n\nRep. Greg Meeks of New York, the top Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said on Wednesday that he plans to introduce a privileged resolution to House force a vote over tariffs, a procedural move that can be used to bypass leadership and force floor votes.\n\nDemocratic Sen. Tim Kaine, who led the effort to force the Senate vote on blocking tariffs from the Trump administration on Canadian imports, said Wednesday he had approached McConnell Tuesday evening about signing onto the effort and said the Kentucky Republican pledged to back it before he could even ask.\n\n“I said, I want to talk to you about my Canadian tariffs bill. And you know, I didn’t even get to the question, and he said, ‘I’m with you,’” Kaine said, describing the conversation.\n\nMcConnell did not respond when asked by a CNN reporter at the Capitol on Wednesday ahead of the vote if he planned to support the effort.\n\nKaine said ahead of the vote that he believed he has “rock solid support” from four GOP senators, which would be enough for the Senate vote to succeed. There are also some Republicans, he said, “who are thinking about it but haven’t declared.”\n\nTrump urged Republicans to vote against the measure in a post on Truth Social and singled out four Republicans in particular – Sens. Paul, McConnell, Murkowski and Collins – saying they “will hopefully get on the Republican bandwagon, for a change, and fight the Democrats wild and flagrant push.”\n\nTrump went on to say, “To the people of the Great States of Kentucky, Alaska, and Maine, please contact these Senators and get them to FINALLY adhere to Republican Values and Ideals.”\n\nCollins spoke in support of the resolution in remarks on the Senate floor Wednesday afternoon ahead of Trump’s announcement.\n\n“The Maine economy is integrated with Canada, our most important trading partner. From home heating oil, gasoline, jet fuel, and other refined petroleum products, to Maine’s paper mills, forest products businesses, agricultural producers, and lobstermen, the tariffs on Canada would be detrimental to many Maine families and our local economies,” she said.\n\nKaine warned about negative consequences for agricultural states of a trade war, specifically mentioning the potential negative impact on the whiskey industry.\n\n“There’s never been a one-sided trade war and they always retaliate when it’s agriculture. It hits ag states very, very hard, which includes whiskey,” Kaine said. “Craft distillers in Virginia, my craft brewers are very, very worried about this.”\n\nReferring to McConnell, Kaine said, “And I’m sure he is hearing the same thing. … I would imagine he is hearing a mouthful from folks.”\n\nAsked ahead of the vote if he thought Trump’s Truth Social post would affect votes, Kaine said, “He attacked me too, It doesn’t affect me at all. And the ones he’s attacked, I don’t think it’s affecting them at all. So we’ll see.”\n\nThis story has been updated with additional information.\n\nCNN’s Ted Barrett and David Goldman contributed to this report.",

        "content": "Mae Sot, Thailand CNN —\n\nHundreds of men and women stand in rows, divided by nationality, in the courtyard of a white-walled compound, flanked by armed guards in fatigues.\n\n“Do you want to go home?” a voice shouts in the video obtained by CNN. They raise their hands. “Yes,” they reply in chorus.\n\nThe group were among around 7,000 people recently released from scam centers run by criminal gangs and warlords operating along Myanmar’s border with Thailand, where many are held against their will and forced to work conning ordinary people, including American citizens, out of their life savings.\n\nSome volunteer to work in the compounds. But many others are lured by promises of well-paying jobs or other enticing opportunities, before being trafficked across the border into Myanmar to carry out fraudulent investment schemes and romance scams.\n\nFor years, the scam centers and cyber fraud compounds - many run by Chinese crime syndicates – have proliferated along the mountainous frontier, raking in billions of dollars from scams, money laundering and other illicit activities. The Chinese and Thai governments finally launched a highly publicized crackdown in February.\n\nThose included in the releases are a fraction of an estimated 100,000 people trapped along the border.\n\nExperts and analysts told CNN the industry will only come back stronger.\n\n“Billions of dollars are being invested in these kinds of businesses,” said Kannavee Suebsang, a Thai lawmaker leading his country’s efforts to release those held in scam centers. “They [the scam syndicates] will not stop.”\n\nHundreds of people freed from scam centers in KK Park in February, 2025. CNN\n\nThe scam underworld, analysts say, is agile and professional, and is rapidly expanding cyber fraud operations through illicit online marketplaces to target new demographics of victims.\n\nThe syndicates have quickly adopted cryptocurrency and are investing in cutting-edge technological developments to move money more quickly, as well as making the scams more effective.\n\nCrime groups are using artificial intelligence to write scamming scripts and are exploiting increasingly realistic deepfake technology to create personas, pose as a love interests, and mask their identity, voice and gender.\n\n“Fundamentally, this is a situation the region has never faced before,” said John Wojcik, an organized crime analyst at the United Nations Office of Drugs and Crime.\n\n“It’s clear that the evolving situation is trending towards something far more dangerous than scams alone – and rolling out at an unprecedented scale if left unchecked.”\n\nThere is also evidence of Asian crime syndicates expanding into other parts of the world, with networks found in parts of Africa, South Asia, the Gulf, and the Pacific, according to the UNODC.\n\n“These syndicates are quickly maturing into more sophisticated cyber threat actors capable of deploying malware, deepfakes and other powerful tools, fuelled by the rise of new illicit online markets and crypto-based laundering services,” said Wojick.\n\nThe scale of the problem is too vast for one government or agency to combat. Experts say a global response is needed.\n\nInside KK Park in Myawaddy, Myanmar in February, 2025. CNN\n\nScam city\n\nThe scam compounds in Myawaddy lie in territory controlled by two Myanmar ethnic militia groups, the Karen Border Guard Force and the Democratic Karen Benevolent Army (DKBA).\n\nOne such complex is KK Park, a sprawling, purpose-built city that experts say is dedicated to online gambling and cyber fraud.\n\nRinged by mountains and corn fields, the huge, heavily guarded compound of multi-story buildings and telecoms towers stands just inside the country’s border with Thailand – a blot on the otherwise untouched landscape.\n\n“They deceived many people, from South America, from North America, from Africa and Arabic-speaking countries.” Kannavee Suebsang, Thai lawmaker\n\nFootage filmed for CNN from inside KK Park shows paved roads lined with trees and manicured lawns, giving the image of a legitimate business district, complete with a hotel and billboards advertising gambling sites.\n\nBut in what looked like an office building, dozens of men were packed together in a whitewashed room, sitting or lying on duvets on the floor.\n\nIn a nearby courtyard, dozens more men and several women sit crouched in lines. Most wear masks to obscure their identities. Clothes and towels hang drying on overhead balconies.\n\nThe Border Guard Force militia had invited local journalists inside KK Park on a heavily restricted visit. Armed BGF soldiers carried semi-automatic rifles and rocket-propelled grenade launchers, as the media were escorted into a select few buildings.\n\nThe several hundred people inside are the recently released victims and workers of the scam compound, the BGF said.\n\n“They deceived many people, from South America, from North America, from Africa and Arabic-speaking countries,” said Kannavee.\n\nThe KK Park complex in Myanmar, seen from the border with Thailand, in February. Mark Phillips/CNN\n\nChinese pressure\n\nThe armed groups agreed to help put a stop to illegal trafficking and scamming operations in their territories after pressure from Chinese and Thai authorities following the high-profile abduction of a Chinese actor to a scam center in Myawaddy earlier this year.\n\nThe compounds have operated for years, shielded by corruption and lawlessness that has long saturated Myanmar’s border regions. But the criminal syndicates and the armed groups hosting them have exploited four years of devastating civil war to greatly expand their business.\n\nSince seizing power in a coup in February 2021, Myanmar’s military junta has waged a brutal war against its people. On multiple fronts, the military is fighting against resistance groups and long-established ethnic minority armed forces, which the opposition government says now control about 60% of the country.\n\n“These armed groups have very direct relationships with the mafia.” Jason Tower, United States Institute of Peace, Myanmar\n\nMore than $43 billion is lost to scams in Southeast Asia by regional crime groups a year — almost 40% of the combined gross domestic product of Laos, Cambodia, and Myanmar, according to the US Congress-founded United States Institute of Peace.\n\nPrevious crackdowns in Myanmar meant the syndicates moved operations further into the country’s interior or to major cities such as Yangon. And traffickers involved in bringing people into the centers became more sophisticated, experts say.\n\nEven as thousands of people are being released in Myawaddy, there’s continued illicit activity and ongoing recruitment inside.\n\n“There is already indication of an ongoing partial displacement into other neighboring scam hubs in the region,” said UNODC’s Wojcik.\n\nThe BGF and militias are positioning themselves as helping to eradicate the scam centers in their territories, even leading press tours into the scam compounds.\n\nBut they are also accused of direct involvement in operations inside the centers and benefiting financially from them.\n\nA member of the Karen Border Guard Force guards alleged scam center workers, many of whom say they were trafficked and forced to work at the compound, during a crackdown operation on February 23. AFP/Getty Images\n\nAlleged scam center workers and victims stand together during the crackdown operation by the Karen Border Guard Force. AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe BGF was one of the architects of the criminal hub in Myawaddy starting from 2016, when it rented land to Chinese syndicates, according to analysts, and business soared after the 2021 military coup.\n\n“The Border Guard Force has shares in every single one of these projects, and that’s the mainstay of its economy. It’s drawing most of its revenue from this,” said Jason Tower, country director for Myanmar at the United States Institute of Peace.\n\n“These armed groups have very direct relationships with the mafia,” he added. “They’re using that revenue to purchase weapons, to recruit new troops. So, it’s a very clear alignment of interests that’s there between these armed groups and the criminal syndicates.”\n\nCNN has reached out to the BGF and DKBA for comment.\n\n“As long as peace is not a reality in Myanmar… This is the reality here along the border.” Kannavee Suebsang, Thai lawmaker\n\nThailand’s Department of Special Investigation is seeking an arrest warrant for BGF leader Saw Chit Thu – who is linked to another notorious compound, Shwe Kokko – and two of his associates, on human trafficking charges.\n\nPolice said the prosecutor’s office is reviewing the case.\n\nChit Thu has denied knowing about or benefiting from the scamming and trafficking operations in his territory, and said in a recent press conference that the BGF is raiding the compounds with the aim of eradicating them.\n\nChina has taken the lead in putting pressure on Thailand to stop scam operations on its border. For years, China has been the main supporter of Myanmar’s military, but the proliferation of scam operations has strained that relationship.\n\nAnalysts say Beijing could be leveraging the situation to increase its security presence in Myanmar and influence the trajectory of the civil war, which has had a destabilizing effect on its own border with Myanmar.\n\n“It potentially could use that growing presence there to assist the Myanmar military in gaining additional intelligence on some of the movements of resistance forces in the Myanmar, Thailand borderland,” said Tower.\n\nMyint Kyaw of the junta-controlled Myanmar information ministry said the government is “actively investigating online scams and online gambling, and is working with foreign countries, including foreign organizations, to combat them.”\n\nWhile Myanmar remains fractured and in a state of civil war, without a legitimate government to negotiate with, the scam industry in Myanmar won’t be dismantled.\n\n“As long as peace is not a reality in Myanmar,” said Kannavee. “This is the reality here along the border.”\n\nAdding further uncertainty to efforts to eradicate the scam compounds, is that Myanmar is now struggling to respond to a massive earthquake that has devastated the country’s central Sagaing region, killing more than 2,700 people.\n\nSatellite images from Maxar Technologies show construction at KK Park in Myawaddy from 2020 to 2024. Maxar Technologies\n\nFears for those left behind\n\nEven for the about 7,000 victims and workers rounded up in the recent operations, there is little clarity on how or when many will be able to go home.\n\nThe armed groups have demanded that Thailand let the individuals cross the border so they can be repatriated, saying they don’t have food or capacity to care for them.\n\nChina, whose nationals make up the largest proportion of people caught up inside the centers, has flown several thousand of its citizens home, and last week more than 500 freed Indian nationals were repatriated.\n\nBut Thailand has struggled to process a backlog of thousands of people from more than 20 countries.\n\n“They told him… We’re going to sell you. We’re going to get your kidney or your eyes.” Chelsea, family member\n\n“The situation is really getting to the point where it’s almost a humanitarian crisis, and it’s a very unique crisis in so far as you have people from such a wide range of countries,” said Tower. “This is a particularly complex operation to have to manage, and it’s all happening with very little time to plan, very little time to raise resources.”\n\nKannavee led a successful rescue operation of 260 people in February after negotiating with the DKBA. Video from the release shows dozens of people streaming onto a small Thai-flagged ferry to cross the Moei River – the demarcation line between Thailand and Myanmar. Carrying bags and suitcases, many look relieved and happy to finally be on Thai soil. But their ordeal was not over.\n\n“Many of them are still stuck in the temporary shelters in Thailand,” said Kannavee.\n\nVictims, who were tricked or trafficked into working in Myanmar scam centers, stand on a vessel floating toward the Thai side of the border on February 12. Krit Phromsakla Na Sakolnakorn/Reuters\n\nAs they watch others be released, families of those still inside the centers have had to anxiously await news of their loved ones.\n\nChelsea’s husband left their home in the Philippines in April last year for what he was told was a tech support job in Thailand. Chelsea, who asked to use a pseudonym to protect her husband, was pregnant with their second child at the time, and the family needed the cash.\n\nBut after arriving in Bangkok, her husband was driven to the Thai border town Mae Sot, where “soldiers with guns” forced him get on a boat across the river to Myanmar, she said. Instead of tech support, Chelsea said her husband worked 17-hour days for no salary conning people out of their money online.\n\n“I dare not imagine how terrible it must be to be in there.” Family member\n\nFormer victims and family members of those inside the centers have told CNN if they refuse to work or don’t meet their quotas, they are beaten, locked in a dark room, forced to squat or tasered. They are only freed after paying large ransoms or recruiting others to work in their place, they say.\n\nVideo filmed by a victim inside a scam center in Myawaddy, and obtained by CNN, shows an unidentified man torturing a Pakistani national with electric shocks and beatings, as he screams and begs the man to stop, on the floor of a bathroom.\n\n“I cannot sleep. I’m just thinking about how he’s been doing,” Chelsea said.\n\nA member of the Karen Border Guard Force stands guard as those freed from online scam centers arrive at the border checkpoint with Thailand, in Myawaddy, Myanmar, on February 20.

AFP/Getty Images\n\nChelsea had kept in touch with her husband via a used phone he bought from someone in the compound. But in December he suddenly stopped responding to her. Three months later, he got back in touch. He had been caught with the phone and the scam bosses threatened to sell him to another compound.\n\n“They told him that if we catch you again having a phone, we’re going to sell you. We’re going to get your kidney or your eyes,” Chelsea said.\n\nHer husband was in a DKBA camp, hoping to be released home. Last week, he was finally released.\n\nOther family members who spoke to CNN say they are terrified the increased attention and crackdowns on the scam centers means their loved ones will be moved to other compounds within Myanmar, or punished with beatings.\n\nOne woman from China, who requested anonymity because she feared retaliation, said she believed her sibling was moved to a different compound in February.\n\nUntil her sibling was unexpectedly released in recent weeks, information had dried up for months.\n\n“Ever since they started releasing people in February, their freedom has been monitored even more strictly, no one is allowed to chat with (each) other,” she said. “I dare not imagine how terrible it must be to be in there.”",

        "source": "https://www.cnn.com/",
        "content": "New York CNN —\n\nUS stocks plunged in after-hours trading Wednesday as investors digested President Donald Trump’s decision to impose sweeping tariffs that could escalate a growing trade war and upend the global economy.\n\nDow futures plummeted more than 1,100 points, or 2.7%. S&P 500 futures sank 3.9%. Futures tied to the Nasdaq 100 plunged 4.7%.\n\nUS stocks closed higher Wednesday afternoon ahead of Trump’s announcement on tariffs, but a selloff began as he unveiled his plan, holding up a chart that depicted how rates would increase depending on the country.\n\nWall Street had been nervous about Trump’s tariffs, though some analysts expected stocks could rally if the tariff announcement was lighter than feared. Those hopes were quickly dashed as Trump unveiled baseline 10% tariffs on all imports, plus higher rates for specific countries.\n\n“Trump is enacting a very aggressive tariff policy, far more aggressive than most investors thought possible six months ago,” said Jed Ellerbroek, portfolio manager at Argent Capital. “Painful times for stock market investors.”\n\n“While the market was positioned to bounce on a ‘less bad than expected’ tariff announcement, there is no way to spin today’s news as positive for the economy or stock market,” said Ellerbroek.\n\nApple, Tesla tumble in after-hours trading\n\nThe selloff turned into a rout Wednesday evening as investors reckoned with the extent of Trump’s tariffs.\n\nApple (AAPL) tumbled more than 7% in after-hours trading. The tech giant relies extensively on supply chains in China, which will be subject to steep tariffs.\n\nThe other stocks leading markets lower in after-hours trading included Tesla (TSLA), which fell more than 6% and Amazon (AMZN), which fell more than 5%. Nike (NKE) plunged 7% and Walmart (WMT) fell 6%.\n\n“President Trump just finished his tariff speech at the White House and we would characterize this slate of tariffs as ‘worse than the worst case scenario’ the Street was fearing,” said Dan Ives, senior analyst at Wedbush Securities, in a note.\n\nIves said “the jaw dropper” was Trump slamming hefty reciprocal tariffs on China, bringing its rate to 54%.\n\nAs stocks tanked, members of the Trump administration appeared unfazed. US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told Bloomberg that a selloff in stocks was “a Mag 7 problem not a MAGA problem,” referring to the “Magnificent Seven” of tech stocks that include Apple, Amazon, Meta, Microsoft, Google, Tesla and Nvidia.\n\nEconomists expect that Trump’s sweeping tariffs could upend global supply chains, stoke inflation and drag on economic growth.\n\nJoAnne Bianco, chief investment strategist at BondBloxx, said the US will continue to experience elevated uncertainty and market volatility as investors assess the “detrimental economic impact” of Trump’s tariffs.\n\n“The roller coaster ride continues as the initial leaks were positive … but then the details were released and they were far worse than expected,” said Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer at Northlight Asset Management.\n\n“The silver lining for investors could be that this is only a starting point for negotiations with other countries and ultimately tariff rates will come down across the board — but for now traders are shooting first and asking questions later,” said Zaccarelli.",

        "content": "Summary The FAA is sending a “Critical Incident Stress Management” team to Reagan Airport following recent occurrences, including a fatal mid-air collision.\n\nA controller was recently arrested and charged with assault after a fight in the control tower.\n\nA close call occurred when a Delta plane took off with Air Force jets dangerously close.\n\nThe FAA increased operational supervisors from six to eight and is reviewing controller staffing at the airport.\n\nHourly arrivals were reduced to 26 after January's collision but have since increased to 30.\n\nWashington CNN —\n\nThe Federal Aviation Administration is sending a “stress management team” to meet with air traffic controllers at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport and making other changes after a rash of recent incidents.\n\nThe “Critical Incident Stress Management” team, which offers “confidential support for staff following stressful events,” will visit DCA in early April, the FAA announced in a statement. The agency will also conduct regular “wellness checks at the facility.”\n\nReagan Airport has had a string of incidents since the start of the year, including January 29 when a US Army Blackhawk helicopter and an American Airlines regional jet collided in the air, killing 67 people.\n\nThursday, a fight in the control tower ended with a 39-year-old controller arrested and charged with assault and battery. The FAA says he has been placed on leave.\n\nOn Friday, a close call occurred after an apparent breakdown in communications ultimately led to a Delta Air Lines plane taking off and T-38 jets from an Air Force flyover coming dangerously close.\n\n“The air traffic center that controls air space around DC notified DCA about the flyover. That should have led to halted traffic,” Sen. Ted Cruz said in a congressional hearing Wednesday. “This serious communication breakdown is just the latest in a string of missteps that signal that the air traffic organization is under extreme stress.”\n\nThe FAA also increased the number of operational supervisors at the airport from six to eight and is reviewing controller staffing. At the time of January’s collision one controller was handling two positions, the National Transportation Safety Board noted. While that is allowed in certain circumstances, the preliminary report shows they did it for more than five hours, which was not abnormal.\n\nThe most recent data from the Federal Aviation Administration shows that across all airport towers and terminal approach facilities nationwide, only about 70% of staffing targets were filled by fully certified controllers as of September 2023.\n\nThe FAA will also evaluate the rate at which planes are allowed to arrive at the airport each hour. The number of hourly arrivals was reduced to 26 after the January collision when some runways were closed for the investigation, but they have since been increased to 30 – still fewer than the 32 arrivals per hour allowed before the January accident.",

        "content": "CNN —\n\nHe didn’t even stop to use the bathroom.\n\nBeginning Monday night, Democratic Sen. Cory Booker stood and spoke for 25 hours and 5 minutes, according to his office, breaking the record for the longest speech on the Senate floor in modern history. The 55-year-old New Jersey senator surpassed the late Republican Sen. Strom Thurmond, who spoke for 24 hours and 18 minutes in 1957.\n\nBooker never yielded the floor for a break because doing so would have allowed the presiding officer to move on with Senate business. His speech included a wide range of issues, including warnings about the harms he said the Trump administration is inflicting on the American public.\n\nTo physically prepare for the feat, Booker used “a lot of tactics,” he said, including fasting and curbing water intake in the days before to make sure he could stand for so long and wouldn’t have to take a bathroom break.\n\n“I think that had good and bad benefits. I definitely started cramping up from lack of water,” Booker told CNN’s Manu Raju on Tuesday. “In the end, I was just trying to do something to stop my muscles from cramping.”\n\nBooker began his speech at 7 p.m. ET Monday with a vow to keep his protest going as long as he was “physically able” and with nothing, he told CNN, but a Bible verse in his pocket. The only times he was not speaking were when he briefly paused for the chamber’s prayer at noon Tuesday and when he took questions from Democratic colleagues.\n\n“In some ways, what he did was an endurance race,” said Dr. James Gladstone, system chief of the Division of Sports Medicine and associate professor of orthopedic surgery at Mount Sinai in New York.\n\n“But his preparation was definitely unorthodox,” Gladstone said. “Most athletes, for an endurance running race, would carb-load leading up to it, certainly hours before the race, and will hydrate to the max and hydrate during the course of the event.”\n\nFor instance, “tennis players will have a meal – often something like rice and chicken – two hours before they go out there and play,” said Gladstone, who works closely with professional athletes. That type of preparation would ensure that the body has enough energy and water to fuel it for an extreme activity.\n\nIf Dr. Saju Mathew were advising Booker on how to prepare for the marathon speech – and if the senator had been able to take bathroom breaks – he would have recommended the opposite of fasting: nourishing and drinking a lot of water before the event to build stamina.\n\n“You need enough nutrition and enough sleep,” said Mathew, a primary care physician and public health specialist at Piedmont Healthcare in Atlanta. “And a week before, you need to start replenishing electrolytes, because you’re going to almost be in a comatose state when you deprive your body from fluids and nutrition for that long.”\n\nWithout appropriate fuel or hydration, muscle tightness and cramping can happen, Gladstone said, adding that he was “surprised” Booker didn’t start cramping until near the end of his speech. But Gladstone suspects that the senator fasted for days before his marathon speech so he would “lose those intense hunger pains” that he would have otherwise had if he had eaten closer to the event.\n\nThe fact that Booker had muscle cramps indicates that he was in an electrolyte deficit from dehydration, said Dr. Mishal Reja, a gastroenterologist and internal medicine physician at Extension Health in New York.\n\n“When you don’t have enough electrolytes to support your muscles and your blood volume, you get symptoms like that, and if it goes on too long – thankfully, he stopped at 25 hours – but really significant dehydration can affect your kidneys. It could affect urinary issues, and it can even cause you to faint,” Reja said.\n\nAlthough Booker said he deliberately avoided drinking a lot of fluids so he wouldn’t have to urinate, physically resisting any urges to go to the bathroom could also take a toll on the body too, Reja added.\n\n“I don’t think it was exactly clear if he really needed to pee, but if he did and he held it, then that’s something where they call it ‘post-void obstruction,’ where you use all your muscles to hold in that urinary stream,” Reja said.\n\n“If it gets over a certain level, it could be really dangerous, and you can have some severe bladder issues,” he said.\n\nBooker is now recovering from the marathon speech, and Mathew said that even though the senator seems to be in good shape, he hopes Booker is “chilling at home” and getting some IV fluids.\n\n“I hope for his sake that he has taken the next three days off and he is getting enough sleep and then getting his electrolytes back,” Mathew said. “One thing that is recommended after is to replenish your fluids gradually and eat a well-balanced diet. Something that I would recommend would be coconut water or a sports drink with electrolytes.”\n\nBooker’s recovery should include slowly reintroducing calories and nutrients, Reja said.\n\n“An ideal diet would look something like a little bit of bone broth or a little bit of rice or vegetables, something that’s easily digestible, or bananas,” he said. “And then you replete the electrolytes and you replete the calories, because your energy stores and your glycogen stores in your body have essentially been depleted after 25 hours.”\n\nBooker told CNN on Wednesday that he hasn’t slept much since his record speech.\n\n“My spirit is soaring. My body is definitely weary,” he told Raju, explaining that he couldn’t fall asleep when he got home Tuesday evening because he had “a lot going on” in his mind, so he called his mother and other family members.\n\nAsked about speculation that the marathon speech was a preview for a 2028 presidential campaign, Booker, who is up for re-election in 2026, said, “I need to get re-elected. That’s my focus.”",

        "source": "https://www.cnn.com/",
        "content": "CNN —\n\nAs Democratic Sen. Cory Booker neared Strom Thurmond’s record for the longest speech in Senate history Tuesday night, the typically sparsely filled viewing galleries above the Senate floor grew packed.\n\nDemocratic Senate staffers and members of the public drawn in by the feat, like the many Democratic senators seated on the floor, listened intently to Booker’s speech protesting the Trump administration – not only to witness history, but also for a seemingly much-needed morale boost for a party locked out of power in Washington.\n\nWhen Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer rose, more than 24 hours into the New Jersey Democrat’s remarks, to announce that a new record had been set, Booker received a thunderous standing ovation that made the typical staid chamber feel more like a campaign rally.\n\nSuch expressions from the galleries usually are met with an admonishment from the presiding officer. But in this case, Republican Sen. John Curtis of Utah, sensing the moment, let it pass uninterrupted.\n\nIn recent weeks, Democratic lawmakers have faced angry voters in their home states who feel their party hasn’t done enough to fight back against President Donald Trump and the Republican majority in Congress.\n\nBooker’s remarks were part detailed policy critique of what he said the Trump administration is doing wrong and part soul-searching for what he thinks the Democratic Party needs to do to regain power. Democrats say the historic display was the jolt of energy their base needed, acknowledging that it’s what voters want to see from their party.\n\nThe New Jersey senator received more than 28,000 voicemails of encouragement, according to his office, and at one point, more than 300,000 people were tuned in across social media platforms to watch his speech.\n\n“I was healing during the journey, because clearly, Democrats have made a lot of mistakes,” Booker told CNN’s Manu Raju on Wednesday, pointing to the the party’s sinking performance across the country in 2024.\n\n“Look, we lost elections,” he said.\n\n“There was a noble contest in this country for whose ideas, vision, communication, and we lost. We lost the Senate, we lost the House. And so I learned in college football, like, when you lose, don’t lose the lessons,” he continued, adding that Democrats “don’t have a singular leader” and are “a fractured party.”\n\nSupporters of Sen. Cory Booker gather outside the US Capitol as he speaks on the Senate floor in Washington, DC, on April 1. Roberto Schmidt/AFP/Getty Images\n\nBooker, who told Raju his “spirit is soaring” despite his weary body, said he didn’t know whether his speech will impact how his party strategizes its response to Trump and congressional Republicans. But, he said, “I’m hopeful again.”\n\nPeople have written Booker letters with their fears about Trump’s actions, he said, noting: “Their anxiety is raising.”\n\n“They want to see us fight. They want to see us use whatever tools we have,” Democratic Sen. Adam Schiff of California told CNN of voters.\n\nSen. Richard Blumenthal told CNN that he’s heard from “hundreds” of his constituents in Connecticut and around the country about “the spirit and energy that Senator Booker’s speech evoked.”\n\n“It’s not just the length of time, but the substance and spirit behind that speech that are really evoking a lot of energy at this point from Democratic supporters,” he explained.\n\nAppearing on CNN, pollster and communication strategist Frank Luntz noted the Democratic Party’s record low favorability numbers and suggested Booker’s speech amounts to “a reset.”\n\n“It’s a narrow approach that says we can do better, and it humanizes these issues. And he said, we need leaders, not from Washington, but from the citizenry. And that was a powerful statement to me. I know that’s what Democrats are waiting to hear,” he said.\n\nHouse Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries, who watched Booker’s speech from the Senate floor Tuesday night as it became clear he would break the record, told reporters the speech “will be one of those moments that will continue to energize people across the country.”\n\n“Above all else, he spoke from the heart, because this is a moment that requires every single one of us to stretch in ways that we may not have previously been called upon to do. And Cory Booker did it at an extraordinary level,” he told reporters Wednesday.\n\nAfter yielding the Senate floor, having spoken for 25 hours and 5 minutes, Booker told reporters that “there’s a lot of people out there asking Democrats to do more and to take risks and do things differently.”\n\n“I just think a lot of us have to do a lot more, including myself.”\n\nCNN’s Manu Raju, Morgan Rimmer and Alison Main contributed to this report.",

        "source": "https://www.cnn.com/",
        "content": "Boston CNN —\n\nRümeysa Öztürk, the Turkish student detained by immigration officers in Boston last month, was moved across multiple state lines as part of a “highly unusual” and “secretive” attempt to keep her from accessing her attorney or being near her home, her attorneys charged Wednesday.\n\nIn documents filed with the federal district court in Boston, attorneys for Öztürk accused the federal government of targeting the Tufts University graduate student because of her advocacy for Palestinian rights – a violation of Öztürk’s constitutionally protected right to free speech.\n\nAttorneys filed the petition late Wednesday, asking the court to assert jurisdiction over the case or “at the very least” transfer it to Vermont – the last place where Öztürk was taken before a final transfer to Louisiana.\n\n“Ms. Öztürk’s counsel was kept in the dark about her client’s whereabouts as ICE quickly and quietly moved her to three separate locations in three different states on her way to Louisiana,” the attorneys wrote. “ICE’s deliberate and secretive hopscotch approach is an unlawful attempt to game the system.”\n\nDocuments show Öztürk was detained near her home close to Tufts’ Somerville campus, put into an SUV by masked officers and driven to several “undisclosed locations in a short period.”\n\nÖztürk was first taken to Methuen, Massachusetts, for 14 minutes, then to Lebanon, New Hampshire, for about two and a half hours, and finally to St. Albans, Vermont.\n\nAttorneys for Öztürk also accuse the government of ignoring an initial court order requiring them not to move her from the district without providing the court at least 48 hours’ notice.\n\n“Despite this order, ICE moved Öztürk to multiple locations and eventually to Louisiana without notifying the court, her counsel, or government counsel, thereby violating the court’s directive,” the lawyers wrote.\n\nThe documents are in response to a motion filed by the US attorney’s office in Boston, which is seeking to dismiss the case to Louisiana, where Öztürk is currently held.\n\nIn their filing, attorneys for Öztürk also challenge the legality of her detention. They ask the court to release her, citing the extraordinary circumstances of the case, Öztürk’s lack of access to asthma medicine and because she is not a flight risk or danger to the community.\n\n“Ms. Öztürk is a scholar and cherished member of her academic community. As Ms. Öztürk’s friends and colleagues attest, she is a welcoming and compassionate member of her department, the Muslim Students Association, and the Interfaith Center at Tufts,” the lawyers wrote.\n\nÖztürk’s motion for release is supported by Tufts University.\n\nIn a declaration to the court, university President Sunil Kumar said Öztürk’s arrest has paralyzed the school’s international community, which now fears for its safety.\n\n“The University has heard from students, faculty and staff who are forgoing opportunities to speak at international conferences and avoiding or postponing international travel,” Kumar said in his declaration. “In the worst cases, many report being fearful of leaving their homes, even to attend and teach classes on campus.”\n\nKumar’s declaration marks the first time a school has publicly defended one of its students in court.\n\nSeveral international students have been detained as part of Trump’s immigration crackdown. Separately, the Trump administration has threatened federal funding cuts for several US universities.\n\nIn his declaration, Kumar also said the op-ed Öztürk wrote a last year – which was critical of the school’s response to the Israel-Hamas war – was well within the school’s guidelines and did not violate any rules.\n\n“The University has no information to support the allegations that she was engaged in activities at Tufts that warrant her arrest and detention,” Kumar said. “The University has seen an outpouring of support for Ms. Öztürk over the last week from Tufts students, faculty and staff.”\n\nFederal district court judge Denise Casper ordered oral arguments at a hearing scheduled for Thursday.\n\nCNN’s Gloria Pazmino wrote and reported from New York, and Bob Crowley contributed from Boston.",

        "title": "Why prosthetics are on the rise in fashion",
        "source": "https://www.cnn.com/",
        "content": "CNN —\n\nFor his Fall-Winter 2025 show at Paris Fashion Week, Dutch designer Duran Lantink continued to break the mold with his offbeat designs. Set in an office space that wouldn’t look out of place in the science fiction thriller “Severance,” the collection featured silhouettes with warped proportions, as well as eye-catching styles that included zany animal prints and butt-revealing jeans.\n\nBut it was two prosthetic torsos that stole the show. First, was a chiseled six-pack sported by model Mica Argañaraz. Then came the buxom climax: Chandler Frye, an emerging male model, wore a pair of big, bouncing breasts.\n\nVideos of Lantink’s outrageous antics racked up millions of views on social media as commenters argued over whether it championed gender-fluidity or ridiculed femininity. For Lantink, it was about toying with the idea of humans as dolls. “I love the idea of women as action figures,” he wrote in the show notes.\n\nPerhaps so, but it also tapped into a growing trend on the runways: prosthetics. In recent seasons, fashion brands including Martine Rose, Collina Strada and Balenciaga have used implants, masks and 3D makeup techniques to transform models into animals, aliens and cyborgs. Most memorably, Stockholm-based fashion label Avavav, known for its madcap latex creations, made a wearable replica of Kim Kardashian’s backside out of silicone.\n\nCollina Strada worked with makeup artist Isamaya Ffrench to create animalized facial prosthetics for its Autumn-Winter 2023 show. Albert Urso/Getty Images\n\nMakeup artist Inge Grognard created accentuated cheekbones for the models in Balenciaga's Spring-Summer 2020 show. Victor Virgile/Gamma-Rapho/Getty Images\n\n“(Designers are using) prosthetics to challenge beauty norms and explore transformation and identity, creating a broader cultural narrative,” said Tanya Noor, a course leader of the Hair, Makeup and Prosthetics for Performance undergraduate program at London College of Fashion, over an email.\n\nStriking, lifelike results\n\nThe oldest known medical prosthetics (two artificial toes) date back to ancient Egypt, where they were used as walking aids. Approximately 300 years later, in 300BC, came the first known prosthetic leg; made from bronze and wood, it was thought to have been worn by a Roman nobleman. Following the American Civil War in 1860, more advanced wooden limbs with rubber cushioning were created to meet the needs of new amputees.\n\nThen, prosthetics were adopted for the purpose of art and entertainment. At the dawn of cinema, in 1895, prosthetics were created through a crude concoction of materials including gum, cotton and wax. By the 1930s, the invention of foam latex saw rubber masks become commercially available for the first time thanks to prop maker Don Post, earning him the moniker “The Godfather of Halloween.” For the first time, lifelike faces were readily available for both performers and punters. Elsewhere, prosthetics came to play a key role in the art form of drag, where performers use prosthetic breastplates and hip pads to show varying forms of femininity.\n\nDoja Cat turned to facial prosthetics as she attended the 2023 Met Gala dressed as the late Karl Lagerfeld's beloved cat. Dimitrios Kambouris/Getty Images\n\nToday, the results are more striking than ever: the 2024 horror film “The Substance” won an Oscar for the prosthetics worn by actors Demi Moore and Margaret Qualley to achieve visceral looks (though Qualley later revealed that the prosthetics caused her skin damage that took a year to recover).\n\nThey’ve become a bigger part of red carpet fashion, too. Malina Stearns, a special effects makeup artist, masterminded Doja Cat’s look at the 2023 Met Gala, where the popstar embodied Karl Lagerfeld’s beloved cat in a custom Oscar de la Renta gown and facial prosthetics. Stearns has also worked with musicians on other creations including the alien that featured in Sabrina Carpenter’s 2024 VMAs performance, SZA’s bug-eyed album cover and the crocodile-inspired cheeks and chest pieces worn by Doechii.\n\nLantink isn’t the only one to use prosthetics to subvert gender norms, either. “I’ve applied many fake boobs to men and vice versa,” Stearns said, over email.\n\nOn and off the runway\n\nWhile materials such as latex are still industry standard when it comes to prosthetics, 3D scanning and printing is allowing for even more complex creations. And fashion, increasingly taking cues from the world of entertainment, is now raiding its props department.\n\nIn 2019, Balenciaga worked with makeup artist Inge Grognard to create extremely accentuated cheekbones and pouts on the models who walked its runway show. Visual artist and photographer Nadia Lee Cohen used an array of prosthetics, wigs and costumes to change into 33 characters for her 2022 “HELLO My Name Is” project, as she reimagined the person behind each name tag found in a thrift shop. Meanwhile, drag queen Alexis Stone regularly attends Paris Fashion Week as a different celebrity doppelganger each season (most recently, she transformed into Adele, a process which took six weeks of research, sculpting and makeup).\n\nAlexis Stone attended Balenciaga's 2024 Haute Couture show in Paris dressed as Miranda Priestly, the fictional character from \"The Devil Wears Prada.\" Claudio Lavenia/Getty Images\n\nA longtime proponent of prosthetics, makeup artist and entrepreneur Isamaya Ffrench has turned models into elfin-eared creatures for Burberry; extraterrestrials for Paco Rabanne; and animals for Collina Strada. “The (Spring-Summer 2023) show was about breaking down the artificial barriers we put up between ourselves and the planet. So, the idea of transforming models into these hybrid human-animals just felt right,” said Collina Strada’s founder Hillary Taymour over email.\n\nThe prosthetics were purchased from a props studio, and then hand-painted and pierced, to “feel organic and slightly uncanny,” said Taymour. She had hoped for them to be “wearable in a high-fashion way” and not come across as gimmicky or party shop fodder. “These weren’t just masks; they were full-on transformations,” she said.\n\nArtistic expression, or something more?\n\nWhen used in fashion, prosthetics have served as commentary on a reality where fillers and facelifts have become more commonplace. Martine Rose sent models with fake noses down the runway at Milan Fashion Week last June in a bid to challenge Eurocentric beauty standards. “The first thing you see in people is often their nose. And it is often the first thing they change about themselves,” she told Vogue.\n\nHowever, Stearns observed that while a “plastic surgery look is always popular and people want to enhance (their appearance),” the rise of prosthetics in fashion may have more to do with “art than cosmetics.” While cosmetics procedures are typically undertaken discreetly to enhance or conceal features, the prosthetics used on the runway are frequently designed to be noticed — a key draw for designers vying to create standout, scroll-stopping moments. “The desire to create eye-catching content and viral moments lends itself well to the combination of fashion and prosthetics,” Noor said.\n\nTaymour views prosthetics as a canvas for artistic expression. “Fashion has always been about identity play, but prosthetics take it to another level,” she said. “They let us completely rewrite the human form — why stop at styling clothes when you can style bodies?”\n\nSabrina Carpenter performed onstage at the 2024 MTV Video Music Awards alongside an alien figure created using prosthetics. Christopher Polk/Billboard/Getty Images\n\nMollie Gibb, a lecturer of the aforementioned hair, makeup and prosthetics course in London, echoed this sentiment, saying that prosthetics are a way for hair and makeup artists to create looks “in line with the statements that the clothes are making.”\n\nSome practical and progressive solutions have appeared on the runway. Alexander McQueen’s Spring-Summer 1999 show featured a Paralympic athlete and double amputee wearing carved prosthetic legs. More recently, emerging designer Zhongzhi Ding created jeans with a built-in penis (complete with a workable urethral) made from sponge. They were inspired by Tom of Finland, an artist known for creating highly masculinized homoerotic art, and aimed at transgender men who want to wear gender-affirming clothing.\n\nDing linked the rising interest in prosthetics to body image anxiety. Over email, he shared his belief that “in the future, (there will be) a demand for prosthetics targeting more body parts.” For the most part, though, prosthetics in fashion remain a work of fantasy over utility.\n\nTaymour thinks there’s scope for prosthetics to “go beyond just the face and hands” and “be used in full silhouette transformations” that also include dynamic movement. “Right now, a lot of prosthetics are static, but imagine if they had animatronics or soft robotics built in — like a dress that breathes or a tail that sways,” she mused. “Fashion should always have a sense of fantasy, so let’s take it even further.”",

        "content": "Hong Kong CNN —\n\nPresident Donald Trump unveiled 54% tariffs on all Chinese imports into the United States Wednesday as part of his sweeping “Liberation Day” reset of American trade global policy.\n\nThe tariffs on China, the second top importer to the US behind Mexico, are poised to push a major reset of relations and escalate a trade war between the world’s two largest economies.\n\nChina has repeatedly vowed to continue to retaliate against American trade restrictions.\n\nWednesday’s announcement adds 34% “reciprocal” tariffs to existing 20% duties on all Chinese imports to the US. Since returning to power in January, Trump had already levied two tranches of 10% additional tariffs on all Chinese imports, which the White House said was necessary to stem the flow of illicit fentanyl from the country to the US.\n\nTo skirt existing tariffs, some Chinese companies have shifted production to other Asian countries. But Trump’s new reciprocal tariffs on other Asian nations announced Wednesday will hurt China, too: Vietnam will face levies of 46% and Cambodian goods will be tariffed at 49%.\n\nTrump unveiled the measures during an address in the White House’s Rose Garden, where he separately announced an additional 10% duties on all imports to the US and a host of country-specific measures that hit Asian countries particularly hard.\n\nThe 54% minimum tariffs that Trump imposed on China are higher than many analysts’ expectations and reach close to the upwards of 60% levies that he had threatened to impose on the country during his election campaign.\n\nSpeaking to Russian media in Moscow earlier this week ahead of the announcement, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said Beijing would “counterattack” if the US continues to engage in “blackmail” over tariffs.\n\n“‘America First’ should not be American bullying, and it should not build its own interests on the basis of damaging the legitimate rights and interests of other countries,” Wang told Russian state media, according to Chinese state broadcaster CCTV.\n\nChina responded swiftly to the previous rounds of tariffs imposed by the Trump administration this year, slapping its own targeted duties on US imports including certain agriculture products and fuels.",

Hasbany, who is non-binary, told CNN in a phone interview that they primarily used vintage mohair and yarns sourced from eBay to hand-crochet eight different pieces which they stitched together in the final silhouette – along with a pair of boots.\n\nThey stuffed the curves with padding to give it shape, though Hasbany said they tried to keep it “relatively light” so as not to restrict Badu’s performance. The designer often experiments with form and the exaggerated shapes hand-made knits can take.\n\nBut on social media, the musician’s outfit choice proved divisive — with some claiming Badu was mocking Brazilian Butt Lifts, a surgery that has exploded in popularity in the last decade. Others suspected there was more history to the bodacious look.\n\nSome commenters believed the crocheted silhouette was a homage to Sarah Baartman, whose image has become an emblem for colonial exploitation. Baartman was an African woman who spent years in European “freak shows” as an exhibited attraction for her large buttocks, and after her death, scientists used her remains to promote racist theories surrounding those of African ancestry. “I thought of Sarah Baartman the entire time,” commented singer Tanerélle on Badu’s Instagram post.\n\n“I’m so sad that so many (Black people) really don’t know their history,” wrote another user.\n\nOthers drew comparisons to Venus of Willendorf, a voluptuous female figurine dating back to 28,000–25,000 BCE. Experts have long debated the meaning of the 4-inch sculpture, though it is widely regarded to have been seen as a symbol of attractiveness and fertility.\n\n“It’s Venus,” wrote one user on X. “Oh my god, please put art education back into the schools.”\n\nThough Badu shared a Venus-related theory on her Instagram Stories, Hasbany says it’s up to the singer to decide whether she wants to disclose the outfit’s meaning. The designer did reveal, however, that there were “a lot of different reference points.” In the end, they’re glad to see people making their own interpretations about what the look could be paying tribute to.\n\n“It’s amazing to see discourse around femininity and how people interpret feminine bodies, especially for Black women,” said Hasbany. “We should be talking about both historical context and current context.”\n\nSome social media users theorized that the bold one-piece engages with Black history. Christopher Polk/Billboard/Getty Images\n\nThe look held personal significance for the designer, too, as it was informed by their perspective and experiences as a non-binary person. “A lot of my work comes from working through my own gender dysphoria and creating bodies and figures outside of myself to kind of work through those feelings.”\n\nHasbany first met Badu when the singer, an alumna of their high school, organized an annual performance there in 2020. Hasbany showed up to dance auditions in one of their early designs, which Badu ended up buying. Now, they plan to feature the “booty suit” in their graduate collection at Central Saint Martins.\n\n“It’s been so impactful for me as a young artist to have someone who really has my back,” they said. “I think we really have a kinship, and really similar world views and taste.”",

        "title": "Key takeaways from Trump’s ‘Liberation Day’ tariffs",
        "source": "https://www.cnn.com/",
        "content": "Washington CNN —\n\nPresident Donald Trump on Wednesday unveiled expansive new tariffs in a major escalation of his trade war, referring to the historic move as a “declaration of economic independence.” Trump’s risky bet to address unfair trade practices could send prices higher for American consumers and weaken economic growth, according to most economists.\n\nUsing national emergency powers, Trump announced 10% tariffs on all imports into the United States, and even higher tariffs on goods from about 60 countries or trading blocs that have a high trade deficit with the US. That includes China and the European Union, which will be levied new duties of 34% and 20%, respectively.\n\nTrump’s latest actions represent the most significant escalation in US tariffs in nearly a century, since the Smoot-Hawley Act of 1930. But the trade spat doesn’t end there.\n\nForeign countries, including long-time US allies, say Trump’s tariffs won’t go unanswered, setting the stage for a global, tit-for-tat trade war that could quickly spiral out of control. Such a development would only fuel inflation further and weigh on US consumers, many of whom are already on the ropes.\n\nTrump’s “Liberation Day” announcement did little to clear the dense fog of uncertainty. And even more tariffs by sector are coming down the pike, senior White House officials said Wednesday on a phone call with reporters.\n\nHere are key takeaways from Trump’s sweeping tariff hike.\n\nNew tariffs have entered the chat\n\nTrump’s so-called reciprocal tariffs won’t match the ones foreign countries impose on the United States unless a country already had a 10% US tariff. They also won’t stack on top of existing duties by sector.\n\n“We will charge them approximately half of what they are and have been charging us, so the tariffs will be not a full reciprocal,” Trump said from the Rose Garden on Wednesday afternoon. “I could have done that, I guess, but it would have been tough for a lot of countries and we didn’t want to do that.”\n\nFor example, instead of matching the European Union’s 39% tariff on US goods, the new duty on the EU will be 20% instead. China, which was already slapped with a 20% tariff for its role in fentanyl trade, will be levied an additional 34% — half of the 67% tariff it imposes on the US — bringing its new rate to 54%.\n\nAbout 60 countries will see tariffs higher than 10%. The baseline 10% tariff goes into effect on Saturday, one minute after midnight, then any higher tariffs will go into effect on April 9.\n\nThe new tariffs won’t add on to tariffs previously announced on steel, aluminum and cars.\n\nThe 25% tariff on goods from Mexico and Canada that don’t comply with the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement will remain in place until Trump determines that issues around fentanyl and illegal immigration have been resolved. Whenever that happens, Canada and Mexico will then default to the administration’s current trade approach for other countries.\n\nSenior White House officials said Trump also wants to levy separate tariffs on semiconductors, pharmaceuticals and critical minerals, to be announced at a later date.\n\nForeign countries promise to respond\n\nSeveral countries have signaled that they will respond to Trump’s tariffs, and the International Chamber of Commerce said on Wednesday that there’s “a clear systemic risk to the global trading system” if trade tensions reach a fever pitch.\n\nChina, Japan, and South Korea said on Sunday they will respond to the new duties in lockstep. All three countries will be levied duties higher than 20%.\n\nMexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said she will unveil a broad economic plan on Thursday in response to Trump’s tariffs, which will include steps to protect the country’s automotive industry.\n\nVarious European leaders chimed in after Trump’s announcement, also pledging to respond after they study what the new tariffs will mean for their countries. Karin Keller-Sutter, president of the Swiss Federation, posted on X that the country’s officials “will quickly determine the next steps.”\n\nAfter Trump’s announcement, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said the new tariffs will “fundamentally change the international trading system” and that “we’re going to fight these tariffs with counter measures.”\n\n“Sit back, take a deep breath, don’t immediately retaliate,” US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told CNN’s Kaitlan Collins in an interview. “Let’s see where this goes, because if you retaliate, that’s how we get escalation.”\n\nHe warned other countries that “doing anything rash would be unwise.”\n\nSkittishness on Wall Street and Capitol Hill\n\nReaction was swift from some corners: US stocks plummeted in after-hours trading and US senators voted on a Democrat-led measure to rebuke Trump’s trade policy.\n\nDow futures shed more than 900 points by early evening, or 2.19%; while S&P 500 futures lost 3.38% and futures tied to the Nasdaq 100 tumbled 4.28%. The futures rout was widespread, with shares in Apple, Nike, and Walmart — companies with supply chains that criss cross the globe — all taking a dive.\n\n“President Trump just finished his tariff speech at the White House and we would characterize this slate of tariffs as ‘worse than the worst case scenario’ the Street was fearing,” said Dan Ives, senior analyst at Wedbush Securities, in a note.\n\nAs expected, Democrats were up in arms over Trump’s tariffs throughout Wednesday.\n\n“Republicans are crashing the American economy in real time and driving us to a recession,” House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries said in a news conference. “This is not Liberation Day, it’s Recession Day.”\n\nMeanwhile, Rep. Greg Meeks of New York, the top Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said Wednesday that he plans to force a vote over tariffs in the coming days using a procedural maneuver that can be used to bypass leadership and force floor votes. His previous efforts to force a floor vote over tariffs have all been thwarted by GOP leadership before.\n\nAmerican businesses are bracing for the fallout\n\nTariff hikes inflict higher costs on US-based importers, which are typically passed on to American businesses. Many of them said on Wednesday they’re bracing for the fallout of Trump’s latest actions.\n\n“It’s concerning, it’s going to be expensive, it’s going to require us all to make decisions,” Benjamin Colvin, president and co-founder of Devil’s Foot Brewing in Asheville, North Carolina, said Wednesday at a news conference with other business owners in the state.\n\nColvin said that his company, which produces craft sodas and zero-proof cocktails, has already seen production costs ratchet higher since Trump slapped tariffs on aluminum and steel.\n\nTrump tariffs would affect a vast number of companies, including grocery stores, which sell various imported items.\n\n“Our food system is intricately linked with global markets — including products not grown in the United States like bananas or seasonal items — which helps keep prices down while providing American shoppers year-round access to safe, nutritious food,” Leslie Sarasin, president and chief executive officer of The Food Industry Association, said Wednesday in a statement.",

        "title": "Snubbing Trump, bipartisan group of senators votes against Canada tariffs",
        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "In short order, Donald Trump has done extraordinary harm to the relationship between the United States and Canada. There are plenty of lawmakers on Capitol Hill — in both parties — who believe the president is on the wrong track, especially when it comes to trade tariffs on our allies north of the border.\n\nWith this in mind, Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia has championed a privileged resolution that would terminate the president’s Feb. 1 emergency declaration, which the White House used to issue tariffs on Canada. It would also, of course, eliminate the need for Canada’s retaliatory tariffs on American products.\n\nThe question has long been whether Kaine, whose measure was co-authored with Democratic Sens. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and Mark Warner of Virginia, could pick up a handful of Republican supporters to clear the upper chamber. That question now has an answer.\n\nThe Senate voted 51-48 to pass the resolution, with four Republicans — Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Mitch McConnell and Rand Paul of Kentucky and Susan Collins of Maine — joining all 47 Democrats in support.\n\nThe outcome is striking, though it’s not altogether surprising. Paul, for example, is a longtime tariff critic and co-sponsor of Kaine’s resolution, while Collins and Murkowski signaled their support for the Democratic measure ahead of the floor vote.\n\nOf particular interest, though, was McConnell, who is retiring next year and has become an occasional thorn in the White House’s side, and who’s likely to face another round of hysterical criticisms from the Oval Office.\n\nAs a practical matter, the fact that Kaine’s resolution passed won’t have any immediate policy implications: The measure will now head to the GOP-led House, where it will very likely go ignored.\n\nThat said, as a Politico report summarized it, losing this vote represents “the most significant rebuke to Trump that congressional Republicans have yet mustered in his second term.”\n\nIt’s precisely why Trump recently began lobbying aggressively against Kaine’s resolution, publishing an item to his social media platform that said a Senate vote in support of the measure would be “devastating for the Republican Party.”\n\nIn a follow-up item, the president wrote that GOP senators should “fight the Democrats wild and flagrant push to not penalize Canada for the sale, into our Country, of large amounts of Fentanyl, by Tariffing the value of this horrible and deadly drug in order to make it more costly to distribute and buy.” The missive suggested that Trump was under the impression that he’s imposing tariffs on fentanyl, which doesn’t make any sense.\n\nHe went on to write, “Why are they allowing Fentanyl to pour into our Country unchecked, and without penalty. What is wrong with them, other than suffering from Trump Derangement Syndrome, commonly known as TDS? Who can want this to happen to our beautiful families, and why?”\n\nTo the extent that reality still has any relevance in the debate, the idea that fentanyl is “pouring into” the United States is rather silly. In fact, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection, only 43 pounds of fentanyl were found crossing the northern border in 2024 — as opposed to 21,100 pounds seized at the southern border.\n\nFighting a trade war with a trusted ally and neighbor over fentanyl that could fit in a single suitcase is absurd. The president might not understand this, but a bipartisan majority of the Senate got it right.",

        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "House Speaker Mike Johnson suffered a humiliating blow from his own caucus on Tuesday when he failed to kill a proposal that would have allowed lawmakers who have just given birth to delegate a colleague to cast votes on their behalf.\n\nJohnson, a Louisiana Republican, was so put off by his tactical loss that he sent everyone in Congress home early for the week. The bizarre decision to tell all of his colleagues to pack it in was a rather obvious attempt to divert attention from his failure to control the chamber.\n\nThe outcome is embarrassing for Johnson, who used a strong-arm tactic to try to quell a mutiny over a relatively low-stakes issue, and then failed.\n\nLast year Rep. Anna Paulina Luna, R- Fla., who gave birth to a son in 2023, began to advocate for a House policy that would allow new mothers to appoint a colleague to vote on their behalf during the first six weeks after birth. There is currently no parental leave policy in Congress, and voting must be done in person. Luna's effort evolved as she worked with a bipartisan group of lawmakers, and the rule change movement has become a call for both new mothers and fathers to be able to exercise proxy voting for up to 12 weeks. But a major obstacle stood in her way: The leader of her own party in the House is strongly opposed to proxy voting, and has argued that it's unconstitutional and would be a slippery slope to an overly lax attitude toward proxy voting.\n\nLuna had a plan to force a vote on the issue this week and use a special maneuver to circumvent Johnson. She collected 218 \"discharge petition\" signatures, including from 11 Republicans, which allows her to bring the legislation directly to the floor without Johnson's backing. But Johnson then sought to pre-empt this with a special maneuver of his own: He used what The New York Times described as an \"unprecedented parliamentary maneuver\" to close off her path to forcing the vote. Except it didn't work.\n\nAs NBC News reports, it \"failed 206-222, with nine Republicans bucking Johnson and voting with all 213 Democrats.\" Notably, some of the Republicans who joined Luna in killing Johnson's effort in that vote were not even signatories to her petition.\n\nThe outcome is embarrassing for Johnson, who used a strong-arm tactic to try to quell a mutiny over a relatively low-stakes issue, and then failed. Johnson was immediately pouty: As he left the chamber he told reporters, \"That rule being brought down means that we can't have any further action on the floor this week.\"\n\nJohnson's move appears to have left a bitter taste in the mouth of some of his colleagues. Axios reports that \"several GOP lawmakers expressed a feeling that the speaker was being heavy-handed in trying to override the will of a majority of the House.\" Meanwhile Luna felt emboldened, calling it a \"historical day.\" And Rep. Brittany Pettersen, D-Colo., who was the lead author of the bill, said her message to the speaker was: \"Don’t f--- with moms.\" It also doesn't speak highly of Johnson's level of power in his party if he failed the first time he tried to pull off a major legislative move without Trump's backing. Johnson's decision to end business in Congress for the week came off as a transparent bid to avoid admitting defeat.\n\nOn a policy level, the demands of Luna, Pettersen and their allies in calling for 12 weeks of proxy voting seems sensible. Why would calling for parental-leave proxy voting lead to a \"slippery slope\" wherein proxy voting is abused endlessly? The rule change would be time-restricted and based on very specific, rare and important extenuating circumstances. And it would reflect an acknowledgement of the evolving cultural norms surrounding parenthood in the modern workforce.\n\nThen again, it is entirely apropos that Johnson would be unswayed by such arguments. The U.S., is after all, a global outlier in its refusal to mandate paid parental leave. As the Republican Party puts all its energy into attacking social programs that help vulnerable people, it would look rather odd for Johnson to seem supportive of young parents.",

        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "The Trump administration is slashing funds for museums and libraries, as a way to coerce these and other liberal arts institutions to bend to his movement’s will in a fashion reminiscent of Nazi Germany.\n\nWriting for MSNBC, sociologist Robyn Autry summed up the racism at play in a recent Trump recent executive order that targets the Smithsonian and expresses particular angst over an exhibit at the National Museum of African American History and Culture that educated visitors about racist pseudoscience.\n\nAutry wrote:\n\nOne of the things that has Trump angry is ‘The Shape of Power: Stories of Race and American Sculpture,’ an exhibit at the American Art Museum that innovatively positions nearly 100 sculptures alongside statements about scientific racism. That’s the discredited belief that there are biologically distinct races of people, with some more superior than others. The exhibition examines how artists and art objects have assisted, reflected or challenged such racist thinking since the 18th century, but Trump, in his executive order, expresses disappointment that the show ‘promotes the view that race is not a biological reality but a social construct.’\n\nNow is as good a time as any to read my previous reporting on Trump’s promotion of racist pseudoscience. His attack on the National Museum of African American History and Culture is one way the Trump administration is trying to enforce a racial hierarchy based on bigoted myths. Politico recently reported on another way Trump is trying to bring humanities-focused institutions to heel. In mid-March Trump signed an executive order that gutted the Institute of Museum and Library Services, which funds museums and libraries around the country.\n\nAccording to Politico:\n\nAn agency responsible for funding museums and libraries across the nation is the latest to be shrunk by President Donald Trump’s cuts to the federal government, with its entire staff apparently put on administrative leave Monday. The Institute of Museum and Library Services, which provides grants to ‘advance, support, and empower’ museums, libraries and similar institutions in the U.S. according to its website, was named in an executive order this month along with several other agencies. Trump’s order directed the Institute of Museum and Library Services ‘be eliminated to the maximum extent consistent with applicable law,’ shrinking it down to its statutory minimum.\n\nA Trump official reportedly told Politico that the cuts to the institute are necessary to “ensure hard-earned tax dollars are not diverted to discriminatory DEI initiatives or divisive, anti-American programming in our cultural institutions.”\n\nIn a letter seeking a meeting with the institute’s acting director, the Chief Officers of State Library Agencies said that money from IMLS accounts for “an average of one-third to over one-half of each State Library Agency’s annual budget.” And there’s been no suggestion from the Trump administration as to where else these libraries ought to get funding to account for the cuts the administration is making.\n\nWhat Trump appears to be after with his crackdowns on libraries and museums has some parallel in the way Hitler and the Nazi regime attacked similar institutions in Germany in the 1930s. What the Nazis accomplished with brute force, Trump and MAGA are attempting to do with economic and financial coercion.\n\nWhat the Nazis accomplished with brute force, Trump and MAGA are attempting to do with economic and financial coercion.\n\nBeginning in 1933, Nazis raided libraries for supposedly “un-German” books, some of which were publicly burned and derided as inappropriate for German consumption due to their content. Much like with the MAGA movement’s book-banning efforts, some of the books targeted by Nazis were written by minority groups, like Jews, or about the LGBTQ experience. (Back in 2023, the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum hosted an eye-opening discussion about this with Debra Caldwell-Stone, the director of the American Library Association’s Office of Intellectual Freedom.)\n\nIn 1937, the Nazis raided museums and seized artworks to place them in what they billed as a “degenerate” art exhibition, a propaganda effort meant to show the public that the Nazis would tolerate only the art that aligned with the party’s views. Defending this effort to suppress the arts, Joseph Goebbels, the minister of propaganda, claimed, “German art of the next decade will be heroic, it will be like steel, it will be romantic, non-sentimental, factual; it will be national with great pathos, and at once obligatory and binding, or it will be nothing.” Hitler himself denounced “degenerate” art pieces as those which “insult German feeling, or destroy or confuse natural form or simply reveal an absence of adequate manual and artistic skill.”\n\nThe U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum also explored the Nazis’ “degenerate art” exhibit in the short video below, noting that the point was for Hitler to wield power over non-governmental institutions to ensure they promoted “traditional German values” and the purported superiority of the “Aryan race.”\n\nWhile the methods may be different, the purpose of the Nazi attacks on libraries and museums was no different than Trump’s now. Such institutions are known as sites of free thought, imagination and innovation. At best, their content and collections encourages visitors to understand the world around them and the perspectives that shape it — forces like racist and anti-LGBTQ bigotry — and to envision ways to build a better world. And these things are a threat to regimes intent on policing thought and ensuring the masses comply with their revanchist, bigoted agenda.",

        "title": "YouTube star Ruby Franke's horrific crimes helped changed Utah’s family vlogging laws for kids",
        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "In a February Hulu documentary featuring Shari Franke, eldest child of the infamous mommy blogger Ruby Franke, Shari’s brother Chad and her father, Kevin, viewers are privy to behind-the-scenes video from the now-defunct family vlog. In one clip, Ruby smiles while recording herself before breaking off to scream at her family off-screen.\n\nThe documentary, titled “Devil in the Family: The Fall of Ruby Franke,” features several moments like this, moments that illustrate what detractors see as a wider phenomenon in which the family blogging industry is exposed for its many pitfalls and deceptions, particularly as it pertains to the protection and treatment of children.\n\nFor detractors of family vloggers and mom influencers, Franke’s arrest was proof positive that their suspicions were correct and something ominous was lurking under the perfect veneer of social media fame.\n\nIndeed, Utah, where the Franke family resided and recorded daily family life for years, has become the fourth state to legislate protections for influencer kids with the passing of HB 322 into law in March, following high-profile activism from Franke family members, who were YouTube family vlogging royalty before matriarch Ruby was arrested on charges of child abuse.\n\nRuby Franke and her estranged husband, Kevin Franke, were the head of the YouTube family channel “8 Passengers.” At its height, the channel commanded more than 2 million subscribers. In her content, Ruby Franke often touted strict parenting, like the time she infamously refused to bring her 6-year-old daughter lunch after the child had forgotten it or when her teenage son was made to sleep on a beanbag for months as a punishment. In 2023, Franke and her business partner, Jodi Hildebrandt, were arrested on charges of child abuse after Franke’s 12-year-old son escaped from Hildebrandt’s house. The child appeared emaciated and had wounds on his wrists and ankles. Franke’s 9-year-old daughter was found in a closet of Hildebrandt’s house, in a similar state. Hildebrandt and Franke each pleaded guilty to four counts of felony child abuse, for which they were sentenced to up to 30 years in prison.\n\nThe fallout of Ruby Franke’s arrest was intense. For detractors of family vloggers and mom influencers, Franke’s arrest was proof positive that their suspicions were correct and something ominous was lurking under the perfect veneer of social media fame. Anti-vlogging advocates had the feeling that the bottom was finally falling out of a deeply rotten industry. Buffeted by the moment, Shari Franke, the eldest child of Ruby Franke, spoke in front of the Utah Legislature, saying, “There is no ethical or moral family vlogger.”\n\nIn the wake of the Franke family tragedy, calls for protections for kids of influencers have intensified. Though people often assume that child influencers are covered under legal protections for child actors, they’re not. In 46 of 50 states, it’s legal for parents to feature their kids in monetized or sponsored content without paying the children for their labor.\n\nIt’s particularly impactful for Utah, of all states, to have passed legislation for the privacy and profits of influencer kids, as experts often point to Utah as a hot spot for mom influencers, family vloggers and kid influencers. There’s an entire book to be written about why Mormon people are so drawn to influencing — and why they’re often so successful at it, including the fact that recordkeeping and scrapbooking are mainstay traditions of the Mormon faith, skills that lend themselves to content creation — but the bottom line is that Utah is one of the most popular states for family vloggers and mom influencers. And though people who were raised as kid influencers aren’t a monolith, it’s important to listen to them when they speak about their experiences, like when Shari Franke told Rolling Stone, “Making money off your kids [with] no oversight as to how much the kids are getting paid — there’s no way to do that well for me.”\n\nI’m a journalist who covers family vloggers and mom influencers, and my take on their work is far from black-and-white. I don’t believe that showing your kid online is immoral in itself. We shouldn’t conflate the horrors of Ruby Franke’s story with the lives of every kid featured in their influencer parents’ content. And not every mom influencer and family vlogger are evil — far from it. But if there’s an industry that turns on the labor of kids, it makes sense to compensate them for their labor, at the very least.",

        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "As Election Day in Wisconsin’s closely watched state Supreme Court race neared, Republican megadonor Elon Musk summarized its perceived importance in dramatic terms. This one electoral contest, Musk said, could determine “the future of America and Western Civilization.” He added that he believes the race was likely to “affect the entire destiny of humanity.”\n\nA few days later, voters in the Badger State rendered their verdict — and it wasn’t the one Musk and other Republicans wanted to hear. As my MSNBC colleague Clarissa-Jan Lim summarized overnight:\n\nLiberal candidate Susan Crawford has won the Wisconsin Supreme Court election, NBC News projected Tuesday, preserving a liberal majority on the swing state’s highest court. Crawford, a circuit court judge in Dane County, defeated Brad Schimel, a Waukesha County circuit court judge and former Republican state attorney general.\n\nTechnically, the Wisconsin race was non-partisan, but the political battle lines were clearly drawn: Democrats rallied behind the progressive candidate, while Donald Trump and the GOP were heavily invested, literally and figuratively, in the conservative candidate.\n\nThe race — the most expensive judicial contest in the history of the United States — was expected to be close. It was not. With roughly 95% of the vote counted, Crawford appears to have prevailed by roughly 10 points.\n\nOn the surface, the news for Republicans was better in Florida, where GOP candidates won congressional special elections held in Republican strongholds. But here, too, the outcomes were unsettling for the party: The GOP representatives-elect won their races by roughly 14 points in districts where Republicans won by more than 30 points as recently as the 2024 cycle — just six months ago.\n\nWhat’s more, they ran against Democratic neophytes who raised a ton of money but who were, quite recently, expected to be crushed. Instead, GOP officials and their allies had to scramble to prevent upsets, as the Democratic candidates over-performed.\n\nThese races follow a series of other Democratic special election victories in recent weeks, including Democrats unexpectedly flipping two GOP-held state legislative seats in Iowa and Pennsylvania, as well as the White House abandoning Republican Rep. Elise Stefanik’s ambassadorial nomination last week because of fears that Democrats might win her seat — in a New York district that Trump won by 21 points.\n\nAs the dust settles on the most important electoral tests of Trump’s second term, we’ve learned a few things about the electoral landscape.\n\nMusk won’t save Republican candidates: The president’s top campaign donor spent millions in the hopes of pushing Schimel to victory in Wisconsin, and it backfired, with Democrats ultimately running against Musk, whom they accused of trying to buy the election. There’s a lesson here for GOP officials who’ve falsely assumed that Musk is popular with the American mainstream and who’ve operated from the assumption that the billionaire can help carry them across the finish line in 2026.\n\nDemocrats will be running against Musk a lot in the coming months: Trump’s unpopularity matters, but Musk’s unpopularity runs deeper. If you’re thinking the billionaire will be a centerpiece of Democratic messaging going forward, you’re right.\n\nRepublicans in competitive districts have reason to worry: The GOP thought it could run the 2024 playbook in a battleground state that Trump narrowly won, counting on that recipe to keep working. It failed badly. Republicans representing districts that were highly competitive last year are now confronted with a choice: Ignore the prevailing winds, stick with their party and hope for the best, or start putting some distance between themselves and the GOP.\n\nTrump’s endorsements are of limited value: Once again, Trump told voters to turn out for an ally. Once again, it didn’t matter. There’s no denying that the president has a loyal base, but to assume that base will necessarily rally behind his preferred candidates is a mistake.\n\nReassessing the Democratic “brand”: Democratic Sen. Michael Bennet of Colorado told NBC News over the weekend that his party’s brand is “problematic.” Around the same time, California’s Democratic governor, Gavin Newsom, said the Democratic brand is “toxic.” Days earlier, Democratic Sen. John Fetterman of Pennsylvania told Politico, “If we don’t get our s--- together, then we are going to be in a permanent minority.”\n\nMaybe so, but while some Democratic officials complain about the party’s reputation, Democratic candidates have been doing pretty well lately.\n\nIn the aftermath of Election Day 2024, the conventional wisdom suggested not only that Republicans had entered an era of electoral dominance, but also that Democratic voters were demoralized, disheartened and prepared to withdraw from civic life for a long while.\n\nA lot has changed in six months.",

        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "This is an adapted excerpt from the April 2 episode of “Morning Joe.”\n\nDuring his marathon speech on the Senate floor Tuesday, Sen. Cory Booker said, over and over again, that this is a moral moment in America: This is not about right or left, Democrat or Republican — this is about right and wrong.\n\nSome Republicans think the billionaire needs to be put in his place and that Trump needs to realize Musk is hurting him and the party.\n\nBooker’s remarks tapped into a real frustration present among voters. There is anger. There is depression. There is disappointment. But under it all, there is energy. People in this country don’t like what’s going on. They don’t like the way the United States is treating its allies. They don’t like people being deported without any due process. They don’t like that we’re going to have escalating costs and that our economy could end up in the ditch because of Donald Trump’s tariffs. And there’s a huge critical mass of people out there ready to act on that energy.\n\nWe saw it in action Tuesday in Wisconsin, where liberal candidate Susan Crawford won the state’s Supreme Court election and defeated the Trump- and Elon Musk-backed candidate, Brad Schimel. That result was a one-two punch for Republicans. It proved that Trump’s backing simply isn’t enough to get a candidate over the finish line. It also showed that Musk’s presence within the party is a big problem for Republicans. Musk poured millions into the race, which effectively became a referendum on him.\n\nAfter Tuesday, Democrats have a lot to feel excited and energized about: Speaker Mike Johnson suffered an embarrassing loss on the House floor, Booker commanded the country’s attention with that marathon speech, and the party secured a win in Wisconsin while seeing results out of red districts in Florida that were way closer than they should have been for Republicans.\n\nBut I wouldn’t be surprised if some GOP lawmakers in Washington also woke up cheering Wednesday morning. I wouldn’t be shocked if, behind the scenes, secretly some Republicans were fine with missing out on that Wisconsin Supreme Court seat because, just maybe, it could take Musk down a peg.\n\nRepublicans have gone home to their districts and heard what their constituents have had to say about Musk and his so-called Department of Government Efficiency. They know his cuts are widely unpopular and fear that what happened in Wisconsin could happen in their district next. Those Republicans are hoping Tuesday’s results could be the push Trump needs to put Musk in his place and realize just how much he’s hurting the party — before it’s too late.",

        "title": "Trump’s memes are meant to downplay the cruelty of his mass deportations",
        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "President Donald Trump’s administration is posting sadistic memes on its social media accounts to prompt the public to cruelly laugh at migrants caught up in his mass deportation obsession. For example, last week, the White House X account exploited a new ChatGPT feature that allows users to transform images “into the style of Studio Ghibli,” the beloved animation studio, and posted a cartoon version of a posted photo of a crying undocumented migrant in handcuffs. The responses to the post were a mix of delight from supporters and horror from critics, and the practice illustrates how Trump knows he must dehumanize migrants to justify his aggressive and increasingly extralegal efforts to deport them.\n\nTrump couches his messages in seemingly unserious or “comical” aesthetics online to downplay how sinister they are. As I’ve written in the past, Trump uses humor as a weapon, in part by dressing up his violations of norms and degradation of his opponents as a joke.\n\nThe White House chose an unsympathetic subject for its Studio Ghibli-style meme — a migrant who reportedly had been deported in the past after pleading guilty to attempted possession with intent to distribute fentanyl. But regardless of what that person did or where one stands on this particular deportation or deportations in general — brandishing people’s pain as a political message is not a defense of policy. Trump’s propaganda reveals that he delights in the pain of others, and he encourages the public to laugh with him.\n\nTrump’s social media team is making performative sadism a full-fledged comms strategy. In February the White House posted a video of migrants being deported with the text “ASMR: Illegal Alien Deportation Flight.\" The “joke” is that the viewer is supposed to find it soothing to hear the sounds of the jangling of handcuffs and chains on migrants and the starting rumble of the plane that will deport them. On Feb. 14, above an image that looked like a valentine with Trump’s and White House border czar Tom Homan’s heads surrounded by hearts, Trump posted, “Roses are red, violets are blue, come here illegally, and we’ll deport you,”\n\nTrump’s friends have struck similar notes. El Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele created a disturbing three-minute propaganda video, which he released after Trump initially deported alleged Venezuelan gang members to a brutal prison in his country. Operating in a similar emotional register as Trump’s memes, Bukele’s video depicts the brutalization of prisoners as part of an exciting action sequence and revels in an authoritarian aesthetic in its depiction of phalanxes of police officers. It’s easy to see why Trump and Bukele are natural partners on this issue. Each of them takes pleasure in seeing others publicly humiliated.\n\nTrump’s propaganda, which glories in the derision of those he terms “monsters,” is meant to help culturally authorize the extreme and potentially illegal measures he’s taking to deport them. The Trump administration is using flimsy evidence, circumventing due process and exploiting obscure provisions of immigration law to expel as many people as the administration considers socially or politically undesirable as possible. There’s a parallel track between, in the cultural sphere, treating migrants as not fully human and deserving of our derisive laughter and, as official policy, treating them as a class of people who have no rights.",

        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., took the Senate floor on Monday at 7 p.m. ET and resolved to retain it “for as long as I am physically able.” He did so through the night and into the morning, reading out loud from letters and emails from the everyday Americans hurt by President Donald Trump’s arbitrary and painful spending cuts. Late Tuesday afternoon, Booker was still speaking, leaning on the podium at times, but determined to keep going.\n\nIt wasn’t technically a filibuster that Booker conducted. He wasn’t talking to delay a vote on any specific agenda item. Instead, Booker said, in giving his marathon speech, he was “disrupting the normal business of the United States Senate.” After watching his heroic 25-hour long effort, I say our country would be better off if promoting the values Booker lifted up was the normal business of the Senate.\n\n“These are not normal times in our nation,” Booker insisted at the start of his speech.\n\n“These are not normal times in our nation,” Booker insisted at the start of his speech. His rhetoric may have been a response to the growing pressure from Democratic voters to see the officials they elected show real resistance to Trump. A recent NBC News poll found “almost two-thirds of Democrats, 65%, say they want congressional Democrats to stick to their positions even if that risks sacrificing bipartisan progress, and just 32% want them to make legislative compromises with Trump.” Democrats were at an all-time low in popularity in that survey; only 27% of registered voters reported having a positive view of the party.Those numbers speak to a maddening thirst for leadership from Democratic political figures. I eagerly await behind-the-scenes reporting on Booker’s speech, including how much planning and coordination, if any, there was among Senate Democrats. The third-term senator chairs the caucus’ strategic communications committee, so I would guess he at least gave Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., a heads-up before he took the floor.\n\nSen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., on the Senate floor in Washington, D.C., on Tuesday. Senate Television\n\nBut when did Democrats realize that Booker speech was a rallying point for a party that has been lacking a guiding star for the last three months? Because the energy that Democrats were radiating around the time Booker had been speaking for over 20 hours wasn’t there when he first took the floor.Booker spent Monday night addressing a mostly empty chamber, but by Tuesday morning his Democratic colleagues had helped make his protest a team effort. “I yield for a question but retain the floor” became a catchphrase of sorts as a parade of his colleagues stepped up to ask him lengthy questions and keep the momentum going. There was no shortage of topics, as Booker responded to their prompts with stories of, say, the hardships veterans face thanks to cuts from Elon Musk and the Department of Government Efficiency. There were also questions and answers about the economic damage that Trump is causing, and expressions of empathy for people who were already struggling to get by and are now being left by Musk and Trump to fend for themselves.\n\nBut maybe what America needs right now is a little cringe, a recommitment to being genuine and earnest in our desire to help others.\n\nThe support Booker received from his colleagues made the marathon speech different from previous faux filibusters. When Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, held the floor to protest Obamacare in 2014, his fellow Republicans were confused and infuriated by his one-man stunt that would have no real impact on the debate. Booker’s speech wasn’t what was once referred to as a “gentleman’s filibuster,” a lengthy speech that doesn’t interrupt the Senate’s other business. Booker delayed at least one major Trump administration nomination as he spoke.“Is Cory cringe or is this refreshing?” a colleague messaged me at one point during Booker’s speech. The answer, as my colleague immediately noted, is “yes.” Booker can be the cringiest of senators, which is saying something, wearing his heart on his sleeve and brandishing an inspiring quote at every possible chance. His lack of cynicism can be off-putting in a time when doomerism is rampant and hope can feel like a lie in the face of harsh reality. But maybe what America needs right now is a little cringe, a recommitment to being genuine and earnest in our desire to help others.\n\nThe question is whether Democrats can keep this energy going beyond this specific moment. We need to see the party do this when there’s an inflection point, that is, when there’s a time where Republicans are demanding they move aside and they instead throw themselves upon the gears of the federal government. It makes little sense to engage in such a protest when the stakes are lower and not do so when they’re much higher.\n\nBooker has wrapped up his marathon speech, but if the Senate’s Democrats want to show their angry constituents that they’re listening, they cannot let the business of the Senate return to the old normal.",

        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "If you’d said to me three months ago that the United States could invade and occupy Greenland, I’d have likely checked your head for a tinfoil hat. But after Vice President JD Vance’s three-hour trip to a U.S. military base in Greenland, I’m starting to get concerned that Operation Arctic Freedom could be in the offing.\n\nVance’s brief sojourn to the autonomous territory, which is still part of the Kingdom of Denmark, was perhaps the most insane and inappropriate diplomatic foray ever conducted by an American official.\n\nIn short, the message was: ‘Nice island you got here ... it’d be a shame if something happened to it.’\n\nVance, accompanied by the national security adviser, Michael Waltz, and the energy secretary, Chris Wright, didn’t meet with Greenland’s prime minister or any other government officials. In fact, it’s not clear he encountered a single resident of the island. A planned meet-and-greet with Usha Vance, the vice president’s wife, was scrapped because U.S. officials couldn’t find any locals willing to meet publicly with the second lady — as well as because of fears that any public event would be marred by protests.\n\nVance instead stayed sequestered at a U.S. Army base where he openly criticized Denmark — which provides military protection for Greenland (at least for now) — and said the island was essential to U.S. national security. The vice president implicitly threatened the use of American military force to acquire it.\n\n“The president has said clearly he doesn’t think that military force is going to be necessary,” said Vance, “but he absolutely believes that Greenland is an important part of the security not just of the U.S. but of the world.”\n\nIn short, the message was: “Nice island you got here ... it’d be a shame if something happened to it.”\n\nAccording to Vance, the United States’ increasing its position in Greenland “has to happen” because “our friends in Denmark have not done their job in keeping this area safe” from Russian and Chinese encroachment. Vance’s warnings of Russian adventurism hit a bit hollow when you consider that the Trump administration is actively working to end Moscow’s diplomatic isolation since the 2022 invasion of Ukraine.\n\nBut the vice president’s menacing rhetoric follows a familiar and disturbing pattern. In January, before taking office, Trump refused to rule out economic or military coercion to take over the island. “It might be that you’ll have to do something,” he said at the time in reference to Greenland and the Panama Canal. In his address to a joint session of Congress last month, he said, “One way or another, we’re gonna get it.”\n\nOn the day of Vance’s trip, Trump declared in the Oval Office, “We need Greenland. ... We have to have Greenland. It’s not a question of ‘Do you think we can do without it?’ We can’t.”\n\nAnd during a little-noted news conference in March with Mark Rutte, the NATO secretary general, Trump dismissed Denmark’s territorial claims to Greenland and said ominously, “We have a couple of bases on Greenland already, and we have quite a few soldiers that — maybe you’ll see more and more soldiers go there. I don’t know.” (italics added)\n\nTrump then pointed to Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and asked, “What do you think about that, Pete? Don’t answer that, Pete. Don’t answer that question.”\n\nHow many times can Trump say he’s considering using the U.S. military to seize Greenland before we start taking him seriously?\n\nThe irony of Trump’s statement is that he can send additional U.S. troops right now to improve Greenland’s defenses. According to a 1951 defense agreement between the United States and Denmark, the United States is legally permitted to create new “defense areas ... necessary for the development of the defense of Greenland and the rest of the North Atlantic Treaty area, and which the Government of the Kingdom of Denmark is unable to establish and operate singlehanded.”\n\nHow many times can Trump say he’s considering using the U.S. military to seize Greenland before we start taking him seriously?\n\nIn other words, as Danish Foreign Minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen recently pointed out, if the Trump administration wants to ramp up the U.S. military presence in Greenland without taking control of the island, it’s well within its rights to do so. Rasmussen also noted that the Danish government announced a multibillion-dollar security package for Greenland in January, which included the acquisition of icebreakers and long-range drones, as well as additional personnel stationed on the Arctic island. None of this was mentioned in Vance’s remarks.\n\nThere’s also the matter of NATO, of which Denmark is a founding member. Any attack on Greenland would be considered an attack on all NATO countries — and the United States would be treaty-bound to defend it. What better security guarantee could there be for Greenland than the full weight of America’s military might if the island is attacked?\n\nIf Trump is genuinely concerned about Greenland and the potential for Russian and Chinese encroachment, there are plenty of steps that the United States can take to improve the security situation there. But Trump isn’t doing that. Rather than working with the Danish government and securing a greater military partnership, he is openly antagonizing it by declaring his desire to make Greenland part of the United States.\n\nThe reason seems rather simple yet also terrifying: Trump wants Greenland to become part of the United States. Period. He doesn’t care about Greenland’s security. He wants it for America. Indeed, Trump has been talking about making Greenland the 51st state since his first term as president. Back in 2019, he got in a public spat — and canceled a planned trip to Denmark — because then-Danish Prime Minister Mette Fredriksen refused to discuss selling the island to the United States.\n\nWhy does Trump want Greenland so badly? I suspect it’s the same reason he wants to annex Canada and reclaim the Panama Canal. It’s consistent with his propensity for slapping his name (always in giant letters) on garish, self-aggrandizing, yet oddly boring architectural monstrosities around the globe. It’s all about Trump’s ego.\n\nMost presidents seek policy legacies. For Barack Obama, it was health care; for Ronald Reagan, a smaller federal government; for Richard Nixon, détente with the communist world. Trump couldn’t care less about policy because his only genuine interest is himself. He wants to be able to point to America’s expanded territorial footprint and say, “I made Greenland the 51st state.”\n\nIndeed, at his news conference Friday, Vance unintentionally admitted that Trump’s ego is driving this process. Asked whether the United States “is very serious in its desire to acquire Greenland,” he said, “Well, the president said we have to have Greenland, and I think that we do have to be more serious about the security of Greenland. We can’t just ignore this place. We can’t just ignore the president’s desires.”\n\nAlas, Vance and those around Trump do have agency to ignore his desire to control Greenland. Instead, they indulge him — as they’ve done on his calls for annexing Canada and his disastrous trade war. How far is Trump willing to go? We don’t know, but if anyone thinks that a U.S. military attack on Greenland is outside the realm of possibility, they simply aren’t paying attention.",

        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "President Donald Trump is desperate to close a deal for a U.S.-based buyer to purchase TikTok. So desperate, in fact, that he has proposed giving China relief on tariffs if its government approves a deal. That proposal has predictably been panned by Democrats and Republicans alike.\n\nAfter all, Trump said he was placing tariffs on China largely to try to stop fentanyl from reaching the United States. The fact he’s willing to dangle a reduction in exchange for a TikTok deal shows how incoherent his talk about tariffs is and how eager he is to bring TikTok under America’s — and perhaps, by extension, his administration’s — control.\n\nAll the while, Big Tech elites and the companies they lead are circling TikTok like sharks, hoping they get their shot to sink their teeth into the app.\n\nLast year, I wrote about how rich right-wingers, including “Shark Tank” co-panelist Kevin O’Leary, have shown interest in a purchase. And now, Amazon has joined the list of suitors looking to buy the app.\n\nAccording to NBC News:\n\nAmazon has made a late bid to purchase TikTok, a person familiar with the ongoing White House-led discussions to identify a non-Chinese buyer for the social media app told NBC News. The bid, first reported by The New York Times, arrived this week, via a letter to Vice President JD Vance and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick. Given the last-minute timing, days before a Saturday deadline to stave off a ban of the app in the U.S., the bid is not being treated as serious, said the source, who was granted anonymity to share details of private negotiations.\n\nTikTok was set to be banned in January as a result of a bipartisan bill, signed last spring by President Joe Biden, that required the Chinese-owned app to be sold to an American-based owner or cease operating in the United States. The app’s owners didn’t meet that deadline, of course, and TikTok was briefly banned. But Trump defied the law when he took office, signing an executive order saying that he was instructing the Justice Department to not take action against TikTok for a period of 75 days, which ends Saturday.\n\nFor the record, legal experts have sounded the alarm on Trump’s authoritarian power grab in this case, although sadly, many TikTok fans have seemed indifferent to it as long as they can still have access to their favorite mind control device. Trump’s personal involvement in the negotiations has set up a possibility that TikTok, which like other apps has occasionally been plagued by a raft of propaganda and misinformation, might be sold to a MAGA-friendly owner who is sympathetic to conservatives’ rage over content moderation.\n\nOwnership by Amazon, the company owned by Jeff Bezos, certainly wouldn’t dispel concerns — mine, at least — that TikTok could become even more of a boon for Trump’s movement than it already has been.\n\nAmazon donated $1 million toward Trump’s inauguration, Bezos appeared onstage with the gaggle of Big Tech oligarchs at Trump’s inaugural ceremony, Amazon reportedly signed a sweetheart $40 million deal for the rights to distribute a documentary about with first lady Melania Trump, and Bezos’ changes at The Washington Post — which he also owns — have justifiably prompted speculation that he’s transforming it to become more friendly to Trump. Beyond that, the London-based Institute for Strategic Dialogue released a report in 2022 finding that Amazon’s recommendation algorithms were steering some people toward conspiracy theories and extremist content.\n\nTo put it mildly, that’s not great for a company looking to purchase what is arguably the most popular social media platform in the world. That said, there are other sharks in the water looking to sink their teeth into TikTok, and Trump is obviously champing at the bit to secure a buyer before Saturday.",

        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "When Florida Republicans made Dr. Joseph Ladapo the state’s surgeon general three years ago, the physician took on a multifaceted position. Indeed, Ladapo wouldn’t just serve as Florida’s surgeon general, he was also tasked with leading the state’s Department of Health, while simultaneously receiving a tenured faculty position at the University of Florida.\n\nHow’s that working out? The Alligator, the university’s student-run newspaper, reported this week on the controversial doctor’s tenure.\n\nLadapo’s work calendar shows monthslong stretches with little or no activity. Instead of attaining grants and conducting research, he spent his first year revising manuscripts and writing his memoir, ‘Transcend Fear,’ which details his skepticism of vaccines. He also promised to bring hundreds of thousands in research dollars from the University of California at Los Angeles, his previous employer. That never happened. ... A review of internal reports and public directories indicate Ladapo hasn’t secured any research grants for UF.\n\nThe same report, which has not been independently verified by MSNBC or NBC News, added that Lapado’s classroom contributions have been “sparse”; one of his proposed courses “has yet to materialize”; and there’s “little evidence” that the internal medicine program he was supposed to lead has done meaningful work.\n\n“Although UF leaders initially welcomed Ladapo, issues with absenteeism, funding shortfalls and clashes with colleagues quickly emerged,” the article added. (Ladapo and university representatives didn’t respond to The Alligator's requests for comment.)\n\nOfficials can’t say they weren’t warned.\n\nRevisiting our earlier coverage, Ladapo’s former supervisor at UCLA discouraged Florida officials from hiring the controversial doctor, saying that Ladapo relied on his opinions more than scientific evidence. The UCLA supervisor added that Ladapo’s weird theories “created a stressful environment for his research and clinical colleagues and subordinates,” some of whom believed the doctor “violated the duty in the Hippocratic Oath to behave honestly and ethically.”\n\nIt was not the first time Ladapo’s work at UCLA generated scrutiny. It was during his tenure in California when the physician also claimed in a USA Today op-ed that his perspective on Covid treatments had been shaped by his experience “taking care of patients with COVID-19 at UCLA’s flagship hospital.” Two weeks later, Ladapo added in a Wall Street Journal op-ed that he had his experience “caring for patients with suspected or diagnosed Covid-19 infections at UCLA.”\n\nThe Rachel Maddow Show's reporting later called those claims into question. As my colleague Kay Guerrero explained in a report, “Several former colleagues of Dr. Joseph Ladapo ... say he misled the public about his experience treating Covid-19 patients.”\n\nOne UCLA source also said, in reference to Ladapo, “A lot of people here at UCLA are glad that he is gone because we were embarrassed by his opinions and behavior. At the same time, we don’t wish this on the people of Florida. They don’t deserve to have someone like him making their health decisions.”\n\nA Florida Department of Law Enforcement report later told policymakers that Ladapo’s views led to “stress and acrimony among his coworkers and supervisors.” Soon after, the GOP-led legislature confirmed the physician anyway at the urging of Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis.\n\nWhile in office, Ladapo has made a wide variety of radical and potentially dangerous decisions, leading the editorial board of The Washington Post to conclude two years ago, “By playing loose with the facts, Dr. Ladapo ... betrayed the trust of the people of Florida and the nation.”\n\nThe University of Florida report, in other words, is striking — but not surprising.\n\nThis report updates our related earlier coverage.",

        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "Last week, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a conspiracy theorist whom Republicans put in charge of the Department of Health and Human Services, left little doubt that he would soon announce mass layoffs at the federal agency. Unfortunately, as NBC News reported, he did exactly that this week.\n\nThe Trump administration carried out mass layoffs across the Department of Health and Human Services on Tuesday, aiming to slash around 10,000 full-time jobs from the federal agencies long tasked with regulating food and drugs and overseeing the nation’s public health policies. Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency is trying to reduce HHS’ workforce from 82,000 to 62,000 across several agencies, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Food and Drug Administration and the National Institutes of Health.\n\nDr. Robert Califf, the former FDA commissioner, said the agency as Americans have come to know it, is now “finished.” The New York Times added that the agency has now lost nearly all of its traditionally nonpolitical experts on food, drugs, vaccines and medical devices.\n\nNBC News’ report added that the Trump administration also made “deep and wide-ranging cuts to divisions responsible for tackling HIV, improving minority health and preventing injury, such as gun violence. Jobs were eliminated at offices overseeing the approval of new drugs, providing health insurance and responding to infectious disease outbreaks.”\n\nThe Bulwark’s Jonathan Cohn explained, “The sheer breadth of the cuts is staggering: The layoffs affected agencies that exist to fight deadly pathogens, to protect the nation’s drug supply, to finance and carry out cutting-edge research — along with countless other divisions and offices that touch everything from rural health to early childhood care.”\n\nWendy Armstrong, director of infectious diseases at the University of Colorado, told Cohn, in reference to the Republican administration’s layoffs and cuts, “Americans will suffer, and people will die.”\n\nI suspect White House officials and their allies will argue that such assessments are overstated. We can all hope they’re right, but given the scope and scale of the decisions, there’s every reason to believe that there’s nothing hyperbolic about the estimations.\n\nWhat’s more, for Kennedy and his radical agenda, it’s the latest in a series of related steps. Indeed, the layoffs come on the heels of free measles vaccine clinics closing in Texas — during a measles outbreak — because of Kennedy’s HHS cuts.\n\nThat came on the heels of Dr. Peter Marks, who oversaw the FDA’s vaccine division as director of the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, resigning at least in part because of Kennedy promoting “misinformation and lies” in his claims about vaccine safety.\n\nWhich came on the heels of RFK Jr. making a bizarre choice to oversee research on the nonexistent connection between vaccines and autism.\n\nWhich came on the heels of news of some measles patients in Texas getting worse because people followed bad advice they got from Kennedy during a Fox News interview.\n\nWhich came on the heels of Kennedy decimating the agency leading the federal response to the opioid crisis.\n\nWhich came on the heels of the CDC’s former communications director writing a Washington Post op-ed in which he explained that career infectious-disease experts have been “tasked with spending precious hours searching medical literature in vain for data to support Kennedy’s preferred treatments,” adding that Kennedy and his team are “working to bend science to fit their own narratives, rather than allowing facts to guide policy.”\n\nWhich came on the heels of the CDC, falling in line with Kennedy’s agenda, burying a measles forecast that stressed the need for vaccinations.\n\nWhich came on the heels of Kennedy’s department abruptly canceling “more than $12 billion in federal grants to states that were being used for tracking infectious diseases, mental health services, addiction treatment and other urgent health issues.”\n\nWhich came on the heels of the department also canceling funding “for dozens of studies seeking new vaccines and treatments for Covid-19 and other pathogens that may cause future pandemics.”\n\nDid I mention that these developments — literally all of them — are from just the last week? Because they are.\n\nOn Tuesday, Republican Sen. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, who chairs the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, partnered with independent Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont in calling Kennedy to testify about his “proposed reorganization of the Department of Health and Human Services.”\n\nThat’s a worthwhile move, though I wish the hearing had been held before Kennedy started dismantling the nation’s public health infrastructure, not after.",

        "content": "Republican Randy Fine has won the special election in Florida’s 6th Congressional District, prevailing in the longtime Republican stronghold despite unexpectedly fierce competition from Democrat Josh Weil, NBC News projects.\n\nThe special election to fill the seat held by Michael Waltz, who left Congress to become President Donald Trump’s national security adviser, turned out to be unusually competitive. GOP leaders were alarmed that Weil, an educator, had outraised Fine, a state senator, by millions of dollars. Early voting data suggested strong Democratic turnout, though those numbers are typically unreliable indicators of the final results.\n\nDemocrats had steered clear of predicting that Weil would flip the seat, but his showing could signal trouble ahead for Republicans. Counties in the 6th Congressional District have long leaned red — Trump, who endorsed Fine, carried the district by more than 30 points in the 2024 election, while Waltz easily won re-election.\n\nFine was leading Weil 54%-46% when the NBC News Decision Desk projected him as the winner with 73% of the expected vote in.\n\nThe 6th District race was one of two special elections in Florida on Tuesday. The GOP would have held on to its razor-thin majority in the House no matter the outcome of Tuesday’s special elections, but legislating would have become even more difficult had it lost either seat.\n\nThe Florida elections, along with the state Supreme Court election in Wisconsin, are the first to take place since Trump returned to the White House. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., said last week that the attention on the Florida races was a warning sign for Republicans and predicted that Democrats would take back control of the House next year.",

        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "As the Trump administration continues to implement its immigration crackdown, the president’s deportation efforts are beginning to attract criticism even from a few of his most high-profile supporters.\n\nOn Saturday’s episode of “The Joe Rogan Experience,” the popular podcaster, who backed Trump in November, referred to a recent deportation operation as “horrific.”\n\n“You got to get scared that people who are not criminals are getting, like, lassoed up and deported and sent to, like, El Salvador prisons,” Rogan said.\n\nRogan referenced the deportation of Andry José Hernández Romero, a makeup artist and hairdresser from Venezuela who was seeking asylum in the United States. The 31-year-old was deported to El Salvador last month after the Trump administration accused him of belonging to Tren de Aragua, a Venezuelan gang. Immigration officials cited Hernández Romero’s tattoos — a pair of crowns on his wrists reading “Mom” and “Dad” — as evidence of links to the gang. However, as experts have noted, Tren de Aragua, unlike other Latin American gangs, is not known for using tattoos to identify its members in general, or tattoos like Hernández Romero’s in particular.\n\n“That’s bad for the cause,” Rogan said. “The cause is, ‘let’s get the gang members out,’ everybody agrees. But let’s not [let] innocent gay hairdressers get lumped up with the gangs, and then, like, how long before that guy can get out? Can we figure out how to get him out? Is there any plan in place to alert the authorities they’ve made a horrible mistake and correct it?”\n\nHernández Romero is just one of more than 200 Venezuelans the Trump administration has deported to El Salvador in recent weeks by invoking the Alien Enemies Act, a 1798 law that had only been used during wartime — a move that’s currently being challenged in court.\n\nRogan isn’t the only figure on the right who is calling out Trump over his immigration enforcement. Earlier this month, conservative commentator Ann Coulter publicly questioned the administration’s arrest of Mahmoud Khalil, a Columbia University graduate student and green-card holder who participated in pro-Palestinian protests on campus last spring.\n\nIn a post on X, Coulter wrote, “There’s almost no one I don’t want to deport, but unless they’ve committed a crime, isn’t this a violation of the first amendment?”\n\nDavid J. Bier, the director of immigration studies at the libertarian-leaning Cato Institute and a former GOP aide on Capitol Hill, told The New York Times that some influential figures on the right believe some of Trump’s immigration policies are a threat to the country’s constitutional principles.\n\n“We’re talking about doing something extraordinary here for the government to sentence people to what’s essentially slave labor, torture, prison in El Salvador based on nothing,” Bier said. “Once we get in the neighborhood of getting rid of due process, that’s the thing that protects all of our citizenship rights.”\n\nWhile Trump faces some cracks in support from right-wing pundits, elected Republicans appear more hesitant to break with him publicly.\n\nOne exception is the Republican mayor of Springfield, Ohio, Rob Rue, whose city was a frequent target of Trump on the campaign trail due to its concentration of Haitian immigrants. In February, Rue told Newsweek that Trump’s decision to end Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for Haitian immigrants would harm his city’s economy and immigrant families.\n\nIn a post on X, Coulter wrote: “There’s almost no one I don’t want to deport, but, unless they’ve committed a crime, isn’t this a violation of the first amendment?”\n\n“I encourage this administration to reform federal immigration policies in a way that protects our borders, ensures fairness, and enriches our nation — while also giving immigrants seeking to become productive citizens a clear path forward instead of facing immediate deportation,” he said. “I firmly believe in protecting our borders and reforming our immigration policies. Hasty changes and swift deportation will cause hardworking immigrants to be lost, negatively impacting our economy.”\n\n“These individuals were given hope and a sense of security through the Temporary Protected Status policy, which has been embraced by several administrations,” Rue added. “The United States must continue to be a beacon of hope and a torchbearer of democracy.”",

        "title": "Planned Parenthood is in a crisis — and the Supreme Court could make it worse",
        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "Last month, Planned Parenthood of Greater New York announced it will list its Manhattan clinic building for sale due to budget shortfalls, a move that would leave the national organization with zero presence in the borough where it was founded a century ago. It was the most visible sign of the crisis that has hit Planned Parenthood and other abortion providers since the end of Roe v. Wade. With Trump back in office, that crisis could intensify even further — starting at the Supreme Court.\n\nEven before the closure of the Manhattan clinic, PPGNY’s budget picture was already so dire it had to close four clinics — one in Staten Island and three others upstate — and stop offering abortions after 20 weeks due to the cost of sedation. Planned Parenthood of Northern New England expects an $8.6 million deficit over the next three years. And Planned Parenthood of Illinois announced in January that it would shutter four clinics that provided abortion pills amid a “financial shortfall” stemming from rising costs of care, inadequate insurance reimbursement, and an influx of patients who need assistance.\n\nThough the need for abortion support is higher than it’s ever been, donations to abortion funds and other groups have been declining since 2022.\n\nWhile the Planned Parenthood Federation of America raised several hundred million dollars in 2022 alone, little of that goes to state affiliates that actually provide care. The money affiliates receive doesn’t fund medical services, but rather pays for legal support, political advocacy, and some technology upgrades. Affiliates do accept donations directly, but they raise far less than the national office can.\n\nHow is this financial strain happening, even in states where abortion is still legal? It’s a confluence of crises after the end of Roe, with more than a dozen states banning nearly all abortions, plus rising costs, and the design of the U.S. healthcare system.\n\nThe number of abortions has actually increased after the Dobbs decision that ended Roe, as abortion support and financial assistance became more visible. Donations surged and more people traveled out of state than ever before, and demand has increased wait times, which pushes people further into pregnancy when abortion is more expensive. Because many abortion seekers are low-income and don’t have insurance that covers abortion, the cost of that care (and the related plane tickets and hotels) increasingly falls on nonprofit groups like abortion funds and clinics themselves.\n\nLast year, one large fund, the National Abortion Federation, had to cap the amount it gives per patient to stretch its budget for the year. Though the need for abortion support is higher than it’s ever been, donations to abortion funds and other groups have been declining since 2022. If a state Medicaid program does cover abortion, the rate it pays the clinic is not enough to cover the cost of the service. Add to those problems the loss of patients during the pandemic and several years of inflation, and it’s a full-blown catastrophe.\n\nAs the second Trump administration enacts more of its policy goals, abortion opponents are trying to starve abortion providers of any federal funding. They refer to that goal as “defunding,” but it’s important to note that Planned Parenthood does not have a line item in budgets. It receives payment for health care services provided and grant funding approved by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. One major goal for abortion opponents is to block abortion providers from receiving any money from Medicaid. In the year ending in June 2023, Planned Parenthood’s 49 affiliates across the country received $699 million in government grants and reimbursements for health services, including Medicaid payments.\n\nThis Wednesday, the Supreme Court will hear arguments in a case that arose after South Carolina said Planned Parenthood was not a qualified Medicaid provider for non-abortion services like birth control because — you guessed it — it separately performs abortions. Since that fact has nothing to do with the quality of care Planned Parenthood provides, a patient sued the state for violating her right under the Medicaid Act to see any qualified provider of her choosing. South Carolina claims individuals can’t actually vindicate this right in court.\n\n“Defunding” Planned Parenthood actually costs the government money in the long run.\n\nIf at least five justices agree, that could lead to more states kicking Planned Parenthood out of Medicaid. Plus, Project 2025 calls for Trump’s Health and Human Services Department to nationalize the South Carolina strategy and officially interpret the Medicaid statute as disqualifying abortion providers from the program in all 50 states. If either outcome comes to pass, more clinics will undoubtedly close, shrinking access to abortion care even in legal states.\n\nAnother bucket of funding that Trump could revoke is via a federal family planning program known as Title X. Congress allocates about $285 million yearly to support low- and no-cost access to birth control, STI testing, and cancer screenings. Grantees include state and local health departments and clinics like Planned Parenthood. During Trump’s first term, he excluded providers that even make referrals for abortion services, via what’s known as a “gag rule.” Rather than halt referrals to patients interested in abortion, Planned Parenthood affiliates left the program in 2019 and lost about $60 million. Though President Joe Biden rescinded the eligibility changes, clinics serving low-income patients took a financial hit in the interim.\n\nIt appears that Trump isn’t waiting for the next Title X grant cycle to reshape the program. The Wall Street Journal recently reported that the administration will soon freeze current grants to, in its telling, investigate whether recipients comply with executive orders on diversity, equity, and inclusion. Alexis McGill Johnson, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood Federation of America, told the Journal of the Title X freeze: “The Trump-Vance-Musk administration wants to shut down Planned Parenthood health centers by any means necessary, and they’ll end people’s access to birth control, cancer screenings, STI testing and treatment, and more to do it.”\n\nOne vehicle is the federal budget: groups like Students for Life and Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America want Republicans to include a provision in the forthcoming reconciliation bill that would bar Planned Parenthood from receiving any federal funding, including Medicaid or Title X. SBA president Marjorie Dannenfelser told the Associated Press, “I believe this is the moment they will be defunded, and this is the blow that will bring them down.”\n\nThere’s a problem though: reconciliation bills can’t increase deficits long-term, but “defunding” Planned Parenthood actually costs the government money in the long run because fewer people would be able to prevent pregnancies and Medicaid would end up covering more births. In 2015, the Congressional Budget Office estimated that a ban on funding to Planned Parenthood would increase spending $130 million over 10 years.\n\nWhile independent clinics provide the bulk of abortions in the U.S., Planned Parenthood is the single biggest provider, which is why it has an outsized target on its back. The reality is that, even if Trump hadn’t won, the organization’s affiliates would be facing financial cliffs and now the pressure is exponentially greater. More clinics will close in the coming months and years, which will harm patient care and further wound a symbol of reproductive rights.",

The winner goes on to serve a 10-year term.\n\nAlthough the race was officially nonpartisan, clear ideological differences separated Crawford and Schimel — including on labor rights, abortion access and President Donald Trump’s Jan. 6 pardons, among others — as well as the groups that backed them. A slew of prominent Democrats, including former President Barack Obama, backed Crawford; Republicans by and large endorsed Schimel, including Trump.\n\nThe race has been the most expensive judicial election in U.S. history. Megadonors from both sides of the political spectrum poured millions into the race, and Musk offered up financial incentives to voters that some claimed were legally suspect.\n\nTuesday’s result is likely to have far-reaching consequences on hot-button issues like abortion and voting rights in the battleground state.",

        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "Today is what President Donald Trump calls “Liberation Day,” the day he frees the U.S. economy from the global economy. President Trump claims that his policy of chaotically implemented tariffs will “bring back jobs” and that U.S. manufacturing will boom “like we have never boomed before.”\n\nWe’ve been down this road before, and it didn’t end well.\n\nIn his first term, President Trump claimed that he’d revitalize U.S. manufacturing, but he failed to do so; there’s no reason to believe that doubling down on the same, failed policies will do so now. There is a better way — and that comes with real federal investments into the American economy.\n\nWe’ve been down this road before, and it didn’t end well.\n\nPresident Trump is right to say that domestic manufacturing matters. Some goods are integral to national and economic security, so we all have an interest in ensuring reliable production within our borders or friendshored.\n\nTake the example of semiconductors, many thinner than a wisp of hair, now in everything from cars to refrigerators to cellphones. While innovators in Silicon Valley invented this technology, by the time Trump left office in 2021, most chips were made overseas. When Covid hit, the combination of lockdowns that shuttered factories around the world and higher demand for consumer goods as people were stuck at home led to a global chip shortage affecting 169 separate industries, which, in turn, contributed to rising prices.\n\nThis is a clear example of why we must think deeply about what is produced within the boundaries of the nation. So how do we do that?\n\nTariffs are one tool, but on their own they don’t deliver. After Trump put tariffs in place during his first term and gave tax cuts for the very wealthy, investment in the construction of new manufacturing facilities fell. That’s right, fell.\n\nNow what’s scary is that we’re already seeing signs of manufacturers struggling. In New York state, manufacturers are seeing new orders and shipments fall and overall business conditions deteriorate, leading them to lose hope that this economy will allow them to grow.\n\nWhen I was working in the Biden administration, we saw a more-than-doubling of investment in the construction of new manufacturing facilities. How did we do that? We invested in America.\n\nWhile tariffs make foreign goods more expensive, our approach instead sought to improve domestic production. By investing public dollars in infrastructure and other essential services, we brought capital into critical sectors. And we made sure that those investments could thrive and that they would deliver good, middle-class jobs.\n\nThis economic development strategy acknowledges the real-world challenge with building up a manufacturing industry in the United States. Firms need infrastructure, such as roads and access to affordable electricity, an ecosystem of other manufacturers, including suppliers, as well as competitors to keep them on their toes and build a community of best practices, and a pipeline of skilled workers who, in turn, need homes and schools and child care for their families.\n\nAll of this is a distraction from the fleecing of America by giving $4.6 trillion in tax cuts to the wealthiest.\n\nThis is why Congress passed, and President Biden signed into law, the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, the CHIPS and Science Act, and the Inflation Reduction Act. Combined, these laws catalyzed a trillion dollars in new private investment in clean energy, semiconductors and other advanced manufacturing. By crowding in investment into sectors that matter through both supply and demand side policies and addressing market failures, we saw a revitalization of U.S. manufacturing in sectors in which there’s both need and a potential to thrive.\n\nBut President Trump doesn’t get it. He thinks that capricious on-again/off-again tariffs will lead to investment and growth. But no one can plan sound investments amid this chaos. Further, he has no plan to improve domestic industry. The lack of even the concept of a plan is showing up in the data: already, there are indications that manufacturers have scaled back their intentions by $57 billion.\n\nAnd let’s be clear, all of this is a distraction from the fleecing of America by giving $4.6 trillion in tax cuts to the wealthiest and letting Elon Musk take a chainsaw to the U.S. government. These policies will not spur growth that benefits America’s working people. Just look at what happened last time: in his first term, Trump promised that his tax cuts would lead to growth of 4%-6% and wage gains of $4,000 per worker. Neither happened.\n\nWhen I visited Syracuse last year, I got to see the Biden administration’s ideas in action. At Beldon Industries, they were installing a new production line to produce a fiber optic cable that is easier to install and more cost-effective, particularly in rural areas. Across town, the Idaho-based semiconductor firm Micron was promising to invest $100 billion over the next two decades, having won a $6.1 billion grant from the CHIPs for America program.\n\nThat’s what it means to revitalize American manufacturing. It’s not about one man’s whims, but about helping communities come together and build great things.",

        "title": "Wisconsin Supreme Court victory shows Democrats how to close the gap with a key voter group",
        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "If Republicans had a path to winning the Wisconsin Supreme Court election on Tuesday, it started in the rural counties that pulled Donald Trump to victory in 2016 and 2024. If the GOP-backed candidate had performed well enough there, it might have overcome voters’ displeasure with Trump’s presidency.\n\nBut it was not to be. Compared to last year’s presidential race, Republicans lost ground in every corner of the state, including rural counties. While it’s dangerous to extrapolate too much from one election, the results show that Democrats can pick up ground in rural areas — and they don’t have to grovel to do it.\n\nThe narrower margins in these GOP strongholds point to a strong case for Democrats to make to rural voters.\n\nTuesday’s race between liberal Susan Crawford and conservative Brad Schimel ended up looking very similar to the last high-profile Supreme Court election held in Wisconsin two years ago. The 2023 race, which took place just nine months after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, was a referendum on whether abortion rights would survive in Wisconsin. As in other states, even many Republican voters were determined to retain those rights. This year, no single policy issue dominated, but the campaign was unquestionably about the Trump administration and the influence of Elon Musk.\n\nTo assess how votes in Wisconsin changed in different areas, I compared these last three elections using the National Center for Health Statistics’ 2023 Urban-Rural Classification Scheme. This taxonomy divides counties into six types, from the largest cities to the most rural areas. If we add together the votes from “micropolitan” and “noncore” counties — roughly speaking, small towns and rural areas — we see that Trump won these areas by a 60%-38% margin in 2024, while Schimel won them by only 56%-44%.\n\nGiven that turnout is higher in presidential years, that meant Trump piled up almost 200,000 more votes than Kamala Harris in those areas, making up for deficits in the more densely populated parts of the state. In contrast, Schimel only netted 67,000 more votes than Crawford in rural areas and small towns, leaving him unable to overcome her much larger advantage in cities and suburbs.\n\nAs an example, consider rural Buffalo County, in the western part of the state, with just 13,000 residents (95% of whom are white). Harris lost the county to Trump by 30 points in 2024, but Crawford narrowed Schimel’s margin to just 16.6 points. Paired with high turnout in the more liberal cities and suburbs, that kind of overperformance in rural areas is all Democrats need to win statewide. They don’t have to beat Republicans in rural places; losing by less is all it takes.\n\nWhile there were many factors contributing to this outcome, the narrower margins in these GOP strongholds point to a strong case for Democrats to make to rural voters. Democratic candidates hoping to perform well in rural areas often receive the same advice: Show up, be respectful and demonstrate that you understand rural folks’ lives. Those are all fine starting points, but they’re not enough by themselves.\n\nThe scope of the damage is breathtaking.\n\nIt has long been clear that Republicans seldom bother to repay the overwhelming support they receive in rural America with any tangible effort to improve the lives of the people who live there. But the second Trump administration has quickly turned the usual GOP indifference into something much more malign: a genuine assault on rural Americans.\n\nMuch of that attack stems from the administration’s attempt to undo everything the Biden administration did, which includes many programs Biden created or expanded to help rural America. Trump and Musk’s so-called Department of Government Efficiency are gutting the Agriculture Department agency that promotes rural development. The administration dismantled USAID, which bought billions of dollars in American crops to distribute overseas. Farmers with signed contracts with the federal government to add solar and conservation projects to their farms, many of whom fronted the money, were left holding the bag when the funds were frozen. Now the administration has written to them saying they might get their money sooner if they eliminate “harmful DEIA” from their proposals. “When I got that,” one farmer told The Washington Post, “I forwarded it to my USDA rep and said, ‘What in the world does this mean?’”\n\nAs part of the 2021 infrastructure bill, $42.5 billion was allotted to extend broadband to every home in America, a vital need for underserved rural areas. The process was slow, but plans are now in place to start installing high-speed fiber connections — except the Trump administration has held up the money. The Commerce Department plans to shift much of the funding from fiber to less reliable satellite connections that will cost consumers more, all so Musk’s Starlink can reap billions in public funds.\n\nThe scope of the damage is breathtaking. Rural universities are being hit with devastating budget cuts. Rural K-12 schools are losing funding for teachers. Trump and Musk have even targeted the agency that helps fund rural libraries. And now farmers are waiting to see whether they’ll be crushed by Trump’s tariffs and the inevitable responses from other countries, some of which will cut off their purchases of American agricultural products. It could be a version of the retaliatory agricultural tariffs from Trump’s first term, only worse.\n\nThis relentless onslaught gives Democrats an opening to make an obvious argument to rural voters: If you don’t want the world’s richest man to rip the heart out of your community, when Election Day comes, you can say no. Wisconsin just did, and others may follow.",

        "title": "Why Trump can't run for a third presidential term",
        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "President Donald Trump said “I’m not joking” when he told NBC News on Sunday that his allies have been pushing him to run for a third term — but added that “it is far too early to think about it.” I disagree: It is not at all too early to think about whether and how a president who attempted to throw out an election loss to retain power wrongly attempts to stay in power into 2029 and beyond.\n\nThough Trump’s team routinely homes in on ambiguities in the law to find loopholes that let them run roughshod over our political norms, he’ll find that there’s no ambiguity in the 22nd Amendment, possibly the clearest limit on the presidency the Constitution imposes.\n\n“No person shall be elected to the office of the President more than twice,” it reads, “and no person who has held the office of President, or acted as President, for more than two years of a term to which some other person was elected President shall be elected to the office of the President more than once.”\n\nThere’s no foothold for any alternative reading of the language, and Trump’s usual wheedling and plotting to get around any limitations on him should instantly fall flat, far before it ever reaches the Supreme Court.\n\nThen, again, the language of the 14th Amendment is very clear about banning insurrectionists from holding federal office. But when the Colorado Supreme Court cited that prohibition and ruled that Trump’s Jan. 6-related activities made him ineligible for that state’s ballot, the conservative U.S. Supreme Court helped Trump get around that constitutional roadblock.\n\nTrump’s lawyers argued that three key phrases — “having previously taken an oath,” “as an officer of the United States” and “engaged in insurrection” — didn’t apply to Trump. They combined ahistorical arguments with bad faith readings of the text, and specific word choice was interrogated to within an inch of its life. The court’s opinion in Trump v. Anderson — issued unanimously — sidestepped his lawyer’s outlandish readings of the text and found that while states can use Section 3 to block state or local office-seekers from the ballot, they can’t block a federal candidate.\n\nThere doesn’t seem to be much room for Trump to find a similar weak point in the 22nd Amendment, even if he demands that the Justice Department — which now includes several of the lawyers who helped keep him on the ballot last year — find a way for him to run again.\n\nUnlike the 14th Amendment, which was drafted over 100 years ago, the 22nd Amendment was written and ratified within some Americans’ living memory. There’s no mystery about what prompted its addition to the Constitution. In response to the outbreak of World War II, President Franklin D. Roosevelt chose to shatter the norm of U.S. presidents’ serving only two terms and ran for and won a third term. He then won a fourth presidential election in 1944, which shifted the politics of the issue dramatically.\n\nThe 22nd Amendment should stand as a testament to Congress seeing a long-established norm being undone and seeking to make it ironclad in law.\n\nCongressional Republicans and conservative Southern Democrats feared Roosevelt’s unprecedented four-term stretch could start a trend. Even though World War II was fresh in their minds, they made no exception that allowed for a two-term president to run again if the country is at war. Notably, they also limited the number of times a vice president who assumed the presidency could run again.\n\nIf anything, the 22nd Amendment should stand as a testament to Congress seeing a long-established norm being undone and seeking to make it ironclad in law. But despite the law’s being unequivocal, Trump told NBC News there “are methods which you could” use to seek a third term. He agreed that a hypothetical put before him would count, one in which he and Vice President JD Vance swap places on the ticket before Vance hands him back the top job.\n\nIn that, he seems to be taking inspiration from Russian President Vladimir Putin. After two terms, and barred from a third consecutive run, Putin became Russia’s prime minister in 2008, allowing Dmitry Medvedev to assume the presidency. Putin quickly changed his mind, swapping jobs back with Medvedev in 2012, and has remained president ever since.\n\nWhile I stand by my belief that Trump should have been disqualified from running again under the 14th Amendment, I can grudgingly admit that there were enough novel questions involved that Trump’s lawyers were able to craft a whole new subgenre of historical fiction in answering them. There is no such room for imagination in any case in which there’s even a possibility of Trump’s overstaying his term in office. The text of the 22nd Amendment is clearer than any past constitutional challenge he has instigated. And every judge he encounters is duty-bound to tell him so.",

        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "For about a decade or so, Donald Trump’s critics have asked what he could do that would finally turn his most devoted followers against him. That includes veterans, who told pollsters in 2024 that they overwhelmingly preferred him over Kamala Harris.\n\nWe may soon have our answer.\n\nOn Day 45 of President Trump’s second term, we learned that his administration was preparing to massively downsize the Department of Veteran Affairs, the federal agency that, among other things, connects veterans with health care and other services.\n\nTrump’s Veteran Affairs secretary, Doug Collins, said the president was “finally going to give the veterans what they want.”\n\nHe didn’t explain why shedding tens of thousands of VA workers brought on to expand services during the Joe Biden administration would give them what they want or what effect the cuts would have on the 2022 PACT Act, a bipartisan law enhancing screening and care for veterans exposed to toxins such as Agent Orange and burn pits.\n\nBut if the Trump administration’s plan is to tell veterans that “less is more,” it will be a hard sell. I’m from North Carolina, which has one of the largest veteran populations in America. My father was a veteran, one of many in my family. Lots of folks here are connected to one branch if not several.\n\nAnd never, never, have I heard one of them say that Veteran Affairs is doing too much for them.\n\nBefore the election, Trump promised to “serve and protect” veterans, but it’s hard to believe the lie when your VA appointment gets canceled because staff are being fired. Misdirection will only go so far when you can’t see a doctor.\n\nThis also comes from a president who referred to veterans as “losers” and “suckers” in private conversation, according to his former chief of staff, a retired four-star general in the Marine Corps.\n\nAlready, Trump’s plans for overhauling Veteran Affairs were not well received by many in my home state, which voted for the third time to give its Electoral College votes to Trump in 2024. North Carolina is home to several large bases, including Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune and Fort Bragg. These bases are deeply woven into their communities and cultures, and the military is one of our largest employers, too.\n\nThe news about Trump’s plans for the VA came days after his administration temporarily paused billions in contracting cuts at the agency that Collins falsely characterized as going to wasteful consultants writing “PowerPoint slides” and meeting minutes. Associated Press reporting revealed that the cuts included funds used for veterans’ cancer care and screening for toxic exposure.\n\n“I was always a Trump man, but when I saw that, that made me madder than hell,” one North Carolina reader wrote me recently after we at Cardinal & Pine covered the cuts.\n\nWhen you cover protests, and we’ve covered lots of them in recent days, it’s hard to tell sometimes if you’re getting the usual crowd at a protest, whether anyone has changed their mind. But you do start to recognize faces and places.\n\nMany of the folks we’re seeing today are new, and many of the people our reporters spoke to characterized themselves as politically agnostic. They’re angry — very angry, as when a North Carolina veteran confronted Republican Rep. Chuck Edwards at a recent town hall in Asheville, North Carolina.\n\nYou can get away with a lot of things in politics. Trump certainly has. He’s been forgiven for things that no politician in American history has been forgiven for.\n\nBut when your administration is directly responsible for making people less healthy and more sick — as Trump’s Veteran Affairs cuts will inevitably do — they will not forget you or forgive you.\n\nSome veterans knocked Biden for the sloppy exit from Afghanistan in 2021, but the dismantling of Veteran Affairs will be felt so much more keenly.\n\nThey’ll never get the image out of their head of a billionaire who got out of Vietnam because of a dubious “bone spurs” diagnosis — who’s allied with Elon Musk, another billionaire with no military experience — harming people who put everything on the line for their country.\n\nThey’ll protest you. They’ll make you a pariah. And, eventually, they’ll run you and your political allies out of office on a rail.\n\nSubscribe to Trump’s First 100 Days newsletter for weekly updates and expert insight on the key issues and figures defining his second term.",

        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "When all four of conservative Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry’s proposed constitutional amendments were soundly defeated Saturday — about twice as many voters voted against them as for them — he responded with insults, condescension and misinformation. The governor should have acknowledged that Louisianians didn’t want what he was selling and graciously accepted the will of the voters. Instead, as has become typical for some conservative politicians, the governor blamed political extremists and George Soros.\n\nAs has become typical for some conservative politicians, the governor blamed political extremists and George Soros.\n\n“Soros and far left liberals poured millions into Louisiana with propaganda and outright lies about Amendment 2,” Landry said in a statement. “Although we are disappointed in tonight’s results, we do not see this as a failure. We realize how hard positive change can be to implement in a State that is conditioned for failure.”\n\nHis statement is problematic for multiple reasons. Not only does he insult the good people of our state, but he also ignores that, as The Advocate newspaper of Baton Rouge reported, people from opposite sides of the political spectrum joined forces to thwart his plans to allow the formation of specialty courts in Louisiana, to move hundreds of millions of dollars from the state’s savings accounts into the general fund, to send more minors to adult prisons and to change the rules regarding some judicial elections.\n\nSoros has funded many worthy projects over the years, but Landry’s desperate attempt to make him the reason his amendments were rejected Saturday won’t fly. Our movement was built from the ground up, led by organizations — including mine, the Power Coalition for Equity and Justice — that have been working in Louisiana for years, organizations that communities trust. The people of this state came together, educated themselves and made an informed decision at the ballot box.\n\nThat is democracy in action and a defining moment that shows that despite the political headwinds, when we educate and we fight — we win.\n\nBut many conservatives talk as if there’s a villain — named Soros — behind every effort to oppose them. Elon Musk was heckled in Wisconsin on Saturday as he stumped for the conservative running for the state’s Supreme Court election. He said, “It was inevitable that at least a few Soros operatives would be in the audience.” While Soros had donated $2 million to Wisconsin’s Democratic Party during the judicial race, Musk and PACs he funds had put $20 million into the race that Democrat Susan Crawford won Tuesday.\n\nBut let’s be clear: Our victory here in Louisiana wasn’t about money or political insiders. It was about people. The Dignity and Liberty campaign was powered by a coalition of more than 50 organizations, all committed to protecting our communities and standing against harmful policies. At the heart of this fight was the leadership of Sarah Omojola at the Vera Institute, and Kristen Rome at the Louisiana Center for Children’s Rights, Power Coalition, VOTE (Voice of the Experienced), Invest in Louisiana and a network of trusted, community-based organizations worked together to ensure voters had a clear analysis and understanding of each amendment. Each of those organizations led its own education and outreach efforts.\n\nA volunteer with Louisiana's Power Coalition for Equity and Justice urged voters Saturday to oppose the four constitutional amendments on that day's ballot. All four amendments lost big. Power Coalition for Equity and Justice\n\nThis was organizing at its best. We took to the streets, held town halls and met people where they were. We broke down complex policies, listened to the concerns of everyday Louisianians and prompted those we met to understand the power of their voices and their votes.\n\nLouisiana officials routinely schedule amendment voters on dates when they think turnout will be abysmally low and only people motivated to vote yes will show up. That was the plan this time. The governor and House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., unaware that their microphones were on at a White House last week, were heard discussing the percentage of voters expected to show up.\n\n“What’s the anticipated turnout?” Johnson asks.\n\nLandry says, “Well, we thought it was going to be 12, but it looks like it might be 18%.”\n\n“That’d be huge for an election,” Johnson said, “I mean, for an amendment vote.”\n\nThe 21% turnout, though still low, was nearly double what Landry had thought it would be. And that was enough to send a signal. Black voters led the charge, making up 37% of early voters, and voters made it clear that they won’t stand for policies that put political interests over the well-being of their communities.\n\nYet, instead of respecting the will of the voters, the governor dismissed them, and conservative legislators are scrambling to put the same amendments back on a future ballot. Such tone-deaf leadership is why voter engagement is on the rise. Voters are clear their leaders aren’t listening to them.\n\nI don’t believe Louisiana is unique in that regard. I believe the spirit that animated voters here is spreading across the country and that politicians who are counting on public apathy to move their problematic agendas forward should be worried. Voters are tired of being ignored, and they refuse to be manipulated. And they will not sit idly by and watch what they love about their states and their country be destroyed.",

        "title": "Trump appears to be already laying the plans for a third term",
        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "On Sunday, President Donald Trump threw down the gauntlet to people who want to preserve constitutional democracy in this country. He told NBC’s Kristen Welker that he is “not joking” about the possibility of serving a third term, despite the 22nd Amendment’s prohibition on any person being “elected to the office of the President more than twice.”\n\nWhen asked how he would get around those words, Trump said ominously, “There are methods which you could do it.” I will leave it to others to identify loopholes in the language of the 22nd Amendment, assuming that the president cares about such niceties. Already, Trump is laying the groundwork for a third term, separate from the debates over the 22nd Amendment, by destroying or intimidating institutions that might stand in his way and claiming unconstitutional authority to control elections.\n\nAmericans are already struggling to keep up with the daily assaults on democracy, but we cannot afford to forget the future.\n\nWe saw further evidence of this strategy on Friday when the president brought another prominent American law firm to heel. The terms of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom’s surrender erode its independence, assure it will be a vassal of MAGA-world well into the future, and show Trump’s determination to ready the way to end free and fair presidential elections three years from now.\n\nAmericans are already struggling to keep up with the daily assaults on democracy, but we cannot afford to forget the future. Attacking, discrediting, intimidating and silencing both critics and the institutions that support criticism is familiar in regimes that seek to consolidate their power in the hope that they will never relinquish it. We see signs of this strategy in the president’s attack on law firms, universities, the free press and judges. His executive orders are consolidating his power and easing us toward a nondemocratic future.\n\nRecall that Trump urged his supporters last year to “get out and vote, just this time.” He explained that if they did, they “won’t have to do it anymore. Four more years, you know what, it will be fixed, it will be fine, you won’t have to vote anymore ... ”\n\nOn Sunday, the president signaled that even if the 2028 election is held as scheduled, he wants to ensure it would not be competitive, just as Viktor Orbán achieved in Hungary. What Trump would consider an achievement is, as The Atlantic’s Anne Applebaum writes, an autocratic takeover. Since Orban won a second term as Hungary’s president, he has mixed paeans to populism and family values with the destruction of press freedom and academic freedom and the politicization of the courts and the civil service. That has eased his way to claim emergency powers and amend Hungary’s constitution, even as the country has fallen into poverty and corruption has become legalized.\n\nHoward Simon, former executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union, explains that “capturing or marginalizing independent centers of thought and dissent that could challenge their authority” is what authoritarians do.\n\nThat brings us back to Skadden Arps, which last week became the second firm to cut a deal with the administration in the wake of Trump’s executive orders targeting various law firms. Skadden had not been the subject of an executive order, and three firms have already successfully challenged the orders in court. But Trump said the firm agreed to “essentially a settlement,” including “a total of at least $100 Million Dollars in pro bono Legal Services during the Trump Administration and beyond.”\n\nIf the president is thinking about how to stay in power in 2028, those who want to preserve democracy need to react accordingly.\n\nUnsurprisingly, the president insisted that some of the ransom he extracted from Skadden to stay out of his line of fire would be devoted to “ensuring fairness in our Justice System.” Note also, the open-ended phrases like “and beyond” and “at least.” Whatever happens in the 2028 election, you can rest assured that Skadden Arps will not represent anyone opposing Trump or seeking to hold him accountable.\n\nThe Washington Post reports that many other firms are unwilling to take on clients who are Trump opponents. “The president is following a playbook from other countries whose leaders have sought to undermine democratic systems and the rule of law, including Russia, Turkey, and Hungary,” writes the Post’s Michael Birnbaum. “Leaders in those countries have similarly attacked lawyers with the effect of hollowing out a pillar of justice systems to expand their power without violating existing laws.”\n\nIf that were not enough to convince pro-democracy forces to mobilize now to ensure we have a free and fair election in 2028. The president’s recent executive order on elections purports to seize powers for himself from both the states and the independent Election Assistance Commission. Linda Meyer, emeritus law professor at Quinnipiac University, says, “The decentralization of voting systems has been a guarantee of integrity in federal elections because federal employees in the current administration cannot control the entire process. This EO is targeted to wrest control over voting from states and allow the feds to get info about how each person votes.”\n\nIn what Meyer calls the “worst case scenario,” Trump can use his executive order to “target federal enforcement of this EO in [Democratic] areas and throw out votes there … while leaving [Republican] districts alone. Perhaps he can also find out exactly who voted for him and who didn’t and ‘investigate’ only those registrants who voted against him.”\n\nFor someone like Trump, who thinks an election can only be fair if he wins, the temptation to use his order that way may prove irresistible. For those who believe that the 2028 elections can be free and fair no matter what Trump does, the president’s executive order on elections proves that he thinks otherwise.\n\nAnd as The New Republic’s Michael Tomasky points out, Trump’s actions at the Defense Department, starting with the nomination of Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, have all been undertaken with the goal of “purging … an independent, rules-based military in favor of a military loyal to a single leader.” The result is that “there’s no one around to stop Trump from declaring martial law and suspending the Constitution or even an election.”\n\nRegardless of whether the courts rule on the constitutionality of a third term for Trump, he is already preparing to make their rulings moot through means that have nothing to with the 22nd Amendment. If the president is thinking about how to stay in power in 2028, those who want to preserve democracy need to react accordingly. Political leaders, lawyers and election experts must map a strategy for stopping the president. And the rest of us should prepare to copy the strategies for mass mobilization and protest used to save democracy in other countries. There is no time to waste.",

        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "On the fifth night of his second term, Donald Trump executed his first Friday Night News Dump, firing at least 18 inspectors general who were responsible for rooting out corruption, ethical lapses and mismanagement in federal agencies throughout the government. The president did not appear to have the legal authority to take such steps, but the Republican did it anyway.\n\nRoughly 10 weeks later, the White House still needs to replace many of the IGs who were ousted, and it was against this backdrop that Politico reported:\n\nPresident Donald Trump tapped a former House member who lost a scandal-tinged re-election bid last year to serve as the Labor Department’s internal watchdog as part of a slate of nominations for top jobs at the agency announced late Monday. Former Rep. Anthony D’Esposito, who worked as a New York City Police Department detective before being elected to Congress, was selected to serve as Labor’s inspector general.\n\nThe Politico report added that D’Esposito might be an “awkward fit” for the position, and it’s worth appreciating why.\n\nThe New York Republican arrived on Capitol Hill in early 2023, and it didn’t take long for the congressman to run into some trouble. Indeed, The New York Times reported in September 2024 that D’Esposito hired his fiancée’s daughter to work as a special assistant in his district office, paying her $3,800 a month in taxpayer money. Around the same time, the GOP congressman also reportedly added his mistress to his official payroll, generating a series of questions about the legal and ethical lines he apparently crossed.\n\nThe Times’ report, which was not independently verified by MSNBC or NBC News, added that his fiancée eventually found out about the affair and briefly broke up with him, at which point the New York Republican stopped paying both women.\n\nD’Esposito didn’t explicitly deny the accuracy of the reporting, though he did issue a statement that read in part, “My personal life has never interfered with my ability to deliver results for New York’s 4th district, and I have upheld the highest ethical standards of personal conduct.”\n\nThis was not persuasive to his constituents: D’Esposito, after having served just one term, narrowly lost his re-election bid in his competitive Long Island district.\n\nRoughly six months later, Trump — who has a curious habit of finding jobs for Republicans whom voters have rejected — has decided that D’Esposito should be the inspector general at the Department of Labor, where he would be expected to serve in an independent capacity, investigating ethical lapses, despite his own alleged ethical lapses.\n\nThis is a Senate-confirmed position. D’Esposito’s confirmation hearings are bound to be interesting.\n\nThis post updates our related earlier coverage.",

        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "The Eric Adams dismissal saga epitomizes much of the second Trump administration. For one thing, it’s a prime example of the Justice Department — led by Donald Trump’s personal lawyers from his criminal and impeachment cases — wielding the awesome power of the federal government for the president’s political ends.\n\nBut in the wake of Wednesday’s permanent dismissal of the corruption case against the New York City mayor, another thing that shouldn’t get lost in this sordid chapter is that it’s a testament to judicial independence in Trump 2.0.\n\nIndeed, the case’s ignoble ending could’ve been much worse.\n\nRecall that U.S. District Judge Dale Ho was faced with a brazen request from the Justice Department to dismiss the corruption charges only temporarily, and Adams agreed with that arrangement. Had Ho immediately rubber-stamped it, that would’ve left open the possibility that the Republican administration would later revive the charges, giving Trump political leverage over the Democratic mayor on matters of immigration enforcement and who knows what else.\n\nThe parties’ strained insistence that it wasn’t a quid pro quo only served to emphasize that it was.\n\nThe parties’ strained insistence that it wasn’t a quid pro quo only served to emphasize that it was.\n\nTo be sure, the Biden-appointed judge would’ve been within his rights to sign off on the transparently corrupt agreement. After all, it’s what both sides said they wanted at an unusual Feb. 19 hearing in Manhattan.\n\nBut in a masterstroke, the judge on Feb. 21 appointed a third party to present additional arguments on the matter, given the lack of adversarial testing that we typically see in the American legal system. The real genius of the appointment was in whom Ho tasked with the historic assignment: Paul Clement, not only one of the top lawyers out there but a bona fide conservative, to boot. Whatever the Democratic appointee would ultimately decide, it wouldn’t be a partisan hatchet job.\n\nAdams added another wrinkle himself Feb. 26 when he moved for a dismissal with prejudice. He claimed prosecutorial misconduct and the tainting of his presumption of innocence, due to negative information about him emerging in letters from prosecutors who resigned rather than move to dismiss his case without prejudice as the Trump DOJ instructed.\n\nClement’s March 7 brief backed the conclusion of a dismissal with prejudice. Dismissing the case without prejudice, Clement wrote, “creates a palpable sense that the prosecution outlined in the indictment and approved by a grand jury could be renewed, a prospect that hangs like the proverbial Sword of Damocles over the accused.”\n\nHo cited that language in his ruling Wednesday dismissing the case with prejudice, taking the DOJ to task in a lengthy opinion. He summarized the government’s position as wanting to ditch the case “because (1) it is tainted with impropriety; (2) it is detrimental to national security and immigration enforcement; and (3) it was a weak case to begin with — but the Court should also allow DOJ to bring the prosecution back at any time, for essentially any reason.”\n\nThe judge wrote that he “cannot and will not authorize such a result,” adding that the DOJ’s stated reasons for seeking dismissal, “if taken at face value, are inconsistent with a decision to leave the charges in the Indictment hanging like the proverbial Sword of Damocles over the Mayor.”\n\nHad the judge given the Trump DOJ exactly what it wanted, then that proverbial sword would’ve been left hanging over both the defendant and the city he’s tasked with serving. It would’ve also driven a sword through the justice system more than the Justice Department already has. But while the judge recognized that he can’t force the government to prosecute anyone, he declined to do its dirty work.\n\nSubscribe to the Deadline: Legal Newsletter for expert analysis on the top legal stories of the week, including updates from the Supreme Court and developments in the Trump administration’s legal cases.",

        "content": "Republicans’ war on abortion and Planned Parenthood could wind up curbing Medicaid patients’ health care for things having nothing to do with abortion — such as cancer screenings, blood work and annual physicals. Whether that happens could become clearer at a Supreme Court hearing Wednesday, which coincides with the broader GOP push for Medicaid cuts nationwide.\n\nThe technical legal issue before the justices deals with whether people who use the low-income assistance program can choose their providers and sue to enforce their rights.\n\nThe case started before the Supreme Court’s GOP-appointed majority overturned federal abortion rights in 2022. Four years earlier, South Carolina’s Republican governor, Henry McMaster, had sought to bar abortion clinics from Medicaid participation, and the state told Planned Parenthood that it could no longer service Medicaid beneficiaries.\n\nThat raised legal questions under part of the federal Medicaid Act known as the “free choice of provider” provision, which says states must let anyone eligible for assistance obtain the care from any “qualified” provider.\n\nA federal appeals court panel ruled against the state last year, reasoning that the provision “specifies an entitlement given to each Medicaid beneficiary: to choose one’s preferred qualified provider without state interference.”\n\nIn a decision written by Reagan appointee J. Harvie Wilkinson, the panel stressed that its ruling was about not abortion but rather “whether Congress conferred an individually enforceable right for Medicaid beneficiaries to freely choose their healthcare provider.”\n\nWilkinson noted that if Planned Parenthood clinics were to close in South Carolina, “other Medicaid-funded clinics in the state would be more hard-pressed to meet the demand in family planning care.” Siding with the provider and a woman insured through Medicaid who wanted to go there, the judge said that’s “precisely the prospect Congress wished to avoid.”\n\nThe state appealed to the Supreme Court, represented by the Christian legal group Alliance Defending Freedom, which litigates abortion and other issues aligned with Republican policies. In its high court petition, the state called the issue one of “great national importance.” The justices granted review and set oral argument for Wednesday. The Trump administration supports the state.\n\nAmong Planned Parenthood’s backers are Medicaid beneficiaries who told the justices in an amicus brief that they rely on the provider for health care services having nothing to do with abortion, “including annual physicals, blood work, screenings for various forms of cancer, infertility and prenatal services — indeed, some patients rely on Planned Parenthood for virtually all their healthcare needs.”\n\nThey wrote that their experiences show “just how important it is that the courthouse door remain open when States attempt to bar patients insured by Medicaid from seeking care from the qualified provider of their choice.”\n\nA decision in the case, known as Medina v. Planned Parenthood South Atlantic, is expected by July, when the court typically finishes issuing the term’s rulings.\n\nSubscribe to the Deadline: Legal Newsletter for expert analysis on the top legal stories of the week, including updates from the Supreme Court and developments in the Trump administration’s legal cases.",

        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "Technically, it’s called the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, but it’s better known by its initials: LIHEAP. At issue is a program that has long served as a lifeline for millions of low-income households struggling to cover their energy costs.\n\nIn Donald Trump’s first term as president, the Republican administration initially proposed steep cuts to LIHEAP, but in the face of bipartisan pushback, the White House ultimately backed off.\n\nEight years later, the issue is back with a vengeance — and this time, Trump and his team appear to be advancing their goals more effectively. NBC News reported:\n\nThe Trump administration on Tuesday eliminated the entire staff of a federal program that helps low-income households pay utility bills, sources said. The staff of 10 employees accounted for only a small fraction of the 10,000 layoffs included in Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s purge of the Department of Health and Human Services. But those who work closely with the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, or LIHEAP, now fear for its future.\n\nThe report quoted Andrew Germain, who was director of fiscal operations and accountability for the Administration for Children and Families, the HHS division that leads dozens of programs from welfare assistance to child abuse prevention, saying: “Ultimately, I believe the program will crumble from within without the federal office there to manage it.”Germain added, “For the communities that need the funding and need the support of the federal office, they’re going to be without those resources. You’re talking about individuals who rely on crisis assistance from the LIHEAP program to keep the power on, whether it be for a medical reason or some other potentially life-threatening purpose.”\n\nCNN had a related report, which quoted Mark Wolfe, executive director of the National Energy Assistance Directors Association. He told the network that he didn’t see how the agency can “allocate the remaining $387 million in funds for this year without federal staff. The program could well grind to a halt.”\n\nI frequently find myself thinking about a report from The Washington Post that was published the day after Christmas, which highlighted the perspectives of several low-income voters who supported the Trump ticket in the November election. The article specifically referenced a middle-aged Pennsylvania woman who struggled to make ends meet despite receiving food stamps and Social Security benefits, who explained why she voted for the Republican ticket.\n\nTrump “is more attuned to the needs of everyone instead of just the rich,” the woman told the Post. “I think he knows it’s the poor people that got him elected, so I think Trump is going to do more to help us.”\n\nIt’s difficult to count the number of steps the Republican president and his team have taken since then that have left low-income families worse off.",

        "title": "Snubbing Trump, bipartisan group of senators votes against Canada tariffs",
        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "In short order, Donald Trump has done extraordinary harm to the relationship between the United States and Canada. There are plenty of lawmakers on Capitol Hill — in both parties — who believe the president is on the wrong track, especially when it comes to trade tariffs on our allies north of the border.\n\nWith this in mind, Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia has championed a privileged resolution that would terminate the president’s Feb. 1 emergency declaration, which the White House used to issue tariffs on Canada. It would also, of course, eliminate the need for Canada’s retaliatory tariffs on American products.\n\nThe question has long been whether Kaine, whose measure was co-authored with Democratic Sens. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and Mark Warner of Virginia, could pick up a handful of Republican supporters to clear the upper chamber. That question now has an answer.\n\nThe Senate voted 51-48 to pass the resolution, with four Republicans — Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Mitch McConnell and Rand Paul of Kentucky and Susan Collins of Maine — joining all 47 Democrats in support.\n\nThe outcome is striking, though it’s not altogether surprising. Paul, for example, is a longtime tariff critic and co-sponsor of Kaine’s resolution, while Collins and Murkowski signaled their support for the Democratic measure ahead of the floor vote.\n\nOf particular interest, though, was McConnell, who is retiring next year and has become an occasional thorn in the White House’s side, and who’s likely to face another round of hysterical criticisms from the Oval Office.\n\nAs a practical matter, the fact that Kaine’s resolution passed won’t have any immediate policy implications: The measure will now head to the GOP-led House, where it will very likely go ignored.\n\nThat said, as a Politico report summarized it, losing this vote represents “the most significant rebuke to Trump that congressional Republicans have yet mustered in his second term.”\n\nIt’s precisely why Trump recently began lobbying aggressively against Kaine’s resolution, publishing an item to his social media platform that said a Senate vote in support of the measure would be “devastating for the Republican Party.”\n\nIn a follow-up item, the president wrote that GOP senators should “fight the Democrats wild and flagrant push to not penalize Canada for the sale, into our Country, of large amounts of Fentanyl, by Tariffing the value of this horrible and deadly drug in order to make it more costly to distribute and buy.” The missive suggested that Trump was under the impression that he’s imposing tariffs on fentanyl, which doesn’t make any sense.\n\nHe went on to write, “Why are they allowing Fentanyl to pour into our Country unchecked, and without penalty. What is wrong with them, other than suffering from Trump Derangement Syndrome, commonly known as TDS? Who can want this to happen to our beautiful families, and why?”\n\nTo the extent that reality still has any relevance in the debate, the idea that fentanyl is “pouring into” the United States is rather silly. In fact, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection, only 43 pounds of fentanyl were found crossing the northern border in 2024 — as opposed to 21,100 pounds seized at the southern border.\n\nFighting a trade war with a trusted ally and neighbor over fentanyl that could fit in a single suitcase is absurd. The president might not understand this, but a bipartisan majority of the Senate got it right.",

        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "House Speaker Mike Johnson suffered a humiliating blow from his own caucus on Tuesday when he failed to kill a proposal that would have allowed lawmakers who have just given birth to delegate a colleague to cast votes on their behalf.\n\nJohnson, a Louisiana Republican, was so put off by his tactical loss that he sent everyone in Congress home early for the week. The bizarre decision to tell all of his colleagues to pack it in was a rather obvious attempt to divert attention from his failure to control the chamber.\n\nThe outcome is embarrassing for Johnson, who used a strong-arm tactic to try to quell a mutiny over a relatively low-stakes issue, and then failed.\n\nLast year Rep. Anna Paulina Luna, R- Fla., who gave birth to a son in 2023, began to advocate for a House policy that would allow new mothers to appoint a colleague to vote on their behalf during the first six weeks after birth. There is currently no parental leave policy in Congress, and voting must be done in person. Luna's effort evolved as she worked with a bipartisan group of lawmakers, and the rule change movement has become a call for both new mothers and fathers to be able to exercise proxy voting for up to 12 weeks. But a major obstacle stood in her way: The leader of her own party in the House is strongly opposed to proxy voting, and has argued that it's unconstitutional and would be a slippery slope to an overly lax attitude toward proxy voting.\n\nLuna had a plan to force a vote on the issue this week and use a special maneuver to circumvent Johnson. She collected 218 \"discharge petition\" signatures, including from 11 Republicans, which allows her to bring the legislation directly to the floor without Johnson's backing. But Johnson then sought to pre-empt this with a special maneuver of his own: He used what The New York Times described as an \"unprecedented parliamentary maneuver\" to close off her path to forcing the vote. Except it didn't work.\n\nAs NBC News reports, it \"failed 206-222, with nine Republicans bucking Johnson and voting with all 213 Democrats.\" Notably, some of the Republicans who joined Luna in killing Johnson's effort in that vote were not even signatories to her petition.\n\nThe outcome is embarrassing for Johnson, who used a strong-arm tactic to try to quell a mutiny over a relatively low-stakes issue, and then failed. Johnson was immediately pouty: As he left the chamber he told reporters, \"That rule being brought down means that we can't have any further action on the floor this week.\"\n\nJohnson's move appears to have left a bitter taste in the mouth of some of his colleagues. Axios reports that \"several GOP lawmakers expressed a feeling that the speaker was being heavy-handed in trying to override the will of a majority of the House.\" Meanwhile Luna felt emboldened, calling it a \"historical day.\" And Rep. Brittany Pettersen, D-Colo., who was the lead author of the bill, said her message to the speaker was: \"Don’t f--- with moms.\" It also doesn't speak highly of Johnson's level of power in his party if he failed the first time he tried to pull off a major legislative move without Trump's backing. Johnson's decision to end business in Congress for the week came off as a transparent bid to avoid admitting defeat.\n\nOn a policy level, the demands of Luna, Pettersen and their allies in calling for 12 weeks of proxy voting seems sensible. Why would calling for parental-leave proxy voting lead to a \"slippery slope\" wherein proxy voting is abused endlessly? The rule change would be time-restricted and based on very specific, rare and important extenuating circumstances. And it would reflect an acknowledgement of the evolving cultural norms surrounding parenthood in the modern workforce.\n\nThen again, it is entirely apropos that Johnson would be unswayed by such arguments. The U.S., is after all, a global outlier in its refusal to mandate paid parental leave. As the Republican Party puts all its energy into attacking social programs that help vulnerable people, it would look rather odd for Johnson to seem supportive of young parents.",

        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "The Trump administration is slashing funds for museums and libraries, as a way to coerce these and other liberal arts institutions to bend to his movement’s will in a fashion reminiscent of Nazi Germany.\n\nWriting for MSNBC, sociologist Robyn Autry summed up the racism at play in a recent Trump recent executive order that targets the Smithsonian and expresses particular angst over an exhibit at the National Museum of African American History and Culture that educated visitors about racist pseudoscience.\n\nAutry wrote:\n\nOne of the things that has Trump angry is ‘The Shape of Power: Stories of Race and American Sculpture,’ an exhibit at the American Art Museum that innovatively positions nearly 100 sculptures alongside statements about scientific racism. That’s the discredited belief that there are biologically distinct races of people, with some more superior than others. The exhibition examines how artists and art objects have assisted, reflected or challenged such racist thinking since the 18th century, but Trump, in his executive order, expresses disappointment that the show ‘promotes the view that race is not a biological reality but a social construct.’\n\nNow is as good a time as any to read my previous reporting on Trump’s promotion of racist pseudoscience. His attack on the National Museum of African American History and Culture is one way the Trump administration is trying to enforce a racial hierarchy based on bigoted myths. Politico recently reported on another way Trump is trying to bring humanities-focused institutions to heel. In mid-March Trump signed an executive order that gutted the Institute of Museum and Library Services, which funds museums and libraries around the country.\n\nAccording to Politico:\n\nAn agency responsible for funding museums and libraries across the nation is the latest to be shrunk by President Donald Trump’s cuts to the federal government, with its entire staff apparently put on administrative leave Monday. The Institute of Museum and Library Services, which provides grants to ‘advance, support, and empower’ museums, libraries and similar institutions in the U.S. according to its website, was named in an executive order this month along with several other agencies. Trump’s order directed the Institute of Museum and Library Services ‘be eliminated to the maximum extent consistent with applicable law,’ shrinking it down to its statutory minimum.\n\nA Trump official reportedly told Politico that the cuts to the institute are necessary to “ensure hard-earned tax dollars are not diverted to discriminatory DEI initiatives or divisive, anti-American programming in our cultural institutions.”\n\nIn a letter seeking a meeting with the institute’s acting director, the Chief Officers of State Library Agencies said that money from IMLS accounts for “an average of one-third to over one-half of each State Library Agency’s annual budget.” And there’s been no suggestion from the Trump administration as to where else these libraries ought to get funding to account for the cuts the administration is making.\n\nWhat Trump appears to be after with his crackdowns on libraries and museums has some parallel in the way Hitler and the Nazi regime attacked similar institutions in Germany in the 1930s. What the Nazis accomplished with brute force, Trump and MAGA are attempting to do with economic and financial coercion.\n\nWhat the Nazis accomplished with brute force, Trump and MAGA are attempting to do with economic and financial coercion.\n\nBeginning in 1933, Nazis raided libraries for supposedly “un-German” books, some of which were publicly burned and derided as inappropriate for German consumption due to their content. Much like with the MAGA movement’s book-banning efforts, some of the books targeted by Nazis were written by minority groups, like Jews, or about the LGBTQ experience. (Back in 2023, the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum hosted an eye-opening discussion about this with Debra Caldwell-Stone, the director of the American Library Association’s Office of Intellectual Freedom.)\n\nIn 1937, the Nazis raided museums and seized artworks to place them in what they billed as a “degenerate” art exhibition, a propaganda effort meant to show the public that the Nazis would tolerate only the art that aligned with the party’s views. Defending this effort to suppress the arts, Joseph Goebbels, the minister of propaganda, claimed, “German art of the next decade will be heroic, it will be like steel, it will be romantic, non-sentimental, factual; it will be national with great pathos, and at once obligatory and binding, or it will be nothing.” Hitler himself denounced “degenerate” art pieces as those which “insult German feeling, or destroy or confuse natural form or simply reveal an absence of adequate manual and artistic skill.”\n\nThe U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum also explored the Nazis’ “degenerate art” exhibit in the short video below, noting that the point was for Hitler to wield power over non-governmental institutions to ensure they promoted “traditional German values” and the purported superiority of the “Aryan race.”\n\nWhile the methods may be different, the purpose of the Nazi attacks on libraries and museums was no different than Trump’s now. Such institutions are known as sites of free thought, imagination and innovation. At best, their content and collections encourages visitors to understand the world around them and the perspectives that shape it — forces like racist and anti-LGBTQ bigotry — and to envision ways to build a better world. And these things are a threat to regimes intent on policing thought and ensuring the masses comply with their revanchist, bigoted agenda.",

        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "In a February Hulu documentary featuring Shari Franke, eldest child of the infamous mommy blogger Ruby Franke, Shari’s brother Chad and her father, Kevin, viewers are privy to behind-the-scenes video from the now-defunct family vlog. In one clip, Ruby smiles while recording herself before breaking off to scream at her family off-screen.\n\nThe documentary, titled “Devil in the Family: The Fall of Ruby Franke,” features several moments like this, moments that illustrate what detractors see as a wider phenomenon in which the family blogging industry is exposed for its many pitfalls and deceptions, particularly as it pertains to the protection and treatment of children.\n\nFor detractors of family vloggers and mom influencers, Franke’s arrest was proof positive that their suspicions were correct and something ominous was lurking under the perfect veneer of social media fame.\n\nIndeed, Utah, where the Franke family resided and recorded daily family life for years, has become the fourth state to legislate protections for influencer kids with the passing of HB 322 into law in March, following high-profile activism from Franke family members, who were YouTube family vlogging royalty before matriarch Ruby was arrested on charges of child abuse.\n\nRuby Franke and her estranged husband, Kevin Franke, were the head of the YouTube family channel “8 Passengers.” At its height, the channel commanded more than 2 million subscribers. In her content, Ruby Franke often touted strict parenting, like the time she infamously refused to bring her 6-year-old daughter lunch after the child had forgotten it or when her teenage son was made to sleep on a beanbag for months as a punishment. In 2023, Franke and her business partner, Jodi Hildebrandt, were arrested on charges of child abuse after Franke’s 12-year-old son escaped from Hildebrandt’s house. The child appeared emaciated and had wounds on his wrists and ankles. Franke’s 9-year-old daughter was found in a closet of Hildebrandt’s house, in a similar state. Hildebrandt and Franke each pleaded guilty to four counts of felony child abuse, for which they were sentenced to up to 30 years in prison.\n\nThe fallout of Ruby Franke’s arrest was intense. For detractors of family vloggers and mom influencers, Franke’s arrest was proof positive that their suspicions were correct and something ominous was lurking under the perfect veneer of social media fame. Anti-vlogging advocates had the feeling that the bottom was finally falling out of a deeply rotten industry. Buffeted by the moment, Shari Franke, the eldest child of Ruby Franke, spoke in front of the Utah Legislature, saying, “There is no ethical or moral family vlogger.”\n\nIn the wake of the Franke family tragedy, calls for protections for kids of influencers have intensified. Though people often assume that child influencers are covered under legal protections for child actors, they’re not. In 46 of 50 states, it’s legal for parents to feature their kids in monetized or sponsored content without paying the children for their labor.\n\nIt’s particularly impactful for Utah, of all states, to have passed legislation for the privacy and profits of influencer kids, as experts often point to Utah as a hot spot for mom influencers, family vloggers and kid influencers. There’s an entire book to be written about why Mormon people are so drawn to influencing — and why they’re often so successful at it, including the fact that recordkeeping and scrapbooking are mainstay traditions of the Mormon faith, skills that lend themselves to content creation — but the bottom line is that Utah is one of the most popular states for family vloggers and mom influencers. And though people who were raised as kid influencers aren’t a monolith, it’s important to listen to them when they speak about their experiences, like when Shari Franke told Rolling Stone, “Making money off your kids [with] no oversight as to how much the kids are getting paid — there’s no way to do that well for me.”\n\nI’m a journalist who covers family vloggers and mom influencers, and my take on their work is far from black-and-white. I don’t believe that showing your kid online is immoral in itself. We shouldn’t conflate the horrors of Ruby Franke’s story with the lives of every kid featured in their influencer parents’ content. And not every mom influencer and family vlogger are evil — far from it.

        "content": "As Election Day in Wisconsin’s closely watched state Supreme Court race neared, Republican megadonor Elon Musk summarized its perceived importance in dramatic terms. This one electoral contest, Musk said, could determine “the future of America and Western Civilization.” He added that he believes the race was likely to “affect the entire destiny of humanity.”\n\nA few days later, voters in the Badger State rendered their verdict — and it wasn’t the one Musk and other Republicans wanted to hear. As my MSNBC colleague Clarissa-Jan Lim summarized overnight:\n\nLiberal candidate Susan Crawford has won the Wisconsin Supreme Court election, NBC News projected Tuesday, preserving a liberal majority on the swing state’s highest court. Crawford, a circuit court judge in Dane County, defeated Brad Schimel, a Waukesha County circuit court judge and former Republican state attorney general.\n\nTechnically, the Wisconsin race was non-partisan, but the political battle lines were clearly drawn: Democrats rallied behind the progressive candidate, while Donald Trump and the GOP were heavily invested, literally and figuratively, in the conservative candidate.\n\nThe race — the most expensive judicial contest in the history of the United States — was expected to be close. It was not. With roughly 95% of the vote counted, Crawford appears to have prevailed by roughly 10 points.\n\nOn the surface, the news for Republicans was better in Florida, where GOP candidates won congressional special elections held in Republican strongholds. But here, too, the outcomes were unsettling for the party: The GOP representatives-elect won their races by roughly 14 points in districts where Republicans won by more than 30 points as recently as the 2024 cycle — just six months ago.\n\nWhat’s more, they ran against Democratic neophytes who raised a ton of money but who were, quite recently, expected to be crushed. Instead, GOP officials and their allies had to scramble to prevent upsets, as the Democratic candidates over-performed.\n\nThese races follow a series of other Democratic special election victories in recent weeks, including Democrats unexpectedly flipping two GOP-held state legislative seats in Iowa and Pennsylvania, as well as the White House abandoning Republican Rep. Elise Stefanik’s ambassadorial nomination last week because of fears that Democrats might win her seat — in a New York district that Trump won by 21 points.\n\nAs the dust settles on the most important electoral tests of Trump’s second term, we’ve learned a few things about the electoral landscape.\n\nMusk won’t save Republican candidates: The president’s top campaign donor spent millions in the hopes of pushing Schimel to victory in Wisconsin, and it backfired, with Democrats ultimately running against Musk, whom they accused of trying to buy the election. There’s a lesson here for GOP officials who’ve falsely assumed that Musk is popular with the American mainstream and who’ve operated from the assumption that the billionaire can help carry them across the finish line in 2026.\n\nDemocrats will be running against Musk a lot in the coming months: Trump’s unpopularity matters, but Musk’s unpopularity runs deeper. If you’re thinking the billionaire will be a centerpiece of Democratic messaging going forward, you’re right.\n\nRepublicans in competitive districts have reason to worry: The GOP thought it could run the 2024 playbook in a battleground state that Trump narrowly won, counting on that recipe to keep working. It failed badly. Republicans representing districts that were highly competitive last year are now confronted with a choice: Ignore the prevailing winds, stick with their party and hope for the best, or start putting some distance between themselves and the GOP.\n\nTrump’s endorsements are of limited value: Once again, Trump told voters to turn out for an ally. Once again, it didn’t matter. There’s no denying that the president has a loyal base, but to assume that base will necessarily rally behind his preferred candidates is a mistake.\n\nReassessing the Democratic “brand”: Democratic Sen. Michael Bennet of Colorado told NBC News over the weekend that his party’s brand is “problematic.” Around the same time, California’s Democratic governor, Gavin Newsom, said the Democratic brand is “toxic.” Days earlier, Democratic Sen. John Fetterman of Pennsylvania told Politico, “If we don’t get our s--- together, then we are going to be in a permanent minority.”\n\nMaybe so, but while some Democratic officials complain about the party’s reputation, Democratic candidates have been doing pretty well lately.\n\nIn the aftermath of Election Day 2024, the conventional wisdom suggested not only that Republicans had entered an era of electoral dominance, but also that Democratic voters were demoralized, disheartened and prepared to withdraw from civic life for a long while.\n\nA lot has changed in six months.",

        "content": "This is an adapted excerpt from the April 2 episode of “Morning Joe.”\n\nDuring his marathon speech on the Senate floor Tuesday, Sen. Cory Booker said, over and over again, that this is a moral moment in America: This is not about right or left, Democrat or Republican — this is about right and wrong.\n\nSome Republicans think the billionaire needs to be put in his place and that Trump needs to realize Musk is hurting him and the party.\n\nBooker’s remarks tapped into a real frustration present among voters. There is anger. There is depression. There is disappointment. But under it all, there is energy. People in this country don’t like what’s going on. They don’t like the way the United States is treating its allies. They don’t like people being deported without any due process. They don’t like that we’re going to have escalating costs and that our economy could end up in the ditch because of Donald Trump’s tariffs. And there’s a huge critical mass of people out there ready to act on that energy.\n\nWe saw it in action Tuesday in Wisconsin, where liberal candidate Susan Crawford won the state’s Supreme Court election and defeated the Trump- and Elon Musk-backed candidate, Brad Schimel. That result was a one-two punch for Republicans. It proved that Trump’s backing simply isn’t enough to get a candidate over the finish line. It also showed that Musk’s presence within the party is a big problem for Republicans. Musk poured millions into the race, which effectively became a referendum on him.\n\nAfter Tuesday, Democrats have a lot to feel excited and energized about: Speaker Mike Johnson suffered an embarrassing loss on the House floor, Booker commanded the country’s attention with that marathon speech, and the party secured a win in Wisconsin while seeing results out of red districts in Florida that were way closer than they should have been for Republicans.\n\nBut I wouldn’t be surprised if some GOP lawmakers in Washington also woke up cheering Wednesday morning. I wouldn’t be shocked if, behind the scenes, secretly some Republicans were fine with missing out on that Wisconsin Supreme Court seat because, just maybe, it could take Musk down a peg.\n\nRepublicans have gone home to their districts and heard what their constituents have had to say about Musk and his so-called Department of Government Efficiency. They know his cuts are widely unpopular and fear that what happened in Wisconsin could happen in their district next. Those Republicans are hoping Tuesday’s results could be the push Trump needs to put Musk in his place and realize just how much he’s hurting the party — before it’s too late.",

        "title": "Trump’s memes are meant to downplay the cruelty of his mass deportations",
        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "President Donald Trump’s administration is posting sadistic memes on its social media accounts to prompt the public to cruelly laugh at migrants caught up in his mass deportation obsession. For example, last week, the White House X account exploited a new ChatGPT feature that allows users to transform images “into the style of Studio Ghibli,” the beloved animation studio, and posted a cartoon version of a posted photo of a crying undocumented migrant in handcuffs. The responses to the post were a mix of delight from supporters and horror from critics, and the practice illustrates how Trump knows he must dehumanize migrants to justify his aggressive and increasingly extralegal efforts to deport them.\n\nTrump couches his messages in seemingly unserious or “comical” aesthetics online to downplay how sinister they are. As I’ve written in the past, Trump uses humor as a weapon, in part by dressing up his violations of norms and degradation of his opponents as a joke.\n\nThe White House chose an unsympathetic subject for its Studio Ghibli-style meme — a migrant who reportedly had been deported in the past after pleading guilty to attempted possession with intent to distribute fentanyl. But regardless of what that person did or where one stands on this particular deportation or deportations in general — brandishing people’s pain as a political message is not a defense of policy. Trump’s propaganda reveals that he delights in the pain of others, and he encourages the public to laugh with him.\n\nTrump’s social media team is making performative sadism a full-fledged comms strategy. In February the White House posted a video of migrants being deported with the text “ASMR: Illegal Alien Deportation Flight.\" The “joke” is that the viewer is supposed to find it soothing to hear the sounds of the jangling of handcuffs and chains on migrants and the starting rumble of the plane that will deport them. On Feb. 14, above an image that looked like a valentine with Trump’s and White House border czar Tom Homan’s heads surrounded by hearts, Trump posted, “Roses are red, violets are blue, come here illegally, and we’ll deport you,”\n\nTrump’s friends have struck similar notes. El Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele created a disturbing three-minute propaganda video, which he released after Trump initially deported alleged Venezuelan gang members to a brutal prison in his country. Operating in a similar emotional register as Trump’s memes, Bukele’s video depicts the brutalization of prisoners as part of an exciting action sequence and revels in an authoritarian aesthetic in its depiction of phalanxes of police officers. It’s easy to see why Trump and Bukele are natural partners on this issue. Each of them takes pleasure in seeing others publicly humiliated.\n\nTrump’s propaganda, which glories in the derision of those he terms “monsters,” is meant to help culturally authorize the extreme and potentially illegal measures he’s taking to deport them. The Trump administration is using flimsy evidence, circumventing due process and exploiting obscure provisions of immigration law to expel as many people as the administration considers socially or politically undesirable as possible. There’s a parallel track between, in the cultural sphere, treating migrants as not fully human and deserving of our derisive laughter and, as official policy, treating them as a class of people who have no rights.",

        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., took the Senate floor on Monday at 7 p.m. ET and resolved to retain it “for as long as I am physically able.” He did so through the night and into the morning, reading out loud from letters and emails from the everyday Americans hurt by President Donald Trump’s arbitrary and painful spending cuts. Late Tuesday afternoon, Booker was still speaking, leaning on the podium at times, but determined to keep going.\n\nIt wasn’t technically a filibuster that Booker conducted. He wasn’t talking to delay a vote on any specific agenda item. Instead, Booker said, in giving his marathon speech, he was “disrupting the normal business of the United States Senate.” After watching his heroic 25-hour long effort, I say our country would be better off if promoting the values Booker lifted up was the normal business of the Senate.\n\n“These are not normal times in our nation,” Booker insisted at the start of his speech.\n\n“These are not normal times in our nation,” Booker insisted at the start of his speech. His rhetoric may have been a response to the growing pressure from Democratic voters to see the officials they elected show real resistance to Trump. A recent NBC News poll found “almost two-thirds of Democrats, 65%, say they want congressional Democrats to stick to their positions even if that risks sacrificing bipartisan progress, and just 32% want them to make legislative compromises with Trump.” Democrats were at an all-time low in popularity in that survey; only 27% of registered voters reported having a positive view of the party.Those numbers speak to a maddening thirst for leadership from Democratic political figures. I eagerly await behind-the-scenes reporting on Booker’s speech, including how much planning and coordination, if any, there was among Senate Democrats. The third-term senator chairs the caucus’ strategic communications committee, so I would guess he at least gave Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., a heads-up before he took the floor.\n\nSen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., on the Senate floor in Washington, D.C., on Tuesday. Senate Television\n\nBut when did Democrats realize that Booker speech was a rallying point for a party that has been lacking a guiding star for the last three months? Because the energy that Democrats were radiating around the time Booker had been speaking for over 20 hours wasn’t there when he first took the floor.Booker spent Monday night addressing a mostly empty chamber, but by Tuesday morning his Democratic colleagues had helped make his protest a team effort. “I yield for a question but retain the floor” became a catchphrase of sorts as a parade of his colleagues stepped up to ask him lengthy questions and keep the momentum going. There was no shortage of topics, as Booker responded to their prompts with stories of, say, the hardships veterans face thanks to cuts from Elon Musk and the Department of Government Efficiency. There were also questions and answers about the economic damage that Trump is causing, and expressions of empathy for people who were already struggling to get by and are now being left by Musk and Trump to fend for themselves.\n\nBut maybe what America needs right now is a little cringe, a recommitment to being genuine and earnest in our desire to help others.\n\nThe support Booker received from his colleagues made the marathon speech different from previous faux filibusters. When Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, held the floor to protest Obamacare in 2014, his fellow Republicans were confused and infuriated by his one-man stunt that would have no real impact on the debate. Booker’s speech wasn’t what was once referred to as a “gentleman’s filibuster,” a lengthy speech that doesn’t interrupt the Senate’s other business. Booker delayed at least one major Trump administration nomination as he spoke.“Is Cory cringe or is this refreshing?” a colleague messaged me at one point during Booker’s speech. The answer, as my colleague immediately noted, is “yes.” Booker can be the cringiest of senators, which is saying something, wearing his heart on his sleeve and brandishing an inspiring quote at every possible chance. His lack of cynicism can be off-putting in a time when doomerism is rampant and hope can feel like a lie in the face of harsh reality. But maybe what America needs right now is a little cringe, a recommitment to being genuine and earnest in our desire to help others.\n\nThe question is whether Democrats can keep this energy going beyond this specific moment. We need to see the party do this when there’s an inflection point, that is, when there’s a time where Republicans are demanding they move aside and they instead throw themselves upon the gears of the federal government. It makes little sense to engage in such a protest when the stakes are lower and not do so when they’re much higher.\n\nBooker has wrapped up his marathon speech, but if the Senate’s Democrats want to show their angry constituents that they’re listening, they cannot let the business of the Senate return to the old normal.",

        "title": "Trump is very serious about taking Greenland",
        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "If you’d said to me three months ago that the United States could invade and occupy Greenland, I’d have likely checked your head for a tinfoil hat. But after Vice President JD Vance’s three-hour trip to a U.S. military base in Greenland, I’m starting to get concerned that Operation Arctic Freedom could be in the offing.\n\nVance’s brief sojourn to the autonomous territory, which is still part of the Kingdom of Denmark, was perhaps the most insane and inappropriate diplomatic foray ever conducted by an American official.\n\nIn short, the message was: ‘Nice island you got here ... it’d be a shame if something happened to it.’\n\nVance, accompanied by the national security adviser, Michael Waltz, and the energy secretary, Chris Wright, didn’t meet with Greenland’s prime minister or any other government officials. In fact, it’s not clear he encountered a single resident of the island. A planned meet-and-greet with Usha Vance, the vice president’s wife, was scrapped because U.S. officials couldn’t find any locals willing to meet publicly with the second lady — as well as because of fears that any public event would be marred by protests.\n\nVance instead stayed sequestered at a U.S. Army base where he openly criticized Denmark — which provides military protection for Greenland (at least for now) — and said the island was essential to U.S. national security. The vice president implicitly threatened the use of American military force to acquire it.\n\n“The president has said clearly he doesn’t think that military force is going to be necessary,” said Vance, “but he absolutely believes that Greenland is an important part of the security not just of the U.S. but of the world.”\n\nIn short, the message was: “Nice island you got here ... it’d be a shame if something happened to it.”\n\nAccording to Vance, the United States’ increasing its position in Greenland “has to happen” because “our friends in Denmark have not done their job in keeping this area safe” from Russian and Chinese encroachment. Vance’s warnings of Russian adventurism hit a bit hollow when you consider that the Trump administration is actively working to end Moscow’s diplomatic isolation since the 2022 invasion of Ukraine.\n\nBut the vice president’s menacing rhetoric follows a familiar and disturbing pattern. In January, before taking office, Trump refused to rule out economic or military coercion to take over the island. “It might be that you’ll have to do something,” he said at the time in reference to Greenland and the Panama Canal. In his address to a joint session of Congress last month, he said, “One way or another, we’re gonna get it.”\n\nOn the day of Vance’s trip, Trump declared in the Oval Office, “We need Greenland. ... We have to have Greenland. It’s not a question of ‘Do you think we can do without it?’ We can’t.”\n\nAnd during a little-noted news conference in March with Mark Rutte, the NATO secretary general, Trump dismissed Denmark’s territorial claims to Greenland and said ominously, “We have a couple of bases on Greenland already, and we have quite a few soldiers that — maybe you’ll see more and more soldiers go there. I don’t know.” (italics added)\n\nTrump then pointed to Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and asked, “What do you think about that, Pete? Don’t answer that, Pete. Don’t answer that question.”\n\nHow many times can Trump say he’s considering using the U.S. military to seize Greenland before we start taking him seriously?\n\nThe irony of Trump’s statement is that he can send additional U.S. troops right now to improve Greenland’s defenses. According to a 1951 defense agreement between the United States and Denmark, the United States is legally permitted to create new “defense areas ... necessary for the development of the defense of Greenland and the rest of the North Atlantic Treaty area, and which the Government of the Kingdom of Denmark is unable to establish and operate singlehanded.”\n\nHow many times can Trump say he’s considering using the U.S. military to seize Greenland before we start taking him seriously?\n\nIn other words, as Danish Foreign Minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen recently pointed out, if the Trump administration wants to ramp up the U.S. military presence in Greenland without taking control of the island, it’s well within its rights to do so. Rasmussen also noted that the Danish government announced a multibillion-dollar security package for Greenland in January, which included the acquisition of icebreakers and long-range drones, as well as additional personnel stationed on the Arctic island. None of this was mentioned in Vance’s remarks.\n\nThere’s also the matter of NATO, of which Denmark is a founding member. Any attack on Greenland would be considered an attack on all NATO countries — and the United States would be treaty-bound to defend it. What better security guarantee could there be for Greenland than the full weight of America’s military might if the island is attacked?\n\nIf Trump is genuinely concerned about Greenland and the potential for Russian and Chinese encroachment, there are plenty of steps that the United States can take to improve the security situation there. But Trump isn’t doing that. Rather than working with the Danish government and securing a greater military partnership, he is openly antagonizing it by declaring his desire to make Greenland part of the United States.\n\nThe reason seems rather simple yet also terrifying: Trump wants Greenland to become part of the United States. Period. He doesn’t care about Greenland’s security. He wants it for America. Indeed, Trump has been talking about making Greenland the 51st state since his first term as president. Back in 2019, he got in a public spat — and canceled a planned trip to Denmark — because then-Danish Prime Minister Mette Fredriksen refused to discuss selling the island to the United States.\n\nWhy does Trump want Greenland so badly? I suspect it’s the same reason he wants to annex Canada and reclaim the Panama Canal. It’s consistent with his propensity for slapping his name (always in giant letters) on garish, self-aggrandizing, yet oddly boring architectural monstrosities around the globe. It’s all about Trump’s ego.\n\nMost presidents seek policy legacies. For Barack Obama, it was health care; for Ronald Reagan, a smaller federal government; for Richard Nixon, détente with the communist world. Trump couldn’t care less about policy because his only genuine interest is himself. He wants to be able to point to America’s expanded territorial footprint and say, “I made Greenland the 51st state.”\n\nIndeed, at his news conference Friday, Vance unintentionally admitted that Trump’s ego is driving this process. Asked whether the United States “is very serious in its desire to acquire Greenland,” he said, “Well, the president said we have to have Greenland, and I think that we do have to be more serious about the security of Greenland. We can’t just ignore this place. We can’t just ignore the president’s desires.”\n\nAlas, Vance and those around Trump do have agency to ignore his desire to control Greenland. Instead, they indulge him — as they’ve done on his calls for annexing Canada and his disastrous trade war. How far is Trump willing to go? We don’t know, but if anyone thinks that a U.S. military attack on Greenland is outside the realm of possibility, they simply aren’t paying attention.",

        "title": "Trump’s TikTok idea highlights his incoherent talk on tariffs",
        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "President Donald Trump is desperate to close a deal for a U.S.-based buyer to purchase TikTok. So desperate, in fact, that he has proposed giving China relief on tariffs if its government approves a deal. That proposal has predictably been panned by Democrats and Republicans alike.\n\nAfter all, Trump said he was placing tariffs on China largely to try to stop fentanyl from reaching the United States. The fact he’s willing to dangle a reduction in exchange for a TikTok deal shows how incoherent his talk about tariffs is and how eager he is to bring TikTok under America’s — and perhaps, by extension, his administration’s — control.\n\nAll the while, Big Tech elites and the companies they lead are circling TikTok like sharks, hoping they get their shot to sink their teeth into the app.\n\nLast year, I wrote about how rich right-wingers, including “Shark Tank” co-panelist Kevin O’Leary, have shown interest in a purchase. And now, Amazon has joined the list of suitors looking to buy the app.\n\nAccording to NBC News:\n\nAmazon has made a late bid to purchase TikTok, a person familiar with the ongoing White House-led discussions to identify a non-Chinese buyer for the social media app told NBC News. The bid, first reported by The New York Times, arrived this week, via a letter to Vice President JD Vance and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick. Given the last-minute timing, days before a Saturday deadline to stave off a ban of the app in the U.S., the bid is not being treated as serious, said the source, who was granted anonymity to share details of private negotiations.\n\nTikTok was set to be banned in January as a result of a bipartisan bill, signed last spring by President Joe Biden, that required the Chinese-owned app to be sold to an American-based owner or cease operating in the United States. The app’s owners didn’t meet that deadline, of course, and TikTok was briefly banned. But Trump defied the law when he took office, signing an executive order saying that he was instructing the Justice Department to not take action against TikTok for a period of 75 days, which ends Saturday.\n\nFor the record, legal experts have sounded the alarm on Trump’s authoritarian power grab in this case, although sadly, many TikTok fans have seemed indifferent to it as long as they can still have access to their favorite mind control device. Trump’s personal involvement in the negotiations has set up a possibility that TikTok, which like other apps has occasionally been plagued by a raft of propaganda and misinformation, might be sold to a MAGA-friendly owner who is sympathetic to conservatives’ rage over content moderation.\n\nOwnership by Amazon, the company owned by Jeff Bezos, certainly wouldn’t dispel concerns — mine, at least — that TikTok could become even more of a boon for Trump’s movement than it already has been.\n\nAmazon donated $1 million toward Trump’s inauguration, Bezos appeared onstage with the gaggle of Big Tech oligarchs at Trump’s inaugural ceremony, Amazon reportedly signed a sweetheart $40 million deal for the rights to distribute a documentary about with first lady Melania Trump, and Bezos’ changes at The Washington Post — which he also owns — have justifiably prompted speculation that he’s transforming it to become more friendly to Trump. Beyond that, the London-based Institute for Strategic Dialogue released a report in 2022 finding that Amazon’s recommendation algorithms were steering some people toward conspiracy theories and extremist content.\n\nTo put it mildly, that’s not great for a company looking to purchase what is arguably the most popular social media platform in the world. That said, there are other sharks in the water looking to sink their teeth into TikTok, and Trump is obviously champing at the bit to secure a buyer before Saturday.",

        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "When Florida Republicans made Dr. Joseph Ladapo the state’s surgeon general three years ago, the physician took on a multifaceted position. Indeed, Ladapo wouldn’t just serve as Florida’s surgeon general, he was also tasked with leading the state’s Department of Health, while simultaneously receiving a tenured faculty position at the University of Florida.\n\nHow’s that working out? The Alligator, the university’s student-run newspaper, reported this week on the controversial doctor’s tenure.\n\nLadapo’s work calendar shows monthslong stretches with little or no activity. Instead of attaining grants and conducting research, he spent his first year revising manuscripts and writing his memoir, ‘Transcend Fear,’ which details his skepticism of vaccines. He also promised to bring hundreds of thousands in research dollars from the University of California at Los Angeles, his previous employer. That never happened. ... A review of internal reports and public directories indicate Ladapo hasn’t secured any research grants for UF.\n\nThe same report, which has not been independently verified by MSNBC or NBC News, added that Lapado’s classroom contributions have been “sparse”; one of his proposed courses “has yet to materialize”; and there’s “little evidence” that the internal medicine program he was supposed to lead has done meaningful work.\n\n“Although UF leaders initially welcomed Ladapo, issues with absenteeism, funding shortfalls and clashes with colleagues quickly emerged,” the article added. (Ladapo and university representatives didn’t respond to The Alligator's requests for comment.)\n\nOfficials can’t say they weren’t warned.\n\nRevisiting our earlier coverage, Ladapo’s former supervisor at UCLA discouraged Florida officials from hiring the controversial doctor, saying that Ladapo relied on his opinions more than scientific evidence. The UCLA supervisor added that Ladapo’s weird theories “created a stressful environment for his research and clinical colleagues and subordinates,” some of whom believed the doctor “violated the duty in the Hippocratic Oath to behave honestly and ethically.”\n\nIt was not the first time Ladapo’s work at UCLA generated scrutiny. It was during his tenure in California when the physician also claimed in a USA Today op-ed that his perspective on Covid treatments had been shaped by his experience “taking care of patients with COVID-19 at UCLA’s flagship hospital.” Two weeks later, Ladapo added in a Wall Street Journal op-ed that he had his experience “caring for patients with suspected or diagnosed Covid-19 infections at UCLA.”\n\nThe Rachel Maddow Show's reporting later called those claims into question. As my colleague Kay Guerrero explained in a report, “Several former colleagues of Dr. Joseph Ladapo ... say he misled the public about his experience treating Covid-19 patients.”\n\nOne UCLA source also said, in reference to Ladapo, “A lot of people here at UCLA are glad that he is gone because we were embarrassed by his opinions and behavior. At the same time, we don’t wish this on the people of Florida. They don’t deserve to have someone like him making their health decisions.”\n\nA Florida Department of Law Enforcement report later told policymakers that Ladapo’s views led to “stress and acrimony among his coworkers and supervisors.” Soon after, the GOP-led legislature confirmed the physician anyway at the urging of Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis.\n\nWhile in office, Ladapo has made a wide variety of radical and potentially dangerous decisions, leading the editorial board of The Washington Post to conclude two years ago, “By playing loose with the facts, Dr. Ladapo ... betrayed the trust of the people of Florida and the nation.”\n\nThe University of Florida report, in other words, is striking — but not surprising.\n\nThis report updates our related earlier coverage.",

        "title": "RFK Jr. targets the nation’s public health infrastructure with brutal layoffs and cuts",
        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "Last week, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a conspiracy theorist whom Republicans put in charge of the Department of Health and Human Services, left little doubt that he would soon announce mass layoffs at the federal agency. Unfortunately, as NBC News reported, he did exactly that this week.\n\nThe Trump administration carried out mass layoffs across the Department of Health and Human Services on Tuesday, aiming to slash around 10,000 full-time jobs from the federal agencies long tasked with regulating food and drugs and overseeing the nation’s public health policies. Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency is trying to reduce HHS’ workforce from 82,000 to 62,000 across several agencies, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Food and Drug Administration and the National Institutes of Health.\n\nDr. Robert Califf, the former FDA commissioner, said the agency as Americans have come to know it, is now “finished.” The New York Times added that the agency has now lost nearly all of its traditionally nonpolitical experts on food, drugs, vaccines and medical devices.\n\nNBC News’ report added that the Trump administration also made “deep and wide-ranging cuts to divisions responsible for tackling HIV, improving minority health and preventing injury, such as gun violence. Jobs were eliminated at offices overseeing the approval of new drugs, providing health insurance and responding to infectious disease outbreaks.”\n\nThe Bulwark’s Jonathan Cohn explained, “The sheer breadth of the cuts is staggering: The layoffs affected agencies that exist to fight deadly pathogens, to protect the nation’s drug supply, to finance and carry out cutting-edge research — along with countless other divisions and offices that touch everything from rural health to early childhood care.”\n\nWendy Armstrong, director of infectious diseases at the University of Colorado, told Cohn, in reference to the Republican administration’s layoffs and cuts, “Americans will suffer, and people will die.”\n\nI suspect White House officials and their allies will argue that such assessments are overstated. We can all hope they’re right, but given the scope and scale of the decisions, there’s every reason to believe that there’s nothing hyperbolic about the estimations.\n\nWhat’s more, for Kennedy and his radical agenda, it’s the latest in a series of related steps. Indeed, the layoffs come on the heels of free measles vaccine clinics closing in Texas — during a measles outbreak — because of Kennedy’s HHS cuts.\n\nThat came on the heels of Dr. Peter Marks, who oversaw the FDA’s vaccine division as director of the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, resigning at least in part because of Kennedy promoting “misinformation and lies” in his claims about vaccine safety.\n\nWhich came on the heels of RFK Jr. making a bizarre choice to oversee research on the nonexistent connection between vaccines and autism.\n\nWhich came on the heels of news of some measles patients in Texas getting worse because people followed bad advice they got from Kennedy during a Fox News interview.\n\nWhich came on the heels of Kennedy decimating the agency leading the federal response to the opioid crisis.\n\nWhich came on the heels of the CDC’s former communications director writing a Washington Post op-ed in which he explained that career infectious-disease experts have been “tasked with spending precious hours searching medical literature in vain for data to support Kennedy’s preferred treatments,” adding that Kennedy and his team are “working to bend science to fit their own narratives, rather than allowing facts to guide policy.”\n\nWhich came on the heels of the CDC, falling in line with Kennedy’s agenda, burying a measles forecast that stressed the need for vaccinations.\n\nWhich came on the heels of Kennedy’s department abruptly canceling “more than $12 billion in federal grants to states that were being used for tracking infectious diseases, mental health services, addiction treatment and other urgent health issues.”\n\nWhich came on the heels of the department also canceling funding “for dozens of studies seeking new vaccines and treatments for Covid-19 and other pathogens that may cause future pandemics.”\n\nDid I mention that these developments — literally all of them — are from just the last week? Because they are.\n\nOn Tuesday, Republican Sen. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, who chairs the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, partnered with independent Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont in calling Kennedy to testify about his “proposed reorganization of the Department of Health and Human Services.”\n\nThat’s a worthwhile move, though I wish the hearing had been held before Kennedy started dismantling the nation’s public health infrastructure, not after.",

        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "Republican Randy Fine has won the special election in Florida’s 6th Congressional District, prevailing in the longtime Republican stronghold despite unexpectedly fierce competition from Democrat Josh Weil, NBC News projects.\n\nThe special election to fill the seat held by Michael Waltz, who left Congress to become President Donald Trump’s national security adviser, turned out to be unusually competitive. GOP leaders were alarmed that Weil, an educator, had outraised Fine, a state senator, by millions of dollars. Early voting data suggested strong Democratic turnout, though those numbers are typically unreliable indicators of the final results.\n\nDemocrats had steered clear of predicting that Weil would flip the seat, but his showing could signal trouble ahead for Republicans. Counties in the 6th Congressional District have long leaned red — Trump, who endorsed Fine, carried the district by more than 30 points in the 2024 election, while Waltz easily won re-election.\n\nFine was leading Weil 54%-46% when the NBC News Decision Desk projected him as the winner with 73% of the expected vote in.\n\nThe 6th District race was one of two special elections in Florida on Tuesday. The GOP would have held on to its razor-thin majority in the House no matter the outcome of Tuesday’s special elections, but legislating would have become even more difficult had it lost either seat.\n\nThe Florida elections, along with the state Supreme Court election in Wisconsin, are the first to take place since Trump returned to the White House. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., said last week that the attention on the Florida races was a warning sign for Republicans and predicted that Democrats would take back control of the House next year.",

        "title": "Joe Rogan and Ann Coulter break with Trump over ‘horrific’ deportation enforcement",
        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "As the Trump administration continues to implement its immigration crackdown, the president’s deportation efforts are beginning to attract criticism even from a few of his most high-profile supporters.\n\nOn Saturday’s episode of “The Joe Rogan Experience,” the popular podcaster, who backed Trump in November, referred to a recent deportation operation as “horrific.”\n\n“You got to get scared that people who are not criminals are getting, like, lassoed up and deported and sent to, like, El Salvador prisons,” Rogan said.\n\nRogan referenced the deportation of Andry José Hernández Romero, a makeup artist and hairdresser from Venezuela who was seeking asylum in the United States. The 31-year-old was deported to El Salvador last month after the Trump administration accused him of belonging to Tren de Aragua, a Venezuelan gang. Immigration officials cited Hernández Romero’s tattoos — a pair of crowns on his wrists reading “Mom” and “Dad” — as evidence of links to the gang. However, as experts have noted, Tren de Aragua, unlike other Latin American gangs, is not known for using tattoos to identify its members in general, or tattoos like Hernández Romero’s in particular.\n\n“That’s bad for the cause,” Rogan said. “The cause is, ‘let’s get the gang members out,’ everybody agrees. But let’s not [let] innocent gay hairdressers get lumped up with the gangs, and then, like, how long before that guy can get out? Can we figure out how to get him out? Is there any plan in place to alert the authorities they’ve made a horrible mistake and correct it?”\n\nHernández Romero is just one of more than 200 Venezuelans the Trump administration has deported to El Salvador in recent weeks by invoking the Alien Enemies Act, a 1798 law that had only been used during wartime — a move that’s currently being challenged in court.\n\nRogan isn’t the only figure on the right who is calling out Trump over his immigration enforcement. Earlier this month, conservative commentator Ann Coulter publicly questioned the administration’s arrest of Mahmoud Khalil, a Columbia University graduate student and green-card holder who participated in pro-Palestinian protests on campus last spring.\n\nIn a post on X, Coulter wrote, “There’s almost no one I don’t want to deport, but unless they’ve committed a crime, isn’t this a violation of the first amendment?”\n\nDavid J. Bier, the director of immigration studies at the libertarian-leaning Cato Institute and a former GOP aide on Capitol Hill, told The New York Times that some influential figures on the right believe some of Trump’s immigration policies are a threat to the country’s constitutional principles.\n\n“We’re talking about doing something extraordinary here for the government to sentence people to what’s essentially slave labor, torture, prison in El Salvador based on nothing,” Bier said. “Once we get in the neighborhood of getting rid of due process, that’s the thing that protects all of our citizenship rights.”\n\nWhile Trump faces some cracks in support from right-wing pundits, elected Republicans appear more hesitant to break with him publicly.\n\nOne exception is the Republican mayor of Springfield, Ohio, Rob Rue, whose city was a frequent target of Trump on the campaign trail due to its concentration of Haitian immigrants. In February, Rue told Newsweek that Trump’s decision to end Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for Haitian immigrants would harm his city’s economy and immigrant families.\n\nIn a post on X, Coulter wrote: “There’s almost no one I don’t want to deport, but, unless they’ve committed a crime, isn’t this a violation of the first amendment?”\n\n“I encourage this administration to reform federal immigration policies in a way that protects our borders, ensures fairness, and enriches our nation — while also giving immigrants seeking to become productive citizens a clear path forward instead of facing immediate deportation,” he said. “I firmly believe in protecting our borders and reforming our immigration policies. Hasty changes and swift deportation will cause hardworking immigrants to be lost, negatively impacting our economy.”\n\n“These individuals were given hope and a sense of security through the Temporary Protected Status policy, which has been embraced by several administrations,” Rue added. “The United States must continue to be a beacon of hope and a torchbearer of democracy.”",

        "title": "Planned Parenthood is in a crisis — and the Supreme Court could make it worse",
        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "Last month, Planned Parenthood of Greater New York announced it will list its Manhattan clinic building for sale due to budget shortfalls, a move that would leave the national organization with zero presence in the borough where it was founded a century ago. It was the most visible sign of the crisis that has hit Planned Parenthood and other abortion providers since the end of Roe v. Wade. With Trump back in office, that crisis could intensify even further — starting at the Supreme Court.\n\nEven before the closure of the Manhattan clinic, PPGNY’s budget picture was already so dire it had to close four clinics — one in Staten Island and three others upstate — and stop offering abortions after 20 weeks due to the cost of sedation. Planned Parenthood of Northern New England expects an $8.6 million deficit over the next three years. And Planned Parenthood of Illinois announced in January that it would shutter four clinics that provided abortion pills amid a “financial shortfall” stemming from rising costs of care, inadequate insurance reimbursement, and an influx of patients who need assistance.\n\nThough the need for abortion support is higher than it’s ever been, donations to abortion funds and other groups have been declining since 2022.\n\nWhile the Planned Parenthood Federation of America raised several hundred million dollars in 2022 alone, little of that goes to state affiliates that actually provide care. The money affiliates receive doesn’t fund medical services, but rather pays for legal support, political advocacy, and some technology upgrades. Affiliates do accept donations directly, but they raise far less than the national office can.\n\nHow is this financial strain happening, even in states where abortion is still legal? It’s a confluence of crises after the end of Roe, with more than a dozen states banning nearly all abortions, plus rising costs, and the design of the U.S. healthcare system.\n\nThe number of abortions has actually increased after the Dobbs decision that ended Roe, as abortion support and financial assistance became more visible. Donations surged and more people traveled out of state than ever before, and demand has increased wait times, which pushes people further into pregnancy when abortion is more expensive. Because many abortion seekers are low-income and don’t have insurance that covers abortion, the cost of that care (and the related plane tickets and hotels) increasingly falls on nonprofit groups like abortion funds and clinics themselves.\n\nLast year, one large fund, the National Abortion Federation, had to cap the amount it gives per patient to stretch its budget for the year. Though the need for abortion support is higher than it’s ever been, donations to abortion funds and other groups have been declining since 2022. If a state Medicaid program does cover abortion, the rate it pays the clinic is not enough to cover the cost of the service. Add to those problems the loss of patients during the pandemic and several years of inflation, and it’s a full-blown catastrophe.\n\nAs the second Trump administration enacts more of its policy goals, abortion opponents are trying to starve abortion providers of any federal funding. They refer to that goal as “defunding,” but it’s important to note that Planned Parenthood does not have a line item in budgets. It receives payment for health care services provided and grant funding approved by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. One major goal for abortion opponents is to block abortion providers from receiving any money from Medicaid. In the year ending in June 2023, Planned Parenthood’s 49 affiliates across the country received $699 million in government grants and reimbursements for health services, including Medicaid payments.\n\nThis Wednesday, the Supreme Court will hear arguments in a case that arose after South Carolina said Planned Parenthood was not a qualified Medicaid provider for non-abortion services like birth control because — you guessed it — it separately performs abortions. Since that fact has nothing to do with the quality of care Planned Parenthood provides, a patient sued the state for violating her right under the Medicaid Act to see any qualified provider of her choosing. South Carolina claims individuals can’t actually vindicate this right in court.\n\n“Defunding” Planned Parenthood actually costs the government money in the long run.\n\nIf at least five justices agree, that could lead to more states kicking Planned Parenthood out of Medicaid. Plus, Project 2025 calls for Trump’s Health and Human Services Department to nationalize the South Carolina strategy and officially interpret the Medicaid statute as disqualifying abortion providers from the program in all 50 states. If either outcome comes to pass, more clinics will undoubtedly close, shrinking access to abortion care even in legal states.\n\nAnother bucket of funding that Trump could revoke is via a federal family planning program known as Title X. Congress allocates about $285 million yearly to support low- and no-cost access to birth control, STI testing, and cancer screenings. Grantees include state and local health departments and clinics like Planned Parenthood. During Trump’s first term, he excluded providers that even make referrals for abortion services, via what’s known as a “gag rule.” Rather than halt referrals to patients interested in abortion, Planned Parenthood affiliates left the program in 2019 and lost about $60 million. Though President Joe Biden rescinded the eligibility changes, clinics serving low-income patients took a financial hit in the interim.\n\nIt appears that Trump isn’t waiting for the next Title X grant cycle to reshape the program. The Wall Street Journal recently reported that the administration will soon freeze current grants to, in its telling, investigate whether recipients comply with executive orders on diversity, equity, and inclusion. Alexis McGill Johnson, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood Federation of America, told the Journal of the Title X freeze: “The Trump-Vance-Musk administration wants to shut down Planned Parenthood health centers by any means necessary, and they’ll end people’s access to birth control, cancer screenings, STI testing and treatment, and more to do it.”\n\nOne vehicle is the federal budget: groups like Students for Life and Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America want Republicans to include a provision in the forthcoming reconciliation bill that would bar Planned Parenthood from receiving any federal funding, including Medicaid or Title X. SBA president Marjorie Dannenfelser told the Associated Press, “I believe this is the moment they will be defunded, and this is the blow that will bring them down.”\n\nThere’s a problem though: reconciliation bills can’t increase deficits long-term, but “defunding” Planned Parenthood actually costs the government money in the long run because fewer people would be able to prevent pregnancies and Medicaid would end up covering more births. In 2015, the Congressional Budget Office estimated that a ban on funding to Planned Parenthood would increase spending $130 million over 10 years.\n\nWhile independent clinics provide the bulk of abortions in the U.S., Planned Parenthood is the single biggest provider, which is why it has an outsized target on its back. The reality is that, even if Trump hadn’t won, the organization’s affiliates would be facing financial cliffs and now the pressure is exponentially greater. More clinics will close in the coming months and years, which will harm patient care and further wound a symbol of reproductive rights.",

The winner goes on to serve a 10-year term.\n\nAlthough the race was officially nonpartisan, clear ideological differences separated Crawford and Schimel — including on labor rights, abortion access and President Donald Trump’s Jan. 6 pardons, among others — as well as the groups that backed them. A slew of prominent Democrats, including former President Barack Obama, backed Crawford; Republicans by and large endorsed Schimel, including Trump.\n\nThe race has been the most expensive judicial election in U.S. history. Megadonors from both sides of the political spectrum poured millions into the race, and Musk offered up financial incentives to voters that some claimed were legally suspect.\n\nTuesday’s result is likely to have far-reaching consequences on hot-button issues like abortion and voting rights in the battleground state.",

        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "Today is what President Donald Trump calls “Liberation Day,” the day he frees the U.S. economy from the global economy. President Trump claims that his policy of chaotically implemented tariffs will “bring back jobs” and that U.S. manufacturing will boom “like we have never boomed before.”\n\nWe’ve been down this road before, and it didn’t end well.\n\nIn his first term, President Trump claimed that he’d revitalize U.S. manufacturing, but he failed to do so; there’s no reason to believe that doubling down on the same, failed policies will do so now. There is a better way — and that comes with real federal investments into the American economy.\n\nWe’ve been down this road before, and it didn’t end well.\n\nPresident Trump is right to say that domestic manufacturing matters. Some goods are integral to national and economic security, so we all have an interest in ensuring reliable production within our borders or friendshored.\n\nTake the example of semiconductors, many thinner than a wisp of hair, now in everything from cars to refrigerators to cellphones. While innovators in Silicon Valley invented this technology, by the time Trump left office in 2021, most chips were made overseas. When Covid hit, the combination of lockdowns that shuttered factories around the world and higher demand for consumer goods as people were stuck at home led to a global chip shortage affecting 169 separate industries, which, in turn, contributed to rising prices.\n\nThis is a clear example of why we must think deeply about what is produced within the boundaries of the nation. So how do we do that?\n\nTariffs are one tool, but on their own they don’t deliver. After Trump put tariffs in place during his first term and gave tax cuts for the very wealthy, investment in the construction of new manufacturing facilities fell. That’s right, fell.\n\nNow what’s scary is that we’re already seeing signs of manufacturers struggling. In New York state, manufacturers are seeing new orders and shipments fall and overall business conditions deteriorate, leading them to lose hope that this economy will allow them to grow.\n\nWhen I was working in the Biden administration, we saw a more-than-doubling of investment in the construction of new manufacturing facilities. How did we do that? We invested in America.\n\nWhile tariffs make foreign goods more expensive, our approach instead sought to improve domestic production. By investing public dollars in infrastructure and other essential services, we brought capital into critical sectors. And we made sure that those investments could thrive and that they would deliver good, middle-class jobs.\n\nThis economic development strategy acknowledges the real-world challenge with building up a manufacturing industry in the United States. Firms need infrastructure, such as roads and access to affordable electricity, an ecosystem of other manufacturers, including suppliers, as well as competitors to keep them on their toes and build a community of best practices, and a pipeline of skilled workers who, in turn, need homes and schools and child care for their families.\n\nAll of this is a distraction from the fleecing of America by giving $4.6 trillion in tax cuts to the wealthiest.\n\nThis is why Congress passed, and President Biden signed into law, the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, the CHIPS and Science Act, and the Inflation Reduction Act. Combined, these laws catalyzed a trillion dollars in new private investment in clean energy, semiconductors and other advanced manufacturing. By crowding in investment into sectors that matter through both supply and demand side policies and addressing market failures, we saw a revitalization of U.S. manufacturing in sectors in which there’s both need and a potential to thrive.\n\nBut President Trump doesn’t get it. He thinks that capricious on-again/off-again tariffs will lead to investment and growth. But no one can plan sound investments amid this chaos. Further, he has no plan to improve domestic industry. The lack of even the concept of a plan is showing up in the data: already, there are indications that manufacturers have scaled back their intentions by $57 billion.\n\nAnd let’s be clear, all of this is a distraction from the fleecing of America by giving $4.6 trillion in tax cuts to the wealthiest and letting Elon Musk take a chainsaw to the U.S. government. These policies will not spur growth that benefits America’s working people. Just look at what happened last time: in his first term, Trump promised that his tax cuts would lead to growth of 4%-6% and wage gains of $4,000 per worker. Neither happened.\n\nWhen I visited Syracuse last year, I got to see the Biden administration’s ideas in action. At Beldon Industries, they were installing a new production line to produce a fiber optic cable that is easier to install and more cost-effective, particularly in rural areas. Across town, the Idaho-based semiconductor firm Micron was promising to invest $100 billion over the next two decades, having won a $6.1 billion grant from the CHIPs for America program.\n\nThat’s what it means to revitalize American manufacturing. It’s not about one man’s whims, but about helping communities come together and build great things.",

        "title": "Wisconsin Supreme Court victory shows Democrats how to close the gap with a key voter group",
        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "If Republicans had a path to winning the Wisconsin Supreme Court election on Tuesday, it started in the rural counties that pulled Donald Trump to victory in 2016 and 2024. If the GOP-backed candidate had performed well enough there, it might have overcome voters’ displeasure with Trump’s presidency.\n\nBut it was not to be. Compared to last year’s presidential race, Republicans lost ground in every corner of the state, including rural counties. While it’s dangerous to extrapolate too much from one election, the results show that Democrats can pick up ground in rural areas — and they don’t have to grovel to do it.\n\nThe narrower margins in these GOP strongholds point to a strong case for Democrats to make to rural voters.\n\nTuesday’s race between liberal Susan Crawford and conservative Brad Schimel ended up looking very similar to the last high-profile Supreme Court election held in Wisconsin two years ago. The 2023 race, which took place just nine months after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, was a referendum on whether abortion rights would survive in Wisconsin. As in other states, even many Republican voters were determined to retain those rights. This year, no single policy issue dominated, but the campaign was unquestionably about the Trump administration and the influence of Elon Musk.\n\nTo assess how votes in Wisconsin changed in different areas, I compared these last three elections using the National Center for Health Statistics’ 2023 Urban-Rural Classification Scheme. This taxonomy divides counties into six types, from the largest cities to the most rural areas. If we add together the votes from “micropolitan” and “noncore” counties — roughly speaking, small towns and rural areas — we see that Trump won these areas by a 60%-38% margin in 2024, while Schimel won them by only 56%-44%.\n\nGiven that turnout is higher in presidential years, that meant Trump piled up almost 200,000 more votes than Kamala Harris in those areas, making up for deficits in the more densely populated parts of the state. In contrast, Schimel only netted 67,000 more votes than Crawford in rural areas and small towns, leaving him unable to overcome her much larger advantage in cities and suburbs.\n\nAs an example, consider rural Buffalo County, in the western part of the state, with just 13,000 residents (95% of whom are white). Harris lost the county to Trump by 30 points in 2024, but Crawford narrowed Schimel’s margin to just 16.6 points. Paired with high turnout in the more liberal cities and suburbs, that kind of overperformance in rural areas is all Democrats need to win statewide. They don’t have to beat Republicans in rural places; losing by less is all it takes.\n\nWhile there were many factors contributing to this outcome, the narrower margins in these GOP strongholds point to a strong case for Democrats to make to rural voters. Democratic candidates hoping to perform well in rural areas often receive the same advice: Show up, be respectful and demonstrate that you understand rural folks’ lives. Those are all fine starting points, but they’re not enough by themselves.\n\nThe scope of the damage is breathtaking.\n\nIt has long been clear that Republicans seldom bother to repay the overwhelming support they receive in rural America with any tangible effort to improve the lives of the people who live there. But the second Trump administration has quickly turned the usual GOP indifference into something much more malign: a genuine assault on rural Americans.\n\nMuch of that attack stems from the administration’s attempt to undo everything the Biden administration did, which includes many programs Biden created or expanded to help rural America. Trump and Musk’s so-called Department of Government Efficiency are gutting the Agriculture Department agency that promotes rural development. The administration dismantled USAID, which bought billions of dollars in American crops to distribute overseas. Farmers with signed contracts with the federal government to add solar and conservation projects to their farms, many of whom fronted the money, were left holding the bag when the funds were frozen. Now the administration has written to them saying they might get their money sooner if they eliminate “harmful DEIA” from their proposals. “When I got that,” one farmer told The Washington Post, “I forwarded it to my USDA rep and said, ‘What in the world does this mean?’”\n\nAs part of the 2021 infrastructure bill, $42.5 billion was allotted to extend broadband to every home in America, a vital need for underserved rural areas. The process was slow, but plans are now in place to start installing high-speed fiber connections — except the Trump administration has held up the money. The Commerce Department plans to shift much of the funding from fiber to less reliable satellite connections that will cost consumers more, all so Musk’s Starlink can reap billions in public funds.\n\nThe scope of the damage is breathtaking. Rural universities are being hit with devastating budget cuts. Rural K-12 schools are losing funding for teachers. Trump and Musk have even targeted the agency that helps fund rural libraries. And now farmers are waiting to see whether they’ll be crushed by Trump’s tariffs and the inevitable responses from other countries, some of which will cut off their purchases of American agricultural products. It could be a version of the retaliatory agricultural tariffs from Trump’s first term, only worse.\n\nThis relentless onslaught gives Democrats an opening to make an obvious argument to rural voters: If you don’t want the world’s richest man to rip the heart out of your community, when Election Day comes, you can say no. Wisconsin just did, and others may follow.",

        "title": "Why Trump can't run for a third presidential term",
        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "President Donald Trump said “I’m not joking” when he told NBC News on Sunday that his allies have been pushing him to run for a third term — but added that “it is far too early to think about it.” I disagree: It is not at all too early to think about whether and how a president who attempted to throw out an election loss to retain power wrongly attempts to stay in power into 2029 and beyond.\n\nThough Trump’s team routinely homes in on ambiguities in the law to find loopholes that let them run roughshod over our political norms, he’ll find that there’s no ambiguity in the 22nd Amendment, possibly the clearest limit on the presidency the Constitution imposes.\n\n“No person shall be elected to the office of the President more than twice,” it reads, “and no person who has held the office of President, or acted as President, for more than two years of a term to which some other person was elected President shall be elected to the office of the President more than once.”\n\nThere’s no foothold for any alternative reading of the language, and Trump’s usual wheedling and plotting to get around any limitations on him should instantly fall flat, far before it ever reaches the Supreme Court.\n\nThen, again, the language of the 14th Amendment is very clear about banning insurrectionists from holding federal office. But when the Colorado Supreme Court cited that prohibition and ruled that Trump’s Jan. 6-related activities made him ineligible for that state’s ballot, the conservative U.S. Supreme Court helped Trump get around that constitutional roadblock.\n\nTrump’s lawyers argued that three key phrases — “having previously taken an oath,” “as an officer of the United States” and “engaged in insurrection” — didn’t apply to Trump. They combined ahistorical arguments with bad faith readings of the text, and specific word choice was interrogated to within an inch of its life. The court’s opinion in Trump v. Anderson — issued unanimously — sidestepped his lawyer’s outlandish readings of the text and found that while states can use Section 3 to block state or local office-seekers from the ballot, they can’t block a federal candidate.\n\nThere doesn’t seem to be much room for Trump to find a similar weak point in the 22nd Amendment, even if he demands that the Justice Department — which now includes several of the lawyers who helped keep him on the ballot last year — find a way for him to run again.\n\nUnlike the 14th Amendment, which was drafted over 100 years ago, the 22nd Amendment was written and ratified within some Americans’ living memory. There’s no mystery about what prompted its addition to the Constitution. In response to the outbreak of World War II, President Franklin D. Roosevelt chose to shatter the norm of U.S. presidents’ serving only two terms and ran for and won a third term. He then won a fourth presidential election in 1944, which shifted the politics of the issue dramatically.\n\nThe 22nd Amendment should stand as a testament to Congress seeing a long-established norm being undone and seeking to make it ironclad in law.\n\nCongressional Republicans and conservative Southern Democrats feared Roosevelt’s unprecedented four-term stretch could start a trend. Even though World War II was fresh in their minds, they made no exception that allowed for a two-term president to run again if the country is at war. Notably, they also limited the number of times a vice president who assumed the presidency could run again.\n\nIf anything, the 22nd Amendment should stand as a testament to Congress seeing a long-established norm being undone and seeking to make it ironclad in law. But despite the law’s being unequivocal, Trump told NBC News there “are methods which you could” use to seek a third term. He agreed that a hypothetical put before him would count, one in which he and Vice President JD Vance swap places on the ticket before Vance hands him back the top job.\n\nIn that, he seems to be taking inspiration from Russian President Vladimir Putin. After two terms, and barred from a third consecutive run, Putin became Russia’s prime minister in 2008, allowing Dmitry Medvedev to assume the presidency. Putin quickly changed his mind, swapping jobs back with Medvedev in 2012, and has remained president ever since.\n\nWhile I stand by my belief that Trump should have been disqualified from running again under the 14th Amendment, I can grudgingly admit that there were enough novel questions involved that Trump’s lawyers were able to craft a whole new subgenre of historical fiction in answering them. There is no such room for imagination in any case in which there’s even a possibility of Trump’s overstaying his term in office. The text of the 22nd Amendment is clearer than any past constitutional challenge he has instigated. And every judge he encounters is duty-bound to tell him so.",

        "title": "The cuts to Veteran Affairs aren’t going down well in Trump country",
        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "For about a decade or so, Donald Trump’s critics have asked what he could do that would finally turn his most devoted followers against him. That includes veterans, who told pollsters in 2024 that they overwhelmingly preferred him over Kamala Harris.\n\nWe may soon have our answer.\n\nOn Day 45 of President Trump’s second term, we learned that his administration was preparing to massively downsize the Department of Veteran Affairs, the federal agency that, among other things, connects veterans with health care and other services.\n\nTrump’s Veteran Affairs secretary, Doug Collins, said the president was “finally going to give the veterans what they want.”\n\nHe didn’t explain why shedding tens of thousands of VA workers brought on to expand services during the Joe Biden administration would give them what they want or what effect the cuts would have on the 2022 PACT Act, a bipartisan law enhancing screening and care for veterans exposed to toxins such as Agent Orange and burn pits.\n\nBut if the Trump administration’s plan is to tell veterans that “less is more,” it will be a hard sell. I’m from North Carolina, which has one of the largest veteran populations in America. My father was a veteran, one of many in my family. Lots of folks here are connected to one branch if not several.\n\nAnd never, never, have I heard one of them say that Veteran Affairs is doing too much for them.\n\nBefore the election, Trump promised to “serve and protect” veterans, but it’s hard to believe the lie when your VA appointment gets canceled because staff are being fired. Misdirection will only go so far when you can’t see a doctor.\n\nThis also comes from a president who referred to veterans as “losers” and “suckers” in private conversation, according to his former chief of staff, a retired four-star general in the Marine Corps.\n\nAlready, Trump’s plans for overhauling Veteran Affairs were not well received by many in my home state, which voted for the third time to give its Electoral College votes to Trump in 2024. North Carolina is home to several large bases, including Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune and Fort Bragg. These bases are deeply woven into their communities and cultures, and the military is one of our largest employers, too.\n\nThe news about Trump’s plans for the VA came days after his administration temporarily paused billions in contracting cuts at the agency that Collins falsely characterized as going to wasteful consultants writing “PowerPoint slides” and meeting minutes. Associated Press reporting revealed that the cuts included funds used for veterans’ cancer care and screening for toxic exposure.\n\n“I was always a Trump man, but when I saw that, that made me madder than hell,” one North Carolina reader wrote me recently after we at Cardinal & Pine covered the cuts.\n\nWhen you cover protests, and we’ve covered lots of them in recent days, it’s hard to tell sometimes if you’re getting the usual crowd at a protest, whether anyone has changed their mind. But you do start to recognize faces and places.\n\nMany of the folks we’re seeing today are new, and many of the people our reporters spoke to characterized themselves as politically agnostic. They’re angry — very angry, as when a North Carolina veteran confronted Republican Rep. Chuck Edwards at a recent town hall in Asheville, North Carolina.\n\nYou can get away with a lot of things in politics. Trump certainly has. He’s been forgiven for things that no politician in American history has been forgiven for.\n\nBut when your administration is directly responsible for making people less healthy and more sick — as Trump’s Veteran Affairs cuts will inevitably do — they will not forget you or forgive you.\n\nSome veterans knocked Biden for the sloppy exit from Afghanistan in 2021, but the dismantling of Veteran Affairs will be felt so much more keenly.\n\nThey’ll never get the image out of their head of a billionaire who got out of Vietnam because of a dubious “bone spurs” diagnosis — who’s allied with Elon Musk, another billionaire with no military experience — harming people who put everything on the line for their country.\n\nThey’ll protest you. They’ll make you a pariah. And, eventually, they’ll run you and your political allies out of office on a rail.\n\nSubscribe to Trump’s First 100 Days newsletter for weekly updates and expert insight on the key issues and figures defining his second term.",

Jeff Landry’s proposed constitutional amendments were soundly defeated Saturday — about twice as many voters voted against them as for them — he responded with insults, condescension and misinformation. The governor should have acknowledged that Louisianians didn’t want what he was selling and graciously accepted the will of the voters. Instead, as has become typical for some conservative politicians, the governor blamed political extremists and George Soros.\n\nAs has become typical for some conservative politicians, the governor blamed political extremists and George Soros.\n\n“Soros and far left liberals poured millions into Louisiana with propaganda and outright lies about Amendment 2,” Landry said in a statement. “Although we are disappointed in tonight’s results, we do not see this as a failure. We realize how hard positive change can be to implement in a State that is conditioned for failure.”\n\nHis statement is problematic for multiple reasons. Not only does he insult the good people of our state, but he also ignores that, as The Advocate newspaper of Baton Rouge reported, people from opposite sides of the political spectrum joined forces to thwart his plans to allow the formation of specialty courts in Louisiana, to move hundreds of millions of dollars from the state’s savings accounts into the general fund, to send more minors to adult prisons and to change the rules regarding some judicial elections.\n\nSoros has funded many worthy projects over the years, but Landry’s desperate attempt to make him the reason his amendments were rejected Saturday won’t fly. Our movement was built from the ground up, led by organizations — including mine, the Power Coalition for Equity and Justice — that have been working in Louisiana for years, organizations that communities trust. The people of this state came together, educated themselves and made an informed decision at the ballot box.\n\nThat is democracy in action and a defining moment that shows that despite the political headwinds, when we educate and we fight — we win.\n\nBut many conservatives talk as if there’s a villain — named Soros — behind every effort to oppose them. Elon Musk was heckled in Wisconsin on Saturday as he stumped for the conservative running for the state’s Supreme Court election. He said, “It was inevitable that at least a few Soros operatives would be in the audience.” While Soros had donated $2 million to Wisconsin’s Democratic Party during the judicial race, Musk and PACs he funds had put $20 million into the race that Democrat Susan Crawford won Tuesday.\n\nBut let’s be clear: Our victory here in Louisiana wasn’t about money or political insiders. It was about people. The Dignity and Liberty campaign was powered by a coalition of more than 50 organizations, all committed to protecting our communities and standing against harmful policies. At the heart of this fight was the leadership of Sarah Omojola at the Vera Institute, and Kristen Rome at the Louisiana Center for Children’s Rights, Power Coalition, VOTE (Voice of the Experienced), Invest in Louisiana and a network of trusted, community-based organizations worked together to ensure voters had a clear analysis and understanding of each amendment. Each of those organizations led its own education and outreach efforts.\n\nA volunteer with Louisiana's Power Coalition for Equity and Justice urged voters Saturday to oppose the four constitutional amendments on that day's ballot. All four amendments lost big. Power Coalition for Equity and Justice\n\nThis was organizing at its best. We took to the streets, held town halls and met people where they were. We broke down complex policies, listened to the concerns of everyday Louisianians and prompted those we met to understand the power of their voices and their votes.\n\nLouisiana officials routinely schedule amendment voters on dates when they think turnout will be abysmally low and only people motivated to vote yes will show up. That was the plan this time. The governor and House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., unaware that their microphones were on at a White House last week, were heard discussing the percentage of voters expected to show up.\n\n“What’s the anticipated turnout?” Johnson asks.\n\nLandry says, “Well, we thought it was going to be 12, but it looks like it might be 18%.”\n\n“That’d be huge for an election,” Johnson said, “I mean, for an amendment vote.”\n\nThe 21% turnout, though still low, was nearly double what Landry had thought it would be. And that was enough to send a signal. Black voters led the charge, making up 37% of early voters, and voters made it clear that they won’t stand for policies that put political interests over the well-being of their communities.\n\nYet, instead of respecting the will of the voters, the governor dismissed them, and conservative legislators are scrambling to put the same amendments back on a future ballot. Such tone-deaf leadership is why voter engagement is on the rise. Voters are clear their leaders aren’t listening to them.\n\nI don’t believe Louisiana is unique in that regard. I believe the spirit that animated voters here is spreading across the country and that politicians who are counting on public apathy to move their problematic agendas forward should be worried. Voters are tired of being ignored, and they refuse to be manipulated. And they will not sit idly by and watch what they love about their states and their country be destroyed.",

        "title": "Trump appears to be already laying the plans for a third term",
        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "On Sunday, President Donald Trump threw down the gauntlet to people who want to preserve constitutional democracy in this country. He told NBC’s Kristen Welker that he is “not joking” about the possibility of serving a third term, despite the 22nd Amendment’s prohibition on any person being “elected to the office of the President more than twice.”\n\nWhen asked how he would get around those words, Trump said ominously, “There are methods which you could do it.” I will leave it to others to identify loopholes in the language of the 22nd Amendment, assuming that the president cares about such niceties. Already, Trump is laying the groundwork for a third term, separate from the debates over the 22nd Amendment, by destroying or intimidating institutions that might stand in his way and claiming unconstitutional authority to control elections.\n\nAmericans are already struggling to keep up with the daily assaults on democracy, but we cannot afford to forget the future.\n\nWe saw further evidence of this strategy on Friday when the president brought another prominent American law firm to heel. The terms of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom’s surrender erode its independence, assure it will be a vassal of MAGA-world well into the future, and show Trump’s determination to ready the way to end free and fair presidential elections three years from now.\n\nAmericans are already struggling to keep up with the daily assaults on democracy, but we cannot afford to forget the future. Attacking, discrediting, intimidating and silencing both critics and the institutions that support criticism is familiar in regimes that seek to consolidate their power in the hope that they will never relinquish it. We see signs of this strategy in the president’s attack on law firms, universities, the free press and judges. His executive orders are consolidating his power and easing us toward a nondemocratic future.\n\nRecall that Trump urged his supporters last year to “get out and vote, just this time.” He explained that if they did, they “won’t have to do it anymore. Four more years, you know what, it will be fixed, it will be fine, you won’t have to vote anymore ... ”\n\nOn Sunday, the president signaled that even if the 2028 election is held as scheduled, he wants to ensure it would not be competitive, just as Viktor Orbán achieved in Hungary. What Trump would consider an achievement is, as The Atlantic’s Anne Applebaum writes, an autocratic takeover. Since Orban won a second term as Hungary’s president, he has mixed paeans to populism and family values with the destruction of press freedom and academic freedom and the politicization of the courts and the civil service. That has eased his way to claim emergency powers and amend Hungary’s constitution, even as the country has fallen into poverty and corruption has become legalized.\n\nHoward Simon, former executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union, explains that “capturing or marginalizing independent centers of thought and dissent that could challenge their authority” is what authoritarians do.\n\nThat brings us back to Skadden Arps, which last week became the second firm to cut a deal with the administration in the wake of Trump’s executive orders targeting various law firms. Skadden had not been the subject of an executive order, and three firms have already successfully challenged the orders in court. But Trump said the firm agreed to “essentially a settlement,” including “a total of at least $100 Million Dollars in pro bono Legal Services during the Trump Administration and beyond.”\n\nIf the president is thinking about how to stay in power in 2028, those who want to preserve democracy need to react accordingly.\n\nUnsurprisingly, the president insisted that some of the ransom he extracted from Skadden to stay out of his line of fire would be devoted to “ensuring fairness in our Justice System.” Note also, the open-ended phrases like “and beyond” and “at least.” Whatever happens in the 2028 election, you can rest assured that Skadden Arps will not represent anyone opposing Trump or seeking to hold him accountable.\n\nThe Washington Post reports that many other firms are unwilling to take on clients who are Trump opponents. “The president is following a playbook from other countries whose leaders have sought to undermine democratic systems and the rule of law, including Russia, Turkey, and Hungary,” writes the Post’s Michael Birnbaum. “Leaders in those countries have similarly attacked lawyers with the effect of hollowing out a pillar of justice systems to expand their power without violating existing laws.”\n\nIf that were not enough to convince pro-democracy forces to mobilize now to ensure we have a free and fair election in 2028. The president’s recent executive order on elections purports to seize powers for himself from both the states and the independent Election Assistance Commission. Linda Meyer, emeritus law professor at Quinnipiac University, says, “The decentralization of voting systems has been a guarantee of integrity in federal elections because federal employees in the current administration cannot control the entire process. This EO is targeted to wrest control over voting from states and allow the feds to get info about how each person votes.”\n\nIn what Meyer calls the “worst case scenario,” Trump can use his executive order to “target federal enforcement of this EO in [Democratic] areas and throw out votes there … while leaving [Republican] districts alone. Perhaps he can also find out exactly who voted for him and who didn’t and ‘investigate’ only those registrants who voted against him.”\n\nFor someone like Trump, who thinks an election can only be fair if he wins, the temptation to use his order that way may prove irresistible. For those who believe that the 2028 elections can be free and fair no matter what Trump does, the president’s executive order on elections proves that he thinks otherwise.\n\nAnd as The New Republic’s Michael Tomasky points out, Trump’s actions at the Defense Department, starting with the nomination of Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, have all been undertaken with the goal of “purging … an independent, rules-based military in favor of a military loyal to a single leader.” The result is that “there’s no one around to stop Trump from declaring martial law and suspending the Constitution or even an election.”\n\nRegardless of whether the courts rule on the constitutionality of a third term for Trump, he is already preparing to make their rulings moot through means that have nothing to with the 22nd Amendment. If the president is thinking about how to stay in power in 2028, those who want to preserve democracy need to react accordingly. Political leaders, lawyers and election experts must map a strategy for stopping the president. And the rest of us should prepare to copy the strategies for mass mobilization and protest used to save democracy in other countries. There is no time to waste.",

        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "On the fifth night of his second term, Donald Trump executed his first Friday Night News Dump, firing at least 18 inspectors general who were responsible for rooting out corruption, ethical lapses and mismanagement in federal agencies throughout the government. The president did not appear to have the legal authority to take such steps, but the Republican did it anyway.\n\nRoughly 10 weeks later, the White House still needs to replace many of the IGs who were ousted, and it was against this backdrop that Politico reported:\n\nPresident Donald Trump tapped a former House member who lost a scandal-tinged re-election bid last year to serve as the Labor Department’s internal watchdog as part of a slate of nominations for top jobs at the agency announced late Monday. Former Rep. Anthony D’Esposito, who worked as a New York City Police Department detective before being elected to Congress, was selected to serve as Labor’s inspector general.\n\nThe Politico report added that D’Esposito might be an “awkward fit” for the position, and it’s worth appreciating why.\n\nThe New York Republican arrived on Capitol Hill in early 2023, and it didn’t take long for the congressman to run into some trouble. Indeed, The New York Times reported in September 2024 that D’Esposito hired his fiancée’s daughter to work as a special assistant in his district office, paying her $3,800 a month in taxpayer money. Around the same time, the GOP congressman also reportedly added his mistress to his official payroll, generating a series of questions about the legal and ethical lines he apparently crossed.\n\nThe Times’ report, which was not independently verified by MSNBC or NBC News, added that his fiancée eventually found out about the affair and briefly broke up with him, at which point the New York Republican stopped paying both women.\n\nD’Esposito didn’t explicitly deny the accuracy of the reporting, though he did issue a statement that read in part, “My personal life has never interfered with my ability to deliver results for New York’s 4th district, and I have upheld the highest ethical standards of personal conduct.”\n\nThis was not persuasive to his constituents: D’Esposito, after having served just one term, narrowly lost his re-election bid in his competitive Long Island district.\n\nRoughly six months later, Trump — who has a curious habit of finding jobs for Republicans whom voters have rejected — has decided that D’Esposito should be the inspector general at the Department of Labor, where he would be expected to serve in an independent capacity, investigating ethical lapses, despite his own alleged ethical lapses.\n\nThis is a Senate-confirmed position. D’Esposito’s confirmation hearings are bound to be interesting.\n\nThis post updates our related earlier coverage.",

        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "The Eric Adams dismissal saga epitomizes much of the second Trump administration. For one thing, it’s a prime example of the Justice Department — led by Donald Trump’s personal lawyers from his criminal and impeachment cases — wielding the awesome power of the federal government for the president’s political ends.\n\nBut in the wake of Wednesday’s permanent dismissal of the corruption case against the New York City mayor, another thing that shouldn’t get lost in this sordid chapter is that it’s a testament to judicial independence in Trump 2.0.\n\nIndeed, the case’s ignoble ending could’ve been much worse.\n\nRecall that U.S. District Judge Dale Ho was faced with a brazen request from the Justice Department to dismiss the corruption charges only temporarily, and Adams agreed with that arrangement. Had Ho immediately rubber-stamped it, that would’ve left open the possibility that the Republican administration would later revive the charges, giving Trump political leverage over the Democratic mayor on matters of immigration enforcement and who knows what else.\n\nThe parties’ strained insistence that it wasn’t a quid pro quo only served to emphasize that it was.\n\nThe parties’ strained insistence that it wasn’t a quid pro quo only served to emphasize that it was.\n\nTo be sure, the Biden-appointed judge would’ve been within his rights to sign off on the transparently corrupt agreement. After all, it’s what both sides said they wanted at an unusual Feb. 19 hearing in Manhattan.\n\nBut in a masterstroke, the judge on Feb. 21 appointed a third party to present additional arguments on the matter, given the lack of adversarial testing that we typically see in the American legal system. The real genius of the appointment was in whom Ho tasked with the historic assignment: Paul Clement, not only one of the top lawyers out there but a bona fide conservative, to boot. Whatever the Democratic appointee would ultimately decide, it wouldn’t be a partisan hatchet job.\n\nAdams added another wrinkle himself Feb. 26 when he moved for a dismissal with prejudice. He claimed prosecutorial misconduct and the tainting of his presumption of innocence, due to negative information about him emerging in letters from prosecutors who resigned rather than move to dismiss his case without prejudice as the Trump DOJ instructed.\n\nClement’s March 7 brief backed the conclusion of a dismissal with prejudice. Dismissing the case without prejudice, Clement wrote, “creates a palpable sense that the prosecution outlined in the indictment and approved by a grand jury could be renewed, a prospect that hangs like the proverbial Sword of Damocles over the accused.”\n\nHo cited that language in his ruling Wednesday dismissing the case with prejudice, taking the DOJ to task in a lengthy opinion. He summarized the government’s position as wanting to ditch the case “because (1) it is tainted with impropriety; (2) it is detrimental to national security and immigration enforcement; and (3) it was a weak case to begin with — but the Court should also allow DOJ to bring the prosecution back at any time, for essentially any reason.”\n\nThe judge wrote that he “cannot and will not authorize such a result,” adding that the DOJ’s stated reasons for seeking dismissal, “if taken at face value, are inconsistent with a decision to leave the charges in the Indictment hanging like the proverbial Sword of Damocles over the Mayor.”\n\nHad the judge given the Trump DOJ exactly what it wanted, then that proverbial sword would’ve been left hanging over both the defendant and the city he’s tasked with serving. It would’ve also driven a sword through the justice system more than the Justice Department already has. But while the judge recognized that he can’t force the government to prosecute anyone, he declined to do its dirty work.\n\nSubscribe to the Deadline: Legal Newsletter for expert analysis on the top legal stories of the week, including updates from the Supreme Court and developments in the Trump administration’s legal cases.",

        "content": "Republicans’ war on abortion and Planned Parenthood could wind up curbing Medicaid patients’ health care for things having nothing to do with abortion — such as cancer screenings, blood work and annual physicals. Whether that happens could become clearer at a Supreme Court hearing Wednesday, which coincides with the broader GOP push for Medicaid cuts nationwide.\n\nThe technical legal issue before the justices deals with whether people who use the low-income assistance program can choose their providers and sue to enforce their rights.\n\nThe case started before the Supreme Court’s GOP-appointed majority overturned federal abortion rights in 2022. Four years earlier, South Carolina’s Republican governor, Henry McMaster, had sought to bar abortion clinics from Medicaid participation, and the state told Planned Parenthood that it could no longer service Medicaid beneficiaries.\n\nThat raised legal questions under part of the federal Medicaid Act known as the “free choice of provider” provision, which says states must let anyone eligible for assistance obtain the care from any “qualified” provider.\n\nA federal appeals court panel ruled against the state last year, reasoning that the provision “specifies an entitlement given to each Medicaid beneficiary: to choose one’s preferred qualified provider without state interference.”\n\nIn a decision written by Reagan appointee J. Harvie Wilkinson, the panel stressed that its ruling was about not abortion but rather “whether Congress conferred an individually enforceable right for Medicaid beneficiaries to freely choose their healthcare provider.”\n\nWilkinson noted that if Planned Parenthood clinics were to close in South Carolina, “other Medicaid-funded clinics in the state would be more hard-pressed to meet the demand in family planning care.” Siding with the provider and a woman insured through Medicaid who wanted to go there, the judge said that’s “precisely the prospect Congress wished to avoid.”\n\nThe state appealed to the Supreme Court, represented by the Christian legal group Alliance Defending Freedom, which litigates abortion and other issues aligned with Republican policies. In its high court petition, the state called the issue one of “great national importance.” The justices granted review and set oral argument for Wednesday. The Trump administration supports the state.\n\nAmong Planned Parenthood’s backers are Medicaid beneficiaries who told the justices in an amicus brief that they rely on the provider for health care services having nothing to do with abortion, “including annual physicals, blood work, screenings for various forms of cancer, infertility and prenatal services — indeed, some patients rely on Planned Parenthood for virtually all their healthcare needs.”\n\nThey wrote that their experiences show “just how important it is that the courthouse door remain open when States attempt to bar patients insured by Medicaid from seeking care from the qualified provider of their choice.”\n\nA decision in the case, known as Medina v. Planned Parenthood South Atlantic, is expected by July, when the court typically finishes issuing the term’s rulings.\n\nSubscribe to the Deadline: Legal Newsletter for expert analysis on the top legal stories of the week, including updates from the Supreme Court and developments in the Trump administration’s legal cases.",

        "content": "Technically, it’s called the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, but it’s better known by its initials: LIHEAP. At issue is a program that has long served as a lifeline for millions of low-income households struggling to cover their energy costs.\n\nIn Donald Trump’s first term as president, the Republican administration initially proposed steep cuts to LIHEAP, but in the face of bipartisan pushback, the White House ultimately backed off.\n\nEight years later, the issue is back with a vengeance — and this time, Trump and his team appear to be advancing their goals more effectively. NBC News reported:\n\nThe Trump administration on Tuesday eliminated the entire staff of a federal program that helps low-income households pay utility bills, sources said. The staff of 10 employees accounted for only a small fraction of the 10,000 layoffs included in Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s purge of the Department of Health and Human Services. But those who work closely with the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, or LIHEAP, now fear for its future.\n\nThe report quoted Andrew Germain, who was director of fiscal operations and accountability for the Administration for Children and Families, the HHS division that leads dozens of programs from welfare assistance to child abuse prevention, saying: “Ultimately, I believe the program will crumble from within without the federal office there to manage it.”Germain added, “For the communities that need the funding and need the support of the federal office, they’re going to be without those resources. You’re talking about individuals who rely on crisis assistance from the LIHEAP program to keep the power on, whether it be for a medical reason or some other potentially life-threatening purpose.”\n\nCNN had a related report, which quoted Mark Wolfe, executive director of the National Energy Assistance Directors Association. He told the network that he didn’t see how the agency can “allocate the remaining $387 million in funds for this year without federal staff. The program could well grind to a halt.”\n\nI frequently find myself thinking about a report from The Washington Post that was published the day after Christmas, which highlighted the perspectives of several low-income voters who supported the Trump ticket in the November election. The article specifically referenced a middle-aged Pennsylvania woman who struggled to make ends meet despite receiving food stamps and Social Security benefits, who explained why she voted for the Republican ticket.\n\nTrump “is more attuned to the needs of everyone instead of just the rich,” the woman told the Post. “I think he knows it’s the poor people that got him elected, so I think Trump is going to do more to help us.”\n\nIt’s difficult to count the number of steps the Republican president and his team have taken since then that have left low-income families worse off.",

        "content": "Prosecutors this week decided not to pursue an assault charge against a man whom Rep. Nancy Mace accused of having \"physically accosted\" her at the U.S. Capitol in December.\n\nAccording to a filing Tuesday with D.C. Superior Court, prosecutors dropped the lone charge against James McIntyre, a foster care advocate. Mace, R-S.C., had accused McIntyre of \"aggressively\" shaking her arm up and down at a Dec. 10 event celebrating 25 years of the Foster Care Independence Act. He had pleaded not guilty, court filings showed.\n\nThe D.C. District Attorney's Office, which was prosecuting the case, did not respond to a request for comment on why it decided to drop the charge of assaulting a government official.\n\nFollow live politics coverage here\n\nA spokesperson for Mace’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment Wednesday night. But Mace and repeated her assault claims in a statement to the youth- and family-focused news site The Imprint, which first reported on dismissal of the case.\n\n“When a man can physically assault a woman in the halls of Congress, with impunity, it sends an appalling message to every woman in America. If it can happen here, it can happen anywhere,” Mace said. “I filed charges, and they were inexplicably ignored. But I will not be. I will not back down. I will not be intimidated. And I sure as hell won’t stay silent.”\n\nAn attorney for McIntyre declined to comment.\n\nAn incident report said Mace told officers after the encounter that McIntyre “began to aggressively and in an exaggerated manner shake her arm up and down in a hand shaking motion\" that left her arm flailing for three to five seconds. The report noted that Mace described to officers feeling \"intimidated and unable to pull away when she tried.”\n\nElliott Hinkle, an eyewitness who attended the event, had disputed Mace’s account, saying the two shook hands “and James says, ‘Trans youth are also foster youth, and they need your support.’ And then sat down.”\n\nMace denied help from paramedics when it was offered, according to the incident report. She said later that night on X that she was “physically accosted\" at the Capitol by \"a pro-tr*ns man.”\n\nThe next day, Mace shared an image of herself with her right arm in a sling. She repeated the allegations against McIntyre on X in January, saying she was \"assaulted by a pro tr*ns man a few weeks ago and am still in physical therapy for my injuries. I know firsthand how the Left is capable of doing real physical harm.\"\n\nMace has a record of using anti-trans rhetoric.\n\nIn November, she introduced a measure to bar lawmakers and House employees from “using single-sex facilities other than those corresponding to their biological sex.” She said the legislation was a direct response to the election of Rep. Sarah McBride, D-Del., as the first openly transgender member of Congress.\n\n“I’m absolutely 100% going to stand in the way of any man who wants to be in a women’s restroom, in our locker rooms, in our changing rooms,\" Mace told reporters at the time. \"I will be there fighting you every step of the way.”\n\nThe House this year, under Republican control, prohibited transgender people from using single-sex facilities that align with their gender identities in the House chamber and halls.",

        "content": "Global markets reacted sharply and swiftly after President Donald Trump revealed his much-anticipated tariff plans Wednesday, with investors fleeing U.S. stock indexes and stocks of companies that rely on global supply chains plummeting.\n\nS&P 500 futures, which indicate where it is likely to open Thursday, plunged 3%. Nasdaq 100 futures sold off by more than 4%, and Dow futures slid about 1,000 points, or 2%.\n\nThose indexes just endured their worst quarter in years in large part because of growing concern about the economic impacts of Trump's expected tariff plan.\n\nGlobal markets also posted significant losses just minutes into their trading days. Japan's Nikkei 225 index plunged more than 4.1%, and South Korea's Kospi stock average fell more than 2.5%. Australia's ASX 200 dipped about 2%. ETFs (exchange-traded funds) that track specific countries, such as India, tumbled about 3%, while one that tracks Europe slid 2%, and the China ETF fell 3.8%.\n\nBut initial market indications early Wednesday evening were that many investors had expected Trump's tariffs to be far less expansive. In addition to a flat 10% tariff on all trading partners, Trump announced reciprocal tariffs that would tax many trading partners more than 20%.\n\n\"President Trump just finished his tariff speech at the White House and we would characterize this slate of tariffs as 'worse than the worst case scenario' the Street was fearing,\" Dan Ives, an analyst at the investment firm Wedbush Securities, wrote in a note sent Wednesday.\n\nThat could make things very difficult for large U.S. companies that are deeply integrated into the global economy. Shares of Apple dropped nearly 7%, Amazon 6% and Walmart 5%.\n\nNike, which produced 50% of its footwear in Vietnam last year, plummeted 7% in after-hours trading.\n\nShares of dollar store chains, which import many of their most popular goods, also faced steep losses. Five Below plunged 13.5%, and Dollar Tree sold off more than 11%.\n\nAsked whether he was concerned by the market moves, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told Bloomberg Television that he has “learned not to look at what goes on during after-hours markets.”\n\nBessent added that the Nasdaq has a \"'mag7' problem, not a MAGA problem,\" referring to seven large tech stocks often called the \"magnificent 7.\"\n\nGeneral Motors and Ford dropped less than 1%, but Jeep owner Stellantis tumbled almost 2%. Stellantis has more manufacturing in Europe than the other U.S. automakers.\n\nGoldman Sachs estimated that the price of a foreign-made car could soar by up to $15,000 under Trump's tariffs. Even a vehicle assembled in the United States could face a price hike of up to $8,000, according to the bank's analysts.",

        "title": "Republicans aren't panicking about Trump or Elon Musk after Tuesday’s elections",
        "source": "https://www.nbcnews.com/",
        "content": "Republicans say they’re not panicking as they gear up for major races later this year and a fierce battle for control of Congress next year, despite getting shellacked in the Wisconsin Supreme Court race — and seeing their margins decrease notably in a pair of special House election wins in deep-red Florida districts.\n\nDemocrats have largely cast the 10-point win by the liberal candidate in Wisconsin’s Supreme Court race on Tuesday as a rejection by voters of Elon Musk, the billionaire White House adviser who took on a starring role in the campaign. And while the two wins by GOP candidates in Florida gave the party some breathing room with their narrow House majority, the size of their victories paled in comparison to what Republicans enjoyed in those districts five months ago.\n\nRepublicans, however, downplayed the results as expected outcomes — criticizing some of the Republican candidates, discounting the prospect of any broader fallout from the heavy-handed role Musk played in Wisconsin, and suggesting that their candidates do a better job doubling down on explaining to voters Trump’s accomplishments, including divisive ones like his Department of Government Efficiency.\n\nThey’re also focused on how to get the voters who put Trump over the top in 2024 to come out for other elections and candidates.\n\nDemocrats have found some early success demonizing Musk in the Wisconsin race and believe they can expand that strategy. But while Musk will “continue to be active” in GOP campaigns, his prominent role in the party may be about to change: Trump told members of his Cabinet on March 24, more than a week before Tuesday’s elections, that Musk would leave his government role in the administration in the coming months.\n\n“I think a spring, off-year election with the deck stacked against you isn’t necessarily a fair analysis of Musk’s impact,” said one Virginia-based Republican strategist about whether the party would be wise to draw conclusions from the Wisconsin Supreme Court race.\n\nNational Republican Congressional Committee spokesman Mike Marinella said in a Tuesday night statement that Democrats “set their cash ablaze” in the deep-red Florida districts.\n\n“Florida’s resounding Republican victories send a clear message: Americans are fired up to elect leaders who will fight for President Trump’s agenda and reject the Democrats’ failed policies,” Marinella said.\n\nSen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., said Musk’s presence in his state was a net-positive: “He didn’t hurt, he just helped,” Johnson said of the recent race.\n\nAnd Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis swept aside the idea of the closer margins in Florida’s 6th Congressional District generating any broader concerns for the party. DeSantis blamed Republican Randy Fine’s 12-point margin — down from 30-plus points for Trump in the district last year — on Fine himself, saying the state legislator, with whom DeSantis has clashed in the past, was a lackluster candidate.\n\n“He repels people,” DeSantis said of Fine, adding that it “was unique problems with this candidate that was causing this to be a close race.”\n\nOverall, said Jeanette Hoffman, a GOP strategist from New Jersey, which will host a gubernatorial race later this year, “I’m not seeing huge warning signs.”\n\n“I’m seeing status quo in these elections, and I think Republicans need to focus on running excellent local campaigns based on local issues and making sure their voters turn out in November,” Hoffman continued.\n\nDemocrats believe Tuesday’s results show that their party has momentum ahead of this year’s governor’s races in New Jersey and Virginia, as well as next year’s midterms more broadly. The Republican Senate majority looks well-defended, but Democrats need to net just five seats to flip the House.\n\n“Republicans are running scared,” Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee Chairman Suzan DelBene, D-Wash., told NBC News. “And they should be, because they’re not listening to American people. Their agenda is not popular.”\n\nMusk effect\n\nDemocrats are also signaling they believe Musk could be an effective boogeyman for the party moving forward.\n\n“In this short period of time since the last election, we saw in these Florida elections, these bright red districts, the margins cut more than in half. And it’s because folks are rejecting the Trump-Musk agenda,” DelBene said.\n\nSam Newton, a spokesperson for the Democratic Governors Association, made it clear that the party was preparing to make the 2025 gubernatorial races about Musk and Trump, largely by charging DOGE with ruining lives by taking away government jobs and funding — a uniquely salient message in Virginia, which is home to more than 340,000 federal workers.\n\n“That’s where a lot of the DOGE effort is having the largest negative impacts,” Newton said. He added that it wouldn’t matter whether Musk left the administration imminently — or even curtailed his spending in the races later this year.\n\n“They can try to run from Elon Musk, but it’s too late,” he said.\n\nRepublicans in Virginia, however, dismissed those warning shots, forecasting that the party would do more to further build the identity of the main Republican candidate in the race, Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears.\n\n“Virginia voters are smart enough to understand that they’re electing a governor,” said another GOP operative in the state. “They understand who is on the ballot: It’s not Elon Musk. It’s not anybody in the federal government. It’s going to be [Democratic candidate] Abigail Spanberger and Winsome Sears.”\n\nBut Ed Rollins, a longtime GOP operative who is running a super PAC supporting conservative radio host Bill Spadea in the New Jersey governor’s race, suggested Musk may be better suited as a traditional billionaire political benefactor for GOP campaigns than as a top surrogate.\n\n”My preference would be to have his millions of dollars to spend and have him send a check. I don’t think he wants to campaign anymore than he already has. It’s kind of a novelty for him,” said Rollins.\n\n“Campaigning is a whole different perspective and you’ve got to move away from the sideshows,” Rollins later added. “And he was a sideshow obviously in Wisconsin.”\n\nFocus on turnout\n\nSome Republicans did say that Tuesday’s results showed that the GOP faces a persistent challenge in turning out Trump voters when the president is not on the ballot.\n\n“Special elections and off-cycle elections will continue to be a problem without a change of strategy,” conservative activist Charlie Kirk wrote on X Tuesday night, after referring to the party’s reliance on more sporadic voters.\n\n“The base that came out to support Donald Trump during the presidential election, a lot of those voters stayed home,” said Hoffman, the New Jersey GOP strategist. “And we’re going to see a much lower turnout in the New Jersey governor’s race than we did in the presidential race last year. So both parties really need to look at getting their base out and making sure their turnout operation’s top notch.”\n\nHoffman said that turnout effort will hinge on affordability-focused messaging, with a high cost of living being the top issue in the high-tax state of New Jersey. She noted that Trump’s involvement in the race “would certainly help to bring out the Republican base.”\n\nTwo of the top candidates in the New Jersey race — Spadea and former state Assemblyman Jack Ciattarellii — have closely aligned with Trump, both meeting with the president last month at his Bedminster, New Jersey, golf club.\n\nOne of the GOP candidates, state Sen. Jon Bramnick, has been more critical of the president generally. But he did not see Tuesday’s results as signs that aligning with Trump is a problematic strategy.\n\n“November is not going to be based on who you’re with, who you like, who likes you. It’s going to be: Are people tired of one-party rule in Trenton? I think the Democrats are very, very nervous in that regard, and they probably should be,” Bramnick said.\n\nThe two Virginia Republican operatives who said the path to victory for the GOP candidate in the race would rely on her ability to tie herself closely to Trump and to the state’s popular Gov. Glenn Youngkin, who is term-limited.\n\n“You need to make certain that you’re locking arms with the president because he’s seized the mantle of common sense — that’s really powerful, and you need to lean back into that,” said one of the operatives.\n\nTurning out those Trump voters will also be key for Republicans looking to hold onto control of Congress in next year’s midterm elections.\n\nDemocrats need to net four seats to take control of the Senate. Just one GOP senator, Maine’s Susan Collins, is running in a state that former Vice President Kamala Harris won in November, so Democrats will be targeting some seats in states Trump won.\n\nDemocrats will also have to reach into Trump territory to net the five seats they need to flip the House. While Democrats have plenty of ripe targets in districts that were decided by close margins last year, DelBene demurred on whether Tuesday’s results show that redder districts are in play.\n\n“Our job and our focus is making sure we take back the majority in the House. It still is, and we are going to be playing in districts across the country to make sure we win,” DelBene said.",

        "title": "CDC's IVF team gutted even as Trump calls himself the 'fertilization president'",
        "source": "https://www.nbcnews.com/",
        "content": "A team that tracked how well in vitro fertilization worked across the U.S. was abruptly cut Tuesday as part of the sweeping layoffs at the Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nThe elimination of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Assisted Reproductive Technology Surveillance team — a group of six epidemiologists, data analysts and researchers — shocked public health experts and IVF advocates who said they had felt encouraged by President Donald Trump’s comments supporting access to the infertility treatment.\n\nJust last week, Trump declared himself “the fertilization president” while touting efforts to expand IVF.\n\n“Fertilization,” Trump said at a White House event on March 26 to commemorate Women’s History Month. “I’m still very proud of it, I don’t care. I’ll be known as the fertilization president and that’s OK.”\n\nBut Barbara Collura, the president and CEO of RESOLVE: The National Infertility Association, a nonprofit group for reproductive health, said one of Trump’s best assets to address IVF was now gone.\n\n“This is a big handicap for the administration as they embrace IVF and want to expand coverage,” Collura said. “These are the right people to have at your side.”\n\nAaron Levine, a professor of public policy at Georgia Tech who has worked with the CDC team over the last decade, called it an “immediate loss” for patients who want to make a well-informed decision.\n\n“The data was produced at the clinic level every year, so you could say, ‘Is this clinic successful 15% of the time, 20% of the time, 25% of the time,’” he said. “And you can imagine that is super valuable information for patients considering IVF, or maybe considering IVF at multiple clinics, and trying to make their choices.”\n\nDr. Brian Levine, founding partner and practice director of CCRM Fertility of New York, said about 1 in 6 people experience infertility both globally and in the U.S.\n\nIVF was first used in the 1970s. It involves combining eggs and sperm in the lab to create embryos. Those embryos are then implanted in a woman’s uterus.\n\nIVF is the most common type of infertility treatment in the U.S., according to the CDC. More than 8 million babies have been born via IVF since 1978, according to the Cleveland Clinic.\n\nThe success rate varies, with age being the strongest factor. Women younger than 35 have a success rate of around 46%, according to the Cleveland Clinic. That drops to 22% for women at age 38.\n\nPatients deserve to know the success rates of each clinic, and the elimination of the CDC group gives them one less resource, Brian Levine said.\n\n“Patients are highly motivated for treatments because they want a family, but they’re also walking in a state of sometimes despair,” he said.\n\nKnowing the success rates also helps keep clinics accountable, forcing them to make changes that could help improve the quality of care.\n\n“When you have a pervasive disease like this, it gives a lot of women angst,” Brian Levine said, referring to infertility. “We typically report to the CDC, so I know that my colleagues across the country are practicing to the same standards.”\n\nA 'tremendous resource'\n\nThe Assisted Reproductive Technology Surveillance team was mandated by Congress in 1992. It worked under the CDC’s Division of Reproductive Health, which was also gutted Tuesday.\n\nThe team was responsible for monitoring and tracking outcomes related to IVF, including whether women gave birth to multiples or delivered prematurely, to ensure both the safety and success of the procedure.\n\nIt also provided tools to the public, including an “IVF success estimator” that allowed people to plug in information about themselves and get an estimate of how well IVF would work. People could also look up each individual clinic’s success rates across the U.S.\n\nIt also did research on different IVF topics, including how to make it more efficient with fewer side effects, and how to make the extremely expensive procedure more accessible.\n\n“They’re a tremendous resource within the government,” Collura said. “They’re also public-facing. All the content is on the CDC website; they’re putting out all the information for patients.”\n\n“I rely on their information and their data to do my work,” she added. “I’m not sure what that’s going to look like now going forward.”\n\nOne CDC worker on the team who was terminated Tuesday tried to reconcile Trump’s comments on IVF and the mass layoffs.\n\nThe worker, who asked not to be identified because they were not authorized to speak with the media, said the group was preparing to publish new data on the success rates of IVF across states, but now that work has stopped indefinitely.\n\n“It’s surprising to me,” the worker said. “President Trump said he was the fertility president. How does cutting this program support that?”\n\nAn official at the Department of Health and Human Services said that “the work will continue” — although they didn’t provide details on how or when the administration would continue to track and collect data on IVF.\n\n“We are focused on implementing and bringing Secretary Kennedy’s high-level vision of HHS’ transformation to life,” the official said in. an emailed statement. “The Department is mapping out what each of the 15 redefined divisions will look like at a detailed level and will share more information soon.”\n\nAaron Levine, of Georgia Tech, noted that there are other groups that track IVF outcomes, such as the Society for Assisted Reproductive Technology, a professional group, although the data appears to be more limited.\n\nIn a statement, Micah Hill, president of the Society for Assisted Reproductive Technology, called the cuts to the IVF group “dangerous and devastating.”\n\n“The depth of expertise held by CDC personnel will be difficult to replace,” Hill said. “In many ways, the American public health system has been the global leader, and we are now in danger of throwing that away and doing so in a manner that may be very difficult to recover from.”",

        "title": "ACLU sues National Institutes of Health for ‘ideological purge’ of research projects",
        "source": "https://www.nbcnews.com/",
        "content": "The American Civil Liberties Union filed a lawsuit Wednesday alleging that the National Institutes of Health has conducted an “ongoing ideological purge of critical research projects” that violates federal law and is unconstitutional.\n\nThe lawsuit, filed in Massachusetts district court on behalf of four researchers and three unions with members who rely on NIH funding, says that the federal science agency “abruptly cancelled” hundreds of research projects “without scientifically-valid explanation or cause.”\n\nThe lawsuit says NIH has justified its cancellations with “ideological purity directives” about research related to diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI), vaccine hesitancy and gender identity, among other topics.\n\n“The new arbitrary regime is not codified in any law or policy,” the lawsuit says, adding that NIH has “failed to develop any guidelines, definitions or explanations” that explain “the parameters of the agency’s prohibitions against research with some connection to DEI, gender, and other topics that fail Defendants’ ideological conformity screen.”\n\nThe new lawsuit lists the NIH; its director, Jay Bhattacharya; the U.S. Department of Human and Health Services; and its director, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., as defendants. Both federal agencies said they would not comment on pending litigation.\n\nThe Center for Science in the Public Interest and Protect Democracy Project are working with the ACLU on the lawsuit.\n\nIt is one of several legal challenges the Trump administration now faces as it attempts to cut research funding, change how it is allocated or reduce academic emphasis on diversity, among other issues.\n\nAfter several legal complaints, a Massachusetts judge in February halted an NIH effort to limit its funding for indirect costs, which would have dramatically slashed how much funding the federal government provides to research agencies for things like equipment, maintenance, utilities and support staff. Other lawsuits have challenged funding freezes across the federal government and the administration’s ban on DEI programs.\n\n“Our case is specifically addressing NIH’s lawless grant terminations and their upending of the grant review process for applicants,” Olga Akselrod, senior counsel at the ACLU Racial Justice Program, said in a phone interview. “These sweeping actions have disrupted hundreds of research grants, derailed really crucial research and are upending the careers of the most promising scientists in the United States with really no clear rationale.”\n\nThe lawsuit says at least 678 research projects have been terminated by NIH, including work on breast cancer, Alzheimer’s disease and HIV prevention, among other topics.\n\nThe lawsuit says the canceled grants amounted to more than $2.4 billion. Of that total, about $1.3 billion had already been spent. Another $1.1 billion was expected to be distributed to grantees by NIH before it was revoked.\n\n“NIH’s cancelling of research midstream effectively discards an enormous amount of money in investments and years of work dedicated to answering some of the most pressing biomedical questions of our time,” Akselrod said. “You can’t just turn research on and off like a faucet.”\n\nThe plaintiff researchers include Brittany Charlton, a professor at Harvard Medical School, who founded the LGBTQ Health Center of Excellence at Harvard’s T.H. Chan School of Public Health.\n\nCharlton, whose research focuses on LGBTQ health inequities in cancer and reproductive health, among other topics, has had five grants terminated by NIH since February, according to the lawsuit.\n\nAnother plaintiff, Katie Edwards, had six grants canceled since February, the lawsuit says. Edwards, a professor at the University of Michigan School of Social Work, has focused on research about preventing sexual violence in minority communities, including among Indigenous youth and LGBTQ+ communities.",

        "content": "Goods imported from China will now face a combined total tariff rate of 54%, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Wednesday.\n\nBessent confirmed on Bloomberg Television that all goods imported from China would face a new 34% rate based on White House calculations of what it currently imposes on U.S. exports, plus the existing 20% rate Trump had already imposed against it in the initial weeks of his administration.\n\nBessent added that while there may be room for discussions with Trump about that rate, he would most likely stand pat for now.\n\n\"It’s going to be up to President Trump to see what he wants to do. I think the mindset might be to let things settle for a while,” Bessent said, adding: “I am sure there are going to be a lot of calls. I just don’t know if there’s going to be negotiations.”\n\nThe United States imports nearly $500 billion worth of goods from China every year, making it the third-largest source of foreign goods. Big-box retailers rely heavily on China for low-cost sourcing — and their stocks fell in after-hours trading Wednesday.\n\nTarget was down as much as 5.5%, while Walmart was off 4.7%.\n\nChinese authorities had not yet responded to Trump's remarks late Wednesday. A spokesperson for the country's U.S. Embassy did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nMarkets and trading partners alike have reacted severely to Trump's tariffs plan, which seeks to disrupt long-standing global trading arrangements. The prime minister of Australia, which has extensive trade with China, said the new duties, which would take effect next week, will harm not just long-standing partners but also U.S. families.\n\n“The administration’s tariffs have no basis in logic, and they go against the basis of our two nations’ partnership. This is not the act of a friend,” Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said at a news conference Thursday morning in Melbourne, according to Bloomberg News. “Today’s decision will add to uncertainty in the global economy, and it will push up costs for American households.”",

        "content": "President Donald Trump has favored tariffs for years. His expanding trade war is sure to ripple through the global economy for a long while, too.\n\nThat’s because ramping up tariffs on foreign governments frequently draws retaliation — a likelihood that even industries Trump aims to support are already bracing for. While he has been rolling out an ever-shifting series of import taxes for months, the sweeping “reciprocal” tariffs he announced Wednesday are opening salvos in what could become drawn-out tit-for-tats with potentially dozens of governments.\n\nUnlike the narrower, targeted tariffs Trump imposed on certain countries and products in his first term, his latest duties are set to rewrite the rules of global trade on a far broader level — and in an environment in which inflation is running hotter.\n\n“This is a game changer, not only for the U.S. economy but for the global economy,” Olu Sonola, head of U.S. economic research at Fitch Ratings, said in a note Wednesday evening.\n\n“Many countries will likely end up in a recession. You can throw most forecasts out the door, if this tariff rate stays on for an extended period of time,” she said, adding that the levels Trump is introducing haven’t been seen since 1910.\n\nAlready, the administration is signaling it’s uninterested in diplomacy, raising the odds that foreign leaders will hit back with more levies of their own rather than press for talks.\n\n“This is not a negotiation,” a senior White House official told reporters Wednesday evening. “It’s a national emergency.”\n\nThe European Union has threatened countermeasures by mid-April, and Canada warned last week that it was preparing retaliatory moves to respond swiftly to any trade actions the United States were to unveil Wednesday.\n\nRead the full story here.",

        "content": "Val Kilmer, the actor known for his roles in \"Top Gun\" and \"Heat,\" died from pneumonia Tuesday night in Los Angeles after having struggled for years with throat cancer that permanently altered his voice.\n\nKilmer, 65, was first diagnosed with throat cancer in 2014 and recovered before he ultimately underwent painful treatments that included a tracheostomy. His daughter confirmed his death from pneumonia Tuesday to The Associated Press.\n\nDirector Michael Mann said Wednesday on Instagram: \"While working with Val on 'Heat,' I always marveled at the range, the brilliant variability within the powerful current of Val’s possessing and expressing character.\n\n\"After so many years of Val battling disease and maintaining his spirit, this is tremendously sad news.\"\n\nDespite the brutal toll cancer took, Kilmer said he never felt bad about his health issues.\n\n\"I have behaved poorly. I have behaved bravely. I have behaved bizarrely to some. I deny none of this and have no regrets, because I have lost and found parts of myself that I never knew existed,” Kilmer, a longtime smoker, said in “Val,” the 2021 documentary about his career. “And I am blessed.\"\n\nKilmer famously revived his \"Iceman\" role in \"Top Gun: Maverick,\" bringing his real-life struggles to screen as a cancer-inflicted commander who eventually dies during the sequel.\n\n“I have no regrets,” Kilmer told the AP in 2021. “I’ve witnessed and experienced miracles.”\n\nKilmer initially kept his cancer from the public, disclosing it only in 2017 during a Reddit Q&A. He disclosed it after Michael Douglas revealed that both he and Kilmer were fighting throat cancer.\n\nKilmer once recalled that, early in his cancer battle in 2015, he got horribly sick while he was staying with his former lover and longtime friend Cher.\n\n\"One night, I suddenly awoke vomiting blood that covered the bed like a scene out of 'The Godfather,'\" Kilmer wrote in his 2020 memoir, \"I’m Your Huckleberry.\"\n\n\"I prayed immediately then called 911. Then alerted my hostess. Cher stepped in and stepped up.”\n\nCher paid tribute to Kilmer on Wednesday, calling him \"BRILLIANT as Mark Twain\" and \"BRAVE here during ur sickness.\"\n\nIn a rare interview on ABC's \"Good Morning America\" in 2020, Kilmer disclosed that he had to undergo a tracheostomy to help him breathe, an invasive throat procedure that forever altered his distinctive voice.\n\nHe also underwent chemotherapy and radiation.\n\n\"I feel a lot better than I sound, but I feel wonderful,\" he said. \"I was diagnosed with throat cancer, which healed very quickly. This is a tracheotomy to help me breathe because the glands in my throat swelled up, as well.\"\n\nKilmer, however, still managed to find humor in such a devastating development.\n\nAsked what he missed about losing his voice, he said on \"Good Morning America\": \"That I had one! And that I didn’t laugh like a pirate.\"\n\nIn a 2021 cover story for People magazine, Kilmer declared himself fit and cancer-free.\n\nHis son, Jack, 29 at the time, told the magazine: “He has crazy energy. He can’t be stopped. He wants to go out there and be the best that he can be.”\n\nDespite that proclamation, years of cancer treatment can take an awful toll and leave a body unable to fend off disease, said Dr. Robert Alter, division chief of head and neck oncology at Hackensack Meridian's John Theurer Cancer Center in New Jersey.\n\n\"The body's composition of all these different elements can be slowly torn down. And I think if you're nutritionally deficient, your body slows down,\" Alter told NBC News.\n\n\"Your body just gets weaker, and I think your body just cannot fight as much off. We deal with some cancers, and sometimes these infections become overwhelming.\"\n\nAlter watched \"Top Gun: Maverick\" on Wednesday and was moved by Kilmer's line from the movie “It’s time to let go.”\n\nHe said he couldn't help thinking of patients who have bravely taken on the disease but had more left to give.\n\n\"You know, there's an unfortunate difference between living and existing,\" he said. \"And I truly believe that when one sort of feels as if the fight cannot be fought anymore, they realize that it's time to sort of let go.\"",

        "title": "Senate passes measure to revoke new Canada tariffs as four Republicans break with Trump",
        "source": "https://www.nbcnews.com/",
        "content": "WASHINGTON — A group of Senate Republicans delivered a rare rebuke to President Donald Trump on Wednesday, helping to pass a resolution to block his tariffs on Canadian products as he escalated his broader trade war.\n\nThe Senate voted 51-48 in favor of a Democratic-led measure to revoke Trump’s Canadian tariffs. Four Republicans — Sens. Susan Collins of Maine; Rand Paul and Mitch McConnell of Kentucky; and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska — joined all 47 Democrats in supporting it.\n\nThe resolution, authored by Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., is not expected to go anywhere in the House. Still, it represented a significant break in the party from Trump the day he announced a new set of sweeping tariffs, which the White House billed as \"Liberation Day,\" and after the president publicly pressured the four GOP senators on the issue.\n\n“If these tariffs go into effect, it will be so harmful,\" Collins said in a speech on the Senate floor ahead of the vote. \"And as price hikes always do, they will hurt those the most who can afford them the least.”\n\nCollins ticked through industry workers in Maine who would be particularly affected by a trade war, such as lobstermen, blueberry growers and potato farmers.\n\nIn Kentucky, home to a booming $9 billion bourbon industry, distillers are grappling with boycotts and retaliatory tariffs from Canada.\n\n\"Tariffs on Canada will threaten us with a recession. I mean, it's a terrible, terrible idea,\" Paul told reporters Wednesday.\n\nIn a lengthy statement after the vote, McConnell warned that the tariffs could have \"long-term consequences right in our backyard,\" pointing to the nearly 70,000 Kentucky family farms that sell crops around the world or the Kentuckians who craft 95% of the world's bourbon.\n\n\"Tariffs make it more expensive to do business in America, driving up costs for producers and consumers across the board,\" said McConnell, the former longtime Senate Republican leader.\n\nRepublicans control the Senate, but Democrats — led by Kaine and Mark Warner, of Virginia, and Amy Klobuchar, of Minnesota — were able to use a legislative procedure to force a vote to end the national emergency that Trump is using to carry out his tariffs. A simple majority was needed to pass the resolution.\n\n“Many of my Republican colleagues in Congress have already expressed concerns about these tariffs, so the Senate’s upcoming vote on our legislation provides senators with the perfect opportunity to show Americans that they will stand up for their constituents and reverse the President’s disastrous economic policies,” Kaine said in a statement.\n\nTrump singled out the four Senate Republicans by name Wednesday on Truth Social and urged them to reject the Canada resolution. He has argued the those specific tariffs are needed because Canada is not doing enough to halt fentanyl and other illegal drugs from coming across the northern border.\n\n\"Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, and Rand Paul, also of Kentucky, will hopefully get on the Republican bandwagon, for a change,\" Trump wrote.\n\n\"The Senate Bill is just a ploy of the Dems to show and expose the weakness of certain Republicans, namely these four, in that it is not going anywhere because the House will never approve it and I, as your President, will never sign it,\" he continued.\n\nAt a White House event Wednesday, Trump formally announced reciprocal tariffs on some of America’s largest trading partners, including key allies like Canada, Mexico and the European Union. They include a 25% tariff on all foreign-made automobiles, beginning at midnight.\n\n“This is one of the most important days, in my opinion, in American history. It’s our declaration of economic independence,” Trump said in a Rose Garden address. “For years, hard-working American citizens were forced to sit on the sidelines as other nations got rich and powerful, much of it at our expense. But now it’s our turn to prosper. Jobs and factories will come roaring back into our country. ... This will be, indeed, the golden age of America.”\n\nIn a letter to House and Senate Republicans this week, David McIntosh, president of the conservative Club for Growth, warned about “the ongoing anticipation of a volatile economic impact caused by tariffs — including the looming ‘Liberation Day’ — April 2nd, 2025, where Trump’s tariffs will potentially hit every country.”\n\n“What do these Executive Actions on tariffs mean for Congress? Republicans are likely to lose their majorities in the midterm elections unless immediate pro-growth action is taken,” McIntosh wrote. “That’s why it is so important now for Republicans on Capitol Hill to extend and expand Trump’s 2017 tax cuts and cut federal spending to tame core inflation.”",

        "title": "Not even wealth is saving Americans from dying at rates seen among some of the poorest Europeans",
        "source": "https://www.nbcnews.com/",
        "content": "Fifty years ago, life expectancy in the U.S. and wealthy European countries was relatively similar.\n\nThat began to change around 1980. As European life expectancy steadily increased, the U.S. struggled to keep pace — and its life expectancy even began declining in 2014.\n\nToday, the wealthiest middle-aged and older adults in the U.S. have roughly the same likelihood of dying over a 12-year period as the poorest adults in northern and western Europe, according to a study published Wednesday in The New England Journal of Medicine.\n\nSome medical and health policy experts say the trend is a sign of deep-seated issues not just within the U.S. health care system, but with the typical American lifestyle of overconsuming junk food, not getting enough exercise and facing loneliness or financial stress.\n\n“It’s really concerning because, to me, what it’s saying is that the set of stressors that are harming the health of Americans is very widespread, to the point where even being wealthy or rich, you’re not going to be able to escape them,” said Dr. Atheendar Venkataramani, an associate professor of health policy at the University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine, who reviewed the study but wasn’t involved in it.\n\nThe study looked at the relationship between wealth and mortality among nearly 74,000 adults from 2010 to 2022. More than 19,000 of the adults were in the U.S., and roughly 54,000 were spread across 16 countries in Europe. All were ages 50 to 85.\n\nThe researchers divided the participants into four groups based on their overall assets (not including their homes). In both Europe and the U.S., the group with the most assets — the wealthiest — had a 40% lower mortality rate than the poorest group.\n\nThe poorest people in the U.S. had the highest mortality rate of any group, which is consistent with previous research showing that health outcomes are worse in America.\n\n“We were expecting to find greater inequity in the U.S. But what was surprising was how the richest in the U.S. compared to the richest in Europe,” said Irene Papanicolas, the study’s lead author, who directs the Center for Health System Sustainability at Brown University’s School of Public Health.\n\nThe wealthiest group in northern and western Europe had mortality rates about 35% lower than the wealthiest group in the U.S., she said.\n\nVenkataramani said the findings can’t be generalized to the entire U.S. population, but he added that he “would not be surprised if these patterns held up in other age groups.”\n\nPoor health outcomes in the U.S. are often attributed, in part, to a lack of access to affordable health care, which can result in high out-of-pocket costs for medication or procedures — or in some cases, not seeing a doctor at all.\n\nHowever, several experts said social and economic factors — such as loneliness or stress — are more likely to affect mortality rates in wealthier adults.\n\n“It’s hard to pin what’s happening on health care access,” Venkataramani said. “Certainly health care must have something to do with it, but it cannot be even a dominant part of the story if we’re seeing wealthier Americans having similar or worse outcomes than poor individuals in other wealthy countries.”\n\nIn addition to universal health care, many European countries offer free or heavily subsidized higher education and more comprehensive unemployment benefits compared with the U.S.\n\n“A lot of these countries have social welfare programs that don’t prevent people from losing their jobs or experiencing poverty, but when they go through those tough times, it doesn’t threaten their health,” said Dr. Steven Woolf, a professor of family medicine and population health at Virginia Commonwealth University School of Medicine.\n\nPeople in the U.S. also consume more ultra-processed foods and have higher rates of obesity compared with Europeans, which can increase their risk of diabetes or heart disease — an issue Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has pledged to address in office.\n\nKennedy has frequently pointed to the fact that Americans have worse health outcomes compared with peer countries.\n\n“Our lifespan has dropped. So Americans now live six years shorter than Europeans. We are the sickest nation in the world and we have the highest rate of chronic disease,” he said last week in a video post on X announcing layoffs of around 20,000 HHS employees.\n\nBut Woolf said the Trump administration’s recent gutting of federal health agencies and termination of research grants puts the U.S. on the wrong trajectory when it comes to lowering risk factors for mortality.\n\n“The thing that’s alarming us so much in the health and medicine world is that the policies that are now being pursued in a pretty muscular way are the opposite of what you would want to do to make America healthy again,” he said, referring to Kennedy’s agenda.\n\n“In all likelihood, my prediction will be that the gap in health between Americans and people in other countries is now going to widen even more dramatically,” Woolf said.\n\nAccording to HHS, the consolidation and cuts are meant to make the branch more efficient and work toward ending chronic disease. White House spokesman Kush Desai added that “the United States is by far the largest funder of scientific research and is home to the world’s largest ecosystem for innovation and research.”\n\n“The Trump administration spending its first two months to review the previous administration’s projects, identify waste, and realign our research spending to suit the priorities of the American people is not going to upend America’s innovative dominance,” Desai said.",

Metcalf family\n\nMetcalf said his son didn’t know the student who attacked him and that Austin’s twin brother, Hunter, was nearby when the confrontation took place and not only saw his brother get stabbed but tried to stop the bleeding.\n\n“They were twins, identical twins, and his brother was holding on to him, trying to make it stop bleeding, and he died in his brother’s arms,” Metcalf said. “I rushed up there and I saw him on the gurney and I could tell — they said he wasn’t breathing. I could see all the blood, and I saw where the wound was, and I was very concerned, so I had to find his brother, and we rushed to the hospital. And we prayed, and it’s God’s plan, I don’t understand it, but they weren’t able to save him. This is murder.”\n\nMetcalf said his son was had a 4.0 GPA, was MVP of the football team and had a bright future that included going to college.\n\n“He was on the right track,” Metcalf said. “He was loved by many. He was a leader.”\n\nJeff Metcalf talked with NBC Dallas Fort Worth about the loss of his 16-year-old son. NBC Dallas Fort Worth\n\n“I’m not trying to judge, but what kind of parents did this child have? What was he taught? He brought a knife to a track meet and he murdered my son by stabbing him in the heart. The guy was in the wrong place and they asked him to move and he bowed up. This is murder,” Metcalf said.\n\n“You know what, I already forgive this person,\" he added. \"Already. God takes care of things. God is going to take care of me. God is going to take care of my family.”\n\nFrisco police said they arrested and charged a 17-year-old with Metcalf’s murder. Police said the suspect's bond has not yet been set and it’s unclear if he’s obtained an attorney to speak on his behalf.\n\n“The Frisco Police Department grieves with all those affected by this devastating loss and extends its deepest condolences to the victim’s family, students, and staff who are experiencing unimaginable pain,” the department said Wednesday afternoon. “The department is collaborating with the Frisco Independent School District and will continue to provide any support they need during this incredibly difficult time.”\n\nPolice did not say where the stabbing took place at the stadium, but several police officers were seen investigating an area in the stands not far from the track.\n\nA spokesperson for the Frisco ISD said the 11-5A championship district track meet, which included more than 100 students from eight schools, took place at the stadium Wednesday morning. The district said that moments after the stabbing, the stadium was immediately secured, the meet was suspended and all students were returned to their home campuses “with expediency.”\n\nNo other injuries were reported.\n\nFrisco police said the investigation is ongoing.",

        "source": "https://www.nbcnews.com/",
        "content": "Retailers and brands have turned to Vietnam to manufacture goods from sneakers to couches while moving some or all production out of China.\n\nFor years, China’s southern neighbor became a popular alternative for companies trying to avoid the crossfire of U.S. trade tensions with Beijing. Now, as President Donald Trump expands his tariff targets, they can no longer steer clear.\n\nTrump said he will put a 46% duty on imports from Vietnam as part of a new wave of global levies announced Wednesday. That could soon raise costs for major corporations in the apparel, furniture and toy space, and some of them may pass those increases to consumers in the form of price hikes. The tariffs on Vietnam take effect on April 9.\n\nChina exported more goods to the U.S. than any other country for more than two decades, but Mexico surpassed China as the top source in 2023. China is now the second largest supplier to the U.S., accounting for $438.9 billion worth of goods in 2024, according to government data from the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative.\n\nFor companies that have looked to diversify the countries they rely on for production and reduce risks from trade conflicts with China, Vietnam has also become a popular place to go. Imports from Vietnam grew to $136.6 billion in 2024, up about 19% from 2023, according to the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative.\n\nOn the other hand, imports from China rose only 2.8% from 2023 to 2024, according to government data. Imports from China dropped about 18% last year when compared to 2022, when the U.S. brought in $536.3 billion in goods from the country.\n\nThe duties will hit companies at a time when many consumers have become value-conscious and selective about spending due to persistent inflation and concerns about the economy. While it is unclear now which companies will raise prices due to the tariffs, businesses may be reluctant to shoulder the higher costs as they forecast lackluster spending in the months ahead.\n\nThe companies most vulnerable to Vietnam tariffs\n\nSome household names will feel the pinch from Vietnam tariffs. Nike manufacturers about half of its footwear in China and Vietnam, with about 25% coming from Vietnam. Trump will put a 34% tariff on top of existing 20% duties on imports from China, for an apparent rate of 54%, a White House official told CNBC.\n\nThe tariffs would be yet another headwind for the sneaker and athletic apparel giant, which already delivered a disappointing forecast for the current quarter. That guidance, which projects a double-digit percentage sales decline in the three-month period, included the estimated impact from tariffs on imports from China and Mexico.\n\nExpanded tariffs could stall or slow Nike’s efforts to revive its brand and improve sales under its new CEO Elliott Hill, a company veteran who took the helm last fall.\n\nNike shares dropped more than 6% in extended trading Wednesday. Adidas and other major footwear players also rely heavily on Vietnam.\n\nThe two companies did not immediately respond to CNBC’s request for comment.\n\nNearly a third of footwear imports in the U.S. came from Vietnam in 2023, the most recent full-year data available, according to the Footwear Distributors and Retailers of America, an industry trade group.\n\nSteve Madden, for example, said on an earnings call in early November that it would slash its imports to the U.S. from China by as much as 45% over the next year. The footwear maker made that announcement just days after Trump’s presidential victory, following his campaign trail promises to impose steep tariffs on countries like China.\n\nYet one of the nations Steve Madden has accelerated its move to is Vietnam, along with Cambodia, Mexico and Brazil, CEO Edward Rosenfeld said at the time on the earnings call.\n\nVietnam was the second largest country for suppliers of Ugg and Hoka parent company Deckers Brands as of this month. The company has 68 supply chain partners in Vietnam, which is surpassed only by its 125 suppliers in China. Deckers shares dropped nearly 9% in extended trading. The company did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nVF Corporation, which is made up of footwear, apparel and accessories brands including The North Face, Timberland, Vans and Jansport, has a heavy reliance on China and Vietnam, too. About 38% of its suppliers are in China and 17% are in Vietnam, adding up to 55% of exposure across the two countries, according to a manufacturing disclosure from December.\n\nThe company’s shares dropped more than 8% in extended trading Wednesday. VF declined to comment, citing its quiet period before its upcoming earnings report.\n\nThe furniture industry has also ramped up its reliance on Vietnam.\n\nIn 2023, 26.5% of U.S. furniture imports came from the country, close behind the 29% coming from China, according to data from the Home Furnishings Association, a trade group that lobbies on behalf of home goods retailers. The group cited investment banking firm Mann, Armistead & Epperson — one of the furniture industry’s top sources for data.\n\nTaken together, that means about 56% of U.S. furniture imports come from both regions combined.\n\nOn an earnings call in February, Wayfair CEO Niraj Shah said the shift to countries outside of China has been “a growing trend” since Trump enacted tariffs during his first administration.\n\nHe said places like Cambodia, Indonesia, Thailand, the Philippines and Vietnam “have grown as places where folks have factories and where our goods are coming from.”\n\nWayfair’s stock plunged about 12% in extended trading. In a statement, Wayfair said it is “closely monitoring the evolving trade landscape.” The company added it is “well-positioned to continue offering customers the best possible combination of value, assortment, and experience.”\n\nToymakers have also leaned on Vietnam to make more merchandise that’s imported and sold to kids and adults across the U.S. Hasbro, SpinMaster, Mattel and Crayola are among the companies that work with GFT Group, one of the largest toy manufacturers in the Southeast Asia.\n\nIn addition to long-established manufacturing facilities in China, GFT currently has five production facilities in northern Vietnam that employ over 15,000 workers.\n\nOn a call in early March, Funko Chief Financial Officer Yves LePendeven said the company, which is known for its big-eyed plastic collectibles called Pops, was working hard to control what it could in the year ahead. That includes trying to offset tariffs by “renegotiating factory costs, accelerating our shift in production to other sourcing countries, and implementing pricing adjustments,” he said.\n\nOn the call, he said about a third of Funko’s global product purchases come from China. He didn’t name the countries that Funko was moving production to, but it is a customer of GFT Group.\n\nThose toymakers did not immediately respond to CNBC’s requests for comment.\n\nCurtis McGill is the co-founder of Hey Buddy Hey Pal, a toy company that specializes in Easter egg decorating kits. He said he expects the 46% tariffs to raise toy costs in the U.S., but added companies will likely be negotiating with suppliers in Vietnam to try to mitigate those hikes.\n\n“A lot of manufacturers and the actual toy companies have been already having conversations with manufacturing plants having to to help in some regards, because the toy companies are getting pressure to try and maintain prices on this side from the retailers,” McGill said.\n\nWhere do manufacturers go next?\n\nFor companies, including apparel makers, the new tariff policies have raised questions about whether — and where — to potentially move their manufacturing. Last month, an investor asked American Eagle Outfitters about its exposure to Vietnam on its most recent earnings call.\n\nChief Financial Officer Michael Mathias said the jeans and apparel brand’s production is similar in Vietnam and China, with “high-teens to 20%” of production in each of those countries. He said the company aims to trim that back to single-digits by the back half of the year.\n\nAmerican Eagle shares dipped more than 5% on Wednesday. The company did not immediately respond to CNBC’s request for comment.\n\nYet both Mathias and American Eagle CEO Jay Schottenstein said on the company’s last earnings call that it will be crucial to stay flexible, while waiting to see how tariffs would play out and which countries would be targeted.\n\nSchottenstein referred to eight years ago during the first Trump administration, when American Eagle also faced challenges and had to figure out a new plan.\n\nSchottenstein said there’s another shift coming, but “nobody knows what the story is yet.”\n\n“I wouldn’t be rushing,” he said. “You go rush, where am I rushing to? I don’t know where I’m rushing to.”\n\nPeter Baum is the chief financial officer and chief operation officer of Baum Essex, a New York-based manufacturer with licenses to make products for brands like Nautica, Betsey Johnson and Steve Madden. During the first Trump administration in 2019, Baum moved factories from from China to the Philippines, Cambodia, Vietnam and India.\n\nHe told CNBC on Wednesday that the reciprocal tariffs would do massive damage to his company.\n\n“This is how you start a global depression. After 80 years and five generations Trump just put us out of business,” Baum said.\n\n— CNBC’s Sarah Whitten, Jason Gewirtz and Eamon Javers contributed to this report.",

        "content": "A manager at a Philadelphia-area Planet Fitness allegedly refused to allow good Samaritans to use the gym’s defibrillator on a man who suffered a heart attack outside, a lawsuit says.\n\nGuy Harris, 46, died Jan. 22 after going into cardiac arrest near a Planet Fitness in Clifton Heights, Pennsylvania, according to the wrongful death suit filed by his wife Wednesday in the Philadelphia Court of Common Pleas.\n\nA married father of two, Harris had been driving his 11-year-old son to get a snack after school when he started experiencing symptoms of a heart attack, prompting him to pull over, the legal complaint said. He parked a short distance from the entrance to the Planet Fitness, where he was a member, it said.\n\nGuy Harris. Courtesy Taniqua Morene-Harris\n\nHarris’ son got out of the car, called 911 and pleaded for help from passersby, said the lawsuit, which was first reported by NBC News. The legal filing said that one bystander who worked in the medical field began CPR on Harris, while another told customers exiting Planet Fitness to go back inside to ask for the gym’s automated external defibrillator, or AED — a portable device that delivers an electric shock to try to restore a person’s heartbeat.\n\n“Two Planet Fitness patrons returned to the club and requested the AED, indicating that a man was dying outside,” the lawsuit read. “Despite knowing about the life-or-death situation unfolding, the Planet Fitness club manager refused.”\n\nThe lawsuit names Planet Fitness Inc., which is headquartered in New Hampshire, and Keystone NFP Clifton LLC, the franchisee operator in Clifton Heights, as defendants. Neither immediately responded to NBC News’ requests for comment.\n\nHarris’ wife, Taniqua Morene-Harris, declined to comment. An attorney for her said that the couple had been married for nearly 21 years and that Harris died the day before their son turned 12.\n\n“They’re all just shocked by this whole occurrence and how it happened,” said Elizabeth Crawford, a partner at the Philadelphia-based law firm Kline & Specter, PC. “AEDs save lives — but only if they’re used.”\n\nIt’s not clear from the lawsuit why the Planet Fitness manager, who is not identified or named as a defendant, allegedly refused to allow the use of the AED. The suit said bystanders continued to try to resuscitate Harris using CPR, but he was pronounced dead later that day after an ambulance rushed him to the hospital.\n\nThe lawsuit accuses Planet Fitness and its franchisee operator of negligence that led to Harris’ “extreme pain and suffering and untimely death.” It seeks a jury trial and unspecified damages.\n\nPlanet Fitness has more than 2,700 clubs throughout the world, its website says.\n\nCrawford called what happened at the Clifton Heights location a “deliberate decision to withhold life-saving measures.” She said the fact that Harris’ cardiac event happened outside the gym was no excuse for denying access to an AED.\n\n“It’s reasonable to assume that someone could have a heart attack outside the facility just as much as they could have it in the facility,” she said.",

        "source": "https://www.nbcnews.com/",
        "content": "Amazon has made a late bid to purchase TikTok, a person familiar with the ongoing White House-led discussions to identify a non-Chinese buyer for the social media app told NBC News.\n\nThe bid, first reported by The New York Times, arrived this week, via a letter to Vice President JD Vance and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick. Given the last-minute timing, days before a Saturday deadline to stave off a ban of the app in the U.S., the bid is not being treated as serious, said the source, who was granted anonymity to share details of private negotiations.\n\nA spokesperson for Amazon declined to comment. A representative for Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nPresident Donald Trump was expected to weigh TikTok offers Wednesday during an Oval Office meeting with Vance, Lutnick and other high-ranking administration officials. Trump has tapped Vance and national security adviser Michael Waltz to lead the effort to resolve TikTok’s fate.\n\n“If and when there is an announcement on TikTok, it will come from President Trump,” a White House official said Wednesday.\n\nThe app has been in limbo in the U.S. since last year, when then-President Joe Biden signed bipartisan legislation that forced its Chinese-based owner, ByteDance, to sell it to a non-Chinese buyer or face a nationwide ban. No such deal came to fruition, and Trump extended the deadline through an executive order he signed on his first day in office, effectively giving TikTok until Saturday, April 5, to find a solution that would keep it online.\n\nByteDance, which has said it did not plan to sell, still has not publicly confirmed talks with any buyers or officially stated that it is willing to sell TikTok.\n\nWhite House officials and Vance aides have kept a close hold on details of the TikTok talks, with the full slate of potential buyers or partners remaining a mystery. And despite Wednesday’s scheduled meeting, there was no sign of an imminent deal. Trump, for his part, has expressed a willingness to extend the deadline again if an agreement is not reached by Saturday.\n\nThat’s an outcome Vance has said he would like to avoid. But the vice president acknowledged in an interview with NBC News last month that while the broad contours of a TikTok deal could be in place by the deadline, the finer points might take longer to reconcile.\n\n“Typically, some of these deals that are much smaller and involve much less capital take months to close,” Vance, who worked in venture capital before entering politics as a U.S. senator from Ohio, said at the time. “We’re trying to close this thing by early April. I think that the outlines of this thing will be very clear. The question is whether we can get all the paper done.”\n\nBipartisan efforts to ban the app date back to Trump's first presidential term, during which he tried unsuccessfully to ban TikTok. Since then, the president has shifted his stance. While running for a nonconsecutive second term last year, Trump shared a viral video on the platform in which he said he was going to \"save TikTok.\"\n\nTikTok had challenged the potential ban, but the Supreme Court upheld it in the final days of the Biden administration. The app briefly went dark in the U.S. just before Trump’s inauguration, but restored service after the president signaled he would review the ban.\n\nEarlier this week, Trump appeared confident that there would be a deal.\n\n\"We have a lot of potential buyers,\" he told reporters. \"There's tremendous interest in TikTok. The decision is going to be my decision. TikTok is, it's very interesting, and a lot of people want to buy it.\"\n\nSuitors that have expressed interest in acquiring the app include the likes of Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian, who joined billionaire investor Frank McCourt’s bid; artificial intelligence search engine startup Perplexity AI; and Steven Mnuchin, treasury secretary in the first Trump administration.",

The New York Times Magazine wrote in 2020, “His casting problem was solved for him when no one wanted to work with him anymore.”\n\nThe actor — who took part in the Method branch of Suzuki arts training — threw himself into parts. When he played Doc Holliday in “Tombstone,” he filled his bed with ice for the final scene to mimic the feeling of dying from tuberculosis. To play Morrison, he wore leather pants all the time, asked castmates and crew to only refer to him as Jim Morrison, and blasted The Doors for a year.\n\nThat intensity also gave Kilmer a reputation that he was difficult to work with, something he grudgingly agreed with later in life.\n\n“I had been deemed difficult and alienated the head of every major studio,” he wrote in his memoir, according to The New York Times Magazine.\n\nKilmer also wrote that while he famously had relationships with supermodel Cindy Crawford and actor Angelina Jolie, he was heartbroken after splitting with Daryl Hannah.\n\n“I know I would love her with my whole heart forever and that love has lost none of its strength. I am still in love with Daryl,” he wrote in the memoir, released 19 years after the pair briefly dated in 2001.\n\nKilmer also dated Cher, who he wrote cared for him after the throat cancer and treatment.",

        "content": "The wife of a recently retired Green Beret who disappeared in late January is accused of killing and dismembering him after he told her he wanted a divorce, authorities in North Carolina said.\n\nShana Cloud, 50, was denied bond Monday after she was charged with first-degree murder and concealment of death in the killing of Clinton Bonnell, 50, court records show.\n\nBonnell’s remains were discovered in a body of water in a rural area southeast of Fayetteville in February, the Cumberland County Sheriff’s Office said in a statement. DNA testing confirmed the remains were those of Bonnell last week, according to the statement.\n\nClint Bonnell.

        "source": "https://www.nbcnews.com/",
        "content": "Carey Stewart Cezar, a retired nurse who lives in Baltimore, watched with dismay Wednesday as President Donald Trump announced sweeping tariffs on imports.\n\nCezar voted for Vice President Kamala Harris in last year’s presidential election and opposes Trump’s economic policies. But she said she has another reason to be skeptical of Trump’s tariffs: She is a descendant of one of the legislators behind the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930, a law that many economic historians believe worsened the Great Depression.\n\n“I think it’s a terrible idea and potentially devastating,” Cezar, 70, said in a phone interview Wednesday, a few hours after Trump announced plans to impose duties on goods brought into the United States from other countries. “I think people don’t remember all the harm caused by tariffs in our history.”\n\nCarey Cezar — holding a photo of her mother as a baby alongside Rep. Willis C. Hawley — kept various news clippings about her great-grandfather. Courtesy Carey Cezar\n\nCezar’s great-grandfather was Rep. Willis C. Hawley, an Oregon Republican who sponsored the 1930 tariff act with Sen. Reed Smoot, a Utah Republican. The act, which President Herbert Hoover signed into law roughly a year into the Great Depression, increased duties, set off a trade war and — in the eyes of many historians — aggravated the effects of the era’s economic downturn.\n\nThe law was “one of the most controversial tariff acts ever enacted by Congress,” Doug Irwin, an economics professor at Dartmouth College, wrote in 2020. (Irwin said Wednesday on X that Trump’s expansive tariffs are “bigger than Smoot-Hawley.”)\n\nThe law re-entered public consciousness with the 1986 release of “Ferris Bueller’s Day Off,” featuring actor Ben Stein as a dry high school teacher who tells his students the act was a failure.\n\nCezar, whose great-grandfather died in 1941, said the law was part of her early education, too. “The Smoot-Hawley Act is part of my family’s history, and I learned about it as a kid,” she said.\n\nShe recalled that her mother was “deeply embarrassed” by the last name Hawley when she was growing up in Baltimore in the wake of the Great Depression. She was ashamed of being linked with a law that had intensified economic devastation, Cezar said.\n\n“She was happy to get a new name when she got married,” Cezar added.\n\nCezar has kept some family mementos from that dark historical chapter, including ration tickets for food and basic goods such as shoes.\n\nIn recent weeks, as Wall Street reeled from uncertainty over Trump’s tariff plans, Cezar watched her financial holdings tumble. She said her 401(k) retirement account lost around 10% of its value. She said she does not believe the nation is entering a new “golden age,” as Trump proclaimed Wednesday.\n\nTrump’s tariffs regime is an effort to change trade arrangements under which the United States outsourced manufacturing to foreign countries in return for cheaper goods, a status quo that critics say has harmed America’s industrial core.\n\nTrump, who has long argued that the United States gets “ripped off” by other countries, said Wednesday that the nation has been “looted, pillaged, raped and plundered.” He vowed that American industry would be “reborn.”\n\nU.S. stock markets reversed post-election gains as Trump delivered his remarks. In after-hours trading, S&P 500 futures dropped 1.5%.\n\nDays after the presidential election, amid speculation about Trump’s economic agenda, Cezar posted a comment on Facebook that implored other users to “learn about what tariffs do to the economy.”\n\n“I asked people to just take a minute and study their history,” she said.\n\nNobody replied.",

        "title": "Widespread job cuts begin at health agencies",
        "source": "https://www.nbcnews.com/",
        "content": "The Trump administration carried out mass layoffs across the Department of Health and Human Services on Tuesday, aiming to slash around 10,000 full-time jobs from the federal agencies long tasked with regulating food and drugs and overseeing the nation’s public health policies.\n\nElon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency is trying to reduce HHS’ workforce from 82,000 to 62,000 across several agencies, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Food and Drug Administration and the National Institutes of Health.\n\nThe drastic job eliminations are part of HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s wider plan to reshape the federal public health infrastructure and dismantle traditional institutions. Kennedy repeatedly promised to hollow out the CDC and the NIH during his failed presidential bid last year.\n\nThe administration made deep and wide-ranging cuts to divisions responsible for tackling HIV, improving minority health and preventing injury, such as gun violence. Jobs were eliminated at offices overseeing the approval of new drugs, providing health insurance and responding to infectious disease outbreaks.\n\nA number of lesser-known divisions — including several focused on the safety of mining workers — were cut entirely.\n\nMany current and former staffers spoke to NBC News on the condition of anonymity because they weren’t authorized to speak to the media.\n\n“It’s a terrible dark day,” a CDC staffer said.\n\nOn Tuesday afternoon, as the scale of the cuts became clear, Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., the chair of the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, and Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., the ranking member, called Kennedy to testify before the committee to discuss his “proposed reorganization of the Department of Health and Human Services.”\n\nCassidy and Sanders' letter notes that Kennedy made a commitment during his confirmation process that he would testify before the HELP committee each quarter.\n\nThe CDC’s Freedom of Information Act Office, which allows the public to request access to information, has also been eliminated, according to two CDC officials. As of Tuesday afternoon, its FOIA webpage displayed an error message stating, “This page isn’t working right now.”\n\nIn a statement, a spokesperson said HHS is investigating the website outage.\n\nEliminating the office doesn't mean the agency can ignore FOIA requests.\n\n“They need someone to handle FOIA requests; they can’t stop answering FOIA requests,” said Dorit Reiss, a professor of law at UC Law San Francisco. But, she added, FOIA “doesn’t have to have its own office.”\n\nIn a speech in February introducing himself to HHS staff members, Kennedy invoked FOIA as he underscored his commitment to what he called “radical transparency.”\n\n“We will make our data and our policy process so transparent that people won’t even have to file a FOIA request,” Kennedy said.\n\nCommunications offices were gutted, too: The entire team at the FDA’s office of media affairs was axed, according to sources familiar with the matter. Most of the communications team of the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research — about 50 people — was also cut, a senior staffer said.\n\nThat office’s work included managing public databases on drug approvals, such as information about potential risks of FDA-approved drugs and labeling, which are required by law to be published. The office was also responsible for managing the drug shortages database.\n\n“These cuts to agency experts and programs leave our country less safe, less prepared and without the necessary talent and resources to respond to health threats,” said Dr. Mandy Cohen, who was CDC director in the Biden administration.\n\nChaos and anxiety\n\nThe layoff notices, which started going out late Monday and continued into Tuesday morning, ended days of anxiety for many employees, some of whom said they spent the weekend wracked with worry about whether they still had jobs. (The notices didn’t go out Friday as originally planned so “all the data could be triple-checked over the weekend,” a source familiar with the matter said.)\n\nOn Monday, employees had been encouraged to take their laptops home each evening, according to a memo obtained by NBC News, in case they were terminated overnight and lost access to the campus facilities. (They would still be expected to work remotely, the memo added.)\n\nAt the FDA, some employees who hadn’t realized they’d been let go were refused entry onto campus by security Tuesday morning, a source said. Outside the HHS building in Rockville, Maryland, employees were being turned away and could be seen crying in the street, according to an employee at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease.\n\nOne employee said the performance scores — given annually by supervisors to rate employees overall performance — cited in their termination notices were incorrect or inaccurate.\n\nProtesters rally against DOGE cuts Saturday in New York City. Michael M. Santiago / Getty Images\n\nA senior CDC official said certain directors were offered transfers to the Indian Health Service and possibly remote work locations as a way to force them to leave — potentially because those postings would require them to uproot their lives and move far away.\n\n“I don’t think the intent is benevolent,” said the official, who had direct knowledge of the reassignments.\n\nThe list of center directors reassigned to the Indian Health Service, which provides medical care for American Indians and Alaska Natives, included the heads of the National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion; the National Center for HIV, Viral Hepatitis, STD, and TB Prevention; and the Global Health Center, according to CDC officials.\n\nIn total, HHS said it’s seeking to eliminate about 2,400 full-time jobs at the CDC, 3,500 jobs at the FDA, 1,200 at the NIH and 300 at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.\n\nAround 80 people from the Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response were cut — including people at the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority and the Strategic National Stockpile. The strategic preparedness agency will be folded into the CDC.\n\nFederal health officials have said the responsibilities of some departments that are eliminated or downsized may be shifted over to a new entity, the Administration for Healthy America.\n\nAmong the agencies set to be folded into the Administration for Healthy America include the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration and the Health Resources and Services Administration, which includes a program focused on HIV treatment.\n\nAndrew Nixon, a spokesperson at HHS, has said the cuts will affect neither Medicare or Medicaid services nor the FDA’s review of drugs, medical devices and foods.\n\nNixon said last week that the agency planned no additional job cuts.\n\nPublic health advocates and some Democratic lawmakers have sharply criticized the sweeping cuts, saying they could jeopardize public health efforts.\n\nOn Monday, Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., former chair of a Senate health committee that oversees the agency, along with Sen. Tammy Baldwin, D-Wis., and Rep. Rosa DeLauro, D-Conn., sent a letter to Kennedy demanding answers about his plans to “gut” staff and reorganize HHS.\n\n“Authoritatively stating that these drastic changes will improve the health of Americans without any explanation insults the American public and defies logic,” they wrote. “If these actions were actually intended to improve the Department’s ability to carry out its mission to enhance the health and well-being of all Americans, you and the Department should be eager to provide additional detail and justification for them.”",

        "title": "Steve Kornacki: How Democratic voter intensity powered Susan Crawford to a win in Wisconsin",
        "source": "https://www.nbcnews.com/",
        "content": "Democratic-aligned Susan Crawford’s decisive victory in Wisconsin’s Supreme Court election is proof that the political engagement of the “resistance” remains sky-high in Donald Trump’s second term. And it simply overwhelms Republicans in a lower-wattage contest like this.\n\nCrawford’s 10-point win over Republican-backed Brad Schimel is a landslide compared with the last three presidential races in Wisconsin, all of which were decided by less than 1 point. The mismatch in intensity between the two parties is the reason why.\n\nTurnout for Tuesday’s court race stands at just more than 2.3 million. That’s a massive figure for an early spring, off-year race, but it’s still a far cry from the more than 3.4 million who voted in the 2024 presidential race in Wisconsin. And that falloff came disproportionately from the pro-Trump side.\n\nThe “resistance” enthusiasm comes from a particular segment of the Democratic base: voters with college degrees, higher incomes and vehemently anti-Trump views. They are predominantly, but not exclusively, white and are most concentrated in metro areas and college towns. They are plugged into heavily political, progressive-flavored media and have come to serve as a limitless source of online-fueled fundraising for Democratic candidates. And they are extremely motivated to vote, no matter the office, seemingly viewing any and every election as an opportunity to oppose the Trump-led GOP.\n\nNo other place in Wisconsin embodies these demographics like Dane County; for that matter, few places in America do. Home to the state capital and the University of Wisconsin-Madison, Dane is almost 80% white, and it is the most highly educated county in the state. In the county, 56% of the white adult population has at least a bachelor’s degree, and more than a fifth of all adults have advanced degrees. It’s far more affluent than most of the state. All of this has led to it becoming a vote bank for Democrats.\n\nIn Tuesday’s election, Crawford won Dane by 64 points, and voter turnout in the county was 78% of what it was in November. And the voters who turned out were, somehow, even more Democratic-friendly than in November: Crawford’s vote share in Dane was 8 points higher than that of former Vice President Kamala Harris. In other words, Wisconsin’s biggest blue bastion got even bluer.\n\nCompare this to the other end of the political spectrum. The political base that powered Trump to victory in the Badger State couldn’t be more demographically opposite. Trump drew overwhelming support from white voters without college degrees who are found primarily in exurban, small-town and rural Wisconsin. In 2024, Trump also folded in new support from nonwhite voters, many of them younger, male and first-time participants, who are more clustered in and around Milwaukee.\n\nOn Tuesday, there was significant slack in this coalition. Two places tell the story.\n\nFirst, there’s the so-called “Driftless Area,” a mostly rural and small-town swath of counties along and inland from the Mississippi River. It was here in particular that Trump struck gold with blue-collar white voters when he first ran in 2016, and in 2024 he carried the area again by double digits. But in Tuesday’s election, there was far more drop-off in the Driftless Area than in Dane, with turnout running at 67% of November’s level. Tellingly, Crawford actually won the Driftless Area by 6 points, testament to just how disproportionate that drop-off was.\n\nThen there’s the Milwaukee area, where much of the state’s relatively small nonwhite population resides. Trump held Harris to a 44-point margin in Milwaukee’s majority Hispanic precincts last year, an impressive achievement for a Republican compared to the past. But in those same precincts Tuesday, turnout plummeted to just 49% of November’s level and the Democratic margin expanded back to 66 points.\n\nThis is all an inversion from the not-so-distant past, when the Republican coalition tilted toward the suburbs and was seen as more politically engaged. Back then, it was Democrats who had to contend more with the challenge of motivating infrequent voters for elections like this. Now, it’s a problem for the Trump side.\n\nThe president has assembled a unique coalition that, when fully activated, can win the popular vote in a national election. The question for the next two years is whether Republicans can rely on that coalition in an election that doesn’t feature Trump’s name on the ballot.",

        "source": "https://www.nbcnews.com/",
        "content": "A University of Mississippi student who was the subject of an internet rumor is navigating the fallout after she says the lie, which was amplified by people including popular ESPN host and analyst Pat McAfee, “ruined” her life. Mary Kate Cornett, 19, told NBC News on Wednesday that she and her family have faced a barrage of harassment and insults in the weeks since a false rumor about her and her boyfriend’s father went viral online.\n\n“Having your life ruined by people who have no idea who you are is the worst feeling in the world,” Cornett said, while tearing up. “It makes you feel so alone. It’s a horrible experience.”\n\nThe rumor involving Cornett, whose experience was detailed in a profile published by The Athletic earlier this week, was referenced on “The Pat McAfee Show” by the host, a former NFL player, and his guests as they discussed an alleged “ménage à trois” at Ole Miss. Cornett and her boyfriend were not mentioned by name in the ESPN show.\n\nIn the episode, which aired on Feb. 26, McAfee says an “Ole Miss frat bro” allegedly “had a K-D (Kappa Delta) girlfriend.”\n\n“At this exact moment, this is what is being reported by … everybody on the internet: Dad had sex with son’s girlfriend,” he says, later adding, “And then it was made public … that’s the absolute worst-case situation.”\n\nThe conversation steered back toward college football after almost two and a half minutes. McAfee shared a clip about the discussion online to his 3.2 million X followers. The post, which is captioned “What’s going on at Ole Miss” with two laughing crying face emojis, was still on the social media platform as of Wednesday and had been viewed 1.8 million times.\n\nThe circulation of the rumor was enough, Cornett said, to further derail her life.\n\nESPN and McAfee declined to comment.\n\nWhile the internet has propelled unknown people into stardom overnight, Cornett’s experience has underscored the more toxic nature of virality.\n\nCornett said her friends first told her about a rumor that was spreading on YikYak, an anonymous messaging-based app used by some college students, about a college student at her university and in her sorority who was sleeping with her boyfriend’s father.\n\nWithin an hour and a half of the rumor spreading, Cornett said she already started noticing people staring at her on campus. Eventually, she saw that her name was a top trending topic on X, with “hundreds and hundreds” of posts falsely identifying her as the person at the center of the rumor.\n\nMary Kate Cornett. Ignacio Torres / NBC News\n\nShe said that she, her boyfriend and his father were shocked.\n\n“It was so insane. It all happened so fast,” she said. “I was just in shambles. I just felt so helpless and so alone because so many people were hating on me for something that I had no idea anything about.”\n\nAfter McAfee’s show, others, including two personalities affiliated with Barstool Sports, referenced the rumor online. KFC Barstool posted a video about the incident to his personal account that was later deleted, according to The Athletic. Jack Mac’s post, which was still on X as of Wednesday, promotes a meme coin that contains Cornett’s name.\n\nA representative for Barstool Sports did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nDave Portnoy, the owner of Barstool Sports, denied his website’s involvement in spreading the rumor in a statement to other media outlets.\n\n“Barstool Sports did not mention or spread this rumor on any of our Barstool owned channels,” he said in a statement to Rolling Stone. “Our editors instinctively made the decision to avoid this story as it seemed there was a high likelihood it could have been fabricated.”\n\nIn his statement to the publication, he said he’s aware that one of the company’s “employees posted something on their personal socials but we don’t control those.”\n\nMonica Uddin, Cornett’s attorney, said she believes what happened to her client is cyberbullying and grounds for a defamation case.\n\n“Defamation has existed for a long time. You can’t lie about someone with impunity — and that’s what has happened to Mary Kate,” she said. “You can’t lie for money.”\n\n“Not using her name is not a ‘Get Out of Jail Free’ card, saying ‘allegedly’ is not a ‘Get Out of Jail Free’ card,” the attorney said. “These people are responsible for what they have done to her.”\n\nI just felt so helpless and so alone because so many people were hating on me for something that I had no idea anything about. -Mary Kate Cornett, 19\n\nCornett said she intends to take legal action against McAfee and ESPN, and potentially others who, she said, helped spread the rumor.\n\nUddin said Cornett is prepared to be deposed to prove her case.\n\nSince the rumor began circulating, Cornett said nothing about her life has been the same.\n\n“This has affected me in such an awful way and has practically ruined my life,” Cornett said, adding that McAfee “never once reached out to ask me if this was true or for me to give any sort of statement to him.”\n\n“I thought it was absolutely ridiculous that an ESPN sports broadcaster would be talking about a 19-year-old girl’s ‘sex scandal’ that was completely false,” Cornett said.\n\nPolice showed up to Cornett’s mother’s home in Houston, she said, with guns drawn in what she described as an apparent “swatting” incident, which is the act of making a false report of extreme violence in order to elicit an overwhelming law enforcement response to someone’s home.\n\nNBC News has reviewed screenshots of security camera footage of the incident, provided by Cornett’s attorney, appearing to confirm the “swatting” occurred.\n\nNBC News has reached out to the Houston Police Department for comment.\n\nCornett said her number was shared online and that she was overwhelmed with “thousands” of calls and texts, with some telling her she “deserved to die.” She said she could barely leave her dorm room and had to switch to online classes.\n\nCornett denounced people who talked about her online, suggesting they did so for clout.\n\n“I want these famous people to know that I was not famous before this,” she said. “ ... I am a normal 19-year-old college freshman. That’s it. I was happy. I had a great friend group.”\n\n“I’m not a public figure that you can go talk about on your show to get more views,” she added.\n\nJustin Cornett, Cornett’s dad, said that as a parent he was “worried” that his daughter “wouldn’t recover.”\n\n“You just want to protect them,” he said. “She’s a beautiful person. She has a tender heart and a kind soul.”\n\nNow, he said he “wants justice.”\n\n“The people that did this to her and her boyfriend and his dad deserve what they have coming to them,” he said.\n\nWhen asked what he would say to McAfee, Justin Cornett said, “When you have a microphone and you have a platform, you have a responsibility to take on that role with the respect of the people you report on being paramount. If this were to happen to him, his daughter, his wife, someone he loves, he sure wouldn’t like it. When you have a microphone, you have a responsibility and it needs to be taken seriously.”\n\nFor days after the rumor first flooded the internet, Cornett said she couldn’t sleep and would throw up after experiencing anxiety. She defended herself online, sharing an Instagram post the day after McAfee’s show aired.\n\n“First of all, this rumor is 100% completely false and it is quite frankly, inexcusable that such disturbing accusations went viral,” she wrote at the time, adding that “Cyber attacks based on nothing but lies and misinformation happen all too often.”\n\nShe issued a similar warning about the dangers of how false information can spread on social media during her interview with NBC News on Wednesday.\n\n“If this happened to me, this could happen to anyone,” she said. “And there’s nothing I could have done to prevent what happened to me.”",

Sherald is renowned for her portraits of former first lady Michelle Obama and Breonna Taylor, but she typically finds inspiration in the beauty of strangers and everyday life.\n\n\"Michelle LaVaughn Robinson Obama,\" by Amy Sherald, 2018.

Sherald said she met the two by chance, sensing something special in them.\n\n“I’m looking for soulmates,” Sherald said. “I really don’t know how to describe it. ... It’s energetic. I think they have kind of a weight to their soul, like they’ve been here before.”\n\nArtist Amy Sherald at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art on November 02, 2024 in Los Angeles, California. Matt Winkelmeyer / Getty Images\n\nSherald paints all her subjects’ skin in shades of gray to emphasize universality and shared experience while centering Black Americans in an artistic genre from which they were historically excluded. Her body of work is both an act of resistance against erasure and a celebration of joy and wonder.\n\nOne of the show’s standout pieces is the massive triptych “Ecclesia (The Meeting of Inheritance and Horizons),” featuring three distinct figures standing in watchtowers. It is inspired, in part, by a photo booth in the Wes Anderson film “Grand Budapest Hotel” and the stained-glass windows of Catholic churches.\n\n“This is just about contemplation,” she said. “Are they above water? Are they above land? Maybe these are guides waiting to call the ancestors back. I love the big question mark around this one,” she said.\n\n\"Planes, rockets, and the spaces in between,\" by Amy Sherald, 2018.

That’s by design.\n\nSherald’s works are positioned at eye level, lower than most museum exhibits, she said, in hope of creating a deep and lasting connection.",

        "title": "Trump announces sweeping tariffs on major trade partners — with some as high as 54%",
        "source": "https://www.nbcnews.com/",
        "content": "The announcement is an effort to impose sweeping changes on decades-old trading arrangements under which the United States increasingly outsourced some labor-intensive manufacturing to foreign countries in return for cheaper goods — at the cost, critics have said, of America’s industrial base.\n\nTrump argued that, instead, the United States has been getting “ripped off” by other nations while working-class wages have languished. In a call with reporters before the Rose Garden event, White House officials said the institutions that have governed world commerce “no longer fit the times.”\n\nBut far from providing an immediate jolt to the U.S. economy, the tariffs are expected to take a toll on many companies whose products rely on global supply chains and now could be forced to raise prices or endure thinner profit margins. The White House and its surrogates have tried to communicate a message of patience and endurance, warning of some pain ahead, but for a trade-off that will be worthwhile eventually.\n\nIt’s unclear how that will play with the American public, especially after Trump came into office with promises to stabilize or even lower prices following an inflation-heavy recovery under President Joe Biden after the vast economic disruptions of the pandemic.\n\nThough Trump was elected because of his perceived ability to jolt the economy, he also spent much of his campaign promising to impose tariffs.\n\nThe latter appears to be winning out — a reality that seems to have stunned economists, the business community and consumers, many of whom are his own voters.\n\n“When confronted with the argument that Trump was talking big on tariffs, putting them on everything, the response was ‘It’ll be the same as in 2016: He didn’t do it,’” Michael Strain, director of economic policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute, a pro-business think tank, told NBC News ahead of Wednesday’s announcement.\n\nInstead, Strain said, “what we’ve seen over the last two months is pretty light on traditional GOP policies and heavy on MAGA. Business leaders have been quite confused and disappointed with what’s happened so far.”\n\nTrump released a country-by-country list of the reciprocal tariffs. NBC News\n\nThe tariffs effort has come in fits and starts, with proposals and reversals happening in quick succession. About 24 hours before Wednesday’s announcement, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt acknowledged that Trump and his advisers were still “perfecting” the new policy.\n\nAs the Wednesday rollout bore down, countries continued to jockey to get ahead of the new duties. Vietnam and Israel indicated they would relax duties previously imposed on U.S. goods, while leaders in Europe were still holding out hope for negotiations.\n\nYet the mere threat of the tariffs has created massive uncertainty in the economy, causing stock markets to tank while throttling business and consumer confidence. The Federal Reserve pre-emptively shifted its inflation forecasts higher for this year and next on the assumption that firms will respond to the higher duties by raising costs — many of which are likely to be passed on to consumers in the form of higher prices for everything from avocados to lumber, cellphones, automobiles and more.\n\nAlthough Fed Chair Jerome Powell said there was a chance the inflationary impact from the duties could end up being “transitory,” recent surveys have suggested consumers believe the momentum of price increases may only accelerate.\n\nBusinesses and consumers are already saying they foresee worse economic outcomes as a result of the tariffs. In the University of Michigan’s latest consumer confidence survey, consumers’ long-run inflation expectations had the largest three-month increase on record and are now at a 32-year high.\n\nThe same survey found two-thirds of consumers expect unemployment to rise in the year ahead, the highest share since 2009.\n\n“This trend reveals a key vulnerability for consumers, given that strong labor markets and incomes have been the primary source of strength supporting consumer spending in recent years,” it said.\n\nBusinesses are already paying higher prices. An oil and gas industry executive told the Dallas Federal Reserve in a survey published last month that the administration’s tariff threats “immediately increased the cost of our casing and tubing by 25 percent,” while the administration’s desire to see oil prices fall to $50 a barrel “has caused our firm to reduce its 2025 and 2026 capital expenditures.”\n\n“‘Drill, baby, drill’ does not work with $50-per-barrel oil,” the person said.\n\nTrump has given a host of rationales for imposing the trade duties, from reviving American industry to raising revenues to halting the flow of fentanyl and undocumented people. Wednesday’s announcement is also a culmination of Trump’s long-running fixation with reversing America’s trade deficit; he has accused countries of “taking advantage of” the United States and “ripping us off.”\n\nEven before Wednesday, Trump was already claiming success, contending that private firms had committed to more investments in the United States in two months than in all four years of the Biden administration. While some businesses have indeed pledged to increase spending in the United States, analysts have raised doubts about the extent of concessions he has received from trading partners in response to the threat of higher duties or pointed out that many of the investment commitments he has touted were already in the works.\n\nFrom an economics standpoint, many experts say, Trump’s view of how trade works is outdated at best. It is true that inflation-adjusted median earnings experienced a multidecade period of relative stagnation starting at the end of the 1970s. And for men, median earnings have actually been flat for the past 45 years.\n\nBut over the past 10 years, they have steadily increased for both sexes. And while the United States does have a large trade deficit, it remains a manufacturing powerhouse whose exports have never been more valuable even after adjusting for inflation.\n\nThe Trump administration nevertheless appears fixated on an economic-nationalist worldview and is prepared to enact it, no matter the ultimate cost.\n\n“The average wage in the services sector is higher than in the manufacturing sector,” Strain said. “We should not want to reallocate a whole lot of workers from higher-paying into lower-paying jobs out of some misplaced nostalgia for some imagined past. We should not wish for American workers to be sewing tennis shoes together — they can have better jobs than that.”",

        "source": "https://www.nbcnews.com/",
        "content": "Lawyers for Erik and Lyle Menendez urged a judge to block an effort from Los Angeles’ top prosecutor to withdraw his office’s support for reducing the brothers’ sentences of life without the possibility of parole for the 1989 shotgun killings of their parents.\n\nThe reasons Los Angeles County District Attorney Nathan Hochman presented for the withdrawal are either “patently meritless” or were considered and rejected by Hochman’s predecessor, George Gascón, the brothers' lawyers argued in an 88-page filing.\n\nGascón, who was voted out of office in November, described the brothers as “exceptional” inmates and supported resentencing them to 50 years to life in prison, which would have made them eligible for parole immediately.\n\nLast month, Hochman said he had withdrawn from that recommendation because the brothers, now 54 and 57, had not fully acknowledged more than a dozen lies they told about the murders, including that they killed their parents in self-defense.\n\n“In looking at whether the Menendez brothers have exhibited full insight and complete responsibility for their crimes, they have not,” Hochman said last month.\n\nA judge will ultimately determine if the brothers should be resentenced.\n\nThe brothers have said they fatally shot their parents, Jose and Kitty Menendez, after Lyle confronted his father about alleged sex abuse and Jose Menendez appeared to threaten him.\n\nProsecutors have described the murders as cold-blooded and financially-motivated.\n\nThe brothers' 1993 trial, which was televised and captured national attention, ended with a hung jury. They were convicted of first-degree murder in their second trial.\n\nMany of the brothers' relatives, including their mother's sister, have spoken out in support of their release.\n\nIn the filing, the brothers’ attorneys attacked Hochman for underplaying the rehabilitation efforts they’ve undertaken in the Southern California prison where they are incarcerated, including educational and work-related achievements.\n\n“From the day they were convicted, and as they matured in prison over the many years since trial, in both court filings and public interviews, they have both taken responsibility for the shooting and expressed deep remorse,” the filing states.\n\n\"From a rhetorical perspective, Erik and Lyle certainly understand the District Attorney's continued focus on falsehoods they told in the aftermath of the crime and even during their 1993 and 1996 trials,\" the filing states. \"But case law makes clear that this conduct is of relatively little importance to the question of current dangerousness.\"\n\nThe district attorney's office did not immediately provide a comment in response to the filing.\n\nResentencing is only one path the brothers have relied on in their effort to get out of prison.\n\nIn 2023, they filed a petition seeking to overturn their conviction that cites what their defense has described as new evidence that supports their claims of sexual abuse. They also filed a clemency request with California Gov. Gavin Newsom. Both efforts are ongoing.",

        "content": "ANCHORAGE, Alaska — An iconic pet reindeer beloved by many in Alaska’s largest city has been euthanized, just weeks after someone tampered with his cage and possibly poisoned him, his caretaker said Wednesday.\n\n“I don’t have an answer as to why he had to be put down other than it relates back to what happened,” said Albert Whitehead, who cared not only for the 8-year-old reindeer named Star but also the decades-long tradition of having a reindeer in downtown Anchorage.\n\nStar lived in a fenced-in pen attached to Whitehead’s house on a busy street at the edge of downtown. But starting in early January, someone began tampering with the friendly reindeer and his pen.\n\nA person got inside the pen in January, and Star began losing weight. In February, someone cut the locks off the pen’s gates and Star wandered downtown streets. The following night, someone sprayed some type of substance into Star’s pen.\n\nEarlier, Whitehead shied away from thinking that person might have poisoned Star, but now he doesn’t know.\n\nStar had a persistent cough after the February incidents and then developed pneumonia. It was believed that contents from his stomach were coming up through his nose, and Star breathing that matter back into his lungs caused the pneumonia.\n\nIt’s possible Star ate a plastic bag when he was wandering downtown Anchorage, which could cause indigestion problems and chronic weight loss.\n\nHe was cured of pneumonia but developed a second bout.\n\n“He started to recover and then all of a sudden reversed himself, and we decided it was not possible to save him,” Whitehead said. Star was euthanized Tuesday, the same day the necropsy was conducted.\n\nResults won’t be known for a few weeks as to the possible cause of death or contributing factors, Whitehead said.\n\nThere has been a pet reindeer housed in downtown Anchorage since the 1950s. This particular Star was the seventh in the line to live with either Anchorage pioneers Oro and Ivan Stewart or Whitehead after he took over for the Stewarts in 2002.\n\nStar, which had his own Facebook page, constantly got visitors to his pen, attracting tourists and locals alike. He got daily walks in downtown Anchorage, was featured in parades, was visited by schoolchildren and even appeared on reality TV shows.",

        "source": "https://www.nbcnews.com/",
        "content": "President Donald Trump has favored tariffs for years. His expanding trade war is sure to ripple through the global economy for a long while, too.\n\nThat’s because ramping up tariffs on foreign governments frequently draws retaliation — a likelihood that even industries Trump aims to support are already bracing for. While he has been rolling out an ever-shifting series of import taxes for months, the sweeping “reciprocal” tariffs he announced Wednesday are opening salvos in what could become drawn-out tit-for-tats with potentially dozens of governments.\n\nUnlike the narrower, targeted tariffs Trump imposed on certain countries and products in his first term, his latest duties are set to rewrite the rules of global trade on a far broader level — and in an environment in which inflation is running hotter.\n\n“This is a game changer, not only for the U.S. economy but for the global economy,” Olu Sonola, head of U.S. economic research at Fitch Ratings, said in a note Wednesday evening.\n\n“Many countries will likely end up in a recession. You can throw most forecasts out the door, if this tariff rate stays on for an extended period of time,” she said, adding that the levels Trump is introducing haven’t been seen since 1910.\n\nAlready, the administration is signaling it’s uninterested in diplomacy, raising the odds that foreign leaders will hit back with more levies of their own rather than press for talks.\n\n“This is not a negotiation,” a senior White House official told reporters Wednesday evening. “It’s a national emergency.”\n\nThe European Union has threatened countermeasures by mid-April, and Canada warned last week that it was preparing retaliatory moves to respond swiftly to any trade actions the United States were to unveil Wednesday.\n\nThe legal authority Trump has invoked for his reciprocal tariffs — which range from 10% for some countries to as high as 54% for others — allows him to circumvent many of the typical procedures for instituting new trade barriers. The use of emergency powers not only allows the White House to impose tariffs immediately but also leaves room for the trade war to remain open-ended, with the administration potentially adjusting its levies more or less on the fly until the end of Trump’s term.\n\nA senior automotive executive criticized the 25% tariffs on foreign-built vehicles and auto parts, announced last week, as “process salad” — contrasting the administration’s approach with typical trade policy moves, which tend to give industry stakeholders more clarity about what’s changing and how to prepare for it.\n\n“We would characterize this slate of tariffs as worse than the worst-case scenario,” Dan Ives, global head of technology research at Wedbush Securities, said in a note to clients Wednesday evening.\n\nStill, he said, “we continue to believe there are off ramps and major negotiations that will be happening over the coming months, with various countries and companies to navigate this new world.”\n\nBut Ives and other analysts warn that the unfolding trade war is packed with unknowns and has far greater potential for unintended consequences than any trade policy moves Trump has made previously, including during his first stint in the Oval Office.\n\n“Trump just threw a match on an explosive tinder pile of already weakened inflation concerns,” David Beckworth, a former U.S. Treasury economist who is a senior research fellow at the Mercatus Center, a libertarian think tank, said in a statement Wednesday. “These new tariffs are a perfect recipe for stagflation and a lost midterm elections.”\n\nTrump spoke in categorical, and at times lurid, terms Wednesday about the goals of his tariff agenda, describing the United States as having been “looted, pillaged, raped and plundered” by its trade partners. Domestic industry “will be reborn,” he vowed, and a “golden age of America” is on the way.\n\nFor now, though, investors and corporate leaders across industries are left speculating about what may come next. The automotive executive expected the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, which Trump negotiated in his first term, to be replaced eventually by two separate trade deals — one with each North American neighbor.\n\nOne thing remains certain, economists and business leaders say: Ordinary households are likely to pay more.\n\n“Consumers should expect to see higher prices for everything from groceries to home renovations to auto insurance,” National Foreign Trade Council President Jake Colvin said in a statement. “There is simply no way to mitigate all of the added costs of inputs to finished goods from the administration’s complex and growing web of tariffs.”\n\nHow far that web extends, whom it ensnares — and what holes might be carved in it — remain to be seen.",

        "content": "Elon Musk learned an important lesson on Tuesday: Money isn’t everything.\n\nHis $20 million effort to tilt a State Supreme Court race in Wisconsin to Republicans’ preferred candidate — and, as Musk said just hours before voting ended, to determine the fate of “Western civilization” — ended in failure when Democratic voters swamped the polls.\n\nMusk isn’t the first wealthy man to discover that pouring cash into a campaign doesn’t guarantee victory. Just ask Michael Bloomberg. Or Tom Steyer.\n\nBut although Musk made the wrong financial bet, he was right that the race carried far larger stakes than simply the balance of Wisconsin’s highest court. The contest will help both parties craft a political strategy for next year’s midterm elections.\n\nSpecial elections, like the one in Wisconsin, offer early clues about the political environment. For weeks, strategists have been wondering about the political impact of Musk, who has emerged as one of the most indefatigable forces in the new administration.",

The group describes its mission as supporting and amplifying the voices of “rural and blue-collar patriotic Americans who are disaffected and disenfranchised from the nation’s corridors of power.”\n\nMr. Braynard, who created the group, is a former member of President Trump’s campaign team.\n\nWhen selecting images to accompany the texts, Look Ahead America went with the photo of the shirtless man, which had been taken by the photographer Mike Ruiz for a calendar series that raises funds for Louie’s Legacy Animal Rescue, and the photo of Ms. Ratajkowski, which was posted to Instagram by Inamorata, the apparel company she founded.",

        "source": "https://www.nytimes.com/",
        "content": "In his youth, Kilmer looked like the ideal movie star, with smoldering good looks that were punctuated by naturally pouting, kissable lips. That classically beautiful appearance could have led him down a different path, and, sure, Hollywood occasionally tried to make a traditional leading man out of him. Most notably he was constrained as the vigilante in the cowl in Joel Schumacher’s “Batman Forever” (1995). But he thrived more as a character actor, bringing a bit of weirdo spice to the screen.\n\nHis friend Robert Downey Jr. called him “chronically eccentric.” That eccentricity is in part what contributed to reports throughout his career that he was difficult on set. It’s also what made him compulsively fascinating to watch. He chose and performed roles eccentrically. It wasn’t that he was over the top, it was that he was perpetually unique.\n\nHe could have been pigeonholed a number of times. He made his debut as a rock star in the spoof “Top Secret!” (1984), leaning into a silliness that belied his training at Juilliard. Iceman, just two years later, also could have been an archetype that Kilmer returned to throughout his career. But while Kilmer’s characters often exuded an arrogance that could be self-defeating, he was never interested in repeating himself. He arguably didn’t get enough credit for how much he transformed from part to part.\n\nAs Doc Holliday, that legendary figure of the American West, in “Tombstone” (1993), Kilmer affected a syrupy way of speaking that was seductive but also vaguely threatening. Holliday is suffering from tuberculosis and often drunk, but instead of wobbling with intoxication and disease, Kilmer is oddly still. It makes him entrancing and also somehow unnerving.",

Vietnam’s imports will be taxed at nearly 50 percent.\n\n“If you want your tariff rate to be zero,” Mr. Trump said outside the White House on Wednesday, “then you build your product right here in America.”",

        "content": "In the summer of 1993, the movie “Free Willy” — about a captive killer whale that’s heroically set free — was an unexpected hit. But when word got out that the real whale who played Willy, an orca named Keiko, was dangerously sick and stuck in a tiny pool at an amusement park in Mexico City, the public was outraged. If Warner Bros. wanted to avoid a P.R. nightmare and not break the hearts of children everywhere, then it was clear: Someone had to free Keiko — or at least try.\n\nKeiko was hardly an ideal candidate for release. He’d lived in the care of humans for more than a decade, since he was a calf. He had millions of human fans but not a single orca friend. And he had missed out on uncountable lessons about how to live in the ocean — skills no trainer in the world knew how to teach.\n\n“The Good Whale” tells the story of the wildly ambitious science experiment to return Keiko to the ocean — while the world watched. An epic tale that starts in Mexico and ends in Norway, the six-episode series follows Keiko as he’s transported from country to country, each time landing in the hands of well-intentioned people who believe they know what’s best for him — people who still disagree, decades later, about whether they did the right thing.",

        "title": "What Happened to Val Kilmer? He’s Just Starting to Figure It Out.",
        "source": "https://www.nytimes.com/",
        "content": "All Val Kilmer’s stories are like that, told with that same dash of preordained kismet. He was traveling in Africa in 1994 when he decided to spend a morning exploring a bat cave; later that day, literally seriously that day, he was inspired to call his agent, who had been trying to contact Kilmer for weeks to see if he was interested in playing the role of Batman, now that Michael Keaton was hanging it up. Another story: In the days before he set eyes for the first time on his (now ex-) wife, Joanne Whalley, he dreamed that he met the woman he was destined for and woke up and immediately wrote a poem called, “We’ve Just Met but Marry Me Please.” Then right after that, he went to London, and while he was there, he saw a play, and Whalley was in it. He was so taken with her that he followed her to the pub after-party just so he could look at her. This was crazy even for him, so he made no move. But two years later, in 1987, she would be randomly coincidentally serendipitously cast opposite him in “Willow,” and they would end up married. So yes, he can talk, and it’s such a miracle that he has these abilities, because if you have enough faith, you’ll see how every part of your life is just a piece of a bigger part of your life, and nothing is an accident, and everything is good. We were in his office at HelMel, an office space/art gallery/artists’ studio/retail museum for Val Kilmer’s movie career that takes up several storefronts and more than half the block of Melrose Avenue between Edgemont Street and Heliotrope Drive in Hollywood. Officially, according to Brad Koepenick, his childhood friend and adult business associate, who was in the room to help me better understand Kilmer, HelMel’s mission is to serve as “a fun, sacred space where eclectic artists gather with novices to collaborate, and through new technology, inspire change and spark giving in our local underserved community.”\n\nIt’s hard to believe now, as I write this, but just two months ago, when we were allowed to roam free, when we could board planes and alight from them and wander into rental cars and check into hotels — when we could chase down and replenish the beauty and wonder our very cells need to survive — I went to Los Angeles, where I was asked this question by Val Kilmer: “Do you think South by Southwest will be canceled?” But Val Kilmer no longer sounds like Val Kilmer, the movie star of the ‘80s and ‘90s who has mostly vanished from screens. He hasn’t since his tracheostomy. He can still squeeze air up through his windpipe, however, and past the hole that was cut into his throat and the tracheostomy tube, in a way that makes him somewhat understood — not very, but somewhat. The sound is something between a squeak and a voiceless roar. He says the fact that I can understand him is a result of the endless vocal exercises that he was trained to do when he went to Juilliard after high school, that he was taught to work his voice “like it was a trumpet.” He hated the authoritarian rule at Juilliard while he was there; he hated those stupid vocal exercises. Now look at him, still using his most beloved instrument when really, by all rights, it should be useless. See how it all turned out for the best?\n\nOne is a traditional art gallery. Another is a dark window display with three black cubes that say GOD stenciled in white paint, behind which is an inventory of merch from Kilmer’s long and storied movie career — socks that featured his “Tombstone” character, Doc Holliday, and Jim Morrison coasters from his role in “The Doors” and some paintings that Kilmer himself created, some of which are about his film career (a rendering of his “Top Gun” character, Iceman, with the word “LOVE” stenciled across it) and some that aren’t (a hummingbird in a forest). The final storefront is a door that leads to the Willy Wonka core of HelMel. Inside there’s a podcasting studio, a cafe area and a screening room. HelMel also houses a foundation Val and Koepenick created called TwainMania, which aims to send its Mark Twain curriculum into schools. Twice a week, high school students from South Central Los Angeles practice “Hamlet” and other plays there as part of a program called Inner City Shakespeare. HelMel started holding events last February: a screening of “Tombstone,” an Echo in the Canyon concert. It is the creative incubator of Kilmer’s dreams — the fruition of a vision he had always hoped his 6,000-acre New Mexico ranch would be before he lost most of it in the 2008 housing crash. “The idea is to create kind of a life that’s active,” Kilmer told me. “It’s active. It’s alive. I want the feel of it being alive. You feel the electricity.” He sat at his desk. Behind him was a replica of a painting he had sold to Robert Downey Jr. and, on the other side, a maybe two-foot-tall Batman figure with a Mark Twain head. Elsewhere were Apple computers from the 1980s and 1990s dipped in glossy red paint, a tumbleweed bathed in gold paint. There was a box of newly shipped hardcovers of his new memoir, “I’m Your Huckleberry,” which debuted on the best-seller list in April, a brooding photo of the Val Kilmer of your 1990s matinee memories on its cover. On the walls were more of his paintings, swishes of paint and resin and oil (and sometimes spray paint) on sheets of repurposed aluminum. He makes them by swirling around the chemicals and paint until they look like an emotion or an element to him, at which point he adds a photograph, solidifying his theory into fact. I stood and admired a rectangle of blue-gray haze that he had determined looked like ocean waves, and so he had added photos of swimmers, diving into the waves, one after another. Of all the projects going on inside the studio at that minute, it was a short animated film about Mark Twain that concerned him most. In it, Mark Twain falls asleep and dreams of the resurrection of Jesus Christ, resulting in his waking up and realizing that Mary Baker Eddy, the founder of Christian Science — Val Kilmer is a lifelong Christian Scientist — was correct about God’s eminent perfection and the theories of Mrs. Eddy, as Kilmer calls her, about God’s capacity to heal. Kilmer loves a lot of things, but two of the tops are Mark Twain and Mrs. Eddy. Kilmer wanted to debut the short at South by Southwest in a few weeks. It was early March. There were rumors that festivals and concerts and even air travel might be canceled. Kilmer believed that even if he and his team couldn’t take an airplane, they could just drive to Austin and still screen “Mark Twain Dreams of the Resurrection” and, I don’t know, will the festival into existence. He was undaunted by all the signs and portents that made it feel as if the world were dropping to its knees; he believed if he could get the film done and over to Austin, the rest would take care of itself. So when he asked me if South by Southwest would be canceled, I told him I didn’t know. The surgeon general had started asking the public not to hoard surgical masks, and just that morning, Los Angeles had declared a state of emergency. “You don’t think we will be going to Cannes?” Kilmer asked. “How about the Olympics? The Olympics has never been canceled except in time of world war.” You can’t cancel the world, right? Bad things happen, but you still need art.\n\nRight? Right! You still need art. You still need forward momentum. You still need to believe that all your effort wasn’t for nothing, that we could — we will — survive a dark moment in history and that when that happens, we won’t be left without the things that made those moments decipherable and meaningful and therefore tolerable. The world outside had seemed to be getting so, so bad for so, so long, and this was the first whiff of overarching hope and positivity that I’d witnessed in I couldn’t remember how many months or years now — so much so that I almost couldn’t identify it when I saw it. The last glowing embers of hope coming from Val Kilmer? The movie hunk of my youth, who disappeared unceremoniously and now presented with an entirely different appearance and a bizarre accounting of where he’d been? But there was something familiar about it, like a faint knocking that came from inside me: It was the special kind of optimism that maybe only the faithful have, the enduring belief that some force will come along and save us from the centrifuge of despair we’ve found ourselves in. When is the last time you saw that up close?\n\nBefore you can understand the story of what happened to Val Kilmer, you have to determine for yourself who he was in the first place.\n\nTrying to compare him to any movie star working either now or then will fry your mental circuit board: He was an upwardly mobile conventional movie star; he was equally a fringe weirdo who would soon disappear. His first movie, “Top Secret!” (1984), about a rock star in East Berlin, was the follow-up to “Airplane!” by its creative team, and it was so funny, and such a strange thing to see this extraordinarily handsome young kid — a jaw like the sharp-cut bottom half of a stop sign, that true-Swede golden hair, a Cupid’s bow that lays in shadow of the plump convex swoop of his upper lip — who also seemed to be in on the joke. The ‘80s were a time when a handsome young man with blond hair was mostly the butt of it. He’d been on the road to something slightly more, say, classical when he was at Juilliard. He starred in “Orestes” and in “The Wood Demon.” He wrote a play with his classmates called “How It All Began,” which went on to run for a month at the Public Theater after Joe Papp himself saw it at the school. He starred in “Slab Boys” with Sean Penn and Kevin Bacon. He did “As You Like It” in Minneapolis with Patti LuPone. But once Hollywood got a look at him, he was on too-fast a conveyor belt to safely step off. The success of “Top Secret!” begat a somewhat-starring role in “Real Genius,” meaning that his Chris Knight, the apathetic, irresistible prodigy who helps something laser chemical transmitter radio something, is the guy on the poster, but he’s not the character with the clearest narrative arc; he’s more of a wise fool in the Shakespeare tradition. Another hit. Then in 1986 came “Top Gun,” and after that, everyone knew who Val Kilmer was. Because how could you not? Iceman, the fighter pilot Tom Cruise’s Maverick is trying to best for the “best of the best” of the best position, has maybe 17 words in the whole movie, but it is there that you can see Val Kilmer’s greatest gift, which is to make something out of nothing — to breathe real life into a character who was only there to set the volleyball so that Maverick could spike it.\n\nIf you asked me then what beguiled me about Val Kilmer, I wouldn’t have had the words for it. Instead, I would have pictured a man without a shirt (I am still hard-pressed to picture young Val Kilmer in a regular shirt), but it wasn’t his body that stuck with me when the lights came on. No, it was his awesome physicality, him spinning that volleyball on his finger, him offering the most fraught ‘80s masculinity-soaked condolences ever when Maverick’s radar intercept officer, Goose, buys it during a flight exercise — there was something in his immense focus and his full-bodied commitment to just plain Being-in-the-Scene that took my breath away. I read somewhere that Kilmer was so dedicated to inhabiting the role that he created Team Iceman and Team Maverick factions in the “Top Gun” movie cast. What I also remember is Iceman’s snapping his gum with his mighty jaw in nonresponse to Maverick’s admitting that yes, he’s dangerous. In that jaw snap — which is my absolute favorite GIF to send to people — there’s so much more than a weird way to end a conversation: It’s arrogance and pathos, frustration and whatever the emotion is where you know that laughing at someone will hurt them more than insulting them. The next few jobs came relatively quickly: the crazed, greedy, delightful Madmartigan in “Willow,” shouting epithets at the hero of the story with a vitality and electricity that makes you somehow root for him; “Kill Me Again,” in which he plays a dumb investigator who becomes the mark of a con woman (played by his wife at the time, Joanne Whalley); “The Doors,” an Oliver Stone movie made extremely watchable by Kilmer’s Method performance as Jim Morrison, so Methody and deep in the role, it’s not so long into any kind of rewatching of that movie that I realize I can no longer remember what real Jim Morrison sounded or looked like. Then the beloved “Tombstone,” in which he once again went deep Method on the tubercular dentist, Doc Holliday, sweaty and yellow, gasping for breath through his puffs on his cigarette. It was around this time that both Kilmer and his viewing public ran into a problem. If you’re good at acting, and you’re superhunky, and you look good with your shirt off and also are willing to take it off, you are an excellent candidate for a promotion, and so Val Kilmer leveled up. Pretty soon, he was cast as pure leads of what were or were designed to be blockbusters: “Batman Forever,” “The Island of Dr. Moreau,” “The Saint.” He didn’t do badly in any of those roles, exactly. It’s more as if all the elements were there, but they couldn’t unite to make a real person — the whole was less than the sum of its parts. His Jack Andrews in “Kill Me Again” is supposed to be some kind of Everyman, but he’s really the absence of a person, a body without a soul. In “Thunderheart,” Kilmer plays a regular-guy F.B.I. agent with some Native American lineage, and I couldn’t really get through the rest. In “Batman Forever,” he barely moves his face, and well, here were the reviews: Janet Maslin in this newspaper said Kilmer was “hamstrung by the straight-man aspects of the role,” while Roger Ebert raved that he was “completely acceptable.” There came reports of problems on sets — that he was complaining constantly and making impossible demands; that he was rude to his co-stars and stayed in character all the time, never bothering with even small courtesies to the other people on set. That he fought with Oliver Stone about glorifying substance abuse in a movie that was literally about Jim Morrison; that Kilmer, committed to the Method even through casting, became too aggressive with a woman during an audition in front of Stone and the casting director as he became swept up in an emotionally charged moment. (The incident resulted in a settlement, though he maintains it was the actress who attacked him, and the casting director has said that both actors were physical with each other in the heat of this moment.) Joel Schumacher called him “psychotic” in an interview after directing him in “Batman Forever,” whose sequels Kilmer was supposed to star in. There are several different versions of why George Clooney replaced him — Kilmer says it was because of scheduling difficulties with the other movie he had a contract for, “The Saint” — but one factor was surely this assessment by its director. Multiple sources have claimed that on the set of “The Island of Doctor Moreau,” Kilmer touched his lit cigarette to a crew member’s sideburn. (He claims this was an accident that resulted from the cinematographer’s asking him to blow smoke from off camera very close to where a member of the camera crew was standing. “What kind of person would singe a fellow worker he spends 15 hours a day with, often less than a foot apart? Madness.“) This all begins to explain why it’s hard to make sense of who exactly Val Kilmer was. His whole thing is telling stories, but at this point he didn’t yet know which story he was telling. He can put it all together now far better than he ever could back then. He’d had his pick of roles; he was being offered lucrative franchises. His talent was in doubt by absolutely no one. His gift was both so overt and so subtle that he was the most memorable part of the movies he merely supported. And yet suddenly he was radioactive. He didn’t know how to handle what was happening to him. He’d gotten into acting because he wanted to perform serious roles, but the bigger they came, the more empty and cavernous too. “It was all silly to me,” he said to me in his office. “I’d been preparing to do ‘Hamlet’ for 10 years.” He always thought of himself as a character actor. He could do “a hundred different voices” and a million different impressions. “I would’ve loved to have been on ‘Saturday Night Live’ as a regular,” Kilmer said. “Fame wasn’t my priority, and I had it.” If you read his press around the time of “Batman,” all those interviews are mostly just him complaining about the suit; he liked to say it was “a battering experience” because he loves wordplay. In interviews, he brought up Tom Cruise often, particularly his inclination for movies where instead of running from their oiled, volleyball-playing forms of yesterday, Cruise ran back toward them.\n\n“I have very definitely had a different kind of career than Tom. You never know if a job has commercial success written all over it. I just think life’s too short to worry about that.” — The Los Angeles Times, Dec. 31, 1993\n\n“I have nothing against Tom Cruise, but he must have a large capacity to deal with the business side of movies.” — Details, June 1995\n\nInterviewer: “How about Tom Cruise. You make fun of him sometimes?”\n\nKilmer: “You can’t make fun of Tom Cruise. Poor thing.” — Interview, March 24, 2011\n\nMaybe he was jealous that Cruise was getting all those leads. Maybe he really couldn’t take the leading-man pressure. Maybe he was burned out already from all that Methoding. But that doesn’t seem right. The burnout theory ignores that he was still doing smaller roles on the side in the same magnetic way he had before: his Elvis-inspired cameo in “True Romance,” a movie in which he shines in a tiny role where they don’t even show his face; his bank robber in “Heat.” Forget that amazing shootout sequence that everyone talks about; the movie’s most mesmerizing moment is the 40-second microscene in which he watches a clerk verify that his fake license is real. No, the problem was that he had been trained to inhabit any role he could find himself in; he just couldn’t find himself in a normie, and by the time Kilmer came online as a movie star, normie roles were all there were, the ‘90s standard-issue regular guy in extraordinary circumstances. Kilmer’s greatest roles were always supporting characters. The roles of troubled men with broken souls went to the other guys because who would believe that a guy who looked like him had real troubles or a broken soul? But he couldn’t reverse course and bow out, either. By then, he had been seduced by a lifestyle. Look at his face in a tabloid photo of him and Cher circa 1984. Look at the pride; look how much he enjoyed being on Cher’s arm. It reminds him of something he heard once: “God wants us to walk, but the devil sends a limo.” He was invited to go to Toga by Tadashi Suzuki, whom he calls “the Japanese Stanislavski,” but he turned it down. He didn’t want to say yes to Hollywood, but look at that picture again: How could you say no? By the time he realized how miserable he was, it was too late. He tried to supplement these movies with other artistic endeavors that nourished his soul. He began working on a documentary about nuclear disarmament in 1983, when he was doing “Real Genius.” When he was filming “Wonderland” in 2003, as the porn star John Holmes, he holed up with Ali Alborzi, who had been a protégé of Kilmer’s friend the wildlife photographer Peter Beard, to photograph the set and then make collages of the photographs and pages from the film’s script all over the walls of the Chateau Marmont, and also spill blood all over them, a complex art project I don’t fully understand. He took the roles, always imagining that when he had enough money, he could get out with enough to support both that giant Santa Fe ranch, with its animals and staff, and the artists he wanted to invite to it. “I was gambling with being able to maintain the status, and I would’ve won my gamble, except for 2008.” Not only did he lose his status in Hollywood, but the one spoil he escaped with, his ranch, lost half its value, and he was forced to sell most of it away. “I just lost my home like a million other people. It was pretty awful.”\n\nHis casting problem was solved for him when no one wanted to work with him anymore. The roles went to people who, presumably, were not known for unkindness toward movie crews; the phone stopped ringing. In his book, he sums up this period like this: “In an unflinching attempt to empower directors, actors and other collaborators to honor the truth and essence of each project, an attempt to breathe Suzukian life into a myriad of Hollywood moments, I had been deemed difficult and alienated the head of every major studio.” He says this in an attempt not to apologize (clearly) but to make clear why he behaved the way he did. “Everyone has to work out their own salvation,” he told me. “How to live and by what morality, and I found that the part that I feel bad about is hurting somebody in the process.” He remembered a story from his time as Batman. One day he was filming and about to take off the Batsuit when Warren Buffett and his grandkids came by. They wanted to see Batman, so Kilmer stuck around in the suit, but they didn’t want to talk to him. They wanted to try on the mask and ride in the Batmobile. He understood then that Batman isn’t meant to be a real guy. Batman is meant to be so anonymous that the person who is looking at him can see himself in him. “That’s why it’s so easy to have five or six Batmans,” he says now. “It’s not about Batman. There is no Batman.” And so what kind of thing is that to play, a person whose job is to be as nonspecific as possible. He looked good in the Batsuit, but wearing it was torture. When he took it off, he was finally free. See what he did there? See how it all worked out? That’s a pretty happy ending to a sad story. The lesson here is Val Kilmer’s perpetual lesson, that if you have enough faith — if you can take the long view and remember that things will work out — destiny takes over. I say that to prepare you for the story of what happened to his body, because if you think that turning the story of a blown-up career into a best-case scenario is impressive, wait till you see what the Val Kilmer story-optimizer does with cancer. So: By 2014, he was living a life he loved. He was no longer under contract for franchises he couldn’t put his heart into. He had some money, he had a place in Malibu, his kids nearby, and he could finally do what he wanted. He began to pick the projects that mattered to him. It so happens that the animated short “Mark Twain Dreams of the Resurrection” is not the first movie Kilmer has made about Mark Twain. It’s not even the second, and I’ve heard there’s an additional screenplay for a feature-length script out there, too. But the main Mark Twain event is a film called “Citizen Twain,” and it was conceived as a live performance in which Val Kilmer dresses up as Mark Twain and does Mark Twain- and Christian Science-related stand-up comedy. Take a minute with that sentence. I went to see “Citizen Twain” one rainy Friday night at the College of Staten Island, a half-filled theater, which I remember a little like a fever dream. There’s not a lot of marketing copy that can prepare you for its strangeness, and also its elaborateness, and also its sincerity, and also the delightful warmth of Val Kilmer, whom you will never see happier than when he is presenting this film of his — though it started out as a half-filmed, half-live performance, it is now, in light of his vocal condition, a totally filmed performance that Kilmer merely introduces. The subjects of “Citizen Twain” range from sarsaparilla to congressional representatives being idiots, from Mark Twain quotes to Mrs. Eddy quotes to quotes Val Kilmer only wishes either of them had said. Here he was, using his celebrity and his talent, along with some heavy rubber prosthetics — Mark Twain was many things, but he was not a person who looked like Val Kilmer — to finally do something he wanted, which was to work out for himself the relationship of two people he absolutely worshiped but who were at odds in almost every way. Samuel Clemens was a Christian and a rational man who seemed fairly appalled at Mrs. Eddy’s interpretation of the Bible and its assumptions that healing from illness was something resulting from prayer, rather than medical treatment. He wrote a book about it called “Christian Science,” in which he clearly mocks all of it. But Kilmer believes he did this only because he was so drawn to it. With each project, Kilmer gets a little closer to making the universe conform a little bit more to what he wishes it were: a place where the two historical figures he loves most, Mark Twain and Mrs. Eddy, are finally no longer polar opposites but magnetically aligned.\n\nVal Kilmer can’t remember when it was that Mark Twain first re-entered his life. And he certainly doesn’t know when he first realized that his life’s work would be about trying to meld the visions of Mark Twain and Mrs. Eddy into one. And he certainly can’t remember the year he started having symptoms of what other people (the ones with medical degrees who evaluated him) called throat cancer. Partly this is because he gets tired when he talks now, but mostly it’s because it’s hard to track time and mark space when you don’t believe in them. As near as I can tell, in 2014, as he was touring with “Citizen Twain,” Kilmer found himself in Nashville with a big lump in his throat. He was having a hard time swallowing. He canceled the show. He’d been having symptoms for a while and had woken up in a pool of his own blood a time or two back in Malibu. A doctor eventually told him it was throat cancer, or as Kilmer told me Christian Science calls it, the “suggestion of throat cancer.” Meaning that in Christian Science, “the idea is rather than say I have it or possess it, there is a claim, there’s a suggestion that this is a fact.” He knew the cure for him would be to work with his practitioner, Christian Science’s version of a spiritual adviser, to pray his fear away so that his body would no longer “manifest outwardly what can be diagnosed as a malady.” Meaning it’s not really cancer. It’s just his fear expressing itself — think of what he’d just been through losing all his land, reckoning with his career. He had to go away and pray to relocate his faith within himself. But it wasn’t so easy. He has kids, a grown son and daughter he had while he was still married to Joanne Whalley, and they’re not Christian Scientists. His family couldn’t let him go heal by himself; cancer, as they know it, is a thing that spreads. He relented. “I just didn’t want to experience their fear, which was profound,” Kilmer said. “I would’ve had to go away, and I just didn’t want to be without them.” He had surgery that year, which was followed by chemotherapy and radiation “that zapped my whole throat, and it’s still dry as a bone” and left him with the tracheostomy tube and a feeding tube. Shortly after, Kilmer was spotted wearing scarves, his head slightly askew, as if his neck couldn’t properly hold it up. In 2016, Michael Douglas was doing a press junket after his own bout of cancer, and a reporter asked him about “The Ghost and the Darkness.” Douglas mentioned that Kilmer, his co-star in that movie, was suffering from the same illness he had suffered from. Kilmer denied this, posting on Facebook that he had “no cancer whatsoever.” I asked Kilmer why he said he didn’t have cancer, when it seemed to me, judging by the fact that the thing he described is absolutely the treatment for throat cancer, that he perhaps definitely did. He said, “Because I didn’t have cancer.” I blinked a few times. “They said I was denying that I had cancer, and when they asked me, I didn’t have cancer. It was a bit like do you have a broken bone? And if you broke it in high school, you would say no.” He continued: “Suddenly suspect. I have had a bone broken, but why are you being so aggressive? I had a bone broken. It was broken in my leg. ‘Oh, so you have a broken leg.’ ‘No, no, I don’t,’ I say. I did have a broken leg.” It’s not exactly mind over matter. It is, he tells me, the lost art of Christian healing. ”‘There is nothing either good or bad but thinking makes it so,’” he said, quoting Mrs. Eddy quoting “Hamlet.” “I prayed, and that was my form of treatment.” The doctors did those other things, but it was the prayer that worked, he’s sure. He is no longer suffering from cancer, he said. Or rather, he never was. No, he’s suffering from something quite different. He pointed at his trach tube. “That’s from radiation and chemotherapy. It’s not from cancer.” His prayer, he said, was the true treatment; the medical response to cancer was the thing that hurt him. “That ‘treatment’ caused my suffering.” The next day, Kilmer sat at a conference table in HelMel and opened up a red Igloo cooler and began to mix liquids together from various canisters before putting them into a syringe. He opened his shirt, uncapped his feeding port and injected the food into a tube. It was lunchtime. He has no vices anymore. He watches all the food shows — “Top Chef,” “Chef’s Table,” “Ugly Delicious” — yearning for the time he’ll be able to eat again, though it has been years and he’s not sure how much longer it will be. When it is, though, he said, making his arms into a food-shoveling gesture, “I’m going to look like Orson Welles.” He’s 61 now. He is still so handsome. His hair is still blond. His eyes are still the unimaginable green of Oregon grass right after the rain. His jaw is still the main event — the nasolabial area of his cheek bookending the inferior jowl so that his superior jowl appears sunken and his face takes on romantic geological proportions. He was wearing a very heavy turquoise and coral necklace that his mother, who died last year, wore for 20 years straight, along with her turquoise bracelet. He was never scared during his medical treatment, he told me; he never panicked. Right as he was graduating from high school, his younger brother, Wesley, who had received a diagnosis of epilepsy, drowned in the family’s Jacuzzi. Wesley had been a “supergenius,” he said, a gifted filmmaker who made stop-motion animation ahead of his time. But Kilmer still talks to Wesley. Wesley shows up in his office, and they hash things out or trade ideas. His mother has appeared to him lately, too, as if “she’s at a party, saying how happy she is to be with her husband again and Wesley, my little brother, so happy.” Death isn’t death in Christian Science. It’s simply that humans have limitations, and one of them is that we perceive people only through our five senses. When a person dies, they aren’t gone. They are just not showing up in our senses anymore. So if a Christian Scientist prays and still dies (according to standard definitions of death), it doesn’t mean the prayer didn’t work. As Kilmer said when he was dressed up as Mark Twain, all prayers work: “It’s just that sometimes we don’t like the answer.” So how can you be scared of cancer when there’s no such thing as cancer? How can you fear death when there’s no such thing as death? The answer is you can’t. “Someone comes up to you and says you have only four months to live, and the concept of time is a human one. So, if you describe the divine concept of time, there is no time.”\n\nHe’s been off the trach tube a couple of times, though each time, he has a setback: a cough, a cold, a fever. But why all this talk about the time that fear manifested in his body? He addressed it. He made it through that, and now he’s on the other side, and his life is finally what he wanted it to be. By the time I met him, he had taken “Citizen Twain” to more than 30 cities. “I feel like I could not possibly be in a better place for attracting better and better roles,” he said. “If an actor is fortunate enough to do so, to steer their own course and own their own material, they control their own destiny, creating their own products.” He talked about how Irwin Winkler and Francis Ford Coppola had each leveraged their wealth to get projects made. His slate these days is no different. “I haven’t picked subjects such as boxing, jealousy or uncontrollable madness. Mark Twain and Mary Baker Eddy are the subjects of the film I’ve dedicated 20 years of my life to, on and off.” He told me he’s filmed five roles so far this year. The opportunities are coming in the way they do only when you’re peaceful and not desperate about them. There’s a “Top Gun” sequel coming out this year. Kilmer is in it. He’s not allowed to say anything about the new “Top Gun” except that he’s in it. And that instead of being enemies with Maverick, their relationship has changed. “We’re friends,” he said. “This time we’re friends.” As I walked out of HelMel that day, Kilmer presented me with a gift: It was the abstract painting I admired the day before, with the swimmers diving into the waves. I told him I couldn’t take it — that Times policy was that I couldn’t accept anything even close to this. I put it down. He picked it up. I put it on a desk. He told Brad Koepenick, who stayed with us until the end of the interviews, to carry it out to my car and not let me leave without it. So I took it and put it in the passenger seat with a seatbelt around it, just me and Val Kilmer’s abstract swimmer art driving down Melrose, and honestly, I felt so good and so weightless — spending the day with someone who doesn’t believe in death is as fine an antidote to hearing all the stories of fear that were coming through the radio now as any — that instead of passing Cahuenga Boulevard back to my hotel, I hung a right and went to the movies, the way I used to when I was young. I sat in the movie theater, watching “Portrait of a Lady on Fire” and thinking of stories Kilmer told me: about an accident his daughter was in, how she was walking and got hit by a car on Little Santa Monica and then thrown through a storefront window, but the storefront had been evacuated and so was empty, and even though she’d gone through the glass, she emerged unscathed; about a time he was driving to the airport from his ranch and a car wandered through the median, and he was going too fast to stop, and so his car went through this other car without colliding with it. He can still see the mole on the driver’s neck as he went through him without causing material disturbance to either of their bodies or vehicles. These things happened because he’d been praying his whole life. But the other thing he’d been doing his whole life was telling these stories, turning the way we are constantly walking along the edge of our imminent demise — sure, imminent if you believe in time, demise if you believe in death — and trying to make sense of what could happen to a person at any given moment: a religious person, a person who is trying to be good in the world. That his daughter could be hit by a car? That he could die on the way to the airport? That his reputation could be shattered? That he could have a hole in his throat? Who could blame a person who needed to make sense of the chaotic turns of his life with a story? But even more: What else was he supposed to do? When he told me those stories, I told him it was hard for me to imagine that a person could heal themselves or prevent certain disaster with prayer. He said, “It’s not that difficult.” When he said that, I realized that as the days had gone on, it had become easier to understand him.\n\nThe Times was calling for staff members to return to base and begin working from home, so I headed to the airport the next morning with my suitcase and my painting, which I promised myself I would mail back to Kilmer when I arrived at home. People were wearing masks on my flight and sanitizing the cups of soda they received during in-flight service, and I drifted off to sleep feeling bad for them. South by Southwest was canceled before I even landed. Cannes was postponed. Eventually, the Olympics were too. In the coming weeks, everything was canceled: school, outside, hugs. Peter Beard went missing, and Kilmer took a walk with Ali Alborzi, who was distraught. It was the longest walk Kilmer had taken in a long time, and he realized that two hummingbirds had been following him, had been following them for three days. “Birds have always been a part of my family,” Kilmer texted me. “Being the harbingers of life and the story of death.” He believed the hummingbirds had a message for them about Beard. By then, I thought, “How beautiful.” Perhaps we had created the coronavirus out of our fear and wickedness — children in cages, the rich hoarding wealth; perhaps we had only the suggestion of a virus. I grew up with too many messianics in my household. I found this kind of thing too easy to believe, if only because it was more believable than the fact that in 2020, my young, healthy colleagues were in the hospital, the streets were bare, I was stuck inside my house and nobody knew how long that might go on for. For a few days, I stared at my beautiful painting, which I will absolutely return when it’s safe to take a nonessential trip to the post office. It was so hard to parse all the fear that permeated society now — what was real and what had come as a result of our own hysteria. During the day I’d think that it was the fear that was hurting us most. But at night my husband would shake me to wake me up because I’d been crying in my sleep. More quickly than I could have imagined, the world took on the hallucinogenic quality of right before you fall asleep, when everything is outsize and nothing makes sense. The margins on my suspension of disbelief started to close in on themselves, and the borders of things began to diminish, and now the world seemed like a word you stare at so long that it becomes nonsense. I watched all the Val Kilmer movies again, but this time they struck me as representations of a world that never existed, that couldn’t possibly exist: What is sweaty shirtless fighter pilot? What is dentist with tuberculosis? What is Downtown L.A. shootout? What is Batmobile? What is Lizard King? Amid all this, I received a phone call. One of my closest and oldest friends, Lydia, called me to tell me she had throat cancer. I had seen her a few weeks before, and she told me she had been having bouts of laryngitis. But now she had a diagnosis. It was Stage 0 — it had not yet spread. I cried into the phone with her. But also here I was, finding this out while writing an article about a man who had throat cancer. I called up Kilmer and told him about Lydia. I asked if he had any advice to give her. He did. Kilmer told me she could “have a healing at any minute. It could happen right now, or when she’s on her way to the hospital, or even while a doctor is operating on her.” I called her and told her this, and it made us both giddy for some reason. But then, a few days later, her surgery was postponed because of the coronavirus, and we aren’t sure, even as of this writing, when it will happen, and now her cancer might spread. I felt stupid for trying to find meaning and hope in what was happening to Lydia; I felt stupid for trying to make this into a story for her and for us. In just two weeks, the palm trees against the bright blue sky that hung over HelMel seemed like something I made up, as weird to think about as a Batman figure with a Mark Twain head. (Was that even real? I searched my phone and found a picture of it. Phew.) By now I understood that the story I was telling about Val Kilmer, which I’d thought had been about a man’s relentless faith and optimism, was really about reconciliation: the squaring of two opposing things into something we swear is true despite all evidence to the contrary. Your beauty can sentence you to misery; Val Kilmer uses a tracheostomy tube, but he can talk; his brother is dead but only to our senses. Mark Twain despised Mary Baker Eddy, until you can will him into a dream where he doesn’t. God is good, and there are no ventilators. My beautiful friend has cancer, and the treatment exists, but it’s unavailable to her right now. Here’s the thing: Mark Twain, Kilmer’s favorite storyteller, thought that storytelling couldn’t (and shouldn’t) try to capture an entire life, to draw its arc, to determine its meaning. He was suspicious of the kind of autobiography that Ben Franklin had done. He thought it should just be a mishmash of remembrances told not even in the right order lest a person be tempted to force a story into a certain direction and make themselves a more sympathetic character than they deserve. Here’s another thing: I spoke to his daughter, Mercedes, who told me that she did have a miraculous recovery, but that a bone in her face had been broken and that she was in a wheelchair for a month and required major surgery. I spoke to Val Kilmer one more time. While we were on the phone, I stared at my painting, the divers diving in over and over — What is HelMel? What is ocean? — and I tried to remember how I felt when it was beside me in Los Angeles, in the passenger seat of the rental car. Kilmer told me that he and Alborzi were going to get in a car and drive to New Mexico, where he still has 160 acres of land. Meanwhile, Tom Cruise tweeted that the “Top Gun” sequel was moving to December, two of my colleagues were in the hospital and another’s husband lay in his bed gasping for breath. I attended a Zoom shiva for a friend’s mother, who was buried alone. Peter Beard lay in the woods, weeks away from being found. The Val Kilmer GIF snapped its jaw over and over forever in a text message. Lydia waited by the phone though she had not been told to expect a call, and Val Kilmer planned his road trip into the desert.",

        "content": "Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission. The European Union has a new tool designed to restrict services coming into the bloc. It could be a potential cudgel against U.S. trade measures.\n\nPresident Trump says he is outraged by the fact that the United States imports more goods than it sends to the rest of the world. What he rarely mentions, though, is that when it comes to services, the tables are turned.\n\nService sectors — which include the finance, travel, engineering and medical industries and more — make up the bulk of the American economy. Exports of these services brought more than $1 trillion into the United States last year.\n\nBut that dominance also gives other countries some clout in negotiations — including the ability to impose some pain on the U.S. economy as they look to retaliate against Mr. Trump’s tariffs on goods.\n\nThe European Union, for instance, could use tools designed to restrict services coming into the bloc as a cudgel.\n\n“The real leverage that the Europeans have is ultimately on the services side,” said Mujtaba Rahman, managing director for Europe at the Eurasia Group, a political research firm. “It will escalate before it de-escalates.”\n\nThe United States is the largest exporter of services in the world, and a large share of those services, from financial services to cloud computing, are delivered digitally. The country ran a trade surplus in services of nearly $300 billion last year.\n\nEvery time a European tourist stays at a U.S. hotel, for example, the money spent is counted in the services export basket. And every time someone in Canada or Japan or Mexico pays to listen to music or watch movies and television shows made in the United States, they are adding to America’s surplus in the services trade.\n\nImage Google’s European headquarters in central Dublin. For more than a decade, the European Union has gone after Silicon Valley’s biggest companies for anticompetitive business practices and other regulatory violations. Credit... Paulo Nunes dos Santos for The New York Times\n\nMany of the countries that the United States is targeting for tariffs run a services deficit with the United States, including Canada, China, Japan, Mexico and much of Europe, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.\n\n“The E.U. is now equipped with policy tools to extend the range of retaliation against U.S. tariffs to target imports of U.S. services,” Filippo Taddei, a managing director of global investment research at Goldman Sachs, wrote in a research note about possible European responses.\n\nArguably the most extreme option is known as the Anti-Coercion Instrument. First proposed in 2021, the tool is largely untested, but it allows the European Union to hit a trading partner with a “wide range of possible countermeasures.”\n\nSuch measures could include tariffs, restrictions on trade in services and limits on trade-related aspects of intellectual property rights. That could affect American tech giants like Google. Several European diplomats said that use of the tool is a distinct possibility, should the trade war escalate.\n\nWhile possible restrictions aimed at services would be a new trade war response, Brussels has a history of penalizing the U.S. tech industry for other reasons. For more than a decade, the European Union has gone after Silicon Valley’s biggest companies for anticompetitive business practices, weak data privacy protections and lax content moderation policies.\n\nEurope’s aggressive oversight has led to notable product changes because the European Union, home to about 450 million people, is a major market. Google has changed the way it displays search results, Apple has tweaked its App Store, and Meta has made adjustments to Instagram and Facebook because of E.U. rules.\n\nTaking aim at the tech industry would intensify a feud with the Trump administration over European tech regulation. Even before the tariff standoff, senior officials including Vice President JD Vance have criticized the European Union for what they view as excessive regulation of American tech companies.\n\nImage An Apple store in Manhattan. The European Union is expected to announce fines against Apple for violating a law intended to make it easier for smaller companies to compete against tech giants. Credit... Hilary Swift for The New York Times\n\nAs soon as this week, the European Union was expected to announce new fines against Apple and Meta for violating the Digital Markets Act, a law passed in 2022 intended to make it easier for smaller companies to compete against tech giants. Meta and X are under investigation under another new law, called the Digital Services Act, that requires companies to do more to police their platforms for illicit content.\n\nBritain, on the other hand, may use its rules over service imports as a carrot instead of a stick.\n\nFor weeks, British officials have tried to reassure the public that it was in a strong position to negotiate with the Trump administration to avoid tariffs, repeatedly pointing to the relatively balanced goods trade between the two countries. (Britain has a surplus when it comes to services.)\n\nStill, one sore point for Trump administration officials has been Britain’s digital services tax, which they say unfairly harms American tech giants. The tax was introduced in 2020 as a 2 percent levy on revenues of search engines, social media services and online marketplaces. It is expected to raise the equivalent of more than $1 billion for the British treasury this fiscal year.\n\nBritish officials said changes in this are part of negotiations with the Trump administration. Last month, Rachel Reeves, the chancellor of the Exchequer, said, “We’ve got to get the balance right.”\n\nBritain has sought to position itself in a “Goldilocks zone” between the United States and European Union, according to researchers at Chatham House, a research institute, maintaining good relationships with both and keeping some regulation.\n\nIf scrapping the digital services tax brings about “a sweetheart deal for the U.K. that avoids the worst of U.S. tariffs, it might prove a masterstroke,” wrote the researchers, Alex Krasodomski and Olivia O’Sullivan. “But that is highly uncertain — the president’s application of tariffs has been in constant flux.”\n\nIt was more likely that Britain would eventually have to pick a closer allegiance to either the United States or the European Union, they added.",

Last month, Rachel Reeves, the chancellor of the Exchequer, said, “We’ve got to get the balance right.”\n\nBritain has sought to position itself in a “Goldilocks zone” between the United States and European Union, according to researchers at Chatham House, a research institute, maintaining good relationships with both and keeping some regulation.\n\nIf scrapping the digital services tax brings about “a sweetheart deal for the U.K. that avoids the worst of U.S. tariffs, it might prove a masterstroke,” wrote the researchers, Alex Krasodomski and Olivia O’Sullivan. “But that is highly uncertain — the president’s application of tariffs has been in constant flux.”\n\nIt was more likely that Britain would eventually have to pick a closer allegiance to either the United States or the European Union, they added.",

        "content": "President Trump’s announcement of sweeping universal and so-called reciprocal tariffs on countries around the world drew a swift rebuke on Wednesday from business groups, trade experts, Democratic lawmakers and many economists who warned that they would raise prices for American consumers and slow economic growth.\n\n“This is catastrophic for American families,” said Matt Priest, president and chief executive of the Footwear Distributors and Retailers of America. “We had hoped the president would take a more targeted approach, but these broad tariffs will only drive-up costs, reduce product quality and weaken consumer confidence.”\n\nOther reactions were more muted, and some positive, saying the move was long overdue.\n\n“Today is arguably the single greatest trade and economic policy action in the history of the country, and it absolutely cements President Trump’s legacy that he is trying to usher in a new golden age of economy production and prosperity,” said Nick Iacovella, executive vice president at the Coalition for a Prosperous America, a group that supports tariffs. He said the tariffs would contribute to “broadly re-industrializing the United States and creating working class jobs.”\n\nMr. Trump insisted on Wednesday that experts had been wrong all along about his tariffs and that the anxiety about them now was misplaced. But those who will be forced to pay the tariffs were quick to raise concerns about the move, which will increase import taxes on products from some of America’s biggest trading partners including China, the European Union, Japan and India.",

        "source": "https://www.nytimes.com/",
        "content": "President Trump, as part of his rollout of sweeping tariffs on Wednesday, also scrapped a shipping workaround for low-cost products from China and Hong Kong, a move that is poised to alter how lots of online purchases are taxed.\n\nThe provision, known as the de minimis exception, has been used by many e-commerce companies to send goods to the United States from China without having to pay taxes on them. Mr. Trump’s initial decision in February to revoke the loophole set off confusion and chaos within the U.S. Postal Service, as well as among retailers and shippers, as hundreds of thousands of packages coming into the United States each day from China were suddenly subject to tariffs and requirements for much more information.\n\nHere’s what to know about the de minimis rule:\n\nWhat is the de minimis provision?\n\nThe de minimis rule, or Section 321 of the Tariff Act of 1930, was originally aimed at allowing American tourists to send goods bought overseas to the United States without facing taxes. But more recently, companies have used the provision to ship products from other countries that have a retail value below a certain threshold without being subjected to taxes — a huge tax advantage.\n\nIn 2016, Congress raised the entry threshold to $800, from $200. Since then, the number of duty-free parcels has risen tenfold. Under the rule, packages can be shipped from other countries without paying tariffs, as long as the shipments do not exceed $800 per recipient per day.",

        "content": "The operative running Mr. Musk’s America PAC in Wisconsin, Keith Gilkes, was on vacation for 10 days during the race’s final stretch, which raised eyebrows among some involved in the race, according to two people with direct knowledge. Mr. Gilkes did not attend Mr. Musk’s rally in Green Bay. He did not respond to requests for comment on Wednesday.\n\nMr. Musk had talked openly about his desire to spend “heavily” in 2025 on local races, like those for district attorney and judges. His engagement in the Wisconsin race came just eight days after Tesla sued the state over a law restricting vehicle sales. A few weeks later, Mr. Musk’s groups began a pro-Schimel advertising campaign, and he began building a canvassing operation that included up to 500 people across the state who knocked on doors for around $25 an hour.\n\nMr. Musk made himself central to his group’s messaging. “I am with America PAC, an organization run by Elon Musk,” reads part of one question that Wisconsin canvassers said at doors. Later, they ask: “Can President Trump and Elon Musk count on you to vote for Brad Schimel?”\n\nJudge Schimel’s team felt they were often given very late notice about Mr. Musk’s activities in the state, including Mr. Musk’s desire for an X Spaces event with Judge Schimel himself, according to a person close to the campaign. Judge Schimel had less than a day’s notice before that event was finalized, and he was previously scheduled to be on a bus tour throughout the state. So he had to rent a hotel in rural Wisconsin to ensure he would have good internet access for the event, according to two people with knowledge of his schedule.\n\nMr. Musk, who has achieved wild success running his companies, has appeared to some Trump aides to be frustrated that he has not been able to sufficiently exert his will over the federal bureaucracy while running the Department of Government Efficiency, his government overhaul initiative. He has raged about judicial rulings and exhorted his team to bulldoze through internal rules and regulations, but his progress has been slower than he imagined, people who have spoken to him said.\n\nMr. Musk had pushed to be a special government employee, a role that is unique in that it is limited to a 130-day duration. These employees are not subject to various ethics rules, and they sometimes are able to fudge the time limits that supposedly bracket their work. He could theoretically return as a special government employee in 2026, but Mr. Musk said in an interview last week that he would “have accomplished most of the work” he set out to within the 130-day time frame.",

A number of big law firms have rushed to strike deals with the administration after Mr. Trump signed executive orders against three firms that crippled their ability to represent clients with government contracts or other government business.\n\nThree firms are fighting the administration in court and federal judges have temporarily blocked the orders against them. But a big one, Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison, chose to settle after being hit with an executive order on March 14. The firm’s settlement has been roundly criticized by law professors and others in the legal industry. Critics said the firm’s decision would only embolden Mr. Trump to go after more firms he views as having helped his political enemies or causes he rejects.\n\nIn the statement posted on Truth Social, Mr. Trump said Milbank supported his initiative to end the “weaponization” of the legal system and to avoid partisan litigation. The president’s post included a statement from Scott Edelman, Milbank’s chairman, in which he said the firm was glad to be able to “find common ground” with Mr. Trump.\n\nMr. Edelman did not immediately return a request for comment.\n\nEarlier on Wednesday, the New York City Bar issued a strong statement of support for the suits against the Trump administration. The country’s oldest attorney bar association said it supported the lawsuits filed by WilmerHale and Jenner & Block and it affirmed the rights of lawyers to represent whomever they wanted.",

But with their industry under attack from President Trump, most of these leaders of Big Law are not speaking up to defend one of their own.\n\nFor nearly three weeks, there has been a broad effort in the legal community to collect signatures from law firms for a so-called friend of the court brief supporting Perkins Coie, the first firm Mr. Trump targeted with an executive order in his retribution campaign against perceived enemies. Perkins Coie has sued, and a judge has temporarily blocked the president’s order, which jeopardized its ability to represent government contractors and limited its access to federal buildings.\n\nMost of the nation’s top firms by revenue were asked to sign the brief supporting Perkins Coie, according to people with knowledge of the matter, and all of them were made aware of the signature campaign.\n\nBut so far, none of the top 10 firms has committed to signing, even after a soft deadline came and went on Tuesday, the people with knowledge of the matter said.

He drew more votes even than Justice Janet Protasiewicz had received in Wisconsin’s 2023 contest for the court, when she delivered an 11-point thumping to the conservative candidate. That was the last judicial race that Democrats had turned into a national cause.\n\nThe problem for Republicans this time was that Susan Crawford, the liberal candidate on Tuesday, won 78 percent of Vice President Kamala Harris’s vote total in Wisconsin — an astonishing figure for a spring election in an off year, and one that made a mockery of the bar the G.O.P. had set for itself.\n\nThis was an across-the-map thrashing: Judge Crawford’s percentage of the Harris vote was higher than Judge Schimel’s percentage of the Trump vote in every one of Wisconsin’s 72 counties.",

        "content": "Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission. The European Union has a new tool designed to restrict services coming into the bloc. It could be a potential cudgel against U.S. trade measures.\n\nPresident Trump says he is outraged by the fact that the United States imports more goods than it sends to the rest of the world. What he rarely mentions, though, is that when it comes to services, the tables are turned.\n\nService sectors — which include the finance, travel, engineering and medical industries and more — make up the bulk of the American economy. Exports of these services brought more than $1 trillion into the United States last year.\n\nBut that dominance also gives other countries some clout in negotiations — including the ability to impose some pain on the U.S. economy as they look to retaliate against Mr. Trump’s tariffs on goods.\n\nThe European Union, for instance, could use tools designed to restrict services coming into the bloc as a cudgel.\n\n“The real leverage that the Europeans have is ultimately on the services side,” said Mujtaba Rahman, managing director for Europe at the Eurasia Group, a political research firm. “It will escalate before it de-escalates.”\n\nThe United States is the largest exporter of services in the world, and a large share of those services, from financial services to cloud computing, are delivered digitally. The country ran a trade surplus in services of nearly $300 billion last year.\n\nEvery time a European tourist stays at a U.S. hotel, for example, the money spent is counted in the services export basket. And every time someone in Canada or Japan or Mexico pays to listen to music or watch movies and television shows made in the United States, they are adding to America’s surplus in the services trade.\n\nImage Google’s European headquarters in central Dublin. For more than a decade, the European Union has gone after Silicon Valley’s biggest companies for anticompetitive business practices and other regulatory violations. Credit... Paulo Nunes dos Santos for The New York Times\n\nMany of the countries that the United States is targeting for tariffs run a services deficit with the United States, including Canada, China, Japan, Mexico and much of Europe, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.\n\n“The E.U. is now equipped with policy tools to extend the range of retaliation against U.S. tariffs to target imports of U.S. services,” Filippo Taddei, a managing director of global investment research at Goldman Sachs, wrote in a research note about possible European responses.\n\nArguably the most extreme option is known as the Anti-Coercion Instrument. First proposed in 2021, the tool is largely untested, but it allows the European Union to hit a trading partner with a “wide range of possible countermeasures.”\n\nSuch measures could include tariffs, restrictions on trade in services and limits on trade-related aspects of intellectual property rights. That could affect American tech giants like Google. Several European diplomats said that use of the tool is a distinct possibility, should the trade war escalate.\n\nWhile possible restrictions aimed at services would be a new trade war response, Brussels has a history of penalizing the U.S. tech industry for other reasons. For more than a decade, the European Union has gone after Silicon Valley’s biggest companies for anticompetitive business practices, weak data privacy protections and lax content moderation policies.\n\nEurope’s aggressive oversight has led to notable product changes because the European Union, home to about 450 million people, is a major market. Google has changed the way it displays search results, Apple has tweaked its App Store, and Meta has made adjustments to Instagram and Facebook because of E.U. rules.\n\nTaking aim at the tech industry would intensify a feud with the Trump administration over European tech regulation. Even before the tariff standoff, senior officials including Vice President JD Vance have criticized the European Union for what they view as excessive regulation of American tech companies.\n\nImage An Apple store in Manhattan. The European Union is expected to announce fines against Apple for violating a law intended to make it easier for smaller companies to compete against tech giants. Credit... Hilary Swift for The New York Times\n\nAs soon as this week, the European Union was expected to announce new fines against Apple and Meta for violating the Digital Markets Act, a law passed in 2022 intended to make it easier for smaller companies to compete against tech giants. Meta and X are under investigation under another new law, called the Digital Services Act, that requires companies to do more to police their platforms for illicit content.\n\nBritain, on the other hand, may use its rules over service imports as a carrot instead of a stick.\n\nFor weeks, British officials have tried to reassure the public that it was in a strong position to negotiate with the Trump administration to avoid tariffs, repeatedly pointing to the relatively balanced goods trade between the two countries. (Britain has a surplus when it comes to services.)\n\nStill, one sore point for Trump administration officials has been Britain’s digital services tax, which they say unfairly harms American tech giants. The tax was introduced in 2020 as a 2 percent levy on revenues of search engines, social media services and online marketplaces. It is expected to raise the equivalent of more than $1 billion for the British treasury this fiscal year.\n\nBritish officials said changes in this are part of negotiations with the Trump administration.

But Senate passage of the measure on a vote of 51 to 48 — just hours after Mr. Trump unveiled sweeping tariffs on more than 100 trading partners, including the European Union, China, Britain and India — sent a signal of bipartisan congressional opposition to the president’s trade war.\n\nThe resolution targets the emergency powers Mr. Trump invoked in February to impose sweeping tariffs on Canada, a move that has rattled markets and drawn bipartisan criticism from lawmakers concerned about the economic impact on their states and districts.\n\nMr. Trump imposed the tariffs in an executive order that cited the International Economic Emergency Powers Act, a Cold War-era law that has most often been used to impose sanctions on rogue states and human rights violators. His administration argued that unchecked drug trafficking from Canada constituted a dire threat to American national security and used it as justification to unilaterally impose 25 percent tariffs on America’s closest trading partner.",

        "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/",
        "content": "Several Republican senators joined Democrats to pass a resolution that would block Donald Trump’s tariffs on Canada, a rare rebuke of the president’s trade policy just hours after he announced plans for sweeping import taxes on some of the country’s largest trading partners.\n\nIn a 51-48 vote, four Republicans – Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and both Kentucky senators, the former majority leader Mitch McConnell and Rand Paul – defied Trump’s pressure campaign and supported the measure. Democrats used a procedural maneuver to force a vote on the resolution, which would terminate the national emergency on fentanyl Trump is using to justify tariffs on Canada.\n\nWhile Trump’s sweeping new tariffs, introduced in a White House Rose Garden ceremony on Wednesday, did not include additional levies on Canada, the Senate vote amounted to a significant bipartisan condemnation of the president’s escalating global trade war with allies and enemies alike.\n\n“Tariffs will hurt our families. Canada is not an enemy,” the Democratic senator Tim Kaine, the bill’s sponsor, said in a floor speech on Wednesday. “Let’s not label an ally as an enemy. Let’s not impose punishing costs on American families at a time they can’t afford it. Let’s not hurt American small businesses. Let’s not make our national security investments in ships and subs more expensive.”\n\nRepublicans have expressed varying degrees of unease over Trump’s clampdown on free trade – once a pillar of conservative orthodoxy – but few were willing to cross him, and many GOP leaders and supporters, including the House speaker Mike Johnson, were in the Rose Garden on Wednesday – a day dubbed “liberation day” by the president – as a way of championing the historic barrage of tariffs on goods from overseas he believes will boost American manufacturing.\n\nBefore the vote, the Senate majority leader John Thune of South Dakota urged Republicans to oppose the resolution, arguing that the tariffs were needed to “ensure that President Trump has the tools to combat the flow of fentanyl from all directions”.\n\nIn a post on his social media platform, Truth Social, sent just before 1am ET on Wednesday, Trump assailed the four GOP senators who had expressed opposition to his tariffs, imploring them to “get on the Republican bandwagon, for a change, and fight the Democrats wild and flagrant push to not penalize Canada for the sale, into our Country, of large amounts of Fentanyl”.\n\nHe vowed not to sign the measure if it reached his desk.\n\nDefending her vote, Collins said that the tariffs would hurt working families in her state of Maine, which shares a long border with Canada.\n\n“The price hikes that will happen for Maine families, every time they go to the grocery store, they fill their gas tank, they fill their heating oil tank, if these tariffs go into effect, will be so harmful,” she said in a Wednesday floor speech. “And as price hikes always do, they will hurt those the most who can afford them the least.”\n\nShe also argued that fentanyl from Canada was not a major threat to the US, as Trump’s national emergency claims. “The fact is the vast majority of fentanyl in America comes from the southern border,” she said.\n\nDemocrats argued that Americans were turning against Trump’s agenda, pointing to a string of strong performances by their party in recent special elections that included a consequential victory in a Wisconsin state supreme court race on Tuesday night.\n\n“The American people are seeing how bad Trump is,” the Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer, said in a floor speech. “Tariffs is a good part of it. And they are not supporting people like Elon Musk and those who support Donald Trump.”\n\nEarlier on Wednesday, the representative Gregory Meeks, the top Democrat on the House foreign affairs committee, said he would also force a similar vote in the House on the tariffs.\n\n“Republicans can’t keep ducking this – it’s time they show whether they support the economic pain Trump is inflicting on their constituents,” he wrote on X.",

        "content": "NaNoWriMo, the US-based nonprofit organisation that challenged people to write a novel in a month, has announced it is closing down after 20 years.\n\nNaNoWriMo – an abbreviation of National Novel Writing Month – fostered an online community of participants aiming to write 50,000 words of fiction in November. It began informally in 1999 before becoming a nonprofit in 2006. Each year, tens of thousands signed up to the organisation’s flagship programme.\n\nOn Monday, NaNoWriMo announced its closure to community members via email. A 27-minute YouTube video posted the same day by the organisation’s interim executive director Kilby Blades explained that it had to close due to ongoing financial problems, which were compounded by reputational damage.\n\nIn November 2023, several community members complained to the nonprofit’s board, Blades said. They believed that staff had mishandled accusations made in May 2023 that a NaNoWriMo forum moderator was grooming children on a different website.\n\nThe moderator was eventually removed, though this was for unrelated code of conduct violations and occurred “many weeks” after the initial complaints. In the wake of this, community members came forward with other complaints related to child safety on the NaNoWriMo sites.\n\nThe organisation was also widely criticised last year over a statement on the use of artificial intelligence in creative writing. After stating that it did not support or explicitly condemn any approach to writing, including the use of AI, it said that the “categorical condemnation of artificial intelligence has classist and ableist undertones”.\n\nIt went on to say that “not all writers have the financial ability to hire humans to help at certain phases of their writing”, and that “not all brains have same abilities … There is a wealth of reasons why individuals can’t ‘see’ the issues in their writing without help.”\n\nFantasy author CL Polk said at the time that “NaNo is basically asserting that disabled people don’t have what it takes to create art when they trot out the lie that scorning AI is ableist”.\n\nThough the AI controversy received widespread press coverage, Blades’ video primarily focused on the child safety concerns. She said that NaNoWriMo’s position on AI had been covered “frankly so inaccurately”.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Bookmarks Free weekly newsletter Discover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

NaNoWriMo will keep its websites live for “as long as possible” so that “people can take what they want from their accounts”, but did not specify a date when the sites would shut down.\n\n“We hold no belief that people will stop writing 50,000 words in November,” read Monday’s email. “Many alternatives to NaNoWriMo popped up this year, and people did find each other. In so many ways, it’s easier than it was when NaNoWriMo began in 1999 to find your writing tribe online.”",

        "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/",
        "content": "Donald Trump has hit the UK with tariffs of 10% on exports to the US as he ignited a global trade war that could wipe billions off economic growth.\n\nThe US president accused other nations, including allies, of “looting, pillaging, raping and plundering” the US, as he announced tariffs on economic rivals including 20% on the EU and 34% on China as part of what he dubbed “liberation day”.\n\nDowning Street, which had been expecting a 20% rate to be imposed on the UK, expressed relief to have escaped the higher rate. Keir Starmer’s more conciliatory approach to the Trump administration appeared to have paid off.\n\nHowever, the UK’s growth forecasts are likely to be downgraded as a result, and the tariffs could cost thousands of jobs and force the government to implement further spending cuts or tax rises in autumn.\n\nUK ministers have ruled out imposing retaliatory barriers while talks on an economic deal with the US continue, and are hoping for further carve-outs for UK companies, which export more than £60bn worth of goods to the US each year.\n\nIn a watershed announcement for global trade, Trump announced that he was setting a universal “baseline” 10% tariff on imports into the US, while hitting dozens of trading partners with higher levies of up to 50%.\n\nHe also hit out at “exorbitant” VAT rates, which he viewed as a barrier to US firms seeking to sell into markets such as the UK where the taxes apply.\n\nAt a press conference in the White House Rose Garden, he said: “For decades, our country has been looted, pillaged, raped and plundered by nations near and far, both friend and foe alike … our country and its taxpayers have been ripped off for more than 50 years, but it is not going to happen any more.\n\n“This is one of the most important days, in my opinion, in American history. It’s our declaration of economic independence. For years, hard-working American citizens were forced to sit on the sidelines as other nations got rich and powerful, much of it at our expense, but now it’s our turn to prosper.”\n\nAddressing a crowd including his vice-president, JD Vance, the cabinet, White House aides and US workers, Trump added: “This will be, indeed, the golden age of America. It’s coming back, and we’re going to come back very strongly.”\n\nAfter the announcement, Jonathan Reynolds, the business and trade secretary, said: “The US is our closest ally, so our approach is to remain calm and committed to doing this deal, which we hope will mitigate the impact of what has been announced today.\n\n“We have a range of tools at our disposal and we will not hesitate to act … nobody wants a trade war and our intention remains to secure a deal. But nothing is off the table and the government will do everything necessary to defend the UK’s national interest.”\n\nA No 10 source said: “We don’t want any tariffs at all, but a lower levy than others vindicates our approach. It matters because the difference between 10% and 20% is thousands of jobs.”\n\nEarlier, Starmer had told MPs the government was “prepared for all eventualities” and while all options were on the table he would avoid any kneejerk response.\n\nUK officials are understood to have reached broad agreement with US counterparts on a trade deal, focusing on technology but including other sectors, which they hope will eventually reduce tariffs. However, they acknowledged getting a trade deal over the line could take weeks or months.\n\nThere is also a risk of the UK being flooded by cheap goods from countries such as China as trade is diverted from the US to other markets, and the government is drawing up plans to protect key industries such as pharmaceuticals, cars, food and drink.\n\n“A trade war is in nobody’s interest, and the country deserves, and we will take, a calm, pragmatic approach,” Starmer told MPs at prime minister’s questions.\n\n“That is why constructive talks are progressing to agree a wider economic prosperity deal with the US. That is why we are working with all industries and sectors likely to be impacted.\n\n“Our decision will always be guided by our national interests, and that’s why we have prepared for all eventualities, and we will rule nothing out.”\n\nHe added: “It is important at moments like this that we don’t have kneejerk reactions, that we are cool-headed about this.”\n\nHowever, Rachel Reeves revealed the UK was in talks with trading partners about how to respond, and had spoken to the European trade commissioner, Valdis Dombrovskis, about the EU’s plans to retaliate with their own tariffs.\n\nThe chancellor insisted the UK would not jeopardise the possibility of its own economic deal with the US by “posturing” in response to tariffs.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We are not going to do anything to put that in jeopardy,” she told the Treasury select committee.\n\nBut she warned that the UK would not be “out of the woods” even if it secured a deal, as the main impact on the British economy would be from global tariffs rather than UK-specific ones, thanks to depressed demand and higher inflation in other countries.\n\nBusiness groups and unions reacted with dismay to the announcement. The Institute of Directors’ Emma Rowland said: “The implementation of these ‘liberation day’ tariffs will be a blow to British businesses, eliminating any hopes that the UK would be able to avoid the crosshairs of the global trade war.\n\n“The UK government has so far sought to pursue constructive engagement with the US administration and with other trading partners. We are supportive of this pragmatic and level-headed approach.”\n\nPaul Nowak, general secretary of the Trades Union Congress, said: “Donald Trump has just made the strongest possible argument for the UK to positively reset its economic relationship with the EU, our largest market. In the face of punitive and arbitrary tariffs, the government must do everything it can to protect British jobs and industry.”\n\nIn its economic forecast last week, the Office for Budget Responsibility warned that the most “severe” scenario, in which the UK and other nations retaliated to US tariffs, would result in GDP being 0.6% lower than expected this year and 1% lower next year.\n\nAn alternative scenario, in which the UK did not retaliate, would mean a smaller reduction in growth, with GDP 0.4% lower than expected this year and 0.6% lower next year.\n\nDespite repeated criticism of Canada and Mexico, the US’s two closest trading partners, Donald Trump did not announce any “reciprocal tariffs” on the two North American countries.\n\nThe US dollar was falling sharply against key currencies on Wednesday evening. The dollar had dropped about 0.7% against the pound, at 0.768, shortly after the speech began.\n\nTrump confirmed a previously announced 25% tariff on cars imported into the US, set to come into effect early on Thursday, hitting a UK export market to the US worth £6.4bn, which includes luxury car manufacturers such as Rolls-Royce and Aston Martin.\n\nThe US president has already imposed 25% tariffs on steel and aluminium imports, and industry bosses have warned that customers were already looking for alternative suppliers and in some cases cancelling orders.\n\nThe White House’s tariff wars also risk reopening simmering Brexit tensions in Northern Ireland, which has continued to apply EU customs laws since Brexit, meaning splits between London and Brussels over the response to US tariffs could drive a wedge between it and the rest of the UK.\n\nEU retaliatory tariffs on US imports would need to be paid by Northern Irish importers, even if Starmer secured a carve-out for the UK or chose not to immediately respond. Businesses can claim back the tax through a reimbursement scheme but trade experts said the issue could reopen old political sores.\n\nThe EU said Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, would set out its response on Thursday morning.\n\nThe shadow trade secretary, Andrew Griffith, described Trump’s tariff announcement as “disappointing news” but suggested that Brexit had spared the UK from higher import taxes.\n\nHe said: “The silver lining is that Brexit, which Labour ministers voted against no less than 48 times, means that we face far lower tariffs than the EU: a Brexit dividend that will have protected thousands of British jobs and businesses.”",

        "title": "‘Loser’: Musk endures wave of gloating on X after liberal judge wins Wisconsin race",
        "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/",
        "content": "Democrats were tasting unfamiliar triumphalism on Wednesday after the election for a vacant Wisconsin supreme court seat turned into an emphatic repudiation of Elon Musk, Donald Trump’s richest supporter and key ally.\n\nMusk endured a wave of gloating on Twitter/X, his own social media platform, after Brad Schimel, a Trump-endorsed judge that he spent $25m supporting lost by 10 percentage points to Susan Crawford, whose victory sustained a 4-3 liberal majority on the court.\n\nOn a day that Trump has earmarked as “liberation day” to mark his long-awaited roll out of trade tariffs, Democrats seized on the result as a referendum on Musk – who has spearheaded the president’s slashing of federal government workers and spending programmes – while casting it as a platform for a recovery in next year’s congressional midterm elections.\n\nIn a display of schadenfreude, the Democrats’ official account posted a picture of Musk donning a cheese head and accompanied with the single word “Loser”.\n\nCrawford, a former attorney for Planned Parenthood, presented her success as a triumph over Musk. “As a little girl, I never could have imagined that I’d be taking on the richest man in the world for justice in Wisconsin. And we won,” she told cheering supporters on Tuesday night.\n\nThe result is politically significant because the court is due to issue abortion rulings while also deciding on electoral redistricting questions which now have the potential to help Democrats in future elections in a state where contests are traditionally close.\n\nDemocrats have sought to exploit Musk’s growing unpopularity to tar Trump and the Republican generally. Recent polls show a majority of voters have a negative view of Musk, who was once popular with the US public.\n\nHakeem Jeffries, the Democrat leader in the House of Representatives, said it was now on Republicans to separate themselves from Musk.\n\n“Time for them to walk away from this unelected, unpopular, unhinged and un-American billionaire puppet master,” he told MSNBC. “He tried to spend his unlimited resources to buy a state supreme court seat in Wisconsin, and it failed spectacularly.”\n\nChuck Schumer, the party’s leader in the Senate, said the result “sent a decisive message to Elon Musk, Donald Trump and Doge… our democracy is not for sale.”\n\nOther party figures were blunter. Tim Walz, the governor of Minnesota and Kamala Harris’s running mate for the Democrats in the 2024 presidential election, was succinct on Musk’s social media platform X, formerly Twitter.\n\n“Wisconsin beat the billionaire,” he posted.\n\nJasmine Crockett, a Democrat House member from Texas, posted: “Well well well, I guess Wisconsin agreed on the message for old Elon: “F’ off!,” she wrote.\n\nEric Swalwell, a California representative, called the result an “ass-kicking” for Republicans, adding: “Where else does Elon want to try and buy an election.”\n\nJB Pritzker, the Democratic governor of Illinois and himself a billionaire, wrote: “Elon Musk is not good at this.”\n\nSuspicions that Musk’s profile and conspicuous wealth have become an electoral turnoff also appeared to infect Republicans.\n\nPam Van Handel, a Republican party chair in Wisconsin’s Outagamie county, told Politico: “I thought [Musk] was gonna be an asset for this race. People love Trump, but maybe they don’t love everybody he supports.”\n\nThe site quoted Rohn Bishop, the Republican mayor of the Wisconsin city of Waupun, as saying: “I thought maybe Elon coming could turn these people to go out and vote, [but] I think… he may have turned out more voters against [Schimel].”\n\nCharlie Kirk, a pro-Trump social media influencer and activist, implied – without mentioning Musk by name – that his wealth and profile might have played a role.\n\n“We did a lot in Wisconsin but we fell short,” he wrote. “We must realize and appreciate that we are the LOW PROP party now. We are the party of welders, waiters and plumbers. We are the party of people who work with their hands, who shower before and after work.”\n\nNeither Musk nor Trump mentioned the supreme court result in its immediate aftermath, trumpeting instead another Wisconsin ballot result that amended the state constitution to require photo ID as a condition for voting.\n\nThen on Wednesday afternoon, Politico and ABC News reported that Trump told his inner circle, including some Cabinet secretaries, that Musk will soon leave his role as a top adviser to the president, overseeing federal government job cuts. The reports cited anonymous sources familiar with the matter.\n\nMeanwhile, Republicans won victories on Tuesday in two special House elections in Florida caused by the resignations from the US Congress of Matt Gaetz, Trump’s original attorney general designee but who later withdrew amid sexual misconduct allegations, and Mike Waltz, now the national security adviser.\n\nBut the elections were won by margins of around half of what Trump achieved last November. Jimmy Patronis beat Democratic challenger Gay Valimont to win Gaetz’s former seat, while Randy Fine defeated Josh Weil in Florida’s sixth district, once held by Waltz.\n\nThe results bolstered the GOP’s wafer thin House majority to 220-213.\n\nTrump hailed the outcomes, which he attributed to his personal endorsement. “THE TRUMP ENDORSEMENT, AS ALWAYS, PROVED FAR GREATER THAN THE DEMOCRATS FORCES OF EVIL. CONGRATULATIONS TO AMERICA!,” he posted on his Truth Social platform.\n\nBut Jeffries claimed the reduced victory margins augured well for the Democrats in next year’s midterms.\n\n“One point that should have my Republican colleagues quaking in their boots,” he said. “In the Florida sixth race, which was a Trump +30 district, the margin was cut in half. There are 60 Republicans in the House who currently represent districts where Trump did worse than 15 or 16 points.”",

        "content": "There are a few people to blame for the fact that JD Vance, a staggeringly unlikable man with a supremely meme-able face, has been thrust into such prominence. The first is Peter Thiel: the tech billionaire who bankrolled Vance’s political pivot. The second is Kevin D Roberts, head of the Heritage Foundation and mastermind of Project 2025, who has been an energetic Vance advocate.\n\nAnd the third is Usha Chilukuri Vance, JD’s wife. While Usha kept a low profile during the Trump-Vance campaign, trailing after her other half with a smile on her face and a copy of The Iliad in her hand, JD has made her influence clear. In his memoir Hillbilly Elegy, for example, he wrote that Usha helped him navigate Yale and “always encouraged me to seek opportunities that I didn’t know existed”.\n\nUsha has also always sought out opportunities for herself. The 39-year-old has the sort of CV ChatGPT might conjure up if you put “overachiever with political ambitions” as a prompt: Yale, then Cambridge, then back to Yale for law school, where she was an editor of the Yale Law Journal. From there she clerked for high-powered judges including supreme court chief justice John Roberts when he wrote a 5-4 ruling upholding Trump’s so-called Muslim ban.\n\nDespite her own ambitions, Usha left her corporate law job when JD got a shot at DC. “She actually quit her job the day that Donald Trump asked me to become the VP nominee because she wants to be on the road with me,” JD Vance said in an interview last August. “That means we got to win, right? She’s gonna be mad at me if she quit her job and we don’t win.”\n\nThey won all right, but pretty much everyone in the US now thinks JD is a loser. He has historically bad favourability ratings and there are memes of him everywhere. I have absolutely no sympathy for Usha – who is far from a victim – but I have to wonder if she is starting to feel a little sorry for herself. As she and JD wandered around freezing cold Greenland over the weekend, unwelcomed by angry local people who didn’t want to be photographed anywhere near them, did she start to suspect that aligning herself with Trump – a man her own husband once called “America’s Hitler” – might not have been the wisest choice? If not, then perhaps Usha, who has been described as a “bookworm”, needs to put down The Iliad and read the room.\n\nArwa Mahdawi is a Guardian columnist",

        "title": "Study finds strongest evidence yet that shingles vaccine helps cut dementia risk",
        "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/",
        "content": "Researchers who tracked cases of dementia in Welsh adults have uncovered the strongest evidence yet that the shingles vaccination reduces the risk of developing the devastating brain disease.\n\nHealth records of more than 280,000 older adults revealed that those who received a largely discontinued shingles vaccine called Zostavax were 20% less likely to be diagnosed with dementia over the next seven years than those who went without.\n\nPascal Geldsetzer, at Stanford University, said: “For the first time we are able to say much more confidently that the shingles vaccine causes a reduction in dementia risk. If this truly is a causal effect, we have a finding that’s of tremendous importance.”\n\nThe researchers took advantage of a vaccination rollout that took place in Wales more than a decade ago. Public health policy dictated that from 1 September 2013, people born on or after 2 September 1933 became eligible for the Zostavax shot, while those who were older missed out.\n\nThe policy created a natural experiment where the older population was sharply divided into two groups depending on their access to the vaccine. This allowed the researchers to compare dementia rates in older people born weeks apart but on either side of the vaccine eligibility divide.\n\nAfter accounting for the fact that not all those eligible for the vaccine received it, the researchers found vaccination led to a 20% reduction in dementia risk, with the strongest effect in women. Anupam Jena, a professor of healthcare policy at Harvard Medical School, said the implications were profound.\n\nDementia affects more than 55 million people globally and is the leading cause of death in the UK. One in three will develop the condition in their lifetime, and while drugs that slow the disease have recently been approved, there is no cure.\n\nWhen people contract chickenpox the virus remains dormant in their nerve cells for life. But the virus can reactivate and cause shingles in older people whose immune systems are waning, or in individuals with weakened immunity.\n\nThe latest work, published in Nature, is not the first hint that shingles vaccines might shield against dementia. When Zostavax was rolled out in the US in 2006, several studies found lower rates of dementia in people who received the shots. Last year, Oxford researchers reported an even stronger protective effect in people who received Shingrix, a newer vaccine. Geldsetzer is now looking for philanthropic and private foundations to fund a randomised clinical trial to confirm any benefits.\n\nIt is unclear how shingles vaccines might protect against dementia, but one theory is that they reduce inflammation in the nervous system by preventing reactivation of the virus. Another theory is that the vaccines induce broader changes in the immune system that are protective. These wider effects are seen more often in women, potentially explaining the sex differences in the study.\n\nIn an accompanying article, Jena wrote: “Although it is still unclear precisely how herpes zoster vaccination lowers the risk of dementia, the implications of the study are profound. The vaccine could represent a cost-effective intervention that has public-health benefits strongly exceeding its intended purpose.”\n\nJulia Dudley, the head of research at Alzheimer’s Research UK, said the study strengthened the emerging link between shingles vaccination and reduced dementia risk. “While previous studies suggested an association, this research offers stronger evidence of a direct link, with greater benefit observed in women.\n\n“It’s unclear exactly how the shingles vaccine might influence dementia risk. It may reduce inflammation, support the immune system in ways that protect the brain or involve other mechanisms. It’s important to note that this study looked at the Zostavax vaccine rather than Shingrix, which is now more commonly used.\n\n“Understanding this link better, including the reason for any differences between men and women, could open new avenues for dementia prevention and treatment,” she said.\n\nMaxime Taquet, whose Oxford study found a reduced dementia risk after Shingrix vaccination, said adjuvants in that vaccine, which make the immune response more potent, may play a role. Both studies “provide strong support for the hypothesis that shingles vaccination reduces dementia risk, with the newer recombinant vaccine offering superior protection,” he said. “A key question is whether this enhanced protection is due to improved shingles prevention or the adjuvant’s immunological effects.”",

        "content": "Michael Waltz, the embattled national security adviser to Donald Trump, and other members of the national security council have reportedly used personal Gmail accounts to conduct government business.\n\nThe apparent use of Gmail, a relatively insecure method of communication for high-level government officials, places further scrutiny upon Waltz, who is already under pressure after adding a journalist to a group chat on the commercial Signal app, where top US officials then planned and celebrated a US airstrike in Yemen last month.\n\nThe revelations of the Gmail use come from the Washington Post, which said it has reviewed documents and interviewed three unnamed officials about the apparent security lapse.\n\nWaltz had “potentially exploitable information” sent to his Gmail, such as his schedule and other work documents, the Post reported.\n\nOne of Waltz’s aides on the national security council, meanwhile, allegedly used Gmail for more sensitive material, such as discussing military positions and weapons systems with colleagues in other government agencies who used their government-issued accounts.\n\nA spokesperson for the national security council denied to the Post that Waltz had used Gmail improperly. “Waltz didn’t and wouldn’t send classified information on an open account,” the spokesperson said.\n\nThis latest episode, however, risks further damage to the standing of Waltz following the revelation last week that he added Jeffrey Goldberg, editor-in-chief of the Atlantic magazine, to a Signal group chat that involved senior figures such as JD Vance, the US vice-president, and Pete Hegseth, the defense secretary, that discussed details of an airstrike upon the Houthi rebel group in Yemen.\n\nWaltz has said that Goldberg’s number was somehow “sucked in” to his phone, a comment that drew scorn from Goldberg and others. Trump has, however, declined to fire Waltz, instead calling the incident a “glitch”.\n\nPrior to his role as the president’s national security adviser, Waltz was highly critical of Hillary Clinton for her use of a private email server when she was secretary of state.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to This Week in Trumpland Free newsletter A deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administration Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

        "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/",
        "content": "It was Jeopardy!, or The Price Is Right, come to Washington.\n\nOn an unseasonably chilly day in the White House Rose Garden, Donald Trump stood with a giant chart listing which reciprocal tariffs he would impose on China, the European Union, the United Kingdom and other hapless contestants.\n\nThe winner?\n\nTrump, of course, the maestro of fake populism, watched by a crowd that included men in hard hats and fluorescent construction worker vests.\n\nThe losers?\n\nEverybody else.\n\nSensing a bad headline, Trump hadn’t wanted his “liberation day” to coincide with April Fools’ Day, so he waited until 2 April to enter his fool’s paradise. It turned out to be liberation for his decades-old grievances about the US getting ripped off as Trump stuck two fingers up at the world.\n\n“For decades, our country has been looted, pillaged, raped and plundered by nations near and far – both friend and foe alike,” the president said against a backdrop of nine giant US flags on the White House colonnade. “Foreign cheaters have ransacked our factories, and foreign scavengers have torn apart our once beautiful American dream.”\n\nHe nodded to American steelworkers, car-workers, farmers and craftspeople in the audience. These blue-collar workers have been central to Trump’s political rise. Their industrial towns in the midwest and elsewhere were hollowed out by the trade policies of Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton, which sent thousands of jobs abroad where labour was cheaper.\n\nTrump couldn’t quite bring himself to say that “liberation day” represents a final repudiation of Reagan, still a god in Republican circles. But he did drive a stake through the heart of the 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement, or Nafta, describing it as “the worst trade deal ever made”.\n\nIn 2016’s great revolt against globalization, the forgotten workers could have voted for the leftwing populism of Bernie Sanders, but he lost the Democratic party nomination to Hillary Clinton.\n\nInstead, enough went for Trump to make him president, believing his promises that he alone could fix it, end American carnage and get the factories throbbing again. As it turned out, he delivered a $1.5tn bill that slashed taxes for corporations and the wealthy.\n\nMany workers duly switched back to the Democrats, with Joe Biden in 2020. He did pour money into manufacturing – for example, with the Chips and Science Act, a bipartisan bill investing $52bn to revitalize the semiconductor industry.\n\nYet in 2024 the pendulum swung again.\n\nSomehow a Manhattan billionaire with a criminal record again persuaded blue-collar workers that he was on their side. He claimed he could wave tariffs (taxes on foreign imports), which he has described as the most beautiful word in the English language, like a magic wand.\n\nIn reality, experts say, it will result in higher prices and slower growth. The Ontario premier Doug Ford called this not liberation day but termination day because of all the jobs that will be lost. Trump playing with tariffs is like a child playing with matches.\n\nAs he prepared to sign an executive order imposing reciprocal tariffs on about 60 countries, he mused that it was payback time: “Reciprocal: that means they do it to us and we do it to them. Very simple. Can’t get any simpler than that. This is one of the most important days, in my opinion, in American history. It’s our declaration of economic independence.”\n\nIt was a strange message to hear from the leader of the wealthiest, most powerful country in the world as he slapped tariffs on the likes of Ethiopia, Haiti and Lesotho.\n\n“For years, hardworking American citizens were forced to sit on the sidelines as other nations got rich and powerful, much of it at our expense. But now it’s our turn to prosper … Today we’re standing up for the American worker and we are finally putting America first,” he said.\n\nView image in fullscreen Trump in the White House Rose Garden. Photograph: Carlos Barría/Reuters\n\nEven then, Trump claimed he was being kind by not going “full reciprocal”. He summoned his commerce secretary, Howard Lutnick, to bring the chart to the podium and, as if it were a gameshow, began running through the scores on the doors:\n\n“China, first row. China, 67%. That’s tariffs charged to the USA, including currency manipulation and trade barriers. So 67%, so we’re going to be charging a discounted reciprocal tariff of 34%. I think in other words, they charge us, we charge them, we charge them less. So how can anybody be upset?\n\n“European Union, they’re very tough – very, very tough traders. You know, you think of the European Union, very friendly. They rip us off. It’s so sad to say, it’s so pathetic. Thirty-nine percent. We’re going to charge them 20%, so we’re charging them essentially half.\n\n“Vietnam: great negotiators, great people, they like me. I like them. The problem is they charge us 90%. We’re going to charge them 46% tariff.”\n\nAnd so on to Taiwan, Japan (“very, very tough, great people”), Switzerland, Indonesia, Malaysia and Cambodia: “United Kingdom, 10%, and we’ll go 10%, so we’ll do the same thing.”\n\nOnce he’d gone through the figures, Trump rambled, as he tends to do, as if at a campaign rally: “The price of eggs dropped now 59%, and they’re going down more, and the availability is fantastic. They were saying that for Easter, please don’t use eggs. Could you use plastic eggs? I said, we don’t want to do that.”\n\nAnd: “It’s such an old-fashioned term but a beautiful term: groceries. It sort of says a bag with different things in it. Groceries went through the roof and I campaigned on that. I talked about the word ‘groceries’ for a lot, and energy costs now are down. Groceries are down.”\n\nIn other words, everything is going great despite Signalgate, despite disappointing election results on Tuesday, despite a falling stock market and sapping consumer confidence. Now, a global trade war, too. The US is about to discover the one thing more dangerous than a politician who believes in nothing is a politician who believes in something stupid.",

        "content": "In February, I taught memoir writing at a conference in Mexico where the faculty is traditionally put up with local hosts. Mine was especially communicative in the months leading up to my arrival, going out of his way to indicate affordable rooftop bars, the finest locations to view murals, and general best practices for the city he’d adopted as his own.\n\nSo when I told my host that I have chronic insomnia, I felt he’d take me seriously, given how generous he’d been in his emails. “I’ve traveled a lot throughout Mexico,” I wrote him. “And the one thing I can’t deal with as an insomniac is roosters.”\n\nThere was a rooster in the vicinity, my host admitted, but it was way off in the distance and shouldn’t be a problem; his home had thick walls and was well insulated against noise.\n\nColor me surprised when I arrived, a few hours shy of midnight, to the news that the rooster had recently relocated to the tree outside the guest bedroom where I’d be staying for the week. “He starts crowing at 4am,” my host explained, “and he just keeps on going.”\n\n“He’s lucky we’re vegetarians!” joked a visiting friend of his.\n\nI went to bed disheartened and prematurely anxious. In addition to teaching a full load of courses, I had a novel under consideration at several publishing houses, so my week was jammed with high-stakes editorial calls. I can barely sleep with someone breathing next to me, so there wasn’t a chance in hell I’d be able to sleep through a rooster crowing outside my window.\n\nAfter a sleepless night, I fled the coop on day two, relocating to a poultry-free hotel nearby, which made me feel guilty – the host had been so kind. I was also frustrated, knowing he probably thought I was exaggerating, using the word “insomniac” to stand in for “sensitive”.\n\nWhen I tell people that I have immense trouble with sleep, what they hear is that I’m difficult, neurotic, a diva with control issues. For nearly 40 years, every doctor I’ve pleaded with has announced that the problem is in my head. That I need to relax, take hot baths, do a lot of yoga. Or, you know, go back and be born a man, because ladies are high-strung.\n\nBut last year, at 45, I finally found a doctor who listened to my conviction that there was a physical root to my ailment.\n\nThis is the story of how I got through his office door.\n\nAs anyone trying to get through the day after a sleepless night will know, mental health is strongly linked to sleep satisfaction – and Americans are doing poorly in both of these departments.\n\nA 2023 poll by the National Sleep Foundation found that “one in four adults who were dissatisfied with their sleep also met probable criteria for a depression diagnosis,” with women and the elderly suffering from insomnia, depression and a reliance on sleeping aids more than any other demographic. Last year, a fresh survey by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine announced that 12% of Americans had been diagnosed with chronic insomnia, the very condition I’m up against.\n\nThe message that I was overly sensitive, persistently hormonal and ‘keyed up’ was drilled into me so many times by doctors of both genders\n\nMy struggles with disordered sleeping started far younger than the national average. By age nine, I had entered the pattern I’m currently entrenched in – I could fall asleep but couldn’t stay asleep, usually waking up at about 4.30am, exhausted and disgruntled, unable to lure the sandman back.\n\nI don’t think I knew the word “insomnia” at the time, but I knew something had shifted inside me for the worse. My home life was in shambles – my younger brother was suffering frequent, terrifying seizures and the stress of his undiagnosed illness was crumbling my parents’ already fractured marriage. When I complained to my mother about my sleep troubles, she gave me a “join the club” look. She brought home a pack of Sleepytime tea, but it only made me jealous of the narcoleptic brown bear on the packaging who could fall asleep wherever: in a lounger, in a hammock, in a field of chamomile.\n\nThe tea was the extent of my mother’s efforts to “deal” with my insomnia. My father doesn’t do emotions, so I stored up my complaints for the doctors I saw annually, giddy with the knowledge that they’d know how to “fix” me. My pediatrician, my dentist, the gynecologist I started seeing as a teen, even the health counselor the school sent in for sexual education – I told everyone in a lab coat that I was unable to stay asleep at night, that I was developing debilitating canker sores from sleep loss, that I didn’t understand why I couldn’t stay asleep like my healthy friends.\n\n“It’s because of hormones,” was the common answer. “We see this in good students,” was another observation. “You should play more sports.” Then there was the MVP of answers: “It’s just a woman thing.”\n\nThe message that I was overly sensitive, persistently hormonal and “keyed up” was drilled into me so many times by doctors of both genders, I eventually turned my disorder into a point of pride. Throughout my youth and well into my 20s, I hid my broken mental health by presenting a sharp and willing mind to my employers, colleagues, friends. By day as a copywriter, I was known as a fixer, someone who could deliver website copy for a luxury hotel chain on a moment’s notice. At night, I went into author mode – someone able to brightly chat about her latest novel at book signings even though she felt costumed in the body of someone no longer alive.\n\nWhen I added “mother” to my growing list of responsibilities, the train went off the rails. By the time my daughter turned two, I stopped sleeping completely – even sedatives couldn’t turn off the neon light constantly buzzing in my head. I started shedding weight, developed irritable bowel syndrome, and was too out of it to drive. The canker sores that had always plagued me turned into mouth ulcers so painful I couldn’t speak or eat.\n\nMost pointedly, I couldn’t “show up” and “power through” professionally as I’d been doing for so long. I missed the deadline for my second novel. There were mistakes in all my emails. Squiggles in my sight path. I was hearing voices, seeing things in corners. I’d always been told that my brain was the problem – that I alone was responsible for my inability to sleep. Therefore, I had to eradicate the problem. I started to fantasize about driving off the road in my rural, wooded town. Straight into a tree.\n\nMy husband put his foot down. Neither he nor my daughter could continue living with the human shell I had become. Either I got myself into therapy, or we talked divorce.\n\nCue a montage of fresh intentions. I found a talented therapist and a psychiatrist generous with her scripts. I started anti-depression medication and was prescribed an entire pharmacy aisle of sleeping pills. I went to a nutritionist, dropping a small fortune on new-agey supplements including valerian root and lion’s mane. I started acupuncture, hypnosis, reiki, and I took a lot of baths. I gave up coffee and tried to exercise more even though I was so sleepy, I didn’t register my limbs moving until they already had. I drank less alcohol; I ate my weight in food.\n\nI also did the sleep hygiene thing, becoming even more rigid around the act of sleeping, which frankly made things worse. I bought expensive sheets. I bought expensive pillows. I enrolled in two sleep clinics to test for sleep apnea; I failed both so was denied the CPap machine that I thought might help me rest.\n\nThese efforts – laborious, expensive – lasted nearly 15 years. And then, at 45, a new development occurred: I started snoring so loudly that my husband decamped to the guest room. How could I be snoring if I was barely sleeping?\n\nAfter nasal strips failed to quell my honking, I posted to Facebook for snoring solutions, and a friend suggested that I see an an ear, nose and throat (ENT) doctor. Doctors and acquaintances have recommended everything under the sun – including the sun itself – for my insomnia, but no one had ever recommended this specific specialty, so I drove to the ENT Institute of Connecticut with something close to hope.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Well Actually Free weekly newsletter Practical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good life Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Here we go again, I thought, slumping in my chair. “I had braces, yeah. Early, like age nine.” I held on to the information that this is also when my insomnia started and my family fell apart. If I admitted that, the consult would end like all the others – the problem was my brain, the problem was my gender; I needed to chill out.\n\n“You have an anterior nasal valve collapse and upper airway resistance syndrome,” the doctor said instead, holding up a laminated poster of different mouth and throat types. “When you got braces, your jaw wasn’t done growing. Your tongue kept growing, but your jaw’s growth was stunted and now you can’t breathe properly, especially at night where you’re basically choked by your own tongue. This isn’t a mental thing; you have a real, physical problem. You haven’t been breathing properly for over 30 years and no CPap is gonna fix that. I’m recommending you for surgery.”\n\nI cried when I got to my car, but not out of relief. After decades of medical gaslighting, hearing that my problems weren’t invented didn’t feel liberating or validating. I felt robbed of time.\n\nI mourned the years where I could have been more comfortable, happier, healthier and rested; a better writer, better mother, a better friend and human. All those doctors, for all those years, declaring that my canker sores were unfixable and linked only to my menses? In the space of five minutes, my doctor had explained it all: my mouth wasn’t able to properly sanitize itself because I couldn’t breathe right. He also explained why my face turned beet red when I did the slightest amount of exercise (a tendency I’d been bullied for as a middle schooler): I wasn’t getting the oxygen I needed to run around the gym.\n\nAll you really want is for doctors to say, hey, let’s drop everything and help this person out. But most of the time, you can’t even get anyone to return your calls Lara Prescott\n\nI got braces in the 1980s when American orthodontics was excessively focused on cosmetics. Today, there’s more awareness around orthodontics and otorhinolaryngology, countless articles, some podcasts; there’s even a 2024 documentary called Open Wide that explores the teenage rite of passage that is – or was – getting braces young. Accordingly, when the New Hampshire-based writer Sarah Canney was told by a dentist that her eight-year-old son’s overcrowded mouth, constant migraines and sleep troubles would be remedied by orthodontics, she had a tool that wasn’t available to my family: the World Wide Web.\n\n“There’s an unseen trickle-down effect of doing so much to a young mouth,” explains Canney, who researched extensively to find a doctor who wouldn’t force tooth extraction on her child’s overcrowded mouth, because she’d learned this practice can detrimentally affect mouth size, causing considerable problems as the patient ages. She says she went into that first appointment with her guard up, ready to protect and advocate her son, but she didn’t have to. The practice Canney chose takes a holistic approach to dentistry, looking at neck curvature and body alignment before anything else. Canney’s son is in phase two of what is looking like a successful orthodontic program, where the patient’s quality of life is prioritized over having perfect teeth.\n\nThe poet Christina Stoddard is the person who originally told me to see an ENT in the comments of my Facebook post, because she was saved from debilitating sleep issues by an ENT herself. For years, Stoddard was getting the recommended amount of sleep but was waking feeling like she hadn’t slept at all. Given that her father has sleep apnea, she was certain she’d leave her ENT appointment with a prescription for a CPap – a continuous positive airway pressure machine that uses a combination of water and suction to help its user breathe. Instead, Stoddard was recommended for five different surgeries to correct nasal and laryngeal issues that were affecting her ability to breathe correctly, especially lying down.\n\nStoddard underwent the recommended operations, and though the recovery was gnarly, within a month she said the results were transformative. “I didn’t know what I’d been missing,” she told me on the phone. “I went to sleep. I stayed asleep. I woke up in the morning feeling like I wanted to belt out a Broadway song.”\n\nI had three surgeries for my own breathing issues: a nasal valve repair, a septoplasty and a turbinate reduction, all of which I underwent in May of 2024. Unfortunately, the cartilage graft inserted to prop my nostrils open didn’t take on one side of my nose, so in November of 2024, I went under the knife again for revision surgery.\n\nA lot of things have improved for me since my second operation. The headaches that used to plague my waking hours have completely dissipated, and my canker sores have gone from being a daily burden to a monthly one. My face no longer turns bright red when I exercise and I feel generally calmer, happier and more poised. For months after the second surgery, I was sleeping better than I have in decades, but at the time of writing, I’m experiencing a relapse: I haven’t slept more than four hours a night for three weeks.\n\nThough I’ve finally identified and treated the physical cause of my sleep issues, I now have to go back and course correct my mind. After researching the benefits of cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (shorthand, CBT-I), I was given a list of local providers by my therapist, but I’m having a hard time finding a human being to treat me, given that most programs are online and self-paced.\n\nThe novelist Lara Prescott is currently enrolled in such a program, the Harvard-designed Stellar Sleep mobile app. Having tried every solution in the book for her lifelong insomnia, she’s skeptical that CBT-I will provide the life-changing breakthrough that she’s desperate for.\n\n“Right now, I’m in a really cranky I-don’t-want-to-do-this mode,” Prescott admits. “Insomnia is such a lonely condition. You’re up and you’re so lonely and you can’t get back to sleep, and all you really want is for doctors to say, hey, let’s drop everything and help this person out. But most of the time, you can’t even get anyone to return your calls.”\n\nWhile I wait for human CBT-I practitioners to return my own phone calls, I’m trying out new rituals to regulate my circadian rhythm and establish healthier thought patterns around my sleep performance. First thing every morning and last thing every night, I go outside and take in the sights, the sounds, the light. I’m supposed to do this for 20 minutes a sitting. (I don’t.) But even with modest time I give to outdoor meditation, I can see and feel the benefits of choosing to rise and set with the sun and moon, instead of my phone’s screen. I ordered a demonic acupressure mat that I endure nightly while listening to Ayla Nova yoga nidra podcasts. I’m slowly trying to replace my Ambien and Trazodone with edibles and tinctures, but I’m not quite off the pharmaceutical sauce.\n\nUntil a full night’s rest comes to me (which won’t be for a while, thanks to perimenopause), I find relief in connecting with people who understand that insomnia is not a grievance made by difficult, whiny women but rather a life-threatening condition that frequently stems from a physical issue many doctors refuse to see.\n\nMy complications were identified later in life than I’m comfortable with, but better late than dead. If you’re reading this as a fellow insomniac, I hope you find someone who hears and sees you, too.",

        "content": "The Friends actor David Schwimmer spent years unable to listen to the theme tune of his smash-hit comedy, he revealed yesterday. According to the star, he was forced to hear it so many times at the height of his fame that the mere sound of it made him feel miserable.\n\n“I’ll be really honest, there was a time for quite a while that just hearing the theme song would really … uggh,” he said during an appearance on Matt Lucas and David Walliams’ Making a Scene podcast.\n\n“You know what I mean? I just had that reaction. I just had heard it so many times. Any time you’d go on a show or a talkshow or an interview, that would be your intro song. So I just didn’t have the greatest response to it.”\n\nThe star’s dislike of The Rembrandts’ I’ll Be There for You came during a period of his life when he also struggled with the level of fame he earned from playing Ross Geller. According to the actor, he can date the last time he was able to inconspicuously appear in public to 1994.\n\n“Jim Burrows [the director] took the cast to Vegas … this was before we were on the air or anything. We were walking through the casino at one point, and he said to us, remember this moment, it’s the last time you’re going to be able to walk through a casino like this – basically, with total anonymity.”\n\nFor Schwimmer, this was far from a welcome development. “The moment that I realised Jim Burrows was right, I was at LAX … trying to catch a flight. I’m not one of those actors that has an entourage with me. It’s me, that’s it. I just go solo,” he said.\n\n“So, I’m going through … I hear a blood-curdling scream. I was genuinely frightened. I thought someone was being stabbed or something. And a group of girls come and like – like literally just scream and grab me. And they won’t let me go … I mean, it was terrifying.\n\n“It took me a long time to get adjusted to that kind of fame. You had three cars following you everywhere you went, staked outside your house. You had absolutely no privacy ever.”\n\nThe star’s fondness for his Friends career has, however, improved in recent years – largely thanks to his daughter.\n\n“I never watched the show after we finished it. For me, it’s like: ‘I did it. I’m moving on.’ Then my kid discovered it around age nine or something, and started watching it. And I’d be making breakfast or whatever, and I’d hear my kid’s laughter. My whole relationship to that song and to the show changed again.”",

        "title": "‘Liberation day’: what are tariffs and why do they matter?",
        "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/",
        "content": "Donald Trump has said “tariffs” is the most beautiful word in the dictionary.\n\nThe US president is expected to announce his latest round of these border taxes on Wednesday at 4pm ET (9pm BST). In what he is calling “liberation day”, Trump has argued the step is needed to raise money and to encourage domestic manufacturing. But it is also rattling the global economy.\n\nWhat is a tariff? Tariffs are border taxes charged on the import of goods from foreign countries. Importers pay them upon entry to the customs agency of the country or bloc that levies them. The taxes are typically charged as a percentage of a product’s value. For example, a tariff of 10% on a £100 product would carry a £10 charge at the point it is brought into the country. As well as finished goods, tariffs are levied on components and raw materials, pushing up the costs to manufacturers significantly; particularly in a world of complex supply chains where borders are crossed many times. According to the Center for Strategic and International Studies, parts such as engines, transmissions, and other car components can cross the US-Canada and US-Mexico borders up to seven or eight times. Serving as a barrier to trade, tariffs raise the price of an imported product for businesses and consumers. The US bank JP Morgan has estimated that tariffs of 25% would raise new car prices by $4,000 (£3,092). They provide an incentive to buy a domestic tariff-free equivalent, where possible. Countries can also use non-tariff barriers to trade; including import quotas, licences and permits, regulations, safety standards and border checks. The introduction of tariffs by one country can often collapse into a cycle of retaliation, or even a full-blown trade war. They are often used alongside other policy tools as a means of negotiation between nations, influencing far more than just economic outcomes.\n\nWhat is Trump’s strategy? The US is the largest goods importer in the world – buying products worth $3tn in 2023. It also has the largest trade in goods deficit – when imports exceed exports – worth $1tn. Trump has long complained the deficit reflects “unfair” practices from US trading partners, and sees it as a sign of weakness in the US economy after decades of factory production shifting overseas. He has used them as a negotiation tool to extract concessions from US trading partners. Perceived unfair duties graphic The president is also considering the potential revenue tariffs could raise for the federal budget, which would be important to offset the impact of his tax-cutting proposals. However, both cannot be true. To reliably raise revenue, a tariff would need to be permanent, rather than used as a bargaining chip. .\n\nWhat could the impact be? Additional costs from tariffs are typically borne by the end consumer, meaning Trump’s plans are likely to push up US living costs. The big fear is that throwing grit in the wheels of trade will knock global economic growth and stoke inflation. Even before the introduction of new US tariffs, the threat of them has rattled global financial markets and dented business and consumer confidence. This has a chilling impact on household spending and business investment. Borrowing costs have risen sharply for governments around the world. For nations with already high levels of debt after the succession of shocks since the 2008 financial crisis, this has added to the pressure to balance the books, and prompted political challenges. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) warned last month that in a scenario in which tariff rates are permanently raised by the US and all of its trading partners by an additional 10 percentage points, global output could fall by about 0.3% by the third year after their introduction. Global inflation could rise by 0.4 percentage points per annum on average over the first three years, the OECD said. Growth graphic\n\nIs this a new tactic? Trade barriers, taxes and tariffs have been a feature of the world economy for centuries, including as a catalyst for wars and revolutions, such as the Boston tea party and the second world war. The barriers have been steadily dismantled over recent decades, amid the rise of globalisation. Trump – who also imposed tariffs in his first term as president – is not the first US president to shock the UK on trade. Most economists agree trade liberalisation has helped to lift more than a billion people out of poverty worldwide, while supporting living standards in rich countries. But there are also tensions; from the hollowing out of manufacturing, to environmental and social challenges associated with complex, resource intensive, and sometimes exploitative global supply chains.",

        "content": "A ramped-up US bombing campaign on Yemen has killed civilians and brought further destruction and uncertainty to the poorest country in the Middle East, compounding an already dire situation after Donald Trump cut aid, according to local people, humanitarian workers and rights groups.\n\n“Now the rampant bombing has started, you never know which way things will go,” said Siddiq Khan, who works as a country director in Yemen for the aid charity Islamic Relief.\n\nFor more than two weeks, US airstrikes have hit the Gulf country, targeting the anti-western Houthi movement, which controls most of the war-torn country. “Hell will rain down upon you like nothing you have ever seen before,” the US president said after launching initial strikes, the first such use of US military might in the region since he retook power in January.\n\nThe bombings aim to punish the Houthis for their attacks on commercial cargo traffic in Red Sea shipping lines, which the militants say are a response to Israel’s killings in Gaza.\n\nDetails about Trump’s military campaign were exposed in public last week when a journalist was accidentally added to a private group chat with senior US officials in which they boasted about the initial operations.\n\nThe US national security adviser, Mike Waltz, wrote in the Signal app group that the Houthis’ “top missile guy” had been killed after walking into his “girlfriend’s building”. He provided no information on whether the woman was also killed, or any mention of efforts to mitigate civilian harm. JD Vance, the vice-president, responded by saying “excellent”, and Waltz replied later with emojis of a clenched fist, a US flag and a blazing flame.\n\nStrikes have targeted Sana’a, Yemen’s capital, as well as the port city of Hodeidah and the Houthi stronghold of Sa’ada. The targets include densely populated areas, but assessing the impact on civilians of the strikes – which are coordinated with and supported by UK armed forces – is difficult.\n\nNiku Jafarnia, a Yemen researcher at Human Rights Watch, said the Houthis had blocked off “any and all access” to bomb sites and hospitals as part of a crackdown on civil society and the media. But she added: “There is no question there are civilian casualties. Residential areas are being hit in the middle of the night, which is a sure-fire way to kill civilians.”\n\nThe Houthi-run Saba news agency has said the US has twice bombed a cancer hospital in the country’s north and accused the US of “full-fledged war crimes by targeting civilians and civilian objects, resulting in dozens of deaths and injuries in several governorates”. Independent groups have also suggested a high degree of civilian harm.\n\nIn a post on X, the Yemen Data Project, which monitors attacks in the country, said that the first week of attacks had killed at least 25 civilians, including four children. About half of the strikes had hit civilian sites, including a school, a wedding hall, residential areas and Bedouin tents, it said.\n\nThe group added: “The very first US strike in Yemen under the new Trump administration, carried out on the evening of 15 March (and the subject of that Signal group chat), hit al-Jaraf in the north of the capital, killing at least 13 civilians and injuring nine.”\n\nView image in fullscreen The US aerial attacks on 20 March 2025 brought further destruction to Sana’a. Photograph: Mohammed Hamoud/Getty Images\n\nAnother monitoring group, Airwars, which tracks and analyses open-source information, has documented women and children being killed and injured. The UN says it has verified that at least two boys, aged six and eight, were killed in strikes in northern Sa’ada, with a third missing.\n\nPhotos of the aftermath show destroyed residential buildings, with water tanks and shredded clothes within the rubble. A​ US defence official said “battle damage assessments” were being conducted and “do not indicate civilian casualties”​. They added​: “We likely won’t have any updates until after the conclusion of operations.”\n\nA decade of violence has shattered Yemen’s already weak economy and left millions of people unable to find decent livelihoods to support their families. As a result, out of a population of roughly 36 million, about 19 million people require aid – 15 million of whom are women and children. Half of all children under five in Yemen are malnourished, according to Unicef. An aid plan for 2025 is only 6.5% funded so far.\n\nKhan, from Islamic Relief, said the recent bombings were adding pressure on to an aid sector that was already collapsing under other Trump measures. Two of the biggest factors have been the huge cuts to USAid and the designation of the Houthis as a “foreign terrorist organisation”, which puts aid groups working in the vast Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen at legal risk in the US.\n\nHumanitarian organisations are now scrambling to work out how to operate in the country without being in breach of US law and with much less funding, all in addition to an intense bombing campaign.\n\n“Overall, there has been a gradual but then sharp kind of decline in humanitarian aid to Yemen,” he said. “Obviously, many organisations are kind of downsizing and some have closed as well.\n\n“The bombings have further scared the organisations here about whether this will be the right place to stay and work. So overall, there’s a huge vacuum … taking over the humanitarian sector here,” he added. “I see a real catastrophe coming Yemen’s way.”\n\nAnother aid worker, who asked to remain anonymous, said their staff were “dealing with really, so many things at the same time, which is compounding our ability to access people right now”.\n\nThe Houthis, which are backed by Iran, have already restricted access and detained aid workers over the past year, creating a climate of fear among the aid community.\n\n“So all of this really impacts the way our staff feel comfortable and safe to provide services to the communities,” said the aid worker. “Yet at the same time, they are very determined to provide as many services as possible to the communities.”\n\nWashington is one of several belligerent actors in Yemen, which has suffered a decade of civil war, with several states, including neighbouring Saudi Arabia, conducting bombing campaigns.\n\nThe effectiveness of strikes on the Houthis, without troops on the ground, has been repeatedly questioned as the group has already managed to survive years of attacks.",

        "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/",
        "content": "It would be “liberation day” in the US, the White House announced. Well, we shall see. Yet even if one puts the noise and nastiness that accompany a Donald Trump announcement to one side – in this case tonight’s pronouncement that there will be an executive order announcing “reciprocal tariffs on countries throughout the world”, a 10% tariff on the UK and 20% on the EU – the significance of the theatre is hard to miss. Whether they presage the US’s liberation, or instead the disintegration of the global trading order, Trump’s tariffs add up to an attempt to transform a badly broken economic model. And that is something that affects us all.\n\nTrump’s announcement was awash with insult and rambling nonsense. The rest of the world had looted, raped and pillaged, had scavenged and ransacked America – shocking claims if they had come from any other US president, yet water off a duck’s back today. But the hard core was there all the same: tariffs on the whole of the rest of the world. The shutters were up.\n\nThis threatened trade war will appear to supporters – of whom there were rather fewer this week in some important US electoral contests – exactly like the Maga big bazooka he promised in his inaugural speech in January. “Instead of taxing our citizens to enrich other countries, we will tariff and tax foreign countries to enrich our citizens,” he said back then. The new tariffs turn those words into realities.\n\nEven to Trump’s opponents, though, the tariffs should be seen as the most important piece of evidence so far that he has American workers on his agenda. Where Joe Biden tried major tax, borrow and spend programmes to combat post-Covid economic precarity, Trump is deploying tariffs, ostensibly to the same purpose. There has been speculation that this will be merely tactical, to be quickly lifted or adjusted. Right now, that looks a long way off. For Trump, tariffs are not so much a negotiating tactic as a policy, a new revenue stream and a “made in the USA” commitment.\n\nBefore the announcement, markets and foreign governments were jittery. But the uncertainties have not disappeared. Listening to Keir Starmer continue to advocate a “calm pragmatic approach” does not disguise the fact that he knows, as we do, that Trump’s approach is the exact reverse. We are in a trade war now, whether we like it or not, and Trump, as the leader of the strongest economy in the world, likes it a lot because he thinks the US will win.\n\nThings may not look so benign, however, when the rubber hits the road. It is inevitable that enthusiasm will be dulled – either among the public or in markets – when the inevitable price hikes are passed on to consumers, when inflation and the cost of mortgages begin to rise, when real wages remain flat, or when investment stalls and the US economy starts to experience a Trump slump.\n\nAll this, though, is speculation about the future, and a lot of it is for the fairly long-term future at that. It takes time for the real economic effects to be felt from a tariff wall of the kind Trump is planning. It is true that the tariffs have to be charged immediately, and that retaliatory tariffs are likely to kick in fast too. Nevertheless it will be months, if not years, before many US companies or sectors have the confidence and the cash to invest in the way “fortress America” supporters hope. Longer still, maybe, before US car workers or farmers feel truly confident about paying down their debts and spending again.\n\nIt makes perfect sense, therefore, to emphasise the uncertainties that Trump has just unleashed. All the more so because of the man himself, as well as the policy. It is hard not to feel, yet again, that part of what drove Trump’s decision was the sheer thrill he gets from his power. He glories in the way the world hangs on his every move, as the world must when its largest economy is controlled by a grudge-bearing manchild with guns who governs by decree.\n\nYet step back a little and it is also apparent that Trump is acting more logically than that. He is acting, albeit in a wilful and perverse manner, because the international economic model has been broken. He is responding to something real, namely a global recession that stems most immediately from the combined impact of the banking crisis of 2008-9 and the Covid pandemic of 2020. This was not something fake or imagined. Nor was it – or is it still – something felt in the US alone, but elsewhere, certainly including Europe and Britain.\n\nThe common root of today’s economic burden was the overload of debt and credit that caused the banking crash of 2008. That crash was principally confronted by spending massive amounts of public money on quantitative easing. But, just as before the crash, this was money based on credit more than on production or goods. This triggered attempts to square the circle – tax cuts in the US, austerity in Britain, pension cuts in France – which in turn provoked so-called populist responses, such as Trump’s election win in 2016, Brexit in the UK, the gilets jaunes in France. But before any of these national responses could resolve, Covid arrived, causing recessions all round, stock-market collapses and a rise in inflation.\n\nFaced with these continuing problems, Trump’s response takes the form of tariffs. It is very uncertain whether they will work, even for the US itself. They may also trigger recessions, and the resultant tax and spend policy dilemmas elsewhere, in places such as the EU, Britain, Canada and Japan. In addition, they are likely to widen the gulf between the US and its postwar allies. While Trump talks of liberation, Germany’s new chancellor, Friedrich Merz, talks of “independence from the USA”.\n\nIn his tariffs, Trump is clutching at straws. He may divert the US’s tariff income into orthodox neoliberal tax cuts for corporations and the rich, like him. But his approach can also be seen as an illustration of the limited strategic options that today’s democratic political leaders have at their command when faced with economic recession or, worse, depression.\n\nIn a recent article in the London Review of Books, Perry Anderson has drawn an illuminating historical contrast with the post-depression 1930s. In the early 1930s, he writes, governments also followed economic orthodoxy with disastrous consequences. Back then, their failure forced the public works programmes of the New Deal (and of the Nazis) and then, after emerging from the abyss of war, the postwar establishment of Keynesianism. John Maynard Keynes himself, it is worth noting, was no dogmatic free-trader and was sometimes an advocate of tariffs.\n\nIn the 2020s, governments face a comparable dilemma. They, too, have been constrained by an economic orthodoxy that is increasingly difficult to sustain. They, too, have occasionally been forced into interventionist measures such as the Covid furlough scheme.\n\nBut beyond that? Trump is no New Dealer; he is the New Deal’s sworn enemy. At least he sees the need to do things differently. But his tariffs are the opposite to the new paradigm of political economy that the democratic capitalist world so obviously and urgently craves.",

        "content": "An 11-year-old girl was restrained, injected with anti-psychotic drugs and placed on a mental health ward after New Zealand police mistook her for a missing woman, a report found on Wednesday.\n\nHealth officials and police have scrambled to explain the mix-up, which has appalled political leaders and stoked outrage across the country.\n\nThe girl – who displayed “limited verbal ability” – was crossing a bridge in northern Hamilton city when a passing police car mistakenly identified her as a missing 20-year-old female hospital patient, the review said.\n\nPolice drove the girl to hospital, where she was admitted to an “intensive psychiatric care unit” despite one nurse suggesting she “resembled a child”.\n\n“Patient A lives with a disability that means she was not able to tell people about herself,” said a review by the Ministry of Health, referring to the girl.\n\nAfter refusing to take drugs offered by staff, the girl was restrained and injected with anti-psychotic medication that is “rarely administered to children”.\n\n“Staff were working on the assumption that they were administering medication to an adult, not a child,” read the damning review of the 9 March incident.\n\nThe girl spent more than 12 hours in hospital until police realised their mistake and called her family to pick her up.\n\n“I just wish to start by apologising to this young person and her family for the trauma and distress that was caused,” said Richard Sullivan, a senior health official.\n\n“This report is a frank read. But it is necessary to make sure this doesn’t happen again.”\n\nThe New Zealand prime minister, Christopher Luxon, launched an investigation last week when the incident came to light.\n\n“That is incredibly distressing and incredibly concerning,” he said.\n\n“As a parent you identify with what is a horrific set of circumstances. I have massive amounts of empathy for her and her family.”",

Arne Slot’s side cleansed themselves of recent torment against Everton and two deflating cup defeats with a hard-fought but deserved victory courtesy of Diogo Jota’s fine individual goal. A maximum of 13 points is all that is required from the remaining eight games of the season to put the Premier League trophy on display at Anfield once again. There was a determination to seize control of the derby from the start by Liverpool and, unlike the previous two encounters at Goodison Park, a composure in possession that enabled them to do so. The painful Champions League exit and deserved Carabao Cup final defeat that preceded the international break, plus of course memories of their last run-in with Everton 49 days ago, may also have fuelled the hunger and intensity of a team closing in on the Premier League title.

Howe’s team were not at their very best but, thanks to the most eye-catching of winning goals from Sandro Tonali they found a way to defuse Brentford’s ever-present threat. While defeat was arguably a little harsh on Thomas Frank’s side, it lifted Newcastle to fifth, one point ahead of Chelsea who host Tottenham on Thursday night.

Pep Guardiola adores the Champions League so this was business accomplished in the bid to seal a qualification berth: victory lifts City to fourth. Jack Grealish opened proceedings but a scan of his numbers showed his early strike to be only a third goal in what goes down as a lost season on the CV.

This season I’ve not been at my best, but even when I’ve played, especially in 2025 I’ve only started three or four games … I was happy that I started tonight and happy to score. I was a little bit relieved. I know myself that I could score more but I know I give a lot more than just scoring. I don’t think I was brought here to score 20 goals a season.

Manchester City 2-0 Leicester (Marmoush, 29 mins) Defensive calamity for Leicester: the ball is chipped into the area, Hermansen comes for it but Faes runs across, and possibly actually into, him as he prepares to gather and the ball breaks to Marmoush, who needs only to roll the ball into an empty net. He doesn’t, mind – he lashes it into the roof of the net for added artistic merit. View image in fullscreen Omar Marmoush grabs the second goal for a dominant City.

The ball is close to Tarkowski and I don’t think he has to throw himself at it at all, but he flies in, clears the ball and clatters violently into the Argentinian. Somehow VAR decides not to get involved and he ends up with just a yellow card. Share\n\n6h ago 15.09 EDT GOAL! Southampton 1-0 Crystal Palace (Onuachu, 20 mins) Southampton are winning a game of football! It’s a decent cross from the right and a good header from Paul Onuachu, from maybe 15 yards or so. I’m not entirely sure how it ends up in the net, though: the ball is low and reasonably powerful but nowhere near the corner, and while Henderson gets a good hand to it he somehow manages only to send it squirming slowly over the line.

        "content": "There are a few people to blame for the fact that JD Vance, a staggeringly unlikable man with a supremely meme-able face, has been thrust into such prominence. The first is Peter Thiel: the tech billionaire who bankrolled Vance’s political pivot. The second is Kevin D Roberts, head of the Heritage Foundation and mastermind of Project 2025, who has been an energetic Vance advocate.\n\nAnd the third is Usha Chilukuri Vance, JD’s wife. While Usha kept a low profile during the Trump-Vance campaign, trailing after her other half with a smile on her face and a copy of The Iliad in her hand, JD has made her influence clear. In his memoir Hillbilly Elegy, for example, he wrote that Usha helped him navigate Yale and “always encouraged me to seek opportunities that I didn’t know existed”.\n\nUsha has also always sought out opportunities for herself. The 39-year-old has the sort of CV ChatGPT might conjure up if you put “overachiever with political ambitions” as a prompt: Yale, then Cambridge, then back to Yale for law school, where she was an editor of the Yale Law Journal. From there she clerked for high-powered judges including supreme court chief justice John Roberts when he wrote a 5-4 ruling upholding Trump’s so-called Muslim ban.\n\nDespite her own ambitions, Usha left her corporate law job when JD got a shot at DC. “She actually quit her job the day that Donald Trump asked me to become the VP nominee because she wants to be on the road with me,” JD Vance said in an interview last August. “That means we got to win, right? She’s gonna be mad at me if she quit her job and we don’t win.”\n\nThey won all right, but pretty much everyone in the US now thinks JD is a loser. He has historically bad favourability ratings and there are memes of him everywhere. I have absolutely no sympathy for Usha – who is far from a victim – but I have to wonder if she is starting to feel a little sorry for herself. As she and JD wandered around freezing cold Greenland over the weekend, unwelcomed by angry local people who didn’t want to be photographed anywhere near them, did she start to suspect that aligning herself with Trump – a man her own husband once called “America’s Hitler” – might not have been the wisest choice? If not, then perhaps Usha, who has been described as a “bookworm”, needs to put down The Iliad and read the room.\n\nArwa Mahdawi is a Guardian columnist",

        "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/",
        "content": "Elon Musk’s polarizing stint slashing and bashing federal bureaucracy will probably soon end, with the world’s richest person’s government service hitting its legal limit in the coming weeks.\n\n“He’s got a big company to run … at some point he’s going to be going back,” Donald Trump told reporters on Monday.\n\n“I’d keep him as long as I could keep him,” the president added.\n\nAs a special government employee, Musk faces a strict 130-day cap on his service – probably expiring in late May if counted from the day of inauguration, despite earlier White House claims Musk was “here to stay”.\n\nAdministration insiders told Politico on Wednesday that Musk would indeed be stepping down from his lead role in the weeks to come.\n\nBut Musk called the reporting “fake news” and the White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, on Wednesday said the Politico story was “garbage”.\n\n“Elon Musk and President Trump have both publicly stated that Elon will depart from public service as a special government employee when his incredible work at Doge is complete,” she said.\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to the Guardian’s request for comment.\n\nWhile Musk looks for the exit door, his “department of government efficiency” (Doge) is set to continue until 2026 under Trump’s executive order, and high-level leaders installed by Musk to run agencies throughout the government are likely to outlast the billionaire’s tenure in public service.\n\nDoge has operated figuratively – and one time literally – with a “chainsaw” through government agencies since Musk joined Trump’s team as an unvetted, high-level employee in January.\n\nDoge has since triggered large-scale civil service layoffs including about 10,000 people at the Department of Health and Human Services this week alone, while moving to eliminate entire agencies such as humanitarian-focused USAID and the state-backed global media outlet Voice of America.\n\nThere have been an estimated 56,000 federal jobs cut since 20 January and another 75,000 accepting voluntary buyouts, with at least another 171,000 planned reductions, according to the New York Times.\n\nThe huge cuts have not gone over well, according to a new poll from Marquette Law School, which found that just 41% of the US public approve of Doge’s work, while Musk’s personal likeability was even lower, at 38%.\n\nA mid-March Quinnipiac poll found that over half the country believed Musk and Doge were harming the US.\n\nDoge claims $140bn in savings already – though eagle-eyed reporters have identified significant errors in these calculations. Musk told Fox News he expected to accomplish “most of the work required to reduce the deficit by $1tn” before his time expires.\n\nThe billionaire’s involvement has raised significant conflict-of-interest concerns given his companies’ extensive government contracts, though as a special government employee, his financial disclosure forms remain confidential.\n\nThe nearly shuttered USAID had initiated an investigation on agency oversight into Starlink terminals sent to Ukraine, the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau was targeted nearly a week after publishing a rule that would put technology companies such as X – which was planning a partnership with Visa – in its crosshairs over regulation, and many other agency attacks.\n\nDemocrats have increasingly targeted Musk politically, most recently criticizing his over $20m investment in a Wisconsin supreme court race. The New Jersey senator Cory Booker broke the record for longest speech in Senate floor history after more than 24 hours assailing Trump and Musk.",

        "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/",
        "content": "Joe Rogan, the influential podcast host and prominent supporter of Donald Trump, has criticized the president’s administration over the deportation of a professional makeup artist and hairdresser to a prison in El Salvador, calling it “horrific”.\n\nAndry José Hernández Romero, who is gay, had sought asylum in the US, telling officials he faced persecution because of his sexual orientation and political views. But US immigration officers argued the crown tattoos on his wrists were proof he was part of Tren de Aragua, the Venezuelan gang, despite Hernández Romero telling them he was not. Last month, he was flown from Texas to a maximum-security prison in El Salvador, a facility that his lawyer said was “one of the worst places in the world”. His removal comes as the administration undertakes what Trump has pledged would be a mass deportation campaign.\n\nIn a 29 March episode of his popular podcast, Rogan, who endorsed Trump for president last year, said it was “horrific” that “people who aren’t criminals are getting lassoed up and deported”.\n\n“This is kind of crazy that that could be possible,” Rogan said. “And that’s bad for the cause. The cause is let’s get the gang members out – everybody agrees – but let’s not let innocent gay hairdressers get lumped up with the gangs.”\n\nThe criticism was notable as prominent conservatives have generally been reluctant to speak out against the Trump administration.\n\nThe Joe Rogan Experience has for years been one of Spotify’s top podcasts. Rogan, a former mixed martial arts commentator and comedian, has amassed a large following and garnered much attention and criticism for his controversial guests including Kanye West, Elon Musk and Alex Jones.\n\nRogan himself has expressed support for Trump’s crackdown and in last week’s episode was highly critical of Joe Biden’s immigration policies, arguing an “open border” brought criminals into the US. In the same episode, he suggested pro-Palestinian protests at US universities had been paid for, and suggested that people were being paid to protest against Tesla.\n\nBut Rogan argued that conducting deportation operations recklessly would cost Trump supporters.\n\n“If you want compassionate people to be on board with you, you can’t deport gay hairdressers seeking asylum – that’s fucking crazy – and then throw them in an El Salvador prison,” he said.",

        "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/",
        "content": "Benjamin Netanyahu has said Israel is “seizing territory” and intends to “divide up” the Gaza Strip by building a new security corridor, amid a major expansion of aerial and ground operations in the besieged Palestinian territory.\n\n“Tonight, we have shifted gears in the Gaza Strip. The [Israeli army] is seizing territory, hitting the terrorists and destroying the infrastructure,” the prime minister said in a video statement on Wednesday evening.\n\n“We are also doing another thing – seizing the ‘Morag route’. This will be the second Philadelphi route, another Philadelphi route,” he said, referring to an Israeli-held corridor along the Egypt-Gaza border.\n\n“Because we are currently dividing up the strip, we are adding pressure step by step, so that our hostages will be given to us,” Netanyahu added.\n\nThe Israel Defense Forces (IDF) have seized buffer zones around Gaza’s edges totalling 62 sq km, or 17% of the strip, since the war began in October 2023, according to the Israeli human rights group Gisha.\n\nThe Netzarim corridor, named for a defunct Israeli settlement, now cuts off Gaza City from the south of the strip.\n\nMorag was a Jewish settlement that once stood between Rafah and Khan Younis, so the use of the name suggests the new corridor is designed to separate the two southern cities.\n\nThe Israeli prime minister’s announcement follows remarks on Wednesday from his defence minister, Israel Katz, who said the Israeli army would “seize large areas” of Gaza, necessitating large-scale civilian evacuations.\n\nNeither Netanyahu nor Katz elaborated on how much Palestinian land Israel intended to capture in the renewed offensive, but the move is likely to complicate ceasefire talks and inflame fears that Israel intends to take permanent control of the strip when the war ends.\n\nIsrael’s newly stated intentions to establish another military corridor followed a night of intense airstrikes on Khan Younis and Rafah in southern Gaza, which hospital officials said had killed at least 21 people.\n\nAn airstrike on Wednesday afternoon on a Jabaliya health clinic housing displaced people killed at least 19 people, including nine children, according to the civil defence agency.\n\nThe IDF said in a statement it had taken precautions to avoid civilian casualties in the bombing of what it said was a Hamas control centre in the Jabaliya refugee camp in the north of the strip. It later said it was aware the target was located in the same building as the clinic.\n\nUnrwa, the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, said in a statement that the strike hit “two rooms on the first floor of an Unrwa destroyed health centre” that had been used as a shelter for 160 displaced families.\n\n“Many displaced families have not left the site, simply because they have absolutely nowhere else to go,” the statement said. The agency had shared the building’s coordinates with the IDF, it added.\n\nIn Khan Younis, the bodies of five women, one of them pregnant, two children and three men from the same family were brought to Nasser hospital on Wednesday morning, medics said. The IDF said it was examining the reports of civilian deaths.\n\nPalestinian media reported bombing and shelling along the Egyptian border, at least two airstrikes on Gaza City, and Israeli troop movement in the Rafah area. The IDF said it had deployed an extra division to southern Gaza early on Wednesday.\n\nView image in fullscreen Children push carts loaded with belongings as people flee Rafah on Wednesday. Photograph: Eyad Baba/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe Israeli military issued sweeping evacuation orders last week telling people in Rafah and a swath of land stretching northwards towards Khan Younis to move to al-Mawasi, an area on the shore that Israel has designated as a humanitarian zone but has repeatedly bombed.\n\nIsrael renewed intensive bombing across Gaza on 18 March, followed by the redeployment of ground troops, abruptly ending the two-month ceasefire and exchanges of Israeli hostages held by Palestinian militant groups and Palestinians in Israeli jails.\n\nAccording to the terms of the truce, the sides were supposed to negotiate implementing further phases of the deal during the first 42-day stage, but the Israeli government repeatedly postponed the talks.\n\nThe latest UN estimate, from 23 March, suggested approximately 140,000 people had been displaced since the end of the ceasefire. More than 90% of the strip’s population of 2.3 million have been forced to flee their homes during the conflict, many of them multiple times.\n\nHundreds of people have been killed in Israeli airstrikes since it ended the ceasefire. Israel has also cut off humanitarian aid, food and fuel to the strip in an effort to pressure Hamas. The month-long blockade is now the longest in the war to date.\n\nEfforts led by Qatari and Egyptian mediators to resume talks aimed at ending the war have not yet led to a breakthrough. The resumption of fighting in Gaza has also fuelled protests in Israel against the government from supporters of the remaining hostages and their loved ones.\n\nThe Hostages and Missing Families Forum, which represents most captives’ relatives, said it was “horrified to wake up this morning to the defence minister’s announcement about expanding military operations in Gaza”.\n\nThe group said: “Our highest priority must be an immediate deal to bring ALL hostages back home – the living for rehabilitation and those killed for proper burial – and end this war.”\n\nThe 7 October 2023 Hamas attack on southern Israel, in which Israel says 1,200 people, the majority of them civilians, were killed and a further 250 taken captive, was the trigger for the conflict in Gaza, the worst war between Israel and the Palestinians in more than 70 years of fighting.\n\nIsrael’s retaliatory military campaign has killed at least 50,357 people, the majority of them civilians, according to the territory’s health ministry.",

        "content": "Donald Trump is finally making good on his campaign promises to “build that wall” – but instead of steel fencing along the Mexican border, it will be constructed from tariffs, and will enclose the entire United States.\n\nIn his pugnacious and typically rambling speech on the White House lawn on Wednesday, Trump set out plans for across-the-board import taxes, ranging from 10% to more than 40%.\n\nThe president promised “liberation”, yet the immediate impact is more likely to be rising prices for US shoppers and corrosive uncertainty for firms, exacerbating an economic slowdown that may already be under way.\n\nOutside the wall, countries will be affected according to how dependent their economies are on exports to the US – and how exposed they are to the global trading system. For some, it is likely to be devastating.\n\nThe UK will be relieved to be slapped with only the 10% minimum after Keir Starmer’s charm offensive, and the EU may have feared worse than 20%. For some countries Trump outlined much higher rates: 46% for Vietnam, 49% for Cambodia and 29% for Pakistan, for example.\n\nThe precise effects of sweeping tariffs on this historic scale are hard to predict. One factor is how rival economies will respond: retaliatory tariffs tend to make a bad situation worse, though they may make short-term political sense (see Mark Carney’s poll ratings in Canada).\n\nAnother question is whether the dollar may appreciate, somewhat softening the blow for US importers. That may limit the effect on prices, which would otherwise be expected to rise as the cost of importing products and materials increases.\n\nThe main challenge in assessing the exact impact of the plans, though, is that Trump’s statement did not mark the end of the period of profound economic uncertainty that began when he arrived in the White House – quite the opposite.\n\nInstead, he has fired the starting gun on a new and inherently unpredictable scramble, in which governments will fire back with their own punitive tariffs – at the same time as negotiating hard to try to secure exemptions.\n\nAs in the UK, where ministers hope to secure an “economic agreement”, which appears to involve sweeteners for US big tech and lower tariffs on food imports, these talks are likely to have economic consequences of their own.\n\nAnd it remains unclear how amenable Trump is likely to be to persuasion.\n\nOn the one hand, he appears to enjoy the theatre of using tariffs to exact policy concessions, which he can then portray as a winning deal. Trump-watchers have sometimes argued that a dramatic slide in stock prices might lead the president to pull back from the harshest version of the policy. His press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, insisted on Tuesday that Wall Street “will be just fine” as a result of the tariff package.\n\nBut in other moments, Trump has appeared to suggest a bit of market turbulence might be part of the plan. “There is a period of transition, because what we’re doing is very big,” he said in a recent Fox News interview – in which he also declined to rule out a recession.\n\nThere is also the small matter of the revenues the administration hopes to raise from tariffs, which it wants to use to fund tax cuts. The White House trade adviser, Peter Navarro, has suggested the levies could raise an extraordinary $600bn (£460bn) a year: hardly consistent with offering carve-outs to every major economy that comes knocking.\n\nCaving in would also undermine another of Trump’s sometimes-contradictory aims: persuading firms to create new manufacturing jobs, inside the shelter of the tariff wall.\n\nAs bewildered trade experts repeatedly said in the run-up to what Trump has called “liberation day”, and are likely to continue to say after Trump’s outing in the Rose Garden, guessing what happens next is all but impossible.\n\nAll this makes for an alarming level of uncertainty – which consumers and businesses hate. Consumer confidence measures in the US have already been sliding sharply. Alongside weeks of headlines about the ambiguous tariff plans, the tens of thousands of abrupt government job losses made by Elon Musk’s “department of government efficiency” seem unlikely to have helped the mood.\n\nAnd in boardrooms, baffled executives may be reluctant to press ahead with significant investments – bringing manufacturing back into the US as Trump hopes, for example – when it is unclear how long the tariffs will endure.\n\nWhatever the medium-term prospects of jobs and factories coming “roaring back” to the US, as Trump predicted, for now what some had already dubbed a “Trumpcession” appears significantly more likely to happen, than the “golden age” he has promised.",

        "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/",
        "content": "In a new book, Joe Biden’s former White House chief of staff paints a devastating picture of the then US president’s mental and physical state before the debate with Donald Trump that sent his 2024 campaign into a tailspin, resulting in his relinquishing the Democratic nomination to Kamala Harris.\n\nRon Klain served Biden from 2021 to 2023, then returned to his side last June to run debate preparation as he had for numerous Democratic presidents before.\n\nAccording to Klain, it turned out that Biden “didn’t know what Trump had been saying and couldn’t grasp what the back and forth was”; left preparation and fell asleep by the pool; obsessed about foreign leaders, saying “these guys say I’m doing a great job as president so I must be a great president”; “didn’t really understand what his argument was on inflation”; and “had nothing to say about a second term other than finish the job”.\n\nAs described by Klain to the reporter Chris Whipple, at one point Biden had an idea.\n\n“If he looked perplexed when Trump talked, voters would understand that Trump was an idiot. Klain replied: ‘Sir, when you look perplexed, people just think you’re perplexed. And this is our problem in this race.”\n\nWhipple’s book, Uncharted: How Trump Beat Biden, Harris, and the Odds in the Wildest Campaign in History, will be published next week. The Guardian obtained a copy.\n\nBiden is reportedly planning his own book but Whipple’s blockbuster is not even the first such volume to hit the shelves. This week saw the publication of Fight, by Jonathan Allen and Amie Parnes, which also contains extensive reporting on Biden’s decline and Harris’s struggle to win over party elites.\n\nLike Parnes and Allen, Whipple reports both sides of a campaign Trump won despite a criminal conviction, civil penalties including one related to an allegation of rape, and indictments over election subversion and retention of classified information.\n\nBut Whipple focuses another harsh spotlight on Biden, an octogenarian president long beset by questions about his fitness for office.\n\nLast week, Whipple told Politico: “I have fresh reporting on an hour-by-hour, day-by-day basis of Biden’s final days, and obviously his decline is a major part of the story.\n\n“I happen to think that to call it a ‘cover-up’ is simplistic. I think it was stranger and way more troubling than that. Biden’s inner circle, his closest advisers, many of them were in a fog of delusion and denial. They believed what they wanted to believe.”\n\nIn early 2024, as the campaign warmed up, Klain was among those who said he believed Biden was the right candidate to beat Trump a second time, telling the New York Times: “If I thought he wasn’t the right candidate to beat Donald Trump, I wouldn’t be for him running. But I think he is the right candidate.”\n\nEven after the disastrous debate, by his own telling to Whipple, Klain believed Biden should have stayed in the race – a statement that jars with Klain’s account of debate prep at Camp David.\n\n“At his first meeting with Biden in Aspen Lodge, the president’s cabin,” Whipple writes, Klain “was startled. He’d never seen him so exhausted and out of it. Biden was unaware of what was happening in his own campaign. Halfway through the session, the president excused himself and went off to sit by the pool.\n\n“That evening Biden met again with Klain and his team, [Biden aides] Mike Donilon, Steve Richetti, and Bruce Reed. ‘We sat around the table,’ said Klain. ‘[Biden] had answers on cards, and he was just extremely exhausted. And I was struck by how out of touch with American politics he was. He was just very, very focused on his interactions with Nato leaders.’”\n\nKlain, Whipple writes, “wondered half-seriously if Biden thought he was president of Nato instead of the US. ‘He just became very enraptured with being the head of Nato,’ he said. That wouldn’t help him on Capitol Hill because, as Klain noted, ‘domestic political leaders don’t really care what [Emmanuel] Macron and [Olaf] Scholz think.’”\n\nKlain, fellow aides and visitors including the film mogul Jeffrey Katzenberg tried to get Biden into shape. Two mock debates were organized, focusing on domestic policy.\n\n“The first was scheduled to last 90 minutes but Klain called it off after 45. The president’s voice was shot and so was his grasp of the subject. All he really could talk about was his infrastructure plan and how he was rebuilding America and 16 million jobs. He had nothing to say about his agenda for a second term.”\n\nKlain says Biden grew irritable, saying he would not make promises as he would be criticized for failing to deliver. Klain says he tried to persuade Biden to run on unfinished business, including his attempt to “subsidize state and local efforts to do childcare and bring down the cost to $20 a day. And you ought to try to fight for it again.”\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to First Thing Free daily newsletter Our US morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It brings down costs for people. It’s responsive to inflation. It will bring more people into the workforce. It’s good economics. And you know this is something you’re for.”\n\nBut “Biden didn’t want to talk about it” and “25 minutes into the second mock debate, the president was done for the day. ‘I’m just too tired to continue and I’m afraid of losing my voice here and I feel bad,’ he said. ‘I just need some sleep. I’ll be fine tomorrow.’ He went off to bed.”\n\n“The president was fatigued, befuddled, and disengaged,” Whipple writes. “Klain feared the debate with Trump would be a nationally televised disaster.”\n\nIt was. On 27 June, Biden arrived at the Atlanta venue with minutes to spare – because, Klain said, “He was the president of the United States. They weren’t going to start without him.” Onstage, for two hours and six minutes, Biden stumbled, stared and mumbled.\n\nAs described by Whipple, Jill Biden praised her husband’s performance but all others around the president could see “something was terribly wrong”. Whipple quotes an unnamed close friend of Biden who took a call from Valerie Biden Owens. The president’s sister and longtime adviser was “so angry, she was practically incoherent”. The same friend reports a later call from Biden, laughing at his predicament and sounding like the senator and vice-president of old.\n\n“Where did that voice go?” the friend wondered … “Where did that guy with that voice go? What the fuck happened to this guy?”\n\nTo Whipple, that was a question “on which the political fate of the nation would turn”.\n\nEventually, Biden bowed to reality. On 21 July, Klain took a call from Jeff Zients, his successor as chief of staff. Biden was out. Despite the debate disaster, the news was a “gut punch” to Klain.\n\n“Jeff, that’s too bad,” he said. “I think that’s a mistake. I think this was an avoidable tragedy.”\n\nHarris faced opposition from Democratic grandees including Obama and Nancy Pelosi, but wrapped up the nomination by August. In early September, Klain gave Whipple his interview. With the Minnesota governor, Tim Walz, as her running mate, Harris mounted an energetic campaign. In November, she lost to Trump.",

Share\n\n2m ago 21.36 EDT Republican senators join Democrats to block tariffs on Canada Lauren Gambino Several Republican senators have joined Democrats to pass a resolution that would block Donald Trump’s tariffs on Canada, a rare rebuke of the president’s trade policy just hours after he announced plans for sweeping import taxes on some of the country’s largest trading partners. In a 51-48 vote, four Republicans – Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, and both Kentucky senators, the former majority leader Mitch McConnell and Rand Paul – defied Trump’s pressure campaign and supported the measure. Democrats used a procedural maneuver to force a vote on the resolution, which would terminate the national emergency on fentanyl Trump is using to justify tariffs on Canada. While Trump’s sweeping new tariffs, introduced in a White House Rose Garden ceremony on Wednesday, did not include additional levies on Canada, the Senate vote amounted to a significant bipartisan condemnation of the president’s escalating global trade war with allies and enemies alike. “Tariffs will hurt our families. Canada is not an enemy,” the Democratic senator Tim Kaine, the bill’s sponsor, said in a floor speech on Wednesday. Let’s not label an ally as an enemy. Let’s not impose punishing costs on American families at a time they can’t afford it. Let’s not hurt American small businesses. Let’s not make our national security investments in ships and subs more expensive.

But he has reiterated that the tariffs are unwarranted: President Trump referred to reciprocal tariffs. A reciprocal tariff would be zero, not 10%. The administration’s tariffs have no basis in logic and they go against the basis of our two nations’ partnership. This is not the act of a friend. He also said the move will have consequences for how Australians see their relationship with the US. The Australian people have every right to view this action by the Trump administration as undermining our free and fair trading relationship and counter to the shared values that have always been at the heart of our two nations’ longstanding friendship. This will have consequences for how Australians see this relationship.

In his pugnacious and typically rambling speech on the White House lawn on Wednesday, Trump set out plans for across-the-board import taxes, ranging from 10% to more than 40%. The president promised “liberation”, yet the immediate impact is more likely to be rising prices for US shoppers and corrosive uncertainty for firms, exacerbating an economic slowdown that may already be under way.

Last time I looked, Norfolk Island was a part of Australia,” he told ABC Radio Melbourne. Later at a press conference, he added: I’m not quite sure that Norfolk Island, with respect to it, is a trade competitor with the giant economy of the United States but that just shows and exemplifies the fact that nowhere on earth is exempt from this. The tariffs raised on Australia are 10%; those levied on Christmas Island (an external territory of the country) are also 10%. While those aimed at Norfolk Island (another external territory) stand at 29%. Share\n\n46m ago 20.52 EDT South Korea says it will use 'all its capabilities' to overcome trade crisis South Korea’s acting President Han Duck-soo has ordered emergency support measures for businesses that will be affected by the imposition of US tariffs of 25%, including automobiles, the industry ministry has said. Han asked the industry minister to analyse the content of the tariffs and actively negotiate with Washington to minimise the impact of US reciprocal tariffs, the ministry said. Han said: As the global trade war has become a reality, the government must pour all its capabilities to overcome the trade crisis. Trump in his speech singled out Washington’s Asian security allies South Korea and Japan, accusing them of being among the worst offenders for conducting unfair trade practices against the United States. Finance minister Choi Sang-mok and industry minister Ahn Duk-geun are to hold further meetings later on Thursday to discuss the tariffs’ impact on financial and foreign exchange markets, strategies for outreach to the US and the response of government and business, the news agency Yonhap reported. Analysts in Seoul said Trump’s extensive rollout of tariffs was harsher than expected, casting a cloud over the export-reliant economy. “For the domestic economy, a significant blow will be inevitable,” said Park Sang-hyun, an economist at iM Securities. “It is clear that major export products such as automobiles will be hit hard, and exports to the US through production bases in Vietnam will also be hit hard,” Park said in a note. Share\n\n55m ago 20.44 EDT The new US tariffs “will only create losers” with US consumers particularly hard hit, the German Automotive Industry Association (VDA), has said in a statement, calling on the EU “to act together and with the necessary force, while continuing to signal its willingness to negotiate.” The body, which represents the powerful German auto industry, said the tariffs marked the United States’ departure from the rules-based global trade order – and thus a departure from the foundation for global value creation and corresponding growth and prosperity in many regions of the world. This is not America first; this is America alone. The VDA also urged the EU to speed up free trade deal negotiations with other countries, arguing that the bloc must be an “advocate for free and fair global trade” and called on the incoming German government to take a leading role in such talks.

On an unseasonably chilly day in the White House Rose Garden, Donald Trump stood with a giant chart listing what reciprocal tariffs he would impose on China, the European Union, the United Kingdom and other hapless contestants. The winner? Trump, of course, the maestro of fake populism, watched by a crowd that included men in hard hats and fluorescent construction worker vests. The losers? Everybody else. Sensing a bad headline, Trump hadn’t wanted his “liberation day” to coincide with April Fools’ Day, so he waited until 2 April to enter his fool’s paradise.

AFP reports: Wall Street has largely suffered from Trump’s various trade announcements in recent weeks. “The silver lining for investors could be that this is only a starting point for negotiations with other countries and ultimately tariff rates will come down across the board,” Northlight Asset Management’s Chris Zaccarelli wrote in a note to clients. “But for now traders are shooting first and asking questions later,” he added. The share price of technology companies whose components are produced abroad also fell sharply, with Apple losing 7.4% after-hours, Nvidia falling 5.2% and TSMC declining 5.9%. Futures markets are typically much more volatile than the regular indices. The clothing sector was also hit especially hard, with a particularly heavy bill for China, where products will be hit by an additional duty of 34% from April 9, and Vietnam, where the new “reciprocal” rate will be 46%. Brands whose clothes are partly made in China or Vietnam were sharply lower, with Gap down 8.5% after hours, Ralph Lauren falling 7.3%, and Nike losing 7.1%.

Share Updated at 20.20 EDT\n\n1h ago 20.16 EDT Eva Corlett New Zealand will face a 10% baseline tariff on all imported goods into the US, as part of Donald Trump’s sweeping worldwide tariffs announcement. The announcement has puzzled New Zealand, which says the US administration’s claim that New Zealand imposes a 20% tariff rate on US goods does not add up. Roughly 75% of goods from the US into New Zealand have low or no tariffs imposed, while tariffs levied on US imports is about 1.9% on average. New Zealand’s trade minister Todd McClay told media on Thursday: New Zealand applies a much lower tariff rate for US exports into New Zealand – I’ve asked officials to clarify, but we don’t have a 20% tariff. The US is New Zealand’s fastest growing export market, becoming its second largest in 2024, ahead of Australia and after China. New Zealand exports to the US surpassed NZD $9b in 2024, driven by meat, dairy and wine. The new tariff could mean a NZD $900m bill for New Zealand exporters. McClay said the imposition of tariffs was not unexpected but it would have an impact on New Zealand exporters, some of which may look to other markets. McClay said: Tariff rates anywhere upon New Zealand exporters is not a good thing … but New Zealand exporters are very nimble, and they are very able and very competitive. New Zealand would not be looking to retaliate with tariffs on the US, McClay said. That would put up prices on New Zealand consumers, and it would be inflationary.

Share\n\n2h ago 20.01 EDT How will the EU react? Lisa O'Carroll Strongly. The EU has already announced a string of tariffs it plans to introduce on US imports targeting steel and aluminium in kind, as well as textiles, leather goods, home appliances, house tools, plastics and wood. Sources say it is also considering nuclear options, including tariffs on revenues generated in the EU by big tech firms and social media. This could be seen as highly provocative and would put Trump’s allies, such as Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos, in the crosshairs. It would also test the unity of the EU, with Ireland expected to argue against more punitive measures because of the dominance of the US tech sector in Dublin. Any action by the EU – which is targeted with a 20-percent tariff rate – “should be proportionate, aimed at defending the interests of our businesses, workers and citizens,” said Irish prime minister Micheál Martin. Italian prime minister Giorgia Meloni on Wednesday called the new US tariffs on the EU “wrong”. The EU’s preference is to negotiate so it has decided to delay countermeasures to open a space for talks. Maroš Šefčovič, the European commissioner for trade and economic security, has already met the US commerce secretary, Howard Lutnick, and, although Šefčovič reportedly came home last week “empty handed”, he is operating the Brexit playbook, hoping to build a personal relationship that will provide credit in the bank when they get down to talks. EU chief Ursula von der Leyen is expected to give a reaction on behalf of the European Commission – which handles trade issues for all 27 countries in the European Union – at around 0300 GMT on Thursday – that’s in three hours – during a visit she is making to Uzbekistan.

Reuters reports: “That rate was last seen around 1910,” Olu Sonola, Fitch’s head of US economic research, said in a statement after Trump’s announcement for a global baseline import tax of 10%, but much higher rates for many trading partners. “This is a game changer, not only for the US economy but for the global economy,” Sonola said. “Many countries will likely end up in a recession. You can throw most forecasts out the door, if this tariff rate stays on for an extended period of time.” Share",

        "content": "If you are an Australian travelling to the United States, recent reports of travellers having their devices searched at the border and being refused entry might give you pause for thought.\n\nA French scientist was recently denied entry to the US after immigration officers found messages on his phone critical of Donald Trump. German and British citizens have also encountered problems at US airports, according to reports.\n\nHere’s what you need to know and what you can do if you are heading to the US.\n\nCan immigration search my phone when I enter the US? The US government has the power to search your devices on entry into the US, and saying you do not consent to the search likely won’t change the situation, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) says. If you don’t hand over your device password, and are visiting on a visa and are not a citizen or permanent US resident, you risk being denied entry. Even if you are allowed entry, they may keep your device for months if you refuse to unlock it for them.\n\nWhat can they look at on my device? Immigration officers can do a basic on-the-spot search of devices, the ACLU says. They can download the full contents of your device, including data – meaning they effectively get access to everything. Sign up for the Afternoon Update: Election 2025 email newsletter Officials can keep the device for longer – from days to months – if there are “extenuating circumstances”.\n\nWhat should I do to prepare before going to the US? Take steps to protect your devices, or find alternatives. If you’re travelling for work, consider taking a laptop that has no confidential information, is shut down on entry and is not automatically connected to any cloud services or email accounts that may store confidential information. For mobile phones, if you have the means, consider setting up a second device (sometimes referred to as a burner phone) to travel with. Make sure your second device is stripped of confidential information and contains only the basics needed on your trip. Consider setting up a second mobile number/sim card for the second device. But if you do, make sure any apps or services that you use which are reliant on two-factor SMS authentication (rather than dedicated 2FA apps such as Authenticator) are set to verify you through your new number.\n\nWhat should be on my devices before entering the US? Travel with as little information as possible, the ACLU recommends. They advise people to use strong and unique passwords, and to shut all your devices down before crossing the border. How to protect your phone and data privacy at the US border Read more If possible, consider setting up new email accounts, use password managers and log out of apps such as social media. Owners of iPhones should consider enabling Lockdown Mode, which adds further protection against someone trying to access your device without the passcode. If you need to travel with access to your existing email accounts, turn off cloud syncing services and clear downloaded emails. If you have privileged information on your device, the ACLU advises that you should alert border officers to this fact before they begin a search. Once in the US, if you have a password manager and access to your existing accounts, you can log back into your email and other services you may need to use.\n\nWhat are my rights on entering the US?

        "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/",
        "content": "Democrats were tasting unfamiliar triumphalism on Wednesday after the election for a vacant Wisconsin supreme court seat turned into an emphatic repudiation of Elon Musk, Donald Trump’s richest supporter and key ally.\n\nMusk endured a wave of gloating on Twitter/X, his own social media platform, after Brad Schimel, a Trump-endorsed judge that he spent $25m supporting lost by 10 percentage points to Susan Crawford, whose victory sustained a 4-3 liberal majority on the court.\n\nOn a day that Trump has earmarked as “liberation day” to mark his long-awaited roll out of trade tariffs, Democrats seized on the result as a referendum on Musk – who has spearheaded the president’s slashing of federal government workers and spending programmes – while casting it as a platform for a recovery in next year’s congressional midterm elections.\n\nIn a display of schadenfreude, the Democrats’ official account posted a picture of Musk donning a cheese head and accompanied with the single word “Loser”.\n\nCrawford, a former attorney for Planned Parenthood, presented her success as a triumph over Musk. “As a little girl, I never could have imagined that I’d be taking on the richest man in the world for justice in Wisconsin. And we won,” she told cheering supporters on Tuesday night.\n\nThe result is politically significant because the court is due to issue abortion rulings while also deciding on electoral redistricting questions which now have the potential to help Democrats in future elections in a state where contests are traditionally close.\n\nDemocrats have sought to exploit Musk’s growing unpopularity to tar Trump and the Republican generally. Recent polls show a majority of voters have a negative view of Musk, who was once popular with the US public.\n\nHakeem Jeffries, the Democrat leader in the House of Representatives, said it was now on Republicans to separate themselves from Musk.\n\n“Time for them to walk away from this unelected, unpopular, unhinged and un-American billionaire puppet master,” he told MSNBC. “He tried to spend his unlimited resources to buy a state supreme court seat in Wisconsin, and it failed spectacularly.”\n\nChuck Schumer, the party’s leader in the Senate, said the result “sent a decisive message to Elon Musk, Donald Trump and Doge… our democracy is not for sale.”\n\nOther party figures were blunter. Tim Walz, the governor of Minnesota and Kamala Harris’s running mate for the Democrats in the 2024 presidential election, was succinct on Musk’s social media platform X, formerly Twitter.\n\n“Wisconsin beat the billionaire,” he posted.\n\nJasmine Crockett, a Democrat House member from Texas, posted: “Well well well, I guess Wisconsin agreed on the message for old Elon: “F’ off!,” she wrote.\n\nEric Swalwell, a California representative, called the result an “ass-kicking” for Republicans, adding: “Where else does Elon want to try and buy an election.”\n\nJB Pritzker, the Democratic governor of Illinois and himself a billionaire, wrote: “Elon Musk is not good at this.”\n\nSuspicions that Musk’s profile and conspicuous wealth have become an electoral turnoff also appeared to infect Republicans.\n\nPam Van Handel, a Republican party chair in Wisconsin’s Outagamie county, told Politico: “I thought [Musk] was gonna be an asset for this race. People love Trump, but maybe they don’t love everybody he supports.”\n\nThe site quoted Rohn Bishop, the Republican mayor of the Wisconsin city of Waupun, as saying: “I thought maybe Elon coming could turn these people to go out and vote, [but] I think… he may have turned out more voters against [Schimel].”\n\nCharlie Kirk, a pro-Trump social media influencer and activist, implied – without mentioning Musk by name – that his wealth and profile might have played a role.\n\n“We did a lot in Wisconsin but we fell short,” he wrote. “We must realize and appreciate that we are the LOW PROP party now. We are the party of welders, waiters and plumbers. We are the party of people who work with their hands, who shower before and after work.”\n\nNeither Musk nor Trump mentioned the supreme court result in its immediate aftermath, trumpeting instead another Wisconsin ballot result that amended the state constitution to require photo ID as a condition for voting.\n\nThen on Wednesday afternoon, Politico and ABC News reported that Trump told his inner circle, including some Cabinet secretaries, that Musk will soon leave his role as a top adviser to the president, overseeing federal government job cuts. The reports cited anonymous sources familiar with the matter.\n\nMeanwhile, Republicans won victories on Tuesday in two special House elections in Florida caused by the resignations from the US Congress of Matt Gaetz, Trump’s original attorney general designee but who later withdrew amid sexual misconduct allegations, and Mike Waltz, now the national security adviser.\n\nBut the elections were won by margins of around half of what Trump achieved last November. Jimmy Patronis beat Democratic challenger Gay Valimont to win Gaetz’s former seat, while Randy Fine defeated Josh Weil in Florida’s sixth district, once held by Waltz.\n\nThe results bolstered the GOP’s wafer thin House majority to 220-213.\n\nTrump hailed the outcomes, which he attributed to his personal endorsement. “THE TRUMP ENDORSEMENT, AS ALWAYS, PROVED FAR GREATER THAN THE DEMOCRATS FORCES OF EVIL. CONGRATULATIONS TO AMERICA!,” he posted on his Truth Social platform.\n\nBut Jeffries claimed the reduced victory margins augured well for the Democrats in next year’s midterms.\n\n“One point that should have my Republican colleagues quaking in their boots,” he said. “In the Florida sixth race, which was a Trump +30 district, the margin was cut in half. There are 60 Republicans in the House who currently represent districts where Trump did worse than 15 or 16 points.”",

        "title": "John Oliver faces defamation lawsuit from US healthcare executive",
        "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/",
        "content": "A US healthcare executive has sued John Oliver for defamation following a Last Week Tonight episode on Medicaid, in which the British-American comedian quoted the doctor as saying it was okay for a patient with bowel issues to be “a little dirty for a couple of days”.\n\nDr Brian Morley, the ex-medical director of AmeriHealth Caritas, argues that Oliver – an outspoken comic whose show has not only addressed muzzling lawsuits but been subject to them – took the quote out of context in an April 2024 episode on Medicaid.\n\nThe suit against Oliver and the Last Week Tonight producers Partially Important Productions seeks unspecified damages “in an amount to be determined and in excess of $75,000”, according to Deadline. It does not name Last Week Tonight’s broadcaster, HBO.\n\nThe suit, filed in New York last week, stated: “Defendants falsely told millions of viewers of their show, Last Week Tonight with John Oliver, that Dr Morley testified in a Medicaid hearing that ‘he thinks it’s okay if people have shit on them for days,’ intentionally leading viewers to believe that Dr. Morley made these alleged statements about – and illegally denied Medicaid services to – a young man who has severe mental impairment, was harnessed in a wheelchair, wears diapers, and required in-home bathing and diaper changing because he could do neither himself.”\n\nThe suit claims: “Defendants’ false accusations were designed to spark outrage, and they did. The false accusations Defendants made were so heinous that John Oliver felt justified in telling his millions of viewers: ‘fuck that doctor with a rusty canoe. I hope he gets tetanus of the balls.’ Oliver’s feigned outrage at Dr Morley was fabricated for ratings and profits at the expense of Dr Morley’s reputation and personal well-being.”\n\nThe quote in question, which occurs around 21 minutes into the episode’s 28 minute-long main segment, refers to the story of Louis Facenda Jr, a quadriplegic with cerebral palsy whose in-home care program was disrupted following cuts to Iowa’s Medicaid services.\n\nOliver cited an interview with Facenda and his mother and primary caregiver, Joann, on the difficulties faced by people with disabilities as the state shifted to for-profit “managed care organizations”, leaving Facenda spending hours in dirty diapers.\n\nOliver played audio from Morley’s testimony at a 2017 administrative hearing, that aired as such: “People have bowel movements every day where they don’t completely clean themselves, and we don’t fuss over [them] too much. People are allowed to be dirty … You know, I would allow him to be a little dirty for a couple of days.”\n\nOliver said of the snippet: “Look, I’ll be honest, when I first heard that, I thought that has to be taken out of context. There is no way a doctor, a licensed physician, would testify in a hearing that he thinks it’s okay if people have shit on them for days. So, we got the full hearing, and I’m not going to play it for you, I’m just going to tell you: he said it, he meant it, and it made me want to punch a hole in the wall.\n\n“If I absolutely had to put it into words, I guess I’d say fuck that doctor with a rusty canoe, I hope he gets tetanus of the balls,” he continued. “And if he has a problem with my language there, I’d say I’m allowed to be dirty. People are allowed to be a little dirty sometimes, apparently that’s doctors fucking orders.”\n\nOliver also added that legally, he was required to say that AmeriHealth Caritas restored the patient’s services, but called it a “disgrace” that it was disrupted in the first place.\n\nThe lawsuit argues that context cut from the show changes the meaning of Morley’s words, which they quote as thus: “In certain cases, yes, with the patient with significant comorbidities, you would want to have someone wiping them and getting the feces off. But like I said, people have bowel movements every day where they don’t completely clean themselves and we don’t fuss over too much. People are allowed to be dirty. It’s when the dirty and the feces and the urine interfere with, you know, medical safety, like in someone who has concomitant comorbidities that you worry, but not in this specific case. I would allow him to be a little dirty for a couple days.”\n\nAccording to the complaint, a senior Last Week Tonight producer spoke to Morley before the episode aired and stated that they had listened to the full administrative hearing.\n\nBut “Defendants knowingly manipulated Dr Morley’s testimony and then knowingly manipulated the context in which they placed it such to convey the defamatory meaning.”\n\nMorley later “demanded that Defendants retract their False and Defamatory Statements”, which the show refused. The lawsuit further claims: “Defendants published the False and Defamatory Statements and Meanings with common law malice, with the intent to injure and reckless disregard for the rights of Dr Morley.”\n\nThis is not the first lawsuit faced by Last Week Tonight.\n\nIn 2017, a West Virginia judge tossed a defamation suit filed against the comedian and his show by Bob Murray, the CEO of a coal company. The judge agreed with HBO’s argument that Oliver’s comments were either factual and sourced from various court documents, or clearly satirical and thus protected by the first amendment.",

And you can also follow along with our continuing coverage of the United State’s tariffs announcment here. Here is a summary of the key developments from today: Donald Trump announced sweeping tariffs on US trade partners across the world in an event today he nicknamed “liberation day”. The tariffs range from 10% to 49% on all goods imported from abroad. He also added that a 25% tariff on all foreign automakers will go into effect at midnight. World leaders responded to news with a mix of confusion and tempered concern.\n\nFour Senate Republicans joined with Democrats to pass a resolution this evening aimed at preventing the president from levying tariffs on Canada. The news came just hours after Trump announced broad “reciprocal” tariffs on many countries, but not Canada or Mexico.\n\nDespite a 10% tariff levied on all goods imported from the United Kingdom, British leaders say the United States remains the UK’s “closest ally”.\n\nEarlier in the day, Trump told his inner circle that Elon Musk will be taking a step back from the Trump administration, Politico reports. According to the outlet, both Musk and Trump have agreed “that it will soon be time for Musk to return to his businesses and take on a supporting role”.\n\nNational security adviser Mike Waltz’s team has regularly set up group chats on Signal to coordinate official work on various global issues from different parts of the world including Ukraine, China, Gaza, Middle East policy, Africa and Europe, Politico reports. According to four people who have been personally added to the chats and who spoke to the outlet, sensitive information was discussed in the chats.\n\nA US judge on Wednesday dismissed the federal corruption case against New York City mayor Eric Adams, adding that the charges cannot be brought again. US district judge Dale Ho’s decision to dismiss the case with prejudice was in line with the recommendation of a lawyer he asked to offer independent arguments, but contrary to the justice department request for a dismissal without prejudice, Reuters reports. Share\n\n29m ago 20.08 EDT Mike Pence, the former vice-president who turned into a vocal critic of Donald Trump’s after the January 6 attack on the US Capitol, has voiced his disapproval of the president’s new tariffs. “The Trump Tariff Tax is the largest peacetime tax hike in U.S. history,” Pence wrote in a post on social media. “These Tariffs are nearly 10x the size of those imposed during the Trump-Pence Administration and will cost American families over $3,500 per year.” Share Updated at 20.25 EDT\n\n37m ago 19.59 EDT The Senate has passed a resolution aimed at preventing Donald Trump from imposing tariffs on Canadian goods. The resolution passed this evening after four Republicans joined Democrats to support the measure. They included senators Rand Paul of Kentucky, Susan Collins of Maine, Mitch McConnel of Kentucky and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska. The legislation is unlikely to pass in the Republican-controlled House, but demonstrates a powerful rebuke of Trump just hours after his “liberation day” tariff announcement. Share\n\n47m ago 19.50 EDT Union leaders have reacted to Donald Trump’s tariff announcement cautiously, saying the president must prioritize workers by improving conditions for them at home. The president of the largest federation of unions in the United States, the AFL-CIO, said strategic tariffs can be helpful, but that they must be paired with policies that support workers’ rights. “Unfortunately, the Trump administration’s attacks on trade union workers’ rights at home, gutting of the government agency that works to discourage the outsourcing of American jobs and efforts to erode critical investments in U.S. manufacturing take us backward,” said AFL-CIO President Liz Shuler. “We will continue to fight for trade policy that prioritizes the interests of working people without causing unnecessary economic pain for America’s working families.” Share\n\n50m ago 19.47 EDT Tufts University files declaration of support for detained Turkish student In a brief break from tariff-related news, Tufts University has filed a declaration in support of Rümeysa Öztürk, a doctoral student from Turkey who was arrested by plainclothes immigration officials last week. “The University has no information to support the allegations that she was engaged in activities at Tufts that warrant her arrest and detention,” the statement reads. Regarding a student opinion article published in the university newspaper, which officials cited in her arrest, the University said that “this opinion piece was not in violation of any Tufts policies. Further, no complaints were filed with the University or, to our knowledge, outside of the University about this op-ed.” It added that: “The free movement of our international community members” is “essential to the functioning of the University and serving our mission”. Share Updated at 19.48 EDT\n\n1h ago 19.39 EDT Reciprocal tarrifs could raise average US duty to 25% The “reciprocal tariffs” Donald Trump announced today could raise the average US tariff rate to 25% from a current rate of about 3%, according to Omair Sharif, an economist and founder of Inflation Insights. Sharif added that the duties would top the 20% rate imposed by the Smoot-Hawley tariffs levied in 1933, which were widely blamed for worsening the Great Depression.

Jonathan Reynolds, the Business secretary, told the Associated Press, “the US is our closest ally, so our approach is to remain calm and committed”. He added that the UK government is working to negotiate a trade deal to “mitigate the impact” of the tariff Trump announced today. Share Updated at 19.47 EDT\n\n1h ago 19.26 EDT Treasury secretary Scott Bessent has told foreign leaders processing the news of the United States’s “reciprocal tarrifs” to “sit back, take a deep breath, don’t immediately retaliate”. Speaking with CNN this evening, Bessent added: “A trade war depends on the country. But remember that the history of trade is we are the deficit country. The deficit country has an advantage. They are the surplus countries. The surplus countries traditionally, always lose any kind of trade escalation.” Bessent added that “doing anything rash would be unwise.” Share Updated at 20.12 EDT\n\n1h ago 19.18 EDT The text of Donald Trump’s executive order announcing “reciprocal tariffs” is now available on the White House website. In it, Trump declares a national economic emergency in response to the US trade deficit. The order states: “I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, find that underlying conditions, including a lack of reciprocity in our bilateral trade relationships, disparate tariff rates and non-tariff barriers, and U.S. trading partners’ economic policies that suppress domestic wages and consumption, as indicated by large and persistent annual U.S. goods trade deficits, constitute an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and economy of the United States. That threat has its source in whole or substantial part outside the United States in the domestic economic policies of key trading partners and structural imbalances in the global trading system.” Share",

        "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/",
        "content": "Fabian Hürzeler has had more enjoyable weeks. After being dumped out of the FA Cup quarter-finals here on Saturday by Nottingham Forest in a penalty shootout, there was more heartache for the Brighton manager as Marcus Rashford’s third goal in his past two games, yet another for Marco Asensio, and Donyell Malen’s first for the club gave Aston Villa a crucial win in the battle for a top‑five finish.\n\nIt meant Unai Emery’s side moved above Brighton and vastly improved their chances of matching their achievement last season of qualifying for the Champions League. They still have to play the fourth- and fifth-placed Manchester City and Newcastle in the run-in after hosting Forest on Saturday. Yet after making some shrewd acquisitions in January including Rashford and Asensio – who now has eight goals for Villa since joining on loan from Paris Saint-Germain – you wouldn’t bet against them doing it.\n\n“The most important thing is how he is feeling – how he is recovering confidence in himself and concentrating on playing football,” Emery said of Rashford’s impact. “But everything with him is getting progressively better and it’s the same with Marco [Asensio]. We signed these players because we knew they could help us.”\n\nHürzeler criticised his team for “playing soft” against Forest but they were again outfought by a well‑drilled Villa outfit. There was frustration when Simon Adingra’s equaliser was disallowed for handball just after Rashford’s opener but more than a smattering of boos greeted the third from Malen – who joined Villa from Borussia Dortmund in January – in the 10th minute of stoppage time.\n\n“It’s not easy when all the little things go against you, you try to force it in some moments and we didn’t have the right answer,” said Hurzeler, whose team face a trip to play their arch-rivals Crystal Palace on Saturday. “We have a chance to make it better.”\n\nIt took Villa’s fans less than five minutes to remind their hosts that they are heading to Wembley this month to face Palace with a chorus of “Que Sera”. With the first leg of their Champions League quarter‑final against PSG to look forward to as well next week, Emery was delighted that Ollie Watkins was able to return from injury as a second-half substitute alongside Asensio and Malen.\n\nIt was Villa’s bench that made the difference, although the option to make Rashford’s move permanent from Manchester United in the summer for £40m is looking more and more attractive by the day.\n\nView image in fullscreen Marco Asensio celebrates his eighth goal for Aston Villa since joining on loan in January. Photograph: Neville Williams/Aston Villa FC/Getty Images\n\nThe referee, Stuart Attwell, waved away appeals for a first-half penalty after Kaoru Mitoma went down rather easily under pressure from Matty Cash inside the area. Emery could not resist offering his own opinion that the Japan forward had dived as he and Hürzeler had to be separated by the fourth official Simon Hooper.\n\nVilla had their own appeals for a penalty turned down despite the video assistant referee taking a long look at Jack Hinshelwood’s challenge on Jacob Ramsey. Brighton felt they had another shout for a penalty when Yasin Ayari’s free-kick cannoned back off the post and struck Ramsey on the arm but again Attwell said no.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Football Daily Free daily newsletter Kick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of football Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Jan Paul van Hecke’s header from a corner was straight at Emi Martínez and the Villa goalkeeper wasted no time finding Morgan Rogers with a quick throw. His pass over the top was perfect for Rashford to race on to and he squeezed the ball past Bart Verbruggen via a deflection.\n\nBrighton thought they had found the perfect riposte when Adingra swept home from close range but VAR correctly ruled out the goal after replays showed Mitoma had used his arm to control the ball in the buildup.\n\nRashford’s night came to an end midway through the second half as Emery attempted to close out the victory with a triple substitution that included Asensio. Not to be outdone, Hurzeler made a quadruple change for Brighton. But it was Asensio who made the difference when he finished off a lightning quick break before Malan rounded off the scoring in injury-time to give Villa’s Champions League hopes a shot in the arm.",

        "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/",
        "content": "Joe Rogan, the influential podcast host and prominent supporter of Donald Trump, has criticized the president’s administration over the deportation of a professional makeup artist and hairdresser to a prison in El Salvador, calling it “horrific”.\n\nAndry José Hernández Romero, who is gay, had sought asylum in the US, telling officials he faced persecution because of his sexual orientation and political views. But US immigration officers argued the crown tattoos on his wrists were proof he was part of Tren de Aragua, the Venezuelan gang, despite Hernández Romero telling them he was not. Last month, he was flown from Texas to a maximum-security prison in El Salvador, a facility that his lawyer said was “one of the worst places in the world”. His removal comes as the administration undertakes what Trump has pledged would be a mass deportation campaign.\n\nIn a 29 March episode of his popular podcast, Rogan, who endorsed Trump for president last year, said it was “horrific” that “people who aren’t criminals are getting lassoed up and deported”.\n\n“This is kind of crazy that that could be possible,” Rogan said. “And that’s bad for the cause. The cause is let’s get the gang members out – everybody agrees – but let’s not let innocent gay hairdressers get lumped up with the gangs.”\n\nThe criticism was notable as prominent conservatives have generally been reluctant to speak out against the Trump administration.\n\nThe Joe Rogan Experience has for years been one of Spotify’s top podcasts. Rogan, a former mixed martial arts commentator and comedian, has amassed a large following and garnered much attention and criticism for his controversial guests including Kanye West, Elon Musk and Alex Jones.\n\nRogan himself has expressed support for Trump’s crackdown and in last week’s episode was highly critical of Joe Biden’s immigration policies, arguing an “open border” brought criminals into the US. In the same episode, he suggested pro-Palestinian protests at US universities had been paid for, and suggested that people were being paid to protest against Tesla.\n\nBut Rogan argued that conducting deportation operations recklessly would cost Trump supporters.\n\n“If you want compassionate people to be on board with you, you can’t deport gay hairdressers seeking asylum – that’s fucking crazy – and then throw them in an El Salvador prison,” he said.",

        "title": "Cybersecurity Professor Faced China-Funding Inquiry Before Disappearing, Sources Say",
        "source": "https://www.wired.com/",
        "content": "Before the official faculty profiles of renowned Indiana University, Bloomington (IU) data privacy professor Xiaofeng Wang and his wife disappeared and the FBI raided two of the couple’s homes last week, the school is said to have been reviewing for months whether the professor received unreported research funding from China, WIRED has learned.\n\nIndiana University contacted Wang in December to ask about a 2017-2018 grant in China that listed Wang as a researcher, according to an unsigned statement that appears to be written by a Purdue University professor and long-time collaborator of Wang seen by WIRED. The statement says that the author believed IU was concerned that Wang allegedly failed to properly disclose the funding to the university and in applications for US federal research grants.\n\nThe statement has been circulating among cybersecurity and privacy scholars at universities around the world in recent days and was sent to WIRED by three separate sources. It claims that Wang had explained the funding situation to IU, then was told in February that the school would continue looking into the matter.\n\nAlex Tanford, a professor emeritus at Indiana University and the IU Bloomington Chapter president of the American Association of University Professors, says Wang reached out to him and said that he had been accused of alleged research misconduct. Tanford says he provided Wang guidance as a member of the faculty board of review. IU did not answer WIRED’s questions regarding any probes into Wang.\n\n“The charge seemed trivial—that he had failed to properly disclose who was principal investigator on a grant application and had not fully listed all his coauthors on an article,” Tanford tells WIRED of the allegations. He says Wang wanted to know if the university had the right to lock him out of his office and computer, as he was in the middle of ongoing research.\n\nResearch papers Wang published between 2017 and 2018 list funding from places like the National Science Foundation, National Institutes of Health, the US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, the US Army Research Office, Google, and Samsung, according to a WIRED review of his publications from the time period.\n\nWang regularly collaborated with researchers at the Institute of Information Engineering (IIE) at the Chinese Academy of Sciences, a government-funded cybersecurity research lab. In papers, Wang and his coauthors disclosed that the IIE scholars received funding from sources such as the National Natural Science Foundation of China, but that Wang was being supported by US grants. It’s not uncommon for professors at US institutions to collaborate with researchers in China, and there's no public evidence to suggest that the arrangements were improper.\n\nAccording to the unsigned statement’s title and metadata, it appears to have been authored by Ninghui Li, a computer science professor at Purdue who has collaborated on research with Wang since at least 2006. The pair also serve together on the board of the ACM Special Interest Group on Security, Audit, and Control (SIGSAC), which aims “to develop the information security profession by sponsoring high quality research conferences and workshops,” according to the Association for Computer Machinery’s website. Li did not respond to emailed requests for comment nor a voicemail left on his office phone.",

        "source": "https://www.wired.com/",
        "content": "Executives at artificial intelligence companies may like to tell us that AGI is almost here, but the latest models still need some additional tutoring to help them be as clever as they can.\n\nScale AI, a company that’s played a key role in helping frontier AI firms build advanced models, has developed a platform that can automatically test a model across thousands of benchmarks and tasks, pinpoint weaknesses, and flag additional training data that ought to help enhance their skills. Scale, of course, will supply the data required.\n\nScale rose to prominence providing human labor for training and testing advanced AI models. Large language models (LLMs) are trained on oodles of text scraped from books, the web, and other sources. Turning these models into helpful, coherent, and well-mannered chatbots requires additional “post training” in the form of humans who provide feedback on a model’s output.\n\nScale supplies workers who are expert on probing models for problems and limitations. The new tool, called Scale Evaluation, automates some of this work using Scale’s own machine learning algorithms.\n\n“Within the big labs, there are all these haphazard ways of tracking some of the model weaknesses,” says Daniel Berrios, head of product for Scale Evaluation. The new tool “is a way for [model makers] to go through results and slice and dice them to understand where a model is not performing well,” Berrios says, “then use that to target the data campaigns for improvement.”\n\nBerrios says that several frontier AI model companies are using the tool already. He says that most are using it to improve the reasoning capabilities of their best models. AI reasoning involves a model trying to break a problem into constituent parts in order to solve it more effectively. The approach relies heavily on post-training from users to determine whether the model has solved a problem correctly.\n\nIn one instance, Berrios says, Scale Evaluation revealed that a model’s reasoning skills fell off when it was fed non-English prompts. “While [the model’s] general purpose reasoning capabilities were pretty good and performed well on benchmarks, they tended to degrade quite a bit when the prompts were not in English,” he says. Scale Evolution highlighted the issue and allowed the company to gather additional training data to address it.\n\nJonathan Frankle, chief AI scientist at Databricks, a company that builds large AI models, says that being able to test one foundation model against another sounds useful in principle. \"Anyone who moves the ball forward on evaluation is helping us to build better AI,\" Frankle says.\n\nIn recent months, Scale has contributed to the development of several new benchmarks designed to push AI models to become smarter, and to more carefully scrutinize how they might misbehave. These include EnigmaEval, MultiChallenge, MASK, and Humanity's Last Exam.\n\nScale says it is becoming more challenging to measure improvements in AI models, however, as they get better at acing existing tests. The company says its new tool offers a more comprehensive picture by combining many different benchmarks and can be used to devise custom tests of a model’s abilities, like probing its reasoning in different languages. Scale’s own AI can take a given problem and generate more examples, allowing for a more comprehensive test of a model’s skills.\n\nThe company’s new tool may also inform efforts to standardize testing AI models for misbehavior. Some researchers say that a lack of standardization means that some model jailbreaks go undisclosed.\n\nIn February, the US National Institute of Standards and Technologies announced that Scale would help it develop methodologies for testing models to ensure they are safe and trustworthy.\n\nWhat kinds of errors have you spotted in the outputs of generative AI tools?

        "title": "The Founder of OnlyFans Wants to Buy TikTok",
        "source": "https://www.wired.com/",
        "content": "Tim Stokely, founder of the adult content platform OnlyFans, has submitted an eleventh-hour proposal to buy TikTok’s US operations from its Chinese owner, ByteDance.\n\nThe “intent to bid” was made by Zoop—a social media startup Stokely cofounded with RJ Phillips, who serves as CEO and has a background in influencer marketing strategy—and cryptocurrency company The Hbar Foundation. For Zoop, the bid “represents a David vs. Goliath moment against traditional social media giants by endorsing a creator-first revolution,” according to a statement the company shared with WIRED. They said they want to put power back in the hands of creators through better revenue sharing.\n\nByteDance is up against the clock. If the company does not agree to a proposal from a US buyer by April 5, TikTok will be banned in the US under a law that went into effect in January citing national security concerns.\n\n“The process is actually very unique; it’s being run by the White House and not by ByteDance,” Phillips tells WIRED, declining to comment further on the particulars of how the Zoop bid came about. “Our external council found the right person for us to initiate conversations with and that's what we've done.” Stokely did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nOn Wednesday, President Donald Trump was scheduled to consider multiple offers during a closed-door Oval Office meeting with vice president JD Vance and US secretary of commerce Howard Lutnick, who are spearheading the sale. His plan to keep TikTok operating in the US was reportedly going to be announced late that day, according to The Information.\n\nThe US government’s concerns around TikTok purportedly stem from fears that the Chinese government could access Americans’ data. But partnering with Hbar could potentially work in Zoop's favor; the company’s statement says Hbar operates the Hedera network, “a secure, transparent, and enterprise-grade public ledger” blockchain technology based in the US.\n\nStokely and Phillips are perhaps the most surprising of the suitors gunning for control of the popular video app.\n\n“We’ve been looking at social for a long time, given our past. We want to restructure the industry in a way that we think is equitable,” Phillips tells WIRED, brushing away speculation that Zoop’s offer came together at the last minute. “Creators bring eyeballs to the pages, and therefore they should be the ones sharing in the lion’s share of the ad revenue. Users that are engaging with that content should also be the ones benefiting.”\n\nAmazon also put in a last-minute offer to buy TikTok this week, joining four other groups that the White House was considering for the sale of TikTok’s US operations, according to Reuters. According to the The New York Times, the Amazon bid is not being taken seriously. One of the other possible deals floating around, per the Times, includes bringing on a team of US investors that includes Larry Ellison’s Oracle and private equity firm Blackstone.\n\nThere is also the possibility that an American investment team purchases TikTok while ByteDance retains ownership of TikTok’s algorithm and leases it to the prospective buyer. China has given no indication that it would be willing to sell the app’s algorithm, and exporting that type of technology would require its sign-off as part of a host of restrictions introduced in 2020.\n\nPhillips says they are invested in building platforms that truly prioritize creators.\n\n“Tech platforms for businesses like this should merely be the facilitator for creators. Creators have a hard enough time making steady income,” he says. “For us it's always going to focus on creators first, and not on shareholders first.”\n\nWe will soon know whether or not the Trump administration aligns with that vision.",

        "title": "Nintendo Switch 2 Is Coming June 5 for $450",
        "source": "https://www.wired.com/",
        "content": "Nintendo has revealed that the long-awaited Switch 2 console, its successor to the phenomenally successful Nintendo Switch, will launch on June 5, 2025, with its key launch game being Mario Kart World, a new open-world entry in the beloved kart racing series.\n\nThe Switch 2 will go on sale for $450 in the US, or $500 with a download code for Mario Kart World included. In the UK it will be priced at £395 for the base console or £429 for the bundle, while Canadians can expect to pay $630 or $700 CAD, and Australians will be paying $699 or $769 AUD.\n\nLike the original, the Switch 2 remains a hybrid device, capable of on-the-go gaming in handheld form and connecting to a big-screen TV at home. However, it's bringing several key improvements over its predecessor.\n\nAfter an initial reveal back in January, which itself followed months of leaks, we now know that the Switch 2 will boast a larger 7.9-inch screen in handheld mode. Disappointingly, it's a return to an LCD display after the gorgeous OLED model for the original Switch, but it does see a bump in native resolution to 1080p and offers HDR for supported games. It's also capable of a frame rate up to 120 fps, though this will again depend on the game.\n\nAudio gets a boost too, with improved speakers and support for 3D audio (via headphones, although a system update is planned to offer support for this through the in-built speakers), and a microphone is built into the top of the console. Despite the bump in screen size and the addition of that mic, the handheld remains only 13.9-mm thick, though no mention was made of its weight.\n\nThe console boasts two USB-C ports, one on the top and one on the bottom. The latter will connect to the new dock—more on that in a second—while the top one can be used to either charge the console when used in handheld mode (a small but welcome improvement for anyone who's struggled to balance holding the Switch with a charger coming out of the base) or to connect peripherals.\n\nThe controllers are similarly revised, with the newly dubbed Joy-Con 2 controllers connecting via \"strong magnets,” with a release button to disconnect them. Confirming long-standing rumors, they'll also be able to be used as mouse controllers, while the SL/SR shoulder buttons incorporated onto them are now larger and easier to press when used as a single controller. Thumbsticks are also larger than before.\n\nThe right-hand Joy-Con 2 also sees the addition of a new C button, which will be used to bring up audio controls, allowing users to access new GameChat features using the mic. GameChat will allow users to speak openly, with noise-canceling tech cutting out background noise, while a new Nintendo Switch 2 Camera peripheral will allow onscreen group playing.\n\nScreen sharing will also be possible, again accessed from the C button menu, and you'll be able to shrink or enlarge other players’ screens, with an example shown of helping a lost player find their friends elsewhere in a game world. It all speaks to an even greater social focus for the Switch 2 (though it's worth noting that all those GameChat features will be require a Nintendo Switch Online subscription).",

        "source": "https://www.wired.com/",
        "content": "Top career officials at the Department of the Interior (DOI) were placed on administrative leave late last week after declining to immediately give affiliates of the so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) levels of access to a payroll system that would in theory allow them to, among other things, stop individual Supreme Court justices’ paychecks.\n\nThe New York Times has reported that these officials include the DOI’s chief information and information security officers; sources tell WIRED they also include a top lawyer.\n\nFor several weeks, say sources with direct knowledge of the situation, DOGE operatives have been seeking what they termed “full” or “system” access to the DOI’s payroll, human resources, and credentialing systems. Among the systems to which it demanded full access is the Federal Personnel and Payroll System (FPPS), which is housed in the DOI’s Interior Business Center and is used by dozens of federal agencies ranging from the Department of Justice to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to handle payroll and records associated with more than 275,000 federal workers, including at agencies outside the executive branch.\n\nThe DOGE associates in question are Tyler Hassen, an energy executive and acting assistant secretary of policy, management, and budget at DOI; Stephanie Holmes, who runs HR for DOGE and is the acting chief human capital officer at DOI; and Katrine Trampe, an adviser to Doug Burgum, the secretary of the interior.\n\nAccording to sources with direct knowledge, when asked why they sought full access to these systems, the DOGE operatives said they specifically sought levels of permissions that would give them the ability to create, pause, and delete email accounts. This functionality doesn’t, strictly speaking, exist for any one user within the systems they were seeking to access, because such actions are, as a security measure, designed to be initiated by one person and approved by another. Granting their request would thus require them each to be given an essentially God-mode level of access to the entire system architecture.\n\nAccording to sources and a risk assessment memorandum reviewed by WIRED and first reported on by the Times, top career officials saw several issues with granting these unprecedented levels of access.\n\nFirst, it raised an inherent security issue. No single person at DOI has root-level permissions to all the systems the DOGE operatives sought to access, which could allow them—or an outside actor who had compromised their credentials—to do anything from overwrite the code base to look at the W2s and other personal information of, or even stop payments to, individual federal workers. (According to one source, who cited The Atlantic’s recent reporting on top national security officials sharing sensitive military information in a Signal chat, a specific concern raised within the Department of the Interior was that DOGE affiliates might share the credentials in an insecure way, leading to a breach on par with the hack of the Office of Personnel Management a decade ago, in which tens of millions of federal personnel records were accessed by hackers linked to the Chinese government.)",

        "source": "https://www.wired.com/",
        "content": "This is a non-exhaustive list of places microplastics have been found: Mount Everest, the Mariana Trench, Antarctic snow, clouds, plankton, turtles, whales, cattle, birds, tap water, beer, salt, human placentas, semen, breast milk, feces, testicles, livers, brains, arteries, and blood.\n\nMy blood, specifically. In early March I milked a few drops out of my fingertips and sent the sample to be tested for microplastics. I was in the London office of Clarify Clinics—a firm that offers to cleanse your blood of microplastics, forever chemicals, and other toxins, in treatments that start at £9,750 ($12,636).\n\nEach week around 10 to 15 people walk into the basement clinic just off Harley Street—a road famed for its private clinics and wealthy clientele. After a consultation, the patients settle down in an armchair for the treatment. Blood is drawn from a cannula into a machine that separates out the plasma from blood cells. That plasma is filtered through a column that is supposed to trap microplastics and other undesirable chemicals, before being mixed back with the blood cells and pumped back into the patient. All-in-all the process runs for up to two hours—enough time to process 50 to 80 percent of the blood plasma volume.\n\n“Once it’s running, you feel nothing. It’s very comfortable,” says Yael Cohen, CEO of Clarify Clinic. “Patients take calls, do Zooms, watch movies, sleep. The ones who sleep are my favorite.” They come for all kinds of reasons, Cohen says: Some are suffering with chronic fatigue, others with brain fog or long Covid. The clinic also runs treatments marketed toward people on Ozempic-style weight-loss drugs, looking to conceive, or ward off dementia.\n\nWhat Clarify sells them is the hope of easing their symptoms by ridding their blood of microplastics, or other potential contaminants such as PFAS chemicals (per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances) and pesticides. But the science on how microplastics affect our health is still far from conclusive. A 2022 WHO report into microplastics concluded that there wasn’t yet enough evidence to figure out whether they posed a risk to human health. We don’t know microplastics are safe, the report concluded, but we also don’t know the risks they might pose.\n\n“The dose makes the poison,” says Frederic Béen, an environmental contaminants researcher at the Amsterdam Institute for Life and Environment. “That’s the reason why it is important to determine accurately how much microplastics or any other type of environmental contaminants humans are exposed to.”\n\nThere have been an onslaught of scientific papers that have tracked microplastics to every inch of the Earth’s surface and deep within our bodies, but very few attempt to tease out the impact these have on our health. A 2022 review article found that microplastics were associated with harm to human cells, but didn’t examine actual health outcomes in living humans. A study in 2024 found that people who had microplastics in the fatty plaque within their carotid arteries had a higher risk of heart attacks and strokes than people who didn’t have microplastics in their arteries.",

        "source": "https://www.wired.com/",
        "content": "A prominent computer scientist who has spent 20 years publishing academic papers on cryptography, privacy, and cybersecurity has gone incommunicado, had his professor profile, email account, and phone number removed by his employer, Indiana University, and had his homes raided by the FBI. No one knows why.\n\nXiaofeng Wang has a long list of prestigious titles. He was the associate dean for research at Indiana University's Luddy School of Informatics, Computing and Engineering, a fellow at the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers and the American Association for the Advancement of Science, and a tenured professor at Indiana University at Bloomington. According to his employer, he has served as principal investigator on research projects totaling nearly $23 million over his 21 years there.\n\nArs Technica This story originally appeared on Ars Technica, a trusted source for technology news, tech policy analysis, reviews, and more. Ars is owned by WIRED's parent company, Condé Nast.\n\nHe has also coauthored scores of academic papers on a diverse range of research fields, including cryptography, systems security, and data privacy, including the protection of human genomic data. I have personally spoken to him on three occasions for articles here, here, and here.\n\n“None of This Is in Any Way Normal”\n\nIn recent weeks, Wang's email account, phone number, and profile page at the Luddy School were quietly erased by his employer. Over the same time, Indiana University also removed a profile for his wife, Nianli Ma, who was listed as a lead systems analyst and programmer at the university's Library Technologies division.\n\nAs reported by The Bloomingtonian and later the The Herald-Times in Bloomington, a small fleet of unmarked cars driven by government agents descended on the Bloomington home of Wang and Ma on Friday. They spent most of the day going in and out of the house and occasionally transferred boxes from their vehicles. TV station WTHR, meanwhile, reported that a second home owned by Wang and Ma, located in Carmel, Indiana, was also searched. The station said that both a resident and an attorney for the resident were on scene during at least part of the search.\n\nAttempts to locate Wang and Ma have so far been unsuccessful. An Indiana University spokesman didn't answer emailed questions asking if the couple was still employed by the university and why their profile pages, email addresses, and phone numbers had been removed. The spokesman provided the contact information for a spokeswoman at the FBI's field office in Indianapolis. In an email, the spokeswoman wrote: “The FBI conducted court authorized law enforcement activity at homes in Bloomington and Carmel Friday. We have no further comment at this time.”\n\nSearches of federal court dockets turned up no documents related to Wang, Ma, or any searches of their residences. The FBI spokeswoman didn't answer questions seeking which US district court issued the warrant and when, and whether either Wang or Ma is being detained by authorities. Justice Department representatives didn't return an email seeking the same information. An email sent to a personal email address belonging to Wang went unanswered at the time this post went live. Their resident status (e.g., US citizens or green card holders) is currently unknown.\n\nFellow researchers took to social media over the weekend to register their concern over the series of events.\n\n“None of this is in any way normal,” Matthew Green, a professor specializing in cryptography at Johns Hopkins University, wrote on Mastodon. He continued: “Has anyone been in contact? I hear he’s been missing for two weeks and his students can’t reach him. How does this not get noticed for two weeks???”",

        "content": "After senior Trump administration members mistakenly included The Atlantic editor Jeffrey Goldberg in a secret group chat about bombing Houthi targets in Yemen, encrypted messaging app Signal found itself at the center of a storm this week. Some commentators criticized the app, going as far to blame it for the scandal.\n\nBut the whole affair that’s dubiously been dubbed “SignalGate” isn’t about Signal at all: Experts say officials shouldn’t invite untrusted contacts into sensitive chats and should only use authorized devices, platforms, and procedures when discussing top-secret military operations. In other words, the people who set up the chat made numerous mistakes, and they had nothing to do with how secure Signal is. In fact, Signal has seen its biggest-ever spike in US downloads as a result of the news.\n\nIn other news linked to that Houthi group chat, national security adviser Mike Waltz—an account with the name “Michael Waltz” originally invited Goldberg to the group—left his Venmo account open to public view. As WIRED reported, a “Michael Waltz” Venmo account displayed the names of the adviser’s colleagues and friends, revealing people in Waltz’s wider social network. After WIRED reached out to the White House, the Waltz account hid its friends list. There’s more though: WIRED also discovered other Venmo accounts linked to officials in the Signal chat. Information about who officials associate with could be highly lucrative for foreign spies and hackers.\n\nElsewhere, we reported on all the ways the White House adopting Elon Musk’s Starlink as an alternative Wi-Fi network could be bad news for network security. There are also early signs in Europe that some companies are going cold on cloud services from Google, Amazon, and Microsoft, as they reassess the risks of dealing with the volatile second Trump administration. And, as crossing the United States border becomes more perilous—for both citizens and visa holders—we updated our guide to keeping your digital privacy intact when you are entering the US.\n\nThat’s not all. Each week, we round up the security and privacy news we didn’t cover in depth ourselves. Click on the headlines to read the full stories. And stay safe out there.\n\nTop US Security Officials’ Passwords and Personal Phone Numbers Discovered Online\n\nOn top of SignalGate and Venmo accounts being left exposed, German news outlet Der Spiegel reported that sensitive personal information linked to several senior Trump administration security officials is easily discoverable online. Reporters from the publication found that mobile phone numbers, email addresses, and “some” passwords for top officials could be found on the internet.\n\nUsing people-search engines and information contained in public data breaches, Der Spiegel discovered personal information belonging to Waltz, director of national intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, and Pete Hegseth, the secretary of defense. “Most of these numbers and email addresses are apparently still in use, with some of them linked to profiles on social media platforms like Instagram and LinkedIn,” the news organization reported. The details were also linked to Dropbox, Microsoft Teams, Signal, and WhatsApp accounts used by the officials.",

        "source": "https://www.wired.com/",
        "content": "Organizers behind a pronatalist conference with far-right ties in Austin, Texas, this weekend have set up matchmaking events for attendees that include the option of getting married onsite as part of their greater effort to repopulate the world, WIRED has learned.\n\nAccording to its website, the sold-out Natal Conference, taking place March 28-29 at a hotel operated by the University of Texas at Austin, has “no political or ideological goal other than a world in which our children can have grandchildren.” But the event, an earlier version of which was promoted by Elon Musk, features speakers like Pizzagate conspiracy theorist Jack Posobiec and Crémieux, an online pseudonym linked, according to The Guardian, to Jordan Lasker, who discusses falling birthrates and promotes eugenics.\n\nNatal Conference organizer Kevin Dolan, a father of at least six, according to Politico, has previously stated that eugenics—the belief that white people are genetically superior—and the pronatalist movement are “very much aligned.”\n\nPublicly available details about the Natal Conference are scant, with the vague online conference agenda promising closed-door sessions to address collapsing birth rates.\n\nGot a Tip? Do you have tips about the pronatalist movement or other internet culture stories? We'd like to hear from you. Contact senior culture editor Manisha Krishnan securely on Signal at mkrishnan.79 or email manisha_krishnan@wired.com.\n\nHowever, an email obtained by WIRED promoting a preconference mixer held Thursday night reveals matchmaking may play a significant role at the conference and in the pronatalist movement more widely.\n\n“This is a special email to NatalCon attendees who indicated they were highly interested in finding the missing puzzle piece for singles, matchmaking, marriage, and family formation,” reads the email, sent by an event producer named Luke, who did not sign with his last name.\n\n“We were stunned to receive many emails saying, ‘NatalCon needs to be focusing on this, right now!’ And we're here to serve you. This is coming from all sectors: singles, parents with dating-age children, grandparents, newlyweds that want to help their friends start families, and more,” the email said.\n\nAttendees are instructed to register to learn the exact venue (though it is listed elsewhere on the website), and registration was listed as costing $10,000 for the full weekend—an increase from earlier this year when the cost was 90 percent cheaper. (A Saturday-only ticket is $500.) Last year’s VIP package was $1,000, according to the NatalCon website. After credit card details are handed over, organizers vet potential attendees, requiring them to submit their social media handles. The website says prospective attendees aren’t charged unless they’re approved.\n\nNatalCon organizers, including Dolan, did not respond to messages from WIRED seeking comment.\n\nSingle registrants are directed to fill out a survey that asks their desired number of children (listing 1 to over 7 as options), “religious, spiritual, cultural, lifestyle” values, and whether they would be open to a “Q&A with a NatalCon speaker to introduce yourself to the room.”\n\nSpeaking to Edward Dutton—who has been described as a “proponent of pseudo-scientific ‘race science,’” by anti-extremism group Hope Not Hate—on a Jolly Heretic podcast in 2023, Dolan described his alma mater, Brigham Young University, as a “breeding program” for smart Mormons. He said his pronatalist events are a counter to the “perverse incentives in the dating app market.”",

        "title": "Democratic Senators Call for Privacy Act Reform in Response to DOGE Takeover",
        "source": "https://www.wired.com/",
        "content": "In 1974, the United States Congress passed the Privacy Act in response to public concerns over the US government’s runaway efforts to harness Americans’ personal data. Now Democrats in the US Senate are calling to amend the half-century-old law, citing ongoing attempts by billionaire Elon Musk’s so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) to effectively commit the same offense—collusively collect untold quantities of personal data, drawing upon dozens if not hundreds of government systems.\n\nOn Monday, Democratic senators Ron Wyden, Ed Markey, Jeff Merkley, and Chris Van Hollen introduced the Privacy Act Modernization Act of 2025—a direct response, the lawmakers say, to the seizure by DOGE of computer systems containing vast tranches of sensitive personal information—moves that have notably coincided with the firings of hundreds of government officials charged with overseeing that data’s protection. “The seizure of millions of Americans’ sensitive information by Trump, Musk and other MAGA goons is plainly illegal,” Wyden tells WIRED, “but current remedies are too slow and need more teeth.”\n\nThe passage of the Privacy Act came in the wake of the McCarthy era—one of the darkest periods in American history, marked by unceasing ideological warfare and a government run amok, obsessed with constructing vast record systems to house files on hundreds of thousands of individuals and organizations. Secret dossiers on private citizens were the primary tool for suppressing free speech, assembly, and opinion, fueling decades’ worth of sedition prosecutions, loyalty oaths, and deportation proceedings. Countless writers, artists, teachers, and attorneys saw their livelihoods destroyed, while civil servants were routinely rounded up and purged as part of the roving inquisitions.\n\nThe first privacy law aimed at truly reining in the power of the administrative state, the Privacy Act was passed during the dawn of the microprocessor revolution, amid an emergence of high-speed telecommunications networks and “automated personal data systems.” The explosion in advancements coincided with Cassandra-like fears among ordinary Americans about a rise in unchecked government surveillance through the use of “universal identifiers.”\n\nA wave of such controversies, including Watergate and COINTELPRO, had all but annihilated public trust in the government’s handling of personal data. “The Privacy Act was part of our country’s response to the FBI abusing its access to revealing sensitive records on the American people,” says Wyden. “Our bill defends against new threats to Americans’ privacy and the integrity of federal systems, and ensures individuals can go after the government when officials break the law, including quickly stopping their illegal actions with a court order.”\n\nThe bill, first obtained by WIRED last week, would implement several textual changes aimed at strengthening the law—redefining, for instance, common terms such as “record” and “process” to more aptly comport with their usage in the 21st century. It further takes aim at certain exemptions and provisions under the Privacy Act that have faced decades’ worth of criticism by leading privacy and civil liberties experts.\n\nWhile the Privacy Act generally forbids the disclosure of Americans’ private records except to the “individual to whom the records pertain,” there are currently at least 10 exceptions that apply to this rule. Private records may be disclosed, for example, without consent in the interest of national defense, to determine an individual’s suitability for federal employment, or to “prevent, control, or reduce crime.” But one exception has remained controversial from the very start. Known as “routine use,” it enables government agencies to disclose private records so long as the reason for doing so is “compatible” with the purpose behind their collection.",

        "title": "The Worm That No Computer Scientist Can Crack",
        "source": "https://www.wired.com/",
        "content": "The Santa Ana winds were already blowing hard when I ran the first worm simulation. I’m no hacker, but it was easy enough: Open a Terminal shell, paste some commands from GitHub, watch characters cascade down the screen. Just like in the movies. I was scanning the passing code for recognizable words—neuron, synapse—when a friend came to pick me up for dinner. “One sec,” I yelled from my office. “I’m just running a worm on my computer.”\n\nAt the Korean restaurant, the energy was manic; the wind was bending palm trees at the waist and sending shopping carts skating across the parking lot. The atmosphere felt heightened and unreal, like a podcast at double speed. You’re doing, what, a cybercrime? my friend asked. Over the din, I tried to explain: No, not a worm like Stuxnet. A worm like Richard Scarry.\n\nBy the time I got home it was dark, and the first sparks had already landed in Altadena. On my laptop, waiting for me in a volumetric pixel box, was the worm. Pointed at each end, it floated in a mist of particles, eerily stick-straight and motionless. It was, of course, not alive. Still, it looked deader than dead to me. “Bravo,” said Stephen Larson, when I reached him later that night. “You have achieved the ‘hello world’ state of the simulation.”\n\nLarson is a cofounder of OpenWorm, an open source software effort that has been trying, since 2011, to build a computer simulation of a microscopic nematode called Caenorhabditis elegans. His goal is nothing less than a digital twin of the real worm, accurate down to the molecule. If OpenWorm can manage this, it would be the first virtual animal—and an embodiment of all our knowledge not only about C. elegans, which is one of the most-studied animals in science, but about how brains interact with the world to produce behavior: the “holy grail,” as OpenWorm puts it, of systems biology.\n\nUnfortunately, they haven’t managed it. The simulation on my laptop takes data culled from experiments done with living worms and translates it into a computational framework called c302, which then drives the simulated musculature of a C. elegans worm in a fluid dynamic environment—all in all, a simulation of how a worm squiggles forward in a flat plate of goo. It takes about 10 hours of compute time to generate five seconds of this behavior.\n\nSo much can happen in 10 hours. An ember can travel on the wind, down from the foothills and into the sleeping city. That night, on Larson’s advice, I tweaked the time parameters of the simulation, pushing beyond “hello world” and deeper into the worm’s uncanny valley. The next morning, I woke to an eerie orange haze, and when I pulled open my laptop, bleary-eyed, two things made my heart skip: Los Angeles was on fire. And my worm had moved.\n\nAt this point, you may be asking yourself a very reasonable question. Back at the Korean place, between bites of banchan, my friend had asked it too. The question is this: Uhh … why? Why, in the face of everything our precarious green world endures, of all the problems out there to solve, would anyone spend 13 years trying to code a microscopic worm into existence?",

        "title": "An AI Image Generator’s Exposed Database Reveals What People Really Used It For",
        "source": "https://www.wired.com/",
        "content": "Tens of thousands of explicit AI-generated images, including AI-generated child sexual abuse material, were left open and accessible to anyone on the internet, according to new research seen by WIRED. An open database belonging to an AI image-generation firm contained more than 95,000 records, including some prompt data and images of celebrities such as Ariana Grande, the Kardashians, and Beyoncé de-aged to look like children.\n\nThe exposed database, which was discovered by security researcher Jeremiah Fowler, who shared details of the leak with WIRED, is linked to South Korea–based website GenNomis. The website and its parent company, AI-Nomis, hosted a number of image generation and chatbot tools for people to use. More than 45 GB of data, mostly made up of AI images, was left in the open.\n\nThe exposed data provides a glimpse at how AI image-generation tools can be weaponized to create deeply harmful and likely nonconsensual sexual content of adults and child sexual abuse material (CSAM). In recent years, dozens of “deepfake” and “nudify” websites, bots, and apps have mushroomed and caused thousands of women and girls to be targeted with damaging imagery and videos. This has come alongside a spike in AI-generated CSAM.\n\n“The big thing is just how dangerous this is,” Fowler says of the data exposure. “Looking at it as a security researcher, looking at it as a parent, it’s terrifying. And it's terrifying how easy it is to create that content.”\n\nFowler discovered the open cache of files—the database was not password protected or encrypted—in early March and quickly reported it to GenNomis and AI-Nomis, pointing out that it contained AI CSAM. GenNomis quickly closed off the database, Fowler says, but it did not respond or contact him about the findings.\n\nNeither GenNomis nor AI-Nomis responded to multiple requests for comment from WIRED. However, hours after WIRED contacted the organizations, websites for both companies appeared to be shut down, with the GenNomis website now returning a 404 error page.\n\n“This example also shows—yet again—the disturbing extent to which there is a market for AI that enables such abusive images to be generated,” says Clare McGlynn, a law professor at Durham University in the UK who specializes in online- and image-based abuse. “This should remind us that the creation, possession, and distribution of CSAM is not rare, and attributable to warped individuals.”\n\nBefore it was wiped, GenNomis listed multiple different AI tools on its homepage. These included an image generator allowing people to enter prompts of images they want to create, or upload an image and include a prompt to alter it. There was also a face-swapping tool, a background remover, plus an option to turn videos into images.\n\n“The most disturbing thing, obviously, was the child explicit images and seeing ones that were clearly celebrities reimagined as children,” Fowler says. The researcher explains that there were also AI-generated images of fully clothed young girls. He says in those instances, it is unclear whether the faces used are completely AI-generated or based on real images.",

        "content": "In the late 2000s, McKenzie and the pioneering complexity theorist Stephen Cook devised a problem that seemed like a promising candidate. Called the tree evaluation problem, it involves repeatedly solving a simpler math problem that turns a pair of input numbers into a single output. Copies of this math problem are arranged in layers like the matches in a tournament bracket: The outputs of each layer become the inputs to the next layer until there’s just one output remaining. Different tree evaluation algorithms represent different strategies for calculating this final output from the initial inputs—they might perform the calculations in a different order, or record the results of intermediate steps in a different way.\n\nMany algorithms can solve the tree evaluation problem quickly, putting it in the class P. But every such algorithm must devote some memory to the numbers it’s working with, while also storing numbers it’s already calculated for use in later steps. That’s why Cook and McKenzie suspected that the problem was impossible to solve using limited memory. They formalized this intuition in a 2010 paper coauthored with three other researchers, and proved that every ordinary algorithm for solving the tree evaluation problem required too much memory to qualify for membership in L.\n\nBut their work didn’t rule out the possibility of bizarre algorithms that could somehow use the same piece of memory for storage and calculations simultaneously—the computing equivalent of using a page filled with important notes as scratch paper. Cook and McKenzie thought such outlandish algorithms couldn’t exist, and they were confident enough to put money on it: Anyone who could prove them wrong would win a cool $100.\n\nCatalytic Conversion\n\nMichal Koucký, a complexity theorist at Charles University in Prague, learned about the tree evaluation result from Cook during a 2011 sabbatical in Toronto. He grew determined to finish what Cook and McKenzie had started, by proving that there’s no way to do additional computations using memory that’s saving data for later. Koucký’s quest would lead him on an unexpected detour to the discovery of catalytic computing. Nearly a decade later, that discovery would inspire two young researchers to return to tree evaluation and settle Cook and McKenzie’s bet once and for all.\n\nBut back to the story of catalytic computing. It all started when Koucký visited colleagues in Amsterdam and posed the question that had been preoccupying him in simpler terms: What can you do with memory that’s already full?\n\n“Nothing” was the obvious answer. “I thought, ‘OK, this is of course very useless, and we’re going to prove it,’” said Harry Buhrman, the leader of the Amsterdam group. “And then we couldn’t prove it.”\n\nUsing an approach called catalytic computing, Harry Buhrman and Michal Koucký showed that even full memory could theoretically aid computation. Photograph: Bob Bronshoff/Quanta Magazine Photograph: Thomas Rubin/Quanta Magazine\n\nThe breakthrough came months later, when Buhrman was visiting his frequent collaborator Richard Cleve at the University of Waterloo. They decided to focus on an extreme scenario, one where the full memory is very large. If a computer with little free memory can access this massive full memory, would that enable it to solve problems that would be impossible with the free memory alone? It’s like the “hard drive full of family photos” question, but with a hard drive the size of a data center.\n\nIf that extra data is untouchable—you can’t interact with it at all—then it definitely doesn’t help. But what if you’re allowed to tweak some of the bits encoding this data, as long as you promise to reset them when you’re done? You can’t simply keep a record of your changes, since that would take up even more space, so instead you’ll have to ensure that your changes are easily reversible. What’s more, you don’t get to choose the content of the extra data, so whatever you do must work for any possible initial configuration of bits.",

        "content": "Jack Thorne wishes he could unsee some of the incel content he came across while doing research for his hit Netflix show Adolescence.\n\n(Spoiler alert: This piece contains plot details for Adolescence.)\n\nThe four-part limited series follows Jamie, a 13-year-old boy accused of murdering his classmate Katie in a northern England community. The ambiguity doesn’t last long—the final few minutes of the opening episode reveal that Jamie stabbed Katie to death. Each episode, shot unflinchingly in one take and focusing on different characters in Jamie’s life, interrogates the factors that led to this brutal crime, with online radicalization and bullying playing key roles. It’s a world Thorne, the show’s cocreator, had to get intimately familiar with to tell the story.\n\n“I went very, very deep,” Thorne says. “I went to places I wish I hadn’t gone to.”\n\nThe most disturbing part of his research wasn’t consuming content from men he referred to as “manosphere kings,” like alleged rapist Andrew Tate (Tate has denied the allegations), but rather small blogs from tweens and teens using incel ideology to explain why girls didn’t like them.\n\n“I knew as a teenager I'd have been attracted to [that] philosophy. I wouldn't have been drawn in like Jamie was drawn in, but I knew that there were elements of it that would've made real sense to me,” Thorne says. That’s when he knew he had a story on his hands.\n\nThe manosphere is an online universe of male, right-wing influencers who proffer misogynist advice on how to be more masculine and get laid—often reducing women to sexist stereotypes and blaming feminism for issues like male loneliness. Far from being an obscure ideology, manosphere rhetoric and high-profile leaders of the nebulous movement were highly influential in President Donald Trump’s reelection campaign. But Adolescence tells a more nuanced story, one that illustrates how the proliferation of this content can have a horrific impact. Its release has raised uncomfortable questions about adults’ limited understanding of the online lives of young people.\n\nManosphere teachings include lessons in how to pick up women after lowering their self-esteem, obsessive fitness routines, even pseudoscientific exercises for how to develop a more-defined jawline.\n\nThese influences are apparent in Jamie’s world. His rage at Katie stems from her rejecting his offer to go on a date—one he only made after she was slut-shamed at school—and subsequently calling him an incel on Instagram. He scoffs at the idea that boys and girls can be friends and seems desperate for the female psychologist evaluating him to like him—even as he tries to dominate her during their session. He craves the approval of his dad, who struggles to comfort him after he’s arrested.\n\nIn the second episode, which takes place at Jamie’s school, the detective investigating the case gets an earful about incel and red pill subcultures from his son, a student who bluntly tells his dad that he’s clueless when it comes to the motivations behind Katie’s murder. He raises the 80/20 rule, which posits that 80 percent of women are only attracted to 20 percent of men.",

        "content": "While Netflix seemingly led the way for other streaming networks to create compelling original programming, Hulu actually beat them all to the punch. In 2011, a year before Netflix’s Lilyhammer and two years before the arrival of House of Cards, the burgeoning streamer premiered The Morning After, a pop-culture-focused news show that ran for 800 episodes over three years, plus A Day in the Life, a docuseries from the late Oscar-winner Morgan Spurlock.\n\nHulu has continued to make TV history in the years since, most notably in 2017, when it became the first streamer to win an Emmy Award for Outstanding Drama Series with The Handmaid’s Tale (which will drop its long-awaited final season this month). In the years since, the streamer has continued to match—and often exceed—that high bar for quality entertainment with shows like The Bear, which took home 11 Emmys in 2024, and Shōgun, which recently set an Emmy record with 18 wins in a single season.\n\nWhile more competition has popped up since Hulu started gaining critical credibility, the network has continued to stand out for its carefully curated selection of original series and network partnerships that make it the home of FX series and more. Below are some of our favorite shows streaming on Hulu right now.\n\nNot finding what you’re looking for?

Learn more.\n\nThe Handmaid’s Tale\n\nWhen Margaret Atwood wrote The Handmaid’s Tale in 1985, little did she know that its television adaptation would revolutionize the still-nascent world of original streaming content. And she may not have anticipated just how many parallels her dystopian classic would share with the real world at the time it was adapted into an award-winning television series. It’s set in an unnamed time in what is presumably the very near future, when the United States has been taken over by a fundamentalist group known as Gilead, under whose regime women are considered property and stripped of any personal rights. The most valuable women are those who are fertile, as infertility has become an epidemic, and they are kept as handmaids who are forced to take part in sexual rituals with high-ranking couples in order to bear their children. Recognizing the power she wields, Offred, aka June Osborne (Elisabeth Moss), is not content to remain enslaved and sets about changing the rules as she seeks to reunite with her lost husband and daughter. It’s been a while since we’ve seen any new episodes of The Handmaid’s Tale; its most recent season aired in 2022. But its sixth, and final, season will arrive on April 8.\n\nBig Boys\n\nCreator Jack Rooke won a well-deserved BAFTA Award in 2024 for this semi-autobiographical dramedy about a closeted 19-year-old—also named Jack (Dylan Llewellyn)—who, after a year of mourning the death of his father at home with his overprotective mom, leaves for university. There, he’s paired up with Danny (Jon Pointing), a 25-year-old more interested in meeting women than studying, as his roommate. As Jack struggles to become comfortable with his sexuality, he also comes to understand the truth behind Danny’s seemingly extroverted personality. Yes, it’s a coming-of-age story and one in which opposites attract (on a purely platonic level). But it’s also a laugh-out-loud funny series that shows there is life after death.\n\nDeli Boys\n\nPakistani American brothers Mir (Asif Ali) and Raj (Saagar Shaikh) Dar have spent their entire lives wanting for nothing, thanks to the hard work of their father, who owns a chain of convenience stores. But after a freak accident kills dear old dad, the brothers are expected to take on the family business which, unbeknownst to them, is actually a front for a drug smuggling empire. While their antics are undoubtedly hilarious, the series does attempt to paint a truthful portrait of the immigrant experience—even if it’s often through an absurdist lens.\n\nA Thousand Blows\n\nIf Netflix’s Adolescence has you seeking out more of Stephen Graham’s work, check out Steven Knight’s A Thousand Blows—the Peaky Blinders creator’s newest British historical drama in which crime and violence collide. In this case it’s an all-female crime syndicate, the Forty Elephants, who are at the center of the action, with Mary Carr (Erin Doherty) as their leader. When Mary’s crew crosses notorious kingpin Sugar Goodson (Graham), she turns to Hezekiah Moscow (Malachi Kirby) and Alec Munroe (Francis Lovehall), two young men who have recently emigrated from Jamaica in order to make a better life for themselves, to help her escape Goodson’s wrath.\n\nDevil in the Family: The Fall of Ruby Franke\n\nIn 2015, thirtysomething Mormon mom of six Ruby Franke became one of YouTube’s most popular mommy vloggers with her channel, 8 Passengers. But as Franke’s popularity grew, so too did questions surrounding her punishment-prone style of parenting. Eight years later, Franke’s 12-year-old son showed up at a stranger’s door—looking emaciated and covered in open wounds and duct tape—asking the man to call the police as he was being abused. Franke’s roller-coaster ride from “perfect” mom to child abuser has been making headlines for years, but this three-part docuseries goes behind the scenes with exclusive interviews and footage that shed new light on the truth behind the tragedy.\n\nParadise\n\nThis Is Us creator Dan Fogelman reteams with that award-winning series’ star, Sterling K. Brown, for an intricate political thriller which plays with time to slowly reveal the details of a secret service agent (Brown) tasked with protecting the president (James Marsden) who ultimately becomes a suspect in the POTUS’ death. Expect many twists—including a massive one to kick off the series in episode 1.\n\nScamanda\n\n“Why would somebody fake cancer?” That’s the question asked—and that ABC News attempts to answer—in this true crime docuseries based on the podcast of the same name. The four-part special recounts the life and lies of Amanda C. Riley, a wife, mother, churchgoer, and popular mommy blogger who was celebrated for sharing her fight against Hodgkin’s lymphoma with the world … only to have it all blow up in her face.\n\nAccused\n\nLike a reverse engineered version of Law & Order, Accused—adapted by Homeland cocreator Howard Gordon from the acclaimed British series of the same name—follows the justice system from the perspective of the accused. Each episode begins with the defendant in the courtroom and recounts (via flashbacks) the circumstances that led them there. Like Dick Wolf’s iconic crime series, each episode is full of familiar faces, from Whitney Cummings and Wendell Pierce to Molly Parker and Margo Martindale.\n\nSay Nothing\n\nFact and fiction combine in this historical drama based on Patrick Radden Keefe’s novel that follows the lives of a group of people growing up in Belfast during the Troubles and their dealings with the Provisional IRA. Much of the story focuses on the Disappeared—a group of 16 people who went missing during the Troubles and were believed to have been kidnapped and murdered. Jean McConville was one of these individuals, both the only woman among them and the only Irish Catholic convert. Nearly 50 years later, many questions remain about these individuals. While Say Nothing doesn’t attempt to answer all of these questions, it does add fascinating context to the events.\n\nInterior Chinatown\n\nWillis Wu (Jimmy O. Yang) is a waiter who attempts to escape his humdrum life by imagining that he is a background actor in a Law & Order-esque TV show called Black & White. After Wu witnesses a kidnapping, police detective Lana Lee (Chloe Bennet) enlists him to help investigate and take down the local gangs in Chinatown—where he discovers something about his own family in the process. Nothing is what it seems in this meta comedy-crime series, which Charles Yu adapted from his own National Book Award–winning novel. The Daily Show’s Ronny Chieng ups the comedy as Wu’s coworker/BFF Fatty Choi, and Taika Waititi (one of the show’s executive producers) directs the pilot.\n\nWhat We Do in the Shadows\n\nIf you are in need of a laugh-out-loud comedy (and don’t mind if it’s of the sometimes R-rated kind), there are few better than What We Do in the Shadows. In 2014, Jemaine Clement and Taika Waititi cowrote, codirected, and costarred in a feature of the same name—a funny mockumentary featuring a group of vampires who share a home. This series, which premiered in 2019, moved the vampire action from New Zealand to Staten Island and brought in a whole new group of vampires—who struggle to even get up off the couch, let alone take over all of New York City (as they’ve been instructed to). After several years, they finally seem ready to get around to the task. All six seasons of the series, which wrapped up its run in December, are available for streaming.\n\nLa Máquina\n\nGael García Bernal and Diego Luna have been close friends since childhood, and it shows in the work they’ve done together—most famously in Alfonso Cuarón’s Oscar-nominated Y Tu Mamá También (2001). More than two decades later, their onscreen chemistry is still potent, as evidenced by this Spanish-language boxing drama. Esteban (Bernal) is an aging boxer whose manager/BFF Andy (Luna) persuades him to step into the ring one last time before he officially retires. But as the match looms closer, the criminal underbelly of the sport rears its head—forcing Esteban to determine what parts of his life he’s willing to sacrifice. With just six episodes in all, La Máquina moves fast. Don’t flinch.\n\nRivals\n\nThough David Tennant rose to fame playing Doctor Who’s lovably quirky Tenth Doctor, he’s often at his best when he gets to play a bit of a conniving asshole. In Rivals, Tennant clearly relishes the opportunity. Based on Jilly Cooper’s 1988 novel, and set two years before then, it tells the story of two very powerful men and neighbors—Lord Tony Baddingham (Tennant) and Tory MP Rupert Campbell-Black (Alex Hassell)—whose ongoing rivalry brings to mind the over-the-top nighttime soaps of that decade, including Dallas and Dynasty. Like those iconic American series, Rivals is more shock-driven than plot-driven, with its campiness (and lots and lots of sex between people who are married to other people) being part of the point. At its heart, it’s a class warfare story in which the tensions between bona fide aristocrat/rogue Campbell-Black and new-money-who-married-into-old-money media mogul Baddingham boil over for all to see. Especially after Baddingham, who owns a television network, poaches popular TV presenter Declan O'Hara (Aidan Turner) from the BBC and enlists fish-out-of-water American TV producer Cameron Cook (Nafessa Williams) to help keep him on top.\n\nHow to Die Alone\n\nFormer Saturday Night Live and Insecure writer Natasha Rothwell—whom you might know from her Emmy-nominated turn as spa manager Belinda in seasons 1 and 3 of The White Lotus—created and stars in this eight-episode series. Mel (Rothwell) is an employee at New York City’s JFK Airport who is content with the uneventful life she has built for herself. But when she has a sudden brush with death, she decides to take her life into her own hands. While it’s not the first series to explore matters of life and death, it does so in a way that is both beautifully nuanced and laugh-out-loud funny—all of it anchored by Rothwell’s performance. On February 4, Hulu announced that it had canceled the series after one season—a move that has Rothwell “baffled” and looking for a new network to produce season 2.\n\nEnglish Teacher\n\nTelevision audiences are hardly lacking in high school–set comedies, or in really great high school–set comedies, and/or really great high school–set comedies that focus on the teacher perspective (see: Abbott Elementary). English Teacher fits into that elite niche. Brian Jordan Alvarez—who was behind the award-winning 2016 web series The Gay and Wondrous Life of Caleb Gallo—both created and stars in the show, in which he portrays an English teacher in Austin, Texas, who is dedicated to making an impact on his students, even if he sometimes needs to depend on their teenage wisdom to figure out the right way to do that. While it doesn’t shy away from the politics that exist in the teaching profession, the series—which has already been renewed for another season—also presents the “adults” as often just as lost as the kids they teach.\n\nOnly Murders in the Building\n\nSteve Martin, Martin Short, and Selena Gomez make for a delightful trio of true-crime-obsessed podcast fans who, in season 1 of this original Hulu series, decide to join forces and create their own podcast while attempting to solve the mysterious death of a fellow resident of their Manhattan apartment building. From the very beginning of their odd alliance, it’s been clear that all is not what it seems, and everyone is keeping secrets. Now they’ve upped the ante on guest stars, too; the third season saw Paul Rudd and Meryl Streep join in the fun. Streep returned for the show’s fourth season, and was joined by Eugene Levy, Kumail Nanjiani, Tina Fey, Melissa McCarthy, Zach Galifianakis, and Eva Longoria. Season 5 is already in the works, with Renée Zellweger, Christoph Waltz, and Keegan-Michael Key among the already-confirmed guest stars.\n\nSolar Opposites\n\nThis animated sci-fi comedy, which premiered in 2020, is about a family of aliens from the planet Shlorp who crash-land on Earth—for better or worse. The show is rooted in the idea that humans are, well, weird. Which seems appropriate given this current moment in time. Yet, in between the laughs and occasional threat to humanity, it maintains a positive outlook on the world and the people who inhabit it. Which is something we could probably all use right about now. The show’s sixth season, which is expected to premiere in the fall, will also be its last.\n\nMarvel’s Hit-Monkey\n\nHit-Monkey may not be Marvel’s best known character, but this action-packed animated series is helping change that. As the title indicates, the story centers around Hit-Monkey (Fred Tatasciore), a snow monkey intent on taking out the Tokyo underworld with the help of his mentor, Bryce Fowler (Jason Sudeikis). Oh, and Bryce is a ghost—and a former assassin.\n\nFuturama\n\nFollowing a decade-long hiatus, Futurama—Matt Groening and David X. Cohen’s animated sci-fi comedy—made a triumphant return in 2023, complete with gags about Twilight Zone and “Momazon” drone deliveries. Now is the perfect time to dive back in—or watch it all for the first time. All 12 seasons of the series are currently available for streaming and and Hulu has confirmed that at least two more seasons are on the way (with the next one tentatively scheduled to premiere in July).\n\nWe Were the Lucky Ones\n\nIn Radom, Poland, the Kurcs are a loving family who seem to have it all—until the horrors of the Holocaust invade the serenity of their everyday lives. As World War II arrives on their doorstep, the family is separated—escaping to France, Brazil, West Africa, and Russia. Some are in hiding, others in concentration camps. But they’re all focused on one goal: surviving the war and reuniting with each other.\n\nThe Bear\n\nCarmen “Carmy” Berzatto (Jeremy Allen White) is a superstar of the fine dining world who has returned to his hometown of Chicago to save his family’s struggling sandwich shop after his brother’s death by suicide. While Carmy initially struggles to acclimate himself to being home and to his inherited kitchen’s back-to-basics style, he eventually realizes that it’s not too late to change both himself and the restaurant. Anyone who has ever worked in a busy kitchen knows the stress that comes with it, and The Bear does an excellent job of making that tension palpable—as evidenced by its slew of aforementioned Emmy Awards. While the plot sounds simple enough, much of Carmy’s previous life is a bit of a mystery, and it’s doled out in amuse-bouche-sized bits throughout the series with top-tier guest stars you may not have seen coming (fact: Jamie Lee Curtis has never been better, as evidenced by her recent—and very first—Emmy win). Prepare to feast.\n\nQueenie\n\nQueenie Jenkins (Dionne Brown) is a Jamaican-British twentysomething whose world is thrown into an upheaval following an ugly breakup with her boyfriend. That messiness follows Queenie into the next chapter in her life, when she attempts to pick up the pieces of her failed relationship while frequently butting heads with her family and trying to reconcile her dual cultures. Candice Carty-Williams adapts her own bestselling novel to create a poignant dramedy that’s ultimately about trauma and healing.\n\nBlack Twitter: A People’s History\n\nIn the late 2000s—back when Elon Musk was just that car-and-spaceship billionaire—Twitter was more than a social media network. It was a genuine gathering place for people to find their people, whether that was Film Twitter or Cat Twitter. For Black Twitter, it was a lot more. This three-part docuseries, based on WIRED senior writer Jason Parham’s 2021 cover story, recounts the most important moments and movements that helped solidify the Black Twitter community’s place as a cultural force in the world, from politics and beyond.\n\nUnder the Bridge\n\nWelcome to your new true crime obsession. Riley Keough and Lily Gladstone (who earned an Emmy nomination for her work in the show) make a formidable duo as an author and a police officer, respectively, investigating the brutal murder of a 14-year-old girl in a small town in Canada. The limited series is based on Rebecca Godfrey’s award-winning 2005 book of the same name (with Keough portraying Godfrey), and is a haunting reminder of what human beings are capable of.\n\nShōgun\n\nGame of Thrones fans still lamenting the loss of one of television's great epics have found their new favorite binge-watch in Shōgun, which took home a record 18 Emmys (with 25 nods altogether) in 2024. This 10-episode series, based on James Clavell’s beloved novel (which was first adapted into a miniseries in 1980), is a brilliant and sweeping tale of political rivalry in feudal Japan where Lord Yoshii Toranaga (Hiroyuki Sanada), a powerful warrior, has a target put on his back by his political rivals in the Council of Regents. Fortunately for Toranaga, he’s got Toda Mariko (Anna Sawai), a talented translator and fiercely loyal samurai, by his side. Though it was originally positioned as a one-and-done limited series, FX and Hulu have already confirmed that both seasons two and three are in the works.\n\nSuch Brave Girls\n\nComedian/actress Kat Sadler created and stars in this deeply messy, darkly funny story of a totally dysfunctional family—mom Deb (Sherlock’s Louise Brealey) and daughters Josie (Sadler) and Billie (Lizzie Davidson, Sadler’s real-life sister)—attempting to pick up the pieces after their husband/father leaves them. It’s cringe-comedy at its finest, and the kind that will appeal to fans of Fleabag. A second season is in the works, and expected to premiere later this year.\n\nAbbott Elementary\n\nQuinta Brunson created and stars in this hit series, which follows the daily lives—in and out of the classroom—of a group of teachers at what is widely considered one of the worst public schools in America. Despite a lack of funding for even basic educational necessities, and school district leaders who only care about the barest minimum standards, these educators are united by their drive to surpass expectations and encourage their students to do the same. The series is currently in its fourth season, with season 5 already confirmed.\n\nFargo\n\nNoah Hawley’s anthology series isn’t the first attempt to adapt the Coen brothers’ Oscar-winning crime-comedy to the small screen (Edie Falco starred in a previous version, which was a more straightforward adaptation of the movie), but his approach was clearly the smarter move. Fans of the Coens in general will find lots to love about the many nods to the filmmakers’ entire filmography, with each season covering a different crime and time period. Though the seasons do share connections, each one is a total one-off, and the show might boast the most talented group of actors ever assembled: Billy Bob Thornton, Martin Freeman, Bob Odenkirk, Oliver Platt, Ted Danson, Patrick Wilson, Nick Offerman, Kirsten Dunst, Jesse Plemons, Ewan McGregor, Michael Stuhlbarg, Carrie Coon, Scoot McNairy, Chris Rock, Jason Schwartzman, Timothy Olyphant, and Ben Whishaw are just a few of the names who’ve found a home in Fargo. The fantastic fifth season—featuring Juno Temple, Jon Hamm, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Joe Keery, and Lamorne Morris (who won an Emmy for his role)—continued this tradition of exceptional acting, with all episodes streaming now.\n\nA Murder at the End of the World\n\nDarby Hart (Emma Corrin) is a talented hacker and armchair detective who is one of eight guests invited to spend a few days at the stunning yet remote home of a mysterious billionaire (Clive Owen). When one of the guests ends up dead, Darby must work quickly to prove that it was murder—and who did it—before the bodies start piling up. Fans of twisty true crime will appreciate this limited series, which comes from the minds of Brit Marling (who costars) and Zal Batmanglij—cocreators of the equally mind-bending The OA.\n\nMoonlighting\n\nWhile Die Hard turned Bruce Willis into one of Hollywood’s biggest action stars, he was far from producers’ first choice for the role of John McClane. That’s largely because he was seen as the funny guy from Moonlighting, the Emmy-winning ’80s dramedy that centers around the Blue Moon Detective Agency and its two often-bickering owners, David Addison (Willis) and Maddie Hayes (Cybill Shepherd). Over the course of its five seasons, the series racked up some serious critical acclaim and wasn’t afraid to experiment with the sitcom format.\n\nThe Other Black Girl\n\nSinclair Daniel shines as Nella Rogers, an up-and-coming book editor—and the only Black employee at the publishing house where she works. While Nella is initially thrilled when another young woman of color, Hazel-May McCall (Ashleigh Murray), is hired as an assistant, she can’t help but notice that a series of bizarre events seems to follow. As Nella tries to suss out exactly what is going on, she uncovers some pretty damn disturbing skeletons in her employer’s closet. While horror-comedies are an increasingly popular movie genre, we don’t see them on the small screen quite as often—which, if this clever series is any indication, is a real shame. Also unfortunate: One season is all we’ll get of The Other Black Girl.\n\nThe Full Monty\n\nTwenty-six years after a low-budget British comedy blew up at the box office, scored an Oscar, and introduced “the Full Monty” into the popular lexicon, the Regular Joes turned strippers from Sheffield are back to face largely the same issues they were lamenting in the original feature film. Much of the main cast reassembled for this follow-up to Peter Cattaneo’s hit 1997 movie, including two-time Oscar nominee Tom Wilkinson, who passed away in late December. Stripping is involved, as are other inevitables in life, including breakups, reconciliations, and death. For fans of the original movie—or the Broadway musical and stage play that followed—it’s a fun check-in with the characters who bared it all.\n\nThe Office (UK)\n\nYears before there was Jim and Pam and Dwight and Michael, there were Tim and Dawn and Gareth and David. For lovers of cringe, it’s hard to do better than Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant’s workplace comedy. David Brent (Gervais) is the original boss from hell, whose office antics will have you covering your eyes and laughing out loud at the same time. Like many British series, there are just two seasons—each consisting of a mere six episodes—plus a two-part Christmas special. Don’t be surprised if you sit down to watch a single episode and binge it all in one go.\n\nCheers\n\nIn the 1980s, NBC was the channel to watch on Thursday nights—in large part thanks to Cheers. The bar where everybody knows your name is where the action happens in this award-winning sitcom about a former Red Sox player (Ted Danson) and the lovable employees and patrons who treat his bar like a second home. If you can look past (or, even better, embrace) the questionable ’80s fashion and sometimes-sexist storylines that wouldn’t necessarily fly on TV today, you’ll find what is arguably one of the smartest sitcoms ever written. More than 40 years after its original premiere, the jokes still stand up and the characters are some of television’s most memorable (and beloved) for a reason.\n\nDopesick\n\nBack in 2021, Hulu went where Netflix’s Painkiller went in 2023: to the late ’90s and early 2000s, aka the beginning of America’s opioid crisis. Danny Strong created this retelling of the lengths to which Richard Sackler (played here by the always excellent Michael Stuhlbarg) and Purdue Pharma would go to sell doctors on the powers of OxyContin—all with the promise of no addiction. Michael Keaton won an Emmy for his portrayal of a widowed doctor in Appalachia who buys into the lies, and eventually becomes a victim of them.\n\nReservation Dogs\n\nTaika Waititi and Sterlin Harjo cocreated this Peabody Award–winning series, which made history as the first mainstream TV show created by, starring, and crewed by an almost entirely Indigenous American team. It tells the story of four bored teens who are desperate to escape their lives on a reservation in Oklahoma. They decide that California is where they want to be and commit to a life of mostly petty crimes in order to save up enough money to leave. The full series is available to watch now, including the brilliant third season sendoff.\n\nThe Great\n\nElle Fanning and Nicholas Hoult shine in this witty, fast-paced, comedic retelling (but not really) of Catherine the Great’s rise to power. Created by Tony McNamara, who earned Oscar nominations for his writing work on both The Favourite and Poor Things, The Great offers the same combination of lush costumes and scenery mixed with a biting commentary on the world, and a woman’s place in it. A story that rings as true today as it did in the 18th century, when Catherine the Great became empress of Russia and brought about the Age of Enlightenment, this show chips away at notions of class, propriety, and monarchical rule in a way few others do. If it’s historical accuracy you’re after, look elsewhere; the series’ creators describe it as decidedly “anti-historical” (which is part of the fun). All three seasons are available to stream.\n\nTiny Beautiful Things\n\nThe reason to watch this eight-part limited series can be summed up in two words: Kathryn Hahn. A comedic juggernaut, Hahn can switch from funny to dramatic in the same scene, if not the same sentence. This talent is on display in Tiny Beautiful Things, where she plays Claire, a writer who takes up an advice column and pours all the traumas of her life into responding to her readers. Based on Wild author Cheryl Strayed’s collection of “Dear Sugar” columns, the vignettes here may be a bit out of sorts, but Hahn pulls them together.\n\nDave\n\nDave Burd is a comedian and rapper who goes by the stage name Lil Dicky. In Dave, Burd plays a rapper who goes by the stage name Lil Dicky and is attempting to raise his profile and make a much bigger name for himself. If only his many neuroses didn’t keep getting in the way. While Dave could have easily turned into some mediocre experiment in meta storytelling, Burd—who cocreated the series, stars in it, and has written several episodes—grapples with some surprisingly touchy topics, including mental illness. And he does it all with a level of sensitivity and honesty that you might not expect from a guy named Lil Dicky. Despite the show’s popularity and critical acclaim, the three seasons currently streaming may be all we get of Dave. In early 2024, Burd announced that he’d be pressing “pause” on the series in order to explore other creative ventures. (But never say never.)\n\nAtlanta\n\nDonald Glover proved himself to be a quadruple threat of an actor, writer, musician, and comedian with this highly acclaimed FX series about Earnest “Earn” Marks (Glover), an aspiring music manager who is trying to help his cousin Alfred Miles, aka Paper Boi (Brian Tyree Henry), kick off his musical career. They’re surrounded by a supportive crew of friends, including Alfred’s BFF, Darius (LaKeith Stanfield), and Van (Zazie Beetz), Earn’s close friend and the mother of his child. This makes it all sound like a fairly straightforward buddy comedy, but Atlanta is so much more. Even better: It’s weird. Glover is not afraid to experiment with storytelling, which is part of what makes the show so compelling.\n\nBaskets\n\nZach Galifianakis stars alongside Zach Galifianakis as twin brothers Chip and Dale Baskets in this unexpectedly moving family comedy about an aspiring clown (Chip) who fails to graduate from a fancy clowning school in Paris and is forced to return home to Bakersfield, California, where he lives with his mother (the late Louie Anderson) and is constantly belittled by his higher-achieving brother (Dale). Between the dual role for Galifianakis and Anderson as the mom, it may sound like a cheap bit of stunt casting that can’t sustain more than an episode, let alone multiple character arcs. But if you’re a fan of absurdist comedy, Baskets truly ranks among the best of them. And Anderson, who won his first and only Emmy for his role as Costco-loving Christine, is absolutely transcendent. While it received a fair amount of critical acclaim, Baskets could rightly be considered one of the most underseen and underappreciated series in recent memory.\n\nThe Dropout\n\nAmanda Seyfried won a much deserved Outstanding Lead Actress Emmy for her portrayal of the notorious Stanford dropout turned health care technology maven Elizabeth Holmes, who tricked some of the world’s savviest business minds into investing in her company, Theranos. While Holmes’ goal was altruistic enough—making health care more accessible to the masses via a device that could detect any number of diseases with little more than a single finger prick of blood—the technology wasn’t able to catch up. Rather than admit defeat, she kept pushing, making business deals and promises she could never fulfill.\n\nIt’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia\n\nIf you thought the characters on Seinfeld were terrible people, wait until you meet the gang from Paddy’s Pub. For nearly 20 years, Dennis (Glenn Howerton), Mac (Robert McElhenney), Charlie (Charlie Day), Sweet Dee (Kaitlin Olson), and Frank (Danny DeVito) have unapologetically plotted against each other and total strangers in a series of completely self-centered schemes with absolutely no regard for the rules of civility. The show follows the “no hugging and no learning” rule Larry David established for Seinfeld, but elevates it to a new level of sociopathy. “Dennis and Dee Go on Welfare,” “Sweet Dee Has a Heart Attack,” “How Mac Got Fat,” “Dennis Looks Like a Registered Sex Offender,” “The Gang Turns Black,” and “The Gang Goes to a Water Park” are just some of the offbeat adventures awaiting viewers. In 2021, Sunny became the longest-running live-action sitcom in the history of television, and it shows no signs of slowing down—or taking it easy on its characters. It also happens to be one of the easiest shows to binge: Pop an episode on and, without even realizing it, you’ll be on to another season. Its 16th (!!) wrapped up in 2023—but there are at least two more on the way, with the next one set to arrive in June.\n\nLetterkenny\n\nWhat began as a web series is now a Hulu original that wrapped up its eleventh season in December. The show is a portrait of small-town Canada (the fictional Letterkenny of the title) and focuses on siblings Wayne (cocreator Jared Keeso) and Katy (Michelle Mylett), who run a produce stand with help from friends Daryl (Nathan Dales) and Squirrely Dan (K. Trevor Wilson). As is often the case in small-town series, many of the residents fall into specific categories—in Letterkenny, you could be a gym rat, a hick, a skid (their word for a drug addict), or a “native” (a member of the nearby First Nation reservation). But in contrast to many small-town series, these groups—and the individuals who comprise them—aren’t reduced to meaningless stereotypes.\n\nThe Patient\n\nSteve Carell plays against type—or is at least nothing like The Office’s Michael Scott—in this psychological thriller from Joel Fields and The Americans creator Joe Weisberg. Carell is Alan Strauss, a therapist being held captive by his patient (Domhnall Gleeson), who cops to being a serial killer and desperately wants Strauss to “cure” his desire to kill. The series plays out like one big-bottle episode; much of the action occurs in a single room, with Carell and Gleeson speaking only to each other—each trying to determine his best next move.\n\nPen15\n\nMining the awkwardness of one’s middle school years is hardly a new comedy concept. But being in your early thirties and playing yourself as a junior high school student and then surrounding yourself with age-appropriate actors who are actually going through that hellish rite of passage brings a whole new layer of cringe and humor. This is exactly what cocreators/stars Maya Erskine and Anna Konkle did for Pen15.",

        "content": "When Dario Amodei gets excited about AI—which is nearly always—he moves. The cofounder and CEO springs from a seat in a conference room and darts over to a whiteboard. He scrawls charts with swooping hockey-stick curves that show how machine intelligence is bending toward the infinite. His hand rises to his curly mop of hair, as if he’s caressing his neurons to forestall a system crash. You can almost feel his bones vibrate as he explains how his company, Anthropic, is unlike other AI model builders. He’s trying to create an artificial general intelligence—or as he calls it, “powerful AI”—that will never go rogue. It’ll be a good guy, an usher of utopia. And while Amodei is vital to Anthropic, he comes in second to the company’s most important contributor. Like other extraordinary beings (Beyoncé, Cher, Pelé), the latter goes by a single name, in this case a pedestrian one, reflecting its pliancy and comity. Oh, and it’s an AI model. Hi, Claude!\n\nAmodei has just gotten back from Davos, where he fanned the flames at fireside chats by declaring that in two or so years Claude and its peers will surpass people in every cognitive task. Hardly recovered from the trip, he and Claude are now dealing with an unexpected crisis. A Chinese company called DeepSeek has just released a state-of-the-art large language model that it purportedly built for a fraction of what companies like Google, OpenAI, and Anthropic spent. The current paradigm of cutting-edge AI, which consists of multibillion-dollar expenditures on hardware and energy, suddenly seemed shaky.\n\nAmodei is perhaps the person most associated with these companies’ maximalist approach. Back when he worked at OpenAI, Amodei wrote an internal paper on something he’d mulled for years: a hypothesis called the Big Blob of Compute. AI architects knew, of course, that the more data you had, the more powerful your models could be. Amodei proposed that that information could be more raw than they assumed; if they fed megatons of the stuff to their models, they could hasten the arrival of powerful AI. The theory is now standard practice, and it’s the reason why the leading models are so expensive to build. Only a few deep-pocketed companies could compete.\n\nNow a newcomer, DeepSeek—from a country subject to export controls on the most powerful chips—had waltzed in without a big blob. If powerful AI could come from anywhere, maybe Anthropic and its peers were computational emperors with no moats. But Amodei makes it clear that DeepSeek isn’t keeping him up at night. He rejects the idea that more efficient models will enable low-budget competitors to jump to the front of the line. “It’s just the opposite!” he says. “The value of what you’re making goes up. If you’re getting more intelligence per dollar, you might want to spend even more dollars on intelligence!” Far more important than saving money, he argues, is getting to the AGI finish line. That’s why, even after DeepSeek, companies like OpenAI and Microsoft announced plans to spend hundreds of billions of dollars more on data centers and power plants.\n\nWhat Amodei does obsess over is how humans can reach AGI safely. It’s a question so hairy that it compelled him and Anthropic’s six other founders to leave OpenAI in the first place, because they felt it couldn’t be solved with CEO Sam Altman at the helm. At Anthropic, they’re in a sprint to set global standards for all future AI models, so that they actually help humans instead of, one way or another, blowing them up. The team hopes to prove that it can build an AGI so safe, so ethical, and so effective that its competitors see the wisdom in following suit. Amodei calls this the Race to the Top.\n\nThat’s where Claude comes in. Hang around the Anthropic office and you’ll soon observe that the mission would be impossible without it. You never run into Claude in the café, seated in the conference room, or riding the elevator to one of the company’s 10 floors. But Claude is everywhere and has been since the early days, when Anthropic engineers first trained it, raised it, and then used it to produce better Claudes. If Amodei’s dream comes true, Claude will be both our wing model and fairy godmodel as we enter an age of abundance. But here’s a trippy question, suggested by the company’s own research: Can Claude itself be trusted to play nice?\n\nOne of Amodei’s Anthropic cofounders is none other than his sister. In the 1970s, their parents, Elena Engel and Riccardo Amodei, moved from Italy to San Francisco. Dario was born in 1983 and Daniela four years later. Riccardo, a leather craftsman from a tiny town near the island of Elba, took ill when the children were small and died when they were young adults. Their mother, a Jewish American born in Chicago, worked as a project manager for libraries.",

        "source": "https://www.wired.com/",
        "content": "Israeli historian and philosopher Yuval Noah Harari’s book Sapiens became an international bestseller by presenting a view of history driven by the fictions created by mankind. His later work Homo Deus then depicted the a future for mankind brought about by the emergence of superintelligence. His latest book, Nexus: A Brief History of Information Networks From the Stone Age to AI, is a warning against the unparalleled threat of AI.\n\nA rising trend of techno-fascism driven by populism and artificial intelligence has been visible since the US presidential election in November. Nexus, which was published just a few months earlier, is a timely explainer of the potential consequences of AI on democracy and totalitarianism. In the book, Harari does not just sound the alarm on singularity—the hypothetical future point at which technology, particularly AI, moves beyond human control and advances irreversibly on its own—but also on AI’s foreignness.\n\nThis interview was conducted by Michiaki Matsushima, editor in chief of WIRED Japan, and was also recorded for “The Big Interview” YouTube series for the Japanese edition of WIRED, scheduled to be released in April 2025. The interview has been edited for clarity and length.\n\nPhotograph: Shintaro Yoshimatsu\n\nWIRED: In the late ’90s, when the internet began to spread, there was a discourse that this would bring about world peace. It was thought that with more information reaching more people, everyone would know the truth, mutual understanding would be born, and humanity would become wiser. WIRED, which has been a voice of change and hope in the digital age, was part of that thinking at the time. In your new book, Nexus, you write that such a view of information is too naive. Can you explain this?\n\nYUVAL NOAH HARARI: Information is not the same as truth. Most information is not an accurate representation of reality. The main role information plays is to connect many things, to connect people. Sometimes people are connected by truth, but often it is easier to use fiction or illusion.\n\nThe same is true of the natural world. Most of the information that exists in nature is not meant to tell the truth. We are told that the basic information underlying life is DNA, but is DNA true? No. DNA connects many cells together to make a body, but it does not tell us the truth about anything. Similarly, the Bible, one of the most important texts in human history, has connected millions of people together, but not necessarily by telling them the truth.\n\nWhen information is in a complete free market, the vast majority of information becomes fiction, illusion, or lies. This is because there are three main difficulties with truth.\n\nFirst of all, telling the truth is costly. On the other hand, creating fiction is inexpensive. If you want to write a truthful account of history, economics, physics, et cetera, you need to invest time, effort, and money in gathering evidence and fact-checking. With fiction, however, you can simply write whatever you want.",

        "content": "Over the weekend, thousands of people joined the “Tesla Takedown” protest movement at the company’s showrooms across the country. At the same time, a much smaller number of Elon Musk supporters turned out at Tesla locations for a counterprotest movement that some participants dubbed “Tesla Shield.”\n\nWhile the protest movement comprises people angered at Elon Musk’s role in the dismantling of federal government agencies, the counterprotest movement that showed up this weekend was peopled mostly by MAGA supporters. Among them were an array of far-right extremists, including members of the Proud Boys, armed militias, and at one event in Idaho, a guy dressed as Hitler.\n\nAs Musk’s so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) rips through huge swaths of the federal government and puts people’s lives and livelihoods at risk, the Tesla protest movement has gained traction. Tesla’s stock price has dropped by more than 30 percent since the beginning of the year. Isolated incidents of vandalism against Tesla vehicles and chargers as well as dealerships have led Trump to push the Department of Justice to treat alleged violent protesters as “domestic terrorists,” and now some extremist groups have taken it upon themselves to help Musk fight back.\n\n“My people will be free, my people will rule again,” David Pettinger, a member of the extremist anti-government People’s Rights group, shouted at protesters in a fake German accent outside a Tesla dealership in Meridian, Idaho, on Saturday, according to video footage of the incident.\n\nA moustachioed Pettinger wore a T-shirt with the words “LITERALLY HITLER” written on the back and a picture of Musk giving a nazi-like salute on the front. Wearing jodhpurs and black boots, Pettinger marched in front of protesters and handed out heart-shaped stickers to Musk supporters.\n\nPettinger told WIRED that he dressed as Hitler to “make fun of the overuse of the terms nazi and fascist.” However, Pettinger’s posts on X echo Hitler’s deeply antisemitic worldview.\n\nAlso in Meridian were a number of armed individuals in camouflage gear, some wearing body armor, according to images of the counterprotest posted to Bluesky. Pettinger also appeared to be armed, according to video footage showing a handgun tucked into his jodhpurs.\n\nMeanwhile, Josh Fulfer, who is known online as Oreo Express and was at the US Capitol in Washington on January 6, joined a counterprotest group in Fresno, California, telling a local news outlet: “We’re out here to show support for DOGE, Elon Musk, Tesla, and this administration.” Fulfer can be seen on his own videos harassing and shouting at protesters.\n\nAhead of the Tesla Takedown protests this weekend, the Proud Boys and other far-right groups put out calls on their social media channels for supporters to show up in numbers and counter the protests.\n\nA virtually all of the dealerships which had protests this weekend, however, the number of anti-Musk protesters vastly outnumbered the pro-Musk protesters.",

        "source": "https://www.wired.com/",
        "content": "The Trump administration, working in coordination with Elon Musk’s so-called Department of Government Efficiency, has gutted a small federal agency that provides funding to libraries and museums nationwide. In communities across the US, the cuts threaten student field trips, classes for seniors, and access to popular digital services, such as the ebook app Libby.\n\nOn Monday, managers at the Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS) informed 77 employees—virtually the agency’s entire staff—that they were immediately being put on paid administrative leave, according to one of the workers, who sought anonymity out of fear of retaliation from Trump officials. Several other sources confirmed the move, which came after President Donald Trump appointed Keith Sonderling, the deputy secretary of labor, as the acting director of IMLS less than two weeks ago.\n\nA representative for the American Federation of Government Employee Local 3403, a union that represents about 40 IMLS staffers, said Sonderling and a group of DOGE staffers met with IMLS leadership late last month. Afterwards, Sonderling sent an email to staff “emphasizing the importance of libraries and museums in cultivating the next generation’s perception of American exceptionalism and patriotism,” the union representative said in a statement to WIRED.\n\nIMLS employees who showed up to work at the agency on Monday were asked to turn in their computers and lost access to their government email addresses before being ordered to head home for the day, the employee says. It’s unclear when, or if, staffers will ever return to work. “It’s heartbreaking on many levels,” the employee adds.\n\nThe White House and the Institute of Museum and Library Services did not immediately respond to requests for comment from WIRED.\n\nThe annual budget of IMLS amounts to less than $1 per person in the US. Overall, the agency awarded over $269.5 million to library and museum systems last year, according to its grants database. Much of that money is paid out as reimbursements over time, the current IMLS employee says, but now there is no one around to cut checks for funds that have already been allocated.\n\n“The status of previously awarded grants is unclear. Without staff to administer the programs, it is likely that most grants will be terminated,” the American Federation of Government Employee Local 3403 union said in a statement.\n\nAbout 65 percent of the funding had been allocated to different states, with each one scheduled to receive a minimum of roughly $1.2 million. Recipients can use the money for statewide initiatives or pass it on to local museum and library institutions for expenses such as staff training and back-office software. California and Texas have received the highest allocated funding, at about $12.5 million and $15.7 million, respectively, according to IMLS data. Individual libraries and museums also receive grants directly from IMLS for specific projects.\n\nAn art museum in Idaho expected to put $10,350 toward supporting student field trips, according to the IMLS grant database. A North Carolina museum was allotted $23,500 for weaving and fiber art workshops for seniors. And an indigenous community in California expected to put $10,000 toward purchasing books and electronic resources.",

        "source": "https://www.wired.com/",
        "content": "The world has been addicted to caffeine for centuries, and in the year 2025 the scientific argument over whether coffee is good or bad for you remains unsettled. One might believe the lack of consensus is a Mainstream Media™ psyop to keep people scrambling for marketable solutions to a problem that’s completely made up, but the cottage industry of coffee alternatives that’s proliferated by this endless tug of war is an interesting outcome regardless of which side you’re on. This is where mushroom coffee makes its inevitable entrance.\n\nSome quick googling revealed 10 known players in the game, all of which offer their own riff on a common base formula of dried mushrooms–usually a combo of lion’s mane, chaga, and cordyceps—boosted with buzzy add-ons like probiotics and nootropics. I spent a week with each, swapping out my morning coffee for each brand's recommended dose of powder and hot water. After day five I allowed myself to experiment with sweeteners and milks, which you’ll need with almost all of these to get through the entire cup without gagging.\n\nPhotograph: Pete Cottell\n\nSome hit like a mild cup of coffee, some were actual coffee, and others were uncanny concoctions no normal person would ever crave unless they were fully indoctrinated in the heady lifestyle this unique alt-beverage industry revolves around.

        "source": "https://www.wired.com/",
        "content": "On April 1, US district judge Beryl Howell effectively allowed the transfer of the United States Institute of Peace headquarters building to the DOGE-controlled General Services Administration.\n\nThe DOGE-affiliated acting president of the United States Institute of Peace, a Congressionally funded, independent think tank, has moved to transfer the agency’s $500 million headquarters building to the General Services Administration free of charge, according to court documents revealed in a recently filed lawsuit.\n\nTensions at USIP have been escalating for weeks, starting when the Trump administration fired the agency’s 10 voting board members on March 14 and USIP staffers denied DOGE representatives access at the front door. Three days later, DOGE employees made their way into the building, reportedly using a physical key from a former security contractor. The dramatic confrontations culminated in a full takeover, with former State Department official Kenneth Jackson assuming the role of president. As of this past Friday, most USIP staffers have received termination notices.\n\nFormer USIP officials have since filed a lawsuit against Jackson, DOGE, Donald Trump, and other members of the Trump administration, seeking an immediate intervention “to stop Defendants from completing the unlawful dismantling of the Institute,” according to the complaint. While US district judge Beryl Howell declined the USIP request for a temporary restraining order that would reinstate the institute’s board on March 19, she sharply criticized DOGE’s conquest in court.\n\nCourt documents filed by defendants on Monday reveal the next phase of DOGE’s plans for USIP. As of March 25, DOGE staffer Nate Cavanaugh—formerly installed at GSA—has replaced Jackson as the institute’s acting president, the documents show. They further state that Cavanaugh has been instructed to transfer USIP’s assets—including its real estate—to the GSA. The letter detailing those changes and instructions was signed by secretary of defense Pete Hegseth and secretary of state Marco Rubio.\n\nCavanaugh did not immediately respond to a request for comment by WIRED. The lead attorney for the Department of Justice in this case also did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nIn a separate undated letter, which was also included in the batch of documents filed with the court, Cavanaugh writes to GSA acting administrator Stephen Ehikian: “I have concluded that it is in the best interest of USIP, the federal government, and the United States for USIP to transfer its real property located at 2301 Constitution Ave NW, Washington, D.C. 20037, to GSA and to seek an exception from the 100 percent reimbursement requirement for the building.”\n\nCavanaugh goes on to estimate that the building has a “fair market value” of $500 million.\n\nIn another letter included in the lawsuit’s docket dated March 29, Project 2025 architect and Office of Management and Budget director Russell Vought writes to Ehikian to approve his request “to set the amount of reimbursement at no cost for the transfer of the United States Institute of Peace’s (USIP) headquarters building.”\n\nTo state this plainly: DOGE forced out the directors and staff of a nonexecutive agency and installed one of its own GSA staffers as president, and that person is now attempting to hand the institute’s $500 million headquarters over to the agency he came from, at zero cost.\n\nGot a Tip? Are you a current or former government employee who wants to talk about what's happening? We'd like to hear from you. Using a nonwork phone or computer, contact the reporter securely on Signal at barrett.64.\n\n“The effort to transfer the building to GSA is part of the DOGE playbook to run agencies through a wood chipper. That’s what they’re trying to do,” claims George Foote, longtime outside general counsel to USIP. “They’re trying to kill the agency, which they have no right to do.”\n\nLawyers for the former USIP staff filed a motion Monday to prevent the transfer of assets. In an opposing court filing, government lawyers claim that “the Institute is an executive agency and has decided consistent with the Executive Order and its statutory authority to transfer its excess property to GSA,” referring to president Donald Trump's February EO that purportedly “reins in independent agencies.”\n\nJudge Howell will decide whether to allow the transfer in court Tuesday; a broader ruling in the USIP case is expected by the end of the month.\n\nAdditional reporting by Matt Giles.",

        "content": "Sony’s glittering new RGB LED display made a big splash last month, and as one of the few to see it in the flesh, I can attest that it's a very exciting new advancement. It's also still deep in the prototype stage, so it'll be a while before we get our hands on one. Today, Sony unveiled the latest additions to its home theater lineup for the here and (almost) now.\n\nWhile pricing has yet to be announced, the 2025 lineup includes two new LED TVs, new home audio gear, and a blazing new OLED TV primed to compete with LG, Samsung, and others for the coveted title of best TV of the year.\n\nI traveled to Sony HQ in Tokyo to get a hands-on preview of all the new gear ahead of the official release. Here’s everything I saw, heard, and learned about Sony’s latest home theater gadgets.\n\nPower up with unlimited access to WIRED.

Subscribe Today.\n\nPhotograph: Ryan Waniata\n\nNew Bravia Sights\n\nBravia 8 II QD-OLED TV (55 and 65 inches)\n\nThere’s a new king of Sony’s TV lineup with an oddly underwhelming title. Despite sharing the naming convention of Sony’s second-tier OLED from 2024, the Bravia 8 Mark II is positioned as Sony’s 2025 flagship TV, with performance to match. In design, the TV looks a lot like 2023’s A95L QD-OLED (9/10, WIRED Recommends), but Sony claims the new Bravia 8 is 25 percent brighter than that model and 50 percent brighter than its namesake.\n\nBuilt to compete with 2025’s LG G5 and Samsung S95F OLEDs, the TV uses a version of Samsung's latest QD-OLED panel rather than LG’s new “Quad Stack” panel, along with Sony processing tech like XR Tiluminous Max for enhanced colors and Sony's XR Processor with AI for analyzing and optimizing content scene-by-scene. Sony claims one reason for sticking with a QD-OLED panel this year is that it allows for better off-axis color accuracy. It’s also notable that this TV will purportedly undercut Sony’s previous flagship in pricing, which should make it more competitive in a very tough market.\n\nIn person, the TV showed fabulous color accuracy and saturation, alongside sizzly brightness at every turn. It was especially showy with high-caliber Blu-ray content mastered at the top of the brightness scale. In Sony's carefully curated demos, the TV showed less image clipping than last year’s LG G4 and Samsung S95D (8/10, WIRED Recommends) viewed side by side. A blacksmith demo using the next-gen BT.2020 color gamut dazzled, revealing gleaming-bright molten metal that looked ready to pop off the screen and singe your eyebrows. It appeared to easily outpace the older models, including Sony’s own 2023 A95L (9/10, WIRED Recommends), instantly drawing my eye each time it was fired up. I can't wait to compare it to the latest rivals in what looks to be another transformative OLED class for 2025.",

        "title": "This Is How You Get a Chinese EV Into the United States",
        "source": "https://www.wired.com/",
        "content": "Most of us expect our ecommerce orders to show up at our doorsteps, but John Karlin had to drive eight hours from Oklahoma City to Freeport, Texas, to pick up his order: a Chinese electric car.\n\nKarlin, a registered nurse and quality process analyst, read in the summer of 2021 that a tiny $5,000 EV—the Wuling Hongguang Mini EV—was outselling Tesla’s Model 3 in the Chinese market.\n\n“I saw an article saying the most popular EV in the world is the Hongguang Mini EV, but you can't have one. So that got me asking: Well, why is it the most popular vehicle? And why can't I have one?” Karlin says. By October of the same year, he had studied all the requirements to bring this car to the US, placed an order from a Chinese auto exporter on Alibaba, and had the car, a more premium model called the Wuling Macaron, shipped across the oceans to him.\n\nStill, Karlin was nervous when he got to the customs. He believes he was the first American to import this vehicle model to the US, and he had to navigate uncharted territories to make it happen. Thankfully, he breezed through the various processes of getting his car and then towed it all the way back to Oklahoma City, where he would register the vehicle, insure it, and drive it every day to work at the hospital.\n\nThe China-made Wuling Hongguang Macaron costs less than $8,000. Photograph: Courtesy of Wuling\n\nKarlin is definitely an outlier. Today, there are almost no Chinese electric cars sold in the US. In fact, the US has become an outlier in the world as affordable Chinese EVs have quickly taken over markets in Europe, Asia, South America, and Africa.\n\nFirst, they are almost never sold here officially. Compared to Mexico, where 135,000 Chinese-branded vehicles were sold in 2023, accounting for 10 percent of total car sales, the US has no Chinese auto brands on sale (although it does sell a small number of made-in-China electric or hybrid cars by Polestar, Volvo and Ford). Many Chinese companies, like BYD and NIO, have explored the possibilities to enter the US market—this is one of the largest auto markets in the world, after all—yet plans have been deterred by economic calculations, political pressures, and rising tariffs such as the 25 percent tariffs announced in March on any cars imported to the US.\n\nFor many other countries, this is where parallel import, or unauthorized gray market vehicles, comes in. But they’ve been almost nonexistent in the US since 1988, when Congress passed a law essentially forbidding the import of any foreign cars unless they go through a lengthy and costly process to prove they meet US safety and emission standards. The law was passed when Japanese and European automakers were significantly squeezing the US auto market, which sounds familiar to Chinese EV brands’ market advantage today.",

        "title": "Inside arXiv—the Most Transformative Platform in All of Science",
        "source": "https://www.wired.com/",
        "content": "“Just when I thought I was out, they pull me back in!” With a sly grin that I’d soon come to recognize, Paul Ginsparg quoted Michael Corleone from The Godfather. Ginsparg, a physics professor at Cornell University and a certified MacArthur genius, may have little in common with Al Pacino’s mafia don, but both are united by the feeling that they were denied a graceful exit from what they’ve built.\n\nNearly 35 years ago, Ginsparg created arXiv, a digital repository where researchers could share their latest findings—before those findings had been systematically reviewed or verified. Visit arXiv.org today (it’s pronounced like “archive”) and you’ll still see its old-school Web 1.0 design, featuring a red banner and the seal of Cornell University, the platform’s institutional home. But arXiv’s unassuming facade belies the tectonic reconfiguration it set off in the scientific community. If arXiv were to stop functioning, scientists from every corner of the planet would suffer an immediate and profound disruption. “Everybody in math and physics uses it,” Scott Aaronson, a computer scientist at the University of Texas at Austin, told me. “I scan it every night.”\n\nEvery industry has certain problems universally acknowledged as broken: insurance in health care, licensing in music, standardized testing in education, tipping in the restaurant business. In academia, it’s publishing. Academic publishing is dominated by for-profit giants like Elsevier and Springer. Calling their practice a form of thuggery isn’t so much an insult as an economic observation. Imagine if a book publisher demanded that authors write books for free and, instead of employing in-house editors, relied on other authors to edit those books, also for free. And not only that: The final product was then sold at prohibitively expensive prices to ordinary readers, and institutions were forced to pay exorbitant fees for access.\n\nThe “free editing” academic publishers facilitate is called peer review, the process by which fellow researchers vet new findings. This can take months, even a year. But with arXiv, scientists could post their papers—known, at this unvetted stage, as preprints—for instant and free access to everyone. One of arXiv’s great achievements was “showing that you could divorce the actual transmission of your results from the process of refereeing,” said Paul Fendley, an early arXiv moderator and now a physicist at All Souls College, Oxford. During crises like the Covid pandemic, time-sensitive breakthroughs were disseminated quickly—particularly by bioRxiv and medRxiv, platforms inspired by arXiv—potentially saving, by one study’s estimate, millions of lives.\n\nWhile arXiv submissions aren’t peer-reviewed, they are moderated by experts in each field, who volunteer their time to ensure that submissions meet basic academic standards and follow arXiv’s guidelines: original research only, no falsified data, sufficiently neutral language. Submissions also undergo automated checks for baseline quality control. Without these, pseudoscientific papers and amateur work would flood the platform.\n\nIn 2021, the journal Nature declared arXiv one of the “10 computer codes that transformed science,” praising its role in fostering scientific collaboration. (The article is behind a paywall—unlock it for $199 a year.) By a recent count, arXiv hosts more than 2.6 million papers, receives 20,000 new submissions each month, and has 5 million monthly active users. Many of the most significant discoveries of the 21st century have first appeared on the platform. The “transformers” paper that launched the modern AI boom? Uploaded to arXiv. Same with the solution to the Poincaré conjecture, one of the seven Millennium Prize problems, famous for their difficulty and $1 million rewards. Just because a paper is posted on arXiv doesn’t mean it won’t appear in a prestigious journal someday, but it’s often where research makes its debut and stays openly available. The transformers paper is still routinely accessed via arXiv.\n\nFor scientists, imagining a world without arXiv is like the rest of us imagining one without public libraries or GPS. But a look at its inner workings reveals that it isn’t a frictionless utopia of open-access knowledge. Over the years, arXiv’s permanence has been threatened by everything from bureaucratic strife to outdated code to even, once, a spy scandal. In the words of Ginsparg, who usually redirects interview requests to an FAQ document—on arXiv, no less—and tried to talk me out of visiting him in person, arXiv is “a child I sent off to college but who keeps coming back to camp out in my living room, behaving badly.”\n\nGinsparg and I met over the course of several days last spring in Ithaca, New York, home of Cornell University. I’ll admit, I was apprehensive ahead of our time together. Geoffrey West, a former supervisor of Ginsparg’s at Los Alamos National Laboratory, once described him as “quite a character” who is “infamous in the community” for being “quite difficult.” He also said he was “extremely funny” and a “great guy.” In our early email exchanges, Ginsparg told me, upfront, that stories about arXiv never impress him: “So many articles, so few insights,” he wrote.",

        "source": "https://www.wired.com/",
        "content": "Several top scientists charged with overseeing research into disease prevention and cures at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) were notified that they were subject to a reduction in force on Tuesday as part of a devastating purge of federal employees carried out by US Health and Human Services secretary Robert Kennedy Jr., WIRED has learned.\n\nMultiple sources at the NIH, granted anonymity because they were not authorized to talk to the media, confirmed Tuesday afternoon that at least 10 principal investigators who were leading and directing medical research at the agency had been fired. Among them is Dr. Richard Youle, a leading researcher in the field of neurodegenerative disorders previously awarded the Breakthrough Prize in Life Sciences for his groundbreaking research identifying mechanisms behind Parkinson’s disease.\n\nThe Breakthrough Prize ceremony, often referred to as the “Oscars of Science,” was last year attended by Elon Musk, whose Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) has served as the tip of the spear in President Donald Trump’s campaign to eliminate large swaths of the federal workforce.\n\nHHS did not respond to WIRED's questions about the firings of NIH scientists. Vianca Rodriguez, an agency spokesperson, pointed to previous statements by Secretary Kennedy, including plans announced last week to eliminate 1,200 NIH jobs in areas of procurement, human resources, and communications.\n\nMultiple NIH sources tell WIRED the layoffs include—in addition to labor, IT, and human resources personnel—several accomplished senior investigators at the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS), top scientists at the National Institute on Aging, and several researchers noted for their work in HIV, emerging infectious diseases, and child brain and neural disorders.\n\nAt an NINDS town hall meeting on Tuesday, leadership at that institute expressed confusion about the cuts, saying they were blindsided by firings of principal investigators, or PIs, who lead research teams. NIH has approximately 1,200 PIs across its 27 centers and institutes. “To get rid of 11 of our senior PIs … we’re hoping that’s a mistake, because we can’t figure out why they would want to do that,” said Walter Koroshetz, director of the NINDS, according to a source present at the meeting.\n\nThe labs affected by the layoffs include those involved in clinical trials as well as preclinical studies. It is unclear, NIH staff said, what the plans are for the data they've accumulated or what will happen to patients involved in ongoing trials.\n\nAn email sent out Tuesday to more than 2,000 recent college graduates, graduate students, and postdoctoral fellows working at NIH seems to confirm the firings of multiple PIs. “Many of us know someone, directly or indirectly, who received a termination notice today as part of an HHS-wide Reduction in Force,” reads an email by Sharon Milgram, director of NIH’s Office of Intramural Training & Education, which was shared with WIRED.\n\nThe NIH supports young researchers through various programs, typically temporary one- or two-years fellowships. These early-career scientists are placed in labs under a PI. In her email, Milgram tells fellows with NIH’s postbaccalaureate, cancer research, and visiting fellows programs whose PI received an RIF notice, “I can assure you that your fellowship appointment is not immediately terminated and that we will work with each of you to explore reassignment options soon.”",

        "source": "https://www.wired.com/",
        "content": "On Wednesday, President Donald Trump announced the US was imposing reciprocal tariffs on a small collection of Antarctic islands that are not inhabited by humans, as part of a global trade war aimed at asserting US dominance. The Heard and McDonald Islands, known for their populations of penguins and seabirds, can only be reached by sea.\n\nTrump announced the countries now subject to tariffs in a Wednesday press conference, using a poster as a prop. Additional countries—including the Heard and McDonald Islands, which are, incidentally, not countries—were listed on sheets of paper distributed to reporters.\n\nOne of the sheets claims that the Heard and McDonald Islands currently charge a “Tariff to the U.S.A.” of 10 percent, clarifying in tiny letters that this includes \"currency manipulation and trade barriers.\" In return, the sheet says that the US will charge \"discounted reciprocal tariffs\" on the islands at a rate of 10 percent.\n\nThe islands are small. Their reported 37,000 hectares of land makes them a little larger than Philadelphia. According to UNESCO, which designated the islands as a World Heritage Site in 1997, they are covered in rocks and glaciers. Heard Island is the site of an active volcano, and McDonald Island is surrounded by several smaller rocky islands. The islands are home to large populations of penguins and elephant seals.\n\nThe Australian Antarctic Division manages the islands, preserving the environment and conducting research on the large wildlife population, as well as climate change’s impact on Heard and McDonald’s permanent glaciers. On Wednesday, Australia and a number of its island territories, including Christmas and Cocos Keeling Islands, were also hit with tariffs of 10 percent. Norfolk Island, which Australia also claims, got a tariff of 29 percent.\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to WIRED’s request for comment. When reached for comment, the Australian Antarctic Division referred WIRED to the country’s Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, which did not respond prior to publication.\n\n\"One could argue this is in breach of the international Antarctic spirit,\" Elizabeth Buchanan, a polar geopolitics expert and senior fellow at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, tells WIRED.\n\nUnder the Antarctic Treaty, which promotes international scientific cooperation and stipulates that the continent should be used for peaceful purposes, land in Antarctica cannot be owned by any country. However, Australia has claimed since 1953 that the islands are Australian territories. Australia also laid claim to the water surrounding the islands via a 2002 act that established a marine reserve. Last year, the country passed a law extending the boundaries of that reserve, approximately quadrupling its size.\n\nThe Australian Defense Force monitors the waters surrounding the Heard and McDonald Islands as a part of Operation Resolute, which covers the area 200 nautical miles from Australia’s mainland and “approximately 10 percent of the world's surface.” In addition to Heard and McDonald Islands, it also applies to the water surrounding the Christmas, Cocos Keeling, Macquarie, and Norfolk and Lord Howe islands. The Australian Defense Force claims that the goal of Operation Resolute is to address \"security threats\" like piracy and pollution.\n\nThe Australian Antarctic Division claims that the area occasionally receives ships involved in scientific research, commercial fishing, and tourism.",

Decades later, there is now at least one Manufacturing Extension Partnership (MEP) center in all 50 states, and they continue to provide taxpayer-subsidized consulting to thousands of businesses, including makers of ovens, printers, tortillas, and dog food.\n\nBut on Tuesday, shortly before the president announced sweeping tariffs on global imports, Trump administration officials informed members of Congress that it was withholding funding for some MEP centers because their work no longer aligns with government priorities.\n\nThe Department of Commerce’s National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), which administers the program to help manufacturers, emailed lawmakers to say that it would not be paying out nearly $12.9 million that had been due overall this week to MEP centers in 10 states, according to Democratic staff of the House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology who spoke on on the condition of anonymity.\n\n“The department is reprioritizing its programmatic activities to ensure that the US secures its position as a leader in critical and emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence and quantum,” according to the email seen by WIRED. “As such NIST has determined that these cooperative agreements are no longer aligned with the priorities of the department and NIST.”\n\nThe Democratic congressional aides and heads of MEP centers in multiple states believe that abandoning support for the program runs counter to Trump’s long-standing goals of boosting domestic manufacturing and winning the ongoing trade war with China. While the president has demonstrated a preference for punitive measures such as tariffs over subsidies to increase American manufacturing capacity, his defunding of the centers could leave US small businesses without the support they need to take advantage of such policies, advocates for the MEP program say.\n\n“These efforts directly align with the president’s goals to strengthen domestic manufacturing and re-shore production,” says Jennifer Sinsabaugh, CEO of New Mexico MEP.\n\nProject 2025, a proposed road map for the current Trump administration authored by the conservative Heritage Foundation think tank, had called for eliminating federal subsidies for the manufacturing program and letting the private sector “more properly” carry out its business advisory services. But as of Wednesday, the Department of Commerce and NIST had not announced a plan to privatize it or shared how the withheld funds would be repurposed.\n\nNIST did not respond to a request for comment. The manufacturing program is one of a number of NIST initiatives that the Commerce Department has moved to scale back or eliminate in recent weeks as Trump and Elon Musk’s so-called Department of Government Efficiency work to dismantle a whole range of long-standing agencies and programs run by the US federal government.\n\nPerhaps anticipating that DOGE might be coming for the program, NIST added a graphic to the top of its MEP webpage in February highlighting how it contributes to the US economy, according to screenshots from the Internet Archive’s Wayback Machine.",

        "title": "Sam Altman Says OpenAI Will Release an ‘Open Weight’ AI Model This Summer",
        "source": "https://www.wired.com/",
        "content": "Sam Altman today revealed that OpenAI will release an open-weight artificial intelligence model in the coming months.\n\n“We are excited to release a powerful new open-weight language model with reasoning in the coming months,” the CEO wrote on X.\n\nThe move is partly a response to the runaway success of the R1 model from Chinese company DeepSeek, as well as the popularity of Meta’s Llama models.\n\nShortly after DeepSeek’s model was released in January, Altman said that OpenAI was “on the wrong side of history” regarding open models, signaling a likely shift in direction. On Monday he said that the company has been thinking about releasing an open-weight model for some time, adding “now it feels important to do.”\n\nOpenAI may feel the need to show that it can train the new model cheaply, since DeepSeek’s model was purportedly trained at a fraction of the cost of most large AI models.\n\n“This is amazing news,” Clement Delangue, cofounder and CEO of HuggingFace, a company that specializes in hosting open AI models, told WIRED. “With DeepSeek, everyone’s realizing the power of open weights.”\n\nGot a Tip? Are you a current or former employee who wants to talk about what's happening? We'd like to hear from you. Using a nonwork phone or computer, contact the reporter securely on Signal at wak.01.\n\nOpenAI currently makes its AI available through a chatbot and through the cloud. R1, Llama and other open-weight models can be downloaded for free and modified. A model’s weights refers to the values inside a large neural network—something that is set during training. Open-weight models are cheaper to use and can also be tailored for sensitive use cases, like handling highly confidential information.\n\nSteven Heidel, a member of the technical staff at OpenAI, reposted Altman’s announcement and added, “We're releasing a model this year that you can run on your own hardware.”\n\nJohannes Heidecke, a researcher working on AI safety at OpenAI, also reposted the message on X, adding that the company would conduct rigorous testing to ensure the open-weight model could not easily be misused. Some AI researchers worry that open-weight models could help criminals launch cyberattacks or even develop biological or chemical weapons. “While open models bring unique challenges, we’re guided by our Preparedness Framework and will not release models we believe pose catastrophic risks,” Heidecke wrote.\n\nOpenAI today also posted a webpage inviting developers to apply for early access to the forthcoming model. Altman said in his post that the company would host events for developers with early prototypes of the new model in the coming weeks.\n\nMeta was the first major AI company to pursue a more open approach, releasing the first version of Llama in July 2023. A growing number of open-weight AI models are now available. Some researchers note that Llama and some other models are not as transparent as they could be, because the training data and other details are still kept secret. Meta also imposes a license that limits other companies’ ability to profit from applications and tools built using Llama.\n\nUpdate March 31, 2025, 4:21 EST: This article was updated with a comment from Clement Delangue, cofounder and CEO of HuggingFace.",

        "title": "DOGE Plans to Rebuild SSA Code Base in Months, Risking Benefits and System Collapse",
        "source": "https://www.wired.com/",
        "content": "The so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) is starting to put together a team to migrate the Social Security Administration’s (SSA) computer systems entirely off one of its oldest programming languages in a matter of months, potentially putting the integrity of the system—and the benefits on which tens of millions of Americans rely—at risk.\n\nThe project is being organized by Elon Musk lieutenant Steve Davis, multiple sources who were not given permission to talk to the media tell WIRED, and aims to migrate all SSA systems off COBOL, one of the first common business-oriented programming languages, and onto a more modern replacement like Java within a scheduled tight timeframe of a few months.\n\nUnder any circumstances, a migration of this size and scale would be a massive undertaking, experts tell WIRED, but the expedited deadline runs the risk of obstructing payments to the more than 65 million people in the US currently receiving Social Security benefits.\n\n“Of course, one of the big risks is not underpayment or overpayment per se; [it’s also] not paying someone at all and not knowing about it. The invisible errors and omissions,” an SSA technologist tells WIRED.\n\nThe Social Security Administration did not immediately reply to WIRED’s request for comment.\n\nSSA has been under increasing scrutiny from president Donald Trump’s administration. In February, Musk took aim at SSA, falsely claiming that the agency was rife with fraud. Specifically, Musk pointed to data he allegedly pulled from the system that showed 150-year-olds in the US were receiving benefits, something that isn’t actually happening. Over the last few weeks, following significant cuts to the agency by DOGE, SSA has suffered frequent website crashes and long wait times over the phone, The Washington Post reported this week.\n\nThis proposed migration isn’t the first time SSA has tried to move away from COBOL: In 2017, SSA announced a plan to receive hundreds of millions in funding to replace its core systems. The agency predicted that it would take around five years to modernize these systems. Because of the coronavirus pandemic in 2020, the agency pivoted away from this work to focus on more public-facing projects.\n\nLike many legacy government IT systems, SSA systems contain code written in COBOL, a programming language created in part in the 1950s by computing pioneer Grace Hopper. The Defense Department essentially pressured private industry to use COBOL soon after its creation, spurring widespread adoption and making it one of the most widely used languages for mainframes, or computer systems that process and store large amounts of data quickly, by the 1970s. (At least one DOD-related website praising Hopper's accomplishments is no longer active, likely following the Trump administration’s DEI purge of military acknowledgements.)\n\nAs recently as 2016, SSA’s infrastructure contained more than 60 million lines of code written in COBOL, with millions more written in other legacy coding languages, the agency’s Office of the Inspector General found. In fact, SSA’s core programmatic systems and architecture haven’t been “substantially” updated since the 1980s when the agency developed its own database system called MADAM, or the Master Data Access Method, which was written in COBOL and Assembler, according to SSA’s 2017 modernization plan.",

        "title": "In Search of the Last Wild Axolotls",
        "source": "https://www.wired.com/",
        "content": "axolotls are critically endangered. According to the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, these aquatic monsters—a national symbol that features on Mexico’s 50 peso bills, and which were once considered divine entities, the “twins” of the Aztec deity Quetzalcoatl—are at “extremely high risk of extinction in the wild.”\n\nThe figures tell it best. In 1998 there were 6,000 axolotls per square kilometer in their natural habitat, the district of Xochimilco in the south of Mexico City. By 2004, that figure had fallen to just 1,000, and by 2008 it was only 100. A 2014 census of Mexico’s wild axolotl population found only 36 of the creatures. Now, a decade later, a new survey is underway. Xochimilco is home to the remnants of a vast canal network built by the Aztecs, and is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, though the district is facing ecological deterioration as a result of increasing urbanization.\n\nEverything indicates that for the axolotl, the countdown to extinction continues. But there is one last hope. Scientists from the Ecological Restoration Laboratory at the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM), who are in charge of the axolotl census, are seeking to reverse this trend and conserve one of the oldest terrestrial vertebrates on the planet.\n\n“The objective of the census is to know the current status of the axolotl population,” says Luis Zambrano, project leader and founder of the Ecological Restoration Laboratory. Public sightings are important, he says, but to be sure of their existence in the wild, there needs to be evidence. Armed with confirmation that axolotls are still present in Xochimilco, and with an estimate of how many, the researchers then plan to run campaigns to combat misinformation about the species and to guide conservation, and also to bolster the wild population by releasing reared individuals. The final results of this survey will be published in the first half of 2025, and a new count is planned for 2026.\n\nWIRED witnessed firsthand how scientists Vania Mendoza, Viviam Crespo, and Paola Cervantes—together with local villagers, like Basilio Rodríguez—conducted the census. They used traditional fishing techniques together with innovative methods such as environmental DNA analysis, where a species can be traced by hunting for DNA that it sheds into its surrounding habitat.\n\nThe surveying takes place at dawn in Xochimilco, one of the last vestiges of the ancient lake system of the Basin of Mexico, where plant and animal species that modernity has erased from other parts of Mexico City still survive. It’s a magical oasis in the monster capital that looks like something out of a Mexican fairy tale, where herons and pelicans are heard as the sun comes up. As we travel through the landscape on a wooden raft, we see that the lake is still filled with chinampas, artificial agricultural islands first developed in pre-Hispanic times and which amazed the first Spaniards who came to these lands.\n\nThe axolotl has four legs, a long tail, and is nocturnal and carnivorous. They appear in four different colors: wild axolotls have a blackish-brown hue, while mutant variants include leucistic (white with dark eyes), white albino, and golden albino. “So far, we haven’t found any axolotls; however, DNA analysis offers a chance,” says Paola Cervantes, a graduate in earth sciences and part of the UNAM team for this year’s census.",

        "source": "https://www.wired.com/",
        "content": "On Tuesday, US district judge Beryl Howell effectively allowed the transfer of the headquarters building of the United States Institute of Peace to the General Services Administration.\n\nIn fact, the building—and all of the property inside it—had already been transferred on Saturday, according to Howell’s ruling. “The deal is no longer merely ‘proposed’ but done,” Howell wrote, “rendering plaintiffs’ requested relief moot as to that property.”\n\nGeorge Foote, longtime outside general counsel to USIP, says he found that reasoning perplexing. “That’s like letting a burglar break into your house, steal your TV, and have the court say well, there’s no TV to adjudicate, so I can’t do anything about it,” he claims.\n\nThe building, with an estimated value of $500 million, has become the latest focal point in a weeks-long standoff between former institute board and staff and members of Elon Musk’s so-called Department of Government Efficiency. On March 14, the Trump administration fired the USIP’s 10 voting board members. When USIP staffers barred DOGE employees from entering their headquarters in Washington, DC, the DOGE team returned a few days later with a physical key they had gotten from a former security contractor.\n\nThe takeover was both physical and institutional. Former State Department official Kenneth Jackson was installed as USIP president, then replaced on March 25 by DOGE staffer Nate Cavanaugh, who had previously been assigned to the General Services Administration. By last Friday evening, most USIP staffers had received termination notices, effectively shuttering the agency.\n\nThe fight over the building came to light Monday through court documents in a lawsuit filed by former USIP staffers against Cavanaugh, DOGE, Donald Trump, and other members of the administration. They reveal not only that Cavanaugh recently moved to transfer the building to GSA, but that he planned to do so at no cost to the government.\n\nIn a letter included in the court’s docket, Cavanaugh tells GSA acting administrator Stephen Ehikian that the transfer “is in the best interest of USIP, the federal government, and the United States.” In a separate letter, dated March 29, Office of Management and Budget director Russell Vought approved Ehikian’s request to “set the amount of reimbursement at no cost” for the facility.\n\nA previously unreported court filing from Monday speaks to the Trump administration’s justification for trying to acquire the building.\n\n“The transfer of the U.S. Institutes [sic] of Peace (USIP) headquarters facility … is a priority of the Trump-Vance administration,” wrote the GSA’s Michael Peters, who spent nearly a decade running a dental practice management company before he was named commissioner of the Public Buildings Service in January, in a transfer request form. “The transfer will enable GSA to fulfill other governmental space requirements at the USIP headquarters facility in a cost-effective manner. However, GSA has not had adequate time to budget for the cost of acquiring the USIP headquarters facility at fair market value, nor would such an acquisition be an immediate priority for GSA, given the limited resources available in the Federal Buildings Fund.”",

        "title": "The Trump Administration Accidentally Texted Me Its War Plans",
        "source": "https://www.theatlantic.com/",
        "content": "This article is the first in a series about the Trump administration's use of Signal group chatting. Read the next story in the series here\n\nU.S. national-security leaders included me in a group chat about upcoming military strikes in Yemen. I didn’t think it could be real. Then the bombs started falling.\n\nThe world found out shortly before 2 p.m. eastern time on March 15 that the United States was bombing Houthi targets across Yemen.\n\nI, however, knew two hours before the first bombs exploded that the attack might be coming. The reason I knew this is that Pete Hegseth, the secretary of defense, had texted me the war plan at 11:44 a.m. The plan included precise information about weapons packages, targets, and timing.\n\nThis is going to require some explaining.\n\nThis article was featured in the One Story to Read Today newsletter. Sign up for it here.\n\nThe story technically begins shortly after the Hamas invasion of southern Israel, in October 2023. The Houthis—an Iran-backed terrorist organization whose motto is “God is great, death to America, death to Israel, curse on the Jews, victory to Islam”—soon launched attacks on Israel and on international shipping, creating havoc for global trade. Throughout 2024, the Biden administration was ineffective in countering these Houthi attacks; the incoming Trump administration promised a tougher response.\n\nThis is where Pete Hegseth and I come in.\n\nOn Tuesday, March 11, I received a connection request on Signal from a user identified as Michael Waltz. Signal is an open-source encrypted messaging service popular with journalists and others who seek more privacy than other text-messaging services are capable of delivering. I assumed that the Michael Waltz in question was President Donald Trump’s national security adviser. I did not assume, however, that the request was from the actual Michael Waltz. I have met him in the past, and though I didn’t find it particularly strange that he might be reaching out to me, I did think it somewhat unusual, given the Trump administration’s contentious relationship with journalists—and Trump’s periodic fixation on me specifically. It immediately crossed my mind that someone could be masquerading as Waltz in order to somehow entrap me. It is not at all uncommon these days for nefarious actors to try to induce journalists to share information that could be used against them.\n\nI accepted the connection request, hoping that this was the actual national security adviser, and that he wanted to chat about Ukraine, or Iran, or some other important matter.\n\nTwo days later—Thursday—at 4:28 p.m., I received a notice that I was to be included in a Signal chat group. It was called the “Houthi PC small group.”\n\nA message to the group, from “Michael Waltz,” read as follows: “Team – establishing a principles [sic] group for coordination on Houthis, particularly for over the next 72 hours. My deputy Alex Wong is pulling together a tiger team at deputies/agency Chief of Staff level following up from the meeting in the Sit Room this morning for action items and will be sending that out later this evening.”\n\nThe message continued, “Pls provide the best staff POC from your team for us to coordinate with over the next couple days and over the weekend. Thx.”\n\nRead: Here are the attack plans that Trump’s advisers shared on Signal\n\nThe term principals committee generally refers to a group of the senior-most national-security officials, including the secretaries of defense, state, and the treasury, as well as the director of the CIA. It should go without saying—but I’ll say it anyway—that I have never been invited to a White House principals-committee meeting, and that, in my many years of reporting on national-security matters, I had never heard of one being convened over a commercial messaging app.\n\nOne minute later, a person identified only as “MAR”—the secretary of state is Marco Antonio Rubio—wrote, “Mike Needham for State,” apparently designating the current counselor of the State Department as his representative. At that same moment, a Signal user identified as “JD Vance” wrote, “Andy baker for VP.” One minute after that, “TG” (presumably Tulsi Gabbard, the director of national intelligence, or someone masquerading as her) wrote, “Joe Kent for DNI.” Nine minutes later, “Scott B”—apparently Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, or someone spoofing his identity, wrote, “Dan Katz for Treasury.” At 4:53 p.m., a user called “Pete Hegseth” wrote, “Dan Caldwell for DoD.” And at 6:34 p.m., “Brian” wrote “Brian McCormack for NSC.” One more person responded: “John Ratcliffe” wrote at 5:24 p.m. with the name of a CIA official to be included in the group. I am not publishing that name, because that person is an active intelligence officer.\n\nThe principals had apparently assembled. In all, 18 individuals were listed as members of this group, including various National Security Council officials; Steve Witkoff, President Trump’s Middle East and Ukraine negotiator; Susie Wiles, the White House chief of staff; and someone identified only as “S M,” which I took to stand for Stephen Miller. I appeared on my own screen only as “JG.”\n\nThat was the end of the Thursday text chain.\n\nAfter receiving the Waltz text related to the “Houthi PC small group,” I consulted a number of colleagues. We discussed the possibility that these texts were part of a disinformation campaign, initiated by either a foreign intelligence service or, more likely, a media-gadfly organization, the sort of group that attempts to place journalists in embarrassing positions, and sometimes succeeds. I had very strong doubts that this text group was real, because I could not believe that the national-security leadership of the United States would communicate on Signal about imminent war plans. I also could not believe that the national security adviser to the president would be so reckless as to include the editor in chief of The Atlantic in such discussions with senior U.S. officials, up to and including the vice president.\n\nThe next day, things got even stranger.\n\nAt 8:05 a.m. on Friday, March 14, “Michael Waltz” texted the group: “Team, you should have a statement of conclusions with taskings per the Presidents guidance this morning in your high side inboxes.” (High side, in government parlance, refers to classified computer and communications systems.) “State and DOD, we developed suggested notification lists for regional Allies and partners. Joint Staff is sending this am a more specific sequence of events in the coming days and we will work w DOD to ensure COS, OVP and POTUS are briefed.”\n\nAt this point, a fascinating policy discussion commenced. The account labeled “JD Vance” responded at 8:16: “Team, I am out for the day doing an economic event in Michigan. But I think we are making a mistake.” (Vance was indeed in Michigan that day.) The Vance account goes on to state, “3 percent of US trade runs through the suez. 40 percent of European trade does. There is a real risk that the public doesn’t understand this or why it’s necessary. The strongest reason to do this is, as POTUS said, to send a message.”\n\nThe Vance account then goes on to make a noteworthy statement, considering that the vice president has not deviated publicly from Trump’s position on virtually any issue. “I am not sure the president is aware how inconsistent this is with his message on Europe right now. There’s a further risk that we see a moderate to severe spike in oil prices. I am willing to support the consensus of the team and keep these concerns to myself. But there is a strong argument for delaying this a month, doing the messaging work on why this matters, seeing where the economy is, etc.”\n\nA person identified in Signal as “Joe Kent” (Trump’s nominee to run the National Counterterrorism Center is named Joe Kent) wrote at 8:22, “There is nothing time sensitive driving the time line. We’ll have the exact same options in a month.”\n\nThen, at 8:26 a.m., a message landed in my Signal app from the user “John Ratcliffe.” The message contained information that might be interpreted as related to actual and current intelligence operations.\n\nAt 8:27, a message arrived from the “Pete Hegseth” account. “VP: I understand your concerns – and fully support you raising w/ POTUS. Important considerations, most of which are tough to know how they play out (economy, Ukraine peace, Gaza, etc). I think messaging is going to be tough no matter what – nobody knows who the Houthis are – which is why we would need to stay focused on: 1) Biden failed & 2) Iran funded.”\n\nThe Hegseth message goes on to state, “Waiting a few weeks or a month does not fundamentally change the calculus. 2 immediate risks on waiting: 1) this leaks, and we look indecisive; 2) Israel takes an action first – or Gaza cease fire falls apart – and we don’t get to start this on our own terms. We can manage both. We are prepared to execute, and if I had final go or no go vote, I believe we should. This [is] not about the Houthis. I see it as two things: 1) Restoring Freedom of Navigation, a core national interest; and 2) Reestablish deterrence, which Biden cratered. But, we can easily pause. And if we do, I will do all we can to enforce 100% OPSEC”—operations security. “I welcome other thoughts.”\n\nA few minutes later, the “Michael Waltz” account posted a lengthy note about trade figures, and the limited capabilities of European navies. “Whether it’s now or several weeks from now, it will have to be the United States that reopens these shipping lanes. Per the president’s request we are working with DOD and State to determine how to compile the cost associated and levy them on the Europeans.”\n\nThe account identified as “JD Vance” addressed a message at 8:45 to @Pete Hegseth: “if you think we should do it let’s go. I just hate bailing Europe out again.” (The administration has argued that America’s European allies benefit economically from the U.S. Navy’s protection of international shipping lanes.)\n\nThe user identified as Hegseth responded three minutes later: “VP: I fully share your loathing of European free-loading. It’s PATHETIC. But Mike is correct, we are the only ones on the planet (on our side of the ledger) who can do this. Nobody else even close. Question is timing. I feel like now is as good a time as any, given POTUS directive to reopen shipping lanes. I think we should go; but POTUS still retains 24 hours of decision space.”\n\nAt this point, the previously silent “S M” joined the conversation. “As I heard it, the president was clear: green light, but we soon make clear to Egypt and Europe what we expect in return. We also need to figure out how to enforce such a requirement. EG, if Europe doesn’t remunerate, then what? If the US successfully restores freedom of navigation at great cost there needs to be some further economic gain extracted in return.”\n\nA screenshot from the Signal group shows debate over the president’s views ahead of the attack.\n\nThat message from “S M”—presumably President Trump’s confidant Stephen Miller, the deputy White House chief of staff, or someone playing Stephen Miller—effectively shut down the conversation. The last text of the day came from “Pete Hegseth,” who wrote at 9:46 a.m., “Agree.”\n\nAfter reading this chain, I recognized that this conversation possessed a high degree of verisimilitude. The texts, in their word choice and arguments, sounded as if they were written by the people who purportedly sent them, or by a particularly adept AI text generator. I was still concerned that this could be a disinformation operation, or a simulation of some sort. And I remained mystified that no one in the group seemed to have noticed my presence. But if it was a hoax, the quality of mimicry and the level of foreign-policy insight were impressive.\n\nIt was the next morning, Saturday, March 15, when this story became truly bizarre.\n\nAt 11:44 a.m., the account labeled “Pete Hegseth” posted in Signal a “TEAM UPDATE.” I will not quote from this update, or from certain other subsequent texts. The information contained in them, if they had been read by an adversary of the United States, could conceivably have been used to harm American military and intelligence personnel, particularly in the broader Middle East, Central Command’s area of responsibility. What I will say, in order to illustrate the shocking recklessness of this Signal conversation, is that the Hegseth post contained operational details of forthcoming strikes on Yemen, including information about targets, weapons the U.S. would be deploying, and attack sequencing.\n\nThe only person to reply to the update from Hegseth was the person identified as the vice president. “I will say a prayer for victory,” Vance wrote. (Two other users subsequently added prayer emoji.)\n\nAccording to the lengthy Hegseth text, the first detonations in Yemen would be felt two hours hence, at 1:45 p.m. eastern time. So I waited in my car in a supermarket parking lot. If this Signal chat was real, I reasoned, Houthi targets would soon be bombed. At about 1:55, I checked X and searched Yemen. Explosions were then being heard across Sanaa, the capital city.\n\nI went back to the Signal channel. At 1:48, “Michael Waltz” had provided the group an update. Again, I won’t quote from this text, except to note that he described the operation as an “amazing job.” A few minutes later, “John Ratcliffe” wrote, “A good start.” Not long after, Waltz responded with three emoji: a fist, an American flag, and fire. Others soon joined in, including “MAR,” who wrote, “Good Job Pete and your team!!,” and “Susie Wiles,” who texted, “Kudos to all – most particularly those in theater and CENTCOM! Really great. God bless.” “Steve Witkoff” responded with five emoji: two hands-praying, a flexed bicep, and two American flags. “TG” responded, “Great work and effects!” The after-action discussion included assessments of damage done, including the likely death of a specific individual. The Houthi-run Yemeni health ministry reported that at least 53 people were killed in the strikes, a number that has not been independently verified.\n\nA screenshot from the Signal group shows reactions to the strikes.\n\nOn Sunday, Waltz appeared on ABC’s This Week and contrasted the strikes with the Biden administration’s more hesitant approach. “These were not kind of pinprick, back-and-forth—what ultimately proved to be feckless attacks,” he said. “This was an overwhelming response that actually targeted multiple Houthi leaders and took them out.”\n\nThe Signal chat group, I concluded, was almost certainly real. Having come to this realization, one that seemed nearly impossible only hours before, I removed myself from the Signal group, understanding that this would trigger an automatic notification to the group’s creator, “Michael Waltz,” that I had left. No one in the chat had seemed to notice that I was there. And I received no subsequent questions about why I left—or, more to the point, who I was.\n\nEarlier today, I emailed Waltz and sent him a message on his Signal account. I also wrote to Pete Hegseth, John Ratcliffe, Tulsi Gabbard, and other officials. In an email, I outlined some of my questions: Is the “Houthi PC small group” a genuine Signal thread? Did they know that I was included in this group? Was I (on the off chance) included on purpose? If not, who did they think I was? Did anyone realize who I was when I was added, or when I removed myself from the group? Do senior Trump-administration officials use Signal regularly for sensitive discussions? Do the officials believe that the use of such a channel could endanger American personnel?\n\nBrian Hughes, the spokesman for the National Security Council, responded two hours later, confirming the veracity of the Signal group. “This appears to be an authentic message chain, and we are reviewing how an inadvertent number was added to the chain,” Hughes wrote. “The thread is a demonstration of the deep and thoughtful policy coordination between senior officials. The ongoing success of the Houthi operation demonstrates that there were no threats to troops or national security.”\n\nWilliam Martin, a spokesperson for Vance, said that despite the impression created by the texts, the vice president is fully aligned with the president. “The Vice President’s first priority is always making sure that the President’s advisers are adequately briefing him on the substance of their internal deliberations,” he said. “Vice President Vance unequivocally supports this administration’s foreign policy. The President and the Vice President have had subsequent conversations about this matter and are in complete agreement.”\n\nI have never seen a breach quite like this. It is not uncommon for national-security officials to communicate on Signal. But the app is used primarily for meeting planning and other logistical matters—not for detailed and highly confidential discussions of a pending military action. And, of course, I’ve never heard of an instance in which a journalist has been invited to such a discussion.\n\nRead: A conversation with Jeffrey Goldberg about his extraordinary scoop\n\nConceivably, Waltz, by coordinating a national-security-related action over Signal, may have violated several provisions of the Espionage Act, which governs the handling of “national defense” information, according to several national-security lawyers interviewed by my colleague Shane Harris for this story. Harris asked them to consider a hypothetical scenario in which a senior U.S. official creates a Signal thread for the express purpose of sharing information with Cabinet officials about an active military operation. He did not show them the actual Signal messages or tell them specifically what had occurred.\n\nAll of these lawyers said that a U.S. official should not establish a Signal thread in the first place. Information about an active operation would presumably fit the law’s definition of “national defense” information. The Signal app is not approved by the government for sharing classified information. The government has its own systems for that purpose. If officials want to discuss military activity, they should go into a specially designed space known as a sensitive compartmented information facility, or SCIF—most Cabinet-level national-security officials have one installed in their home—or communicate only on approved government equipment, the lawyers said. Normally, cellphones are not permitted inside a SCIF, which suggests that as these officials were sharing information about an active military operation, they could have been moving around in public. Had they lost their phones, or had they been stolen, the potential risk to national security would have been severe.\n\nHegseth, Ratcliffe, and other Cabinet-level officials presumably would have the authority to declassify information, and several of the national-security lawyers noted that the hypothetical officials on the Signal chain might claim that they had declassified the information they shared. But this argument rings hollow, they cautioned, because Signal is not an authorized venue for sharing information of such a sensitive nature, regardless of whether it has been stamped “top secret” or not.\n\nThere was another potential problem: Waltz set some of the messages in the Signal group to disappear after one week, and some after four. That raises questions about whether the officials may have violated federal records law: Text messages about official acts are considered records that should be preserved.\n\n“Under the records laws applicable to the White House and federal agencies, all government employees are prohibited from using electronic-messaging applications such as Signal for official business, unless those messages are promptly forwarded or copied to an official government account,” Jason R. Baron, a professor at the University of Maryland and the former director of litigation at the National Archives and Records Administration, told Harris.\n\n“Intentional violations of these requirements are a basis for disciplinary action. Additionally, agencies such as the Department of Defense restrict electronic messaging containing classified information to classified government networks and/or networks with government-approved encrypted features,” Baron said.\n\nSeveral former U.S. officials told Harris and me that they had used Signal to share unclassified information and to discuss routine matters, particularly when traveling overseas without access to U.S. government systems. But they knew never to share classified or sensitive information on the app, because their phones could have been hacked by a foreign intelligence service, which would have been able to read the messages on the devices. It is worth noting that Donald Trump, as a candidate for president (and as president), repeatedly and vociferously demanded that Hillary Clinton be imprisoned for using a private email server for official business when she was secretary of state. (It is also worth noting that Trump was indicted in 2023 for mishandling classified documents, but the charges were dropped after his election.)\n\nWaltz and the other Cabinet-level officials were already potentially violating government policy and the law simply by texting one another about the operation. But when Waltz added a journalist—presumably by mistake—to his principals committee, he created new security and legal issues. Now the group was transmitting information to someone not authorized to receive it. That is the classic definition of a leak, even if it was unintentional, and even if the recipient of the leak did not actually believe it was a leak until Yemen came under American attack.\n\nAll along, members of the Signal group were aware of the need for secrecy and operations security. In his text detailing aspects of the forthcoming attack on Houthi targets, Hegseth wrote to the group—which, at the time, included me—“We are currently clean on OPSEC.”\n\nShane Harris contributed reporting.",

        "source": "https://www.theatlantic.com/",
        "content": "Updated at 5:20 p.m. ET on April 1, 2025\n\nOne day this fall, while on campus at Brown University, I was met by two students—cellphones raised, cameras recording. They had spun off from a larger group protesting Brown’s decision not to divest from Israel. They recognized me as a trustee of the university and saw an opportunity to take me to task. They followed me for perhaps a block or two, calling me a hypocrite.\n\nFor at least one of the students, the war in Gaza was not some cause du jour that he’d picked up from TikTok. He has Palestinian relatives on the ground. I knew this because I’d spoken with him before. That time, he was passionate but measured. Now, in protest mode, he was angry. I’m sure he felt betrayed by the decision, and I was one of the only people he could hold—at least verbally—accountable.\n\nUnderstandably, some of my colleagues who were singled out by protesters were more rattled by the experience. But in my view, these were students in America doing what students in America should do: questioning authority (in this case, me) and using their rights to free speech and free assembly to engage with issues they are passionate about.\n\nThat is not to say I didn’t find this period of campus unrest unpleasant or this particular incident annoying. No one likes to be called a hypocrite and accused of being indifferent to human suffering. And certainly no one wants to be shouted at. But I never for a moment felt that these students were a threat to me, let alone to America’s national security.\n\nAnd yet, that is the justification the United States government is offering for its decision to revoke the visas and green cards of international students who have spoken out against the war in Gaza.\n\nWhen I read about the detention of Rümeysa Öztürk, the first thing I thought is that she must have been very hungry. The Tufts University doctoral student had been fasting since dawn when a group of hooded and masked plainclothes officers surrounded her near her home in Somerville, Massachusetts. I imagine that the friends who were planning to host her for iftar that evening were merrily preparing their table, oblivious that Öztürk had been seized in the street, handcuffed like a criminal, and put inside the back of an unmarked car in what looked, to passersby, like “a kidnapping.” Perhaps, when Öztürk didn’t respond to their texts, the friends—all hungry themselves—began without her. Their concern must have curdled into fear as the night wore on.\n\nÖztürk’s friends and colleagues were shocked when they learned what had happened. They must have known, of course, about the detentions of students at other universities that began in early March with the seizure of Mahmoud Khalil from his New York City apartment. Khalil, a recent Columbia University graduate and a green-card holder born in a refugee enclave in Syria, was a pro-Palestinian activist and one of the organizers of a march where some attendees praised Hamas. Although the Trump administration has not accused Khalil of any crime, it has portrayed him as a radical terrorist.\n\nBut Öztürk was different. “The only thing I know of that Rümeysa’s organized,” one of her friends told reporters, “was a Thanksgiving potluck.” No one seemed more stunned than Öztürk herself, who was chatting on the phone with her mother when the officers swarmed.\n\nUndocumented immigrants are used to living in fear of ICE knocking on their door. But Öztürk is not undocumented. She is one of the roughly 1 million international students studying in the United States this academic year. She came from Turkey at the invitation of an American university, an invitation made possible by the State Department through the student-visa program. As long as Öztürk stayed out of legal trouble (which she had) and remained enrolled in school full-time (which she had), she had no reason to expect that she could be removed from the life she had been building here.\n\nÖztürk was apparently detained because she co-wrote an op-ed for The Tufts Daily last year. When a reporter asked Secretary of State Marco Rubio why Öztürk’s visa was revoked, he replied that if a student applying for a visa said up front “that the reason you’re coming is not just because you want to write op-eds but because you want to participate in movements that are involved in doing things like vandalizing universities, harassing students, taking over buildings, creating a ruckus, we’re not going to give you a visa.” If a student took part in “that sort of activity” once here, he said, the government has the “right to remove you.” He added, “We’re looking every day for these lunatics.”\n\nNo one has alleged that Öztürk vandalized or took over any buildings. Did the op-ed create a ruckus? It urged the administration to take more seriously a vote from the student senate calling on the university to divest from Israel. In the context of the Israel-Palestine discourse of spring 2024, the op-ed is civility at its finest. In the context of op-eds, it is a snooze.\n\nRubio has been leaning on a Cold War–era law that he says allows him to personally revoke green cards and visas. The law refers to immigrants whose presence in this country the government has “reasonable grounds” to believe could “have potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences for the United States.” A former head of America’s Immigration Lawyers Association pointed out that this provision of the law has not been applied since 1997.\n\nWelcome to Donald Trump’s America, where the Cabinet texting about war plans on a nongovernmental messaging app is “not a big deal,” but an op-ed in a school paper is a threat to national security.\n\nRead: The Trump administration accidentally texted me its war plans\n\nRubio says he has signed off on deporting or revoking the visas of 300 or more people, an unknown portion of whom are student activists. Some have been snatched from their home or the sidewalks outside. Others, such as Rasha Alawieh, a medical-school professor at Brown whose H1-B visa was sponsored by Brown Medicine, have been turned away at the airport. In at least a few cases, more than a day went by before anyone figured out where the disappeared students had been taken.\n\nRubio’s interpretation of the law is just one more example of the Trump administration’s attempts to change America from a nation of rights to a nation of privileges that can at any moment be revoked. “We gave you a visa to come study and get a degree,” Rubio said about the students, “not to become a social activist that tears up our university campuses.”\n\nGreen cards may be a privilege, but once they reach American soil, these students also have rights—to speak freely, to peacefully convene, to enjoy due process under the law. Those rights don’t depend on citizenship status; they are embedded in the founding of this country. The students do not, as Rubio correctly points out, have the right to “tear up” campuses. But they absolutely can become social activists about any political issue they choose.\n\nCriticism—even at its most odious—does not imperil a nation any more than being yelled at by students imperiled me. How could I hold my head high as an American if I didn’t defend their right to tell me what they think?",

        "title": "Can I Teach the First Amendment If I Only Have a Green Card?",
        "source": "https://www.theatlantic.com/",
        "content": "Updated at 10:10 a.m. ET on April 2, 2024\n\nStarting this week, I once again have the privilege of teaching law students about the First Amendment, a subject in which Americans rightly take great pride. But this term, the job will feel very different. I am in the United States on a green card, and recent events suggest that I should be careful in what I say—perhaps even about free speech.\n\nAs I prepare my lecture notes, the Trump administration is working to deport immigrants, including green-card holders, for what appears to be nothing more than the expression of political views with which the government disagrees. These actions are chilling. They also make it difficult to work out how to teach cases that boldly proclaim this country is committed to a vision of free speech that, right now, feels very far away.\n\nIn recent weeks, the Trump administration has been—is there any other way to describe it?—rounding up dissidents. Government agents whisked one student off the street into an unmarked car, apparently for the thought crime of co-authoring an op-ed about Israel and Gaza in a student newspaper—an article that likely reached only a modest audience until the government made it grounds for detention. The administration arrested Mahmoud Khalil, a recent Columbia University graduate, on his way home from dinner, in front of his pregnant wife, not for any crime but for his participation in pro-Palestinian protests. Headline after headline has spoken of similar cases around the country, and the administration shows no sign of letting up. To more easily chase down people with ideas it dislikes, the government is asking universities for the names and nationalities of people who took part in largely peaceful protests and engaged in protected speech.\n\nExactly what kind of expression gets you in trouble is not clear—no doubt that’s partly the point. As Donald Trump’s offensive rapidly escalates, no one can be sure they are safe. Is publicly criticizing the administration’s speech suppression risky? I genuinely don’t know.\n\nFrom the May 2025 issue: America’s future is Hungary\n\nNone of these actions is consistent with the vision of America depicted in bedrock First Amendment cases. The ruling in New York Times v. Sullivan describes a “profound national commitment to the principle that debate on public issues should be uninhibited, robust, and wide-open,” a quote the Court likes to invoke often. The claim has bolstered the U.S. Constitution’s reputation as the most speech-protective in the world, which inspires patriotism for lawyers and non-lawyers alike. But this country’s free-speech tradition depends on far more than words in a centuries-old legal document—and as we are learning, those words might mean very little in the absence of a broad societal commitment to upholding them.\n\nMy native country, Australia, does not have an explicit constitutional protection for free speech. Its defamation and hate-speech laws would likely appall First Amendment true believers. Given this acculturation, I arrived in America perhaps reflexively skeptical of a doctrine that protects a lot of genuinely harmful expression. But over the years, I have been convinced that empowering the government to punish speech also empowers it to target its critics.\n\nOne does not need to look overseas for a different approach to free speech, though. We need only look back in time. Indeed, one thing that always surprises students in First Amendment classes is how recent and fragile the famously speech-protective modern doctrine is. Many assume that free speech is an indelible part of American culture that stretches back to the founding era. Far from it. This country’s free-speech tradition is much younger, and its victories hard-fought.\n\nIn the early 20th century, the first Red Scare led state and federal governments to enact, and courts to uphold, highly restrictive speech laws. Dissidents were locked up for circulating pamphlets and articles opposing the American war effort in World War I; a Socialist Party presidential candidate, Eugene Debs, was jailed for a speech that criticized the draft.\n\nRulings upholding repressive laws stood for decades but ultimately came to be seen as an embarrassment and a stain on this country’s history. When I was studying the First Amendment after arriving in the United States, my professor, Richard Fallon, told us that “if there is any travesty in the history of the First Amendment that ought not to be repeated, it is what happened to Eugene Debs.”\n\nFirst Amendment courses invariably then turn to the heroic dissents and concurrences of Justices Oliver Wendell Holmes and Louis Brandeis, which are now cited and celebrated for expressing the true meaning of the First Amendment. These opinions do not minimize the harm that speech can cause but argue that democracy and the pursuit of truth require bravery. “Those who won our independence by revolution were not cowards. They did not fear political change,” Brandeis wrote. The Constitution therefore demands that “if there be time to expose through discussion the falsehood and fallacies, to avert the evil by the processes of education, the remedy to be applied is more speech, not enforced silence.”\n\nIn subsequent decades, these canonical opinions ushered in a free-speech tradition that interpreted the First Amendment expansively and in rousing terms. Majority opinions would come to describe a Constitution whose “fixed star” is that “no official, high or petty, can prescribe what shall be orthodox in politics, nationalism, religion, or other matters of opinion”; whose “proudest boast” is that “we protect the freedom to express ‘the thought that we hate’”; whose critics more often fault it for protecting too much speech, not too little.\n\nThe First Amendment tradition that has evolved over the past century is not unfailingly robust. For example, a 2010 Supreme Court decision upheld a law banning certain forms of speech that are classified as “material support” to foreign terrorist groups—in that case, the speech included training designated groups on how to pursue their aims peacefully. But even in that case, which upheld a stunningly broad speech restriction, the Court also insisted that nothing in its opinion undermined the general principle that advocacy of unlawful action is protected so long as it is not done in coordination with terrorist groups.\n\nThe Trump administration argues that, however strong speech protections are for citizens, noncitizens “don’t have a right to be in the United States to begin with,” as Secretary of State Marco Rubio recently put it. Rather, we are here at the pleasure of the government and can be exiled if we say the wrong thing. The first word in permanent resident seems not to mean what I thought.\n\nRead: We study repression in Turkey. Now we see it here.\n\nThis argument is impossible to reconcile with the principle that the Court said last year rests “at the heart of the First Amendment”: that such “viewpoint discrimination is uniquely harmful to a free and democratic society.” (The Court held that attempts by a New York State official to pressure companies to stop doing business with the National Rifle Association because she did not like the group’s gun-rights advocacy would violate the First Amendment.) The administration’s argument also ignores citizens’ right to hear what noncitizens have to say; in 1965, the Court held that the government cannot restrict Americans’ right to read even Chinese propaganda. The administration’s position makes you wonder what noncitizens have to say that is so scary that it cannot be rebutted with more speech. And perhaps most important of all, to accept this argument is to assume—without any good reason that I can see—that this punishment of dissent will stop with foreigners.\n\nMy students will surely ask whether the events in recent headlines are consistent with the First Amendment principles that I am teaching them. And I find myself in the surreal position of wondering whether my answer could endanger my own place in this country, for which I am very grateful. Noncitizens are making calculations like these every day now. Recently, the NPR journalist Michel Martin interviewed Deputy Secretary of Homeland Security Troy Edgar about the deportation of Khalil, the former Columbia student. “This is a person that came in under a visa,” Edgar said. “And again, the secretary of state at any point can take a look and evaluate that visa and decide if they want to revoke it.” Edgar repeatedly refused to answer Martin’s simple question: “Is any criticism of the United States government a deportable offense?”\n\nSo of course your noncitizen neighbors are hesitating before saying what they think, wondering whether speaking their mind is worth the risk of deportation, detention, or problems at the border. The chilling effect is not just for noncitizens: As many powerful institutions in American society seem to be acceding to Trump’s demands, of course those less powerful will stay silent. Prominently punish enough critics, and there will cease to be critics to punish. This is exactly the world that the First Amendment promised to prevent.\n\nOne of the sad ironies of the current moment is that the Trump administration also claims that it is waging a war against censorship. It is trying to argue that deporting people for expressing views the administration dislikes “is not about free speech.” But as I work out what to say in the classroom this week, I know that isn’t true.",

        "content": "The now-famous white paper has proved to be a good road map for what the administration has done so far, and what may yet be on the way.\n\nThis article was featured in the One Story to Read Today newsletter. Sign up for it here.\n\n“Freedom is a fragile thing, and it’s never more than one generation away from extinction,” Ronald Reagan said in 1967, in his inaugural address as governor of California. Kevin D. Roberts, the president of the Heritage Foundation, approvingly quotes the speech in his foreword to Project 2025, the conservative think tank’s blueprint for the Trump administration. Roberts writes that the plan has four goals for protecting its vision of freedom: restoring the family “as the centerpiece of American life”; dismantling the federal bureaucracy; defending U.S. “sovereignty, borders, and bounty”; and securing “our God-given individual rights to live freely.”\n\nProject 2025 has proved to be a good road map for understanding the first months of Donald Trump’s second term, but most of the focus has been on efforts to dismantle the federal government as we know it. The effort to restore traditional families has been less prominent so far, but it could reshape the everyday lives of all Americans in fundamental ways. Its place atop the list of priorities is no accident—it reflects the most deeply held views of many of the contributors—though the destruction of the administrative state might end up imperiling the Trump team’s ability to actually carry out the changes the authors want.\n\nA focus on heterosexual, married, procreating couples is everywhere in Project 2025. “Families comprised of a married mother, father, and their children are the foundation of a well-­ordered nation and healthy society,” writes Roger Severino, the author of a chapter on the Department of Health and Human Services and a former HHS and Justice Department staffer. (The document is structured as a series of chapters on specific departments or agencies, each written by one or a few authors.) He argues that the federal government should bolster organizations that “maintain a biblically based, social-­science-reinforced definition of marriage and family,” saying that other forms are less stable. The goal is not only moral; he and other authors see this as a path to financial stability and perhaps even greater prosperity for families.\n\nThis article has been adapted from David A. Graham’s new book, The Project.\n\nProject 2025’s authors identify a range of ways to achieve the goal across the executive branch. Changes to rules for 401(k)s and other savings programs would be more generous to married couples. HHS would enlist churches and other faith-­based organizations to “provide marriage and parenting guidance for low-­income fathers” that would “affirm and teach” based on “a biological and sociological understanding of what it means to be a father—­not a gender-neutral parent—­from social science, psychology, personal testimonies, etc.” Through educational programs, tax incentives, and other methods, the child-support system “should strengthen marriage as the norm, restore broken homes, and encourage unmarried couples to commit to marriage.” Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, the lead federal welfare program, would track statistics about “marriage, healthy family formation, and delaying sex to prevent pregnancy.”\n\nJonathan Rauch: One word describes Trump\n\nIn this vision, men are breadwinners and women are mothers. “Without women, there are no children, and society cannot continue,” Max Primorac writes in his chapter on USAID, where he served in the first Trump administration. (Primorac calls for ridding the agency of “woke” politics and using it as an instrument of U.S. policy, but not the complete shutdown Trump has attempted.) Jonathan Berry writes that the Department of Labor, where he previously worked, would “commit to honest study of the challenges for women in the world of professional work” and seek to “understand the true causes of earnings gaps between men and women.” (This sounds a lot like research predetermined to reach an outcome backing the traditional family.) The Labor Department would produce monthly data on “the state of the American family and its economic welfare,” and the Education Department would provide student data sorted by family structure. Severino suggests that the government either pay parents (most likely mothers) to offset the cost of caring for children, or pay for in-­home care from family members; he opposes universal day care, which many on the right see as encouraging women to work rather than stay home with kids.\n\nAll of this fits a very conservative worldview, but in some places common ground emerges that might cut across typical partisan lines. For example, in a convergence of the crunchy left and natalist right, Severino wants doulas to be available to all expectant mothers. Contra Severino, Berry suggests that the Labor Department create incentives for on-site child care at work. He also wants Congress to require employers to let workers accumulate paid time off when working overtime, in place of time-and-­a-half pay, and to encourage rest time for workers by mandating time-and-a-half compensation on a Sabbath. (The suggested default would be Sunday, but the rule would allow for alternatives such as a Jewish Sabbath, running from Friday sundown to Saturday sundown.)\n\nTurning these ideas into reality would require substantial engagement from the federal bureaucracy. Yet Trump and Elon Musk have spent the first months of the presidency haphazardly demolishing large swaths of the workforce at just the departments that would be necessary to make these things happen. Trump is attempting to dissolve the Education Department altogether; HHS has offered a buyout to every employee.\n\nThe parts of this family-oriented agenda that the Trump administration has already moved to enact are some of those that enforce a strictly binary concept of gender, aiming to drive trans and nonbinary people underground; open them up to discrimination at work, at school, and in the rest of their lives; and erase their very existence from the language of the federal government.\n\n“In the past, the word ‘gender’ was a polite alternative to the word ‘sex’ or term ‘biological sex,’” Primorac writes. “The Left has commandeered the term ‘gender,’ which used to mean either ‘male’ or ‘female,’ to include a spectrum of others who are seeking to alter biological and societal sexual norms.”\n\nOn his first day in office, Trump signed an executive order that purports to define sex as binary. “It is the policy of the United States to recognize two sexes, male and female. These sexes are not changeable and are grounded in fundamental and incontrovertible reality,” the order states. “Efforts to eradicate the biological reality of sex fundamentally attack women by depriving them of their dignity, safety, and well-being.” The order also dissolved the White House Gender Policy Council, created by former President Joe Biden.\n\nTrump also signed an executive order banning transgender women from women’s sports. The Defense Department says it will not accept transgender recruits for the armed forces, and will begin kicking out transgender service members currently in the military. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission has moved to drop a discrimination case focused on gender identity, and the Education Department says it will enforce Title IX only to consider “biological sex.”\n\nPeter Wehner: Trump’s appetite for revenge is insatiable\n\nRight-wing leaders have made attacks on trans people and nontraditional expressions of gender a cornerstone of right-wing politics over the past few years. They have spread disinformation about trans people and panicked over the prospect of children adopting different gender identities or names at school. What is the reason for so much fear? Transgender people make up less than 2 percent of the population, and their presence in society doesn’t evidently harm other people. Project 2025’s pro-­family orientation helps explain why the right considers them such a threat. A worldview that sees gender roles as strictly delineated and immutable cannot acknowledge the existence of trans people or anything else that contemplates an alternative to a total separation between what it means to be male and what it means to be female.\n\nTrump has not yet made stricter abortion policies a focus in his new term. Though he has boasted about appointing Supreme Court justices who overturned Roe v. Wade, he seems wary of pushing further, for fear of political backlash. Project 2025 has no such qualms. Severino recommends withdrawing FDA approval for abortion drugs, banning their prescription via telehealth, and using 1873’s Comstock Act to prohibit their mailing. He also recommends a strong federal surveillance program over abortion at the state level. Project 2025 also calls for the return of abstinence-only education and the criminalization of pornography.\n\nWith a little imagination, we can glimpse the America that Project 2025 proposes. It is an avowedly Christian nation, but following a very specific, narrow strain of Christianity. In many ways, it resembles the 1950s. While fathers work, mothers stay at home with larger families. At school, students learn old-­fashioned values and lessons. Abortion is illegal, vaccines are voluntary, and the state is minimally involved in health care. The government is slow to police racial discrimination in all but its most blatant expressions. Trans and LGBTQ people exist—­they always have—­but are encouraged to remain closeted. It is a vision that suggests Reagan was right: Freedom ­really is a fragile thing.\n\nThis article has been adapted from David A. Graham’s new book, The Project.",

        "content": "One Friday afternoon 10 years ago, Andrew Heaton, then a cable-news writer, joined his colleagues for a meeting. The show’s producer asked the staff to keep an eye on their email over the weekend in case they needed to cover a breaking news event. No one seemed to mind—working full days in person while remaining on call in the evening and on weekends has always been a standard practice in the news business—but Heaton had a simple request.\n\nHe said he would be happy to go in but asked if his boss could call him on the phone instead of emailing him. He didn’t want to spend his time off continually monitoring his inbox for a message that might not even come.\n\n“It would have been just me, tethered to my phone all weekend, checking email for no purpose,” Heaton, who now hosts a political podcast, told me. “I think it’s a very valid request that you just call me so I don’t have to dedicate 10 percent of my brain to this job forever.”\n\nHis boss agreed. The big news never materialized.\n\nHeaton was onto something. In the United States, employees work more hours than those in many other rich nations. As more white-collar employers require their staff to be in the office full-time again, workers have the right to demand something in exchange: a return to the norms of the 1990s, before smartphones made everyone instantly reachable. (Bosses, of course, have the right to say no to all this.)\n\nRead: Life really is better without the internet\n\nI’m aware that offices in that era were not perfect—satires such as Office Space and Fight Club brilliantly mined the hopelessness of cubicle life then. But at least Lumbergh couldn’t ask about your TPS reports while you were in your home bathroom. Smartphones have created a culture in which Americans are constantly at work in one form or another, even when they’re at home. And it is stressing people out. A 2016 study found that the mere expectation of unread email can cause stress and emotional exhaustion. The presumption that workers should respond to email at any time, the study’s authors concluded, “contributes to experience of work overload” because it inhibits employees’ “ability to psychologically detach from work-related issues.”\n\nFor most of my career, I measured an embarrassing level of self-worth through my job. I spent years as a political correspondent obsessing over work at all hours, even in the middle of the night, when I routinely answered emails and made story edits in the dark between bouts of sleep. Jonathan Malesic, the author of The End of Burnout, told me that work defines many people. “We just can’t imagine that a person is worth something if we aren’t working,” Malesic said. “You’re anxious about your worth. And the only way you know how to prove it is you’re working all the time. As soon as you’re not, your value is in question.”\n\nI have recently gone to great lengths to draw a line between home and work. Two years ago, my family and I disconnected the internet from our house. I recently traded my smartphone for a flip phone. As much as possible, my work as a writer and university instructor is completed at the workplace, and my attention is on my family while I’m at home, a balance I was never able to achieve before we disconnected. I still bring some work home with me—papers to grade, books to review, articles to write—but I’m not constantly checking whether someone is trying to contact me. My employer knows my landline number and can call if needed.\n\nThough the always-on work culture has existed in many companies and industries since the advent of BlackBerries and iPhones, the expectation to be reachable at all times was solidified during the coronavirus pandemic, when millions of Americans worked from their couches, relying on communication apps such as Zoom, Slack, and email. The pandemic era also made the workday looser, which allowed people to complete tasks while attending to home or family needs but meant that working hours could begin early in the day or extend late into the night.\n\nFor millions of people, those days of flexible work are ending. Many corporations and organizations, including the nation’s largest employer, the federal government, are winding down or ending remote work. McKinsey & Company reported that in 2024, the number of people working at least four days a week from an office had doubled to 68 percent, from 34 percent a year earlier. Disney, Amazon, and JP Morgan Chase have called employees back to their desks over the past few years. As in-person attendance again becomes the norm, workers risk having the worst of both worlds: the requirement that they give their days fully to the office and remain available to their bosses from home on nights and weekends.\n\nYou might not be able to go completely MIA after the daily 9 to 5. But you can insist that anyone who wants to reach you after-hours make a telephone call. Let your supervisor ring you at 7:45 p.m. and hear your frazzled tone as you balance your phone on your shoulder while trying to give your unruly kids a bath. Let your boss hear the clanking of silverware on dishes when he interrupts dinner with your roommates. Employers should stop pretending that doing business at all hours isn’t an imposition on employees, even if it is sometimes a necessary one. Let the person delivering the message bear some of the cost, too.\n\nArthur C. Brooks: How to break a phone addiction\n\nBefore smartphones, leaving the office at the end of the day and enjoying your life without the fear of interruption wasn’t radical; it was typical. And setting boundaries against after-hours intrusions has precedent today as well. In 2016, the French government adopted a “right to disconnect” law that allows workers the freedom to not respond to messages from employers outside of established working hours. Ireland, Belgium, Australia, and other nations have instituted similar restrictions. Last year, state legislators in California and New Jersey proposed their own bills.\n\nBut the U.S. federal government is unlikely to pass this sort of legislation, and many American workers may struggle to set clear boundaries on their own. Sarah Jaffe, the author of Work Won’t Love You Back, told me she was skeptical about whether our nation’s workers would ever feel comfortable enough to stand up for themselves like this. “Most employers are not going to go for it,” Jaffe said. “They like to be able to call you at any point in time to lengthen your workday indefinitely.”\n\nAs much as many Americans complain about their relationship to work, Malesic told me, we don’t do much about it when it comes to the types of leaders we elect or the labor protections we demand. “If Americans were really as upset about our working lives as we claim, I think our politics would look a lot different,” he said. “People complain about their job invading their life all the time,” but many, for instance, “show very little interest in electing pro-union politicians.”\n\nI know that protecting evenings and weekends can be easier said than done. And doing so might be near impossible for people whose work requires them to be instantly reachable, such as first responders or others in the business of saving lives. But other workers, when they’re done for the day, should be able to power down those Slack and email notifications. When they cross the threshold of their office doors, they should feel free to exit mentally as well as physically. If companies want employees to work like it’s the ’90s, then they should work like it’s the ’90s.",

        "content": "Subscribe here: Apple Podcasts | Spotify | YouTube | Overcast | Pocket Casts\n\nThe Atlantic published more details from a Signal chat between President Donald Trump’s top advisers that included sensitive details about a military strike in Yemen. The group chat, created by National Security Adviser Michael Waltz, included several high-level administration members, including Vice President J. D. Vance, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, CIA Director John Ratcliffe, and an account called “TG,” the initials of the director of national intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard. In screenshots published by The Atlantic, the defense secretary messaged information about strike targets and times of attack. Brian Hughes, the spokesman for the National Security Council, confirmed the veracity of the chat.\n\nThe report of the security breakdown launched hundreds of memes, and group chats across the country were jokingly renamed “Houthi PC Small Group.” Amid the snickering in Washington, D.C., were also denials—from Gabbard, Hegseth, Ratcliffe, and President Trump—both to reporters and in congressional hearings, that the information in the chat was classified.\n\nWe talk with Shane Harris, a national-security reporter for The Atlantic, about how he would characterize the messages and what kind of reverberations to expect from this breach.\n\nThe following is a transcript of the episode:\n\nClaudine Ebeid: This is Radio Atlantic. I’m Claudine Ebeid, in for Hanna Rosin. On Monday, The Atlantic reported that our editor in chief, Jeffrey Goldberg, was added to a Signal group chat. It was a thread with senior Trump administration officials that included sensitive military information about an attack on Houthi targets in Yemen.\n\nOn the day of the attack, March 15, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth shared operational details two hours before the strikes. And Brian Hughes, the spokesman for the National Security Council, confirmed the veracity of the chat.\n\nEarlier this week, Jeff and Atlantic staff writer Shane Harris were on the show. Since then, administration officials have roundly denied there was any classified information in the thread, including in testimony before Congress.\n\nMark Warner: Director Gabbard, you are the security executive and set access guidelines for classified information. Did you contact the defense secretary or others after this specific military planning was put out and say: Hey—we should be doing this in a SCIF? Tulsi Gabbard: There was no classified material that was shared in that Signal chat. Warner: So then if there [is] no classified material, share it with the committee.\n\nEbeid: With me now is Shane Harris, who covers national security. Hi, Shane.\n\nShane Harris: Hi.\n\nEbeid: So Shane, we just heard Democratic Senator Mark Warner questioning Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard. She and other administration officials have reiterated that there was no classified information in the Signal chat.\n\nWhat was your reaction to the administration’s response after the original story was published?\n\nHarris: My reaction was Well, if what we’re looking at in these texts isn’t classified information, then maybe I don’t know what classified information is. (Laughs.) I’ve been doing this a while, and look—I mean, I don’t understand their argument here.\n\nThis information is presumptively classified, and I don’t think you have to take my word for it. You can actually go look at DOD regulations and intelligence regulations that are available online, and there are helpful tables where in one column it will, you know, list the descriptions of kinds of information and then tell you their relevant classification status, where they should be set.\n\nAnd there are all kinds of different categories that are implicated in this text chain—in particular, when we’re talking about things like these strike plans that you just heard Senator Warner ask Director Gabbard about that Secretary Hegseth had shared.\n\nYou know, if you look just at the government’s own guidelines, the kinds of information that are in here are presumptively classified. So I don’t know where the basis for this claim—I could take a stab at why I think politically they’re making it—but as a legal or a sort of security matter, I don’t know what the foundation for that claim is.\n\nEbeid: Since that response, The Atlantic published the text of the Signal chat, including information that was previously left out of Monday’s story. So what can you tell me about making that decision?\n\nHarris: Well, there were two things that were driving that for us. One was that, you know, to our surprise, officials—including, you know, the DNI, the CIA director, the White House spokesperson, and ultimately the president himself—weighed in on this on Tuesday, saying that the information in the thread was unclassified. Which was, you know, kind of just say, Okay, well, then is it not considered sensitive? I mean, can this be shared?\n\nAnd the other thing was that administration officials, including the president, were attacking our journalism. And they were implying or claiming that we were deceiving the public, that if the public saw them, they would see that actually, you know, Jeff and the editors of The Atlantic were lying to them about what they really said.\n\nAnd so I think that we felt an obligation in that way to show people, Look—this is what is in these messages. You can decide for yourself if we’re being honest with you. And by the way, this is everything that the president says is unclassified and his top advisers say is unclassified.\n\nEbeid: And, you know, the idea of what counts as classified information and what doesn’t, who determines what’s classified, and when it’s classified—these are not new questions in your line of work. But for people without your background, can you tell us a little bit more about how we should think about these arguments around what it means for something to be classified?\n\nHarris: So think of it this way: Information is classified. By information, I’m talking about—it could be anything, and the government classifies a lot of things. It’s classified according to the damage that would be done if the information were publicly released. So you have different levels of classification.\n\nYou have “Secret.” Above that, you have “Top Secret.” Above that, you have something called “Top Secret / SCI.” And then even within that level, you have different, what are called, “compartments” of information. That is essentially information that can only be known by those with a need-to-know who are read into a particular compartment, so the really kind of super-secret stuff, you can think of it.\n\nAnd those labels are put on pieces of information to let people in the government who are handling this information know how to handle it, how much to restrict it, who’s allowed to see it. It’s essentially like a coding system that, again, is based on the damage that would be done if it were known outside of these closed circles of people who need to know it.\n\nSo who decides what information is classified? Senior-level government officials often have that authority. Secretaries of defense, of state have what’s called “original classification authority.” Pete Hegseth can mark something classified if he wants to. He can also begin the process to declassify something if he wants to do that.\n\nAnd this really is, I mean, usually something that is done on an agency-by-agency or department-by-department basis. So the Defense Department kind of categorizes all of its classified information. And the CIA does the same for its classified information. And it really, it’s just—I mean, when we talk about something being classified, usually what it really means at base is: It’s sensitive. It’s information that the agency doesn’t want a lot of people to know about or doesn’t want people outside the kind of cleared circle to know about. That’s probably the best way to think about it.\n\nEbeid: And you saw the texts. Based on what you know, is there a category that you would have put those texts? A level of classification?\n\nHarris: I would’ve presumed they were top secret, which is not to say that that’s the most most secret, but I would’ve presumed that they were at least top secret, because you’re talking about information about a military attack that’s about to happen.\n\nYou know, Hegseth is sharing things like the time that F-18s are going to launch, when they will be releasing their weapons, what the follow-on attacks will be, by what kind of aircraft, by what kind of weapons. This is sensitive information because if this fell into the hands of an adversary, the adversary is going to know how to try to avoid the attack or potentially launch a counterattack, which then, that could also jeopardize the lives of U.S. forces, who are already, you know, flying into harm’s way because the Houthis have antiaircraft capabilities. They can try to shoot these planes down, and we know that.\n\nSo why would you want information like this to be in an unsecured channel, where it could fall into the hands of somebody who could, you know, give it to your adversary? And obviously, that didn’t happen here, but this case kind of exemplifies why they shouldn’t be using Signal to begin with. If they’d been having these conversations on a secure government system, it would be impossible to have added Jeffrey Goldberg to that chat.\n\nSo this is why Signal is not well suited for sharing this kind of information. Talking about things in a more broad sense or unclassified or not highly sensitive information? Sure. And lots of officials do that. And there are instances in which that is fine and condoned, but I have yet to find anybody who can tell me that this kind of information is fine to share in Signal.\n\nI just—I think it’s not. And if these officials have made a determination that it is, I think they owe the public an explanation for that. Instead, what they’ve done is insist it’s unclassified, which implies it’s not terribly sensitive, and they’ve attacked us for reporting about it.\n\nEbeid: So this isn’t the first time we’ve had a scandal around sensitive information. We’ve, of course, you know, had the Hillary Clinton email saga. There’s that Donald Trump was indicted over classified documents in Florida before the case was dropped after his election. Could you put this breach in the context of those past episodes?\n\nHarris: Yeah. I think if you take the Hillary Clinton email server kind of at one end of severity, which is to say kind of a lower end—it’s not insignificant; I want to emphasize that—and then you put the Donald Trump taking classified documents to Mar-a-Lago, for which he’s indicted, at the high end of severity, because here we’re talking about boxes of paper classified documents in an unsecured place, lots of people milling about, I think that this Signal chat falls somewhere in the middle of that. And maybe closer to the Hillary Clinton email side.\n\nAnd the reason I say that is because, look: If Jeff had not been in the room, it’s possible that these would’ve been the only people who knew about it. So that’s to some degree, as in to say, these officials—who are all clear to have this information, by the way—there’s no question that they’re allowed to see what was in the room.\n\nIt’s a question of the way it was transmitted, and the risk that goes with that. There is the obvious risk that, you know, someone could be in the room that wasn’t supposed to be there. But there’s another risk that we haven’t talked about, which is that the devices themselves, the phones on which Signal is running for these 17 or so officials, could those phones have been compromised by a foreign government or by a criminal government?\n\nEbeid: Right. Could they be hacked?\n\nHarris: Could they be hacked? Exactly. And if they were hacked, that means somebody could theoretically be reading the messages as if they were standing there holding the phone themselves.\n\nAnd this is not theoretical. The government, just in recent days, has put out guidance to people who are using Signal, including officials who are using it, warning them about the vulnerabilities that Signal has to foreign-intelligence services. And there are questions about, was Signal running on these officials’ government phones, which we would hope have a pretty high degree of security, or their personal phones, which are under their personal recognizance that might not be as secure as a government phone? So that, I think, tilts it a little more towards the severe side, but I think it’s in the middle of those two scandals.\n\nEbeid: What consequences do you expect for the officials who are on the group chat? Actually, maybe I should ask, given your years of experience, how would you typically expect an administration to respond to this kind of situation?\n\nHarris: The typical response to this would be—I think it’d be twofold.\n\nOne, I think the officials would be humiliated. They’d be highly embarrassed, and if they were thinking about their reputations would probably try to come out and maybe try and do something to soften the blow, but essentially take responsibility for it. I would expect in any other administration, the national security adviser probably would’ve offered the president his resignation, and the president might have taken it.\n\nThe other thing that would happen here is that there would be an investigation, and probably the FBI would do that investigation. The reason for that is: Although this is a very novel example of a classified leak—putting aside that the government says it’s not classified—it’s still a leak. It’s still a leak, and when there is sensitive information that falls into the hands of people who aren’t supposed to have it, the FBI usually investigates that, particularly if—you know, it’s publicly known in this case. But the agencies in question whose information was implicated, what they would normally do is refer that to the FBI and say: We’d like you to investigate this and find out how it happened.\n\nAnd then, of course, part of that investigation would be to determine whether or not there are criminal charges that should be filed. I don’t think that’s likely to happen in this case. I don’t think it’d be likely to happen, by the way, in another administration. The law—this is a strange case. I don’t imagine anyone would be prosecuted, but they’re certainly not gonna be prosecuted in the Trump administration.\n\nEbeid: There is a lawsuit now filed against administration officials for, you know, violating federal recordkeeping laws. Do you think something could come of that?\n\nHarris: Now, that’s possible. I mean, there’s a question of standing. You know, does the plaintiff have standing to bring it? But it’s a really good point. It’s worth just dwelling on a second. There are two records laws that are implicated here: the Federal Records Act and the Presidential Records Act.\n\nAnd in a nutshell, what they require is that if people are going to use a text-messaging service—or any electronic service, for that matter—that’s not an official one, that’s not, like, a .gov service, they’ve gotta make a backup of those communications if they are pertaining to official matters. CIA Director John Ratcliffe actually was testifying earlier this week and mentioned this very fact as a way of defending the CIA’s use of Signal—or what he characterized as the CIA’s use of Signal—which he portrayed as widespread.\n\nI’m not really sure that’s true, but he accurately said that you have to keep a record of these messages if you’re sending them. So there might be some legs to a lawsuit that alleges these officials were violating those records laws.\n\n[Music]\n\nEbeid: More with Shane Harris after the break.\n\n\n\n[Break]\n\nEbeid: You know, Shane, I think I’ve received more text messages—and I should say, messages in Signal—about this story than anything in a very long time.\n\nHarris: Do people want to make a “Houthi PC small group” chat room too?\n\nEbeid: Oh man, let me tell you, all my groups have been renamed this week. But I can’t imagine what kind of responses you’re getting. What are you hearing from people in the intelligence community?\n\nHarris: I think people—what I’m hearing is a mix of people being appalled, outraged, a lot of, If I had done this, I’d be fired. If I had done this, I would be investigated and indicted. There’s a real sense of anger, I think, at what people see as the hypocrisy of these officials and sort of having a “fine for me and not for thee” attitude when it comes to what is ultimately just a really reckless use of technology. I really don’t think there’s any way around that. And I think a real sense, too, among people, including people who don’t work in the government, who I’ve talked to—a real feeling that nothing will happen as a result of this and that no one will be held accountable and that that’s a real shame.\n\nEbeid: And you know, obviously, like, we’re focusing on this one text conversation that happened to include Jeffrey Goldberg. I mean, would it be reasonable for us to assume that this is not the first and only conversation that’s happening like this in Signal or other group-chat environments?\n\nHarris: I think that’s reasonable, and I presume it’s not the only one. And the reason I do is because in this whole conversation that we’re watching them have, not one person says: Hey—should we be doing this on Signal? Why did you add him to this group? Wait, why are we doing this on a text thread?\n\nEveryone behaves as if this is perfectly normal. And to my knowledge, at least in previous administrations, it is not normal. That suggests, to me, that these people have either done this before or know people have done it before.\n\nEbeid: We have been very, you know, in the last couple of days around this story and even in this conversation, we’re very focused on what this means internally in the United States for us. A couple of weeks ago, you were on the show, talking with our host, Hanna Rosin, about this administration’s about-face from European allies and what kind of effect that has on the intelligence community and sharing of information between the U.S. and countries that we’ve traditionally thought of as allies. What kind of fallout could we see with intelligence sharing with other countries after something like this?\n\nHarris: I think this is likely to confirm for our allies that they were right to be skeptical about this administration’s ability to properly handle sensitive information, and that they will start pulling back accordingly.\n\nI think they already have been. And look—in the two days since this story has broken, I’ve had a chance to talk to officials in some allied countries. They’re appalled. They can’t believe this is happening, and they are very candid in saying, you know, This is essentially why we have to rethink whether we can trust this administration.\n\nAnd you know, what’s also so striking to me in some of these conversations is: As aghast as they are, they’re not actually surprised. It’s not that they can’t believe that anyone would do this. It’s more that they think that if anyone were going to do it, it would be people in this administration.\n\nBecause there’s a track record. There has been since the inauguration, and there’s a track record in Trump’s first term. So you know, people are also—you know, like all of us, they’re kind of laughing. I mean, it’s just—there’s a deep comic thread to this story. (Laughs.) No doubt.\n\nEbeid: So many memes.\n\nHarris: So many memes. The memes have been amazing. It’s been one of the best parts. But they’re also taking it really seriously because now they have an actual example, proof that there is information being bandied about in this way. And, you know, I was talking to someone just recently, you know, who said, So are we to assume that you’re gonna take the intelligence that we give you from our country, and you’re also gonna be sharing it with people over Signal? Because that’s not okay.\n\nEbeid: Right. Okay. So that’s the situation with historic allies. What about America’s adversaries? What kind of conversations do you think are happening right now in North Korea and China?\n\nHarris: I think, you know, again, aside from the comedy of it, look: We have these individuals—particularly, the very senior members of the administration, the DNI, the CIA director, the secretary of defense, and to include their senior aides—already are presumably at the top of the target list for foreign intelligence services to try and get information on them, compromise their electronic devices.\n\nWhat I’m afraid this episode will show to those foreign spy agencies is that work of spying on our officials might be easier than they had thought it would be. And I don’t think we should presume for a minute that all of the phones that were used in this Signal chain are a hundred percent secure.\n\nI’m not saying I know them not to be, but I would not presume that they are. I think that there is kind of a pattern of sloppy behavior by senior members of the administration with how they take briefings, with people they have around them, and whether those people have been appropriately cleared, the kinds of communication systems that they’re using.\n\nI don’t think we should view this Signal group as a one-off. I think that this is illustrative of a pattern of behavior and practice that we have seen since President Trump took office, in January. You know, and we’ve talked before and I’ve written before about, you know, the counterintelligence and security risks that happen or get created when people from the DOGE service start barging into agencies and mucking about in computer systems that they don’t really understand, and the way that they can expose information or make it more vulnerable.\n\nSo I think about that and other threads that I’m kind of pulling on and say: The way to think about the “Houthi PC small group” Signal scandal is as part of a whole pattern of behavior, not as something that happened in isolation.\n\nEbeid: Shane, thanks so much for joining me today.\n\nHarris: Thank you for having me, Claudine.\n\n[Music]\n\nEbeid: This episode of Radio Atlantic was produced by Jinae West and edited by Kevin Townsend.

        "content": "Sign up for Derek’s newsletter here.\n\nIn September 1992, the band Blind Melon released their self-titled debut album. The record was mostly ignored until a music video for the song “No Rain,” featuring a girl in glasses dressed as a bumblebee, went berserk on MTV. The song rocketed up the Billboard Hot 100 charts. But that was the last time the band ever struck gold. Two decades later, Rolling Stone named “No Rain” one of the biggest one-hit wonders of all time.\n\nSoon after Blind Melon topped the charts, another artist had a breakout moment. Shania Twain released her second album, The Woman in Me, which included the No. 1 hit “Any Man of Mine.” Whatever the polar opposite of a one-hit wonder is, that’s what Shania Twain turned out to be. She became one of the most consistent hitmakers of her era, and the only female artist ever with three straight albums certified Diamond, meaning more than 10 million copies sold.\n\nFor decades, psychologists have puzzled over the ingredients of creative popularity by studying music, because the medium offers literally millions of data points. Is the thing that separates one-hit wonders from consistent hitmakers luck, or talent, or some complex combination of factors? I did my best to summarize their work in my book, Hit Makers. This month, the Stanford psychologist Justin Berg published a new paper on the topic and argued that the secret to creative success just happens to hinge on the difference between “No Rain” and Shania Twain.\n\nBerg compiled a data set of more than 3 million songs released from 1959 to 2010 and pulled out the biggest hits. He used an algorithm developed by the company EchoNest to measure the songs’ sonic features, including key, tempo, and danceability. This allowed him to quantify how similar a given hit is to the contemporary popular-music landscape (which he calls “novelty”), and the musical diversity of an artist’s body of work (“variety”).\n\n“Novelty is a double-edged sword,” Berg told me. “Being very different from the mainstream is really, really bad for your likelihood of initially making a hit when you’re not well known. But once you have a hit, novelty suddenly becomes a huge asset that is likely to sustain your success.” Mass audiences are drawn to what’s familiar, but they become loyal to what’s consistently distinct.\n\nBlind Melon’s “No Rain” rated extremely low on novelty in Berg’s research. Dreamy, guitar-driven soft rock wasn’t exactly innovative in 1992. According to Berg, this was the sort of song that was very likely to become a one-hit wonder: It rose to fame because of a quirky music video, not because the song itself stood out for its uniqueness. After that hit, the band struggled to distinguish their sound from everything else that was going on in music.\n\nBy contrast, Twain’s breakout hit rated high on novelty in Berg’s research. She was pioneering a new pop-country crossover genre that was bold for her time but would later inspire a generation of artists, like Taylor Swift. “Twain is a great fit for the model, because her blending of pop and country was so original before she had her breakout,” Berg told me. After her second album, he said, her novelty, which had previously been an artistic risk, helped her retain listeners. She could experiment within the kingdom of country-pop without much competition from other artists, and this allowed her to dominate the charts for the next decade.\n\nBerg’s research also found that musical variety (as opposed to novelty) was useful for artists before they broke out. But down the line, variety wasn’t very useful, possibly because audience expectations are set by initial hits. “After the first hit, the research showed that it was good for artists to focus on what I call relatedness, or similarity of music,” he said. Nobody wants Bruce Springsteen to make a rap album.\n\nThis second finding about the benefits of early variety is similar to a model of creativity known as explore-exploit. The Northwestern University economist Dashun Wang has found that artists and scientists tend to have “hot streaks,” or tight clusters of highly successful work. When he looked closer at what preceded these hot streaks, he found a similar pattern. First, artists and scientists would “explore,” or experiment with a bunch of different ideas, styles, jobs, or topics, before they really got in the zone. Then they would “exploit,” or productively focus on one particular area.\n\nBerg’s and Wang’s research suggests three rules of thumb that may come in handy for creative work.\n\nFirst, extremely new ideas are unlikely to initially find a large audience. But if they break through, artists and entrepreneurs may find that uniqueness is an asset, the same way that Twain’s country-pop hybrid style switched from a burden to a benefit after her first hit. Second, early-career exploration can pay dividends in the long run. This is as true of the broader labor force as it is in music. A 2014 study of young workers found that people who switch jobs more frequently early in their career tend to have higher incomes in their prime working years. Third, the difference between one-hit wonders and hitmakers isn’t just novelty; it’s also focus, or what Berg called “relatedness.” Hot streaks require creative people to mine deeply when they find something that works for them.",

Sign up for it here.\n\n“We’re going to start being smart, and we’re going to start being very wealthy again,” President Donald Trump announced today as he laid out a plan that risks derailing America’s economy. At his “Liberation Day” event, he unveiled a 10 percent–minimum tariff on all imports, with no change for Canada and Mexico but significantly higher rates for other countries, such as China and India, that far exceeded what many economists had expected.\n\nWith today’s announcement, Trump is tariffing essentially all foreign goods. The administration says that the levies will bring in some $6 trillion, which would amount to the biggest tax hike in U.S. history. Some of the most perplexing updates are in countries where the United States has existing free-trade agreements, such as South Korea, my colleague Annie Lowrey, who covers economic policy, told me. The Trump administration claims that South Korea has a 50 percent tariff on the U.S., but it is basing its tariff estimations in part on currency manipulation and trade barriers. It hasn’t yet provided evidence confirming that such factors, insofar as they exist, are equivalent to a 50 percent tariff.\n\nSuch all-encompassing tariffs will cost each American family thousands of dollars, economists predict. Americans will likely feel the effects of this while standing in a grocery-store aisle, purchasing auto insurance, or undertaking home renovations. These levies have the potential to increase inflation and slow down the economy in the longer term, and the uncertainty of what happens next will also contribute to the confidence of shoppers and businesses. “The way that Trump does tariffs is he often makes these really big announcements and then rolls them back,” perpetually modifying the rules, as in a game of Calvinball, Annie explained. “That’s really hard if you’re a business. Should we wait this out? Are they actually going to do it?”\n\nGiven the sweeping nature of the new tariffs, Trump may have just essentially encouraged other countries to consider banding together to impose further tit-for-tat levies on the United States. The best-case scenario, Annie told me, is that after some countries threaten reciprocal tariffs, a negotiation is reached that allows Trump to feel like he has won but also “gives some certainty” to businesses and people; shoppers absorb high costs at first, but then the uncertainty declines. If Republicans realize after this whole ordeal that this level of chaos could affect their chances at reelection and opt for fewer surprises going forward, the economy could bounce back, she argued.\n\nAmerica’s economy is full of mixed signals right now—or at least it was, before Trump’s announcement. “If you knew nothing about it and you came in and looked at the main figures, you would say this is not an economy in a recession or anything close to it,” Annie said. The unemployment rate is fairly low, at 4.1 percent; GDP numbers are strong. But things start looking worrisome when you consider that consumer confidence is the lowest it’s been since early 2021, and that Trump’s new tariff plan won’t quell those fears. The solution for the kind of post-tariff downturn the economy might face is simple: Remove the tariffs. But the Trump administration is not likely to let them go easily, Annie noted: “We could be getting ourselves into a bad situation where we’ve taken options for improving the situation off the table.”\n\nRelated:\n\nHere are four new stories from The Atlantic:\n\nToday’s News\n\nSusan Crawford won a Wisconsin Supreme Court seat, beating an opponent backed by Donald Trump and Elon Musk.

In the 18th century, bachelors paid higher taxes and faced harsher punishments for crimes than their betrothed counterparts. (“A Man without a Wife,” Benjamin Franklin said, “is but half a Man.”) Single women—more likely, naturally, to be seduced by the devil—were disproportionately executed for witchcraft … Forgive me, then, if I sound ungrateful when I say this: Americans are still extremely weird about single people.

Sign up for it here.\n\nTax season is always a busy time at the IRS. This year has been especially eventful. In February, the agency was told to start firing up to 7,000 workers—before judges ordered that such firings needed to be paused. Some 5,000 more workers have signed up for the government’s deferred-resignation offer, and various departments have been slashed or targeted for cuts. About 50 IT workers were put on administrative leave Friday. Overall, The Washington Post reported, the agency will end May with about 18 percent fewer employees than it had at the start of this year. And people familiar with the matter told The New York Times that the Trump administration’s ultimate goal is to cut the agency’s staffing by half.\n\nThe stated purpose of these firings, and of DOGE’s other cuts across federal agencies, is to save money. But the cuts may actually translate to a meaningful dip in taxpayer revenue. The IRS is effectively the government’s accounts-receivable department. Staffing cuts set up the IRS to lose money in two ways, Natasha Sarin, a Yale law professor and former Treasury counselor, told me: A reduced IRS has less capacity to collect and enforce taxation, and taxpayers who think they won’t be audited may be more inclined to start cheating. Sarin expects that the agency’s losses will far outweigh the $140 billion DOGE says it has saved (DOGE’s self-reported data is opaque and has been full of errors). She and her colleagues at the Budget Lab at Yale forecast that the plan to cut half of the agency’s workforce alone would conservatively translate to $395 billion in lost revenue in the next decade, and possibly up to $2 trillion.\n\nOther expectations have been bleak, too—and have considered factors beyond reductions in force. Amid the chaos of this filing season, the agency is on track to see a more than 10 percent drop in tax receipts by the tax-filing deadline this month, according to predictions from Treasury and IRS officials who spoke anonymously with The Washington Post last month; if that happens, it would translate into more than $500 billion in lost revenue this year. Such changes could be because some people are skirting their duties and hoping that an understaffed IRS will lead to less enforcement, but other people’s filing may just happen later this year. Victims of natural disasters, including the 2025 California wildfires, have received deadline extensions—and, in general, corporate tax receipts may decline if businesses are facing challenges. (A spokesperson for the Treasury department denied that a $500 billion tax-revenue drop is plausible, adding that “baseless claims from those who have promoted wasteful spending for years at the IRS should be dismissed out right.” Representatives of DOGE did not immediately respond to a request for comment.)\n\nRecent history provides a case study in what happens when the IRS is diminished: In the 2010s, the IRS’s budget was depleted over several years. The number of agents declined by a third from 2010 to 2017, and the audit rate went down by about 40 percent (and down by about 50 percent for people earning more than $1 million) in that period. The number of agency investigations of people who didn’t file returns went from 2.4 million in 2011 to 362,000 in 2017. The total amount of money lost through weak enforcement during those years amounted to some $95 billion, ProPublica estimated.\n\nOne theme of the late 2010s and early 2020s was general sloppiness in filing, especially from corporations, Michael Kaercher, the deputy director of the NYU Tax Law Center and a former IRS lawyer, told me. That period, Sarin argued, demonstrates the “direct relationship” between reduced capacity for enforcement and loss of revenue—though the cuts then were much smaller and more spread out than DOGE’s current plan. Of course, even if the public starts to get the impression that there won’t be consequences for evasion, many will continue to do their civic duty and make good on their obligations. But if the IRS doesn’t have enough staff to help people with the (often confusing) process of filing, some people may just make mistakes, too, and start accidentally underpaying.\n\nThe exact amount the IRS may lose in the years to come will depend on a few factors, including which functions and staff end up ultimately being cut. Since January, the IRS has lost nearly 40 percent of the staff of the Global High Wealth unit, which focuses on audits of very wealthy individuals. Those audits have an extremely high return on investment, Vanessa Williamson, a senior fellow at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, reminded me—a single audit can lead to millions or tens of millions in revenue. In the 2010s, she noted, the “tax gap”—the amount of taxes that were owed but not paid—rose, which was primarily attributable to high earners underreporting their income. In 2021, the top 1 percent of earners were responsible for more than a third of unpaid taxes, which cost the government nearly $200 billion.\n\nAs some of the agency’s functions are diminishing, it is being tasked with a new role. The IRS, which holds information about every taxpayer, is close to signing an agreement with Immigration and Customs Enforcement in which it would share addresses and names about migrants. Sending sensitive taxpayer information to authorities would cut against a fairly core aspect of the IRS’s culture, Kaercher told me: The agency has always taken data privacy very seriously. For decades, the IRS has told undocumented people that they need to pay taxes, and that it would not share information with immigration authorities. Now that the agency is reneging on that promise, the changes may deter immigrants from paying taxes, leading to further dips in the revenue the agency can collect.\n\nIn recent decades, Williamson noted, even through lean IRS eras, what’s called “tax morale,” or a willingness to pay taxes, has remained high in the United States. “Americans are traditionally good taxpayers by international standards,” she said. But trust in the system is predictive of compliance. As that trust diminishes, compliance may go with it too.\n\nRelated:\n\nHere are four new stories from The Atlantic:\n\nToday’s News\n\nVoters are heading to the polls in the contentious Wisconsin Supreme Court race. Elon Musk has handed out $1 million checks to two people who signed a petition against judicial activism.

The U.S. Health and Human Services Department started issuing notices of dismissal to employees; layoffs are expected to total approximately 10,000 people.\n\nEvening Read\n\nIllustration by Anna Kliewer\n\nThe New Marriage of Unequals\n\nBy Stephanie H. Murray\n\nOnce upon a time, it was fairly common for highly educated men in the United States to marry less-educated women. But beginning in the mid-20th century, as more women started to attend college, marriages seemed to move in a more egalitarian direction, at least in one respect: A greater number of men and women started partnering up with their educational equals. That trend, however, appears to have stalled and even reversed in recent years. Gaps in educational experience among heterosexual couples are growing again. And this time?

        "source": "https://www.theatlantic.com/",
        "content": "All Donald Trump had to do was start telling people the economy was good now. Take over in the middle of an economic expansion and then, without changing the underlying trend line, convince the country that you created prosperity. That’s what he did when he won his first term, and it is what Democrats expected and feared he would do this time.\n\nBut Trump couldn’t do the easy and obvious thing, apparently because he did not view his first term as a success. He considered it a failure, and blamed the failure on the coterie of aides, bureaucrats, and congressional allies who talked him out of his instincts, or ignored them. The second term has been Full Trump, as even his most delusional or abusive whims are translated immediately into policy without regard to democratic norms, the law, the Constitution, public opinion, or the hand-wringing of his party.\n\nThat is why Trump’s second term poses a far more dire threat to the republic than his first did. But it is also why his second term is at risk of catastrophic failure. Nothing illustrates this more clearly than Trump’s insistence on sabotaging the U.S. economy by imposing massive tariffs.\n\nThis afternoon, in an event the administration hyped as “Liberation Day,” Trump unveiled his long-teased plan to impose reciprocal trade restrictions on every country that puts up barriers to American exports. Although at least some economists would defend some kinds of tariff policies—such as those targeted at egregious trade-violating countries, or those designed to protect a handful of strategic industries—Trump has careened into an across-the-board version that will do little but raise prices and invite reprisal against American exports. As an indication of the mad-king dynamic at play, the new plan imposes a 20 percent tariff on the European Union in retaliation against the bloc’s value-added tax system—even though the VAT applies equally to imports and domestic goods and is therefore not a trade barrier at all. U.S. stocks, which have fallen for weeks in anticipation of the tariffs, plunged even more sharply after Trump’s announcement.\n\nRogé Karma: The wild Trump theory making the rounds on Wall Street\n\nTrump would not be the first president to encounter economic turbulence. But he might become the first one to kill off a healthy economy through an almost universally foreseeable unforced error. The best explanation for why Trump is intent on imposing tariffs is that he genuinely believes they are a source of free money supplied by residents of foreign countries, and nobody can tell him otherwise. (Tariffs are taxes on imports, which economists agree are paid mostly by domestic consumers in the form of higher prices.)\n\nHe has compounded the unavoidable damage to business confidence of any large tariff scheme by floating his intention for months while waffling over the details, paralyzing business investment. Even taken on its own terms, a successful version of Trump’s plan would require wrenching dislocations in the global economy. The United States would need to create new industries to replace the imports it is walling off, and this investment would require businesses to believe not only that Trump won’t reverse himself but also that the tariffs he imposes are likely to stay in place after January 20, 2029.\n\nIf businesses don’t believe that Trump will stick with his tariffs, the investment required to spur a domestic industrial revival won’t materialize. But if they do believe him, the markets will crash, because Trump’s tariff scheme will, by the estimation of the economists that investors listen to, produce substantially lower growth.\n\nProbably the likeliest outcome is an in-between muddling through, with slower growth and higher inflation. Even Trump’s gestures toward sweeping tariffs have already made the economy wobble and lifted inflationary expectations. At this point, getting back to the steady growth and cooling inflation Trump inherited will require a great deal of luck.\n\nWhy didn’t anyone around Trump talk him out of this mistake? Because the second Trump administration has dedicated itself to filtering out the kinds of advisers who thwarted some of his most authoritarian first-term instincts, as well as his most economically dangerous ones. The current version of the national Republican Party, by contrast, is dedicated to the proposition recently articulated by one of Elon Musk’s baseball caps: Trump was right about everything.\n\nIn this atmosphere, questioning Trump’s instincts is seen as a form of disloyalty, and Trump has made painfully evident what awaits the disloyal. As The Washington Post reports, “Business leaders have been reluctant to publicly express concerns, say people familiar with discussions between the White House and leading companies, lest they lose their seats at the table or become a target for the president’s attacks.” Asked recently about the prospect of tariffs, House Speaker Mike Johnson revealingly said, “Look, you have to trust the president’s instincts on the economy”—a phrase containing the same kind of double meaning (have to) as Don Corleone’s offer he can’t refuse.\n\nWilliam J. Bernstein: No one wins a trade war\n\nThis dynamic allows Trump to do whatever he wants, no doubt to his delight. But the political consequences for his administration and his party could be ruinous. Public-opinion polling on Trump’s economic management, which has always been the floor that has held him up in the face of widespread public dislike for his character, has tumbled. This has happened without Americans feeling the full effects of his trade war. Once they start experiencing widespread higher prices and slower growth, the bottom could fall out.\n\nA Fox News host recently lectured the audience that it should accept sacrifice for Trump’s tariffs just as the country would sacrifice to win a war. Hard-core Trump fanatics may subscribe to this reasoning, but the crucial bloc of persuadable voters who approved of Trump because they saw him as a business genius are unlikely to follow along. They don’t see a trade war as necessary. Two decades ago, public opinion was roughly balanced between seeing foreign trade as a threat and an opportunity. Today, more than four-fifths of Americans see foreign trade as an opportunity, against a mere 14 percent who see it, like Trump does, as a threat.\n\nAs the political scientists Steven Levitsky and Lucan Way point out, “Authoritarian leaders do the most damage when they enjoy broad public support.” Dictators such as Vladimir Putin and Hugo Chávez have shown that power grabs are easier to pull off when the public is behind your agenda. Trump’s support, however, is already teetering. The more unpopular he becomes, the less his allies and his targets believe he will keep his boot on the opposition’s neck forever, and the less likely they will be to comply with his demands.\n\nThe Republican Party’s descent into an authoritarian personality cult poses a mortal threat to American democracy. But it is also the thing that might save it.",

        "title": "Long COVID Showed Me the Bottom of American Health Care",
        "source": "https://www.theatlantic.com/",
        "content": "My house was dark. Tinfoil covered the windows. The only light I could tolerate came from dimmable red bulbs. Ten weeks before, I had tested positive for COVID. On week three of my infection, I went to the emergency room with a debilitating migraine. On my third trip to the ER, I was hospitalized for seven days. I came home to a changed life. All the clichés about headaches are true—a pile of bricks on the head, a vise grip on the temples, an axe through the skull. The pain altered my consciousness. Trying to move or access a thought was like trying to see past a flashlight shining in my eyes.\n\nIt was 2024—a point at which most people in America considered the pandemic long since over. But it wasn’t for me.\n\nSome days, I couldn’t stop crying. It was more than despair at my circumstance: Long COVID can dysregulate mood and has been linked with depression. And the disease hijacked my stress-response system, leaving my body in a constant state of alarm. Any unexpected sound, even getting a text message, would set off a jolt of panic through my body, the same sensation as slamming on the brakes while driving. I lost my ability to cope. I broke a window in my house. I put a hole in the wall.\n\nResearchers know more about long COVID than they once did, but it is still hard to define. The clearest consensus is that it’s a complex collection of symptoms that can affect almost every organ system in the body. Theories of why COVID can linger abound, and include ongoing inflammation, the virus never fully going away, and tissue damage. Many scientists agree that multiple factors likely contribute. Meanwhile, doctors are still struggling to treat the disease; less than half of doctors know how to diagnose long COVID and even fewer—28 percent—report knowing how to treat it, according to one 2023 survey. Long-COVID patients are still reporting that medical professionals don’t believe them, and though in some cases patients’ self-diagnosis might be off the mark, the reality is that many people living with long COVID simply aren’t getting the care they need.\n\nIn my case, that person who was in mind-numbing pain, unable to read, unable to write, unable to Google things or look at screens, unable to drive, drained by talking on the phone, spiraling in despair, and barely able to leave the house had to navigate the American health-care system. That I needed care for long COVID only made my predicament worse. From hearing chronically ill and disabled people speak about their experiences, I knew that to be sick in this country is a hell unto itself. But knowing something is true and experiencing it are different. I know that the Grand Canyon is deep, but I have never seen it with my own eyes. For our health-care system, I have been to the bottom.\n\nAccording to the latest federal survey as of September 2024, more than one in 20 adults in the United States had long COVID—defined as symptoms that last longer than three months. (The survey does not ask about the severity of symptoms.) Vaccines may help protect against the disease, but getting COVID still means risking long COVID. The coronavirus can leave patients with blood clots, brain dysfunction, organ damage, immune problems, and more; about a quarter of people with the disease report that it significantly disrupts their ability to perform daily activities. There are no FDA-approved medications to treat long COVID. Many medical institutions created specialty clinics to see patients with the disease, but much of what even the best clinics can offer is symptom management. Pinning down recovery rates from long COVID has been difficult, but according to several studies, after two years, the majority of people living with long COVID had not fully recovered.\n\nThree months into my illness, I had been treated for migraines and a concussion—COVID’s impact can mirror a traumatic brain injury—but not long COVID. The tribe that I belong to, Cherokee Nation, runs the largest outpatient facility of any tribe in the U.S., but my primary-care provider there told me she didn’t know how to treat long COVID. I was referred to my tribe’s specialty clinic for rare and infectious diseases. When I managed to get that appointment, however, the provider told me he knew how to treat only pulmonary long-COVID symptoms (which many long-COVID patients don’t have). Nowhere in Indian Health Services, the treaty-based federal program that serves 2.8 million Native Americans nationwide, is there a long-COVID clinic. (An IHS spokesperson said the Biden administration would have needed to set up such a clinic.)\n\nI started looking outside Indian Health Services and found a long-COVID clinic an hour’s drive from my house. When I called, I learned the clinic had shut down. The state where I live, Oklahoma, does not have a long-COVID clinic. My dad found one in Arkansas. Like many long-COVID clinics, it required that patients apply to get in. But after I submitted all the paperwork, I didn’t hear back.\n\nI realized that to access care, I would need to travel. At the time, I was unable to drive, and my symptoms limited how much time I spent outside my house. When I called the Cleveland Clinic, I was transferred four times until I was accidentally forwarded to the customer-satisfaction survey. I spoke with one receptionist who told me her clinic didn’t take patients from out of state, and another who warned that traveling to her clinic probably wouldn’t be worth the time and money. (A spokesperson for the Cleveland Clinic wrote that patients should be able to make an appointment without a referral, and that the clinic and its staff “strive to provide patients with timely access to scheduling and care.”)\n\nIn my first telehealth appointment with a nationally recognized COVID clinic, the doctor wouldn’t discuss her recommendations but said I could read them in the patient visit notes. When I explained that my symptoms made reading impossible, she asked me if someone could read the notes for me. Later, my mom read me a copied-and-pasted list of healthy-lifestyle information, such as the benefits of taking a daily probiotic and the importance of getting enough sleep. The list included the doctor’s favorite bedtime teas. I told my mom to stop reading.\n\nA few months into the pandemic, some patients reported that their symptoms weren’t going away. Through their advocacy, long COVID got its name. By 2022, hundreds of long-COVID clinics had opened across the country. There is no standard for what kind of care these clinics provide: Some are multidisciplinary teams, but many are one specialist or one nurse practitioner. This patchwork system of care has only deteriorated as attention on the disease has dwindled.\n\nMany of the long-COVID clinics that popped up during the pandemic have closed. As part of my reporting for this story, I compiled a list of 171 clinics, drawing from the Survivor Corps website, a patient-led resource-and-advocacy group, and from searching online for long-COVID clinics by state. I then called each clinic to verify which ones were still operating. Of those, 79 were still open and accepting new patients, five were not accepting new patients or outside referrals, 61 had closed, and 15 were unreachable after two attempts. Eleven more were advertised as long-COVID clinics but don’t have a medical doctor or nurse on staff; they provide services such as speech or occupational therapy. (My assistant Sydney Anderson and intern Cheyenne McNeil, who have been helping me work through my illness, contributed to this reporting.)\n\nBased on the list we assembled, 22 states have no long-COVID clinics accepting new patients. Given COVID rates in those states, we estimated that almost 3 million people who currently have long COVID reside there. Because of insurance policies, licensing and telehealth laws, and the cost of travel, not having a nearby clinic can easily mean that patients won’t access care. Of the long-COVID clinics that are still open, some have wait lists, do not accept outside referrals, do not take insurance, treat only specific long-COVID symptoms, or do not take patients from outside of their geographical area.\n\nGetting in touch with the long-COVID clinics that are still open is another barrier. I spoke with operators who had never heard of their institution’s long-COVID clinic; I got transferred to the office that schedules COVID tests; I got transferred to disconnected lines; I called numbers that rang and rang and rang and rang. One day, I spent two hours on the phone and spoke with only three people who could provide information. When I called Yale New Haven Health System’s clinic, one of the most well-known in the country, I got transferred to a disconnected line. I called back and got transferred to the customer-satisfaction survey. I called a third time and left a message. I called a fourth time, trying a different number, and spoke with a receptionist who said the clinic was closed. (The clinic is still open; in a statement, Yale New Haven Health said that the phone number for the long-COVID clinic is on its website, that the volume of calls the clinic receives is very high, and that it had not previously heard of patients having difficulty accessing the clinic.)\n\nIf you are healthy, this might all sound like the familiar nightmare of customer service to which we have all become accustomed. But for people who are sick, it is a wall that stands between them and the care they need. When you are sick, you look at that wall and think, I am not well enough to climb it.\n\nThe closure of long-COVID clinics in recent years has affected patients who need care. I talked with people who, like me, have been living with long COVID later in the pandemic. Ryan Parker lives in Portland, Oregon; is a member of the Northern Cheyenne tribe; and used to work in philanthropy. Like many people with long COVID, Parker tried to work through his illness. He told me he returned from one work trip so sick that he couldn’t get out of bed for a month. Last fall, the long-COVID clinic that was treating him closed. Because of the disease, Maeve Sherry has been disabled and unable to work for three years. They found a long-COVID clinic in Great Falls, Montana, three hours from where they lived at the time, but it closed in December of 2023, they said. There are now no long-COVID clinics in Montana. When Myisha Hill was still struggling to do household chores, take care of her kids, and even talk weeks after a COVID infection, she looked up the long-COVID clinic near where she lives in Las Vegas, she told me. But it, too, had closed. There are now no long-COVID clinics in Nevada.\n\nA spokesperson for the University Medical Center of Southern Nevada wrote that the clinic closed “amid low demand.” Other clinics echoed this response, saying they suspended operations after patient numbers dwindled. A few clinics also stated that they now refer long-COVID patients to primary care. Several spokespeople told me as a reporter that their clinics were still open, but when I called as a patient, I was told the clinic was closed. And even when clinics are open, patients still face barriers: I spoke with people with long COVID who told me they couldn’t access care because a clinic didn’t take their insurance, their doctor didn’t send a referral, or the clinic rejected them as a patient.\n\nThe alternative to enrolling in a clinic is to try to see a regular neurologist or cardiologist. But many specialists have lengthy wait times, and long-COVID patients are twice as likely as the general public to report that this is why they can’t get care. Parker, for instance, is trying to see a specialist for myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome, a form of debilitating fatigue that is common with long COVID. The first available appointment is nine months out.\n\nAnd when patients are finally seen, the care itself might not be competent. Parker’s primary-care provider suggested that his debilitating fatigue was a product of anxiety. Several doctors have also told Kelly Rider that her problem was just anxiety—and one said it was perimenopause. Sometimes doctors prescribe things that exacerbate symptoms—such as exercise for chronic fatigue. When Diem-Han Dinh’s doctor ordered a stress test, she explained that she was unable to run. He didn’t believe her. At the stress test, she almost fainted.\n\nEight months into my illness, I boarded a plane and traveled with my mother to Rochester, Minnesota. The long-COVID clinic I finally got into was Mayo. The off-label medication they prescribed didn’t do much, but I learned about my illness and how to manage my symptoms, which has improved my quality of life. Other things have helped too. Thanks to an arsenal of migraine treatments, my headache—although not gone—is less severe. Thanks to eight months of vision therapy, I can now focus my eyes and am practicing reading. And, in writing this article, I have gotten back to reporting. What I had to go through to get here, I would not wish on anyone.\n\nThe resources our system of medical care can offer to those wanting to learn about, cope with, and heal from what COVID has done to their body are beyond inadequate, and are likely to get worse. In February, the Trump administration ordered the Department of Health and Human Services to dissolve its advisory committee on long COVID. In March, the department announced it would close its Office for Long COVID Research and Practice, and began canceling grants from the National Institutes of Health for COVID studies.\n\nSick and disabled people have been pushed to the margins of our society for a long time. There was a moment during the pandemic when I saw our collective concern focused on the ill. Living with long COVID, I sometimes wonder where that concern went. I feel like the wounded antelope picked off from the herd. Everyone else has moved on, while I am stuck in my illness. I could be angry at each individual hypocrisy—each person who preached the importance of masks only to go back to normal without me—but I am not. Instead, I am sad that what is more powerful than our concern for the sick is the indifference of our health-care system.",

        "title": "The Question Progressives Refuse to Answer",
        "source": "https://www.theatlantic.com/",
        "content": "In President Donald Trump’s second administration, the key political battles so far have turned on the question of who should decide big, important things: which immigrants are deported, which funds are distributed, which bureaucrats are fired, which vaccines are approved. The new administration’s answer to nearly all of these questions is that Trump should decide. This has left many Democrats incensed. Trump is not a monarch, they charge. Our constitutional system precludes him from making these changes unilaterally. Executive authority needs to be curtailed.\n\nBut just last year, when the Supreme Court overturned a Reagan-era decision requiring federal judges to defer to bureaucratic expertise, progressives were singing a different tune. They were aghast at the prospect of legislators and judges impinging on executive-branch decisions. They wanted to protect Biden-administration prerogatives. Democrats may not want Trump’s lackeys wielding authority, but set the personnel aside and they’re still fundamentally at odds with themselves about which institutions should make important calls.\n\nFor Trump’s detractors, this is an enormous, if underappreciated, problem. Democrats are, at root, the party of government—they believe that public authority is key to improving people’s lives. Yet government, according to most Americans, simply doesn’t work today. Every big public decision seems to get mired in endless wrangling and legal complications. We’re not building infrastructure, or harnessing clean energy, or keeping up with housing demand. Given that reality, Trump’s reelection is not hard to understand. In the face of a failing system, voters were eager to empower someone to shake things up—and that’s exactly what Trump promised to do.\n\nRead: How progressives broke the government\n\nTo beat the Trumpian zeitgeist, Democrats will need a plan for making government work. But to make that notion plausible, they will need to wrestle with the core contradiction that bedevils their governing ideology. Progressivism today wants at once to allow government to make big decisions efficiently and to ensure that no one gets snowed in the process. To that end, they decided decades ago to throw their lot in with a notion that procedure can replace discretion. Today, we are all living with the consequences of that mistake.\n\nFrom progressivism’s founding in the late 19th century into the 1960s, the movement offered a simple answer to the question of who should decide. Scientifically driven expertise was, to the progressive mind, the key to good public policy. That meant authorizing expert public officials—the establishment—to stand up holistic solutions to big challenges. Let the engineers design good sewer systems. Let the social workers design proper social-safety nets. Let the medical professionals design the health-care system.\n\nNew Deal Democrats extolled the “wise men” and “city fathers” wielding broad tranches of public authority. The establishment produced New York’s Port Authority, the Tennessee Valley Authority, the Social Security Administration, the Marshall Plan, and the Federal Highway Administration. On issues of great public import, progressives agreed that big bureaucracy might not be beautiful, but it got the job done.\n\nBy Jimmy Carter’s presidency, however, progressives had lost that faith. Urban renewal robbed Americans of their confidence in municipal government. Vietnam had taken away the progressive reverence for the military. The civil-rights movement had exposed the bigotry within the governing class. And Watergate had revealed just how sick and self-serving the power elite really were.\n\nBut progressivism’s sudden turn against the establishment left reformers in a quandary. If they couldn’t trust the experts to exercise authority, who would make important decisions in their stead? Who would decide where to build the new bridge crossing the river, or which neighborhoods were going to be compelled to accommodate new housing projects? The answer seemed obvious—the people would decide.\n\nBut amid the rush to decapitate the establishment—to end the war, to snuff out racial discrimination, to speak truth to power, to “put your bodies upon the gears and upon the wheels”—the question of just how the people would decide was left hanging. The problem, to the progressive mind, was that fallible bureaucrats and elected officials had been imbued with too much discretion. To counter unconstrained discretion, progressives would seek to impose process.\n\nHaving witnessed the abuse of authority, reformers resolved to provide the victims of the system with the means of protecting themselves. The people would be given seats at the table, voices in the deliberation, and opportunities to appeal when bureaucrats tried to bowl them over. They would lean on the courts’ authority to stop the executive branch in its tracks. Discretion, after all, was primarily the province of the executive and legislative branches. Progressivism’s new project was to move power from those two branches and into the third—which, if nothing else, had the power to say no.\n\nIf progressives a generation earlier would have been shocked to witness the movement’s turn against the establishment, they would have been gobsmacked to see reformers lionize the courts. For most of the movement’s early history, judges had been cast as the villains. They’d shielded trusts and monopolists from prosecution. They’d eviscerated minimum wage and maximum-hour statutes. They’d upended various elements of the early New Deal. Franklin Roosevelt had complained that judges wanted to take the country back to the “horse and buggy days.” Now progressives changed their tune: It was the executive and legislative branches that were suspect and veto-wielding judges who were knights in shining armor.\n\nDrastic as this turn may have been, it was catalyzed by a novel political reality. The judiciary, which had so frustrated Roosevelt, had taken on a very different character by the time Richard Nixon haunted the West Wing. The conservative justices who had upended elements of the New Deal had been replaced by the likes of Thurgood Marshall and William Brennan. The progressive Judges Skelly Wright and David Bazelon, meanwhile, served on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals. But if the old conservatives had championed laissez-faire, and the new crowd embraced what critics would call “judicial activism,” the two sets shared something profound: a deep skepticism of the elected branches. And by the late 1960s, progressives everywhere shared that same mindset.\n\nDuring the three decades when first Earl Warren and then Warren Burger served as chief justice, the Supreme Court operated as a bulwark against the abuses of elected officials and bureaucrats alike. The Court told local governments that they had to desegregate their schools, that police officers could no longer coerce unsuspecting citizens into self-incrimination, that politicians could no longer prevent journalists from publishing unflattering articles, and that policy makers could no longer prevent women from making their own health-care decisions.\n\nBut the impulse to curb the establishment’s power also extended into other realms. By the 1970s, ordinary people were tired of highway engineers imperiously disrupting neighborhoods in their zeal to construct expressways. They were tired of developers razing whole neighborhoods in the name of utopian schemes for glittering high-rises. They were tired of utility executives colluding with public officials to license smog-inducing power plants.\n\nThe great social triumphs of the Warren and Burger Courts are seldom considered in tandem with contemporaneous decisions issued to protect the environment, preserve historically significant buildings, and preclude a president from going to war without proper authorization. But they all were grounded in the same underlying effort. The centralized power brokers whose discretionary power emanated from the elected branches had turned bad; progressivism would return that authority to the people using processes governed by the courts.\n\nIf the courts grew more likely to veto the decisions taken by officials, though, they seldom stepped in to make the decisions themselves. That left progressives to answer a pressing question: If government officials couldn’t be trusted, then who should decide?\n\nIn some cases, the answers seemed simple to them. When it came to abortion, for example, the pregnant woman should make the call. When a Black family was looking for a place to spend the night, they themselves should be able to choose among all the various public accommodations. But what about when the highway department proposed an expressway for suburban commuters and those living along its route worried about noise and pollution? Who would decide when the people weren’t united against the powerful but instead were arguing among themselves—when the issue wasn’t a Manichean struggle between right and wrong but a messy question of trade-offs?\n\nProgressives sidestepped this question by immersing themselves in proceduralism. Reformers imagined that if everyone was able to have their concerns taken seriously, some correct answer would eventually emerge. Each affected party needed to be able to exercise some real power, and to be able to appeal for the protection of the court. If a process came to the wrong conclusion, those poised to suffer could demand that a judge throw the emergency brake.\n\nThose opposing a project no longer had to debate proposals on the merits; the question was no longer about the wisdom of any official’s exercise of discretion but about whether the process had been properly followed. Had the affected communities been consulted with enough notice? Had they been given sufficient time to respond? Had all the impacts—on wildlife, on noise, on sunlight, on historic buildings—been taken into account? Opponents no longer had to argue that their concerns substantively outweighed the merits of any proposed project. Procedure was now king. And on process-oriented questions, the judiciary veto reigned supreme.\n\nBut even the best process cannot obviate the need for trade-offs. Nobody wants a sewage-treatment plant sited near their neighborhood, but cities sometimes need to filter water. No community wants to be sliced by a new transmission line, but the nation’s electrical grid needs to be enhanced. Sometimes, inconveniences can be offset by new amenities—a neighborhood forced to host a new homeless shelter might be bequeathed a new recreation center. But no new ice rink is going to compensate for the disruption wrought by the construction of a new high-speed rail line. In many cases, there’s no way around a simple reality: Someone’s ox is going to be gored.\n\nThe old establishment power brokers have never been formally stripped of their discretion. Transportation officials are still in charge of where the next expressway will be constructed. Utility executives are still charged with deciding where the next transmission line will go. Mayors, governors, and development officials still get to make the call on various proposals to build more housing. But in reality, the processes created to regularize and democratize these decisions—the boards that need to weigh in, the considerations that need to be studied, the hurdles that need to be cleared—have effectively eviscerated their actual discretion. Failures to heed some element of the process invite lawsuits. And once any disagreement lands in litigation, the real decision-making power is vested in a judge.\n\nThat, of course, was precisely the reformers’ intention. For decades, progressives viewed the shift from discretion to procedure as a change that effectively took power out of Richard Nixon’s hands and placed it in Thurgood Marshall’s. But as the courts have turned more conservative—Samuel Alito is no Bill Brennan—that faith has wavered. More important, progressivism has begun to rethink the underlying wisdom of that shift.\n\nAt the dawn of the progressive movement, reformers had wanted government to do big things. Institutions were created on the express promise that the experts would run them. Only during the 1960s and ’70s, as abuses of power were exposed, did the movement begin to venerate the judiciary. That worked well enough so long as the communities the movement cared to serve were better off without big changes—housing starts, grid enhancements, public infrastructure. But decades on, amid housing shortages, dilapidated infrastructure, and the threat of climate change, many reformers have been forced to reconsider.\n\nIn the early 20th century, progressives were frustrated that a judicial approach born from conservatism—what W. E. B. Du Bois would label “the counter-revolution of property”—prevented government from pursuing policies to help the poor and working classes. Today, by contrast, progressives may be similarly enraged by a conservative Supreme Court—but their frustration is born from a jurisprudence of their own making. The shift toward proceduralism had been an explicitly progressive endeavor. Progressives wanted to throw sand into the gears of the machine. Now, as they dream of doing big things again, they are left to shake their fists at their own legacy.\n\nThink of the young activist groups protesting against solar farms, or liberals bucking reform efforts to build multifamily housing in the suburbs. It was the left, too, that undermined a late-Biden-era effort to speed permitting for clean-energy projects for fear that some fossil-burning facilities might also get a boost.\n\nRead: The political fight of the century\n\nTo be fair, these examples reflect real conflicts. Some will be incensed that anyone would stand in the way of a wind or solar farm, others outraged at the way those farms may affect the existing wildlife. Some will be irritated that longtime residents might stand in the way of new housing construction, others indignant at the prospect of gentrification. The problem here isn’t that the movement isn’t of one mind on the merits of any given idea. Rather, it’s that reformers have no real concept of a process that would fairly arbitrate between trade-offs. Any adverse outcome—and when trade-offs are required, there is definitionally an adverse outcome for someone—is a signal that the underlying decision-making process is corrupt.\n\nWho, then, speaks for the people? Congress might be the most obvious answer, legislators being directly tethered to the interests of their constituents. Ironically, however, progressives tend to find representatives and senators among the least appealing options. Members of Congress are prone to capture by powerful interests and deep-pocketed donors. Even if they resist those temptations, they tend to prioritize the concerns of their district or state to the detriment of society as a whole. If nothing else, earmarks short-circuit the deliberative process that might identify the best way forward. Decades after money was scandalously tucked away for Alaska’s “bridge to nowhere,” the project remains a cautionary tale about the abuse of legislative power.\n\nBut of course, progressives remain wary of executive authority as well. A 2008 episode of This American Life reported that Black communities across America still live under the specter of what’s known in conversation as “the Plan” to gentrify poorer neighborhoods, a folk belief born in the era of urban renewal that has proved remarkably persistent. A movement that continues to lionize speaking truth to power remains wary of bureaucracy, convinced that agencies, like legislators, are easily captured by private interests. To protect against that kind of abuse, it continues to rely on the courts.\n\nBut the courts, as arbiters of various rules, aren’t really equipped to push forward the kinds of progress that progressives mean to champion. They can certainly halt change, as progressives were so eager for them to do when the establishment was running amok. But even now, judges cannot make the discretionary calls about where the bridge should be built, or the sewage plant sited, or the transmission corridor erected.\n\nSkeptical that anyone wielding power can be trusted to make a truly wise or disinterested decision, progressives end up judging every process by the outcome. And when the battle is less between right and wrong than between one set of trade-offs and another, cynicism quickly gives way to despondency. Rather than face the hard reality that housing projects, transportation networks, and clean-energy facilities are inevitably going to come with costs, reformers view the simple existence of those downsides as evidence that the public is getting a raw deal. Thus progressives almost inevitably make the case that government is fundamentally broken. And they’re right—government is broken, in large part because they broke it.\n\nIt’s not that Democrats are at a loss for ideas today. It’s not that they are unable to identify enemies—greedy bankers, polluting corporations, Elon Musk. Rather, the party has lost the will to govern. It cannot figure out how to set priorities, identify choices, ratify trade-offs, and then accept the costs of important decisions. For decades, progressivism has deluded itself into believing that process can obviate the need for discretion. Reformers became so obsessed with ensuring that government would not trample the powerless that they have prevented government from doing its job.\n\nFew voters, of course, would have articulated their frustrations with progressivism that way while casting ballots for Donald Trump. But Democrats’ determination not to let government govern—the progressive movement’s cultural aversion to power—was baked into the campaign. The Biden administration invested billions in infrastructure, high-speed rail, and clean energy, but not in ways that voters could see, touch, or appreciate. Two years after the government appropriated $5 billion for EV chargers, only a few dozen had been built. The country is in a housing crisis, but the government didn’t clear the way for new home construction. Voters overwhelmingly reported that America was on the wrong track, and yet Democratic leaders weren’t righting the train.\n\nA growing movement of so-called supply-side progressives is now trying to address this problem. Those joining in what the Atlantic’s Derek Thompson has framed as a quest for “abundance” are searching for ways to form what the New York Times columnist Ezra Klein has termed a “progressivism that builds.” But even within the growing community of scholars and activists convinced that government’s inability to drive progress is a substantive and political problem, answers to the core question of who should decide remain elusive. Everyone seems to want more stuff and less rigmarole. But in the same way that previous waves of reform focused on chopping away things proponents didn’t like, today’s reformers risk sidestepping the crucial question of who should ratify any given trade-off.\n\nIn the realm of housing, the abundance crowd has begun to sketch an appealing answer: Let the free market choose. The problem, they suggest, is fairly simple. People in the suburbs don’t want multifamily buildings constructed nearby, lest the riffraff move in next door. People in grittier neighborhoods fear that new construction will bring higher rents. On both ends, would-be neighbors conspire to preclude any influx of newcomers by constraining what property owners can do.\n\nAs The Atlantic’s Yoni Appelbaum argues in his new book, Stuck: How the Privileged and Propertied Broke the Engine of American Opportunity, we should lift those restrictions, letting the people who purchase land build what they want, whether it’s a duplex on a single-family plot, a granny flat above their garage, or a multifamily building near a bus stop. The tension between those who own a plot of land and those who live nearby should be resolved in favor of the figure who controls the property. The supply-side solution, in the realm of housing at least, is to push decision-making power down.\n\nFrom the March 2025 issue: How progressives froze the American Dream\n\nBut there is, of course, another potential approach. Rather than limit the opportunities for neighbors to gum up the works, progressivism could reach back into its ideological roots and empower someone with the discretion to clear the way. Instead of deconstructing the barriers that preclude more housing, reformers could affirmatively assign someone to cut through the cacophony of objections and devise a solution that serves the public interest.\n\nTo address housing shortages, for example, an official could weigh the pros and cons of any given proposal—considering both the promise of the project and the objections of those nearby—and use their better judgment to decide whether the idea should move forward. The person who owned the plot would not have an absolute right to build, and those worried about neighborhood impacts would not have the power to thwart any change. Authority, in other words, could be pushed up.\n\nReturning the exercise of discretion to public officials cuts against progressivism’s half-century-long campaign to curtail the establishment. Better, many will argue, to establish a process of some sort to regularize consideration. But even if we can make progress in addressing the housing shortage by pushing power down, that can’t be the way forward on transportation or clean energy, because the landowners themselves object to the needed developments. And that’s exactly the point. None of the hard decisions America faces—weighing preservation against new housing, or clean energy against environmental protection, or neighborhood stability against high-speed rail—can be resolved without significant trade-offs. The notion that nothing works can be cured only by a process that makes decisions expeditiously.\n\nThat’s not to suggest that all of the guardrails should be removed. Reformers can require decision makers to mitigate harm—to do the least possible damage to the forest, or preserve as many homes in the train’s right-of-way, or demand that the new multifamily buildings erected in a vibrant community hew to a familiar aesthetic. But, in the end, someone needs to be put in charge.\n\nThat will be a frightening prospect for many reformers. But if progressives mean to dull the sting of MAGAism—that is, if they intend to make progressivism popular again—there is no alternative. Trump’s return to power wasn’t inevitable—and it certainly wasn’t born of any single ideological failing on the left. But progressivism’s decades-long effort to replace discretion with process has proved a disaster.\n\nThe movement wasn’t wrong during the 1970s in wanting to correct for abuses wrought by the establishment, but the tonic has by now proved to be more toxic than the disease. For progressivism to reestablish itself, it will need to make government work. And for government to work—for people to believe that democracy really serves their interests—the individuals who nominally wield public authority need to be given the discretion, at long last, to use it for the greater good.",

        "source": "https://www.theatlantic.com/",
        "content": "American farmers are pleading for exemptions from President Donald Trump’s tariffs. Republican members of Congress from farm states are working to deliver the relief farmers want. But farmers do not deserve special treatment and should not get it.\n\nTariffs will indeed hurt farmers badly. Farm costs will rise. Farm incomes will drop. Under Trump’s tariffs, farmers will pay more for fertilizer. They will pay more for farm equipment. They will pay more for the fuel to ship their products to market. When foreign countries retaliate, raising their own tariff barriers, American farmers will lose export markets. Their domestic sales will come under pressure too, because tariffs will shrink Americans’ disposable incomes: Consumers will have to cut back everywhere, including at the grocery store.\n\nFarmers will share this tariff predicament of higher costs and lower incomes with almost all Americans—except the very wealthiest, who are less exposed to tariffs because they consume less of their incomes and can offset the pain of tariffs with other benefits from Trump, beginning with a dramatic reduction in tax enforcement.\n\nFarmers are different from other Americans, however, in three ways.\n\nFirst, farmers voted for Trump by huge margins. In America’s 444 most farm-dependent counties, Trump won an average of 77.7 percent of the vote—nearly two points more than Trump scored in those same counties in 2020.\n\nSecond, farmers have already pocketed windfall profits from Trump’s previous round of tariffs.\n\nWhen Trump started a trade war with China in 2018, China switched its soybean purchasing from the United States to Brazil. By 2023, Brazil was exporting twice as much as the United States. Trump compensated farmers with lavish cash payouts. The leading study of these effects suggests that soybean farmers may have received twice as much from the Trump farm bailout as they lost from the 2018 round of tariffs, because the Trump administration failed to consider that U.S. soybeans not exported to China were eventually sold elsewhere, albeit at lower prices. The richest farmers collected the greatest share of the windfall. The largest 10 percent of farms received an average of $85 an acre in payouts, according to a 2019 study by the economists Eric Belasco and Vincent Smith for the American Enterprise Institute. The median-size farm received only $56 an acre. Altogether, farmers have been amply compensated in advance for the harm about to be done to them by the man most farming communities voted for.\n\nThird, farmers can better afford to pay the price of Trump’s tariffs than many other tariff victims.\n\nFarmers can already obtain federal insurance against depressed prices for their products. Most farmers report low incomes from farming, but they have a high net worth. The median American farm shows net assets of about $1.5 million. Commercial-farm households show median net assets of $3.6 million. The appearance of low incomes is in any case misleading. Again, according to Smith, families that own farms earn only 20 percent of their income from farming. Even the richest farmers, those with farm assets above $6 million, still earn about half their income from other sources, including a spouse’s employment in a local business or through a rural government job such as a county extension agent. On average, farm families earn higher total incomes than nonfarm families, and their debt-to-equity ratio is typically low.\n\nJerusalem Demsas: Trump is unleashing a chaos economy\n\nNone of this is to deny that farmers will suffer from the tariffs. They will. A lot. But so will city people. As will people in industries that use steel or aluminum or copper as components. As will people in service industries and export industries, people who rely on the trade treaties trashed by Trump to protect their copyrights and patents. And anybody with money invested in stocks. And anybody who drives a car or truck.\n\nDuring the 2024 election campaign, Americans were told, in effect, that no sacrifice was too great to revive the domestic U.S. toaster-manufacturing industry. If that claim is true, then farmers should be proud to pay more and receive less, making the same sacrifice as any other American.\n\nBut if a farm family voted for Trump, believing that his policies were good, it seems strange that they would then demand that they, and only they, should be spared the full consequences of those policies. Tariffs are the dish that rural America ordered for everyone. Now the dish has arrived at the table. For some reason, they do not want to partake themselves or pay their share of the bill.\n\nThat’s not how it should work. What you serve to others you should eat yourself. And if rural America cannot choke down its portion, why must other Americans stomach theirs?",

        "title": "Cory Booker, Endurance Athlete",
        "source": "https://www.theatlantic.com/",
        "content": "The idea of politics as a sport is a familiar analogy. For a little more than 25 hours from Monday to Tuesday evening, politics left behind the metaphor and became a grueling, perhaps even dangerous, ultramarathon. Senator Cory Booker’s record-breaking speech—an “oratorical marathon” and a “feat of political endurance,” according to reporters—was nearly an hour longer than Strom Thurmond’s 1957 attempt to filibuster the Civil Rights Act. The impact of Booker’s effort remains to be seen, but to judge it through a strictly political lens is to miss a grittier athletic drama—and overlook how sports science might help a future senator extend “filibusterthon” endurance even further.\n\nBefore he took to the lectern, clad in a dark suit and black sneakers, Booker announced his intention of pushing the limits of his 56-year-old body. “I’m going to go for as long as I’m physically able to go,” he said.\n\nThis is precisely the kind of challenge that animates amateur endurance athletes like me, as well as the professionals I write about as a journalist who specializes in the science of endurance. The open-ended nature of such boundary-pushing is particularly alluring. The current world record for “backyard ultras,” which involve running about four miles every hour until everyone else gives up, is 110 laps—that’s 458 miles over four and a half days. Research on these competitors has found that the physical demands of such a prolonged effort pale in comparison to the psychological toll.\n\nStill, Booker’s speech presented some unique physiological challenges—most notably that he couldn’t yield the floor to go to the bathroom. That’s no trivial feat: In 2007, a woman died shortly after participating in an on-air “Hold Your Wee for a Wii” contest held by a radio station. Her problem was drinking too much. To forestall the call of nature, Booker stopped eating on Friday, and refrained from drinking on Sunday evening, a full 24 hours before he started speaking.\n\nScientists assess that, on average, humans can survive without water for about three days. Long before that, your kidneys will be stressed, your cognitive function will be impaired, and you may develop a headache as your brain—which is mostly water—shrinks. Just as well that Booker didn’t have to debate anyone.\n\nThen there’s the effect on your muscles. “I’m a former athlete, so I know when you get dehydrated you get a lot cramps,” Booker, who played football for Stanford in the early 1990s, told reporters after his speech. “That was the biggest thing I was fighting, is that different muscles were really starting to cramp up, and every once in a while I’d have a spasm.” As a matter of scientific fact, the link between dehydration and muscle cramps is no longer as widely accepted as it was when Booker was in college. Instead of sipping water occasionally during his speech, he might have had better luck warding off cramps with pickle juice, which is thought to reset the nervous-system reflexes that go haywire when you cramp.\n\nFasting for more than four days also made Booker’s task considerably harder. Among Tour de France cyclists and other endurance athletes, the trend is to scarf down astonishingly large quantities of carbohydrates, as much as 120 grams—the equivalent of three plates of pasta—every hour while competing. Booker’s jaw muscles clearly didn’t need that much fuel, but letting blood-sugar levels drop is associated with mental fog, lightheadedness, and the risk of fainting. Strangely enough, you can counteract some of these symptoms simply by swishing sports drink in your mouth and then spitting the drink out. Just a whiff of glucose will trigger calorie sensors in your brain and make you feel better. It’s the perfect solution for future filibusterers, because it won’t make you need to pee.\n\nMissing a night’s sleep is one element of Booker’s feat that most of us have replicated at some point in our life. That’s nothing compared with what those backyard-ultra competitors endure, but it has an effect: Researchers have famously found that staying awake for 24 hours makes you a worse driver than drinking alcohol to the legal limit. The standard advice among ultrarunners, backed by scientific findings, is that getting extra sleep in the week prior to your ordeal can help buffer some of the effects of sleep deprivation.\n\nEven if the distance Booker covered during his event was zero miles, he still faced the considerable physical challenge of standing for more than 24 hours. Just a few hours into his speech, he had a Senate page remove his chair—to eliminate the temptation to sit down.\n\nAlthough the evils of sitting all day are well known, standing all day is no picnic either. Research has found that people whose jobs require standing all day are twice as likely to develop heart disease as those who sit, and are vulnerable to a host of other ills, ranging from varicose veins to “spontaneous abortions.” And yes, muscle cramps: the most likely culprit for Booker’s spasms was muscle fatigue rather than dehydration. There’s no easy fix, but marching in place might help engage different muscles to spread the strain, along with a pair of highly cushioned supershoes.\n\nThe shoes of Senator Cory Booker, photographed while he spoke to reporters on Tuesday after surpassing the record for the longest Senate speech (Eric Lee / The New York Times / Redux)\n\nEven if another senator optimized all of these details, could they break Booker’s new record? For an answer on that, I am persuaded by the great Finnish runner Paavo Nurmi. “Mind is everything: muscles—pieces of rubber,” he said. “All that I am, I am because of my mind.”\n\nWhen he emerged from the Senate Chamber after his oratorical marathon, Booker pulled a slip of paper from his pocket. It was a passage from the Book of Isaiah: “But they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength; they shall mount up with wings as eagles; they shall run, and not be weary; and they shall walk, and not faint.” Anyone who wants to beat Booker will need to draw from a similar wellspring of belief and commitment. But they should probably also bring some pickle juice.",

Previously, Sean was Vox’s weekend editor.\n\nPresident Donald Trump waits outside of the West Wing before welcoming King Abdullah II of Jordan to the White House in Washington, DC, on February 11, 2025. Jim Watson/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe spate of federal firings that stretched throughout last week escalated last Friday, and continued through the holiday weekend.\n\nNearly all of those fired were “probationary” employees, a status usually conferred on new workers, those that switch agencies, and the recently promoted, that provides fewer protections against removal.\n\nReports have been unclear about exactly how many people were fired and where. However, we do know some details:\n\nThe Trump administration has argued these cuts (and more) are needed to slash federal spending, and to shrink a bloated bureaucracy.\n\nHowever, the latest reduction in force is unlikely to provide taxpayers with major savings, and could jeopardize the government’s mandate to protect its citizens.\n\nTake, for instance, the VA’s claim that its terminations will save $98 million per year. That is a lot of money to me, but it represents only 0.00145 percent of the $6.75 trillion the federal government spent in the 2024 fiscal year. Celebrating that cut is like me jumping for joy because I managed to save a tenth of a penny by foregoing something at the grocery store. Sure it’s money saved, but not really an appreciable sum.\n\nThe point is — and it’s a point others have made — the US will need to make massive cuts, on the trillion, not million, dollar scale if it really wants to appreciably tighten its belt. To do that, it would need to slash spending on expensive programs like Medicare, Medicaid, and the defense.\n\nNow to the other claim: that the government is too big.\n\nMuch like with the VA’s savings, those let go represent a fraction of the federal workforce. If you combine the latest round of layoffs with previous rounds — and even with the roughly 75,000 people who took the government’s buyout offer — then just under 4 percent of the government’s 2.4 million person workforce has been cut.\n\nThat means the government is still pretty big. The good news about that is it means government services are unlikely to keel over tomorrow. The worry is about the day after tomorrow.\n\nWe’re not out of fire season, and fire experts and Forest Service workers are expressing great concern that they won’t have the manpower to keep communities safe.\n\n“It’s just going to be a disaster for the wildfire response this season,” one Forest Service firefighter told Stateline.\n\nSpring break and summer travel season are coming in fast too. The FAA was clear that it didn’t fire any air traffic controllers, but, as you read in this newsletter a few weeks ago, aviation experts believe our flight systems are seriously overtaxed.\n\n“Right now, flight operations are like a rubber band,” the University of North Dakota’s Daniel Adjekum told me recently. “And we keep pulling it.”\n\nAnd it’s not just a matter of fire or flying: a disaster could happen at any time requiring FEMA’s full attention; the CDC might need to be called into action over a new pandemic — federal agencies were already struggling to get bird flu under control.\n\nIt’s impossible to tell you right now what the effects of these cuts will be, and if things will go as badly as some now claim. But the worry is, if things do go south due to lack of personnel, it will be too late — avoidable tragedy will have struck.",

        "content": "is a correspondent at Vox, where he covers the impacts of social and economic policies. He is the author of “Within Our Means,” a biweekly newsletter on ending poverty in America.\n\nA Vox reader asks: What is wealth inequality and class warfare and why is it extra bad at this point in time?\n\n“Wealth” is someone’s net worth — that is, their assets (like savings, stock portfolios, and the value of their property) minus their debts (like student loans). “Wealth inequality” is measured by looking at how total wealth is spread out across the population. The more wealth there is at the top, the more inequality there is because there’s less to go around for everyone else.\n\nExplain It to Me The Explain It to Me newsletter answers an interesting question from an audience member in a digestible explainer from one of our journalists.

This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.\n\nToday, there’s a huge gap in incomes between rich and poor. Even though incomes across the board rose at relatively similar rates in the decades after World War Two, incomes at the very top started to grow much faster after the 1970s — a trend that’s driven, at least in part, by shrinking union membership. For instance, CEOs’ compensation has grown by 1,085 percent since 1978 while the average worker’s salary has only grown by 24 percent.\n\nAnd though wages at the bottom have grown at a faster clip than those at the top in recent years, that change has not been enough to reverse the overall trend. Since 1979, the top 1 percent of earners saw their wages grow by 182 percent; the bottom 90 percent saw their wages grow by 44 percent. As a result, the concentration of money at the top of the income ladder is at the highest it’s been in nearly 100 years.\n\nBut that’s income inequality, which just looks at the distribution of people’s wages. What’s more extreme is the gap in wealth between rich and poor households. According to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, the bottom half of households have an average net worth of $51,000. Collectively, they own just 2.5 percent of household wealth in the country. By contrast, the top 10 percent of households had an average net worth of nearly $7 million and own more than two-thirds of household wealth — a share that has only been growing over the last three decades.\n\nThere are other worrying aspects of the wealth gap, including racial inequality. On average, for every $1 that white families owned, Black families and Latino families owned 23 cents and 19 cents, respectively.\n\nClass warfare, or class conflict, happens when the tension between social classes comes to a boil. That happens when the interests of different classes diverge, building resentment between them. Oftentimes, this comes in the form of protest or revolt and is generally viewed as a struggle between workers and the ruling class or elites in society. Sometimes this gets violent, as was the case in the Great Railroad Strike of 1877, when workers in multiple states went on strike after railroad workers saw their wages get repeatedly cut. Eventually the rebellion was squashed by the National Guard and private militias, and about 100 people were killed.\n\nWhy does this matter?\n\nPart of the reason you might be hearing phrases like “wealth inequality” or “class warfare” more often these days is because the concentration of wealth and power in the hands of the few has been on full display. In January, for example, Donald Trump, a billionaire, was sworn in as president while being surrounded by other billionaires. (There were many, many millionaires in the audience as well.) So as most Americans who watched Trump’s inaugural address saw it on their screens, a handful of the world’s richest men had a front-row seat. In fact, the combined wealth of everyone at the Capitol that day topped $1.2 trillion.\n\nAt its very core, the reason this level of inequality is bad is because it’s deeply unfair. But it’s not just a matter of fairness. It’s also dangerous. The fact that so few people own so much wealth is a threat to democracy.\n\nIn his farewell address, former President Joe Biden warned the nation that the United States was becoming an oligarchy — a system of government in which power is only shared by a small group of elites. It’s a warning that politicians like Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders have been talking about for years, especially after the 2010 Supreme Court decision Citizens United allowed corporations to spend unlimited amounts of money on elections.\n\nRelated Elon Musk and the age of shameless oligarchy\n\nThe hoarding of wealth is already having an impact on our government. Since Trump returned to the White House, he’s handed over a lot of power to Elon Musk, who, with a net worth of hundreds of billions of dollars, stands to be the world’s richest man. And while Musk is charged with gutting the federal workforce, he’s not required to adhere to certain government standards.\n\nWhy is it that Musk has been able to evade the ethics rules that typically apply to other government personnel? And why is it, anyway, that Musk — now an unelected bureaucrat — has so much influence over policymaking? The answer is that Musk likely gained access to so much power because he spent hundreds of millions of dollars on the election last year in an attempt to help Republicans win, and his investment seems to have paid off. He operates by different rules than everyone else because he can simply buy his way to the White House.\n\nThe concentration of wealth has also degraded some of the country’s institutions outside of government. Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, for example, who owns the Washington Post, directed the newspaper’s opinion pages to avoid publishing views that are in conflict with his own, focusing their coverage on “personal liberties and free markets.” Bezos also killed the Post’s endorsement of Kamala Harris last fall.\n\nIt’s not necessarily the case, though, that America is on the brink of a class war, despite the fact that there’s so much inequality that billionaires are taking joyrides to space while millions of Americans are struggling to make ends meet. In fact, the last election cycle showed that people in different income brackets are becoming less politically divided, with Trump making gains among poorer voters, who historically have overwhelmingly voted for Democrats.\n\nBut if history is any guide, this level of inequality is unsustainable, and the economy might course-correct. Between 1800 and 1920, for example, inequality in the US grew very quickly. But in the 60 years that followed, the gap between rich and poor shrank significantly. During that period, the wealth of the average family grew 40 times its size while the wealthiest Americans saw their fortunes double.",

The best charities out there create hundreds of times more happiness per dollar than others, according to new findings published this month by research center Happier Lives Institute in the 2025 World Happiness Report, which ranks countries by happiness each year.\n\nThat means that if you donate your money to the right charities, it can buy a lot of happiness for the world’s neediest people at a stunningly low cost. For example, just $25 can meaningfully boost somebody’s happiness for a year, if you give it to an effective organization like StrongMinds, which treats depression in African countries.\n\nThe Happier Lives Institute figured this out by comparing the impact of different charities using a single standardized metric: the well-being year, or Wellby. It’s pretty straightforward: Imagine that someone asked you, “Overall, how satisfied are you with your life nowadays, on a scale from 0 to 10?” Producing one Wellby for you would mean increasing your life satisfaction by one point for one year.\n\nThe Happier Lives Institute is UK-based, so, for comparison’s sake, it showed how some of the world’s most cost-effective charities stack up against a few charities in the UK (the last six in the chart). As you can see, money donated to the top charities in poorer countries can improve lives much more per dollar than money donated within a rich country, because a dollar goes further abroad.\n\nTo give you a sense of what a few of the “best buy” charities do:\n\nThe case for making people happier — not just wealthier or healthier\n\nIt’s only in the past few years that experts have started evaluating charities using Wellbys as their metric. Since economists love things they can measure objectively, they’ve spent the past century focusing on measuring health and wealth. The best programs have long been considered to be the ones that saved the most lives or increased GDP by the widest margin.\n\nBut as it’s become clear that increasing wealth and health doesn’t always go hand in hand with increasing happiness, a growing chorus of experts has argued that helping people is ultimately about making them happier — not just wealthier or healthier — and the best way to find out how happy people are is to just ask them directly. In other words, we should focus more on subjective well-being: how satisfied people are with their lives based on what they say matters most to them. That revolution in thinking has gathered steam to the point that it’s now featured in well-known, mainstream publications like the World Happiness Report.\n\nSome experts remain a bit skeptical about focusing on subjective well-being because it is, well, subjective.\n\n“I don’t really know what it means for someone to say ‘I’m a 6 out of 10’ in the way that I know what it means for someone to not have a broken arm,” Elie Hassenfeld, the co-founder and CEO of the charity evaluator GiveWell, told me a couple years ago. He also questioned whether a measure of subjective well-being gets at the things we really care about, things that make life worthwhile, like meaning.\n\nIt’s a fair question. But, according to the Happier Lives Institute’s Michael Plant, it shouldn’t stop us from using Wellbys. “Part of the virtue of the subjective approach is that people can bring whatever matters to them into their assessments” of how happy they are, he told me. “So, how much meaning you have in your life could be an input into that.”\n\nPlant also notes that although he’s trying to highlight the organizations that give you the most bang for your charitable buck, that doesn’t necessarily mean that other charities aren’t doing good work or aren’t worth funding at all. We don’t have to turn ourselves into mere optimizing machines — we can care about a diverse set of priorities and split our donations among a range of different charities.\n\nThe point, then, is not that you should ignore needy people in your local community, but that you may also want to look beyond that once you realize that you can make a much bigger difference to those living abroad.\n\n“If a friend told you they gave $200,000 to a charity, you’d probably be extremely impressed — that could be their life savings!” Plant and his colleagues write in the World Happiness Report. “However, it’s possible to have that sort of impact for a fraction of the cost: giving $1,000 to the best charities may do just as much good as $200,000 to a randomly selected one.”",

Planned Parenthood South Atlantic.﻿ ﻿Bill Clark/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images\n\nMedina v. Planned Parenthood South Atlantic should be one of the easiest cases the Supreme Court will decide this year. A federal law requires every state’s Medicaid program to ensure that “any individual eligible for medical assistance” may obtain that care from a competent provider of their choice. The question in Medina is whether that statute means anything, or whether it is a paper tiger that cannot be meaningfully enforced.\n\nIn fairness, the Supreme Court’s rules laying out when a federal Medicaid statute can be enforced through private lawsuits are somewhat complicated, but the 2023 decision in Health and Hospital Corporation of Marion County v. Talevski clarified those rules. There is now no serious argument that that law enabling Medicaid patients to choose their providers cannot be enforced.\n\nSCOTUS, Explained Get the latest developments on the US Supreme Court from senior correspondent Ian Millhiser.

This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.\n\nBut, while the law in Medina is clear, the politics are terrible. The specific issue in Medina is whether South Carolina can cut health providers that also provide abortions out of its Medicaid program (Medicaid funds generally cannot be spent on abortions, but they can be spent on non-abortion care provided by Planned Parenthood). And the Supreme Court has a 6-3 Republican majority.\n\nSo many of the Court’s Republicans seemed to spend Wednesday’s argument looking for a way to get around cases like Talevski. It’s far from clear whether three key justices — Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett — were persuaded by the anti-Medicaid arguments in this case. But, at times, it sure seemed like they wanted to be persuaded.\n\nRelated A Supreme Court case about abortion could destroy Medicaid\n\nThat leaves the outcome in Medina uncertain. If I absolutely had to bet on the outcome, I’d predict that Roberts and Barrett, at the very least, will ultimately reaffirm what the Court said less than two years ago in Talevski — which means that Planned Parenthood will win. But none of the Court’s Republicans appeared to see this case as easy.\n\nWhat’s the legal issue in Medina?\n\nAs a general rule, if someone wants to file a federal lawsuit enforcing a provision of Medicaid law, they cannot sue under the law itself. Instead, they have to file their suit under a law known as “Section 1983,” which permits suits against state officials who deprive someone of “any rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution and laws.”\n\nIn Blessing v. Freestone (1997), however, the Court said that this statute does not permit anyone to file any lawsuit to enforce any provision of federal law. Instead, because Section 1983 refers to “rights,” “a plaintiff must assert the violation of a federal right, not merely a violation of federal law.”\n\nThe test the Court uses to determine whether a particular federal law creates an enforceable right was recently reiterated in Talevski, which held that the key question is whether “the provision in question is ‘phrased in terms of the persons benefited’ and contains ‘rights-creating,’ individual-centric language with an ‘unmistakable focus on the benefited class.’”\n\nThus, for example, a statute which says that “no state shall deny a person who is wearing pants the ability to take a walk” would be enforceable through private lawsuits, because this statute focuses on the people who benefit from it (people wearing pants). A similar law that says “states shall not interfere with walking” may not be enforceable, because it does not have the same individual-centric language demanded by Talevski.\n\nWith that in mind, here is the statute at issue in Medina:\n\nA State plan for medical assistance must … provide that … any individual eligible for medical assistance (including drugs) may obtain such assistance from any institution, agency, community pharmacy, or person, qualified to perform the service or services required (including an organization which provides such services, or arranges for their availability, on a prepayment basis), who undertakes to provide him such services.\n\nThis law does everything Talevski demands. It provides a right to a specific individuals (“any individual eligible for medical assistance” under Medicaid), and it lays out the content of that right — the right to obtain assistance from a provider of their choice. As Justice Elena Kagan pointed out early in Wednesday’s oral argument, it is nearly “impossible” to even describe what this statute does “without using the word ‘right.’”\n\nA Court that intends to follow the rule laid out two years ago in Talevski, in other words, would hand down a very brief, unanimous opinion in holding that South Carolina Medicaid patients have a right to choose Planned Parenthood as their health provider.\n\nMany of the justices appeared determined to make this case more complicated than it is\n\nThough some members of the Court’s right flank appeared to be probing for a way to rule against abortion providers, none of the justices proposed a coherent legal rule that would allow them to dodge Talevski. Justice Samuel Alito, for example, was unusually quiet on Wednesday, though he did speak up at one point to complain that Medicaid laws, which permit private lawsuits, are supposed to be “something that’s quite extraordinary.”\n\nSimilarly, Justice Clarence Thomas asked a few questions emphasizing his belief that it should be harder to enforce federal laws that are tied to federal spending programs such as Medicaid, as opposed to laws enacted under Congress’s power to regulate private actors.\n\nA few of the justices, meanwhile, fixated on a concurring opinion by Judge Julius Richardson, a Trump appointee to a federal appeals court who complained that there is uncertainty about whether lower court judges should follow Talevski or a slightly different legal framework laid out in Blessing and Wilder v. Virginia Hospital Association (1990). According to Richardson, lower courts “continue to lack the guidance inferior judges need.”\n\nIn fairness, Roberts and Barrett sometimes seemed incredulous that there’s any real confusion about whether Talevski lays out the proper rule. Barrent asked Planned Parenthood’s lawyer Nicole Saharsky if the Court could just say in its opinion that lower courts should follow Talevski, and Saharsky did not object. Roberts said that the Court could simply say that “we meant it” when it handed down Talevski and a related case.\n\nKavanaugh, however, was all over the map. South Carolina’s primary argument is that the Medicaid statute must use specific magic words, such as the word “right,” in order to authorize private lawsuits. As Kagan pointed out, the Court has never imposed such a requirement in its past cases, and she warned against “changing the rules midstream” because Congress could not have known that it had to use certain magic words when it wrote the Medicaid statute — or any other existing law.\n\nBut Kavanaugh seemed to disagree, stating at one point that he isn’t “averse to magic words.” Kavanaugh’s questions indicated that he is so concerned with coming up with a clear, easy-to-apply test that he is willing to sacrifice the rights of Medicaid patients to achieve this broader goal.\n\nStill, it’s far from clear whether Kavanaugh can find five votes for a magic words requirement, or even whether Kavanaugh will himself vote to overrule cases like Talevski.",

He joined Vox in 2022 after reporting on national and international politics for the Atlantic’s politics, global, and ideas teams, including the role of Latino voters in the 2020 election.\n\nDemonstrators hold signs as they protest the deportation of Assistant Professor of Medicine Dr. Rasha Alawieh of Brown University at the statehouse in Providence, Rhode Island, on March 17, 2025. Joseph Prezioso/AFP via Getty Images\n\nDonald Trump’s popularity is slipping. His honeymoon is over, views of the economy and his stewardship of it are souring, and while inflation and prices remain the public’s top priority, they see his administration as focusing on other things.\n\nYet the area where they think Trump is most focusing his attention is also the one where he’s most popular: immigration. It’s what the public thinks he’s handling best, and it’s the issue buoying his overall approval rating right now.\n\nA couple recent national polls show how resilient this dynamic is. Take the latest March CBS News/YouGov poll. It finds that an outright majority — 53 percent — of the American public approves of Trump’s handling of immigration. They approve of his mass deportation pledge, and the numbers remain largely unchanged since last month.\n\nThat majority support on immigration stands in contrast to his other ratings in that poll. Some 48 percent of Americans approve of his handling of the economy, with 52 percent disapproving in late March. That’s down from 51 percent approval a month ago. And when it comes to inflation, specifically, just 44 percent approve, down from 46 percent last month.\n\nThose sharper marks on immigration come not only despite questions about the legality of the administration’s methods, but also as news organizations reveal embarrassing and concerning revelations about who has been targeted for deportations and detentions.\n\nWhile this news coverage grows, and Trump’s overall favorability continues to slip, it’s worth asking why his immigration agenda remains popular — and just what might turn it negative.\n\nAs the administration veers into a more authoritarian direction in its treatment of immigrants, these shifts will be crucial to track, particularly for those hoping to organize political pressure and public support.\n\nWhat recent polls tell us\n\nThe late March CBS News/YouGov poll of American adults conducted late last week shows basically no change from the last CBS/YouGov poll from late February. Some 53 percent of Americans approve of Trump’s immigration handling in March, while 54 percent approved in February.\n\nThe same when asking about the Trump administration’s “program to deport immigrants illegally.” Among all adults, 58 percent approve — essentially mirroring findings in February, when 59 percent of respondents approved.\n\nThe second national survey that shows Trump’s resilient immigration support is a AP-NORC poll from March. The public, this poll suggests, is split evenly: 49 percent approve of Trump’s immigration approach, while 50 percent disapprove. Again, views of his handling of other issues are much more negative, but even one in five Democrats approve Trump’s immigration approach, per the survey’s results.\n\nThe findings are revelatory, given the poll generally finds more negative views of Trump compared to other March polls conducted by other firms. It’s an outlier, for example, in showing a double-digit net-negative rating for Trump’s overall favorability: 56 percent disapproving and 42 percent approving.\n\nFor now, there’s not a clear reason for this sustained support. It might be a sign of Trump’s effective messaging about the issue. From the start, this administration has embarked on a polished and digital-savvy media and advertising tour to frame their deportation efforts as a way to target immigrants who have committed crimes — which happens to be the specific condition that is most popular when surveys offer respondents a variety of options for deportation policy. The administration has recorded and released social media videos, traditional TV advertising, and clips of Homeland Security secretary Kristi Noem tagging along with ICE agents, meeting with border agents at the southern border, and even speaking from the prison in El Salvador many deportees are being sent.\n\nIn turn, this (essentially) campaigning on immigration may be amplifying the effects of polarization, since it’s hardcore conservatives and Republicans who care the most about immigration (both in the lead-up to the 2024 election and since Trump’s inauguration).\n\nAnd these numbers might also just represent a deeper, wider reality for America. The American polity has generally polarized against immigration, and would prefer to see rates of immigration decline. That’s been true since the post-pandemic era spike in southern border crossings and asylum claims, and was a major 2024 campaign issue that Trump largely sees as responsible for his own election.\n\nOf course, there may also be survey-design limitations: These polls capture the vaguer idea of restrictive immigration policy that Trump came to represent, as opposed to the public’s views on specific policies or scenarios. Public opinion tends to vary tremendously once you ask more specific questions about who might be targeted for deportation, how widespread those enforcement actions should be, and whether there should be conditions or more leniency given to some kinds of undocumented immigrants. And for now, it’s not clear yet what impact news coverage and the government’s response to the most recent specific high-profile deportations will have.\n\nAs news coverage, political debate, and outcry grow, (like over the role of foreign prisons and Guantánamo Bay in holding immigrants, and stories of specific, controversial cases), the public may end up polarizing against Trump. That’s what happened during late 2017 and 2018 — the peak of Trump 1.0’s anti-immigrant, kids-in-cages policies. It was around that time that public support for immigration of all kinds began to spike, and openness to more migration grew.",

In her experience, the greatest decluttering hurdle is finding the will to get started. Some clients have the perception that the task will be too difficult, the project too big. Maybe you’re in the same boat. Or perhaps the online content you’ve seen around home organization — rife with expensive bins and colorful labels — has you feeling pressured to drop hundreds of dollars on products. However, the secret to decluttering, experts say, is to rely on function over aesthetics and to organize like a real person and not an influencer.\n\nStart with a small, manageable task\n\nFor those who struggle getting started, take some pressure off: You don’t need to organize your entire house in one weekend. But you should begin with a smaller task or area, ideally one that causes you the most aggravation. Are you constantly tripping over shoes and bookbags as soon as you walk in the door? Start with your entranceway. Does your laundry pile up on an office chair that you’d really like to sit in again? Tackle that first. Do you struggle to find a spot for groceries in the fridge? Make that your project for the day.\n\n“Decluttering is decision-making,” Wiss says, “and it’s exhausting, and there’s decision fatigue, and you could at some point just hit a wall.”\n\nIf even those assignments seem too big, Wiss suggests breaking them down into micro-tasks: clearing out just the vegetable drawer or storing winter coats. Keep these smaller projects relegated to one room and commit to slowly making progress over time, says professional organizer Robyn Reynolds, the CEO of Southern California-based company Organize2Harmonize. “If you do a corner here in this room and a corner there in the other room, you’re not really going to see the progress and then you’re going to feel defeated,” she says. “But if you actually are able to finish an entire room, then you’re going to feel really motivated and proud of yourself because you actually did it.”\n\nYou might let that momentum carry you onto another small to-do list item. But be mindful of your energy levels. You don’t want to empty your pantry and lack the motivation to put everything back. “Decluttering is decision-making,” Wiss says, “and it’s exhausting, and there’s decision fatigue, and you could at some point just hit a wall and then you still need for those piles to go somewhere.”\n\nTry the three-second rule for purging\n\nWiss has a straightforward three-step approach to decluttering: Sort like with like, purge, then containerize. First, make sure everything you want to organize is in one place. For instance, all of your chargers should live in one area, all of your shoes should be stored in the same place, all your bowls and plates should be in the kitchen. Then, you can see how many chargers or sneakers or bowls you have and pare down where needed.\n\nIf you’re finding it hard to part with impractical but sentimental items… Remind yourself that you’re not discarding the memory of a loved one, just their possessions. If the item is not your style and you’ll never use it, let it go. Don’t hold onto items that will only get damaged over years in storage. “So many times when I clear out garages with clients,” Reynolds says, “so many things we find [have] mold or water damage. So what was the point of holding on to it when it just got destroyed and now they’re throwing it out anyway?”\n\nThe purge stage can often be challenging because many people attach memories and sentiments to objects and find it difficult to part with them. Kayleen Kelly, a professional organizer in Olympia, Washington, developed a three-second rule to help her clients pare down items. After you’ve collected and sorted all of one category of item — like coffee mugs — go through one by one and decide which item you’ll keep. If you hesitate for more than three seconds when weighing whether or not to keep a specific mug, it’s an automatic keep. This technique ensures you’re making confident decisions about what to get rid of. “If you can’t decide,” Kelly says, “and you hesitate, there’s no punishment for indecision. So you just keep it and you keep moving forward.”\n\nTo further aid your decision-making process, ask yourself if the item is actually useful, Reynolds says. Again, not everything needs to be utilitarian, but it isn’t worth keeping posters from college you never plan on hanging up again. But if you do manage to get infrequent but meaningful use out of that family heirloom fondue pot, by all means, keep it. Reynolds also recommends taking photos of sentimental but impractical items and collecting them in a photo book or digital slideshow. That way, you can memorialize grandma’s couch without needing to sacrifice space for it in your basement.\n\nOnce you’ve pared down items, you can properly organize them. This is where you’ll create a system for your closet, garage, pantry, or other area you’re decluttering. It can be as simple as dedicating one shelf in the linen closet to sheets and another for towels.\n\nDon’t spend money on organizers when an old shoebox will do\n\nExperts have observed clients’ all-too-common urge to buy expensive organizers and bins before they even start discarding items. Online, influencers push aesthetically pleasing storage containers and label makers, only adding to the pressure that true decluttering involves spending money. “It’s not about buying more products,” Kelly says. The reality is, once you pare down your makeup brushes, you may realize you don’t need a container, and a cup from the kitchen will do.\n\nThe most important aspect of organizing, Kelly says, is for your system of choice to be functional, so don’t waste money on eight-tier hangers if you know you lack the patience to put eight shirts on them. If you do need a container, try to reuse what you already have at home, like a shoebox, Tupperware, an old iPhone box, or a piece of cardboard from an Amazon box as a drawer organizer. For everything else, your local dollar store will have inexpensive organizers and bins.\n\nDonate what you don’t need\n\nThe most integral aspect of decluttering is to remove the clutter from your space. Don’t get hung up on the logistics until after you’ve set aside the items you want to get rid of, Kelly says. In her experience, most of her clients’ discarded items are in good enough condition to be donated. “Find a place in your local area that takes the majority of everything,” she says. That might be your local Goodwill, Salvation Army, thrift store, or women’s shelter.\n\nRelated Buy less stuff\n\nAfter organizing smaller spaces, like your linen closet or the cabinet under the sink, you may have a more limited collection of items to donate. You can be more targeted with these donations, Kelly says, since you have less to discard — and fewer decisions to make.\n\nLocal Buy Nothing Facebook groups are also effective in finding your stuff a new home.\n\nFor items that can’t be donated or given away, look up your city or town’s recycling rules. If all else fails, throw items in the trash.\n\nMake it a habit\n\nBecause life inevitably happens, systems may fall into disarray and products may once again accumulate. Decluttering should be an ongoing process throughout the year.\n\nTo keep her clients in a clutter-free state of mind, Reynolds often imparts some words of wisdom. “Everything has a price: time, space, money, or energy,” she says. Consider what your clutter is costing you in terms of the time that could be better spent doing anything other than decluttering, the space your items take up, the money it costs to keep, and the vibe it brings to your home.",

One of his first moves was to withdraw the US from the World Health Organization (WHO), the United Nations’ global health agency responsible for safeguarding and promoting health around the world since 1948.\n\nThe US is one of the WHO’s biggest funders, so any shortage of financial and political support will likely have major ramifications for global health efforts like eliminating malaria, improving access to high-quality health care, and reducing maternal mortality. While that may not directly matter to rich countries like the US that have the means to address their own health challenges, one of the WHO’s most important jobs is to help coordinate the international response to pandemics and outbreaks — events that can threaten everyone, regardless of borders, as we learned during Covid-19.\n\nTo Trump and his supporters, the WHO’s perceived failure on that job is one of the biggest reasons why the US should withdraw. Chief among Trump’s complaints are the WHO’s mishandling of the Covid-19 pandemic and other global health crises, its failure to reform, and its inability to demonstrate independence from powerful but authoritarian WHO member states, namely China.\n\nTrump’s decision has engendered plenty of criticism, including from experts who argue that the US could suffer if it loses access to vital WHO data on outbreaks. Still, the WHO is far from perfect, and even before Trump, scientists, think tanks, and government bodies have been pointing out the WHO’s myriad problems, from the lack of term limits for senior leadership to its massive budget for headquarters staff who are paid additional stipends (around $5,000 to $7,000 per month) to cover the cost of living in Geneva, one of the world’s most expensive cities.\n\nFuture Perfect Explore the big, complicated problems the world faces and the most efficient ways to solve them.

Like Trump, my biggest complaint is that the organization has shown it is loath to reflect on and address its deficiencies — deficiencies that matter hugely when it has been given the monumental responsibility of safeguarding the world’s health. There has always been some intangible and unspoken sense that the WHO cannot be wrong and cannot be questioned, even after it was clear that it bungled certain aspects of the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nBut while the WHO is far from perfect, many of its flaws are symptoms of more fundamental challenges that go beyond how it is governed. Balancing the need to respond to international health threats while respecting national sovereignty means cooperation is a fine line — and it’s one that’s becoming harder for the agency to walk.\n\nFor the WHO to survive, it needs to improve. And for the US to have the best chances of protecting itself from future global health emergencies — especially as the Trump administration also works to dismantle the United States Agency for International Development, another key player in global health and development — it still needs the WHO. But it needs a better one.\n\nWhat Trump gets right — and wrong — about WHO\n\nIn his executive order, Trump reiterated many of the same issues he raised five years ago when he first threatened to withdraw from the WHO.\n\nOne of Trump’s biggest complaints was that the agency was too slow to alert the world of an emerging health threat in China and to move to contain its spread. Local newspapers had been reporting that a mysterious illness was spreading around Wuhan as early as November 17, 2019, a fact backed up by genetic analysis.\n\nBut Chinese health authorities didn’t alert the WHO — which the country was required to do under a legal framework called the International Health Regulations — to a spate of patients with an unknown pneumonia-like disease until December 31. By then, valuable time to contain the disease had been lost, though it is Beijing, not WHO, that is largely at fault for this lag.\n\nStill, while the WHO has limited if any power to compel China or any other country to act, the body should have been more proactive in November and December.\n\n“WHO has country offices, WHO has relationships with Ministries of Health. I would argue they certainly should have been aware this was happening,” said Ashish Jha, the dean of Brown University’s School of Public Health and the White House Covid-19 response coordinator during the Biden administration. “It was showing up in a lot of media, social media, and they should have pushed the government to say, what is this? What is going on here, and why don’t we know more about it?”\n\nWithin five days of learning about the unusual cases in China, the WHO had alerted its member states. But the WHO’s Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus traveled to China and, instead of confronting the government about its obfuscation, heralded Beijing’s response to the outbreak. And then the WHO consistently parrotted inaccurate information from the Chinese government — namely that the virus was not spreading from person to person — to the rest of the world for weeks.\n\nWhile the WHO proclaimed Covid-19 a public health emergency in late January, the messaging from the highest levels of WHO in those early months, when officials believed it was still possible that Covid could be contained, was too often confusing.\n\n“For the moment, we are not witnessing sustained and intensive community transmission of this virus, and we are not witnessing large-scale severe disease or death,” Ghebreyesus said during a briefing in late February. That was simply untrue. By that time, China had reported almost 80,000 cases and nearly 3,000 deaths from Covid-19, while 37 other countries were also reporting cases and deaths.\n\nIt also took the WHO two years, until late 2021, to finally acknowledge that Covid-19 was airborne, despite the mountain of evidence that scientists had amassed just six months after the first cases. A WHO spokesperson pushed back against this. “From January 2020, WHO said transmission was occurring between people when they breathe, talk (later sing) and especially in settings like hospitals, households and long term living facilities,” a spokesperson told Vox by email. While some of this confusion stemmed from longstanding disagreement on what exactly constitutes airborne spread, as late as March 2020 the WHO was still confidently tweeting, “FACT: #COVID19 is NOT airborne,” even as people were being infected through the air.\n\nWHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus at a daily press briefing on Covid-19 on March 11, 2020. Fabrice Coffrini/AFP via Getty Images\n\nTrump has also repeatedly criticized the WHO for not fully investigating the theory that the Covid-19 virus originated from virological work in a laboratory in Wuhan, rather than the conventional explanation that it began in wild animals sold at a meat market. The WHO sent a team of investigators to China in 2021, but Chinese scientists refused to discuss the so-called “lab leak” theory and then pressured investigators to dismiss the possibility altogether, according to the lead scientist on the team.\n\nAgain, though, the WHO has no authority to compel member states to turn over data or to cooperate on investigations. In fact, the WHO cannot even work inside a member state without that country’s permission. This is certainly a limitation of the WHO, but that’s because it answers to its member states — it is not some sort of supra-national health policy enforcement body.\n\nBeyond Covid, Trump has also griped that the WHO requires the US to make “unfairly onerous” payments, because US dues exceed the payment the organization demands of China, which has about four times the number of people as in the US.\n\nThe WHO is funded in two ways. The first is through assessed contributions, essentially membership dues, that each WHO member state is required to pay each year. The United Nations has a process for determining how much each country owes, but it’s essentially based on a country’s gross domestic product (GDP), not its population size.\n\nUS GDP in 2023 was about 1.5 times higher than China’s. That year, the US was required to pay the WHO $218 million, about two times more than China was assessed. So while the US does pay more than China, that difference is almost, though not quite, proportional to GDP.\n\nAssessed contributions, however, make up less than 20 percent of the WHO’s total funds. Its other funding comes from voluntary contributions from member states and non-governmental donors, such as the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.\n\nHere is where the US and China make vastly different contributions to the WHO. In 2023, China gave the organization about $40 million in voluntary contributions plus an additional $935,000 toward an emergency fund on top of its assessed contribution, while the US government donated more than $1 billion in voluntary funds and about $47 million toward the emergency fund. In all, that meant the US gave the WHO about $1.27 billion in 2023, about 18 percent of their total budget, while China gave about $156 million when you tally up all contributions. So while the US does give vastly more to the WHO than China, most of that is in voluntary donations.\n\nOf course, the US doesn’t have to pull out of the WHO altogether to rectify this situation — it could simply choose to donate less to the WHO, or mandate that its contributions come with reform. And the institution does need reform.\n\nWho’s at fault at WHO, explained\n\nCovid wasn’t the first time the WHO came under international fire. Take the 2014 Ebola outbreak in West Africa.\n\nThe organization was criticized back in 2014 for its long delay in declaring the outbreak a public health emergency, which hindered swift containment measures that could have prevented the virus from spreading across borders. From the start, the WHO fundamentally underestimated the severity of the outbreak — Ebola would go on to kill more than 11,000 people primarily in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone, with scattered cases reported in the US and several European countries, too. It ultimately took the WHO and its partners two years to get the Ebola outbreak under control.\n\nDespite the number of deaths, Ebola’s spread was limited largely because it isn’t a respiratory disease like Covid-19; rather it spreads through direct contact with an infected person’s bodily fluids. But that fact makes the failure to contain Ebola all the more glaring.\n\nTo be fair, all outbreak and pandemic responses are chaotic, especially when an entirely novel virus like Covid starts spreading. New information is constantly emerging, and a lot of different individuals and institutions have to come together to coordinate the flow of information and the rollout of interventions or recommendations, even as the full picture of the outbreak is inevitably unclear. Outbreaks often happen in far-flung areas that lack health care workers, hospitals, laboratories, and even roads and internet. Cultural practices, economic conditions, and a preexisting lack of trust in politicians and health officials further complicate responses.\n\nA health worker waits to handle a new unconfirmed Ebola patient at a newly built Doctors Without Borders-supported Ebola treatment center on November 7, 2018, in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

But the WHO, which has its own process for reviewing and approving drugs and vaccines, did not approve the vaccine until September 2024.\n\nThat delay mattered. For one, other organizations like UNICEF and Gavi that play a critical role in procuring and distributing vaccines in developing countries require WHO approval before they can move forward with vaccination campaigns. Many developing countries do not have or have only pared-down versions of drug regulatory agencies so they also rely on the WHO to approve medicines before they roll them out in their countries, explained Rogério Gaspar, the director of WHO’s Department of Regulation and Prequalification. And so when it came to the mpox vaccine, many countries — especially in Africa, where the outbreak was most severe — were waiting for the green light from WHO before they could roll out the needed vaccines, even though the US and Europe had already approved them.\n\nThe WHO blames the long delay on Bavarian Nordic. The WHO claimed that the company did not submit the mpox vaccine for review until August 2024, some two years after the mpox outbreak had begun, and that once it did, the WHO approved it within two weeks, according to a WHO spokesperson.\n\nBut Bavarian Nordic refutes this timeline. A spokesperson told Vox that the pharmaceutical company first met with WHO in August 2022 and submitted a dossier on the vaccine in May 2023. The dossier they submitted to the WHO contained the same information that led to the European Medicines Agency, the equivalent of the FDA, approving the vaccine for use in Europe. It isn’t clear why the WHO didn’t act sooner. Back in August 2024, the WHO director of health product policy and standards, Deusdedit Mubangizi, told reporters that there wasn’t enough data to support its approval. But now, it seems, the WHO has changed its story, ducking accountability once again.\n\nThe entire process has frustrated some public health experts. “It’s almost like WHO saying, hey, we’re not responsible for our own process,” Jha said. “This is the lack of accountability. It’s everybody else’s fault.”\n\n(A WHO spokesperson pointed out that member states did not have to wait until the WHO’s review was complete to buy and distribute the vaccines.)\n\nOver the years, the WHO has tried to address its critics through a laundry list of reform efforts — and there has been some improvement. Between 2020 and 2022, smaller Ebola outbreaks in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Uganda, and Guinea have been contained in just a few months. That’s a hopeful signal the organization has potentially improved not only its own ability to quickly respond to outbreaks, but has also helped build member states’ capacity to detect and contain health emergencies. It also helps that since 2014, scientists have also developed a number of vaccines and treatments that would certainly help quell an outbreak.\n\nStill, while there were improvements in the Ebola response that can be attributable to the WHO, the organization’s dismal performance during the Covid-19 pandemic suggests that these reforms remain insufficient. And the bigger issue is that the WHO simply cannot admit its mistakes. The organization has still not come out and listed the errors it made during the Covid-19 pandemic. Though the WHO convened an independent panel of experts to review the international response to Covid-19, the panel’s reports largely focus on the failures of WHO member states and say little about the WHO’s own shortcomings.\n\n“There is very little interest at WHO in introspection,” Jha said. “There’s very little interest in WHO in figuring out how to do better.”\n\nAnd given how enormous — and how difficult — the WHO’s responsibilities are, that introspection is needed.\n\nThe WHO’s impossible task\n\nThe WHO’s mission is to foster global public health, but what that means in practice depends on what counts as global. As it stands, its 194 member states (193 without the US) have tasked the organization with outbreak prevention and response and other responsibilities that impact nearly all countries. That includes setting international health standards and collecting data on an ever-increasing list of health priorities ranging from maternal and child health and nutrition to sanitation and clean water. But some of the WHO’s work focuses on supplementing national health programs and filling gaps that benefit individual nations — specifically those with the least resources — rather than the world as a whole.\n\nThose responsibilities fit poorly with a Trump administration that is bringing an America First approach to health — and other countries are taking notice. Argentina has announced that it also plans to withdraw from the WHO, while Italian politicians have introduced legislation that would do the same. Other European countries have slashed global health aid budgets in recent years.\n\nThat the US cannot remain a WHO member while also consciously putting itself first highlights a friction in the field. Is global health about containing dangerous outbreaks so they don’t breach your own border and pose a threat to national security? Or is global health about saving lives and improving the health of everyone, regardless of their nationality? Can competing nation-states like China and the US set aside their political warfare and come together on one issue — health — or has the time for international cooperation finally ended?\n\nOne way to address that contradiction would be for the WHO to scale back on the number of health areas it is involved in and focus primarily on issues that actually transcend borders. This would include infectious diseases — but only those that present a truly global threat.\n\nThe WHO itself puts together a list of pathogens with the potential to cause a pandemic. It includes familiar diseases such as West Nile, Zika, Ebola, and Covid-19. Many of these have already caused deadly outbreaks and pandemics. Something else that transcends borders: products such as cigarettes or baby formula. The WHO might also have a role to play in regulating the safety of these products, according to Jesse Bump, a public health professor at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.\n\nThis recommendation is not to say that newborn and maternal health or access to clean water are not important, life-saving services that everyone on Earth should have. But these represent more national health priorities for the countries dealing with these issues and not truly global threats.\n\nWithout some form of additional support, paring down the WHO’s focus areas would have fatal consequences for some places. Particularly in low-income countries, the WHO serves as a lifeline of essential health services and often fills many of the responsibilities that national health agencies in wealthy nations like the US handle, a WHO spokesperson explained.\n\nOf course, the fact that the WHO is tasked with addressing so many different areas of health fundamentally reflects both the massive health disparities around the world and the way the organization is funded. Consider the health challenges that a country like the US faces compared to many developing countries. In places like Niger, Papua New Guinea, Chad, and the DRC, more than half of the population does not have access to clean drinking water or basic water services. More than 50 percent of people in Somalia and Haiti are malnourished. In southern Africa, HIV is still a leading cause of death; in parts of West Africa, malaria is a leading cause of death.\n\nIn much of the global north, by contrast, these health challenges are virtually nonexistent, and where they are present, it’s because of national priorities, not a lack of national resources.\n\nConsider as well the drastic difference in the health workforce around the world. In many low- and middle-income counties, there are major shortages of doctors and nurses, not to mention specialists such as neurologists or surgeons. In more than 50 countries, mostly in Africa and the Middle East, there are fewer than one doctor per 1,000 people in the entire country. The US has almost four times as many doctors per capita.\n\nWhat this means is that the state of health and health care is so grossly unequal across countries that one organization cannot possibly address them all while also ensuring that every member states benefits equally from their WHO membership.\n\nAnd the benefits are unequal, at least in strict financial terms. Last year, countries in Africa and the WHO’s Eastern Mediterranean region — which includes parts of North Africa and the Middle East including some very poor and conflict-afflicted member states such as Afghanistan, Yemen, Syria, Somalia, and Sudan — received $2.9 billion, almost half of the WHO’s $6.8 billion budget. The region of the Americas, which includes the US, received the least amount of funding, just over $300 million. But even here, it’s important to understand that the inequality in who gives and who gets from the WHO is largely a function of the fact that some regions and countries simply have a massively greater need for international aid.\n\nIt’s important to remember that the WHO has limited control over its own agenda. It is member states themselves who vote on the organization’s scope of work and approve its budget. Beyond the required payments, countries and other donors can earmark their voluntary funds for specific causes. The US, for instance, earmarks more than half of its funds for epidemic prevention or response and polio eradication while Nordic countries typically focus their funding on maternal health.\n\nThis approach to funding helps the WHO account for individual member state priorities but also allows countries to use funds to influence the WHO’s scope of work. Ultimately, it means that the WHO has little choice but to expand and scatter its workforce to make sure every country’s pet projects get completed.\n\nIs there any room for WHO in America First?\n\nShort of remaking the WHO into an institution under the leadership of the US government, it’s difficult to imagine that any amount of reform will satisfy the current administration. The organization’s mission is completely misaligned with Trump’s “America First” agenda. In the WHO, as in most other UN international bodies, America does not come first. It has the same vote as every other member state, even though the US contributes more money than any other country.\n\nBut despite its many shortcomings, the US needs the WHO. Only an international health agency such as the WHO can overcome the nuanced complexities of economic competition, geopolitics, and even outright war, to respond to global health emergencies. The WHO serves as a bridge for sharing information and even biological samples of pathogens, which is critical for understanding how a disease will spread and for developing medicines and vaccines.\n\nTrump’s vision of global health or public health, for that matter, is unclear. Just as unclear is whether Trump’s executive order on the WHO is even legal. Members of Congress have asked Trump to reconsider. Though the full impact of the US withdrawal will probably not be felt for about a year, the WHO’s director-general has already ordered a hiring freeze, mandated that some contracts be renegotiated, and directed staff in country offices to provide only essential support.\n\nAs the WHO adapts to a future without US investment, the Trump administration is also gutting other key global health efforts. This month, thousands of USAID staff were laid off, leaving only about 300 employees of a once 10,000-person workforce. It isn’t yet clear what global health areas the drastically smaller agency will work on — or whether it will exist at all — and it wouldn’t be surprising if the administration goes after other global health initiatives like the ones led by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nAmerican retreat from both the WHO and its own broader global health efforts paradoxically makes the case for WHO reform all the more important. Many complaints about how the WHO does its work are valid, especially given its reluctance to confront mistakes. But much of what it is criticized for is built into the way the institution itself operates or reflects a world with hugely varying health problems and national abilities to meet them. Still, the WHO must do better because it is the only organization uniquely placed to bridge diplomatic tensions and address international health threats. The most hopeful read on Trump’s action will shock the bureaucracy into action, and lead the Trump administration to ultimately realize that an American-first approach must include the WHO.",

She joined Vox in 2022 as a senior producer and then as host of The Weeds, Vox’s policy podcast.\n\nIf you’ve read the news lately, you’ve probably heard that Americans may be in the middle of a sex recession. But at least one demographic of people are having the best sex of their lives: Gen X women. At least that’s the argument writer Mireille Silcoff makes in her most recent piece in the New York Times magazine.\n\nIn it, she explores her own middle-aged sexual awakening. “I was trying to explain a moment that I was really seeing everywhere,” she told Vox. Between her own life, her friends’ experiences, and the portrayals in pop culture that were popping up everywhere, she sensed a trend emerging. “There seems to be something new in the air having to do with 50-year-old women, their bodies, sex, and relationships.”\n\nSo what is in the air right now? And what’s behind these later-in-life sexual revelations? We talked to Silfcoff to find out exactly what’s going on here in this week’s episode of Explain It to Me, Vox’s weekly call-in show. Below is an excerpt of our conversation, edited for length and clarity. You can listen to Explain It to Me on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, or wherever you get podcasts. If you’d like to submit a question, send an email to askvox@vox.com or call 1-800-618-8545.\n\nWhat prompted you to write about this in the first place?\n\nI split up from my ex in my late 40s, after a very long relationship of 21 years. When I came out of it, I just thought that what lay ahead of me would be a pretty spinster-ish existence. I was really, really sick for a long time in my adulthood, and my marriage was very long and there were two children. I just felt like, “Well, who is going to want this bag of problems? Now I’m 50.” Life is going to be orange pekoe tea, Masterpiece Theater, taking care of my kids, and hopefully remobilizing my writing, and that’s it. And then instead what happened was I had a lot of wonderful new relationships with a lot of wonderful men and the kind of sex that I don’t think I had even had in my 20s: a total new world of openness, exploration, interest, comfort in myself, self-knowledge and even, I daresay, wisdom. It felt revelatory.\n\nExplain It to Me The Explain It to Me newsletter answers an interesting question from an audience member in a digestible explainer from one of our journalists.

This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.\n\nAnd at first, I felt like this was my weird, cool story. But then, as stuff started coming out of the culture, some of my other friends divorced and had similar situations to mine, I realized that what I had been doing or what I had experienced post-marriage was really part of a much larger cultural story that might ring true for many women in America and beyond today.\n\nWhat do you think the factors are in this mid-life sexual revitalization?\n\nThe women who are middle-aged now are — for the most part — Gen X. You’re starting to get some millennial middle-aged people as well. And Gen X women had a really interesting formative experience when it comes to sex in the ’90s. Divorce is also happening later than ever.\n\nDivorce and sexual exploration for women is a very old story: You get divorced and suddenly find a little piece of yourself sexually. I feel like that’s kind of a big part of the story as well. So women having a bit of this sexual rediscovery later and finding when they’re 47 or 55 that desire is still there, that sexual function is still there, that — thanks to the amazing strides that Gen Z and millennials have made opening up what’s acceptable sexually — acceptance is still there.\n\nRelated The online sex police are always watching and always so mad\n\nSo Gen X women are more comfortable in their bodies. They may be more into figuring out kinks and things like that. Why do you think this is happening with Gen X women in particular? Why is this generation so different from boomers?\n\nBoomers were constricted by a lot of societal norms that were, for lack of a better way of putting it, very mid-century. There was an open attitude toward sex, and free love was a boomer construct. But what happened with all of that stuff is that when all of those ideas really came to roost in the late ’80s and the early ’90s — when women were suddenly working but men were still the bosses — it created a tough situation for the people who inherited that very open sexual culture.\n\nI see Gen X as being a generation of women who really were plunked into an extremely sexualized landscape and were needing to fend for themselves. There wasn’t a lot of support for how to navigate bosses who were sexually predatory. There weren’t a lot of roadmaps for how to have sex or how to be a sexual person. That was both good and bad, because, for instance, many women didn’t experience orgasms because they just couldn’t figure out how and their male partners couldn’t figure out how so it just didn’t happen. I feel like that wouldn’t happen now. You’ve got things like OMG Yes, which is a website where you can find out how to have a female orgasm. It’s a much more open environment now in order to find out about sex. But at the same time among the younger generations, there is a bit of a cliff that’s happened with sexual frequency.\n\nI want to talk about that a little bit. There are so many conversations right now about how young people are having less and less sex. It seems like there’s a backlash to sex positivity. Do you think millennials and Gen Z women take these sexual freedoms for granted?\n\nYou do take it for granted, as you should. The parents create the situation, and the young people take it for granted.\n\nI think that the culture has basically conspired in every way imaginable against intimacy, against having an open and easy sexuality, against relationships. I don’t think it’s a coincidence that you really see the sexual drop-off starting to happen in the same years that the iPhone was introduced. It’s in the same years that social media really got going.\n\n“The culture has basically conspired in every way imaginable against intimacy, against having an open and easy sexuality, against relationships.”\n\nPeople go out less, they hang out less. They do things together less in weird spaces where things can get weird. There was a lot more natural weirdness back in the day. And natural weirdness can lead to intimate moments, which can lead to sex. I just feel like there’s a certain cleanliness of experience in the culture right now where people are so afraid to intermingle in those old ways. It has had a big effect on people’s ability to hook up or have casual sex or go from one boyfriend to another to another until you find one that you like. In some ways, I think it’s wonderful for middle-aged people who already had that socialization.\n\nWhat do you hope for middle-aged women moving forward? Especially when it comes to sex, desire, and relationships?",

        "content": "is a senior politics reporter at Vox, where he covers the Democratic Party. He joined Vox in 2022 after reporting on national and international politics for the Atlantic’s politics, global, and ideas teams, including the role of Latino voters in the 2020 election.\n\nWhen Michelle Obama announced in March that she and her brother were starting a podcast, it dug up a familiar feeling for Democrats: yearning.\n\nIf only the uber-popular former first lady would just return to politics. She could just run for president, if she wanted.\n\nIt’s a recurring wish, for an Obama to save the Democratic Party. And like every time that chatter comes up, the dreamers were quickly let down. The podcast has avoided the political, and Obama herself has remained mostly out of the public eye, skipping high-profile public events and not commenting on news. She’s not alone. The party’s leaders of the past have also mostly remained silent as Donald Trump and Elon Musk challenge the law, remake the federal government, and implement the Trump 2.0 agenda.\n\nThis pining for Obama’s return isn’t new, but particularly during the second Trump term, it reflects something special about this moment: The Democratic Party still doesn’t have a clear leader, doesn’t have a clear direction of where to go, and keeps looking to the past for leadership.\n\nSome of that identity crisis is being fought out in public. Various governors are vying for the attention of voters pissed off at Trump and Republicans. They’re on podcasts and TV shows, at town halls and listening sessions. In Congress, they’re slowly figuring out how their constituents want them to resist Trump. And most notably, Sen. Bernie Sanders is wrapping up a multistate run of rallies against “oligarchy,” essentially anointing US Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York his movement’s successor in front of huge crowds.\n\nStill, none of these individuals seem to be uniting the party in the way the most loyal Democrats might wish for.\n\nBut that might be okay. If history can show us anything about what Democrats do now, it’s that opposition parties need this time without a clear leader to debate their identities, rebuild grassroots energy, and prepare for midterm elections. The Democrats’ savior isn’t coming any time soon. But that may be a feature, not a bug, of losing elections.\n\nDemocrats keep looking to the past for saviors\n\nThe hope for a great savior — either a veteran voice who can right the ship or an outsider who can rock it — might actually be an impediment as the Democrats figure themselves out. While a new guard of politicians and voices are still getting their footing or pushing for more influence, the “hero” they’re looking for won’t come around for a while — meaning the party should be using this time to rebuild and have these debates.\n\n“The very fact that Democrats are looking for a savior, seeking the man or woman on the white or black horse, is a sign that they’re not really doing what good political parties do, which is work at the grassroots, recruit people to run and make the case about why what Trump and Musk are doing is horrible,” Michael Kazin, the Georgetown University political historian who’s written an extensive history of the Democratic Party, told me.\n\nAsking for a Biden or Harris return is probably not the answer.\n\nThere are some trying to make this case. Some of the loudest remaining voices on the Democratic side remain members of the old guard — Sanders, for example, or Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who led many protests against Trump and the so-called Department of Government Efficiency’s attempts to downsize the federal government in the first few weeks of the Trump presidency. Neither are positioning themselves as the next leaders of the party, but Sanders, at least, seems to be setting the stage for a younger voice. He remains the most popular national figure, but the younger voices who could succeed him or chart out a new chapter for the party are not nearly as popular.\n\nThose younger voices — like California Gov. Gavin Newsom, former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, Connecticut Sen. Chris Murphy, or Ocasio-Cortez — are polarizing or still relatively unknown. They all represent different paths forward for the party. And they’re all trying out different approaches to tap into the anger that the average Democratic voter is feeling.\n\nAnd these divisions may actually end up being helpful: They’re setting the ground for a lively Democratic presidential primary contest in two to three years, they’re offering voters an idea of what the party could still become, and all represent a new vision for the party — even if the noise right now is about the party’s disunity. They also serve a midterm purpose as well: There not being a unified Democratic leader or agenda allows individual candidates to run their own, localized races without being pegged to one figure, as they tend to be during presidential election years, like when Biden was running. So embracing that chaos and disunity might actually be a good thing.\n\n“It’s a mistake to think you just have your preexisting set of people who’ve done it before, that one of them must be a savior. And frankly, right now, as opposed to in four years, the savior isn’t going to come from one single person. I’m not convinced that’s really how it works,” Julian Zelizer, a political history professor at Princeton University, told me. “The savior might be the congressional caucuses in the House and Senate acting effectively. The saviors might be independent groups, ACLU-type groups challenging [Trump] in court. But I think it’s more an organizational moment, and in a few years, you turn to the single individual. But I don’t think there’s a superhero who’s gonna fly in right now and just totally stop this. And thinking that way is probably not constructive for Democrats.”\n\nOf course, Democrats will still be pining for a hero, a new JFK or Obama to take on the mantle of the new Democratic Party. But there’s no easy way out of the current moment of crisis. The Obamas certainly won’t be the ones to resolve it. And wanting the figures of the past to return might actually be counterproductive.\n\nThis clamor has apparently made its way to the Bidens, who reportedly have offered to fundraise, campaign, and boost Democratic candidates this year and next. Kamala Harris, meanwhile, has remained quiet, while her more popular former running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, has instead embarked on an “I told you so” tour as he tests the waters for a third term as governor.\n\nBut asking for a Biden or Harris return is probably not the answer.\n\n“What good is it going to do? Is it going to convince anybody [for a former president or vice president to speak up]?” Kazin said. “It’s pretty common after the party who loses the election and obviously has no clear leader, for there to be a period where it’s not clear who the leaders are going to be. That happened in some ways, after 2004 as well. Going back in history, it happened in the 1920s a lot with Democrats not winning elections, it happened after losses in 1980 and 1984 and 1988 as well. So it takes a while for that to shake out. That’s not surprising.”",

Being rejected is seen as, at worst, an embarrassing personal failure, and, at best, an obstacle standing in the way of our hearts’ desires: a dream job, a thriving social circle, a first date with a gorgeous future partner. Last year, it dawned on me that I was actively avoiding rejection in my writing career in order to keep myself safe — and small. So I set my sights on denial.\n\nI dreamed up a project called November of NO and gathered an online group of 15 people to join me in my quest. “We’ll build resilience by inviting no’s into our lives, all in the pursuit of getting to yes,” my pitch went. The point was to make rejection itself the goalpost to reduce the fear and stickiness around it, and simultaneously get closer to our objectives. We set goals to eagerly get rejected from job applications, film grants, pitches (my personal goal as a freelance journalist), and other targets of our yearnings. Each week, we logged our attempts, rejections, and finally, any yeses we received.\n\nVox Culture Culture reflects society.

When I shifted my attention to rejection rather than success, it felt so much easier to do the work — my perfectionism-forward world was topsy-turvy, and getting a no was suddenly worth celebrating. By the end of the month, I had racked up seven rejections and landed three new editorial assignments.\n\nSera Bonds, a November of No group member who has long worked in nonprofit development, says she sent out around 80 total asks that month. It was also her first time tracking the number of rejections she received, even though rampant rejection has been a part of her work for 30 years.\n\n“I don’t take it personally when friends can’t hang out, or my teenagers say no,” she says. “A no is actually a yes to something else.”\n\n“I feel like about five years in, I really learned that there’s a critical mass of nos you have to get to get to the number of yeses you need, and it really has nothing to do with me,” Bonds says. “When I ask somebody for money, or I’m looking for a contract or a collaboration, most of the time the reason they say no is something on their end. So now I just trust it, and I don’t take it personally.”\n\nBond says that attitude has seeped into other parts of her life, too. “I don’t take it personally when friends can’t hang out, or my teenagers say no,” she says. “A no is actually a yes to something else.”\n\nLearning to see rejection as opportunity rather than failure can lead to more satisfaction in many aspects of life, from work and personal goals to dating and building strong relationships, experts say. And research has long shown that having high rejection sensitivity can mean developing low self-esteem; avoiding closeness in relationships, especially romantic ones; and is linked to a higher risk of other mental health issues such as anxiety and depression.\n\nPlus, failing, regrouping, and getting back up again builds resilience. As the adage goes, you miss every shot you don’t take — and even missed shots can help you take better aim.\n\nRyan C. Warner, a psychologist and consultant, trains his leadership and business clients to adopt a “rejection mindset,” which means learning to approach rejection rather than avoid it. “It’s teaching individuals to deliberately seek out situations where they may fail and, ultimately, that helps build confidence that they will succeed.”\n\n“That emotional pain that we experience from rejection gives our brains a signal: Hey, something’s wrong.”\n\nOur aversion to rejection is deeply rooted in evolutionary psychology, Warner says. Fitting into social groups helps ensure our survival, so we instinctively learned to avoid any behavior that caused a negative social reaction. Rejection triggers a response in the amygdala, the part of the brain that processes emotions as well as our “fight or flight” instinct.\n\n“That emotional pain that we experience from rejection gives our brains a signal: Hey, something’s wrong,” Warner says. “You need to react, or you need to avoid, so you don’t feel that pain anymore. … When this is constantly reinforced, it will ultimately recreate that fear of future rejection internally, [and lead to] avoidance.”\n\nSome neurodivergent people might experience rejection aversion even more acutely. Some 6 percent of American adults have ADHD, and people with ADHD can experience rejection sensitivity dysphoria (RSD), or intense emotional pain when faced with rejection.\n\nAnushka Basu, a 29-year-old finance writer based in India, was diagnosed with ADHD after experiencing extreme social anxiety during college, and later RSD, which she says starts subtle but, eventually, “freezes my body and mind.” It was a long process for Basu to learn how to better handle rejection, she says.\n\n“It starts with friends and family pointing out your shortcomings,” she wrote in an email. “Then, we go on to internalize it, and before we know it, it paralyzes us. So, in essence, we reject our own selves before anyone else.”\n\nHow to have a better relationship to rejection\n\nIt is possible for each of us to build more tolerance to rejection, and even to grow our self-confidence and self-acceptance as we do it. The key is to learn to understand “no” as a hallway to the next room rather than a closed door in your face — and that it’s not usually personal.\n\nHelping people with RSD conquer fear of rejection is a key part of the work that therapist Billy Roberts, founder of Focused Mind ADHD Counseling in Columbus, Ohio, does with his clients. “Ultimately, if someone tells you no, the default isn’t that they think you’re worthless or that they think you’re a bad person or not good enough,” Roberts says. “You’ve got to learn to manage your emotions so that you can put yourself out there again — and then eventually you win, because you’re putting yourself in situations where winning is a possibility.”\n\n1) Create rejection goals\n\nWarner recommends deciding on an aspect of your life you want to improve or change, then creating tangible goals. He finds the SMART framework helpful — that is, setting goals that are specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART). This means your goals are actually achievable and trackable over time, and you’ll know whether or not you hit them. For example, if you want to date more, you might set a SMART goal to go on five dates in the next three months, or meet five new people — which necessarily entails putting yourself out there more. Just make sure your goals are realistic.\n\n“I think it’s definitely effective for people, having measurable [goals] that you feel like you’re making progress toward,” Roberts says. “But people set themselves up and they’re like, ‘I’m going to apply for 100 jobs this week,’ and then they have a hard time taking action on that.”\n\nCarla Birnberg, an author who writes a newsletter about building habits for a successful life, first got more comfortable with rejection when she was shopping her book manuscript around 2000. “It definitely desensitized me to rejection,” she says. Now, she has a goal to get rejected as a podcast guest five times a week. “I would love to be on two podcasts a month, but I know five rejections a week is the only way to get there,” Birnberg says. “It brings me closer to that yes.”\n\nShe also uses people’s responses and feedback to refine her message, and hopefully get a higher response and approval rate as she goes along. “Rejections aren’t all the same,” she says.\n\n2) Reflect on your rejection hangups\n\nBoth meditation and journaling are easy and inexpensive ways to get to know yourself better, and have proven mental health benefits. They can also help you interrogate your response to rejection. “Ask yourself, ‘What are some times I may be rejecting myself?’” Warner says. You can also get guided support from a professional with therapy or counseling.\n\nWhen Basu realized she didn’t want to define herself through rejection, she began to analyze rejections in her journal, asking herself why each situation did not work out as she had hoped or expected. Then, she wrote down things she learned, what she could do differently next time, and how this rejection might change her future for good. She began to notice that some rejections weren’t personal, and took note of her own resilience.\n\n“In hindsight, I noticed moments where I thought rejection spelled the end, yet I ended up with something better down the line,” Basu says. “I started telling myself, ‘I am good enough.’ … Over time, I started to view rejection as a part of the process towards finding the right prospects. And I began looking at job applications as a numbers game. I knew that at least one would land if I kept at it. I started to view rejections as a need for redirection instead of failure.”\n\n3) Trust that rejection can get easier — and builds confidence\n\nThe catch-22 of rejection is that you have to experience it, recover, and try, try again to “get that positive feedback loop going,” Roberts says. The more rejections you sail through, the easier it will get, and, eventually, the more you’ll discover that risk, and even straight up rejection, does reap rewards.\n\nRoberts wants to remind people that “action comes before healing,” meaning it’s only through repeatedly being rejected, processing your emotions, and moving forward that you will eventually have a reduction in anxiety around rejection.",

Seasonal allergies are the body’s response to pollen from trees and grass; the immune system releases chemicals, like histamines, leukotrienes, and prostaglandins, which cause all those uncomfortable, familiar symptoms.\n\nThe best way to combat the unpleasant barrage is to get ahead of them, says Russell Leftwich, a fellow at the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology and an adjunct assistant professor of biomedical informatics at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine. Since allergy season arrives at roughly the same time every year, Leftwich recommends starting your allergy relief of choice for a few days before pollen levels get too high. (The Weather Channel, AccuWeather, and IQAir provide local pollen monitoring.)\n\nIf the dizzying variety of drugs at the pharmacy has you confused, here are a few things to know about the most effective types of over-the-counter allergy medications as well as non-pharmaceutical ways to keep your allergies in check.\n\nToday, Explained Understand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins. Email (required) Sign Up By submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice . This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.\n\nBefore heading to the drugstore\n\nOne of the best ways to alleviate allergy symptoms is to prevent pollen from getting into your body in the first place. This means keeping windows closed and wearing a mask while doing yard work, Leftwich says. If you’ve been outdoors for a while, change your clothes and wash your face when you get home, says Rita Kachru, the chief of allergy and immunology in the department of medicine at UCLA.\n\nRelated 4 tips for dealing with a ferocious allergy season\n\nAnother prevention method includes rinsing your nose with a saline solution: a mixture of baking soda, salt, and distilled or boiled water, Kachru says. The American Academy of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology recommends mixing three tablespoons of iodide-free salt with one teaspoon of baking soda in a small container. Then add one teaspoon of the salt/baking soda mixture to eight ounces of lukewarm distilled or boiled water. You can also buy nasal saline sprays at the drugstore.\n\nWhen to take antihistamines\n\nWhen avoidance strategies aren’t totally effective, you can treat your symptoms with over-the-counter allergy medications. One of the major categories of these treatments are antihistamines, which are available in pill, tablet, eye drop, or nasal spray forms.\n\nAntihistamines help reduce itchiness and sneezing and are your first line of defense, Kachru says. “The reason I always start with an antihistamine is because you may just have a day of a high pollen count,” she says, “and you just need a one-time antihistamine because you’re sneezing and you’re itchy and you’re a little congested.”\n\nKachru and Leftwich suggest opting for long-acting antihistamines — like loratadine (Claritin), cetirizine (Zyrtec), or fexofenadine (Allegra) — over short-acting ones. People can develop a resistance to short-acting antihistamines, like diphenhydramine (Benadryl), very quickly. Plus, Benadryl often makes people sleepy.\n\nBoth short- and long-acting antihistamines provide relief within 15 to 30 minutes, Kachru says. Take them at the start of the day before you are exposed to pollen.\n\nFor mild nose itchiness and sneezing, an antihistamine nasal spray, like azelastine (Astepro), might work for you. A common side effect is a metallic taste in the back of the throat, Kachru says.\n\nWhen to try nasal steroid sprays\n\nIf you’re reaching for an antihistamine three to four times a week, Kachru suggests adding a nasal steroid into the mix. Not only do nasal steroids reduce sneezing and itchiness, but they’ll help with congestion, too. These include fluticasone (Flonase), budesonide (Benacort), triamcinolone (Nasacort), and mometasone (Nasonex). Nasal steroids do take a few days until you feel the full effects, Kachru says, so don’t give up if you don’t feel better right away.\n\nTo properly administer nasal sprays, insert the tip in your nostril and point it toward your ear. A common mistake when using a nasal spray is pointing it straight up your nose. “It goes up their nose, down their throat and does nothing for them,” Kachru says. “Or they stick it inwards into their nose, and then they get nosebleeds. … So you want to always make sure that when you put it in, you point it out towards your ear, spray, sniff in, and then do the alternate nostril.”\n\nWhile not a nasal steroid, Kachru advises against using oxymetazoline (Afrin), a nasal spray decongestant. “Patients who use Afrin regularly end up having really, really severe rebound nasal congestion,” she says.\n\nLeftwich advises against decongestants more broadly, as the over-the-counter decongestant medications are not very effective.\n\nAfter a few weeks of daily nasal spray use, you may consider stopping an antihistamine, if you’re taking both. “That’s usually what I tell people to do,” Kachru says. “Eventually just use that antihistamine as needed” because the nasal spray is more effective.",

He received a JD from Duke University and is the author of two books on the Supreme Court.\n\nIn mid-March, President Donald Trump invoked an almost-never-used federal law, claiming that it gives him the power to deport many immigrants at will with minimal or no legal process to determine if these deportations are lawful. The text of that statute, the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, does not give presidents the power Trump claims.\n\nFor the moment, at least, a lower court order blocks Trump’s Alien Enemies Act proclamation; that order is still in effect, although there is ongoing litigation about whether the Trump administration defied it by sending dozens of Venezuelan immigrants to a prison in El Salvador after the lower court ordered the planes carrying these immigrants to be turned around.\n\nSCOTUS, Explained Get the latest developments on the US Supreme Court from senior correspondent Ian Millhiser. Email (required) Sign Up By submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice . This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.\n\nNow Trump wants the Supreme Court to halt the lower court order and effectively allow him to resume deportations without any meaningful review, and without having to prove the immigrants targeted by his proclamation have actually done anything wrong. The case, which is known as Trump v. J.G.G., is before the Court on its “shadow docket,” a mix of emergency motions and other matters which the justices often decide after only cursory review of the case. A decision on the case could come any time in the next few weeks.\n\nIn J.G.G., Trump’s lawyers make three arguments that, when combined, would give him virtually unchecked authority to remove any noncitizen from the United States.\n\nFirst, Trump claims the unprecedented authority to invoke the Alien Enemies Act during peacetime, and against a nonstate actor — in this case, Tren de Aragua, a criminal gang that originated in Venezuela. That law, which does give the president sweeping authority to remove foreign nationals when properly invoked, only applies during a “declared war between the United States and any foreign nation or government,” or during a military “invasion or predatory incursion” of the United States.\n\nCongress — the only branch of government that can declare war — has not declared war on Venezuela, and the alleged presence of civilian criminals in the United States is not a military operation. Also, the Alien Enemies Act only applies to military actions by a “foreign nation or government.” Tren de Aragua is not its own nation, nor does it control the government of Venezuela.\n\nSecond, Trump’s lawyers argue that the immigrants challenging his proclamation may only bring their case in Texas federal court, under a legal procedure known as a “habeas” proceeding, which typically can only be used by a single individual to challenge their own detention.\n\nThat matters for two reasons. Federal cases brought in Texas appeal to the US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, a far-right court that routinely interprets the law in creative ways to benefit right-wing causes and the Republican Party, something likely to put anyone trying to stop a deportation at a disadvantage. Additionally, if challenges can only be brought on an individual basis, it may no longer be possible to obtain a broad court order blocking his entire proclamation.\n\nThird, even if an immigrant targeted by Trump could convince the Fifth Circuit to shield them from deportation, they are unlikely to ever get that chance. As Judge Patricia Millett, one of four lower court judges who’s already heard the J.G.G. case, explains, the administration’s position is that once Trump’s proclamation goes into effect “it can immediately resume removal flights without affording Plaintiffs notice of the grounds for their removal or any opportunity to call a lawyer, let alone to file a writ of habeas corpus or obtain any review of their legal challenges to removal.”\n\nRelated The Trumpiest court in America\n\nIf the Court were to accept this third argument, Trump would be able to deport people so quickly that, by the time a lawyer or judge learns they were deported, it will be too late to do anything about it.\n\nTrump’s peacetime invocation of the Alien Enemies Act is illegal\n\nThe Alien Enemies Act has only been invoked three times in American history: during the War of 1812 and during both world wars. In all three instances, Congress had formally declared war.\n\nIt’s likely that presidents have been reluctant to use this power in the past, even during other wars, because the authority provided by the Alien Enemies Act is extraordinarily draconian. When properly invoked, the law permits the federal government to arrest, detain, and remove “all natives, citizens, denizens, or subjects of the hostile nation or government, being of the age of fourteen years and upward, who shall be within the United States and not actually naturalized.” So during a declared war with Germany, the president may order nearly all German citizens removed from the United States, regardless of whether those German nationals took any aggressive or criminal action whatsoever.\n\nTrump now claims that he can use this law during peacetime to target alleged members of Tren de Aragua.\n\nEven setting aside the fact that the Alien Enemies Act only applies to foreign nations or governments — and Tren de Aragua is neither — there appears to be no legal authority whatsoever supporting Trump’s claim that this law can be used against a foreign gang engaged in ordinary criminal activity.\n\nIn its brief to the justices, the Trump administration claims that Tren de Aragua’s alleged presence in the United States constitutes a “predatory incursion” under the Alien Enemies Act. But the only source Trump’s lawyers cite to support this claim is a 1945 trial court decision that quotes President John Tyler (who became president in 1841) using the term “predatory incursion” to refer to military raids during a war between Mexico and the then-Republic of Texas.\n\nSo this 1945 opinion offers no support for the proportion that a “predatory incursion” can be committed by civilians during peacetime. And, in any event, it’s notable that the only legal source Trump’s lawyers could come up with is an 80-year-old decision by a single, low-ranking judge.\n\nThe J.G.G. plaintiffs’ brief, by contrast, quotes from numerous founding era dictionaries and other historical documents that use this term exclusively to refer to a military raid, including a letter from George Washington to Thomas Jefferson, which used “predatory incursion” to refer to a British raid on American military supplies in Virginia.\n\nTrump’s proclamation, in other words, relies on a wholly novel interpretation of the Alien Enemies Act, one that posits it can be used in peacetime, despite what the text of the law says. And his lawyers did not find any support whatsoever for this new interpretation in over 200 years of American legal history.\n\nTrump’s attempts to cut off judicial review are also meritless\n\nPerhaps recognizing that its interpretation of the Alien Enemies Act is unprecedented, the Trump administration spends the bulk of its J.G.G. brief raising procedural objections to the lower court’s order blocking Trump’s proclamation, particularly its claim that this proclamation can only be challenged in habeas proceedings in Texas.\n\nHabeas proceedings typically must be brought in the jurisdiction where the prisoner is held. The Trump administration incarcerated the J.G.G. plaintiffs in Texas, so it claims that their suits must be brought in Texas federal court.\n\nHowever, habeas proceedings are a way — often the only way — for someone in federal prison to challenge their detention. And the plaintiffs in J.G.G. do not challenge the government’s ability to detain them while a valid removal case against them proceeds. They simply challenge the Trump administration’s attempt to remove them without due process under the Alien Enemies Act. And the Supreme Court has held that habeas is not the right remedy when a plaintiff does not challenge their detention.\n\nAs the Court said in Skinner v. Switzer (2011), there is no case “in which the Court has recognized habeas as the sole remedy, or even an available one, where the relief sought would ‘neither terminat[e] custody, accelerat[e] the future date of release from custody, nor reduc[e] the level of custody.’”\n\nThat decision means Trump’s attempt to shunt any challenge to his proclamation into individual legal proceedings, where the individuals bringing those proceedings can be deported before they can even speak to their lawyers, should have no merit. If one of the J.G.G. plaintiffs also want to challenge their detention, that case may need to be brought in Texas, but the Trump administration’s attempt to shut down a broader challenge to the Alien Enemies Act proclamation cannot be squared with Supreme Court precedent.\n\nAdditionally, a different federal immigration law cuts against Trump’s claim that immigrants challenging the Alien Enemies Act proclamation must be brought in individual habeas suits. The Immigration and Nationality Act generally provides that it lays out “the sole and exclusive procedure for determining whether an alien may be … removed from the United States.”\n\nThis law, moreover, gives immigrants a variety of procedural rights, such as the right to claim asylum. It does permit expedited proceedings against some immigrants, including those that commit serious felonies, but even those noncitizens are entitled to notice and a hearing before they are removed from the country. And this law undercuts the administration’s argument that it can summarily deport people.\n\nOf course, any legal analysis of any Supreme Court case involving Trump must come with a caveat. This is the same Court that ruled over the summer that Trump can use the powers of the presidency to commit crimes, so there is no guarantee that these justices will follow existing law.",

Senators recognized by the presiding officer can speak indefinitely, “usually cannot be forced to cede the floor, or even be interrupted”…but “must remain standing and must speak more or less continuously,” according to the Congressional Research Service.\n\nBut Booker’s address isn’t a filibuster — there’s no legislation that he’s trying to hold up. Instead, it’s a form of political theater and protest against the Trump administration. And it comes at a time when overwhelming shares of his party’s membership think their elected leaders aren’t putting up a tough enough fight to resist Donald Trump’s agenda. About two-thirds of Democratic voters would prefer their leaders “stick to their positions even if this means not getting things done in Washington” a March NBC News poll found.\n\nThis kind of show of political force, at least, has been what top Democrats were saying when warning about Trump on the campaign trail last year.\n\nThey would prefer congressional leadership use whatever tools they have available to slow down the administration’s work: One recent poll, for example, even found that about three-quarters of Democratic and Democratic-leaning independent voters support the idea of “using procedural tactics like the filibuster to prevent Republican bills from passing.”\n\nStill, attention-grabbing moments like these aren’t guaranteed to have staying power. It’s far too early to tell whether Booker is galvanizing a lasting opposition as he might have hoped, or whether this will be drowned out by another Trump story. Still, it’s feeding the Democratic base’s hunger for (any kind of) Trump resistance — as he overruns traditional checks on his power.\n\nThat’s not easy to do when you’re locked out of power, so Booker’s gamble is yet the latest attempt of Democrats trying to figure out how to fight back.\n\nBooker’s speech started on Monday evening, when he announced he would be “speaking as long as he is physically able to lift the voices of Americans who are being harmed and not being heard in this moment of crisis.”\n\n“These are not normal times in our nation,” he said. “And they should not be treated as such in the United States Senate.”\n\nSince then, he’s only stopped to allow the Senate chaplain to deliver a traditional prayer at noon, and to allow fellow Democratic senators to ask him questions and give him a bit of a rest. Yet he has remained standing, and only taken a couple drinks of water. He’s already entered the top rankings of the longest Senate speeches delivered. (Only one other sitting senator, Republican Ted Cruz of Texas, has delivered a longer address, when trying unsuccessfully to defund the Affordable Care Act.)\n\nThis kind of show of political force, at least, has been what top Democrats were saying when warning about Trump on the campaign trail last year. Yet many in the Democratic base have felt like since Trump entered office, their leaders weren’t acting with that kind of urgency. Poll after poll shows that the Democratic rank and file feel adrift, leaderless, and dissatisfied.\n\nThat fury intensified last month, when Democrats voted for a GOP-brokered spending bill to keep the government open. The thinking at the time was that a shutdown would do more harm than good, but many in the party’s base saw it as an unforgivable cave.\n\nBooker’s speech is an attempt to try something else. And whether or not it works, it’s something different.\n\nUpdate, April 1, 2025, 7:45 pm: This story was originally published earlier in the day and has been updated to reflect that Booker has been speaking for 24 straight hours.\n\n\n\n",

        "content": "is a senior reporter for Vox’s Future Perfect section, with a focus on animal welfare and the future of meat.\n\nAt midnight one day in spring 2023, a team of animal rights investigators decked out in biosecurity gear snuck onto a massive chicken farm on Maryland’s Eastern Shore, an hour and a half drive from Baltimore. The operation was raising some 75,000 birds for Mountaire Farms, the nation’s fourth-largest chicken company.\n\nWhen investigator Joseph Allman entered one of the facility’s sprawling barns, he found chickens packed wall to wall, including three dead, decaying birds. The place smelled “awful and noxious,” he said, and as he waded through the barn’s “blanket of chickens,” Allman found plenty more dead animals. Right outside the barn, Allman told me recently, there was a massive pile of manure “completely littered with dead bodies and body parts.”\n\nOver the following year, the investigators returned to the farm and also visited another operation in the area raising birds for Mountaire, where they found similar conditions. In January, Sherstin Rosenberg — a veterinarian who reviewed the footage — wrote that there were multiple birds “unable to reach food or water due to severe limb deformity and disease, or because they are stuck on their backs and unable to get up.” Several dead birds, the footage showed, had been “left to decompose for days to weeks,” according to Rosenberg.\n\nThe investigators also obtained a trove of inspection documents from two Mountaire Farms slaughterhouses through a Freedom of Information Act request, which revealed instances of birds being scalded alive, buried alive, suffocated to death, amputated, diseased, and contaminated with feces.\n\nBonnie Klapper, a former assistant US attorney, reviewed the investigators’ footage and wrote an opinion in January arguing that the conditions documented constitute criminal animal cruelty under Maryland state law. The activists have sent Klapper’s opinion and Rosenberg’s veterinary analysis to a number of county and state authorities requesting an investigation into the company and charges for animal cruelty. They haven’t received much interest.\n\nMountaire alleges that early one morning in mid-February, Allman and his colleague Adam Durand posed as AT&T contractors to gain access to a Mountaire slaughterhouse in Delaware. They were later arrested for criminal impersonation — a charge that was soon dropped — and trespassing, to which they agreed to a plea deal to remove the charge from their records in exchange for one year of no contact with Mountaire, Allman told me. Mountaire sued the two in early March for trespassing.\n\n“This lawsuit isn’t about protecting their business — it’s about silencing whistleblowers,” Allman wrote to me in response to the lawsuit. Durand declined to comment on the lawsuit.\n\nMountaire Farms declined an interview request for this story, but emailed a statement to Vox. The company said it requires its contract farmers to “follow sound poultry management practices that conform to practices of good animal husbandry and animal welfare.” Mountaire declined to comment further on the allegations lodged by Allman and his fellow investigators.\n\nA chicken in poor health, at a farm raising animals for Mountaire, who the investigators believe later died. Joseph Allman A chicken on their back unable to get up. Many chickens have difficulty walking due to industry breeding practices, and some die of dehydration or starvation if they can’t reach food or water. Joseph Allman\n\nHowever grisly the investigation into Mountaire’s operations was, they’re far from unusual. At US chicken factory farms, overcrowded, unhygienic conditions are so common that 6 percent of the nation’s 9 billion chickens raised for meat — chickens that have been bred to be unhealthily large — die on the farm each year before they can even be trucked to the slaughterhouse. That adds up to more than half a billion unnecessary deaths.\n\nThe alleged conditions on Mountaire’s chicken facilities show one of the major ills of the factory farming system in the US, one shared by other companies in the industry: an almost willful disregard for the welfare of the animals they raise. But Mountaire also demonstrates to a greater extent than any other poultry company a less widely known way in which the factory farming system’s tentacles work their way into American life: the industry’s ties to a right-wing, deregulatory political agenda.\n\nWhile Republican politicians and meat companies have long been intertwined — almost 80 percent of the industry’s political contributions in the 2024 election cycle went to Republicans — Mountaire and its wealthy but little-known CEO Ronald Cameron show just how deep those ties can go. Cameron, who at times has been a top donor to President Donald Trump, far outspends others in the poultry industry in an apparent effort to bend US politics toward his hard-right beliefs, and seemingly to protect and expand a poultry empire that produces roughly 1 out of every 13 chickens consumed in America today, even if relatively few people have ever heard of it.\n\nProcessing Meat A newsletter analyzing how the meat and dairy industries impact everything around us.

This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.\n\nHow Mountaire Farms has fueled a right-wing business and political agenda\n\nIn 2016, Cameron and his wife gave millions to Trump-aligned PACs, which made him one of the biggest donors to Trump. Across the 2020 and 2024 election cycles, Cameron gave another $4.7 million.\n\nCameron has also contributed to several current and former House Freedom Caucus members and far-right Senate candidates, as well as over $14 million to political action committees (PACs) linked to the Koch Brothers and over $2 million to PACs operated by the Club for Growth.\n\nAll told, Cameron has given around $75 million to candidates, PACs, and state parties since 2014 — over 99 percent of it to Republicans — making him one of the 50 biggest political contributors in recent election cycles.\n\nWhile the direction of Cameron’s dollars isn’t unusual in the meat industry, the scale of giving dwarfs that of his competitors. Since 1990, the largest chicken companies have given — through their employees — anything from tens of thousands to a few million dollars each, with similar spending in direct lobbying. (Mountaire, it should be noted, doesn’t spend on lobbying at all.) The only company that comes close is Tyson Foods, which has spent $35 million on lobbying since 1998 and whose employees have given approximately $7.7 million to political candidates and organizations since 1990. However, Tyson Foods is a much bigger company than Mountaire, with 20 times the annual revenue. It’s a top producer of beef and pork, too.\n\nAll the while, according to Glassdoor salary reporting, Mountaire Farms’ frontline slaughterhouse employees make minimum wage or slightly above it to perform one of the most dangerous jobs in America. Mountaire workers have accused the company of retaliation, discrimination, denial of bathroom breaks, union-busting, wage-fixing, and exposure to harmful chemicals. In 2020, an employee interviewed by the New Yorker called the work “slavery.” Mountaire did not respond to Vox for a request for comment about allegations made by its employees.\n\nAn aerial photo, taken by drone, above a wastewater treatment operation at a Mountaire Farms slaughterhouse in Delaware. Joseph Allman\n\nThe company has also been accused of creating severe environmental pollution. In 2021, Mountaire agreed to a historic $205 million deal to settle a lawsuit alleging that one of its slaughterhouses had contaminated the drinking water and air quality of nearby residents. “While Mountaire does not believe that it caused any damage to any of the plaintiffs, it chose to settle the case in order to achieve a final resolution and to allow construction of a new wastewater treatment plant to proceed,” the company said in a statement at the time.\n\nEnvironmental pollution is a consistent problem for the meat industry, and Cameron’s political generosity has coincided with beneficial political action for Mountaire on exactly that subject.\n\nIn Maryland, where corporations are restricted from giving political candidates large sums of money, Mountaire funneled $250,000 into the Republican Governors Association days before the 2014 election, which it spent on ads to elect Republican Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan.\n\nOn Inauguration Day, Hogan rescinded regulations pertaining to how much animal manure can be spread onto crop fields as fertilizer — a notorious source of water pollution on Maryland’s Eastern Shore, where Allman and his colleagues investigated Mountaire chicken operations. Weeks later, Hogan proposed a watered-down version with a loophole for the poultry industry. A spokesperson for Hogan told the Wall Street Journal that Hogan “had no knowledge of [Mountaire’s] involvement with the Republican Governors Association.”\n\nIn the middle of April 2020, Trump picked Cameron to serve as an economic adviser to the White House on its strategy to reopen parts of the economy in the early stages of the Covid-19 pandemic. Two weeks later, Trump signed an executive order mandating that slaughterhouses remain open to their extent possible, even as they became Covid hot spots — including Mountaire slaughterhouses.\n\nThat same day, the Department of Labor issued a statement that essentially immunized meat companies from being held accountable if they didn’t adhere to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Covid-19 guidelines so long as they had at least demonstrated a “good faith” effort to do so. Around the same time, the US Department of Agriculture permitted 15 slaughterhouses — including one of Mountaire’s — to speed up their slaughter lines from 140 birds per minute to 175.\n\nWhy the meat industry gives so much to Republicans\n\nMountaire may stand out in the size of its contributions to right-wing politicians and groups, but the broader meat and dairy industry gives overwhelmingly to Republicans.\n\nThe industry’s political favoritism can be explained in part by geography; animal agriculture is concentrated in rural states where politicians are much more likely to be Republican. But it can also be explained in part by ideology; congressional Republicans tend to prefer deregulation, which benefits meat, dairy, and egg companies.\n\nCameron and his company — along with his competitors — benefit from deregulation at each link in the supply chain that Congress and regulatory agencies could change but don’t. Poultry farms are exempt from numerous animal welfare laws and are largely exempt from key environmental laws. The Department of Labor, across Republican and Democrat administrations, has failed to keep slaughterhouse abuses in check. A lot of the farmers that raise chickens for big poultry companies get screwed over, too.\n\nBut while Republicans may financially benefit disproportionately from the industry’s largesse, Democrats tend to be anything but tough on the meat industry.\n\n“While conservatives have consistently pushed more aggressive, pro-agribusiness policies,” food policy expert Nathan Rosenberg and journalist Bryce Wilson Stucki wrote in a 2017 story for The Counter, “liberals have often responded with pro-agribusiness policies of their own, even when that meant undermining their own natural allies: small and mid-sized farmers, farm workers, rural minority populations, and the small, independent businesses they support.” I saw that reality myself when I wrote last year about the cozy relationship between the meat industry and Tim Walz, the governor of Minnesota and Kamala Harris’s VP pick.\n\nAlexandra Paul, who led the investigation into Mountaire Farms, rescues a chicken. Joseph Allman Leah, a rescued chicken, steps onto grass for the first time. Alexandra Paul, who led the investigation into Mountaire Farms, described the experience of witnessing Leah’s first steps as “magical.” Joseph Allman\n\nThere’s no clear path to breaking the meat industry’s grip over American politics on the horizon, but there is something anyone can do — starting today — to push back against the kinds of horrific allegations made against Mountaire and other poultry giants: Eat less chicken.\n\nIn 2022, the US raised and slaughtered a record-breaking 9.2 billion of them — 24 per person after accounting for poultry exports. Chicken may be branded as a healthier, more sustainable alternative to beef and pork, but its mass production and consumption — whether from Mountaire or its competitors — relies on unimaginable human and animal suffering.\n\n“We’re up against a really big system that seems really entrenched right now,” said Durand, one of the activists, “and we are just trying to do whatever we can to disrupt that.”\n\nCorrection, April 1, 11 am ET: A previous version of this story misdescribed the health status of a chicken in a photo caption. The caption has been updated.\n\n",

        "content": "President Donald Trump unveiled his tariff plans on Wednesday, April 2, during a ceremony at the White House, imposing tariffs of at least 10 percent on all foreign-made goods. For products made in China, the tariff rate will be 34 percent; for those made in Vietnam, it will be 46 percent; for the European Union, it will be 20 percent. Trump framed these tariffs as “reciprocal,” meaning that that they match the level of trade restrictions that each foreign nation imposes on US products. But this is not true — Trump’s tariffs greatly exceed those of America’s targeted trade partners.\n\nTrump has already imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum made outside the US, all products made in Canada or Mexico, all Chinese goods, and all foreign-made cars, among other things, claiming these moves will strengthen the economy long-term while downplaying concern they’ll lead to a recession.\n\nThe threat of tariffs have led to massive economic uncertainty, with Trump’s on-again, off-again declarations tanking stock markets and souring consumer sentiment, though some longtime critics of globalization appear optimistic. Meanwhile, many Americans are worried and confused — tariffs haven’t been as significant to the US economy in nearly a century — and they’re understandably unsure about what tariffs are, how they’ll affect their wallets, why governments would implement them, and whether the president’s policy will work on its own terms.",

Joseph Prezioso/AFP/Getty Images\n\nTens of thousands of federal workers have been fired recently, and more may be in danger of being let go.\n\nUmair Irfan — a climate change, energy policy, and science correspondent for Vox — has been specifically focused on layoffs looming over the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) of late. His reporting presents a great lens for understanding the firings, and he and I discussed what the NOAA can tell us about the effect federal reductions have on everyday Americans. Our conversation, edited for length and clarity, is below.\n\nUmair, what’s NOAA and why is it so important?\n\nNOAA is the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. It’s tasked with developing weather forecasts for the United States, conducting oceanographic and atmospheric research, and developing long-term climate and weather models. It’s also in charge of fisheries and promoting commerce, particularly in the oceans, which means it does a lot of navigation and mapping work for shipping, and for offshore oil and gas drilling.\n\nThere have been reports that as much as half of NOAA staff might be dismissed. What would everyday Americans lose if that happened?\n\nNOAA has a staff of about 12,000 people, most of them scientists and engineers. If you lost half of that, you’d lose a lot of people doing the research that informs our weather forecasts and our understanding of weather, as well as a lot of the data that industry players rely on for things like aviation and air travel. We’d also lose a lot of our emergency forecasting capability for extreme weather.\n\nNOAA is one of the reasons that air travel is so safe, and one of the reasons that we’ve seen fewer people dying in natural disasters in the US: It has done the work of putting satellites into space, of having scientific ships on the ocean, and aircraft that fly into hurricanes, and has used its decades of data gathering to develop excellent forecasting capability — and one that, through continual work, is improving all the time.\n\nIf we lose all those capabilities, we lose a lot of progress that has been made. Extreme weather will stay dangerous, however, and our ability to drive the risks involved with weather down over time will eventually diminish if we don’t continue to invest in that.\n\nNOAA obviously isn’t the only agency that’s facing cuts here. Do Americans gain anything by shrinking the government the way Trump has been?\n\nCurrent and former agency staffers and leaders I talked to say the cuts aren’t going to help agencies accomplish their missions, and will actually run counter to any goals of efficiency, because remaining employees will have to try to fulfill the functions of their fired colleagues in suboptimal ways.\n\nThat said, there’s always going to be room to optimize a big institution like the government. But we need to do so thoughtfully, stepping back and seeing what our needs are, and what our expectations are from government in general.\n\nSpecifically looking at an agency like NOAA, it’s about looking carefully at exactly how its core functions are being met, where they’re falling short, and where they can be augmented. So far, we really haven’t seen that level of exploration and interest in how these agencies function from the current administration.\n\nBig picture, what do you think Americans should learn from the case of NOAA?\n\nI think it’s easy to forget that the federal government is everywhere in our country — 80 percent of federal employees are not in DC.\n\nNOAA is one of those agencies that has a very far-flung footprint, because it has to do a lot of the local research and data gathering on site, and because its mission is to protect the whole country.\n\nAnd NOAA, like all agencies, is very closely linked to people’s lives in ways they may not expect. You may not have a NOAA app on your phone, but very likely the weather app you do have, and the forecast that you’re getting from your local TV meteorologist, are informed by NOAA’s satellites and data gathering.\n\nWhile there may be layers in between the products you consume and the government, it does provide the foundation for things we take for granted. If agencies like NOAA go away, we would definitely lose things we might not expect.\n\nRelated Elon Musk is coming for our weather service",

        "content": "is a senior correspondent and head writer for Vox’s Future Perfect section and has worked at Vox since 2014. He is particularly interested in global health and pandemic prevention, anti-poverty efforts, economic policy and theory, and conflicts about the right way to do philanthropy.\n\nThe day this article goes up, April 2, has been pegged by President Donald Trump as “Liberation Day”: the day his suite of tariffs will go into effect and thus, in some unspecified sense, liberate the United States.\n\nThe pre-history of this disastrous set of policies, which will only make America poorer and alienate it from its closest allies, is as long and weird as you’d expect from Trump. Part of the story seems to involve him losing an auction in 1988 for a piano used in Casablanca to a Japanese collector, thus confirming that Japan was an economic threat. Sure, fine, that seems par for the course with this guy.\n\nBut if you want to understand why not only Trump but now large parts of both parties have reoriented themselves to support tariffs, I think the key text is not Casablanca but a 2013 paper by David Autor, David Dorn, and Gordon Hanson that’s almost as famous (among economists, at least). If you follow economic research at all, you know this as the “China shock” paper.\n\nThis story was first featured in the Future Perfect newsletter. Sign up here to explore the big, complicated problems the world faces and the most efficient ways to solve them. Sent twice a week.\n\nThe authors found that the surge of US manufacturing imports from China between 1991 and 2007 led to large job losses in the US manufacturing sector, losses that were concentrated in a few particular geographic locations. Areas affected saw wages fall for a surprisingly long time, and uptake of government benefit programs like unemployment and disability insurance.\n\nThe DC think tank world’s understanding of this finding was sweeping: Free trade didn’t work. Bipartisan advocates like Bill Clinton and George W. Bush had promised that deals like permanent normal trade relations or NAFTA would be win-win propositions, when in reality they hollowed out American manufacturing.\n\nAfter Trump won in 2016 on a fiercely anti-trade platform, aided by support in China shock-affected states like Wisconsin and Michigan, many Democrats saw the implication as obvious: It was time to turn their backs on trade, as a matter of political survival if nothing else.\n\nIf you actually read the China shock literature you will notice that the authors do not come to any conclusions remotely this broad. The conclusions they do reach, though, can help us understand why Trump’s particular policy response will be so damaging.\n\nIt’s the “shock” — not the “China”\n\nReading the original China shock paper and its follow-ups, something that sticks out is how little the literature is about trade policy per se. Autor, Dorn, and Hanson are clear that the shock came not just from changing US policy toward China, but from China’s massive increase in manufacturing productivity during this period.\n\nThat means the employment losses in certain areas weren’t solely due to the US loosening barriers, but also to changes within China that US policy couldn’t alter.\n\nThe authors are equally clear that trade wasn’t the sole driver of declining manufacturing employment. They estimate that the China shock was responsible for about a quarter of the decline in manufacturing jobs over the period they study.\n\nThat’s significant, for sure, but also underlines how much other factors — like labor-saving technologies in the sector, or consumers shifting demand toward services — were behind the hollowing-out of old factory towns. Even if China had stayed poor and not become a major exporter, the US still would have rapidly lost manufacturing jobs, just not quite as many.\n\nI’d be remiss if I didn’t mention that many researchers have found that Chinese imports have, overall, made Americans better off. That includes Autor, Dorn, and Hanson, who concluded that the gains to consumers from cheaper goods were somewhat larger than the employment losses.\n\nThat doesn’t mean the concentrated hurt from the China shock was okay. Clearly the US should have done a better job of helping affected regions transition to a more competitive economy.\n\nBut simply not doing the China shock, even if that had been possible, would not have made the US better off as a whole. Nor would adding tariffs now, some 15 years after the China shock ended, do any good. Follow-up work by the team on the Trump tariffs during his first term found that they reduced US employment overall by inviting foreign retaliation.\n\nRather than a jeremiad against free trade, it’s better to understand the China shock literature as explaining what happens when a specific region takes a big economic hit — whether due to imports or something else.\n\nAutor has compared it to the losses West Virginia suffered as the US transitioned away from coal. “The forward-looking lesson is not about how we contend with manufacturing competition,” Autor told an interviewer in 2021. “It is not even [only] about trade per se, but about adjustment for unemployed workers and hard-hit areas. How costly it is, how slow it is, and how we can make it work better.”\n\nIt’s not the “China” part that’s crucial: It’s the “shock.”\n\nMaybe don’t do another shock for no reason?\n\nTrump’s suite of tariffs are, obviously, not going to bring manufacturing back to the US in any meaningful way. But they’re certainly shocking.\n\nThey’ve introduced massive uncertainty to international trade and to supply chains that cross borders, like the deeply integrated Michigan-Ontario auto sector. They’ve forced manufacturers and retailers that depend on imports as inputs or sales items to scramble to adjust.\n\nThis exact dynamic, this kind of massive economic shift imposed with little time to prepare or adjust, is what made the China shock so painful for certain regions. The tariff shock, far from undoing the effects of the China shock, could simply replicate its worst aspects, just without the corresponding benefit in terms of economic growth and cheaper goods.\n\nThe Trump team, as Paul Krugman observed during the first trade war, is acting like “a motorist who runs over a pedestrian, then tries to fix the damage by backing up — and runs over the victim a second time.”\n\nIt’s not yet clear if the damage will be as economically concentrated as the China shock was. Large-scale government layoffs and contract cancellations are threatening a localized DC recession, and tariffs on Canada and Mexico would disproportionately hurt border states, but the damage of higher prices and job losses from tariffs will be felt broadly across the whole country.\n\nSince part of the reason the China shock garnered so much attention was its concentration in presidential swing states, this might make the tariff shock less politically motivating.\n\nBut in just about every aspect, the tariff shock is worse than the China shock. The China shock made prices cheaper for most Americans — all those cheap appliances and toys — but the tariff shock will raise prices. The China shock was concentrated in the manufacturing sector, and manufacturing-heavy regions; the tariff shock will affect many sectors.\n\nPerhaps worst of all, where the China shock was largely unavoidable, the tariff shock is entirely self-inflicted. It’s being chosen by US policymakers, against the interests of their constituents and allied nations. They could just as easily not do it at all. It’s an act of economic national suicide the likes of which the US hasn’t seen in decades.",

She writes primarily about the future of consciousness, tracking advances in artificial intelligence and neuroscience and their staggering ethical implications. Before joining Vox, Sigal was the religion editor at the Atlantic.\n\nYour Mileage May Vary is an advice column offering you a new framework for thinking through your ethical dilemmas and philosophical questions. To submit a question, email Sigal at sigal.samuel@vox.com or fill out this anonymous form. Either way, if we choose your question, it’ll be anonymized. Here’s this week’s question, condensed and edited for clarity:\n\nI work for the federal government in a policy role. I took the job before President Trump won the election and I didn’t expect that he would triumph. Since he’s come into power, I’ve been wrestling with the question of whether to quit or stay.\n\nI strongly disagree with this administration’s politics and don’t want to be complicit in them. But I think I’m doing good and valuable work in my particular lane — work that could improve things for people in this country and abroad. How do you decide whether to participate in an admin you disagree with or whether to walk away in protest?\n\nDear Concerned About Complicity,\n\nWhy did you choose this career to begin with? It sounds like it was because you — like lots of other people who go into government — sincerely care about doing good. So let’s use that as our lodestar here.\n\nIf your goal is to do good, the most obvious potential reason to stay in your job is that you believe it still gives you a unique opportunity to do just that. Even though you disagree with this administration’s politics, it’s possible that you can still do more good by staying put than you could do by leaving government and avoiding the taint of politics.\n\nThere are a number of ways that could be true. One is if your particular role is relatively removed from the administration’s more controversial moves: if you work for the Environmental Protection Agency, say, not the Justice Department. Another is if you believe you can create positive impact from within — for example, by making the case for better policies at critical moments — in a way that wouldn’t happen if you resigned and got replaced.\n\nAnd then there’s the simple fact that, well, this is how the system of liberal democracy works. When a president is democratically elected, it’s the job of government employees to heed the president’s decisions, and not just the ones they personally agree with.\n\nThere are really good reasons to want to uphold that system. One of liberal democracy’s great defenders, the British philosopher Isaiah Berlin, argued in his essay “Two Concepts of Liberty” that human values are inherently diverse, sometimes incompatible, and impossible to rank on a single scale. That means no single political arrangement can satisfy all legitimate human values simultaneously. So, he reasoned, we need to embrace political pluralism and respect competing perspectives.\n\nHowever.\n\nAll of the above assumes that staying in your job would allow you to achieve the overarching goal. Remember, that goal is to do good.\n\nHave a question you want me to answer in the next Your Mileage May Vary column? Feel free to email me at sigal.samuel@vox.com or fill out this anonymous form! Newsletter subscribers will get my column before anyone else does and their questions will be prioritized for future editions. Sign up here!\n\nSo, what if you find that you cannot actually create any positive impact from within? What if your arguments are suppressed at every turn? What if there’s so much intimidation that it leaves you both powerless and traumatized? What if you are pressured to do harm?\n\nFor that matter, what if your boss tells you to carry out a policy that’s actually illegal? What if the administration, despite being elected through the machinery of democracy, goes on to hack away at democracy itself — the system you’re committed to upholding?\n\nWell, then, Hannah Arendt might have a thing or two to say to you.\n\nArendt, a German-Jewish philosopher known for her post-Holocaust theorizing on the banality of evil, published a short essay in 1964 called “Personal Responsibility Under Dictatorship.” Writing from firsthand experience (she lived in Germany during the rise of Nazism until fleeing in 1933), she notes that a lot of Germans who collaborated with the Nazis later said they’d “stayed on the job in order to prevent worse things from happening; only those who remained inside had a chance to mitigate things and to help at least some people … whereas those who did nothing shirked all responsibilities and thought only of themselves, of the salvation of their precious souls.”\n\nArendt is not impressed by this argument. She cautions against people’s tendency to convince themselves that, if they continue to serve power, they’ll be doing more good on net — or choosing the lesser of two evils:\n\nPolitically, the weakness of the argument has always been that those who choose the lesser evil forget very quickly that they chose evil … Moreover, if we look at the techniques of totalitarian government, it is obvious that the argument of “the lesser evil” — far from being raised only from the outside by those who do not belong to the ruling elite — is one of the mechanisms built into the machinery of terror and criminality. Acceptance of lesser evils is consciously used in conditioning the government officials as well as the population at large to the acceptance of evil as such.\n\nArendt’s point is that if you choose the “acceptance of lesser evils” route, you’re playing a game in which the deck is stacked against you. You’re incentivized to stay, because quitting can be socially, professionally, or financially ruinous, and bit by bit — like the frog in the boiling pot — you can become acclimated to worse and worse policies. “The extermination of Jews,” Arendt writes, “was preceded by a very gradual sequence of anti-Jewish measures, each of which was accepted with the argument that refusal to cooperate would make things worse — until a stage was reached where nothing worse could possibly have happened.”\n\nSo, if you’re going to play this game, you need a way to make sure that you won’t fall into the traps. You might think the best way to do this is to get very clear on your own personal rules — to establish in advance, ideally in writing, at what point you’ll just say, “I’m out.” There’s some merit to that idea, because the mind has a way of shifting the goalposts as things progress, saying, “But that’s not really so bad, right? I’ll wait just a little bit more…”\n\nThe law can be a useful heuristic device here — you want to keep following it, even if people start pressuring you to do something illegal. Moral rules can also be a powerful heuristic device — think “thou shalt not kill,” for starters.\n\nBut Arendt emphasizes that legality and morality can fall short in extreme political situations. That’s because the illegal can become legalized overnight. The whole state machinery can start enforcing what were previously considered crimes, and moral norms can be changed along with them. The public can be swayed into accepting the new reality.\n\nSo how do you safeguard your integrity? Arendt observes that what was special about those who refused to collaborate with the Nazis wasn’t that classic rules about right and wrong were firmly established in their conscience, but that their conscience didn’t work by automatically applying any pre-learned rules. She writes:\n\nMuch more reliable will be the doubters and skeptics, not because skepticism is good or doubting wholesome, but because they are used to examine things and to make up their own minds.\n\nIn other words, it’s about daring to think and judge for yourself at every turn. It’s about continuing to ask yourself tough questions.\n\nArendt had a great hack for achieving this: She surrounded herself with people she disagreed with, both in the legendary cocktail-fueled salons she hosted and in her one-on-one friendships. She and her friends challenged and sharpened each other’s thoughts through intellectual debate. Though it was sometimes painful, Arendt insisted that this type of friendship has a radical political power: It teaches you the all-important skill of thinking.\n\nSo, over the coming weeks, keep your eyes trained on what the administration does. Each week, return to your lodestar and ask yourself anew: What would my challengers say to me now? Are there concrete indications that I’m succeeding in my overarching goal? Am I still doing good here?\n\nBonus: What I’m reading\n\nOver the past week, I’ve become completely obsessed with the novel Babel by R.F. Kuang. It imagines an alternative history where Oxford scholars use the power of translation to expand the British empire — and their students launch an anti-colonialist secret society to bring the empire down. It raises questions about complicity in an unusually thoughtful and totally un-put-down-able way.\n\nIn Foreign Affairs, two democracy experts make this prediction : “US democracy will likely break down during the second Trump administration, in the sense that it will cease to meet standard criteria for liberal democracy,” they write. “What lies ahead is not fascist or single-party dictatorship but competitive authoritarianism — a system in which parties compete in elections but the incumbent’s abuse of power tilts the playing field against the opposition.”",

        "content": "is an editorial director at Vox overseeing the climate, tech, and world teams, and is the editor of Vox’s Future Perfect section. He worked at Time magazine for 15 years as a foreign correspondent in Asia, a climate writer, and an international editor, and he wrote a book on existential risk.\n\nI was an English major in college, and my favorite poet was the first-generation Romantic William Wordsworth. For one thing, there’s the name, the best example of nominative determinism in the annals of English literature.\n\nBut what I most love about Wordsworth is the way he acts as a bridge between the formal, at times stultified style of the poetry that came before him, and the dawn of a new era that venerated individual emotion and experience — both the good and the ill. All that comes together in one of my favorite Wordsworth poems: “Surprised by Joy.”\n\nLove, faithful love, recalled thee to my mind-- But how could I forget thee? Through what power, Even for the least division of an hour, Have I been so beguiled as to be blind To my most grievous loss?\n\nBeneath the archaic language, the “thees” and so forth, the verse describes a father who is temporarily distracted from his loss by a moment of joy, only to recall with agonizing suddenness that the one person he wishes to share it with — his young child — is gone. The “surprise” in “Surprised by Joy” is that it was possible, even for the briefest moment, for the poet not to be consumed by that “most grievous loss.”\n\nLike most of Wordsworth’s poems, “Surprised by Joy” was drawn from his personal experience — in this case, the loss of his daughter Catherine in 1812, when she was just 3 years old. Wordsworth and his wife Mary had five children, two of whom died young: Catherine, and their son Thomas, who passed away from measles at age 6, just a half year after Catherine’s death.\n\nTo lose two young children in less than a calendar year is a grief I cannot fathom. But it was unbearably common at the time. Nearly one in every three children in England in 1800 died before the age of 5. In 1900 in the US, the death rate for children was nearly one in five, as my Vox colleague Anna North wrote recently. Look back over the full course of human history, and it is estimated that nearly one in every two children died before reaching their 15th birthday.\n\nIt might be comforting, perhaps, to pretend that the parents of the past weren’t as affected with the death of a child, because it was so common. After all, family sizes used to be much larger, in part because of the ubiquity of childhood mortality.\n\nYet Wordsworth’s lines bury that comfort in the graveyard where it belongs. In 2025, in 1812, in 2000 BC, the death of a young child is the worst thing that could happen to any parent.\n\nThe most important number in the world\n\nYou’re probably wondering, “Where’s the good news?” Here it is: The rate of childhood mortality is now far, far lower than it once was. Best of all, it’s continuing to drop.\n\nIn 1990, 12.8 million children died before the age of 5, but in the years since that number has fallen by more than 60 percent. According to new data released by the UN this week, the number of under-5 deaths fell to a record-low of 4.8 million in 2023.\n\nAt Vox’s Future Perfect, the section I run, we like to refer to the drastic drop in child mortality as the most important statistic in the world, for several reasons:\n\nIf a child can make it to their fifth birthday, it significantly increases their chance of living a full life. Given that life expectancy overall has increased hugely as well , that can mean the difference between a life of a few years and one that extends to 70 years or more. With millions of children alive today who would have been dead just a few decades ago, that adds up to billions of years of additional life.\n\nChild mortality is one of the most important indicators of a country’s development. As the chart above shows, rich nations like the UK and the US first made progress in keeping children alive, but more recently poorer nations like India have made tremendous strides. (Child mortality dropped an astounding 81 percent between 1980 and today in India.)\n\nThe reduction in child mortality is perhaps the best example of the international community setting a goal and making major progress toward it. In 2000, the UN aimed to reduce child mortality to two-thirds below 1990 levels by 2015. While we didn’t quite make it by then, we’re almost there now. Global health is a bright spot compared to the struggles in making progress on climate change.\n\nWe shouldn’t need economic motivations to want to reduce child deaths, but reduced childhood mortality is also associated with better economic performance. Family sizes fall to a more manageable level in poor countries, and more future workers survive to a productive age.\n\nHow did we get here — and where are we going?\n\nThere is no secret formula to reducing child mortality. Improved prenatal, childbirth, and postnatal care all keep children alive in their vulnerable first months. Better sanitation and nutrition prevent early deaths from waterborne illnesses and malnutrition.\n\nVaccines have, of course, saved untold millions of children from once common killers like measles, diphtheria and polio. (Let me say this again louder for those in the back row, especially if any of you happen to currently be running the Department of Health and Human Services: VACCINES!)\n\nDespite this tremendous success, 4.8 million children — approximately the population of Phoenix — still die before their fifth birthday, which is exactly 4.8 million too many. The world would have to reduce child mortality by an additional 30 percent or so to meet the new UN goal of essentially ending preventable child deaths 2030.\n\nUnfortunately, we’re not on that trajectory. While the number of child deaths is still declining, progress has been slowing down, and that was before the massive cuts in foreign aid in the US and other countries. The highest levels of child mortality today are found in extremely poor sub-Saharan African nations like Chad and Mali where aid will be the difference between life and death.\n\nHere in the US, the turn away from childhood vaccines risks reintroducing long-conquered killers of children. The fact that an unvaccinated child in Texas recently died of the measles — the same disease that took Wordsworth’s son Thomas, back when there was no protection from the virus — should horrify all of us.\n\nWhether it is through resurrecting the most effective forms of foreign aid, or reconfirming our trust in vaccines that have saved millions, it is in our power to eventually end preventable child deaths. We can ensure that one day no parent will experience the pain suffered by William Wordsworth and by countless parents before and after him. Such an achievement would be a joy that lasts.\n\nA version of this story originally appeared in the Good News newsletter.

        "content": "is a senior correspondent at Vox, where he focuses on the Supreme Court, the Constitution, and the decline of liberal democracy in the United States. He received a JD from Duke University and is the author of two books on the Supreme Court.\n\nA Vox reader asks: If we have “separation of church and state,” why do we give religious schools tax exemption? How come religious schools get government funding? Why was Trump allowed to campaign on religion and publicly sell Bibles? Why does it say “In God We Trust” on our money? Why is “under God” in the Pledge of Allegiance?\n\nThe concept of “separation of church and state” isn’t quite as ironclad as you may think.\n\nThe First Amendment prohibits laws “respecting an establishment of religion,” a provision that many Americans believe should create a firm wall of separation between church and state. But the Constitution also does not enforce itself. In the United States, we rely on judges and Supreme Court justices to determine what the Constitution means and to apply it to individual cases.\n\nThat means that the amount of church and state separation in the United States tends to ebb and flow depending on who sits on the Supreme Court.\n\nThe idea that the government should play no role in funding or encouraging religion probably hit its high water mark in the mid-20th century. As the Supreme Court said in Everson v. Board of Education (1947), “no tax in any amount, large or small, can be levied to support any religious activities or institutions, whatever they may be called, or whatever form they may adopt to teach or practice religion.” That suggests that it is unconstitutional to fund any religious activity with money collected from taxes.\n\nBeginning in the Nixon administration, however, the Court started to move steadily rightward. Nixon filled four of the nine seats on the Supreme Court, though most of his nominees were relative moderates compared to the increasingly ideological justices chosen by Presidents Ronald Reagan, George W. Bush, and Donald Trump.\n\nToday, the Republican Party has a 6-3 supermajority on the Supreme Court, and when church and state cases have come before them, all six of those Republicans have behaved exactly how you would expect members of a political movement closely aligned with conservative Christianity to behave. That means that the Court is now actively tearing down whatever barrier used to exist between church and state.\n\nRelated The Supreme Court is leading a Christian conservative revolution\n\nWhy is religion in public schools and on American money?\n\nLet’s start with Carson v. Makin (2022), in which the Republican justices concluded that, if a state offers vouchers to help some students pay for private education, it must allow those vouchers to be spent on religious schools. The Court also recently announced that it will hear two other cases, out of Oklahoma, which are likely to require states to fund religious charter schools.\n\nRelated A new Supreme Court case would force the government to create religious public schools\n\nIf you’re looking for an explanation for this shift, you will not find it in the Constitution, as the text of the First Amendment has not changed. You will find it instead within the shifting personnel within the Supreme Court.\n\nThe question of whether taxpayers must fund religious schools is a hotly contested one and is likely to hinge on which political party controls the Supreme Court for the foreseeable future. But it’s worth acknowledging that there are people of faith in both political parties. Americans of all political persuasions care a great deal about their churches, mosques, temples, and synagogues.\n\nIndeed, that may explain why Trump — who, as a private citizen campaigning for office, had a First Amendment right to say anything he wanted to say about religion — chose to center religion in his campaign and even sell Bibles. The Bible is literally the most popular book in the world, and millions of American voters look fondly upon politicians who align themselves with it.\n\nAnd this reality also shapes how, say, US tax policy functions.\n\nThere’s never been a serious effort to strip religious charities, including houses of worship, of their tax-exempt status. And there probably never will be, because the people who attend those houses of worship are voters, and they would likely rise up in outrage if such a thing were attempted.\n\nThat said, the Constitution has also long been understood to forbid religious discrimination. So these tax exemptions must be offered equally to people of all faiths. If a church can claim a tax exemption, a mosque must also be able to claim that same exemption on the same terms.\n\nSimilarly, there are some largely ceremonial or symbolic nods to religion — such as the use of the phrase “In God we Trust” on US coins, or the opening of many legislative sessions with a prayer — that, as the Supreme Court said in Marsh v. Chambers (1983), are “deeply embedded in the history and tradition of this country,” a history and tradition that — especially early on — was intertwined with Christianity. The courts have left many of these symbolic acknowledgments of religion in place, in part because attempting to dislodge them is unlikely to be successful.\n\nTo understand why, consider a controversy that briefly flared up during the second Bush administration. In 2002, a federal appeals court ruled that the inclusion of the words “under God” in a public school’s daily recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance violates the Constitution. That decision triggered a massive backlash among members of Congress, including a bipartisan proposal to amend the Constitution to permit “a reference to God in the Pledge of Allegiance or on United States currency.”",

        "content": "Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has been called the most unqualified health secretary in the history of the US. Before his confirmation, over 22,000 doctors signed a letter urging the Senate to reject his appointment. During the confirmation hearing, several senators grilled him on his concerning history related to vaccine misinformation: things like his founding of an anti-vax organization, his concerning anti-vax rhetoric, and his history of suing vaccine manufacturers, something he stands to make a lot of money doing.\n\nThe former environmental lawyer was propelled to the nation’s highest health office largely by the “Make America Healthy Again” (MAHA) movement, a play on Trump’s “Make America Great Again” slogan. As health secretary, Kennedy wants to solve the chronic disease epidemic in the US, which plenty of doctors can get behind. The issue is that he aims to do it at the expense of infectious disease research. Therein lies the problem. Most people can agree when he says things like, “I’m supportive of vaccines” and “I want good science.” The trouble is that his definition of “good” is, well — let’s call it historically shaky. In March, he appointed a well-known vaccine skeptic to head a study on the long-debunked potential link between vaccines and autism.\n\nSo what’s next? Can RFK Jr. take away vaccines that are already on the market? It’s unlikely, but he doesn’t need to. Kennedy sits at the helm of the very department he’s been undermining for years. In that position, the power he has over vaccine policy isn’t limitless, but the changes he can make could ripple for decades.\n\nYou can find this video and more on our YouTube channel.",

She writes primarily about the future of consciousness, tracking advances in artificial intelligence and neuroscience and their staggering ethical implications. Before joining Vox, Sigal was the religion editor at the Atlantic.\n\nThe AI world is moving so fast that it’s easy to get lost amid the flurry of shiny new products. OpenAI announces one, then the Chinese startup DeepSeek releases one, then OpenAI immediately puts out another one. Each is important, but focus too much on any one of them and you’ll miss the really big story of the past six months.\n\nThe big story is: AI companies now claim that their models are capable of genuine reasoning — the type of thinking you and I do when we want to solve a problem.\n\nAnd the big question is: Is that true?\n\nThe stakes are high, because the answer will inform how everyone from your mom to your government should — and should not — turn to AI for help.\n\nIf you’ve played around with ChatGPT, you know that it was designed to spit out quick answers to your questions. But state-of-the-art “reasoning models” — like OpenAI’s o1 or DeepSeek’s r1 — are designed to “think” a while before responding, by breaking down big problems into smaller problems and trying to solve them step by step. The industry calls that “chain-of-thought reasoning.”\n\nThese models are yielding some very impressive results. They can solve tricky logic puzzles, ace math tests, and write flawless code on the first try. Yet they also fail spectacularly on really easy problems.\n\nAI experts are torn over how to interpret this. Skeptics take it as evidence that “reasoning” models aren’t really reasoning at all. Believers insist that the models genuinely are doing some reasoning, and though it may not currently be as flexible as a human’s reasoning, it’s well on its way to getting there.\n\nSo, who’s right?\n\nThe best answer will be unsettling to both the hard skeptics of AI and the true believers.\n\nWhat counts as reasoning?\n\nLet’s take a step back. What exactly is reasoning, anyway?\n\nAI companies like OpenAI are using the term reasoning to mean that their models break down a problem into smaller problems, which they tackle step by step, ultimately arriving at a better solution as a result.\n\nFuture Perfect Explore the big, complicated problems the world faces and the most efficient ways to solve them.

Although scientists are still trying to understand how reasoning works in the human brain — nevermind in AI — they agree that there are actually lots of different types of reasoning.\n\nThere’s deductive reasoning, where you start with a general statement and use it to reach a specific conclusion. There’s inductive reasoning, where you use specific observations to make a broader generalization. And there’s analogical reasoning, causal reasoning, common sense reasoning … suffice it to say, reasoning is not just one thing!\n\nNow, if someone comes up to you with a hard math problem and gives you a chance to break it down and think about it step by step, you’ll do a lot better than if you have to blurt out the answer off the top of your head. So, being able to do deliberative “chain-of-thought reasoning” is definitely helpful, and it might be a necessary ingredient of getting anything really difficult done. Yet it’s not the whole of reasoning.\n\nOne feature of reasoning that we care a lot about in the real world is the ability to suss out “a rule or pattern from limited data or experience and to apply this rule or pattern to new, unseen situations,” writes Melanie Mitchell, a professor at the Santa Fe Institute, together with her co-authors in a paper on AI’s reasoning abilities. “Even very young children are adept at learning abstract rules from just a few examples.”\n\nIn other words, a toddler can generalize. Can an AI?\n\nA lot of the debate turns around this question. Skeptics are very, well, skeptical of AI’s ability to generalize. They think something else is going on.\n\nThe skeptic’s case\n\n“It’s a kind of meta-mimicry,” Shannon Vallor, a philosopher of technology at the University of Edinburgh, told me when OpenAI’s o1 came out in September.\n\nShe meant that while an older model like ChatGPT mimics the human-written statements in its training data, a newer model like o1 mimics the process that humans engage in to come up with those statements. In other words, she believes, it’s not truly reasoning. It would be pretty easy for o1 to just make it sound like it’s reasoning; after all, its training data is rife with examples of that, from doctors analyzing symptoms to decide on a diagnosis to judges evaluating evidence to arrive at a verdict.\n\nBesides, when OpenAI built the o1 model, it made some changes from the previous ChatGPT model but did not dramatically overhaul the architecture — and ChatGPT was flubbing easy questions last year, like answering a question about how to get a man and a goat across a river in a totally ridiculous way. So why, Vallor asked, would we think o1 is doing something totally new and magical — especially given that it, too, flubs easy questions? “In the cases where it fails, you see what, for me, is compelling evidence that it’s not reasoning at all,” she said.\n\nMitchell was surprised at how well o3 — OpenAI’s newest reasoning model, announced at the end of last year as a successor to o1 — performed on tests. But she was also surprised at just how much computation it used to solve the problems. We don’t know what it’s doing with all that computation, because OpenAI is not transparent about what’s going on under the hood.\n\n“I’ve actually done my own experiments on people where they’re thinking out loud about these problems, and they don’t think out loud for, you know, hours of computation time,” she told me. “They just say a couple sentences and then say, ‘Yeah, I see how it works,’ because they’re using certain kinds of concepts. I don’t know if o3 is using those kinds of concepts.”\n\nWithout greater transparency from the company, Mitchell said we can’t be sure that the model is breaking down a big problem into steps and getting a better overall answer as a result of that approach, as OpenAI claims.\n\nShe pointed to a paper, “Let’s Think Dot by Dot,” where researchers did not get a model to break down a problem into intermediate steps; instead, they just told the model to generate dots. Those dots were totally meaningless — what the paper’s authors call “filler tokens.” But it turned out that just having additional tokens there allowed the model more computational capacity, and it could use that extra computation to solve problems better. That suggests that when a model generates intermediate steps — whether it’s a phrase like “let’s think about this step by step” or just “....” — those steps don’t necessarily mean it’s doing the human-like reasoning you think it’s doing.\n\n“I think a lot of what it’s doing is more like a bag of heuristics than a reasoning model,” Mitchell told me. A heuristic is a mental shortcut — something that often lets you guess the right answer to a problem, but not by actually thinking it through.\n\nHere’s a classic example: Researchers trained an AI vision model to analyze photos for skin cancer. It seemed, at first blush, like the model was genuinely figuring out if a mole is malignant. But it turned out the photos of malignant moles in its training data often contained a ruler, so the model had just learned to use the presence of a ruler as a heuristic for deciding on malignancy.\n\nSkeptical AI researchers think that state-of-the-art models may be doing something similar: They appear to be “reasoning” their way through, say, a math problem, but really they’re just drawing on a mix of memorized information and heuristics.\n\nThe believer’s case\n\nOther experts are more bullish on reasoning models. Ryan Greenblatt, chief scientist at Redwood Research, a nonprofit that aims to mitigate risks from advanced AI, thinks these models are pretty clearly doing some form of reasoning.\n\n“They do it in a way that doesn’t generalize as well as the way humans do it — they’re relying more on memorization and knowledge than humans do — but they’re still doing the thing,” Greenblatt said. “It’s not like there’s no generalization at all.”\n\nAfter all, these models have been able to solve hard problems beyond the examples they’ve been trained on — often very impressively. For Greenblatt, the simplest explanation as to how is that they are indeed doing some reasoning.\n\nAnd the point about heuristics can cut both ways, whether we’re talking about a reasoning model or an earlier model like ChatGPT. Consider the “a man, a boat, and a goat” prompt that had many skeptics mocking OpenAI last year:\n\nWhat’s going on here? Greenblatt says the model messed up because this prompt is actually a classic logic puzzle that dates back centuries and that would have appeared many times in the training data. In some formulations of the river-crossing puzzle, a farmer with a wolf, a goat, and a cabbage must cross over by boat. The boat can only carry the farmer and a single item at a time — but if left together, the wolf will eat the goat or the goat will eat the cabbage, so the challenge is to get everything across without anything getting eaten. That explains the model’s mention of a cabbage in its response. The model would instantly “recognize” the puzzle.\n\n“My best guess is that the models have this incredibly strong urge to be like, ‘Oh, it’s this puzzle! I know what this puzzle is! I should do this because that performed really well in the training data.’ It’s like a learned heuristic,” Greenblatt said. The implication? “It’s not that it can’t solve it. In a lot of these cases, if you say it’s a trick question, and then you give the question, the model often does totally fine.”\n\nHumans fail in the same way all the time, he pointed out. If you’d just spent a month studying color theory — from complementary colors to the psychological effects of different hues to the historical significance of certain pigments in Renaissance paintings — and then got a quiz asking, “Why did the artist paint the sky blue in this landscape painting?”... well, you might be tricked into writing a needlessly complicated answer! Maybe you’d write about how the blue represents the divine heavens, or how the specific shade suggests the painting was done in the early morning hours which symbolizes rebirth … when really, the answer is simply: Because the sky is blue!\n\nAjeya Cotra, a senior analyst at Open Philanthropy who researches the risks from AI, agrees with Greenblatt on that point. And, she said of the latest models, “I think they’re genuinely getting better at this wide range of tasks that humans would call reasoning tasks.”\n\nShe doesn’t dispute that the models are doing some meta-mimicry. But when skeptics say “it’s just doing meta-mimicry,” she explained, “I think the ‘just’ part of it is the controversial part. It feels like what they’re trying to imply often is ‘and therefore it’s not going to have a big impact on the world’ or ‘and therefore artificial superintelligence is far away’ — and that’s what I dispute.”\n\nTo see why, she said, imagine you’re teaching a college physics class. You’ve got different types of students. One is an outright cheater: He just looks in the back of the book for the answers and then writes them down. Another student is such a savant that he doesn’t even need to think about the equations; he understands the physics on such a deep, intuitive, Einstein-like level that he can derive the right equations on the fly. All the other students are somewhere in the middle: They’ve memorized a list of 25 equations and are trying to figure out which equation to apply in which situation.\n\nLike the majority of students, AI models are pairing some memorization with some reasoning, Cotra told me.\n\n“The AI models are like a student that is not very bright but is superhumanly diligent, and so they haven’t just memorized 25 equations, they’ve memorized 500 equations, including ones for weird situations that could come up,” she said. They’re pairing a lot of memorization with a little bit of reasoning — that is, with figuring out what combination of equations to apply to a problem. “And that just takes you very far! They seem at first glance as impressive as the person with the deep intuitive understanding.”\n\nOf course, when you look harder, you can still find holes that their 500 equations just happen not to cover. But that doesn’t mean zero reasoning has taken place.\n\nIn other words, the models are neither exclusively reasoning nor exclusively just reciting.\n\n“It’s somewhere in between,” Cotra said. “I think people are thrown off by that because they want to put it in one camp or another. They want to say it’s just memorizing or they want to say it’s truly deeply reasoning. But the fact is, there’s just a spectrum of the depth of reasoning.”\n\nAI systems have “jagged intelligence”\n\nResearchers have come up with a buzzy term to describe this pattern of reasoning: “jagged intelligence.” It refers to the strange fact that, as computer scientist Andrej Karpathy explained, state-of-the-art AI models “can both perform extremely impressive tasks (e.g., solve complex math problems) while simultaneously struggling with some very dumb problems.”\n\nDrew Shannon for Vox\n\nPicture it like this. If human intelligence looks like a cloud with softly rounded edges, artificial intelligence is like a spiky cloud with giant peaks and valleys right next to each other. In humans, a lot of problem-solving capabilities are highly correlated with each other, but AI can be great at one thing and ridiculously bad at another thing that (to us) doesn’t seem far apart.\n\nMind you, it’s all relative.\n\n“Compared to what humans are good at, the models are quite jagged,” Greenblatt told me. “But I think indexing on humans is a little confusing. From the model’s perspective, it’s like, ‘Wow, those humans are so jagged! They’re so bad at next-token prediction!’ It’s not clear that there’s some objective sense in which AI is more jagged.”\n\nThe fact that reasoning models are trained to sound like humans reasoning makes us disposed to compare AI intelligence to human intelligence. But the best way to think of AI is probably not as “smarter than a human” or “dumber than a human” but just as “different.”\n\nRegardless, Cotra anticipates that sooner or later AI intelligence will be so vast that it can contain within it all of human intelligence, and then some.\n\n“I think about, what are the risks that emerge when AI systems are truly better than human experts at everything? When they might still be jagged, but their full jagged intelligence encompasses all of human intelligence and more?” she said. “I’m always looking ahead to that point in time and preparing for that.”\n\nFor now, the practical upshot for most of us is this: Remember what AI is and isn’t smart at — and use it accordingly.\n\nThe best use case is a situation where it’s hard for you to come up with a solution, but once you get a solution from the AI you can easily check to see if it’s correct. Writing code is a perfect example. Another example would be making a website: You can see what the AI produced and, if you don’t like it, just get the AI to redo it.\n\nIn other domains — especially ones where there is no objective right answer or where the stakes are high — you’ll want to be more hesitant about using AI. You might get some initial suggestions from it, but don’t put too much stock in it, especially if what it’s saying seems off to you. An example would be asking for advice on how to handle a moral dilemma. You might see what thoughts the model is provoking in you without trusting it as giving you the final answer.\n\n“The more things are fuzzy and judgment-driven,” Cotra said, “the more you want to use it as a thought partner, not an oracle.”",

        "content": "When you get to a place financially where you can begin to start saving rather than living paycheck to paycheck, a big question often comes up: Should I pay off my debt or invest in the stock market? There’s no simple answer, but there’s a rule of thumb that can help you decide what to do with this money to have the best financial outcome in the long run.\n\nThe first place to look is the interest rate on your debt and see if it’s below 7 percent, the rate of return you can conservatively expect from investing in an index fund, like the S&P 500. If your debt — like a mortgage or a student loan — falls below 7 percent, it is usually mathematically more beneficial to invest in the stock market while you pay down the debt by its minimum payments. The logic being that you’ll likely earn more interest by investing than your debt will accrue in that time.\n\nHigher interest rate debt, like credit card debt, should almost always be eliminated as soon as possible, since you are statistically unlikely to see a rate of return from investing past 7 to 10 percent annually. And of course, investing always comes with risk. So the most secure bet is always to work toward being debt-free.\n\n\n\nFind this and other Vox videos on YouTube.\n\n\n\nThis video is presented by Robinhood.

        "title": "5 big questions about Trump’s tariffs and how they might work",
        "source": "https://www.vox.com/",
        "content": "is a senior correspondent at Vox. He covers a wide range of political and policy issues with a special focus on questions that internally divide the American left and right. Before coming to Vox in 2024, he wrote a column on politics and economics for New York Magazine.\n\nDonald Trump has said that “tariff” is the “most beautiful word in the dictionary.” And throughout his first months in office, he has given Americans plenty of cause for googling that word’s definition.\n\nThe president announced Wednesday — a day he dubbed “Liberation Day” — that he will impose tariffs of at least 10 percent on all foreign-made goods. For products made in China, the tariff rate will be 34 percent; for those made in Vietnam, it will be 46 percent; for the European Union, it will be 20 percent. Trump framed these tariffs as “reciprocal,” meaning that that they match the level of trade restrictions that each foreign nation imposes on US products. But this is not true — Trump’s tariffs greatly exceed those of America’s targeted trade partners.\n\nMeanwhile, they’ve left some Americans concerned and confused; tariffs arguably haven’t been this relevant to the US economy in nearly a century. So many are understandably unsure about what tariffs are, how they affect consumers, why governments would implement them, and whether the president’s policy will work on its own terms.\n\nHere’s the short answer: Tariffs are a tax on imported goods. They generally make affected consumer products more expensive. In theory, well-designed tariffs will also encourage targeted industries to produce more in the United States. And manufacturing certain goods domestically — instead of importing them from abroad —may have national security or economic benefits. Trump’s own rationales for his tariffs are numerous and shifting: He sees them as a tool for raising revenue, enhancing national security, and revitalizing the US economy by increasing domestic manufacturing jobs. But the president’s tariffs are so broad, high, and ever-changing that they could actually backfire.\n\nWhat are tariffs? How will they affect consumers?\n\nTo understand what tariffs are — and how they work — it’s helpful to consider a concrete example. On April 3, Trump will impose a 25 percent tariff on all cars made outside the United States. This means businesses that import foreign-made automobiles — such as car dealerships — will need to pay a 25 percent tax on every foreign vehicle that they purchase.\n\nWhen a business’s costs rise, it typically tries to compensate by raising prices. And the president actually needs his auto tariffs to raise the prices of foreign cars: The official point of this tariff is to encourage Americans to buy more domestically produced cars, so that more auto manufacturers locate production in the US. If the tariff doesn’t make foreign-made cars more expensive for US consumers, it won’t give them any incentive to “buy American.”\n\nIn practice, Trump’s auto tariffs are likely to increase the prices of all cars, including American-made ones. This is for two reasons: First, US car manufacturers will need to pay tariffs on foreign-made auto parts. And second, US auto companies will face weaker competition. Previously, American carmakers couldn’t raise prices without fearing that doing so would lead potential customers to purchase a German, Japanese, or South Korean car instead. Trump’s tariffs make that much less of a concern.\n\nFor these reasons, economists have estimated that Trump’s tariffs will raise US car prices by between $4,000 and $15,000 per vehicle.\n\nThese same basic dynamics apply to tariffs on other goods. Put a tariff on foreign-made washing machines, and US retailers that import such appliances will raise prices. American washing machine makers, meanwhile, will be able to charge more due to weaker competition.\n\nAnd this actually happened: In 2018, Trump put a tariff on washing machines, which stayed in effect until 2023. During the four years that those tariffs were in place, the cost of laundry equipment in the US rose by 34 percent, much higher than the overall inflation rate over that period.\n\nTrump’s current tariffs are poised to have an even bigger impact on Americans’ finances. According to a recent estimate from the Yale Budget Lab, Trump’s tariffs on Canada, Mexico, and China alone could reduce the average US household’s disposable income by as much as $2,000.\n\nIf tariffs hurt consumers, why would governments impose them? What are the benefits of tariffs?\n\nThere is little question that tariffs are bad for consumers. But in theory, they could still serve a nation’s interests in at least three ways:\n\nBy generating revenue. Since tariffs are a tax, they provide the government with revenue that it can use to pay down debts or finance spending. The US government actually used tariffs as its primary revenue source from the republic’s founding until the Civil War. But since the federal income tax was introduced in 1913, tariffs have become an increasingly marginal source of funds for the government.\n\nTrump says he wants to change this. In fact, he has called for replacing income taxes with tariffs. And his administration claims that its auto tariffs will bring in $100 billion of revenue this year.\n\nBy nurturing highly valuable domestic industries. Many nations have successfully used tariffs to facilitate economic development.\n\nFor example, beginning in the 1960s, South Korea sought to build up its domestic car industry. But getting such an industry off the ground is difficult. In their first years of operation, South Korea carmakers had little hope of producing automobiles that were competitive with foreign ones in quality or price. By placing high tariffs on foreign-made cars, the South Korean government ensured that its domestic automakers would have a market for their less-than-stellar vehicles. Today, South Korean brands like Kia and Hyundai are globally competitive.\n\nAmerica’s car industry is much more mature today than South Korea’s was in the 1960s. But American auto manufacturers cannot make electric vehicles as efficiently as China can. Economic analysts disagree about whether it is important for America to have a globally competitive EV sector. But if we do want to nurture our electric vehicle industry, it makes some sense to put high tariffs on Chinese EVs — as both Joe Biden and Trump have done.\n\nBy improving national security. Some goods and commodities have military value. Relying on foreign nations for steel, ammunition, advanced semiconductors, or various other technologies could undermine a country’s national security — after all, foreign nations could theoretically choke off America’s access to militarily valuable technologies in the midst of a conflict. And many of Trump’s tariffs are officially intended to enhance America’s capacity to produce materials necessary for war.\n\nHow have recent administrations used tariffs?\n\nThe United States had used tariffs to nurture its infant industries during the 19th and early 20th centuries. But in the wake of World War II, America pursued the open exchange of goods across borders.\n\nWith much of Europe and Asia in ruins, US manufacturers did not need tariffs to dominate global industry. Meanwhile, America’s foreign policy establishment feared that communism would take root in Western Europe and Japan if they did not successfully rebuild their industrial economies. Therefore, to foster healthy capitalist growth abroad — while lowering prices for Americans — the US pursued tariff reduction.\n\nThe United States did occasionally enact new tariffs between the Second World War and Trump’s first election. For example, in 1987, Ronald Reagan put a 100 percent tariff on Japanese computers, televisions, and power tools, after Japan blocked US-made semiconductors from its market. But the general direction of US trade policy between Harry Truman’s presidency and Trump’s first term was toward freer trade.\n\nWhat will be the effect of Trump’s tariffs specifically?\n\nUnfortunately, it seems unlikely that Trump’s tariffs will generate reliable revenue, strengthen American manufacturing, or improve US national security. (And their odds of advancing Trump’s more peculiar trade policy goals, such as coercing Canada into becoming the 51st state, are even slimmer.)\n\nThere is a simple problem with tariffs as a revenue source: The more a tariff encourages consumers to buy domestically produced goods, the less revenue it generates. For example, if a tariff on foreign cars leads everyone to buy American vehicles, then the car tariff will cease generating revenue. Thus, for Trump’s tariffs to provide a steady source of revenue, they would need to be so low that importers continue purchasing lots of foreign-made goods (and thus paying taxes on them).\n\nBut Trump’s tariffs in many sectors are very high, precisely because he wants Americans to purchase fewer foreign-made goods. So the president’s tariffs can’t plausibly provide enough consistent revenue to offset his proposed tax cuts (let alone, to fully replace the federal income tax).\n\nMeanwhile, his tariffs could actually hurt US manufacturing for at least three reasons:\n\nFirst, Trump’s tariffs apply to a vast number of industrial inputs, such as metals, energy, and electronics. This will raise costs for US manufacturers, forcing them to raise prices, which will render their products less appealing to foreign consumers. Further, tariffs on inputs will also give companies an incentive to locate factories in other countries, where they will not have to pay, for example, a 25 percent tax on parts and materials made in Canada or Mexico.\n\nSecond, Trump’s tariffs will reduce the real wages of American workers. If the average US household’s disposable income drops by $2,000, that family will likely spend less money on goods. This could ultimately reduce demand for US-made products.\n\nIndeed, the market research firm Cox Automotive believes that this is precisely what will happen with Trump’s car tariffs. In its analysis, US car plants will likely have to cut production by 30 percent, as consumers will respond to rising prices by postponing car purchases.\n\nThird, foreign countries are retaliating against Trump’s trade policies by placing tariffs on American-made goods. And that will limit the global sales of American manufacturers. This will be especially true of America’s most innovative and advanced industries, such as pharmaceuticals, chemicals, and medical equipment, which are more likely to sell their wares globally.\n\nWe’ve already seen Trump’s tariffs backfire for these reasons. According to a 2019 Federal Reserve analysis, the tariffs Trump imposed during his first term reduced manufacturing employment in affected industries.\n\nFinally, the tariffs’ hypothetical national security benefits are dubious. America’s security likely depends more on strong international alliances than the amount of steel we produce domestically. And Trump’s tariffs have antagonized America’s closest allies while undermining our nation’s credibility as a dealmaker: In 2018, Trump himself reached a trade agreement with the governments of Canada and Mexico. Yet he nevertheless applied 25 percent tariffs on both countries this year, in direct violation of his own trade deal.\n\nIf the United States is unwilling to abide by the terms of the agreements it orchestrates, other countries have less incentive to cooperate with us.\n\nIn sum, Trump’s tariffs are likely to raise prices, weaken US manufacturers, and undermine America’s alliances and global influence.\n\nHow long will Trump’s tariffs be in effect?\n\nIt’s unclear how lasting Trump’s tariffs will prove to be. He has framed some of the duties — such as his 25 percent tariffs on Canada and Mexico — as a potentially temporary bargaining chip in negotiations over trade and border security. But he has suggested that others will be permanent.\n\nAs the costs of Trump’s trade policies to US consumers and manufacturers mount, it is possible that the administration will decide its agenda is politically unsustainable. Already, Trump’s tariffs are deeply unpopular, with 61 percent of voters disapproving of them in a recent CNN poll.\n\nUpdate, April 2, 4:50 pm ET: This post was updated to include information from Trump’s speech about tariffs.",

His coverage focuses on all things cinema, from the intricacies of film history to the nuts and bolts of filmmaking.\n\nIn 2025, Tom Hanks is 67 years old. Yet, in his latest film Here (directed by Robert Zemeckis), he’s convincingly transformed to appear as young as 18, and aged even beyond his current years. And the effect actually looks … good!\n\nBut de-aging effects haven’t always looked this good. Attempts at de-aging can be seen as early as 2006 — and since then filmmakers have experimented with tools and had … varying degrees of success. While 2D blurring and enhancement was the first iteration, realistic de-aging in motion required 3D methods — but no matter which way you sliced it, the process remained labor-intensive and results were often somewhere between okay and the uncanny valley.\n\nHere’s VFX supervisor Kevin Baillie told me that the current versions of these tools weren’t going to work on the movie. There were too many shots, and the results were too inconsistent for the quality level they were striving toward. So the filmmaking team looked elsewhere, to the bleeding edge of AI tools, to see what was possible. By feeding it a wealth of images featuring Tom Hanks and co-stars Robin Wright, Paul Bettany, and Kelly Reilly, they found they could create images that were remarkably realistic, streamlining the once arduous process.\n\nBut the true game changer was optimizing the speed of this tool to enable a real-time feed on set. This empowered actors, costume designers, makeup artists, hairstylists, and other crew members to ensure that every version of the characters, at any age, felt authentic and believable.\n\nIf you want to learn more about how all this was pulled off, check out Vox Video’s latest!",

Tuesday night, it quickly became clear that would be the Democrats.\n\nFor people living in Wisconsin, the chance to decide the ideological makeup of the court was a big deal. Nationally, though, the race became important for a few other reasons.\n\nOne, this was the first major statewide race happening in a swing state, or really any state, since Trump’s inauguration. Democrats did poorly in swing states in the 2024 election, so this race is seen as a test of whether Democrats can still win races.\n\nTwo, we’re about 10 weeks into Trump’s second term, so this race was viewed as a referendum on the Trump administration so far.\n\nThree, this race was also a referendum on Elon Musk’s power and influence. He managed to make the race in Wisconsin about himself, by spending tens of millions of dollars in support of Schimel, and by testing the limits of campaign finance rules, finding as many ways as possible to offer people money to pay attention to the race, including by giving away a million dollars to voters. He’s poured millions of dollars into canvassing, and even went to Wisconsin to hold a rally on Schimel’s behalf.\n\nFinally, this election gives us a new data point to try to answer a question political scientists have wrestled with for a long time: Are there two electorates? Conventional wisdom suggests the answer to that question is yes, that there are lower propensity voters who only turn out in presidential elections, and then there are higher propensity voters who are very tuned into politics who turn out in every election, be it presidential, midterm, or special.\n\nHowever, political polarization and the level of loyalty Donald Trump inspires has some wondering whether that still holds. Tuesday’s result helps suggest that it might.\n\nThis is an off-cycle race, and because of that, some political commentators saw this contest as favoring Democrats a little.\n\nLast year, Kamala Harris performed particularly well with voters who said that they followed news closely, the classic high-propensity voter. Again, high-propensity voters tend to reliably vote in non-presidential elections, and the thinking was, those same Harris voters might help Crawford. And it seems like they did.\n\nThere are other races coming up this year, and midterms next year. Does Wisconsin tell us anything about those?\n\nWe shouldn’t put too much stock in one race.\n\nThat said, you could argue Susan Crawford’s win makes some kind of blue wave next year appear a little more likely.\n\nThere are a few factors that made this a somewhat unique case for Democrats, which makes it a little difficult to draw broad conclusions.\n\nAs I mentioned, the fact that this was an off-cycle election probably helped Democrats, and there’s another unique factor that may have helped too. Elon Musk wasn’t the only person pouring in money; wealthy Democrats did too, as did grassroots donors. That’s in part because this was the only big race going on; if you’re a liberal donor or a fundraiser, where else can you send your money? That won’t be the case in the midterms next year.\n\nThat said, Crawford’s win does buttress conventional wisdom. Political science would tell us that you can’t be an unpopular president with an unpopular agenda, leading an unpopular party, and flip a seat in a statewide race like this. And Republicans did fail to flip this seat.\n\nThat failure could have some implication for next year’s midterms. Those elections tend to favor the party out of power, with voters trying to use them to put a check on the incumbent administration. If the other races coming up this year — like Virginia’s gubernatorial race — shake out like the race in Wisconsin, Democrats may decide their best bet is to just try to ride an anti-Trump, anti-Musk, anti-status quo anger to midterm victory.\n\nThe result is also a huge warning sign about the power of Elon Musk. Last year, a lot of people ridiculed his canvassing efforts on behalf of the Republicans, and his funding of external groups outside of the political party system to turn out voters. Then Trump won, and his strategy suddenly looked good.",

        "source": "https://www.vox.com/",
        "content": "On the first day of Donald Trump’s second presidential term, he signed an executive order about an old American rule: that with very few exceptions, anyone born here is a citizen. Trump’s order stated that the rule should no longer apply to the children of those in the United States illegally or temporarily. And while, within a few weeks, that order had been blocked by multiple federal judges, it was a temporary resolution, with the ultimate outcome yet to be determined, probably by the Supreme Court.\n\nThe US is far from the only country in the world that offers unconditional birthright citizenship. While it’s uncommon in Europe, Asia, and Africa, it’s very common among Western Hemisphere countries, partly because of their history as colonies populated mostly by settlers. But of the many countries with birthright citizenship in the world, the US is by far the largest, with hundreds of thousands of baby citizens born here every year to noncitizen parents. Those numbers naturally raise the questions: Is this what birthright citizenship was meant for? And why do we have birthright citizenship in the first place?\n\nThe short answer is that birthright citizenship in the US came about as a way of granting citizenship after the American Civil War to the large population of formerly enslaved Black people. But that raises a different question: How did a law intended for Black Americans end up creating hundreds of thousands of new US citizens born to immigrant parents every year? In the video above, we trace that history, answer that question, and look at a few of the times that the US has actually had this argument before. Today’s concerns over birthright citizenship may feel specific to our particular immigration debate. They’re actually not.",

Subscribe here.\n\nWelcome to The Logoff: Today I’m focusing on Donald Trump saying he’s imposing tariffs on products from around the world. If real and permanent — two big ifs — the policies represent a shift in economic policy that will have major effects on all Americans.\n\nWhat’s the latest? Trump today promised a 10 percent tariff on all foreign goods, with goods from many countries — including some of our largest trading partners — being taxed at a far higher rate. Trump also said certain foreign-made cars would face import taxes of 25 percent. Trump said the tariffs would take effect right away, though the exact timing is unclear.\n\nIs it real this time? This was Trump’s most sweeping tariff announcement to date, and he announced it during a high-profile White House ceremony, suggesting these tariffs may be here to stay. That said, it was only a month ago that Trump announced tariffs on our largest trading partners, only to rescind or delay some of them days after they took effect.\n\nCan Trump do this without Congress? There will likely be legal challenges, but existing law gives the president wide authority to unilaterally impose tariffs.\n\nWhat do tariffs mean for you? In the short term, higher prices. Tariffs are taxes paid by importers and passed on to consumers, so, if they remain in place, you can expect to pay more for a sweeping range of goods. Economists also fear that this tariff policy could kick off a recession, particularly as other countries promise to counter with taxes on US exports.\n\nWhat’s the big picture? There are valid critiques of past US free trade policies — particularly in how they’ve hurt certain communities and segments of the labor force. But economists are skeptical Trump can bring back US manufacturing at anywhere near the scale he’s promising, and they’re confident these new taxes will result in severe and widespread economic pain.",

        "title": "The hidden religious divide erupting into politics",
        "source": "https://www.vox.com/",
        "content": "is a research associate at the Institute for Orthodox Christian Studies in the United Kingdom and the author of Holy Russia? Holy War?: Why the Russian Church Is Backing Putin Against Ukraine.\n\nLess than a week after becoming vice president, JD Vance, only the second Catholic to hold the office, had a very public break with the leadership of the Roman Catholic Church in America. Without evidence, the second-in-command accused the US Conference of Catholic Bishops of settling “illegal immigrants” in order to access federal funds. Though largely used as fodder for internet “gotchas,” the scuffle pointed to a wider trend — one that could remake the country’s religious landscape and the fundamental way Americans think about how they believe and where they belong.\n\nVance is not just a Catholic. He’s a very specific type of Catholic, part of a group of young white men who, over the past decade, have found their way (often online) into both increasingly conservative politics and traditional religion — primarily Catholicism and Eastern Orthodoxy, rather than the Protestantism that has been a common cultural feature in America. (For the uninitiated, Eastern Orthodoxy, sometimes called “Greek Orthodox” or “Russian Orthodoxy,” is essentially the Eastern equivalent of the Catholic Church, though significant differences have arisen).\n\nOne recent study from the Orthodox Studies Institute suggests that conversion to Eastern Orthodoxy has increased 24 percent since 2021. These recent converts tend to be under 40 and single, and the majority are men. There is not a similarly comprehensive study of Catholic conversions, but dioceses are reporting increases in the number of converts anywhere between 30 percent to 70 percent since 2020.\n\nThe absolute number of converts isn’t large, but as Vance shows, they can be influential. These people are entering religious communities that have not had many converts in the United States and have historically been associated with specific immigrant ethnic groups, the Irish in the case of Catholicism and the Greeks in the case of Orthodoxy. In fact, American anti-Catholicism has historically been buoyed not only by the centuries-old prejudice of a Protestant society, but also by a bias against foreignness.\n\nThis alignment is (at least in part) because they are both the descendants (ideologically and in some cases quite literally) of America’s English, Dutch, and German Protestant founding stock. These traditions are about believing correctly more than they are about belonging. And, in fact, fundamentally committed to separating out the elect from the community.\n\nOn the other hand, traditionally Catholic and Orthodox communities represent different strands of American history, histories that sideline political identity in the name of big-tent community belonging. Catholicism and Orthodoxy are simply more embedded in their cultural contexts — part and parcel with an ethnic identity — and less ideologically driven than the Enlightenment era-born faith traditions of the US. Within these communities, belonging has been more important than believing correctly. This is not to say that the Pope doesn’t care about theological concerns. It means that your average Catholic grandmother in Spain is less likely to be a Catholic because she feels strongly about the Treasury of Merit than because Catholicism is simply part of who she is.\n\nSo how did someone like Vance, previously most famous for being “an Appalachian,” find his way into a tradition like that?\n\nThe online-to-convert pipeline\n\nThese converts are characterized by a simultaneous search for community and for answers. Nearly everyone recognizes that young men are in crisis. There is widespread disagreement as to why this crisis is happening, but it is difficult not to suspect that a lack of belonging, or rather a pervasive sense of loneliness, is at least part of the problem. Loneliness, and the desire to solve it, seems likely to be part of what drives these men into communities defined by nearly unconditional belonging.\n\nBut belonging is clearly not enough. A lot of young men are looking for answers as well as community. And like lost generations before them, they are finding it in “ideology.” The new converts want their community and their ideology to fit.\n\nWhat does this ideology look like? Many are disillusioned with what they see as the products of “modernity,” specifically the fruits of feminism and, in many cases, the civil rights movement. To their minds, feminism and racial equality have rendered white men — particularly working- and lower-middle-class white men — less socially and economically powerful. As a result, they have turned to “traditionalism,” a worldview that combines conservative views of gender and sexuality with fear of immigration and increasing multiculturalism, often overlaid with back-to-the-land living and large families.\n\nTheir ideal is a white, English-speaking, Christian, American straight couple living on a homestead, raising a dozen children. Its public face online is largely female: the “trad wife” influencers. But make no mistake: Despite its TikTok and Instagram aesthetics, this is primarily a men’s movement. It frames the personal and social crises facing white American men as part of an imagined broader crisis of “Western civilization,” a crisis that, in their view, inevitably includes a “crisis of Christianity” — an idea pushed by no less than the likes of right-wing celebrity Jordan Peterson, the Canadian psychologist turned media pundit.\n\nBut not a crisis of just any Christianity. For many of these young men, the perceived crisis of Christianity and of Western civilization itself has led them to question Protestantism as a whole, from far-right evangelicals to liberal mainline beliefs. If Christendom is in decline, they reason, how can its dominant tradition in American society not be to blame?\n\nThis is shown by the fact that a lot of “trad” content is dedicated to how masculine the respective traditions are. For instance, the Russian Orthodox Church website ran (on its English channel, notably) a piece titled “Why Orthodox Men Love Church.” The piece makes liberal use of the work of Leon Podles, whose work includes The Church Impotent: The Feminization of Christianity and Losing the Good Portion: Why Men Are Alienated from Christianity. And even the relatively liberal, Jesuit-run Catholic magazine America has run an article titled “Men and boys are lost. The Catholic Church can give them a better model of manliness.”\n\nThe “crisis of Protestantism” is a reality that evangelicals themselves have been most apt to acknowledge. There is also the example of Rod Dreher, the Protestant-turned-Catholic-turned-Orthodox convert and American Conservative editor whose book The Benedict Option is premised on the idea that society has devolved so completely that the only choice Christians have is to flee from it.\n\nThis reasoning, combined with what one must imagine is not a little bit of video game and fantasy movie-inspired nostalgia for an imagined Middle Ages, has led many of these young men to Catholicism and others to Eastern Orthodoxy. By converting to these faith traditions, they wrongly think they are converting not only to a liturgically and theologically conservative tradition, but also to an explicitly politically conservative one in the American tradition.\n\nAnd like the rest of the culture surrounding the Lost Young Men of Postmodernity, this religious dimension has taken place largely online, with many of these converts encountering the academic theology of these faith traditions on YouTube, TikTok, and forums, long before they become connected to any living communities. This is very evident this time of year in online Orthodox circles, as converts gather on Facebook and Reddit to discuss the nuances of how to apply medieval fasting rules in a way that would never occur to those from traditionally Orthodox backgrounds. There is also Matt Fradd’s YouTube series Pints With Aquinas that regularly brings obscure Catholic theology to upward of half a million viewers or Rev. Chad Ripperger’s channel Sensus Fidelium, where medieval theology meets anti-vax modernity.\n\nThe mix of obscure academic theology and very modern politics doesn’t stay online. Vance, for example, has cited the influence of the French Catholic philosopher René Girard as an impetus for his own conversion. Vance has also referenced St. Augustine as a major source of his personal theology. And it was to Augustine that he turned to in his spat with the bishops, telling his X followers to “google ‘ordo amoris.’” A request one can only imagine most cradle Catholics (ones born into the faith) responded to with a resounding, “Huh?”\n\nTo save you the internet search, “ordo amoris” is a concept first attributed to Augustine and picked up by St. Thomas Aquinas, who laid out a list of the order in which we should love people and things, starting with God. But Aquinas doesn’t stop there. As the Pope — I know how absurd this sounds — explained in a letter to the American bishops following the clash with Vance, while there is an order in which we should direct our affections, any person’s pressing need should take precedence, so it is not a violation of Catholic teaching to help refugees and the poor.\n\nThis is the way most cradle Catholics probably learned this (perhaps these days sans Latin). Whether Vance was personally aware of the normal way the ordo amoris is taught is irrelevant, because the entire incident demonstrates an important point about these new ideological converts: They have encountered largely medieval theological traditions in a vacuum devoid of community and when they do encounter these living communities, made up of people for whom community is usually much more important than the medieval theology, they are frequently surprised.\n\nThe converts have encountered medieval theological traditions in a vacuum devoid of community and when they do encounter these living communities […] they are frequently surprised.\n\nAnd when this happens the response has not been to change their views — Vance expressed “surprise” at the pushback from the Pope and then doubled down on his position.\n\nThis is not the “done” thing. It is, in fact, a very Protestant way of viewing church hierarchy, whereas one might argue that since the Reformation, Catholicism and Orthodoxy have been defined by a refusal to break from the powers that be. The vice president of the United States and many of his fellow new converts have nonetheless sought to change the views of the hierarchs of institutions they have joined in no small part because of their hierarchical nature — and in doing so remake these organic communities in their own idealized, ideological image.\n\nThis dynamic won’t stay in the church\n\nWhile many are not yet ready to put it in this stark of terms, the “cradle” vs. “convert” divide in Catholicism and Orthodoxy is very real and it can become a problem for those outside the traditions as well as inside. These emerging, highly politicized conflicts inside what were once communities largely bound together by family and cultural ties are only accelerating the political division of American religion.\n\nThis is not a good development for civil society, because houses of worship were places where people once regularly and peacefully encountered those with different political views. Slavery and prohibition did cause schisms but, for the most part, until the middle of the 20th century, American churches were politically diverse. (While Protestantism was about believing correctly, the beliefs in question were nearly always about one’s theological beliefs. Over time, the requirement extended to political beliefs too.) This possibility has already largely vanished within most Protestant circles as evangelicals moved ever more right and mainline Protestants more left over the past 50 years, simply breaking apart (as in the case of the United Methodist Church) when their culture war differences became too grave. Now, largely as a result of these new converts, Catholicism and Orthodoxy are also becoming more polarized.\n\nLaypeople attacking their hierarchs is about the least “trad” thing one can do. It reveals just how little these conversions have to do with anything organic to these traditions, but are instead an act of rebellion against the American mainstream, with a dose of cultural appropriation thrown in.\n\nBut perhaps even more important is the dangerous lesson these converts are learning from their challenges to the hierarchy and cultural traditions of their new faiths: Namely, that even some of the most ancient existent authorities do not have real control over them and that, with enough noise and obfuscation and with enough requests to “Google that,” they can create a version of reality where a recent convert’s opinion of Catholic theology is as valuable as the Pope’s.\n\nThus, when the Pope declares a more kind approach to LGBTQ Catholics, online influencers like Taylor Marshall feel comfortable simply saying the Pope is wrong, that the successor of St. Peter “persecutes the good and promotes evildoers.” Or the pseudo-anonymous writers of the Orthodox Reflections blog can attack the decision of the Greek Orthodox Archbishop of America to march with Black Lives Matter. It’s why Michael Warren Davis, another Orthodox convert at the American Conservative, could directly call the Greek Orthodox Archbishop of America a CIA asset without any evidence.\n\nLaypeople attacking their hierarchs is about the least “trad” thing one can do. It reveals just how little these conversions have to do with anything organic to these traditions, but are instead an act of rebellion against the American mainstream, with a dose of cultural appropriation thrown in.\n\nThis is not just a challenge to the institutional power of the Catholic Church but a reminder of the ways this milieu of young men seeks to challenge authority and to remake our institutions in the image of their ideological aims — the ecclesiastical wing of DOGE’s engineers if you will. It is not a great jump between Vance challenging the Pope on the meaning of St. Augustine to Vance challenging the Constitution on the meaning of citizenship.",

        "content": "DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Wednesday that Israel is establishing a new security corridor across the Gaza Strip to pressure Hamas, suggesting it would cut off the southern city of Rafah, which Israel has ordered evacuated, from the rest of the Palestinian territory.\n\nREAD MORE: Israel’s operations in Gaza expands to seize ‘large areas’ as Palestinians say strikes have killed dozens, including children\n\nThe announcement came after Netanyahu’s defense minister said that Israel would seize large areas of Gaza and add them to its so-called security zones. A wave of Israeli strikes, meanwhile, killed more than 40 Palestinians, including several women and children, according to Palestinian health officials.\n\nIsrael has vowed to escalate the nearly 18-month war with Hamas until the militant group returns dozens of remaining hostages, disarms and leaves the territory. Israel ended a ceasefire in March and has imposed a monthlong halt on all imports of food, fuel and humanitarian aid.\n\nNetanyahu described the new axis as the Morag corridor, using the name of a Jewish settlement that once stood between Rafah and Khan Younis, suggesting it would run between the two southern cities. He said it would be “a second Philadelphi corridor ” referring to the Gaza side of the border with Egypt further south, which has been under Israeli control since last May.\n\nIsrael has also reasserted control over the Netzarim corridor, also named for a former settlement, that cuts off the northern third of Gaza, including Gaza City, from the rest of the narrow coastal strip. Both of the existing corridors run from the Israeli border to the Mediterranean Sea.\n\n“We are cutting up the strip, and we are increasing the pressure step by step, so that they will give us our hostages,” Netanyahu said.\n\nREAD MORE: Wounded children overwhelmed a Gaza hospital as Israeli bombs fell this week\n\nIn northern Gaza, an Israeli airstrike hit a U.N. building in the built-up Jabaliya refugee camp, killing 15 people, including nine children and two women, according to the Indonesian Hospital. The Israeli military said it struck Hamas militants in a command and control center.\n\nThe building, previously a clinic, had been converted into a shelter for displaced people, with more than 700 residing there, according to Juliette Touma, a spokesperson for the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees, the main aid provider in Gaza. No U.N. staff were wounded in the strike.\n\nShe said U.N. staff warned people about the dangers of remaining there after Wednesday’s strike but that many chose to stay, “simply because they have absolutely nowhere else to go.”\n\nU.N. says most of Gaza is a ‘no-go’ zone\n\nMore than 60% of Gaza is now considered a “no-go” zone because of Israeli evacuation orders, according to Olga Cherevko, a spokesperson for the U.N. humanitarian aid office. Hundreds of thousands people are living in squalid tent camps along the coast or in the ruins of their destroyed homes.\n\nIsraeli Defense Minister Israel Katz had earlier said Israel would seize “large areas” and add them to its security zones, apparently referring to an existing buffer zone along Gaza’s entire perimeter. He called on Gaza residents to “expel Hamas and return all the hostages,” saying “this is the only way to end the war.”\n\nOn Sunday, Netanyahu said Israel plans to maintain overall security control of Gaza after the war and implement President Donald Trump’s proposal to resettle much of its population elsewhere through what the Israeli leader referred to as “voluntary emigration.”\n\nPalestinians have rejected the plan, viewing it as expulsion from their homeland after Israel’s offensive left much of it uninhabitable, and human rights experts say implementing the plan would likely violate international law.\n\nREAD MORE: Israeli military orders evacuation of Gaza’s southern city of Rafah\n\nHamas has said it will only release the remaining 59 hostages — 24 of whom are believed to be alive — in exchange for the release of more Palestinian prisoners, a lasting ceasefire and an Israeli pullout. The group has rejected demands that it lay down its arms or leave the territory.\n\nConcern over hostages\n\nThe decision to resume the war has fueled protests in Israel, where many fear it has put the hostages at grave risk and are calling for another ceasefire and exchange with Hamas.\n\nThe Hostage Families Forum, which represents most captives’ families, said they were “horrified to wake up this morning to the Defense Minister’s announcement about expanding military operations in Gaza.”\n\nThe group called on the Trump administration, which took credit for brokering the ceasefire but has supported Israel’s decision to end it, to do everything possible to free the remaining captives.\n\n“Our highest priority must be an immediate deal to bring ALL hostages back home — the living for rehabilitation and those killed for proper burial — and end this war,” the group said.\n\nStrikes kill dozens\n\nIn addition to the 15 killed in northern Gaza, Israeli airstrikes overnight into Wednesday killed another 28 people across the territory, according to local hospitals. The Nasser Hospital in the southern city of Khan Younis said the dead included five women, one of them pregnant, and two children.\n\nIsrael says it targets only militants and makes every effort to spare civilians, blaming Hamas for their deaths because the militants operate in densely populated areas.\n\nThe war began when Hamas-led militants attacked southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing around 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking 251 hostages, most of whom have since been released in ceasefire agreements and other deals. Israel rescued eight living hostages and has recovered dozens of bodies.\n\nIsrael’s offensive has killed more than 50,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry, which doesn’t say whether those killed are civilians or combatants. Israel says it has killed around 20,000 militants, without providing evidence.\n\nThe war has left vast areas of Gaza in ruins and at its height displaced around 90% of the population.\n\nScharf reported from Jerusalem.

Forecasters warned the storms could track over the same areas repeatedly and produce heavy rains and dangerous flash floods capable of sweeping cars away.\n\nRain totaling up to 15 inches (38 centimeters) was forecast over the next seven days in northeastern Arkansas, the southeast corner of Missouri, western Kentucky and southern parts of Illinois and Indiana, the weather service warned.\n\n“We’re potentially looking at about two months of rain in just a handful of days,” Thomas Jones, a weather service meteorologist in Little Rock, Arkansas, said Monday.\n\nParts of Arkansas, west Tennessee, western Kentucky and southern Indiana were at an especially high risk for flooding, the weather service said.\n\nTornado seen in Kansas and more could be coming\n\nAt least one tornado was spotted Tuesday night in Kansas. “Take cover now!” the weather service’s office in Wichita warned residents on the social platform X. No injuries were reported.\n\nAnother tornado touched down in the northeastern Oklahoma city of Owasso about 6:40 a.m. Wednesday, according to the National Weather Service office in Tulsa. There were no immediate reports of injuries, but the twister heavily damaged the roofs of homes and knocked down power lines, trees, fences and sheds.\n\nTornado warnings were also issued in Missouri on Wednesday. Authorities in eastern Missouri were trying to determine whether it was a tornado that damaged buildings, overturned vehicles and tore down utility poles, tree limbs and business signs Wednesday morning in and around Nevada, Missouri.\n\nREAD MORE: 100 years ago this week, nearly 700 people were killed in the deadliest U.S. tornado\n\nThe Missouri State Highway Patrol reported that the damage shut down a portion of U.S. Route 54 in the city of about 8,300 about 95 miles (153 kilometers) south of Kansas City, Missouri.\n\nAlong with tornadoes, high winds with gusts of up to 50 mph (80 kph) were also expected across large parts of the Midwest.\n\nThe ominous forecast comes nearly two years to the day that an EF-3 tornado struck Little Rock, Arkansas. No one was killed, but that twister caused major destruction to neighborhoods and businesses that are still being rebuilt today.\n\nMore than 90 million people are at some risk of severe weather in a huge part of the nation that stretches from Texas to Minnesota and Maine, according to the Oklahoma-based Storm Prediction Center.\n\nStrong and long-lasting tornadoes appear likely in highest-risk area\n\nAbout 2.5 million people are in a rarely-called “high-risk” zone. That area most at risk of catastrophic weather on Wednesday includes parts of west Tennessee including Memphis; northeast Arkansas; the southeast corner of Missouri; and parts of western Kentucky and southern Illinois.\n\nA tornado outbreak was expected Wednesday, and “multiple long-track EF3+ tornadoes, appear likely,” the Storm Prediction Center said. Tornadoes of that magnitude are among the strongest on the Enhanced Fujita scale, used to rate their intensity.\n\nHours before the storms were expected to arrive in the Memphis area and in eastern Arkansas, the National Weather Service reported peak wind gusts of 58 mph (93 kph) in Memphis and 51 mph (82 kph) in Jonesboro, Arkansas.\n\nAt a slightly lower risk for severe weather on Wednesday is an area that includes Chicago, Indianapolis, St. Louis, Louisville, Kentucky, and Little Rock, Arkansas. Dallas, Detroit, Milwaukee, and Nashville, Tennessee, were also at risk.\n\nWintry mix blasts Upper Midwest\n\nIn Michigan, crews worked to restore power after a weekend ice storm toppled trees and power poles. More than 135,000 customers in northern Michigan and 11,000 in northern Wisconsin were still without electricity Wednesday morning, according to PowerOutage.us, which tracks outages nationwide.\n\nSchools in several counties in Michigan’s the mitten-shaped Lower Peninsula have been closed as deputies used chain saws to clear roads and drivers lined up at gas stations. And more wintry weather was on the way: A mix of sleet and freezing rain could keep roads treacherous into Wednesday across parts of Michigan and Wisconsin, the weather service said.\n\nHeavy, wet snow also was forecast into Wednesday across the eastern Dakotas and parts of Minnesota.\n\nAssociated Press writers Sean Murphy in Oklahoma City; Isabella O’Malley in Philadelphia; Ed White in Detroit; Steve Karnowski in Minneapolis; and Hallie Golden in Seattle contributed.",

Our safety will be restored. The scales of justice will be rebalanced.”\n\nTrump claimed “a mandate to completely and totally reverse a horrible betrayal,” promising to “give the people back their faith, their wealth, their democracy and indeed their freedom.”\n\nHe added: “From this moment on, America’s decline is over.”\n\nPBS News, in partnership with DPAN, is offering simultaneous translation of our special coverage in American Sign Language. Watch that livestream below.\n\n\n\nThe executive orders are the first step in what Trump is calling “the complete restoration of America and the revolution of common sense.”\n\nFrigid weather rewrote the pageantry of the day. Trump’s swearing-in was moved indoors to the Capitol Rotunda — the first time that has happened in 40 years — and the inaugural parade was replaced by an event at a downtown arena. Throngs of Trump supporters who descended on the city to watch the inaugural ceremony on the West Front of the Capitol from the National Mall will be left to find somewhere else to view the festivities.\n\nREAD MORE: Your schedule of events for Trump’s 2nd inauguration\n\nAt the Capitol, Vice President JD Vance was sworn-in first, taking the oath read by Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh on a bible given to him by his great-grandmother. Trump followed moments after noon, using both a family bible and the one used by President Abraham Lincoln at his 1861 inauguration as Chief Justice John Roberts administered his oath.\n\nA cadre of billionaires and tech titans — including Mark Zuckerberg, Jeff Bezos, Tim Cook and Sundar Pichai — were given prominent positions in the Capitol Rotunda, mingling with Trump’s incoming team before the ceremony began. Also there was Elon Musk, the world’s richest man, who is expected to lead an effort to slash spending and federal employees.\n\nREAD MORE: 4 things that have changed since Trump’s 1st inauguration\n\nTrump began the day with a prayer service at St. John’s Episcopal Church. He and his wife, Melania, were later greeted at the North Portico of the executive mansion by outgoing President Joe Biden and first lady Jill Biden for the customary tea and coffee reception. It was a stark departure from four years ago, when Trump refused to acknowledge Biden’s victory or attend his inauguration.\n\n“Welcome home,” Biden said to Trump after the president-elect stepped out of the car. The two presidents, who have spent years bitterly criticizing each other, shared a limo on the way to the Capitol.\n\nREAD MORE: How move-in day will work when the Trumps return to the White House\n\nTrump’s inauguration realized a political comeback without precedent in American history. Four years ago, he was voted out of the White House during an economic collapse caused by the deadly COVID-19 pandemic. Trump denied his defeat and tried to cling to power. He directed his supporters to march on the Capitol while lawmakers were certifying the election results, sparking a riot that interrupted the country’s tradition of the peaceful transfer of power.\n\nBut Trump never lost his grip on the Republican Party and was undeterred by criminal cases and two assassination attempts as he steamrolled rivals and harnessed voters’ exasperation with inflation and illegal immigration.\n\nWATCH: Leaders in tech, AI and cryptocurrency make big donations to Trump inauguration\n\n“I am ready for a new United States,” said Cynde Bost, 63, from Lake Havasu City, Arizona.\n\nTrump, in his inaugural address, acknowledged that he was taking office on Martin Luther King Jr. Day, which honors the slain civil rights hero. Trump said, “We will strive together to make his dream a reality,” and he thanked Black and Latino voters for their support in November.\n\nLIVE BLOG: Fact-checking Trump’s 2nd inauguration\n\nNow Trump is the first person convicted of a felony — for falsifying business records related to hush money payments — to serve as president. He pledged to “preserve, protect and defend” the Constitution from the same spot that was overrun by his supporters on Jan. 6, 2021. He’s said that one of his first acts in office will be to pardon many of those who participated in the riot.\n\nEight years after he first entered the White House as a political newcomer, Trump is far more familiar with the operations of federal government and emboldened to bend it to his vision. Trump wants to bring quick change by curtailing immigration, enacting tariffs on imports and rolling back Democrats’ climate and social initiatives.\n\nHe has also promised retribution against his political opponents and critics, and placed personal loyalty as a prime qualification for appointments to his administration.\n\nWith minutes to go before leaving office, Biden issued preemptive pardons to his siblings and their spouses to shield them from the possibility of prosecution. He said in a statement that his family “has been subjected to unrelenting attacks and threats” and that he has “no reason to believe these attacks will end.”\n\nEarlier in the day, Biden took a similar step with current and former government officials who have been the target of Trump’s anger. Biden said “these are exceptional circumstances, and I cannot in good conscience do nothing.”\n\nTrump has pledged to go further and move faster in enacting his agenda than during his first term, and already the country’s political, business and technology leaders have realigned themselves to accommodate Trump.\n\nDemocrats who once formed a “resistance” are now divided over whether to work with Trump or defy him. Billionaires have lined up to meet with Trump as they acknowledge his unrivaled power in Washington and his ability to wield the levers of government to help or hurt their interests.\n\nLong skeptical of American alliances, Trump’s “America First” foreign policy is being watched warily at home and abroad as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine will soon enter its third year, and a fragile ceasefire appears to be holding in Gaza after more than 15 months of war between Israel and Hamas.\n\nAlso present will be the head of TikTok, the popular Chinese-owned social media app deemed a national security risk by the U.S. Trump has promised to lift an effective ban on TikTok through one of many executive orders expected to be issued on Monday as the new president attempts to show quick progress.\n\nTrump is planning to swiftly reinstitute his 2020 playbook to crackdown on the southern border — again declaring a national emergency, limiting the number of refugees entering the U.S. and deploying the military. He’s expected to take additional actions — including constitutionally questionable ones — such as attempting to end birthright citizenship automatically bestowed on people born in the U.S.\n\nTrump will also sign an executive order aimed at ending diversity, equity and inclusion programs within the federal government. The order will direct federal agencies to coordinate with the White House on identifying and terminating DEI programs. Conservatives have long criticized programs that give preference based on race, gender and sexual orientation, arguing they violate the Constitution.\n\nOthers orders are expected to allow more oil and gas drilling by rolling back Biden-era policies on domestic energy production and rescind Biden’s recent directive on artificial intelligence.\n\nMore changes are planned for the federal workforce. Trump wants to unwind diversity, equity and inclusion programs known as DEI, require employees to come back to the office and lay the groundwork to reduce staff.\n\nWith control of Congress, Republicans are also working alongside the incoming administration on legislation that will further roll back Biden’s policies and institute their own priorities.\n\n— Zeke Miller, Chris Megerian and Michelle L.

        "source": "https://www.pbs.org/newshour/",
        "content": "WASHINGTON (AP) — Senate Republicans are facing pressure Wednesday from President Donald Trump to oppose a Democratic resolution that would nullify the presidential emergency on fentanyl he is using to implement tariffs on Canada.\n\nWatch the Senate proceedings in our player above.\n\nJust hours after Trump announced his plan for import taxes on a slew of international trading partners — his so-called “Liberation Day” — the Senate was expected to vote on a resolution that offers Republicans an off-ramp to the import taxes on Canada.\n\nWATCH: Trump announces broad tariffs at ‘Liberation Day’ White House event\n\nAlthough Trump’s order spared for now Canadian imports from new taxes, the Senate resolution is a significant test for Republican loyalty to Trump’s vision of remaking the U.S. economy by clamping down on free trade. Many economists are warning that the plan could cause an economic contraction, and GOP senators are already watching with unease as Trump upends U.S. standing with the rest of the world.\n\nThe votes of at least four Republicans — Sens. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Susan Collins of Maine, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky and Rand Paul of Kentucky — were thought to be lining up in favor of the resolution. If all Democrats plus the four Republicans vote in favor, it would boost it to the simple majority needed to pass the Senate. The legislation would still need to be brought up and passed in the Republican-controlled House.\n\nIn a social media post just before 1 a.m. Wednesday, Trump singled out the four senators, saying they “will hopefully get on the Republican bandwagon, for a change, and fight the Democrats wild and flagrant push to not penalize Canada for the sale, into our Country, of large amounts of Fentanyl.”\n\nTo justify the tariffs, Trump has argued that Canada is not doing enough to stop illegal drugs from entering the northern border. Customs and Border Protection seized 43 pounds of fentanyl in its northern border sector during the 2024 fiscal year, and since January, authorities have seized less than 1.5 pounds, according to federal data. Meanwhile, at the southern border, authorities seized over 21,000 pounds last year.\n\n“This is not about fentanyl. It’s about tariffs. It’s about a national sales tax on American families,” Sen. Tim Kaine, the Virginia Democrat who initiated the resolution, said at at news conference Wednesday.\n\nDemocrats are arguing that Trump is using the tariffs to pay for tax cuts that would benefit the wealthy, but will make it more expensive to build homes, disrupt industries and raise prices on imported grocery products. Kaine pointed to aluminum imported from Canada that is used by businesses ranging from pie makers to shipbuilders.\n\n“Today, Donald Trump takes a sledgehammer to the American economy and even to the American dream,” Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said in a floor speech.\n\nOn the heels of election results in Wisconsin and Florida that delivered early warning signs to Republicans about the popularity of Trump’s agenda, Schumer said that Trump is particularly vulnerable when it comes to the economy.\n\n“Once the American people say, ‘I don’t want to embrace somebody, I don’t want to vote for somebody, I don’t want to support somebody who embraces Trump’s policies,’ things are going to change,” he told reporters. “Public sentiment is everything.”\n\nAt the White House Wednesday, Trump singled out Canada as a beneficiary of “unfair” trading practices with the U.S., though his latest order did not add to tariffs already in place on Canada and Mexico.\n\n“Why are we doing this? I mean, at what point do we say, ‘You’ve got to work for yourselves and you’ve got to’? This is why we have the big deficits,” Trump said.\n\nFor their part, Republican leaders were trying to hold their members in line against the tariff resolution by emphasizing that Trump was acting to address fentanyl trafficking and border security.\n\nMajority Whip Sen. John Barrasso argued in a floor speech that former President Joe Biden had “also thrown open the northern border. The criminal cartels noticed and they took advantage.”\n\n“There are unique threats to the United States at our northern border,” the Wyoming senator said. “President Trump is taking the bold, decisive, swift action that is necessary to secure that border as well.”\n\nRepublicans lined up on the Senate floor Wednesday afternoon to underscore the need to act to halt fentanyl trafficking, including at the northern border. However, a key group of Senate Republicans was also indicating opposition to tariffs on Canada.\n\nIn a floor speech Wednesday, Collins said she would support the resolution and noted, “The fact is the vast majority of fentanyl in America comes from the southern border.”\n\nCollins noted that Canada is already beefing up border security to address drug trafficking and said she was concerned what tariffs would do to businesses and households in Maine. She pointed to a paper mill in her home state that pumps paper pulp from Canada.\n\n“A tariff placed on this pulp would jeopardize the financial wellbeing of this vital paper mill, which employs more than 500 people in rural, northern Maine. There is not another big employer in that area that can possibly compensate for the loss of those 510 direct jobs,” Collins said.\n\nPaul, a Kentucky Republican who often supports libertarian economic views, also spoke in favor of the resolution, arguing that the president should not be given unilateral authority to impose taxes on imports.\n\n“Every dollar collected in tariff revenue comes straight out of the pockets of American consumers,” he said. “Conservatives used to understand that tariffs are taxes on the American people. Conservatives used to be uniformly opposed to raising taxes because we wanted the private marketplace, the private individuals to keep more of their income.”\n\nWhile a younger group of Republicans closely aligned with Trump have spoken out in favor of the president’s plans to aggressively reshape the economy, a sizeable portion of the Republican Conference noted concerns about the tariff impacts on farmers and other industries. Still, most wanted to give Trump room to negotiate better trade deals.\n\nNorth Dakota Sen. Kevin Cramer said that he has been in constant talks with both Canadian officials and businesses in his state like Bobcat, which does a significant amount of its sales in Canada. But he didn’t plan on supporting the resolution. Instead, he hoped that Trump’s Wednesday announcement would just be a starting point for negotiations for the reciprocal dropping of tariffs.\n\nThe Republican added: “I’m not overly concerned about it, but obviously it occupies a lot of attention and time and a lot of political anxiety.”\n\nAssociated Press writer Kevin Freking contributed reporting.",

        "content": "WASHINGTON (AP) — The Supreme Court appeared divided Wednesday over whether states should be able cut off Medicaid funding to Planned Parenthood, a case that comes amid a wider push from abortion opponents to defund the nation’s leading abortion provider.\n\nListen to the arguments in the player above.\n\nLow-income patients who go there for things like contraception, cancer screenings and pregnancy testing could see their care upended if the court sides with South Carolina leaders who say no public money should go the organization.\n\nThe court is considering a legal question that could have wider effects: Whether Medicaid patients can continue to sue over the right to choose their own qualified provider.\n\nREAD MORE: Trump asks Supreme Court for permission to resume deporting Venezuelan migrants under wartime law\n\nSouth Carolina says those lawsuits aren’t allowed and barring them would save public money in legal fees. Some conservatives appeared open to that argument, with Justice Brett Kavanaugh saying there has been confusion among lower courts. “One of my goals coming out of this will be to revive that clarity,” Kavanaugh said.\n\nThe state says people could go through an administrative appeal process if denied coverage, though Justice Amy Coney Barrett raised questions about whether that would work for low-income patients who’d have to risk paying out of pocket before they could appeal for reimbursement.\n\nPlanned Parenthood argues Congress clearly wanted people to be able to make their own “intensely personal” decisions about which doctor to visit, and lawsuits are the only real way that right has been enforced.\n\nJustice Elena Kagan agreed that patients do have the right to choose their doctor under the law, and suggested that blocking them from suing would be a sea change. “This is kind of changing the rules midstream, isn’t it?” Kagan said.\n\nPeople on both sides of the issue gathered outside the court for demonstrations that included a brass band before arguments unfolded.\n\nThe case started in 2018, before the court’s decision that overturned the nationwide right to abortion. South Carolina has since banned it after around six weeks’ gestation.\n\nFederal law prohibits Medicaid money from being used for abortions, with very limited exceptions, but patients often go there for other services because it can be tough to find doctors who accept the publicly funded insurance program and can schedule appointments quickly.\n\nOther conservative states have also moved to cut Planned Parenthood out of the Medicaid program, and more would likely follow if South Carolina prevails.\n\nAbout one-quarter of everyone in the U.S. is enrolled in the program, and the American Cancer Society has said that losing the ability to sue would hurt their access to care, especially in rural areas.\n\nIn South Carolina, $90,000 in Medicaid funding goes to Planned Parenthood every year — a tiny fraction of a percentage point of the state’s total Medicaid spending.",

        "source": "https://www.pbs.org/newshour/",
        "content": "WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump on Wednesday announced far-reaching new tariffs on nearly all U.S. trading partners — a 34 percent tax on imports from China and 20 percent on the European Union, among others — that threaten to dismantle much of the architecture of the global economy and trigger broader trade wars.\n\nWatch Trump’s remarks in the player above.\n\nTrump, in a Rose Garden announcement, said he was placing elevated tariff rates on dozens of nations that run meaningful trade surpluses with the United States, while imposing a 10 percent baseline tax on imports from all countries in response to what he called an economic emergency.\n\nThe president, who said the tariffs were designed to boost domestic manufacturing, used aggressive rhetoric to describe a global trade system that the United States helped to build after World War II, saying “our country has been looted, pillaged, raped and plundered” by other nations.\n\nThe action amounts to a historic tax hike that could push the global order to a breaking point. It kickstarts what could be a painful transition for many Americans as middle-class essentials such as housing, autos and clothing are expected to become more costly, while disrupting the alliances built to ensure peace and economic stability.\n\nWATCH: Examining Trump’s claims that tariffs will revitalize American manufacturing\n\nTrump said he was acting to bring in hundreds of billions in new revenue to the U.S. government and restore fairness to global trade.\n\n“Taxpayers have been ripped off for more than 50 years,” he said. “But it is not going to happen anymore.”\n\nTrump declared a national economic emergency to levy the tariffs. He has promised that factory jobs will return to the United States as a result of the taxes, but his policies risk a sudden economic slowdown as consumers and businesses could face sharp price hikes.\n\nTrump was fulfilling a key campaign promise as he imposed what he called “reciprocal” tariffs on trade partners, acting without Congress under the 1977 International Emergency Powers Act. But his action Wednesday could jeopardize Trump’s voter mandate in last year’s election to combat inflation. Several Republican senators, particularly from farm and border states, have questioned the wisdom of the tariffs. U.S. stock market futures sold off sharply overnight in anticipation of the economy weakening, after having already dropped since the start of this year.\n\n“With today’s announcement, U.S. tariffs will approach levels not seen since the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930, which incited a global trade war and deepened the Great Depression,” said Scott Lincicome and Colin Grabow of the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank.\n\nThe president’s higher rates would hit foreign entities that sell more goods to the United States than they buy, meaning the tariffs could stay in place for some time as the administration expects other nations to lower their tariffs and other barriers to trade that it says led to a $1.2 trillion trade imbalance last year.\n\nThe new tariffs will come on top of recent announcements of 25 percent taxes on auto imports; levies against China, Canada and Mexico; and expanded trade penalties on steel and aluminum. Trump has also imposed tariffs on countries that import oil from Venezuela and he plans separate import taxes on pharmaceutical drugs, lumber, copper and computer chips.\n\nCanada and Mexico would not face higher rates on what they’re already being charged by Trump in what he says is an effort to stop illegal immigration and drug smuggling. As of now, goods that comply with the USMCA North American trade pact would be excluded from those tariffs.\n\nBut the 20 percent charged on imports from China due its role in fentanyl production would largely be added to the 34 percent announced by Trump. The specific products that Trump is tariffing, such as autos, would be exempt from the tariffs unveiled Wednesday, as would products such as pharmaceutical drugs that he plans to tariff at a later date.\n\nThreats of backlash\n\nNone of the warning signs about a falling stock market or consumer sentiment turning morose have caused the administration to publicly second-guess its strategy, despite the risk of political backlash.\n\nSenior administration officials, who insisted on anonymity to preview the new tariffs with reporters ahead of Trump’s speech, said the taxes would raise hundreds of billions of dollars annually in revenues. They said the 10 percent baseline rate existed to help ensure compliance, while the higher rates were based on the trade deficits run with other nations and then halved to reach the numbers that Trump presented in the Rose Garden.\n\nThe 10 percent rate would be collected starting Saturday and the higher rates would be collected beginning April 9.\n\nTrump removed the tariff exemptions on imports from China worth $800 or less. He plans to remove the exemptions other nations have on imports worth $800 or less once the federal government certifies that is has the staffing and resources in place.\n\nBased on the possibility of broad tariffs that have been floated by some White House aides, most outside analyses by banks and think tanks see an economy tarnished by higher prices and stagnating growth.\n\nTrump would be applying these tariffs on his own; he has ways of doing so without congressional approval. That makes it easy for Democratic lawmakers and policymakers to criticize the administration if the uncertainty expressed by businesses and declining consumer sentiment are signs of trouble to come.\n\nWATCH: Businesses brace for Trump’s new tariffs while Senate Democrats try to push back\n\nRep. Suzan DelBene, D-Wash., said the tariffs are “part of the chaos and dysfunction” being generated across the Trump administration. The chair of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee stressed that Trump should not have the sole authority to raise taxes as he intends without getting lawmakers’ approval, saying that Republicans so far have been “blindly loyal.”\n\n“The president shouldn’t be able to do that,” DelBene said. “This is a massive tax increase on American families, and it’s without a vote in Congress. … President Trump promised on the campaign trail that he would lower costs on day one. Now he says he doesn’t care if prices go up — he’s broken his promise.”\n\nEven Republicans who trust Trump’s instincts have acknowledged that the tariffs could disrupt an economy with an otherwise healthy 4.1 percent unemployment rate.\n\n“We’ll see how it all develops,” said House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La. “It may be rocky in the beginning. But I think that this will make sense for Americans and help all Americans.”\n\nAllies brace themselves\n\nLongtime trading partners are preparing their own countermeasures. Canada has imposed some in response to the tariffs that Trump tied to the trafficking of fentanyl. The European Union, in response to the steel and aluminum tariffs, put taxes on 26 billion euros ($28 billion) worth of U.S. goods, including on bourbon, which prompted Trump to threaten a 200 percent tariff on European alcohol.\n\nMany allies feel they have been reluctantly drawn into a confrontation by Trump, who routinely says America’s friends and foes have essentially ripped off the United States with a mix of tariffs and other trade barriers.\n\nThe flip side is that Americans also have the incomes to choose to buy designer gowns by French fashion houses and autos from German manufacturers, whereas World Bank data show the EU has lower incomes per capita than the U.S.\n\nThe Chinese government delivered a measured response to the new tariffs, saying in a statement: “China believes that protectionism leads nowhere, and trade and tariff wars have no winners. This has been widely recognized in the international community.”\n\nItaly’s conservative Premier Giorgia Meloni said Trump’s new tariffs against the EU were “wrong” and Italy would work toward an agreement with the United States to avoid a trade war that would weaken all involved.\n\nBasic Fun CEO Jay Foreman, whose company is behind such classic toys as Tonka trucks, Lincoln Logs and Care Bears, has been working hard to come up with new ways to cut tariff-related costs like reduce packaging and eliminate batteries with the products.\n\nBut Trump’s announcement that he plans a 34 percent increase in tariffs on Chinese imports has solidified his decision to hike prices. Most of the company’s toys are made in China. He said the Tonka Mighty Dump Truck will go from $29.99 to $39.99 this holiday season, possibly even $45.\n\n“There is no other way,” he said.\n\nAssociated Press writers Anne D’Innocenzio in New York, Sylvie Corbet in Paris and Lisa Mascaro in Washington contributed to this report.",

        "source": "https://www.pbs.org/newshour/",
        "content": "The measles outbreak that started in Texas in late January continues to grow. As of March 27, 2025, confirmed cases across the United States reached 483, surpassing the total number of confirmed cases recorded in 2024. About 93 percent of the cases are associated with the outbreak, which now spans Texas, New Mexico and Oklahoma.\n\nWATCH: What’s behind the growing measles outbreak and how the Trump administration is responding\n\nThe vast majority of cases are in people who are not vaccinated. Meanwhile, a lack of clarity from health authorities is leaving people with questions about whether they need to get revaccinated.\n\nIn a Q&A with The Conversation U.S., Daniel Pastula, a neurologist and medical epidemiologist from the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus and Colorado School of Public Health, explained how and when you should take action.\n\nShould adults get another shot of the measles vaccine?\n\nThe measles vaccine, which first became available in the U.S. in 1963, contains a live but significantly weakened strain of the measles virus. This modified strain is too weak to cause measles, but it is similar enough to the wild type measles virus to train the immune system to recognize it. Most people who have received the live measles vaccine won’t need an additional shot now, but here is what you need to know:\n\nPeople born before 1957 are presumed to have lifelong immunity because measles was so contagious that almost everyone contracted it before age 15. Unless there are special circumstances, they probably don’t need a vaccine now.\n\nMost people born after 1957 would have received the shot as children, so they should be set for life. Physicians and public health experts don’t recommend most people in this group get a second measles shot, though there are exceptions.\n\nIn 1989, a limited outbreak of measles occurred among vaccinated school children. In response, the recommendations changed from one dose of the live measles vaccine to two doses for children. People fully vaccinated as children after that year do not need any additional doses.\n\nExceptions to these guidelines\n\nThere are two special circumstances where the previous recommendations may not hold.\n\nFirst, if you were vaccinated between 1963 and 1967, one of the measles vaccines available at the time consisted of just proteins from the virus rather than a live, weakened version of it. Researchers soon realized this inactivated, or “killed,” vaccine was less effective and didn’t provide long-term immunity. Unless you know for certain you received the live vaccine, physicians and public health experts recommend that people vaccinated during those years get one dose of the live vaccine at some point.\n\nSecond, if you fall into a high-risk group – for example, if you are a health care provider, are traveling internationally or attending college, physicians and public health experts generally recommend getting a second dose if you have only had one.\n\nFor most adults without such risk factors, physicians and public health experts do not routinely recommend a second dose if you have previously received one dose of a live measles vaccine. If you have questions or concerns about your situation, make sure to ask your health care provider.\n\nExcept in very rare circumstances, there is no recommendation for a third dose of the measles vaccine.\n\nCan you find out whether you’ve been vaccinated?\n\nYou might be able to! It’s worth checking. States actually keep vaccine records specifically for this reason, where you can look up your vaccine records or that of your kids. Your high school or college may still have your records, and so might your pediatrician’s office.\n\nShould you get your antibody levels checked?\n\nFor most people, probably not.\n\nA titer test checks the level of antibodies in your blood, and some people are asking their doctor to check their titers to determine whether they are still immune to measles. The problem is, the level of antibodies in your blood does not necessarily reflect your level of immunity. That’s because antibodies are just one part of your immune system’s infection-fighting force. Having a low level of antibodies does not necessarily mean your immunity has waned.\n\nOther crucial elements of your immune response include B cells, T cells and other immune cells, but a titer test does not show their capabilities. For example, memory B cells might not currently be making antibodies against the virus but are primed to quickly do so the next time they see it. This is why antibody and titer tests should be used only in specific cases, in consultation with your doctor.\n\nOne example of when an antibody test may be warranted is if you are a health care provider born before 1957 and you want to make sure you don’t need another dose of the vaccine. You would use a test to see whether you have measles antibodies. But in this case you would be looking for a yes or no answer; the total amount of antibodies may not be very informative.\n\nIs natural immunity better than vaccine-induced immunity?\n\nNatural immunity – that is, the immunity you get after having measles – is effective. However, the downside is that natural infection with a wild virus is very risky. Before 1963, measles caused close to 50,000 hospitalizations and about 500 deaths each year in the United States, usually in children. It also caused over 1,000 cases of severe brain inflammation every year and carried several other long-term risks, such as permanent hearing loss or the wipe out of immunity to other diseases.\n\nREAD MORE: What to know about highly contagious measles and how to protect yourself\n\nThe point of vaccines is to create immunity without the risks of severe infection. It is basically a dress rehearsal for the real thing. The immunity from a vaccine is effectively the same immunity you get from having measles itself – but vastly safer than encountering the wild virus unprotected. One dose is 93 percent effective at preventing measles and two doses are 97 percent effective, and any breakthrough cases are likely to be much milder than a full-blown case of measles.\n\nCan the vaccine cause measles?\n\nNo, the measles vaccine cannot cause measles because it contains a significantly weakened strain that has limited ability to infect and damage cells.\n\nSome have claimed without evidence that the current outbreak in Texas was caused by the measles vaccine.\n\nREAD MORE: Measles cases are rising in the U.S. Here’s why misinformation about the vaccine persists today\n\nAs part of the outbreak investigation, however, CDC and the Texas Department of State Health Services analyzed the genome of the virus causing the current outbreak and identified it as a wild measles virus. Researchers classify measles virus strains based on their genetic characteristics, or genotypes. They identified the outbreak virus as wild type genotype D8, and not the weakened measles vaccine strain, which is genotype A.\n\n\n\nMeasles vaccination has worked so well that many people today have never seen a measles case.\n\nWhat are the risks of the vaccine?\n\nThat is a very reasonable question. Because the measles vaccine is a live, weakened virus strain, it can cause a mild, measles-like syndrome. For example, some people might have a slight fever, a rash, or some slight joint pain. These symptoms generally go away in a day or two, and most people don’t experience them. But the vaccine cannot cause measles itself, as it does not contain the wild measles virus.\n\nIn extremely rare cases, people can experience more significant reactions to the measles vaccine. It is important to remember that every single medical or health intervention carries risks – and that includes all medications and over-the-counter supplements. According to all available evidence, however, comparing the potential benefits against potential risks reveals that the risks of a signficant reaction to the vaccine are much lower than the risks of severe outcomes from measles itself.\n\nBeing vaccinated not only protects you and your family, but it also protects vulnerable people in the community, such as infants, cancer patients and pregnant women, who cannot be vaccinated themselves.\n\nThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

        "content": "WASHINGTON (AP) — Amazon has put in a bid to purchase TikTok, a Trump administration official said Wednesday, in an eleventh-hour pitch as a U.S. ban on the platform is set to go into effect Saturday.\n\nThe official, who was not authorized to comment publicly and spoke on the condition of anonymity, said the Amazon offer was made in a letter to Vice President JD Vance and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick.\n\nThe New York Times first reported on the bid.\n\nPresident Donald Trump on Inauguration Day gave the platform a reprieve, barreling past a law that had been upheld unanimously by the Supreme Court, which said the ban was necessary for national security.\n\nREAD MORE: Why no one is challenging Trump’s executive order that keeps TikTok online in the U.S.\n\nUnder the law, TikTok’s Chinese-owned parent company ByteDance is required to sell the platform to an approved buyer or take it offline in the United States. Trump has suggested he could further extend the pause on the ban, but he has also said he expects a deal to be forged by Saturday.\n\nAmazon declined to comment. TikTok did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe existence of an Amazon bid surfaced as Trump was scheduled on Wednesday to meet with senior officials to discuss the coming deadline for a TikTok sale.\n\nAlthough it’s unclear if ByteDance plans to sell TikTok, several possible bidders have come forward in the past few months. Among the possible investors are the software company Oracle and the investment firm Blackstone. Oracle announced in 2020 that it had a 12.5 percent stake in TikTok Global after securing its business as the app’s cloud technology provider.\n\nIn January, the artificial intelligence startup Perplexity AI presented ByteDance with a merger proposal that would combine Perplexity’s business with TikTok’s U.S. operation. Last month, the company outlined its approach to rebuilding TikTok in a blog post, arguing that it is “singularly positioned to rebuild the TikTok algorithm without creating a monopoly.”\n\n“Any acquisition by a consortium of investors could in effect keep ByteDance in control of the algorithm, while any acquisition by a competitor would likely create a monopoly in the short form video and information space,” Perplexity said in its post.\n\nThe company said it would remake the TikTok algorithm and ensure that infrastructure would be developed and maintained in “American data centers with American oversight, ensuring alignment with domestic privacy standards and regulations.”\n\nOther potential bidders include a consortium organized by billionaire businessman Frank McCourt, which recently recruited Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian as a strategic adviser. Investors in the consortium say they’ve offered ByteDance $20 billion in cash for TikTok’s U.S. platform. Jesse Tinsley, the founder of the payroll firm Employer.com, says he too has organized a consortium and is offering ByteDance more than $30 billion for the platform. Wyoming small business owner Reid Rasner has also announced that he offered ByteDance roughly $47.5 billion.\n\nBoth the FBI and the Federal Communications Commission have warned that ByteDance could share user data — such as browsing history, location and biometric identifiers — with China’s authoritarian government. TikTok said it has never done that and would not do so if asked. The U.S. government has not provided evidence of that happening.\n\nTrump has millions of followers on TikTok and has credited the trendsetting platform with helping him gain traction among young voters.\n\nDuring his first term, he took a more skeptical view of TikTok and issued executive orders banning dealings with ByteDance as well as the owners of the Chinese messaging app WeChat.\n\nParvini reported from Los Angeles.",

        "content": "PEWAUKEE, Wis. (AP) — As the first news outlets began calling the Wisconsin Supreme Court election for the liberal candidate Susan Crawford, her opponent called her — to concede.\n\nMinutes later Tuesday night, the conservative-backed Brad Schimel took the stage at his watch party to acknowledge the loss. Angry yells broke out. One woman began to chant about his opponent: “Cheater.”\n\nSchimel didn’t hesitate. “No,” he responded. “You’ve got to accept the results.” Later, he returned to the stage with his classic rock cover band to jam on his bass.\n\nWATCH: Wisconsin Supreme Court election highlights deep political divides in battleground state\n\nIn any other American era, Schimel’s concession wouldn’t be considered unusual – except maybe the guitar part. But it stands out at a time when the nation’s politics have opened a fissure between those who trust election results and those who don’t.\n\n“It shouldn’t be super laudable,” said Jeff Mandel, general counsel of the Madison-based liberal law firm Law Forward. “But given where we are and given what we’ve seen over the past few years nationwide and in Wisconsin, it is laudable.”\n\nAccusations of cheating are common now\n\nOver the past several years, numerous Republicans — and some Democrats — have lobbed unfounded accusations of voter fraud, harassed election officials and pointed to “irregularities” to dispute their election losses. President Donald Trump led that movement in 2020, when he filed lawsuits in battleground states, including one thrown out by the Wisconsin Supreme Court, seeking to overturn his loss to Democrat Joe Biden.\n\nSchimel’s concession of that very same court to a liberal majority, though in line with what generations of candidates have done in the past, was not a given in today’s divisive atmosphere.\n\nOnstage, as his supporters yelled, Schimel shook his head and left no uncertainty he’d lost — a result that would become even clearer later in the night as Crawford’s lead grew to around 10 percentage points.\n\n“The numbers aren’t going to — aren’t going to turn around,” he told the crowd. “They’re too bad, and we’re not going to pull this off.”\n\nBy acknowledging his loss quickly, Schimel curtailed the kind of explanation-seeking and digital digging that erupted online after Trump, a Republican, lost the 2020 presidential election, with citizen journalists falsely accusing innocent election workers and voters of fraud.\n\nSchimel also avoided the impulses to which many in his party have defaulted in recent elections across the country, as they’ve dragged their feet to avoid accepting defeat.\n\nREAD MORE: Wisconsin and Florida special elections provide early warning signs to Trump, Republicans\n\nLast fall, Wisconsin Republican Eric Hovde spent days sowing doubt in the results after he lost a Senate race to Democrat Tammy Baldwin. He conceded nearly two weeks after Election Day, saying he did not want to “add to political strife through a contentious recount” even as he raised debunked election conspiracies.\n\nIn a 2024 state Supreme Court race in North Carolina, two recounts have affirmed Democrat Allison Riggs narrowly won the election, but her Republican opponent, Jefferson Griffin, is still seeking to reverse the outcome by having ballots thrown out.\n\nTrump also has continued to falsely claim he won the 2020 presidential election, even though there was no evidence of widespread fraud and the results were confirmed through multiple recounts, reviews and audits. His close adviser, billionaire Elon Musk, has also spread a flurry of unfounded claims about voter fraud involving noncitizens.\n\nMusk and his affiliated groups sank at least $21 million into the Wisconsin Supreme Court race, and he personally paid three voters $1 million each for signing a petition to boost turnout. He had said the race was central to the “future of America and Western civilization.”\n\nBut after the results came in, he said he “expected to lose” and touted the successful passage of a voter ID amendment in Wisconsin’s Constitution. Trump, who had endorsed Schimel, didn’t post about the loss but used his Truth Social platform to celebrate the voter ID win.\n\nAn assessment: ‘That’s democracy’\n\nNot all Republicans watching the race were in a magnanimous mood as they processed the results. Peter Bernegger, the head of an election integrity organization who has brought numerous lawsuits against Wisconsin election clerks and offices, raised the specter that an “algorithm” was behind Crawford’s win. InfoWars founder and conspiracy theorist Alex Jones reacted to the results on X, saying, “Election fraud should be investigated.”\n\nBut at Schimel’s watch party, several supporters applauded his high road.\n\n“He was all class,” said Russell Jones, a 51-year-old attorney. “That’s how you lose.”\n\nAdam Manka, of the La Crosse County Republican Party, said he worries about how a liberal court could redraw the state’s congressional districts. “But you can’t exactly change it,” Manka said, calling Schimel “very graceful” in his defeat. “This is democracy.”\n\nThe moment is a good example for future candidates, said Ari Mittleman, executive director of the Wisconsin-based nonprofit Keep Our Republic, which aims to rebuild trust and confidence in elections. He compared elections to a Green Bay Packers football game: “We know who won, we know who lost.” He said he thinks Schimel, a lifelong Wisconsinite, understands that.\n\n“It’s transparent, and we accept the final score,” Mittleman said. “That’s democracy.”\n\nSchimel and his band, performing for a thinning crowd Tuesday night, took the loss in stride.\n\n“Can you ask them at the bar to get me a Coors Light please?” Schimel said between songs. “Put it on my tab.”\n\nAssociated Press writer Scott Bauer contributed from Madison, Wis.

        "source": "https://www.pbs.org/newshour/",
        "content": "WASHINGTON (AP) — DOGE’s days appear to be numbered.\n\nElon Musk recently suggested that he will be done with his work in the near future. President Donald Trump told reporters this week that “at some point, he’s going to be going back” to running his companies. As far as the Department of Government Efficiency, Trump said “it will end.”\n\nAll of that talk was before Musk faced a setback Tuesday in Wisconsin, where voters rejected his choice for a state Supreme Court candidate despite more than $21 million in personal donations and his campaign appearance over the weekend. There are more problems for the billionaire entrepreneur at Tesla, his electric automaker, which saw a 13% drop in sales in the first three months of the year.\n\nThe White House has not disclosed any clear timeline for closing down DOGE, and the government cost-cutting organization was never supposed to become a permanent fixture in Washington. But it could be reaching a conclusion faster than anticipated. DOGE was originally intended to operate until July 4, 2026.\n\nNow there are signs that it already is winding down. DOGE employees have been shifted to various federal agencies, which are supposed to take the lead on cutting costs. Government-wide layoffs are underway to accomplish some of the goals laid out by Musk and Trump.\n\n“We think probably over the next two or three months, we’ll be pretty much satisfied with the people that are working hard and want to be members of the administration,” Trump said last week.\n\nThe potential end of DOGE does not mean Trump will stop shaking up Washington. But it appears the administration’s efforts will be entering a new phase that is less focused on Musk, whose chain saw-wielding work as a presidential adviser made him a political lightning rod.\n\nDOGE was initially envisioned as an independent advisory panel, with Musk sharing leadership with Vivek Ramaswamy, a biotech entrepreneur. Ramaswamy dropped out and is running for Ohio governor, and DOGE became part of the government. It was stocked with Musk’s allies, who were dispatched throughout the bureaucracy to cancel contracts, access sensitive data and push for cuts.\n\nMusk presumably has a ticking clock on his tenure. He was hired as a special government employee, which means he can only work 130 days in a 365-day time period.\n\nREAD MORE: Tesla sales tumble as Musk backlash, competition and aging lineup turn off buyers\n\n“I think we will have accomplished most of the work required to reduce the deficit by a trillion dollars within that time frame,” Musk told Bret Baier of Fox News on March 27. So far DOGE is well short of that target, according to its own calculations, which have been criticized as inflated and inaccurate.\n\nMusk did not commit to leaving the administration by any particular date, and it is unclear how the administration is tracking Musk’s time. On May 30, it will be 130 days since Trump’s inauguration on Jan. 20.\n\nTrump told reporters on Monday in the Oval Office that “I’d keep him as long as I could keep him” and “he’s a very talented guy.”\n\nThe Republican president was known for explosive breakups with top advisers during his first term, but anyone hoping for such a split with Musk has been disappointed.\n\n“I think he’s amazing, but I also think he’s got a big company to run,” Trump said. “And so, at some point, he’s going to be going back.”\n\nAsked if DOGE would continue without Musk, Trump demurred. He said Cabinet officials have worked closely with Musk and may keep some of the DOGE people at their agencies.\n\n“But at a certain point I think it will end,” Trump said.\n\nMusk’s poll numbers lag behind Trump’s, which Democrats believe they were able to use to their advantage in Wisconsin.\n\nSusan Crawford defeated Brad Schimel, who Musk supported, and ensured the state Supreme Court’s liberal majority.\n\nIn the closing days of that campaign, Musk described the race as “important for the future of civilization.” He struck a different tone afterward.\n\n“I expected to lose, but there is value to losing a piece for a positional gain,” Musk wrote on X at 3:13 a.m.",

They said that if you wanted to participate in the title X program, you could not offer abortion services, nor could you refer patients to abortion services.\n\nOf course, federal dollars are not allowed to be used for abortion services, with very limited exceptions for rape and incest and if the pregnant woman's life is in danger. But, nonetheless, when these rules were put into place by the Trump administration in its first term, in 2019, the entire Planned Parenthood network left Title X, along with many, many other Title X clinics.\n\nWhen the Biden administration came in, they actually reversed those rules. And, so, many people — many clinics came back in. They reconstituted the Title X clinic. I think it's clear from these letters that went to Planned Parenthood, everyone from the organization that runs the program in California, in Mississippi, in Maine, that they didn't want to necessarily take that amount of time that was going to take to do all the rulemaking.\n\nSo this was a way to say, we are holding up your funding, we're going to do an investigation, we expect some remedies. But I think there's a real sense among these beneficiaries, among these providers that this is just a first step into dismantling the network.",

        "content": "Vice President J Divan Vance continues to make friends and influence nobody on the world stage. This time, the topic was the president’s lunatic dream of seizing Greenland from Denmark. (But not, curiously, making it a state, which, according to the president’s other lunatic dream, is his plan for Canada.) Because he is a good boy who deserves favor, Vance explained that the time has come once again for us to exercise the Divine Right of Lunatics. From The Independent:\n\nAsked whether he believed the U.S. could acquire Greenland during an interview with Fox News host Maria Bartiromo in February, Vance said: “I think it’s possible, Maria. Here’s the thing which I think a lot of folks don’t appreciate about Greenland. It’s really important to our national security,” the vice president claimed. Vance explained that there are “sea lanes” surrounding Greenland, used by the Chinese and the Russians. The former Ohio senator accused the Danish government of restricting U.S. access and, therefore, “not doing its job” and “not being a good ally.”\n\nThank you, Yale dude. I never noticed that Greenland was an island and, therefore, surrounded by sea lanes. And considering that the current president—and, therefore, his good boy VP—never shuts up about seizing the place, I’d restrict our access to it as well.\n\nDuring the Fox News interview, which discussed several of Trump’s measures, Vance suggested that the only real solution to the national security issue was to take “more territorial interest in Greenland.” He stressed that Trump would take the island if necessary, saying, “That is what President Trump is going to do because he doesn’t care about what the Europeans scream at us; he cares about putting the interests of American citizens first.”\n\nSorry, Yale dude. I lived through the decades in which what was once the Soviet Union was a serious military threat to the U.S., albeit occasionally an overhyped one, and not a dead-broke kleptocracy. And in those days, we were content with the DEW line and all the other safeguards stationed in and around the Arctic. I do not wake in the night terrified about Russian fishing trawlers. And I don’t think I want to take up in a country dedicated to the geopolitics of the Reverend G.I. Grabitall.\n\nAnd as it turns out, the first commando raid of the takeover has been launched. It was led by the White House national security advisor, a hack named Mike Waltz, and Usha Vance, wife to J Divan. Their arrival was not greeted with a Laurel and Hardy handshake. From The Guardian:\n\nGreenland’s prime minister, Múte B Egede, has called for the international community to step in after it was announced that Donald Trump’s national security adviser and the US second lady will visit the Arctic island, accusing Washington of “foreign interference”. Mike Waltz and Usha Vance are due to arrive in Greenland this week as part of a delegation that will also include the US energy secretary, Chris Wright. Trump has pledged to make the autonomous territory—part of the kingdom of Denmark, which ruled Greenland as a colony until 1953 and continues to control its foreign and security policy—part of the US, “one way or the other” and has refused to rule out using military or economic force to do so.\n\nEgede reacted angrily to the White House announcement on Sunday, accusing Greenland’s allies of “hiding” and “almost whispering” their support. If the international community did not step up its support for Greenland, he warned, the situation would escalate. “Yes, the western allies stood together and helped each other through thick and thin, but it has turned upside down now with the sitting president in the USA,” he told the Greenlandic newspaper Sermitsiaq.\n\n“But the fact that our other allies in the international community feel like hiding in a small corner and almost whispering that they support us has no effect, and if they do not speak out loudly about how the USA is treating Greenland, the situation will escalate day by day, and the American aggression will increase.” He added: “So we need our other allies to clearly and distinctly come with their support and backing for us.”\n\nAs it happens, Egede’s party lost the last election. The winners are trying to build a coalition government right now, and the one thing they don’t need is a state visit from representatives of a country threatening a hostile takeover of the whole island. I don’t believe it’s coincidental. They’re looking at Greenland like it’s an exercise in vulture capitalism. Striking. Hot irons. That kind of thing.",

        "content": "The Department of Health and Human Services, headed incomprehensibly by one of the greatest weirdos ever to occupy a position of power in this country, has surrendered to patent medicines, hot and cold running PFAS, and various strains of hemorrhagic fever. From CNN:\n\nHHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said last week that 10,000 full-time employees would be cut on top of thousands who had already left and probationary employees currently on leave. He said the changes would make fighting chronic disease the priority and reduce “bureaucratic sprawl.” Kennedy promised that the department would do more with less.\n\nKennedy said in a social media post that the agency is being “recalibrated to emphasize prevention, not just sick care. ... This is a difficult moment for all of us at HHS. Our hearts go out to those who have lost their jobs,” he wrote. “But the reality is clear: what we’ve been doing isn’t working.”\n\nThe entire public health infrastructure is stripped for parts, and all its institutional memory has gone up the spout, and this guy sounds like the assistant manager of a convenience store firing the employee who never got the hang of the Slurpee machine. We are truly in the hands of the madmen now.\n\n“It’s a bloodbath,” one US Food and Drug Administration employee said. “These cuts to agency experts and programs leave our country less safe, less prepared and without the necessary talent and resources to respond to health threats,” Dr. Mandy Cohen, director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention during the Biden administration, said Tuesday.\n\nIn a post on LinkedIn, former US Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Dr. Robert Califf said, “The FDA as we’ve known it is finished, with most of the leaders with institutional knowledge and a deep understanding of product development and safety no longer employed. ... If we let down our guard and don’t do a good job reviewing, we’re going to unleash some things that are really dangerous into the population. Unless there’s some super plan, there’s going to be an effect on safety, because it takes whole teams of people to monitor safety of products, and the timetables for product review will probably be delayed.”\n\nI’m not sure what Mr. Secretary would consider a “super plan.” I am very sure that I don’t want to know.\n\nThe totality of the cuts was not clear Tuesday, with many workers waiting for emails—or waiting to get into buildings, uncertain whether their badges would work. Even supervisors weren’t sure who was being eliminated, one senior official at the CDC said. Cuts at the CDC slashed divisions that work on workplace health and safety, HIV, injury prevention, reproductive health, smoking and violence prevention, among others. Despite Kennedy’s focus on chronic diseases, CDC employees described broad cuts at the agency’s National Center for Chronic Disease and Health Promotion.\n\nI thought Mr. Secretary’s main target was chronic disease.\n\nThe offices at the CDC and the National Institutes of Health that handle Freedom of Information Act requests were also cut. The FDA lost many of its FOIA officers, but a few remained, including some who were working on litigation, according to a source familiar with the circumstances who spoke on the condition that they not be named for fear of reprisal.\n\nSeveral senior leaders at the CDC were reassigned to other roles, and some were told they would have to relocate. At NIH, Dr. Jeanne Marrazzo, director of National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, was also offered reassignment to the Indian Health Service and would have to move to an area such as Alaska, New Mexico, or Minnesota.\n\nInternal exile. Who knew East Germany had so many lessons to teach us?\n\nOf course, as USA Today reports, the reservoir of sympathy from our national legislature remains fathomless.\n\nThe former Health and Human Services employee was among a small group of other fired federal workers protesting Tuesday, when he recorded an interaction with Sen. Jim Banks, R-Ind., telling him “Hi, I was a worker at HHS. I was fired illegally on February 14th. There are many people who are not getting social service programs, especially people with disabilities. Are you going to do anything to stop what’s happening?”\n\nBanks replied, “Uh, you probably deserved it.” Schroeder asked him why, and the lawmaker replied “Because you seem like a clown.”\n\nAfter the incident, Schroeder told USA TODAY that he found Banks’ comments shocking. “It felt very childish to hear someone in a leadership position whose constituents rely on these programs to say that,” Schroeder said. “I hope a lot of people in his state see the callousness that he demonstrated.”\n\nI just hope they don’t applaud.",

        "content": "Every now and again, we check in with the folks at Just Security who are keeping track of the lawsuits currently active against the maladministration of the new American Golden Age. The current tally is 139 and, one suspects, climbing. Many of them make the heretofore unremarkable point that executive orders are in no way laws but, rather, policy recommendations from the executive designed to create a legislative agenda upon which Congress then would act.\n\n(Voice-over: That’s not how it works anymore.)\n\nAt the moment, of course, the administration’s record in the various courts is roughly equivalent to Germany’s in world wars. Which gave Speaker Moses an idea. From Reuters:\n\nJohnson, the top Republican in the U.S. House of Representatives, told reporters the numerous injunctions issued by judges nationally that have stymied Trump’s initiatives were part of a “dangerous trend. ... It violates separation of powers when a judge thinks that they can enjoin something that a president is doing, that the American people voted for,” Johnson said during his weekly press conference. He said the House Judiciary Committee plans to hold a hearing next week “to highlight these abuses” and had recently advanced legislation that would prevent district court judges from issuing nationwide injunctions blocking policies. “We do have authority over the federal courts,” he said. “As you know, we can eliminate an entire district court. We have power over funding, over the courts and all these other things. But desperate times call for desperate measures, and Congress is going to act.”\n\nNice independent judiciary you have there. Shame if anything happened to it.\n\n(Here is where I note that Speaker Moses seems unbothered by the one-man All U Can Sue wing-nut buffet being run by ol’ Judge Matt Kacsmaryk down in Amarillo.)\n\nJohnson seems prepared to give the contract over to his favorite button man, Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Van Heusen), chairman of the House Judiciary Committee. Any judge subpoenaed by this collection of pantomime kangaroos should refuse to honor them and, if anyone threatens them, say they’ll honor Jordan’s subpoenas when he honors the January 6 select committee’s.

        "content": "(Permanent Musical Accompaniment to the Last Post of the Week from the Blog’s Favourite Living Canadian)\n\nOh, Elise. How did this happen? It profit not a woman to gain the entire world and lose her soul, but for your old congressional seat? To paraphrase Eric Stratton, rush chairman of the Delta Tau Chi chapter at Faber College, hey, you fcked up. You trusted him. From NBC:\n\nPresident Donald Trump said Thursday he was pulling the nomination of Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., to be U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, citing concerns about the House’s slim margin to enact his legislative agenda. Trump said in a post on Truth Social that Stefanik “will stay in Congress” after her nomination for the administration post had stalled for months.\n\n“I have asked Elise, as one of my biggest Allies, to remain in Congress to help me deliver Historic Tax Cuts, GREAT Jobs, Record Economic Growth, a Secure Border, Energy Dominance, Peace Through Strength, and much more, so we can MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN,” Trump said in a Truth Social post. “With a very tight Majority, I don’t want to take a chance on anyone else running for Elise’s seat. The people love Elise and, with her, we have nothing to worry about come Election Day. There are others that can do a good job at the United Nations. Therefore, Elise will stay in Congress, rejoin the House Leadership Team, and continue to fight for our amazing American People. Speaker Johnson is thrilled!”\n\nAs it happens, Speaker Moses is quaking in his loafers, His majority is paper-thin. He’s got special elections coming up in erstwhile safe Republican districts where the polling numbers are doing things they’ve rarely done before. (The district once represented by Mike Waltz, star of stage, screen, and group chats, is dangerously close.) And the internal polls must look like a cholera epidemic at this point, since the president is nervous enough to stab Stefanik in the back this way while giving the decision the old ALL CAPS hard sell on his failing social media platform. I wish I could say that Stefanik didn’t deserve to be treated like a doormat but, damn, did she deserve to be treated like a doormat.\n\nThe latest offense against history committed by the administration has to do with whitewashing the Smithsonian Institution. Vice President J Divan Vance has been tasked with bringing American history in line with the mandates of creating a white-supremacist nation of the mind again, drawn to the specifications of a tottering old grifter who never knew much history in the first place. From The New York Times:\n\nIn an executive order titled “Restoring Truth and Sanity to American History,” Mr. Trump took aim at what he described as a “revisionist movement” across the country that “seeks to undermine the remarkable achievements of the United States by casting its founding principles and historical milestones in a negative light.” His order claimed that the Smithsonian, in particular, had “come under the influence of a divisive, race-centered ideology” and that it promotes “narratives that portray American and Western values as inherently harmful and oppressive.”\n\nIt’s long past time to treat these EOs as the policy suggestions that they are. This, of course, would require a far less supine Congress. How does the president plan to square these requirements with the missions of the National Museum of African American History and Culture or the National Museum of the American Indian or even parts of the Holocaust Memorial Museum? I’m almost afraid to ask.\n\nIn the order he called on Vice President JD Vance, who is a member of the Smithsonian’s board, to work with Congress to prohibit expenditures on exhibitions or programs that “degrade shared American values, divide Americans by race or promote ideologies inconsistent with federal law.” His executive order also called for making sure that the Smithsonian’s American Women’s History Museum, which is under development, does not “recognize men as women in any respect.”\n\nI am now sorry I asked.\n\nIn another passage of the order that could have sweeping implications, Mr. Trump directed the secretary of the Department of the Interior, which oversees the National Park Service, to determine whether, since 2020, “public monuments, memorials, statues, markers, or similar properties within the Department of the Interior’s jurisdiction have been removed or changed to perpetuate a false reconstruction of American history.” Instead, the order directs, all properties should “focus on the greatness of the achievements and progress of the American people or, with respect to natural features the beauty, abundance, and grandeur of the American landscape.”\n\nWelcome back, I suspect, all ye Traitors in Defense of Slavery. Time to rehearse all the lies of the Lost Cause that we learned in grade schools, North and South. Time for history to resume its role as a national anesthetic.\n\nWeekly WWOZ Pick to Click: “A Foggy Day” (Germaine Bazzle): Yeah, I pretty much still love New Orleans.\n\nWeekly Visit to the Pathé Archives: Here, from 1920, some French battle flags from the Franco–Prussian War are returned to the Army Museum in Paris. No sign of meddlesome politicians. History is so cool.\n\nThere were some interesting doings around the Supreme Court this past week. First, the Nine Wise Souls upheld the Biden Administration’s regulations on so-called ghost guns. Justice Neil Gorsuch wrote for the majority. From SCOTUSBlog:\n\nCongress enacted the Gun Control Act, Gorsuch explained, because it found that then-current “gun control measures … allowed criminals to acquire largely untraceable guns too easily.” The act requires manufacturers to put a serial number on guns and regulates commercial gun sales by (among other things) requiring gun manufacturers and dealers to conduct background checks and keep records of gun sales. Advances in technology, Gorsuch noted, such as 3D printing and reinforced polymers, have changed the way in which guns are manufactured and sold. And in particular, “companies are able to make and sell weapon parts kits that individuals can assemble into functional firearms in their own homes.” These kits are popular among hobbyists, Gorsuch wrote, but also among criminals, because some manufacturers and sellers do not regard them as “firearms” subject to the Gun Control Act and therefore do not comply with the act’s requirements—leading to “an explosion of crimes” around the country.\n\nYou take your sunbeams where they fall these days, and it’s nice to see that the court draws the line at the free manufacture of untraceable firearms. In other action, the court refused to hear a challenge to the 1964 decision in Sullivan v. New York Times, the landmark First Amendment case that raised the standards for libel in connection with public figures—in this case, casino mogul Steve Wynn. From CBS News:\n\nWynn sued the AP in 2018 over its reporting about sexual misconduct allegations against him from the 1970s that were filed with law enforcement. He stepped down from his position as chief executive of Wynn Resorts, which he founded, in 2018, after the Wall Street Journal published sexual misconduct allegations. Wynn also stepped down from his role as the finance chairman for the Republican National Committee. Wynn has consistently denied any allegations of misconduct.\n\nI’m not going to rest easily on this one. Justices Thomas and Gorsuch both are on record as favoring overturning Sullivan. The president wants to burn the decision on the White House steps. Steve Wynn may have been a singularly unattractive plaintiff. My chickens are going to remain uncounted on this one.\n\n\n\nFurther Adventures in Cowardice. From Politico:\n\nThe White House has reached a deal with one of the largest law firms in the world to provide the equivalent of $100 million in free legal work to causes supported by the administration, President Donald Trump announced Friday afternoon. The law firm, Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP, will also fund fellowships for law school graduates to work on causes in line with the administration’s priorities. The fellows “will represent a wide range of political views, including conservative ideals,” the president said in a statement.\n\nNo expert here, but $100 million seems a lot of money to pay for the right to take on ideological DEI cases. And the administration didn’t even have to threaten these jamokes. Jesus, these people.\n\nDiscovery Corner: Hey, look what we found! From The New York Times:\n\nArchaeologists have unearthed the huge tomb of an unknown pharaoh at an Egyptian necropolis, a team of researchers said on Thursday, in the second discovery of a king’s tomb this year. ... Researchers uncovered the tomb at the mountain, at the base of a high desert cliff where strong winds carry gusts of sand. In some places around the necropolis, sand has buried structures more than 16 or 19 feet deep. The burial chamber features a decorated entryway, several rooms and soaring 16-foot vaults made of mud bricks. It dwarfs a tomb unearthed at Abydos over a decade ago, which was hailed at the time as the first material proof of a “lost” dynasty of kings there.\n\nAn unknown pharaoh, eh? An Egyptian Franklin Pierce. Every country should have one.\n\nHey, NBC News. Is it a good day for dinosaur news? It’s always a good day for dinosaur news!\n\nDuonychus, which means “two claws” in Greek, stood about 10 feet tall and weighed roughly 570 pounds and belonged to the group of dinosaurs called Therizinosaurs, which were characterized by an odd set of traits: huge claws believed to have been used to shear leaves off trees, leaf-shaped teeth, backward-facing hip bones and a long neck ending in a small head, and it was covered in down and quill-like feathers.\n\nThe standards for “an odd set of traits” are a lot higher for dinos than they are for, say, guppies or parakeets. If the scientists find the traits of this new species odd, you can bet that the beast is strange and wonderful.\n\n\n\n“It kind of blew my mind,” the lead author of a study published Tuesday in the journal iScience, Yoshitsugu Kobayashi, an associate professor at the Hokkaido University Museum, told NBC News by email. “I felt this rush of excitement, like, ‘Wait … am I actually looking at something completely new here?’ ” Therizinosaurs were already the “weirdest dinosaurs out there,” Kobayashi said. “Duonychus takes that weirdness and pushes it further. It’s like evolution said, ‘Let’s try something different,’ and just ran with it.”\n\nThey lived then to make Dr. Kobayashi happy now.\n\nI’ll be back on Monday for whatever fresh hell awaits. Be well and play nice, ya bastids. Stay above the snake-line and wear the damn masks, and take the damn shots, especially the boosters and the New One. In your spare time, spare a thought for everyone touched by the earthquakes in Myanmar and Thailand, and by the tornadoes throughout the Southeast, and for everyone touched by floods in Kentucky and in West Virginia, and by the crash in Washington, and by the measles outbreak in the Southwest, and in the fire zones in Los Angeles, and for all the folks in Ukraine, who stubbornly fight on, and all the folks in Gaza, and all the people in New Orleans, Las Vegas, Nashville, and Queens, who were visited by the Crazy before the year had hardly begun. And the folks in L.A., now fighting floods and mudslides exacerbated by the recent wildfires. And the folks in Lahaina, who are still rebuilding. And all the folks we regularly cited here in the year gone by, and especially for our fellow citizens in the LGBTQ+ community, who deserve so much better from their country than they’ve been getting. And for all of us, who will be getting exactly what we deserve.",

On Thursday, it was reported that the Department of Defense would be briefing a certain unelected ketamine proponent on the country’s secret war plans for a possible conflict with China. The angry talking yam began storming around Pennsylvania Avenue, eating its own liver.\n\nElon Musk will be briefed by the Pentagon about the USA’s top secret plans against China should there be a War, according to the Failing New York Times, one of the worst and most purposely inaccurate newspapers anywhere in the World. Their FAKE concept for this story is that because Elon does some business in China, that he is very conflicted and would immediately go to top Chinese officials and ‘spill the beans.’ RATINGS CHALLENGED FAKE NEWS CNN immediately picked up on this absolutely ridiculous and false story, which is probably libelous, and went heavy with it. Fortunately, nobody was watching!\n\nMaggot Hagerman, the really dumb ‘scammer’ who constantly writes about me for the Times, using anonymous, made up (nonexistent!) sources, and who I haven’t spoken to in ages, is a big part of the Scam.

The Fake News is the ENEMY OF THE PEOPLE…And Elon is NOT BEING BRIEFED ON ANYTHING CHINA BY THE DEPARTMENT OF WAR!!!\n\nYou may be comforted by the fact that “Elon” indeed will not be briefed by “the Department of War,” which we haven’t had since 1947. And, anyway, Henry Knox has been dead since 1806 and is therefore unavailable for private briefings. The vulgar talking yam continues to stalk the Beltway, howling in all caps until hell won’t even have it.\n\nOver at the White House, they’ve appointed a new liaison to NASA, which once represented all that was smart and good—and, in all honesty, white—about America. His name is Darren Bossie, and he worked for the first iteration of the West Wing of Hell. He is a young man of vast experience, as The New Yorker pointed out.\n\nDarren Bossie, the new White House liaison to NASA, arrived shortly after Trump’s Inauguration. Bossie was more or less unknown at the agency, but employees soon found his LinkedIn profile. He had spent four of the past seven years bouncing around conservative politics, with a stint as Trump’s White House liaison to the Department of Veterans Affairs, and had worked as a senior consultant for unnamed companies. For the bulk of his professional life, however—from 2006 to 2018—he had been an assistant manager at a Total Wine & More in Palm Beach County, Florida.\n\n“That didn’t seem very promising,” a senior NASA official told me.\n\nCan’t put anything past those guys.\n\nHowever, young Bossie prompted additional interest in those of us who have been tracking conservative ratfcking for a while.\n\nA review of public records, however, suggested that Darren is the brother of David N. Bossie, the president of Citizens United—the conservative group whose litigation before the Supreme Court empowered mega-donors and corporations to make unlimited contributions to political candidates.\n\nBoy howdy has David Bossie left a long trail of fcked rats behind him. He made his bones with his infamous activities against candidate, and then president, Bill Clinton. David Bossie was the guy who forced his way into the hospital room where a woman was ministering to her husband who had suffered a stroke. The woman’s daughter, Susan Coleman, had committed suicide, and Bossie claimed to believe the hoax that Coleman had killed herself because Clinton had gotten her pregnant. Bossie’s tactics have managed to get him condemned by President George H.W. Bush, fired as a congressional investigator, and even marked lousy by the first Trump administration for profiteering off the president’s image. (That’s the president’s job, dammit.) However, he forever will be a conservative hero because he was one of the leaders of a political activist outfit called Citizens United, which was used to demolish any possibility of sensible political financial reform, perhaps forever. So we all have to deal with the Bossie family again because you can’t get away from Republican buccaneering even in outer space.\n\nWeekly WWOZ Pick to Click: “Empire State Express” (Son House): Yeah, I pretty much still love New Orleans.\n\nWeekly Visit to the Pathé Archives: Here, from the Roaring (if goofy) Twenties, are some popular British party games.

On the other hand, this looks like the original source material for Eyes Wide Shut. History is so cool.\n\nMy God, this is an historic first. From Washington Monthly:\n\nMaybe it’s time for J.D. Vance to face some questions. Vance’s favorability is worse than Harris’s at the same two-month mark and perhaps worse than any new vice president in the history of polling. His Real Clear Politics favorable-unfavorable rating is 41.7 percent-44.8 percent, a slightly worse net favorable rating (-3.1 percentage points) than Donald Trump’s (-0.9). When looking only at March polling—sampled after his infamous Oval Office hectoring of Ukraine’s president—he’s even more underwater: 42.4 percent-48.0 percent.\n\nThis is pure instinctive revulsion. Vance hasn’t really done anything yet except run his mouth, get booed at the Kennedy Center, and Be There, and that’s apparently been enough.\n\nA Vance ’28 campaign, I suspect, will be bogged down with immense baggage from his current stint in the public sector, without the ability to lean on any record of success in the private sector—save for a profitable book with a message that has no resemblance to anything Vance peddles today. If Trump taps a namesake to carry on his legacy, Vance will lose out on the party’s MAGA base.\n\nI think they’ve never trusted his naked ambition and, as the president appears to continue down the road of cognitive deterioration, he’s going to get blamed for every story out of the White House about how the president is headed for La La Land. Can’t say I blame the cult for this, either.\n\nDiscovery Corner: Hey, look what we found! From Popular Mechanics:\n\nArchaeologists excavating a private property in Florence, Italy, discovered a 20-inch statue of Hercules missing its head, though not altogether headless. Despite no cranium on the Greek hero, the statue included details from Hercules’ mythic 12 labors, including the skin of the Nemean lion and the severed head of the Cretan bull. The statue was dated to between the middle and late Imperial age from the third to fourth centuries, A.D., according to a translated report from Italian media, making it a roughly 1,700 find. The diminutive statue depicts a nude Hercules leaning to his right on his club, adorned with the trophies from his labors. According to Greek mythology, the Oracle of Delphi advised Hercules to travel to Tiryns to serve his cousin, King Eurystheus of Mycenae, for 12 years, for which he would be rewarded with immortality.\n\nAnd I guess, in one way, ol’ Herc was rewarded. All it cost was his head.\n\nHey, New Scientist. Is it a good day for dinosaur news? It’s always a good day for dinosaur news!\n\nA new species of dinosaur found at a Mongolian building site has the largest fully preserved claw ever found. The bipedal, herbivorous animal had only two fingers on each hand, which it may have used to grasp branches and pull them towards its mouth. The 90-million-year-old fossil—which included parts of the pelvis, both arms and hands, and numerous vertebrae—was found near Khanbogd in the Gobi desert in 2012, but it has only now been properly studied and given the scientific name Duonychus tsogtbaatari. The genus name means “two claws” and the species name honours Mongolian palaeontologist Khishigjav Tsogtbaatar.\n\nThe researchers think the claws were an adaptation to grabbing and pulling down vegetation. With fewer fingers, each one could be stronger and more flexible, allowing for a tighter, more controlled grip, says Kobayashi. “The curved claws and extreme flexion suggest it could hook onto branches or clusters of leaves more easily,” he says. “Three fingers might have just gotten in the way, while two provided a more precise and efficient grasp.”\n\nGiant claws used merely to grab leaves? What a waste. I’m sure they can clean that up for the next movie. They lived, healthily and regularly, with plenty of roughage, to make us happy now.\n\nI’ll be back on Monday, for whatever fresh hell awaits... Be well and play nice, ya bastids.

And all the folks we regularly cited here in the year gone by, and especially for our fellow citizens in the LGBTQ+ community, who deserve so much better from their country than they’ve been getting. And for all of us, who will be getting exactly what we deserve.\n\n",

        "content": "In our continuing effort to keep abreast of future conspiracy bait here in the shebeen, we call your attention to this tragedy in Virginia. From The Guardian:\n\nIn a statement on social media, Alexandria police announced that at about 9.18am on Saturday, police responded to the 900 block of Beverley Drive following reports of an unresponsive woman. Upon arriving at the scene, authorities located a deceased woman who they later identified as 43-year-old Jessica Aber. “In a matter of protocol, an investigation is under way surrounding the circumstances of her death. The office of the chief medical examiner of Virginia will determine the cause and manner of death,” police said, without providing additional details surrounding her death.\n\nAs is—or was, anyway—the case with U.S. attorneys, Ms. Aber, who resigned on the day of Trump’s inauguration, prosecuted a wide variety of dangerous criminals.\n\nAber began her career in 2009 at the US district court for the eastern district of Virginia where she prosecuted financial fraud, public corruption, violent crime, and child exploitation cases. From 2015 to 2016, she served on an assignment as counsel to the assistant attorney general from the justice department’s criminal division. From 2016 until becoming US attorney, Aber served as the deputy chief of the criminal division for the US district court for the eastern district of Virginia, the US attorney’s office said.\n\nThese miscreants included a rogues’ gallery of characters, some of whom had the requisite motivation and the (theoretical) wherewithal to revenge themselves against the prosecutor(s) who put them away. From USA Today:\n\nThis is a target-rich environment for exploitative yahoos from across the political spectrum. Remember Seth Rich and ignore them all. This is a big hunk of catnip to a Department of Justice that is MAGAfied to its very core. Don't believe a word they say. We have enough real, demonstrable atrocities to concern us.",

        "content": "I get the feeling that the sooner that trial in the Manhattan courthouse goes to jury, the better for us all, because it seems to me that, here in the homestretch, the entire exercise is in danger of going to the zoo and never returning. Inside the courtroom, defense attorney Todd Blanche has led Michael Cohen through all the shenanigans in which he engaged on the former president*’s behalf in an attempt to delegitimize everything Cohen has done since flipping on his former boss, apparently in the belief that nobody outside the courthouse has ever a seen a legal drama in which somebody “turns state’s.”\n\n\n\nOutside, in a desperate attempt to keep the public’s interest, the TV coverage is starting to slide toward the notion that Blanche has been brilliant in his cross-examination of Cohen. Meanwhile, someone released a series of penis-shaped balloons with the names and faces of various Trump antagonists attached to them. In addition, Thursday’s emissaries from the cult’s Washington outpost included Reps. Lauren Boebert, Matt Gaetz, Andy Biggs, and Anna Paulina Luna in what can fairly be called the D-Team. At least nine of them were there and, as The Hill shrewdly pointed out, this completely banjaxed the GOP’s wafer-thin majority in the House.\n\nThe trip to New York comes on what was scheduled to be a busy day in particular for the House Oversight Committee and the House Judiciary Committee. Both had scheduled morning hearings for a top GOP priority: holding Attorney General Merrick Garland in contempt of Congress.\n\n\n\nA source confirmed to The Hill on Wednesday that the last-minute shift in the Oversight schedule was to allow the lawmakers to make the trip to New York. Trekking to Trump’s trial means Gaetz and Biggs will miss the Judiciary hearing on the matter, while Oversight members such as Boebert and Luna may be back for the hearing that has since been moved to 8 p.m. EDT. “Due to member schedule conflicts, the markup is now starting at a different time to accommodate members’ schedules,” a spokesperson for the House Oversight Committee told The Hill on Wednesday.\n\nAny late return could also complicate other matters for House Republicans. The chamber is voting at 4 p.m. on a bill to reverse Biden’s hold on certain transfers of arms to Israel. The White House has said Biden would veto the bill. A number of Democrats had signaled some support for the measure, but Democratic leaders are now whipping against it. As a result, heavy absences by Republicans could make it difficult for GOP leaders to get it across the finish line.\n\nNaturally, the business of governing the nation must give way to their obligation to go to New York to pay homage to their God-Emperor Schitzinpants. The difference between the members of Thursday’s congressional pilgrimage and the clutch of penis-shaped balloons that took flight not far from them isn’t vast.",

        "content": "’Fi were king of the forest, and I had a friend who was a know-nothing dilettante, a dude with a couple billion dollars’ worth of business dealings with China, and a ketamine fan into the bargain, I might think twice about something like this. From The New York Times:\n\nAnother official said the briefing would be China focused, without providing additional details. A fourth official confirmed Mr. Musk was to be at the Pentagon on Friday, but offered no details. Hours after news of the planned meeting was published by The New York Times. Pentagon officials and President Trump denied that the session would be about military plans involving China. “China will not even be mentioned or discussed,” Mr. Trump said in a late-night social media post. It was not clear if the briefing for Mr. Musk would go ahead as originally planned. But providing Mr. Musk access to some of the nation’s most closely guarded military secrets would be a dramatic expansion of his already extensive role as an adviser to Mr. Trump and leader of his effort to slash spending and purge the government of people and policies they oppose.\n\nSomehow, I am rarely reassured by what is said by the president in “late-night social media” posts. Neither am I reassured by the fact that the Pentagon is currently run by a former Jägermeister spokesmodel.\n\nPentagon war plans, known in military jargon as O-plans or operational plans, are among the military’s most closely guarded secrets. If a foreign country were to learn how the United States planned to fight a war against them, it could reinforce its defenses and address its weaknesses, making the plans far less likely to succeed. The top-secret briefing that exists for the China war plan has about 20 to 30 slides that lay out how the United States would fight such a conflict. It covers the plan beginning with the indications and warning of a threat from China to various options on what Chinese targets to hit, over what time period, that would be presented to Mr. Trump for decisions, according to officials with knowledge of the plan.\n\nLastly, I am not reassured by the fact that, if it ever came to guns with China, this guy’s creations would be fighting for both sides, and not just because whatever it is he manufactured is even money to glitch itself into the Mariana Trench shortly after the outbreak of hostilities.\n\nLosing Democracy by the Dose—A Novel.",

        "source": "https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/",
        "content": "(Optional Musical Accompaniment to This Post)\n\nYour cheesehead won’t get you into heaven anymore.\n\nFrom the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel:\n\nCrawford, 60, had received 55% of the vote to conservative Waukesha County Judge Brad Schimel’s 45% with 82% of the vote in, according to unofficial results. Decision Desk HQ called the race less than an hour after polls closed at 8 p.m. At Crawford’s election night party in Madison, supporters cheered in response to calls that she had won the race early in the night. Groups in justice’s robes and cow-printed cowboy hats flooded the party to celebrate, while others dressed in America-themed outfits broke out in dance.\n\nSo Elon Musk flew to Green Bay, put on a silly hat, acted like a jackass on stage, handed out his golf-tournament checks, and his candidate went to bed before the Bucks game was over. That is a bit of old Wisconsin progressive ass-kicking right there—despite the fact that an elected judiciary is the second-worst idea in American politics.\n\n“As a little girl growing up in Chippewa Falls, I never could have imagined that I’d be taking on the richest man in the world for justice in Wisconsin. And we won!” she said to cheers, referring to the $20 million-plus billionaire Elon Musk [spent] in an attempt to defeat her.\n\nChippewa Falls! Hometown of Annie Hall and, until this past January, alas, Leinenkugel’s lager beer! Helping face down a gazillionaire’s $20 million traveling plutocrat medicine show on behalf of one of its own.\n\nCrawford will replace outgoing liberal Justice Ann Walsh Bradley, who did not run for re-election. She takes office Aug. 1. Her victory gives liberals control of the state’s high court for the next three years, when it is considering such issues as abortion, union rights and more. In rejecting Schimel, the state’s voters spurned Republican President Donald Trump, who endorsed him, and Musk in a race widely seen as a referendum on the president’s first two months in the White House.\n\nThat “more” includes ongoing disputes over Wisconsin’s electoral maps. From Bolts:\n\nCrawford winning a 10-year term means she’ll be on the court for the next round of redistricting, following the 2030 Census. District maps were hugely important in the state’s 2023 court election, and [Janet] Protasiewicz’s win paved the way for redrawn, fairer legislative maps that have reduced the GOP’s chokehold on state government. Wisconsin’s congressional map remains drawn to heavily, unfairly favor the GOP, as the state supreme court declined to hear a Democratic challenge two years ago. Several legal experts told Bolts they did not expect the court to revisit that decision in coming years, though national Democrats have expressed some hope they may soon get a more favorable ruling.\n\nNonetheless, this is another victory for Wisconsin Democratic leader Ben Wikler and his operation, even though a stringent voter-ID constitutional amendment passed on Tuesday night as well, and it calls for a cold Leinie’s raised in triumph. Sometimes Wisconsin remembers what it once was.\n\nRelated Story Trump’s Ivy League Shakedown Operation Is Now Targeting Harvard\n\n\n\n",

        "source": "https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/",
        "content": "He means it. Make no mistake about that. Above all, don’t laugh it off. From NBC:\n\n“I’m not joking,” Trump said, when asked to clarify. “But I’m not—it is far too early to think about it.” When asked whether he has been presented with plans to allow him to seek a third term, Trump said, “There are methods which you could do it.” NBC News asked about a possible scenario in which Vice President JD Vance would run for office and then pass the role to Trump. Trump responded that “that’s one” method. “But there are others, too,” Trump added. Asked to share another method, Trump simply responded “no.”\n\nI felt all along that, if the Supreme Court had allowed Colorado and other states to boot him off the ballot in 2024 under the 14th Amendment’s anti-insurrection clause, as it should have, Trump would have run anyway. And if he’d not won the Republican nomination, he’d have shown sufficient strength to make that nomination worthless to Nikki Haley or whoever got it. He’d have puddle-jumped the country for his ego-feeding rallies and rendered the entire process a perilous farce. And, who knows, he might have done well enough to throw the whole thing into the House of Representatives and won anyway. Nobody in the Republican House majority was going to stop him. And the carefully manufactured conservative majority on the Supreme Court would have been completely up for grabs.\n\nFrankly, I don’t see why he wouldn’t try this in 2028. Even if the court grows a new and permanent backbone and rules that he is ineligible, there’s nothing to stop him from running on his own hook. There’s no Republican politician out there with the stones to take him on in as public a forum as a presidential campaign. The party structure has proven worse than useless against him. His base would love him even more because he once again was thumbing his nose at the Deep State—and a big chunk of it already doesn’t trust Chief Justice John Roberts and actively hates Justice Amy Coney Barrett.\n\nHe still has his plane and enough people out there in the country willing to host his gatherings of the rubes. Plus, even with the court’s preposterous immunity ruling, he’s still in at least some danger of ending his life in jail. And that’s just for what he did in his first term. (If the House flips to the Democrats in 2026, the path would become a little more difficult. But remember: If a presidential election reaches the House, each state gets one vote and, obviously, Republicans can still lose their majority and still have majorities in a majority of the state delegations.)\n\nI have no doubt that some of Trump’s lawyers from the firm of Lickspittle and Doormat are scheming away already. There’s nobody around him these days with the patriotism God gave a goose—nobody to say no to his lunatic strategies. He’s not joking. He doesn’t have that kind of wit.",

        "source": "https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/",
        "content": "Mark Peterson/Redux\n\nDonald Trump won the 2020 election,” Steve Bannon pronounces. “Of that there is not even a question.\"\n\nObviously you expect me not to agree with you, I say. “Of course I expect you not to agree with me,” he says. “And I’m also not looking for you to agree with me. And I also don’t give a fuck who in the mainstream media agrees or disagrees with me.”\n\nAnd so off we go—about this and about Covid (the Bannon view: “It’s 100 percent a bioweapon—fucking not even a question”) and about vaccines (“I would never in ten million years get this vaccine,” Bannon says, and asks if I would; I simply hand him my vax card, which he looks at with apparent amazement: “I’ve never . . .”) and about what I view—but naturally Bannon doesn’t—as his incessant anti-Semitic dog-whistling. At one point, he rhapsodizes about the range of information available to people these days.\n\nOr misinformation, I say.\n\n“A wide range of information,” he counters. “One man’s misinformation may be somebody else’s Holy Grail, right?”\n\nI hardly agree—this seems a terrifying equivalence to me—but he’s already on to something else.\n\nWe are sitting out back of a home Bannon has near Tucson on the last day of July. The conversation is interrupted by a call on his cell. Here, for the record, is how Bannon says hello: “What the fuck don’t you understand about one o’clock?” The caller is Peter Navarro, who worked in the White House on economic issues throughout the Trump administration. Navarro went missing for this morning’s prerecorded episode of Bannon’s mouthpiece TV show and podcast, War Room, when Bannon was expecting him to pick apart Ron DeSantis’s new speech on economic policy. Bannon’s soon making nice but, as he often does, led with the loud.\n\nCall over, he’s soon back in the flow. When I ask him what he wants people to think of him, he offers up the manifesto of a valiant, tireless warrior.\n\nMark Peterson/Redux Asked about the potential for history to judge him wrong about everything, Bannon said, “That will be impossible.”\n\n“I don’t care,” he replies. “Whatever they think. You’ve got so much time in this vale of tears, right, to use your agency. And you’ve got to be able to look in the mirror every day and just say, I’m leaving it all on the field, and I’m nonstop, all that. And whatever they think, they think. Remember, as much as I’m hated by—and/or dismissed by—the mainstream media or the Left, I’m much more hated and dismissed by the Republican establishment. Hated. Hated. So I don’t care. History is going to be the judge. Remember, over time history judges things very differently. There are people today that are heroes that were looked at as goats. I mean, look at Oppenheimer. It changes over time. So I think you just got to do what you have to do and let the cards fall where they may. I can look at the results. I can see what’s happening. I see how we’re changing American political history. We’re ascending. We’re getting bigger.”\n\nAnd what if history decides you were wrong about everything?\n\n“That will be impossible.”\n\nWe continue this back-and-forth, which somehow seems both necessary and futile, for more than three hours, then take a break for the day. As for what happens later that evening, how you choose to interpret it may depend on how you feel about science and meteorology and the vagaries of energy flow; on how you feel about chance and numbers and the random play of improbable events; on how you feel about the existence or nonexistence of God and His interventionist tendencies; on how you feel about fate and symbols and auguries. And, of course, on how you feel about coincidences.\n\nThese, anyway, are the facts:\n\nBannon goes to bed early. Around eight o’clock in the evening, he is awoken by what sounds like an explosion. (“Dude, I’m telling you, we thought the house had blown up. I’ve never had, even on my Navy ship—I’ve never been that direct a hit.”) Right outside the front door of Bannon’s house, just to the left as you enter—and precisely above War Room’s makeshift Arizona studio—stands a date palm, maybe forty feet high. A lightning bolt had hit the palm’s trunk, just above the height of the roof, and flames are now climbing both upward to the fronds and down the trunk.\n\n“That entire beautiful palm was literally lit up like a torch,” Bannon tells me. “It was raining fire.”\n\n\n\nOne problem with hating pretty much everything Steve Bannon says and everything he stands for is that it might be exactly what he wants. “I hope they say I’m a devil,” he’ll tell me. “I hope they say I’m a fucking demon. I could give a fuck less. All I want to do is win.” Another is that maybe such dilemmas are a distraction, masking more crucial questions. For instance: Is Bannon truly someone forever playing the game several levels above and ahead of the rest of us, his every ambiguous zig and zag calculated to further a majestic master plan? Or is he actually just one more big-talking huckster, brazenly improvising whatever he can with whichever tools he can muster, making it all up as he goes? Or—maybe the most chastening possibility of all—might it be that in our modern-day runaway world of increasingly fractured and divided truths, there’s no longer a meaningful difference between the two?\n\nBannon’s past offers contradictory clues. He launched himself into most people’s consciousness as the unkempt, take-no-prisoners agitator who took over Donald Trump’s faltering presidential campaign in August 2016. After Trump defied most predictions by winning the election that November and Bannon was appointed chief strategist in the White House, a notorious Time magazine cover story suggested that Bannon might be the second-most-powerful man in the world. The implication was that Bannon—“the great manipulator,” as Time’s cover line proclaimed him—was pulling the strings of the first. Six months later, in circumstances that remain disputed, Bannon was gone. Since then, he has hovered hazily in the middle distance. Looked at through one lens, he is the radical Right’s great ideologue, propagandist, and strategist, orchestrating both overtly and covertly a global agenda that is currently focused on bringing Donald Trump back to the White House before fundamentally reordering American society. Looked at through another, that’s exactly what he needs people to think as he wages the endless uphill battle for relevance and influence.\n\nWhatever he is, he’s not lazy. War Room typically broadcasts live twenty-two hours a week, preaching a version of America crafted to horrify anyone not swept along with its relentless presentation of a country at the precipice’s edge, time running out unless enough good people inform themselves of the truths being hidden from them, then organize themselves to resist. To an outsider’s ears, it is not just the supposed truths, and the cavalcade of what are presented as supporting facts, that can seem at best unfamiliar, at worst poisonously inaccurate. This is a world with a whole disorientating language of its own. Here—to get a sense of both the substance and cadence of this upside-down world—is a selective glossary:\n\nThe Keebler Elves: Bannon’s disdainful collective term for the other candidates running against Donald Trump for the Republican nomination. Bannon, as an all-in Trump advocate, agitates against what he depicts as a pointless competition, a needlessly divisive distraction, and a waste of resources given that, in his way of seeing, the end result is already inevitable.\n\nMark Peterson/Redux Bannon often embraces harsh criticisms—that he’s “a cancer,” for example, or that he has no conscience—as a kind of proof of purpose.\n\nThe Biden crime family: It is an article of faith in this world not just that Hunter Biden’s international business relationships embodied an extensive, calculated corruption and criminality, one that has been systematically covered up by the Democratic and judicial establishments, but also that President Biden and other members of his family knowingly participated in, and received large sums of money from, these relationships, and that the president is consequently compromised in his dealings with sundry foreign powers.\n\nJudas Pence: Another inviolable article of faith in this world is that the 2020 election was stolen. For those who believe this, pretty much everything that ensued was part of a valiant fight for truth, a fight in which they were betrayed on January 6, 2021, by Vice President Pence’s supposed failure to prevent the certification of the 2020 vote.\n\nLawfare: A further article of faith is that all of the current legal proceedings against Donald Trump are coordinated charges that have been concocted to prevent his return to power, and that in this the judiciary is controlled and steered by the Democratic establishment in what amounts to an act of warfare by putatively legal means, i.e., lawfare.\n\nThe Uniparty: Bannon expresses as much, if not more, disdain and hate for the Republican establishment as for Democrats. In his vision, the two share so many common interests in the status quo that they resist in lockstep the kinds of radical changes Bannon believes are needed, effectively operating in the shadows as a single united party (an idea, Bannon points out, once explored in the writings of Gore Vidal).\n\nTV for stupid people: Bannon’s routine term for his hated Fox News, which he considers “an insidious cancer inside the conservative movement.”\n\n“No coincidences”: A phrase regularly invoked in reference to a sign in Bannon’s Washington studio that reads, “There are NO conspiracies, but there are NO coincidences. Stephen K. Bannon”—a convenient rhetorical back door to what often seems exactly like conspiratorial thinking.\n\nThe sunlit uplands: The term Bannon often throws out—generally, as with all these terms, without explanation—to denote a happier place we will eventually find ourselves at the end of the necessary turmoil he aims to instigate. The phrase is borrowed from a famous speech given by Winston Churchill in 1940 to inspire the British people in their fight against Hitler.\n\nThat is the sound of War Room. There are often, however, soft words about one particular subject. “We’re getting the best Trump right now,” Bannon told his audience this morning. “I can tell you, having had the honor and privilege of working with the president since 2016, when you meet, when you see him now in private, this is the best Trump we’ve ever had: on point, focused, on fire, take-no-prisoners, understands exactly what the task and purpose is.”\n\nLater, Bannon and I retire once more to his Arizona back patio for further conversation. A fountain burbles behind us; hummingbirds flit around. Lizards skitter across the ground. At one point a hawk flies by. “They keep the rats away,” he says, “so God bless them.” He continues where he left off on the show: “Here’s why I tell people, donors and all these guys. I said, You’re missing the point. You may hate Trump. You’re stuck with Trump. There’s nobody, while Trump’s breathing, that they’ll vote for.”\n\n\n\nEngaging in discourse with—and writing about—someone like Steve Bannon presents a peculiar challenge.\n\n\n\n\n\nLast year, in The Atlantic magazine, Jennifer Senior wrote an extensive and compelling profile that forensically unpicked the ways she saw Bannon “attempting to insert a lit bomb into the mouth of American democracy.” Senior referred to his “industrial-grade bullshit” and “straight up megalomania” and to his War Room show as “a mighty river of ordure.” In her story, a chorus of former colleagues fingered Bannon as “a con man” and “a cancer,” someone who “stumbled into the MAGA movement as a way to make money and to get fame and fortune” and who “may well be mentally unstable, in a frightening, disturbing kind of way,” even someone who could be legitimately compared—“we have seen his sinister form before”—to Hitler. Though the article also respectfully strained to convey something of the world as Bannon sees it, I presume that most Atlantic readers consumed it as a devastating takedown.\n\nThough, as it turns out, not all of them.\n\n“I thought that was terrific,” Bannon tells me. “I thought it was a great piece.”\n\nIt’s hard not to let it get into your head, this imperviousness. It’s not just that Bannon seems impervious to the most obvious lines of attack; it’s that he seems to relish and feed off them. Here is CNN’s Jake Tapper speaking of this world: “And where do people like that go to share the big lie? MAGA media. . . . I wish, I wish in my soul, that any of these people had a conscience.” And why am I so familiar with this quote? Because it is part of the montage that begins every episode of War Room, a montage that is generally followed by fresh media snippets from the previous twenty-four hours, frequently showcasing full-on, pointed—and often, to my ears, effective—mainstream eviscerations of the latest events and tendencies in what we might call Bannon-Trump world. You might expect the targets of such critiques to ignore or sidestep them; instead, Bannon leans into them, as though he considers them testimonials, as proofs of purpose. For instance, one day in August he’ll play a long clip from Morning Joe of Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski taking apart the duplicitous logic of the Right, culminating in Scarborough saying, “They know it’s a lie. They really do. They know it’s a lie. They know the game they’re playing. . . . They can never just say, ‘It’s wrong that he stole nuclear secrets and no president or former president has ever done that in American history.’ ‘It’s wrong that he tried to overthrow a presidential election.’ ” And then the broadcast cuts to a clearly delighted Bannon, smirking. “This was a gem,” he tells his audience. “They’re just in full meltdown.” The front Bannon presents, whether as astute tactics or bluff, is: Agree with us and we fly. Attack us, deride us, scorn us, demean us and we soar.\n\nThis article appeared in the Winter 2023 issue of Esquire\n\nsubscribe\n\nNot long after Bannon left the White House, he was contacted by the documentarian Errol Morris. Back in 2003, Bannon had attended the American premiere of The Fog of War, Morris’s artful (and Oscar-winning) interrogation of Robert McNamara’s role in the debacles of the Vietnam War, at the Telluride Film Festival. “It’s one of the things that motivated me to really want to be, eventually, a documentary director,” says Bannon. (One of the many strands of Bannon’s earlier career—sometimes depicted as a triumphant restless visionary journey through a dazzling array of disciplines, sometimes as a textbook example of how a man who talks the right kind of game can keep failing upward—is his role as the maker of ambitious proselytizing right-wing documentaries.) “The nonlinear way he told the story just blew me away. Plus the fact that McNamara still didn’t quite get it, right?” Later, Bannon saw The Unknown Known, Morris’s 2013 film about Donald Rumsfeld: “I thought that was a disaster for Rumsfeld. I thought it exposed all the things that people had thought about him, of how he’s so certain on stuff—just like McNamara—and it’d get you in these horrible situations, right?” As Bannon remembers it, Morris now proposed making a film about Bannon that would be the third in this series, and Bannon’s response was this: “I said, Look, Robert McNamara and Rumsfeld, those guys are world historical figures. I’m some schmendrick that ran a little news site”—before taking over the Trump campaign in 2016, Bannon had been in charge of the right-leaning website Breitbart News—“and I spent a couple months at the White House. There’s no film there. And he goes: Let me determine that.”\n\nOn the surface, the strangest thing about Bannon’s account of this film’s genesis is his apparent lack of worry about being the third panel of a triptych, slotted in alongside Morris’s coruscating portrayals of McNamara and Rumsfeld. The resultant film, American Dharma, was anchored around excerpts from fifteen or so hours of Morris interviewing Bannon. “I made the movie ultimately because I was interested in Steve Bannon—or, if you like, the nature of Steve Bannon’s evil,” Morris tells me. “I’ve always been interested in difficult characters, in morally compromised characters, and Bannon didn’t seem to me in any way outside of that interest.” To its maker, it was perfectly clear what the movie showed. “American Dharma, properly considered, is a warning,” Morris says.\n\nBannon’s reaction to the film will, by now, come as little shock. “I thought it was fantastic,” he tells me. “If you look at Rumsfeld and McNamara, you come out and understand how they got us into these debacles and still don’t understand what they did. Well, I think there’s no doubt in that film Stephen K. Bannon fully understands exactly what he has helped wrought and is quite comfortable taking 100 percent accountability for that.”\n\nPerhaps more surprising—and perhaps a bellwether of the increasingly intolerant ways in which storytelling around divisive and controversial subjects is nowadays judged—was how many commentators saw American Dharma as sympathetic to Bannon, and unacceptably so. For whatever it was worth, in the interviews Morris gave to promote the film he allowed less room for doubt, talking of “Bannon’s sadism” and “almost diabolical destructiveness,” his “smokescreen of bullshit” and “world of real nastiness.” Morris warned that Bannon “is not a moron but he is a cynical bastard, and no one, absolutely no one, should turn their back on him” and noted that he might be “one of the most dangerous men in the world.”\n\nBannon tells me that he considers these last two observations compliments.\n\nThe morning after the lightning strike, Bannon stands outside his house, surveying the damage, alongside a man who has come to work out what should be done about it. The fire department arrived last night in about six minutes, extinguishing the flames, but the top half of the trunk is blackened and embers litter the ground. The palm tree, Bannon is told, is dead and must be removed. Bannon asks whether they can replace it with one of the same height.\n\n“Maybe a little bit shorter?” the man proposes. Bannon seems disheartened by this suggestion. The man points out that, in time, the new tree will grow.\n\n“Okay,” says Bannon, “but how long does it take to grow that high? I won’t be around that long.”\n\nBrent Stirton/Contour Photos/Getty Images Bannon was in the orbit of the January 6, 2021, insurrection—he spoke with former president Trump that morning and evening—but he hasn’t elaborated on his involvement.\n\nWhen we return to the back patio—the temperature will peak at 102 today, but Bannon is in his usual two collared shirts over a T-shirt—we further discuss Donald Trump. From the outside, his alliance with Trump has sometimes looked less than straightforward. Bannon concedes that he was not an easy fit with what was required in his abbreviated time in the White House. “Look, I’m incredibly headstrong, I got that,” he says. “And I want you to be a partner if you kind of agree with where we ought to go.” Immediately after his departure, he and his former boss remained in contact—when Bannon gave a high-profile interview about his experiences to 60 Minutes, Trump called him and was, says Bannon, “very positive.” A schism became apparent a few months later, in January 2018, when Michael Wolff’s book Fire and Fury, an intimate account of the Trump presidency’s early days, was published. Bannon appeared to be a key source, and his views of Trump and others around him were not always flattering. Trump put out a statement denouncing Bannon—“when he was fired, he not only lost his job, he lost his mind”—then followed up with a tweet referring to “Sloppy Steve Bannon, who cried when he got fired and begged for his job. Now Sloppy Steve has been dumped like a dog by almost everyone. Too bad!”\n\n“That’s a great line,” says Bannon when I cite the “cried when he got fired” sentence. “It’s a great line. I’ve got an older brother, so I know how people say things. I think if you asked President Trump today, he would say that was quite an exaggeration.”\n\nDid you cry?\n\n“No. God no. I resigned. I wasn’t fired. I resigned.”\n\nBannon argues that he has always been a loyalist. He points out that after January 6, 2021, most people peeled away, assuming that the Trump era had come to an end, but Bannon never did: “I had a lot of people call me, say, ‘It’s over, and you’re a smart guy, and you can help drive this into a positive way.’ I said, ‘That’s not a positive way. You’re just surrendering. I’m never going to stop. You scratch me and you just get a hardheaded mick.’ ” (Bannon often refers to his Irish family heritage in this way, usually in the context of resilience, hotheadedness, and stubbornness.) “ ‘It’s just the way I’m built. And we’re not going to stop. And I can see, if we hold, that Trump’s going to return to the White House.’ People fucking laughed at my face.”\n\nTwo and a half years later, with Trump the presumptive Republican nominee, that laughter has subsided. And as for his actual relationship with Trump now, Bannon says this: “I don’t want to talk about the specific conversations, but we speak pretty frequently, yeah. . . . It’s normally about what’s happening on the show and the clips and the poll numbers and what’s happening at the rallies.”\n\nGiven those words, and also bearing in mind the impression of personal intimacy with Trump I’ve heard Bannon convey to his War Room audience, what I will now relate might be taken as evidence of just how strange and unconventional the deep bond running between Trump and Bannon is. Though it could also, if you are so minded, be used to question its nature, or even its very existence.\n\nOn April 28, 2023, Bannon filmed a live episode of War Room from the library of Mar-a-Lago, a special to promote the vainglorious new coffee-table book Letters to Trump. The broadcast began with Bannon speaking with the book’s publisher, Sergio Gor. About fifteen minutes in, well ahead of the agreed schedule, Trump appeared off camera and greeted Bannon. “He starts smiling: ‘My Steve!’ ” Bannon recounts. The show cut to an ad break, and when it returned, Trump was in the interviewee seat, answering Bannon’s questions.\n\nAll very unremarkable, you might think, except for one astonishing aspect: By Bannon’s own account, this moment was the first time he and Trump had met in the flesh since Bannon left the White House in August 2017, almost six years earlier.\n\nBannon fills me in on how things proceeded that day. How afterward Trump invited him to stay for dinner, and though at first Bannon demurred, Trump insisted. And how they were then joined by Melania. Bannon describes the ensuing reintroductions: “He goes, ‘Steve . . . Melania.’ I go, ‘First Lady, so great to see you again. Haven’t seen you in a long time.’ She goes, ‘I always liked you, Steve.’ And I go, ‘I know, Melania, you and I, we hate the same people.’ And she laughed. A very knowing laughter.”\n\nI ask Bannon whether he wants to give me a list, assuming he’ll sidestep, but he doesn’t entirely.\n\n“Listen,” he says, “it’s no doubt we had some hard feelings with Jared and Ivanka and others. . . .”\n\nAt dinner, he says, they all talked, and sitting there at the table, Trump DJed from his iPad.\n\n“He knows Melania hates it when he’s DJing,” Bannon notes.\n\nThere has since been a second meeting between Bannon and Trump, on July 19, before a screening of the movie The Sound of Freedom at Trump’s golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey. Bannon says that he spoke with Trump for about twenty minutes beforehand and also had a long conversion with Jared Kushner, one he presents as a rapprochement.\n\nOne day, we go on an outing. The many twists of Steve Bannon’s early career have been well-documented but are nonetheless littered with curiosities, and the site of one of these lies a half hour or so north of where we are. Biosphere 2 was completed in 1991, a self-contained, domed system of different environments in which a group of people would be enclosed for extended periods of time and studied as they tried to subsist. At the time, what seemed like a weird futuristic experiment was an object of intense media coverage and some controversy, and in 1993 an investment banker was brought in to rationalize parts of the operation. This was Steve Bannon, who ended up running the project for about two years, along with a team including his younger brother Chris.\n\nChris is still involved, and today the three of us are heading up there. Steve has lost his glasses, so Chris drives. In the front, they talk about sharing a bedroom in their home in Richmond when they were young and reminisce about the local band they loved to see all the time, Steel Mill—“played at my high school, at the prom,” says Bannon. Steel Mill being Bruce Springsteen’s band before he had a recording contract. (This tracks. In his autobiography, Born to Run, Springsteen describes how Richmond became Steel Mill’s second home, where they built up a following and even “got hired for school events.” It was, Springsteen wrote, “one of the two places where we could make a buck.”) And then Bannon’s off, talking about seeing the Dead in ’73 and New Riders of the Purple Sage. On the Biosphere 2 property, before Chris Bannon gives me a tour (the Biosphere itself, part research site, part tourist attraction, is now run by the University of Arizona), we first go to the ranch house where Steve Bannon lived for two years in the 1990s—without, as he notes, air conditioning—and continue our conversations. I’ve told Bannon I want to talk to him about Michael Wolff’s books. Over a series of publications—2018’s Fire and Fury, 2019’s Siege, 2021’s Too Famous (and, to a lesser degree, 2021’s Landslide)—Wolff could be seen as the great chronicler of Steve Bannon, though perhaps not always of the man Bannon would now wish people to see.\n\nThe discussion gets puzzling right from the start. When I ask Bannon when he first met Wolff, his response is “After I left the White House? I don’t remember.” When I press that Wolff was clearly around him before that, Bannon offers a second, very specific date—that it was when Wolff and Kellyanne Conway did an onstage interview about the first hundred days of the Trump administration, which was on April 12, 2017. This perplexes me, but for now I decide not to challenge him further on it. Likewise, when I read Bannon a summary Wolff has written of their interactions—“We logged hundreds of hours of conversation together in Trump Tower, the White House, the frat-style accommodations he occupied on Capitol Hill, the luxury suites he favored when he was in New York, during a trip to Europe we took together, and over dinners at my house in Greenwich Village”—Bannon says, “Ridiculous,” adding, “I have ex-wives I haven’t spent hundreds of hours with.” (Bannon has been married three times—his eldest daughter, Maureen, works mostly behind the scenes at War Room—but says that these days he has no ongoing romantic relationship. “I’ve directed my chakras in a different direction,” he says. “I’ll be seventy shortly. I got a window here to have an impact.” In this regard, he mentions something that I can’t get out of my head. He tells me that even years ago, when he’d interview people for his own firm, his second or third question would be about their personal life. He says that it didn’t matter what they actually said: If they spoke for more than sixty seconds in response, they wouldn’t be hired.)\n\nAs Bannon tells me that he has read none of Wolff’s books, I quote to him some relevant passages. I do so less in the expectation that the 2023 version of Bannon is likely to reaffirm the opinions that Wolff reports he once had and shared, more in trying to understand how his present role and his relationship with Trump may—or may not—transcend this material. For instance, there’s this passage from Siege: “But Bannon also believed that if you could get around Trump’s repellent character, intellectual deficiencies, and glaring mental health issues, you ought to be able to see that Trump was being savaged—with the powers that be trying to run him out of office—for doing much of what he had been elected to do. Trumpism, in fact, was working.”\n\n“I haven’t heard these,” Bannon responds, “and I think the reason that you haven’t heard these is that people realize it’s nonsense. It’s just Wolff trying to sell books. Is anybody out there in the media right now, anybody out there in the Republican staff, anybody out there, either lovers of Trump or haters of Trump, that don’t understand that I am Trump’s closest ally?”\n\nJared Siskin // Getty Images Author Michael Wolff has written extensively about Trump. When Bannon appeared to be a key source in Wolff’s 2018 book Fire and Fury, about the early days of the Trump presidency, Trump took to calling his former advisor “Sloppy Steve Bannon.”\n\nAt one point, as I read him a series of further examples of how Bannon was said to have, as Wolff summarized in 2021, “conducted a riotously entertaining monologue about Trump and his family’s stupidity, avarice, incompetence, and corruption,” Bannon protests that if all this were true, “Why would Trump and I be this close today?” Which is, indeed, in all kinds of ways, the question.\n\nThe most explicitly damning material comes from the later books, but it was Fire and Fury that drew Trump’s “Sloppy Steve” pushback and so whose contents Trump presumably has some knowledge of. One passage—which I also read back to Bannon—strikes me as particularly relevant, again not so much for what it says about Trump’s capabilities (a debate that has its own life out in the world) but for how Trump might feel about someone who has questioned them like this: “Steve Bannon was telling people he thought there was a 33.3 percent chance that the Mueller investigation would lead to the impeachment of the president, a 33.3 percent chance that Trump would resign, perhaps in the wake of a threat by the cabinet to act on the Twenty-fifth Amendment (by which the cabinet can remove the president in the event of his incapacitation), and a 33.3 percent chance that he would limp to the end of his term. In any event, there would certainly not be a second term, or even an attempt at one. ‘He’s not going to make it,’ said Bannon at the Breitbart Embassy. ‘He’s lost his stuff.’ ”\n\n\n\n“No,” Bannon tells me. “I don’t remember saying that.”\n\nI mention other sources I’ve come across that seem to echo, and attribute to Bannon, something of the same idea. One is a quote I read in an interview with the 60 Minutes producer Ira Rosen, promoting a book he had written, referring to how Bannon had told him about Trump showing signs of early-stage dementia and raising the genuine possibility that because of this, Trump might be removed from office by the Twenty-fifth Amendment.\n\n“Nonsense,” says Bannon when I relay what Rosen said. “Total nonsense. And I’ve never talked to Rosen, ever, except for the 60 Minutes interview, ever.” Bannon further argues that for that 60 Minutes interview, he had agreed to answer questions on anything—if he had said this to the show’s producer, why didn’t they ask about it in the interview? “No, I certainly never had that opinion. I don’t ever remember expressing it. President Trump—look how sharp he is today. I don’t remember anybody ever questioning his ability to perform the office.”\n\nI ask him how he feels, if so, about a story like this being out there.\n\n“It’s irrelevant. Nobody talks about it. Trump knows it’s bullshit. I didn’t even know he’d written a book. Have you heard anybody talk about that? Listen, I sell books—just the mention of Bannon and you can make whatever. . . . This is why, if I had to chase down every . . . remember, I’m an anti-Semite, I’m a white nationalist . . .”\n\nAnd, for now, we talk of other things.\n\nWhatever Bannon did or didn’t once say about him, his proximity to Trump and his ideas has certainly had marked legal consequences. Bannon was somewhere in the orbit of the events of January 6, 2021. He was part of strategic Washington hotel discussions in the days before and spoke to Trump both in the morning and evening of January 6, but beyond that he has refused to clarify much further. Whether out of abstract principle or contrariness or because he had secrets he didn’t want to tell, Bannon refused to comply with a subpoena to testify before the select committee investigating January 6. He was subsequently charged with contempt of Congress, found guilty, and sentenced to four months in prison, a verdict he is appealing.\n\nBrandon Bell Bannon at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in 2022. He routinely fosters the notion among his followers that he is close with former president Trump.\n\nThat is not the only legal peril he has been facing. In August 2020, Bannon was one of four men accused of diverting funds from a nonprofit, We Build the Wall, established to raise money for the private construction of barriers on the U. S.–Mexico border. If Bannon expected support from a president neck-deep in reelection maneuverings, none was forthcoming. “I didn’t like that project,” said Trump when the news of Bannon’s arrest broke. “I thought that was a project that was being done for showboating reasons.” (Bannon blames others for this: “That’s what Jared had told him. . . . Knowing the facts as he knows them now, he’s, I think, very supportive.”) Bannon’s three codefendants are now in jail. And Bannon? On Trump’s final day in office, he was pardoned.\n\nI ask Bannon how he got the pardon.\n\n“I have no idea,” he avers. “It was just him.”\n\nYou must have advocated for it.\n\n“No, never.”\n\nReally?\n\n“No. Never advocated.” Bannon adds that he believes Rudy Giuliani may have brought it up “of his own volition.”\n\nBut you must have been pleased for it to happen?\n\n“Sure. Definitely. There’s no doubt about that. I think that’s President Trump. I think he can think these things through.”\n\nWhy do you think he did it?\n\n“I think he did it because he knows I’m an honest guy.”\n\nNot that the whole affair is behind him. In September 2022, Bannon was indicted on state charges, which are unaffected by a presidential pardon, related to the same events. He claims to be unworried. “I have no doubt I’ll be exonerated at trial,” he says. “I never took one penny from this.” Likewise, when it comes to the four-month sentence he already faces, he professes to be “100 percent confident” that he will never serve any time. He talks about all these legal matters as though they’re just bothersome, minor paperwork errors that will be corrected in due course. It’s hard to determine how much of this is smart strategic thinking and clearheaded analysis, how much is unanchored self-belief, and how much is pure bluff.\n\n\n\nThose things Bannon told me in Arizona, when pushing back against people who had reported comments he had made in earlier times about Trump . . . afterward, I can’t figure them out. Did he think I wouldn’t check further? Had he really reshaped the past in his memory to better fit the present? Does he genuinely think none of it really matters? Or did he just think that handling these questions as he did was the best tactic, however strong or weak his hand?\n\nEither way, much of what he said that was checkable seems to have been wildly far from the truth. First, Michael Wolff. Bannon had eventually indicated to me that his initial contact with Wolff came in April 2017, in the first hundred days of the Trump presidency. Many of the details contradicting this are in Wolff’s books, and I also spoke with Wolff to clarify things further. Wolff describes first encountering Bannon at the Orlando airport in early 2016, when it was Bannon, who was still running Breitbart News, who recognized and approached Wolff. That summer, soon after Bannon took over the Trump campaign, he invited Wolff up to Trump Tower. “I probably saw him three or four times that fall,” Wolff says; they carried on speaking throughout his time in the White House. “I liked him,” says Wolff. “I mean, he was an enormous pleasure to spend time with. He could not have been more open, more accessible—a better source and better company.” When I tell Wolff that Bannon pushed back against the notion that they had logged hundreds of hours of conversation over the years, he says, “Well, it’s all on tape.” He confirms that he heard Bannon’s disparaging summary of Trump’s chances, and of Trump having lost his stuff, directly from Bannon. “Oh yeah, many times,” Wolff says. “I mean, possibly he’s convinced himself otherwise. I don’t know. As I say, I have not spoken to him in some amount of time, but he’s come to make his money off of a different point of view. He knows where his bread is buttered. He plays a role. I mean, in a sense, when I was with him he was just playing a different role. At the time, he was the apostate Trump, the clear-eyed person, and all of the other people were incredible sycophants.”\n\nThen there’s Ira Rosen, the 60 Minutes producer whom Bannon claimed to barely know, telling me he only ever spoke to him for the 60 Minutes interview. I get hold of a copy of Rosen’s book, Ticking Clock: Behind the Scenes at 60 Minutes. The story it tells is so at odds with what Bannon professed that it is staggering. Rosen explains how he first met Bannon when working on a 60 Minutes story about insider trading in Washington—this was back in 2011—and how Bannon subsequently became someone he would meet up with periodically when Bannon was in New York. Rosen would trawl for gossip about Fox’s Roger Ailes while Bannon “encouraged me to do stories about the Washington swamp.” Immediately after Bannon took over the Trump campaign, Rosen, too, was invited up to the campaign headquarters. In his book, Rosen details some of their interactions and conversations, noting in passing that he and Bannon have exchanged more than a thousand text messages.\n\n\n\nCamerique/ClassicStock In 1993 Bannon, then an investment banker, was hired to help run Biosphere 2, near Tucson, a domed system of man-made environments where humans can practice subsistence. His brother, Chris, is still involved.\n\nAs for what Rosen says that Bannon told him about Trump’s purported dementia? One very good reason this didn’t form part of the substance of Bannon’s 60 Minutes interview is that these exchanges took place in the weeks and months afterward. Here is what Rosen wrote: “His criticism of Trump privately to me took on a different tone. He believed Trump was suffering from early-stage dementia and that there was a real possibility he would be removed from office by the Twenty-fifth Amendment, where the cabinet could vote that the president was no longer mentally capable of carrying out his duties. Bannon began to push that story hard. Bannon said that the president had no attention span, didn’t read, and now doesn’t listen. He said Trump repeats himself a lot, telling the same story minutes after he told it before.” In the book, Rosen describes how he sent Bannon an extract from a David Brooks column in The New York Times recounting that a group of senators recently meeting with Trump had seen “a president so repetitive and rambling, some thought he might be suffering from early Alzheimer’s,” and that Bannon texted back, “You need to do the 25th amendment piece . . . BTW brother I never steer u wrong.” I call up Rosen, who reaffirms that all of this is documented.\n\nAfter I leave Arizona, Bannon texts me intermittently, but the tempo increases as the battle toward a possible government shutdown nears. “Next couple of weeks going to be crazy nasty,” he predicts. “Toxic and Lit.” Reading his texts and watching his shows, I find it difficult to determine how much he is reporting on events and how much he may be playing a role in orchestrating them. (He certainly often seems to know what is going to happen next well before it happens.)\n\nA couple days before the shutdown deadline at the end of September, I visit Bannon in Washington. He returned from Arizona earlier that week. The burned-up palm tree, he updates me, has been taken down—“It broke my heart,” he says—but he’s still resisting its replacement by a shorter tree. He wants one the same size. He chooses to offer the following troubling analogy: He was always adamant that they should have built back the World Trade Center towers exactly where they were but one foot taller. “I want my palm tree,” he says.\n\nWe are in the Breitbart Embassy, just a couple blocks from the Capitol. (Bannon has War Room studios in various homes, but this is the principal one.) As ever, he is personally affable in a way that offers an almost baffling contrast to so many of his words and opinions. It’d be convenient to assume that this is all a front, that he is working me, but while I certainly don’t discount that component, for the most part I think that’s too easy an explanation. Whoever Steve Bannon in messy aggregate actually is, I don’t think you can begin to understand him without acknowledging that this version—the often considerate, genial, self-deprecating, open-to-other-opinions one—is, maybe confoundingly, a real part of him, too.\n\nI expect today’s conversation to be awkward. After we spend maybe an hour scuffling back and forth on other matters, I move to the lengthy list of statements and disavowals he made in Arizona that don’t seem to tally with what I’ve since found. Regarding his interactions with Michael Wolff, Bannon initially reiterates that he first met Wolff when he was in the White House but when pressed now recalls an earlier encounter the previous fall when Wolff was writing an article for The Hollywood Reporter. But we reach an impasse over many of the opinions and words Wolff describes and quotes Bannon as saying. “You have to come to your own assessment,” Bannon eventually declares. “You’re the writer. This shouldn’t be a tough one you have to struggle with. Two people have very different opinions.”\n\nI know, but one of them has got the quotes and the documented record of it, and I find it very hard to get past that.\n\n“Then you’re going to have to write that that’s true and that I’m lying to you and I misled you. I don’t have a problem with that.”\n\nOkay.\n\n“This is not an existential moment.”\n\nIt feels to me that what he is saying here is something like this: People like you are hung up on the quaint idea that it’s truth that always matters the most. Sure, it has its uses, but in the big picture—and especially when things really heat up—it’s often way down any sensible list of priorities.\n\nWhen I move on to Ira Rosen and remind Bannon what he told me about only speaking to Rosen around the 60 Minutes interview, he immediately says, “Yes,” agreeing with himself. I explain that Rosen’s book gives a very different impression. “I don’t care what he says in his book,” Bannon retorts. I press on regardless.\n\nWould you agree that you were constantly texting each other?\n\n“I don’t remember that. So he’s got the text?”\n\nYeah. He says he has more than a thousand texts.\n\n“Are they in the book?”\n\nSome of them.\n\n“I don’t remember.”\n\nAre you saying they don’t exist?\n\n“I’m saying I don’t remember being in constant contact with Ira Rosen.”\n\nIt feels obvious to me that here and elsewhere Bannon is navigating a careful, evanescently thin line: repudiating what he can and then otherwise saying that he doesn’t remember, whether or not these are things someone could credibly fail to remember, rather than fully calling anyone a liar, with all the awkward new doors that might open.\n\nWhen I remind Bannon that Rosen’s name first came up, back in Arizona, when I read him Rosen’s quote about the Twenty-fifth Amendment, Bannon protests with renewed confidence as he did before—grounds for repudiation!—that if this were true it would have been asked about in the 60 Minutes interview. When I point out that this all took place after that, Bannon recalibrates his defense. “How did I have that then?” he says, as though he was suddenly so removed from Trump world that he would have had no means of judging anything like that about his former boss. “I didn’t speak to Trump for years,” he says. “That’s ridiculous.” (Aside from the fact that this contradicts both the general impression he has given me and others and his description to me of the call Trump made to him in Hong Kong after the 60 Minutes interview, Bannon is on more formal record stating otherwise. When he was interviewed by the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence investigating purported Trump ties to Russia, on January 16, 2018, he was asked how many times he had spoken with Trump since leaving the White House. At first he answered, “I don’t remember,” but when pressed, “Is it more than ten?” he replied, “Yes.”)\n\nI say that Rosen claims to have all of this documented and read to Bannon his own text about the Twenty-fifth Amendment.\n\n“Okay, well, then you’ll have to go with . . .” He pauses. “I don’t remember that. And I don’t remember having that relationship with Ira Rosen.”\n\nA couple minutes later, Bannon tries a different tack. “Haven’t you been in the same situation as those two guys? Have I told you anything untoward to the president? That’s a yes-or-no question.”\n\nI agree that he has not.\n\n“Okay, fine,” he says, as though a point has been proved.\n\nI suggest that the real takeaway is maybe that he used to share a lot of uncareful thoughts with people and that he’s learned not to do so.\n\nDrew Angerer Trump speaks by phone to Russian president Vladimir Putin from the Oval Office on January 28, 2017, accompanied by, from left, Chief of Staff Reince Priebus, Vice President Mike Pence, and Bannon, then the White House Chief Strategist.\n\n“Then you’re going to have to write it how you have to write it,” he says. “We just have a disagreement. I think I’ve been very straightforward. Did we put any restrictions on this at all? You’re going to write what you’re going to write. You will lay out your case about Steve Bannon the way you see it. It’s your perspective. I have no problem with that. I’m not sitting here trying to talk you out of it: ‘Oh, please don’t . . .’ You just got to do what you got to do. Can I say something else? It’s also—it’s meaningless. But you ought to write it as you see it.”\n\nI ask him to explain what he means by “it’s meaningless.”\n\n“Because everybody knows that my loyalty to this movement and to him are unquestioned. If you look at the demonstrable record, there’s not even a question of who’s gone out of their way to support Trump the man and Trump the politician and the Trump movement. That’s just irrefutable fact. A couple of guys saying, ‘Hey, he said this, he said this’? That’s fine. I disagree with that. I don’t remember it. I don’t remember having long relationships with Michael Wolff or with particularly Ira Rosen. But I feel quite comfortable with my place in history, juxtaposed to what I’ve accomplished and what we’re accomplishing here. I feel pretty damn good.”\n\nHe says this as though it should, or even could, prove that the other stuff—the leaking and the careless trash-talking—is not true. (Bannon likes to use false binaries as a rhetorical device.) But of course they can both be true, and I suspect that they probably both broadly are. I try to return to the main reason, weeks ago, that I was asking about any of this—its effect, or otherwise, on his relationship with Trump. I begin by saying that although perhaps Trump is not aware chapter and verse of all this stuff that’s been published—at which point Bannon interrupts.\n\n“Oh, he knows it,” says Bannon. “Trust me. Anything has been published, they have put under his nose many times.”\n\nWe talk about different ways someone like Trump might view all this, and I float the possibility that Trump might allow someone like Bannon back in but that one’s card is nonetheless marked permanently, and one would never really be trusted. Bannon surprises me by allowing this possibility.\n\n“It may be,” he says. “It may be. Time will tell on that.”\n\nBoth in Arizona and in Washington, Bannon seemed keen that I should speak with Trump. Esquire sent the former president a series of questions about his and Bannon’s relationship but received no response.\n\nBy now I’ve spent a couple months watching War Room every day. I don’t agree with much, and I sometimes worry that I’m getting desensitized to thoughts that in clear fresh air would horrify me, but there are parts that I can just about see as fair’s-fair strong partisan advocacy. When it comes to issues like immigration and the war in Ukraine and the debt ceiling, while one might strongly dispute much of what is presented as fact, and the conclusions reached, these are nonetheless real, difficult quandaries where there exist good reasons for sensible, thoughtful people to disagree. Sometimes, though—a lot of the vaccine stuff, for instance—it just seems to me like crazy conspiratorial nonsense. Likewise the way in which disasters of almost any kind—the fire in Maui, the war in Israel, for instance—are opportunistically grabbed, with what seems to me as sickening glee, as notional proof of tendentious, and again often conspiratorial, government malfeasance. And every now and again what is broadcast seems just so nasty and vengeful and wrongheaded that I feel soiled just watching. As an example, there’s a recurrent subtext, dog-whistled but perfectly transparent, often when child trafficking is being discussed, that intimates in true QAnon style that some broad coalition of the Democratic and Hollywood establishment consists of pedophiles. Both what is being said and the manipulative if-you’re-smart-and-paying- attention-you’ll-know wink are repellent.\n\nAs accustomed as I become to all this, sometimes my reactions take me by surprise. One Wednesday in mid-September, Bannon launches into a sustained invective against Merrick Garland that, somehow, seems to step so far, heedlessly and recklessly, over any line. It’s the words themselves—“he is a purely evil individual . . . and he will pay for the evilness when we imprison him”—but also how insensibly and self-righteously angry Bannon seems. It makes good enough sense for Bannon, from his perspective, to disagree with Garland, and also to question whether Garland’s every decision is made in good faith. And I certainly doubt that Garland is without his flaws. But this attack just seems both wildly poisonous and, in its scale and certainty, empirically wrong. As Bannon himself says, history reveals. I suppose history could endorse Bannon’s view, but all my instincts are that there is no sensible reason for thinking this to be true, wherever you stand politically—and that to proclaim this, never mind potentially inspire people to act on its basis, goes unacceptably beyond fighting one’s corner.\n\nAt one point during our conversation in Washington, Bannon challenges me. “Do you think I believe this?” he asks, meaning what he advocates sitting here in the War Room studio. I explain, quite honestly, that I have thought about this question a lot. And then I tell him how shocked I was by the Merrick Garland diatribe.\n\n“I think Merrick Garland is evil. I shocked you?”\n\nYes, it really shocks me. Not only do I think you’re wrong; I think it’s disgusting that you think that.\n\n“Okay. Okay.”\n\nI can’t believe that there’s anything that you know that gives you the prerogative to think that.\n\n“Why do you say that? All the facts are out there of what he’s done. Look, he’s overseen rolling up of a thousand of these people. This one guy we talked about yesterday is three years hadn’t gone to trial. That’s pure evil of what he’s done about the J Six thing. Pure evil.”\n\nThat’s not evil. The whole thing was a complete shit show, and the rule of law is slowly working its way through it.\n\n“It’s not the rule of law. Upgrading to terrorism charges?”\n\nThere’s plenty to argue about there. I think Garland is trying to do his job. Evil? I don’t agree at all.\n\nChip Somodevilla Florida Republican Matt Gaetz (second from left, next to Tennessee Republican Tim Burchett), speaks to reporters in October 2023 during maneuverings over the House speakership. Gaetz, who made efforts to win concessions for MAGA Republicans, was a frequent guest on Bannon’s show during the chaotic run-up to a potential government shutdown.\n\n“This is the unbridgeable gap in the country. They think we’re evil. I saw last night! They think we’re building the Confederate army. That’s on MSNBC. That’s their belief. We’re building the Confederate army. They think we are pure evil. They think we’re racist. They think we’re domestic terrorists. They think we’re insurgents. This is what they think. And we think they’re evil. And you’re not going to bridge that gap.”\n\nBut that’s a tragedy.\n\n“Why is it a tragedy?”\n\nBecause in those terms, I think that you’re both wrong. (That is to say, insomuch as Bannon’s extreme characterization of the “other” side is accurate.)\n\n“Okay. You’re a reasonable man in the middle. You can weigh in measuring—you’re a kindhearted person, you think both sides are wrong. It’s like Ecclesiastes. It’s just not your time. I hate to say it: It’s just not your time. It’s us versus them. They hate us and we hate them. One side’s going to win here. And it’s going to get ugly. It’s going to get messy.”\n\nIn the days around and after my Washington trip, Bannon becomes far more visibly at the center of things.\n\n\n\nEven so, the looming end-of-September shutdown at first seems to play like something of a humiliation for him. His preference seemed to be for a disorderly shutdown, or at the very least for there to be major concessions to the MAGA wing. His show has been filled with those like Matt Gaetz maneuvering for this, and Bannon appears to be deeply involved in the strategizing. Then, on the final afternoon, Speaker of the House Kevin McCarthy makes a last-minute deal with the Democrats. The tempo of Bannon’s texts had been increasing, but after that, contact dries up and I assume that he is smarting. Gaetz has consistently said, and Bannon has echoed loudly, that if McCarthy did anything like this, Gaetz would move for McCarthy’s removal. Now Gaetz must either back down and look weak or press ahead, but the conventional wisdom is that his bluff has been called and he will be put in his place. Either hardcore MAGA Republicans will blanch at taking this final step or the Democrats will passively or actively move to allow McCarthy’s survival; Gaetz will be isolated as an extremist renegade.\n\nI’m traveling, so I don’t learn the result of the vote at the time. Not for another six minutes, anyway, when my phone pings with a two-word text from Bannon: “Told Ya.” McCarthy has gone, Congress is in turmoil, and things have played out Bannon’s way. By the end of the week, Bannon is back on the front cover of The New York Times, photographed in mid-broadcast, jabbing the index finger of his left hand to drive home a point.\n\nStill, after that, it zigs and zags back and forth. Candidates opposed by Bannon, candidates supported by him, crash and burn all the same. After two weeks of this, I text him, asking what way he sees out of this chaos. Or, I add, is the chaos okay?\n\nHis answer comes back immediately.\n\n“Chaos,” he writes, “is our friend.”\n\nThis, of course, is just a skirmish. Just a minor messiness. When the MAGA–friendly Mike Johnson eventually prevails as Speaker, I get a sense that for Bannon this is less a major victory than a fruitful bit of low-level agitation. The real mess, the real chaos, the real if-you-tear-it-down-they-will-come rupture . . . if Steve Bannon has his way, and he seems hell-bent on doing so, that is still to come.",

        "source": "https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/",
        "content": "As long as nobody calls it a cult or anything.\n\nOn Monday, two United States senators, Tommy Tuberville and J.D. Vance, took a pilgrimage to the Manhattan courthouse in which Michael Cohen was explaining to a jury everything he did while being paid by the former president* to be a schmuck to the entire outside world. By all accounts, Cohen was a model witness, though we should hold all tickets on that bet until we see how he does under cross-examination. Far more interesting were the two legislative acolytes who came to pay homage. It’s like the courthouse is now Fatima, with farts. From Politico:\n\nOn Monday, former Trump attorney Michael Cohen faced ridicule from Trump’s entourage visiting the courthouse, including GOP Sens. J.D. Vance of Ohio and Tommy Tuberville of Alabama, as the prosecution’s star witness had his first day on the stand. “This guy is a convicted felon who admitted in his testimony that he secretly recorded his former employer, that he only did it once allegedly, and that this was supposed to help Donald Trump,” Vance told reporters outside the courthouse. “Does any reasonable, sensible person believe anything that Michael Cohen says?”\n\n“We got a courtroom, this most depressing thing I’ve ever been in,” Tuberville said. “Mental anguish is trying to be pushed on the Republican candidate for the president of the United States.”\n\nAnd they weren’t alone. The senators were joined in their witness by Rep. Nicole Malliotakis, Republican of New York, as well as the attorneys general of Iowa and Alabama, who apparently have little to do these days. Taxpayers in those two states certainly got their money’s worth paying the salaries of these two clucks. Moreover, Tuesday promised even more pilgrims to the shrine. Vivek Ramaswamy, re-emerging from having his operating systems updated, promised to come and pay tribute, as did Speaker of the House of Representatives Mike Johnson.\n\nFor the benefit of those keeping score at home, Speaker Moses, who is a very good Christian man, is going to New York to support an unapologetic defendant in a criminal scheme that violated at least half the Ten Commandments. That should be a tinhorn tent revival of a type unseen since Jimmy Swaggart took to the podium and tearfully copped to doing missionary work in various motels in the neighborhood we like to call Out by the Airport. It is Politico’s analysis that these pilgrims are coming to court in order to meet the press and say all the stuff the defendant can’t say because Judge Juan Merchan may toss him in the hoosegow. How did these young journos ever get so cynical?",

        "source": "https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/",
        "content": "(Permanent Musical Accompaniment to This Post)\n\nBeing our semi-regular weekly survey of what’s goin’ down in the several states where, as we know, the real work of governmentin’ gets done and where it looks like nothing but rain.\n\nWe begin in Wisconsin, where we check in on the country’s most superheated state supreme court race and discover that a certain wealthy South African chain-saw enthusiast has decided to have his fun by perverting the democratic process one more time. From the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel:\n\nMusk took to X, the social media platform he owns, to announce Wednesday evening that “Scott A.” from Green Bay had won the sum for signing Musk’s “Petition in Opposition to Activist Judges.” The petition was announced late last week on the X account of Musk’s super PAC, America PAC. It offers $100 in cash to people who sign the election petition but does not mention a $1 million giveaway.\n\n“Crazy Elon ... his prices are ... INSANE!”\n\nThe $1 million giveaway was initially announced by America PAC, though the super PAC’s spending records make no mention of that payment. More than $2 million in independent expenditures in recent days have been for texting, field operations and canvassing.\n\nLet us once again thank Baal for the wisdom of former Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy who, when confronted with the case of Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission, was moved to make this remark.\n\nWe now conclude that independent expenditures, including those made by corporations, do not give rise to corruption or the appearance of corruption. … The fact that speakers [editor’s note: i.e., donors] may have influence over or access to elected officials does not mean that these officials are corrupt. … The appearance of influence or access, furthermore, will not cause the electorate to lose faith in our democracy.\n\nGood call, Anthony.\n\nAt issue in Wisconsin is the ideological balance of the state supreme court. Democrat Susan Crawford is being challenged by career wing nut Brad Schimel. The race is now the most expensive state judicial race in history, and have I mentioned recently what a terrible idea an elected judiciary is? A Schimel victory, and a conservative majority on the Wisconsin court, likely would re-gerrymander the state legislature.\n\nMusk wrote that the next award would be announced Friday. He has spent about $20 million backing conservative Supreme Court candidate Brad Schimel in Tuesday’s election, when Schimel will go head-to-head against liberal Dane County Judge Susan Crawford. Musk’s spending has made him the single largest spender in the race that an election watchdog group has predicted could top a record-breaking $100 million in spending.\n\nCrawford’s campaign spokesman slammed Musk and Schimel over the payouts. “It turns out that Schimel is such a bad candidate that Elon Musk will spend whatever it takes to prop up Schimel’s failing campaign in a corrupt attempt to buy influence on the Supreme Court for his company’s lawsuit,” spokesman Derrick Honeyman said in a statement, referencing the lawsuit by another Musk company, Tesla, against the State of Wisconsin. “It’s corrupt, it’s extreme, and it’s disgraceful to our state and judiciary.”\n\nBut not “corrupt.” Ask Mr. Justice Kennedy.\n\nWe move along to North Carolina, where another supreme court race continues to stagger on because the Republican candidate declines to accept defeat, choosing instead to challenge a huge number of ballots on what are apparently bogus grounds. Republican Jefferson Griffin lost to incumbent Democrat Allison Riggs by 734 votes. This result has been certified through two recounts. He now has gone to a court of appeals to argue that the election rules should be changed retroactively and thousands of votes be tossed out. The grounds are spurious at best; Griffin seeks to eliminate ballots cast by voters whose registrations lacked driver’s license or Social Security numbers even though neither was required at the time of the election.\n\nAs it happens, on Monday, the Supreme Court of the United States heard arguments in Louisiana v. Callais, another critical voting-rights case, this one aimed at gutting section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, which is the last viable element of that landmark bill left functioning after the carefully manufactured conservative majority on the court got done with it. At issue was a court order mandating that Louisiana create a second majority-minority district. A good measure of section 2’s future is the fact that even the lawyers arguing Louisiana’s case told the court that they thought section 2 was unconstitutional but that they followed it anyway. Thanks, folks. However, the liberal justices, most notably Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson, noticed that one side seemed to be arguing that it could ignore an adverse ruling. As we know, there’s a lot of that going around. Jackson said:\n\nI mean, I ... am sort of concerned about your view—as seemingly expressed, and I want you to clarify it—that a court order compelling you to do something is not a good reason for you to do it.\n\nKagan, meanwhile, was struck by the fact that the people opposed to the new district kept getting beaten in court, only to come back for more.\n\nSo ... I get the idea that it did have the option to keep on finding ways to litigate this question, but ... there were ways that it could have refused to give up. I take that point. But at some point, it said ... we’ve been told we’re wrong by seven judges, and we’re going to accept that and we’re going to move on and find a map. And then the state lawyers come in and ... the record is the state lawyer says there can be no better reasons to believe that the VRA required a second majority Black district than a precedential opinion of the Fifth Circuit affirming that a map with a single majority Black district likely violated section 2. And the state lawyer talks about all the process that they went through and all—and hearing that they had and the maps that were submitted. And she says what better reason could there be for this?\n\nRepublicans simply do not lose elections. That is a hard and fast rule in American politics. They just run out the clock, and the clock never reaches zero.\n\nAnd we conclude, as is our custom, in the great state of Oklahoma, whence Blog Official Oyster Shucker Friedman of the Algarve brings us the tale of some ducks who seem to have a very good class action lawsuit. From KFOR:\n\nNine ducks are now recovering after diesel fuel leaked into a duck pond at the University of Oklahoma earlier this month. News 4 first reported on the ducks last week when residents voiced concerns about a strong chemical odor coming from the pond and an oily substance covering the ducks. The Department of Environmental Quality later told News 4 a power plant pump had malfunctioned, causing diesel to leak into the duck pond.\n\nOn Tuesday, News 4 learned that nine ducks were washed with a solution and are now undergoing waterproofing therapy in a special pool. While WildCare says the ducks do show signs of chemical burns, especially around the eyes, they currently don’t have any symptoms of gastrointestinal issues from swallowing the fuel. The ducks have been given medication that the organization hopes will reduce their chances of developing ulcers.\n\nSue ’em, boys. Get it while you can.\n\n\n\nThis is your democracy, America. Cherish it.\n\n\n\n",

Exodus, 23:1–2\n\n“I’m dedicating my life to being useful,” he says. “To my community, to my neighborhood, to my city. And to do that means letting go of some burdens of the past. Never forgetting, but forgiving. There is power in forgiving.”\n\nNORMAN JEAN ROY Salaam with his wife, Sanovia, and their son Yusef Jr. Note Salaam’s ring, which he designed himself to commemorate the exoneration.\n\nSpare a thought for the falsely accused. For the man sent to prison as a boy for something he didn’t do. Does anyone ever allow the reality of a false accusation to sink in and upset the equilibrium for even a moment, or is it just in and out and on to the next, like everything else? That accusation, after all, was leveled on our behalf. State power is derived from us. Justice is meant to make us whole. But what does an injustice do to us? When an innocent person serves a full prison sentence, gets out carrying the excruciating knowledge that justice is for other people and facts and innocence don’t matter when you’re a kid raised by your mom in an apartment on Fifth Avenue, uptown—Harlem, U. S. A. Spare a thought for the falsely accused.\n\nHe can’t walk down the street for getting stopped by people who have never met him but to whom he is famous. In this neighborhood, the man who was falsely accused is well-known. The elders have known him for decades, since he was a tall, skinny kid with a flattop, on the front page of all the papers. The city was coming apart in 1989—you could’ve lit the air with a match, the racial tension was that combustible. And the crime that he was accused of committing was so terrible that once he and his codefendants were identified to the public on the word of the police, the case was over before it even began. White victim, a young professional out for a jog in Central Park, raped and beaten nearly to death with a tree branch, three quarters of the blood in her body soaked into the ground. The accused were Black and brown, five of them, aged fourteen to sixteen, four confessing on videotape. What more is there to know? New York in the aftermath was a tinderbox, braying for justice, instead finding vengeance, which is supposed to belong only to God, according to God Himself.\n\nRead We are celebrating our 90th anniversary with a wildly ambitious package called The Next 90. Learn more about it, as well as Esquire’s living legacy, in this letter from Editor-in-Chief Michael Sebastian.\n\nA local man who had inherited a real estate fortune even took out full-page ads in all the local papers calling for the state to bring back the death penalty, writing: “What has happened to the respect for authority, the fear of retribution by the courts, society and the police for those who break the law . . . ?”\n\nBut that was a lifetime ago, and so some others here in Harlem seem to recognize the falsely accused man not as Yusef Salaam of the Central Park Five but as Yusef Salaam, current candidate for public office, running to represent Harlem on the New York City Council. He’s not yet even in office, but the expectation invested in him is daunting. On the street, Harlemites are taking him in, greeting him with broad smiles and queuing up for selfies, bumping elbows and shaking hands, happy that this gracious man of forty- nine has not only come through the time the state stole from him without bitterness but has agreed to be a voice for the ambitions, grievances, and despair of this beautiful, historic, and desperate neighborhood in America’s largest city. He has a ready smile and a welcoming face. “Blessings, blessings, blessings!” he will greet old friends and new. As a politician, he is a complete novice, but for the retail politicking that is the bedrock of democracy—hearing from people on the street where they live—he has a natural gift. He is inexperienced enough at the game that he will stay and talk until you’re done with him. And a city-council district may be democracy in its purest form—big enough to require a proper campaign in order to prove your worth, small enough that an officeholder, especially a rookie, might legitimately feel responsible for every soul and pothole in it.\n\nSalaam likens any neighborhood to a human body, and each of us to cells in the body—if you put healthy, nutritious food into a body and take care to educate the mind, do things in moderation and get good rest, the body will be functioning, flourishing, and happy. If you eat badly or partake in unhealthy habits, do drugs or sleep irregularly, then the body gets sick. Dies. It’s not a bad metaphor for how society works, and it allows for just how interdependent we actually are much more than our current politics does. If some of us are left out or are doing poorly, the health of all of society is put at risk.\n\nThe needs of this body, of Salaam’s neighborhood, are intense. And as he makes his way up and down its streets, from all sides, his fellow Harlemites come to him:\n\n“You know how long it’s been since the senior center had a coat of paint?” says a man holding a cue stick at the Lieutenant Joseph P. Kennedy Jr. Center. “And we sure could use another pool table—gives people a place to gather in the evenings. . . .”\n\nNORMAN JEAN ROY\n\nThis article appeared in the 90th Anniversary issue of Esquire\n\nsubscribe\n\nA woman buttonholes him at a community meeting at Graham Court, a Gilded Age gem on Adam Clayton Powell Jr. Boulevard that has seen better days: “What are you going to do about the defecation and the urination that goes on outside my front door?!”\n\n“I applied for affordable housing, but affordable housing ain’t affordable!” says a man who stops him on 135th Street and comes in for a hug. “We need a two-bedroom, and they’ve had us in a studio for twenty years! . . . I sound Black, right?” He is Asian, and points this out by circling his face with his index finger. “People here don’t look like me, but they sure live like me.” He complains to Salaam about the conduct of corrections officers. “But they just scared. I don’t talk from no textbook—I did fifteen years.” As Salaam begins to walk away to his next appointment, the man reaches out for his hand and issues a plea: “You’ve come too far. Don’t sell yourself out.”\n\nAn older woman on 110th Street stops short of asking for his attention, instead holding back as he speaks to a small cluster of people. Her eyes brimming with tears, she clutches your arm and shakes it gently. “I just can’t get over how much time he lost,” she says. “They are so hard on our men.”\n\nYou point to him and say that Salaam somehow seems unbroken by an experience that might well have destroyed him—publicly vilified at fifteen, wrongfully convicted at sixteen, imprisoned for almost seven years in appalling conditions upstate, on parole for three years, required to register as a sex offender for another three. She dabs her eyes with a tissue and shakes her head hopefully.\n\nEvery concern, every conceivable “issue” that a human life encounters finds its way to Salaam on these streets—hunger, housing security, economic insecurity, public safety, public health, lousy landlords, race discrimination, the human capacity to produce trash, the human tendency to triple- park, for starters.\n\nSpare a thought for the city-council candidate. We drive from Central Harlem down toward his old neighborhood at the northeast corner of Central Park, and Salaam is careful not to go a tick over the speed limit. He’s been pulled over during the campaign and is very mindful not to give anyone any excuse to interrupt his peaceful movements. He pulls into a parking space on 110th Street across from Central Park, not a hundred yards from the building he lived in growing up, just a few hundred yards from the spot in the park where the state said he had committed the crime that altered the course of his life. Salaam hops out of the car and walks around to the passenger side, opens the door for his mother, a soft-spoken woman of regal bearing with shoulder-length salt-and-pepper dreadlocks, who steps out onto the sidewalk, into the neighborhood that her son will soon represent on the New York City Council. Yusef starts to walk his mother in the direction of home when a young man, slight and intense and wearing a backpack, approaches him.\n\n“Excuse me,” the young man says. “You’re running for office?”\n\n“Yes,” Salaam says. “I recently won the Democratic primary.” He smiles. “And my opponent in November is apathy.”\n\n“His opponent in November is Write In,” his mother corrects.\n\n“Okay, great,” says the young man. “Let me ask you—what’s the . . . what’s the point?”\n\nSalaam hesitates for just a moment, uncomprehending. “The point of . . .” He leans forward toward the man, as if trying to better pick up his signal. “. . . running for office?\n\n“No,” the young man answers. “I’m out here every two and four years, and I listen to all of you, and I just need to know What’s the point?” He flashes a brilliant smile and projects a crackling energy. There’s a touch of violence in his eyes. In this moment, though, he is intently waiting for an answer.\n\n“Well,” Salaam says, “I believe that in this neighborhood we hold great power that we have never fully exercised. We are too busy dividing ourselves, going after each other—”\n\nThe young man interrupts. “We play by their rules—they play by no rules,” he says. “Oh, they go on about their rules and their Constitution, but when it comes to keeping n***ers down, they just make it up as they go!”\n\n“Okay, okay,” Salaam says. “Now, I know something about them keeping us down.”\n\nIt is pretty clear that the young man doesn’t know who Salaam is. He looks to be about thirty, and although he grew up in Harlem, he likely wasn’t yet born when Salaam was sent to prison. He interrupts again.\n\n“I’m sure you’ve been through some things,” he says. “Well, I’ve experienced some things, too.”\n\nThe air between them bristles.\n\n“Tell me about your life, brother,” Salaam says.\n\nThe young man has a wide view and is well versed in politics, local and national—and he speaks urgently. He also has a specific issue. He sells weed, is an “entrepreneur,” and has been paying keen attention to the city’s pronouncements and actions, as over the past two years, Harlem has steadily filled with smoke shops that are killing his business. “I’m trying to figure out why outsiders are now selling legal marijuana on our streets. These shops aren’t licensed and could be a danger to the public. I want to participate in the legit economy, but these motherfuckers . . .”\n\nSalaam has been watching the young man closely as he flashes rage with his eyes and immediately takes it back with his smile. An astonishing dynamic is emerging on this sidewalk in Harlem. Yusef Salaam, who had every reason to give up on society, or “the system,” or America, is straining to prevent the young man from doing the same. And the young man, well, he is desperate for a reason to believe and is not yet sure that he is finding it.\n\n“Brother, we are trapped inside of someone else’s hundred-year plan,” Salaam says. “The only way to break out of it and make our own plan is together. The only thing I know is that we as a community have never used our power—”\n\n“Is there a we?!” the young man snaps. “Am I a we?” He flashes that smile as he looks inward, momentarily amused by the wordplay. “Who are we?”\n\nAnd then he drops the smile and levels his gaze. “Because I’m not playing—I’m ready to burn this motherfucker down. What is the strategy, and why should I give a shit in the first place? Why be involved?”\n\nSalaam: Because I know enough from when the spike wheels of “justice” ran over me and my family thirty-four years ago that if we are not involved and in numbers, and using our voice to change the world, then they will use our voices against us. Brother, you have to trust me when I say that divided, we won’t stand a chance.\n\nYoung man [more urgently this time]: Hear me out. Do we have to burn it down, or what kind of political changes you talking about?\n\nSalaam: I’m not a politician, brother.\n\nYoung man: Then what are you?\n\nSalaam: I’m you.\n\nNORMAN JEAN ROY The future councilman in Harlem. “There was a saying in my neighborhood: When the cops come looking for you, any n-i-g-g-e-r will do.” He is careful to spell out the word.\n\nThere were twenty boys rampaging in the park that night.\n\nThere were thirty-two. There were forty.\n\nIt was the Central Park Ten.\n\nThe Central Park Six.\n\nThe Central Park Five.\n\nThere was “plenty of physical evidence” linking the five to the attack.\n\nThere was no physical evidence linking any of the five to the attack.\n\nThe police interrogations were conducted by the book.\n\nThe defendants were coached, their confessions were coerced, and they were told that if they just admitted involvement in the jogger attack, they could go home.\n\nFor a case that has now been closed twice, there remains a lot in dispute. Well, maybe better to say that some very powerful people cling to a version of events that has since been abandoned as untrue. What is now clear is that the convictions of the Central Park Five were won in spite of grievous flaws in the evidence—perhaps it’s better to say in spite of a grievous lack of evidence. Because what is also now clear is that there was physical or biological evidence connecting only one person to the assault on the jogger that night—a person not among the five defendants. For that night in April 1989, there is no reliable accounting for exactly where those five teenagers were and when, nor exactly what they may or may not have been doing. Maybe better just to say that the Central Park Five didn’t commit the terrible crime for which they were convicted.\n\nWhat is not disputed is that on the night of April 19, 1989, a young investment banker named Trisha Meili was out for a run in Central Park when she was attacked, raped, viciously beaten, and left for dead in the bushes three hundred feet from the park’s 102nd Street crossover. Unconscious and near death, she would be found by passersby at 1:30 a.m.\n\nEarlier that evening, witnesses would tell police that some kids had been assaulting pedestrians near the Central Park reservoir, several blocks south. In response, cops had flooded the park and hauled a large group of teen–agers to the precinct located at the center of Central Park. Among them were fourteen-year-old Raymond Santana and fourteen-year-old Kevin Richardson, who did not know each other. The boys were expecting to be sent home when Meili’s near-lifeless body was found. A call from a detective at Metropolitan Hospital would stop their release and mark the beginning of a legal and social nightmare that would come to be recognized as one of the most shameful failures in the history of American justice.\n\nThe next day, April 20, based on descriptions from the boys already in custody, fifteen-year-old Antron McCray was also questioned by police. No one seems to know for sure how the police came to be looking for Yusef Salaam, but it seems that the cops had a description of another boy—tall kid with a flattop—that sounded like Yusef.\n\nSalaam’s brother Shareef had heard that the police were looking for his brother and begged him not to go outside that afternoon. Salaam’s sister, Aisha, remembers that Shareef, who was bigger than his older brother, wrestled Yusef to the floor to keep him from leaving the apartment. “Aisha!” Yusef yelled. “Get him off of me!” Shareef finally let go of his brother, and Aisha and Yusef took the elevator down to the lobby, where they ran into Yusef’s friend Korey Wise, sixteen, who also lived in the building. The building security guard told them that at least three police officers had just taken the elevator up to the Salaam apartment.\n\nAisha is the oldest of the siblings and says she thought that if she could just talk to the police, they’d understand their mistake. Her brother was a placid young man, averse to physical confrontations, she says. When a mugger once demanded his money, he emptied his pockets without hesitation. Another time, when Yusef was on his bike and a thief approached him and said, “Get off,” Yusef got off.\n\n“Let’s go up and talk to them,” Aisha Salaam remembers telling her brother. Korey Wise went upstairs with his friend and offered to go with Yusef to the precinct to keep him company. Those five—Santana, Richardson, McCray, Salaam, and Wise —would become the Central Park Five.\n\nWhen the police came for Yusef on the evening following the rape and beating of Trisha Meili, they knocked on his apartment door on the twenty- first floor of 1309 Fifth Avenue. Shareef Salaam answered the door in his underwear. Get dressed, you’re coming with us, they told him. What? Why? the confused teenager asked the cops. Are you Yusef Salaam? they asked. That’s my brother, he said. And that, Yusef Salaam says, is how close his brother came to also being a member of the Central Park Five.\n\n“There was a saying in my neighborhood,” Salaam tells me. “When the cops come looking for you, any n-i-g-g-e-r will do,” taking care to spell the word rather than say it.\n\nSharonne Salaam was a single mother who taught fashion design at Parsons School of Design in Greenwich Village. When she got home from work that evening, Aisha and Shareef were both hysterical that the police had taken Yusef in for questioning in connection with the crime that was exploding in the news across the city that day. Sharonne at first thought they were joking. She walked through the apartment, looking in closets and under beds. Okay, that’s enough—you can come out now. When she realized that her oldest son really wasn’t there, Sharonne sat Aisha and Shareef down and said, Calm down and tell me the full story again, from the beginning.\n\n“I was a pariah. They said I was born a mistake. I’m not a mistake,” Salaam tells me. “And I think that what I have been through gives me perspective on what people go through in life. I never thought about politics or holding elective office until recently, but I feel that this—I guess you might call it empathy—will be helpful to me as I serve my community. If, as Nietzsche says, you can find the why, then you can live any how. We all need a reason to live. This is mine. I was supposed to go through what I went through.”\n\nWe are sitting alone in a cluttered little office on 135th Street—a local Democratic club that doubles as his campaign office. There are mismatched photographs of past club officers on the wall, the flooring is peeling, and campaign literature is piled haphazardly on every surface. It was from here that Salaam took on and defeated two establishment candidates in the primary for his council seat. He now has a fully germinated idea of how his story fits into the larger story of loss and struggle and perseverance that defines the Black experience in this town and in this country, and he speaks it in full paragraphs, only occasionally lapsing into the rote poetry of the motivational speaker he now is. “For Black Americans, robbed of our names, our culture, our God, it is just a short step further to lose your mind, too,” he says. “But what if a person doesn’t lose his mind? What if a person instead taps back into the memory in Sankofa, which is the sacred knowledge from your past that enables you to live in your present?”\n\nHe takes special meaning and great comfort from this African concept—Sankofa—of looking back to live forward. With meaning comes purpose, with purpose comes acceptance. So that in part explains how he came through the fire, as his uncle Frank describes the experience. Many people never come through it but instead are consumed by it. The other part was the unstinting support of his mother, his grandmother, his siblings, and his uncle, who is a father figure. Without their belief, he says, he may well have lost his own.\n\nIt was Salaam’s grandmother who told him to find meaning in the tribulation. She told him, “Yusef, I don’t know why they’re doing this to you, but be still and listen.” When he was in prison, she wrote to him every week, addressing the letters to “Master Yusef Salaam,” because she wanted whoever processed the letters to know that her grandson was somebody.\n\nIt was Salaam’s mother who made sure that he did not confess on videotape, and he was the only one of the five who didn’t. It was Salaam’s mother who repeatedly refused consent for police to question Yusef. It was Salaam’s mother who insisted instead that her son be given an attorney and who told him to stop talking to investigators immediately. “She told me: ‘You will not participate in your own destruction,’ ” Salaam says. “They were breaking us down. They would have broken me, too, without my mother.”\n\nAfter his conviction, his mother would keep vigil at the prison, making the trip upstate from the city once or twice a week for the entire six years and eight months that he was incarcerated—to Dannemora, Harlem Valley, wherever they moved him to. She would often switch the days of the week so as to disrupt routine—a sort of surprise inspection, so that prison staff would never know for sure when she might show up. “It was the only way to make sure he stayed alive,” she says. “I had to keep Yusef alive.”\n\nIt was his mother who would call him in 2002 to tell him that the person who had actually committed the crime for which he was convicted—a serial rapist and killer named Matias Reyes—had confessed to the rape and assault of Trisha Meili. By then, Salaam was living in Stone Mountain, Georgia, trying with difficulty to put together some kind of life. Reyes had found Jesus, she told her son. Knew details only a crime’s perpetrator would know. The swabs taken from the victim that night so long ago had immediately matched Reyes’s DNA. Sharonne Salaam delivered this news, and then they both sat in stunned silence on the phone for what seemed like a long time.\n\nSpare a thought for the mother of the falsely accused.\n\nThe young man’s eyes narrow as he processes what Salaam has just said: “The spike wheels of justice ran over your family?” His eyes widen as the identity of the man he’s talking to dawns on him. Not fifty yards from where we stand there is now an entrance to Central Park called the Gate of the Exonerated, dedicated last year as a monument to the falsely accused men, and as an admonition to the unwritten future to do better than we have done. It also stands in stone as a reminder that even in a time defined by our seeming inability to acknowledge error, extend grace, apologize to each other, and correct course, lost truths can still be found and long-delayed justice is not always justice denied. The young man’s shoulders soften, the brilliant smile takes over his face, and he offers Salaam his hand but instead comes in for a hug. If Salaam has reason for hope, the young man seems to concede, how insurmountable could his grievances be?\n\nThe young man walks into the afternoon, and Salaam stands on the street in his old neighborhood, thinking of the exchange and of the challenge of persuading others to believe in a system from which they feel estranged. If anyone understands that, it is Salaam. No one in a position of power and direct responsibility for his indictment, conviction, and imprisonment has apologized or even acknowledged error. When the prosecutor who oversaw the case against the Central Park Five heard of Reyes’s confession and the conclusive evidence of his guilt, she said, “I think Reyes ran with that pack of kids. He stayed longer when the others moved on. He completed the assault. I don’t think there is a question in the minds of anyone present during the interrogation process that these five men were participants not only in the other attacks that night, but in the attack on the jogger.”\n\nThe New York police commissioner ordered a review of the investigation, and the resulting report found the department blameless, asserting despite a paucity of evidence that “it is more likely than not that the defendants participated in an attack upon the jogger.” As if “more likely than not” were an acceptable standard of criminal justice anywhere anyone would want to live.\n\nWhen asked if he regretted placing the ads in all the local papers calling for the death penalty in the wake of the attack, ads that contributed to the toxic atmosphere in New York City and potentially compromised the defendants’ ability to receive fair trials, that real estate heir, Donald Trump, who by then was president of the United States, declined to apologize, saying, “They admitted their guilt.”\n\nSpeaking about this ignominious record, Salaam is encyclopedic. The people who are vested in the false accusation are, he thinks, also the people who remain vested in the notion that it is simply inevitable that people who look like him must eventually wind up in the system. The deference to prison is still that powerful. And it is that matrix that he believes must be broken. Yusef Salaam’s time on earth puts him at the nexus of many things that have come to define American life—our never-healing racial wound, our deeply ingrained antipathy between police and communities of color, and, in the most promising instance, our response to the revanchism of the Trump-led reversion to our worst impulses—in the stubborn hope that we can be and do better by participation in public life.\n\nSalaam is surprisingly light and free of rancor. Appreciates complexity and nuance in an era not known for either. As a budding public servant, for instance, he believes in the police. “We can all be victims of crime,” he says. “Some of us are also victims of the police. That doesn’t mean all policing is bad. It means that we need better policing. I know in an intimate way the cops who get away with doing bad things by saying that they were just doing their job—they were not just doing their job.”\n\nHe doesn’t seem to relish obvious opportunities to settle scores. When asked for a reaction earlier this year after former president Trump was criminally indicted in New York City, Salaam offered a simple one-word response: “Karma.”\n\nAs he stands here on his mother’s street, he contemplates what it might mean to absolve those who resist responsibility for their actions. What does an injustice do to us? The state has the power to condemn, to absolve, to forgive on behalf of society, the people, us. But whose power is it to forgive a recalcitrant state when the state doesn’t possess the grace or wisdom to even seek forgiveness?\n\nIt is a supreme irony of our time that that power belongs to the powerless, to the wronged, to the falsely accused and imprisoned. It belongs to the victims of misused state power. It belongs to Yusef Salaam. It is the most aggrieved who must, it seems, also be the most gracious.\n\nSalaam raises his arms and opens his hands, as if releasing something into the New York sky. “I have had to learn how to forgive. It is the only way I know to repair myself. I have to forgive Donald Trump,” he says, gesturing down Fifth Avenue. “I forgive the prosecutors . . . I forgive the police . . . I forgive those who have threatened me and who told me to watch my back forever. I forgive. I forgive. I forgive.”\n\n\n\nStory: Mark Warren\n\nPhotos: Norman Jean Roy\n\nStyling: Bill Mullen\n\nProduction: Danelle Manthey at Somersault Productions\n\nProduction Design: Michael Sturgeon\n\nTailoring: Joseph Ting\n\nCreative Direction: Nick Sullivan\n\nDesign Direction: Rockwell Harwood\n\nVisuals Direction: Justin O'Neill\n\nExecutive Producer, Video: Dorenna Newton",

        "content": "As much as I abhor the cliché, the video really does look like something out of a movie—one of the Mission: Impossible sequels, maybe, or Taken 25. A young woman in a white coat is confronted on a sidewalk in Somerville, Massachusetts, right here in the U.S.A., by a group of masked individuals in dark clothing. The young woman does not put up a struggle as she is placed in restraints and shuffled off into a dark-colored SUV and gone. The whole thing takes two minutes and three seconds. A little slice of East Germany for you nostalgics out there.\n\nFrom The Boston Globe:\n\nPlainclothes officers handcuffed Rumeysa Ozturk, a 30-year-old Turkish national in the US on a student visa, and loaded her into an unmarked SUV with tinted windows as she pleaded for explanations, according to video of the arrest. She was transferred to Louisiana despite a federal judge ordering US Immigration and Customs Enforcement Tuesday night not to remove Ozturk from Massachusetts without prior notice.\n\nThe precise timing of Ozturk’s transfer to Louisiana and the issuance of the judge’s order was unclear. It was also unclear why the government targeted Ozturk, who is doctoral candidate at Tufts department of child study and human development. She had voiced support for the pro-Palestinian movement at Tufts, but was not known as a prominent leader. Her lawyer said she is not aware of any charges against her. “I don’t understand why it took the government nearly 24 hours to let me know her whereabouts,” her lawyer, Mahsa Khanbabai, said. “Why she was transferred to Louisiana despite the court’s order is beyond me. Rumeysa should immediately be brought back to Massachusetts, released, and allowed to return to complete her PhD program.”\n\nThis comes after border czar Tom Homan has made Boston a particular focus of his attention and admitted the other day that some of the 370 people arrested by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents during a six-day operation were not criminals but “collaterals.”\n\nThe proximate cause of Ozturk’s being disappeared off a public street and off to Louisiana is that she took a side in a foreign conflict to which the United States isn’t even directly a party. Even if it were, of course, there would be no excuse for snatching people off the street and shipping them off to detention without even a wave at due process, in defiance of the constitutional guarantee of habeas corpus and contrary to an order from a federal court.\n\nYes, there are similar precedents in American history going all the way back to the passage of the Alien Enemies Act, the 18th-century law that so appeals to the president’s medieval lizard brain. And yes, more recently, there has been the long, slow slide toward authoritarianism, most notably during the Cointelpro days in the 1960s and, especially, in the aftermath of the attacks of 9/11, which saw wars of choice, a concentration camp in Cuba, extraordinary rendition, black sites all over the globe, and a torture regime that attempted to camouflage barbarism with euphemism. And even with a change of administrations, there were drone strikes until hell wouldn’t have them, rubble bouncing and gratuitous death. And, of course, back home, a bipartisan consensus against true accountability, exercised through direct stonewalling and, more delicately, through “looking forward, not back,” and the Constitution be damned.\n\nAll that being said, this video is different by an order of magnitude. This is an illegitimate act of political kidnapping, straight out of the Pinochet–Videla–Ríos Montt playbook. And it is no longer an isolated incident. ICE put the bag on another grad student, this one at the University of Alabama. From The Guardian:\n\nA spokesperson for the state’s flagship university said in a brief statement that a student was arrested “off campus” by federal immigration officials, but declined to comment further, citing privacy laws. The US government’s justification for detaining the student was not immediately clear, and US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) did not respond to a request for comment late on Wednesday. News of the arrest comes amid reports of the Trump administration increasingly targeting college students for arrest and deportation across the country, including people in the US on visas and permanent residents with green cards, raising alarms on campuses and in surrounding communities.\n\nThis is about rescinding valid immigration status for the purposes of being Bibi Netanyahu’s international goon squad, squashing dissent against his government by illegitimately using the power of our own. There was a time in my life that this would leave me in an ungovernable rage. Now I’m hardly surprised.",

        "content": "At the First Baptist Church of Phenix City, Alabama, the last Sunday of October 2023 was Pastor Appreciation Day. The church was festive, the service well attended. There was strawberry cake, Pastor Copeland’s favorite, and special music in his honor by two of his closest friends, who sang a program of Baptist hymns, accompanying themselves on piano. Bernard Vann, the church’s elder statesman, spoke from the pulpit on behalf of the congregation, testifying as to how blessed they all felt that Bubba Copeland had entered their lives and bestowed his gifts, bound them together as a spiritual community. After reading a very long list of duties that make up a churchman’s life, Vann ribbed Bubba that he sure was getting a lot of attention that day for a job that’s just “one day a week.” Then he turned to Bubba and said, “We as a church love you, and we appreciate you for everything you’ve done,” with the true feeling of an old man, as he embraced his pastor.\n\nOnce Vann took his seat, Bubba stepped up to the pulpit. “I am so undeserving,” he said. “I don’t come from a background of being a pastor. I come from a background of loving people. And I believe there’s a giant difference between being a Christian and being Christlike. I try my best to be Christlike. There’s a lot of Christians that hurt people. What we should strive to do is go out of our way to love people unconditionally, despite who they are, what they are—because you know why? Jesus loves me.”\n\nBubba would often talk about how his life had been suffused with a grace that was beyond his comprehension. He believed that was the essence of God, and today he was telling his congregation that if God could love him—of all people—it was a sure sign that God loved everyone created in His image.\n\nThat last Sunday of October 2023 would be the last Sunday of Bubba Copeland’s life.\n\nBY ANDREW HETHERINGTON Copeland was forty-nine and the mayor of his hometown. In his corner of the world, he was needed, and he loved being needed.\n\nWe all have things that we don’t want other people to know about us. Things that might be hard to explain, even to ourselves. The world can be an unforgiving place, quick to judge, and friendships can be fleeting. Would the people whose regard means the most to us look at us differently if they learned of our hidden selves? Would they abandon us? Surely God knows our secrets. What does He think of us?\n\nThis is a story about just that—what God thinks. It’s also a story of identity and exposure, of revenge and public humiliation. Of deep love and senseless loss, and the unending grief of a small town.\n\nAnd secrets. It is a story about secrets.\n\nBubba Copeland had many secrets. And as a servant to both God and man, the judgments of heaven and earth were the alpha and omega of Bubba’s existence. What God thinks of anything, much less any of us, is difficult to discern, if we are honest. But the people of the First Baptist Church of Phenix City, Alabama, unabashedly adored Bubba.\n\nHe was empathetic and industrious and always seemed to be doing something for somebody. By last fall, he had been the senior pastor at First Baptist for four years and the church’s youth minister for fifteen years before that. Bubba was not seminary trained and was not what you might call an intellectual from the pulpit, but what he lacked in academic theology he made up for in his eagerness to answer to the spiritual and material needs of others, no matter the time or expense. According to the people in his church family who knew him best and loved him most, Bubba possessed an enormous capacity to serve, and his sermons were personal, compassionate, and often funny. As a Christian and as a pastor, he thought that in a pinch the Sermon on the Mount was just about all the Bible a man would ever need, and his favorite verse was Matthew 7:1—“Judge not, that ye be not judged.” All he knew about the ministry he had learned by the side of his first father-in-law, Dr. Eugene Langner, who pastored to the souls of the congregation at First Baptist Church for thirty years until his death in 2013. Even after Bubba and Merrigail, Langner’s daughter, got divorced, the two men maintained a loving friendship. Bubba and Merrigail had given Langner a grandson, after all. Young Carter Copeland would grow up underfoot at the church, singing hymns from the pulpit with a poise that would make his father cry. Grandfather, father, and son remained exceptionally close, their relationships unburdened by the strain that often comes with divorce.\n\nBy the last Sunday of October 2023, not only were Bubba and his second wife, Angela, and his two stepdaughters the first family of First Baptist Church, but the Copelands were also the first family of nearby Smiths Station, Bubba’s hometown, where he was finishing his second term as mayor. He was renowned for bringing a Love’s truck stop to the main highway through town, a feat of economic development that most mayors of towns the size of Smiths Station (population: 5,470) can only dream of—to hear the awe with which the people there talk about that truck stop, you’d think Bubba had brought IBM to town. When a tornado struck Smiths Station in 2019, killing twenty-three East Alabamians in the neighboring community of Beauregard, he was a twenty-four-hour one-man rescue crew—removing debris, providing supplies and reliable information to his people, and offering hugs when nothing else would do. That same year, when a high school senior in Smiths Station named Lexi Webb took her own life, Bubba initiated #SSNotOneMore, a suicide-prevention campaign. On the night before school started, without telling anyone they were doing it, Bubba and a group of volunteers scattered hundreds of signs all over town: YOU ARE WORTHY OF LOVE. YOUR MISTAKES DO NOT DEFINE YOU. YOU MATTER. DON’T GIVE UP. He had Post-it notes printed with the same affirmations and had volunteers pass them out at all the schools.\n\nIn his spare time, Bubba also owned and operated the Country Market over in Salem, where he had a reputation for employing local folks who might have trouble finding work elsewhere. His social-media feed was always full of cheerful posts about the latest specials on pork butts and paper towels. Life was good, if maybe a bit hectic.\n\nIn his corner of the world, Bubba Copeland was needed, and he loved being needed.\n\nDavid White, a retired doctor and chairman of the First Baptist Church board of trustees, was always urging Bubba to take a break, get out of town with Angela and the girls on vacation, disconnect for a while. “My only concern for Bubba was that he was spread too thin,” White says. “But his idea of a vacation was thinking up new outreach programs for the church.”\n\nThe Reverend Ralph Wooten, who for several years was pastor of the First United Methodist Church in Phenix City, says he first saw Bubba “emerging from a cloud of barbecue smoke” at the First Baptist annual cookout, and the two men became dear friends. “Bubba was a father of a blended family. He was a husband. He was a pastor. He was a successful small-business owner. And he was the mayor of a town that he loved,” says Wooten. “Any one of those things is enough for one human being, and yet he was all of those things. I knew it was a lot and encouraged him to take care of himself. He seemed to be taking it all in stride.”\n\nAndrew Hetherington Carter Copeland, Bubba’s son, is a student at Auburn and was asleep when the story about his father broke. He awoke to a text from his best friend: “I’m so sorry. I don’t know what to say.”\n\nDaniel Windsor, a dentist in Phenix City and a longtime member of Bubba’s church, says that Bubba was a “five-finger friend”—that is, he was one of a small group of cherished people in Windsor’s life so vital that you can count them on one hand. “He was an indispensable friend—and I loved him dearly,” Windsor says.\n\nJay Jones, the sheriff of Lee County, Alabama, says that “Bubba was hard not to like. He was that selfless and that reliable, the sort of person who rushes toward need, no questions asked. There aren’t that many people like Bubba in this world.”\n\nThe sign on the lawn in front of Bubba’s church read ALL ARE WELCOME. And all were welcome. For Bubba, that was how God worked in people. You might call it the essence of the Copeland theology. “Ain’t God good?” he would say to friends and strangers alike. And with Bubba, you were never a stranger for long.\n\nDan Elkins became a member of First Baptist Church in 2018. He was himself a Baptist minister and for ten years had successfully tended his own flock in an “itty-bitty” town in southern Alabama. Married with two kids, Elkins had tried to make his marriage work even though he had known for years that he was gay. After he and his wife divorced in 2003, he resettled in Phenix City, where he would meet his husband, Jason Price. Their first date was at the Home Depot. “In case it didn’t work out, you always need something at Home Depot, right?” Price says with a laugh.\n\nBoth Elkins and Price have a deep faith and struggled to find a church that would be a true spiritual home for them, where they would be welcomed as full-fledged members, not “as lesser than.” “There’s churches that will cash our checks and let me and my husband sit in the back pew, but we didn’t want that. We feel that we have a lot to give and love being involved in a vibrant community,” Elkins says. They had heard good things about First Baptist in Phenix City, but Price had serious reservations about committing to a Baptist church. “I thought, I ain’t going to no Southern Baptist church,” he says. “Been there, done that.”\n\nElkins first wanted to talk to the pastor, have a frank conversation, and manage everyone’s expectations from the start. Elkins called the mayor’s office in Smiths Station, and Bubba said to come on by. “We sat there across from each other, and I told him that Jason and I wanted to be members of a church where we would be treated with dignity and respect and welcomed without reservation.” Instantly, Bubba responded, “Dan, you are my brother. God has blessed our church by sending you to join us.” Bubba added that his son was gay and that he was “not sure how to relate to him. God has brought you into my life to be Carter’s gay stepdad.”\n\n“So we joined First Baptist and never looked back,” Elkins says. “It’s hard for me to express the depth of my gratitude for what Bubba gave us.”\n\nIt’s not that Bubba’s friends idealized him or thought he was perfect—they didn’t, and he wasn’t. For one, he had to keep a laminate of the Lord’s Prayer in a right-hand corner of the pulpit at First Baptist, as he sometimes forgot the words. A bigger problem for Bubba was that he worried too much about what people thought of him. And he spent way too much time looking at his phone. These days, of course, there is a direct correlation between those two things. Bubba felt an unending sense of responsibility to the people of his church family and to the people of Smiths Station. An unkind comment on Facebook could keep him up at night. If this is a common modern affliction, Bubba had an acute case.\n\nIt would be his undoing.\n\nAt the end of the Pastor Appreciation Day service, Bubba joined Dan Elkins and Daniel Windsor at the piano on the altar to sing a favorite song. The Lord did not bless Bubba with much of a singing voice, but what he lacked in talent he made up for in effort. The song was “Sweet Beulah Land,” and the second verse goes like this:\n\nI’m looking now, just across the river\n\nTo where my faith shall end in sight\n\nThere’s just a few more days to labor\n\nThen I will take my heavenly flight\n\nThree days later, on the morning of Wednesday, November 1, an online news site called 1819 News, which states as its mission the promotion of “Alabama values,” published a story about Bubba Copeland and all his secrets. Titled “The secret life of Smiths Station Mayor and Baptist pastor F. L. ‘Bubba’ Copeland as a ‘transgender curvy girl,’ ” the story was about Bubba’s hidden online life and featured pictures of him in makeup and a blond wig, wearing women’s underwear and clothes. He had posted the pictures to Reddit subgroups, including one called TransLater, where they would collect comments such as “Sister you look beautiful. Cute outfit,” and Bubba would reply, “Thank you doll!”\n\nAndrew Hetherington Dan Elkins and David White at White’s dinner table, where a somber group gathered the morning after Bubba’s death to plan the future of First Baptist Church.\n\nWhen the 1819 News correspondent, Craig Monger, had called for comment, Bubba had begged him not to publish the story, fearing that news of his private life exploding into public view would embarrass his family, his town, and his church. Dressing up was something he and his wife had done on a lark, he told Monger. He then went further, saying that cross-­dressing was something he had done on occasion since he was a young man, a hobby to relieve stress. “I have a lot of stress,” he told Monger. “I’m not medically transitioning. It’s just a bit of a character I’m playing.”\n\n“The more I talked to them, the more turned around it got,” Bubba would tell a friend.\n\nWhen the story hit the next morning, Bubba’s son Carter, a junior at Auburn, was still asleep. He woke up to a text from his best friend that read, “I’m so sorry. I don’t know what to say. I don’t know what to do.”\n\n“I had no idea what she was talking about,” Carter says. “I called her, and she told me what had happened. Immediately, I looked up my dad’s name online and saw it everywhere. It was early in the morning, and every news outlet I’d never heard of had already jumped on it, like piranhas. I watched the whole world tear him down almost instantaneously.”\n\nCarter and his father were extremely close. Over the years, each had confided in the other about their innermost struggles—in high school, Carter had come out to his father, and Bubba had shared his secrets with his son. Carter was shocked at the meanness of the story and was overcome with a visceral fear that he had never known before. In a panic, he called his dad.\n\n“He picked up and said, ‘Good morning, buddy.’ And I said, ‘What are you talking about, Good morning?!’ Trying to calm me down, he again slowly said, ‘Good morning, buddy.’ And I said, ‘Okay, good morning.’ And then I said, ‘Dad, we have to talk.’ And he said, ‘No, we don’t. I need to get into a meeting. I have people I need to take care of. We’ll talk later.’ ”\n\nAfraid, and not knowing what else to do, Carter wrote to the story’s author, whose email address was posted on the 1819 News website. He received no response. The next day, Thursday, November 2, he wrote to him again:\n\n\n\nMr. Monger,\n\n. . . I am Bubba Copeland’s son. What you have done is not by any means journalism. You have hurt the man who has been here for me my entire life. My father is my hero, always has been, and always will be. I have seen some awful things in this world and experienced a great deal of hatred myself as a gay man. You have fueled a fire of hatred and bigotry unlike any other I have ever seen in my life. I have over the last 24 hours watched my father completely break down. I truly wish I could express to you the emotions and the feelings I feel towards you and your colleagues, but I am unable at this time. My only wish now is that you are able to carry on with your life and have the peace which you have so heartlessly taken from countless lives by writing this article. . . . If you find time in your day to step aside from your [duties] I would greatly appreciate a call. More than anything else I would like to tell you the kind of person my father really is. You should truly be ashamed of yourself.\n\nBy that day, Bubba’s family, his church family, and several of his closest friends in Smiths Station had become concerned that he might harm himself. The 1819 News story was all anybody was talking about. And another story—more lurid, more humiliating, harder to explain—was on the way and would reveal the last of Bubba’s secrets to the entire world. He was in disbelief at the coverage, and the brutal anonymity of the hate pouring onto the First Baptist website and Facebook feed beggared belief.\n\nHypocrite!\n\nHAHA faggot.\n\nYou should kill yourself.\n\n\n\nJason Price and Dan Elkins were the administrators for the church accounts. Along with another volunteer from the church, they would stay up all night taking down the comments so that Bubba wouldn’t see them. But Bubba couldn’t sleep and was fixated on the velocity and reach of the Internet and its lacerating judgments. As the calendar turned from Thursday to Friday, the community of people who knew him best and loved him most—the people you have just met, and many more besides—desperately tried to form a bulwark between him and the ugliness of the world.\n\nBubba, hold your head high. You are so loved and have so much support.\n\nBubba, you are going to get through this—we are going to get through this, together.\n\nBubba, just hold on, brother—get out of town for a few days, this will blow over.\n\nBubba responded: These are dark days.\n\nSensing his growing despair, his friends and family began sending more urgent messages:\n\nBubba, where are the guns?\n\nBubba, we can’t do this without you. How are we going to live our lives without you?\n\nWhen the world comes at you, though, it comes at you.\n\nThe story had gone global, and Bubba couldn’t look away from his phone. Have you seen the New York Daily News? he would ask friends, obsessing over the latest headline.\n\nThis article appeared in the April/May 2024 issue of Esquire\n\nsubscribe\n\nElizabeth White, a WRBL News 3 crime reporter based in Auburn, Alabama, who reported on Bubba in his capacity as mayor of Smiths Station, says that “Bubba was down, and they just kept kicking and kicking and kicking. It wasn’t enough for them to just expose him. They wanted to hurt him. It’s devastating to know that for all the good he did, he spent his last days and moments in unbearable anguish.”\n\nOn the afternoon of Friday, November 3, feeling all but destroyed, Bubba Copeland finished the job and killed himself.\n\nThe Lee County coroner, Daniel Sexton, would write in his report that the cause of death was a .38 slug to the right side of Bubba’s head, just above the ear. But no clinical description of what a handgun can do to flesh and bone will ever capture the true cause of Bubba Copeland’s death.\n\nThe next morning, Bubba’s son again wrote to Craig Monger:\n\nI hope if you ever have children, they never have to face what I am now going through. I hope that they never have to find out that their father caused another man’s death by his own hand. You and your colleagues took my father from me. . . . I hope the Lord’s judgment for you is swift and deliberate.\n\nCarter Copeland is still waiting for a reply.\n\n\n\nWhen a stranger comes to a small town asking painful questions of a grieving community, the third degree is not only understandable, it’s to be expected.\n\n\n\n“You like coffee?” David White asks me. “Well, if you’re in Phenix City anyway, then I guess you should come by so we can look each other in the eye and size each other up.”\n\nThe doctor and his wife, Lori, live across the street from First Baptist Church. He is quick to point out that on Easter Sunday in 1865, Union general James H. Wilson began one of the last battles of the Civil War from his yard, staging his attack on Confederate fortifications across the Chattahoochee River in Columbus, Georgia, before going on to capture Jefferson Davis, the president of the Confederacy. White is bemused at his proximity to this history. In fact, he seems to wear a bemused expression as his face’s default setting. The staging area used by Wilson’s Raiders is now used to stage White’s beehives; his family’s annual “canning kitchen,” in which they put up thousands of jars of fruit preserves and jellies and pickles to give away to friends and strangers far and wide at Christmas; his own small vineyard, where he cultivates grapes for a wine that’s “best served in Dixie cups”; and the pits for the church barbecue on the last Saturday in April, where they’ll smoke two thousand pounds of pork.\n\nCourtesy of family Bubba would describe his cross-dressing as “a hobby I do to relieve stress.”\n\nWhite is from Phenix City, fifth generation, and grew up in this house, which was built in 1906. During the Spanish flu epidemic of 1918, as there were no hospitals, the house was made into a flu infirmary, with the sick and dying in the front and concerned family members coming and going from the back, the two halves separated by a heavy curtain that no one was allowed to cross except for the nurse. The doctor would come once a day to leave morphine and aspirin, pronounce the dead, and figure out where to put the new arrivals. “There’s a Black community a quarter mile that way,” White says. “We all grew up together. That’s the way it was. And in those days, nobody had anything, so there was no economic distinction between neighbors. It wasn’t perfect, it wasn’t good, but it was a lot of people striving together to get by. It wasn’t all Ku Klux Klan.”\n\nPer the census, Phenix City has a population of thirty-eight thousand, spread out along the Chattahoochee River, straddling Lee and Russell counties. But it has the feeling of a smaller town, essentially a modest suburb of Columbus, Georgia, directly across the river. Roughly half Black and half white, the diverse population is reflected in First Baptist’s congregation.\n\nWhite’s father was born in this house in 1917 and was a newborn when both of his parents became gravely ill with the flu. The nurse was caring for White’s grandparents, who were laid out in the front of the house, and the baby was quarantined on the back porch. The need was so great, and the nurse was doing the best she could, but at one stretch she forgot about the newborn and went forty hours straight without crossing the curtain. When she realized what she’d done, she just knew that the baby was dead. She rushed through the curtain to the rear of the house only to find a six-year-old Black boy named Roy Pierson—who had sick family in the front of the house, too, and had himself been lost in the shuffle—caring for the baby, who was quite alive. “Roy was not big enough to pick him up. So he would sleep under the cradle and rock him, and he did his best to keep him clean, but he couldn’t figure out how to feed him. So he would get food and he would chew it up, and he would take it from his mouth and put it into my father’s mouth,” White says. “So when I came along in the South in the early sixties, my Uncle Roy was a Black man. He was my father’s brother, as much of a brother as my father would ever have, and they could not have been any closer had they been related by blood. That’s kind of the weave of the history here.”\n\nHe is wearing that bemused expression, but just the night before, White had been on the phone for half an hour, sternly interrogating me about why I had come to Phenix City. “We are hurting, our friend is gone, and we don’t need more salaciousness and scandal,” he said. “The press—so-called—did this to Bubba. Why would we talk to the press? People are concerned.”\n\nHe pours the coffee and says, “The people you are here to meet are still in shock at what happened and feel a profound sense of failure at not being able to save our friend. But if we are talking to you, it’s because we don’t want 1819 News to be the last word on Bubba Copeland.”\n\nThe people who exposed Bubba’s secrets said they presumed several things about him, chiefly that he was a hypocrite, preaching hate publicly for the life that he led privately. Bryan Dawson, the founder of 1819 News, would say publicly the week after Bubba’s suicide that Copeland was “pretending to be one thing—uber-conservative, Baptist, Trump, Christian, all of that”—while living a life that made a lie of those claims. Maybe Dawson was making broad assumptions about what it means to be a Baptist preacher in Alabama, but if he and his editorial team had known more about Bubba Copeland, they would have known that that assertion was far from accurate. Dawson would also admit that not only had he never heard of Bubba Copeland before receiving “a tip” about his online life, he had also never heard of Smiths Station.\n\nThe story of the Internet is of tribes hurling rocks over the horizon at targets they cannot see, doing damage that they do not care to measure. In this case, those assumptions and that ignorance would make Bubba less a human being than an ideological target in a raging culture war, and the damage radiating through these towns is now plain for all with eyes to see. And it’s not just these towns. Coinciding with the breakdown of our social order and abetted by technology of astonishing power, we find ourselves in a conflict over rapidly changing conceptions of gender and sexual difference. In the backlash to this upheaval, the casualties are mounting.\n\nTo learn about Bubba, who he actually was and what he cared about, it’s important to meet his church family, and the best place to do that is here, at David White’s dinner table. Here is where so many people have broken bread and laughed and carried on. Here is also where the trustees and deacons held an emergency meeting the Saturday morning after Bubba died to figure out if and how the church would continue. Lori White made biscuits and coffee, and a somber group sat around this table to plan the next day’s service, which is about all they had in them to do. One service at a time. Get through Sunday, then give some thought to the funeral.\n\nIt was decided White would lead the service the next day. He is an easy public speaker with a deep familiarity with scripture, and it was not unusual for him to offer a sermon. Bubba was eager to share his pulpit with speakers he saw as more talented than himself, and White had already been scheduled to do the talk that Sunday. But his sermon would need to be very different now. From there, he and Dan Elkins would share pastoral duties, and other area clergy—even including a Methodist pastor named Laura Eason—would be invited in to help keep the church going.\n\nBY ANDREW HETHERINGTON The evening of November 1, after the 1819 News story had broken, Bubba led his last Bible study at First Baptist. He chose a fateful passage to teach: Psalm 23:1-6, which had him walking through the valley of the shadow of death.\n\nTo keep going is the point of a church. Just as White and his family are fed at this table, so too are they fed at the church across the way. The need for spiritual sustenance doesn’t explain why we believe what we believe, but the two are intimately related, as with common purpose comes community. Coming together in awe and doubt in the face of eternity might be the last human feeling that AI can’t take from us. If a religion splits over a breach in heavenly doctrine or earthly politics or a combination of the two—as the Baptist church did in 1845, cleaved down the middle due to the belief held by what would become Southern Baptists that slavery was an “institution of heaven”—then the community splits, too, profoundly and perhaps irrevocably. The Southern Baptists are no longer confined to the South and now have churches in forty-one states, which makes them the largest Protestant denomination in the United States. In 1995, church leaders apologized for the faith’s racist origins and at the same time repented for the church’s opposition to the civil-rights movement and interracial marriage.\n\nThere have been other fault lines more recently, involving the enduring Old Testament penchant of more-conservative Christians to take it upon themselves to cast people into hell, as well as contemporary social issues—whether women can preside over services (an emphatic no in Southern Baptist churches) and whether God loves gay people (the Southern Baptist position might best be described as “hate the sin, love the sinner”).\n\nWhat they all seem to agree on is that the Bible is a well-worn daily instruction manual and not some ancient relic. It is important to White that I understand the First Baptist ethos and the mark that Bubba left on the church in Phenix City.\n\n“Our philosophy is this: We open those doors,” he says. “You can read your whole Bible, and nowhere in it does the Bible give you permission to judge your fellow man. But time after time after time, it tells you to love your fellow man. No matter what. That was Bubba’s attitude. It’s the attitude our church shares.”\n\nIt seems an uncontroversial point and a handy distillation of the foremost of the Christian commandments, familiar to anyone with a passing knowledge of the New Testament. All of the gospels enunciate a version of this basic tenet of Christianity, and the Gospel of Mark makes clear that there is “no commandment greater” than to love God and to “love your neighbor as yourself.”\n\n“It’s not that complicated,” says White, “although because we are human, we keep pretending not to understand how this is supposed to work. We keep pretending that God intended for us to rough each other up using his Word. Buddy, there but for the grace of God go I. Maybe we don’t cross-dress and that kind of stuff, but we all have our faults, and none of us deserve the harsh judgment of other flawed humans. First and foremost, Bubba Copeland was my friend. I don’t fully understand what was going on with him, in his life and in his home, but I also don’t know that I’m supposed to. I don’t think it’s my business.”\n\nThe evening of November 1, after the 1819 News story had broken, Bubba led his last Bible study at First Baptist. He chose a fateful passage to teach: Psalm 23:1–6, which had him walking through the valley of the shadow of death. After the session, he walked into a very tense meeting of the church’s board of trustees that began in anger and ended two hours later in tears and hugs. The trustees, led by White, had, like everyone else, been blindsided by the story and just wanted to know one thing: Bubba, is it true?\n\nHe maketh me to lie down in green pastures . . .\n\nYes, the pictures were real, he told them. They were private and never meant to be public. It was dumb to post them on the Internet. He was abjectly sorry for the embarrassment he would cause, adding that he would never purposely do anything to hurt the church or his friends.\n\nHe restoreth my soul . . .\n\n“We did not suspend him. We did not reprimand him. We did not fire him,” White says. “We talked to him frankly. We expressed our shock and disappointment, and then we replaced that with our concern and our love and our support for our brother, who was suffering. The church would be fine. Now it was Bubba we were worried about.”\n\nI will fear no evil, for thou art with me . . .\n\nThe next morning, one of the trustees from First Baptist who had been in the meeting the night before received a call from a man from the Russell County Baptist Association. The caller wanted to know what First Baptist planned to do to punish its pastor and why it hadn’t done so already.\n\nThou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies . . .\n\nThe First Baptist trustee told the caller from the Baptist Association that as First Baptist had not been aligned with the Southern Baptist Convention for decades, the situation with Bubba Copeland was none of the association’s business.\n\nThou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over . . .\n\nThe trustee added that just as the New Testament instructs in the books of Matthew, Luke, and Galatians, when a brother goes astray, as Paul wrote in his letter to the early Christians of Galatia, “you who are spiritual should restore him in a spirit of gentleness.”\n\nSurely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life, and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever.\n\nMatthew emphasizes that this counseling should be done privately; Luke, the importance of forgiveness after repentance. And that, the trustee told the caller, was how First Baptist planned to address the situation with its brother Bubba Copeland. Thank you for calling.\n\nAndrew Hetherington Phenix City is roughly half Black and half white, and the town’s diversity is reflected in the First Baptist congregation. “Our philosophy is this: We open those doors,” says David White. “You can read your whole Bible, and nowhere in it does the Bible give you permission to judge your fellow man.”\n\n“We haven’t been Southern Baptist for twenty years,” White says. “And you’re probably not going to find another Baptist church in a small town anywhere that has gay couples that come to church every Sunday. Of course, you have to be sensitive, because we have members that are old-school, in their eighties and nineties, and they might not be ready for all of that, but they’re accepting. After Gene Langner died, we started looking for a pastor. I was on the search committee that brought the next pastor here, and we had people in church that were gay. It was generally known but not discussed. And the older members, some of them—the staunchest, most Republican, redneck guys, I mean—I grew up around them and I watched God change them, but they’re still very conservative. And more than one of them came up to me and said, You’re looking for a pastor, but, you know, so-and-so sits over there in the third row. They’re kind of different. Don’t you bring anybody here that’ll hurt them or turn them away.”\n\nThe Southern Baptist Convention still regards sexual difference as an abomination against God, and even homosexual desire not acted on is “always sinful, impure, degrading, shameful, unnatural, indecent and perverted,” according to the denomination’s “Resolution on Homosexual Marriage.” As a remedy for impure thoughts, the SBC endorses sexual reorientation.\n\nWhen Dan Elkins had his country church in southern Alabama and was struggling to reconcile his ministry with his sexuality, he came out to his then wife. That was 1996, and it would be seven years before they would divorce. “We did counseling, and I was told, You can beat this with prayer and fasting, and I prayed, and I fasted, for years—ever the good little Baptist boy—but I was earnestly trying to change something that simply can’t be changed,” Elkins says. “I had come out to a confidant at church, and that person betrayed my trust and it got out in the community, but I didn’t know it. We showed up for church one Wednesday night and the parking lot was full, and I’m like, Something’s going on. This was January 2002. Oh my word. If Facebook had been around then, I’m not sure I’d be here. I’m not sure that I would have seen the way out. Like Bubba couldn’t see the way out.”\n\nIn this pocket of East Alabama, though, the church doors are open, and the Bibles say that God loves everybody. “That’s how this church has evolved,” says White. “We have members who are gay and married and accepted, and that’s relatively new. And we have older members who are accepting even if they don’t understand. It’s been a long trip for them. You cannot fail to recognize how far they’ve come.\n\n“And that’s Bubba’s legacy,” White adds. “I can tell you that his legacy is not defined by that week. His legacy is defined by the friends he leaves, by the people that he led to the Lord, by the life and values he lived. That’s his legacy. Not 1819 News. 1819 News is to journalism what a quack is to the practice of medicine.”\n\nBryan Dawson believes in redemption narratives. Especially his own. The founder of 1819 News (so named because 1819 is the year Alabama became a state) has a compelling personal story that he has honed into a performance piece on various podcasts and pulpits across Alabama for the past several years, although he is not from the state or even the South.\n\nBY ANDREW HETHERINGTON When a high school student in Smiths Station took her own life, Bubba started a suicide-prevention campaign, putting up affirmations all over town.\n\nAs a young man, Dawson lived in Colorado Springs, and it’s there that his life of crime gave him the material for his story. He trafficked in weed, cocaine, and meth; was the kingpin of a “motorcycle, automobile theft ring”; and in spring 2007 beat a “snitch” over the head with a chain with a padlock at the end of it, for which he would be charged with attempted murder, among other felonies. (He would eventually plead to reduced charges and receive a sentence of sixteen years in prison.) These experiences have been memorialized numerous times in the press, in stories such as “From Breaking Bad to Redemption: The Story of Bryan Dawson” in Newsweek and in an interview on his own website titled “From Tragedy to Triumph, the CEO of 1819 News Shares His Story.”\n\nIn his story, he tells of a sad and lonely young man with no self-esteem raised in a broken home, who is always put in the “friend zone” by young women and who only ever feels comfortable as himself when he is high or drunk. And then he becomes a violent criminal, faces hundreds of years in prison, is extended grace and kindness over and over again by strangers and the state, finds God, and is ultimately salvaged by a community that forgives him seventy times seven (Matthew 18:21–22). In the details and framing of his story, Dawson is pleading for understanding, and his adoring interviewers give it to him; one even adds at the end, “I think if you had been born way back, you would be in the Bible.”\n\nYes, you might say that Dawson’s Colorado Springs redemption epic is like Saul on the road to Damascus, if Saul had attempted to murder a man with a padlock on a chain, causing “permanent disfigurement,” according to the attending physician in a police report, who added that “the victim was lucky to be alive.”\n\nSaul of course repents, calls himself the “foremost of sinners,” and becomes Paul, the greatest writer of the New Testament. In his redemption narrative, Dawson also becomes a different person, but when he tells his story this new person doesn’t mention the man he tried to kill, doesn’t indicate how he feels about him or whether he ever thinks about how he might be getting on with his permanent disfigurement. Instead, in his redemption story, Dawson occasionally shines a little light on his supporting cast—his wife, his mother—but mostly he finds satisfaction in the power of his own narrative. His interviewers feel the same way, and they interrupt him to say things like It’s just like in the movies!\n\nSARA PALCZEWSKI/OPELIKA-AUBURN NEWS/AP (COPELAND). MARK WARREN (SIGN). JULIE BENNETT/THE NEW YORK TIMES/REDUX (MEMORIAL) Left: The memorial in front of the church in the days after Bubba killed himself. Right: One of the signs with affirmations that Bubba put up around Smiths Station after a local high school student took her own life.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhich brings us to his fresh start in Alabama, where he grew an apostolic beard, started to allow the slightest bit of a twang in now and then, joined a Baptist church in Wetumpka where he sometimes preached from the Old Testament and where just ten days before his life intersected with Bubba Copeland’s he delivered a sermon that revealed him to be an aspiring theocrat. Preaching from Deuteronomy and Samuel, he refers to “God’s government”; is entranced by the “rod of correction,” the “power of the sword,” and offenses against God that are “punishable by death”; warns of the consequences that will come when a church “neglects to use the sword properly”; and says things like “We’ve done a great job of rooting out the rubbish and the refuse of the Philistines in our church. We’ve done a phenomenal job” and “Right now in the state the fear of God is not before their eyes, so they just do whatever they want.”\n\nAppearing on a podcast this past January about the “Dangers of Progres­sive Christianity,” Dawson said that “progressive Christianity comes from feminism creeping into the church” and that the one true faith had fallen victim to “soccer moms” and their tendency to be more welcoming and less judgmental. In the same broadcast, he trained particular fire on a prominent evangelical minister who had sparked controversy by advocating that churches be more supportive of the LGBTQ+ community. For this, Dawson called the minister an “apostate” and a “full-blown heretic” and then went on to improvise that the man was gay and was cheating on his wife, and to finish the point he said, “I wish there were Old Testament lightning strikes that happen to people when they blaspheme the Lord the way that he does.”\n\nThe Lord did not bless Bryan Dawson with a talent for public speaking, but what he lacks in fire he makes up for in brimstone. His Christianity seems somewhat unfamiliar with its namesake. In that, he is a familiar figure, older than time, and not only among Christians—a religious enforcer who knows just enough of a holy book to be dangerous. You might say that he put down his padlock, picked up his Bible, and didn’t skip a beat.\n\nDawson then merged his brutal version of the Christian faith with the often brutal politics of Alabama on the always brutal platform of the Internet and in late 2021 founded 1819 News to counter the most prominent news site in Alabama, AL.com, which is, he says, “communist propaganda.”\n\nThese details of Dawson’s story are important, because in the moral calculus of 1819 News, Bryan Dawson is allowed a redemption narrative sanitized of victims, but Bubba Copeland is not. Perhaps that is because Dawson’s violent felonies were manly crimes, just like in the movies, whereas Bubba Copeland’s transgressions were of thought and behavior that Dawson could not square with his version of the faith and would not tolerate, and rather than extend Copeland the grace that he himself had been the beneficiary of so many times, he ignored Bubba’s plea for mercy and leveled him instead. He and his editor in chief, Jeff Poor—an alum of the Daily Caller and a regular contributor to Breitbart—would make the case that it was Bubba Copeland, who did not preach violence from his pulpit, who was the dangerous one. After his death, they would assert publicly that he was a troubled man, that he had victims, that it was their duty to expose him, and that, as Poor would say, “the people at First Baptist Church, Phenix City, had a right to know what their worship leader was doing.”\n\nOn the day that Bubba Copeland took his own life, 1819 News published its second feature on his fantasy life online. This story was even more lurid than the first, detailing pieces of erotic fiction that Bubba had posted as his alter ego. Some of the fiction was gruesome—one story in particular dealt with a trans protagonist who stalked and killed a woman so that she could have a relationship with her victim’s husband. The story was titled “Dangerous Obsession”: “In my cubicle I scanned her page. She posted a new picture! Excited I screenshot it to add to my ever-growing collection. To say I was a stalker would be a bit of an understatement. Every post she made I studied it, analyzing and taking notes of her daily routine. What she ate, what she drank, from her favorite coffee to her favorite alcoholic drink. Her life had become my obsession.”\n\nIn the two days since 1819 News had posted its first story, it had been alerted that Bubba had used pictures of at least two real people from the Phenix City area in at least one of his posts—a meme about transitioning. The two were a brother and sister, and people from the community have confirmed for me that the brother was a minor when the picture that Bubba used was taken. In his second feature, correspondent Craig Monger wrote that the father of the children pictured had called 1819 News, informed the site that the pictures were of his children, and asked them to remove the images. (The photo of the boy was taken from the father’s social-media account.) In his posts, Bubba seemed to use photos from the Internet both purposefully and indiscriminately, once including an image of a teenage girl who was not from the area.\n\nBY ANDREW HETHERINGTON Lisa Deason worked with Bubba in the Smiths Station mayor’s office. She engaged in a physical strug­gle with him in a vain effort to keep him from ending his life.\n\nA local woman had contacted the site to say that Bubba had used pictures of her in some of his posts. Monger also discovered that Bubba had used the name of another local woman in “Dangerous Obsession.” I reached out to the father of the brother and sister but did not hear back, and also to both of the women. One did not reply, the other wrote back, “No need to bring all of that back up as those . . . families heal.”\n\nWhen Dawson and Poor had published their exposé on Bubba two days earlier, the 1819 News editorial team had apparently not been aware that he had used the names and images of people he knew in posting to his online community. But in the days after his death, his poor judgment would become their justification for having published the stories in the first place. 1819 News’s initial imperative—to expose a cross-dressing pastor that its editorial team had assumed to be a hypocrite—would no longer be enough.\n\nThe week after Bubba’s suicide, Dawson and Poor released a thirty-­four-minute video podcast on which they outlined all that had gone into their decision to publish their exposé. The timeline, they say, is that they received a tip about Bubba’s online life on Monday, October 30. They called him for comment. They published on Wednesday morning after deliberating for three hours the night before on whether to go through with it.\n\nIn the video, the two strike a sober pose. “It’s a tragic situation where no one wins,” says Dawson. They grant themselves absolution for doing the right thing and say that they feel besieged by criticism on social media that 1819 News had acted irresponsibly. Dawson does not allow himself to understand the reaction in anything other than ideological terms. “This story,” he says, “has shaken things up in the leftist community!”\n\nPoor wears the look of a man surprised to find himself in the middle of a matter of such consequence and bristles at the suggestion that decisions he was party to might have contributed to the death of a man. Don’t assume that Bubba Copeland killed himself because of those stories, he says. “We may never know, but don’t assume that.”\n\nAs they hash out their reasons, Dawson and Poor repeatedly refer to “Dangerous Obsession,” acknowledging that the story is fantasy while nonetheless treating it as if it were evidence of real conduct. Poor becomes exercised and shouts, “What if people don’t ever find out about this? What if it just is allowed to continue on into the future?” And then, with no apparent basis in fact for saying so, he adds this: “We don’t know what else is out there—don’t assume that there’s nothing else out there. This behavior does raise a lot of unanswered questions. . . . I think maybe a little caution here is warranted.”\n\nSix days after Bubba Copeland killed himself and his family and community had been devastated, the editor in chief of 1819 News began to urge caution while continuing to assassinate his character.\n\nNear the end of their podcast, Poor says that although he was “not celebrating the death of Bubba Copeland,” he was “at peace” with the decision to publish.\n\nIt’s easy to see that Bubba was wrong and crossed an ethical line in using the names and images of people he knew in his fiction and other posts. One can only assume that it must have been an awful experience for those two women and the father of that brother and sister to be unexpectedly swept up in this story. But in this Alabama skirmish in a hellish culture war—over gender and speech and objective reality itself—with its dehumanized politics and competing conceptions of heaven, suffused with rage and loss and bereft of much clarity, two things are clear: First, 1819 News wanted the whole world to see Bubba’s posts, without fully understanding what they contained. Before posting its stories, the editorial team there also didn’t seem to know much beyond the few facts they had discovered, things they saw as sensational and repugnant. And second, Bubba Copeland was desperate for his hidden life to remain hidden and never intended for anyone other than perhaps his wife and the other pseudonymous members of his online community to see his posts. He was shattered at the sudden collision of his private and public identities and killed himself.\n\nThe last story 1819 News published about Bubba Copeland came on November 11, eight days after his death. It was a short essay in support of the editorial decision to run the stories, and its conclusion was that Bubba had completed “his rejection of God’s laws” because he had “murdered himself.”\n\nI wrote to 1819 News four times, asking to discuss the stories it published about Bubba Copeland. I did not receive a reply.\n\n\n\nHe gave himself the nickname, as he didn’t much care for “Fred Copeland Jr.” and thought that “Bubba” sounded friendly. He was a standout linebacker for the Smiths Station high school football team, but his real passion in school had been acting in drama productions, because, as he would tell his son, “you can become someone else for a moment.”\n\nWhen he and his first wife, Merrigail, were dating, Bubba sat her down one night and said he had something to tell her. “Have you heard of transgender?” he asked her.\n\n“Bubba, I have no idea what you’re talking about,” she answered. He explained it as best he could, and then Merrigail asked, “Why are we talking about this?”\n\n“Well, I dabble in that,” he said. “There have been times that I have dressed up.”\n\nThe news threw Merrigail, but the attraction between them was so strong that she thought their relationship could withstand anything. The couple were married in 1997, and she would soon come to believe that Bubba had a compulsion that he couldn’t control. When they’d been married for a year or so, they decided to buy a dog. When the day came to pick up the dog, Bubba was working, and so Merrigail and her father, Pastor Langner, walked out to the garage to get some rope to secure a large crate. When she opened up the tool chest on Bubba’s truck, she found that it was full of women’s clothes. Merrigail turned to her father. “Dad, I don’t want to embarrass him,” she said.\n\n“I won’t,” her father said.\n\nA few years later, when she was pregnant with their son Carter, she discovered some “transgender stuff” on his computer one afternoon. When Bubba got home from work, he found Merrigail crying. He apologized profusely, saying that the stress at work was too much for him and that dressing up was an escape. “I’ll try to do better,” he told Merrigail. She knew how bad her husband’s stress was. Bubba worked with his father, who, she felt, “talked to him like he was a dog.” Fred Sr. was a hard man, a combat veteran who had returned from Vietnam and made his fortune in the grocery business in Georgia and Alabama. Bubba would often come home saying that he wanted to do something different with his life.\n\nMerrigail’s father told her, “Sweetheart, he can’t help it. This is who he is.” Langner would counsel his son-in-law with compassion, saying, “Bubba, Christ didn’t come into this world for us to be two people. You can only live one life. You need to decide which life you’re going to lead.”\n\nBY ANDREW HETHERINGTON Mechanics­ville Cemetery, where Bubba would often go to meditate when he was troubled and needed to “calm down.”\n\nIn East Alabama, though, Bubba couldn’t imagine a world where he could be himself in a way that people would accept. The marriage broke down, and when the couple divorced in 2009, Bubba was so despondent that he seriously contemplated suicide. One morning, when Carter was eight years old, he found his father sitting on the floor in the shower, sobbing. “I said, ‘Dad, are you okay? I love you,’ ” Carter remembers. “And he said, ‘I’m okay, buddy. I just need a second.’ ” There’s a nineteenth-century cemetery—Mechanicsville Cemetery, it’s called—near the grocery store Bubba owned, and he would sometimes go there to think when he was troubled. After dropping Carter off with the babysitter, Bubba went to the cemetery, intending to kill himself. He had the barrel of a handgun in his mouth when his phone rang. It was an old friend from town, who told Bubba, “Hey, buddy. The Lord put you on my heart, and I just wanted to tell you I love you.”\n\nThe call stopped Bubba. But his torment would continue.\n\nAfter the divorce, Carter lived mostly with his father and attended the Glenwood School in Smiths Station, a private Christian academy. Bubba was a devoted father, and in the years before he met Angela, his life revolved around Carter. Two things happened in the years before Bubba remarried that would define the relationship between father and son. When he was twelve, Carter came across a digital camera in his father’s closet full of pictures of Bubba dressed in women’s clothes. “This is not something that I ever wanted you to find out,” Bubba told his son.\n\n“I just need to know if you’re doing something really wrong, Dad,” Carter replied.\n\n“Absolutely not,” Bubba answered. “This has been a hobby of mine for a while. It’s my escape.”\n\nWhen Merrigail found out that her son had discovered his father’s secret, she said, “Your dad is an incredible man. Don’t let this change the way that you feel about him.” It didn’t. In fact, it gave Carter the feeling that he could talk to his father about anything.\n\nTwo years later, when Carter was a freshman in high school, he told his father that he was gay and that he was struggling with how to live honestly at school and in the world. He wanted to be free to be himself. God had made him this way. Why would he hide who he was? His father was afraid for Carter and angry that he couldn’t talk him out of coming out publicly. He knew what would happen to him, doing so at such a young age in such a small town, and the two fought bitterly. Bubba wanted him to wait until college to come out, wanted him to go far away, be happy, live his life. Carter decided instead to come out to a cherished teacher who betrayed him to a school administrator, who called Carter into his office and told him that he was going to hell. Once the news spread, Carter experienced what felt like torture. Students would spit on him in the bathroom, throw food at him in the lunchroom, and threaten to physically attack him. The teachers were of no help, as they now hated him, too. There was no safe harbor for the gay kid at the Christian school.\n\nThere is nothing like being the singular locus of a compounding hatred, in a closed system that justifies the hatred and calls it good. After school one day, Carter went home, his head full of monsters, and he swallowed a bottle of pills. And then he walked into his favorite room, the family library with its cathedral ceilings, and lay on the floor and looked up and watched the ceiling fan turn. His father found him there, saw the empty pill bottle, and dragged him to the bathroom, where he put his fingers down Carter’s throat.\n\nIt would be the first of several suicide attempts for Carter. Time after time, his father would save him. And the last time, Bubba just held Carter and told him, “God loves you, Carter. And I love you, too. Don’t listen to those people at school. There’s nothing wrong with you. The only thing wrong with you is the judgment of the world.”\n\n“And then he said this: ‘Carter, if I can survive this, you can survive this, too.’ And we made a pact with each other that day that we would live. We would make ourselves happy, we would make others happy, we would live fulfilled lives. And as long as one of us had to do it, the other had to do it, too. ‘No suicides. Promise?’ ”\n\nCarter says now that he realizes that by coming out when he did, he was trying to show his father that it’s okay, that you can be who you are. It’s all right.\n\n“I had reached a point in my life where I had begun to accept myself,” he says. “I had finally gotten to that point, and now my own father had to go through it. And the people that hated me and wanted me to be morally punished were the same people that took my dad from me.”\n\n\n\nAndrew Hetherington A memorial to Bubba, which was unveiled on March 26, 2024. Part of the Smiths Station memorial sidewalk, the marker is located in front of the Historic Jones Store Museum, a local heritage project that he had championed and that opened in 2019.\n\nIt was the afternoon of Friday, November 3, 2023. The last hour of Bubba Copeland’s life. For days, those who knew him best and loved him most had encircled him, lifting him up, trying to hold tight to keep him from slipping away. Their efforts had seemed to be working. Earlier that day, Bubba had gotten a couple new tires for one of his cars, he’d stopped by the government center in Smiths Station to pick up his new city credit card, he’d checked in at the country market. He’d also sent a long and heartfelt letter to the congregation of First Baptist, thanking them for Pastor Appreciation Day, in which he seemed to see a future. “I look forward to continuing our journey of faith, growth, and service together,” he’d written. Now he’d gone missing. In Auburn, Carter Copeland received a call from his stepmother, Angela. “Your dad just called me. And he said that he loves me and that he’s always loved me and to go to my parents’ house. And then the call dropped off, and now every time I call him, it goes straight to voicemail. I don’t know what to do, Carter. You know him better than anybody. Where is he?”\n\nBy then, the Lee County sheriff’s department had fanned out all over the county to find Bubba and make sure he was okay. It wasn’t just law enforcement, either—Bubba’s friends and family had also begun searching for him, and as Carter ran to his car to make the drive from Auburn, Lisa Deason, who had worked as Bubba’s communications director in Smiths Station, had gone looking for him, too, and was pulling up at Bubba’s house. Deason had helped him draft letters of resignation as mayor and pastor just the day before. The letter resigning from his position as pastor read, in part, “Admittedly, there have been instances where my wife and I have taken private pictures within the confines of our home, which should have never been shared online. I realize this was a significant lapse in judgment and a personal failure, for which I bear complete and absolute responsibility. . . . I apologize for any distress or humiliation my actions may have caused. Love to all, Bubba.” The letter would never be sent.\n\nLike many of his other friends, Deason had been urging Bubba to get out of town for a few days, let the Internet find somebody else to destroy, let things blow over. That morning, though, 1819 News had dropped its second feature on Bubba and, mesmerized by the coverage on his phone, he had started telling people that he didn’t know if he could go on. The night before, Dan Elkins and Jason Price had had a long talk with Bubba about his growing despair, and Elkins had asked him, “Bubba, where are your guns?” Bubba said that he had surrendered his handgun to a safety officer in Smiths Station. As several of his friends would say, though, he lives in the South and his name is Bubba—he’s got more than one gun.\n\nThe latest 1819 News piece seemed to break something in Bubba, unleashing a lethal shame, and by that afternoon his phone was as dangerous a weapon as his gun.\n\nNot finding Bubba at home, Deason stood in the driveway of his house and called 911, saying that her friend was suicidal, and at that moment, his Tahoe pulled up in front of the house on Oakhurst Drive. He got out and left the motor running. “What are you doing here?” he asked her.\n\n“I came to check on you.”\n\n“Who’s with you?”\n\n“I’m by myself.”\n\n“Do not tell Angela where I am. I mean it. Don’t you tell a soul where I am.”\n\nBubba went into the house for no more than thirty seconds, and when he came out he was walking fast and moved to get back in his truck. “I love you,” he told Deason, “but I got to go.”\n\nShe said, “No, I’m not going to let you do this, Bubba! Please don’t do this. You have way more people that love you than you can even imagine. Don’t do this. Don’t do this to your family. Please. Don’t.” Deason was sobbing now and trying to hold on to Bubba, with her arms wrapped around him. No, I’m not letting you leave. Realizing she couldn’t restrain him, she let go, ran around him, jumped into the driver’s seat, turned off the ignition, and grabbed the steering wheel. I’m not going to let you leave.\n\n“I’m going to do it in front of you if you don’t move,” he said. Bubba pulled her out of the truck, and in desperation, she was thinking, What the hell can I do? In that instant, 911 called back, and instead of the operator, it was Jeff Pitts with the sheriff’s department on the line.\n\n“What’s going on?” Pitts asked.\n\n“He’s trying to leave and he won’t listen to me! He’s adamant. He says he’s got to end it.”\n\n“Let me talk to him.”\n\n“Bubba, it’s Major Pitts, Jeff Pitts.”\n\n“Jeff, man, I love you,” Bubba said. “But I’m done. I can’t do this no more.”\n\nBubba handed the phone to Deason, got in his truck, and peeled away.\n\nAs he drove, a cousin who had joined the search pulled up behind him. Bubba told him, If these deputies make me stop, you’re going to see something that I do not want you to see.\n\nCarter was driving 100 miles per hour toward Mechanicsville Cemetery, because he knew his father might be there. He called his father’s number over and over. Nothing. And then his father called him.\n\n“I love you, buddy,” Bubba said. “I’ve lived my whole life to make sure that you are successful and that you have what you need. And I just want you to know that I love you more than anything in this world.”\n\n“I knew immediately what that meant,” Carter says. “And I just said, ‘Please, Dad, please tell me you’re not doing what I think you’re doing. Please, we can get through this.’ ”\n\n“It’s too late, son. I love you. I’m so sorry.”\n\n“I told him, ‘You have nothing to be sorry about. There’s nothing to be sorry for. I love you. You’re my hero. Always will be. This is going to be horrible. We’ll get through it.’ ”\n\n“I’m sorry. This is what I have to do. This is the only way out.”\n\nCarter remembers feeling desperate to hold on, desperate to find the words that would make his father stay, desperate. He screamed at the top of his lungs and felt a rush of emotion such that he thought his vocal cords might explode. I love you! I love you! I love you! I love you! “I screamed it as loud as I could for as long as he was on the line, because I knew he was listening. I knew. I could see he was still on the call. I kept screaming. That’s all I knew to say was, I love you! It’s okay. I love you. It’s okay!”\n\nAnd then silence.\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of Bubba’s death, along a country road in the town of Beulah, Lee County sheriff Jay Jones took possession of his electronic devices, and his office searched them for evidence of criminal conduct. They found none. “In my view, Bubba Copeland would never intentionally do anything to harm anyone,” Jones told me. “I just don’t think that he was that type of person.”\n\nDavid White would write a new sermon for the Sunday after Bubba’s death, staying up well past midnight the night before, sitting at his dinner table, writing in longhand. He would preach Psalm 23:1–6, just as Bubba had in his last service. And he wanted to make sure the world knew that the church had remained true to its pastor and always would. “Despite what may have been implied in the media,” he wrote, “members of this church have been steadfast in their love and concern for our pastor.”\n\nWe all have things that we don’t want other people to know about us. Things that might be hard to explain, even to ourselves. The First Baptist Church of Phenix City did not abandon Bubba Copeland, even after learning the secrets that he might not have been able to explain even to himself.\n\nBubba’s body would be turned away by the two Baptist cemeteries in Smiths Station, his hometown, the town that he loved. He is buried in a private family plot many miles away.\n\nAs I finished my reporting for this story, I took to asking the people in Bubba’s life what they might say to the people at 1819 News if they had the chance. Several told me that they are required to love them and will be praying for them. As Bubba Copeland always said, “God loves you, and so do we.”\n\n",

        "content": "There are other courthouses in other places. They’re not in Washington. They’re the repair shops of the law. They hammer out the dents that result from the collisions of ordinary people living ordinary lives. And they’re where the law comes closest to Atticus Finch’s optimism. They’re where the leveling happens. —Something I Wrote Once\n\n\n\nLong ago, I learned a valuable lesson about verdicts in criminal cases. The lesson conforms to the late William Goldman’s classic assessment of Hollywood: Nobody Knows Anything. This is especially true in that tremulous time between when the case goes to the jury and when the jury comes back with a verdict. Once, while covering a political-corruption case at The Boston Phoenix, we killed that time in the best possible way. Somebody got up a poker game in the press room. (Heavens to Hildy Johnson!) At one point, a court officer poked his head in to remind us that gambling in a federal courthouse was, you know, non-legal. “Yeah, right,” we replied. “I’ll raise you a quarter.”\n\nRelated Story The Truth About Trump That Only the Courts See\n\nThe chatter over the nickels and dimes was all about what the extended deliberations “meant.” This is the oldest sucker’s bet in journalism. Nobody can tell what twelve individual minds can divine from the evidence presented, let alone how they can come to agree unanimously on what that evidence proves one way or another. Nobody knows anything, and only a fool would bet on it. (Brief Historical Note: The jury in that trial came back quickly, and the defendant was acquitted. I came away half a buck ahead.)\n\nWhen the jury—and, therefore, the System—brought down the ten-pound hammer on the former president* Thursday afternoon, it also shattered much of the instant, freeze-dried speculation. There was no acquittal. There was no hung jury. There was no “mixed verdict.” There were thirty-four felony counts and there were thirty-four guilty verdicts, and it took the jury less than a day to bring that gravid judgment back. I would never call their job easy. There were death threats in the air throughout the trial. There were thick clouds of squid ink billowing from the defense table. And the defendant was formerly the president* of the United States. But when the jury left the courtroom and went in back to deliberate, all extraneous ballyhoo evidently fell away and all the crooked places were made straight. Left alone with the evidence and their own common sense, the members of the jury brought strength and clarity to the proceedings, to themselves, and, one hopes fervently, to the country as well.\n\nThe Executive was crooked. The national legislature was inert. And the independent judiciary, at its most common level, stepped up and did its job. This is how that whole “separation of powers” thing was designed to work. Now we can only hope that a good New York jury and a brave New York judge have shamed the Supreme Court into tossing the spurious “executive immunity” claim onto the ash heap where it belongs and that, down in Florida, Judge Aileen (Slow Loris) Cannon will take a lesson from Juan Merchan on what being a judge is supposed to be about.\n\nDonald Trump is a convicted felon. Stormy Daniels is an American hero. And a little porn star shall lead them.\n\nCase closed, motherf*ckers.\n\nRelive the Magic: More Charlie on Trump’s Hush-Money Trial",

        "title": "Pete Hegseth Had a Really Bad Wednesday Thanks to SignalGate",
        "source": "https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/",
        "content": "Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, who swears that he’s been doing all this stuff sober, had a real bad Wednesday morning for himself. It followed a Tuesday Senate hearing in which the heads of the various intelligence branches tried to wriggle out from under the scandal regarding how the editor of The Atlantic was invited onto a chat concerning an imminent attack in Yemen. (Why are we killing people just to make the rubble bounce in Yemen? Good question.) His colleagues were quick to dive behind the excuse that no “war plans” were discussed on the chat, so what’s the big deal, dude? That alibi lasted less than a day. From the AP:\n\nIn the group chat, Hegseth posted multiple details about the impending strike, using military language and laying out when a “strike window” starts, where a “target terrorist” was located, the time elements around the attack and when various weapons and aircraft would be used in the strike. He mentioned that the U.S. was “currently clean” on operational security.\n\n“Godspeed to our Warriors,” he wrote.\n\n“1215et: F-18s LAUNCH (1st strike package)” “1345: ‘Trigger Based’ F-18 1st Strike Window Starts (Target Terrorist is @ his Known Location so SHOULD BE ON TIME – also, Strike Drones Launch (MQ-9s)” “1410: More F-18s LAUNCH (2nd strike package)” “1415: Strike Drones on Target (THIS IS WHEN THE FIRST BOMBS WILL DEFINITELY DROP, pending earlier ‘Trigger Based’ targets)” “1536 F-18 2nd Strike Starts – also, first sea-based Tomahawks launched.”“MORE TO FOLLOW (per timeline)”\n\nAnd now the punchline.\n\n“We are currently clean on OPSEC.”\n\nThe Aristocrats!\n\nShortly after The Atlantic published these receipts, the same vaudeville troupe from the intelligence community appeared before the House Intelligence Committee. Their act got roughly the same reception from the committee’s Democratic minority as it did from the Senate a day earlier. Except, of course, the latest revelations from The Atlantic necessitated some adjustments to their routine. Now, since “war plans” were indeed discussed on the chat, their primary excuse was that nothing that was discussed was classified. Rep. Joaquin Castro was unconvinced by this latest improv. First up for Castro was NSA director General Timothy Haugh:\n\nCastro: “If your organization, your agency, intercepted something like this from Russia or China or some other country, would you consider this classified information?”\n\nHaugh: “We would classify based off of our sources and methods. It would be classified based off of our collection. Based off of the protection of our own source and method, not necessarily based off the content, but how we collected that information.”\n\nCastro: “But, it would be classified? ... If you did your job and collected it from the Russian Foreign Ministry and the National Security Advisor and the Secretary of Defense and the President’s Chief Advisor—there is no way—no way, having sat on this committee for nine years, that somebody would come in with that information and give us something that says ‘unclassified—you can walk out of this room with this information and give it to whomever you want.’ ”\n\nAfter finishing with Haugh, Castro turned his attention to director of intelligence Tulsi Gabbard and CIA director John Ratcliffe, both of them former colleagues of his in the House.\n\nCastro: “You know, with all respect—you and I worked on the committee at the same time. Tulsi, you and I came in together. We’ve never had, I’ve never had an issue or beef with you. John, you and I are both from Texas—y’all know that’s a lie. It’s a lie to the country.”\n\nIt’s clear that events are starting to shuffle Hegseth toward the door. His fate now completely depends on his president’s stubborn refusal ever to admit to a mistake. The same can be said to be true of so much of the country, which is beginning to wish this vaudeville show had closed out of town.",

        "content": "Sooner or later, probably when this administration looks around and sees that there is nothing left of the old republic to destroy, the foreign owners and the editors of Tiger Beat on the Potomac will stop being so goddamn fascinated by the techniques that it employed to do so. If there ever was going to be a final example of the dangers of value-free, nonjudgmental political reporting, it’s been the performance of America’s most prominent foreign-owned political tip sheet.\n\nMonday morning’s lead item was a perfect example. It was a bloodless examination of how well Elon Musk and Project 2025 mastermind Russell Vought are working an “outside-inside” strategy to destroy the federal government.\n\nMusk, the impulsive Silicon Valley billionaire, provides the public face to the bureaucracy-slashing efforts and takes the heat for the budget-cratering, employee-firing, and overall havoc-wreaking that has been unleashed on the federal government. Vought, the conservative budget wonk, brings the expertise, insider knowledge, and ideology to a dramatic downsizing that both men see as necessary and transformational, four former Trump administration officials told POLITICO.\n\nIs “havoc-wreaking” a bad thing that ought to be deplored? Not their department, says Politico. And Vought was considered a fringe crackpot until he got the money to carry out his fantasies and the ear of a president who doesn’t know anything about anything. Now the richest man in the world and a career apparatchik, both in the employ of a grifter in chief and working with a congressional majority apparently assimilated into the ruling Borg, have managed to wreck the place with impunity. Again, I ask, is havoc-wreaking a bad thing? I always thought it was. But then again, I’m not a “former Trump administration official.” Fine sourcing there.\n\nOne of the former administration officials called Musk a “game changer” for Vought. Without Musk, “it would have been more confined to what OMB can do versus sending roving gangs of people to the agencies and doing, like, a hostile takeover,” the former official said.\n\nGreat. Bureaucratic thuggery in service of a shakedown and a “hostile takeover” of agencies that actually belong to all of us. Is this a bad thing? Not our department, says Politico.\n\nBut critics argue that approach has been sloppy, cruel, and chaotic, leaving many federal workers fearful of whether they’ll have a job when they show up to work the next morning and slashing budgets that they say provide necessary services. Max Stier, CEO of the nonpartisan, nonprofit Partnership for Public Service, said that Musk’s “reign of chaos furthers much of what Vought desires” but doubted whether what he called their “marriage of convenience” would last.\n\n“Critics argue” whether the approach has been “sloppy” and “chaotic”? And some head of a non-profit you’ve never heard of thinks a Musk–Vought split is somehow inevitable. My God, you don’t have to be a “critic” to “argue” that there aren’t “tens of millions” of people over 100 receiving Social Security, or that firing 350 staffers at the National Nuclear Security Administration, and then trying to hire them back only to find that nobody had thought to obtain their current contact information, was no way to run a government. And waiting for the Musk–Vought schism is not a tenable strategy for the survival of democratic government.\n\nNot their department, says Politico.",

        "source": "https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/",
        "content": "Operation Shakedown has finally reached the banks of the Charles, as we all knew it would—if not inevitably, then certainly when Columbia University prostrated itself in front of the administration’s button men. From The Boston Globe:\n\nThe announcement comes 10 days after the task force secured extraordinary concessions from Columbia University in a similar review that placed nearly $5 billion of that school’s federal funding at risk. Directly targeting Harvard is a significant escalation in the Trump administration’s crackdown on elite universities and what it describes as their failure to protect Jewish students from antisemitism and harassment. That campaign also includes arresting and threatening to deport international students linked to the pro-Palestinian campus movement, such as a Tufts University graduate student who was arrested in Somerville last week.\n\nIf the republic is very lucky, we may one day discover how Columbia came to be so cowardly and stupid as to give in to what is quite obviously administration extortion. Until then, let’s all agree that this has as much to do with anti-Semitism as it does with the periodic table of elements. This is about the breaking of institutions wealthy enough to resist the rising power of an authoritarian plutocracy. For example, here’s premier education vandal Christopher Rufo, who’s already done so much to resegregate American higher education. Rufo has made a good living off the essential cowardice of said institutions. He began by creating bogeymen out of critical race theory and DEI programs. He’s been busy, busy again.\n\nChristopher Rufo, an influential conservative activist, urged the Trump administration last week to “export the new Columbia prototype to all universities—starting with those in the Ivy League.”\n\nWhy? The protests over the invasion of Gaza occurred all over the country. Two of the most conspicuously violent of them occurred at the University of California at Berkeley and at UCLA. (A study published by an independent nonprofit concluded that 97 percent of the demonstrations were not violent at all.) And the use to which the administration has put those demonstrations—and the accusations of anti-Semitism—is almost unfathomably cynical. Accosting and disappearing university students in broad daylight for contributing essays to campus newspapers decrying the activities of a foreign government would be comical if the government were not actually doing it. It’s about gathering power here, not bombs dropping there.\n\nThe answer is obvious. The Ivy League is, rightly or wrongly, considered to be a collection of the nation’s most elite universities. They are wealthy and influential. Their alumni are some of the most powerful individuals in the country. And Harvard is the preeminent brand among the Ivies. It is a very tempting target for Rufo and this administration’s wrecking crew. They have announced their intention to make a target out of Harvard, and the ball is now in the university’s court.\n\nAnd if Harvard is what Harvard always has said it is, Operation Shakedown should stop at its gates. No cooperation. No concessions. No surrender. At north of $50 billion, Harvard has the largest endowment of any university in the world. Of all American universities, Harvard is best equipped for outright resistance. All it will take is that the university stand firm, and that its donors do the same. Fight fiercely, Hah-vid. It’s time to live up to your rep.",

        "source": "https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/",
        "content": "Keep your face always toward the sunshine, said old Walt Whitman, and shadows will fall behind you. So let’s take what we can get. This weekend, in blazing-red Louisiana, Governor Jeff Landry got his jewels kicked through the roof of his mouth. Landry threw his support behind four MAGA-friendly amendments to the state constitution, and all four of them lost. From the Louisiana Illuminator:\n\n\n\nNearly two-thirds of voters rejected all of the amendments in an election that could have broader political implications for the rest of Landry’s term. The governor, who has sometimes relied on strong-arm tactics to get his agenda through the Louisiana Legislature, could become more vulnerable to pushback after failing to pass his most ambitious policy proposal at the ballot box.\n\nLandry’s priority for the election, Amendment 2, would have lowered the maximum income tax rate the state could enact and restricted annual state budget increases. It also would have made it more difficult to enact new tax breaks. The proposal was expected to produce a financial windfall for Landry and state legislators later this year. Amendment 2 would have moved hundreds of millions of dollars in tax revenue from state savings accounts into Louisiana’s general fund, where Landry and state legislators could have spent it more easily.\n\nIn Louisiana? Bad idea. Very damn bad idea.\n\nAmendment 3, which 66% of voters opposed, would have made it easier to send more minors to adult jails and prisons for longer sentences. It spurred national criminal justice reform organizations, such as the Vera Institute and Southern Poverty Law Center, to spend more than $500,000 to turn voters against it. Sarah Omojola, Louisiana director for the Vera Institute, said the results for Amendment 3 show voters are starting to reject incarceration as the sole option for criminal justice. She added that high incarceration rates have only served to destabilize communities rather than reduce crime. “In defeating Amendment 3, voters made clear their desire for the things that actually make our communities safer—like quality education and opportunity,” Omojola said in a statement.\n\nThat is a thoroughgoing ass-kicking—66 percent? zowie—and it is yet another example of conservative policies being far less popular than the people dreaming them up. This shutout was also an example of effective political branding and organization. A lot of people should take careful notes about what the people who beat these amendments have done.\n\nWhile those organizations focused on defeating Amendment 3, they also became the backbone of a “No on All” campaign working to vote down all four of the constitutional amendments Landry was pushing. Supporters of the tax proposal in Amendment 2 said they believed the criminal justice issue had a negative effect on their measure in interviews earlier this week. “[Amendment 3] is a huge motivation of the groups that are saying no to everything. That seems to be the motivating factor,” said Daniel Erspamer, CEO of the Pelican Institute, a conservative think tank that helped push the tax and budget amendment.\n\n“No on all.” Simple, easily understood, and a more than decent rallying cry. It made for a fine bumper sticker too. And it tacitly recognizes that the assault on American institutions is a general threat that requires a general result.\n\n\n\nThe defeat of Amendments 2 and 3 also likely led to the downfall of Amendment 1, which failed with 65% of voters against the proposal. It would have allowed the formation of specialty courts in Louisiana with jurisdiction outside current parish and judicial districts. Amendment 4 also failed, with 64% of voters. It would have adjusted the rules for special elections to fill vacant or new judgeships, primarily on the Louisiana Supreme Court.\n\nTurnout for the election was also higher than anticipated. There were no other statewide issues to decide, and only a limited number of local races. Projections called for 12% of state voters of cast ballots, but numbers from the Secretary of State placed turnout at 21%.\n\n“No on all” sounds like it might fit future judicial nominations right nicely, cher.\n\n",

        "source": "https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/",
        "content": "By happy accident, or by the intervention of a giddy Deity, on Tuesday, the Senate Intelligence Committee had scheduled its annual national threat assessment hearing. This brought before the committee Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, FBI director Kash Patel, CIA director John Ratcliffe, and a couple of other members of the intelligence community one day after it was revealed that the editor of The Atlantic had been invited to a group chat with most of these people regarding the imminent attack by the United States on Houthi rebels in Yemen. It surely comes as no surprise that the tap-dancing from the witness table was something unseen on TV since the last time TCM ran Singin' In The Rain.\n\nThe general subtext of the testimony was a not-subtle attempt to shift the blame to people who weren't there—to National Security Advisor Mike Waltz and even to Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth. Meanwhile, both Ratcliffe and Gabbard were parboiled by Democratic senators as they first tried to dodge the fact that they were on the group chat and, when called on that, they either claimed that there was nothing classified discussed on the chat, or that they couldn't talk about certain subjects because they were, well, classified. Ratcliffe had a particularly hard time; for a CIA director, he didn't seem to have much to do with intelligence, in any sense of the word. First, Senator Michael Bennet of Colorado lit him up.\n\nI am curious about whether... did Jeff Goldberg somehow—did he create a hoax that allowed him to become part of this Signal thread? Please answer the question. Don't insult the intelligence of the American people. Did he invite himself to the signal thread?\n\nDir. Ratcliffe: I do not know how he was invited...\n\nThen, Senator Jon Ossoff of Georgia asked Ratcliffe simply if the inclusion of Goldberg on the chat was a \"huge mistake.\" Ratcliffe went into a buck-and-wing, denying that the inclusion of the journalist was a \"huge mistake.\" Ossoff went into orbit.\n\nThat was not a huge mistake? They characterized it as an embarrassment. This is utterly unprofessional. There has been no apology. There has been no recognition of the gravity of this error. By the way, we will get the full transcript of this chain and your testimony will be measured carefully against its content.\n\nThis thing is not over. Not by a long shot.",

Certainly, the voters of Wisconsin demonstrated quite vividly what a political millstone the guy has become. (As near as I can tell, nobody likes this strange Porcelain Man.) His primary business venture has gone into the blind downward staggers. And the man has the essential personal charm of a carcinogenic pesticide. Even the president, it seems, is said to have tumbled to what a huge liability the man has become.\n\nAll of my skepticism is based on the fact that I don't trust anyone in this administration as far as I can throw a gilded commode. This include anyone speaking anonymously \"to avoid reprisals\" or whatever the rhetorical chickenshit of the day is. It would be a classic John Barron ploy to float the notion without actually doing anything about it.\n\nAnd even if it is true, so what? His damage is already done, and it will take years, if not decades, to repair it. Who needs a friendless goofball dressed up like Zorro to decimate the government when you have people like Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. to do it piecemeal for you? The day to day functions of government have been handed over to people who don't believe government should function, day to day, or, possibly, at all.

        "content": "Attributed to the late Casey Stengel, and in reference to the 1962 New York Mets, who reached heretofore unprecedented depth in their mediocrity, this not only gave the late Jimmy Breslin a great title for a book on the team but also blessed the English language with a glorious idiom for abject incompetence.\n\n“Can’t anybody here play this game?” Casey lamented.\n\nCasey died in 1975, but I’m sure that, wherever he’s sitting in heaven’s Malaprop Cafe, he wouldn’t mind if we applied his existential musings to the current presidential administration—specifically, in this case, to the Department of Defense and its current jefe, Pete Hegseth, who swears he’s doing all this stuff while sober. From The Atlantic:\n\nThe world found out shortly before 2 p.m. eastern time on March 15 that the United States was bombing Houthi targets across Yemen. I, however, knew two hours before the first bombs exploded that the attack might be coming. The reason I knew this is that Pete Hegseth, the secretary of defense, had texted me the war plan at 11:44 a.m. The plan included precise information about weapons packages, targets, and timing. This is going to require some explaining.\n\nI would think so.\n\nOn Tuesday, March 11, I received a connection request on Signal from a user identified as Michael Waltz. Signal is an open-source encrypted messaging service popular with journalists and others who seek more privacy than other text-messaging services are capable of delivering. I assumed that the Michael Waltz in question was President Donald Trump’s national security adviser. I did not assume, however, that the request was from the actual Michael Waltz. I have met him in the past, and though I didn’t find it particularly strange that he might be reaching out to me, I did think it somewhat unusual, given the Trump administration’s contentious relationship with journalists—and Trump’s periodic fixation on me specifically. It immediately crossed my mind that someone could be masquerading as Waltz in order to somehow entrap me. It is not at all uncommon these days for nefarious actors to try to induce journalists to share information that could be used against them.\n\nWhew. Paranoia strikes deep. Sufficient to out current moment, of course. But one thing we can be sure of is that, if the administration did set up a Veritas-style ratfck, they were better-than-even money to screw it up. And one of the ways we know that is that the actual facts of this particular situation are a spectacular example of utter incompetence.\n\nTwo days later—Thursday—at 4:28 p.m., I received a notice that I was to be included in a Signal chat group. It was called the “Houthi PC small group.” A message to the group, from “Michael Waltz,” read as follows: “Team – establishing a principles [sic] group for coordination on Houthis, particularly for over the next 72 hours. My deputy Alex Wong is pulling together a tiger team at deputies/agency Chief of Staff level following up from the meeting in the Sit Room this morning for action items and will be sending that out later this evening.” ...\n\n\n\n... The term principals committee generally refers to a group of the senior-most national-security officials, including the secretaries of defense, state, and the treasury, as well as the director of the CIA. It should go without saying—but I’ll say it anyway—that I have never been invited to a White House principals-committee meeting, and that, in my many years of reporting on national-security matters, I had never heard of one being convened over a commercial messaging app.\n\nThe gob, it is smacked.\n\nThese guys organized a meeting to discuss a military strike and nobody thought to ask, “Gee, fellas, isn’t it kind of weird that we invited the editor of The Atlantic to this top-secret strategy conference?” Or nobody bothered to check the call list, and I guess we’re lucky they didn’t invite Oprah or Jim Cantore.\n\nIt was the next morning, Saturday, March 15, when this story became truly bizarre.\n\nDon’t just take his word for it.\n\nAll along, members of the Signal group were aware of the need for secrecy and operations security. In his text detailing aspects of the forthcoming attack on Houthi targets, Hegseth wrote to the group—which, at the time, included me—“We are currently clean on OPSEC.”\n\nThe answer to the Stengel Question is, in this case, nobody.",

        "source": "https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/",
        "content": "Senator John Fetterman, occasional Democrat of Pennsylvania, has been very big on the Dems in Disarray circuit, arguing that the president’s narrow victory in 2024 was really a landslide in disguise. From the Financial Times:\n\n“Some of the most extreme voices now are coming from the far-blue places that are removed from the real fight—and that’s down in the important states that decide who’s going to win the White House,” he said. Simply obstructing Republicans at every turn would be a “political loser” with average Americans, he added, impeding Democrats’ ability to defeat the Republicans in 2028. “The last time we were yelling and screaming and demanding new leadership, how did it work out?” he asked, referring to Biden’s removal. “Maybe we should just realize where we are and try to figure out a way forward—rather than just reacting.”\n\nTo be fair, Fetterman of late has been loud in his denunciations of Elon Musk and DOGE. Maybe he should get in touch with these constituents, too. From the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette:\n\nAgents from the Mount Pleasant office arrived at the scene shortly after the body of Joseph Guzzo Jr. had been pulled from under the massive chunk of earth that collapsed in the mine tunnel four years ago. Then, months after launching an investigation that found the operator failed to provide critical protections, it happened again. Another worker in a mine just an hour away suffered catastrophic injuries after a large rock broke from a wall and slammed him against a machine.\n\nAgents from the Mine Safety and Health Administration office carried out an inquiry once again and found the operator failed to detect the breakdowns in the wall that led to its collapse. Year after year, investigators from the Mount Pleasant office—the most active mine safety center in the nation—launched inquiries into deaths and devastating injuries in some of the largest underground mines in the country.\n\nGod’s work, if anything is. Of course, Musk’s Cargo Shorts Militia finds most of God’s work to be ... inefficient.\n\nIn an ongoing effort to slash spending, the Department of Government Efficiency has targeted the mining agency in a move that surprised local inspectors and raised questions about the future of federal regulation in one of the country’s most dangerous jobs. “Without the federal inspections, coal operations will just run rampant,” said Tony Oppegard, a former Kentucky mine safety prosecutor and MSHA legal adviser. “There won’t be any accountability.” It’s not clear if the inspectors at the local office and others will be transferred or lose their jobs, but the cancelling of the leases comes as the number of injured workers has been increasing in some of the most active mines in the U.S., the Post-Gazette has found.\n\nIt seems almost preposterous to have to argue that mine-safety regulations ought to be some of the most stringent—if not draconian—in all of federal law. Hell, this was an issue that prompted the largest armed labor hostilities in this country. That the DOGE and pony show is blindly rolling back the enforcement capacity in this area is making these people at risk for what is tantamount to negligent homicide.\n\nThe move by the new agency is the latest in a series of actions by federal officials that have raised alarms among safety advocates, who have long pushed for greater safeguards in mining. After years of medical experts warning about a new form of black lung disease caused by an insidious toxin—silica dust—federal regulators created a rule that would force coal operators to drastically reduce exposure levels underground. The protection, which cuts in half the amount of silica allowed in the air, is set to take effect next month, but is now under legal challenges by trade groups and allies in Congress who are threatening to roll it back under the new administration.\n\n“It’s a struggle,” said Jimmy Phillips, a retired West Virginia miner who was diagnosed with black lung a decade ago. “It feels like someone put an elephant on your chest after you go a little ways.” Year after year, he and others suffering from the disease travel to the Bluestone Health Association clinic in Princeton, W.Va.—some strapped to oxygen tanks or carrying inhalers. There, they get breathing treatments, medication and other care for an illness that has no cure. Though the clinic is funded partially through federal grants from the Health Resources and Services Administration, safety advocates say they’re concerned the money could be reduced or end under the new administration.\n\nThe lung disease caused by silica dust is even more crippling, and more lethal, than the more familiar “black lung” caused by inhaling coal dust.\n\nAnother visitor, Randall Dickerson, 49, is like so many others: The simple tasks of life are often insurmountable. “For me to walk 100 feet—it’s tough,” said the married father of three. “I wake up in the morning, I’m coughing my brains out. I have to use an inhaler and an oxygen machine, and I’m not even 50. That should never happen at my age.” When the illness is caused by silica—fine crystals that are more dangerous than coal dust—the chances of survival grow even more grim, experts say. “It’s like pieces of glass eating into your lungs,” said Amanda Lawson, a Bluestone benefits counselor who works with her mother, Ms. Johnson, at the center.\n\nGod’s work, all of them.",

From The Washington Post:\n\nThe Social Security Administration website crashed four times in 10 days this month, blocking millions of retirees and disabled Americans from logging in to their online accounts because the servers were overloaded. In the field, office managers have resorted to answering phones at the front desk as receptionists because so many employees have been pushed out. But the agency no longer has a system to monitor customers’ experience with these services, because that office was eliminated as part of the cost-cutting efforts led by Elon Musk.\n\nAnd the phones keep ringing. And ringing.\n\nThe federal agency that delivers $1.5 trillion a year in earned benefits to 73 million retired workers, their survivors and poor and disabled Americans is engulfed in crisis—further undermining its ability to provide reliable and quick service to vulnerable customers, according to internal documents and more than two dozen current and former agency employees and officials, customers and others who interact with Social Security.\n\nHeartless, because the Porcelain Man doesn’t care about any carbon-based life-form except himself, and he’s probably working on that, too. Gutless, because they wouldn’t dare come for Social Security in a frontal assault. (George W. Bush tried that, and his 2004 mandate vanished overnight.) So they weaken it from within, day after day, cut after cut, until they can claim that the system is broken and they can push it over so it shatters. The finest social-welfare program in the country’s history, as transformative a public-policy victory as any other, and it is being crippled unto death by a South African blow-in with enough money to buy the future so he can trash it.\n\nLeland Dudek—the accidental leader elevated to acting commissioner after he fed data to Musk’s team behind his bosses’ backs—has issued rapid-fire policy changes that have created chaos for front-line staff. Under pressure from the secretive Musk team, Dudek has pushed out dozens of officials with years of expertise in running Social Security’s complex benefit and information technology systems. Others have left in disgust.\n\nHe sounds like a swell fella. There is nobody in this administration worthy of the trust you’d give to a Gaboon viper. And that includes the guy at the top.\n\nAlarmed lawmakers are straining to answer questions from angry constituents in their districts. Calls have flooded into congressional offices. The AARP announced on Monday that more than 2,000 retirees per week have called the organization since early February—double the usual number—with concerns about whether benefits they paid for during their working careers will continue. Social Security is the primary source of income for about 40 percent of older Americans. Trump has said repeatedly that the administration “won’t touch” Social Security, a promise that aides say applies to benefit levels that can only be adjusted by Congress. But in just six weeks, the cuts to staffing and offices have already taken a toll on access to benefits, officials and advocates say.\n\n“Trump Has Said Repeatedly” may be the singularly worthless phrase in the English language.",

        "source": "https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/",
        "content": "One of the regular tropes from our previous exercise in self-destruction that I kept handy was the fact that the claim that “we hire only the best people” never would stop being funny. Now that we’re deep into Hell’s Encore, it’s time to trot it out again, with the caveat that it isn’t as funny the second time around. From The Washington Post:\n\nThe Department of Health and Human Services has hired David Geier to conduct the analysis, according to the officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation. Geier and his father, Mark Geier, have published papers claiming vaccines increase the risk of autism, a theory that has been studied for decades and scientifically debunked. David Geier was disciplined by Maryland regulators more than a decade ago for practicing medicine without a license. He is listed as a data analyst in the HHS employee directory.\n\nThere is, of course, absolutely no need for any study of whether vaccines cause autism. They don’t. And if you need proof, there are only a couple hundreds studies debunking the whole notion you can look up. But if you’re going to form a committee to study a nonexistent medical phenomenon, who better than a non-doctor to head it up?\n\n“It seems the goal of this administration is to prove that vaccines cause autism, even though they don’t,” said Alison Singer, president of the Autism Science Foundation, a nonprofit organization that funds autism research. “They are starting with the conclusion and looking to prove it. That’s not how science is done.”\n\nPresident Donald Trump and HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. have repeatedly linked vaccines to autism. Kennedy has often cited studies by David Geier and his father, a physician, asserting that their research reveals the negative effects of vaccines. ...\n\n... During Kennedy’s confirmation hearings, Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-Louisiana) pressed Kennedy to publicly disavow his past claims about vaccines and autism. Kennedy replied he would do so if presented with data disproving the link, despite the overwhelming body of research that already does.\n\nOf course, Cassidy, a real doctor, voted for Kennedy’s nomination anyway, because Hippocrates never had to worry about a future primary.\n\nEntrusting the nation’s health to a notorious quack already is having nationwide consequences. The measles epidemic in west Texas rages on despite the fact that Kennedy’s Patent Medicine Wagon rolled into town weeks ago. From The New York Times:\n\nParents in Gaines County, Texas, the center of a raging measles outbreak, have increasingly turned to supplements and unproven treatments to protect their children, many of whom are unvaccinated, against the virus. One of those supplements is cod liver oil containing vitamin A, which Mr. Kennedy has promoted as a near miraculous cure for measles. Physicians at Covenant Children’s Hospital in Lubbock, Texas, say they’ve now treated a handful of unvaccinated children who were given so much vitamin A that they had signs of liver damage. Some of them had received unsafe doses of cod liver oil and other vitamin A supplements for several weeks in an attempt to prevent a measles infection, said Dr. Summer Davies, who cares for acutely ill children at the hospital.\n\nChristamighty, I can see the medical examiner’s report now: “Cause of Death: Did Own Research on Internet.”",

        "title": "Canada’s Conservative Prime Minister Candidate Sure Seems Wired In with the Wing Nuts",
        "source": "https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/",
        "content": "Plutocracy knows no borders. Neither does its beloved cousin, political corruption. The good people at the DeSmog blog have connected a whole bunch of dots, some of which lead directly back to the usual suspects this side of the Maple Syrup Meridian. There may be tariffs on Canadian imports, but the market in influence peddling is thriving.\n\nThe point person in Canada is one Pierre Poilievre, who is leading the federal Conservatives into the snap election at the end of April. Poilievre, it seems, has wired himself into the wing-nut welfare systems in both countries.\n\nKoch Industries, Elon Musk’s X Corp., Loblaws, Enbridge, Pathways Alliance, the Canadian Gas Association, Rumble Canada, Rebel News, Canada Proud, and Facebook. These are just a handful of the corporate interests and right-wing communications platforms linked to the inner circle of Pierre Poilievre and his federal Conservatives as Canada heads into a snap federal election scheduled for April 28.\n\nThe key to the Canadian end of this continental drift to the right is the powerful Canadian extraction industries in the western part of the country. In this, of course, they are allied with the drill-baby-drill strain of American conservatism, and both wings were frustrated by the collapse of the Keystone XL pipeline, the continent-spanning death funnel intended to bring the world’s dirtiest fossil fuel from the petro-state wastelands of Alberta to the refineries of Texas.\n\nPoilievre has for years portrayed himself as a champion of the country’s blue-collar workers who comes from “humble origins,” claiming during a speech last year that “when I’m prime minister, my obsession—my daily obsession—will be about what is best for the working-class people of this country.” Yet Poilievre and his party are linked to oil and gas companies that have made record profits from gas price inflation, grocery chains accused of price-gouging, and companies owned by the world’s richest man, Musk, a key figure in the Trump administration.\n\nUsing the map, it’s clear that the Conservative Party’s National Council, the party’s highest authority on governance matters, is a hotbed for corporate lobbyists. That isn’t a coincidence, as Conservative party members several years ago voted down a resolution barring lobbyists from the council, as The Breach reported. As a result, the organization has members such as Aaron Scheewe, managing director at the lobby group Capitol Hill Group, whose clients include X Corp.—the social media platform formerly known as Twitter—as well as MBDA Missile Systems and the Canadian International Pharmacy Association. Another council member, Anthony Matar, is a current lobbyist at Crestview Strategies, which represents cigarette companies, the oil and gas sector, and the Canadian arm of the far-right social media platform Rumble.\n\nThe council’s president, Stephen Barber, is a vice president at the lobbying firm StrategyCorp, whose clients include Pathways Alliance, an industry group comprised of Canada’s six largest oil sands companies. Poilievre himself has close ties to lobbyists. His former director of policy, David Murray, is now a senior vice president with the advocacy, marketing, and research group One Persuasion, which the National Observer reported was behind an anonymous ad campaign on Facebook claiming that “government regulation is making you poorer by stifling investment in Canada’s oil and gas sector.”\n\nThis is a far more conventional modern conservative movement than Trumpism is. For one thing, it is directly connected to a previous generation of Canadian conservative politicians.\n\nFor the first decade or so that Poilievre was a member of parliament, he served under Conservative leader Stephen Harper. That connection persists to this day through political operatives such as Hamish Marshall, a partner at One Persuasion, who says that “he was the liaison between the central agencies of government and the Prime Minister’s Office on all matters relating to public opinion research” during years when Harper was in power. Marshall also co-founded the right-wing media outlet Rebel News in 2015.\n\nHarper, who is widely seen as Poilievre’s political mentor, is himself the owner of the lobby group Harper Associates, which shares a staff member with Wellington Advocacy, another lobby group that counts Koch Industries, Suncor, and Pembina Pipeline among its clients. Haley Love, a former Wellington consultant, has helped lead digital services for Poilievre. She also formerly worked with Mobilize Media, the conservative communications firm behind the Facebook account Canada Proud. Mobilize was previously retained to work on Poilievre’s leadership campaign for the federal Conservatives. Canada Proud has been running multiple Facebook ads attacking Liberal leader Mark Carney by insinuating he has connections to Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nLovely.\n\nOne thing that Poilievre and the American president have in common is the performative benefits of the Friend of the Working Stiff pose. The DeSmog report shows that approach to be as phony in Canada as it has been here, which, as we have learned to our deep distress, doesn’t mean it won’t work.",

        "content": "The fallout from the revelation by Jeffrey Goldberg of The Atlantic that he had been inadvertently “read into” a meeting on the Signal app at which the administration’s plans to attack Houthi rebels in Yemen were discussed continues to fall like sandbags in an old vaudeville routine. Government bouffe is all the rage in Beltway entertainment these days.\n\nThe Commonwealth’s (God save it!) daily communicant at the Church of the Perpetually Ambitious, Rep. Seth Moulton, waxed profound:\n\nThere is no world in which this information should have been shared in non-secure channels.\n\nSenator Professor Warren had questions:\n\nOur national security is in the hands of complete amateurs. What other highly sensitive national security conversations are happening over group chat? Any other random people accidentally added to those, too?\n\nFormer Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg was moved to discreet profanity:\n\nFrom an operational security perspective, this is the highest level of f‑‑‑up imaginable. To see this administration claiming that it cares about competence and merit and then be responsible for an epic f‑‑‑up like this demonstrates that these are not serious people. ... This kind of intelligence failure calls the question on whether there is any place for merit or competence in this administration at all. Because if there are not highly serious consequences for this level of screwup, then it will make clear that all of the bluster about merit that you hear about from this White House is just bullshit. We deserve so much better than this.\n\nAnd Hillary Rodham Clinton was moved to succinctness:\n\nYou have got to be kidding me.\n\nIn the face of all this criticism, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, who swears he’s doing all this stuff sober, responded in fluent FoxSpeak, that strange dialect understood by angry shut-ins all over America.\n\nSo you’re talking about a Deceitful and highly discredited so-called journalist who’s made a profession of peddling hoaxes time and time again to include the, I don’t know, the hoaxes of Russia, Russia, Russia, or the fine people on both sides hoax or suckers and losers hoax. So this is the guy that peddles in garbage. This is what he does. I would love to comment on the Houthi campaign. Because of the skill and courage of our troops, I’ve monitored it very closely from the beginning, and you see, we’ve been managing 4 years of deferred maintenance under the Trump administration. Our troops, our sailors were getting shot at as targets. Our ships couldn’t sail through. And when they did shoot back, it was purely defensively or at shacks in Yemen. President Trump said no more. We will reestablish deterrence. We will open freedom of navigation. And we will ultimately decimate the Houthis, which is exactly what we’re doing as we speak from the beginning overwhelmingly details.\n\nI feel safe in my assumption that Secretary Hegseth wouldn’t know Jeffrey Goldberg if he sat in his lap. So what we got from the secretary as regards one of the most hilariously obvious exercises in incompetence was a tangle of Trumpian conjuring words designed to make all the scandals disappear. And some tough-guy posturing that was effective on the couch with Harris Faulkner but that is Punch-and-Judy bafflegab in the real world.\n\nAnd the president?\n\nI don’t know anything about it. I’m not a big fan of The Atlantic. To me, it’s a magazine that’s going out of business.\n\nWhere are the clowns?\n\nDon’t bother. They’re here.",

        "content": "The prosecution of El Caudillo del Mar-a-Lago wrapped up in Manhattan, but not before things got lively again. The defense called as its first witness one Robert Costello, who once advised prime prosecution witness Michael Cohen. (Costello was a close associate of Rudy Giuliani, which figures.) Costello has been a critic of the state’s case in the Stormy Daniels payoff case, and of Cohen, once the latter hit the silk on the former president*. There was extended legal wrangling over whether Costello could testify at all and, at least, about the limits of what he would be allowed to say. Once he got on the stand, however, he put on a very impressive show. Judge Juan Merchan was not amused. From The Guardian:\n\nJudge Juan Merchan ordered the courtroom cleared of reporters after warning Robert Costello about his responses to sustained objections. “I want to discuss proper decorum in my courtroom,” Merchan said. “So when there’s a witness on the stand and you don’t like my ruling, you don’t say ‘jeez,’ and you don’t say ‘strike it.’ Because I’m the only one who can strike....You don’t roll your eyes, do you understand that? Do you understand that? Are you staring me down right now?”\n\n“Clear the courtroom,” he then ordered.\n\nThe media have been allowed back inside after Judge Juan Merchan ordered to clear the courtroom. Court officers and Merchan would not let an attorney for the press make an application to argue for the right to stay in the courtroom. Under the law, a representative for the media or even a member of the media is allowed to petition in open court for the opportunity to stay. Trump’s non-lawyer entourage was allowed to stay.\n\nMonday’s “non-lawyer entourage” included Bernie Kerik and Alan Dershowitz. I guess we’re down to the U-Team now.",

And he’s still going as I type this post. He has moved on to shaming the House conservatives for their fiscal cruelty and irresponsibility. (Yeah, good luck with that.) What Booker is doing is not technically a filibuster since Booker is not holding up action on a specific bill. But with the help of questions from his Democratic colleagues, Booker is holding the floor, as is his right as a senator, and he is rounding into his 15th hour, and there is no damage being done to the republic from that quarter, so that’s a good thing.\n\nHe’s moved on to shaming conservative Republicans for sucking up to the guy who sucks up to Vladimir Putin by demolishing NATO. Yeah, good luck with that.\n\nSometimes it’s necessary to just stand up against the momentum. Way back in 1964, before the Sixties really got rolling, a guy named Mario Savio stood on the steps of Sproul Hall on the campus of the University of California at Berkeley and talked about what is to be done when all else fails.\n\nThere’s a time when the operation of the machine becomes so odious, makes you so sick at heart that you can’t take part! You can’t even passively take part! And you’ve got to put your bodies upon the gears and upon the wheels, upon the levers, upon all the apparatus—and you’ve got to make it stop! And you’ve got to indicate to the people who run it, to the people who own it—that unless you’re free the machine will be prevented from working at all!\n\nCory Booker is putting his body on the gears of the United States Senate because the operation of that machine has become too odious to do anything else. Now he’s talking with Senator Chris Coons about U.S. efforts at helping Africa fight against epidemic disease. Yeah, good luck with that.\n\n(He’s also having fun saying, “Ouagadougou,” the capital of Burkina Faso. He’s entitled to have some fun.)\n\nThe elite political media largely have managed not to notice what Booker is doing. It has escaped the notice of the keepers of Politico’s front page. The New York Times buried it beneath tariffs, the latest vandalism out of the White House, and the race for a seat on the Wisconsin supreme court, as did The Washington Post. Nevertheless, Cory Booker is now talking about how the president has no respect for the people his policies will hurt. Yeah, good luck with that.\n\nWe are coming up on the 250th anniversary of our revolutionary birth. There are going to be a lot of commemorations over the next decade, beginning this month at Lexington and Concord here in the Commonwealth (God save it!). We will play a big role in the celebrations until the action moves to Philadelphia next year. But the real commemoration began in 2023, when we celebrated the 250th anniversary of the Boston Tea Party, to which even that stick-in-the-mud John Adams gave respect.\n\nThis is the most magnificent Movement of all. There is a Dignity, a Majesty, a Sublimity, in this last Effort of the Patriots, that I greatly admire. The People should never rise, without doing something to be remembered—something notable And striking.\n\nThat is the spirit pushing Cory Booker toward his 20th hour, putting his body on the levers and trying for something notable and striking, and now he’s talking about the threat to Social Security. Yeah, good luck with that.",

        "content": "During the 2000s, simply no outfit was complete without the addition of a big, honking belt. You know the ostentatious kind that I’m talking about: An extra-wide style that instantly makes its presence known. The brazen accessory was never really there to hold up anything, either—it was designed for fashion not function, and you got bonus points if it was fastened just below the bust, not even remotely near your waistline. All of the It girls of the decade rocked the look, from Beyoncé and Rihanna to Paris Hilton. (That’s hot.)\n\nIf you’ve long moved on from Y2K style, we’re sorry to report this: The big belt is slowly creeping its way back into fashion once again. Although, it looks a little different in the present tense. On the fall 2025 runways, designers put forward a fresh new crop of big statement belts that felt decidedly more refined. (For starters, they are no longer being paired with skintight Hervé Lèger bandage dresses.) At Balmain, Olivier Rousteing paired his plushy faux fur coats with thick burgundy embossed belts. At Chloé, designer Chemena Kamali accessorized romantic billowy blouses with wide, low-slung belts—a fresh take on bohemian dressing.\n\nChloé fall 2025 Photo: Courtesy of Chloé Balmain fall 2025 Photo: Armando Grillo / Gorunway.com\n\nEven celebrities are slowly beginning to partake in the trend. Snow White star Rachel Zegler, for one, recently stepped out in a sequin top and high-waisted trousers, the latter of which was punctuated with a wide belt with circular buckle. Rose Byrne also styled her white lace dress with a thick brown leather obi belt in Paris. Compared to the Y2K styling of wide belts, both stars took an approach that feels much more subdued; The belt added dimension to the look, without totally overpowering it. (If this were 2008? The whole outfit would revolve around the belt.)\n\nPhoto: Getty Images Photo: Getty Images\n\nSo, does this rising movement mean you need to delve back into your closet, and dust off your most enormous belt of the 2000s? Not necessarily. Like any cyclical trend that comes back into the fashion fray, it’s less about replicating the exact look. Instead, the trend’s newfound presence is here to remind us that, sometimes, a hefty statement belt is just the thing your outfit needs to feel complete. Don’t discount the power of it, but don't necessarily pair it with a bandage dress either. Do as the runways did, and style it with more refined pieces instead.\n\nBelow, shop six wide belts that feel modern and fresh.",

For the occasion, she wore multiple modern interpretations of Cheongsam by Hong Kong-based brand Sau Lee: a black high-neck dress with red frog fasteners, and a black velvet midi with a thigh-high slit and exaggerated keyhole with black faster.\n\nPerhaps the most endearing part of Saint Mleux’s WAG style is its relative accessibility; Take the fluttery ruffled olive green Reformaiton maxi dress with a matching scarf that she wore to the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix last year, or the red With Jéan vest festooned with a rose that she donned in Miami. Sure, maybe not everyone can spring for the navy Alessandra Rich dress with white polka-dots and a Pierrot-esque collar from her Spanish Grand Prix outing, but it’s easily replicable.\n\nAfter all, you may not be able to have Charles Leclerc, but you can have Alexandra Saint Mleux’s style.

        "content": "Lewis Hamilton may be best known for his impressive race car driving—he is a seven-time winner of the Formula One World Drivers’ Championship, after all—but fashion fans know that in addition, Hamilton is no stranger to a strong red carpet look. Over the years, he has navigated events such as the Met Gala and British Fashion Awards with aplomb, choosing inventive looks that stray from the pack. It’s only natural, then, that Lewis was chosen as one of the 2025 Met Gala co-hosts—an announcement made just earlier this morning. In honor of the news, Vogue is taking a look back at some of Hamilton’s most memorable red carpet looks over the years.\n\nHamilton emerged on the global stage in the 2010s, often spotted in the era’s skinny-fit suits and graphic, designer streetwear—from satin Louis Vuitton bomber jackets to printed Prada styles. Another one of his recurring wardrobe staples? Sleek leather racing jackets—an ode to his own masterful skills behind the wheel. In recent years, however, Hamilton has become a true fashion icon, upping his style game with forward-thinking, statement-making designs. Working with stylist Eric Mcneal, Hamilton has taken traditional suits and given them a modern twist. At the 2024 Met Gala, the star driver wore a custom Burberry look that paid homage to 18th-century Black gardener John Ystumllym and poet Alex Wharton, via embroidery and a branch-like necklace. At this year’s GQ Global Creativity Awards, Hamilton donned a glitzy pinstriped coat with strands of crystals. Whenever he hits up a function, there will always be an unexpected element—and that’s the making of a true red carpet star.\n\nBelow, more of Hamilton’s best fashion moments.",

        "content": "Transcript\n\nHi, Vogue, it's Amanda Seyfried,\n\nand I'm gonna show you how I get ready,\n\nand I'm gonna do a pretty basic go-to makeup look.\n\nFirst step, drinking my celery juice.\n\nApparently that's what you do.\n\nYou might be thinking, what's that on her face?\n\nThat's my eczema, and I too suffer from perioral dermatitis.\n\nI'm gonna wash my face with something\n\nthat I've been using forever.\n\nNot only is it a great bar soap for your face,\n\nbut it's also a GD heart.\n\nWhen I was 19, I started developing the rash,\n\nand I learned about a lot of medicated products.\n\nI learned a lot about just products in general\n\nfrom my dermatologist at the time.\n\nAnd the rash is screaming, but that's okay,\n\nbecause I'm gonna cover it\n\nso I can go out in public. [laughs]\n\nIt's funny how eczema makes you feel.\n\nSo two years ago,\n\nI had another flare up and I cut out dairy.\n\nBoy, it was hard.\n\nBye-bye, cappuccinos, black coffee all the way.\n\nYou know, I can't wake up and not have coffee,\n\nso I also have coffee here.\n\nThis, don't worry.\n\nI'm using this medicated cream\n\nfor this little cutie mustache.\n\nNow I'm gonna use toner, Tonique Comfort, Confort.\n\nIt's French.\n\nI'll never be able to say it right.\n\nI'm gonna put a little bit in my hands.\n\nMy skin has gotten better over the years.\n\nI've noticed it is a little better after kids.\n\nI eat better than I ever have.\n\nI mean, the celery juice must be doing something, right?\n\nVersine Serum, Creme Serum.\n\nAnd all of this does go over the medicine,\n\nbecause the medicine penetrates first.\n\nI've just always really been into\n\nthis boosted contouring eye balm.\n\nI learned about how important specifically eye cream is\n\nfor under our eyes.\n\nIt's just such thin skin\n\nand you just gotta take care of your eyes,\n\nso even in the morning I use the eye cream.\n\nAnd then, of course, you cannot forget SPF,\n\nthe Lancome Renergie Peptide Cream.\n\nBut SPF is really important,\n\nand we know that now more than ever.\n\nThe neck is important too. Don't forget the neck.\n\nSkincare done.\n\nI'm gonna curl my lashes,\n\nbecause my eyelashes, I'll have you know, are straight.\n\nYeah, it's a bummer.\n\nI don't let other people do it\n\nbecause they sometimes pinch my eyelids.\n\nI'm also gonna put this lip balm on.\n\nThis one, it's giving youth.\n\nIt just gives a tint, and a hit of like, pink.\n\nIt gives a hint of health. [laughs]\n\nAt home, I don't use foundation,\n\nbecause I don't know how to properly apply it,\n\nand that's okay.\n\nWe don't need to.\n\nBut this, I can't live without, this Teint Idole concealer.\n\nI thought I had misplaced it the other day\n\nwhen I went to the airport,\n\nand I almost had a meltdown internally\n\nwhen I needed to cover this guy.\n\nI also have really red eyelids\n\nand you would think I'd wanna cover those up,\n\nbut it's like natural eyeshadow, so I'm gonna embrace it.\n\nI learned to do my own makeup\n\n'cause I realized over the years\n\nI know what works on my face and what doesn't,\n\nand I also am like pretty low maintenance\n\nand I don't like a lot of steps.\n\nSo I was just able to cultivate, like,\n\nthis routine over the years.\n\nYou see how easy that was?\n\nI don't need to get rid of all the redness.\n\nI wouldn't know how to even try.\n\nBut this is not a red carpet look,\n\nthis is me doing my makeup to look pretty and clean.\n\nThe next thing I'm gonna do is my eyebrows.\n\nHuh! Eyebrows. [laughs]\n\nWhat a concept.\n\nThey've changed over the years.\n\nYes, I too over-plucked, because I was born in '85,\n\nand it's taken decades to grow them back.\n\nSo Anastasia was one of the first places I went in LA\n\nin my twenties and that's where I learned about eyebrows.\n\nRight now I'm like really loving this because it's easy.\n\nI can just use the wand and they paint\n\nthe lighter colored wands and make it all more uniform,\n\nand that's what I'm looking for.\n\nAnd I'm looking for thickness,\n\nbecause they are growing back,\n\nand they're growing back well, but there's some holes.\n\nYou're just painting them.\n\nWhen I was on As the World Turns, which is a soap opera,\n\nI remember feeling embarrassed to go to set\n\nbecause I felt like I just wasn't used\n\nto seeing my face covered in so much foundation and powder\n\nthat I almost like, my face would crack a little bit,\n\nand as a 15-year-old, that's scary,\n\nbut I look back and I'm like, that's TV makeup.\n\nAnd I looked really cute.\n\nLike, I didn't look ugly,\n\nI just felt ugly because I was a teenager,\n\nand that's just, that's what we do.\n\nSo now I'm gonna put the Anastasia gel on\n\nto hold it in place, 'cause I don't know about you,\n\nbut when I leave the house\n\nand I like put a sweater on or sweatshirt,\n\nI always put it over my face and it messes with my brows.\n\nI'll put a little bit more of this on.\n\nGoing from the soap operas that I had done\n\nto Mean Girls happened so randomly and so fast\n\nthat I was just going with the flow\n\nand I was just happy to be working.\n\nI knew how lucky I was,\n\nbut we didn't quite know how big that movie was gonna be.\n\nAlthough that sounds really sad,\n\nit kinda helped prepare me for the rejection\n\nthat every actor has.\n\nThe thing that I never understood was blush\n\nand it took me until my mid-thirties to discover the blush.\n\nIt's the secret weapon.\n\nIt's incredible!\n\nLike, I don't have rosy cheeks, unless I'm freezing.\n\nMonika Blunder is another beautiful makeup artist\n\nthat I've been working with since I was, since Mamma Mia!\n\nI'm obsessed with this Liquid Flush.\n\nIt looks like moisturizer,\n\nbut it's the most beautiful color.\n\nI put it on my hand.\n\nThis one is Salzburg, this one is my favorite.\n\nI just wrapped a movie in Budapest. It's a musical.\n\nI don't know how to describe the experience\n\nof shooting Ann Lee, the musical.\n\nIt is unlike anything else I've ever done,\n\nand it's unlike anything I think anyone's ever seen.\n\nI just wrapped Long Bright River,\n\nwhich is the show that's coming out on Peacock,\n\nand that was a lot,\n\nand I didn't have time to do my voice lessons,\n\nwhich I always do.\n\nWhen I was pregnant,\n\nI was doing them three times a week on Zoom,\n\nbut it was okay because the singing wasn't so technical.\n\nIt was more about using my, like, feeling the human.\n\nI'm singing through suffering, I'm singing through joy.\n\nI had to move my body in ways that I wouldn't normally\n\nwhen I'm recording a song, so, you'll see.\n\nThe most important thing since day one\n\nof learning how to do makeup is mascara for me,\n\nbecause I have blonde eyelashes,\n\nand so does my son, that poor boy,\n\nand when I was shooting Limited Too,\n\nI shot Limited Too with Leighton Meester, by the way.\n\nNot a lot of people know that.\n\nEverybody was so pretty and I was just so awkward,\n\nand I had braces at one point,\n\nand I remember going to the bathroom and putting mascara on,\n\nbecause no one was putting mascara on me 'cause I was a kid\n\nand I felt ugly.\n\nThat poor little girl,\n\n'cause I look back at these pictures, they're so beautiful.\n\nLike, we all looked so happy and youthful,\n\nand it goes to show like the pressure we put on ourselves\n\nat such a young age.\n\nAnd, God, my role as a mother is just like to pay attention\n\nto what my girl especially is going through,\n\nbecause she's older\n\nand I just wanna make sure she feels protected\n\nand she feels beautiful,\n\nand it doesn't have to do with the length\n\nor color of your eyelashes or eyebrows.\n\nIt's more about us and less about what the world is seeing.\n\nFlutter Extension Idole Mascara. It's new.\n\n[gentle music]\n\nThis is the matte lipstick, which I love,\n\nbecause I honestly, I don't put it all over my lips.\n\nI learned on a shoot once in London\n\nthat you can smudge the matte\n\nand it looks actually way cooler.\n\nSo I'm gonna do this a little bit, and go like this.\n\nI love a red lip at night.\n\nFor the daytime, I don't wanna scare people.\n\nSometimes when you rub your lips,\n\nthey look a little plump.\n\nDo I look like I'm going to the prom? No.\n\nBut I could totally go glam grocery shopping,\n\nand I can also just go out to lunch and I look clean.\n\nThe last thing I do,\n\nwhich is actually really fun because I am super translucent,\n\nis my friend Roxy, who I work with very often,\n\nshe made this Bronze Glow Mist.\n\nThis is just giving health.\n\n[can hisses]\n\nThat's it.\n\nIt's a color,\n\nand it looks like you've just been to the beach.\n\nMy hair was done, like, full disclosure,\n\nDJ Quintero did my hair yesterday.\n\nFruit press.\n\nIt's giving, she didn't just wake up,\n\nbut I swear to God, haven't brushed it.\n\nI have good hair, I'm gonna admit it,\n\nI know I have good hair,\n\nbut with good hair comes eczema, you know,\n\nit's gotta balance out the scales.\n\nThank you.",

        "content": "Transcript\n\nHi, Vogue, I'm Twiggy,\n\nand this is my Life in Looks.\n\n[intriguing mellow orchestral music]\n\nAh. [laughs]\n\nI do remember this.\n\nThis was taken by the wonderful Bert Stern\n\nwho, in the '50s and '60s,\n\nI think he was one of the biggest fashion photographers.\n\nAnd, actually, my first trip to New York,\n\nhe came on board to do a documentary of my trip.\n\nAnd I think there's a series of me pulling faces like this,\n\nkind of scrunching my nose up and going like that,\n\nand this one with my mouth open.\n\nIt's kind of been around a long time.\n\nBut he was such a brilliant man, a lovely photographer.\n\nThat first year of modeling\n\nafter I was discovered in February '66,\n\nwas like a whirlwind.\n\nI was a schoolgirl, and I was a mod.\n\nI used to do makeup at weekends\n\nand I devised that makeup and I became a model,\n\nwhich was three pairs of eyelashes on top,\n\nthe drawn ones underneath,\n\nwhich I got the idea from a ragdoll\n\nthat I had in my bedroom.\n\nSomebody had a friend of a friend who worked on a magazine\n\nand said, I think you should go and meet this woman,\n\n'cause I think you could maybe model.\n\nSo I met this woman.\n\nI was quite upset really,\n\n'cause she said, You'll never really make a model,\n\n'cause you're too small and you're much too slim.\n\nAnd so, I think I cried\n\non the way home on the bus. [chuckles]\n\nBut she said, I'm gonna do some test shots of your face,\n\n'cause you've got a very interesting face,\n\nbut your hair's a mess, 'cause I used to do it myself.\n\nAnd she sent me to this hairdressers called Leonard,\n\nwhich was a very posh salon in Mayfair, in London.\n\nI was gonna just have my hair styled for the photographs,\n\nand Leonard happened to be in that day,\n\nand he saw me across the salon\n\nand came over and said, Can I cut your hair?\n\nAnd I went back the next day\n\nand he did the now very well known haircut\n\nthat kind of launched me, really.\n\nHe hung the photograph\n\nthat Barry Lategan took of this haircut in his salon,\n\nand big journalist of the day, Deirdre McSharry,\n\nwho worked for the Daily Express\n\nsaid, I love the haircut.\n\nWho's the girl?\n\nI've never seen her before.\n\nAnd she said, I wanna meet her.\n\nSo I got a call at my home\n\nsaying would I go up for an interview?\n\nAnd she said, I'm gonna write an article about you.\n\nAnd I already had the nickname Twiggy,\n\n'cause my legs were so skinny.\n\nAbout three weeks later,\n\nit was a big page in the Daily Express\n\nsaying Twiggy the Face of '66.\n\nAnd, on that day in February,\n\nmy life changed forever. [chuckles]\n\nOh, it's another Bert.\n\nThis is April 15th, so that would be 1967.\n\nI think this is my first ever American Vogue cover.\n\nSo it's my first Vogue cover,\n\nbecause I worked for American Vogue\n\nbefore I worked for British Vogue.\n\nAnd that was because Diana Vreeland,\n\nwho was the fashion editor of American Vogue in those days,\n\nand she was, like, the queen of fashion.\n\nI mean, whatever Diana Vreeland said was it.\n\nAnd she brought me over from the UK to America,\n\nand really changed my life.\n\nI always say that Diana Vreeland turned me global.\n\nOh! [laughs]\n\nThis is funny.\n\nThis, I was approached to do a line of clothing\n\nby manufacturers.\n\nAnd I think this is the little fashion show\n\nthat I did in the showroom,\n\nbecause all the press photographers are there,\n\nof my first collection of Twiggy dresses.\n\nI loved doing that.\n\nIt was like a dream come true,\n\nbecause, if what happened to me hadn't happened,\n\nwhat I wanted to do, I wanted to go to art school\n\nand I wanted to study fashion and design,\n\n'cause I wanted to be a fashion designer.\n\nSo, I got two wishes;\n\nI got to be a model, and I got to work on a collection.\n\nOh, yeah.\n\nOh, this is interesting.\n\nThis is from a series of photographs\n\ntaken by another great photographer, Melvin Sokolsky.\n\nAnd, on my first trip to New York in '67,\n\nI was hired to do photographs of clothing range.\n\nIt was a fabric company,\n\nand Melvin was taking the photographs,\n\nand he wanted to do me all in different places in New York,\n\nlike at the zoo,\n\nand this was with builders on a building site,\n\nand coming outside of a department store,\n\nand up the Empire State Building.\n\nAnd the first day we went out, a crowd would gather,\n\nbecause what had happened, I had arrived in New York,\n\nit was my first trip to New York,\n\nand I'd come in after The Beatles,\n\nI was part of the British invasion. [chuckles]\n\nSo people had seen me arriving at the airport,\n\n'cause there was a press conference and crowds of girls.\n\nI mean, I was overwhelmed by it all.\n\nI'd gone in to do a fashion shoot,\n\nand I had all this press coverage.\n\nWhen we went out and Melvin was taking the pictures,\n\na crowd would gather,\n\nand he would try and disperse them,\n\nbut they kept coming back.\n\nSo he had this idea,\n\nhe took me back to the studio\n\nand took photos of my face in black-and-white,\n\nwhich they made masks of, which you can see here.\n\nSo, wherever we were in New York, when a crowd gathers,\n\nhe just gave out the masks,\n\nand the plan was to collect them back every day\n\nand use them the next day,\n\nbut people wouldn't give them back,\n\nthey were keeping them as a souvenir.\n\nAnd, actually, it won them,\n\nI think, best advertising campaign of the year, I think.\n\nIt was an amazing time.\n\nAh!\n\nI love this photograph, actually.\n\nThis was taken by Richard Avedon.\n\nIt is July, it says there,\n\nso it must have been July, 1967\n\non that first big trip to New York.\n\nThey had the idea to paint this flower on my face,\n\nit's beautiful actually,\n\nand slick my hair back.\n\nOver the years, a lot of people,\n\nthey've done copies of this photograph,\n\nwith famous actresses, recreated it.\n\nBut it's a beautiful photograph.\n\nOh.\n\nI remember this very well.\n\nThis is from my first movie called The Boy Friend,\n\nin which I played the lead girl called Polly Browne,\n\nand it was directed by Ken Russell.\n\nThere's a scene in it\n\nwhere it's a song called Poor Little Pierrette.\n\nSo I've got a pierrette and pierrot outfit on\n\nwith the little ballet slippers,\n\nand the white clown face.\n\nHis wife, Shirley Russell did all the costume,\n\nand she was absolutely brilliant.\n\nShe did all the costumes for all his films,\n\nand she was amazing.\n\nAnd all my clothes in The Boy Friend,\n\nthey're so beautiful,\n\nbecause they're all like 1920s, '30s.\n\nThey're absolutely gorgeous.\n\nI think I was like 18 and a half when we started filming.\n\nIt came out I think in '70 or '71,\n\nand I won two Golden Globe Awards for it.\n\nAnd it changed my life,\n\nbecause, from then on,\n\nI decided I didn't wanna model anymore,\n\nI wanted to pursue this acting musical career, which I did.\n\nAh.\n\nThe Bowie Pin Ups photograph.\n\nThis is interesting, actually,\n\nbecause I got a call from British Vogue\n\nabout doing a photograph with David Bowie.\n\nThis must have been probably early '70s.\n\nYou've gotta remember that Bowie was enormous.\n\nHe was the biggest pop star\n\ncertainly in the UK and probably in the world,\n\nand I was a huge, huge fan.\n\nAnd a couple of years earlier,\n\nI'd been at home and on the radio,\n\nyou know, they were playing pop music,\n\nand his new single came out\n\nand it was called Drive-In Saturday,\n\nand there's a line in it where he says\n\nShe'd sigh like Twig the Wonder Kid,\n\nand I was like, Oh my God.\n\nDavid Bowie just said my name in a song.\n\nI was like, Oh I was so...\n\n'Cause I loved him, I thought he was brilliant.\n\nAnd then, a few months later, I got the call\n\nsaying would I'd be up for doing a photograph\n\nfor the cover of Vogue with Bowie?\n\nAnd I said, Absolutely, I'd love it,\n\n'cause I'd never met him.\n\nHe was, at the time, in Paris recording the Pin Ups album.\n\nSo I went to Paris and met him.\n\nAnd, you know, he was just amazing man,\n\nso bright, so clever, so modest,\n\njust a really great guy,\n\napart from being incredibly talented.\n\nAnd we got on really well.\n\nWe did the photograph, I went back to London,\n\nand then the then editor said,\n\nWe can't put a man on the cover of British Vogue.\n\nThey wouldn't budge.\n\nSo while we were going back and forth with them,\n\nDavid said, Why don't I just put it on the cover\n\nof my album?\n\nWhich he did,\n\nso it became the cover of Pin Ups,\n\nand it's had a much longer life, actually,\n\nbecause every time it's reissued in a different format,\n\nout comes the cover of Pin Ups. [laughs]\n\nAw!\n\nAw, that's happy memories.\n\nThis is taken in the Big Biba store.\n\nNow, Biba, for those who don't know,\n\nI think most people in fashion do know,\n\nBiba was the dream place to go and shop\n\nin the mid '60s, late 60's, into the early '70s.\n\nBiba was the first place in London\n\nthat you could buy affordable clothes for young people.\n\nAnd Biba was the inspiration\n\nof a wonderful, wonderful lady\n\nwho was one of my dear, dear friends,\n\nI love her so much, Barbara Hulanicki.\n\nAnd Barbara brought Biba to London.\n\nThis is one of the photographs taken in the Big Biba,\n\n'cause it went from a tiny boutique to a mid-size boutique,\n\nand then they took over a department store,\n\nand it was one of the most beautiful department stores\n\nin the world.\n\nBut I love this, 'cause it's my memory of Barbara.\n\nOh gosh!\n\nIn 1983, I was doing a big Broadway musical\n\ncalled My One and Only with Tommy Tune.\n\nThis was the night of the Tony Awards,\n\nand I had this dress made.\n\nActually, it's very high-cut.\n\nI've just... [laughs].\n\nI just went to a dress maker, I did a drawing,\n\nand I said, Can you make this?\n\nAnd I had the points here that go over the finger.\n\nSo I love my hair.\n\nI think I did that by braiding it the night before.\n\nBut it was a great night.\n\nI mean, it's always a great night,\n\nyou know, it's the biggest night for theater in New York.\n\nOh.\n\nThis must be another pap shot.\n\nThis is the mid '90s Drama League Awards,\n\nwhich I think are in New York.\n\nBut it's interesting\n\nbecause my signature look has mostly been,\n\nif I go back to look at the clothes that I love,\n\nI love that boyish kind of look,\n\nmen's trouser suits.\n\nYou couldn't get men's suits for women in those days.\n\nSo I went to a tailor called Tommy Nutter in Savile Row.\n\nHe was one of my friends\n\nand one of the great tailors of that era.\n\nAnd he used to make me, you know, boy suits\n\nwith waistcoats and trousers and the jacket.\n\nAnd this is a kind of,\n\nI don't think this is a Tommy Nutter,\n\nbut it's that kind of look.\n\nSo I've always loved that look.\n\nOh!\n\nWell, this one's interesting.\n\nSo this is early '90s.\n\nSo, bear in mind that I kind of quit modeling\n\nwhen I started doing The Boy Friend.\n\nSo, in 1970, I decided I wasn't gonna model anymore.\n\nI wanted to pursue my performing career.\n\nIn the early '90s,\n\nI got a call through my agent\n\nfrom a wonderful photographer called Steven Meisel.\n\nHe wanted to do a 10-page spread with me for Italian Vogue.\n\nI flew to New York, and we did this amazing spread.\n\nBut the funny thing\n\nis that I got to the studio in New York ahead of him,\n\nI was in makeup and hair,\n\nand he came in to say hello.\n\nI got up and said, Oh, it's so lovely to meet you,\n\nI'm a huge fan, and thank you for asking to do it.\n\nAnd he said, We've met before.\n\nAnd I went, Oh my God, I'm so...\n\nI don't remember.\n\nWhen did we meet? I don't remember.\n\nHe said, No, you wouldn't remember.\n\nHe said that I was 12. [laughs]\n\nAnd what had happened,\n\nwhen I first went to New York in 1967,\n\nhe was a 12-year-old boy, he lived in New Jersey,\n\nand he'd seen on the TV that I'd arrived in New York.\n\nHe and his friend decided they wanted to come and meet me.\n\nSo they took the day off school,\n\nthey got the ferry over from New Jersey to New York,\n\nthey found where Melvin Sokolsky studio was,\n\nthey rang the doorbell.\n\nAnd at the time,\n\nI was being filmed for the Bert Stern documentary.\n\nAnd somebody answered the door\n\nand they said, We wanna meet Twiggy,\n\nand the person said, No, you can't, go away.\n\nAnd the director of the documentary said,\n\nNo, no, bring them up.\n\nIt'd be good footage.\n\nSo these two young boys came out,\n\nI came out.\n\nNow, I don't remember this, and I told Steven that.\n\nHe said, You came out of the dressing room,\n\nand I said, Oh, I hope I was nice to you,\n\nand he said, No, you were lovely.\n\nAnd I signed pictures for them, and we chatted,\n\nand they went away really happy, apparently.\n\nAnd, apparently, he said to his friend\n\non the ferry back to New Jersey,\n\nhe said, One day, I'm gonna photograph her,\n\n'cause he'd always wanted to be a photographer.\n\nSo it took from 1967 to 1992, or whatever it was,\n\nfor him to photograph me,\n\nbut I just thought it was such a sweet story.\n\nAw, me and Kate.\n\nThis is by Solve Sundsbo,\n\nI hope I've pronounced that properly,\n\nhe's a Scandinavian photographer, wonderful photographer.\n\nAnd we were doing a shoot for i-D Magazine,\n\nand they were photographing all different models\n\nfrom different eras.\n\nAnd the day I was booked to go in,\n\nKate Moss was in.\n\nSo she was in in the morning and we overlapped,\n\nI went into makeup and Kate was having her photograph taken.\n\nAnd then Solve came to me and said,\n\nAs you're both here today,\n\nit would be lovely to get a picture of you together.\n\nWhat do you think?\n\nAnd I said, Well, I'd love it, I'm game for it.\n\nAnd he asked Kate, and she said,\n\nOh, yeah, that'd be great.\n\nI love the way she's leaning on me, it's brilliant.\n\nI love Kate, she's so lovely.\n\nAnd it's interesting,\n\nbecause we're both kind of the same height,\n\nI mean, she's obviously much younger than me.\n\nBut, you know, when I hit in the '60s,\n\nI wouldn't have been taken by a model agency,\n\n'cause I was too small and too thin.\n\nWhen what happened to me happened,\n\nit changed the criteria\n\nof what agencies would take girls on for.\n\nAnd Kate came along two decades later,\n\nand was very similar size and shape to me, when I began.\n\nAnd, you know, she's one of the great models,\n\nand one of the nicest girls in the world.\n\nI love her.\n\nOh, I remember this day.\n\nI won't forget this day,\n\nas long as I live, I don't think.\n\nI'm in a beautiful Stella McCartney suit that she made me\n\nand a hat,\n\nthat, funny enough, the little hat,\n\n'cause this is at the Palace, when I got my Damehood.\n\nThe hat, I went shopping\n\nwith my daughter and my granddaughter,\n\nand my granddaughter picked this hat.\n\nI think she was about...\n\nOh, she was quite little, about four or five.\n\nYou're meant to wear a hat at the Palace, so...\n\nI'll never forget the day.\n\nThey don't let you know that you're gonna be offered one.\n\nAnd I remember the day the letter came,\n\na few months before the ceremony.\n\nAnd it's a very official letter.\n\n[chuckles] I think my first thought was,\n\nOh my God, is it a tax letter, you know?\n\nNot that it should be, 'cause I pay my taxes.\n\nIt was just like, Oh, what's this?\n\nIt's very official.\n\nAnd when I opened it,\n\nit's all in very kind of legalese language.\n\nI thought it was saying that I'd got a CBE,\n\nwhich, you know, I was thrilled about,\n\nI just couldn't believe it.\n\nAt the bottom of the letter it said,\n\nIf you ring this number,\n\nthere'd be somebody you can talk to and ask question.\n\nSo I rang this nice lady\n\nand I said, you know, It's Twiggy here,\n\nI've just got my letter.\n\nAm I right in understanding it's a CBE\n\nthat I'm being offered by the Palace?\n\nAnd she said, No, no, it's a Damehood.\n\nI went, Oh my goodness. [laughs]\n\nShe said, I think you better sit down\n\nand make yourself a nice gin and tea. [laughs]\n\nI mean, I don't like gin, actually,\n\nbut it was given to me by the then Prince Charles,\n\nand now King Charles.\n\nWhen he pinned it on my jacket,\n\nhe said, It's about time you got this,\n\nwhich I thought was very sweet.\n\nAw!\n\nThis is the first poster for our film Twiggy,\n\nwhich is a documentary directed by Sadie Frost on my life.\n\nIt's just been released nationwide.\n\nIt happened because Sadie Frost,\n\nwho's a wonderful actress,\n\nand she's been a model and various things,\n\nand about three years ago,\n\nshe did a beautiful documentary on Mary Quant,\n\nand I do a podcast called Tea with Twiggy,\n\nand her people asked\n\nif she could come on to promote Quant.\n\nSo I said, Brilliant.\n\nShe came on the podcast, got on really well,\n\nand I said to her,\n\nAre you gonna do any other documentaries?\n\nAnd she said, I'd love to do another one.\n\nAnd she said, I loved doing Mary Quant,\n\nbecause I love doing all the stuff from the '60s,\n\nand getting all the archives,\n\nand it's such a great period.\n\nSo I'd like to find somebody\n\nthat worked within the '60s era.\n\nAnd then she said, Oh, I should do you. [chuckles]\n\nSo I kind of said, Oh, okay.\n\nWell, let's talk about it off camera.\n\nSo, the following week, we went out to lunch.\n\nAnd it's worked out brilliantly,\n\nand we had the premier a couple of weeks ago,\n\nand it's gone down a storm.\n\nSo I'm really happy for Sadie, I'm happy for me,\n\nand it's been a very happy experience.\n\nAnd I love that photo.\n\nAgain, that's an old photograph, but it's a nice poster.\n\nMost people have a photo album of their lives,\n\nbut to actually [chuckles] see your life unfold\n\nin front of you on a big screen,\n\nit's very emotional.\n\nYou know, it's interesting looking at these photographs,\n\nbecause I've done lots and lots of different things,\n\nI still continue to do lots of different things,\n\nand I think that's what's kept me\n\nkind of interested in my career,\n\nbecause I didn't stick to just modeling.\n\nBut it was because I met people\n\nwho gave me the chance to do other things.\n\nI think I was so young when I was discovered\n\nthat I was kind of thrown into that spotlight.\n\nI've had an amazing life, amazing career,\n\nI'm not moaning about it. [laughs]\n\nThis is Twiggy, and this has been my Life in Looks,\n\nand it's been amazing to look back.\n\nVery, very happy memories.\n\n[intriguing mellow orchestral music]",

        "content": "During the 2024 awards season, there was no reputable Best Dressed list that doesn’t include Colman Domingo. The actor racked up nominations for his role as the Civil Rights activist Bayard Rustin in Rustin, and dominated red carpets along the way. With his keen eye and fearless sense of style, it only makes sense that Domingo takes on a new role: co-chair of the 2025 Met Gala.\n\nWhat is most appreciated from Domingo, and his stylists Wayman and Micah, is the palpable effort that goes into every look, no matter the occasion. Outside of the marquee awards shows, many male actors are inclined to phone it in, sartorially speaking. But not Domingo. Arguably his best outfit to date, the actor wore an impeccably tailored mustard yellow suit and a textured gold coat from Valentino Haute Couture to the Critics Choice Awards. And even when he does opt for a traditional tuxedo, he makes it his own with unexpected accessorizing. Domingo isn’t afraid to experiment with jewelry, embellishing his suit jackets with brooches, and layering necklaces, rings and bracelets. His most touching piece is a pinky ring that belonged to Bayard Rustin himself.\n\n“True to Colman’s Sagittarius nature he really loves to play and have fun in every facet of his being so his style and sense of fashion fully thrives. We love putting him in tailored fits that highlight his stature, and we love using accessories to innovate and elevate his looks,” Wayman and Micah tell Vogue. Though, they admit, Domingo’s magnetic personality gives every look that extra je ne sais quoi: “To top if all off, Colman's energy, confidence, and charisma always take every red carpet moment to the next level.”\n\nA sensation in the Vogue Slack channels, Domingo has caused a similar stir on social media. “How do you expect me to wear a suit when Colman Domingo walks the earth?!” one person posted on X. “Colman Domingo you have to stop. You smoke too tough. Your swag too different. Your bitch too bad. They’ll kill you,” another wrote. We concur.",

        "content": "Worried you’re not getting enough protein? For years, I didn’t. In fact, I avoided it like the plague. I thought that if I ate too much protein and worked out, I would become bulky—like those muscle men who slam weights around in the gym. It also didn’t help that I grew up in the 2000s, when cereal and granola bars were considered “health food.” Hungry in the middle of the morning? Just have some Special K!\n\nIt’s no wonder I had a bad relationship with food—I ate little more for breakfast than a bowl of fruit. I had cravings all the time, felt exhausted, and experienced mental lapses. And, for the record, my muscles were basically non-existent.\n\nOf course, I’m not alone—many people don’t consume enough protein. In fact, many people do not even include it in the first meal of the day. “For example, in Spain, we eat pan con tomate—bread with tomato—for breakfast and do not add protein,” notes nutrition expert Mariana Sánchez Díaz.\n\nThese days, however, we are getting wise to the fact that getting adequate protein is not just necessary—it is vital for women as we age. It’s also especially important to get it in the morning: Studies show that eating at least 30 grams of protein for breakfast can prevent fatigue and cravings between meals. “Eggs, Greek yogurt, or rich protein sources such as salmon, mackerel, and tuna help control appetite throughout the day while supporting a faster metabolism, reducing inflammation, and improving cognitive function,” explains nutritionist and biologist Anastasiia Kaliga of the holistic wellness app Luvly.\n\nAt the very least, experts say 10% of our daily calories should come from protein. To figure that out in grams, just multiply your weight in pounds by 0.36—the result is the minimum amount of protein in grams you should aim for each day.\n\nSigns you’re not getting enough protein\n\nWhen I finally realized that I wasn’t getting enough protein for my body to function properly, it was because my menstrual cycle became irregular. (Turns out protein is important for hormones, too.)\n\nMissing periods, experts say, is just one sign you may not be getting enough protein. Other symptoms? Swelling in the hands and feet, getting sick frequently, feeling depressed, or having wounds that are slow to heal. Below, nutritionists share a few more signs of not getting enough protein.\n\nFatigue\n\n“In extreme cases, you can be tired and lack energy,” explains nutritionist Mariana Pérez-Trejo Soltwedel. “After all, consuming balanced meals—including protein—is key to keeping the immune system functioning and for regulating your hormones.”",

        "content": "Transcript\n\nHey Vogue, it's Millie Bobby Brown\n\nand this is what's in my bag.\n\n[upbeat music]\n\nI'm gonna guess 12 items, but it's a big bag.\n\nThis is like my work bag so we don't know what's in here.\n\nWe're gonna find out.\n\nI keep my portable fan on me at all times.\n\nI get hot a lot\n\nand I like to be able to just have\n\nthis really natural gust of wind created\n\nby my bedazzled pink fan.\n\nIt's my biggest fan.\n\nI also find that when I'm under lights and studios,\n\nit's really great to be able to have a fan\n\nbecause I get really warm.\n\nSo item one.\n\nNext item, tea.\n\nPG tips, no matter where I go,\n\nalways a cup of tea on hand.\n\nVery English.\n\nI like a builder's brew,\n\nso it's a bit stronger.\n\nI do just a splash of milk, two sugars,\n\nand I leave the tea bag in like a true Brit.\n\nMy snack, dried mango.\n\nI like when it's all stuck together.\n\nI know it sounds weird,\n\nbut like it's like sweeter that way.\n\nI mean it's better than like candy you know.\n\nA bedazzled cup.\n\nI can't, I will not drink out of another cup.\n\nI have this everywhere.\n\nAnd as you can tell, I am Belinda,\n\nbut this I feel like makes me drink more water.\n\nLike, oh, shiny pink.\n\nOkay, I'll drink it.\n\nAll right.\n\nSome might say I am crazy, I don't think so.\n\nThis is a portable diffuser and I put this in my car.\n\nI put it everywhere I go.\n\nI put essential oils in it and water\n\nand then it just makes the room smell really great.\n\nI like to go for peppermint or eucalyptus.\n\nEucalyptus because of like I need energizing\n\na lot of the time.\n\nSo this is where it's at.\n\nIt's not a lot of pink, it's not that much pink.\n\nOkay, it's a lot of pink.\n\nSpeaking of pink, I don't go anywhere\n\nwithout my bedazzled mirror.\n\nOh, this is looking crazy, isn't it?\n\nYeah.\n\nOkay, well, hey,\n\nwhen I wanna just make sure like a contact crisis,\n\nsometimes I need to look in my eye.\n\nThis is great, little touch up mirror.\n\nThis I think has been bedazzled individually.\n\nHowever, this is a lie.\n\nThis is a sheet of bedazzle mint,\n\nwhich is not okay.\n\nThat's hideodious.\n\nAll right, I promise you there is no more pink.\n\nSpot to spot patches.\n\nLove these.\n\nAnd these are acne patches.\n\nI am obsessed with these, they're infused with tea tree oil.\n\nAnd when your girl is getting a pimple,\n\nwhich actually is located about right here,\n\nbut you can't see it right now\n\nbecause of the, maybe you can, I don't know, good makeup.\n\nI have a pimple that I would be treating with this after.\n\nThey're really cute and stylish too.\n\nSo I always keep these in my bag\n\nbecause I'm either using them\n\nor everyone around me is using them.\n\nSo I actually have my scarf that I've been working on.\n\nI have been working on this\n\nfor the majority of the press tour.\n\nAnd what I love about knitting\n\nand I started only like, gosh, six months ago.\n\nHold on, I've gotta find this loop.\n\nIt shows where I was in the time.\n\nSo I started this three weeks ago,\n\nI was at home watching TV.\n\nSo these are pretty clean, these are pretty clean stitches.\n\nAnd then you start getting into like\n\nwhen I was on my 21st birthday.\n\nSo they're becoming a little tighter\n\nbecause I was probably a little like stressed.\n\nSo I make the stitches a little tighter.\n\nAnd then right here is where they get looser\n\nbecause that's when I'm on planes and I'm tired.\n\nSo I start to get a little lazy.\n\nWhat I do is I get my needle\n\nand I go behind the stitch right here.\n\nAnd then I loop with more yarn, I guess, around the needle.\n\nAnd when I do that, I pull it apart like this\n\nand I go under the stitch, pull it over\n\nand pull it onto the next one.\n\nSo I'm creating a new row.\n\nThat's what I'm working on\n\nand I take this everywhere I go with me.\n\nAnd I do it always in hair and makeup\n\ninstead of doom scrolling or all those terrible things.\n\nActually find something else to do with your hands.\n\nAnd that's a great one.\n\nI have the essential oil that I use, this is De Stress.\n\nSo I'm guessing this is, let me just smell it.\n\nYeah, that's eucalyptus, that's for the diffuser.\n\nKind of random.\n\nBut I carry a microchip scanner with me\n\nwhich scans dogs, scans their microchip numbers\n\non their back.\n\nSo when I find stray dogs, stray cats,\n\nI check if they have a microchip.\n\nIf they do, that's great\n\nbecause usually that means they have a home.\n\nIf they don't have one, then I'm able to take them\n\nto the shelter, get them registered,\n\nand then take them to my rescue\n\nwhere I can microchip them, vaccinate them\n\nand get them into our facility\n\nso that we're able to find them a home.\n\nSo these are great.\n\nI don't have one.\n\nLet's see if I do.\n\nI don't have a microchip,\n\nbut I do have a home so it's fine.\n\nI started fostering dogs\n\nand then I had like 20 dogs at a time.\n\nSo I was taking these dogs from different situations\n\nand then I realized, oh, maybe I need to start a rescue.\n\nSo now Joey's Friends Rescue,\n\nall of the dogs basically have come through my house,\n\neither sleep in my bed at some point.\n\nI vaccinate them myself, I microchip them myself.\n\nWe have one right now Mama\n\nwho is gaining way too much weight.\n\nOver 230 dogs I have saved so far.\n\nIt's amazing.\n\nOkay, next.\n\nMy phone.\n\nBoring but true.\n\nMost use app on my phone is Maps.\n\nIs that so sad?\n\nI clearly have no idea where I'm going so.\n\n[Milly laughing]\n\nOkay.\n\nThis is by Florence by Mills.\n\nI actually love, I always keep this in my bag.\n\nCoastal chic hair and body mist, I love this.\n\nI had the coastal chic one for my birthday trip\n\nbecause I was on a beach, so I loved this one.\n\nI put it on my hair, I put it on my body\n\nbecause I didn't really like smelling like sunscreen.\n\n21st birthday was great, I loved it.\n\nI was able to play mermaids with my girlfriends\n\nand we just had like the best silliest time.\n\nWe played hide and seek.\n\nWe were just like having the best time.\n\nI loved it.\n\nTwo things, I'll bring them out at the same time.\n\nMy glasses, I can't see anything.\n\nI always bring an extra pair of contacts with me\n\neverywhere I go because if I have to do a crying scene,\n\nwhich I know that sounds silly,\n\nbut my contacts fall out of my face\n\nwhen I'm doing crying scenes.\n\nAnd then my sunglasses, if there's ever paparazzi\n\nor it's sunny, but mostly because there's paparazzi.\n\nI'm like, eh, I don't wanna talk.\n\nThe only time I've gotten away with it\n\nis like a wig, sunglasses.\n\nBut it has to be like a wig color\n\nthat nobody's ever seen me in like,\n\nbecause the blonde doesn't work.\n\nI've even had black hair, I've had red hair in my movie.\n\nSo I really have to go like pink,\n\nwhich doesn't feel like it draws that much attention.\n\nPoop bags for myself.\n\nI'm just kidding.\n\nFor my dogs, I hate to be that person\n\nthat like if I see someone on the struggle bus,\n\nI'm like, do you need one?\n\nLike I got one for you.\n\nSo try to help the dog community where I can,\n\nthis you need it.\n\nI have 10 personal dogs, Barbie, Molly, Max\n\nand then I have Teddy,\n\nand then I have Dorothy, Jimmy, Agnes, Pookie, Juno\n\nand Rigby.\n\nThose are my 10 dogs.\n\nDid I name Winnie?\n\nSo I have 11.\n\nAfter Jimmy Fallon, she got really big headed\n\nand she asked to be referred to as a human\n\nso now I'm not able to like say her in like the dog list.\n\nShe likes to be, she is a human.\n\nAnd honestly she thinks that Jake's this bad person\n\nin the house.\n\nShe's like, who is this bad person?\n\nLike why is he here?\n\nI'm scared of Winnie, everyone is.\n\nMy pillow spray, my favorite thing ever.\n\nI take it everywhere with me.\n\nI seemingly just cannot go to sleep without a pillow spray.\n\nAnd actually it's really funny because I get into bed\n\nand I spray it on my pillow.\n\nJake's already smiling.\n\nI spray it but like every time without a doubt,\n\nhe goes-\n\n[Millie coughing]\n\nSo dramatically.\n\nAnd I'm like, Are you okay?\n\nAnd I like spray he's like-\n\n[Milly coughing]\n\nYou're trying to kill me with that thing.\n\nI'm like, it's a pillow spray, get a grip.\n\nSo now I think I am like kind of aiming for him\n\nand the pillow when I spray.\n\nJake, do you wanna defend yourself?\n\n[Jake] Well, you spray me in the eyes\n\nevery time you do it.\n\n[bottle sprays]\n\nDo you see that?\n\n[bottle sprays]\n\nIt's a great spray.\n\nIt's not the sprayer, it's the spray.\n\nDon't blame the sprayer, blame the spray.\n\nOkay, what else?\n\n[upbeat music]\n\nIf I could have anyone in my bag, by anyone,\n\nI mean a human, it would be Winnie.\n\nThanks guys, that's everything that's in my bag.\n\nSee you soon.\n\nWaddle, waddle, waddle, waddle, waddle, waddle.\n\n[upbeat music]",

        "content": "Transcript\n\nHello, Vogue.\n\nI'm Cate Blanchett, and this is My Life in Looks.\n\n[upbeat jazzy music]\n\nI'm a little nervous, but je ne regrette rien, right?\n\nOh, my giddy aunt.\n\nI think I'm wearing my mother's sweater,\n\nand it looks like my school shirt.\n\nI'm probably also wearing the underpants\n\nthat my mother made me.\n\nUntil about 10 years ago,\n\nI still had the underpants that my mother sewed.\n\nClearly not wearing any makeup.\n\nGod bless me, I look like I'm 12,\n\nbut this was at the Sydney Theater Critics Awards,\n\nand I won Best Newcomer.\n\nI was in a production of Oleanna,\n\nand then I loved it so much, I ran the company.\n\nI think I might've come straight from rehearsals.\n\nClearly, I didn't realize\n\nI was gonna be photographed or win.\n\nNext.\n\nOh, look, this is the very first time I went\n\nto the Academy Awards.\n\nI had done a shoot in Australia,\n\nand I'd fallen in love with this dress\n\nthat John Galliano had designed that was knitted,\n\nwhite knitted, and was embellished\n\nwith all of this amazing embroidery,\n\nand I met him in London\n\nand he said that he would design something for me,\n\nand he said, Let's change the color.\n\nAnd he sat down, it was like being on the couch,\n\nand he asked about my family and my marriage,\n\nand then he embellished, I think you can just see it\n\nat the bottom there, there's a little hummingbird,\n\nand there's two hummingbirds on the dress,\n\nand one was me, and one was my husband Andrew.\n\nso there's kind of a real beautiful story.\n\nI gave it to amfAR,\n\nso now someone else is wearing it, sadly. [laughs]\n\nBut anyway, I love that dress so much.\n\nOh, an A for effort.\n\nThis is me at the BAFTAs. I played Queen Elizabeth I.\n\nWhen we made the film, we actually thought,\n\nwe'll have to take the first off there,\n\nbecause maybe an audience would think\n\nthere was a sequel coming, that it was Elizabeth Part One,\n\nbut it was Elizabeth I, and I'm glad I'm wearing a slip.\n\nI mean, you just take the slip off,\n\nI guess you could wear that today.\n\nAm I an early adopter of that?\n\nNo, or am I holding something? I have got my glasses on.\n\nOh, this was a dress that Jean Paul Gaultier designed.\n\nMy father-in-law, who's no longer with us,\n\ncalled it an exit dress.\n\nHe said people don't think much when you come into the room,\n\nbut when you leave, they go, wow.\n\nThere was obviously a lot of jewelry Jean Paul Guttier\n\nhad put on the dress, but Cynthia Bach then provided\n\nall of the amazing pieces.\n\nI was playing a psychic in Savannah\n\nin a small film called The Gift with Sam Raimi,\n\nand I had never been to a psychic,\n\nand I got her to do a reading for me,\n\nand she made some predictions, wild predictions.\n\nI'd play a writer who had short hair\n\nwho died for what she believed in, Guavin Guevin.\n\nI played Veronica Guerin,\n\nand she said that I would wear a dress\n\nthat was gonna change my career, and then I wore that.\n\nI don't know if it's changed my career,\n\nbut I'm very pleased I wore it.\n\nOh, bless.\n\nNow, that is my own hair,\n\nand that's just me on a Sunday morning in the pond.\n\nNext, in a little-known film called Lord of the Rings,\n\nplaying Galadriel.\n\nI did have someone I deeply respect say to me,\n\nLook, they're making this weird film in New Zealand,\n\nand they want you to play an elf for three weeks.\n\nYou don't wanna do that, do you?\n\nYeah, I did.\n\nAfter the film was over, my husband,\n\nhe's fallen out of the habit,\n\nhe sort of does it to the children now,\n\nbut he used to drag me around by my ears.\n\nIt was playful, and so I told the guys at Weta\n\nwho did all of the prosthetics this,\n\nand they gave me, it was kind of creepy,\n\na chocolate box full of ear tips\n\nthat they'd made to look like chocolates,\n\nand then they bronzed my ears\n\nso I could give 'em to my husband.\n\nThat is me on the set of The Aviator,\n\nwhich Martin Scorsese directed.\n\nI think it's between takes.\n\nI was playing Catherine Hepburn.\n\nOne of the more daunting things I've ever done,\n\nbut when Scorsese asks you to do anything,\n\nI'd be a tree for him.\n\nThat was the first time I worked with the great Sandy Powell\n\non the costumes, and my relationship with costume designers,\n\nI've realized over time,\n\nis really pivotal to creating a character,\n\nand obviously, even before you utter a word,\n\nan audience is gonna start reading your character\n\nby what they wear and how they wear it,\n\nand something that Marty did,\n\nhe liberated me from having to do any imitation of Hepburn.\n\nHe played a lot of those early screwball comedies she did,\n\nand Bringing Up Baby was one of them, so I watched that.\n\nCatherine Hepburn is so raked thin,\n\nand then you don't plan for these things,\n\nand then the film got nominated, and I did,\n\nand so I had to do a lot of red carpets pregnant,\n\nand Donna Karan made me this amazing stretchy dress\n\nthat really celebrated the fact I was pregnant.\n\n[gasps] Oh, this is back in 2006 for Vogue.\n\nIt's a very memorable shoot.\n\nTonne Goodman styled it, and Steven Klein shot it.\n\nThe clothes were insane.\n\nI mean, this one was another Galliano.\n\nThe pose was really difficult to hold,\n\nand I learned so much about making a picture working\n\nwith Steven Klein and Tonne on this shoot.\n\nNext.\n\n[gasps] Oh, this was the first time I went to the Met Ball,\n\nand I went with Nicolas Ghesquiere\n\nwhen he was at Balenciaga.\n\nSo we just shot with Irving Penn that day,\n\nand Nicolas had done his take on an Elizabethian garment,\n\nand then we went straight from there,\n\nwe had to do a quick 360 and then show up to the Met Ball.\n\nThe theme was Poiret: King of Fashion.\n\nI mean, I just went to the exhibition\n\nand could have stayed there.\n\nIt's always so great.\n\nI mean, the room is really vibrant, of course,\n\nbut it's always important to remember the exhibition\n\nand the reason why you're there.\n\nOkay, next one. [gasps] There we go.\n\nHere is the photograph that Irving Penn took,\n\nand this was in Penn's studio.\n\nThe taking of the picture was incredibly quick,\n\nbut the sitting and preparing,\n\nit's like I've had the great fortune\n\nof being photographed by Penn and by Avedon.\n\nIt's all about their regard\n\nand knowing when to press the shadow,\n\nand so to be beheld by him was just unforgettable.\n\nThis was the second time I played Queen Elizabeth\n\nin Elizabeth: Golden Age.'\n\nThe costumes were designed by Alexandra Byrne.\n\nI mean, she referenced a lot of haute couture,\n\nand there were a lot of Balenciaga references,\n\nand she made one dress that was so enormous,\n\nI couldn't fit through the doorway of the cathedral\n\nthat we were shooting in. [laughs]\n\nHello, Bob.\n\nI've worked with the great Todd Haynes a couple of times,\n\nand I hope I get to do it a couple of times more.\n\nHe's so fantastic to work with.\n\nI had literally walked off the set\n\nof playing Queen Elizabeth\n\nin Queen Elizabeth: The Golden Age on a Friday, wrapped,\n\nand then had to be on set playing Bob Dylan\n\nin Montreal on Monday.\n\nTodd had divided Bob's persona, Bob, like I know him,\n\nDylan's persona into many different characters,\n\nand the late, great Heath Ledger was one of them,\n\nand Christian Bale. and I played this electric silhouette.\n\nI think he wanted a woman inside this period\n\nof Dylan's musical career.\n\nIt meant that there was a separation between\n\nhow iconic this period and this look of Dylan's was\n\nand the character playing,\n\n'cause you know there's a woman inside that,\n\nbut it was so liberating.\n\nI had fantastic eyebrows and sideburns.\n\nWas that the only time my husband hasn't wanted to kiss me?\n\nOh, this is from Carol, a Todd Haynes film.\n\nI played alongside the wonderful Rooney Mara,\n\nand that coat was a nightmare.\n\nSandy Powell did the costumes again, and once again,\n\nI mean, she can do an enormous,\n\nwe worked together on Cinderella with unbelievable costumes\n\nwith a much bigger budget,\n\nand then we had $2.50 to pull this one together,\n\nand she had two coats, and one was great and stable,\n\nand this one was like a little fragile creature\n\nthat kept falling apart, and I said,\n\nI'm really sorry, Sandy. I think it's that one.\n\nAnd she goes, I know, I knew you were gonna say that.\n\nSo Sandy, the great Sandy Powell,\n\nwas literally behind the car in between every take,\n\n'cause we had to get out, and it was really windy,\n\nand the coat would come apart,\n\nand so she was there in between takes sewing it up.\n\nI felt a responsibility for this for sure,\n\nbecause films like this, up to this point,\n\nweren't really made and certainly not made\n\nin the mainstream, and really,\n\nif anyone comes up to me in the supermarket,\n\nthis is the film that they talk about,\n\nand so it was really, really important to a lot of people.\n\n[gasps] Oh, this is Sarah Burton when she was at McQueen,\n\nand it was the most exquisite piece of embroidery.\n\nThe bottom, you can't really see there,\n\nbut it was all feathers.\n\nso I love that dress so much that then, during COVID,\n\nI presided over the jury in Venice, and there was no time.\n\nAll the ateliers were closed, so I said,\n\nCould I borrow that piece of embroidery again?\n\nAnd then I had a pair of pants and wore it,\n\nbecause I thought, when you have something\n\nso beautiful like that, it's a crime to wear it once.\n\nIt's even more beautiful in person.\n\nThe year I was nominated for Blue Jasmine\n\nat the Golden Globes,\n\nMr. Armani had designed this beautiful preve dress.\n\nIt was an impossible gown,\n\nand you didn't really see the back,\n\nbecause it goes right down to this plunging base.\n\nThe back is bare, and this beautiful lace,\n\nwhich has become quite signature,\n\nI was at on the jury in Cannes,\n\nand I wore it to the opening night,\n\nand I remember people saying to my publicist, [laughs]\n\nOkay, Kate's wearing the-\n\nShe's worn that dress before, as if I didn't know.\n\nOh, really?\n\nAnd I was so pleased to wear it again\n\nbecause I'd loved it so much.\n\n[gasps] Sarah Burton, there she is in Cannes.\n\nSarah made this beautiful, it was like a tuxedo,\n\nbut it was a dress, and had this massive bow on the back,\n\nand it was actually shown on the runway as a jacket,\n\nand she said, why don't I try and turn it into a dress?\n\nAnd so I love that, and I wore that again\n\nto Sarah's final show for McQueen.\n\nHere we are back at the Venice Film Festival,\n\nand this is a Schiaparelli flummery\n\nwhich I'd seen on the runway and absolutely loved\n\nand managed not to poke myself in the eye with it.\n\nThis was an example on Tar\n\nof the character coming to life, really.\n\nThe script by Todd Field was just,\n\nhe didn't change a syllable,\n\nit was so exquisitely wrought and written.\n\nIt was like, how do you make a female conductor look,\n\nsomeone who was in incredibly powerful\n\nand very, very aware of her presence?\n\nAnd so we went for this,\n\nI guess what has been termed quiet luxury look,\n\nreally great tailoring.\n\nI've had a couple of experiences in my life\n\nwhere I've just been so in sync with a director\n\nand a script, and you're lucky if you have one\n\nof those experiences in your life,\n\nbut I've had a handful of them, and I'm so grateful,\n\nand Tar was definitely one of them.\n\nMusic has come back into my life in a really major way,\n\nand that's because of this experience.\n\nHere we are. This is Armani Prive.\n\nThis is the dress that just keeps on giving,\n\nThat was from the current Prive collection, and I said,\n\nLook, I know there's this leftover lace from the dress\n\nthat I'd worn to the Globes all those years before,\n\nand they found an offcut,\n\nand so they made the internal corset out of that offcut.\n\nIt's felt great, and I've since worn it again\n\nwith the actual piece that goes underneath it,\n\nand I wanted to wear it with a T-shirt,\n\nbut Mr. Armani wouldn't let me.\n\nYou gotta respect the maestro, right?\n\n[gasps] Oh, hey. Well this is an oldie but a goodie.\n\nWith my first paycheck as an actor,\n\nI bought an Armani suit, and this is it,\n\nand I wear it wherever I can,\n\nand I think we were there in Milan for a Prive show.\n\nOkay.\n\nOh, well, this is at Cannes,\n\nand this is the incomparable Nicolas Ghesquiere.\n\nIt's a particular type of beading,\n\nso the dress is incredibly heavy,\n\nbut such is his mastery that he makes it look so light,\n\nand the shoulders are really big.\n\nIn the hands of someone else, could look really solid,\n\nbut then he's got that beautiful drape,\n\nbut yeah, I can't wait to wear this one again.\n\nIt's beautiful.\n\nThis is Brandon Maxwell.\n\nI'm going to Good Morning America.\n\nLooking so good. Did my own hair and makeup, right?\n\nHave that time in the morning.\n\nI love a Canadian tuxedo, double denim, triple denim,\n\nand this wasn't actually denim, it was more like a velvet,\n\nso it was really comfy and cozy.\n\nOh, once again, this is also for Borderlands,\n\nand I'm obsessed with this Swedish designer.\n\nShe's taken sustainable dressing to a whole new level\n\nand seamed this piece that was a dress all done in spoons.\n\nUnderneath this is kind of a cotton netting\n\ninto which she put the spoons on when you get dressed\n\nand it's backless, and then she put some spoons\n\nonto sort of a suit that I wore\n\nfor the Disclaimer premiere in Toronto for the festival.\n\nI mean, it was a crazy bonkers COVID film that I made.\n\nI really love the films of Jodorowsky,\n\nand there was one film of his\n\nwhere they were all in the desert,\n\nand the character has these incredible fingerless gloves.\n\nI thought it'd be good to have something on your hand\n\nin a close-up.\n\n[gasp] Oh, this is the 2024 Rumours premiere\n\nat the New York Film Festival,\n\nand I'd seen this, and I just thought it was hilarious.\n\nIt's Fiorucci, I think.\n\nI wear those leather pants every Wednesday.\n\nMy favorite pair of leather pants.\n\nYeah, it's a bit my Cousin Itt look.\n\nNot breathable, and don't go near me with a naked flame.\n\nThis is the thing,\n\nwhen you think about re-wearing something, you think,\n\nhow could I wear it?\n\nIt would kind of be cool as a skirt.\n\nBlack Bag.\n\nWorking again with Steven Soderbergh,\n\none of the most stylish filmmakers around,\n\nand Alan Mirojnick, who is one\n\nof the greatest costume designers, and I play a spy,\n\nand the only thing Steven said to me is, I want big hair.\n\nIt's a great film, and really fantastic cast.\n\n[upbeat jazzy music] [pen scratching]\n\nThanks, Vogue. That wasn't so painful after all.\n\n[upbeat jazzy music continues]",

        "content": "Transcript\n\nI can't be a Bon Jovi without good Italian food.\n\n[gentle elegant music]\n\nHi, everyone, it's Millie Bobby Brown\n\nand I am with Vogue today\n\nto serve not only a look, but actually a meal.\n\nI'm wearing a Dolce Archive.\n\nWho? Me.\n\nYeah, the ingredients for my paella are one pepper,\n\none onion, some garlic, chorizo, cubed chicken,\n\ncanned tomatoes, Arborio rice, saffron, and chicken stock.\n\nAnd then some spices, paprika, chili flakes,\n\ndepending on how spicy you like it.\n\nFirst, I thank the culinary gods.\n\nI say, Millie, you are gonna do\n\na great job today no matter what,\n\ndon't pressure on yourself.\n\nI'm gonna start off by dicing [giggles] some garlic.\n\nMy dad's a really good cook.\n\nMy mom doesn't really cook and my mom is here.\n\nShe's probably gonna be saying,\n\nI make a really good spaghetti bolognese.\n\nBut Mom, that's the only thing that you cook.\n\nDad has various different ingredients\n\nand he can just whip something up that makes total sense,\n\nbut you'd never think you'd put together.\n\nSo I learned probably from my dad.\n\nWe're gonna take this ring off.\n\nIt's all getting really serious.\n\nChop, chop, chop away. Get it really small.\n\nI hate the way when you chop garlic and you smell your...\n\nOoh, like I can't stand it.\n\nSo usually this is Jake's job. That feels about right.\n\nMy least favorite part of cooking.\n\nSometimes I cry, sometimes just I'm really hardcore.\n\nLet's see what happens today.\n\nBut let's really hope not\n\n'cause I've got a really strong eye look going on\n\nand I know people on here are gonna say,\n\nWhat are you doing cutting an onion like that?\n\nAnd I'm gonna say, I don't know what I'm doing,\n\nso I'm just gonna go in chop away.\n\nGuys, if you're ever wanting something\n\nto get just a tiny bit smaller\n\nand you're cooking, do my trick.\n\nOh, God. Do my trick.\n\nYou just...\n\n[knife chops]\n\nIt's such a great trick.\n\nIn my house, I put a big bowl on the table\n\nand I put all the leftovers and feed it to my chickens.\n\nThey love it.\n\nI have five hens. They are great.\n\nThey're all named off to the Spice Girls,\n\nwhich I heard Chappell Roan has chickens that are named\n\nafter the Spice Girls,\n\nwhich for me just feels like a segue\n\ninto a really close friendship.\n\nMy chickens, I had from babies, I raised them.\n\nI was actually told they were gonna die\n\nand then all of them survived.\n\nSo it's the power of love in Chappell Roan, I guess.\n\nChappell, if you're watching this,\n\nknow that our chickens could get along.\n\nPosh would like to meet Posh 2.0.\n\nOkay, I'm in a pretty good place\n\nwhere the onion is really diced.\n\nMy pepper, right down. Cut the head off.\n\nTake the inside. This is the part my chickens love the most.\n\nAlways save that part.\n\nI was full when I left Spain,\n\nso it's always been a part of my life.\n\nMy first memory ever,\n\nI had like a toy car that I would drive.\n\nIt was like a very small, you know, baby toy car.\n\nWe lived on a hill and in Spain, my dad can confirm\n\nor deny this, but I lost control\n\nand I was going down the hill and my dad was chasing\n\nafter me and like, I think that was my first memory.\n\nI was like a really clumsy kid.\n\nSo I would fall a lot, chip my teeth, slip my head open.\n\nYou know, it's all added to the creativity of\n\nwho I am today though,\n\nIt's all made me smarter.\n\nAt least that's what my mom tells me.\n\nSo I'm like actually getting shit done.\n\nWhereas usually I am on the phone\n\nwith my girlfriends dying laughing at some TikTok.\n\nAre we done with that? [sighs] Oh, my God, the chorizo.\n\nOkay, I hate, hate, hate cooking meat.\n\nLike it's my least favorite part of any cooking experience.\n\nAgain, leave that to my husband.\n\nBut here we are today,\n\nMillie has to overcome her fears.\n\nFYI, I don't usually do this,\n\nso I'm gonna cut that like that\n\nand then I'm just gonna open it like that.\n\nUgh, that feels right to me.\n\nNow it's just looking weird. Let's chop it up.\n\n[knife chops]\n\nActually the smell is so delicious.\n\nI do slice it 'cause I don't like...\n\nMy dad also is the same.\n\nWe don't like it to be too big\n\nand I usually just pile them on top just\n\nto make it go faster.\n\nSo we're now at a place where we have our diced veggies.\n\nWe have that, that thing.\n\nAnd we're going to use the stove now. Let's do it.\n\nLet's make magic happen. Voila.\n\nNow we have my stove.\n\nSo what I like to do is I like to start off\n\nby turning it on, medium heat, put some oil in.\n\nI will put my onions in, put my garlic in,\n\nand I'm gonna throw my saffron in the chicken stock\n\nto bloom it while I'm cooking.\n\nNow I'm going to add some salt.\n\nFor me, I loved baking in COVID\n\nand until I smell like it's walking,\n\nthen I kind of, that incentivizes me to keep going.\n\nIt starts to smell bad. That's when we put a roadblock.\n\nI'm very much just like go with the flow, just keep tasting\n\nas I go along and see if it needs more of anything.\n\nI'm gonna let this caramelized.\n\nAnytime anyone wants to kind of go out for dinner,\n\nI'm always like, Come over, and it feels more intimate.\n\nAnd it actually, I feel like my love for food is like a way\n\nof saying like, Thank you for coming over.\n\nSo now I'm just gonna throw in the red pepper.\n\nI'm gonna start with my least favorite part,\n\nwhich is cooking the meat.\n\nI have a very bad irrational fear\n\naround raw chicken and some might say,\n\nMillie, go be a vegetarian.\n\nAnd I'm gonna say to that, Yeah, I was a vegetarian\n\nfor a really long time, but I found out my body needs meat.\n\nEverybody's different.\n\nAnd that's what was happening with me.\n\nWe have olive oil, we have the chicken.\n\n[chicken sizzling]\n\nOnce it's cooked, I usually leave it in the bowl.\n\nI don't eat it. That's Jake always\n\nwhen we're like cleaning up after he goes,\n\nYou haven't even touched it.\n\nSo why do we put it in there?\n\nAnd I'm like, I know, I do this every time.\n\nBut it's for the enjoyment of my other guests.\n\nI want everybody else to enjoy the chicken,\n\nI just seemingly can't.\n\nWe're gonna add some salt and pepper.\n\nThis is my paprika.\n\nI'm gonna put a little bit in now to give some\n\nof the veggies some flavor.\n\nI mean, I was on Hell's Kitchen.\n\nYeah, that's right. I was the idiot sandwich.\n\nNo, I was a guest on there when I was like nine.\n\nI love Gordon. I love his whole family.\n\nOh, but Stanley Tucci's a good chef,\n\nbut I've never tried his food.\n\nSo invite me over, Stanley.\n\nAll right, something's happening.\n\nIt's definitely turning a different color.\n\nNext, we're going to add in that chorizo.\n\nSo here we go.\n\n[chorizo sizzling]\n\nI'm just gonna put in like not all of it.\n\nAnd I really like the chorizo really crispy.\n\nSo this is the part where I take the most time\n\nand make sure that it's like really crispy and delicious.\n\nNext, I'm gonna put in [giggles] my canned tomatoes.\n\nI'm just gonna pop this in.\n\nAnd this actually helps soften the vegetables.\n\nI just like to kind of mix this around, get it moving. Yum.\n\nJust wait, have faith in me. It's looking good.\n\nIt looks where it needs to be for me.\n\nIf you put it in the rice fast,\n\nit picks up all the flavors of the oils.\n\n[eye tinkles]\n\nWoo-hoo.\n\nI'm just gonna mix this together\n\nand I'm gonna add in chicken stock.\n\nSo I again like to do this kind of the same thing\n\nwith the paprika but do it intermittently\n\nbecause the rice really soaks up fast.\n\nAnd then you have to keep trying\n\nand make sure the rice is actually cooking\n\nand then you add more.\n\nI kind of play it by ear at this point.\n\nAnd you let the rice do the talking.\n\nNow I'm gonna put in the peas,\n\nI'm gonna put in the blooming saffron\n\nand I'm gonna put in the rest of my paprika.\n\nChef's kiss.\n\nLid is gonna go on top of this while this is cooking.\n\nAnd I'm going to keep looking at this in disappointment.\n\nThe wedding food process, I didn't do a tasting,\n\nI didn't do anything.\n\nOur caterer was Galateo, the most like renowned,\n\nbeautiful catering company in, honestly Europe.\n\nSo I was like, You got this.\n\nAnd to this day, guests at my wedding say,\n\nThere was a pasta dish that was like so amazing.\n\nWhat I really wanted the takeaway to be was\n\nthat the food was the best food\n\nthey've ever had at a wedding.\n\nAnd I am taking, taking that very proudly.\n\nI very much am not a trad wife, but I do love cooking\n\nand I love married life.\n\nI love cooking with my husband. Jake also loves the farm.\n\nHe also loves cooking like we're a trad couple,\n\nbut like a trendy trendy trad couple.\n\nSo now I'm going to pop the chicken in to the paella.\n\nProbably needs another like, honestly 15 minutes,\n\nbut we'll check like intermittently.\n\nSo what I would usually do at home is I would then go\n\nand let the dogs out, put my life jacket\n\non my English bulldog 'cause she really likes the pool,\n\nbut she doesn't realize that she can't swim.\n\nAll right, I'm gonna make you a drink. Let's do it.\n\nSo now I'm gonna show you my favorite drink,\n\nwhich is a Shirley Temple.\n\nI grew up in the industry always going to like fancy dinners\n\nand meeting fancy people.\n\nAnd to feel fancy myself, I would order a Shirley Temple.\n\nAnd now growing up and being 21,\n\nmy preference is always gonna be a Shirley Temple.\n\nI need a cold drink.\n\nLet's find like a really nice one to sit on top of that.\n\nYeah, that's what we wanna see.\n\nOkay, then I'm gonna do a splash.\n\nI like to do a squeeze of lime\n\nand then I like to fill it all the way up.\n\nOkay, I like to pop that in there.\n\nOne for me, one for the drink,\n\nand then I'm gonna use the back\n\nof a spoon just to get that grenadine.\n\nDoesn't that look so good? And guess what this doesn't do.\n\nLeave you questioning everything you did the night before.\n\nAlways choose Shirley. This is like the best drink ever.\n\nSo I'm very happy with this. Let's check the paella.\n\n[food sizzling]\n\nOh my gosh, it looks amazing.\n\nI'm gonna do a little taste test\n\nwith the same Shirley Temple spoon, just gonna...\n\nMy dad would like it, however, Jake wouldn't.\n\nSo I'm gonna pour some more of this on\n\nbecause the rice is still too hard.\n\nAnd then I'm just going to bring all\n\nof the sides into the middle.\n\nThis might be my segue into my cooking career.\n\nWe don't know, like I could be the next Stanley Tucci.\n\nWe're gonna let that do its thing again.\n\nAnd it's also gonna get crispy on the bottom,\n\nwhich is my favorite part of any paella.\n\nTas tas.\n\n[bell dings] Checking.\n\nThat's ready.

        "content": "Say what you will, but soy is an impressively versatile vegetable. From tofu to tempeh to edamame to soy milk, the legume forms the basis for a range of foods—and it’s packed-with protein, healthy fats, fiber, and vitamins and minerals, too. It’s no wonder, then, that more and more people are giving soy a second look—regardless of whether they follow a plant-based diet or not.\n\nBut there’s one soy product that you might not know about: textured soy protein, also known as textured vegetable protein or TVP. “Although years ago it was a product intended only for vegetarians, now many people who want to improve their diets or reduce their meat consumption are incorporating it into their diet regularly,” notes nutritionist Laura Parada, who adds that it’s also extremely versatile and easy to cook.\n\nA high-protein meat alternative\n\nTextured soy protein may seem processed, but it’s actually pretty natural—it’s just the soy flour that’s leftover during the process of extracting soybean oil. “It does not contain any chemical additives or coloring,” says Parada. “Furthermore, its taste and smell are practically neutral.”\n\nMuch like tofu, textured soy protein acquires the flavor of whatever you cook it with. Unlike tofu, however, its texture is more akin to meat—which is why it’s often a main ingredient in many meat alternatives like faux chicken nuggets or meat-free burgers. “It is very similar in texture and can be formed into different shapes—crumbles, fillets, strips, and patties,” says Parada, who notes that since it’s often sold in its dehydrated form it’s an excellent item to keep on-hand in the pantry.\n\nIt’s also high in nutritional value: “Textured soy protein offers a high content of high quality protein with less fat than animal products,” says Parada. “Each cup of dehydrated soy protein provides approximately 48 g of protein and 300 calories, making it a light and highly satiating option.”\n\nThe nutritional benefits of textured soy protein\n\nAlthough its high protein content is reason enough to add it to your dietary rotation, textured soy also provides a healthy dose of essential vitamins and minerals, including “calcium, iron, potassium, phosphorus, and B vitamins,” says Parada. “It is also rich in lecithin, a substance that assists the absorbtion of vitamins in the body.”",

        "source": "https://www.vogue.com/",
        "content": "If anyone can increase the volume of noise around wool right now, it’s Lantink. Ever since establishing his brand in 2016, his work has turned heads: His 2018 vagina pants for Janelle Monáe’s “Pynk” music video served notice of his arrival, while his runway shows following the label’s 2023 Paris debut have established him as an unrepentant rewriter of the rules of conventional fashion form. Inevitably, he has been strongly linked with creative director roles beyond his fledgling brand.\n\n“For me Duran makes us feel excited about the future,” said Donatella Versace just after presenting the prize. She added: “This was a very strong year for The Woolmark Prize. It was very difficult to choose, but he was a clear winner.”\n\nThat last statement of Versace’s might sound like a contradiction, however it didn’t seem like it on the ground. This year Vogue was invited to sit in during the 10 minute presentations that the eight finalists are afforded to show their designs and share their creative credos. This was an experience that left you grateful not to be a judge, because while Lantink was indubitably the worthy-winner Versace described, his competition made coming to that decision just as conflictingly difficult as she hinted.\n\nEvery designer had used the AU$60,000 grant supplied by Woolmark to create collections that were both compellingly different and consistently appealing. Luca Lin of Act No. 1’s “classical garments made with freedom” represented an innovative vision of tailoring and outerwear that reflected his own identity and political ethos. Rachel Scott of Diotima declared: “Tensions are what I’m interested in; in materiality, in silhouettes, and in styling.” That interest was articulated in a collection that worked to render authentic a fashion-articulated image of her Jamaican homeland, and also present unfamiliar collisions of material and form, which included a highly impressive “leather jacket with fur collar” made in boiled compacted merino with collar-frothing yarn.\n\n“Whether you are pregnant or want to do Ozempic, everything is possible at Ester Manas,” said Ester Manas during her presentation with life and business partner Balthazar Delepierre. Their dramatically elastic—and therefore unusually inclusive—approach to sizing, as well as the freshness of their philosophy and the wittiness of their rapport made their presentation a standout.",

        "content": "If you haven’t already visited the “Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion” exhibition at the Costume Institute, now might be a good time. Soon, a new piece will join the 200-plus garment exhibition (on display until September 2, 2024), and it’s a special one. Anna Wintour’s custom 2024 Met Gala look designed by Jonathan Anderson for Loewe will be installed across from the 1889 cape by Charles Frederick Worth that inspired it.\n\n“It was a privilege to work on this look for Anna for the Met Gala and to find the synergies between what we are doing presently at Loewe and the incredible craft of the sleeping beauties in the Costume Institute archives,” said Anderson. “It’s an honor to have one of my designs now live alongside Charles Frederick Worth’s cape in his Tulipes Hollandaises textile that inspired the piece.”\n\nThe installation of the custom look designed by Jonathan Anderson for Loewe at the Costume Institute\n\nOne of the major through lines of the exhibition is the reinterpretation of historical garments from the archives. Andrew Bolton, curator in charge of the Costume Institute, explained the importance of the modern-day pieces living alongside the historical ones. “‘Sleeping Beauties’ endeavors to reawaken garments in the Costume Institute’s collection by reactivating their sensory qualities,” Bolton said. “The show unfolds as a series of case studies united by the theme of nature. Like fashion, nature depends on the widest sensory engagements for its fullest sensorial expressions. The comparison, however, does not end with the senses. In many ways, nature serves as the ultimate metaphor for fashion—its rebirth, renewal, and cyclicity, as well as its transience, ephemerality, and evanescence. The former qualities are reflected in the exhibition through the many garments that have been influenced by earlier styles.”\n\nOther side-by-side comparisons include an Alessandro Michele Gucci cape with clouds and sunbursts and an 1880s ball gown by Charles Frederick Worth, Dries Van Noten’s ensembles influenced by Worth’s Tulipes Hollandaises evening cloak, and Maria Grazia Chiuri’s New Junon evening dress inspired by Monsieur Dior’s original Junon gown.",

        "content": "What is A$AP Rocky going to do when Matthieu Blazy leaves Bottega Veneta?\n\nIn what is quite possibly Rocky’s Bottega swan song, the rapper has been spotted carrying some truly outrageous bags. Rocky, who has been spending time in the recording studio, has been trotting out an enviable bag collection, from a large white Andiamo to a truly enormous orange tote.\n\nThe famous dresser is a noted Bottega collector: Just days after sitting front row at the Bottega Veneta spring 2025 show, A$AP Rocky celebrated his birthday carrying a sneaky status bag. While it looked like any other plastic bag, it was really a fresh-off-the-runway leather trompe l’œil, straight from Milan—and the latest addition to his inimitable closet. Last year, the rapper celebrated his 35th birthday carrying a Pepto Bismol-hued Bottega Veneta Andiamo bag, made in the brand’s signature woven leather. (Rocky, who participated in a guerilla marketing campaign for Bottega, carried several of the brand’s telltale intrecciato bags over the course of his contract.)\n\nThe rapper has proven time and time again that he isn’t concerned with mens’ fashion norms when it comes to his personal style. Between his babushka scarf and leather skirt, A$ASP Rocky knows that gender norms are so passé. But nothing broadcasts his disinterest in gendered fashion more than his impressive purse collection, which he’s cultivated over the course of his career.\n\nBut his collection ranges far beyond Bottega. In August 2023, just after the birth of his second son Riot Rose, Rocky was spotted walking to his conspicuous yellow Hummer, dressed for a workout in a black J6 hoodie, Puma shorts, and black-and-green sneakers with white socks, carried a toting an open black Hermès Kelly with gold hardware. Between the open bag, contents on full display, and the little coffee cup he kept chugging from, the new father of two was giving a touch of Frazzled Englishwoman energy.\n\nWhile Rocky already had an impressive bag collection on his own, now that he’s one half of the world’s most fashionable couple, he has two closets to pull from. On a date night with Rihanna at Carbone, he paired a sky blue Goyard Saint Louis with his simple white tee, jeans, flannel, and puffer. The rapper is clearly a fan of Goyard: he’s also been spotted carrying a marigold yellow clutch, an orange tote, and blue satchel with a rose painted on the leather. And at the spring 2020 Gucci show in Milan, he wore a leather purse by the Italian house slung across his chest.",

The actor appeared at CinemaCon 2025 in Las Vegas yesterday (April 1), wearing a look from the Wiederhoeft spring 2025 ready-to-wear collection. The pale, gunmetal silver corset bodice features visible boning and a tight, nipped-in waist, paired with a silk satin, ankle-length skirt as it was on the runway. A Y2K-esque, chunky silver buckle belt sits low on the hips to tie it all together. Sweeney, styled by Molly Dickson, also wore silver pumps. Her glam diverged from what we saw on the Wiederhoeft runway in New York to create a more soft, romantic look; she wore her long blonde hair loose and flowing, with bright pink blush on the apples of her cheeks, and her manicure completely on-trend and naked. While Wiederhoeft revels in the post-modern bride, this look feels rebellious yet refined.",

        "source": "https://www.vogue.com/",
        "content": "The exhibition will be arranged by 12 characteristics of Black dandyism, an organizational principle informed by a 1934 Zora Neale Hurston essay, “The Characteristics of Negro Expression.” The sections will tell the story of the Black dandy’s evolution over time via not just garments and accessories, but a range of media that includes drawings, paintings, photographs, and film excerpts. The first—Ownership—showcases an enslaved person’s livery from 19th century Maryland. Jook, which was one of Hurston’s original categories and was concerned with music, dancing and pleasure, includes a pair of Zoot suits from the 1940s; while Cosmopolitanism features pieces designed by both Pharrell Williams and the late Virgil Abloh for Louis Vuitton men’s.\n\n“The contemporary designers that are in the show are there because many of them talk about and use the history that we’re recounting as part of their design philosophies,” Miller pointed out. In some cases they also have heritage in West Africa or the Caribbean. “It’s been really interesting to see the show notes of Virgil Abloh and Grace Wales Bonner—they’re really well versed in the kinds of issues that we’re talking about in the exhibition, [issues] that are related to race and power, that are related to immigration, slavery, colonies and colonization, empowerment, joy, aesthetics.”\n\nBolton, for his part, believes menswear is in the midst of a renaissance. “That’s thanks not just to Black designers but also to men of style, like the male co-chairs for our Met Gala.” This year the co-chairs are Pharrell Williams, actor Colman Domingo, Formula One driver Lewis Hamilton, musician A$AP Rocky, and Anna Wintour, with basketball star Lebron James acting as honorary co-chair. “They’re all men who aren’t afraid to take risks with their self-presentation. They take advantage of classic forms, but they also remix them and break them down in really new ways,” Bolton said. “I think Black men and Black designers are very much at the forefront of this new renaissance in menswear.”\n\nAs in previous years, the exhibition will gather a group of influential collaborators, each of whom are providing distinct elements: The interdisciplinary artist Torkwase Dyson will be responsible for the conceptual design of the exhibition; Tanda Francis, who creates monumental African heads and masks seen in both public and personal spaces, is creating bespoke mannequin heads that will be produced for the show; and the artist Tyler Mitchell will be photographing the catalogue.",

        "content": "When guests arrive at the 2025 Met Gala for “Superfine: Tailoring Black Style”—the spring 2025 exhibition at the Metropolitan Museum of Art’s Costume Institute—they’ll do so having considered the dress code, announced today as Tailored for You. Per The Met, the dress code is a nod to the exhibition’s focus on menswear and is “purposefully designed to provide guidance and invite creative interpretation.”\n\n“Superfine: Tailoring Black Style” will explore the role of sartorial style in forming Black identities, focusing on the emergence, significance, and proliferation of the Black dandy. Composed of clothing, photographs, fine art, historical texts, and artifacts, it’s the first Costume Institute exhibition to focus on menswear since 2003’s “Men in Skirts” and was inspired by guest curator Monica L. Miller’s 2009 book, Slaves to Fashion: Black Dandyism and the Styling of Black Diasporic Identity.\n\n“Dandyism can seem frivolous, but it often poses a challenge to or a transcendence of social and cultural hierarchies,” Miller said in today’s statement. “It asks questions about identity, representation, and mobility in relation to race, class, gender, sexuality, and power. This exhibition explores dandyism as both a pronouncement and a provocation.”\n\nThe show also reflects The Met’s ongoing commitment to authentically diversifying its exhibitions. “What makes it possible to translate Monica’s book Slaves to Fashion into an exhibition,” said Costume Institute curator in charge Andrew Bolton, “is our collection of high-style menswear, which serves as a foundation for imagining and realizing a sartorial history of Black dandyism.”\n\nAndré Leon Talley 5th Avenue, Arthur Elgort (American, born 1940), 1986; The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, The Irene Lewisohn Costume Reference Library Suit, Morty Sills (American, active mid-to-late 19th century), 1986; The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, Alfred Z.

Photo © Tyler Mitchell 2025\n\nNow, about the dress code: Tailored for You can be interpreted in a myriad of ways, but it mostly means embracing looks reflective of one’s personal style. We can surely expect inspired takes on suiting—from versions of the zoot silhouette popularized by jazz musicians in the 1940s to the bold, colorful styles worn by Congolese sapeurs—though other menswear staples, such as hats, ties, canes, brooches, and pocket squares, are likely to have a strong showing too.\n\nIndeed, attendees might look to Met Gala co-chairs Colman Domingo, Lewis Hamilton, A$AP Rocky, and Pharrell Williams—along with honorary chair LeBron James—for inspiration. Think Domingo arriving at the 2024 Critics Choice Awards in a mustard yellow Valentino suit and textured gold coat or Hamilton en route to the Miami Grand Prix paddock in a diamanté tank top and sleek black shades. We’ve also seen Rocky adorn his braided hair with silk scarves and beaded clips; Williams don Billionaire Boys Club graphic tees and Louis Vuitton leather flares of his own design; and James wear custom Thom Browne during the 2018 NBA Finals.",

Year after year, the event raises eight-figure sums.\n\nWhen will the Met Gala 2025 take place?\n\nThe 2025 Met Gala will take place on Monday, May 5.\n\nWhat is the Met Gala 2025 theme?\n\nOn Wednesday, October 9, the Metropolitan Museum of Art announced the Costume Institute’s spring 2025 exhibition, “Superfine: Tailoring Black Style.” Drawing inspiration from Monica L. Miller’s 2009 book Slaves to Fashion: Black Dandyism and the Styling of Black Diasporic Identity, the exhibition is organized into 12 sections, each representing a characteristic that defines dandy style: Ownership, Presence, Distinction, Disguise, Freedom, Champion, Respectability, Jook (defined in Zora Neale Hurston’s “Characteristics of Negro Expression”—an important reference for the exhibiton—as a space for dancing, drinking, and other leisure activities), Heritage, Beauty, Cool, and Cosmopolitanism.\n\n“Superfine” will feature garments, paintings, photographs, and more from artists including Torkwase Dyson, Tanda Francis, André Grenard Matswa, and Tyler Mitchell—all exploring the indelible style of Black dandies, from the 18th century through to the present day. (Miller will also serve as a guest curator for the show, working alongside Costume Institute Curator in Charge Andrew Bolton.)\n\nWho is hosting the Met Gala 2025?\n\nColman Domingo, Lewis Hamilton, A$AP Rocky, Pharrell Williams, and Anna Wintour will co-chair the 2025 Met Gala, with LeBron James serving as an honorary chair.\n\nReviving a tradition from years past, the 2025 Met Gala will also have a host committee, made up of André 3000, Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, Jordan Casteel, Dapper Dan, Doechii, Ayo Edebiri, Edward Enninful, Jeremy O. Harris, Branden Jacobs-Jenkins, Rashid Johnson, Spike Lee and Tonya Lewis Lee, Audra McDonald, Janelle Monáe, Jeremy Pope, Angel Reese, Sha'Carri Richardson, Tyla, Usher, and Kara Walker.\n\nWhat is the dress code?\n\nThis just in: the Met Gala 2025 dress code is “Tailored for You,” a nod to the exhibition’s focus on menswear and suiting that’s sure to bring out the sartorial creativity of this year’s attendees.\n\nWhat happens at the Met Gala?\n\nThat’s kept largely under wraps; guests must abide by a no-phone (and, therefore, no social media) policy once they’ve entered the museum. But the run-of-show involves dinner—overseen this year by chef Kwame Onwuachi, of the restaurants Tatiana in Lincoln Center and Dōgon in Washington, DC—and a high-profile performer (or two). Attendees also always have a moment to explore the exhibition.",

        "content": "Transcript\n\nHey, Vogue, it's Gabrielle Union\n\nand I'm gonna walk you through my everyday skincare routine\n\nand my fresh day's makeup look.\n\nFirst step, kick out the retainer.\n\n[retainer clicks]\n\nWhen you don't wear it regularly,\n\n[Gabrielle giggles]\n\ndon't tell my orthodontist.\n\nMe and my husband both have retainers.\n\nAnd every night, just like the scene in Bring It On,\n\nwe pop our retainers in and we pop ours out.\n\nThis is the U Beauty, it's the U Beauty,\n\nit's the U Beauty cleanser, which I love.\n\nAnd just in case, y'all thought I came in here\n\nwith some kind of little makeup situation on, I did not.\n\n[upbeat music]\n\nUh-oh, see,\n\nhomegirl didn't get all the makeup off last night.\n\nThis is Witch Hazel, which I use as my toner.\n\nI was very lucky,\n\n'cause I never really had crazy problem skin,\n\nnot until my hormones changed.\n\nAnd then, it was like, Is this acne?\n\nHow do you get acne as a fully grown-ass woman?\n\nBut I found a way.\n\nAnd I had to just start experimenting\n\nand so, I think I'm probably like you guys.\n\nYou try a bunch of different things,\n\nyou see what fits, what doesn't fit.\n\nMy next step is my PCA Skin pore refining exfoliator.\n\nWhen I lived in Miami,\n\nI was, ooh, I was like an oil slick like,\n\n[Gabrielle mouths sound]\n\nbut in California where it's dry heat,\n\nI've also gotten a little dry in my older age.\n\nSo, I have to switch up my routine based on where I'm at.\n\n[upbeat music]\n\nIf you see someone's skin that you like,\n\nwhat are you doing,\n\nlike tell me the products, tell me the routine.\n\nYeah and I hope that it works for you.\n\nAnd if it doesn't, it's like dating.\n\nYou just keep trying.\n\nMy aunt once said, she said it much more crass than this,\n\nBut men or women are like Kleenex.\n\nYou try one, you use it.\n\nOh look, another one's popped up in its place.\n\nJust keep trying.\n\nNext up is 111SKIN.\n\nThis is their retinol oil.\n\nI'm gonna do it like the TikTokers.\n\nThis is probably the cringe stuff\n\nthat my daughter Zaya is talking about.\n\nTrying to do like a little skin influencer thing.\n\nGet ready with me.\n\nSo, some people have very strong opinions\n\nabout retinol in the daytime, mainly because of the sun.\n\nFor me, it's kind of interchangeable,\n\nbecause I'm psycho about protection from the sun.\n\nThe Therabody face thing.\n\nAnd this is how you know it's mine,\n\nbecause that, something spilled in my luggage.\n\nAnd you can use the cold function,\n\nor you can use the heat function.\n\nI'm using cold because mama didn't sleep.\n\nAnd it stays cold.\n\nI used to just use like a little bowl of ice in the morning.\n\nYou know what?\n\nThe thing about ice is it melts.\n\nIt doesn't stay as cold as I would like.\n\nAnd in this case, yes, I am going inside to outside,\n\nbecause I'm trying to push that inflammation,\n\nthat swelling right on out.\n\nSo, I am a device sucker!\n\nI love a device.\n\nSo, sometimes, you gotta go to the Shani Darden.\n\nThis is when I need backup.\n\nMy whole face is vibrating.\n\nI met Shani when I was doing a little show,\n\ncalled L.A.'s Finest\n\nwith one of her best friends, Jessica Alba,\n\nJessica swears by Shani.\n\nAnd so, Shani's a homegirl now.\n\nIf I had a hero product, it's the resurfacing compound.\n\nI started using U Beauty in September,\n\nabout this much I use,\n\nI've never gotten more compliments on my face.\n\n[upbeat music]\n\nWell, I wish I was the one who got my husband into skincare.\n\nWe have the same amazing facialists.\n\nThe more he started doing work on TV\n\nand retired from the NBA,\n\nhe was like, Oh, I need to get into a routine.\n\nAnd he moved this beautiful chair\n\nthat was in our living room into his bathroom.\n\nBecause he really likes\n\nto luxuriate during his skincare routine.\n\nIt's quite cute.\n\nThis is the vitamin B brightening serum.\n\nUse exactly what the directions say,\n\nbecause I have a problem with that.\n\nIf it says like a dime size, girl,\n\nI'm going for a half a dollar.\n\nAnd with all the things I've used thus far,\n\nyou have to commit to sunscreen.\n\nBecause these products left without any protection\n\nfrom the sun will work against you.\n\nWe have the U Beauty, the return.\n\nThis right here helps to bring these girls back.\n\n[upbeat music]\n\nKaavia is obsessed with beauty, all things beauty.\n\nShe is the girliest girl ever.\n\nAnd she loves more makeup.\n\nShe's not really into like the skincare part of it.\n\nBut makeup?\n\nChild, she could do a beat.\n\nShe does eyes better than me.\n\nBut Zaya definitely has a skincare routine.\n\nI mean, but she's also,\n\nwhen you're walking the runways of Miu Miu,\n\nshe's gotten very much into skincare\n\nand the whole like having her own beauty routine.\n\nI don't know who else out there has a problem\n\nwith TikTok Shop.\n\nI can't stop myself.\n\nThe Babe Lash lash serum,\n\nthe new organic lash serum.\n\nAnd I use one on one eye and the other on this one.\n\nAnd I just wanna see which one is better.\n\n[upbeat music]\n\nSunscreen, I go 50 and it's Invisible Sunscreen Gel\n\nand it just disappears right into my face.\n\nHonestly, I didn't think black people needed to,\n\nI didn't think we needed to wear sunscreen.\n\nAnd that was a lie!\n\nBecause I used to think,\n\nOh my God!\n\nLook at all these freckles and moles.\n\nThey are so cute.\n\nAnd then, they started changing shape\n\nand I had to get them removed.\n\nMy girl Winnie Harlow came up\n\nwith this line called Cay Skin.\n\nThis is her lip balm, which I'm obsessed with.\n\nChocolate for the chocolate girls.\n\nBut I also discovered probably around 40\n\nwhen I was going through a lot of hormonal issues\n\nthat if I give up gluten, dairy, alcohol and caffeine,\n\nI was getting rid of a lot of inflammation\n\nand a lot of those perimenopausal challenges,\n\nhormonal challenges kind of disappeared the more I worked\n\non eliminating inflammation.\n\nSo, I'm just doing tinted moisturizer.\n\nToday, we're gonna go with the Laura Mercier slanted brush.\n\nI'm just gonna load her up like that.\n\n[upbeat music]\n\nThe beautiful thing\n\nabout more people getting into the beauty business,\n\nis that there's so many more options\n\nand there's so many more FUBU options, For Us, By Us.\n\nThere was a time though where I'd go to work\n\nand they wouldn't have the shade, child\n\nand I would look gray.\n\nSo, you start bringing your own makeup,\n\nyou start buying your own makeup.\n\nSo, now, you're paying for things\n\nthat you shouldn't have to pay for.\n\nAnd it's completely unfair and it still happens.\n\nAnd there was a time\n\nwhere there were only a few brown girls.\n\nThey're like, Be lucky girl!\n\nAnd I'm like, I don't wanna be the only one.\n\nI want there to be the range of black beauty.\n\nI want you to see the diaspora\n\non screen, behind the screens,\n\nin front of the camera, behind the camera.\n\nBut it's a fight, it's still a fight.\n\nConcealer next.\n\nI use Makeup by Mario, my honey Mario.\n\nI feel like I'm just gonna go with the darker one.\n\nAnd this is number 440.\n\n[upbeat music]\n\nI think, the first time I got my makeup done professionally,\n\nI had been discovered at Trudys dress shop.\n\nTrudys was known as the prom dress capital of the world.\n\nThis lady comes up and she's like,\n\nWould you ever consider being\n\nin our prom dress commercial?\n\nAnd so, when I was getting my makeup done,\n\nit was the same products\n\nthat you could get at any drugstore,\n\nbut it was the touch, it was the feeling like a star\n\nthat I really loved, I really did love it.\n\nI learned to do my own makeup\n\nwhen I started going to the teen clubs.\n\n[Gabrielle giggles]\n\nAnd I was like, I want a boyfriend.\n\nI don't know if you guys are familiar with Danessa Myricks\n\nand this is magic.\n\n[upbeat music]\n\nSee, it's giving me a little yellow,\n\nso, maybe, I will go back over it with a little Mario.\n\n[upbeat music]\n\nSo, my next thing is CHANEL.\n\nIt's a little blush.\n\nSo, sometimes, when you've pulled an all-nighter,\n\nyour eyes might not be as white as you'd like.\n\nAnd these LUMIFY, first of all,\n\nyou can see this is my real stuff,\n\nbecause there's not even a label.\n\nAnd it's just,\n\n[upbeat music]\n\ntake a breath.\n\n[Gabrielle breathes out]\n\nI wasn't meditating, you guys.\n\nI was just thinking about fun songs that I like.\n\nI personally only love songs if they came out before 1995.\n\nAnd that's mainly because I know the lyrics.\n\nSo, this morning, it was Dionne Warwick.\n\n♪ Do you know the way to San Jose ♪\n\n[Gabrielle mouths music]\n\nThis is the CHANEL like for a little extra,\n\n[Gabrielle mouths sound]\n\nyou know?\n\nCenter nose, what?\n\nSo, during the filming of Riff Raff,\n\nstarring the legend Jennifer Coolidge,\n\n[upbeat music]\n\nI play Sandy, she is Ed Harris' second wife\n\nand I was a second wife myself,\n\nis a little art imitating life.\n\nAnd this is my Mario, my Makeup by Mario liner.\n\nSo, she had like a really,\n\nit was pretty like a very nice, neutral,\n\nkind of like this, but with swollen eyes, you'll see it.\n\n[upbeat music]\n\nMy girl RiRi!\n\nAnd this is a Fenty classic\n\nand I literally have 51100 of these\n\nin every purse, every drawer.\n\nKaavia has taken several.\n\n[upbeat music]\n\n[Gabrielle mouths sounds]\n\nThey're glossy, they're luscious.\n\nI still want more lip glosses.\n\nSo, I'm not gonna be the friend that's like,\n\nRi, where's the album?\n\nI'm not asking, 'cause I'm like, More please.\n\nSo, this is Damone Roberts, the brow pencil.\n\nLuckily, Damone just did my eyebrows.\n\nSo, I don't really have to do much.\n\n[upbeat music]\n\nI had a thin brow, y'all.\n\nAnd I thought it like made me more,\n\nI don't know, sophisticated,\n\nbut it just made me look mean.\n\nI'm not really mean.\n\nI played a lot of mean girls, which is fun.\n\nBut I'm so my mother's child from Nebraska.\n\nI'm still trying to give my neighbors May Day gifts.\n\nAnd I don't know if that's just a Midwest thing.\n\nI have been anxious since I was 19.\n\nAnd at 19, I was sexually assaulted,\n\na story I've talked about many, many times.\n\nBut after that, I got PTSD.\n\nAnd a part of that is I just have extreme anxiety\n\nabout everything,\n\nwhich I have been working on for the last 25-plus years\n\nwith the same therapist with varying degrees of success.\n\nAs I've gotten older, it's gotten a little better.\n\nIt's a lifetime thing.\n\nAnd this is my Victoria Beckham.\n\nWhen I get really, really anxious,\n\nI talk to myself and I say,\n\nWhat's the worst that can happen?\n\nWhat is the absolute worst thing that can happen right now?\n\nIt's not gonna happen, you're okay.\n\nAnd if that doesn't work, it's the 10 deep breaths.\n\nDo they make me a little lightheaded?\n\nYes, they do, but the anxiety slowly dissipates.\n\n[upbeat music]\n\nI'm one of these people\n\nthat this feels like a surgical tool.\n\nWhen people come in, right, with, they come in like this,\n\nI definitely feel like you're gonna get my whole lash\n\nand people have.\n\nAgain, look at the mouth open.\n\n[upbeat music]\n\nHourglass, baby!\n\nIt's translucent tan.\n\n[upbeat music]\n\nMm-hmm [affirmative].\n\nAlso, I think I bought 57 of these,\n\n5711 of these from Costco.\n\nSecond to the last, Sakura.\n\nIt's so light, but like hmm,\n\nthat's a ranch [indistinct], like it's so good.\n\nThe last thing and this is my favorite,\n\nwell, one of my favorite products from my line,\n\nit's the Styling Glaze\n\nwhere I could have just done with my finger, but.\n\nI hope you guys enjoyed it.\n\nI hope you learned a little something more about me,\n\nthe products that I use.\n\nAnd I hope you have a great day.\n\nI will.",

Hamilton, a regular attendee since 2015, has transformed the once fashion-devoid Formula 1 paddocks into hotbeds of inspiration, arriving to the track in deftly styled looks from houses that often host him at their fashion shows (in the front row, of course). A$AP Rocky, meanwhile, finds himself lensed by street style photographers almost daily—his singular, distinct aesthetic surely on mood boards across the globe. 2025 will mark Williams’s sixth time at the Met Gala and second as co-chair; he previously assumed the role in 2017 for “Rei Kawakubo/Comme des Garçons: Art of the In-Between.” A boundless arbiter of fashion during his decades-long career in music, that influence continues today through Williams’s role as creative director of Louis Vuitton Men’s. Honorary chair James will be attending his first Met Gala, bringing with him an incomparable athletic legacy and an embrace of style that has helped fuel today’s unprecedented crossover between fashion and sports.\n\nChaired by Wintour since 1995, the Met Gala returns to New York City on May 5, 2025. The dress code will be announced in early 2025, and “Superfine: Tailoring Black Style” will be on view May 6 through October 26, 2025. Mark your calendars.",

        "content": "Editor’s Note: As the news breaks that Pharrell Williams will be co-chair of the 2025 Met Gala, we have revisted and updated this analysis of his personal style.\n\nMonsieur Louis Vuitton might have been trunkmaker to an empress, but Pharrell Williams—who will made his debut at the French house in 2023—has even closer ties to royalty, having fashioned himself “son of a pharaoh.” In advance of that event Williams posted a picture of himself atop an LV pyramid of wood on Instagram. Was it a manifestation of the “room without a roof” he sings about in his hit song “Happy”?\n\nHaving walked runways and been a muse, collaborator, and designer, Williams is no stranger to fashion, or to Louis Vuitton. His relationship with the French luxury house dates back about 20 years. “Where it all started” is the caption he attached to a photo from 2004 in which he’s wearing a Louis Vuitton x Takashi Murakami scarf with a varsity jacket. Beyond that, there’s the 2006 “Say Somethin” video with Mariah Carey, shot in the Paris flagship store; the eyeglass collaboration for the house with Nigo; and the Blason jewelry collection of 2008. As the first collection proved, the creative director takes cues from his own closet. Though he shed some of his sartorial past through sales on his auction platform, Joopiter, the performer has a clear style identity that’s built around denim and messaging, motos and diamonds, and camo and cardigans. The creative director is loyal to the brands he’s (co)founded, Billionaire Boys Club, Icecream, and Humanrace, and to the companies he’s collaborated with, including Adidas. In addition to Louis Vuitton, in the past he’s worn a lot of Chanel and Comme des Garçons.\n\nWith a vibe that is casual but cool, and an emphasis on fabrics that have patina or soft textures, Williams introduces structure into his wardrobe via military-inspired garb and short suits. He also has a penchant for jewelry and a taste for statement shoes and the occasional topper. Who can forget the Buffalo hat, designed by Vivienne Westwood for World’s End, that he wore to the 2014 Grammy Awards? As with his music, Williams is able to work across genres to come up with something that is signature Pharrell.Here, an analysis of Williams’s personal style.\n\nBoth Sides Now\n\nWilliams has a 360-degree view of fashion, having been a model, muse, creator, and customer.",

        "source": "https://www.vogue.com/",
        "content": "I find getting enough protein daily challenging. “Protein is essential for building and repairing every cell in your body,” says Ayla Barmmer, MS, RDN, LDN and founder of FullWell Fertility. “It supports the creation of enzymes and hormones, boosts immune function, and helps transport nutrients.”\n\nI know I'm not alone: Whether or not they know it, much of women in the United States are suffering from a protein deficiency. “Inadequate protein intake can have widespread negative effects on the body, impacting multiple systems and functions,” says Barmmer, listing off a host of symptoms I’m simply not interested in experiencing, including feeling weak, reduced strength, brittle hair and nails, reduced ability to fight infection or illness, and mental fog.\n\nWhen it comes to asking “how much protein do I need?” the nutritionist also shares some simple rules: If you're a sedentary adult, aim for one gram for every kilogram you weigh; if you’re an active adult, 1.6 to 2.2 grams per every kilogram you weigh; and if you’re over the age of 65, 1.2 to 1.5 grams per every kilogram you weigh. So if you weigh 165 pounds, that translates to 72.5 kilograms, so you’re aiming for around 145 grams of protein a day.\n\nPhew, this is even more intimidating than I thought. In an attempt to step up my protein game, Barmmer compiled a list of foods for me to eat as much as possible—and I’m sharing it with you. 2025 is the year of protein.\n\nFish\n\nWhen it comes to eating fish, not all have the same amount of protein. There are more than 36 varieties that the FDA declares as healthy options, and the four that are the highest when it comes to protein are tuna (24.4 grams of protein in a 100-gram serving for ahi tuna), salmon (25.92 grams in a 100-gram serving), cod (19.36 grams of protein in a 100-gram serving), and mackerel (25.45 grams of protein in a 100-gram serving).\n\nHemp Seeds\n\nThese seeds may be tiny, but they are surprisingly mighty. Two tablespoons of hemp seeds have just as much protein as two egg whites—along with all nine essential amino acids (a rarity), omega-3, and omega-6.\n\nEggs\n\n“Eggs should absolutely be part of your weekly rotation, but you want to eat the egg with the yolk,” says Barmmer. In a large egg, you’ll get about six grams of available protein. “Eggs also have a good dose of brain- and liver- and gall-bladder-supporting choline.”\n\nNut butter\n\n“While they can and should be part of your rotation, don’t expect things like peanut butter to be a significant protein source in your diet,” levels Barmmer. “They will give a small boost but it simply requires too much in terms of volume and calories to reach your protein needs with them. For example, it would take 679 calories worth of peanut butter (7 tablespoons) to equal 175 calories of a three-ounce serving of lean beef.\n\nQuinoa\n\nIf you’re gluten-free, plant-based, or on a whole foods diet, quinoa should be a big part of your diet. “This grain-like seed is one of the few complete plant protein sources providing about eight grams per cup,” says Barmmer. “It’s rich in magnesium and fiber as well.”\n\nGreek Yogurt\n\nThicker and creamier than regular yogurt because it’s fermented for longer, Greek yogurt’s health benefits far surpass the OG variety. “From a nutrition perspective, Greek yogurt typically has significantly more protein—often two times as much!—and fewer carbohydrates than regular yogurt,” says clinical nutritionist Heather Hodson, RDN, CDCES at NYU Langone Health. It’s also a fantastic source of calcium, which helps maintain strong bones and teeth.\n\nCottage Cheese\n\nBig on social media recently, cottage cheese is having a come back. “Just half of a cup of cottage cheese can provide between 12 and 16 grams of protein,” says Barmmer. All you need to do is read the label. “It contains casein, a slow-digesting protein that supports muscle repair and growth. It’s filling and rich in calcium.”\n\nPowders\n\nProtein powders or collagen peptides are a great addition to you diet if you're looking to up your intake. “Collagen peptides are a convenient, bioavailable, and effective way to support your body’s collagen needs, particularly as production naturally declines with age,” says Barmmer. “Adding them to your diet can help maintain youthful skin, strong joints, and overall connective tissue health.”\n\nBeef\n\n“The debate on the sustainability of beef is nuanced and requires a separate discussion, but if you can put that aside and purely look at nutrition quality, it’s really difficult to beat beef,” Barmmer says. “This is one of the most nutrient-dense sources of protein available and is a great idea to include in weekly meal plans.”",

        "content": "This month, Margot Robbie has been on-location in the U.K. filming Emerald Fennell’s adaptation of Wuthering Heights. (I mean, did you not see those epic wedding dress photos?). But yesterday in London, the actor enjoyed a rare day off by grabbing lunch with her husband, Tom Ackerley. Naturally, Robbie had a cool, casual off-duty look for the outing. After all, the star is never without a fashion-forward outfit, even if she is merely stepping out for coffee. (See: her maternity wardrobe last year.)\n\nRobbie’s version of a day-off uniform? It was a fresh take on double denim, otherwise known as the Canadian tuxedo. The star chose a matching light-wash set, consisting of an oversized button-up shirt paired with baggy jeans. While she could have easily drowned in the look’s sea of denim fabric, her sharper accessories—like black pointed heels, and a sleek leather shoulder bag—gave the pieces a more polished finish.\n\nRobbie isn’t the first star to embrace the classic appeal of a Canadian tuxedo, either. Many Hollywood trendsetters have doubled up on denim, from Rihanna to Bella Hadid, proving that it’s a timeless combo that will always make a statement. Robbie’s new approach—by going oversized, and adding structured accessories—is the styling move to replicate for spring.",
