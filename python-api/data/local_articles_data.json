        "fullContent": "The greatest pass of Jalen Hurts’ life, the first parade in Philadelphia history and a look at Josh Sweat’s future.\n\nRoob’s 10 Random Eagles Observations have now morphed into Roob’s 10 Random Eagles Offseason Observations, and that’s what they’ll remain until training camp starts in a little over five months.\n\nWow, that’s soon.\n\n1A. That dagger 46-yard touchdown to DeVonta Smith may have been Jalen Hurts’ greatest pass ever and certainly one of the greatest Super Bowl touchdowns ever. I’ve watched this one more than any play since 4th and 26, easily over 100 times, and it never ceases to astonish me. The Eagles already led 27-0 and had a 1st-and-10 on the Chiefs’ 46-yard-line after Avonte Maddox’s 4th-down pass breakup early in the third round quarter. Start with DeVonta, who separates from Chiefs corner Jaylen Watson right off the line of scrimmage. Watson tries to get a jam on Smith but can’t, and Smith just runs unimpeded at full speed down the field toward the end zone. Hurts has incredible protection on the play from his o-line and also Saquon Barkley and backup tight end Grant Calcaterra, who both pick up blitzes. He play-fakes to Barkley and when he unloads, there isn’t a Chief within five feet of him. He’s got a clean pocket to work in, and he takes time to get his feet under him, set and fire. Smith first turns around to look for the ball at the 30-yard-line, which is a split second before Hurts releases it. Smith never breaks stride. Never slows down. Their timing is perfect. And Smith doesn’t do anything to let Watson know the ball is on the way. Watson never turns around and never makes up that step that DeVonta has on him. Smith doesn’t have to move his hands until just before the ball arrives because the ball is heading precisely into his grasp. Smith jumps just a bit as he crosses the plane of the end zone and catches the ball a little off the ground. Watson immediately tackles Smith and tries to pry the ball away, but Smith wasn’t about to let go as he tumbles to the ground. Touchdown Eagles and a 34-0 lead. Smith and Hurts have known each other since Smith was in high school and Hurts was his host during his visit to Alabama. They’ve both talked often about how instead of partying they went to the football facility and threw and studied film. They’ve taken countless reps together since then, spent innumerable hours studying, thrown with each other every offseason. They’ve both put an insane amount of time together working toward this one moment, and on the biggest stage they showed what football perfection looks like.\n\nGet top local stories in Philly delivered to you every morning.

If you don’t think Sirianni has anything to do with the offense, that’s a must-see video. Sirianni kicked himself after Super Bowl LVII for not being aggressive enough, and he just wasn’t going to let it happen again. Brilliant.\n\n1C. The other unbelievable thing about that play — and you can see this in the end zone copy — is how quickly Saquon Barkley raises his fist. The ball is still on its upward trajectory and Saquon is already celebrating.\n\n2A. Nick Sirianni is only the second coach in NFL history to win six playoff games in his first four seasons. Joe Gibbs won six with Washington from 1981 through 1984. Tom Flores, John Fox, Mike Tomlin, Paul Brown, George Seifert and Bill Parcells each won five.\n\n2B. The Eagles won six playoff games from 1961 through 1999. They’ve won six playoff games since 2022.\n\n3. An underrated facet of the Eagles’ monster defensive performance last Sunday was the way they shut down the Chiefs’ running game while Kansas City was still trying to run the ball. The Chiefs were 3-for-3 rushing in the first half and they were 6-for-17 at the point the Eagles went up 34-0. They didn’t have a run from scrimmage longer than eight yards and Patrick Mahomes had a couple scrambles late, but the Chiefs’ running backs netted 24 total yards, 4th-fewest in Super Bowl history behind the 1985 Broncos (8), 2002 Raiders (16) and 1974 Vikings (17). The Chiefs realized early they couldn’t run against the Eagles, and Andy Reid stopped even trying while the game was still somewhat close. That let the Eagles’ defensive front tee off on the Chiefs’ hapless offensive line. Isiah Pacheco, who gashed the Eagles for 76 yards on 15 carries in Super Bowl LVII two years ago, ran three times for seven yards, and Kareem Hunt, who had a bounce-back season with 728 yards and seven TDs, managed nine yards on three carries. This defensive front is dangerous enough against a balanced offense. When it knows the other team is going to throw? Forget it. You have no shot.\n\n4. The first championship parade in Philadelphia history took place on Nov. 5, 1910, two weeks after the Athletics finished off the Cubs with a 7-2 win in Game 5 of the World Series at Chicago’s West Side Grounds. The parade route went south on Broad Street, starting at Montgomery, around the west side of City Hall, then south to Wolf Street. This was an evening parade, starting at 8 p.m. According to the Nov. 7, 1910, Inquirer “nearly a million” people watched, although according to the Delaware County Times, “The spectacle was witnessed by 100,000 persons.” I’m guessing the Inquirer’s estimate was closer to the actual attendance. A non-bylined columnist wrote: “The tribe of (Connie) Mack had brought distinction to the good, old town and everyone seemed imbued with the desire to give some expression of their appreciation. Everybody was there and everybody was happy.” Some things never change.\n\n5. Quarterbacks who’ve put up at least 33 points in multiple Super Bowls: Bart Starr, Joe Montana, Tom Brady, Jalen Hurts.\n\n6. Jake Elliott’s revival is one of the coolest stories of the 2024 postseason. He was so unreliable during the regular season, missing eight field goal attempts and going 1-for-7 from 50 yards and out (the rest of the league made 71 percent) and then he missed three PATs the first two weeks of the postseason, the second kicker in NFL history to miss three PATs in a single postseason, and then missed a 54-yarder in the NFC Championship Game. Not a chip shot but a 73 percent kick league-wide this year. So it wasn’t easy to be super confident in Elliott heading into the Super Bowl, although he was money in his first two. As a rookie, he made incredibly high-pressure kicks from 42 and 46 yards in the fourth quarter of Super Bowl LII in Minneapolis and then two years ago he was 2-for-2 in Glendale in Super Bowl LVII. So what does he do Sunday? After going 3-for-9 from 48 yards and out during the regular season, he matches his entire season total of 48-yard kicks with field goals from 48, 48 and 50 yards. He became the first kicker ever with three field goals of at least 48 yards in the same Super Bowl and only the second with three career 48-yarders in a Super Bowl. Elliott is now responsible for three of the 14-longest Super Bowl field goals ever and his 9-for-9 in Super Bowls is the best ever. Overall, Elliott was 10-for-11 this postseason, and he’s now 26-for-27 in his career in the postseason for 96.3 percent, 2nd-highest ever (minimum 20 attempts) behind Robbie Gould’s 29-for-29. Who he can’t catch. Elliott is one of only seven kickers to play in three Super Bowls and along with Lane Johnson, Brandon Graham and Rick Lovato, he’s one of four Eagles to win two Super Bowls. A month ago, what to do with Elliott seemed like it would be a huge question this offseason. But he proved he’s still got it, and he did it in some high-leverage situations. After that performance? He’s not going anywhere.\n\n7. Somebody needs to explain Josh Sweat’s last couple years to me. Coming off his 11-sack 2022 season, he opens 2023 with a dominating 6 ½ sacks in his first nine games, then goes 12 straight games over the 2023 and 2024 seasons without a sack. Starting in Week 4 this year, he picks up seven sacks in eight games and looks unstoppable again, then gets one sack in his next eight games. Going into the Super Bowl you know Brandon Graham isn’t going to play much, Bryce Huff will be inactive and Sweat is in another lengthy slump, and you’re thinking Nolan Smith is the only edge guy who’s going to be able to generate pressure. Then all Sweat does in Super Bowl LIX is record a career-high 2 ½ sacks – 5th-most in Super Bowl history – along with two QB hits and two tackles for loss. He picked the biggest game of his life for the best game of his life. Remember how Derrick Burgess parlayed a huge NFC Championship Game in 2004 against Michael Vick and the Falcons into a huge (at the time) five-year, $17.5 million contract with the Raiders? Burgess only had 2 ½ sacks during the 2004 regular season but had 3.0 in the playoffs. Obviously, Sweat’s production is beyond Burgess’s, but the dynamic is similar. An edge rusher who made himself a ton of money with a huge postseason. Everybody is looking for edge rushers, and with Smith having a breakthrough season and Jalyx Hunt popping late in the season – 1 ½ sacks , three QB hits and one tackle for loss in the regular season, 1 ½ sacks, three QB hits and one tackle for loss in the playoffs – I could see the Eagles going with those two plus a high draft pick in their edge rotation and not over-paying to keep Sweat. And because of his contract, Huff will still be here and get an opportunity to find a spot in the rotation as well. Sweat’s been a very good if inconsistent player during his seven years here. He’s 8th in Eagles history with 48 sacks, and he’s still only 27. Sweat says he wants to be here and expects to get something done, and I’m sure Howie Roseman would love to keep him. I’m just not sure the numbers will agree. If he hits the open market, he’s going to get offers the Eagles may not be able to match.\n\n8A. The last two Super Bowl-winning quarterbacks drafted outside the first round are Nick Foles and Jalen Hurts.\n\n8B. The Eagles are the only team in NFL history to draft two Super Bowl-winning quarterbacks outside the first round.\n\n8C. The only other teams that have drafted two QBs who’ve each won a Super Bowl for the team that drafted them are the Cowboys (Roger Staubach, Troy Aikman), Packers (Bart Starr, Aaron Rodgers), Giants (Phil Simms, Jeff Hostetler) and Steelers (Terry Bradshaw, Ben Roethlisberger).\n\n8D. Remember, the Falcons drafted Brett Favre, the Patriots drafted Jim Plunkett, the Steelers drafted Len Dawson, the Chargers drafted Eli Manning and the Buccaneers drafted Steve Young and Doug Williams.\n\n9A. Four interior linemen in Eagles history have had 2.0 or more sacks in a single postseason. One is Darwin Walker in 2006. The others are Jalen Carter, Milton Williams and Jordan Davis this year.\n\n9B. The Eagles are the first team in NFL history to have three interior linemen record multiple sacks in the same postseason. Only two teams – the 1992 and 1995 Cowboys – also had more than one – Tony Casillas and Russell Maryland in 1992 and Chad Hennings and Leon Lett in 1995. Both those Cowboys teams beat the Eagles in the conference semifinals.\n\n9C. Eagles interior defensive linemen had 13 ½ postseason sacks from 1982 – when sacks became an official NFL stat – through 2023. Eagles interior defensive linemen had 7.0 sacks this year. So 34 percent of the postseason sacks interior linemen have ever recorded for the Eagles came this year.\n\n10. Jalen Hurts had one passing touchdown and three rushing touchdowns in his first Super Bowl and two passing TDs and one rushing TD this time. His seven total touchdowns are most ever by a quarterback in his first two Super Bowls. Joe Montana previously had the most with five TDs in his first two Super Bowls. Only five quarterbacks have more career Super Bowl touchdowns than Hurts: Tom Brady (21), Montana (13), Patrick Mahomes (11), Terry Bradshaw (9) and Roger Staubach (8).\n\nSubscribe to Eagle Eye anywhere you get your podcasts:\n\nApple Podcasts | YouTube Music | Spotify | Stitcher | Simplecast | RSS | Watch on YouTube",

He was a 6th-round pick out of Penn State in 2022, taken by the 49ers. Castro-Fields actually played in 10 games with 1 start for the Commanders in 2022 and 2023 and in 2024 played in 2 games with the Carolina Panthers. In his NFL career, Castro-Fields has played 27 snaps on defense and 109 on special teams. He has not appeared in a game for the Eagles.\n\nWR Elijah Cooks: Cooks (6-4, 215) went undrafted out of San Jose State in 2023. He was with the Jaguars and played in 11 games over two seasons. He had 3 catches for 38 yards in those games. Cooks began his college career at Nevada but in his one year at San Jose State had 69 catches for 1,076 yards and 10 touchdowns. Cooks was with the Eagles’ practice squad for a week in January.\n\nRB Tyrion Davis-Price: After being taken in the 3rd round of the 2022 draft out of LSU, Davis-Price played in just 7 games in 2022 and 2023 with the 49ers before getting cut. He spent this past season on the Eagles’ practice squad and played in one game. He had 3 carries for 7 yards on Dec. 29 against the Cowboys. In the preseason, Davis-Price had 22 carries for 118 yards.\n\nLB Dallas Gant: Gant (6-2, 224) went undrafted out of Toledo in 2024 after previously playing at Ohio State. He was with the Vikings in training camp and spent the first couple months on their practice squad before getting released and joining the Eagles’ practice squad. Gant was elevated for two games — the final two of the regular season. He played 26 snaps on special teams.\n\nWR Danny Gray: Another former 49ers pick, Gray was selected in the 3rd round out of SMU in 2022. Gray (6-0, 200) played in 13 games as a rookie and had 1 catch for 10 yards. Gray had a productive couple seasons at SMU as a receiver and return man. Gray has track speed; he ran a 4.33 at the combine.\n\nDT Gabe Hall: The Eagles signed Hall (6-6, 295) as an undrafted free agent out of Baylor this season. He spent the entire year on the Eagles’ practice squad. Hall made some plays in training camp as a rookie and is worth taking a look at in Year 2.\n\nDE K.J. Henry: The Commanders drafted Henry (6-4, 255) in the 5th round out of Clemson in the 2023 draft. In the last two years (with the Commanders, Bengals and Cowboys) Henry has played in 14 games with 3 starts and has 2 1/2 sacks. He has also played 144 special teams snaps. Henry has not played in a game for the Eagles.\n\nLB Ochaun Mathis: The Rams drafted Mathis (6-5, 260) in the 6th round out of Nebraska in the 2023 draft. Mathis played in the Baltimore game in 2024 and had 9 special teams snaps. In his NFL career, Mathis has played in 14 games.\n\nTE Nick Muse: The Eagles didn’t sign Muse (6-5, 252) to their practice squad until January. The Vikings selected him in the 7th round out of South Carolina in 2022. He played in 16 games over three seasons with the Vikings and had 1 catch for 22 yards.\n\nDB Parry Nickerson: The Eagles kept the 30-year-old veteran around all season after a strong training camp. Nickerson has played in 30 games with 3 starts in his NFL career and was with Vic Fangio in Miami in 2023, playing five games for the Dolphins.\n\nDB Andre’ Sam: Everyone knew it was Saquon Barkley and Cooper DeJean’s birthday on Super Bowl Sunday but it was also Sam’s birthday! Sam turned 26 as the Eagles beat the Chiefs. Sam played in one game this season against the Panthers; 12 special teams snaps.\n\nOT Laekin Vakalahi: The Eagles had an international exemption for Vakalahi, who is from Australia. He was the 17th member of the practice squad all season and will have another exemption spot in 2025.\n\nDB A.J. Woods: Woods (5-9, 186) went undrafted out of Pitt in 2024. He initially signed with the Commanders and signed with the Eagles’ practice squad in early September. He didn’t see any game action in 2024.\n\nSubscribe to Eagle Eye anywhere you get your podcasts:\n\nApple Podcasts | YouTube Music | Spotify | Stitcher | Simplecast | RSS | Watch on YouTube",

        "fullContent": "The Trump administration has begun firing several hundred Federal Aviation Administration employees, upending staff on a busy air travel weekend and just weeks after a January fatal mid-air collision at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport.\n\nProbationary workers were targeted in late-night emails Friday notifying them they had been fired, David Spero, president of the Professional Aviation Safety Specialists union, said in a statement.\n\nThe impacted workers include personnel hired for FAA radar, landing and navigational aid maintenance, one air traffic controller told the Associated Press. The air traffic controller was not authorized to talk to the media and spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\nSpero said messages began arriving after 7 p.m. on Friday and continued late into the night. More might be notified over the long weekend or barred from entering FAA buildings on Tuesday, he said.\n\nGet top local stories in Philly delivered to you every morning. Sign up for NBC Philadelphia's News Headlines newsletter.\n\nThe employees were fired “without cause nor based on performance or conduct,” Spero said, and the emails were “from an ‘exec order’ Microsoft email address” — not a government email address.\n\nThe firings hit the FAA when it faces a shortfall in controllers. Federal officials have been raising concerns about an overtaxed and understaffed air traffic control system for years, especially after a series of close calls between planes at U.S. airports. Among the reasons they have cited for staffing shortages are uncompetitive pay, long shifts, intensive training and mandatory retirements.\n\nIn the Jan. 29 fatal crash between a U.S. Army Black Hawk helicopter and an American Airlines passenger jet, which is still under investigation, one controller was handling both commercial airline and helicopter traffic at the busy airport.\n\nJust days before the collision, President Donald Trump had already fired all the members of the Aviation Security Advisory Committee, a panel mandated by Congress after the 1988 PanAm 103 bombing over Lockerbie, Scotland. The committee is charged with examining safety issues at airlines and airports.\n\nOne FAA employee who was fired over the weekend suggested he was targeted for his views on Tesla and X, formerly Twitter, not as part of a general probationary-level sweep. Both are owned by Elon Musk, who is leading Trump's effort to cut the federal government.\n\nCharles Spitzer-Stadtlander posted on LinkedIn that he was fired just after midnight Saturday, days after he started getting harassing messages on Facebook.\n\n“The official DOGE Facebook page started harassing me on my personal Facebook account after I criticized Tesla and Twitter,\" Spitzer-Stadtlander wrote. “Less than a week later, I was fired, despite my position allegedly being exempted due to national security.”\n\nHe added: \"When DOGE fired me, they turned off my computer and wiped all of my files without warning.”\n\nSpitzer-Stadtlander said he was supposed to be exempted from the probationary firings because the FAA office he worked in focused on national security threats such as attacks on the national airspace by drones.\n\nThe Musk-led Department of Government Efficiency did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The firings were first reported by CNN.\n\n—-\n\nAssociated Press writer Ellen Knickmeyer contributed from Washington.",

        "source": "https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/",
        "fullContent": "The Trump administration on Saturday terminated hundreds of employees at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, including fellows responsible for key public health roles, according to two sources who spoke to NBC News at the agency who spoke on the condition of anonymity out of concern over retaliation.\n\nAmong them were about two dozen workers who made up the Laboratory Leadership Service, or LLS, a group responsible for training public health laboratory staffers and supporting outbreak response efforts. The two-year fellowship program launched in 2015, focusing on laboratory safety and regulatory compliance.\n\n“We have come up with a new slogan for LLS: ‘the disease detectors.’ If you’re not testing, you don’t know what disease is there,” a current fellow, who was among those who received termination notices, told NBC News.\n\nTermination emails, which were sent to LLS staff members Saturday evening, cited poor performance as the reason for the firings, even though most of the dismissed employees have “excellent” performance reviews, a midlevel CDC official said.\n\nGet top local stories in Philly delivered to you every morning. Sign up for NBC Philadelphia's News Headlines newsletter.\n\nMultiple outlets reported that a larger sister program at CDC called the Epidemic Intelligence Service, or EIS, known as the agency’s “disease detectives,” was expected to be cut significantly, as well. As of Sunday, though, the two officials who spoke to NBC News had not heard of firings at EIS. One, a senior CDC official, said everyone who was going to be terminated had been notified by Sunday.\n\n\"Even if EIS was spared, there are multiple other fellowships that were not, and that's a pipeline for the next generation of CDC leaders,\" the senior official said. \"We're being cut off at the knees. It is going to cripple public health for decades.\"\n\nOther departments that had cuts included the Presidential Management Fellows, which aims to develop future public health leaders, and the Public Health Associate Program, which assigns fellows to local health agencies, the two officials said.\n\nThe termination process has been marked by chaos and a lack of transparency.\n\nAlmost two weeks ago, the Office of Personnel Management assigned CDC leadership to look through a list of employees who were in probationary or term-limited positions — including new directors, fellows and highly skilled noncitizen scientists — and designate each as “must be retained,” “mission critical” or “not mission critical.” According to the two CDC officials, the lists did not appear to have been used in the ultimate firing decisions.\n\nRepresentatives for the White House, the CDC and the Department of Health and Human Services did not immediately reply to requests for comment.\n\nPresident Donald Trump signed a memorandum Thursday which seeks to impose \"fair and reciprocal\" trade tariffs on all major U.S. trading partners, including longtime allies.\n\nIn recent years, LLS fellows have assisted with dengue fever testing in American Samoa and Oropouche virus testing in Florida. In 2020, the group oversaw Covid-19 testing for thousands of Arizona residents.\n\nThe LLS fellows who received the termination notice said their co-workers were less concerned about their jobs than about what the moves signaled for public health.\n\n\"A lot of us, we could have gone to more lucrative careers,\" said the fellow, who spoke on the condition of anonymity out of concern of compromising their remaining weeks of paid leave. \"We could have worked for pharma. We could have worked for biotech or something like that and made so much more money. But we're all passionate for public health and just want to see public health succeed.\"\n\nThe dismissal messages were sent the day after the Trump administration informed CDC leaders of plans to fire nearly 1,300 probationary employees at the agency, roughly one-tenth of its total workforce.\n\nA representative for the Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees the CDC, previously said the cuts were a part of the administration’s larger effort to reduce the size of the federal workforce.\n\n“HHS is following the Administration’s guidance and taking action to support the President’s broader efforts to restructure and streamline the federal government. This is to ensure that HHS better serves the American people at the highest and most efficient standard,” Andrew Nixon, the department’s director of communications, wrote.\n\nAs part of broad-based cuts to the federal government implemented by the Trump administration and Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency, the Office of Personnel Management officials last week directed leaders of federal agencies to dismiss probationary employees, potentially affecting hundreds of thousands of people classified under that status. Since the directive was sent out, at least some probationary employees have been sent notices by the departments of Veterans Affairs and Transportation.\n\nThis article first appeared on NBCNews.com.

        "fullContent": "As President Donald Trump approaches the first-month mark in his second term, he has moved with dizzying speed and blunt force to reorder American social and political norms and the economy while redefining the U.S. role in the world.\n\nAt the same time, he has empowered Elon Musk, an unelected, South African-born billionaire, to help engineer the firing of thousands of federal employees and potentially shutter entire agencies created by Congress.\n\nThose efforts have largely overshadowed Trump's crackdowns on immigration and the U.S.-Mexico border, and his efforts to remake social policy by wiping out diversity, equity and inclusion programs and rolling back transgender rights.\n\nThe president has also imposed scores of new tariffs against U.S. trade partners and threatened more, even as economists warn that will pass costs on to U.S. consumers and feed inflation.\n\nGet top local stories in Philly delivered to you every morning. Sign up for NBC Philadelphia's News Headlines newsletter.\n\nHere's a look at the first four weeks:\n\nMass federal firings begin\n\nNews4's Dominique Moody had new reaction from a federal worker affected by recent mass layoffs.\n\nThe Trump administration fired thousands of workers who were still in probationary periods common among new hires. Some had less than an hour to leave their offices.\n\nThose potentially losing jobs include medical scientists, energy infrastructure specialists, foreign service employees, FBI agents, prosecutors, educational and farming data experts, overseas aid workers and even human resources personnel who would otherwise have to manage the dismissals.\n\nAt the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which was created to protect the public after the 2008 financial crisis, employees say the administration not only wants to cut nearly the entire workforce but also erase all its data from the past 12 years. The administration agreed to pause any further dismantling of the agency until March 3, under a judge's order.\n\nWhile Trump promised to turn Washington upside down, his moves could have far-reaching implications for thousands of federal employees around the country and drive up the unemployment rate if large numbers of layoffs happen at once.\n\nLegal challenges mount\n\nCourt challenges to Trump’s policies started on Inauguration Day and have continued at a furious pace since Jan. 20. The administration is facing some 70 lawsuits nationwide challenging his executive orders and moves to downsize the federal government.\n\nThe Republican-controlled Congress is putting up little resistance, so the court system is ground zero for pushback. Judges have issued more than a dozen orders at least temporarily blocking aspects of Trump's agenda, ranging from an executive order to end U.S. citizenship extended automatically to people born in this country to giving Musk's team access to sensitive federal data.\n\nWhile many of those judges were nominated by Democratic presidents, Trump has gotten unfavorable rulings from judges picked by Republican presidents, too. Trump suggested he could target the judiciary, saying, “Maybe we have to look at the judges.\" The administration has said in the meantime that it will appeal, while White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt railed against the orders slowing the president's agenda, calling each “an abuse of the rule of law.”\n\nThe administration has notched a few wins, too, most significantly when a judge allowed it to move forward with a deferred resignation program spearheaded by Musk.\n\nThe economic outlook worsens\n\nAmid the policy upheaval, the latest economic data could prompt some White House worries.\n\nInflation rose at a monthly rate of 0.5% in January, according to the Labor Department. Over the past three months, the consumer price index has increased at an annual rate of 4.5% -- a sign that inflation is heating up again after having cooled for much of 2024.\n\nTrump told voters he could lower inflation, and do so almost immediately after taking office. But Leavitt, while blaming Trump's predecessor, Democrat Joe Biden, acknowledged the latest inflation indicators were \"worse than expected.”\n\nMore trouble signs came when the Commerce Department reported that retail sales slumped 0.9% on a monthly basis in January. A drop that large could signal a weakening in consumer confidence and economic growth.\n\nThe Federal Reserve’s report on industrial production also found that factory output slipped 0.1% in January, largely due to a 5.2% drop in the making of motor vehicles and parts.\n\nThese could all be blips, which means the monthly data in February will really matter.\n\nThe ‘fair trade’ Trump wants isn't necessarily fair\n\nPresident Donald Trump signed a memorandum Thursday which seeks to impose \"fair and reciprocal\" trade tariffs on all major U.S. trading partners, including longtime allies.\n\nAfter previously imposing tariffs on China and readying import taxes on Canada and Mexico, Trump rolled out what he called the “big one.” He said his administration would put together new tariffs in the coming weeks and months to match what other countries charge.\n\nOther nations hardly find Trump’s approach fair.\n\nFrom their vantage point, he is including items other than tariffs such as value added taxes, which are akin to sales taxes. That means the rates could be much higher than a standard tariff in Europe.\n\nOn top of that, Trump plans separate additional tariffs on autos, computer chips and pharmaceuticals, in addition to the 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum that he announced on Monday.\n\nIt is not clear whether these trade penalties are mainly negotiating tools or ways for Trump to raise revenues. So far, he has suggested that they are both.\n\nCongress watches its authority erode. But there are signs of pushback\n\nCongress finds itself confounded by the onslaught as its institutional power — as the Constitution’s first branch of government with its unmatched authority over federal spending — is being eroded in real time.\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., said he finds the work of Musk's team “very exciting.” Johnson said Trump is “taking legitimate executive action.\"\n\nBut even among congressional Republicans there were small signs of protest emerging — letters being written and phone calls being made — to protect their home-state interests and constituents as funding for programs, services and government contracts is being dismantled.\n\nRep. Carlos Gimenez, R-Fla., urged the Homeland Security Department not to issue blanket deportations for Venezuelan migrants who fled their country and now call the Miami-area home. “I’m not powerless. I’m a member of Congress,” he said.\n\nDemocratic lawmakers have joined protesters outside shuttered federal offices, arguing Trump and Musk had gone too far. Democrats suggested legislation to protect various programs, and even filed articles of impeachment against the president over his plans to bulldoze and redevelop Gaza.\n\nTrump wants a new world order\n\nWith his phone call to Russian President Vladimir Putin this past week, Trump is hoping he initiated the beginning of the end of the Kremlin's war on Ukraine.\n\nThe leaders agreed to have their teams “start negotiations immediately.” After getting off the phone with Putin, Trump called Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to discuss getting both sides to the negotiating table.\n\nThe Putin call is a monumental development in a war that has left hundreds of thousands dead or seriously wounded.\n\nBut the way ahead remains complicated.\n\nZelenskyy said he will not meet with Putin until a plan for peace is hammered out by Trump. Trump has gotten blowback when European leaders sharply criticized him and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth for suggesting that NATO membership was not in the cards for Ukraine.\n\nThe White House faces a further quandary with Zelenskyy wanting the U.S. and other countries to provide security guarantees for Ukraine, and Zelenskyy insisting that he and Trump iron out an agreement on the contours of any peace deal.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Aamer Madhani in Munich and AP Congressional Correspondent Lisa Mascaro contributed to this report.",

And they are going to interview Eagles quarterbacks coach Doug Nussmeier for their offensive coordinator vacancy, NFL Network’s Ian Rapoport reported.\n\nWhile Eagles head coach Nick Sirianni definitely doesn’t like the idea of his staff getting poached, there’s nothing he can do about a position coach taking a coordinator role. It’s what happened when Jonathan Gannon hired away linebackers coach Nick Rallis as his defensive coordinator in Arizona after the 2022 Super Bowl season.\n\nGet top local stories in Philly delivered to you every morning. Sign up for NBC Philadelphia's News Headlines newsletter.\n\nNussmeier seems like an obvious choice for Moore. Nussmeier and Moore have bene together with the Cowboys, Chargers and now Eagles. In fact, Nussmeier was the only coach that Moore brought with him to Philly when he became the offensive coordinator last offseason.\n\nEagles passing game coordinator Kevin Patullo has been linked to the Saints’ OC opening, as well as being listed as a potential replacement for Moore in Philly.\n\nWhile the Eagles had a run-heavy offense in 2024, Nussmeier seemed to forge a strong connection with Jalen Hurts, who won Super Bowl MVP.\n\nAt the defensive coordinator spot, the Saints have already interviewed Vikings DBs coach Daronte Jones and are also going to interview 49ers assistant HC Brandon Staley for the opening. While Staley might be the favorite, Parker is an attractive candidate.\n\nIn his first year with the Eagles under Vic Fangio, Parker’s defensive backs had a tremendous season. The Eagles had the No. 1 pass defense in the NFL on their way to a Super Bowl win. The Eagles got high-level play from two rookies in Quinyon Mitchell and Cooper DeJean. And the entire secondary worked in harmony this season.\n\nParker, 33, coached under Fangio in Denver in 2021 and stayed there from 2021-23 as their defensive backs coach. He previously worked for the Packers from 2019-20 as a defensive quality control coach.\n\nSubscribe to Eagle Eye anywhere you get your podcasts:\n\nApple Podcasts | YouTube Music | Spotify | Stitcher | Simplecast | RSS | Watch on YouTube",

An administration official originally said that the employee had been granted access but later clarified that the employee was expected to seek access and was not already in the system.\n\nThe IDRS allows employees to have “instantaneous visual access to certain taxpayer accounts,” according to the IRS website. The system can be used for “researching account information and requesting returns” and “automatically generating notices, collection documents and other outputs.”\n\nGet top local stories in Philly delivered to you every morning. Sign up for NBC Philadelphia's News Headlines newsletter.\n\nIDRS users “are authorized to access only those accounts required to accomplish their official duties,” according to the IRS website.\n\nThe person in question is an IRS employee who started during the second Trump administration and is affiliated with DOGE, the official confirmed. The official said the employee was carrying out the \"DOGE mission\" and acting “legally and with the appropriate security clearances.”\n\n\"Waste, fraud, and abuse have been deeply entrenched in our broken system for far too long,\" White House spokesperson Harrison Fields said when asked about the employee's potential access to the sensitive system. \"It takes direct access to the system to identify and fix it.\n\n\"DOGE will continue to shine a light on the fraud they uncover as the American people deserve to know what their government has been spending their hard-earned tax dollars on,\" Fields added.\n\nThe IRS did not immediately respond to requests for comment Sunday evening.\n\nThe move, first reported by The Washington Post, is an expansion of DOGE's efforts to access sensitive information held by the federal government.\n\nPresident Donald Trump signed a memorandum Thursday which seeks to impose \"fair and reciprocal\" trade tariffs on all major U.S. trading partners, including longtime allies.\n\nDOGE, headed by Elon Musk, has zeroed in on several government agencies and departments in an effort to cut what the administration paints as wasteful spending. DOGE has aimed to cut members of the federal workforce.\n\nNBC News has reported that DOGE has accessed the Treasury Department’s payment system, which stores sensitive information like Social Security numbers. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem also said this month that President Donald Trump authorized Musk to access FEMA disaster data.\n\nThe group has also taken aim at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the U.S. Agency for International Development.\n\nThis article first appeared on NBCNews.com.

        "fullContent": "Letters went out to dozens of probationary employees in at least one section of the Department of Transportation that said part of the reason they were being fired was for poor performance, according to a copy of the letter obtained by NBC News.\n\nBut as a source familiar and a secondary document viewed by NBC News laid out, most of those employees were rated as being “exceptional” performers by their supervisors.\n\nWe’re looking to hear from federal government workers. If you’re willing to talk with us, please email us at tips@nbcuni.com or contact us through one of these methods.\n\n“Employee has demonstrated exceptional performance and has no conduct issues,” supervisor reviews read for many of the laid-off workers.\n\nGet top local stories in Philly delivered to you every morning. Sign up for NBC Philadelphia's News Headlines newsletter.\n\n“These letters that we’re sending these employees, I feel so bad because they’re lying,” the person familiar said. “All of them, pretty much, were exceptional performers. It’s just crazy to me.”\n\nThe firings come as the Trump administration steps up its purge of the federal workforce. But they’re being done so quickly, and are often directed by people with no government experience, that agencies are having to contend with the messy fallout — which has included trying to un-fire people.\n\nOn Thursday, Office of Personnel Management officials notified agencies that they should cut loose their probationary employees, which could affect hundreds of thousands of people, according to OPM data, though the exact number of those who will be let go was not immediately clear.\n\nProbationary status has nothing to do with performance; it typically indicates someone who has been working in the federal government for less than two years — before full civil service protections kick in. It can also apply to longtime civil service workers who move to a different agency or job.\n\nRobert F. Kennedy Jr. was confirmed by the Senate as the Secretary of Health and Human Services on Thursday.\n\n“The U.S. Department of Transportation finds, that based on your performance you have not demonstrated that your further employment at the Department of Transportation would be in the public interest,” the letter to fired staffers read. “For this reason, the Department of Transportation is removing you from your position with the Department of Transportation and the federal civil service effective today.”\n\nFederal regulations state that probationary employees “shall” be terminated during the probationary period “if the employee fails to demonstrate fully his or her qualifications for continued employment.” Moreover, regulations state that “information in the notice as to why the employee is being terminated shall, as a minimum, consist of the agency’s conclusions as to the inadequacies of his performance or conduct.”\n\nA Department of Transportation spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment, nor did the White House. McLaurine Pinover, an OPM spokesperson, deferred to the Department of Transportation and said the administration would not be able to provide full details on how many probationary employees were cut across the government until Tuesday.\n\n“The probationary period is a continuation of the job application process, not an entitlement for permanent employment,” an OPM spokesperson said in an earlier statement. “Agencies are taking independent action in light of the recent hiring freeze and in support of the President’s broader efforts to restructure and streamline the federal government to better serve the American people at the highest possible standard.”\n\nWith the Trump administration seeking to cut up to 10% of the federal workforce, mass firings have at times been done in a haphazard manner. One employee at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau who was told they were fired provided NBC News with a copy of a letter informing them of their termination that did not even include their name. Instead, it was addressed to “[EmployeeFirstName] [EmployeeLastName]” and was filled with other placeholder text including “[JobTitle],” “[Division]” and “[AppointmentDate].”\n\nAnd on Friday, National Nuclear Security Administration officials sought to notify some employees who were fired the day before that they are now due to be reinstated — but struggled to find them because they didn’t have their new contact information.\n\n“The termination letters for some NNSA probationary employees are being rescinded, but we do not have a good way to get in touch with those personnel,” read an email sent to NNSA employees and obtained by NBC News.\n\nIn addition to the potential for hundreds of thousands of probationary employees to be let go, the White House has said about 75,000 people have accepted their offer of “deferred resignation” as of Wednesday, though NBC News cannot independently verify that total. The federal government employs more than 2 million workers, and their total compensation makes up about 6.6% of the overall budget.\n\nAttorney General Pam Bondi announced the Trump administration sued the state of New York due to policies that are blocking federal authorities from enforcing immigration laws.\n\nJudges have halted some of this wide-ranging effort to rapidly upend the government, though a federal judge did allow the deferred resignation program to move forward.\n\nCommenting on the legality of his administration’s actions on Saturday, President Donald Trump posted a remark on social media that has generally been attributed to the French leader Napoleon Bonaparte.\n\n“He who saves his Country does not violate any Law,” Trump wrote.\n\nThis article first appeared on NBCNews.com.

        "fullContent": "Pope Francis’ respiratory tract infection is presenting a “complex clinical picture” that will require further hospitalization, the Vatican said Monday as concerns grew about the increasingly frail health of the 88-year-old pontiff.\n\nVatican spokesman Matteo Bruni said the results of tests conducted in recent days and Monday indicate the pope is suffering from a “polymicrobial respiratory tract infection” that has necessitated a further change in his drug therapy. Scientists say polymicrobial diseases are caused by a mix of viruses, bacteria, fungi and parasites.\n\nThere was no timeframe given for his hospitalization, which has already sidelined him for longer than a 2023 hospitalization for pneumonia. Bruni said the complexity of his symptoms “will require an appropriate hospital stay.”\n\nFrancis was admitted to Rome’s Gemelli hospital in a “fair” condition on Friday after a weeklong bout of bronchitis worsened. Doctors confirmed a respiratory tract infection and prescribed “absolute rest” alongside unspecified drug therapies. Subsequent updates said his slight fever had gone away and that he was in “stable” condition.\n\nGet top local stories in Philly delivered to you every morning. Sign up for NBC Philadelphia's News Headlines newsletter.\n\nBruni said Francis, ate breakfast and read the newspapers Monday morning after a third peaceful night.\n\nThe Argentine pope, who had part of one lung removed after a pulmonary infection as a young man, is a known workaholic who keeps up a grueling pace despite his increasingly precarious health. He uses a wheelchair, walker or cane because of bad knees and suffers from sciatica nerve pain. In 2021 he had 33 centimeters (13 inches) of his colon removed because of a narrowing, and then had a further surgery in 2023 to remove intestinal scar tissue and repair an abdominal hernia.\n\nWhen he had a bad case of pneumonia in 2023, he left the hospital after three days and only acknowledged after the fact that he had been admitted urgently after feeling faint and having a sharp pain in his chest. This time around, Francis insisted on finishing his morning audiences Friday before leaving the Vatican, even though he was having trouble speaking at length because he was short of breath.\n\nFrancis' continued hospitalization has already forced the cancellation of some events connected to the Vatican's Holy Year and put others in question. The Holy See has only confirmed canceled appointments through Monday. Francis was supposed to have gone to Rome’s Cinecitta film studios to meet with artists as part of the Catholic Church’s Holy Year celebrations.\n\nThe pope's next scheduled appointment is his weekly general audience Wednesday. Beyond that, he is scheduled to preside on Sunday at the ordination of deacons as part of a Holy Year weekend dedicated to deacons. Francis' participation in both appears in doubt, but they remain on the official Vatican schedule.\n\nWhen he missed the Jubilee Mass dedicated to artists this past Sunday, a cardinal stood in for him.\n\n___\n\nMedical writer Maria Cheng contributed from London.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press religion coverage receives support through the AP’s collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

        "fullContent": "Top Russian officials will hold talks with U.S. counterparts on restoring ties, negotiating a peaceful settlement to the war in Ukraine and preparing a meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin and U.S. President Donald Trump, the Kremlin said Monday.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and Putin’s foreign affairs adviser Yuri Ushakov will fly to the Saudi capital later in the day to take part in the talks set for Tuesday.\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio will lead the U.S. delegation. Trump’s envoy Steve Witkoff told Fox News Sunday that he and national security adviser Mike Waltz also will take part in the talks.\n\nPeskov said the talks will be primarily focused on “restoring the entire complex of U.S.-Russian relations, as well as preparing possible talks on the Ukrainian settlement and organizing a meeting of the two presidents.\"\n\nGet top local stories in Philly delivered to you every morning. Sign up for NBC Philadelphia's News Headlines newsletter.\n\nSpeaking to journalists on a conference call from the United Arab Emirates on Monday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said his country won’t take part in the talks this week, adding that they would “yield no results,” given the absence of any Ukrainian officials. European governments have also demanded a role.\n\nThe talks follow last week’s telephone call between Trump and Putin in which Trump said they “agreed to have our respective teams start negotiations immediately.” The call upended years of U.S. policy, ending the isolation of Moscow over its Feb. 24, 2022, invasion of Ukraine. After the call with Putin, Trump phoned Zelenskyy to inform him about their conversation.\n\nTrump on Sunday told reporters that Zelenskyy “will be involved,” but did not elaborate.\n\nZelenskyy said he would travel to Turkey on Monday and to Saudi Arabia on Wednesday, but that his trip to the Arab nation was unrelated to planned U.S.-Russia talks there on Tuesday.\n\nAndriy Yermak, a top Zelenskyy adviser, said earlier Sunday there was no possibility of Ukrainian and Russian representatives meeting directly in the immediate future. In a Telegram post, Yermak said the Ukrainians weren’t planning to do so “until we develop a plan” to end the war and bring about a “just peace.”\n\nSpeaking on Fox News Channel’s “Sunday Morning Futures” program, Witkoff said he and Waltz will be “having meetings at the direction of the president,” and hope to make “some really good progress with regard to Russia-Ukraine.”\n\nIn his TV interview, Witkoff didn’t directly respond to a question about whether Ukraine would have to give up a “significant portion” of its territory as part of any negotiated settlement.\n\n“Those are details, and I’m not dismissive of the details, they’re important. But I think the beginning here is trust-building. It’s getting everybody to understand that this war does not belong continuing, that it should end. That’s what the president has directed us to do,” he said.",

        "source": "https://6abc.com/",
        "fullContent": "Trump administration tries to bring back fired nuclear weapons workers\n\nWASHINGTON -- The Trump administration has halted the firings of hundreds of federal employees who were tasked with working on the nation's nuclear weapons programs, in an about-face that has left workers confused and experts cautioning that DOGE's blind cost cutting will put communities at risk.\n\nThree U.S. officials who spoke to The Associated Press said up to 350 employees at the National Nuclear Security Administration were abruptly laid off late Thursday, with some losing access to email before they'd learned they were fired, only to try to enter their offices on Friday morning to find they were locked out. The officials spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation.\n\nOne of the hardest hit offices was the Pantex Plant near Amarillo, Texas, which saw about 30% of the cuts. Those employees work on reassembling warheads, one of the most sensitive jobs across the nuclear weapons enterprise, with the highest levels of clearance.\n\nThe hundreds let go at NNSA were part of a DOGE purge across the Department of Energy that targeted about 2,000 employees.\n\n\"The DOGE people are coming in with absolutely no knowledge of what these departments are responsible for,\" said Daryl Kimball, executive director of the Arms Control Association, referencing Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency team. \"They don't seem to realize that it's actually the department of nuclear weapons more than it is the Department of Energy.\"\n\nBy late Friday night, the agency's acting director, Teresa Robbins, issued a memo rescinding the firings for all but 28 of those hundreds of fired staff members.\n\nALSO SEE: IRS will lay off thousands of probationary workers in the middle of tax season\n\n\"This letter serves as formal notification that the termination decision issued to you on Feb. 13, 2025 has been rescinded, effective immediately,\" said the memo, which was obtained by the AP.\n\nThe accounts from the three officials contradict an official statement from the Department of Energy, which said fewer than 50 National Nuclear Security Administration staffers were let go, calling them \"probationary employees\" who \"held primarily administrative and clerical roles.\"\n\nBut that wasn't the case. The firings prompted one NNSA senior staffer to post a warning and call to action.\n\n\"This is a pivotal moment. We must decide whether we are truly committed to leading on the world stage or if we are content with undermining the very systems that secure our nation's future,\" deputy division director Rob Plonski posted to LinkedIn. \"Cutting the federal workforce responsible for these functions may be seen as reckless at best and adversarily opportunistic at worst.\"\n\nWhile some of the Energy Department employees who were fired dealt with energy efficiency and the effects of climate change, issues not seen as priorities by the Trump administration, many others dealt with nuclear issues, even if they didn't directly work on weapons programs. This included managing massive radioactive waste sites and ensuring the material there doesn't further contaminate nearby communities.\n\nThat incudes the Savannah River National Laboratory in Jackson, South Carolina; the Hanford Nuclear Site in Washington state, where workers secure 177 high-level waste tanks from the site's previous work producing plutonium for the atomic bomb; and the Oak Ridge Reservation in Tennessee, a Superfund contamination site where much of the early work on the Manhattan Project was done, among others.\n\nU.S. Rep. Marcy Kaptur of Ohio and U.S. Sen. Patty Murray of Washington, both Democrats, called the firings last week \"utterly callous and dangerous.\"\n\nRELATED: Elon Musk calls for US government to 'delete entire agencies'\n\nThe NNSA staff who had been reinstated could not all be reached after they were fired, and some were reconsidering whether to return to work, given the uncertainty created by DOGE.\n\nMany federal employees who had worked on the nation's nuclear programs had spent their entire careers there, and there was a wave of retirements in recent years that cost the agency years of institutional knowledge.\n\nBut it's now in the midst of a major $750 billion nuclear weapons modernization effort - including new land-based intercontinental ballistic missiles, new stealth bombers and new submarine-launched warheads. In response, the labs have aggressively hired over the past few years: In 2023, 60% of the workforce had been there five years or less.\n\nEdwin Lyman, director of nuclear power safety at the Union of Concerned Scientists, said the firings could disrupt the day-to-day workings of the agency and create a sense of instability over the nuclear program both at home and abroad.\n\n\"I think the signal to U.S. adversaries is pretty clear: throw a monkey wrench in the whole national security apparatus and cause disarray,\" he said. \"That can only benefit the adversaries of this country.\"",

        "fullContent": "Best gaming laptops from MSI, Acer and more\n\nAs a participant in multiple affiliate marketing programs, Localish will earn a commission for certain purchases. See full disclaimer below*\n\nIf you're a casual gamer you might not think you need a gaming laptop, but having one can be great for competitive gamers, streamers or anyone who spends time playing cooperatively with their friends daily. Below, you'll find the best gaming laptops at every price point, plus the features you might want to keep in mind before shopping for one.\n\nGaming laptops buying guide:\n\nScreen size and resolution: You might want a larger screen size on your gaming laptop if you're dealing with games with a lot of moving parts. That said, a larger screen size usually commands a higher price point. Below, we've highlighted gaming laptops with screen sizes of 14 and 16-inch. The resolution states how clear your picture will be. A higher resolution is preferred for competitive gamers. The below laptops have at least a Full HD resolution, but we've also included options for 4K (four times the clarity of a physical HD laptop).\n\nOperating System: An OS usually handles all the application programs on your computer, including how the RAM is managed. Windows OS 11 is the best for gaming, but you can also use Atlast OS which optimizes system performance and lowers latency.\n\nRAM: You'll want at least 16 GB of RAM on your gaming laptop. This is required to run any AAA titles (games produced by major publishers) at their native resolutions and without lags. If you're looking to stream while gaming, go higher with a 32 GB laptop.\n\nStorage: Ideally you'll want a laptop with at least 512 GB of storage. This sounds like a lot, but games are usually at least 100 GB, so with a 512 GB laptop you'll be able to store 4-5 games at a time. You can also purchase additional SSDs if you need a higher amount of storage in the short term.\n\nBest gaming laptops\n\nAmazon MSI Cyborg 14 $1099 Shop now\n\nI tested this laptop for about a month and was impressed by both its performance and design. It's surprisingly lightweight, stays cool to the touch while gaming, and has a tactile, responsive keyboard for quick feedback. There is also up to 1 TB of storage available, and the 14-inch display FHD+ display is just big and bright enough to keep track of all your in-game characters. Its fan and in-built cooling system is not that noisy either and the backlit keyboard is great for gaming after hours. I honestly love this piece of gaming equipment and think it's a great laptop for beginner and seasoned gamers alike.\n\nBest Buy ASUS - ROG Zephyrus G14 $1599 Shop now\n\nThis is a great laptop for beginners and expert gamers alike. It comes with 16 GB of RAM, a Full HD resolution, and a Windows 11 operating system for quick gameplay with no lag time. It also boasts rapid response times (the lower the response time, the quicker your laptop is) and has 1TB of in-built storage which means it's able to store a decent amount of games. It offers intelligent cooling which should also keep this pick from quickly heating up, and six speakers equipped with Domby Atmos, allowing you to use it without a pair of good-quality gaming headphones. You'll also get three months of Xbox game pass included which will give you access to 100s of free games - including new titles.\n\nAmazon Razer Blade 14 (2024) $2699.99 Shop now\n\nRazer just announced the new and thinner Razer Blade 16 at CES, but you'll have to wait for a little before you can shop that pick. In fact, most Razer laptops are currently out of stock at major retailers. That said, you can currently purchase the Razer Blade 14 - last year's release. It has 32 GB of RAM making it a strong pick, and it also carries a whole 1TB of storage. Plus, it has a Windows 11 operating system similar to some of the other picks on this list. Battery life lasts eight hours (but keep in mind that gaming laptops are notorious for fast-depleting batteries due to how heavy-duty most AAA titles are). It is also one of the lightest Razer laptops around, making it a great buy for those always on the go.\n\nAmazon HP Omen 16 $1199 Shop now\n\nHP's 2023 Omen is still a top contender. For starters, it has a wide, 16.1-inch Full HD display with an anti-glare screen so you can game wherever you are. This option also has 1 TB of storage (but the brand offers options up to 4 TB if you need it) and like the other picks on our list, a fully customizable RGB backlit keyboard and built-in speakers. It weighs around five pounds and also comes with multiple USB port options. Plus, since it has 32GB of RAM it can handle most games with ease - you can also customize it to up to 64 GB of RAM.\n\n* By clicking on the featured links, visitors will leave this site and be directed to third-party e-commerce sites that operate under different terms and privacy policies.

        "source": "https://6abc.com/",
        "fullContent": "Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency has requested access to an IRS data system that retains the personal tax information on millions of Americans, sources said.\n\nElon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency has requested access to an IRS data system that retains the personal tax information on millions of Americans, sources said.\n\nElon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency has requested access to an IRS data system that retains the personal tax information on millions of Americans, sources said.\n\nElon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency has requested access to an IRS data system that retains the personal tax information on millions of Americans, sources said.\n\nWASHINGTON -- Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency has requested access to a sensitive IRS data system that retains the personal tax information on millions of Americans, two sources familiar with the matter told ABC News.\n\nThe system, known as the Integrated Data Retrieval System, or IDRS, is used by IRS employees to review tax information, issue notices to taxpayers and update taxpayer records.\n\nAccess to the files, which is tightly controlled within the agency, had not been granted as of this weekend, several sources told ABC News.\n\nStill, the request itself is still being seen with alarm both within the government and among privacy experts who say access to Americans' private taxpayer data by Musk could be extraordinarily dangerous.\n\nMusk, estimated to be the richest man in the world, has criticized federal judges for curbing his power and called for their impeachment. Musk also has alleged without evidence or examples of wrongdoing that federal workers were defrauding taxpayers.\n\nThe IRS will lay off thousands of probationary workers in the middle of tax season, according to two sources familiar with the agency's plans, and cuts could happen as soon as next week.\n\n\"We do find it rather odd that there are quite a few people in the bureaucracy who have ostensibly a salary of a few hundred thousand dollars, but somehow managed to accrue tens of millions of dollars in net worth while they are in that position ... We're just curious as to where it came from,\" Musk told reporters on Feb. 12 while in the Oval Office with President Donald Trump.\n\nEarlier this month, DOGE employees demanded access to the Treasury Department's vast federal payment system responsible for managing trillions of dollars in government expenditures. That access triggered a lawsuit by 19 states and has been temporarily blocked by a federal judge.\n\nSources say one DOGE staffer arrived at the IRS last Thursday seeking meetings with various offices about how the IRS collects and manages data and what each business unit within the IRS does. It is not clear whether that staffer made the request to access IDRS or if it came through via the White House.\n\nThe White House did not respond to ABC News' request for comment.\n\nAccording to the Washington Post, which first reported the development, the IRS is considering a memorandum of understanding that would give DOGE officials access to several systems, including IDRS.\n\nElizabeth Laird, a former state privacy officer now with the Center for Democracy and Technology, said there are serious legal questions around DOGE accessing large data sets of information and how they are handling it. Questions include: Who exactly is accessing the government data at these agencies? Are they government employees or third-party contractors? What information are they accessing exactly and how are they using it? If they are transferring data to AI software, what are the security risks involved?\n\n\"People who share their most sensitive information with the federal government do so under the understanding that not only will it be used legally, but also handled securely and in ways that minimize risks like identity theft and personal invasion, which this reporting brings into serious question,\" Laird said.\n\nMusk and the White House have not said what federal data the DOGE team has been able to get to, or what's been done with the data that's been acquired.\n\nWhen pressed by reporters on what checks are in place to ensure Musk -- whose companies have billions of dollars in current federal contracts -- is accessing data to his advantage, the billionaire insisted that DOGE posts all of its activity on its website \"so all of our actions are maximally transparent.\" As of Sunday, the DOGE site included a list of mostly canceled government contracts and a message on its \"savings\" tab: \"Receipts coming over the weekend!\"\n\nFILE - Tesla and SpaceX Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk speaks at the SATELLITE Conference and Exhibition in Washington, Monday, March 9, 2020. AP Photo/Susan Walsh, File\n\nAccording to one person familiar with DOGE's efforts, Musk's request to access the IRS system would not allow them to change any data within it. But if granted, the access would allow unfettered access to access any person's tax filings.\n\nAccording to an IRS rulebook for the system posted online, anyone accessing IDRS is specifically not allowed to review the personal tax information of relatives, friends, neighbors or celebrities.\n\n\"IDRS users shall not access the account of any taxpayer or another IRS employee unless there is a business need and access has been formally authorized as part of the user's official duties,\" the agency states.\n\nThe policy notes: \"Willful unauthorized disclosure, access or inspection of non-computerized taxpayer records, including hard copies of returns - as well as computerized information - is a crime, punishable upon conviction, by fines, prison terms and termination of employment.\"\n\nWhile a district court judge in Manhattan has temporarily blocked DOGE's access to the Treasury Department system for now, a separate ruling by another district court judge has allowed DOGE to access data at the Department of Labor, Department of Health and Human Services, and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.\n\nABC News' Hannah Demissie contributed to this report.",

The program is a partnership between the high school and Philadelphia Academies, Inc., a longtime force in the Philadelphia education system. The goal is to inspire the next generation of Black male educators. The program launched in January with ten participating students with aims to grow each year and eventually lead to a certification that gives the students an opportunity to work in the field after graduation.

The air traffic controller was not authorized to talk to the media and spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\nSpero said messages began arriving after 7 p.m. on Friday and continued late into the night. More might be notified over the long weekend or barred from entering FAA buildings on Tuesday, he said.\n\nRELATED: Trump, without citing evidence, attacks FAA DEI initiatives during DC crash briefing\n\nThe employees were fired \"without cause nor based on performance or conduct,\" Spero said, and the emails were \"from an 'exec order' Microsoft email address\" - not a government email address.\n\nThe firings hit the FAA when it faces a shortfall in controllers. Federal officials have been raising concerns about an overtaxed and understaffed air traffic control system for years, especially after a series of close calls between planes at U.S. airports. Among the reasons they have cited for staffing shortages are uncompetitive pay, long shifts, intensive training and mandatory retirements.\n\nIn the Jan. 29 fatal crash between a U.S. Army Black Hawk helicopter and American Airlines passenger jet, which is still under investigation, one controller was handing both commercial airline and helicopter traffic at the busy airport.\n\nJust days before the collision, President Donald Trump had already fired all the members of the Aviation Security Advisory Committee, a panel mandated by Congress after the 1988 PanAm 103 bombing over Lockerbie, Scotland. The committee is charged with examining safety issues at airlines and airports.\n\nALSO SEE: Pilots, air traffic controllers flagged safety concerns at Reagan National Airport for decades\n\nOne FAA employee who was fired over the weekend suggested he was targeted for his views on Tesla and X, formerly Twitter, not as part of a general probationary-level sweep.

CLARY/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nSign up for our email newsletter to stay up-to-date on the latest local sports news throughout Philadelphia.\n\nThe NBA All-Star break could not have come sooner for the Philadelphia 76ers and their fans. Given how poorly this season has gone, it would be welcomed if the Sixers could just stay on break.\n\nA season from Hell does not even begin to describe the bad vibes that have permeated through this team since training camp. It is now mid-February, with the playoffs starting in two months, and the Sixers are somehow in a worse spot than they were when their record was 3-14 through 17 games.\n\nEvery single main character for the Sixers has played a leading role in this debacle. It starts at the top with Daryl Morey and Nick Nurse — a fish rots from the head down.\n\nTyrese Maxey got off to a rough individual start this season and, for the first time in his career, showed cracks in the armor of his effervescent personality.\n\nPaul George was supposed to be the team’s missing connector, but he has instead brought his lackadaisical “California cool” to South Philadelphia, admittedly the worst place in the country to play and act careless.\n\nAnd, of course, there is the man in the center of it all: Joel Embiid. Whether it be his own ego, organizational malpractice, or (most likely) both, he is the reason this team has no direction today, and he is the reason why it is hard to see the team have a direction in the near future.\n\nDaryl Morey\n\nDaryl Morey has always had a very specific philosophy of team building, dating back to his original trade for James Harden over a decade ago with the Houston Rockets. The greatest collection of talent often does win out in the NBA, but Morey’s hyper-fixation on acquiring superstars has left any roster he has overseen with too many holes to hoist the Larry O’Brien trophy.\n\nThis is not meant to be a referendum on Morey’s efforts. The most success of Joel Embiid’s career came with Morey building the team around him. Morey is not afraid to admit his mistakes on a transactional basis, but at some point, he has to evolve his entire line of thinking instead of throwing the same thing at the wall and hoping it sticks.\n\nPHILADELPHIA, PENNSYLVANIA – DECEMBER 15: President of basketball operations Daryl Morey participates in a press conference before a game between the Philadelphia Flyers and the Washington Capitals at the Wells Fargo Center on December 15, 2023 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. (Photo by Tim Nwachukwu/Getty Images)\n\nMorey has been here long enough to understand that Embiid is not like other superstars in the NBA. He is going to miss more time than anyone else and is a far greater injury risk than most others, as well. What Daryl Morey has done is continue to build the team as if he is on the floor every night, still dominating the league, instead of building out a roster that can stay afloat and even succeed when he is not there. For a team that has Tyrese Maxey and Paul George signed to $200-plus million contracts, that is unacceptable.\n\nNick Nurse\n\nJoel Embiid was at the peak of his basketball powers playing under Nick Nurse until he tore his meniscus last season. Nick Nurse is also, clearly, not the right coach moving forward for the Sixers. Both things can be true.\n\nNick Nurse won a championship as head coach of the Toronto Raptors behind an all-time great playoff run by Kawhi Leonard and going through a Golden State Warriors team that saw both Kevin Durant tear his Achilles tendon and Klay Thompson tear his ACL in the Finals. Kawhi Leonard then left for the Clippers, and the Raptors never found a semblance of that success again.\n\nThat is not all on Nurse, of course. Kawhi had an argument at the time for being the single most effective player in the sport on a game-to-game basis when he played. Kyle Lowry was not getting any younger either (and still is not, as Sixers fans know). The roster was incredibly clunky. However, Nick Nurse showed his hand as a coach during the Raptors’ descent, and it was overlooked for the most part when he came to Philadelphia for those aforementioned reasons.\n\nJan 4, 2025; Brooklyn, New York, USA; Philadelphia 76ers head coach Nick Nurse looks back during the first half against the Brooklyn Nets at Barclays Center. Mandatory Credit: Vincent Carchietta-Imagn Images\n\nNick Nurse needs a dominant offensive force on his roster to make up for his lack of innovation on that end of the floor. When that force leaves like Leonard or rarely suits up like Embiid, he has not shown the ability to adjust- and he has had years to figure something out. Defense is Nurse’s specialty, and even that has not been consistently good enough. His players in Toronto were tuning him out as his tenure was coming to an end, and it sure seems like that is the case here, too.\n\nTyrese Maxey\n\nIt has been a tough year for Tyrese Maxey, even as he has started to pick up his level of play these past couple of months. He was very poor offensively by his standards to start the season. He put on a lot of muscle over the summer to play more physically, and there’s been a lot of speculation that it affected his shooting stroke for a while before his body adjusted. The weight of expectations that come from signing a massive contract extension did not help either.\n\nFeb 11, 2025; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA; Philadelphia 76ers guard Tyrese Maxey (0) controls the ball against the Toronto Raptors in the first quarter at Wells Fargo Center. Mandatory Credit: Kyle Ross-Imagn Images\n\nWith Joel Embiid and Paul George both out when the season started, Maxey was not capable of carrying the team to victories on his own. As the losses piled up, so did his visible, outward frustration. That was something he had never really shown before, and it continued for the first three months of the season. To his credit, he has pulled himself out of the funk he was in, but now we know somewhere in that blinding smile is a man who is not happy with the state of affairs right now.\n\nPaul George\n\nThe larger the sample we see from Paul George, the more obvious his intentions in a Sixers uniform become. It does not matter that he has not gotten nearly as much playing time with Joel Embiid and Tyrese Maxey as he and everyone would like. It does not matter that he has been banged up a few times—including currently with a tendon issue in his finger—because everyone on the team has. What matters are his actions on the court.\n\nFeb 11, 2025; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA; Philadelphia 76ers forward Paul George (8) drives with the ball against the Toronto Raptors in the first quarter at Wells Fargo Center. Mandatory Credit: Kyle Ross-Imagn Images\n\nPaul George made it clear that he wanted to stay and end his career in his home state of California. Still, when he signed with a team as far away from California as possible for as much money as possible, he said all the right things. He had a preexisting friendship with Embiid and quickly looked to develop one with Maxey. It felt like the Sixers finally had the core in place that they wanted.\n\nAs the season has gone on, however, George has become less and less engaged. He has been bad offensively all year- sometimes that happens. But as the Sixers have continued to plummet, so have his efforts everywhere else on the court. It is reasonable to think he did not expect the vibes to be this awful, and he is also 34 years old, but it is becoming increasingly evident that he has no heart in this. Kelly Oubre and Guerschon Yabusele might not make nearly as much money, but they give a damn. Tyrese Maxey also makes significantly less money than George, and he gives a damn too.\n\nJoel Embiid\n\nWhere to even start…\n\nJoel Embiid tore his meniscus in Jan. 2024. He rushed back for the playoffs, but the Sixers were dispatched in the first round while he played physically compromised. He then played in the Olympics and won a Gold Medal. By the time training camp and the start of the NBA season roll around, he is nowhere to be found.\n\nFeb 11, 2025; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA; Philadelphia 76ers center Joel Embiid (21) reacts against the Toronto Raptors in the second quarter at Wells Fargo Center. Mandatory Credit: Kyle Ross-Imagn Images\n\nTo make matters worse, any time someone was asked about his health or his absence, nobody gave a real answer. That trend has continued literally to this day. Joel Embiid has played a total of 17 games this season. The Sixers are 8-9 in those games. Last year, in Embiid’s 39 games played, the Sixers were 31-8. Tyrese Maxey called him out in a closed-door meeting that someone decided needed to be open-door.\n\nThen Lisa Salters of ESPN reported that Embiid himself stated that he would “likely require” another surgery and an extended recovery time after the season.\n\nIf that is the case, why is Embiid playing at all? It is completely nonsensical that a player who needs knee surgery announces the need while the team does not mention the idea once and for the player to be currently suited up in an NBA basketball game the moment the public is told of this.\n\nThis is truly infuriating stuff that does not happen to any normal franchise in the NBA. These persisting issues are as much, if not more, on Joel than on the Sixers organization. Shut it all down. Destination nowhere.",

        "fullContent": "Oct 8, 2024; New York City, New York, USA; Philadelphia Phillies first baseman Bryce Harper (3) hits an RBI single in the eighth inning against the New York Mets during game three of the NLDS for the 2024 MLB Playoffs at Citi Field. Mandatory Credit: Brad Penner-Imagn Images\n\nSign up for our email newsletter to stay up-to-date on the latest local sports news throughout Philadelphia.\n\nFour months ago, the Phillies limped to an unsatisfactory conclusion to the 2024 season. After winning 95 games and earning a bye in the National League playoffs, they were clipped in the NLDS against a red-hot New York Mets team. Losing to a rival in the postseason is tough enough—but to watch them sign the biggest free agent in recent memory after the season only adds to the pressure Philadelphia’s franchise is feeling.\n\nAfter a surprising run to the World Series in 2022, followed by big spending and big expectations, they have fallen one round earlier each season since losing to the Astros 3 years ago. As the top of the National League continues to grow stronger through big spending, Philadelphia already did their spending over the last few offseasons. With a core getting closer to their mid-30s and a few key players nearing free agency, the club’s championship window is getting smaller.\n\nPhiladelphia’s infield was seemingly set before the offseason even began. While there were rumblings of potential trades involving third baseman Alec Bohm, none of those rumors turned into truth, and the Phillies will rely on their homegrown third baseman to find some consistency in his last year of team control.\n\nPSN is breaking down each position group for you to get ready for Spring Training, and today we bring you our thoughts on Philadelphia’s infield. Starters, depth options, and what they need to do to reach the promised land.\n\nPhillies Starters\n\nBarring a significant injury or a last-minute, unexpected trade, Philly’s starting infield is locked up. Bryce Harper will enter his second season as a first baseman, Bryson Stott will once again man the keystone, Trea Turner will take his place back at shortstop, and Bohm will be the everyday third baseman.\n\nHarper is the de facto captain of the offense. The two-time MVP is the best hitter in Philadelphia’s lineup and one of the best of his generation. After a few injury-marred seasons, Harper played in 145 contests during the regular season—the most since his first season donning the red pinstripes. For the first time in a long time, Bryce will have nothing major to deal with coming into a season.\n\nHe’s healthy, he isn’t learning a new position like last year, and there’s no questioning those two things in the media—it is obvious he is ready for the season and has certainly found his place on defense. After a midsummer downswing, Harper finished 2024 strong, and that carried into the playoffs. Harper will be ready to show that he’s still one of the best hitters in all of baseball.\n\nBryson Stott is entrenched as the Phillies second baseman. In his age-26 season, Stott was a finalist for the National League Gold Glove after amassing 7 Defensive Runs Saved—good for fourth among NL second basemen. After taking a big step forward offensively in 2023, Stott got off to a slow start in 2024 and never really found the rhythm he had just the year prior. His average and slugging were both down in all scenarios, but most concerning was his success against left-handed pitching all but vanished. The fourth-year player was stuck between two approaches last season, so he will focus on finding consistency during Spring Training.\n\nAug 15, 2024; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA; Philadelphia Phillies shortstop Trea Turner (7) hits a single during the first inning against the Washington Nationals at Citizens Bank Park. Mandatory Credit: Bill Streicher-USA TODAY Sports\n\nTrea Turner was signed as a superstar shortstop, and he can find himself there once again, despite his struggles defensively. Not known as a Gold Glove-caliber fielder, the Phillies likely still expected more than what the 31-year-old has given them in the field. At the end of last season, Tim Kelly from On Pattison broke down some of the $300 million man’s struggles in the field. Since joining the Phillies, Turner has -26 defensive runs saved (DRS) and -8 outs above average at shortstop. Over that two-year period, Turner has rough defensive marks no matter how you look at it:\n\nHis -26 DRS is tied for the worst mark among defenders at any position (per FanGraphs)\n\nHe’s had -8 outs above average (OAA), which is 5th worst among SS\n\nHis .960 fielding percentage ranks him the 2nd worst SS\n\n3rd in throwing errors (18)\n\n2nd in fielding errors (22)\n\n2nd in total errors (40)\n\nThe coaching staff will work with Turner on improving his defense to the levels he reached prior to joining Philadelphia. While his position isn’t changing in the field, he may find himself moving in the batting order. Manager Rob Thomson recently confirmed during an appearance on The Phillies Show podcast that changes are being discussed. When asked about switching the lineup around and possibly finding a new lead-off hitter, Thomson came up with just one name:\n\n“I think you’re probably talking about Trea [Turner],” said Thomson.\n\nMy prediction is that Turner finds himself moving to the top of the order, while Kyle Schwarber moves down to bat cleanup. In order to keep the right-left-right-left pattern, this would put Harper in the No. 2 slot in the lineup. That would likely lead to Bohm batting 3rd.\n\nSpeaking of Bohm, the aforementioned trade rumors turned out to be just that—rumors. Rob Thomson has publicly said any time he’s been asked that he spoke with his third baseman and made clear that they were not actively shopping him, but that the Phillies owed it to themselves to hear out anyone who called about him.\n\nAlec Bohm talks to @TimKellySports about his positive mindset in Spring Training. pic.twitter.com/A18Y93MZ8z — On Pattison (@OnPattison) February 13, 2025\n\nBohm was an All-Star for the first time last season. The first half of his year was great, but he struggled in the second half while dealing with a hand injury. Despite that, he led the Phillies in doubles with 44—good for 5th in the majors—and had the 2nd most RBIs on the team. Tim Kelly had the opportunity to speak to Bohm now that players have begun reporting for Spring Training. He spoke about how the injury may have lingered more than he initially thought.\n\n“When I started hitting again in the offseason, I realized that it hurt worse than I thought it had hurt,” Bohm admitted. “But I was out there playing, so I feel like if I’m out there playing, it’s not like I can’t do anything. But at the same time, I’m sure a stronger left hand would have helped somewhere, maybe.\n\nEntering his last year under Phillies team control, he will need to have a season similar to his 2024 first half for the entire season if he wants a major payday in his first crack at free agency.\n\nSep 27, 2024; Washington, District of Columbia, USA; Philadelphia Phillies shortstop Edmundo Sosa (33) turns a double play during the seventh inning against the Washington Nationals at Nationals Park. Mandatory Credit: James A. Pittman-Imagn Images\n\nPhillies Reserves\n\nThere are 2 spots that an infielder could occupy on Philly’s bench. One will most definitely be occupied by Edmundo Sosa. The utility infielder came up big for the Phillies in 2024. In early May, he filled in admirably for Turner while he dealt with an injury. Sosa had a .972 OPS in May, one of the best numbers in all of baseball that month. He will be the primary option off the bench in the infield and when needing a pinch hitter.\n\nFrom there, you have to still account for the backup catcher and Johan Rojas being an extra outfielder off the bench. That leaves one additional bench spot. Weston Wilson, Kody Clemens, Buddy Kennedy, and newly signed Christian Arroyo will compete for that final spot. The front office has expressed wanting someone who can play both infield and outfield in that position, if possible. Wilson shows the most potential with slugging ability and speed. He does, however, have minor league options remaining, which is a disadvantage for him in the race for the final bench spot. Clemens has shown over the last few seasons that he is a major-league talent.\n\nHe has options left; he would almost certainly be claimed off waivers if the Phillies decided he was not the right guy to break camp with. Kennedy is a longer shot and is a nice depth piece, but he also has no options. He would likely pass through waivers, giving the Phillies a chance to keep him around. Arroyo is a former first-round draft pick, and while he was primarily an infielder, he does have some experience in the outfield corners at the major league level. He signed a minor league deal, so unless he significantly stands out, he will likely remain as a depth option and start the year in Triple-A Lehigh Valley.\n\nMy prediction is that Kody Clemens makes the roster out of spring. He has positional flexibility and allows extra depth to be kept in the organization without risk. Regardless of who the last man is, one thing is for sure—the infield is the strength of the offense. If Bohm can find consistency, Stott can hit closer to how he did in 2023, and the depth continues to do what they’ve done the last three seasons—they will be one of, if not the best, infields in baseball.\n\nMandatory Credit: Brad Penner-Imagn Images",

        "fullContent": "Sign up for our email newsletter to stay up-to-date on the latest local sports news throughout Philadelphia.\n\nSince the Phillies first started as a professional baseball team in 1883, we have seen 25 different men hold the office of President of the United States of America. Today, in honor of President’s Day, we look and see which presidents the Phillies have performed the best under.\n\nTo keep things fair and unbiased, this list will be based on each president’s respective win percentage. Postseason success will not play a factor in determining a president’s rank in this list, so it is best to recognize the two presidents under whom the Phillies have won a World Series now: Presidents Jimmy Carter (1980) and George W. Bush (2008). If you expand that list to include World Series appearances, then the list would also include Presidents Woodrow Wilson (1915), Harry S. Truman (1950), Ronald Reagan (1983), Bill Clinton (1993), Barack Obama (2009), and Joe Biden (2022).\n\nNow with that State of the Union dealt with, let’s get to the list.\n\nNo. 5 Benjamin Harrison (1889-1892)\n\nPresident Benjamin Harrison was known as the “centennial president,” being the president 100 years after President George Washington first took office. In addition to modernizing the U.S. Navy fleet, Harrison was known for economic legislation like the McKinley Tariff and the Sherman Antitrust Act, as well as aiding in the creation of national forest reserves.\n\nUnder Harrison, the Phillies boasted a 296-252-8 record for a win percentage of .540 overall. In the days of Billy Hamilton and Ed Delahanty, these Phillies teams were a part of one of the first good eras of Philadelphia baseball. In 1892, before the days of a standardized 162-game season, the Phillies reached 80 wins for the first time as a franchise with an 87-66-2 record.\n\nNo. 4 Joe Biden (2021-2024)\n\nNext on the list is the only 21st-century president to make the top five. Anyone who is reading this article does not need a summary of Biden’s time in office, as he is only one month out of office at the time of publishing. Biden is, however, a Delaware native and a lifetime Phillies fan.\n\nWhile Biden was in office, the Phillies returned to form as one of the top powers in the National League. The Phillies reached the postseason three out of Biden’s four years in office. Led by the likes of Bryce Harper, Kyle Schwarber, Zack Wheeler, and Aaron Nola, the Phillies had a record of 354-294 (.546) under Biden.\n\nNo. 3 Grover Cleveland (1885-1888, 1893-1896)\n\nBack in the 19th century, President Grover Cleveland lost his second-term election to the No. 5 spot on this list, President Harrison, in 1888 and then proceeded to defeat Harrison when he sought re-election in 1892. During his time in office, Cleveland navigated hard times, including labor strikes, while establishing a strong executive branch with a record-breaking use of presidential vetoes.\n\nThe same general era in Phillies’ baseball as under Harrison, the Phillies thrived under Cleveland, with their only bad season coming at the end of his second term in 1896. Overall, the Phillies went 554-441-23 (.556) over Cleveland’s eight years in office. His first year in office also brought the Phillies (then the Quakers) their first no-hitter in franchise history when Charlie Ferguson defeated the Providence Grays 1-0.\n\nNo. 2 Gerald R. Ford (1974-1976)\n\nPresident Gerald Ford is an interesting one, as he is the only president to reach office without ever being elected president or vice president. Appointed as vice president under President Richard M. Nixon in December 1973 after Vice President Spiro Agnew resigned, Ford assumed the role of president in August 1974 after the resignation of Nixon. During his presidency, the Vietnam War ended, the Cold War began to creep towards its conclusion with the Helsinki Accords, and Ford controversially pardoned Nixon following the Watergate scandal. After finishing out Nixon’s second term, Ford sought election in 1976 but lost to the No. 1 president on this list.\n\nThe Phillies teams of the late 70s and early 80s made their mark and featured some of the best ballplayers in Phillies history. Steve Carlton, Bob Boone, Larry Bowa, and Tug McGraw are just some of the names that you cannot ignore when looking at these teams. And, of course, the fans of the era will never forget Harry Kalas announcing whenever Michael Jack Schmidt came to bat. We all know where this story ends, but while Ford was in office, this Phillies team went 209-164 (.560) over those two-plus seasons.\n\nAugust 7 2010: Philadelphia Phillies Hall of Famers (from left) Jim Bunning, Steve Carlton, and Mike Schmidt stand for the national anthem during alumni weekend during the New York Mets vs Philadelphia Phillies game at Citizens Bank Park in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.\n\nHonorable Mentions: The Bottom Five Presidents\n\nThere is no sense in doing a historical look at the Phils through the lens of American presidents without looking at the elephant in the room. The Phillies, as the losingest team in professional sports history, have lost 11,326 games over their 122-year lifespan. As such, the five presidents with the worst win percentages in Phillies history are as follows: Presidents Richard M. Nixon (in office 1969-1974, .427 win percentage), Calvin Coolidge (1923-1928, .357), Franklin D. Roosevelt (1933-1944, .354), Warren G. Harding (1921-1923, .350), and Chester A. Arthur (1883-1884, .269).\n\nNo. 1 Jimmy Carter (1977-1980)\n\nRecently deceased President Jimmy Carter tops the list. Having narrowly defeated the incumbent President Ford in the 1976 election, Carter’s time in office included the negotiations of the Camp David Accords and the Panama Canal Treaties along with creating the Departments of Energy and Education. Abroad he also had to deal with crises such as the Soviets invading Afghanistan and the Iranian revolution.\n\nThe likes of Pete Rose, Manny Trillo, and Bake McBride joined an already strong lineup as the Fightin’ Phils tried to win their first World Series. Carter’s first two years in office featured the Phillies’ second and third consecutive appearances in the National League Championship Series. Then, after a down year in 1979, the Phillies brought home the pennant in 1980, defeating the Kansas City Royals in six games. Tug McGraw earned the save in Game Six, and Mike Schmidt was named World Series MVP.\n\nWhat Does This Mean for the Phillies Now?\n\nFrom his first term, the Phils have been 255-291 (.467) under President Donald J. Trump, putting Trump squarely in the middle of the pack in the context of this list. The current Phillies team still ranks among the top in the league, but the question remains: how long will the Phillies be able to sustain their success with the core team members aging?\n\nTo date, the Phillies have only won a World Series in an election year, so either the Phillies will need to break that streak, or the Phillies’ next chance to claim their championship parade will not be until 2028.",

        "fullContent": "Sign up for our Daily Email newsletter to stay up-to-date on the latest local news throughout Philadelphia.\n\nAhead of the band’s upcoming performance at the Keswick Theater, Travis frontman Fran Healy sat down with Metro to discuss the band’s most recent album, ‘L.A. Times’, their creative process as innovators, and the experience of live music.\n\nYour latest album, ‘L.A. Times’ — can you break down its inspiration?\n\nIt was me venting about LA and having lived there for eight years. And just like I was like, ‘That’s enough, [I] can’t take any more.’ The whole album was written while I lived in LA, and song-wise, I would say there’s a bit of everything. There’s a lot of reflection and a lot of looking back. But, honestly, [when] writing songs, your entire experience kind of comes out in a song. If you’re writing in a proper way, which is just like digging until you find something, you bring it to the surface, and it starts to become something.\n\nThe first song is me looking back to Glasgow, waiting on a bus, and then this metaphor of a bus being like life, your kind of mortality. It’s a bit deep, but I’m thinking about it. I’m 51, I’m a father. So I’m thinking about stuff like that. Song two is called ‘Raze The Bar,’ which is about this brilliant bar in New York. It’s got nothing to do with LA, but I think living in LA has made me really long for everything outside of LA. So I’m thinking about New York and the third song, it’s a breakup song, looking at my relationship with my ex, looking at my relationship with my son.\n\nAnd then the fourth song is ‘Gaslight,’ which is just a song about being gaslit for quite a while and getting emancipation, that sort of thing, fighting back against those a–holes. I think there’s been a lot of the tectonic movement in my life, emotional plates moving big, big, big things happening, people dying, people leaving, weeding the garden, so to speak, and then coming out the other side of it and this record sort of chronicles all of that sort of movement.\n\nYou’ve said that for you, the process is not to write songs for charts but to write based on life. Can you delve into that a bit?\n\nEvery song [I’ve ever written] is about something. There’s about 5% of our business that, I would say, innovates. And I think a lot of music, that 95% of music in the charts, is that other type of music. When Travis got massive, like no one even knew we existed, and then suddenly, the next year, we were so different than everything else that everything else had to change to fit in with us. So you find all these bands suddenly sounding like you. We were part of the 5% that just does its thing and, just by chance, became popular, and then the whole business then goes, Oh, we gotta sound like this because this is popular.\n\nSo they all follow; it’s like the flock follows whatever it is. And so I’ve never stopped writing like that. So when we’re suddenly very popular, then suddenly The Strokes come along, I’m not going to suddenly sound like The Strokes just to be popular. That just so goes against the grain of what I’m about. We’re not that kind of band. But again, bands that I love are bands like us that are the 5% bands that just cut their own; they cut their own [teeth]. And I think it’s maybe a little bit more interesting than someone who or a writer who is constantly just trying to stay in fashion…\n\nAuthenticity is one big thing for us. Just be who you are, no matter what that is. Two, art because we all went to art school. We’re an art school band. And three mischief. I’m not so cheeky in real life. I can be, but I’m much more so on the stage… And so we decided that everything we put out has to have those three things in it. And there’s a fourth thing, which is storytelling. It’s a big part of what we do. And the live shows really encapsulated all of those elements together.\n\nThis seems to parallel a lyric by My Morning Jacket from the song ‘Wordless Chorus,’ which says “We are the innovators, they are the imitators. ” Does it seem to be that same type of idea?\n\nThat’s the perfect comparison, yeah, Jim [James] is amazing.\n\nWhat can fans coming to see Travis expect, and why should they be excited?\n\nLet’s talk about My Morning Jacket for a second and not talk about Travis as an example. You listen to ‘Z’ (the album that features ‘Wordless Chorus’), if you listen to it, and that’s the band in a studio playing as much live, hopefully as possible, and then you turn it up on your stereo, and to get the heavy guitars louder, to get the experience that’s like 1% of of the band you’re getting.\n\nIn order to completely get that band, you have to go and see them live. You have to go and stand at the feet of Jim James and hear his roar, watch the guitar, just see the way the guitarist runs across the stage. And that’s where music really resides. I mean, it really is. Seeing a band live is, that’s it. You get the whole DNA of everything and albums, not to knock albums, because albums are art pieces in themselves, but if you really want to get into a band or understand the band.\n\n[Travis is] very artistic. We’re very silly up front, not silly, but entertaining on stage and we’re serious as well. And have quite a lot to say. But it’s cool, it’s just real. And it’s, there’s no backing tracks or anything, and it’s like four guys just f–king hitting their s–t out their instruments and making something out of it.\n\nCatch ‘Travis’ at the Keswick Theater on Tuesday, Feb. 18, for more information, visit keswicktheatre.com",

        "source": "https://metrophiladelphia.com/",
        "fullContent": "NYCFC has put the finishing touches on its preseason preparations, closing out the Coachella Valley Invitational on a hopeful note.\n\nThe men in blue had a productive time in California, doubling down on manager Pascal Jansen’s ‘bulletproof’ mentality and fine-tuning their tactical systems.\n\nAhead of the team’s highly-anticipated season opener against Inter Miami, the Pigeons have solidified their formational flexibility, learned how to navigate out of uncomfortable situations, and shown promise in the attacking build-up phase.\n\nHere are three takeaways from NYCFC’s last two matches at Coachella.\n\nNYCFC embraces organized chaos with fluid attack\n\nThroughout the tournament, NYCFC played variations of the 4-3-3 or 4-2–3-1 formations. These two systems allow the squad to have attacking fluidity while maintaining a defensive spine of two midfielders.\n\nDuring the team’s last two games against St. Louis City and Minnesota United, the men in blue looked comfortable with the positional flexibility, finding moments in transition where the forward, wingers, and attacking midfielder all interchanged positions.\n\nAccording to Jansen, this freedom in the attacking third is intentional, purposely making it difficult for the opposition defense to man-mark his players.\n\n“We want to be unpredictable and surprising,” Jansen told reporters earlier in preseason. “We like direct attacks and getting in behind opponents. We want to be predictable to ourselves, but unpredictable to our opponents.”\n\nOrganized chaos is an appropriate name to call NYCFC’s new style. It remains to be seen if the team can implement this tactic quickly, but at Coachella, Jansen’s men took the first steps in making his vision a reality.\n\nWho replaces Santiago Rodriguez?\n\nAccording to Tom Bogert of GiveMeSport, star forward Santiago Rodriguez is set to leave the club to join Brazilian side Botafogo.\n\nRodriguez, 25, has been a stud for NYCFC since 2021, racking up a combined amount of 62 goals and assists in 144 appearances for the team. When the Uruguayan departs, it will leave a gaping hole in the squad’s attack.\n\nAlthough Rodriguez’s departure does hurt the team, there are various attacking options at Jansen’s disposal. Forwards Agustin Ojeda, Mounsef Bakrar, and Alonso Martinez now have the opportunity to step up in Rodriguez’s absence.\n\nSimilar to how the club adjusted after midfielder James Sands’s departure to St. Pauli, Jansen is banking on the budding chemistry between the existing roster players to compensate for the loss of Rodriguez’s talent.\n\nSpeaking to the media before their last game against Minnesota, Jansen specifically singled out Bakrar and Martinez to lead the offensive line in 2025.\n\n“We’re looking for a collaboration between [Alonso Martinez] and [Mounsef Bakar],” the former AZ Alkmaar boss said.\n\n“You use the word chemistry, which is very important because you have to feel each other out as attackers. Both of them are good as a [striker], but both of them are able to score a lot of goals.”\n\nWhile Rodriguez’s move away creates a challenge, Jansen’s system thrives on a group effort rather than individual brilliance. If Bakrar and Martinez can build on their strengths, NYCFC’s attack could be a force to be reckoned with in 2025.\n\nGearing up for a tough season opener\n\nAs NYCFC’s pre-season comes to an end, the real test begins.\n\nOn Feb. 22, the Pigeons will take on the reigning Supporters Shield holders, Inter Miami.\n\nMiami, led by the likes of Lionel Messi, Jordi Alba, Sergio Busquets, and Luis Suarez, will be a tough test for a City side that wants to improve upon its sixth-place finish in the Eastern Conference last season.\n\nWhen asked about the season opener, Jansen put all his faith in the team’s pre-season preparations.\n\n“This is the moment we’re preparing for. Once we started on [day one of pre-season], we mentioned the 22nd of February as the moment to be ready as a team,” the 52-year-old told reporters. “So, we’re progressing every day, and we’ll be ready [once the 22nd comes around], in order to be competing in MLS.”\n\nMiami is coming off a long-winded preseason tour that included stops in South and Central America. Additionally, the Herons will start their CONCACAF Champions Cup campaign on Tuesday, leaving them with just four days of rest before playing NYCFC.\n\nWhatever the outcome of the match is, one thing is clear: Thanks to Coachella, the men in blue will be ready.\n\nFor more on NYCFC, visit AMNY.com",

        "source": "https://metrophiladelphia.com/",
        "fullContent": "A missing poster is displayed on a telephone pole along a closed section of Kensington Avenue as police begin clearing a homeless encampment on May 8, 2024 in Philadelphia.\n\nSign up for our Daily Email newsletter to stay up-to-date on the latest local news throughout Philadelphia.\n\nAfter nearly a decade of almost year-over-year increases in overdose deaths, the tide may finally be turning in Philadelphia.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced in May 2024 an estimated 3% decrease in overdose deaths in the U.S. in 2023 compared with 2022. Shortly after, data from the Philadelphia Department of Public Health showed a similar trend: Fatal overdoses across the city decreased 7% in 2023, from 1,207 to 1,122. The city is expected to release its 2024 data in the spring of 2025.\n\nWhile these declines are notable, the city’s 2023 fatal overdose numbers are three times higher than they were in 2013.\n\nStill, if 2024 numbers confirm the downward trend, it allows a little hope into an otherwise bleak epidemic that is killing more Philadelphians than homicides, car accidents and diabetes combined.\n\nSomething may finally be working. But what?\n\nIf over a decade spent treating and researching substance use disorders has taught me anything, it’s that the overdose epidemic is what researchers and policymakers refer to as a wicked problem. Wicked problems are constantly changing, complex, interconnected knots of other problems with no clear solution.\n\nBut let’s look at what we do know about how overdose deaths in Philadelphia spiked in the first place – and why they may finally be decreasing.\n\nWhy overdose deaths spiked\n\nThe first wave of the overdose epidemic began in the late 1990s and is attributed to overprescription of opioid pain medicines. But the largest acceleration in deaths didn’t occur until after the government and health insurers implemented prescribing controls in the early 2010s. These controls led many people who were no longer able to get prescribed opioids to turn to illicit heroin.\n\nIn a phenomenon known as the “iron law of prohibition,” stricter drug law enforcement led drug-trafficking organizations to shift from heroin toward more powerful synthetic opioids that are easier to produce, conceal and distribute. Gram for gram, pure fentanyl is over 50 times stronger than pure heroin.\n\nBut street-obtained fentanyl has proven to be anything but pure.\n\nLocal drug-testing efforts found as much as a fiftyfold difference in potency between bags of fentanyl that appear identical.\n\nThis unpredictable potency is considered to be the chief contributor to the deadliness of street fentanyl. It’s like cracking a beer and not knowing whether drinking it will get you mildly buzzed or send you to the graveyard.\n\nResearch suggests drug busts, though touted as improving public safety, can lead to more inconsistency and unpredictability in the potency of illicit opioids. An analysis of 14 studies conducted in the U.S. demonstrated a marked increase in fatal overdoses following the supply disruptions that result from drug seizures.\n\nThere’s also some evidence that the heightened economic insecurity and despair caused by the COVID-19 pandemic may have intensified the fatal overdose epidemic.\n\nPotential reasons for decline\n\nJust as economic insecurity was associated with rising deaths, the subsequent economic recovery as the U.S. emerged from the pandemic may have contributed to the 2023 drop in overdose fatalities nationwide.\n\nHowever, the unequal distribution of that recovery seems to track with worsening racial disparities in overdose rates in the late 2010s to early 2020s.\n\nAnother possible explanation for the reduction in overdose deaths is the increasing availability of buprenorphine.\n\nBuprenorphine, an FDA-approved medication for opioid use disorder, reduces withdrawal and cravings for fentanyl. What’s more, it decreases overdose risk by more than 50%.\n\nHowever, efforts to increase access to this medication have stagnated. National prescribing rates for buprenorphine were relatively stable from 2019 to 2023, and the CDC estimates that only a quarter of those who need treatment are getting it. Efforts to make buprenorphine available without a prescription have not yet gained traction.\n\nAccess to and education around naloxone, a lifesaving drug used to reverse opioid overdoses, has also increased, and the drug is increasingly being administered by bystanders. Over 1.3 million doses were distributed in Pennsylvania since 2017. National research suggests these distribution efforts, often spearheaded by local harm-reduction organizations, have led to quicker administration of naloxone. This saves lives while also decreasing reliance on emergency medical services.\n\nFinally, the consequences of a seemingly minor characteristic of fentanyl’s pharmacology might also be reducing the overdose death rate in Philadelphia.\n\nFentanyl’s effects last only a third as long as heroin. This shorter duration led drug traffickers to add the animal tranquilizer xylazine – also called “tranq” – and the veterinary anesthetic medetomidine into Philadelphia’s street drug supply. In 2019, two-thirds of heroin or fentanyl sampled in Philadelphia had xylazine in it. By 2021 all of it did.\n\nThese additives lengthen the duration of the effect, mitigate withdrawal symptoms and possibly reduce the amount of fentanyl needed per dose. Some evidence from animal studies shows that xylazine reduces fentanyl intake by suppressing fentanyl withdrawal, thereby lengthening the time before a person uses again.\n\nWhat’s more, the skin wounds and sedative effects that are associated with xylazine may be motivating some people to avoid using street fentanyl.\n\nWhat’s next for Philadelphia\n\nThe opioid settlement, a multibillion-dollar payment from the pharmaceutical industry to resolve legal actions against them, has led to increased funding in Philadelphia for naloxone and medications such as buprenorphine to treat opioid use disorder.\n\nHowever, in the past year the city eliminated funding for needle exchanges and implemented compulsory treatment strategies, which research suggests often do not reduce drug use or criminal recidividism.\n\nMeanwhile, at the federal level, Republican members of Congress have proposed cuts to Medicaid, the health insurance program for low-income Americans.\n\nWhether new data, when it’s released, will show overdose deaths in Philly have continued to decline or are back on the rise is anybody’s guess. But I do know that harm-reduction advocates, medical providers and communities of people who use drugs will continue to fight this epidemic as if their lives depend on it. For many, it does.\n\nBen Cocchiaro is an Assistant Clinical Professor of Family Medicine and Community Health at Drexel University.",

        "fullContent": "President Donald Trump listens to Robert F. Kennedy Jr. in the Oval Office of the White House, on the day Kennedy is sworn in as secretary of Health and Human Service in Washington, D.C., U.S., February 13, 2025.\n\nSign up for our Daily Email newsletter to stay up-to-date on the latest local news throughout Philadelphia.\n\nRobert F. Kennedy Jr. has been confirmed as the secretary of the US Health and Human Services Department. Put simply, this makes him the most influential figure in overseeing the health and wellbeing of more than 330 million Americans.\n\nAs health secretary, Kennedy will be involved in overseeing federal health agencies that regulate medical research, disease prevention, drug approvals and health-care programs.\n\nThis includes oversight of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the Food and Drug Administration and the National Institutes of Health, which are among the most crucial public health agencies in the country.\n\nReports suggest he’ll oversee a budget in the order of $1.8 trillion annually.\n\nIn the era of Trump 2.0, there’s little that shocks me anymore. But Kennedy would have to be the most unqualified person ever to hold this crucial role of protecting the health of the American people.\n\nA history of discounting science\n\nThe absolute minimum requirement for someone occupying such as role should be an understanding of science and respect for scientific evidence and expertise. Yet, Kennedy fails spectacularly in this regard.\n\nHere are just some of the false claims he has made over the years:\n\nKennedy has suggested Lyme disease is likely to be an engineered bioweapon\n\nHe reportedly said 99% of COVID deaths occurred in people with vitamin D deficiencies\n\nHe has questioned the role of HIV in causing AIDS.\n\nNone of these positions has even the smallest amount of scientific support.\n\nIt’s hard to predict what Kennedy will do as health secretary, especially given his confirmation hearings looked to be an exercise in being vague, evasive and denying or downplaying his prior controversial statements to secure support.\n\nBut there are three areas where his views are fairly clear and his appointment could be expected to have a significant impact. These are water fluoridation, infectious diseases research and vaccines.\n\nFluoridation of water\n\nKennedy has been a long-term opponent of water fluoridation, despite its proven benefits in preventing tooth decay. He has consistently questioned its safety and claimed it’s linked to a range of illnesses such as arthritis, bone cancer, IQ loss and neurodevelopmental disorders.\n\nWhile a recent review suggested a link between water fluoridation and lower IQ in children, the levels of fluoride in the water in countries included in this review were generally several times higher than the levels in public water fluoridation programs in countries such as the US and Australia. There were also other limitations that make interpreting these findings challenging.\n\nThe CDC has identified community water fluoridation as as one of the ten great public health achievements of the 20th century. And it continues to benefit dental health today, without any convincing evidence of possible harms.\n\nNonetheless, it seems likely that in keeping with his longstanding views one of Kennedy’s first priorities will be to try to halt water fluoridation in the US.\n\nInfectious diseases\n\nAlongside his confirmation as health secretary, US President Donald Trump signed an executive order establishing “The President’s Commission to Make America Healthy Again”, with Kennedy as the chair.\n\nThe Make America Healthy Again movement (MAHA) is an initiative driven by Kennedy focusing on improving nutrition, increasing transparency in medical practices and reducing the corporate influence in health.\n\nThough premised primarily on combating chronic diseases, the movement also embraces skepticism of established medical practices, unproven alternative therapies and a general mistrust of institutions.\n\nWhat’s more, Kennedy’s focus on chronic diseases seems to be coming at the expense of continued work on infectious diseases.\n\nHe has proposed directing the National Institutes of Health to pause infectious disease research for eight years to prioritize research into chronic diseases and alternative treatments.\n\nAs health secretary, Kennedy has the power to shift research priorities. If he were to effectively halt infectious diseases research – in the wake of COVID and with a looming threat of future pandemics – this would be catastrophic for the US and global health.\n\nVaccine scepticism\n\nRelated to infectious diseases, there’s little doubt the area in which Kennedy has done the most damage relates to vaccines.\n\nHe has dedicated a large part of his life to undermining public confidence in vaccines. This is despite overwhelming scientific evidence demonstrating their safety and effectiveness, and the millions of lives they’ve saved.\n\nAlthough he has subsequently denied it, Kennedy is on record as falsely stating there is no such thing as a safe and effective vaccine. Notably, he has continued to push the debunked claim that the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine is linked to autism, despite the single study finding this having been widely discredited.\n\nKennedy’s frequent assertion that he’s not anti-vaccine, but “pro-safety”, is also deeply disingenuous. Being “pro-safety” is a deliberately vague notion designed to appear reasonable while at the same time undermining the scientific evidence.\n\nThe impact of Kennedy’s appointment as health secretary on vaccine confidence will not just be limited to the US. Vaccine hesitancy has been recognized as one of the greatest threats to public health. Having a vaccine sceptic leading the US health agencies has the potential to harm vaccine uptake worldwide.\n\nAs we’ve seen during the COVID pandemic, producing a vaccine is only half the battle. Convincing people to take it is just as important. There’s no doubt Kennedy’s influence on public health messaging could further erode vaccine confidence at a time when vaccine messaging must be clear.\n\nBad news for the US and the world\n\nOne of the reasons Kennedy poses such a threat to public health in the US and globally is his lack of trust in science. He believes a narrative can be crafted by picking and choosing any study that fits with his world view, regardless of its quality.\n\nIn addition, he personifies the bad-faith tactics of conspiracy theorists globally, “selling” the flawed premise that any assertion is valid until others prove it false.\n\nWhat the world needs now is a safe pair of hands leading public health in the US. Someone who is guided by evidence – not someone who promotes anti-science propaganda and conspiracy theories.\n\nHassan Vally is an Associate Professor of Epidemiology at Deakin University.",

        "source": "https://metrophiladelphia.com/",
        "fullContent": "Sign up for our email newsletter to stay up-to-date on the latest local sports news throughout Philadelphia.\n\nBuckle up, Union fans. Today is the last Monday without Philadelphia Union soccer until at least mid-October, and I’m happy to announce that I’ll be back covering the team’s journey through the MLS season for the 3rd consecutive year – for better or for worse.\n\n2025 marks the first season with new Head Coach Bradley Carnell at the helm, and there are still a few questions that need answering heading into a season that could have big implications for the club’s future direction. Let’s take a look at a few of those before Union’s first match of the 2025 season on Saturday night in Orlando.\n\nImage Credit: Philadelphia Union\n\n1) Carnell’s preferred starting XI and formation\n\nCarnell used several main formations during his time with St. Louis – 4-2-3-1, 4-2-2-2, and a 4-4-2 diamond, to name a few. Given the personnel and the fact that these players were familiar with a 4-4-2 diamond formation under the previous manager, Jim Curtin, I would favor Carnell rolling out the team in that type of setup, though I wouldn’t be entirely shocked by a 4-2-2-2.\n\nI’m taking a stab at it, but here’s my best guess as to how things would be lined up in a 4-4-2 diamond on Saturday night – given everyone is healthy and ready to go\n\nGK: Andre Blake\n\nRB: Nate Harriel, CB:Jakob Glesnes, CB: Ian Glavinovich, LB: Kai Wagner\n\nCDM: Jovan Lukić\n\nRCM: Quinn Sullivan, LCM: Danley Jean-Jacques\n\nCAM: Daniel Gazdag\n\nST: Mikael Uhre, Tai Baribo\n\nImage Credit: Philadelphia Union\n\n2) Will Carnell be able to make adjustments?\n\nFrom the small bits of pre-season action we’ve had access to, it’s clear Carnell is going to play Ernst Tanner’s desired style of Red-Bull-inspired soccer, which implements an over-the-top intense high-press that Carnell hopes will result in a 60-30-10 split on the attacking end – 60% of goals scored coming from transition, 30% from set pieces, and just 10% from possession.\n\nBut what happens when the Union plays a well-organized, low-block defensive team that forces them to play with the ball and create opportunities? What happens when Union goes down 1-0 early in the game, and the other team parks the bus? Will Carnell be able to adjust and tweak the squad to bring a different look to the pitch to try and change the game? Or will this Union team struggle to adjust and play with flexibility like they did under Jim Curtin at times?\n\nNov 2, 2024; Chester, Pennsylvania, USA; General view of Subaru Park before the game between Philadelphia Union II and Columbus Crew 2. Mandatory Credit: Caean Couto-Imagn Images\n\n3) Who’s the first player off the bench?\n\nIt’s been an issue each of the last two seasons – who do Union turn to on the bench to change the game when it’s not going the way they want?\n\n37-year-old veteran Midfielder Ale Bedoya will likely be one of the first players Bradley Carnell turns to on the bench this season. Bedoya registered 2 goals and 4 assists in just under 1,500 MLS minutes last season and showed he still had it in him to impact games both in the starting XI and off the bench, but I don’t think he should be depended on as the main guy to come off the bench and get you a goal when it’s needed most.\n\nAlternatively to Bedoya’s veteran presence, 2025 will be the season of introducing Union’s youth to the big stage. Players like Cavan Sullivan, Jeremy Rafanello, CJ Olney, and David Vazquez will likely get opportunities to make an impact off the bench as well in 2025.\n\nAnd, of course, once the signing of Bruno Damiani is finalized, which seems to be all but official at this point, the Union will have 3 MLS-ready strikers in their arsenal. I’d expect Damiani to start on the bench while he gets acclimated, but I wouldn’t be surprised to see him eventually take one of the starting spots, moving either Mikael Uhre or Tai Baribo to the bench and giving Union more solid options to bring on late in the game.\n\nImage Credit: Philadelphia Union\n\n4) Can the new boys hit the ground running?\n\nOne factor in Union’s success this season is how quickly the new signings can transition into the group and start making an impact on the field. Centerback Ian Glavinovich and Midfielder Jovan Lukić are two names that look set to claim spots in the starting XI right off the bat, with rumored striker signing Bruno Damiani hoping to do the same upon his arrival and acclimation.\n\nIn positive news for Union, Ian Glavinovich has gotten to attend a majority of pre-season training with his new club and head coach, with Jovan Lukić joining the team in the later portion of pre-season. That’s on top of Danley Jean-Jacques, who made his Union debut in the middle of the 2024 season, getting his first full pre-season with Union and a new manager under his belt. Those 3 having a smooth pre-season will be a huge factor in how quickly Union starts the season.\n\nAug 28, 2024; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA; Columbus Crew midfielder Alexandru Matan (20) plays the ball defended by Philadelphia Union midfielder Danley Jean Jacques (21) in the first half at Subaru Park. Mandatory Credit: Eric Hartline-USA TODAY Sports\n\n5) What exactly are the expectations for this team in 2025?\n\n2025 will be the Union’s first season with a new manager in charge in almost a decade, and it comes after missing the playoffs for the first time since 2017. So the big question is, what are the expectations surrounding this team in 2025, and how short is Bradley Carnell’s leash?\n\nI don’t think silverware is realistically on the mind of many Union fans heading into 2025, but surely, getting back into a playoff spot will be one of the main goals for the Blue and Gold this season. With 62% of the league able to qualify for postseason play, it has to be. But what if they don’t?\n\nI think it would be harsh to move on from Carnell after one season unless things go horribly, horribly wrong. But at the same time, Carnell is hand-picked by Ernst Tanner for Ernst Tanner’s style of soccer. The players brought in during the last 2 windows are players that fit Ernst Tanner’s style of play. The team will undoubtedly, and maybe even to a fault at times, play the style of soccer that Ernst Tanner has spent time and money building the entire organization around over the last few years.\n\nIf things start to head in the right direction and eventually it all works out, Union fans will all be singing praises about Ernst Tanner and the vision he’s brought to the club, and they should. But if it doesn’t work out, and the Union fails to make the playoffs again, who falls on the sword this time?\n\nSep 28, 2024; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA; Philadelphia Union defender Nathan Harriel (26) celebrates with teammates after scoring a goal against Atlanta United in the second half at Subaru Park.

        "fullContent": "Sign up for our email newsletter to stay up-to-date on the latest local sports news throughout Philadelphia.\n\nPitchers and catchers have all made their way down to beautiful Clearwooder for their spring training preparation. We are that much closer to baseball season, meaning we’re so close to hearing “BEER, BEER, BEER, BEER, BEEEEEEER” on our televisions for a month.\n\nThe Phillies were relatively quiet this offseason and lost pitchers Jeff Hoffman (Blue Jays) and Carlos Estévez (Royals) to free agency. Fans have questions about the roster, and we have answers! I teamed up with fellow Philadelphia Sports Network writer Shaun Nestor to answer some of those questions.\n\nWhich Phillies reliever will lead the team in saves at the end of the year?\n\nKylee: I’ll have to go with Orion Kerkering. Before I go into this, I want to make it clear I have a ton of faith in Jordan Romano. I just believe Kerkering will take that big of a leap forward and be the backbone that the Phillies need following Jeff Hoffman’s departure to Toronto.\n\nShaun: This may not be the popular answer, but I think Jordan Romano does the job there. Especially in Rob Thomson’s system of “bullpen by committee,” Romano’s experience will get him the bulk of the action while Jose Alvarado, Orion Kerkering, Matt Strahm, and others get their time in the 9th as well.\n\nPredict a Phillies trade deadline addition\n\nKylee: I think the Phillies will go after a relief pitcher. I don’t think it’ll be a high-end reliever because I believe Romano and Kerkering will take over, but more options in relief can’t possibly do any harm.\n\nShaun: You know, nothing stands out as a huge need to be filled at the trade deadline yet to me. But I’m going to go out on a limb here: a package likely involving one of Miller, Crawford, or Tait to the Brewers for Devin Williams and Rhys Hoskins. Spicy enough for you?\n\nAug 15, 2024; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA; Philadelphia Phillies outfielder Johan Rojas (18) hits an RBI single during the fourth inning against the Washington Nationals at Citizens Bank Park. Mandatory Credit: Bill Streicher-USA TODAY Sports\n\nAre there any position battles in camp?\n\nKylee: The obvious one is centerfield with Brandon Marsh and Johan Rojas, but you could argue the closer role has a position battle. As it stands, Jordan Romano is expected to have the Jeff Hoffman/main closer role, but I wouldn’t be surprised to see Orion Kerkering have a shot at the spot if Romano starts slow.\n\nShaun: If anything, Brandon Marsh and Johan Rojas will battle for the center field job, but I fully expect that to remain at the status quo with a platoon.\n\nWhat prospects not named Andrew Painter can you see getting called up this season?\n\nKylee: I would be very shocked to see Justin Crawford and Aidan Miller up this season. Dave Dombrowski already said he sees Miller as a 2026 at-best guy. With that in mind, I would expect to see Mick Abel up at some point. I don’t think he’ll make it right out of camp, but I see it happening by the trade deadline.\n\nShaun: Technically I expect Mick Abel will make the Phillies bullpen out of camp, but that’s not really what this question is asking. If anything, I would expect Jean Cabrera, Seth Johnson, or Griff McGarry to come up at some point to fill in for an injury here or there, but I wouldn’t get my hopes up for Aidan Miller or Justin Crawford just yet.\n\nMandatory Credit: Jonathan Dyer-Imagn Images",

        "fullContent": "A view of the Stonewall Inn from Christopher Park, which is also the home of the Stonewall National Monument.\n\nSign up for our Gay City News email newsletter to get news, updates, and local insights delivered straight to your inbox!\n\nCommunity members protested at Christopher Park on Feb. 14 after the National Park Service removed references to transgender individuals from its online website, representing just the latest example of the Trump administration’s overwhelming quest to erase transgender individuals from American life.\n\n“Before the 1960s, almost everything about living openly as a lesbian, gay, bisexual (LGB) person was illegal,” the National Park Service’s website says, as of the morning of Feb. 14. “The Stonewall Uprising on June 28, 1969 is a milestone in the quest for LGB civil rights and provided momentum for a movement.”\n\nThe move, which involved deleting TQ+ from LGBTQ+, appeared to align the National Park Service with President Donald Trump’s blatantly transphobic executive order recognizing only male and female genders according to an individual’s gender assigned at birth.\n\nThe Stonewall National Monument is located within Christopher Park and was designated in 2016 by former President Barack Obama as the first federal monument dedicated to the LGBTQ community.\n\nThe updates to the National Park Service’s website immediately prompted widespread anger from community members and elected officials, leading to the Christopher Park demonstration.\n\n“I’m not going to allow any government, any organization, any person to take away the joy that I feel as a trans person,” Berne Wagenblast, who is one of the voices of the New York City subway system. Wagenblast delighted the crowd by repeating one of her most-heard lines: “Please stand away from the platform edge.”\n\nOut gay State Senator Brad Hoylman-Sigal, who represents the area encompassing the Stonewall Inn, said the decision to remove trans references from the website amounts to “one of the darkest moments in American history.”\n\nHoylman-Sigal said the Trump administration is seeking to rewrite history and discriminate against an entire population of Americans.\n\n“This decision cannot stand,” Hoylman-Sigal stated, adding: “I pledge to continue to work harder than ever to further enshrine the rights of transgender New Yorkers in state and city law.”\n\nAnother out gay lawmaker, Councilmember Erik Bottcher, who also represents the area around the Stonewall Inn, similarly blasted the move.\n\n“Trump is trying to erase the very existence of transgender people,” Bottcher wrote on X. “He’s trying to cleave our community apart and divide us. He’s not going to succeed. Lesbians and gays are not going to abandon our transgender siblings. We are one community.”\n\nNew York Gov. Kathy Hochul also criticized the change, describing it as “cruel and petty.”\n\n“Transgender people play a critical role in the fight for LGBTQ+ rights — and New York will never allow their contributions to be erased,” Hochul wrote on X.\n\nSenator Chuck Schumer of New York, the minority leader, said, “This move to try to erase transgender people from the Stonewall National Monument is cruel, pathetic, and historically inaccurate. Transgender New Yorkers played a critical role in the events at Stonewall and in the movement for equality that it inspired. The Park Service should reverse themselves immediately.”\n\nStacy Lentz, a co-owner of the Stonewall Inn, told Gay City News on Feb. 14 that although the move wasn’t necessarily surprising given who occupies the White House, it still hits the community hard.\n\n“It’s painful and it’s unacceptable that they want to erase an entire part of the community,” Lentz said, acknowledging the participation of transgender individuals in the Stonewall Uprising. “To have them come into our house — it’s alarming. This should be alarming to everyone, not just the LGBTQ community.”\n\nAngelica Christina, an out trans board member of the Stonewall Inn Gives Back Initiative, which is the charitable arm of the Stonewall Inn, told Gay City News she is “entirely offended” and “disgusted” by the federal government’s erasure of the trans community.\n\n“What we’re seeing right now is the erasure of LGBTQIA+ history, and American history,” Christina said. “What we’re witnessing right now is an attempted gendercide of trans folks.”\n\nThe Office of Mayor Eric Adams, who has developed close ties with President Trump, offered an indirect answer when asked by Gay City News to comment on the National Park Service’s transphobic move.\n\n“We remain steadfast in our commitment to fostering a safe, inclusive, and affirming environment where every person can thrive,” a spokesperson for Adams told Gay City News. “Here in New York City, our policies have not changed at our schools or at our hospitals and we will continue to provide care for all, regardless of race, gender, religion or sexual orientation.”\n\nMark Segal, a Stonewall veteran who is the founder and publisher of the Philadelphia Gay News, called on community members to remember this moment as the beginning of the second Stonewall Rebellion.\n\n“The spirit of Stonewall means to be visible and fight back against oppression,” Segal said in a written statement. “You cannot erase the history of Stonewall by erasing a letter. You cannot erase trans people by erasing a letter. This petty, vindictive action is an attempt to not only erase trans people from public view, but also the entire LGBT community. Stonewall, including all of us in the LGBT community who fought back that historic night and have continued to fight for 55 years, cannot and will not be erased. We will continue to fight, we will continue to be visible and persevere…”\n\nLentz, who said the federal government had not communicated anything to her, is calling on members of the public to visit the National Park Service’s website and navigate to a page where folks can voice their concerns.\n\nFor now, though, she wants folks to step up and join in.\n\n“I think we’re seeing a lot of complacency, especially a lot of leadership in the Democratic Party,” Lentz said. “Pride started as a protest. We want to make sure our voices are being heard.”\n\nThe National Park Service did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nBelow are some more photos from the Feb. 14 demonstration at Stonewall:",

REUTERS/Rachel Wisniewski\n\nSign up for our email newsletter to stay up-to-date on the latest local sports news throughout Philadelphia.\n\nIn case you were unable to head to today’s Philadelphia Eagles Super Bowl parade, or just want to relive some of the incredible highs and chaotic events from Friday’s celebration, we’ve created your ultimate guide to the teams’ remarkable gathering in the heart of the City.\n\nFans poured onto the streets in the early hours of Friday morning, lining the roads in anticipation of their beloved Birds parading the Lombardi Trophy once again. It didn’t take long for the fun to begin. From police officers running their own iteration of the ‘Tush Push’, to fans cheering busses filled with other random fans, it was certainly a day to remember.\n\nHowie Roseman stole the show before even getting to the stage. The esteemed GM sported a cut at the top of his head after what many assume to be a clash with a beer can. After smoking a cigar in what might go down as one of the coldest pictures of the entire day, Roseman took to the stage outside the Art Museum to tell fans he ‘BLEEDS for this city’, and he meant it quite literally.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/sportscenter/status/1890498731453083708?s=61&t=7BbLnpr1DB45SPN7vMZwFQ\n\nThe Eagles soar down Broad Street\n\nThe players had their fair share of wholesome moments. Zack Baun signed someone’s baby, while Nolan Smith lifted a small child atop his shoulders while walking down and greeting ecstatic fans.\n\nSaquon Barkley found one of the teams’ ball boys in the crowd, lifting him over the barrier and inviting him into the parade with the rest of the team. As soon as you think you can’t love that man any more, he finds yet another new way to make you smile from ear to ear.\n\nDallas Goedert shotgunned a beer in front of the fans, which became a common theme for the day.\n\nQuinyon Mitchell was particularly excitable, screaming ‘GO EAGLES’ into the microphone of a Fox 29 reporter. James Bradberry played a great veteran role in running over to keep things moderately tame, but there was no stopping Landon Dickerson’s passion…\n\nhttps://twitter.com/brendendeeg_/status/1890448027501875316?s=61&t=7BbLnpr1DB45SPN7vMZwFQ\n\nThe dominant lineman would go on to drop the speech of the day, stating how he’s ‘never played an away game in his whole career’, attesting to the passion of the travelling Eagles fans.\n\nFeb 14, 2025; Philadelphia, PA, USA; Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Jalen Hurts holds the Vince Lombardi Trophy during the Super Bowl LIX championship parade and rally. Mandatory Credit: Kirby Lee-Imagn Images\n\nOther notable quotes\n\nA.J Brown’s speech to the City of Philadelphia was a sensational one. He gave the World a ‘mic drop’ moment, reminding everyone about the criticisms he’s faced since signing with the team.\n\n‘They said I was a diva. They said all I care about was stats. Well, if you’re gonna say all those things, get one thing right… I’m a f**king champion!’\n\nThe ‘Exciting Whites’ took to the stage with hefty applause and to the backdrop of ‘dreams and nightmares’. I don’t think the Eagles can ever break that tandem up now…\n\nJalen Hurts was the man of the moment and who a lot fans couldn’t wait to hear from. After returning from his Disney World trip and seeing the iconic ‘LOVE’ statue be upgraded with a ‘,Hurts’ feature, the Super Bowl MVP greeted fans warmly before stating how he promised himself he wouldn’t visit the Rocky steps until he won a championship. He can safely tick that one off the bucket list.\n\nThe Super Bowl parade wouldn’t be complete without a little chaos from CJGJ!\n\nhttps://twitter.com/sluggahjells/status/1890493030043398646?s=61&t=7BbLnpr1DB45SPN7vMZwFQ\n\nAnd of course, the iconic Eagles fanbase was out in full force, draping the streets in kelly green and showing their passion for the team in some brilliant ways:\n\nBeating the shit out of Kermit on Broad Street #EaglesParade pic.twitter.com/zjSm9WyOdw — Dalai Loml (@thealexbasso) February 14, 2025\n\nWe also want to send our thoughts to those impacted by the shootings at today’s Super Bowl parade.

        "source": "https://metrophiladelphia.com/",
        "fullContent": "Nov 16, 2024; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA; Philadelphia Flyers defenseman Emil Andrae (36) reaches for the puck against the Buffalo Sabres in the second period at Wells Fargo Center. Mandatory Credit: Kyle Ross-Imagn Images\n\nSign up for our email newsletter to stay up-to-date on the latest local sports news throughout Philadelphia.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Philadelphia Flyers’ forwards were given player grades as the 4 Nations Face-Off break arrived. Now, it’s time to take a look at how the defensemen and goaltenders have fared, as we are just crossing over the halfway point of the 2024-25 season.\n\nThe Flyers’ defense has been quite stable so far. Travis Sanheim, who is representing Team Canada at the 4 Nations Face-Off, has solidified himself as the Flyers’ No. 1 defenseman. Cam York continues to make positive strides and is preparing himself for a payday this summer, and Rasmus Ristolainen has mightily improved on the defensive side of the puck. Ristolainen did make Team Finland for the 4 Nations Face-Off, but he won’t play due to injury.\n\nLooking at the goaltending, it’s certainly been tough sledding. Samuel Ersson, representing Team Sweden at the 4 Nations Face-Off, has had his ups and downs this year but has provided stability between the pipes since the Christmas break. Ivan Fedotov and Aleksei Kolosov have struggled more than succeeded, but that was to be expected in their first full seasons in North America.\n\nHere are player grades for the Flyers’ defensemen and goaltenders thus far in 2024-25:\n\nFlyers defensemen\n\nTravis Sanheim: A\n\nSanheim has proved he’s the Flyers’ top defenseman and is also proving that his long-term extension signed by former general manager Chuck Fletcher was worth the price.\n\nSanheim ranks first in points by Flyers defensemen with 27 (6G, 21A) and first overall in ice-time, averaging 24:34 per game. He scored 44 points during 2023-24 and is on pace to meet similar numbers this year. On a true contending team, Sanheim would probably be the #2 or #3 defenseman, but on the Flyers, he’s the top guy and has been solid all around this year.\n\nJamie Drysdale: B\n\nJamie Drysdale was going to be one of the main players to watch this season regarding development. He played injured throughout most of his first Flyers season in 2023-24 and underwent surgery in the offseason.\n\nHe started this season a bit slow and suffered an upper-body injury that saw him miss 12 games. But since returning from injury, he’s been one of the team’s best defensemen. He’s showing his offensive capabilities and has thrived since facing his former team, the Anaheim Ducks, on Jan. 11 at the Wells Fargo Center.\n\nDrysdale has the opportunity to play a pivotal role in the Flyers’ future, and he’s starting to put all of the pieces in the right places.\n\nFeb 8, 2025; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA; Philadelphia Flyers defenseman Jamie Drysdale (9) grabs Pittsburgh Penguins left wing Danton Heinen (43) during a shot in the third period at Wells Fargo Center. Mandatory Credit: Kyle Ross-Imagn Images\n\nRasmus Ristolainen: B-\n\nEven if Ristolainen doesn’t return to the offensive producer he was in his junior career and Buffalo, he’s stepped up his defensive game massively since being a member of the Flyers. All credit for his improved defense goes to associate coach Brad Shaw.\n\nRistolainen has 15 points (2G, 13A) in 54 games this year and is on pace to set a career-high in points in his Flyers career. He registered 20 points (3G, 17A) during 2022-23. He’s been placed in every situation over the last few months, ranging from powerplay time to seeing the ice in overtime.\n\nHis name has been brought up in trade rumors as the trade deadline approaches, so we’ll see what his future looks like. If he stays or goes, he’s become a sound defensive player in Philadelphia.\n\nNick Seeler makes a visible difference when he’s in the lineup compared to being out. He has 13 points (3G, 10A) in 52 games played and is one point shy of tying a career high that he set with the Flyers in 2022-23.\n\nHe gives his all every game and is never afraid to step up and defend his teammates physically. Seeler plays a solid and tough defensive game and has revived his career since joining Philadelphia.\n\nJan 2, 2025; Las Vegas, Nevada, USA; Vegas Golden Knights defenseman Nicolas Hague (14) banks a shot off the stick of Philadelphia Flyers defenseman Nick Seeler (24) to score a goal against goaltender Aleksei Kolosov (35) during the second period at T-Mobile Arena. Mandatory Credit: Stephen R. Sylvanie-Imagn Images\n\nCam York: C+\n\nYork is due for a contract extension this summer. His two-year, $3.2 million deal that he signed on July 10, 2023, will expire.\n\nYork ranks second overall in ice-time on the roster, averaging 21:14 per game. He has turned into a player willing to put his body on the line, having blocked 84 shots this year. He does experience some inconsistencies at times, but when his game is on, watch out.\n\nHe was scratched by John Tortorella against the Los Angeles Kings on Dec. 19, showing that nobody is safe from watching a game in the press box on occasion. It will be interesting to see what numbers Daniel Briere presents York in the off-season regarding a new contract.\n\nEmil Andrae has suited up in 24 games this year, scoring six points (1G, 5A). He’s mostly stepped in for injured defensemen, being recalled from the Lehigh Valley Phantoms, and has been one of the better defensemen at times.\n\nYou can make the argument that he’s also outshined York at times. Both players are left-handed defensemen. Andrae appears to have a permanent spot on the Flyers’ blue line in the future, and he’s turned some heads multiple times this season.\n\nErik Johnson: D\n\nErik Johnson mostly steps in when an injury occurs. He signed a one-year extension with the Flyers last summer and will most likely be gone at the end of the season.\n\nHe plays a large mentorship role in the locker room with the younger players. His veteran presence and Stanley Cup-winning mentality doesn’t go unnoticed.\n\nEgor Zamula: D\n\nEgor Zamula has had a rough season. He’s struggled both on offense and defense and is prone to making many mistakes. He has 11 points (3G, 8A) in 39 games.\n\nIt’s unclear what Zamula’s future looks like in Philadelphia, especially with the emergence of Andrae. He was placed on the injured reserve on Jan. 31.\n\nFlyers goalies\n\nSamuel Ersson: B\n\nIn 31 games played, Ersson is 16-10-3. He holds a 2.82 GAA and a .890SV%. He’s easily been the best out of the bunch this year and will be the Flyers’ No. 1 goalie moving forward.\n\nSince returning from the Christmas break, Ersson is 9-4-1 with a 2.26 GAA and a .920SV%. He’s been dominant even in recent losses to the Colorado Avalanche and Utah Hockey Club.\n\nErsson will serve as the third goaltender for Sweden in the 4 Nations Face-Off.\n\nJan 23, 2025; New York, New York, USA; New York Rangers center Filip Chytil (72) (not pictured) scores a goal past Philadelphia Flyers goaltender Samuel Ersson (33) during the third period at Madison Square Garden. Mandatory Credit: Dennis Schneidler-Imagn Images\n\nIvan Fedotov: C-\n\nIn 17 games played, Fedotov is 4-8-1, carrying a 3.26 GAA and .877SV%. It’s been a rocky year for Fedotov, and he has cost the Flyers at times in games. He has made some slick saves but has been underwhelming.\n\nAleksei Kolosov: C-\n\nSimilar to Fedotov, Kolosov was also underwhelming in his stint with the team this year. It’s still his first year playing hockey in North America, like Fedotov, so there are adjustments still being learned.\n\nIn 15 games played, Kolosov is 4-8-1 with a 3.45 GAA and .870SV%. He’s also seen some struggles with the Phantoms, so development is the #1 priority for him.\n\nMandatory Credit: Kyle Ross-Imagn Images",

        "source": "https://metrophiladelphia.com/",
        "fullContent": "Sign up for our email newsletter to stay up-to-date on the latest local sports news throughout Philadelphia.\n\nEagles’ star running back, Saquon Barkley got caught up in the moment. Blame it on the alcohol.\n\nSitting at the post-game podium, with his Super Bowl champions shirt on and hat flipped to the side — along with his two beautiful kids on his lap — daughter, Jada; son, Saquon Jr. — the NFL Offensive Player of the Year contemplated the future of the Eagles’ franchise, specifically saying: “Why not start our dynasty now?”\n\nBarkley uttered it twice, in two different settings. And why not? The Eagles are young. They are motivated. They own the most talented roster in football. They are humble yet hungry. Most importantly, they are the reigning world champions.\n\nBut, speaking dynasties into existence doesn’t necessarily make them true. Winning one Lombardi Trophy is the toughest row to hoe in sports, something that Barkley understands better than anyone and went on record to clear up.\n\n“I said after the game, why can’t our dynasty start now … I probably had a little bit of champagne and some other stuff in my system at the time but you really can’t focus on that,” Barkley said during a press conference at Raising Cane’s in Trevose, PA. “You gotta enjoy the moment, it’s hard to win one … you take it in, you enjoy the moment, and you start over … and it kind of starts over after Friday.”\n\nFriday is the Eagles’ Championship Parade, a joyous jaunt down Broad Street on what is sure to be the greenest Valentine’s Day in city history. A million fans are expected to turn out for the second parade in seven years.\n\n“There’s been a lot of adversity, a lot of ups and downs,” Barkley said, “but it is the perfect timing to do it here, to do it as a part of this city, and with these fans, it’s truly amazing.”\n\nJudging by the crowd at Raising Cane’s — approximately 1,000 people showed up on a random Thursday to cheer on Barkley as he worked the drive-thru line and served up chicken fingers at the counter — it’s going to be a mess. A beautiful, verdurous, unapologetically awesome mess of humanity.\n\nBarkley is ready for it. All of it.\n\n“I don’t know what to expect,” Barkley said. “The Philly fans have been amazing all year round, just the love and support that they have for this team. This city truly buys into this team, you could see it there [as he pointed to the parking lot at Raising Cane’s], look how many people showed up. I’m expecting it to be a blast, a party.”\n\nThe last time the masses hijacked Broad Street, Jason Kelce took center stage in that obnoxious Mummers costume and morphed into Maximus. His speech was the stuff of legend. So, which Eagles player will provide the encore?\n\n“It won’t be me, I can guarantee you that,” Barkley said. “That’s not my thing. If I had to pick one I would say either Lane Johnson or BG [Brandon Graham]. And I think they are the two longest-tenured Eagles right now … so, I think it would just be perfect for one of those two to do that, especially if it is BG. Last game with us and last year, for him to go out with a bang, I think that would be pretty cool.”\n\nDream Starts Over: After the Eagles’ Ring Ceremony\n\nFootball – NFL – Super Bowl LIX – Philadelphia Eagles v Kansas City Chiefs – Caesars Superdome, New Orleans, Louisiana, United States – February 9, 2025 Philadelphia Eagles’ Saquon Barkley celebrates with the Vince Lombardi Trophy after winning Super Bowl LIX REUTERS/Mike Segar\n\nA.J. Brown said the euphoria from winning Super Bowl 59 lasted two days, then it was “back to work.” DeVonta Smith has echoed that sentiment in recent interviews, with Jalen Hurts saying the same thing in private conversations.\n\nSaquon Barkley said he’ll enjoy the championship parade — “shoot for the stars and land on the moon,” is his favorite saying — but then it’s back to the drawing board. The Eagles are starting from scratch. The Super Bowl ring ceremony is the only thing left to celebrate on the offseason calendar.\n\n“Whenever the ring ceremony is, that’s probably the last day we truly celebrate being a Super Bowl champion and then it’s back to work,” Barkley said. “Two nights ago I had a hard time sleeping because I’m thinking about how I’m going to attack the offseason because you kind of get — greedy’s not the word — but addicted to it. You want to find a way how you can hold that Lombardi up again and do it all over again.”\n\n(The Eagles were fitted for their Super Bowl rings later in the day. The ceremony will probably be in June sometime, at least that’s when they did it in 2018).\n\n“So, you take it in, you cherish it,” Barkley continued. “You enjoy it, you appreciate the fans but the dynasty thing … you can’t really get caught up in that, and the way you do that is by putting the work in. There’s a reason why we won, it’s not by accident, so we gotta try and do it all over again next year.”\n\nThere’s that dynasty thing again. It’s not a bad word. It’s not overconfidence or cockiness. It’s just the reality of the thing.\n\n“Dream starts over,” Barkley said.\n\nPartnering Up with Todd Graves at Raising Cane’s\n\nFeb 9, 2025; New Orleans, LA, USA; Philadelphia Eagles wide receiver DeVonta Smith (6) celebrates with running back Saquon Barkley (26) after scoring a touchdown against the Kansas City Chiefs during the second half of Super Bowl LIX at Caesars Superdome. Mandatory Credit: Geoff Burke-Imagn Images\n\nBarkley’s appearance at Raising Cane’s in Trevose, PA on Thursday (February 13) wasn’t by accident. The superstar running back struck up a friendship with owner Todd Graves at a Formula One racing event in Miami earlier this year. Then, Graves traveled to the Super Bowl in New Orleans to cheer on Barkley and the Eagles from a suite.\n\n“It was amazing watching Saquon, Jalen and the team win the Super Bowl on Sunday night,” Graves said. “It was a great game and seeing Saquon hold the Lombardi Trophy and be named Offensive Player of the Year all within his first season with Philly was great.”\n\nThat bond turned into a partnership. Barkley didn’t just show up to Raising Cane’s for a quick photo opportunity. No, the 28-year-old took orders at the counter and handed out chicken fingers at the drive-thru. He also participated in a lengthy commercial shoot for the fast-food chain, delivering scripted lines like: “You know the secret to winning rings? Good fingers. Like Raising Cane’s chicken fingers. Tastes like victory!”\n\nBarkley also poured out samples of a new green lemonade that Raising Cane’s concocted to honor the Eagles’ Super Bowl win. The refreshing drink is a limited-time offering at area restaurants.\n\n“I loved working the drive-thru with Todd,” said Barkley. “The first time I came to Cane’s was in Charlotte with my teammates. My favorite thing to eat is the Box Combo – you can never go wrong with chicken fingers and fries.”\n\nREUTERS/Mike Segar",

        "fullContent": "Sign up for our Daily Email newsletter to stay up-to-date on the latest local news throughout Philadelphia.\n\nGeorgia is bringing some love to Philadelphia later this month through a collab with “CheFarmers” Matthew and Tia Raiford of Strong Roots 9, plus, Philly’s own Ember & Ash and Booker’s Restaurant.\n\n“From Georgia with Love” is set to take place on Feb. 25 and 26 with the first night at Ember & Ash (1520 East Passyunk Ave.) and the second iteration at Booker’s Restaurant & Bar and Bayou Lounge (5021 Baltimore Ave.) Both events will take inspiration from the historic Centennial Family Farm in Brunswick, Georgia that Strong 9 Roots calls home.\n\nFeb. 25’s festivities will be in the form of a five-course dinner hosted by the Raifords. As a release notes, the evening will be a collaboration of Gullah Geechee cuisine infused with Ember & Ash’s live-fire cooking techniques, including ingredients grown at Gilliard Farms—the 50-acre homestead was purchased by Matthew’s great-great-great-grandfather and freed slave Jupiter Gilliard in 1874 for $9.\n\nWhile there, diners will be able to indulge in dishes like shrimp toast with saffron coconut rice and pickled okra; head hash terrine with fennel and citrus; smoked grouper with middlin risotto and hoja santa; sweet potato olive oil cake; and more. Seating times are 5, 6 and 7 p.m., and the dinner comes out to be $95 per person (plus tax and gratuity). Reservations are available now via Resy.\n\n“We’ve wanted to do a collaboration with longtime friends Scott and Lulu Calhoun of Ember & Ash for a while, as my ties to Philly run deep,” explained Tia in a statement. Both Scott and Tia worked with chef Marc Vetri at Lo Spiedo, and Tia was the culinary director for his nonprofit, Vetri Community Partnership from 2012 to 2014.\n\nThe Raifords, who were Culinary Institute of America grads, decided to switch gears to take their culinary skills to their historic farm in rural Georgia with a mission in mind: To “engage the world with African American foodways, revive the holistic practices of their ancestors, and help to feed their diverse community high-quality, locally-grown organic produce that are sustainably farmed.”\n\nAs a release notes, the couple believes in cultivating the land and pioneering a return to the regenerative practices of their forefathers — the Freshwater Gullah Geechee, who were direct descendants of West Africans brought to the U.S. as slaves for their expertise in rice and indigo cultivation.\n\nThis Black History Month celebration will continue with the Bookers event on the 26. Titled “A Great Migration Dinner,” Matthew will be using his skills as a historian and climate change activist to lead guests through a multi-course dinner and discussion recounting the history of the movement to the urban North by six million southern Blacks between 1910 and 1970. The James Beard semi-finalist and author of ‘Bress ‘n’ Nyam’ will also delve into how they brought their rich culinary traditions to a new life in the Northeast, Midwest, and West.\n\nHighlighted dishes span a pickled vegetable plate with Jamaican-style spinach patties, De Wata (salmon croquettes with red rice and herb salad),Win’ – Poulet Yassa (Senegalese style lemon pepper chicken with vegan teff stew), sweet potato pone with toasted walnut semifreddo and more. There will also be two De Spirits (complimentary cocktails) — a Gullah Geechie Gin Rickey or an alcohol-free hibiscus and lime spritzer.\n\n“Many African Americans’ roots can be traced to the Great Migration, including our own families,” said Cheri and Tracey Syphax from Booker’s restaurant in a statement. “We thought it would be a no-brainer to have Matthew join us for this special event, especially during Black History Month, given the fact that the namesake of our restaurant Booker Wright, is a famous waiter who worked in a whites-only restaurant in the 1960s Mississippi while also running his restaurant that catered to black customers.”\n\nThe dinner starts at 6 p.m. and costs $75 per person (plus tax and gratuity).\n\nTo find out more information on “From Georgia with Love”, visit emberandashphilly.com and bookersrestaurantandbar.com",

After a lengthy and grueling season, Philadelphia heads into the offseason with a few questions to answer.\n\nIn the latest edition of my Eagles mailbag, I’ll discuss Philadelphia’s next offensive coordinator, biggest offseason needs and much more regarding the team moving forward.\n\n@laAJbrownance asked, “Who is your personal favorite for the OC job?”\n\nNov 24, 2024; Inglewood, California, USA; Philadelphia Eagles head coach Nick Sirianni watches game action against the Los Angeles Rams during the second half at SoFi Stadium. Mandatory Credit: Gary A. Vasquez-Imagn Images\n\nNathan Scheelhaase is a potential offensive coordinator candidate that I have previously mentioned. Scheelhaase reportedly withdrew from the running for the Jacksonville Jaguars’ offensive coordinator opening to remain with the Los Angeles Rams earlier in February. Yet he has previously interviewed with the Eagles prior to the team promoting Brian Johnson in 2023.\n\nScheelhaase worked under Iowa State head coach Matt Campbell for several years, who is a close friend and former college teammate of Eagles head coach Nick Sirianni. Last season, Scheelhaase serves as the Rams pass game specialist and “play drawer” for Sean McVay.\n\nGiven his potential, Scheelhaase is certainly my personal favorite candidate for Philadelphia’s offensive coordinator opening. Although, the early indications are that Kevin Patullo will be promoted to fill that role for the Eagles in 2025.\n\n@BrentleyDOliver asked, “What is the biggest need for the Eagles for next season?”\n\nFeb 9, 2025; New Orleans, LA, USA; Philadelphia Eagles defensive tackle Milton Williams (93) celebrates on the podium after defeating the Kansas City Chiefs in Super Bowl LIX at Ceasars Superdome. Mandatory Credit: Mark J. Rebilas-Imagn Images\n\nFour of Philadelphia’s starters from their Super Bowl winning roster are set to hit free agency: Mekhi Becton, Josh Sweat, Milton Williams and Zack Baun. There’s also a chance that Nakobe Dean could miss a significant amount of time due to his knee injury next season as well.\n\nYet Eagles general manager Howie Roseman has strategically built this roster to have in-house replacements at several positions of potential weakness in 2025. Therefore, Philadelphia’s biggest positions of need are more long-term.\n\nHere’s how I would rank the top five needs for the Eagles this offseason:\n\nDefensive Tackle: Milton Williams will likely command a massive contract in free agency and the Eagles need to keep the potential fifth-year option for Jordan Davis and contract extension for Jalen Carter in mind. Offensive Tackle: Lane Johnson isn’t getting any younger and both of Philadelphia’s offensive tackles missed time this past season. Fred Johnson filled in admirably off the bench but he’ll be a free agent. Tight End: Dallas Goedert is essentially guaranteed to miss multiple games each season and Grant Calcaterra was far too inconsistent to be a reliable replacement for the 30-year-old tight end moving forward. Edge Defender: While both Josh Sweat and Brandon Graham could be done in Philadelphia, the Eagles still have a ton of potential on the edge in Nolan Smith and Jalyx Hunt. Cornerback: Quinyon Mitchell and Cooper DeJean are absolute studs. Yet Darius Slay’s future in Philadelphia is murky due to his contract situation and Isaiah Rodgers is set to become a free agent this offseason.\n\n@VladdyMuse asked, “Do you expect any contract restructure(s)? If so, who?”\n\nDec 31, 2023; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA; Philadelphia Eagles general manager Howie Roseman (middle) and head coach Nick Sirianni (L) walk from the tunnel before a game against the Arizona Cardinals at Lincoln Financial Field. Mandatory Credit: Bill Streicher-USA TODAY Sports\n\nRoseman has shown over the years that he is willing to get creative with contract structure to create additional cap space. One potential option would be to restructure Saquon Barkley’s current contract, converting a portion of his base salary into a signing bonus to free up around $1.3 million in 2025.\n\nLane Johnson has talked about playing for a few more years as well. Therefore, he could help the Eagles out by restructuring his current contract and freeing up nearly $3 million in 2025 as well.\n\nPhiladelphia could also create nearly $4 million in cap space in 2025 by restructuring Dallas Goedert’s contract. Yet given his lengthy injury history, he could actually be a sneaky cut or trade candidate this offseason as well.\n\n@Michael93826345 asked, “Who are some edge free agents that intrigue you?”\n\nSep 22, 2024; Cleveland, Ohio, USA; New York Giants linebacker Bobby Okereke (58) and New York Giants linebacker Azeez Ojulari (51) celebrate after a sack during the first quarter against the Cleveland Browns at Huntington Bank Field. Mandatory Credit: Ken Blaze-Imagn Images\n\nFangio has earned the right to have his finger prints all over the construction of Philadelphia’s defense moving forward. It’s clear that the Bryce Huff project didn’t work as planned, which is why Fangio could look to reunite with two of his former players in 2025.\n\nKhalil Mack is a decorated veteran that has essentially done it all except win a Super Bowl in the NFL. Fangio and Mack spent once season together in 2018 and Philadelphia’s defensive coordinator still praises the 33-year-old veteran today. If Mack wants to chase a Super Bowl ring, he could sign with the Eagles in free agency.\n\nBaron Browning was a third-round pick by the Denver Broncos in Fangio’s final season as the team’s head coach. Browning has been inconsistent in the NFL thus far and could reunite with Fangio to revitalize his career in 2025.\n\nAzeez Ojulari is just 24-years-old and showed a ton of promise with the New York Giants at times. While the Giants confusingly refused to trade Ojulari in a contract year, he would thrive as a rotational pass rusher in Philadelphia. Especially given the chance to reunite with several of his former teammates from the University of Georgia.\n\nMandatory Credit: Stephen Lew-Imagn Images",

        "fullContent": "Sign up for our email newsletter to stay up-to-date on the latest local sports news throughout Philadelphia.\n\nThe Philadelphia 76ers are set to convert recently acquired guard Jared Butler to a standard NBA contract, according to ESPN’s Shams Charania. The former second-round pick started this season on a two-way deal with the Washington Wizards before being traded to the Sixers, along with four second-round picks, in exchange for Reggie Jackson and an extremely unfavorable 2026 first-round pick.\n\nSince joining the Sixers, Butler has averaged 10.0 points and 4.7 assists a night, quickly establishing himself as another piece of the Sixers’ potential young core. Given Jared McCain‘s season-ending injury and the new knee injury that kept star guard Tyrese Maxey from playing against the Brooklyn Nets, converting Butler to a standard deal will provide some more stability in head coach Nick Nurse’s guard rotation.\n\nFeb 9, 2025; Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA; Philadelphia 76ers guard Jared Butler (12) drives for the basket against Milwaukee Bucks forward Bobby Portis (9) during the second quarter at Fiserv Forum. Mandatory Credit: Jeff Hanisch-Imagn Images\n\nButler has spent time with the Utah Jazz, the Oklahoma City Thunder, and the aforementioned Washington Wizards before finally landing this contract with the Sixers. The former Baylor guard got his start in the NBA after being selected at pick 40 in the 2021 NBA draft but has not been able to find a steady place to call home.\n\nThe search for that home may be over as the Sixers’s dismal season and proven track record at developing young, overlooked players provide the most stable breeding ground for Butler’s success. The Sixers will need to clear a roster spot before officially converting Butler. Given that both Chuma Okeke and David Roddy are on 10-day deals, it’s likely the Sixers will simply allow one or both to return to free agency after their ten days are up.\n\nButler’s future with the Sixers\n\nThis deal does not necessarily impact the Sixers’s offseason hopes of retaining Kelly Oubre Jr., Guerschon Yabusele, and Quenton Grimes. While Butler’s deal is not just a one-year contract, the second year is a team option that gives the Sixers flexibility come the offseason. This means that the Sixers’s plan of retaining Yabusele and the others is still very much alive and just as possible as it was before the very deserving contract was handed out.\n\nFeb 9, 2025; Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA; Philadelphia 76ers guard Jared Butler (12) passes the ball around dMilwaukee Bucks guard Gary Trent Jr. (5) during the fourth quarter at Fiserv Forum. Mandatory Credit: Jeff Hanisch-Imagn Images\n\nPhiladelphia may still look to keep Butler in the long term. Should the 24-year-old guard continue to show his outstanding playmaking skills and lay claim to the backup point guard role once everyone is healthy, the Sixers could pick up his team option and secure his services for another year or decline it in search of a longer team-friendly deal. If Butler fails to stick in the rotation as players become healthy, the Sixers can decline the second year and send him into free agency with no effect on their cap sheet.\n\nWhile Butler isn’t a generational player by any means, he has shown that he has the skills to make a difference. When he was with the Wizards, Butler scored a career-high 26 points against Philadelphia just last month. If anyone has the right situation to help Butler become a consistent contributor in this league, it’s the Sixers.\n\nPhiladelphia has been one of the best in the NBA when it comes to developing young, overlooked players these past two years, with both Ricky Council IV and Justin Edwards proving that they belong. With Butler’s playmaking and ball-handling skills being desperate needs for the Sixers, he could soon join the list as another piece of a sneaky young core in Philadelphia.",

        "source": "https://metrophiladelphia.com/",
        "fullContent": "Sign up for our Daily Email newsletter to stay up-to-date on the latest local news throughout Philadelphia.\n\nAfter earning a 2022 Oscar for Best Documentary Film with his directorial debut, ‘Summer of Soul (…Or, When the Revolution Could Not Be Televised)’, Philadelphia native Ahmir “Questlove” Thompson—co-founder of The Roots and drummer for The Tonight Show band—was undoubtedly ready for an encore.\n\nInstead of one encore, Questlove gave us two.\n\nFirst is the freshly-released film, the NBC documentary ‘Ladies & Gentlemen… 50 Years of SNL Music‘, to coincide with the 50th anniversary celebration of ‘Saturday Night Live‘, and secondly, this week’s ‘Sly Lives! (aka the Burden of Black Genius),’ is a study of Sly & Family Stone and Black music innovators such as Andre 3000 and D’Angelo.\n\nQuestlove’s ‘Ladies & Gentlemen… 50 Years of SNL Music’ doc features footage of the program’s storied live performances, from the Rolling Stones, David Bowie, Run DMC and more, and can currently be streamed on Peacock. ‘Sly Lives!’ is available for streaming on Hulu.\n\n“When we did ‘Summer of Soul‘, Ahmir and I came from the same starting point — we both knew and loved most of its artists,” says Questlove’s filmmaking partner, Oscar-winning producer Joseph Patel, talking about that 2021 documentary’s list of stars such as Stevie Wonder, Nina Simone, Gladys Knight & the Pips and more.\n\n“With ‘Sly Lives!’, it was Quest who held great importance for Sly Stone,” notes Patel. “That was one of Ahmir’s longtime favorites and one of his most influential artists.”\n\nSly Stone (born Stewart) is a San Francisco psychedelic-era radio DJ turned composer, singer, and musician who revolutionized music with Sly & the Family Stone — a multi-racial, genre-blending band that shattered boundaries between Black and White audiences. With soul-rock-funk-pop crossover hits like ‘Stand!’, ‘Everyday People’, ‘Hot Fun in the Summertime’, and ‘Thank You’, the group left an indelible mark on music history. The latter track, in particular, became a widely sampled staple of 1980s and ‘90s hip-hop, as highlighted in a fast-cut segment of ‘Sly Lives!’ where producers Terry Lewis and Jimmy Jam discuss its influence on Janet Jackson’s ‘Rhythm Nation.’ That same quick-cutting, DJ-like pacing can be found in the first few minutes of ‘Ladies & Gentlemen… 50 Years of SNL Music‘ as Questlove splices and dices what seems like hundreds of live segments — from the B-52s to Olivia Rodriguez — rhythmically, in the blink of an eye.\n\nQuestlove told Billboard magazine that Sly Stone was “essentially” the first Black megastar. “Sly is basically the he embodiment of what Martin Luther King’s ‘I Have a Dream’ speech was about, like this utopian multiracial mix of Black and whites, men and women together.”\n\nPatel goes on to say that he, however, didn’t know Sly’s discography in order, but did know those Family Stone hits, as well as the decline of Sly Stone that followed – the drug addiction, the arrests, the manner in which he missed live concerts and recording dates, and allowed his career to slip away.\n\n“I knew how he tried to win back his fame, that he was a junkie and lived in a camper,” says Patel. “The challenge for me was to become fluent so as to best tell his story and use his life and work as an avatar for this larger idea: the burden of Black genius.”\n\nQuestlove told Deadline that Sly’s undoing at his own hands was “the point of this whole film about self-sabotage. But he wrote the alphabet, and we’re still writing books from that alphabet to this day.”\n\nWhen it comes to the present day, and the ‘Sly’ documentary’s take on the idea of Black genius, Questlove spoke to Black music innovators Vernon Reid, Q-Tip, Chaka Khan, André 3000, and, most particularly D’Angelo — artists whose earliest works broke down barriers of what it means to make Black music, and had issues with how to move forward with the weight of expectation put upon them.\n\n“Can you imagine Sly after having just headlined Woodstock, being on the cover of Rolling Stone, having Black and White America are both looking to you as if you just solved race relations through your music—what pressure that must have been for him?,” asks Patel. “Connecting the stories of Sly and everyone else in the film came down to Ahmir’s own experiences with fame.”",

        "fullContent": "Sign up for our email newsletter to stay up-to-date on the latest local sports news throughout Philadelphia.\n\nThe Philadelphia Phillies roaming BayCare Ballpark’s outfield grass at Phillies Spring Training should look familiar. The existing crew of Nick Castellanos (157 starts), Kyle Schwarber (5 starts), Brandon Marsh (115), Johan Rojas (103), Weston Wilson (15), and Kody Clemens (1) returns to the outfield grass in Clearwater, Florida. One new face has been added to the mix as Philly turns to Max Kepler, a 31-year-old free-agent addition from Minnesota, who spent a decade with the Twins organization. Last season, the Phillies were a top-10 outfield unit in the MLB on the way to their first N.L. East Division title since 2011.\n\nSchwarber, Marsh, and Wilson split the left-field duties at Citizens Bank Park last season. With the addition of Kepler to the mix, Phillies manager Rob Thompson has more options to mix and match the position as needed entering this season.\n\nLeft Field Platoon\n\nDespite his 1.000% fielding percentage in 41 outfield innings last year, Kyle Schwarber should focus on saving energy to demolish baseballs towards City Hall this summer. The 31-year-old slugger placed inside the top 10 in HR (38), RBIs (104), and runs scored (110). Schwarber’s 106 walks were the best in the National League, with Los Angeles Dodgers superstar Shohei Ohtani’s 81 free passes in second place.\n\nBrandon Marsh, 27, played most of last season as part of a left-field platoon. He logged 684 innings over 97 games in this position and had a .978 fielding percentage. The five errors Marsh committed in the outfield last season were tied for second-worst in the MLB. It would not be shocking to see the Phillies’ addition of Kepler to the outfield, reducing Marsh’s role slightly. Marsh must rebound from a disastrous playoff appearance with one hit in 13 plate appearances for a .077 average in the 2024 postseason.\n\nMax Kepler, 31, should see his playing time in left field, given Nick Castellanos’s stranglehold on the starting spot in right field. The MLB veteran should not be a liability risk in the outfield, bringing a .993% fielding percentage in over 1,000 MLB appearances in a decade-long career. The 6-foot-4 outfielder is a .237 career hitter with 161 HRs and 508 RBIs on 1,034 games with Minnesota. Last season, Kepler played 105 games for the Twins with a .253 batting average, 8 HRs, and 42 RBIs, featuring injury concerns down the stretch run.\n\nWeston Wilson, 30, appeared at seven of the nine positions on the baseball diamond last season, including pitcher. Left field was the preferred starting destination last season, with Wilson logging 125 error-free innings in front of Harry The K’s outdoor bar. The Milwaukee Brewers draft pick from 2016 has a .288 batting average in 104 plate appearances in the MLB.\n\nFeb 12, 2025; Clearwater, FL, USA; Members of the Philadelphia Phillies prepare to workout during spring training at Carpenter Complex. Mandatory Credit: Jonathan Dyer-Imagn Images\n\nCenterfield Duo\n\nJohan Rojas, 24, received the majority of action in centerfield for Rob Thompson last season. Over 903 innings, Rojas was excellent defensively, finishing with a 991% fielding percentage, the fifth-best among centerfielders in the National League. The 5-foot-11 speedster features a .261 batting average over two MLB seasons, proving reliable in generating sacrifice hits for the Phillies. Rojas finished third in the N.L. with eight sacrifice hits in 2024 and fourth in 2023 after six successful sacrifice attempts. The MLB postseason has been unkind to Rojas, who has a .104 batting average with 16 strikeouts over 51 plate appearances.\n\nThe combination of Marsh and Kepler will likely sub for Rojas when he needs a break. Marsh has 248 starts in center field in his MLB career, including 35 last season for Philly. Those 30+ games represent a substantial 20% of the MLB campaign. Kepler brings 127 games worth of centerfield experience to Rob Thompson’s lineup but has not had meaningful action in centerfield since 2021.\n\nRight Field Ironman\n\nNick Castellanos, 32, led the National League with 157 starts in right field last season on his way to playing every game of the MLB season last year. Castellanos has earned his everyday status from Rob Thompson by not making mistakes in the field despite a grueling workload. The 2010 Detroit Tigers draft pick finished first in RF fielding percentage in the N.L. for the third season since joining Philadelphia in 2022.\n\nIn three seasons in Philadelphia, Castellanos has a .263 batting average, 65 HRs, and 254 RBIs. Castellanos has appeared in 319 of 324 games, or 98%, for the Phillies over the last two seasons, with only five absences from the lineup. He has also been one of the more reliable run producers in the Phillies lineup in the postseason, with 6 HRs and 17 RBIs during three playoff runs in Philly.\n\nPhillies Bench Options\n\nMarsh and Wilson should find opportunities to play but are expected to spend most afternoons watching from the Citizens Bank Park dugout. Kody Clemens, 28, could also find a small role as a replacement player in the Phillies outfield during the season. Primarily an infielder, Clemens started one game in left field last season and has 72 innings of experience over three MLB seasons between Detroit and Philadelphia. Schwarber is excluded from bench options as he will find his way into the starting designated hitter spot in Thompson’s lineup card, as he did more often than not last season.\n\nMandatory Credit: Bill Streicher-USA TODAY Sports",

Managers make their decisions based on the numbers.” What better way to start a brand new Phillies season than with a new piece looking at the numbers behind Philadelphia baseball?\n\nAs Philly’s baseball team trickles into Clearwater, Florida, over the next week for the start of baseball activities, let’s take our first look at some relevant numbers that will allow you to drop some knowledge on your baseball-loving buddies this spring.\n\nPhillies By Numbers\n\n0- Days remaining until Phillies Spring Training arrives in 2025. Seriously! Despite the winter weather swirling around Philadelphia, the trucks have already arrived, and Phillies GM Dave Dombrowski has held a press conference to provide some new nuggets of information. For those who don’t have time to watch it, PSN’s Cory Nidoh broke it all down for you!\n\n1- Phillies rookies to hit for the cycle: Weston Wilson last August against Washington. It was the 10th cycle in Phillies history. Wilson smacked a triple off the wall in right in the 4th before a pop-up single landed him on first base later in that same inning. The cycle watch was on after Wilson blasted a 7th-inning home run. Wilson’s name was etched in the history books in the 8th inning as he connected with a double, sending the home crowd into a frenzy as he strolled into second base.\n\n2- Games Against the N.L. East during Grapefruit League action—both are against Atlanta. The Phillies were 6-7 last season against the Atlanta Braves, with a 4-3 home record in Philadelphia and a 2-4 visiting record in Georgia.\n\n4- Number of Phillies to claim MLB’s National League Rookie-of-the-Year Award. Jack Sanford claimed the first one in franchise history in 1957, followed by Richie “Dick” Allen a few seasons later in 1964. Three more decades passed before Scott Rolen’s award-winning campaign in 1997. Ryan Howard’s 22 HR and 63 RBI during the 2005 season claimed the franchise’s most recent breakout rookie trophy.\n\nFeb 12, 2025; Clearwater, FL, USA; Philadelphia Phillies special instructor Cole Hamels looks on during a spring training workout at Carpenter Complex Mandatory Credit: Jonathan Dyer-Imagn Images\n\n15- Number worn by new Hall of Famer Dick Allen over his 9-year Phillies career. Allen played 1,070 games in a Phillies uniform with a .290 batting average, 204 HRs, and 655 RBIs. In his 1964 rookie campaign, he led the National League in runs scored (125) and total bases (352) for the season. Despite a batting average above .300, Allen unceremoniously led the N.L. in strikeouts during his first two seasons in the majors—138 in 1964 and 150 in 1965.\n\n31- The number of games the Phillies play during spring training. The Toronto Blue Jays and the New York Yankees are tied for most games against Philadelphia at five games each. The Boston Red Sox and the Braves have two scheduled appearances against the Phillies this spring.\n\n79- Number of times Philadelphia’s MLB club has held spring training in Clearwater. According to MLB’s Todd Zolecki, the Phillies trained in ten different states between 1900 and 1946 before settling in South Florida. Philadelphia first appeared in Clearwater in 1947 when it signed a 10-year contract and promised to add an expensive sprinkler system at Athletic Field. The city would pay the team back for most of the purchase price over the next decade.\n\n95- Total wins for the Phillies last season. Philly was 95-67, including a 54-27 home record at Citizens Bank Park. As a road squad last season, the Phillies played one game over .500 baseball with a 41-40 record. Of course, we all know what happened in the postseason, so no need to go any further there.\n\n224- Number of MLB strikeout victims by Zach Wheeler in 2024. He was tied for second overall in the National League with San Deigo’s Dylan Cease (224). Both pitchers finished behind Atlanta’s Chris Sale (225) in the N.L. punchout competition. Detroit Tigers All-Star Tarik Skubal led the MLB with 228 strikeouts in 2024.\n\nFeb 12, 2025; Clearwater, FL, USA; Philadelphia Phillies pitcher Aaron Nola (27) warms up during a spring training workout at Carpenter Complex. Mandatory Credit: Jonathan Dyer-Imagn Images\n\n800- Approximate weight (in pounds) of the 2,400 baseballs that traveled to spring training with the Phillies. The weight is equivalent to that of a grown grizzly bear. While it seems silly to suggest every one of the spherical objects will see game day action, that math works out to 150 baseballs per game for each of the 16 home dates at BayCare Park this spring.\n\n1,058- Miles (approximately) between Citizens Bank Park in Pennsylvania and BayCare Park in Florida. According to Google’s highly scientific calculations, it takes between 15-16 hours to drive from Philadelphia, PA, to Clearwater, FL. While it is possible to take a train ride down the East Coast, be prepared to book almost a full day in your travel itinerary for the ride. Of course, air travel provides the quickest path to Florida, with a flight time of between two to three hours.\n\n10,000- Number of paper cups the Phillies loaded onto trucks for spring training. Spring Training is scheduled to last for 31 days, which gives the Phillies equipment staff an average of 322 paper cups per day before they begin to worry about a Spring Training shortage, not accounting for scheduled off days.\n\nMandatory Credit: Jonathan Dyer-Imagn Images",

During this fan event, Smith briefly addressed the media, reflecting on the Eagles‘ recent victory in Super Bowl LIX, the many fans in attendance to see him, and more.\n\nOne thing you quickly learn about Smith when speaking with him is that he is a man of few words who prefers to let his actions speak for him. While Smith isn’t your typical boisterous star wide receiver, he let some media members in on his thoughts since the Super Bowl.\n\nFootball – NFL – Super Bowl LIX – Philadelphia Eagles v Kansas City Chiefs – Caesars Superdome, New Orleans, Louisiana, United States – February 9, 2025 Philadelphia Eagles’ DeVonta Smith celebrates scoring a touchdown with teammates REUTERS/Brian Snyder\n\nWhen asked about his expectations for the parade, which was set to begin in less than 24 hours, Smith expressed that he was “worried about the cold more than anything,” with a joking but sincere grin.\n\nFlashing back to the game, Smith was asked about his emotions and state of mind during the game in New Orleans. For the Amite City native, it was a homecoming of sorts.\n\n“I think it was just being back at home,” Smith reflected. “[I’m] very familiar with that building, played two state championships in it, being home in front of the family, I think that was it more so that than anything.”\n\nFeb 9, 2025; New Orleans, LA, USA; Philadelphia Eagles wide receiver DeVonta Smith (6) makes a catch for a touchdown against Kansas City Chiefs cornerback Jaylen Watson (35) during the second half of Super Bowl LIX at Caesars Superdome. Mandatory Credit: Geoff Burke-Imagn Images\n\nIt was truly special for DeVonta Smith, one of the most decorated active football players. Smith added a Super Bowl to his resume, which already included a state championship appearance, two college football championships at Alabama, a Heisman trophy, and much more. Among Smith’s many accolades is his record of the most playoff receiving yards in Philadelphia Eagles history (595 yards).\n\nWhen asked by Philly Sports Network what the future held for Smith and his Eagles, he simply replied with a single, powerful statement: “Try to repeat it.”\n\nIt’s clear that while Smith had plans to enjoy this victory, next season is already on his mind.\n\nFootball – NFL – Super Bowl LIX – Philadelphia Eagles v Kansas City Chiefs – Caesars Superdome, New Orleans, Louisiana, United States – February 9, 2025 Philadelphia Eagles’ A.J.

However, on the biggest stage, Smith continued to prove his doubters wrong, coming up large in the biggest moments on the biggest stage.\n\nIn parting, Smith addressed the next generation, specifically those who, like him, have been doubted because of their size.\n\nPhiladelphia Eagles’ star wide receiver DeVonta Smith takes a photo with a fan at an autograph signing at the Dick’s Sporting Goods in Deptford, New Jersey.\n\n“Trust your training.

        "fullContent": "article\n\nThe Brief States that implemented abortion bans had higher infant mortality rates. A new study finds that the infant mortality rate for births connected to the abortion ban were higher than expected. Rates of births and deaths were evaluated using data between 2012 and 2013 before abortion restrictions took effect.\n\n\n\nA new study reveals that states with abortion bans experienced an increase in infant mortality rates.\n\nThe study published in the medical journal JAMA noted that in 14 states that implemented complete or 6-week abortion bans after the Supreme Court Dobbs decision revoked the federal right to abortion, the fertility rate increased 1.7%, leading to roughly 1 additional birth for every 1,000 women of reproductive age.\n\nRELATED: Abortion laws by state\n\nBy the numbers:\n\nThe study also found that with roughly 500 deaths than expected among nearly 22,000 additional births, the infant mortality rate for births linked to abortion bans – 24 deaths for every 1,000 births – was approximately four times higher than projected.\n\nThe estimated increases in infant mortality were larger for deaths based on congenital causes and among groups that had higher than average infant mortality rates at baseline, including Black infants and those in southern states.\n\nHow was data gathered for the study?\n\nResearchers used study data that included biannual counts of neonatal and infant deaths, and the corresponding total number of live births, from birth and death certificate data compiled by the National Center for Health Statistics for all 50 US states and the District of Columbia from January 2012 through December 2023.\n\nThe study noted that biannual counts of infant deaths and live births were separately pulled for four racial and ethnic groups (racial and ethnic data were acquired from the death certificate, which is identified by the next of kin, coroner, or other person who certified the death) for each state over the same period.\n\nRELATED: Survey: 3 in 4 reproductive age women in the US think abortion should be legal\n\nThe primary outcome was the infant mortality rate, calculated as the number of infant deaths per 1000 live births in each biannual period for each state over 12 years. Mortality rates were calculated overall and by race and ethnicity, timing of death and cause of death.\n\nThis study found that states that banned abortion had infant mortality rates higher than would have been expected without such bans. The largest estimated changes were observed among southern states and Black infants.\n\nWhat did researchers conclude in the study?\n\nResearchers noted that their analysis found an estimated increase of 0.33 infant deaths per 1000 live births above expected in states that banned abortion.\n\nWhat they're saying:\n\nThe team shared that the results are consistent with clinician and media reports documenting denial of terminations for nonviable pregnancies, forcing pregnant women to overcome significant barriers to receive timely abortion care out of state or carry the pregnancy to term.\n\n\n\nAccording to the study, the increase in infant mortality rate due to noncongenital causes is less straightforward and needs more investigation.\n\nMoreover, researchers explained that the study provides new evidence that infant deaths were higher than expected in states that enforced abortion bans after the bans were implemented.",

While the order is unlikely to have a significant national effect, as most schools and colleges have already dropped their vaccine requirements, it threatens to withhold federal funding from institutions still enforcing COVID-19 vaccine mandates.\n\n\n\nPresident Donald Trump signed an executive order on Friday which directs the Education Department and Health and Human Services to create a plan to end vaccine mandates for COVID-19.\n\nThe order aims to fulfill a campaign promise from Trump, who often said he would \"not give one penny to any school that has a vaccine mandate.\"\n\nTrump says COVID-19 mandates in school infrige on ‘personal freedom’\n\nWhat they're saying:\n\n\"Given the incredibly low risk of serious COVID-19 illness for children and young adults, threatening to shut them out of an education is an intolerable infringement on personal freedom,\" the order said.\n\nDig deeper:\n\nThe order is expected to have little national impact because COVID-19 vaccine mandates have mostly been dropped at schools and colleges across the United States, and many states have passed legislation forbidding such mandates.\n\nFILE: Doctor with COVID-19 vaccine.

Most also allow exemptions for religious or other nonmedical reasons.\n\nSome colleges started requiring students to be immunized against COVID-19 during the pandemic, but most have dropped the requirements. A few continue to require vaccines at least for students living on campus, including Swarthmore and Oberlin colleges. Most of those colleges allow medical or religious exemptions.\n\nSchools requiring vaccine at risk of losing federal funding\n\nThe order also said schools, colleges and states that require students to be immunized against COVID-19 may be at risk of losing federal funding.\n\nThe order didn't identify specific sources of money that could be at risk.

The iconic and historic race also marks the beginning of the official racing season.\n\nNASCAR officials moved the start of the race up to 1:30 p.m. due to weather concerns about the potential for rain and showers during the afternoon and early evening hours.\n\nIf you're looking to watch the race, here's what you need to know:\n\nWhat time does the Daytona 500 start?\n\nThe race starts at 1:30 p.m. It was originally scheduled to start at 2:30 p.m., but due to weather concerns, especially rain, the race was bumped up an hour.\n\nWhat TV channel is the Daytona 500 on?\n\nYou can watch the NASCAR Daytona 500 race on FOX and local FOX stations.\n\nCan I stream the Daytona 500?\n\nThe Daytona 500 can be streamed on the FOX Sports app (subscription required) or streaming services that carry FOX programming. It will not be available on the FOX Local app, though you will be able to find pre-race highlights from both FOX 35 Orlando and FOX 13 Tampa.\n\nHow long is the race?\n\nThe Daytona 500 is a 500-mile race. Daytona International Speedway is a 2.5-mile track, which means it takes 200 laps to hit the 500-mile milestone.\n\nWhere is the Daytona 500?\n\nIt's held at Daytona International Speedway in Daytona Beach, Florida.\n\nIs President Donald Trump going to be at the Dayona 500?\n\nYes. President Donald Trump is attending the Daytona 500. He landed at Daytona Beach International Airport shortly before 1 p.m. He was greeted by Sen. Rick Scott and Florida state Sen. Randy Fine. The three – and others – spoke for a few minutes before Trump boarded a limousine en route to Daytona International Speedway.\n\n\"Today, I look forward to joining tens of thousands of American Patriots in Daytona Beach, Florida, for the \"Great American Race\"—the legendary Daytona 500—and the official start to the 2025 NASCAR Cup Series,\" Trump said in a statement prior to his arrival.\n\n\"This iconic race showcases the fastest, most fearless drivers in motorsports, who represent our Nation’s love of tradition, competition, and automotive innovation. The Daytona 500 brings together people from all walks of life—from lifelong racing fans to first-time spectators—they all join in celebrating a shared passion for speed, adrenaline, and the thrill of the race. From the roar of the engines on the track to the echo of \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" soaring through the stands, the Daytona 500 is a timeless tribute to the speed, strength, and unyielding spirit that make America great.

        "fullContent": "article\n\nThe Brief Reddit is set to roll out some new features this year, which could include paid subreddits. CEO Steve Huffman said paid subreddits are \"coming\" and currently \"in the works.\" Reddit has had trouble generating profit and went public last March.\n\n\n\nA new feature is expected to roll out on Reddit later this year that could put some content behind a paywall.\n\nReddit’s co-founder and CEO Steve Huffman spoke more on the idea of paid subreddits in a recent company Ask Me Anything (AMA).\n\nHere’s what to know:\n\nWhat is Reddit?\n\nThe backstory:\n\nReddit is a technology and social network company that was founded more than 20 years ago. It is a sought-after space for internet discussions of any topic within communities, also known as subreddits.\n\nReddit has more than 100 million daily active users, Huffman said last week , who visit the site to discuss a range of topics from silly memes to existential worries, as well as to get recommendations from like-minded people.\n\nDespite its popularity, Reddit has had trouble turning profit since it was founded in 2005. It’s been looking for ways to boost revenue, and went public in March of last year.\n\nBy the numbers:\n\nBy tech industry’s standards though, Reddit remains small for a company that has been around since 2005.\n\nLast year, Reddit’s annual revenue generation was just below $1 billion. For comparison, Meta boasts an annual revenue of $135 billion.\n\nMeta had a market value of more than $1.2 trillion in 2024. Reddit’s market value was priced at $6.4 billion when it went public last March.\n\nRELATED: TikTok returns to Apple, Google app stores after temporary removal\n\nPaid subreddits\n\nWhat we know:\n\nHuffman has talked about the idea of paid subreddits before, and mentioned that when asked about it again in a recent AMA alongside Chief Operating Officer Jen Wong and Chief Financial Officer Drew Volleror.\n\n\"That one’s coming. We’re working on it as we speak,\" Hoffman said.\n\nA paid subreddit would put a paywall, of sorts, around designated content, meaning that only members who pay could access that subreddit, or \"community,\" and see its content.\n\nWhat we don't know:\n\nHoffman didn’t elaborate on the timeline users can expect for the paid subreddits.\n\nHe also didn’t indicate how much users could expect to pay for some content, or if the amount would be fixed by Reddit or perhaps set by the creator.\n\nRELATED: Facebook fact-checking to be replaced with X-style community notes\n\nWhat's next:\n\nHoffman spoke on some other new key features that Reddit users can expect for 2025:\n\nPaid subreddits\n\nImproved search results\n\nReddit Answers, which uses AI to summarize search results from Reddit’s user base\n\nLaying the foundation for an eventual marketplace",

The program deadline was Feb. 6, and administration officials said employees who accept will be able to stop working while still collecting a paycheck until Sept. 30.\n\nRELATED: Federal worker buyout deadline: What we know about the deferred resignation program\n\nFILE - The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) building in Washington, DC, US, on Tuesday, Dec. 31, 2024. Photographer: Samuel Corum/Bloomberg via Getty Images\n\nWhat we know:\n\nThe Associated Press reported that IRS employees involved in the 2025 tax season were told they will not be allowed to accept a buyout offer from the Trump administration until after the taxpayer filing deadline, according to a letter sent recently to IRS employees.\n\nWhat we don't know:\n\nIt is unclear how many IRS workers will be impacted by the layoff announcement plan.\n\nIt’s also unclear how the layoffs would affect IRS processings, such as the disbursement of tax refunds.\n\nBig picture view:\n\nJan. 27 was the official start date of the 2025 tax season, and the IRS expects more than 140 million tax returns to be filed by the April 15 deadline.\n\nRELATED: Where's my refund? How to track your IRS tax return\n\nIRS funding\n\nThe other side:\n\nThe Biden administration invested heavily - $80 billion - in the IRS, which included plans to hire tens of thousands of new employees to help with customer service and enforcement as well as new technology to update the tax collection agency.\n\nRepublicans have been successful at clawing back that money.\n\nFederal government employees\n\nBy the numbers:\n\nThe civilian federal workforce, not including military personnel and postal workers, comprises about 2.4 million people.\n\nWhile a chunk of federal workers, about 20%, are in Washington, D.C., and the neighboring states of Maryland and Virginia, more than 80% are distributed outside the region.\n\nTrump’s buyout offer has already been accepted by about 65,000 employees, FOX News reported .",

Fans converged on the Benjamin Franklin Parkway from all over, arriving by train, plane and automobile just for the once-in-a-lifetime experience of celebrating the Eagles.\n\n\n\nWith an estimated 1 million plus fans heading into Philadelphia for the Eagles victory parade celebrating the team’s Super Bowl win, many didn’t want the day to end.\n\nBut, by train, plane and automobile, fans made the trek back home from the City of Brotherly Love.\n\nAnd, for some, that trip home on the rails involved waiting in some long lines.\n\nWhat they're saying:\n\nA lot of fans heading home from the Philadelphia Eagles victory parade had anxiety about hopping on public transportation to get to or from the festivities, but at the Paoli Station, there were nothing but good feelings about the experience.\n\nCarrie Rife, from Devon, said, \"No hiccups today at all. Like that is unheard of sometimes in these massive crowds. So, we would repeat it again, for sure!\"\n\nA family from Wyoming had zero complaints getting to and from the city.\n\nRelated article\n\n\"We thought it was smooth, really. I mean of course, the amount of people, yes there was waiting coming back, but that’s nothing. It’s really not that all,\" Brian Belmont stated, followed by Brady Belmonte, who added, \"Oh I thought it went pretty well. It was pretty organized. Not too bad, definitely a change from what we deal with every day.\"\n\nDig deeper:\n\nThe lines were long, unless you found a loophole.\n\nMelissa Guillen, from Berwyn, explained, \"You would turn a corner and you’re like no way could it keep going further and it kept going further. It was insane.\"\n\nFOX 29’s Ellen Kolodziej asked, \"So, you’re telling me you snuck in line?\"\n\n\"No!\" Melissa laughed. \"We saw our friends!\"\n\nBig picture view:\n\nOf course people had to wait. But, they passed the time by making new friends and lifelong memories.\n\n\"It was like a good hour, or two, for us, but if you just sit there, it was probably like a five, four hour wait,\" Maui Morris said.\n\n\"But was it worth it?\" Kolodziej asked.\n\n\"It was, it really was. You say Go Birds! I’ll do anything for my city. I’d do it again in a heartbeat!\"\n\nThe overall theme:\n\nSo, that was the main theme – people had to wait to get on the train or the El or the bus, but they would do it again. Kudos to SEPTA and Amtrak for making it a smooth ride for most people to and from the parade.",

In the last few months alone, since the middle of October, we've lost 45 million egg-laying hens,\" he added. \"We've lost a significant amount of production, more than 13%. So we're just dealing with supply shortages. And it's just a disaster right now because this virus is in three of the top egg-laying states in the country. It doesn't seem like it's stopping anytime soon.\"\n\nIn the last year, egg prices have risen 53% since January 2024, and they're already up 15% since January of this year.

        "source": "https://www.fox29.com/",
        "fullContent": "The Brief Recent polling shows that Americans are largely contradictory when it comes to the federal budget. They think the government should spend more on key issues and programs – but less overall.\n\n\n\nAs President Donald Trump and Elon Musk push for extensive cuts to the federal budget, recent polling suggests Americans may not be on board with slashing education and humanitarian aid spending.\n\nAccording to polls from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research, U.S adults mostly think the government isn't spending enough on key issues and programs. But conversely – and the biggest challenge for lawmakers – Americans are broadly in favor of cuts to the federal budget.\n\nRELATED: DOGE subcommittee meeting holds 1st hearing focusing on 'war on waste'\n\nWhat do Americans think about government spending?\n\nWhat they're saying:\n\nAbout two-thirds of Americans say the U.S. government is spending \"too little\" on Social Security and education, according to a January AP-NORC poll. Another 6 in 10, roughly, say too little money is going to assistance to the poor. A similar share say spending is too low for Medicare, the national health care insurance program for seniors, and most also say Medicaid is under-funded by the federal government.\n\nRELATED: 75,000 federal workers take buyout after judge approves Trump’s downsizing plan\n\nAbout one-third of U.S. adults say the federal government is spending \"too much\" on the military. About one-third say the military is getting \"too little\" funding, and another one-third say it takes in \"about the right amount.\" But most Republicans say the military is underfunded, while slightly less than half of Democrats say it's getting too much money.\n\nFILE - The US Capitol is seen at sunrise on September 30, 2023 in Washington, DC. (Photo by Nathan Howard/Getty Images) Expand\n\nForeign aid is one area where there is broad consensus that the U.S. is overspending. The 2023 AP-NORC polling suggests that Americans tend to believe too much money is going to other countries.\n\nRoughly 7 in 10 U.S. adults said the government was putting too much money toward \"assistance to other countries.\" About 9 in 10 Republicans and just over half of Democrats agreed that the country was overspending on foreign aid at the time. But polling has also shown that U.S. adults tend to overestimate the share of the federal budget that is spent on foreign aid.\n\nWhat is the government actually spending?\n\nForeign aid spending\n\nBy the numbers:\n\nSurveys from KFF have found that, on average, Americans say spending on foreign aid makes up 31% of the federal budget rather than the actual answer: closer to 1% or less.\n\nSocial Security spending\n\nAccording to the nonpartisan Center on Budget Policies and Priorities (CBPP), in 2024, 21% of the budget, or $1.5 trillion, was spent on Social Security, providing monthly retirement benefits averaging $1,922 to 51.5 million retired workers. Social Security also paid benefits to 2.6 million spouses and children of retired workers, 5.8 million surviving children and spouses of deceased workers, and 8.4 million disabled workers and their eligible dependents.\n\nMedicare, Medicaid, CHIP and ACA spending\n\nFour health insurance programs — Medicare, Medicaid, the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP), and Affordable Care Act (ACA) marketplace health insurance subsidies — comprised a combined 24% of the 2024 federal budget, or $1.7 trillion. More than half – or $912 billion – went to Medicare, which provided health coverage to around 67 million people who are 65 or older or have disabilities.\n\nThe rest was spent on Medicaid and CHIP ($626 billion) and ACA subsidy and marketplace costs ($125 billion). Both Medicaid and CHIP require states to pay some of their total costs, according to the CBPP.\n\nDefense spending\n\nNational defense made up 13 percent of the budget, or $872 billion.\n\nRELATED: Coast Guard Commandant terminated over border lapses, recruitment, DEI focus: official\n\n\"About 95 percent of the spending in this category reflects the underlying costs of the Defense Department, largely for operations and maintenance; military personnel; procurement of weapons; and research, development, testing, and evaluation,\" the CBPP says.\n\nEducation spending\n\nIn 2024, the federal government spent about 5% of its total budget on education. This includes elementary, secondary, and vocational education; higher education; and research and general educational aids",

His presence highlights NASCAR's conservative-leaning fan base and his broader effort to align with American sports culture. Drivers, including Chase Elliott, acknowledge the significance of a president attending the event: \"It certainly brings a lot of eyes.\"\n\n\n\nPresident Donald Trump attended the Daytona 500 on Sunday, marking his second appearance at NASCAR’s most prestigious race as president.\n\nSpirit of NASCAR will 'fuel America's Golden Age'\n\nWhat we know:\n\nPresident Trump is back in Daytona Beach for The Great American Race. It's the second appearance at the race as president. His first visit was in 2020 while running for reelection. That year, he served as grand marshal, delivering the command for drivers to start their engines and making a dramatic entrance with an Air Force One flyover.\n\nFor this trip, Air Force One departed from Palm Beach International Airport shortly after noon, carrying Trump, his son Eric, grandson Luke, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy, Interior Secretary Doug Burgum and his wife, Kathryn. Several members of Congress were also accompanying him, according to the White House.\n\nTrump also thrilled NASCAR fans in the stands with another Air Force One flyover before he rode in the presidential limousine onto the Daytona International Speedway.\n\nTrump has made a point of attending major sporting events, having recently become the first sitting president to attend a Super Bowl. His presence at college football games and UFC fights, along with his well-documented passion for golf, further underscores his efforts to align himself with sports culture.\n\nWhat we don't know:\n\nIt remained unclear whether Trump had any official role at the Daytona 500 this year, as he did in 2020 when he was grand marshal. The extent of his involvement in pre-race ceremonies or interactions with drivers has not been disclosed.\n\nThe backstory:\n\nTrump’s relationship with NASCAR extends beyond his appearances at the Daytona 500. In 2018, while in the White House, he honored NASCAR Cup Series champion Martin Truex Jr. and Furniture Row Racing. More recently, in May of last year, he attended the Coca-Cola 600 at Charlotte Motor Speedway, a major race in the swing state of North Carolina, as a former president and reelection candidate.\n\nTrump has often spoken about his admiration for the sport and its fans, praising the courage of drivers and the patriotic spirit of NASCAR events. His presence at Daytona aligns with his broader strategy of cultivating support among sports audiences.\n\nBig picture view:\n\nTrump’s appearance at the Daytona 500 reinforces his ongoing effort to maintain visibility among sports fans, particularly those in key political battlegrounds. With NASCAR’s fan base traditionally seen as conservative-leaning, his presence at the event could bolster his appeal among a segment of voters who value his brand of patriotism and showmanship.\n\nHis attendance follows a recent pattern of high-profile sports event visits, including last weekend’s Super Bowl. These appearances, coupled with his history of engaging with NASCAR and other sports leagues, reflect a continued strategy of associating himself with American sports culture.\n\nImage 1 of 9 ▼ DAYTONA BEACH, FLORIDA - FEBRUARY 16: Air Force One is seen for U.S. President Donald Trump's visit to the NASCAR Cup Series Daytona 500 at Daytona International Speedway on February 16, 2025 in Daytona Beach, Florida. (Photo by Mike Ehrmann/Getty Images)\n\nWhat they're saying:\n\nDuring a 2020 interview with Fox News, Trump spoke about his admiration for NASCAR and the Daytona 500, calling it a \"legendary display of roaring engines, soaring spirits and the American skill, speed and power that we’ve been hearing about for so many years.\"\n\n\"The tens of thousands of patriots here today have come for the fast cars and the world-class motorsports,\" Trump said at the time. \"But NASCAR fans never forget that no matter who wins the race, what matters most is God, family and country.\"\n\nChase Elliott, a NASCAR driver, acknowledged the significance of having a sitting president attend the Daytona 500. \"One of our biggest days of the year is special,\" he said. \"It certainly brings a lot of eyes and a different perspective to what we do down here for this race.\"\n\nDaytona 500: What to know:\n\nThe Daytona 500 race is held on Sunday, Feb. 16, at Daytona International Speedway in Daytona Beach, Florida. The race started at 1:30 p.m. (It was moved up an hour due to the potential for weather on Sunday afternoon).\n\nHow can I watch the Daytona 500?\n\nThe Daytona 500 airs on FOX and FOX 35 Orlando. The race started at 1:30 p.m. (It was moved up an hour due to the potential for weather on Sunday afternoon).\n\nWatch on TV or stream on FOX Local. FOX will then jump in with pre-race coverage of its own on TV.\n\nHow long is the race?\n\nThe Daytona 500 is a 500-mile race. Daytona International Speedway is a 2.5-mile track, which means it takes 200 laps to hit the 500-mile milestone.\n\nDaytona 500 Forecast: Is it going to rain?\n\nIt will be a warm and windy day in Central Florida, especially up the Interstate 4 corridor. Wind gusts are expected to be between 35-40 mph. Temperatures will be in the 80s.\n\nA cold front is expected to move through Daytona Beach in the afternoon and early evening hours, which would be during the Daytona 500 race.

        "source": "https://www.fox29.com/",
        "fullContent": "The Brief A Gallup poll found that 45% of Democrats want their party to be more moderate, an 11-point increase since 2021. Meanwhile, 43% of Republicans prefer their party's current ideology, with fewer calling for a more conservative shift. The results come after Donald Trump’s inauguration for his second term as president and Republican control of Congress.\n\n\n\nAfter losing the presidency and Senate in the 2024 election, an increasing number of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents say they want their party to become more moderate rather than maintain its current liberal stance.\n\nA Gallup poll, published last month, found that 45% of Democrats now favor a moderate shift, up from 34% in 2021. Meanwhile, 29% of Democrats still want their party to move in a more liberal direction, a five-point drop from 2021.\n\nAt the same time, Republicans are largely satisfied with their party's ideology under Trump, with 43% of GOP voters saying the party should stay the same. Only 28% want the party to become more conservative, a significant drop from 40% in 2021.\n\nWhat’s behind the shift?\n\nThe backstory:\n\nOne factor that may be influencing Democrats' preference for moderation is the party’s recent electoral losses. Following the 2024 election, Republicans took control of both the presidency and Senate, while maintaining a slim majority in the House of Representatives.\n\nFILE - Democratic leaders, including Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer, gather for a press conference at the U.S. Capitol. (Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)\n\nIn contrast, Republican satisfaction with their party's ideology may be a reflection of their support for Trump and the conservative policies his administration has begun enacting.\n\nHow views differ within each party\n\nBy the numbers:\n\nGallup's findings also reveal ideological divisions within both parties:\n\nLiberal Democrats (49% of Democrats overall) mostly want the party to be more liberal (45%) or remain the same (22%).\n\nModerate Democrats (43% of Democrats) overwhelmingly prefer a shift to the center (62%).\n\nConservative Republicans (two-thirds of GOP voters) are split: 45% favor the status quo, while 38% want a more conservative GOP.\n\nModerate Republicans are more likely to favor a centrist shift (50%), rather than staying the same (36%).\n\nThese divisions suggest that while moderate Democrats increasingly want their party to move to the center, moderate Republicans are somewhat less eager for change.\n\nWhat this means for the future\n\nThe Democratic Party's shift toward moderation could influence its strategy heading into the 2026 midterms. The party may seek to regain voter support by focusing on more centrist policies and appealing to swing voters.\n\nMeanwhile, the Republican Party appears to be more united in its current direction, with Trump maintaining strong support among GOP voters.\n\nAs both parties look ahead to future elections, their ideological shifts could play a key role in shaping the political landscape for years to come.",

After driving at least an hour, he crashed into a utility pole in a southern Delaware town, and attempted to run, but was caught by troopers.\n\n\n\nA West Chester man led Delaware State Police on a pursuit that stretched across a majority of the state, crossing through many jurisdictions, covering at least 45 miles, before crashing, attempting to run, but ultimately caught by troopers.\n\nThe chase began after New Castle County Police tried to pull him over due to a bare rim on the car he was driving.\n\nWhat we know:\n\nFriday afternoon, about 12:45, officials with Delaware State Police said troopers were contacted, saying New Castle County Police were pursuing a man driving a BMW with a Pennsylvania tag and driving on a bare rim.\n\nTroopers joined the pursuit after the driver, later identified as 22-year-old West Chester resident Thomas Casey, was seen heading south into Middletown, Delaware, on State Route 1.\n\nTimeline:\n\nAs the chase continued, parts of the BMW began to disengage from the vehicle, hurtling into the air. An unidentified metal object struck the hood of a DSP vehicle, tearing into the hood.\n\nNext, the metal brake caliper separated from the car and crashed into the windshield of a different DSP vehicle, almost hitting the trooper inside.\n\nAs they approached Dover, officials say Casey began to speed up. About 12 miles south of Dover, a trooper tried to lay down traffic spikes, Casey saw them in enough time to swerve, nearly hitting the trooper standing there.

        "fullContent": "The greatest pass of Jalen Hurts’ life, the first parade in Philadelphia history and a look at Josh Sweat’s future.\n\nRoob’s 10 Random Eagles Observations have now morphed into Roob’s 10 Random Eagles Offseason Observations, and that’s what they’ll remain until training camp starts in a little over five months.\n\nWow, that’s soon.\n\n1A. That dagger 46-yard touchdown to DeVonta Smith may have been Jalen Hurts’ greatest pass ever and certainly one of the greatest Super Bowl touchdowns ever. I’ve watched this one more than any play since 4th and 26, easily over 100 times, and it never ceases to astonish me. The Eagles already led 27-0 and had a 1st-and-10 on the Chiefs’ 46-yard-line after Avonte Maddox’s 4th-down pass breakup early in the third round quarter. Start with DeVonta, who separates from Chiefs corner Jaylen Watson right off the line of scrimmage. Watson tries to get a jam on Smith but can’t, and Smith just runs unimpeded at full speed down the field toward the end zone. Hurts has incredible protection on the play from his o-line and also Saquon Barkley and backup tight end Grant Calcaterra, who both pick up blitzes. He play-fakes to Barkley and when he unloads, there isn’t a Chief within five feet of him. He’s got a clean pocket to work in, and he takes time to get his feet under him, set and fire. Smith first turns around to look for the ball at the 30-yard-line, which is a split second before Hurts releases it. Smith never breaks stride. Never slows down. Their timing is perfect. And Smith doesn’t do anything to let Watson know the ball is on the way. Watson never turns around and never makes up that step that DeVonta has on him. Smith doesn’t have to move his hands until just before the ball arrives because the ball is heading precisely into his grasp. Smith jumps just a bit as he crosses the plane of the end zone and catches the ball a little off the ground. Watson immediately tackles Smith and tries to pry the ball away, but Smith wasn’t about to let go as he tumbles to the ground. Touchdown Eagles and a 34-0 lead. Smith and Hurts have known each other since Smith was in high school and Hurts was his host during his visit to Alabama. They’ve both talked often about how instead of partying they went to the football facility and threw and studied film. They’ve taken countless reps together since then, spent innumerable hours studying, thrown with each other every offseason. They’ve both put an insane amount of time together working toward this one moment, and on the biggest stage they showed what football perfection looks like.\n\nGet top local stories in Philly delivered to you every morning.

If you don’t think Sirianni has anything to do with the offense, that’s a must-see video. Sirianni kicked himself after Super Bowl LVII for not being aggressive enough, and he just wasn’t going to let it happen again. Brilliant.\n\n1C. The other unbelievable thing about that play — and you can see this in the end zone copy — is how quickly Saquon Barkley raises his fist. The ball is still on its upward trajectory and Saquon is already celebrating.\n\n2A. Nick Sirianni is only the second coach in NFL history to win six playoff games in his first four seasons. Joe Gibbs won six with Washington from 1981 through 1984. Tom Flores, John Fox, Mike Tomlin, Paul Brown, George Seifert and Bill Parcells each won five.\n\n2B. The Eagles won six playoff games from 1961 through 1999. They’ve won six playoff games since 2022.\n\n3. An underrated facet of the Eagles’ monster defensive performance last Sunday was the way they shut down the Chiefs’ running game while Kansas City was still trying to run the ball. The Chiefs were 3-for-3 rushing in the first half and they were 6-for-17 at the point the Eagles went up 34-0. They didn’t have a run from scrimmage longer than eight yards and Patrick Mahomes had a couple scrambles late, but the Chiefs’ running backs netted 24 total yards, 4th-fewest in Super Bowl history behind the 1985 Broncos (8), 2002 Raiders (16) and 1974 Vikings (17). The Chiefs realized early they couldn’t run against the Eagles, and Andy Reid stopped even trying while the game was still somewhat close. That let the Eagles’ defensive front tee off on the Chiefs’ hapless offensive line. Isiah Pacheco, who gashed the Eagles for 76 yards on 15 carries in Super Bowl LVII two years ago, ran three times for seven yards, and Kareem Hunt, who had a bounce-back season with 728 yards and seven TDs, managed nine yards on three carries. This defensive front is dangerous enough against a balanced offense. When it knows the other team is going to throw? Forget it. You have no shot.\n\n4. The first championship parade in Philadelphia history took place on Nov. 5, 1910, two weeks after the Athletics finished off the Cubs with a 7-2 win in Game 5 of the World Series at Chicago’s West Side Grounds. The parade route went south on Broad Street, starting at Montgomery, around the west side of City Hall, then south to Wolf Street. This was an evening parade, starting at 8 p.m. According to the Nov. 7, 1910, Inquirer “nearly a million” people watched, although according to the Delaware County Times, “The spectacle was witnessed by 100,000 persons.” I’m guessing the Inquirer’s estimate was closer to the actual attendance. A non-bylined columnist wrote: “The tribe of (Connie) Mack had brought distinction to the good, old town and everyone seemed imbued with the desire to give some expression of their appreciation. Everybody was there and everybody was happy.” Some things never change.\n\n5. Quarterbacks who’ve put up at least 33 points in multiple Super Bowls: Bart Starr, Joe Montana, Tom Brady, Jalen Hurts.\n\n6. Jake Elliott’s revival is one of the coolest stories of the 2024 postseason. He was so unreliable during the regular season, missing eight field goal attempts and going 1-for-7 from 50 yards and out (the rest of the league made 71 percent) and then he missed three PATs the first two weeks of the postseason, the second kicker in NFL history to miss three PATs in a single postseason, and then missed a 54-yarder in the NFC Championship Game. Not a chip shot but a 73 percent kick league-wide this year. So it wasn’t easy to be super confident in Elliott heading into the Super Bowl, although he was money in his first two. As a rookie, he made incredibly high-pressure kicks from 42 and 46 yards in the fourth quarter of Super Bowl LII in Minneapolis and then two years ago he was 2-for-2 in Glendale in Super Bowl LVII. So what does he do Sunday? After going 3-for-9 from 48 yards and out during the regular season, he matches his entire season total of 48-yard kicks with field goals from 48, 48 and 50 yards. He became the first kicker ever with three field goals of at least 48 yards in the same Super Bowl and only the second with three career 48-yarders in a Super Bowl. Elliott is now responsible for three of the 14-longest Super Bowl field goals ever and his 9-for-9 in Super Bowls is the best ever. Overall, Elliott was 10-for-11 this postseason, and he’s now 26-for-27 in his career in the postseason for 96.3 percent, 2nd-highest ever (minimum 20 attempts) behind Robbie Gould’s 29-for-29. Who he can’t catch. Elliott is one of only seven kickers to play in three Super Bowls and along with Lane Johnson, Brandon Graham and Rick Lovato, he’s one of four Eagles to win two Super Bowls. A month ago, what to do with Elliott seemed like it would be a huge question this offseason. But he proved he’s still got it, and he did it in some high-leverage situations. After that performance? He’s not going anywhere.\n\n7. Somebody needs to explain Josh Sweat’s last couple years to me. Coming off his 11-sack 2022 season, he opens 2023 with a dominating 6 ½ sacks in his first nine games, then goes 12 straight games over the 2023 and 2024 seasons without a sack. Starting in Week 4 this year, he picks up seven sacks in eight games and looks unstoppable again, then gets one sack in his next eight games. Going into the Super Bowl you know Brandon Graham isn’t going to play much, Bryce Huff will be inactive and Sweat is in another lengthy slump, and you’re thinking Nolan Smith is the only edge guy who’s going to be able to generate pressure. Then all Sweat does in Super Bowl LIX is record a career-high 2 ½ sacks – 5th-most in Super Bowl history – along with two QB hits and two tackles for loss. He picked the biggest game of his life for the best game of his life. Remember how Derrick Burgess parlayed a huge NFC Championship Game in 2004 against Michael Vick and the Falcons into a huge (at the time) five-year, $17.5 million contract with the Raiders? Burgess only had 2 ½ sacks during the 2004 regular season but had 3.0 in the playoffs. Obviously, Sweat’s production is beyond Burgess’s, but the dynamic is similar. An edge rusher who made himself a ton of money with a huge postseason. Everybody is looking for edge rushers, and with Smith having a breakthrough season and Jalyx Hunt popping late in the season – 1 ½ sacks , three QB hits and one tackle for loss in the regular season, 1 ½ sacks, three QB hits and one tackle for loss in the playoffs – I could see the Eagles going with those two plus a high draft pick in their edge rotation and not over-paying to keep Sweat. And because of his contract, Huff will still be here and get an opportunity to find a spot in the rotation as well. Sweat’s been a very good if inconsistent player during his seven years here. He’s 8th in Eagles history with 48 sacks, and he’s still only 27. Sweat says he wants to be here and expects to get something done, and I’m sure Howie Roseman would love to keep him. I’m just not sure the numbers will agree. If he hits the open market, he’s going to get offers the Eagles may not be able to match.\n\n8A. The last two Super Bowl-winning quarterbacks drafted outside the first round are Nick Foles and Jalen Hurts.\n\n8B. The Eagles are the only team in NFL history to draft two Super Bowl-winning quarterbacks outside the first round.\n\n8C. The only other teams that have drafted two QBs who’ve each won a Super Bowl for the team that drafted them are the Cowboys (Roger Staubach, Troy Aikman), Packers (Bart Starr, Aaron Rodgers), Giants (Phil Simms, Jeff Hostetler) and Steelers (Terry Bradshaw, Ben Roethlisberger).\n\n8D. Remember, the Falcons drafted Brett Favre, the Patriots drafted Jim Plunkett, the Steelers drafted Len Dawson, the Chargers drafted Eli Manning and the Buccaneers drafted Steve Young and Doug Williams.\n\n9A. Four interior linemen in Eagles history have had 2.0 or more sacks in a single postseason. One is Darwin Walker in 2006. The others are Jalen Carter, Milton Williams and Jordan Davis this year.\n\n9B. The Eagles are the first team in NFL history to have three interior linemen record multiple sacks in the same postseason. Only two teams – the 1992 and 1995 Cowboys – also had more than one – Tony Casillas and Russell Maryland in 1992 and Chad Hennings and Leon Lett in 1995. Both those Cowboys teams beat the Eagles in the conference semifinals.\n\n9C. Eagles interior defensive linemen had 13 ½ postseason sacks from 1982 – when sacks became an official NFL stat – through 2023. Eagles interior defensive linemen had 7.0 sacks this year. So 34 percent of the postseason sacks interior linemen have ever recorded for the Eagles came this year.\n\n10. Jalen Hurts had one passing touchdown and three rushing touchdowns in his first Super Bowl and two passing TDs and one rushing TD this time. His seven total touchdowns are most ever by a quarterback in his first two Super Bowls. Joe Montana previously had the most with five TDs in his first two Super Bowls. Only five quarterbacks have more career Super Bowl touchdowns than Hurts: Tom Brady (21), Montana (13), Patrick Mahomes (11), Terry Bradshaw (9) and Roger Staubach (8).\n\nSubscribe to Eagle Eye anywhere you get your podcasts:\n\nApple Podcasts | YouTube Music | Spotify | Stitcher | Simplecast | RSS | Watch on YouTube",

        "source": "https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/",
        "fullContent": "The Eagles had a parade on Broad Street on Friday but they also took care of some business.\n\nThey signed 13 players to futures contracts on Friday. Futures contracts are for players who were not on a 53-man roster at the conclusion of the regular season. These contracts will count toward the 90-man roster when the new league year begins in March.\n\nOf these 13 players, 12 were on the Eagles practice squad in the lead up to the Super Bowl. The only one that wasn’t (WR Elijah Cooks) was on the practice squad for a week in January.\n\nLet’s take a closer look:\n\nGet top local stories in Philly delivered to you every morning. Sign up for NBC Philadelphia's News Headlines newsletter.\n\nDB Tariq Castro-Fields: Castro-Fields (6-1, 197) spent a lot of the 2024 season on the Eagles’ practice squad. He was a 6th-round pick out of Penn State in 2022, taken by the 49ers. Castro-Fields actually played in 10 games with 1 start for the Commanders in 2022 and 2023 and in 2024 played in 2 games with the Carolina Panthers. In his NFL career, Castro-Fields has played 27 snaps on defense and 109 on special teams. He has not appeared in a game for the Eagles.\n\nWR Elijah Cooks: Cooks (6-4, 215) went undrafted out of San Jose State in 2023. He was with the Jaguars and played in 11 games over two seasons. He had 3 catches for 38 yards in those games. Cooks began his college career at Nevada but in his one year at San Jose State had 69 catches for 1,076 yards and 10 touchdowns. Cooks was with the Eagles’ practice squad for a week in January.\n\nRB Tyrion Davis-Price: After being taken in the 3rd round of the 2022 draft out of LSU, Davis-Price played in just 7 games in 2022 and 2023 with the 49ers before getting cut. He spent this past season on the Eagles’ practice squad and played in one game. He had 3 carries for 7 yards on Dec. 29 against the Cowboys. In the preseason, Davis-Price had 22 carries for 118 yards.\n\nLB Dallas Gant: Gant (6-2, 224) went undrafted out of Toledo in 2024 after previously playing at Ohio State. He was with the Vikings in training camp and spent the first couple months on their practice squad before getting released and joining the Eagles’ practice squad. Gant was elevated for two games — the final two of the regular season. He played 26 snaps on special teams.\n\nWR Danny Gray: Another former 49ers pick, Gray was selected in the 3rd round out of SMU in 2022. Gray (6-0, 200) played in 13 games as a rookie and had 1 catch for 10 yards. Gray had a productive couple seasons at SMU as a receiver and return man. Gray has track speed; he ran a 4.33 at the combine.\n\nDT Gabe Hall: The Eagles signed Hall (6-6, 295) as an undrafted free agent out of Baylor this season. He spent the entire year on the Eagles’ practice squad. Hall made some plays in training camp as a rookie and is worth taking a look at in Year 2.\n\nDE K.J. Henry: The Commanders drafted Henry (6-4, 255) in the 5th round out of Clemson in the 2023 draft. In the last two years (with the Commanders, Bengals and Cowboys) Henry has played in 14 games with 3 starts and has 2 1/2 sacks. He has also played 144 special teams snaps. Henry has not played in a game for the Eagles.\n\nLB Ochaun Mathis: The Rams drafted Mathis (6-5, 260) in the 6th round out of Nebraska in the 2023 draft. Mathis played in the Baltimore game in 2024 and had 9 special teams snaps. In his NFL career, Mathis has played in 14 games.\n\nTE Nick Muse: The Eagles didn’t sign Muse (6-5, 252) to their practice squad until January. The Vikings selected him in the 7th round out of South Carolina in 2022. He played in 16 games over three seasons with the Vikings and had 1 catch for 22 yards.\n\nDB Parry Nickerson: The Eagles kept the 30-year-old veteran around all season after a strong training camp. Nickerson has played in 30 games with 3 starts in his NFL career and was with Vic Fangio in Miami in 2023, playing five games for the Dolphins.\n\nDB Andre’ Sam: Everyone knew it was Saquon Barkley and Cooper DeJean’s birthday on Super Bowl Sunday but it was also Sam’s birthday! Sam turned 26 as the Eagles beat the Chiefs. Sam played in one game this season against the Panthers; 12 special teams snaps.\n\nOT Laekin Vakalahi: The Eagles had an international exemption for Vakalahi, who is from Australia. He was the 17th member of the practice squad all season and will have another exemption spot in 2025.\n\nDB A.J. Woods: Woods (5-9, 186) went undrafted out of Pitt in 2024. He initially signed with the Commanders and signed with the Eagles’ practice squad in early September. He didn’t see any game action in 2024.\n\nSubscribe to Eagle Eye anywhere you get your podcasts:\n\nApple Podcasts | YouTube Music | Spotify | Stitcher | Simplecast | RSS | Watch on YouTube",

        "source": "https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/",
        "fullContent": "The Trump administration has begun firing several hundred Federal Aviation Administration employees, upending staff on a busy air travel weekend and just weeks after a January fatal mid-air collision at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport.\n\nProbationary workers were targeted in late-night emails Friday notifying them they had been fired, David Spero, president of the Professional Aviation Safety Specialists union, said in a statement.\n\nThe impacted workers include personnel hired for FAA radar, landing and navigational aid maintenance, one air traffic controller told the Associated Press. The air traffic controller was not authorized to talk to the media and spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\nSpero said messages began arriving after 7 p.m. on Friday and continued late into the night. More might be notified over the long weekend or barred from entering FAA buildings on Tuesday, he said.\n\nGet top local stories in Philly delivered to you every morning. Sign up for NBC Philadelphia's News Headlines newsletter.\n\nThe employees were fired “without cause nor based on performance or conduct,” Spero said, and the emails were “from an ‘exec order’ Microsoft email address” — not a government email address.\n\nThe firings hit the FAA when it faces a shortfall in controllers. Federal officials have been raising concerns about an overtaxed and understaffed air traffic control system for years, especially after a series of close calls between planes at U.S. airports. Among the reasons they have cited for staffing shortages are uncompetitive pay, long shifts, intensive training and mandatory retirements.\n\nIn the Jan. 29 fatal crash between a U.S. Army Black Hawk helicopter and an American Airlines passenger jet, which is still under investigation, one controller was handling both commercial airline and helicopter traffic at the busy airport.\n\nJust days before the collision, President Donald Trump had already fired all the members of the Aviation Security Advisory Committee, a panel mandated by Congress after the 1988 PanAm 103 bombing over Lockerbie, Scotland. The committee is charged with examining safety issues at airlines and airports.\n\nOne FAA employee who was fired over the weekend suggested he was targeted for his views on Tesla and X, formerly Twitter, not as part of a general probationary-level sweep. Both are owned by Elon Musk, who is leading Trump's effort to cut the federal government.\n\nCharles Spitzer-Stadtlander posted on LinkedIn that he was fired just after midnight Saturday, days after he started getting harassing messages on Facebook.\n\n“The official DOGE Facebook page started harassing me on my personal Facebook account after I criticized Tesla and Twitter,\" Spitzer-Stadtlander wrote. “Less than a week later, I was fired, despite my position allegedly being exempted due to national security.”\n\nHe added: \"When DOGE fired me, they turned off my computer and wiped all of my files without warning.”\n\nSpitzer-Stadtlander said he was supposed to be exempted from the probationary firings because the FAA office he worked in focused on national security threats such as attacks on the national airspace by drones.\n\nThe Musk-led Department of Government Efficiency did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The firings were first reported by CNN.\n\n—-\n\nAssociated Press writer Ellen Knickmeyer contributed from Washington.",

        "source": "https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/",
        "fullContent": "The Trump administration on Saturday terminated hundreds of employees at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, including fellows responsible for key public health roles, according to two sources who spoke to NBC News at the agency who spoke on the condition of anonymity out of concern over retaliation.\n\nAmong them were about two dozen workers who made up the Laboratory Leadership Service, or LLS, a group responsible for training public health laboratory staffers and supporting outbreak response efforts. The two-year fellowship program launched in 2015, focusing on laboratory safety and regulatory compliance.\n\n“We have come up with a new slogan for LLS: ‘the disease detectors.’ If you’re not testing, you don’t know what disease is there,” a current fellow, who was among those who received termination notices, told NBC News.\n\nTermination emails, which were sent to LLS staff members Saturday evening, cited poor performance as the reason for the firings, even though most of the dismissed employees have “excellent” performance reviews, a midlevel CDC official said.\n\nGet top local stories in Philly delivered to you every morning. Sign up for NBC Philadelphia's News Headlines newsletter.\n\nMultiple outlets reported that a larger sister program at CDC called the Epidemic Intelligence Service, or EIS, known as the agency’s “disease detectives,” was expected to be cut significantly, as well. As of Sunday, though, the two officials who spoke to NBC News had not heard of firings at EIS. One, a senior CDC official, said everyone who was going to be terminated had been notified by Sunday.\n\n\"Even if EIS was spared, there are multiple other fellowships that were not, and that's a pipeline for the next generation of CDC leaders,\" the senior official said. \"We're being cut off at the knees. It is going to cripple public health for decades.\"\n\nOther departments that had cuts included the Presidential Management Fellows, which aims to develop future public health leaders, and the Public Health Associate Program, which assigns fellows to local health agencies, the two officials said.\n\nThe termination process has been marked by chaos and a lack of transparency.\n\nAlmost two weeks ago, the Office of Personnel Management assigned CDC leadership to look through a list of employees who were in probationary or term-limited positions — including new directors, fellows and highly skilled noncitizen scientists — and designate each as “must be retained,” “mission critical” or “not mission critical.” According to the two CDC officials, the lists did not appear to have been used in the ultimate firing decisions.\n\nRepresentatives for the White House, the CDC and the Department of Health and Human Services did not immediately reply to requests for comment.\n\nPresident Donald Trump signed a memorandum Thursday which seeks to impose \"fair and reciprocal\" trade tariffs on all major U.S. trading partners, including longtime allies.\n\nIn recent years, LLS fellows have assisted with dengue fever testing in American Samoa and Oropouche virus testing in Florida. In 2020, the group oversaw Covid-19 testing for thousands of Arizona residents.\n\nThe LLS fellows who received the termination notice said their co-workers were less concerned about their jobs than about what the moves signaled for public health.\n\n\"A lot of us, we could have gone to more lucrative careers,\" said the fellow, who spoke on the condition of anonymity out of concern of compromising their remaining weeks of paid leave. \"We could have worked for pharma. We could have worked for biotech or something like that and made so much more money. But we're all passionate for public health and just want to see public health succeed.\"\n\nThe dismissal messages were sent the day after the Trump administration informed CDC leaders of plans to fire nearly 1,300 probationary employees at the agency, roughly one-tenth of its total workforce.\n\nA representative for the Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees the CDC, previously said the cuts were a part of the administration’s larger effort to reduce the size of the federal workforce.\n\n“HHS is following the Administration’s guidance and taking action to support the President’s broader efforts to restructure and streamline the federal government. This is to ensure that HHS better serves the American people at the highest and most efficient standard,” Andrew Nixon, the department’s director of communications, wrote.\n\nAs part of broad-based cuts to the federal government implemented by the Trump administration and Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency, the Office of Personnel Management officials last week directed leaders of federal agencies to dismiss probationary employees, potentially affecting hundreds of thousands of people classified under that status. Since the directive was sent out, at least some probationary employees have been sent notices by the departments of Veterans Affairs and Transportation.\n\nThis article first appeared on NBCNews.com.

        "fullContent": "As President Donald Trump approaches the first-month mark in his second term, he has moved with dizzying speed and blunt force to reorder American social and political norms and the economy while redefining the U.S. role in the world.\n\nAt the same time, he has empowered Elon Musk, an unelected, South African-born billionaire, to help engineer the firing of thousands of federal employees and potentially shutter entire agencies created by Congress.\n\nThose efforts have largely overshadowed Trump's crackdowns on immigration and the U.S.-Mexico border, and his efforts to remake social policy by wiping out diversity, equity and inclusion programs and rolling back transgender rights.\n\nThe president has also imposed scores of new tariffs against U.S. trade partners and threatened more, even as economists warn that will pass costs on to U.S. consumers and feed inflation.\n\nGet top local stories in Philly delivered to you every morning. Sign up for NBC Philadelphia's News Headlines newsletter.\n\nHere's a look at the first four weeks:\n\nMass federal firings begin\n\nNews4's Dominique Moody had new reaction from a federal worker affected by recent mass layoffs.\n\nThe Trump administration fired thousands of workers who were still in probationary periods common among new hires. Some had less than an hour to leave their offices.\n\nThose potentially losing jobs include medical scientists, energy infrastructure specialists, foreign service employees, FBI agents, prosecutors, educational and farming data experts, overseas aid workers and even human resources personnel who would otherwise have to manage the dismissals.\n\nAt the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which was created to protect the public after the 2008 financial crisis, employees say the administration not only wants to cut nearly the entire workforce but also erase all its data from the past 12 years. The administration agreed to pause any further dismantling of the agency until March 3, under a judge's order.\n\nWhile Trump promised to turn Washington upside down, his moves could have far-reaching implications for thousands of federal employees around the country and drive up the unemployment rate if large numbers of layoffs happen at once.\n\nLegal challenges mount\n\nCourt challenges to Trump’s policies started on Inauguration Day and have continued at a furious pace since Jan. 20. The administration is facing some 70 lawsuits nationwide challenging his executive orders and moves to downsize the federal government.\n\nThe Republican-controlled Congress is putting up little resistance, so the court system is ground zero for pushback. Judges have issued more than a dozen orders at least temporarily blocking aspects of Trump's agenda, ranging from an executive order to end U.S. citizenship extended automatically to people born in this country to giving Musk's team access to sensitive federal data.\n\nWhile many of those judges were nominated by Democratic presidents, Trump has gotten unfavorable rulings from judges picked by Republican presidents, too. Trump suggested he could target the judiciary, saying, “Maybe we have to look at the judges.\" The administration has said in the meantime that it will appeal, while White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt railed against the orders slowing the president's agenda, calling each “an abuse of the rule of law.”\n\nThe administration has notched a few wins, too, most significantly when a judge allowed it to move forward with a deferred resignation program spearheaded by Musk.\n\nThe economic outlook worsens\n\nAmid the policy upheaval, the latest economic data could prompt some White House worries.\n\nInflation rose at a monthly rate of 0.5% in January, according to the Labor Department. Over the past three months, the consumer price index has increased at an annual rate of 4.5% -- a sign that inflation is heating up again after having cooled for much of 2024.\n\nTrump told voters he could lower inflation, and do so almost immediately after taking office. But Leavitt, while blaming Trump's predecessor, Democrat Joe Biden, acknowledged the latest inflation indicators were \"worse than expected.”\n\nMore trouble signs came when the Commerce Department reported that retail sales slumped 0.9% on a monthly basis in January. A drop that large could signal a weakening in consumer confidence and economic growth.\n\nThe Federal Reserve’s report on industrial production also found that factory output slipped 0.1% in January, largely due to a 5.2% drop in the making of motor vehicles and parts.\n\nThese could all be blips, which means the monthly data in February will really matter.\n\nThe ‘fair trade’ Trump wants isn't necessarily fair\n\nPresident Donald Trump signed a memorandum Thursday which seeks to impose \"fair and reciprocal\" trade tariffs on all major U.S. trading partners, including longtime allies.\n\nAfter previously imposing tariffs on China and readying import taxes on Canada and Mexico, Trump rolled out what he called the “big one.” He said his administration would put together new tariffs in the coming weeks and months to match what other countries charge.\n\nOther nations hardly find Trump’s approach fair.\n\nFrom their vantage point, he is including items other than tariffs such as value added taxes, which are akin to sales taxes. That means the rates could be much higher than a standard tariff in Europe.\n\nOn top of that, Trump plans separate additional tariffs on autos, computer chips and pharmaceuticals, in addition to the 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum that he announced on Monday.\n\nIt is not clear whether these trade penalties are mainly negotiating tools or ways for Trump to raise revenues. So far, he has suggested that they are both.\n\nCongress watches its authority erode. But there are signs of pushback\n\nCongress finds itself confounded by the onslaught as its institutional power — as the Constitution’s first branch of government with its unmatched authority over federal spending — is being eroded in real time.\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., said he finds the work of Musk's team “very exciting.” Johnson said Trump is “taking legitimate executive action.\"\n\nBut even among congressional Republicans there were small signs of protest emerging — letters being written and phone calls being made — to protect their home-state interests and constituents as funding for programs, services and government contracts is being dismantled.\n\nRep. Carlos Gimenez, R-Fla., urged the Homeland Security Department not to issue blanket deportations for Venezuelan migrants who fled their country and now call the Miami-area home. “I’m not powerless. I’m a member of Congress,” he said.\n\nDemocratic lawmakers have joined protesters outside shuttered federal offices, arguing Trump and Musk had gone too far. Democrats suggested legislation to protect various programs, and even filed articles of impeachment against the president over his plans to bulldoze and redevelop Gaza.\n\nTrump wants a new world order\n\nWith his phone call to Russian President Vladimir Putin this past week, Trump is hoping he initiated the beginning of the end of the Kremlin's war on Ukraine.\n\nThe leaders agreed to have their teams “start negotiations immediately.” After getting off the phone with Putin, Trump called Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to discuss getting both sides to the negotiating table.\n\nThe Putin call is a monumental development in a war that has left hundreds of thousands dead or seriously wounded.\n\nBut the way ahead remains complicated.\n\nZelenskyy said he will not meet with Putin until a plan for peace is hammered out by Trump. Trump has gotten blowback when European leaders sharply criticized him and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth for suggesting that NATO membership was not in the cards for Ukraine.\n\nThe White House faces a further quandary with Zelenskyy wanting the U.S. and other countries to provide security guarantees for Ukraine, and Zelenskyy insisting that he and Trump iron out an agreement on the contours of any peace deal.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Aamer Madhani in Munich and AP Congressional Correspondent Lisa Mascaro contributed to this report.",

And they are going to interview Eagles quarterbacks coach Doug Nussmeier for their offensive coordinator vacancy, NFL Network’s Ian Rapoport reported.\n\nWhile Eagles head coach Nick Sirianni definitely doesn’t like the idea of his staff getting poached, there’s nothing he can do about a position coach taking a coordinator role.

While Staley might be the favorite, Parker is an attractive candidate.\n\nIn his first year with the Eagles under Vic Fangio, Parker’s defensive backs had a tremendous season. The Eagles had the No. 1 pass defense in the NFL on their way to a Super Bowl win. The Eagles got high-level play from two rookies in Quinyon Mitchell and Cooper DeJean. And the entire secondary worked in harmony this season.\n\nParker, 33, coached under Fangio in Denver in 2021 and stayed there from 2021-23 as their defensive backs coach.

        "fullContent": "An IRS employee who is affiliated with the Department of Government Efficiency is expected to seek access to an IRS system that houses sensitive taxpayer information, an administration official told NBC News.\n\nThe access would be to the Integrated Data Retrieval System, which allows IRS employees to access taxpayer accounts. An administration official originally said that the employee had been granted access but later clarified that the employee was expected to seek access and was not already in the system.\n\nThe IDRS allows employees to have “instantaneous visual access to certain taxpayer accounts,” according to the IRS website. The system can be used for “researching account information and requesting returns” and “automatically generating notices, collection documents and other outputs.”\n\nGet top local stories in Philly delivered to you every morning. Sign up for NBC Philadelphia's News Headlines newsletter.\n\nIDRS users “are authorized to access only those accounts required to accomplish their official duties,” according to the IRS website.\n\nThe person in question is an IRS employee who started during the second Trump administration and is affiliated with DOGE, the official confirmed. The official said the employee was carrying out the \"DOGE mission\" and acting “legally and with the appropriate security clearances.”\n\n\"Waste, fraud, and abuse have been deeply entrenched in our broken system for far too long,\" White House spokesperson Harrison Fields said when asked about the employee's potential access to the sensitive system. \"It takes direct access to the system to identify and fix it.\n\n\"DOGE will continue to shine a light on the fraud they uncover as the American people deserve to know what their government has been spending their hard-earned tax dollars on,\" Fields added.\n\nThe IRS did not immediately respond to requests for comment Sunday evening.\n\nThe move, first reported by The Washington Post, is an expansion of DOGE's efforts to access sensitive information held by the federal government.\n\nPresident Donald Trump signed a memorandum Thursday which seeks to impose \"fair and reciprocal\" trade tariffs on all major U.S. trading partners, including longtime allies.\n\nDOGE, headed by Elon Musk, has zeroed in on several government agencies and departments in an effort to cut what the administration paints as wasteful spending. DOGE has aimed to cut members of the federal workforce.\n\nNBC News has reported that DOGE has accessed the Treasury Department’s payment system, which stores sensitive information like Social Security numbers. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem also said this month that President Donald Trump authorized Musk to access FEMA disaster data.\n\nThe group has also taken aim at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the U.S. Agency for International Development.\n\nThis article first appeared on NBCNews.com.

        "fullContent": "Letters went out to dozens of probationary employees in at least one section of the Department of Transportation that said part of the reason they were being fired was for poor performance, according to a copy of the letter obtained by NBC News.\n\nBut as a source familiar and a secondary document viewed by NBC News laid out, most of those employees were rated as being “exceptional” performers by their supervisors.\n\nWe’re looking to hear from federal government workers. If you’re willing to talk with us, please email us at tips@nbcuni.com or contact us through one of these methods.\n\n“Employee has demonstrated exceptional performance and has no conduct issues,” supervisor reviews read for many of the laid-off workers.\n\nGet top local stories in Philly delivered to you every morning. Sign up for NBC Philadelphia's News Headlines newsletter.\n\n“These letters that we’re sending these employees, I feel so bad because they’re lying,” the person familiar said. “All of them, pretty much, were exceptional performers. It’s just crazy to me.”\n\nThe firings come as the Trump administration steps up its purge of the federal workforce. But they’re being done so quickly, and are often directed by people with no government experience, that agencies are having to contend with the messy fallout — which has included trying to un-fire people.\n\nOn Thursday, Office of Personnel Management officials notified agencies that they should cut loose their probationary employees, which could affect hundreds of thousands of people, according to OPM data, though the exact number of those who will be let go was not immediately clear.\n\nProbationary status has nothing to do with performance; it typically indicates someone who has been working in the federal government for less than two years — before full civil service protections kick in. It can also apply to longtime civil service workers who move to a different agency or job.\n\nRobert F. Kennedy Jr. was confirmed by the Senate as the Secretary of Health and Human Services on Thursday.\n\n“The U.S. Department of Transportation finds, that based on your performance you have not demonstrated that your further employment at the Department of Transportation would be in the public interest,” the letter to fired staffers read. “For this reason, the Department of Transportation is removing you from your position with the Department of Transportation and the federal civil service effective today.”\n\nFederal regulations state that probationary employees “shall” be terminated during the probationary period “if the employee fails to demonstrate fully his or her qualifications for continued employment.” Moreover, regulations state that “information in the notice as to why the employee is being terminated shall, as a minimum, consist of the agency’s conclusions as to the inadequacies of his performance or conduct.”\n\nA Department of Transportation spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment, nor did the White House. McLaurine Pinover, an OPM spokesperson, deferred to the Department of Transportation and said the administration would not be able to provide full details on how many probationary employees were cut across the government until Tuesday.\n\n“The probationary period is a continuation of the job application process, not an entitlement for permanent employment,” an OPM spokesperson said in an earlier statement. “Agencies are taking independent action in light of the recent hiring freeze and in support of the President’s broader efforts to restructure and streamline the federal government to better serve the American people at the highest possible standard.”\n\nWith the Trump administration seeking to cut up to 10% of the federal workforce, mass firings have at times been done in a haphazard manner. One employee at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau who was told they were fired provided NBC News with a copy of a letter informing them of their termination that did not even include their name. Instead, it was addressed to “[EmployeeFirstName] [EmployeeLastName]” and was filled with other placeholder text including “[JobTitle],” “[Division]” and “[AppointmentDate].”\n\nAnd on Friday, National Nuclear Security Administration officials sought to notify some employees who were fired the day before that they are now due to be reinstated — but struggled to find them because they didn’t have their new contact information.\n\n“The termination letters for some NNSA probationary employees are being rescinded, but we do not have a good way to get in touch with those personnel,” read an email sent to NNSA employees and obtained by NBC News.\n\nIn addition to the potential for hundreds of thousands of probationary employees to be let go, the White House has said about 75,000 people have accepted their offer of “deferred resignation” as of Wednesday, though NBC News cannot independently verify that total. The federal government employs more than 2 million workers, and their total compensation makes up about 6.6% of the overall budget.\n\nAttorney General Pam Bondi announced the Trump administration sued the state of New York due to policies that are blocking federal authorities from enforcing immigration laws.\n\nJudges have halted some of this wide-ranging effort to rapidly upend the government, though a federal judge did allow the deferred resignation program to move forward.\n\nCommenting on the legality of his administration’s actions on Saturday, President Donald Trump posted a remark on social media that has generally been attributed to the French leader Napoleon Bonaparte.\n\n“He who saves his Country does not violate any Law,” Trump wrote.\n\nThis article first appeared on NBCNews.com.

        "fullContent": "Pope Francis’ respiratory tract infection is presenting a “complex clinical picture” that will require further hospitalization, the Vatican said Monday as concerns grew about the increasingly frail health of the 88-year-old pontiff.\n\nVatican spokesman Matteo Bruni said the results of tests conducted in recent days and Monday indicate the pope is suffering from a “polymicrobial respiratory tract infection” that has necessitated a further change in his drug therapy. Scientists say polymicrobial diseases are caused by a mix of viruses, bacteria, fungi and parasites.\n\nThere was no timeframe given for his hospitalization, which has already sidelined him for longer than a 2023 hospitalization for pneumonia. Bruni said the complexity of his symptoms “will require an appropriate hospital stay.”\n\nFrancis was admitted to Rome’s Gemelli hospital in a “fair” condition on Friday after a weeklong bout of bronchitis worsened. Doctors confirmed a respiratory tract infection and prescribed “absolute rest” alongside unspecified drug therapies. Subsequent updates said his slight fever had gone away and that he was in “stable” condition.\n\nGet top local stories in Philly delivered to you every morning. Sign up for NBC Philadelphia's News Headlines newsletter.\n\nBruni said Francis, ate breakfast and read the newspapers Monday morning after a third peaceful night.\n\nThe Argentine pope, who had part of one lung removed after a pulmonary infection as a young man, is a known workaholic who keeps up a grueling pace despite his increasingly precarious health. He uses a wheelchair, walker or cane because of bad knees and suffers from sciatica nerve pain. In 2021 he had 33 centimeters (13 inches) of his colon removed because of a narrowing, and then had a further surgery in 2023 to remove intestinal scar tissue and repair an abdominal hernia.\n\nWhen he had a bad case of pneumonia in 2023, he left the hospital after three days and only acknowledged after the fact that he had been admitted urgently after feeling faint and having a sharp pain in his chest. This time around, Francis insisted on finishing his morning audiences Friday before leaving the Vatican, even though he was having trouble speaking at length because he was short of breath.\n\nFrancis' continued hospitalization has already forced the cancellation of some events connected to the Vatican's Holy Year and put others in question. The Holy See has only confirmed canceled appointments through Monday. Francis was supposed to have gone to Rome’s Cinecitta film studios to meet with artists as part of the Catholic Church’s Holy Year celebrations.\n\nThe pope's next scheduled appointment is his weekly general audience Wednesday. Beyond that, he is scheduled to preside on Sunday at the ordination of deacons as part of a Holy Year weekend dedicated to deacons. Francis' participation in both appears in doubt, but they remain on the official Vatican schedule.\n\nWhen he missed the Jubilee Mass dedicated to artists this past Sunday, a cardinal stood in for him.\n\n___\n\nMedical writer Maria Cheng contributed from London.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press religion coverage receives support through the AP’s collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

Trump’s envoy Steve Witkoff told Fox News Sunday that he and national security adviser Mike Waltz also will take part in the talks.\n\nPeskov said the talks will be primarily focused on “restoring the entire complex of U.S.-Russian relations, as well as preparing possible talks on the Ukrainian settlement and organizing a meeting of the two presidents.\"\n\nGet top local stories in Philly delivered to you every morning. Sign up for NBC Philadelphia's News Headlines newsletter.\n\nSpeaking to journalists on a conference call from the United Arab Emirates on Monday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said his country won’t take part in the talks this week, adding that they would “yield no results,” given the absence of any Ukrainian officials. European governments have also demanded a role.\n\nThe talks follow last week’s telephone call between Trump and Putin in which Trump said they “agreed to have our respective teams start negotiations immediately.” The call upended years of U.S. policy, ending the isolation of Moscow over its Feb. 24, 2022, invasion of Ukraine. After the call with Putin, Trump phoned Zelenskyy to inform him about their conversation.\n\nTrump on Sunday told reporters that Zelenskyy “will be involved,” but did not elaborate.\n\nZelenskyy said he would travel to Turkey on Monday and to Saudi Arabia on Wednesday, but that his trip to the Arab nation was unrelated to planned U.S.-Russia talks there on Tuesday.\n\nAndriy Yermak, a top Zelenskyy adviser, said earlier Sunday there was no possibility of Ukrainian and Russian representatives meeting directly in the immediate future. In a Telegram post, Yermak said the Ukrainians weren’t planning to do so “until we develop a plan” to end the war and bring about a “just peace.”\n\nSpeaking on Fox News Channel’s “Sunday Morning Futures” program, Witkoff said he and Waltz will be “having meetings at the direction of the president,” and hope to make “some really good progress with regard to Russia-Ukraine.”\n\nIn his TV interview, Witkoff didn’t directly respond to a question about whether Ukraine would have to give up a “significant portion” of its territory as part of any negotiated settlement.\n\n“Those are details, and I’m not dismissive of the details, they’re important. But I think the beginning here is trust-building. It’s getting everybody to understand that this war does not belong continuing, that it should end. That’s what the president has directed us to do,” he said.",

        "fullContent": "Trump administration tries to bring back fired nuclear weapons workers\n\nWASHINGTON -- The Trump administration has halted the firings of hundreds of federal employees who were tasked with working on the nation's nuclear weapons programs, in an about-face that has left workers confused and experts cautioning that DOGE's blind cost cutting will put communities at risk.\n\nThree U.S. officials who spoke to The Associated Press said up to 350 employees at the National Nuclear Security Administration were abruptly laid off late Thursday, with some losing access to email before they'd learned they were fired, only to try to enter their offices on Friday morning to find they were locked out. The officials spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation.\n\nOne of the hardest hit offices was the Pantex Plant near Amarillo, Texas, which saw about 30% of the cuts. Those employees work on reassembling warheads, one of the most sensitive jobs across the nuclear weapons enterprise, with the highest levels of clearance.\n\nThe hundreds let go at NNSA were part of a DOGE purge across the Department of Energy that targeted about 2,000 employees.\n\n\"The DOGE people are coming in with absolutely no knowledge of what these departments are responsible for,\" said Daryl Kimball, executive director of the Arms Control Association, referencing Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency team. \"They don't seem to realize that it's actually the department of nuclear weapons more than it is the Department of Energy.\"\n\nBy late Friday night, the agency's acting director, Teresa Robbins, issued a memo rescinding the firings for all but 28 of those hundreds of fired staff members.\n\nALSO SEE: IRS will lay off thousands of probationary workers in the middle of tax season\n\n\"This letter serves as formal notification that the termination decision issued to you on Feb. 13, 2025 has been rescinded, effective immediately,\" said the memo, which was obtained by the AP.\n\nThe accounts from the three officials contradict an official statement from the Department of Energy, which said fewer than 50 National Nuclear Security Administration staffers were let go, calling them \"probationary employees\" who \"held primarily administrative and clerical roles.\"\n\nBut that wasn't the case. The firings prompted one NNSA senior staffer to post a warning and call to action.\n\n\"This is a pivotal moment. We must decide whether we are truly committed to leading on the world stage or if we are content with undermining the very systems that secure our nation's future,\" deputy division director Rob Plonski posted to LinkedIn. \"Cutting the federal workforce responsible for these functions may be seen as reckless at best and adversarily opportunistic at worst.\"\n\nWhile some of the Energy Department employees who were fired dealt with energy efficiency and the effects of climate change, issues not seen as priorities by the Trump administration, many others dealt with nuclear issues, even if they didn't directly work on weapons programs. This included managing massive radioactive waste sites and ensuring the material there doesn't further contaminate nearby communities.\n\nThat incudes the Savannah River National Laboratory in Jackson, South Carolina; the Hanford Nuclear Site in Washington state, where workers secure 177 high-level waste tanks from the site's previous work producing plutonium for the atomic bomb; and the Oak Ridge Reservation in Tennessee, a Superfund contamination site where much of the early work on the Manhattan Project was done, among others.\n\nU.S. Rep. Marcy Kaptur of Ohio and U.S. Sen. Patty Murray of Washington, both Democrats, called the firings last week \"utterly callous and dangerous.\"\n\nRELATED: Elon Musk calls for US government to 'delete entire agencies'\n\nThe NNSA staff who had been reinstated could not all be reached after they were fired, and some were reconsidering whether to return to work, given the uncertainty created by DOGE.\n\nMany federal employees who had worked on the nation's nuclear programs had spent their entire careers there, and there was a wave of retirements in recent years that cost the agency years of institutional knowledge.\n\nBut it's now in the midst of a major $750 billion nuclear weapons modernization effort - including new land-based intercontinental ballistic missiles, new stealth bombers and new submarine-launched warheads. In response, the labs have aggressively hired over the past few years: In 2023, 60% of the workforce had been there five years or less.\n\nEdwin Lyman, director of nuclear power safety at the Union of Concerned Scientists, said the firings could disrupt the day-to-day workings of the agency and create a sense of instability over the nuclear program both at home and abroad.\n\n\"I think the signal to U.S. adversaries is pretty clear: throw a monkey wrench in the whole national security apparatus and cause disarray,\" he said. \"That can only benefit the adversaries of this country.\"",

Just be yourself.\n\n\"I just kind of decided to stay true to myself, and that's what people really latched on to,\" he says. \"It was a good confidence boost.\"\n\nMostly, he just liked the idea of being on a billboard and thought it would be funny.

        "fullContent": "Best gaming laptops from MSI, Acer and more\n\nAs a participant in multiple affiliate marketing programs, Localish will earn a commission for certain purchases. See full disclaimer below*\n\nIf you're a casual gamer you might not think you need a gaming laptop, but having one can be great for competitive gamers, streamers or anyone who spends time playing cooperatively with their friends daily. Below, you'll find the best gaming laptops at every price point, plus the features you might want to keep in mind before shopping for one.\n\nGaming laptops buying guide:\n\nScreen size and resolution: You might want a larger screen size on your gaming laptop if you're dealing with games with a lot of moving parts. That said, a larger screen size usually commands a higher price point. Below, we've highlighted gaming laptops with screen sizes of 14 and 16-inch. The resolution states how clear your picture will be. A higher resolution is preferred for competitive gamers. The below laptops have at least a Full HD resolution, but we've also included options for 4K (four times the clarity of a physical HD laptop).\n\nOperating System: An OS usually handles all the application programs on your computer, including how the RAM is managed. Windows OS 11 is the best for gaming, but you can also use Atlast OS which optimizes system performance and lowers latency.\n\nRAM: You'll want at least 16 GB of RAM on your gaming laptop. This is required to run any AAA titles (games produced by major publishers) at their native resolutions and without lags. If you're looking to stream while gaming, go higher with a 32 GB laptop.\n\nStorage: Ideally you'll want a laptop with at least 512 GB of storage. This sounds like a lot, but games are usually at least 100 GB, so with a 512 GB laptop you'll be able to store 4-5 games at a time. You can also purchase additional SSDs if you need a higher amount of storage in the short term.\n\nBest gaming laptops\n\nAmazon MSI Cyborg 14 $1099 Shop now\n\nI tested this laptop for about a month and was impressed by both its performance and design. It's surprisingly lightweight, stays cool to the touch while gaming, and has a tactile, responsive keyboard for quick feedback. There is also up to 1 TB of storage available, and the 14-inch display FHD+ display is just big and bright enough to keep track of all your in-game characters. Its fan and in-built cooling system is not that noisy either and the backlit keyboard is great for gaming after hours. I honestly love this piece of gaming equipment and think it's a great laptop for beginner and seasoned gamers alike.\n\nBest Buy ASUS - ROG Zephyrus G14 $1599 Shop now\n\nThis is a great laptop for beginners and expert gamers alike. It comes with 16 GB of RAM, a Full HD resolution, and a Windows 11 operating system for quick gameplay with no lag time. It also boasts rapid response times (the lower the response time, the quicker your laptop is) and has 1TB of in-built storage which means it's able to store a decent amount of games. It offers intelligent cooling which should also keep this pick from quickly heating up, and six speakers equipped with Domby Atmos, allowing you to use it without a pair of good-quality gaming headphones. You'll also get three months of Xbox game pass included which will give you access to 100s of free games - including new titles.\n\nAmazon Razer Blade 14 (2024) $2699.99 Shop now\n\nRazer just announced the new and thinner Razer Blade 16 at CES, but you'll have to wait for a little before you can shop that pick. In fact, most Razer laptops are currently out of stock at major retailers. That said, you can currently purchase the Razer Blade 14 - last year's release. It has 32 GB of RAM making it a strong pick, and it also carries a whole 1TB of storage. Plus, it has a Windows 11 operating system similar to some of the other picks on this list. Battery life lasts eight hours (but keep in mind that gaming laptops are notorious for fast-depleting batteries due to how heavy-duty most AAA titles are). It is also one of the lightest Razer laptops around, making it a great buy for those always on the go.\n\nAmazon HP Omen 16 $1199 Shop now\n\nHP's 2023 Omen is still a top contender. For starters, it has a wide, 16.1-inch Full HD display with an anti-glare screen so you can game wherever you are. This option also has 1 TB of storage (but the brand offers options up to 4 TB if you need it) and like the other picks on our list, a fully customizable RGB backlit keyboard and built-in speakers. It weighs around five pounds and also comes with multiple USB port options. Plus, since it has 32GB of RAM it can handle most games with ease - you can also customize it to up to 64 GB of RAM.\n\n* By clicking on the featured links, visitors will leave this site and be directed to third-party e-commerce sites that operate under different terms and privacy policies.

        "source": "https://6abc.com/",
        "fullContent": "Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency has requested access to an IRS data system that retains the personal tax information on millions of Americans, sources said.\n\nElon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency has requested access to an IRS data system that retains the personal tax information on millions of Americans, sources said.\n\nElon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency has requested access to an IRS data system that retains the personal tax information on millions of Americans, sources said.\n\nElon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency has requested access to an IRS data system that retains the personal tax information on millions of Americans, sources said.\n\nWASHINGTON -- Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency has requested access to a sensitive IRS data system that retains the personal tax information on millions of Americans, two sources familiar with the matter told ABC News.\n\nThe system, known as the Integrated Data Retrieval System, or IDRS, is used by IRS employees to review tax information, issue notices to taxpayers and update taxpayer records.\n\nAccess to the files, which is tightly controlled within the agency, had not been granted as of this weekend, several sources told ABC News.\n\nStill, the request itself is still being seen with alarm both within the government and among privacy experts who say access to Americans' private taxpayer data by Musk could be extraordinarily dangerous.\n\nMusk, estimated to be the richest man in the world, has criticized federal judges for curbing his power and called for their impeachment. Musk also has alleged without evidence or examples of wrongdoing that federal workers were defrauding taxpayers.\n\nThe IRS will lay off thousands of probationary workers in the middle of tax season, according to two sources familiar with the agency's plans, and cuts could happen as soon as next week.\n\n\"We do find it rather odd that there are quite a few people in the bureaucracy who have ostensibly a salary of a few hundred thousand dollars, but somehow managed to accrue tens of millions of dollars in net worth while they are in that position ... We're just curious as to where it came from,\" Musk told reporters on Feb. 12 while in the Oval Office with President Donald Trump.\n\nEarlier this month, DOGE employees demanded access to the Treasury Department's vast federal payment system responsible for managing trillions of dollars in government expenditures. That access triggered a lawsuit by 19 states and has been temporarily blocked by a federal judge.\n\nSources say one DOGE staffer arrived at the IRS last Thursday seeking meetings with various offices about how the IRS collects and manages data and what each business unit within the IRS does. It is not clear whether that staffer made the request to access IDRS or if it came through via the White House.\n\nThe White House did not respond to ABC News' request for comment.\n\nAccording to the Washington Post, which first reported the development, the IRS is considering a memorandum of understanding that would give DOGE officials access to several systems, including IDRS.\n\nElizabeth Laird, a former state privacy officer now with the Center for Democracy and Technology, said there are serious legal questions around DOGE accessing large data sets of information and how they are handling it. Questions include: Who exactly is accessing the government data at these agencies? Are they government employees or third-party contractors? What information are they accessing exactly and how are they using it? If they are transferring data to AI software, what are the security risks involved?\n\n\"People who share their most sensitive information with the federal government do so under the understanding that not only will it be used legally, but also handled securely and in ways that minimize risks like identity theft and personal invasion, which this reporting brings into serious question,\" Laird said.\n\nMusk and the White House have not said what federal data the DOGE team has been able to get to, or what's been done with the data that's been acquired.\n\nWhen pressed by reporters on what checks are in place to ensure Musk -- whose companies have billions of dollars in current federal contracts -- is accessing data to his advantage, the billionaire insisted that DOGE posts all of its activity on its website \"so all of our actions are maximally transparent.\" As of Sunday, the DOGE site included a list of mostly canceled government contracts and a message on its \"savings\" tab: \"Receipts coming over the weekend!\"\n\nFILE - Tesla and SpaceX Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk speaks at the SATELLITE Conference and Exhibition in Washington, Monday, March 9, 2020. AP Photo/Susan Walsh, File\n\nAccording to one person familiar with DOGE's efforts, Musk's request to access the IRS system would not allow them to change any data within it. But if granted, the access would allow unfettered access to access any person's tax filings.\n\nAccording to an IRS rulebook for the system posted online, anyone accessing IDRS is specifically not allowed to review the personal tax information of relatives, friends, neighbors or celebrities.\n\n\"IDRS users shall not access the account of any taxpayer or another IRS employee unless there is a business need and access has been formally authorized as part of the user's official duties,\" the agency states.\n\nThe policy notes: \"Willful unauthorized disclosure, access or inspection of non-computerized taxpayer records, including hard copies of returns - as well as computerized information - is a crime, punishable upon conviction, by fines, prison terms and termination of employment.\"\n\nWhile a district court judge in Manhattan has temporarily blocked DOGE's access to the Treasury Department system for now, a separate ruling by another district court judge has allowed DOGE to access data at the Department of Labor, Department of Health and Human Services, and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.\n\nABC News' Hannah Demissie contributed to this report.",

WATCH NOW: Christie Ileto sat down with Blunt Rochester to talk about her journey.\n\nNew program inspires next generation of black male educators\n\nAt Parkway West High School a new class is focused on turning students into teachers. The program is a partnership between the high school and Philadelphia Academies, Inc., a longtime force in the Philadelphia education system. The goal is to inspire the next generation of Black male educators. The program launched in January with ten participating students with aims to grow each year and eventually lead to a certification that gives the students an opportunity to work in the field after graduation. The program is called One Soul, part of the Philadelphia Academies, Inc.'s Early Childhood Education (ECE) Pre-Apprenticeship Program at Parkway West High School.\n\nPhiladelphia Academies, Inc. | Facebook | Instagram\n\nTwo Penn Center, 1500 John F Kennedy Blvd #312, Philadelphia, PA 19102\n\nParkway West High School | Facebook | Instagram\n\n4725 Fairmount Avenue # 2, Philadelphia, PA 19139\n\nNafees Innovations\n\nNafees Norris created Nafees Innovations to make STEM simple and fun for kids through science workshops.\n\nWebsite| Instagram\n\nBeyond the Bars\n\nThe community-based music program for teens, Beyond the Bars, has been using the power of music to reach and teach at-risk youth for ten years since it started with one instructor teaching music to incarcerated teens.

Those formative years led to the foray into his own balloon decor business, Art On Display. Now as he continues to explore the medium and expand his creative curiosity, early ventures into creating wall art and sculptures from deflated balloons is literally taking off.\n\nBrian Ward - Artist | Instagram\n\nBroadlane Furniture: Decorated veteran uses woodworking to ease PTSD\n\nOn a bucolic 26-acre property in South Jersey, Denzel Annan is transforming pieces of wood into works of art-everything from coasters, cutting boards and serving trays to bigger items like coffee tables, end tables and beds.\n\nHis work is distinct with fracture burning and colorful epoxy.\n\nDenzel grew up in Ghana and came to the United States when he was 17. After graduating high school in South Jersey, he joined the U.S. Army where he spent 20-years as a combat engineer, deactivating roadside bombs.

The air traffic controller was not authorized to talk to the media and spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\nSpero said messages began arriving after 7 p.m. on Friday and continued late into the night. More might be notified over the long weekend or barred from entering FAA buildings on Tuesday, he said.\n\nRELATED: Trump, without citing evidence, attacks FAA DEI initiatives during DC crash briefing\n\nThe employees were fired \"without cause nor based on performance or conduct,\" Spero said, and the emails were \"from an 'exec order' Microsoft email address\" - not a government email address.\n\nThe firings hit the FAA when it faces a shortfall in controllers. Federal officials have been raising concerns about an overtaxed and understaffed air traffic control system for years, especially after a series of close calls between planes at U.S. airports. Among the reasons they have cited for staffing shortages are uncompetitive pay, long shifts, intensive training and mandatory retirements.\n\nIn the Jan. 29 fatal crash between a U.S. Army Black Hawk helicopter and American Airlines passenger jet, which is still under investigation, one controller was handing both commercial airline and helicopter traffic at the busy airport.\n\nJust days before the collision, President Donald Trump had already fired all the members of the Aviation Security Advisory Committee, a panel mandated by Congress after the 1988 PanAm 103 bombing over Lockerbie, Scotland.

(Photo by TIMOTHY A. CLARY / AFP) (Photo by TIMOTHY A. CLARY/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nSign up for our email newsletter to stay up-to-date on the latest local sports news throughout Philadelphia.\n\nThe NBA All-Star break could not have come sooner for the Philadelphia 76ers and their fans. Given how poorly this season has gone, it would be welcomed if the Sixers could just stay on break.\n\nA season from Hell does not even begin to describe the bad vibes that have permeated through this team since training camp. It is now mid-February, with the playoffs starting in two months, and the Sixers are somehow in a worse spot than they were when their record was 3-14 through 17 games.\n\nEvery single main character for the Sixers has played a leading role in this debacle. It starts at the top with Daryl Morey and Nick Nurse — a fish rots from the head down.\n\nTyrese Maxey got off to a rough individual start this season and, for the first time in his career, showed cracks in the armor of his effervescent personality.\n\nPaul George was supposed to be the team’s missing connector, but he has instead brought his lackadaisical “California cool” to South Philadelphia, admittedly the worst place in the country to play and act careless.\n\nAnd, of course, there is the man in the center of it all: Joel Embiid. Whether it be his own ego, organizational malpractice, or (most likely) both, he is the reason this team has no direction today, and he is the reason why it is hard to see the team have a direction in the near future.\n\nDaryl Morey\n\nDaryl Morey has always had a very specific philosophy of team building, dating back to his original trade for James Harden over a decade ago with the Houston Rockets. The greatest collection of talent often does win out in the NBA, but Morey’s hyper-fixation on acquiring superstars has left any roster he has overseen with too many holes to hoist the Larry O’Brien trophy.\n\nThis is not meant to be a referendum on Morey’s efforts. The most success of Joel Embiid’s career came with Morey building the team around him. Morey is not afraid to admit his mistakes on a transactional basis, but at some point, he has to evolve his entire line of thinking instead of throwing the same thing at the wall and hoping it sticks.\n\nPHILADELPHIA, PENNSYLVANIA – DECEMBER 15: President of basketball operations Daryl Morey participates in a press conference before a game between the Philadelphia Flyers and the Washington Capitals at the Wells Fargo Center on December 15, 2023 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. (Photo by Tim Nwachukwu/Getty Images)\n\nMorey has been here long enough to understand that Embiid is not like other superstars in the NBA. He is going to miss more time than anyone else and is a far greater injury risk than most others, as well. What Daryl Morey has done is continue to build the team as if he is on the floor every night, still dominating the league, instead of building out a roster that can stay afloat and even succeed when he is not there. For a team that has Tyrese Maxey and Paul George signed to $200-plus million contracts, that is unacceptable.\n\nNick Nurse\n\nJoel Embiid was at the peak of his basketball powers playing under Nick Nurse until he tore his meniscus last season. Nick Nurse is also, clearly, not the right coach moving forward for the Sixers. Both things can be true.\n\nNick Nurse won a championship as head coach of the Toronto Raptors behind an all-time great playoff run by Kawhi Leonard and going through a Golden State Warriors team that saw both Kevin Durant tear his Achilles tendon and Klay Thompson tear his ACL in the Finals. Kawhi Leonard then left for the Clippers, and the Raptors never found a semblance of that success again.\n\nThat is not all on Nurse, of course. Kawhi had an argument at the time for being the single most effective player in the sport on a game-to-game basis when he played. Kyle Lowry was not getting any younger either (and still is not, as Sixers fans know). The roster was incredibly clunky. However, Nick Nurse showed his hand as a coach during the Raptors’ descent, and it was overlooked for the most part when he came to Philadelphia for those aforementioned reasons.\n\nJan 4, 2025; Brooklyn, New York, USA; Philadelphia 76ers head coach Nick Nurse looks back during the first half against the Brooklyn Nets at Barclays Center. Mandatory Credit: Vincent Carchietta-Imagn Images\n\nNick Nurse needs a dominant offensive force on his roster to make up for his lack of innovation on that end of the floor. When that force leaves like Leonard or rarely suits up like Embiid, he has not shown the ability to adjust- and he has had years to figure something out. Defense is Nurse’s specialty, and even that has not been consistently good enough. His players in Toronto were tuning him out as his tenure was coming to an end, and it sure seems like that is the case here, too.\n\nTyrese Maxey\n\nIt has been a tough year for Tyrese Maxey, even as he has started to pick up his level of play these past couple of months. He was very poor offensively by his standards to start the season. He put on a lot of muscle over the summer to play more physically, and there’s been a lot of speculation that it affected his shooting stroke for a while before his body adjusted. The weight of expectations that come from signing a massive contract extension did not help either.\n\nFeb 11, 2025; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA; Philadelphia 76ers guard Tyrese Maxey (0) controls the ball against the Toronto Raptors in the first quarter at Wells Fargo Center. Mandatory Credit: Kyle Ross-Imagn Images\n\nWith Joel Embiid and Paul George both out when the season started, Maxey was not capable of carrying the team to victories on his own. As the losses piled up, so did his visible, outward frustration. That was something he had never really shown before, and it continued for the first three months of the season. To his credit, he has pulled himself out of the funk he was in, but now we know somewhere in that blinding smile is a man who is not happy with the state of affairs right now.\n\nPaul George\n\nThe larger the sample we see from Paul George, the more obvious his intentions in a Sixers uniform become. It does not matter that he has not gotten nearly as much playing time with Joel Embiid and Tyrese Maxey as he and everyone would like. It does not matter that he has been banged up a few times—including currently with a tendon issue in his finger—because everyone on the team has. What matters are his actions on the court.\n\nFeb 11, 2025; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA; Philadelphia 76ers forward Paul George (8) drives with the ball against the Toronto Raptors in the first quarter at Wells Fargo Center. Mandatory Credit: Kyle Ross-Imagn Images\n\nPaul George made it clear that he wanted to stay and end his career in his home state of California. Still, when he signed with a team as far away from California as possible for as much money as possible, he said all the right things. He had a preexisting friendship with Embiid and quickly looked to develop one with Maxey. It felt like the Sixers finally had the core in place that they wanted.\n\nAs the season has gone on, however, George has become less and less engaged. He has been bad offensively all year- sometimes that happens. But as the Sixers have continued to plummet, so have his efforts everywhere else on the court. It is reasonable to think he did not expect the vibes to be this awful, and he is also 34 years old, but it is becoming increasingly evident that he has no heart in this. Kelly Oubre and Guerschon Yabusele might not make nearly as much money, but they give a damn. Tyrese Maxey also makes significantly less money than George, and he gives a damn too.\n\nJoel Embiid\n\nWhere to even start…\n\nJoel Embiid tore his meniscus in Jan. 2024. He rushed back for the playoffs, but the Sixers were dispatched in the first round while he played physically compromised. He then played in the Olympics and won a Gold Medal. By the time training camp and the start of the NBA season roll around, he is nowhere to be found.\n\nFeb 11, 2025; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA; Philadelphia 76ers center Joel Embiid (21) reacts against the Toronto Raptors in the second quarter at Wells Fargo Center. Mandatory Credit: Kyle Ross-Imagn Images\n\nTo make matters worse, any time someone was asked about his health or his absence, nobody gave a real answer. That trend has continued literally to this day. Joel Embiid has played a total of 17 games this season. The Sixers are 8-9 in those games. Last year, in Embiid’s 39 games played, the Sixers were 31-8. Tyrese Maxey called him out in a closed-door meeting that someone decided needed to be open-door.\n\nThen Lisa Salters of ESPN reported that Embiid himself stated that he would “likely require” another surgery and an extended recovery time after the season.\n\nIf that is the case, why is Embiid playing at all? It is completely nonsensical that a player who needs knee surgery announces the need while the team does not mention the idea once and for the player to be currently suited up in an NBA basketball game the moment the public is told of this.\n\nThis is truly infuriating stuff that does not happen to any normal franchise in the NBA. These persisting issues are as much, if not more, on Joel than on the Sixers organization. Shut it all down. Destination nowhere.",

        "fullContent": "Oct 8, 2024; New York City, New York, USA; Philadelphia Phillies first baseman Bryce Harper (3) hits an RBI single in the eighth inning against the New York Mets during game three of the NLDS for the 2024 MLB Playoffs at Citi Field. Mandatory Credit: Brad Penner-Imagn Images\n\nSign up for our email newsletter to stay up-to-date on the latest local sports news throughout Philadelphia.\n\nFour months ago, the Phillies limped to an unsatisfactory conclusion to the 2024 season. After winning 95 games and earning a bye in the National League playoffs, they were clipped in the NLDS against a red-hot New York Mets team. Losing to a rival in the postseason is tough enough—but to watch them sign the biggest free agent in recent memory after the season only adds to the pressure Philadelphia’s franchise is feeling.\n\nAfter a surprising run to the World Series in 2022, followed by big spending and big expectations, they have fallen one round earlier each season since losing to the Astros 3 years ago. As the top of the National League continues to grow stronger through big spending, Philadelphia already did their spending over the last few offseasons. With a core getting closer to their mid-30s and a few key players nearing free agency, the club’s championship window is getting smaller.\n\nPhiladelphia’s infield was seemingly set before the offseason even began. While there were rumblings of potential trades involving third baseman Alec Bohm, none of those rumors turned into truth, and the Phillies will rely on their homegrown third baseman to find some consistency in his last year of team control.\n\nPSN is breaking down each position group for you to get ready for Spring Training, and today we bring you our thoughts on Philadelphia’s infield. Starters, depth options, and what they need to do to reach the promised land.\n\nPhillies Starters\n\nBarring a significant injury or a last-minute, unexpected trade, Philly’s starting infield is locked up. Bryce Harper will enter his second season as a first baseman, Bryson Stott will once again man the keystone, Trea Turner will take his place back at shortstop, and Bohm will be the everyday third baseman.\n\nHarper is the de facto captain of the offense. The two-time MVP is the best hitter in Philadelphia’s lineup and one of the best of his generation. After a few injury-marred seasons, Harper played in 145 contests during the regular season—the most since his first season donning the red pinstripes. For the first time in a long time, Bryce will have nothing major to deal with coming into a season.\n\nHe’s healthy, he isn’t learning a new position like last year, and there’s no questioning those two things in the media—it is obvious he is ready for the season and has certainly found his place on defense. After a midsummer downswing, Harper finished 2024 strong, and that carried into the playoffs. Harper will be ready to show that he’s still one of the best hitters in all of baseball.\n\nBryson Stott is entrenched as the Phillies second baseman. In his age-26 season, Stott was a finalist for the National League Gold Glove after amassing 7 Defensive Runs Saved—good for fourth among NL second basemen. After taking a big step forward offensively in 2023, Stott got off to a slow start in 2024 and never really found the rhythm he had just the year prior. His average and slugging were both down in all scenarios, but most concerning was his success against left-handed pitching all but vanished. The fourth-year player was stuck between two approaches last season, so he will focus on finding consistency during Spring Training.\n\nAug 15, 2024; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA; Philadelphia Phillies shortstop Trea Turner (7) hits a single during the first inning against the Washington Nationals at Citizens Bank Park. Mandatory Credit: Bill Streicher-USA TODAY Sports\n\nTrea Turner was signed as a superstar shortstop, and he can find himself there once again, despite his struggles defensively. Not known as a Gold Glove-caliber fielder, the Phillies likely still expected more than what the 31-year-old has given them in the field. At the end of last season, Tim Kelly from On Pattison broke down some of the $300 million man’s struggles in the field. Since joining the Phillies, Turner has -26 defensive runs saved (DRS) and -8 outs above average at shortstop. Over that two-year period, Turner has rough defensive marks no matter how you look at it:\n\nHis -26 DRS is tied for the worst mark among defenders at any position (per FanGraphs)\n\nHe’s had -8 outs above average (OAA), which is 5th worst among SS\n\nHis .960 fielding percentage ranks him the 2nd worst SS\n\n3rd in throwing errors (18)\n\n2nd in fielding errors (22)\n\n2nd in total errors (40)\n\nThe coaching staff will work with Turner on improving his defense to the levels he reached prior to joining Philadelphia. While his position isn’t changing in the field, he may find himself moving in the batting order. Manager Rob Thomson recently confirmed during an appearance on The Phillies Show podcast that changes are being discussed. When asked about switching the lineup around and possibly finding a new lead-off hitter, Thomson came up with just one name:\n\n“I think you’re probably talking about Trea [Turner],” said Thomson.\n\nMy prediction is that Turner finds himself moving to the top of the order, while Kyle Schwarber moves down to bat cleanup. In order to keep the right-left-right-left pattern, this would put Harper in the No. 2 slot in the lineup. That would likely lead to Bohm batting 3rd.\n\nSpeaking of Bohm, the aforementioned trade rumors turned out to be just that—rumors. Rob Thomson has publicly said any time he’s been asked that he spoke with his third baseman and made clear that they were not actively shopping him, but that the Phillies owed it to themselves to hear out anyone who called about him.\n\nAlec Bohm talks to @TimKellySports about his positive mindset in Spring Training. pic.twitter.com/A18Y93MZ8z — On Pattison (@OnPattison) February 13, 2025\n\nBohm was an All-Star for the first time last season. The first half of his year was great, but he struggled in the second half while dealing with a hand injury. Despite that, he led the Phillies in doubles with 44—good for 5th in the majors—and had the 2nd most RBIs on the team. Tim Kelly had the opportunity to speak to Bohm now that players have begun reporting for Spring Training. He spoke about how the injury may have lingered more than he initially thought.\n\n“When I started hitting again in the offseason, I realized that it hurt worse than I thought it had hurt,” Bohm admitted. “But I was out there playing, so I feel like if I’m out there playing, it’s not like I can’t do anything. But at the same time, I’m sure a stronger left hand would have helped somewhere, maybe.\n\nEntering his last year under Phillies team control, he will need to have a season similar to his 2024 first half for the entire season if he wants a major payday in his first crack at free agency.\n\nSep 27, 2024; Washington, District of Columbia, USA; Philadelphia Phillies shortstop Edmundo Sosa (33) turns a double play during the seventh inning against the Washington Nationals at Nationals Park. Mandatory Credit: James A. Pittman-Imagn Images\n\nPhillies Reserves\n\nThere are 2 spots that an infielder could occupy on Philly’s bench. One will most definitely be occupied by Edmundo Sosa. The utility infielder came up big for the Phillies in 2024. In early May, he filled in admirably for Turner while he dealt with an injury. Sosa had a .972 OPS in May, one of the best numbers in all of baseball that month. He will be the primary option off the bench in the infield and when needing a pinch hitter.\n\nFrom there, you have to still account for the backup catcher and Johan Rojas being an extra outfielder off the bench. That leaves one additional bench spot. Weston Wilson, Kody Clemens, Buddy Kennedy, and newly signed Christian Arroyo will compete for that final spot. The front office has expressed wanting someone who can play both infield and outfield in that position, if possible. Wilson shows the most potential with slugging ability and speed. He does, however, have minor league options remaining, which is a disadvantage for him in the race for the final bench spot. Clemens has shown over the last few seasons that he is a major-league talent.\n\nHe has options left; he would almost certainly be claimed off waivers if the Phillies decided he was not the right guy to break camp with. Kennedy is a longer shot and is a nice depth piece, but he also has no options. He would likely pass through waivers, giving the Phillies a chance to keep him around. Arroyo is a former first-round draft pick, and while he was primarily an infielder, he does have some experience in the outfield corners at the major league level. He signed a minor league deal, so unless he significantly stands out, he will likely remain as a depth option and start the year in Triple-A Lehigh Valley.\n\nMy prediction is that Kody Clemens makes the roster out of spring. He has positional flexibility and allows extra depth to be kept in the organization without risk. Regardless of who the last man is, one thing is for sure—the infield is the strength of the offense. If Bohm can find consistency, Stott can hit closer to how he did in 2023, and the depth continues to do what they’ve done the last three seasons—they will be one of, if not the best, infields in baseball.\n\nMandatory Credit: Brad Penner-Imagn Images",

        "fullContent": "Sign up for our email newsletter to stay up-to-date on the latest local sports news throughout Philadelphia.\n\nSince the Phillies first started as a professional baseball team in 1883, we have seen 25 different men hold the office of President of the United States of America. Today, in honor of President’s Day, we look and see which presidents the Phillies have performed the best under.\n\nTo keep things fair and unbiased, this list will be based on each president’s respective win percentage. Postseason success will not play a factor in determining a president’s rank in this list, so it is best to recognize the two presidents under whom the Phillies have won a World Series now: Presidents Jimmy Carter (1980) and George W. Bush (2008). If you expand that list to include World Series appearances, then the list would also include Presidents Woodrow Wilson (1915), Harry S. Truman (1950), Ronald Reagan (1983), Bill Clinton (1993), Barack Obama (2009), and Joe Biden (2022).\n\nNow with that State of the Union dealt with, let’s get to the list.\n\nNo. 5 Benjamin Harrison (1889-1892)\n\nPresident Benjamin Harrison was known as the “centennial president,” being the president 100 years after President George Washington first took office. In addition to modernizing the U.S. Navy fleet, Harrison was known for economic legislation like the McKinley Tariff and the Sherman Antitrust Act, as well as aiding in the creation of national forest reserves.\n\nUnder Harrison, the Phillies boasted a 296-252-8 record for a win percentage of .540 overall. In the days of Billy Hamilton and Ed Delahanty, these Phillies teams were a part of one of the first good eras of Philadelphia baseball. In 1892, before the days of a standardized 162-game season, the Phillies reached 80 wins for the first time as a franchise with an 87-66-2 record.\n\nNo. 4 Joe Biden (2021-2024)\n\nNext on the list is the only 21st-century president to make the top five. Anyone who is reading this article does not need a summary of Biden’s time in office, as he is only one month out of office at the time of publishing. Biden is, however, a Delaware native and a lifetime Phillies fan.\n\nWhile Biden was in office, the Phillies returned to form as one of the top powers in the National League. The Phillies reached the postseason three out of Biden’s four years in office. Led by the likes of Bryce Harper, Kyle Schwarber, Zack Wheeler, and Aaron Nola, the Phillies had a record of 354-294 (.546) under Biden.\n\nNo. 3 Grover Cleveland (1885-1888, 1893-1896)\n\nBack in the 19th century, President Grover Cleveland lost his second-term election to the No. 5 spot on this list, President Harrison, in 1888 and then proceeded to defeat Harrison when he sought re-election in 1892. During his time in office, Cleveland navigated hard times, including labor strikes, while establishing a strong executive branch with a record-breaking use of presidential vetoes.\n\nThe same general era in Phillies’ baseball as under Harrison, the Phillies thrived under Cleveland, with their only bad season coming at the end of his second term in 1896. Overall, the Phillies went 554-441-23 (.556) over Cleveland’s eight years in office. His first year in office also brought the Phillies (then the Quakers) their first no-hitter in franchise history when Charlie Ferguson defeated the Providence Grays 1-0.\n\nNo. 2 Gerald R. Ford (1974-1976)\n\nPresident Gerald Ford is an interesting one, as he is the only president to reach office without ever being elected president or vice president. Appointed as vice president under President Richard M. Nixon in December 1973 after Vice President Spiro Agnew resigned, Ford assumed the role of president in August 1974 after the resignation of Nixon. During his presidency, the Vietnam War ended, the Cold War began to creep towards its conclusion with the Helsinki Accords, and Ford controversially pardoned Nixon following the Watergate scandal. After finishing out Nixon’s second term, Ford sought election in 1976 but lost to the No. 1 president on this list.\n\nThe Phillies teams of the late 70s and early 80s made their mark and featured some of the best ballplayers in Phillies history. Steve Carlton, Bob Boone, Larry Bowa, and Tug McGraw are just some of the names that you cannot ignore when looking at these teams. And, of course, the fans of the era will never forget Harry Kalas announcing whenever Michael Jack Schmidt came to bat. We all know where this story ends, but while Ford was in office, this Phillies team went 209-164 (.560) over those two-plus seasons.\n\nAugust 7 2010: Philadelphia Phillies Hall of Famers (from left) Jim Bunning, Steve Carlton, and Mike Schmidt stand for the national anthem during alumni weekend during the New York Mets vs Philadelphia Phillies game at Citizens Bank Park in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.\n\nHonorable Mentions: The Bottom Five Presidents\n\nThere is no sense in doing a historical look at the Phils through the lens of American presidents without looking at the elephant in the room. The Phillies, as the losingest team in professional sports history, have lost 11,326 games over their 122-year lifespan. As such, the five presidents with the worst win percentages in Phillies history are as follows: Presidents Richard M. Nixon (in office 1969-1974, .427 win percentage), Calvin Coolidge (1923-1928, .357), Franklin D. Roosevelt (1933-1944, .354), Warren G. Harding (1921-1923, .350), and Chester A. Arthur (1883-1884, .269).\n\nNo. 1 Jimmy Carter (1977-1980)\n\nRecently deceased President Jimmy Carter tops the list. Having narrowly defeated the incumbent President Ford in the 1976 election, Carter’s time in office included the negotiations of the Camp David Accords and the Panama Canal Treaties along with creating the Departments of Energy and Education. Abroad he also had to deal with crises such as the Soviets invading Afghanistan and the Iranian revolution.\n\nThe likes of Pete Rose, Manny Trillo, and Bake McBride joined an already strong lineup as the Fightin’ Phils tried to win their first World Series. Carter’s first two years in office featured the Phillies’ second and third consecutive appearances in the National League Championship Series. Then, after a down year in 1979, the Phillies brought home the pennant in 1980, defeating the Kansas City Royals in six games. Tug McGraw earned the save in Game Six, and Mike Schmidt was named World Series MVP.\n\nWhat Does This Mean for the Phillies Now?\n\nFrom his first term, the Phils have been 255-291 (.467) under President Donald J. Trump, putting Trump squarely in the middle of the pack in the context of this list. The current Phillies team still ranks among the top in the league, but the question remains: how long will the Phillies be able to sustain their success with the core team members aging?\n\nTo date, the Phillies have only won a World Series in an election year, so either the Phillies will need to break that streak, or the Phillies’ next chance to claim their championship parade will not be until 2028.",

        "fullContent": "Sign up for our Daily Email newsletter to stay up-to-date on the latest local news throughout Philadelphia.\n\nAhead of the band’s upcoming performance at the Keswick Theater, Travis frontman Fran Healy sat down with Metro to discuss the band’s most recent album, ‘L.A. Times’, their creative process as innovators, and the experience of live music.\n\nYour latest album, ‘L.A. Times’ — can you break down its inspiration?\n\nIt was me venting about LA and having lived there for eight years. And just like I was like, ‘That’s enough, [I] can’t take any more.’ The whole album was written while I lived in LA, and song-wise, I would say there’s a bit of everything. There’s a lot of reflection and a lot of looking back. But, honestly, [when] writing songs, your entire experience kind of comes out in a song. If you’re writing in a proper way, which is just like digging until you find something, you bring it to the surface, and it starts to become something.\n\nThe first song is me looking back to Glasgow, waiting on a bus, and then this metaphor of a bus being like life, your kind of mortality. It’s a bit deep, but I’m thinking about it. I’m 51, I’m a father. So I’m thinking about stuff like that. Song two is called ‘Raze The Bar,’ which is about this brilliant bar in New York. It’s got nothing to do with LA, but I think living in LA has made me really long for everything outside of LA. So I’m thinking about New York and the third song, it’s a breakup song, looking at my relationship with my ex, looking at my relationship with my son.\n\nAnd then the fourth song is ‘Gaslight,’ which is just a song about being gaslit for quite a while and getting emancipation, that sort of thing, fighting back against those a–holes. I think there’s been a lot of the tectonic movement in my life, emotional plates moving big, big, big things happening, people dying, people leaving, weeding the garden, so to speak, and then coming out the other side of it and this record sort of chronicles all of that sort of movement.\n\nYou’ve said that for you, the process is not to write songs for charts but to write based on life. Can you delve into that a bit?\n\nEvery song [I’ve ever written] is about something. There’s about 5% of our business that, I would say, innovates. And I think a lot of music, that 95% of music in the charts, is that other type of music. When Travis got massive, like no one even knew we existed, and then suddenly, the next year, we were so different than everything else that everything else had to change to fit in with us. So you find all these bands suddenly sounding like you. We were part of the 5% that just does its thing and, just by chance, became popular, and then the whole business then goes, Oh, we gotta sound like this because this is popular.\n\nSo they all follow; it’s like the flock follows whatever it is. And so I’ve never stopped writing like that. So when we’re suddenly very popular, then suddenly The Strokes come along, I’m not going to suddenly sound like The Strokes just to be popular. That just so goes against the grain of what I’m about. We’re not that kind of band. But again, bands that I love are bands like us that are the 5% bands that just cut their own; they cut their own [teeth]. And I think it’s maybe a little bit more interesting than someone who or a writer who is constantly just trying to stay in fashion…\n\nAuthenticity is one big thing for us. Just be who you are, no matter what that is. Two, art because we all went to art school. We’re an art school band. And three mischief. I’m not so cheeky in real life. I can be, but I’m much more so on the stage… And so we decided that everything we put out has to have those three things in it. And there’s a fourth thing, which is storytelling. It’s a big part of what we do. And the live shows really encapsulated all of those elements together.\n\nThis seems to parallel a lyric by My Morning Jacket from the song ‘Wordless Chorus,’ which says “We are the innovators, they are the imitators. ” Does it seem to be that same type of idea?\n\nThat’s the perfect comparison, yeah, Jim [James] is amazing.\n\nWhat can fans coming to see Travis expect, and why should they be excited?\n\nLet’s talk about My Morning Jacket for a second and not talk about Travis as an example. You listen to ‘Z’ (the album that features ‘Wordless Chorus’), if you listen to it, and that’s the band in a studio playing as much live, hopefully as possible, and then you turn it up on your stereo, and to get the heavy guitars louder, to get the experience that’s like 1% of of the band you’re getting.\n\nIn order to completely get that band, you have to go and see them live. You have to go and stand at the feet of Jim James and hear his roar, watch the guitar, just see the way the guitarist runs across the stage. And that’s where music really resides. I mean, it really is. Seeing a band live is, that’s it. You get the whole DNA of everything and albums, not to knock albums, because albums are art pieces in themselves, but if you really want to get into a band or understand the band.\n\n[Travis is] very artistic. We’re very silly up front, not silly, but entertaining on stage and we’re serious as well. And have quite a lot to say. But it’s cool, it’s just real. And it’s, there’s no backing tracks or anything, and it’s like four guys just f–king hitting their s–t out their instruments and making something out of it.\n\nCatch ‘Travis’ at the Keswick Theater on Tuesday, Feb. 18, for more information, visit keswicktheatre.com",

        "title": "3 takeaways from NYCFC’s final Coachella Valley invitaitona",
        "source": "https://metrophiladelphia.com/",
        "fullContent": "NYCFC has put the finishing touches on its preseason preparations, closing out the Coachella Valley Invitational on a hopeful note.\n\nThe men in blue had a productive time in California, doubling down on manager Pascal Jansen’s ‘bulletproof’ mentality and fine-tuning their tactical systems.\n\nAhead of the team’s highly-anticipated season opener against Inter Miami, the Pigeons have solidified their formational flexibility, learned how to navigate out of uncomfortable situations, and shown promise in the attacking build-up phase.\n\nHere are three takeaways from NYCFC’s last two matches at Coachella.\n\nNYCFC embraces organized chaos with fluid attack\n\nThroughout the tournament, NYCFC played variations of the 4-3-3 or 4-2–3-1 formations. These two systems allow the squad to have attacking fluidity while maintaining a defensive spine of two midfielders.\n\nDuring the team’s last two games against St. Louis City and Minnesota United, the men in blue looked comfortable with the positional flexibility, finding moments in transition where the forward, wingers, and attacking midfielder all interchanged positions.\n\nAccording to Jansen, this freedom in the attacking third is intentional, purposely making it difficult for the opposition defense to man-mark his players.\n\n“We want to be unpredictable and surprising,” Jansen told reporters earlier in preseason. “We like direct attacks and getting in behind opponents. We want to be predictable to ourselves, but unpredictable to our opponents.”\n\nOrganized chaos is an appropriate name to call NYCFC’s new style. It remains to be seen if the team can implement this tactic quickly, but at Coachella, Jansen’s men took the first steps in making his vision a reality.\n\nWho replaces Santiago Rodriguez?\n\nAccording to Tom Bogert of GiveMeSport, star forward Santiago Rodriguez is set to leave the club to join Brazilian side Botafogo.\n\nRodriguez, 25, has been a stud for NYCFC since 2021, racking up a combined amount of 62 goals and assists in 144 appearances for the team. When the Uruguayan departs, it will leave a gaping hole in the squad’s attack.\n\nAlthough Rodriguez’s departure does hurt the team, there are various attacking options at Jansen’s disposal. Forwards Agustin Ojeda, Mounsef Bakrar, and Alonso Martinez now have the opportunity to step up in Rodriguez’s absence.\n\nSimilar to how the club adjusted after midfielder James Sands’s departure to St. Pauli, Jansen is banking on the budding chemistry between the existing roster players to compensate for the loss of Rodriguez’s talent.\n\nSpeaking to the media before their last game against Minnesota, Jansen specifically singled out Bakrar and Martinez to lead the offensive line in 2025.\n\n“We’re looking for a collaboration between [Alonso Martinez] and [Mounsef Bakar],” the former AZ Alkmaar boss said.\n\n“You use the word chemistry, which is very important because you have to feel each other out as attackers. Both of them are good as a [striker], but both of them are able to score a lot of goals.”\n\nWhile Rodriguez’s move away creates a challenge, Jansen’s system thrives on a group effort rather than individual brilliance. If Bakrar and Martinez can build on their strengths, NYCFC’s attack could be a force to be reckoned with in 2025.\n\nGearing up for a tough season opener\n\nAs NYCFC’s pre-season comes to an end, the real test begins.\n\nOn Feb. 22, the Pigeons will take on the reigning Supporters Shield holders, Inter Miami.\n\nMiami, led by the likes of Lionel Messi, Jordi Alba, Sergio Busquets, and Luis Suarez, will be a tough test for a City side that wants to improve upon its sixth-place finish in the Eastern Conference last season.\n\nWhen asked about the season opener, Jansen put all his faith in the team’s pre-season preparations.\n\n“This is the moment we’re preparing for. Once we started on [day one of pre-season], we mentioned the 22nd of February as the moment to be ready as a team,” the 52-year-old told reporters. “So, we’re progressing every day, and we’ll be ready [once the 22nd comes around], in order to be competing in MLS.”\n\nMiami is coming off a long-winded preseason tour that included stops in South and Central America. Additionally, the Herons will start their CONCACAF Champions Cup campaign on Tuesday, leaving them with just four days of rest before playing NYCFC.\n\nWhatever the outcome of the match is, one thing is clear: Thanks to Coachella, the men in blue will be ready.\n\nFor more on NYCFC, visit AMNY.com",

        "source": "https://metrophiladelphia.com/",
        "fullContent": "A missing poster is displayed on a telephone pole along a closed section of Kensington Avenue as police begin clearing a homeless encampment on May 8, 2024 in Philadelphia.\n\nSign up for our Daily Email newsletter to stay up-to-date on the latest local news throughout Philadelphia.\n\nAfter nearly a decade of almost year-over-year increases in overdose deaths, the tide may finally be turning in Philadelphia.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced in May 2024 an estimated 3% decrease in overdose deaths in the U.S. in 2023 compared with 2022. Shortly after, data from the Philadelphia Department of Public Health showed a similar trend: Fatal overdoses across the city decreased 7% in 2023, from 1,207 to 1,122. The city is expected to release its 2024 data in the spring of 2025.\n\nWhile these declines are notable, the city’s 2023 fatal overdose numbers are three times higher than they were in 2013.\n\nStill, if 2024 numbers confirm the downward trend, it allows a little hope into an otherwise bleak epidemic that is killing more Philadelphians than homicides, car accidents and diabetes combined.\n\nSomething may finally be working. But what?\n\nIf over a decade spent treating and researching substance use disorders has taught me anything, it’s that the overdose epidemic is what researchers and policymakers refer to as a wicked problem. Wicked problems are constantly changing, complex, interconnected knots of other problems with no clear solution.\n\nBut let’s look at what we do know about how overdose deaths in Philadelphia spiked in the first place – and why they may finally be decreasing.\n\nWhy overdose deaths spiked\n\nThe first wave of the overdose epidemic began in the late 1990s and is attributed to overprescription of opioid pain medicines. But the largest acceleration in deaths didn’t occur until after the government and health insurers implemented prescribing controls in the early 2010s. These controls led many people who were no longer able to get prescribed opioids to turn to illicit heroin.\n\nIn a phenomenon known as the “iron law of prohibition,” stricter drug law enforcement led drug-trafficking organizations to shift from heroin toward more powerful synthetic opioids that are easier to produce, conceal and distribute. Gram for gram, pure fentanyl is over 50 times stronger than pure heroin.\n\nBut street-obtained fentanyl has proven to be anything but pure.\n\nLocal drug-testing efforts found as much as a fiftyfold difference in potency between bags of fentanyl that appear identical.\n\nThis unpredictable potency is considered to be the chief contributor to the deadliness of street fentanyl. It’s like cracking a beer and not knowing whether drinking it will get you mildly buzzed or send you to the graveyard.\n\nResearch suggests drug busts, though touted as improving public safety, can lead to more inconsistency and unpredictability in the potency of illicit opioids. An analysis of 14 studies conducted in the U.S. demonstrated a marked increase in fatal overdoses following the supply disruptions that result from drug seizures.\n\nThere’s also some evidence that the heightened economic insecurity and despair caused by the COVID-19 pandemic may have intensified the fatal overdose epidemic.\n\nPotential reasons for decline\n\nJust as economic insecurity was associated with rising deaths, the subsequent economic recovery as the U.S. emerged from the pandemic may have contributed to the 2023 drop in overdose fatalities nationwide.\n\nHowever, the unequal distribution of that recovery seems to track with worsening racial disparities in overdose rates in the late 2010s to early 2020s.\n\nAnother possible explanation for the reduction in overdose deaths is the increasing availability of buprenorphine.\n\nBuprenorphine, an FDA-approved medication for opioid use disorder, reduces withdrawal and cravings for fentanyl. What’s more, it decreases overdose risk by more than 50%.\n\nHowever, efforts to increase access to this medication have stagnated. National prescribing rates for buprenorphine were relatively stable from 2019 to 2023, and the CDC estimates that only a quarter of those who need treatment are getting it. Efforts to make buprenorphine available without a prescription have not yet gained traction.\n\nAccess to and education around naloxone, a lifesaving drug used to reverse opioid overdoses, has also increased, and the drug is increasingly being administered by bystanders. Over 1.3 million doses were distributed in Pennsylvania since 2017. National research suggests these distribution efforts, often spearheaded by local harm-reduction organizations, have led to quicker administration of naloxone. This saves lives while also decreasing reliance on emergency medical services.\n\nFinally, the consequences of a seemingly minor characteristic of fentanyl’s pharmacology might also be reducing the overdose death rate in Philadelphia.\n\nFentanyl’s effects last only a third as long as heroin. This shorter duration led drug traffickers to add the animal tranquilizer xylazine – also called “tranq” – and the veterinary anesthetic medetomidine into Philadelphia’s street drug supply. In 2019, two-thirds of heroin or fentanyl sampled in Philadelphia had xylazine in it. By 2021 all of it did.\n\nThese additives lengthen the duration of the effect, mitigate withdrawal symptoms and possibly reduce the amount of fentanyl needed per dose. Some evidence from animal studies shows that xylazine reduces fentanyl intake by suppressing fentanyl withdrawal, thereby lengthening the time before a person uses again.\n\nWhat’s more, the skin wounds and sedative effects that are associated with xylazine may be motivating some people to avoid using street fentanyl.\n\nWhat’s next for Philadelphia\n\nThe opioid settlement, a multibillion-dollar payment from the pharmaceutical industry to resolve legal actions against them, has led to increased funding in Philadelphia for naloxone and medications such as buprenorphine to treat opioid use disorder.\n\nHowever, in the past year the city eliminated funding for needle exchanges and implemented compulsory treatment strategies, which research suggests often do not reduce drug use or criminal recidividism.\n\nMeanwhile, at the federal level, Republican members of Congress have proposed cuts to Medicaid, the health insurance program for low-income Americans.\n\nWhether new data, when it’s released, will show overdose deaths in Philly have continued to decline or are back on the rise is anybody’s guess. But I do know that harm-reduction advocates, medical providers and communities of people who use drugs will continue to fight this epidemic as if their lives depend on it. For many, it does.\n\nBen Cocchiaro is an Assistant Clinical Professor of Family Medicine and Community Health at Drexel University.",

        "fullContent": "President Donald Trump listens to Robert F. Kennedy Jr. in the Oval Office of the White House, on the day Kennedy is sworn in as secretary of Health and Human Service in Washington, D.C., U.S., February 13, 2025.\n\nSign up for our Daily Email newsletter to stay up-to-date on the latest local news throughout Philadelphia.\n\nRobert F. Kennedy Jr. has been confirmed as the secretary of the US Health and Human Services Department. Put simply, this makes him the most influential figure in overseeing the health and wellbeing of more than 330 million Americans.\n\nAs health secretary, Kennedy will be involved in overseeing federal health agencies that regulate medical research, disease prevention, drug approvals and health-care programs.\n\nThis includes oversight of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the Food and Drug Administration and the National Institutes of Health, which are among the most crucial public health agencies in the country.\n\nReports suggest he’ll oversee a budget in the order of $1.8 trillion annually.\n\nIn the era of Trump 2.0, there’s little that shocks me anymore. But Kennedy would have to be the most unqualified person ever to hold this crucial role of protecting the health of the American people.\n\nA history of discounting science\n\nThe absolute minimum requirement for someone occupying such as role should be an understanding of science and respect for scientific evidence and expertise. Yet, Kennedy fails spectacularly in this regard.\n\nHere are just some of the false claims he has made over the years:\n\nKennedy has suggested Lyme disease is likely to be an engineered bioweapon\n\nHe reportedly said 99% of COVID deaths occurred in people with vitamin D deficiencies\n\nHe has questioned the role of HIV in causing AIDS.\n\nNone of these positions has even the smallest amount of scientific support.\n\nIt’s hard to predict what Kennedy will do as health secretary, especially given his confirmation hearings looked to be an exercise in being vague, evasive and denying or downplaying his prior controversial statements to secure support.\n\nBut there are three areas where his views are fairly clear and his appointment could be expected to have a significant impact. These are water fluoridation, infectious diseases research and vaccines.\n\nFluoridation of water\n\nKennedy has been a long-term opponent of water fluoridation, despite its proven benefits in preventing tooth decay. He has consistently questioned its safety and claimed it’s linked to a range of illnesses such as arthritis, bone cancer, IQ loss and neurodevelopmental disorders.\n\nWhile a recent review suggested a link between water fluoridation and lower IQ in children, the levels of fluoride in the water in countries included in this review were generally several times higher than the levels in public water fluoridation programs in countries such as the US and Australia. There were also other limitations that make interpreting these findings challenging.\n\nThe CDC has identified community water fluoridation as as one of the ten great public health achievements of the 20th century. And it continues to benefit dental health today, without any convincing evidence of possible harms.\n\nNonetheless, it seems likely that in keeping with his longstanding views one of Kennedy’s first priorities will be to try to halt water fluoridation in the US.\n\nInfectious diseases\n\nAlongside his confirmation as health secretary, US President Donald Trump signed an executive order establishing “The President’s Commission to Make America Healthy Again”, with Kennedy as the chair.\n\nThe Make America Healthy Again movement (MAHA) is an initiative driven by Kennedy focusing on improving nutrition, increasing transparency in medical practices and reducing the corporate influence in health.\n\nThough premised primarily on combating chronic diseases, the movement also embraces skepticism of established medical practices, unproven alternative therapies and a general mistrust of institutions.\n\nWhat’s more, Kennedy’s focus on chronic diseases seems to be coming at the expense of continued work on infectious diseases.\n\nHe has proposed directing the National Institutes of Health to pause infectious disease research for eight years to prioritize research into chronic diseases and alternative treatments.\n\nAs health secretary, Kennedy has the power to shift research priorities. If he were to effectively halt infectious diseases research – in the wake of COVID and with a looming threat of future pandemics – this would be catastrophic for the US and global health.\n\nVaccine scepticism\n\nRelated to infectious diseases, there’s little doubt the area in which Kennedy has done the most damage relates to vaccines.\n\nHe has dedicated a large part of his life to undermining public confidence in vaccines. This is despite overwhelming scientific evidence demonstrating their safety and effectiveness, and the millions of lives they’ve saved.\n\nAlthough he has subsequently denied it, Kennedy is on record as falsely stating there is no such thing as a safe and effective vaccine. Notably, he has continued to push the debunked claim that the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine is linked to autism, despite the single study finding this having been widely discredited.\n\nKennedy’s frequent assertion that he’s not anti-vaccine, but “pro-safety”, is also deeply disingenuous. Being “pro-safety” is a deliberately vague notion designed to appear reasonable while at the same time undermining the scientific evidence.\n\nThe impact of Kennedy’s appointment as health secretary on vaccine confidence will not just be limited to the US. Vaccine hesitancy has been recognized as one of the greatest threats to public health. Having a vaccine sceptic leading the US health agencies has the potential to harm vaccine uptake worldwide.\n\nAs we’ve seen during the COVID pandemic, producing a vaccine is only half the battle. Convincing people to take it is just as important. There’s no doubt Kennedy’s influence on public health messaging could further erode vaccine confidence at a time when vaccine messaging must be clear.\n\nBad news for the US and the world\n\nOne of the reasons Kennedy poses such a threat to public health in the US and globally is his lack of trust in science. He believes a narrative can be crafted by picking and choosing any study that fits with his world view, regardless of its quality.\n\nIn addition, he personifies the bad-faith tactics of conspiracy theorists globally, “selling” the flawed premise that any assertion is valid until others prove it false.\n\nWhat the world needs now is a safe pair of hands leading public health in the US. Someone who is guided by evidence – not someone who promotes anti-science propaganda and conspiracy theories.\n\nHassan Vally is an Associate Professor of Epidemiology at Deakin University.",

        "source": "https://metrophiladelphia.com/",
        "fullContent": "Sign up for our email newsletter to stay up-to-date on the latest local sports news throughout Philadelphia.\n\nBuckle up, Union fans. Today is the last Monday without Philadelphia Union soccer until at least mid-October, and I’m happy to announce that I’ll be back covering the team’s journey through the MLS season for the 3rd consecutive year – for better or for worse.\n\n2025 marks the first season with new Head Coach Bradley Carnell at the helm, and there are still a few questions that need answering heading into a season that could have big implications for the club’s future direction. Let’s take a look at a few of those before Union’s first match of the 2025 season on Saturday night in Orlando.\n\nImage Credit: Philadelphia Union\n\n1) Carnell’s preferred starting XI and formation\n\nCarnell used several main formations during his time with St. Louis – 4-2-3-1, 4-2-2-2, and a 4-4-2 diamond, to name a few. Given the personnel and the fact that these players were familiar with a 4-4-2 diamond formation under the previous manager, Jim Curtin, I would favor Carnell rolling out the team in that type of setup, though I wouldn’t be entirely shocked by a 4-2-2-2.\n\nI’m taking a stab at it, but here’s my best guess as to how things would be lined up in a 4-4-2 diamond on Saturday night – given everyone is healthy and ready to go\n\nGK: Andre Blake\n\nRB: Nate Harriel, CB:Jakob Glesnes, CB: Ian Glavinovich, LB: Kai Wagner\n\nCDM: Jovan Lukić\n\nRCM: Quinn Sullivan, LCM: Danley Jean-Jacques\n\nCAM: Daniel Gazdag\n\nST: Mikael Uhre, Tai Baribo\n\nImage Credit: Philadelphia Union\n\n2) Will Carnell be able to make adjustments?\n\nFrom the small bits of pre-season action we’ve had access to, it’s clear Carnell is going to play Ernst Tanner’s desired style of Red-Bull-inspired soccer, which implements an over-the-top intense high-press that Carnell hopes will result in a 60-30-10 split on the attacking end – 60% of goals scored coming from transition, 30% from set pieces, and just 10% from possession.\n\nBut what happens when the Union plays a well-organized, low-block defensive team that forces them to play with the ball and create opportunities? What happens when Union goes down 1-0 early in the game, and the other team parks the bus? Will Carnell be able to adjust and tweak the squad to bring a different look to the pitch to try and change the game? Or will this Union team struggle to adjust and play with flexibility like they did under Jim Curtin at times?\n\nNov 2, 2024; Chester, Pennsylvania, USA; General view of Subaru Park before the game between Philadelphia Union II and Columbus Crew 2. Mandatory Credit: Caean Couto-Imagn Images\n\n3) Who’s the first player off the bench?\n\nIt’s been an issue each of the last two seasons – who do Union turn to on the bench to change the game when it’s not going the way they want?\n\n37-year-old veteran Midfielder Ale Bedoya will likely be one of the first players Bradley Carnell turns to on the bench this season. Bedoya registered 2 goals and 4 assists in just under 1,500 MLS minutes last season and showed he still had it in him to impact games both in the starting XI and off the bench, but I don’t think he should be depended on as the main guy to come off the bench and get you a goal when it’s needed most.\n\nAlternatively to Bedoya’s veteran presence, 2025 will be the season of introducing Union’s youth to the big stage. Players like Cavan Sullivan, Jeremy Rafanello, CJ Olney, and David Vazquez will likely get opportunities to make an impact off the bench as well in 2025.\n\nAnd, of course, once the signing of Bruno Damiani is finalized, which seems to be all but official at this point, the Union will have 3 MLS-ready strikers in their arsenal. I’d expect Damiani to start on the bench while he gets acclimated, but I wouldn’t be surprised to see him eventually take one of the starting spots, moving either Mikael Uhre or Tai Baribo to the bench and giving Union more solid options to bring on late in the game.\n\nImage Credit: Philadelphia Union\n\n4) Can the new boys hit the ground running?\n\nOne factor in Union’s success this season is how quickly the new signings can transition into the group and start making an impact on the field. Centerback Ian Glavinovich and Midfielder Jovan Lukić are two names that look set to claim spots in the starting XI right off the bat, with rumored striker signing Bruno Damiani hoping to do the same upon his arrival and acclimation.\n\nIn positive news for Union, Ian Glavinovich has gotten to attend a majority of pre-season training with his new club and head coach, with Jovan Lukić joining the team in the later portion of pre-season. That’s on top of Danley Jean-Jacques, who made his Union debut in the middle of the 2024 season, getting his first full pre-season with Union and a new manager under his belt. Those 3 having a smooth pre-season will be a huge factor in how quickly Union starts the season.\n\nAug 28, 2024; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA; Columbus Crew midfielder Alexandru Matan (20) plays the ball defended by Philadelphia Union midfielder Danley Jean Jacques (21) in the first half at Subaru Park. Mandatory Credit: Eric Hartline-USA TODAY Sports\n\n5) What exactly are the expectations for this team in 2025?\n\n2025 will be the Union’s first season with a new manager in charge in almost a decade, and it comes after missing the playoffs for the first time since 2017. So the big question is, what are the expectations surrounding this team in 2025, and how short is Bradley Carnell’s leash?\n\nI don’t think silverware is realistically on the mind of many Union fans heading into 2025, but surely, getting back into a playoff spot will be one of the main goals for the Blue and Gold this season. With 62% of the league able to qualify for postseason play, it has to be. But what if they don’t?\n\nI think it would be harsh to move on from Carnell after one season unless things go horribly, horribly wrong. But at the same time, Carnell is hand-picked by Ernst Tanner for Ernst Tanner’s style of soccer. The players brought in during the last 2 windows are players that fit Ernst Tanner’s style of play. The team will undoubtedly, and maybe even to a fault at times, play the style of soccer that Ernst Tanner has spent time and money building the entire organization around over the last few years.\n\nIf things start to head in the right direction and eventually it all works out, Union fans will all be singing praises about Ernst Tanner and the vision he’s brought to the club, and they should. But if it doesn’t work out, and the Union fails to make the playoffs again, who falls on the sword this time?\n\nSep 28, 2024; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA; Philadelphia Union defender Nathan Harriel (26) celebrates with teammates after scoring a goal against Atlanta United in the second half at Subaru Park.

        "fullContent": "Sign up for our email newsletter to stay up-to-date on the latest local sports news throughout Philadelphia.\n\nPitchers and catchers have all made their way down to beautiful Clearwooder for their spring training preparation. We are that much closer to baseball season, meaning we’re so close to hearing “BEER, BEER, BEER, BEER, BEEEEEEER” on our televisions for a month.\n\nThe Phillies were relatively quiet this offseason and lost pitchers Jeff Hoffman (Blue Jays) and Carlos Estévez (Royals) to free agency. Fans have questions about the roster, and we have answers! I teamed up with fellow Philadelphia Sports Network writer Shaun Nestor to answer some of those questions.\n\nWhich Phillies reliever will lead the team in saves at the end of the year?\n\nKylee: I’ll have to go with Orion Kerkering. Before I go into this, I want to make it clear I have a ton of faith in Jordan Romano. I just believe Kerkering will take that big of a leap forward and be the backbone that the Phillies need following Jeff Hoffman’s departure to Toronto.\n\nShaun: This may not be the popular answer, but I think Jordan Romano does the job there. Especially in Rob Thomson’s system of “bullpen by committee,” Romano’s experience will get him the bulk of the action while Jose Alvarado, Orion Kerkering, Matt Strahm, and others get their time in the 9th as well.\n\nPredict a Phillies trade deadline addition\n\nKylee: I think the Phillies will go after a relief pitcher. I don’t think it’ll be a high-end reliever because I believe Romano and Kerkering will take over, but more options in relief can’t possibly do any harm.\n\nShaun: You know, nothing stands out as a huge need to be filled at the trade deadline yet to me. But I’m going to go out on a limb here: a package likely involving one of Miller, Crawford, or Tait to the Brewers for Devin Williams and Rhys Hoskins. Spicy enough for you?\n\nAug 15, 2024; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA; Philadelphia Phillies outfielder Johan Rojas (18) hits an RBI single during the fourth inning against the Washington Nationals at Citizens Bank Park. Mandatory Credit: Bill Streicher-USA TODAY Sports\n\nAre there any position battles in camp?\n\nKylee: The obvious one is centerfield with Brandon Marsh and Johan Rojas, but you could argue the closer role has a position battle. As it stands, Jordan Romano is expected to have the Jeff Hoffman/main closer role, but I wouldn’t be surprised to see Orion Kerkering have a shot at the spot if Romano starts slow.\n\nShaun: If anything, Brandon Marsh and Johan Rojas will battle for the center field job, but I fully expect that to remain at the status quo with a platoon.\n\nWhat prospects not named Andrew Painter can you see getting called up this season?\n\nKylee: I would be very shocked to see Justin Crawford and Aidan Miller up this season. Dave Dombrowski already said he sees Miller as a 2026 at-best guy. With that in mind, I would expect to see Mick Abel up at some point. I don’t think he’ll make it right out of camp, but I see it happening by the trade deadline.\n\nShaun: Technically I expect Mick Abel will make the Phillies bullpen out of camp, but that’s not really what this question is asking. If anything, I would expect Jean Cabrera, Seth Johnson, or Griff McGarry to come up at some point to fill in for an injury here or there, but I wouldn’t get my hopes up for Aidan Miller or Justin Crawford just yet.\n\nMandatory Credit: Jonathan Dyer-Imagn Images",

        "fullContent": "A view of the Stonewall Inn from Christopher Park, which is also the home of the Stonewall National Monument.\n\nSign up for our Gay City News email newsletter to get news, updates, and local insights delivered straight to your inbox!\n\nCommunity members protested at Christopher Park on Feb. 14 after the National Park Service removed references to transgender individuals from its online website, representing just the latest example of the Trump administration’s overwhelming quest to erase transgender individuals from American life.\n\n“Before the 1960s, almost everything about living openly as a lesbian, gay, bisexual (LGB) person was illegal,” the National Park Service’s website says, as of the morning of Feb. 14. “The Stonewall Uprising on June 28, 1969 is a milestone in the quest for LGB civil rights and provided momentum for a movement.”\n\nThe move, which involved deleting TQ+ from LGBTQ+, appeared to align the National Park Service with President Donald Trump’s blatantly transphobic executive order recognizing only male and female genders according to an individual’s gender assigned at birth.\n\nThe Stonewall National Monument is located within Christopher Park and was designated in 2016 by former President Barack Obama as the first federal monument dedicated to the LGBTQ community.\n\nThe updates to the National Park Service’s website immediately prompted widespread anger from community members and elected officials, leading to the Christopher Park demonstration.\n\n“I’m not going to allow any government, any organization, any person to take away the joy that I feel as a trans person,” Berne Wagenblast, who is one of the voices of the New York City subway system. Wagenblast delighted the crowd by repeating one of her most-heard lines: “Please stand away from the platform edge.”\n\nOut gay State Senator Brad Hoylman-Sigal, who represents the area encompassing the Stonewall Inn, said the decision to remove trans references from the website amounts to “one of the darkest moments in American history.”\n\nHoylman-Sigal said the Trump administration is seeking to rewrite history and discriminate against an entire population of Americans.\n\n“This decision cannot stand,” Hoylman-Sigal stated, adding: “I pledge to continue to work harder than ever to further enshrine the rights of transgender New Yorkers in state and city law.”\n\nAnother out gay lawmaker, Councilmember Erik Bottcher, who also represents the area around the Stonewall Inn, similarly blasted the move.\n\n“Trump is trying to erase the very existence of transgender people,” Bottcher wrote on X. “He’s trying to cleave our community apart and divide us. He’s not going to succeed. Lesbians and gays are not going to abandon our transgender siblings. We are one community.”\n\nNew York Gov. Kathy Hochul also criticized the change, describing it as “cruel and petty.”\n\n“Transgender people play a critical role in the fight for LGBTQ+ rights — and New York will never allow their contributions to be erased,” Hochul wrote on X.\n\nSenator Chuck Schumer of New York, the minority leader, said, “This move to try to erase transgender people from the Stonewall National Monument is cruel, pathetic, and historically inaccurate. Transgender New Yorkers played a critical role in the events at Stonewall and in the movement for equality that it inspired. The Park Service should reverse themselves immediately.”\n\nStacy Lentz, a co-owner of the Stonewall Inn, told Gay City News on Feb. 14 that although the move wasn’t necessarily surprising given who occupies the White House, it still hits the community hard.\n\n“It’s painful and it’s unacceptable that they want to erase an entire part of the community,” Lentz said, acknowledging the participation of transgender individuals in the Stonewall Uprising. “To have them come into our house — it’s alarming. This should be alarming to everyone, not just the LGBTQ community.”\n\nAngelica Christina, an out trans board member of the Stonewall Inn Gives Back Initiative, which is the charitable arm of the Stonewall Inn, told Gay City News she is “entirely offended” and “disgusted” by the federal government’s erasure of the trans community.\n\n“What we’re seeing right now is the erasure of LGBTQIA+ history, and American history,” Christina said. “What we’re witnessing right now is an attempted gendercide of trans folks.”\n\nThe Office of Mayor Eric Adams, who has developed close ties with President Trump, offered an indirect answer when asked by Gay City News to comment on the National Park Service’s transphobic move.\n\n“We remain steadfast in our commitment to fostering a safe, inclusive, and affirming environment where every person can thrive,” a spokesperson for Adams told Gay City News. “Here in New York City, our policies have not changed at our schools or at our hospitals and we will continue to provide care for all, regardless of race, gender, religion or sexual orientation.”\n\nMark Segal, a Stonewall veteran who is the founder and publisher of the Philadelphia Gay News, called on community members to remember this moment as the beginning of the second Stonewall Rebellion.\n\n“The spirit of Stonewall means to be visible and fight back against oppression,” Segal said in a written statement. “You cannot erase the history of Stonewall by erasing a letter. You cannot erase trans people by erasing a letter. This petty, vindictive action is an attempt to not only erase trans people from public view, but also the entire LGBT community. Stonewall, including all of us in the LGBT community who fought back that historic night and have continued to fight for 55 years, cannot and will not be erased. We will continue to fight, we will continue to be visible and persevere…”\n\nLentz, who said the federal government had not communicated anything to her, is calling on members of the public to visit the National Park Service’s website and navigate to a page where folks can voice their concerns.\n\nFor now, though, she wants folks to step up and join in.\n\n“I think we’re seeing a lot of complacency, especially a lot of leadership in the Democratic Party,” Lentz said. “Pride started as a protest. We want to make sure our voices are being heard.”\n\nThe National Park Service did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nBelow are some more photos from the Feb. 14 demonstration at Stonewall:",

It didn’t take long for the fun to begin. From police officers running their own iteration of the ‘Tush Push’, to fans cheering busses filled with other random fans, it was certainly a day to remember.\n\nHowie Roseman stole the show before even getting to the stage. The esteemed GM sported a cut at the top of his head after what many assume to be a clash with a beer can. After smoking a cigar in what might go down as one of the coldest pictures of the entire day, Roseman took to the stage outside the Art Museum to tell fans he ‘BLEEDS for this city’, and he meant it quite literally.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/sportscenter/status/1890498731453083708?s=61&t=7BbLnpr1DB45SPN7vMZwFQ\n\nThe Eagles soar down Broad Street\n\nThe players had their fair share of wholesome moments. Zack Baun signed someone’s baby, while Nolan Smith lifted a small child atop his shoulders while walking down and greeting ecstatic fans.\n\nSaquon Barkley found one of the teams’ ball boys in the crowd, lifting him over the barrier and inviting him into the parade with the rest of the team. As soon as you think you can’t love that man any more, he finds yet another new way to make you smile from ear to ear.\n\nDallas Goedert shotgunned a beer in front of the fans, which became a common theme for the day.\n\nQuinyon Mitchell was particularly excitable, screaming ‘GO EAGLES’ into the microphone of a Fox 29 reporter. James Bradberry played a great veteran role in running over to keep things moderately tame, but there was no stopping Landon Dickerson’s passion…\n\nhttps://twitter.com/brendendeeg_/status/1890448027501875316?s=61&t=7BbLnpr1DB45SPN7vMZwFQ\n\nThe dominant lineman would go on to drop the speech of the day, stating how he’s ‘never played an away game in his whole career’, attesting to the passion of the travelling Eagles fans.\n\nFeb 14, 2025; Philadelphia, PA, USA; Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Jalen Hurts holds the Vince Lombardi Trophy during the Super Bowl LIX championship parade and rally. Mandatory Credit: Kirby Lee-Imagn Images\n\nOther notable quotes\n\nA.J Brown’s speech to the City of Philadelphia was a sensational one. He gave the World a ‘mic drop’ moment, reminding everyone about the criticisms he’s faced since signing with the team.\n\n‘They said I was a diva. They said all I care about was stats. Well, if you’re gonna say all those things, get one thing right… I’m a f**king champion!’\n\nThe ‘Exciting Whites’ took to the stage with hefty applause and to the backdrop of ‘dreams and nightmares’. I don’t think the Eagles can ever break that tandem up now…\n\nJalen Hurts was the man of the moment and who a lot fans couldn’t wait to hear from. After returning from his Disney World trip and seeing the iconic ‘LOVE’ statue be upgraded with a ‘,Hurts’ feature, the Super Bowl MVP greeted fans warmly before stating how he promised himself he wouldn’t visit the Rocky steps until he won a championship. He can safely tick that one off the bucket list.\n\nThe Super Bowl parade wouldn’t be complete without a little chaos from CJGJ!\n\nhttps://twitter.com/sluggahjells/status/1890493030043398646?s=61&t=7BbLnpr1DB45SPN7vMZwFQ\n\nAnd of course, the iconic Eagles fanbase was out in full force, draping the streets in kelly green and showing their passion for the team in some brilliant ways:\n\nBeating the shit out of Kermit on Broad Street #EaglesParade pic.twitter.com/zjSm9WyOdw — Dalai Loml (@thealexbasso) February 14, 2025\n\nWe also want to send our thoughts to those impacted by the shootings at today’s Super Bowl parade.

        "source": "https://metrophiladelphia.com/",
        "fullContent": "Nov 16, 2024; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA; Philadelphia Flyers defenseman Emil Andrae (36) reaches for the puck against the Buffalo Sabres in the second period at Wells Fargo Center. Mandatory Credit: Kyle Ross-Imagn Images\n\nSign up for our email newsletter to stay up-to-date on the latest local sports news throughout Philadelphia.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Philadelphia Flyers’ forwards were given player grades as the 4 Nations Face-Off break arrived. Now, it’s time to take a look at how the defensemen and goaltenders have fared, as we are just crossing over the halfway point of the 2024-25 season.\n\nThe Flyers’ defense has been quite stable so far. Travis Sanheim, who is representing Team Canada at the 4 Nations Face-Off, has solidified himself as the Flyers’ No. 1 defenseman. Cam York continues to make positive strides and is preparing himself for a payday this summer, and Rasmus Ristolainen has mightily improved on the defensive side of the puck. Ristolainen did make Team Finland for the 4 Nations Face-Off, but he won’t play due to injury.\n\nLooking at the goaltending, it’s certainly been tough sledding. Samuel Ersson, representing Team Sweden at the 4 Nations Face-Off, has had his ups and downs this year but has provided stability between the pipes since the Christmas break. Ivan Fedotov and Aleksei Kolosov have struggled more than succeeded, but that was to be expected in their first full seasons in North America.\n\nHere are player grades for the Flyers’ defensemen and goaltenders thus far in 2024-25:\n\nFlyers defensemen\n\nTravis Sanheim: A\n\nSanheim has proved he’s the Flyers’ top defenseman and is also proving that his long-term extension signed by former general manager Chuck Fletcher was worth the price.\n\nSanheim ranks first in points by Flyers defensemen with 27 (6G, 21A) and first overall in ice-time, averaging 24:34 per game. He scored 44 points during 2023-24 and is on pace to meet similar numbers this year. On a true contending team, Sanheim would probably be the #2 or #3 defenseman, but on the Flyers, he’s the top guy and has been solid all around this year.\n\nJamie Drysdale: B\n\nJamie Drysdale was going to be one of the main players to watch this season regarding development. He played injured throughout most of his first Flyers season in 2023-24 and underwent surgery in the offseason.\n\nHe started this season a bit slow and suffered an upper-body injury that saw him miss 12 games. But since returning from injury, he’s been one of the team’s best defensemen. He’s showing his offensive capabilities and has thrived since facing his former team, the Anaheim Ducks, on Jan. 11 at the Wells Fargo Center.\n\nDrysdale has the opportunity to play a pivotal role in the Flyers’ future, and he’s starting to put all of the pieces in the right places.\n\nFeb 8, 2025; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA; Philadelphia Flyers defenseman Jamie Drysdale (9) grabs Pittsburgh Penguins left wing Danton Heinen (43) during a shot in the third period at Wells Fargo Center. Mandatory Credit: Kyle Ross-Imagn Images\n\nRasmus Ristolainen: B-\n\nEven if Ristolainen doesn’t return to the offensive producer he was in his junior career and Buffalo, he’s stepped up his defensive game massively since being a member of the Flyers. All credit for his improved defense goes to associate coach Brad Shaw.\n\nRistolainen has 15 points (2G, 13A) in 54 games this year and is on pace to set a career-high in points in his Flyers career. He registered 20 points (3G, 17A) during 2022-23. He’s been placed in every situation over the last few months, ranging from powerplay time to seeing the ice in overtime.\n\nHis name has been brought up in trade rumors as the trade deadline approaches, so we’ll see what his future looks like. If he stays or goes, he’s become a sound defensive player in Philadelphia.\n\nNick Seeler makes a visible difference when he’s in the lineup compared to being out. He has 13 points (3G, 10A) in 52 games played and is one point shy of tying a career high that he set with the Flyers in 2022-23.\n\nHe gives his all every game and is never afraid to step up and defend his teammates physically. Seeler plays a solid and tough defensive game and has revived his career since joining Philadelphia.\n\nJan 2, 2025; Las Vegas, Nevada, USA; Vegas Golden Knights defenseman Nicolas Hague (14) banks a shot off the stick of Philadelphia Flyers defenseman Nick Seeler (24) to score a goal against goaltender Aleksei Kolosov (35) during the second period at T-Mobile Arena. Mandatory Credit: Stephen R. Sylvanie-Imagn Images\n\nCam York: C+\n\nYork is due for a contract extension this summer. His two-year, $3.2 million deal that he signed on July 10, 2023, will expire.\n\nYork ranks second overall in ice-time on the roster, averaging 21:14 per game. He has turned into a player willing to put his body on the line, having blocked 84 shots this year. He does experience some inconsistencies at times, but when his game is on, watch out.\n\nHe was scratched by John Tortorella against the Los Angeles Kings on Dec. 19, showing that nobody is safe from watching a game in the press box on occasion. It will be interesting to see what numbers Daniel Briere presents York in the off-season regarding a new contract.\n\nEmil Andrae has suited up in 24 games this year, scoring six points (1G, 5A). He’s mostly stepped in for injured defensemen, being recalled from the Lehigh Valley Phantoms, and has been one of the better defensemen at times.\n\nYou can make the argument that he’s also outshined York at times. Both players are left-handed defensemen. Andrae appears to have a permanent spot on the Flyers’ blue line in the future, and he’s turned some heads multiple times this season.\n\nErik Johnson: D\n\nErik Johnson mostly steps in when an injury occurs. He signed a one-year extension with the Flyers last summer and will most likely be gone at the end of the season.\n\nHe plays a large mentorship role in the locker room with the younger players. His veteran presence and Stanley Cup-winning mentality doesn’t go unnoticed.\n\nEgor Zamula: D\n\nEgor Zamula has had a rough season. He’s struggled both on offense and defense and is prone to making many mistakes. He has 11 points (3G, 8A) in 39 games.\n\nIt’s unclear what Zamula’s future looks like in Philadelphia, especially with the emergence of Andrae. He was placed on the injured reserve on Jan. 31.\n\nFlyers goalies\n\nSamuel Ersson: B\n\nIn 31 games played, Ersson is 16-10-3. He holds a 2.82 GAA and a .890SV%. He’s easily been the best out of the bunch this year and will be the Flyers’ No. 1 goalie moving forward.\n\nSince returning from the Christmas break, Ersson is 9-4-1 with a 2.26 GAA and a .920SV%. He’s been dominant even in recent losses to the Colorado Avalanche and Utah Hockey Club.\n\nErsson will serve as the third goaltender for Sweden in the 4 Nations Face-Off.\n\nJan 23, 2025; New York, New York, USA; New York Rangers center Filip Chytil (72) (not pictured) scores a goal past Philadelphia Flyers goaltender Samuel Ersson (33) during the third period at Madison Square Garden. Mandatory Credit: Dennis Schneidler-Imagn Images\n\nIvan Fedotov: C-\n\nIn 17 games played, Fedotov is 4-8-1, carrying a 3.26 GAA and .877SV%. It’s been a rocky year for Fedotov, and he has cost the Flyers at times in games. He has made some slick saves but has been underwhelming.\n\nAleksei Kolosov: C-\n\nSimilar to Fedotov, Kolosov was also underwhelming in his stint with the team this year. It’s still his first year playing hockey in North America, like Fedotov, so there are adjustments still being learned.\n\nIn 15 games played, Kolosov is 4-8-1 with a 3.45 GAA and .870SV%. He’s also seen some struggles with the Phantoms, so development is the #1 priority for him.\n\nMandatory Credit: Kyle Ross-Imagn Images",

        "source": "https://metrophiladelphia.com/",
        "fullContent": "Sign up for our email newsletter to stay up-to-date on the latest local sports news throughout Philadelphia.\n\nEagles’ star running back, Saquon Barkley got caught up in the moment. Blame it on the alcohol.\n\nSitting at the post-game podium, with his Super Bowl champions shirt on and hat flipped to the side — along with his two beautiful kids on his lap — daughter, Jada; son, Saquon Jr. — the NFL Offensive Player of the Year contemplated the future of the Eagles’ franchise, specifically saying: “Why not start our dynasty now?”\n\nBarkley uttered it twice, in two different settings. And why not? The Eagles are young. They are motivated. They own the most talented roster in football. They are humble yet hungry. Most importantly, they are the reigning world champions.\n\nBut, speaking dynasties into existence doesn’t necessarily make them true. Winning one Lombardi Trophy is the toughest row to hoe in sports, something that Barkley understands better than anyone and went on record to clear up.\n\n“I said after the game, why can’t our dynasty start now … I probably had a little bit of champagne and some other stuff in my system at the time but you really can’t focus on that,” Barkley said during a press conference at Raising Cane’s in Trevose, PA. “You gotta enjoy the moment, it’s hard to win one … you take it in, you enjoy the moment, and you start over … and it kind of starts over after Friday.”\n\nFriday is the Eagles’ Championship Parade, a joyous jaunt down Broad Street on what is sure to be the greenest Valentine’s Day in city history. A million fans are expected to turn out for the second parade in seven years.\n\n“There’s been a lot of adversity, a lot of ups and downs,” Barkley said, “but it is the perfect timing to do it here, to do it as a part of this city, and with these fans, it’s truly amazing.”\n\nJudging by the crowd at Raising Cane’s — approximately 1,000 people showed up on a random Thursday to cheer on Barkley as he worked the drive-thru line and served up chicken fingers at the counter — it’s going to be a mess. A beautiful, verdurous, unapologetically awesome mess of humanity.\n\nBarkley is ready for it. All of it.\n\n“I don’t know what to expect,” Barkley said. “The Philly fans have been amazing all year round, just the love and support that they have for this team. This city truly buys into this team, you could see it there [as he pointed to the parking lot at Raising Cane’s], look how many people showed up. I’m expecting it to be a blast, a party.”\n\nThe last time the masses hijacked Broad Street, Jason Kelce took center stage in that obnoxious Mummers costume and morphed into Maximus. His speech was the stuff of legend. So, which Eagles player will provide the encore?\n\n“It won’t be me, I can guarantee you that,” Barkley said. “That’s not my thing. If I had to pick one I would say either Lane Johnson or BG [Brandon Graham]. And I think they are the two longest-tenured Eagles right now … so, I think it would just be perfect for one of those two to do that, especially if it is BG. Last game with us and last year, for him to go out with a bang, I think that would be pretty cool.”\n\nDream Starts Over: After the Eagles’ Ring Ceremony\n\nFootball – NFL – Super Bowl LIX – Philadelphia Eagles v Kansas City Chiefs – Caesars Superdome, New Orleans, Louisiana, United States – February 9, 2025 Philadelphia Eagles’ Saquon Barkley celebrates with the Vince Lombardi Trophy after winning Super Bowl LIX REUTERS/Mike Segar\n\nA.J. Brown said the euphoria from winning Super Bowl 59 lasted two days, then it was “back to work.” DeVonta Smith has echoed that sentiment in recent interviews, with Jalen Hurts saying the same thing in private conversations.\n\nSaquon Barkley said he’ll enjoy the championship parade — “shoot for the stars and land on the moon,” is his favorite saying — but then it’s back to the drawing board. The Eagles are starting from scratch. The Super Bowl ring ceremony is the only thing left to celebrate on the offseason calendar.\n\n“Whenever the ring ceremony is, that’s probably the last day we truly celebrate being a Super Bowl champion and then it’s back to work,” Barkley said. “Two nights ago I had a hard time sleeping because I’m thinking about how I’m going to attack the offseason because you kind of get — greedy’s not the word — but addicted to it. You want to find a way how you can hold that Lombardi up again and do it all over again.”\n\n(The Eagles were fitted for their Super Bowl rings later in the day. The ceremony will probably be in June sometime, at least that’s when they did it in 2018).\n\n“So, you take it in, you cherish it,” Barkley continued. “You enjoy it, you appreciate the fans but the dynasty thing … you can’t really get caught up in that, and the way you do that is by putting the work in. There’s a reason why we won, it’s not by accident, so we gotta try and do it all over again next year.”\n\nThere’s that dynasty thing again. It’s not a bad word. It’s not overconfidence or cockiness. It’s just the reality of the thing.\n\n“Dream starts over,” Barkley said.\n\nPartnering Up with Todd Graves at Raising Cane’s\n\nFeb 9, 2025; New Orleans, LA, USA; Philadelphia Eagles wide receiver DeVonta Smith (6) celebrates with running back Saquon Barkley (26) after scoring a touchdown against the Kansas City Chiefs during the second half of Super Bowl LIX at Caesars Superdome. Mandatory Credit: Geoff Burke-Imagn Images\n\nBarkley’s appearance at Raising Cane’s in Trevose, PA on Thursday (February 13) wasn’t by accident. The superstar running back struck up a friendship with owner Todd Graves at a Formula One racing event in Miami earlier this year. Then, Graves traveled to the Super Bowl in New Orleans to cheer on Barkley and the Eagles from a suite.\n\n“It was amazing watching Saquon, Jalen and the team win the Super Bowl on Sunday night,” Graves said. “It was a great game and seeing Saquon hold the Lombardi Trophy and be named Offensive Player of the Year all within his first season with Philly was great.”\n\nThat bond turned into a partnership. Barkley didn’t just show up to Raising Cane’s for a quick photo opportunity. No, the 28-year-old took orders at the counter and handed out chicken fingers at the drive-thru. He also participated in a lengthy commercial shoot for the fast-food chain, delivering scripted lines like: “You know the secret to winning rings? Good fingers. Like Raising Cane’s chicken fingers. Tastes like victory!”\n\nBarkley also poured out samples of a new green lemonade that Raising Cane’s concocted to honor the Eagles’ Super Bowl win. The refreshing drink is a limited-time offering at area restaurants.\n\n“I loved working the drive-thru with Todd,” said Barkley. “The first time I came to Cane’s was in Charlotte with my teammates. My favorite thing to eat is the Box Combo – you can never go wrong with chicken fingers and fries.”\n\nREUTERS/Mike Segar",

As a release notes, the evening will be a collaboration of Gullah Geechee cuisine infused with Ember & Ash’s live-fire cooking techniques, including ingredients grown at Gilliard Farms—the 50-acre homestead was purchased by Matthew’s great-great-great-grandfather and freed slave Jupiter Gilliard in 1874 for $9.\n\nWhile there, diners will be able to indulge in dishes like shrimp toast with saffron coconut rice and pickled okra; head hash terrine with fennel and citrus; smoked grouper with middlin risotto and hoja santa; sweet potato olive oil cake; and more. Seating times are 5, 6 and 7 p.m., and the dinner comes out to be $95 per person (plus tax and gratuity). Reservations are available now via Resy.\n\n“We’ve wanted to do a collaboration with longtime friends Scott and Lulu Calhoun of Ember & Ash for a while, as my ties to Philly run deep,” explained Tia in a statement. Both Scott and Tia worked with chef Marc Vetri at Lo Spiedo, and Tia was the culinary director for his nonprofit, Vetri Community Partnership from 2012 to 2014.\n\nThe Raifords, who were Culinary Institute of America grads, decided to switch gears to take their culinary skills to their historic farm in rural Georgia with a mission in mind: To “engage the world with African American foodways, revive the holistic practices of their ancestors, and help to feed their diverse community high-quality, locally-grown organic produce that are sustainably farmed.”\n\nAs a release notes, the couple believes in cultivating the land and pioneering a return to the regenerative practices of their forefathers — the Freshwater Gullah Geechee, who were direct descendants of West Africans brought to the U.S. as slaves for their expertise in rice and indigo cultivation.\n\nThis Black History Month celebration will continue with the Bookers event on the 26. Titled “A Great Migration Dinner,” Matthew will be using his skills as a historian and climate change activist to lead guests through a multi-course dinner and discussion recounting the history of the movement to the urban North by six million southern Blacks between 1910 and 1970. The James Beard semi-finalist and author of ‘Bress ‘n’ Nyam’ will also delve into how they brought their rich culinary traditions to a new life in the Northeast, Midwest, and West.\n\nHighlighted dishes span a pickled vegetable plate with Jamaican-style spinach patties, De Wata (salmon croquettes with red rice and herb salad),Win’ – Poulet Yassa (Senegalese style lemon pepper chicken with vegan teff stew), sweet potato pone with toasted walnut semifreddo and more. There will also be two De Spirits (complimentary cocktails) — a Gullah Geechie Gin Rickey or an alcohol-free hibiscus and lime spritzer.\n\n“Many African Americans’ roots can be traced to the Great Migration, including our own families,” said Cheri and Tracey Syphax from Booker’s restaurant in a statement. “We thought it would be a no-brainer to have Matthew join us for this special event, especially during Black History Month, given the fact that the namesake of our restaurant Booker Wright, is a famous waiter who worked in a whites-only restaurant in the 1960s Mississippi while also running his restaurant that catered to black customers.”\n\nThe dinner starts at 6 p.m. and costs $75 per person (plus tax and gratuity).\n\nTo find out more information on “From Georgia with Love”, visit emberandashphilly.com and bookersrestaurantandbar.com",

After a lengthy and grueling season, Philadelphia heads into the offseason with a few questions to answer.\n\nIn the latest edition of my Eagles mailbag, I’ll discuss Philadelphia’s next offensive coordinator, biggest offseason needs and much more regarding the team moving forward.\n\n@laAJbrownance asked, “Who is your personal favorite for the OC job?”\n\nNov 24, 2024; Inglewood, California, USA; Philadelphia Eagles head coach Nick Sirianni watches game action against the Los Angeles Rams during the second half at SoFi Stadium. Mandatory Credit: Gary A. Vasquez-Imagn Images\n\nNathan Scheelhaase is a potential offensive coordinator candidate that I have previously mentioned. Scheelhaase reportedly withdrew from the running for the Jacksonville Jaguars’ offensive coordinator opening to remain with the Los Angeles Rams earlier in February. Yet he has previously interviewed with the Eagles prior to the team promoting Brian Johnson in 2023.\n\nScheelhaase worked under Iowa State head coach Matt Campbell for several years, who is a close friend and former college teammate of Eagles head coach Nick Sirianni. Last season, Scheelhaase serves as the Rams pass game specialist and “play drawer” for Sean McVay.\n\nGiven his potential, Scheelhaase is certainly my personal favorite candidate for Philadelphia’s offensive coordinator opening. Although, the early indications are that Kevin Patullo will be promoted to fill that role for the Eagles in 2025.\n\n@BrentleyDOliver asked, “What is the biggest need for the Eagles for next season?”\n\nFeb 9, 2025; New Orleans, LA, USA; Philadelphia Eagles defensive tackle Milton Williams (93) celebrates on the podium after defeating the Kansas City Chiefs in Super Bowl LIX at Ceasars Superdome. Mandatory Credit: Mark J. Rebilas-Imagn Images\n\nFour of Philadelphia’s starters from their Super Bowl winning roster are set to hit free agency: Mekhi Becton, Josh Sweat, Milton Williams and Zack Baun. There’s also a chance that Nakobe Dean could miss a significant amount of time due to his knee injury next season as well.\n\nYet Eagles general manager Howie Roseman has strategically built this roster to have in-house replacements at several positions of potential weakness in 2025. Therefore, Philadelphia’s biggest positions of need are more long-term.\n\nHere’s how I would rank the top five needs for the Eagles this offseason:\n\nDefensive Tackle: Milton Williams will likely command a massive contract in free agency and the Eagles need to keep the potential fifth-year option for Jordan Davis and contract extension for Jalen Carter in mind. Offensive Tackle: Lane Johnson isn’t getting any younger and both of Philadelphia’s offensive tackles missed time this past season. Fred Johnson filled in admirably off the bench but he’ll be a free agent. Tight End: Dallas Goedert is essentially guaranteed to miss multiple games each season and Grant Calcaterra was far too inconsistent to be a reliable replacement for the 30-year-old tight end moving forward. Edge Defender: While both Josh Sweat and Brandon Graham could be done in Philadelphia, the Eagles still have a ton of potential on the edge in Nolan Smith and Jalyx Hunt. Cornerback: Quinyon Mitchell and Cooper DeJean are absolute studs. Yet Darius Slay’s future in Philadelphia is murky due to his contract situation and Isaiah Rodgers is set to become a free agent this offseason.\n\n@VladdyMuse asked, “Do you expect any contract restructure(s)? If so, who?”\n\nDec 31, 2023; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA; Philadelphia Eagles general manager Howie Roseman (middle) and head coach Nick Sirianni (L) walk from the tunnel before a game against the Arizona Cardinals at Lincoln Financial Field. Mandatory Credit: Bill Streicher-USA TODAY Sports\n\nRoseman has shown over the years that he is willing to get creative with contract structure to create additional cap space. One potential option would be to restructure Saquon Barkley’s current contract, converting a portion of his base salary into a signing bonus to free up around $1.3 million in 2025.\n\nLane Johnson has talked about playing for a few more years as well. Therefore, he could help the Eagles out by restructuring his current contract and freeing up nearly $3 million in 2025 as well.\n\nPhiladelphia could also create nearly $4 million in cap space in 2025 by restructuring Dallas Goedert’s contract. Yet given his lengthy injury history, he could actually be a sneaky cut or trade candidate this offseason as well.\n\n@Michael93826345 asked, “Who are some edge free agents that intrigue you?”\n\nSep 22, 2024; Cleveland, Ohio, USA; New York Giants linebacker Bobby Okereke (58) and New York Giants linebacker Azeez Ojulari (51) celebrate after a sack during the first quarter against the Cleveland Browns at Huntington Bank Field. Mandatory Credit: Ken Blaze-Imagn Images\n\nFangio has earned the right to have his finger prints all over the construction of Philadelphia’s defense moving forward. It’s clear that the Bryce Huff project didn’t work as planned, which is why Fangio could look to reunite with two of his former players in 2025.\n\nKhalil Mack is a decorated veteran that has essentially done it all except win a Super Bowl in the NFL. Fangio and Mack spent once season together in 2018 and Philadelphia’s defensive coordinator still praises the 33-year-old veteran today. If Mack wants to chase a Super Bowl ring, he could sign with the Eagles in free agency.\n\nBaron Browning was a third-round pick by the Denver Broncos in Fangio’s final season as the team’s head coach. Browning has been inconsistent in the NFL thus far and could reunite with Fangio to revitalize his career in 2025.\n\nAzeez Ojulari is just 24-years-old and showed a ton of promise with the New York Giants at times. While the Giants confusingly refused to trade Ojulari in a contract year, he would thrive as a rotational pass rusher in Philadelphia. Especially given the chance to reunite with several of his former teammates from the University of Georgia.\n\nMandatory Credit: Stephen Lew-Imagn Images",

        "fullContent": "Sign up for our email newsletter to stay up-to-date on the latest local sports news throughout Philadelphia.\n\nThe Philadelphia 76ers are set to convert recently acquired guard Jared Butler to a standard NBA contract, according to ESPN’s Shams Charania. The former second-round pick started this season on a two-way deal with the Washington Wizards before being traded to the Sixers, along with four second-round picks, in exchange for Reggie Jackson and an extremely unfavorable 2026 first-round pick.\n\nSince joining the Sixers, Butler has averaged 10.0 points and 4.7 assists a night, quickly establishing himself as another piece of the Sixers’ potential young core. Given Jared McCain‘s season-ending injury and the new knee injury that kept star guard Tyrese Maxey from playing against the Brooklyn Nets, converting Butler to a standard deal will provide some more stability in head coach Nick Nurse’s guard rotation.\n\nFeb 9, 2025; Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA; Philadelphia 76ers guard Jared Butler (12) drives for the basket against Milwaukee Bucks forward Bobby Portis (9) during the second quarter at Fiserv Forum. Mandatory Credit: Jeff Hanisch-Imagn Images\n\nButler has spent time with the Utah Jazz, the Oklahoma City Thunder, and the aforementioned Washington Wizards before finally landing this contract with the Sixers. The former Baylor guard got his start in the NBA after being selected at pick 40 in the 2021 NBA draft but has not been able to find a steady place to call home.\n\nThe search for that home may be over as the Sixers’s dismal season and proven track record at developing young, overlooked players provide the most stable breeding ground for Butler’s success. The Sixers will need to clear a roster spot before officially converting Butler. Given that both Chuma Okeke and David Roddy are on 10-day deals, it’s likely the Sixers will simply allow one or both to return to free agency after their ten days are up.\n\nButler’s future with the Sixers\n\nThis deal does not necessarily impact the Sixers’s offseason hopes of retaining Kelly Oubre Jr., Guerschon Yabusele, and Quenton Grimes. While Butler’s deal is not just a one-year contract, the second year is a team option that gives the Sixers flexibility come the offseason. This means that the Sixers’s plan of retaining Yabusele and the others is still very much alive and just as possible as it was before the very deserving contract was handed out.\n\nFeb 9, 2025; Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA; Philadelphia 76ers guard Jared Butler (12) passes the ball around dMilwaukee Bucks guard Gary Trent Jr. (5) during the fourth quarter at Fiserv Forum. Mandatory Credit: Jeff Hanisch-Imagn Images\n\nPhiladelphia may still look to keep Butler in the long term. Should the 24-year-old guard continue to show his outstanding playmaking skills and lay claim to the backup point guard role once everyone is healthy, the Sixers could pick up his team option and secure his services for another year or decline it in search of a longer team-friendly deal. If Butler fails to stick in the rotation as players become healthy, the Sixers can decline the second year and send him into free agency with no effect on their cap sheet.\n\nWhile Butler isn’t a generational player by any means, he has shown that he has the skills to make a difference. When he was with the Wizards, Butler scored a career-high 26 points against Philadelphia just last month. If anyone has the right situation to help Butler become a consistent contributor in this league, it’s the Sixers.\n\nPhiladelphia has been one of the best in the NBA when it comes to developing young, overlooked players these past two years, with both Ricky Council IV and Justin Edwards proving that they belong. With Butler’s playmaking and ball-handling skills being desperate needs for the Sixers, he could soon join the list as another piece of a sneaky young core in Philadelphia.",

        "source": "https://metrophiladelphia.com/",
        "fullContent": "Sign up for our Daily Email newsletter to stay up-to-date on the latest local news throughout Philadelphia.\n\nAfter earning a 2022 Oscar for Best Documentary Film with his directorial debut, ‘Summer of Soul (…Or, When the Revolution Could Not Be Televised)’, Philadelphia native Ahmir “Questlove” Thompson—co-founder of The Roots and drummer for The Tonight Show band—was undoubtedly ready for an encore.\n\nInstead of one encore, Questlove gave us two.\n\nFirst is the freshly-released film, the NBC documentary ‘Ladies & Gentlemen… 50 Years of SNL Music‘, to coincide with the 50th anniversary celebration of ‘Saturday Night Live‘, and secondly, this week’s ‘Sly Lives! (aka the Burden of Black Genius),’ is a study of Sly & Family Stone and Black music innovators such as Andre 3000 and D’Angelo.\n\nQuestlove’s ‘Ladies & Gentlemen… 50 Years of SNL Music’ doc features footage of the program’s storied live performances, from the Rolling Stones, David Bowie, Run DMC and more, and can currently be streamed on Peacock. ‘Sly Lives!’ is available for streaming on Hulu.\n\n“When we did ‘Summer of Soul‘, Ahmir and I came from the same starting point — we both knew and loved most of its artists,” says Questlove’s filmmaking partner, Oscar-winning producer Joseph Patel, talking about that 2021 documentary’s list of stars such as Stevie Wonder, Nina Simone, Gladys Knight & the Pips and more.\n\n“With ‘Sly Lives!’, it was Quest who held great importance for Sly Stone,” notes Patel. “That was one of Ahmir’s longtime favorites and one of his most influential artists.”\n\nSly Stone (born Stewart) is a San Francisco psychedelic-era radio DJ turned composer, singer, and musician who revolutionized music with Sly & the Family Stone — a multi-racial, genre-blending band that shattered boundaries between Black and White audiences. With soul-rock-funk-pop crossover hits like ‘Stand!’, ‘Everyday People’, ‘Hot Fun in the Summertime’, and ‘Thank You’, the group left an indelible mark on music history. The latter track, in particular, became a widely sampled staple of 1980s and ‘90s hip-hop, as highlighted in a fast-cut segment of ‘Sly Lives!’ where producers Terry Lewis and Jimmy Jam discuss its influence on Janet Jackson’s ‘Rhythm Nation.’ That same quick-cutting, DJ-like pacing can be found in the first few minutes of ‘Ladies & Gentlemen… 50 Years of SNL Music‘ as Questlove splices and dices what seems like hundreds of live segments — from the B-52s to Olivia Rodriguez — rhythmically, in the blink of an eye.\n\nQuestlove told Billboard magazine that Sly Stone was “essentially” the first Black megastar. “Sly is basically the he embodiment of what Martin Luther King’s ‘I Have a Dream’ speech was about, like this utopian multiracial mix of Black and whites, men and women together.”\n\nPatel goes on to say that he, however, didn’t know Sly’s discography in order, but did know those Family Stone hits, as well as the decline of Sly Stone that followed – the drug addiction, the arrests, the manner in which he missed live concerts and recording dates, and allowed his career to slip away.\n\n“I knew how he tried to win back his fame, that he was a junkie and lived in a camper,” says Patel. “The challenge for me was to become fluent so as to best tell his story and use his life and work as an avatar for this larger idea: the burden of Black genius.”\n\nQuestlove told Deadline that Sly’s undoing at his own hands was “the point of this whole film about self-sabotage. But he wrote the alphabet, and we’re still writing books from that alphabet to this day.”\n\nWhen it comes to the present day, and the ‘Sly’ documentary’s take on the idea of Black genius, Questlove spoke to Black music innovators Vernon Reid, Q-Tip, Chaka Khan, André 3000, and, most particularly D’Angelo — artists whose earliest works broke down barriers of what it means to make Black music, and had issues with how to move forward with the weight of expectation put upon them.\n\n“Can you imagine Sly after having just headlined Woodstock, being on the cover of Rolling Stone, having Black and White America are both looking to you as if you just solved race relations through your music—what pressure that must have been for him?,” asks Patel. “Connecting the stories of Sly and everyone else in the film came down to Ahmir’s own experiences with fame.”",

        "fullContent": "Sign up for our email newsletter to stay up-to-date on the latest local sports news throughout Philadelphia.\n\nThe Philadelphia Phillies roaming BayCare Ballpark’s outfield grass at Phillies Spring Training should look familiar. The existing crew of Nick Castellanos (157 starts), Kyle Schwarber (5 starts), Brandon Marsh (115), Johan Rojas (103), Weston Wilson (15), and Kody Clemens (1) returns to the outfield grass in Clearwater, Florida. One new face has been added to the mix as Philly turns to Max Kepler, a 31-year-old free-agent addition from Minnesota, who spent a decade with the Twins organization. Last season, the Phillies were a top-10 outfield unit in the MLB on the way to their first N.L. East Division title since 2011.\n\nSchwarber, Marsh, and Wilson split the left-field duties at Citizens Bank Park last season. With the addition of Kepler to the mix, Phillies manager Rob Thompson has more options to mix and match the position as needed entering this season.\n\nLeft Field Platoon\n\nDespite his 1.000% fielding percentage in 41 outfield innings last year, Kyle Schwarber should focus on saving energy to demolish baseballs towards City Hall this summer. The 31-year-old slugger placed inside the top 10 in HR (38), RBIs (104), and runs scored (110). Schwarber’s 106 walks were the best in the National League, with Los Angeles Dodgers superstar Shohei Ohtani’s 81 free passes in second place.\n\nBrandon Marsh, 27, played most of last season as part of a left-field platoon. He logged 684 innings over 97 games in this position and had a .978 fielding percentage. The five errors Marsh committed in the outfield last season were tied for second-worst in the MLB. It would not be shocking to see the Phillies’ addition of Kepler to the outfield, reducing Marsh’s role slightly. Marsh must rebound from a disastrous playoff appearance with one hit in 13 plate appearances for a .077 average in the 2024 postseason.\n\nMax Kepler, 31, should see his playing time in left field, given Nick Castellanos’s stranglehold on the starting spot in right field. The MLB veteran should not be a liability risk in the outfield, bringing a .993% fielding percentage in over 1,000 MLB appearances in a decade-long career. The 6-foot-4 outfielder is a .237 career hitter with 161 HRs and 508 RBIs on 1,034 games with Minnesota. Last season, Kepler played 105 games for the Twins with a .253 batting average, 8 HRs, and 42 RBIs, featuring injury concerns down the stretch run.\n\nWeston Wilson, 30, appeared at seven of the nine positions on the baseball diamond last season, including pitcher. Left field was the preferred starting destination last season, with Wilson logging 125 error-free innings in front of Harry The K’s outdoor bar. The Milwaukee Brewers draft pick from 2016 has a .288 batting average in 104 plate appearances in the MLB.\n\nFeb 12, 2025; Clearwater, FL, USA; Members of the Philadelphia Phillies prepare to workout during spring training at Carpenter Complex. Mandatory Credit: Jonathan Dyer-Imagn Images\n\nCenterfield Duo\n\nJohan Rojas, 24, received the majority of action in centerfield for Rob Thompson last season. Over 903 innings, Rojas was excellent defensively, finishing with a 991% fielding percentage, the fifth-best among centerfielders in the National League. The 5-foot-11 speedster features a .261 batting average over two MLB seasons, proving reliable in generating sacrifice hits for the Phillies. Rojas finished third in the N.L. with eight sacrifice hits in 2024 and fourth in 2023 after six successful sacrifice attempts. The MLB postseason has been unkind to Rojas, who has a .104 batting average with 16 strikeouts over 51 plate appearances.\n\nThe combination of Marsh and Kepler will likely sub for Rojas when he needs a break. Marsh has 248 starts in center field in his MLB career, including 35 last season for Philly. Those 30+ games represent a substantial 20% of the MLB campaign. Kepler brings 127 games worth of centerfield experience to Rob Thompson’s lineup but has not had meaningful action in centerfield since 2021.\n\nRight Field Ironman\n\nNick Castellanos, 32, led the National League with 157 starts in right field last season on his way to playing every game of the MLB season last year. Castellanos has earned his everyday status from Rob Thompson by not making mistakes in the field despite a grueling workload. The 2010 Detroit Tigers draft pick finished first in RF fielding percentage in the N.L. for the third season since joining Philadelphia in 2022.\n\nIn three seasons in Philadelphia, Castellanos has a .263 batting average, 65 HRs, and 254 RBIs. Castellanos has appeared in 319 of 324 games, or 98%, for the Phillies over the last two seasons, with only five absences from the lineup. He has also been one of the more reliable run producers in the Phillies lineup in the postseason, with 6 HRs and 17 RBIs during three playoff runs in Philly.\n\nPhillies Bench Options\n\nMarsh and Wilson should find opportunities to play but are expected to spend most afternoons watching from the Citizens Bank Park dugout. Kody Clemens, 28, could also find a small role as a replacement player in the Phillies outfield during the season. Primarily an infielder, Clemens started one game in left field last season and has 72 innings of experience over three MLB seasons between Detroit and Philadelphia. Schwarber is excluded from bench options as he will find his way into the starting designated hitter spot in Thompson’s lineup card, as he did more often than not last season.\n\nMandatory Credit: Bill Streicher-USA TODAY Sports",

Managers make their decisions based on the numbers.” What better way to start a brand new Phillies season than with a new piece looking at the numbers behind Philadelphia baseball?\n\nAs Philly’s baseball team trickles into Clearwater, Florida, over the next week for the start of baseball activities, let’s take our first look at some relevant numbers that will allow you to drop some knowledge on your baseball-loving buddies this spring.\n\nPhillies By Numbers\n\n0- Days remaining until Phillies Spring Training arrives in 2025. Seriously! Despite the winter weather swirling around Philadelphia, the trucks have already arrived, and Phillies GM Dave Dombrowski has held a press conference to provide some new nuggets of information. For those who don’t have time to watch it, PSN’s Cory Nidoh broke it all down for you!\n\n1- Phillies rookies to hit for the cycle: Weston Wilson last August against Washington. It was the 10th cycle in Phillies history. Wilson smacked a triple off the wall in right in the 4th before a pop-up single landed him on first base later in that same inning. The cycle watch was on after Wilson blasted a 7th-inning home run. Wilson’s name was etched in the history books in the 8th inning as he connected with a double, sending the home crowd into a frenzy as he strolled into second base.\n\n2- Games Against the N.L. East during Grapefruit League action—both are against Atlanta. The Phillies were 6-7 last season against the Atlanta Braves, with a 4-3 home record in Philadelphia and a 2-4 visiting record in Georgia.\n\n4- Number of Phillies to claim MLB’s National League Rookie-of-the-Year Award. Jack Sanford claimed the first one in franchise history in 1957, followed by Richie “Dick” Allen a few seasons later in 1964. Three more decades passed before Scott Rolen’s award-winning campaign in 1997. Ryan Howard’s 22 HR and 63 RBI during the 2005 season claimed the franchise’s most recent breakout rookie trophy.\n\nFeb 12, 2025; Clearwater, FL, USA; Philadelphia Phillies special instructor Cole Hamels looks on during a spring training workout at Carpenter Complex Mandatory Credit: Jonathan Dyer-Imagn Images\n\n15- Number worn by new Hall of Famer Dick Allen over his 9-year Phillies career. Allen played 1,070 games in a Phillies uniform with a .290 batting average, 204 HRs, and 655 RBIs. In his 1964 rookie campaign, he led the National League in runs scored (125) and total bases (352) for the season. Despite a batting average above .300, Allen unceremoniously led the N.L. in strikeouts during his first two seasons in the majors—138 in 1964 and 150 in 1965.\n\n31- The number of games the Phillies play during spring training. The Toronto Blue Jays and the New York Yankees are tied for most games against Philadelphia at five games each. The Boston Red Sox and the Braves have two scheduled appearances against the Phillies this spring.\n\n79- Number of times Philadelphia’s MLB club has held spring training in Clearwater. According to MLB’s Todd Zolecki, the Phillies trained in ten different states between 1900 and 1946 before settling in South Florida. Philadelphia first appeared in Clearwater in 1947 when it signed a 10-year contract and promised to add an expensive sprinkler system at Athletic Field. The city would pay the team back for most of the purchase price over the next decade.\n\n95- Total wins for the Phillies last season. Philly was 95-67, including a 54-27 home record at Citizens Bank Park. As a road squad last season, the Phillies played one game over .500 baseball with a 41-40 record. Of course, we all know what happened in the postseason, so no need to go any further there.\n\n224- Number of MLB strikeout victims by Zach Wheeler in 2024. He was tied for second overall in the National League with San Deigo’s Dylan Cease (224). Both pitchers finished behind Atlanta’s Chris Sale (225) in the N.L. punchout competition. Detroit Tigers All-Star Tarik Skubal led the MLB with 228 strikeouts in 2024.\n\nFeb 12, 2025; Clearwater, FL, USA; Philadelphia Phillies pitcher Aaron Nola (27) warms up during a spring training workout at Carpenter Complex. Mandatory Credit: Jonathan Dyer-Imagn Images\n\n800- Approximate weight (in pounds) of the 2,400 baseballs that traveled to spring training with the Phillies. The weight is equivalent to that of a grown grizzly bear. While it seems silly to suggest every one of the spherical objects will see game day action, that math works out to 150 baseballs per game for each of the 16 home dates at BayCare Park this spring.\n\n1,058- Miles (approximately) between Citizens Bank Park in Pennsylvania and BayCare Park in Florida. According to Google’s highly scientific calculations, it takes between 15-16 hours to drive from Philadelphia, PA, to Clearwater, FL. While it is possible to take a train ride down the East Coast, be prepared to book almost a full day in your travel itinerary for the ride. Of course, air travel provides the quickest path to Florida, with a flight time of between two to three hours.\n\n10,000- Number of paper cups the Phillies loaded onto trucks for spring training. Spring Training is scheduled to last for 31 days, which gives the Phillies equipment staff an average of 322 paper cups per day before they begin to worry about a Spring Training shortage, not accounting for scheduled off days.\n\nMandatory Credit: Jonathan Dyer-Imagn Images",

During this fan event, Smith briefly addressed the media, reflecting on the Eagles‘ recent victory in Super Bowl LIX, the many fans in attendance to see him, and more.\n\nOne thing you quickly learn about Smith when speaking with him is that he is a man of few words who prefers to let his actions speak for him. While Smith isn’t your typical boisterous star wide receiver, he let some media members in on his thoughts since the Super Bowl.\n\nFootball – NFL – Super Bowl LIX – Philadelphia Eagles v Kansas City Chiefs – Caesars Superdome, New Orleans, Louisiana, United States – February 9, 2025 Philadelphia Eagles’ DeVonta Smith celebrates scoring a touchdown with teammates REUTERS/Brian Snyder\n\nWhen asked about his expectations for the parade, which was set to begin in less than 24 hours, Smith expressed that he was “worried about the cold more than anything,” with a joking but sincere grin.\n\nFlashing back to the game, Smith was asked about his emotions and state of mind during the game in New Orleans. For the Amite City native, it was a homecoming of sorts.\n\n“I think it was just being back at home,” Smith reflected. “[I’m] very familiar with that building, played two state championships in it, being home in front of the family, I think that was it more so that than anything.”\n\nFeb 9, 2025; New Orleans, LA, USA; Philadelphia Eagles wide receiver DeVonta Smith (6) makes a catch for a touchdown against Kansas City Chiefs cornerback Jaylen Watson (35) during the second half of Super Bowl LIX at Caesars Superdome. Mandatory Credit: Geoff Burke-Imagn Images\n\nIt was truly special for DeVonta Smith, one of the most decorated active football players. Smith added a Super Bowl to his resume, which already included a state championship appearance, two college football championships at Alabama, a Heisman trophy, and much more. Among Smith’s many accolades is his record of the most playoff receiving yards in Philadelphia Eagles history (595 yards).\n\nWhen asked by Philly Sports Network what the future held for Smith and his Eagles, he simply replied with a single, powerful statement: “Try to repeat it.”\n\nIt’s clear that while Smith had plans to enjoy this victory, next season is already on his mind.\n\nFootball – NFL – Super Bowl LIX – Philadelphia Eagles v Kansas City Chiefs – Caesars Superdome, New Orleans, Louisiana, United States – February 9, 2025 Philadelphia Eagles’ A.J.

However, on the biggest stage, Smith continued to prove his doubters wrong, coming up large in the biggest moments on the biggest stage.\n\nIn parting, Smith addressed the next generation, specifically those who, like him, have been doubted because of their size.\n\nPhiladelphia Eagles’ star wide receiver DeVonta Smith takes a photo with a fan at an autograph signing at the Dick’s Sporting Goods in Deptford, New Jersey.\n\n“Trust your training.

        "fullContent": "article\n\nThe Brief States that implemented abortion bans had higher infant mortality rates. A new study finds that the infant mortality rate for births connected to the abortion ban were higher than expected. Rates of births and deaths were evaluated using data between 2012 and 2013 before abortion restrictions took effect.\n\n\n\nA new study reveals that states with abortion bans experienced an increase in infant mortality rates.\n\nThe study published in the medical journal JAMA noted that in 14 states that implemented complete or 6-week abortion bans after the Supreme Court Dobbs decision revoked the federal right to abortion, the fertility rate increased 1.7%, leading to roughly 1 additional birth for every 1,000 women of reproductive age.\n\nRELATED: Abortion laws by state\n\nBy the numbers:\n\nThe study also found that with roughly 500 deaths than expected among nearly 22,000 additional births, the infant mortality rate for births linked to abortion bans – 24 deaths for every 1,000 births – was approximately four times higher than projected.\n\nThe estimated increases in infant mortality were larger for deaths based on congenital causes and among groups that had higher than average infant mortality rates at baseline, including Black infants and those in southern states.\n\nHow was data gathered for the study?\n\nResearchers used study data that included biannual counts of neonatal and infant deaths, and the corresponding total number of live births, from birth and death certificate data compiled by the National Center for Health Statistics for all 50 US states and the District of Columbia from January 2012 through December 2023.\n\nThe study noted that biannual counts of infant deaths and live births were separately pulled for four racial and ethnic groups (racial and ethnic data were acquired from the death certificate, which is identified by the next of kin, coroner, or other person who certified the death) for each state over the same period.\n\nRELATED: Survey: 3 in 4 reproductive age women in the US think abortion should be legal\n\nThe primary outcome was the infant mortality rate, calculated as the number of infant deaths per 1000 live births in each biannual period for each state over 12 years. Mortality rates were calculated overall and by race and ethnicity, timing of death and cause of death.\n\nThis study found that states that banned abortion had infant mortality rates higher than would have been expected without such bans. The largest estimated changes were observed among southern states and Black infants.\n\nWhat did researchers conclude in the study?\n\nResearchers noted that their analysis found an estimated increase of 0.33 infant deaths per 1000 live births above expected in states that banned abortion.\n\nWhat they're saying:\n\nThe team shared that the results are consistent with clinician and media reports documenting denial of terminations for nonviable pregnancies, forcing pregnant women to overcome significant barriers to receive timely abortion care out of state or carry the pregnancy to term.\n\n\n\nAccording to the study, the increase in infant mortality rate due to noncongenital causes is less straightforward and needs more investigation.\n\nMoreover, researchers explained that the study provides new evidence that infant deaths were higher than expected in states that enforced abortion bans after the bans were implemented.",

While the order is unlikely to have a significant national effect, as most schools and colleges have already dropped their vaccine requirements, it threatens to withhold federal funding from institutions still enforcing COVID-19 vaccine mandates.\n\n\n\nPresident Donald Trump signed an executive order on Friday which directs the Education Department and Health and Human Services to create a plan to end vaccine mandates for COVID-19.\n\nThe order aims to fulfill a campaign promise from Trump, who often said he would \"not give one penny to any school that has a vaccine mandate.\"\n\nTrump says COVID-19 mandates in school infrige on ‘personal freedom’\n\nWhat they're saying:\n\n\"Given the incredibly low risk of serious COVID-19 illness for children and young adults, threatening to shut them out of an education is an intolerable infringement on personal freedom,\" the order said.\n\nDig deeper:\n\nThe order is expected to have little national impact because COVID-19 vaccine mandates have mostly been dropped at schools and colleges across the United States, and many states have passed legislation forbidding such mandates.\n\nFILE: Doctor with COVID-19 vaccine.

A few continue to require vaccines at least for students living on campus, including Swarthmore and Oberlin colleges. Most of those colleges allow medical or religious exemptions.\n\nSchools requiring vaccine at risk of losing federal funding\n\nThe order also said schools, colleges and states that require students to be immunized against COVID-19 may be at risk of losing federal funding.\n\nThe order didn't identify specific sources of money that could be at risk.

CEO Steve Huffman said paid subreddits are \"coming\" and currently \"in the works.\" Reddit has had trouble generating profit and went public last March.\n\n\n\nA new feature is expected to roll out on Reddit later this year that could put some content behind a paywall.\n\nReddit’s co-founder and CEO Steve Huffman spoke more on the idea of paid subreddits in a recent company Ask Me Anything (AMA).\n\nHere’s what to know:\n\nWhat is Reddit?\n\nThe backstory:\n\nReddit is a technology and social network company that was founded more than 20 years ago. It is a sought-after space for internet discussions of any topic within communities, also known as subreddits.\n\nReddit has more than 100 million daily active users, Huffman said last week , who visit the site to discuss a range of topics from silly memes to existential worries, as well as to get recommendations from like-minded people.\n\nDespite its popularity, Reddit has had trouble turning profit since it was founded in 2005. It’s been looking for ways to boost revenue, and went public in March of last year.\n\nBy the numbers:\n\nBy tech industry’s standards though, Reddit remains small for a company that has been around since 2005.\n\nLast year, Reddit’s annual revenue generation was just below $1 billion. For comparison, Meta boasts an annual revenue of $135 billion.\n\nMeta had a market value of more than $1.2 trillion in 2024. Reddit’s market value was priced at $6.4 billion when it went public last March.\n\nRELATED: TikTok returns to Apple, Google app stores after temporary removal\n\nPaid subreddits\n\nWhat we know:\n\nHuffman has talked about the idea of paid subreddits before, and mentioned that when asked about it again in a recent AMA alongside Chief Operating Officer Jen Wong and Chief Financial Officer Drew Volleror.\n\n\"That one’s coming. We’re working on it as we speak,\" Hoffman said.\n\nA paid subreddit would put a paywall, of sorts, around designated content, meaning that only members who pay could access that subreddit, or \"community,\" and see its content.\n\nWhat we don't know:\n\nHoffman didn’t elaborate on the timeline users can expect for the paid subreddits.\n\nHe also didn’t indicate how much users could expect to pay for some content, or if the amount would be fixed by Reddit or perhaps set by the creator.\n\nRELATED: Facebook fact-checking to be replaced with X-style community notes\n\nWhat's next:\n\nHoffman spoke on some other new key features that Reddit users can expect for 2025:\n\nPaid subreddits\n\nImproved search results\n\nReddit Answers, which uses AI to summarize search results from Reddit’s user base\n\nLaying the foundation for an eventual marketplace",

Two sources familiar with the plans told The Associated Press that cuts could come as soon as this week.

The program deadline was Feb. 6, and administration officials said employees who accept will be able to stop working while still collecting a paycheck until Sept. 30.\n\nRELATED: Federal worker buyout deadline: What we know about the deferred resignation program\n\nFILE - The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) building in Washington, DC, US, on Tuesday, Dec. 31, 2024. Photographer: Samuel Corum/Bloomberg via Getty Images\n\nWhat we know:\n\nThe Associated Press reported that IRS employees involved in the 2025 tax season were told they will not be allowed to accept a buyout offer from the Trump administration until after the taxpayer filing deadline, according to a letter sent recently to IRS employees.\n\nWhat we don't know:\n\nIt is unclear how many IRS workers will be impacted by the layoff announcement plan.\n\nIt’s also unclear how the layoffs would affect IRS processings, such as the disbursement of tax refunds.\n\nBig picture view:\n\nJan. 27 was the official start date of the 2025 tax season, and the IRS expects more than 140 million tax returns to be filed by the April 15 deadline.\n\nRELATED: Where's my refund? How to track your IRS tax return\n\nIRS funding\n\nThe other side:\n\nThe Biden administration invested heavily - $80 billion - in the IRS, which included plans to hire tens of thousands of new employees to help with customer service and enforcement as well as new technology to update the tax collection agency.\n\nRepublicans have been successful at clawing back that money.\n\nFederal government employees\n\nBy the numbers:\n\nThe civilian federal workforce, not including military personnel and postal workers, comprises about 2.4 million people.\n\nWhile a chunk of federal workers, about 20%, are in Washington, D.C., and the neighboring states of Maryland and Virginia, more than 80% are distributed outside the region.\n\nTrump’s buyout offer has already been accepted by about 65,000 employees, FOX News reported .",

Fans converged on the Benjamin Franklin Parkway from all over, arriving by train, plane and automobile just for the once-in-a-lifetime experience of celebrating the Eagles.\n\n\n\nWith an estimated 1 million plus fans heading into Philadelphia for the Eagles victory parade celebrating the team’s Super Bowl win, many didn’t want the day to end.\n\nBut, by train, plane and automobile, fans made the trek back home from the City of Brotherly Love.\n\nAnd, for some, that trip home on the rails involved waiting in some long lines.\n\nWhat they're saying:\n\nA lot of fans heading home from the Philadelphia Eagles victory parade had anxiety about hopping on public transportation to get to or from the festivities, but at the Paoli Station, there were nothing but good feelings about the experience.\n\nCarrie Rife, from Devon, said, \"No hiccups today at all. Like that is unheard of sometimes in these massive crowds. So, we would repeat it again, for sure!\"\n\nA family from Wyoming had zero complaints getting to and from the city.\n\nRelated article\n\n\"We thought it was smooth, really. I mean of course, the amount of people, yes there was waiting coming back, but that’s nothing. It’s really not that all,\" Brian Belmont stated, followed by Brady Belmonte, who added, \"Oh I thought it went pretty well. It was pretty organized. Not too bad, definitely a change from what we deal with every day.\"\n\nDig deeper:\n\nThe lines were long, unless you found a loophole.\n\nMelissa Guillen, from Berwyn, explained, \"You would turn a corner and you’re like no way could it keep going further and it kept going further. It was insane.\"\n\nFOX 29’s Ellen Kolodziej asked, \"So, you’re telling me you snuck in line?\"\n\n\"No!\" Melissa laughed. \"We saw our friends!\"\n\nBig picture view:\n\nOf course people had to wait. But, they passed the time by making new friends and lifelong memories.\n\n\"It was like a good hour, or two, for us, but if you just sit there, it was probably like a five, four hour wait,\" Maui Morris said.\n\n\"But was it worth it?\" Kolodziej asked.\n\n\"It was, it really was. You say Go Birds! I’ll do anything for my city. I’d do it again in a heartbeat!\"\n\nThe overall theme:\n\nSo, that was the main theme – people had to wait to get on the train or the El or the bus, but they would do it again. Kudos to SEPTA and Amtrak for making it a smooth ride for most people to and from the parade.",

        "fullContent": "The Brief Recent polling shows that Americans are largely contradictory when it comes to the federal budget. They think the government should spend more on key issues and programs – but less overall.\n\n\n\nAs President Donald Trump and Elon Musk push for extensive cuts to the federal budget, recent polling suggests Americans may not be on board with slashing education and humanitarian aid spending.\n\nAccording to polls from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research, U.S adults mostly think the government isn't spending enough on key issues and programs. But conversely – and the biggest challenge for lawmakers – Americans are broadly in favor of cuts to the federal budget.\n\nRELATED: DOGE subcommittee meeting holds 1st hearing focusing on 'war on waste'\n\nWhat do Americans think about government spending?\n\nWhat they're saying:\n\nAbout two-thirds of Americans say the U.S. government is spending \"too little\" on Social Security and education, according to a January AP-NORC poll. Another 6 in 10, roughly, say too little money is going to assistance to the poor. A similar share say spending is too low for Medicare, the national health care insurance program for seniors, and most also say Medicaid is under-funded by the federal government.\n\nRELATED: 75,000 federal workers take buyout after judge approves Trump’s downsizing plan\n\nAbout one-third of U.S. adults say the federal government is spending \"too much\" on the military. About one-third say the military is getting \"too little\" funding, and another one-third say it takes in \"about the right amount.\" But most Republicans say the military is underfunded, while slightly less than half of Democrats say it's getting too much money.\n\nFILE - The US Capitol is seen at sunrise on September 30, 2023 in Washington, DC. (Photo by Nathan Howard/Getty Images) Expand\n\nForeign aid is one area where there is broad consensus that the U.S. is overspending. The 2023 AP-NORC polling suggests that Americans tend to believe too much money is going to other countries.\n\nRoughly 7 in 10 U.S. adults said the government was putting too much money toward \"assistance to other countries.\" About 9 in 10 Republicans and just over half of Democrats agreed that the country was overspending on foreign aid at the time. But polling has also shown that U.S. adults tend to overestimate the share of the federal budget that is spent on foreign aid.\n\nWhat is the government actually spending?\n\nForeign aid spending\n\nBy the numbers:\n\nSurveys from KFF have found that, on average, Americans say spending on foreign aid makes up 31% of the federal budget rather than the actual answer: closer to 1% or less.\n\nSocial Security spending\n\nAccording to the nonpartisan Center on Budget Policies and Priorities (CBPP), in 2024, 21% of the budget, or $1.5 trillion, was spent on Social Security, providing monthly retirement benefits averaging $1,922 to 51.5 million retired workers. Social Security also paid benefits to 2.6 million spouses and children of retired workers, 5.8 million surviving children and spouses of deceased workers, and 8.4 million disabled workers and their eligible dependents.\n\nMedicare, Medicaid, CHIP and ACA spending\n\nFour health insurance programs — Medicare, Medicaid, the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP), and Affordable Care Act (ACA) marketplace health insurance subsidies — comprised a combined 24% of the 2024 federal budget, or $1.7 trillion. More than half – or $912 billion – went to Medicare, which provided health coverage to around 67 million people who are 65 or older or have disabilities.\n\nThe rest was spent on Medicaid and CHIP ($626 billion) and ACA subsidy and marketplace costs ($125 billion). Both Medicaid and CHIP require states to pay some of their total costs, according to the CBPP.\n\nDefense spending\n\nNational defense made up 13 percent of the budget, or $872 billion.\n\nRELATED: Coast Guard Commandant terminated over border lapses, recruitment, DEI focus: official\n\n\"About 95 percent of the spending in this category reflects the underlying costs of the Defense Department, largely for operations and maintenance; military personnel; procurement of weapons; and research, development, testing, and evaluation,\" the CBPP says.\n\nEducation spending\n\nIn 2024, the federal government spent about 5% of its total budget on education. This includes elementary, secondary, and vocational education; higher education; and research and general educational aids",

His presence highlights NASCAR's conservative-leaning fan base and his broader effort to align with American sports culture. Drivers, including Chase Elliott, acknowledge the significance of a president attending the event: \"It certainly brings a lot of eyes.\"\n\n\n\nPresident Donald Trump attended the Daytona 500 on Sunday, marking his second appearance at NASCAR’s most prestigious race as president.\n\nSpirit of NASCAR will 'fuel America's Golden Age'\n\nWhat we know:\n\nPresident Trump is back in Daytona Beach for The Great American Race. It's the second appearance at the race as president. His first visit was in 2020 while running for reelection. That year, he served as grand marshal, delivering the command for drivers to start their engines and making a dramatic entrance with an Air Force One flyover.\n\nFor this trip, Air Force One departed from Palm Beach International Airport shortly after noon, carrying Trump, his son Eric, grandson Luke, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy, Interior Secretary Doug Burgum and his wife, Kathryn. Several members of Congress were also accompanying him, according to the White House.\n\nTrump also thrilled NASCAR fans in the stands with another Air Force One flyover before he rode in the presidential limousine onto the Daytona International Speedway.\n\nTrump has made a point of attending major sporting events, having recently become the first sitting president to attend a Super Bowl. His presence at college football games and UFC fights, along with his well-documented passion for golf, further underscores his efforts to align himself with sports culture.\n\nWhat we don't know:\n\nIt remained unclear whether Trump had any official role at the Daytona 500 this year, as he did in 2020 when he was grand marshal. The extent of his involvement in pre-race ceremonies or interactions with drivers has not been disclosed.\n\nThe backstory:\n\nTrump’s relationship with NASCAR extends beyond his appearances at the Daytona 500. In 2018, while in the White House, he honored NASCAR Cup Series champion Martin Truex Jr. and Furniture Row Racing. More recently, in May of last year, he attended the Coca-Cola 600 at Charlotte Motor Speedway, a major race in the swing state of North Carolina, as a former president and reelection candidate.\n\nTrump has often spoken about his admiration for the sport and its fans, praising the courage of drivers and the patriotic spirit of NASCAR events. His presence at Daytona aligns with his broader strategy of cultivating support among sports audiences.\n\nBig picture view:\n\nTrump’s appearance at the Daytona 500 reinforces his ongoing effort to maintain visibility among sports fans, particularly those in key political battlegrounds. With NASCAR’s fan base traditionally seen as conservative-leaning, his presence at the event could bolster his appeal among a segment of voters who value his brand of patriotism and showmanship.\n\nHis attendance follows a recent pattern of high-profile sports event visits, including last weekend’s Super Bowl. These appearances, coupled with his history of engaging with NASCAR and other sports leagues, reflect a continued strategy of associating himself with American sports culture.\n\nImage 1 of 9 ▼ DAYTONA BEACH, FLORIDA - FEBRUARY 16: Air Force One is seen for U.S. President Donald Trump's visit to the NASCAR Cup Series Daytona 500 at Daytona International Speedway on February 16, 2025 in Daytona Beach, Florida. (Photo by Mike Ehrmann/Getty Images)\n\nWhat they're saying:\n\nDuring a 2020 interview with Fox News, Trump spoke about his admiration for NASCAR and the Daytona 500, calling it a \"legendary display of roaring engines, soaring spirits and the American skill, speed and power that we’ve been hearing about for so many years.\"\n\n\"The tens of thousands of patriots here today have come for the fast cars and the world-class motorsports,\" Trump said at the time. \"But NASCAR fans never forget that no matter who wins the race, what matters most is God, family and country.\"\n\nChase Elliott, a NASCAR driver, acknowledged the significance of having a sitting president attend the Daytona 500. \"One of our biggest days of the year is special,\" he said. \"It certainly brings a lot of eyes and a different perspective to what we do down here for this race.\"\n\nDaytona 500: What to know:\n\nThe Daytona 500 race is held on Sunday, Feb. 16, at Daytona International Speedway in Daytona Beach, Florida. The race started at 1:30 p.m. (It was moved up an hour due to the potential for weather on Sunday afternoon).\n\nHow can I watch the Daytona 500?\n\nThe Daytona 500 airs on FOX and FOX 35 Orlando. The race started at 1:30 p.m. (It was moved up an hour due to the potential for weather on Sunday afternoon).\n\nWatch on TV or stream on FOX Local. FOX will then jump in with pre-race coverage of its own on TV.\n\nHow long is the race?\n\nThe Daytona 500 is a 500-mile race. Daytona International Speedway is a 2.5-mile track, which means it takes 200 laps to hit the 500-mile milestone.\n\nDaytona 500 Forecast: Is it going to rain?\n\nIt will be a warm and windy day in Central Florida, especially up the Interstate 4 corridor. Wind gusts are expected to be between 35-40 mph.

        "fullContent": "The Brief A Gallup poll found that 45% of Democrats want their party to be more moderate, an 11-point increase since 2021. Meanwhile, 43% of Republicans prefer their party's current ideology, with fewer calling for a more conservative shift. The results come after Donald Trump’s inauguration for his second term as president and Republican control of Congress.\n\n\n\nAfter losing the presidency and Senate in the 2024 election, an increasing number of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents say they want their party to become more moderate rather than maintain its current liberal stance.\n\nA Gallup poll, published last month, found that 45% of Democrats now favor a moderate shift, up from 34% in 2021. Meanwhile, 29% of Democrats still want their party to move in a more liberal direction, a five-point drop from 2021.\n\nAt the same time, Republicans are largely satisfied with their party's ideology under Trump, with 43% of GOP voters saying the party should stay the same. Only 28% want the party to become more conservative, a significant drop from 40% in 2021.\n\nWhat’s behind the shift?\n\nThe backstory:\n\nOne factor that may be influencing Democrats' preference for moderation is the party’s recent electoral losses. Following the 2024 election, Republicans took control of both the presidency and Senate, while maintaining a slim majority in the House of Representatives.\n\nFILE - Democratic leaders, including Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer, gather for a press conference at the U.S. Capitol. (Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)\n\nIn contrast, Republican satisfaction with their party's ideology may be a reflection of their support for Trump and the conservative policies his administration has begun enacting.\n\nHow views differ within each party\n\nBy the numbers:\n\nGallup's findings also reveal ideological divisions within both parties:\n\nLiberal Democrats (49% of Democrats overall) mostly want the party to be more liberal (45%) or remain the same (22%).\n\nModerate Democrats (43% of Democrats) overwhelmingly prefer a shift to the center (62%).\n\nConservative Republicans (two-thirds of GOP voters) are split: 45% favor the status quo, while 38% want a more conservative GOP.\n\nModerate Republicans are more likely to favor a centrist shift (50%), rather than staying the same (36%).\n\nThese divisions suggest that while moderate Democrats increasingly want their party to move to the center, moderate Republicans are somewhat less eager for change.\n\nWhat this means for the future\n\nThe Democratic Party's shift toward moderation could influence its strategy heading into the 2026 midterms. The party may seek to regain voter support by focusing on more centrist policies and appealing to swing voters.\n\nMeanwhile, the Republican Party appears to be more united in its current direction, with Trump maintaining strong support among GOP voters.\n\nAs both parties look ahead to future elections, their ideological shifts could play a key role in shaping the political landscape for years to come.",

        "fullContent": "The Brief A West Chester man is behind bars after he was said to have led Delaware State Police in a pursuit that spanned at least 45 miles across the state. The pursuit was said to have started with New Castle County Police who attempted to pull him over, due to him driving a car with a bare rim. After driving at least an hour, he crashed into a utility pole in a southern Delaware town, and attempted to run, but was caught by troopers.\n\n\n\nA West Chester man led Delaware State Police on a pursuit that stretched across a majority of the state, crossing through many jurisdictions, covering at least 45 miles, before crashing, attempting to run, but ultimately caught by troopers.\n\nThe chase began after New Castle County Police tried to pull him over due to a bare rim on the car he was driving.\n\nWhat we know:\n\nFriday afternoon, about 12:45, officials with Delaware State Police said troopers were contacted, saying New Castle County Police were pursuing a man driving a BMW with a Pennsylvania tag and driving on a bare rim.\n\nTroopers joined the pursuit after the driver, later identified as 22-year-old West Chester resident Thomas Casey, was seen heading south into Middletown, Delaware, on State Route 1.\n\nTimeline:\n\nAs the chase continued, parts of the BMW began to disengage from the vehicle, hurtling into the air. An unidentified metal object struck the hood of a DSP vehicle, tearing into the hood.\n\nNext, the metal brake caliper separated from the car and crashed into the windshield of a different DSP vehicle, almost hitting the trooper inside.\n\nAs they approached Dover, officials say Casey began to speed up. About 12 miles south of Dover, a trooper tried to lay down traffic spikes, Casey saw them in enough time to swerve, nearly hitting the trooper standing there. The trooper ran out of the way of the vehicle to avoid being hit.\n\nAnother attempt at traffic spikes was made a short time later, but with the same results, as Casey swerved towards the trooper, who also had to jump out of the way to avoid being hit.\n\nDig deeper:\n\nCasey then merged onto Exit 86 toward Frederica, and as he did so, he hit a traffic sign and crashed into a utility pole in front of a local store.\n\nHe jumped out of the disabled vehicle and tried to make a run for it, but troopers grabbed him before he could elude them.\n\nHe then resisted, officials said, causing minor injuries to the troopers.\n\nBig picture view:\n\nOfficials said the troopers noticed Casey showed continued signs of impairment.\n\nHe was taken to a nearby barracks and a legal blood test was performed.\n\nCasey was then charged with assault, reckless endanger, resisting arrest with force, driving under the influence of a drug and other related offenses.\n\nHe is being held at the Sussex Correctional Institution on a $50,877 cash bond.",
