        "title": "Dan Bongino's yearslong history of FBI criticism and conspiracy theories",
        "source": "https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/",
        "content": "Dan Bongino, the conservative podcaster named deputy director of the FBI, has spent the past seven years publicly criticizing the agency he will now help run, pushing conspiracy theories about corrupt FBI leadership and agents who were out to get President Donald Trump.\n\nA survey of Bongino’s podcast transcripts by NBC News from 2017 to 2025 found that he made the FBI a regular target on his show, routinely claiming that the bureau colluded with the so-called deep state, an alleged shadowy network of entrenched federal and military operatives. Those themes figured heavily on “The Dan Bongino Show,” a syndicated radio show and daily podcast that is among the most popular in the U.S.\n\nAlong the way, Bongino has gone from a relatively unknown conservative pundit to one of the most followed and recognizable pro-Trump voices in all of media, commanding an audience of millions across various platforms.\n\n“The FBI has totally and completely failed America,” Bongino said in a June 2024 episode of his podcast, a sentiment typical of his attacks on the bureau. “It kills me to have to tell you that you can’t trust these people, you cannot.”\n\nGet top local stories in Philly delivered to you every morning. Sign up for NBC Philadelphia's News Headlines newsletter.\n\nBongino has also espoused an extreme view on the law and power, saying in May 2024: “Power. That is all that matters,” as part of a critique of the Biden administration’s effort to forgive student loans before going on to laugh at the idea of checks and balances in the government. “That’s a good one. That’s really funny.”\n\nThe FBI declined to comment. Bongino addressed his critics Monday on his podcast, appearing to strike a slightly more leveled tone while still implying that the FBI had been corrupted.\n\n“I get it, if you are a political opponent of mine that has been involved with proudly celebrating a weaponized justice system, how you don’t understand how a guy like me who discusses partisan content in an opinion show and go and do (an) unquestionably nonpartisan job,” he said. “I’m going to ask you a simple question. Have you seen what I did before I came here?”\n\nHe continued: “I’m committed to service. People play different roles in their lives. People are dads, people are soccer coaches. People are cops and military officers and military enlisted people. People are carpenters, people are plumbers. We play different roles in our life, and each one requires a different skill set.”\n\nThe deputy director is second-in-command of the FBI, and the job has traditionally been filled by a career agent who manages daily operations across the bureau’s 55 field offices. The job, like other comparable posts, does not require approval from the Senate.\n\nBut neither Bongino nor FBI Director Kash Patel have ever served in the agency they will now lead, and their public criticism of the FBI and embrace of misinformation and partisanship is raising questions about how they will run the FBI, even as they insist they are going to wipe the agency clean of politics.\n\nDuring a joint news conference on Monday, French President Emmanuel Macron interrupted President Donald Trump to clarify, “We provided real money.”\n\nOn Bongino’s podcast from May 2017 through Monday, there were more than 21,000 mentions of “FBI” or “deep state,” according to data from the KnowledgeFight podcast database. Mentions peaked in June 2023, the month Trump was indicted for obstruction and other crimes after federal officials accused him of hoarding classified documents. The case was dismissed after Trump won the 2024 election.\n\nBongino wasn’t always critical of the bureau; in episodes from early 2017 and before, he maintained a fairly deferential tone. But in the later months of that year, things shifted.\n\nHe started discussing conspiracy theories that the Obama administration had illegally spied on Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign with the FBI, despite a lack of evidence.\n\nAnd by the end of Trump’s first year in office, Bongino had come to a revelation, he said, claiming in a Dec. 14, 2017 episode that he believed that FBI leadership had interfered in the U.S. election by collecting information about Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign in an attempt to rig the election for Democrat Hillary Clinton. At the time, the FBI was, in fact, heavily criticized for releasing information about Clinton’s use of a private email server for official public communications.\n\nHe’s also been one of the loudest supporters of unfounded claims that the 2020 election was stolen, railing often about what he said was a coordinated effort from Democratic politicians and groups to manipulate social media, voting laws, poll workers and vote-by-mail to throw the election to Democrat Joe Biden.\n\nBiden won in 2020; there was no widespread voter fraud, according to members of Trump’s own administration. But Bongino warned that without addressing these alleged injustices, the same “cabal” would interfere in the 2024 election.\n\nRoy Rochlin/Getty Images Roy Rochlin/Getty Images\n\nBongino’s criticism of the FBI initially focused on top officials who he claimed were partisan. But after the FBI obtained a search warrant to recover classified documents from Trump’s Mar-a-Lago home, Bongino called for larger-scale firings at the agency: “Every person involved in this has to be fired immediately,” he said in an August 2022 Fox & Friends interview. “And then when the left starts whining in the media, fire 100 more the next day. Do not even let them breathe, everyone has to go, you do not even live in a constitutional republic anymore, and there is no fixing this, there is only rebuilding it.”\n\n“I’ll say for the 10th or 20th time this week, this is why the FBI must be disbanded,” Bongino said on a September 2022 episode. “You understand this is going to get worse, you’re not going to fix this. The organization needs to be disbanded.”\n\nBongino escalated his attacks on the FBI in 2023, characterizing the agency as a “clear and present danger” to the United States. Bongino accused the FBI of systemic corruption, alleging that it colluded with foreign governments, spread disinformation, suppressed information related to Biden’s son Hunter Biden and interfered in elections.\n\nHe frequently targeted then-FBI Director Christopher Wray, calling his leadership an embarrassment and suggesting that the agency had become a tool for political oppression. Bongino also claimed that the FBI actively suppressed information about COVID-19, violated the First Amendment and targeted Donald Trump and conservatives.\n\nBongino continued to make the call to disband the FBI through 2024.\n\nIt’s not entirely clear how Bongino entered the running for the deputy director position.\n\nHe does have law enforcement experience, having served in the U.S. Secret Service, on details for Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama. He was also in the New York Police Department.\n\nSince then, he’s been in Trump’s orbit as a conservative commentator. He worked on Fox News from 2021 through 2023, and was chosen to host a radio show in the same time slot as Rush Limbaugh after his 2021 death.\n\nBongino will be one of nearly two-dozen former Fox News personalities in Trump’s administration, a list that includes Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy and Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard. Trump similarly staffed his first administration with several of the network’s employees.\n\nIn July, conservative-leaning publication The Daily Signal published a YouTube interview with Bongino in which he said he would be open to leading the FBI “if President Trump called.”\n\nIn November 2024, shortly after Trump’s election, Bongino began lobbying on Patel’s behalf to his listeners, urging them to share positive endorsements for Patel’s FBI director nomination on social media.\n\n“Folks, we need Kash Patel at FBI. As far as I’m concerned right now, he is the only guy who knows where the bodies are buried and go in there and clean that mess up, we got to get Kash,” Bongino said in a Nov. 19 episode of his podcast. Since the election, he has brought up Patel in at least 40 separate episodes.\n\nTo take the position at the FBI, Bongino has to give up his microphone. Trump said in his announcement that Bongino was “willing and prepared.”\n\n“Great news for Law Enforcement and American Justice!” Trump said in a social media post announcing the appointment.\n\nThis article first appeared on NBCNews.com.

        "content": "Current and former FBI officials expressed shock and dismay Monday over the news that President Donald Trump had selected a right-wing podcaster and ardent FBI critic to be the bureau’s deputy director, even as the man picked for the job said he was ready to put partisanship aside.\n\nOn his podcast, former Secret Service agent Dan Bongino — who once called the FBI “irredeemably corrupt”— thanked the president for the appointment and suggested that he was prepared to step out of his role as a MAGA warrior. But even as he did so, he repeated the baseless charge that the Justice Department had been “weaponized,” a claim he has frequently brandished to criticize the agency he will now help lead.\n\n“I get it, if you are a political opponent of mine that has been involved with proudly celebrating a weaponized justice system, how you don’t understand how a guy like me who discusses partisan content in an opinion show and go and do (an) unquestionably nonpartisan job,” he said. “I’m going to ask you a simple question.

We play different roles in our life, and each one requires a different skill set.”\n\nGet top local stories in Philly delivered to you every morning. Sign up for NBC Philadelphia's News Headlines newsletter.\n\nBongino’s conciliatory words did little to reassure skeptics within the FBI, who noted that, in the bureau’s 117-year history, the deputy director has always been a career FBI agent with deep knowledge of how the bureau functions — and not a political appointee selected by the president.\n\nNeither FBI Director Kash Patel nor Bongino have ever worked at the FBI.\n\nIn fact, the FBI Agents Association said in a memo to the workforce that Patel had privately committed to installing an agent as his second in command.\n\nThe group did not comment Monday, and the FBI declined to comment.\n\nSome FBI officials consider the deputy director job more important than the director’s role, because the deputy oversees operations, supervises the heads of field offices and handles some of the most sensitive intelligence in the federal government.\n\n“This is beyond problematic,” said Christopher O’Leary, a former senior FBI official who retired in 2023. “Any hope that Kash could be steered by having experienced leaders around him is out the window. We now have two conspiracy theorists and election deniers running our premier law enforcement and intelligence agency.”\n\nHere are five things to know about former federal prosecutor Kash Patel.\n\nSome current FBI employees, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they are not allowed to talk to reporters, were even more blunt. They said they feared Bongino's appointment spelled the end of an independent FBI and put the bureau’s fearsome investigative and intelligence capabilities in the hands of political actors with radical agendas.\n\n“I didn’t sleep and I want to pack my desk today,” one said.\n\nAnother FBI official said he viewed the hiring of Bongino as akin to bringing on conspiracy theorist Alex Jones or Oath Keepers leader Stuart Rhodes.\n\nLike those two men, Bongino has become known for both his loyalty to Trump and for trafficking in bizarre and unproven allegations about the FBI and the Capitol riot.\n\nHe once argued that every FBI agent and supervisor who had anything to do with the 2022 search of Trump’s Mar-a-Lago compound — which was conducted pursuant to a lawful search warrant — be fired. And he recently claimed without evidence that the FBI knows who placed pipe bombs outside the RNC and DNC the day before the Jan. 6 attack, even though the FBI says it has not identified any suspects and recently asked the public for help.\n\n“Will the deputy director get a security clearance? FBI background checks? Does it matter that he supported the Oath Keepers?\" one retired FBI agent said, referring to the far-right group that Rhodes founded. \"I doubt it because the director supported Jan. 6th.\"\n\nThe retired agent spoke on the condition of anonymity to avoid being targeted by online threats.\n\nDespite the focus on Bongino, many FBI employees tried to keep their heads down and go on with their jobs Monday, current and former officials said.\n\nBongino worked for two years for the New York Police Department before joining the Secret Service in 1999, where he served for 12 years. He ran unsuccessfully three times as a Republican candidate for office before striking out to build what has become a media empire, including one of the most popular podcasts in the U.S.\n\nOn Monday, Bongino sought to strike an inspiring tone.\n\n“We’re going to re-establish faith in this institution, the good people there, doing their job, hitting the streets, developing sources,” he said. “We’ll have your back. … The FBI belongs to the American people. Doesn’t belong to me, doesn’t belong to anyone else but the American people. But this is the honor of a lifetime, and it’s a serious mission. I plan on implementing that vision.”\n\nThis story first appeared on NBCNews.com. More from NBC News:",

        "content": "There was garbage time as far as the eye can see Monday night at Wells Fargo Center.\n\nThe Sixers’ 32-point margin of defeat against the Bulls was flattering. They trailed by as many as 50 in their eighth consecutive loss, allowed 142 points and plummeted to 20-37 this season. Chicago snapped a six-game skid and improved to 23-35.\n\nNothing about the night suggested that, with better health and luck, everything may eventually click into place.\n\nPaul George acknowledged as much in the locker room.\n\nGet top local stories in Philly delivered to you every morning. Sign up for NBC Philadelphia's News Headlines newsletter.\n\n“Regardless of who’s playing, who’s not playing, to have (aspirations) or for this group to believe we can be … not even to get to the playoffs, but to make a push toward it … we’ve shown no signs of a team that will compete,” George said. “We just don’t have the habits of a champion or that a playoff-contending team would have.\n\n“So to be honest right now, it’s a little far-fetched. All we can do is work hard, try to just keep going for one another, but we’ve shown no signs of — forget championship, but a playoff-contending team here.”\n\nIndeed, the Sixers’ outing made it very logical to think more about draft lottery odds and the team’s top-six protected first-round pick than any sort of potential play-in tournament exploits.\n\nThe Sixers ended the game with seven players out because of injuries. Joel Embiid is sidelined again by his left knee injury and the Sixers are assessing his options. Guerschon Yabusele hurt both eyes against Chicago, including a corneal abrasion to his right. Quentin Grimes exited with right knee soreness.\n\nOn top of escalating injuries and ever-shifting starting lineups, the Sixers have grown accustomed to dismal defense and losing this year. Since Jan. 1, they’ve gone 7-20 and ranked 26th in the NBA in net rating, 30th in defensive rating.\n\nAccording to Cleaning the Glass, they’re 28th on the season in how often opponents have gotten shots at the rim and 29th in opponents’ field goal percentage at the rim.\n\n“Just have to be more dialed in,” George said. “More effort, more energy and more pride on the defensive end. Again, it’s the same conversations we’ve been having. It baffles me how (easily) we give up layups in this league. I just don’t understand it.”\n\nOf course, head coach Nick Nurse’s postgame message to the Sixers didn’t revolve around sophisticated strategies.\n\n“I just said there’s a lot of games left and we’ve got to be professional,” he said. “We’ve got to go out and play. First of all, everybody needs to look at themselves and what they can do better, and then look at what they can do better for the team. And do our jobs, man. Be professional.”\n\nNurse called his team’s showing “very, very disappointing.”\n\nTyrese Maxey certainly shared that view, describing the Sixers’ performance as “unacceptable.”\n\n“It’s hard right now,” Maxey said. “It’s very difficult. It’s hard to see a vision … but we have a lot of games left, a lot of time left with each other. I think one of the messages that I’m going to give is we all started playing basketball because we love the game and it’s fun. A lot of us should be competitive. That’s how I feel.\n\n“I play the game because I love it. I play the game because I’m extremely competitive and I like to win, and I’ve got a lot of pride about winning, just putting forth the effort that I put in. … When we step out on the court, we’ve got to go out there and show that.”\n\nOn one hand, it would reasonable to say just about everything needs to change for the Sixers.\n\nOn the other hand, George kept it rather simple.\n\n“We’ve got to want to do it,” he said. “It’s what it comes down to. You’ve got to want to do it. Either you commit to put your body on the line or you don’t.”",

The court was divided 5-3 on throwing out Glossip's conviction, with conservative Justice Neil Gorsuch not participating.\n\nJustice Sonia Sotomayor, writing for the court, said the prosecution \"violated its constitutional obligation to correct false testimony.\" As a result, \"Glossip is entitled to a new trial,\" she wrote.\n\nGlossip, 62, was convicted of arranging the murder in 1997 of his boss at the Oklahoma City motel where they worked.\n\nGet top local stories in Philly delivered to you every morning. Sign up for NBC Philadelphia's News Headlines newsletter.\n\nHe has been on death row since 1998 and has faced imminent execution on several occasions.\n\nGlossip's latest appeal received a major boost when the state attorney general, Republican Gentner Drummond, agreed that the conviction was unsound and asked the court to rule in his favor.\n\nThe conviction relied largely on the testimony of key witness Justin Sneed, who carried out the 1997 murder. Sneed, who pleaded guilty and avoided a death sentence, testified that Glossip had hired him to kill motel owner Barry Van Treese.\n\nThe appeal revolved around claims that prosecutors withheld information about Sneed and that he gave false testimony at trial. Prosecutors knew but did not disclose at Glossip’s second trial in 2004 that Sneed had been diagnosed with bipolar disorder and prescribed lithium after his arrest.\n\nSneed also falsely testified that he had never seen a psychiatrist.\n\nAfter an investigation, Drummond concluded that because Glossip’s conviction rested significantly on Sneed’s credibility, it should not be sustained.\n\nThe state has stopped short of agreeing with Glossip’s claim that he is innocent.\n\nThe Supreme Court has a 6-3 conservative majority that rarely intervenes to prevent executions from taking place, but occasionally steps in when there has been a clear miscarriage of justice.\n\nDespite Drummond’s findings, an Oklahoma appeals court upheld the death sentence last year, and the state’s pardon and parole board voted against granting Glossip clemency.\n\nThe original prosecutors who had worked on the case, Connie Smothermon and Gary Ackley, disputed Drummond's account and said they had not been properly consulted during the investigation.\n\nThey wrote a letter questioning the new findings that was attached to an amicus brief filed by relatives of Van Treese that urged the court to uphold Glossip’s conviction.\n\nThe Supreme Court previously signaled an interest in Glossip’s case in May 2023 by stepping in to prevent him from being executed. The court also blocked Glossip’s execution in 2015 in separate litigation over the state’s lethal injection procedure.\n\nThis article first appeared on NBCNews.com. Read more from NBC News here:",

        "content": "President Donald Trump backed Elon Musk’s demand that federal employees explain their recent accomplishments by the end of Monday or risk getting fired, even as government agency officials were told that compliance with Musk’s edict was voluntary.\n\nConfusion and anger over the situation spawned new litigation and added to turmoil within the federal workforce.\n\n“What he’s doing is saying, ‘Are you actually working?’” Trump said in the Oval Office during a meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron. “And then, if you don’t answer, like, you’re sort of semi-fired or you’re fired, because a lot of people aren’t answering because they don’t even exist.”\n\nThe Republican president said Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency has found “hundreds of billions of dollars in fraud” as he suggested that federal paychecks are going to nonexistent employees. He did not present evidence for his claims.\n\nGet top local stories in Philly delivered to you every morning. Sign up for NBC Philadelphia's News Headlines newsletter.\n\nEven as Trump and Musk pressed their case, the Office of Personnel Management informed agency leaders that their workers were not required to respond by the deadline of 11:59 p.m. ET Monday.\n\nIn an email to its workforce earlier Monday obtained by NBC News, the Justice Department said that during a meeting with the interagency Chief Human Capital Officers Council, OPM informed agencies that employee responses to the email are voluntary. OPM also clarified that despite what Musk had posted, not responding to the email does not equate to a resignation, the email said.\n\nMusk says workers 'will be given another chance' as pushback mounts\n\nThe conflicting directives led to varying advice for federal employees, depending on where they work. Some were told to answer the request for a list of five things that they did last week, others were informed it was optional, and others were directed not to answer at all.\n\nMusk bristled at resistance, saying federal workers “hate even the tiniest amount of accountability.” He continued to threaten firings hours after employees were told that they didn’t need to comply with his demands.\n\n“Subject to the discretion of the President, they will be given another chance,” he posted on X, his social media platform. “Failure to respond a second time will result in termination.”\n\nAttorneys representing unions, businesses, veterans and conservation organizations filed an updated lawsuit in federal court in California on Monday, arguing Musk had violated the law by threatening mass firings.\n\nIn an appearance with French President Macron at the White House, President Trump commented on Elon Musk’s demand over the weekend that federal employees detail their work accomplishments in an email.\n\nThe lawsuit, spearheaded by the State Democracy Defenders Fund, called it “one of the most massive employment frauds in the history of this country.”\n\nAnna Kelly, a White House deputy press secretary, criticized the litigation by saying “in the time it took these employees on taxpayer-funded salaries to file a frivolous lawsuit, they could have briefly recapped their accomplishments to their managers, as is common in the private sector, 100 times over.”\n\nMusk is leading Trump’s efforts to overhaul and downsize the federal government. They’ve urged employees to resign, directed agencies to lay off probationary workers and halted work at some agencies altogether.\n\nThere has been pushback in protests around Washington and from within the government. The Office of Special Counsel, a watchdog for the federal workforce, said Monday that the firing of several probationary workers may be illegal. Trump is trying to fire the office’s leader, Hampton Dellinger, in a case that has reached the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nDellinger asked the U.S. Merit Systems Protection Board to stop layoffs of six employees, but suggested that many more workers should also be protected from losing their jobs.\n\nThere are also signs Musk is testing the limits of his influence. Some administration officials — including some of Trump’s most strident allies, such as FBI Director Kash Patel — have told employees not to respond to the email requesting five things they did, citing privacy or security concerns and noting that agencies have their own processes for evaluating employees.\n\n“When and if further information is required, we will coordinate the responses. For now, please pause any responses,” Patel wrote in an email.\n\nIt has been the most significant public divergence between the billionaire entrepreneur and Senate-approved Cabinet leaders who have otherwise been enthusiastic about fulfilling Musk’s objectives.\n\nTrump dismissed the idea there was any kind of split involving his most powerful adviser.\n\n“They don’t mean that in any way combatively with Elon,” he said, adding that “everyone thought it was a pretty ingenious idea.”\n\nThe latest turbulence began over the weekend, when Trump posted on his social media website, “ELON IS DOING A GREAT JOB, BUT I WOULD LIKE TO SEE HIM GET MORE AGGRESSIVE.”\n\nMusk followed by saying “all federal employees will shortly receive an email requesting to understand what they got done last week,” and he claimed “failure to respond will be taken as a resignation.” The directive echoed how he has managed his own companies.\n\nOPM sent out its own request afterward.\n\n“Please reply to this email with approx. 5 bullets of what you accomplished last week and cc your manager,” the message said. However, it said nothing about the potential for employees being fired for noncompliance.\n\nThere was swift resistance from several key U.S. agencies led by the president’s loyalists — including the State Department, Homeland Security and the Pentagon — which instructed their employees over the weekend not to respond. Lawmakers in both major political parties said Musk’s mandate may be illegal.\n\nWhat have federal agencies told their employees?\n\nJustice Department employees were told in an email Monday morning that they don’t need to respond to the request “due to the confidential and sensitive nature of the Department’s work.”\n\nBut employees in the U.S. attorney’s office in Washington were instructed to respond “in general terms,” leaving out case-specific or otherwise sensitive information. In an email viewed by The Associated Press, attorneys were provided with guidance about how to respond about the number of court hearings they attended, defendants they charged, cases they resolved or other tasks.\n\nThe Department of Health and Human Services told staff that “there is no HHS expectation that HHS employees respond.” If anyone wanted to write back, they were directed to be vague.\n\n“Assume that what you write will be read by malign foreign actors and tailor your response accordingly,” said an email to employees.\n\nEducation Department workers were directed to comply on Monday morning. “The email is legitimate and employees should respond,” wrote Rachel Oglesby, chief of staff at the department. She added that “frontline supervisors will evaluate responses and non-responses.”\n\nCharles Ezell, the acting director of OPM, suggested that Musk’s request may lead to new expectations for employees. Officials “may consider incorporating an expectation that employees submit weekly accomplishments bullets,” he wrote in an email to staff.\n\nThousands of government employees have already been forced out of the federal workforce — either by being fired or through a “deferred resignation″ offer — during the first month of Trump’s second term. There’s no official figure available for the total firings or layoffs, but the AP has tallied hundreds of thousands of workers who are being affected. Many work outside Washington.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Steve Peoples in New York, Eric Tucker, Amanda Seitz, Byron Tau, Ellen Knickmeyer, Matthew Perrone, Alanna Durkin Richer and Tara Copp in Washington and Valerie Gonzalez in McAllen, Texas, contributed to this report.",

That is what is at stake.”\n\nBoyle was joined by several union leaders, including Everett Kelley, the National President of the American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE), as well as Karen Ford-Woods, the local AFGE president who represents workers at the Veterans Medical Center.\n\n“We are very apprehensive,” Ford-Woods said. “People are shaking in their boots.

Sign up for NBC Philadelphia's News Headlines newsletter.\n\nThousands of federal government employees have been fired and laid off across the country as part of the Trump administration’s efforts to shrink the size of the federal workforce. The cuts are being led by billionaire Elon Musk and his Department of Government Efficiency.\n\nThe White House initially offered a “deferred resignation” proposal in exchange for financial incentives, like months of paid leave, to almost all federal employees who opted to leave their jobs by Feb. 6.\n\nBut just before that deadline, a federal judge blocked Trump’s plan, wanting to hear arguments from the administration and the labor unions, which said the offer was illegal.\n\nAccording to the Office of Personnel Management, about 75,000 federal employees had accepted the offer as of Feb. 12.\n\nThen on Feb. 13, the Trump administration ordered agencies to lay off probationary federal employees, workers who were on the job for less than a year and who have yet to gain civil service protection. Just last week, around 400 Philadelphia IRS employees were among the thousands of probationary workers across the country who were laid off.\n\n“As to how we’re doing, the only answer is poorly,” Alex Berman, the executive vice president of the National Treasury Union Chapter 71, which represents Philly-area IRS workers, told NBC10 on Monday. “I have been on my phone constantly talking to the more than 400 people at my chapter alone who were let go under false pretenses. Now we’re looking at, if you don’t do X, you’ll be fired.”\n\nBerman referred to an email that was sent to federal workers last week asking them to detail their work.\n\nMonday’s rally took place at Independence National Historical Park where two employees were recently laid off, according to a union official.\n\n“I truly worry about the future of our workforce,” Boyle said Monday. “Imagine attempting to recruit the best and the brightest right now to join public service. Why would anyone sign up for this treatment?”\n\nNBC10 reached out to the White House for comment. We have not yet heard back.",

        "source": "https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/",
        "content": "When Molly Smith went for her first mammogram in 2021, she had reason to be wary. Her grandmother, mother, sister and another family member have all been diagnosed with breast cancer.\n\nThe mammogram detected abnormal tissue — said Smith, 46, a mother of two from Myrtle Beach, South Carolina — and more testing was necessary. To her great relief, Smith received a clean report following an ultrasound, MRI and biopsy. But she incurred bills of more than $1,000 that her insurance didn’t cover.\n\nSmith is one of millions of American women who are at high risk for breast cancer but whose insurance does not cover the costs of follow-on screenings needed to detect the disease. Breast cancer can be hidden in mammograms for many women, so doctors recommend additional screenings, which include ultrasounds, MRIs and tomosynthesis, a kind of 3D mammogram.\n\nMolly Smith (NBC News)\n\nGet top local stories in Philly delivered to you every morning. Sign up for NBC Philadelphia's News Headlines newsletter.\n\n“With ultrasounds you find cancers that are not evident on mammograms,” said Dr. Madhavi Raghu, a radiation oncologist in western Connecticut. “If tomosynthesis is normal and the ultrasound is normal, the likelihood a patient has underlying cancer is quite low.”\n\nWomen with dense breast tissue, a condition affecting roughly half of women over 40, are at special risk for breast cancer, according to the Food and Drug Administration. The condition makes it harder to spot cancer on a mammogram, so last year the FDA began requiring mammogram providers to notify women with dense breast tissue that they could need further evaluation and screenings to rule out cancer.\n\nBut such screenings cost money, out of pocket, for most women. While one mammogram per year is typically covered by private health insurance plans, they don’t generally reimburse fully for additional screenings.\n\nAnd last year, doctors in Connecticut, New York, North Carolina and Texas say Medicare stopped reimbursing for the same breast cancer ultrasound screenings it had reimbursed for in 2023. Raghu provided NBC News with several redacted patient records showing Medicare declining reimbursements in 2024 for ultrasound breast screenings it reimbursed in 2023.\n\nThe lack of coverage puts women with Medicare and those with private insurance in a terrible bind.\n\n“You know you need to go back,” said Smith, who has private insurance, “and there’s always that looming question: Am I a ticking time bomb, and what is it going to cost me?”\n\nMolly Smith, right, with her sister Sundi, left, grandmother Mary and cousin Hazel. (Courtesy Molly Smith)\n\nA spokeswoman for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services said in a statement that ultrasound or MRI scans are only covered by Medicare when provided as a diagnostic test.\n\n“If the scans were provided as a screening test, then Medicare is unable to cover those by law,” she said.\n\nScreening is considered a routine form of testing for patients with no symptoms, while diagnostic testing investigates symptoms or abnormalities found during a screening. The CMS spokeswoman said the agency’s “coverage policy” had not changed.\n\nUltrasound screenings for women with dense breast tissue, under the CMS interpretation, would not be investigating symptoms. Physicians question this explanation because there is only one reimbursement code for a breast ultrasound, regardless of whether it is proposed as a screening or a diagnostic test. The recent denials by Medicare appear to place all breast ultrasounds into the category that is not covered.\n\nPhysicians say there is another problem with Medicare not reimbursing for ultrasound and other screenings: Private insurers often follow CMS’ lead on reimbursement decisions.\n\nLimiting reimbursement for cancer screenings translates to higher out-of-pocket costs for women who need them. Unreimbursed expenses are rising, research published in the journal Radiology shows, as more women sign up for high-deductible insurance plans to reduce their health care costs. The study also confirms a fear many doctors express: Faced with additional costs for necessary screenings, many women just won’t get them. Some 21% of the women surveyed for the Radiology study said they would decline additional screenings if they had to pay for them.\n\n“The fact that mammograms are not always a good standard or indicator is a problem we have to raise awareness on,” said Doris Caldwell, a survivor of inflammatory breast cancer in Spearfish, South Dakota. Because inflammatory breast cancer doesn’t typically show up in mammograms, Caldwell has MRIs annually. This year, she said she expects to pay $1,200 out of pocket.\n\nDoris Caldwell with her husband, Joel, and a granddaughter. (Courtesy Doris Caldwell)\n\n“It feels like you shouldn’t have to struggle to get the extra screening you need for early detection,” Caldwell added. “The earlier you catch cancer, the cheaper it is to treat. This should be easy.”\n\nAdding to the urgency: The American Cancer Society’s most recent statistics on breast cancer found that between 2012 and 2021 diagnoses of the disease rose faster among younger women — those under 50 — than among women over 50.\n\n“Out-of-pocket cost sharing is a significant barrier for those individuals who need access to multiple early detection services in order to find cancer at an earlier stage when treatment is more effective,” said Lisa Lacasse, president of the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network. “Removing cost sharing for each intervention in the screening process is a critical step toward ending cancer as we know it, for everyone.”\n\nLast year, Iowa lawmakers passed legislation requiring private health insurers to cover the entire cost of additional breast cancer screenings, such as ultrasounds and MRIs, while a Massachusetts law from last fall requires insurers to cover ultrasounds and other screenings without increasing patients’ out-of-pocket costs.\n\nLegislators in Connecticut, Florida, Indiana, Hawaii, South Carolina and Virginia have recently introduced bills that would require insurers to cover these additional screenings, according to the American College of Radiology. The American Cancer Society says it hopes to see similar legislation passed soon in Nebraska, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and Wisconsin.\n\nOther states, such as South Dakota and Montana, have tried unsuccessfully to pass similar legislation. A recent effort in Montana failed, distressing Shelley Emslie, a schoolteacher and breast cancer survivor in Bigfork, Montana. She needs regular MRIs to detect a return of her cancer; the costs of extra screenings approximate $3,500 each year, she said, charges her employer’s high-deductible insurance plan does not cover.\n\n“I just know there are other women out there not getting the screening because of the cost,” Emslie told NBC News. “You’re going to have people who have a mammogram and need additional screening, but they’re not going to go back in.”\n\nThis story first appeared on NBCNews.com.

The U.S. attorney's office in Philadelphia, which represents the federal agencies named in the lawsuit, declined comment Monday.\n\nIn federal court in Rhode Island, Trump administration lawyers, however, have argued that the government's move to freeze funds was legal and asked a judge to reject a request by nearly two dozen Democratic states for a preliminary injunction.\n\nAdministration lawyers characterized the freeze as simply a “pause” to consider how best to use federal funds.

        "content": "A Louisiana landscape of centuries-old sugar cane plantations and enduring Afro-Creole culture along the Mississippi River had been eligible for receiving rare federal protection following a multi-year review by the National Park Service.\n\nBut this month, the agency withdrew the 11-mile stretch of land known as Great River Road from consideration for National Historic Landmark designation at the request of state officials, who celebrated the move as a win for economic development.\n\nCommunity organizations bemoaned the decision as undermining efforts to preserve the rich yet endangered cultural legacies of free African American communities that grew out of slavery.\n\nThe region, in the heart of Louisiana's heavily industrialized Chemical Corridor in St. John the Baptist Parish, has been at the center of conflicts between grassroots community groups challenging the expansion of polluting industrial facilities and officials and business leaders doubling down on their importance for sustaining local economies. The area is among the most threatened by climate injustice in the nation, according to the Environmental Defense Fund's climate vulnerability index.\n\nGet top local stories in Philly delivered to you every morning. Sign up for NBC Philadelphia's News Headlines newsletter.\n\nAshley Rogers, executive director of the nearby Whitney Plantation, said the decision to remove the Great River Road region from consideration for federally granted recognition was due to the “changing priorities” of the Trump administration, the latest blow to “a culture under attack.”\n\n“It’s 100% because of the politics of the current administration, it’s not because we’ve suddenly decided that this place doesn’t matter,” Rogers said.\n\nA multi-year National Park Service study on the area completed in October concluded that the “exceptional integrity” of the Great River Road landscape conveys “the feeling of living and working in the plantation system in the American South.\"\n\nPlantation buildings are so well-preserved that director Quentin Tarantino used them while filming “Django Unchained,” to capture the antebellum era. But there's also a rich and overlooked history of the enslaved people who worked the plantations, their burial sites likely hidden in the surrounding cane fields and many of their descendants still living in tight-knit communities nearby.\n\nThe study deemed the region eligible to gain the same federal recognition as around 2,600 of the nation’s most important historical sites, including Mount Vernon, George Washington’s estate and Monticello, Thomas Jefferson’s residence.\n\nFort Knox is the site of the U.S. Treasury’s Bullion Depository for American gold reserves in Kentucky.\n\nHowever, the determination was “premature and untimely” given that a grain terminal that threatened to impact historic properties was no longer planned, said the National Park Service’s Joy Beasley, who oversees the designation of historic landmarks, in a Feb. 13 letter to the Army Corps of Engineers.\n\nBeasley’s letter stated the reversal was prompted by a request from the state’s Department of Environmental Quality, which is tasked with regulating environmental protection and has made no secret of its support for industrial expansion.\n\nThe head of the department, Aurelia S. Giacometto, framed the decision as freeing the region from federal meddling and oversight and opening up pathways for development.\n\n“I’m grateful that the Trump Administration understands that states and localities are better at determining their interests relating to clean air, water and developing industry than leaving crucial decisions like those to Washington,” Giacometto said in a statement.\n\nPort of South Louisiana CEO Paul Matthew said in a press release that companies are clamoring to develop and expand along the Mississippi River, which would improve quality of life and spur economic growth without sacrificing cultural legacies.\n\n“If you really want to lift people out of poverty, you get them work and increase job opportunity,” Republican Gov. Jeff Landry said.\n\nLocal historical and community organizations believe the region can instead improve its economy by focusing on preserving and promoting its history.\n\nRamshackled homes and shuttered buildings in the area are endemic of longstanding underinvestment in these communities, but it's not too late to reverse this trend through means besides industrialization, said Joy Banner, co-founder of the local nonprofit The Descendants Project, which is restoring historical properties in Great River Road.\n\nBanner helped lead efforts to successfully halt the construction of a towering $600 million industrial grain terminal that would have been built in her hometown, the predominantly Black community of Wallace — spurring the National Park Service's study. A spokesperson for the Army Corps of Engineers said any future industrial development in the Great River Road would still need to consider the potential impacts on historical and cultural heritage.\n\nIn the region's Willow Grove neighborhood, 76-year-old Isabella Poche still trims the grass and repaints the tombs at the cemetery where her mother, sisters and other relatives were buried with help from the Black community's generations-old mutual aid society she now leads. Beyond the furrows of the sugar cane fields where her family once worked, a large plantation home stands in the distance by the river's bank. It's a peaceful place she hopes to see protected.\n\n“I don’t want to move anywhere else,” Poche said. “I've been here all my life.\"",

        "content": "Pope Francis was well enough to meet with the Vatican secretary of state to approve new decrees for possible saints and make some major governing decisions that suggest he is getting essential work done and looking ahead despite being hospitalized in critical condition with double pneumonia.\n\nThe audience, which occurred Monday, signaled that the machinery of the Vatican is still grinding on even though doctors have warned the prognosis for the 88-year-old Francis is guarded.\n\nDecisions on saints and a formal meeting of cardinals\n\nThe Vatican's Tuesday noon bulletin contained a series of significant decisions, most importantly that Francis had met with Cardinal Pietro Parolin and Archbishop Edgar Pena Parra, the so-called Vatican “substitute” or chief of staff. It was the first known time the pope had met with Parolin, who is essentially the Vatican prime minister, since his Feb. 14 hospitalization.\n\nGet top local stories in Philly delivered to you every morning. Sign up for NBC Philadelphia's News Headlines newsletter.\n\nDuring the audience, Francis approved decrees for two new saints and five people for beatification — the first step toward sainthood. Francis also decided to “convene a consistory about the future canonizations.”\n\nFrancis regularly approves decrees from the Vatican's saint-making office when he is at the Vatican, albeit during audiences with the head of the office, not Parolin. But the calling of a consistory, which is a formal meeting of cardinals, was also significant and forward-looking, given his illness.\n\nNo date was set for the meeting. But it was also at a banal consistory to set dates for canonizations on Feb. 11, 2013, that Pope Benedict XVI announced, in Latin, that he would resign because he couldn't keep up with the rigors of the papacy. Francis has said he, too, would consider resigning if he found himself in that situation, after Benedict “opened the door” and became the first pope in 600 years to retire.\n\nGiovanna Chirri, the reporter for the Italian news agency ANSA who was covering the consistory that day and broke the story because she understood Latin, said she didn't think Francis would follow in Benedict's footsteps, “even if some would want it.”\n\n“I could be wrong, but I hope not,” she told The Associated Press. “As long as he's alive, the world and the church need him.”\n\nFrancis' English biographer, Austen Ivereigh, said it was possible and that all that matters is that Francis be “wholly free to make the right decision.”\n\n“The pope has always said that the papacy is for life, and he has shown that there is no problem with a frail and elderly pope,” Ivereigh said. “But he has also said that should he ever have a long-term degenerative or debilitating condition which prevents him from fully carrying out the exercise of the papal ministry, he would consider resigning. And so would any pope.”\n\nFrancis' ideas about resignation\n\nFrancis has said that if he were to resign, he would live in Rome, outside the Vatican, and be called ''emeritus bishop of Rome\" rather than emeritus pope given the problems that occurred with Benedict's experiment as a retired pope. Despite his best efforts, Benedict remained a point of reference for conservatives before he died in 2022, and his home inside the Vatican gardens something of a pilgrimage destination for the right.\n\nFrancis has also written a letter of resignation, to be invoked if he became medically incapacitated.\n\nIn addition to the audience with Parolin, the Vatican released Francis' message for Lent, the period leading up to Easter, in yet another forward-looking sign. In a subsequent bulletin, Francis named a handful of new bishops for Brazil, a new archbishop for Vancouver and modified the law for the Vatican City State to create a new hierarchy.\n\nFrancis recently named the first-ever woman to head the city-state, Sister Raffaella Petrini, who takes over March 1. In the announcement Tuesday, Francis specifically empowered her to lead and to tell her priestly deputies what to do.\n\nMany if not all of these decisions were likely in the works for some time. But the Vatican has said Francis has been doing some work in the hospital, including signing documents, and regardless there is no provision in the Catholic Church to transfer full papal power except in the case of a resignation or death of a pope.\n\nThe only other outsider who is known to have visited the pope, other than his personal secretaries and medical personnel, is Italian Premier Giorgia Meloni, Meloni, who visited Feb. 19.\n\nThe pope slept well\n\nOn Tuesday morning, the Vatican’s typically brief morning update said: “The pope slept well, all night.”\n\nThe previous evening, doctors had said he remained in critical condition at Rome's Gemelli hospital with double pneumonia but reported a “slight improvement” in some laboratory results. In the most upbeat bulletin in days, the Vatican said Francis had resumed work from his hospital room, calling a parish in Gaza City that he has kept in touch with since the war there began.\n\nDoctors have said the condition of the Argentine pope, who had part of one lung removed as a young man, is touch-and-go, given his age, fragility and pre-existing lung disease before the pneumonia set in.\n\nBut in Monday’s update, they said he hadn’t had any more respiratory crises since Saturday, and the flow and concentration of supplemental oxygen has been slightly reduced. The slight kidney insufficiency detected on Sunday was not causing alarm at the moment, doctors said.\n\nAllies and ordinary faithful hopeful\n\nFrancis’ right-wing critics have been spreading dire rumors about his condition, but his allies have cheered him on and expressed hope that he will pull through. Many noted that from the very night of his election as pope, Francis had asked for the prayers of ordinary faithful, a request he repeats daily.\n\n“I’m a witness of everything he did for the church, with a great love of Jesus,” Honduran Cardinal Oscar Rodriguez Maradiaga told La Repubblica. “Humanly speaking, I don’t think it’s time for him to go to Paradise.”\n\nAt Gemelli on a rainy Tuesday morning, ordinary Romans and visitors alike were also praying for the pope. Hoang Phuc Nguyen, who lives in Canada but was visiting Rome to participate in a Holy Year pilgrimage, took the time to come to Gemelli to say a special prayer for the pope at the statue of St. John Paul II outside the main entrance.\n\n“We heard that he is in the hospital right now and we are very worried about his health,” Nguyen said. \"He is our father and it is our responsibility to pray for him.”\n\n___\n\nGiovanna dell'Orto contributed.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press religion coverage receives support through the AP’s collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

        "content": "The Eagles’ signature play is under attack again.\n\nAn unnamed team has reportedly proposed to ban the Tush Push/Brotherly Shove, NFL executive vice president of football operations Troy Vincent said, per NFL Network’s Judy Battista.\n\nWe’ll see what happens in the next couple of months.\n\nQuestion on the Tush Push play is whether it could be modified to keep some semblance of the play intact. The play is run so infrequently that there isn’t enough injury data for the league to push for a ban based on injuries alone. — Judy Battista (@judybattista) February 24, 2025\n\nGet top local stories in Philly delivered to you every morning. Sign up for NBC Philadelphia's News Headlines newsletter.\n\nAccording to Dianna Russini of The Athletic, the Packers are the team that has proposed this rule change. The Eagles beat the Packers this past postseason in the wild-card round on their way to Super Bowl LIX.\n\nThis, of course, is not the first time there has been talk of banning the Tush Push. It came up a couple of years ago but a rule change proposal never got on the voting floor. If the rule change is officially proposed, it could come to a vote at the NFL’s annual league meetings in Palm Beach, Florida, next month. Any rule change proposal would need 24 of 32 owners to sign off on it.\n\nAfter the last Super Bowl season in 2022, there seemed to be a little push to ban the play.\n\n“All I know is everything we're doing is legal and it works,” Eagles GM Howie Roseman said at the 2023 combine. “And just because people do something that’s really good, doesn't mean it should be outlawed.”\n\nThe Eagles have had a lot of success running this particular version of the QB sneak and other teams have failed to replicate that success. The Eagles would probably tell you that the “push” element of the play is not the most important.\n\nThe play starts with having good offensive line play. The Eagles had that on their interior this season with Landon Dickerson, Cam Jurgens and Mekhi Becton. It also helps to have QB Jalen Hurts. Having a QB who can squat 600 pounds is helpful in these situations.\n\nHere’s what Vincent said about the play in December 2023:\n\n\"I think there was a report that either the league office or the Commissioner was looking to eliminate this play. That was false,\" Vincent said, via NFL.com. \"We've been monitoring this play from Week 1 of the regular season. This play has evolved. It has evolved, which coaches told us it would. We're seeing passes come out of that formation. People doing things differently than what we've seen a year ago. Everyone doesn't have the Philly success rate, but people are trying it.\n\n\"I would just say, Philly does it better than everyone else. That's a fact. On those fourth-and-1, fourth-and-inches situations, we've seen others — I think I've reviewed 78 plays on Friday of just the push play itself — just looking at formation. Is it one-back, two backs pushing, three backs? They're very effective.\n\n\"And that's what we don't want to do. So talking to the membership, you don't want to punish anyone for doing something well. People have tried different things to stop it. Have not had success. That's why bringing it to the membership just to say this play has evolved. Other people are doing it, and we've seen some pretty good football from the evolution of the original formation.\"",

Online\n\nJimmy Kimmel's heart is full.\n\nNearly one year after his and wife Molly McNearney's son Billy Kimmel underwent his third open heart surgery, the late night talk show host exclusively shared with E! News that the 7-year-old is \"in perfect health.\"\n\n\"Billy is about to turn 8,\" Jimmy Kimmel raved at Keep Memory Alive's Power of Love Gala in Las Vegas Feb. 22. \"He's doing great. He's very healthy.\"\n\nGet top local stories in Philly delivered to you every morning. Sign up for NBC Philadelphia's News Headlines newsletter.\n\nAnd that's why the 57-year-old said it \"means a lot\" to be honored at the star-studded fundraiser, which benefits Cleveland Clinic Lou Ruvo Center for Brain Health in his home state of Nevada. (For more from his interview, tune into E! News tonight, Feb. 24, at 11 p.m.)\n\nHaving previously received an outpouring of support from the health community during his son's medical ordeal, Jimmy Kimmel — who also shares 10-year-old daughter Jane Kimmel with Molly, as well as kids Katie Kimmel, 33, and Kevin Kimmel, 31, with ex-wife Gina Maddy — thought it was only right to pass on the love to another cause.\n\nREAD Kirsten Dunst and Jimmy Kimmel Reveal Their Sons Got Into a Fight at School\n\n\"It's very special when people say, 'Oh, we're praying for your son,'\" Jimmy Kimmel explained. \"People throw those words around lightly, but when you hear them about yourself, they're very meaningful.\"\n\nEmphasizing the importance of supporting others, he added, \"It is really helpful to know that you can go to a place where they are on the cutting edge of figuring this stuff out, hopefully curing these terrible brain-related diseases and conditions that that people have.\"\n\nJimmy Kimmel is recalling partying with Taylor Swift and her boyfriend Travis Kelce at a party packed with A-Listers.\n\nThe comedian's son was diagnosed with a rare congenital heart defect three hours after his birth in 2017. His condition required immediate surgery, leading the then-newborn to undergo what would be his first operation.\n\n\"It was the longest three hours of my life,\" Jimmy Kimmel recounted during a May 2017 episode of his eponymous talk show. \"They didn't do everything. He'll have to have another open heart surgery in three to six months.\"\n\nBilly Kimmel went through his second surgery that December. In May 2023, he underwent his third operation to have a new valve put in his heart.\n\n\"Walking around this hospital,\" Jimmy Kimmel wrote on Instagram last year, \"meeting parents at their most vulnerable, children in pain and the miracle workers who do everything in their considerable power to save them is a humbling experience.\"\n\nHe added, \"Thanks to those loving strangers who took time to pray for and send positive energy to our baby.\"",

        "source": "https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/",
        "content": "Nearly 40% of the federal contracts that the Trump administration claims to have canceled as part of its signature cost-cutting program aren’t expected to save the government any money, the administration's own data shows.\n\nThe Department of Government Efficiency run by Elon Musk last week published an initial list of 1,125 contracts that it terminated in recent weeks across the federal government. Data published on DOGE's “Wall of Receipts” shows that more than one-third of the contract cancellations, 417 in all, are expected to yield no savings.\n\nThat’s usually because the total value of the contracts has already been fully obligated, which means the government has a legal requirement to spend the funds for the goods or services it purchased and in many cases has already done so.\n\n“It’s like confiscating used ammunition after it’s been shot when there’s nothing left in it. It doesn’t accomplish any policy objective,” said Charles Tiefer, a retired University of Baltimore law professor and expert on government contracting law. “Their terminating so many contracts pointlessly obviously doesn’t accomplish anything for saving money.”\n\nGet top local stories in Philly delivered to you every morning. Sign up for NBC Philadelphia's News Headlines newsletter.\n\nDozens of them were for already-paid subscriptions to The Associated Press, Politico and other media services that the administration said it would discontinue. Others were for research studies that have been awarded, training that has taken place, software that has been purchased and interns that have come and gone.\n\nAn administration official said it made sense to cancel contracts that are seen as potential dead weight, even if the moves do not yield any savings. The official was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\nIn all, DOGE data says the 417 contracts in question had a total value of $478 million. Dozens of other canceled contracts are expected to yield little if any savings.\n\n“It's too late for the government to change its mind on many of these contracts and walk away from its payment obligation,” said Tiefer, who served on the Commission on Wartime Contracting in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\nDuring a joint news conference on Monday, French President Emmanuel Macron interrupted President Donald Trump to clarify, “We provided real money.”\n\nTiefer said DOGE appeared to be taking a “slash and burn” approach to cutting contracts, which he said could damage the performance of government agencies. He said savings could be made instead by working with agency contracting officers and inspectors general to find efficiencies, an approach the administration has not taken.\n\nDOGE says the overall contract cancellations are expected to save more than $7 billion so far, an amount that has been questioned as inflated by independent experts.\n\nThe canceled contracts were to purchase a wide range of goods and services.\n\nThe Department of Housing and Urban Development awarded a contract in September to purchase and install office furniture at various branches. While the contract does not expire until later this year, federal records show the agency had already agreed to spend the maximum $567,809 with a furniture company.\n\nThe U.S. Agency for International Development negotiated a $145,549 contract last year to clean the carpet at its headquarters in Washington. But the full amount had already been obligated to a firm that is owned by a Native American tribe based in Michigan.\n\nAnother already-spent $249,600 contract went to a Washington, D.C., firm to help prepare the Department of Transportation for the recent transition from the Biden to the Trump administration.\n\nSome of the canceled contracts were intended to modernize and improve the way government works, which would seem to be at odds with DOGE’s cost-cutting mission.\n\nOne of the largest, for instance, went to a consulting firm to help carry out a reorganization at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, which led the agency’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The maximum $13.6 million had already been obligated to Deloitte Consulting LLP for help with the restructuring, which included closing several research offices.\n\n___\n\nFoley reported from Iowa City, Iowa.",

Josh Shapiro said Monday that President Donald Trump 's administration has freed up billions in federal aid that the Democrat had accused it of withholding illegally and unconstitutionally.\n\nShapiro said in a news conference that more than $2 billion that his administration had identified as either frozen or held up by an unspecified review was now accessible to state agencies.\n\nShapiro sued in federal court over the aid on Feb. 13, after federal courts had repeatedly rejected the Trump administration's sweeping pause on federal funding and questioned whether the Trump administration was ignoring court orders.\n\nShapiro also said he pressed his case in conversations with senior Trump administration officials while he was in Washington, D.C., over the weekend. The U.S. attorney's office in Philadelphia, which represents the federal agencies named in the lawsuit, declined comment Monday.\n\nPennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro on Tuesday, Feb. 4, 2025, in Harrisburg, Pa. AP Photo/Matt Rourke\n\nIn federal court in Rhode Island, Trump administration lawyers, however, have argued that the government's move to freeze funds was legal and asked a judge to reject a request by nearly two dozen Democratic states for a preliminary injunction.\n\nAdministration lawyers characterized the freeze as simply a \"pause\" to consider how best to use federal funds. They contended the case was moot since the Office of Management and Budget had rescinded its memo in late January freezing federal grants and loans.\n\nMuch of the stalled grant funding identified by Shapiro's administration was passed by Congress in signature laws signed by former President Joe Biden, including his landmark 2022 climate law, the Inflation Reduction Act, and his 2021 infrastructure law.\n\nThe lawsuit had said aid was being withheld from programs that distribute money to upgrade energy efficiency in homes, plug abandoned gas wells, clean up abandoned mine land, improve municipal water and sewer systems and reimburse industry for cutting their planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nFive federal agencies were named as defendants: the White House Office of Management and Budget, the Environmental Protection Agency and the departments of Interior and Transportation.\n\nNone have commented on the lawsuit, except for the Department of Energy, which said it was complying with the court orders. However, the department didn't say whether it had released funding that Shapiro's administration accused it of holding up.",

A lot of people are working and fighting for you. A lot is still up in the air,\" Houlahan said.\n\nOn Monday night, Musk renewed his threat that he would fire any federal workers who do not respond to an email asking them to list five things they accomplished last week.\n\nSeveral government agencies, including the FBI and State Department, have told their employees not to respond to the email.\n\nMusk wrote that \"failure to respond a second time will result in termination.\"\n\n\"I thought it was great because we have people who don't show up for work, and no one knows if they work for the government,\" said President Trump, backing Musk.\n\nOutside Independence Hall on Monday, members of the American Federation of Government Workers held a rally calling the terminations illegal.\n\nDemocratic Congressman Brendan Boyle says the cuts could have a devastating impact - pointing to 400 recent layoffs at the Pennsylvania IRS office.\n\n\"These are not federal jobs, these are Pennsylvania jobs. These are Philadelphia jobs,\" Boyle told the crowd.\n\nIndependence Mall is among the national parks to lose rangers in the layoffs.\n\nMany of the fired workers received a letter accusing them of not meeting performance standards.\n\n\"Many of them had never had a performance review,\" Boyle said.",

(WPVI) -- The search is on for the person who snatched a puppy from a store in Montgomery County, and the whole thing was caught on surveillance camera.\n\nThe video shows the suspect entering the Playful Pets shop in Plymouth Township last Monday and showing an interest in a German Shepherd puppy.\n\nBut investigators say she didn't run off with the dog right away.\n\n\"She meandered around the store for a short period of time, kind of distracted the employee that was working there, and ultimately left the store with the puppy without paying for it,\" said Plymouth Township Det. Sgt. Chris Schwartz.\n\nIn the video you can see the suspect eventually picking up the puppy, valued at $2,800, and go down the stairwell to the front door.\n\n\"She left the front door, puppy in hand, and ran to a red Ford Ranger pickup truck and fled the area,\" said Schwartz.\n\nThe suspect was last seen traveling eastbound on Ridge Pike in Plymouth Township.\n\nThe woman's identity is unknown, but investigators are optimistic that images of her will help them solve this case.\n\n\"We just have the video to go on right now. We are looking for the public's help identifying this person that took the puppy from Playful Pets,\" he says.\n\nAnyone with information about this case is asked to contact Plymouth Township Police.",

        "content": "Sign up for our Daily Email newsletter to stay up-to-date on the latest local news throughout Philadelphia.\n\nSibling relationships, spouse relationships and other “extracurricular” bonds are what make up most of the plot of ‘Millers in Marriage.’ The new film from writer-director-actor Ed Burns features a stacked cast (with the likes of Burns, Julianna Margulies, Gretchen Mol, Minnie Driver, Patrick Wilson and more) and an even more stacked storyline of familial and marital dysfunction.\n\nIn the film, Margulies’ Maggie Miller is examining the changing dynamics between her success versus her husband’s (played by Campbell Scott.) Mol’s Eve Miller, on the other hand, is trying to find her voice again in a toxic marriage through a new budding friendship.\n\nTo chat more about their characters and dynamics, both Margulies and Mol sat down with Metro to dive into ‘Millers in Marriage.’\n\nWhy sign on with ‘Millers in Marriage’?\n\nMol: It started with, I’m going to send you a script [that] Ed Burns is directing and wrote— immediately, I was excited. And then there were just all these amazing female roles…it was people just talking and acting. It also felt contemporary and very much something I could relate to as far as the arc that the character takes. So really, it was an easy decision.\n\nMargulies: Very much what Gretchen said, but also, I think it is very rare to get a script for people in their 50s and at this point in their marriages. All three siblings [in the film] are going through a crisis in their marriage, and it was so refreshing to be able to read a script where I couldn’t wait to turn the page and see what happened within the relationships of all of ’em. And not just the marriages, but the siblings in general and the pecking order.\n\nSo much of their childhood reflects back into their present day and how they deal with their marriages. I think for Gretchen’s role, to see a woman sort of get capped at the knees just when she’s hitting her peak to stop to have babies and make that choice—was it her choice? Whereas my character is a writer. I actually, in a strange way, think that my character got the luck of the draw because she could work while she had children. She could write her books while being at home, and she didn’t have to make that choice. And now she’s at a crossroads where her career is more successful than her husband’s, and can her husband handle that?\n\nI was so excited to do a movie that had no green screen, there was no sequel. It’s an adult film for adults and for people who can relate to it, who suddenly are finding themselves without children at home. So I found it really refreshing to be able to dive into it and to see that an actual movie was getting made about something I was interested in.\n\nWhen you were first reading the script and then went on to film, since everyone is so intertwined in it, what were the most fun relationship dynamics for you to explore or see unfold?\n\nMol: I think what I loved actually about the sibling relationship is all of these characters are interconnected by these parents that you never actually meet, but who get a few mentions throughout. So in every interaction, we would get together and we would talk about that and we would sort of figure out which sibling was this and how Juliana was sort of the caretaker and how that might be frustrating to have my character being sort of the messy one a little bit.\n\nSo all of those dynamics were just laid in so beautifully and subtly. They get to this time in their lives and you see them still unable to really have fruitful, lovely relationships. Their relationships are a little bit broken. The movie creeps up on you in a way because these particular people still have a lot of growing to do and learning and exploring and discovery to do. Hopefully, this is sort of the second chance or the beginning of a new chapter where they do understand themselves and the decisions that they made earlier and why they make the choices that they make.\n\nMargulies: I loved playing with Campbell Scott, it was just so delicious. He was so open and every actor on the set, we had such a fun time making this movie together, all of us. And when you work as an actor for Ed Burns who’s written it and is directing it, every day on set is kind of joyful. I mean, I’m really not exaggerating when I say the days were fun. But I wanted to see every relationship, really. I wanted to see Minnie Driver’s relationship with Maggie, or how is Gretchen’s character Eve and Maggie going to take her in?\n\nI think Maggie’s a little bit closed off to human emotion because she’s the eldest and she’s always taking care of everyone. And now it’s her turn. And I understand it. I mean, the other day someone said, are you going to be upset when your kid goes to college? He’s a junior right now in high school. And I said, no, I’ve been taking care of my elderly parents, my kid… maybe I’m just naive and I’ll probably be a crying mess, but I’m really looking forward to what my next chapter is. And I think that’s what this movie’s about.\n\nI saw that Ed himself is very collaborative with his actors on set. Were any moments from the film born out of that collaboration that stand out to you?\n\nMargulies: Oh yes, every day Ed would always get what was written and then he would tell us, we got that, now you go have fun with it. Say whatever you want to say as long as it’s in the context of the scene. For my character, one of the scenes was in the bedroom after the dinner party where she and Nick [Campbell Scott] get in a fight because he doesn’t appreciate what she said at dinner. We improv some of that that stayed in the movie.\n\nAnd then at breakfast when she has given him her book to read and the next morning she comes down the stairs and he says, so seriously, “That’s me, I don’t appreciate what you’re doing.” We got it in the first couple of takes and then Eddie just said, just go. I think Ed was so confident in the material that he wanted to see what it brought out in us. And that comes from having experience as someone who writes and directs and acts in his own movies.\n\nMol: I had that experience too, he is such a great storyteller. I felt like from the first conversation that we had on the phone about Eve, the next time I read the script there were these little changes and little things that we had talked about that made their way into it. You really got to find everything and different possibilities in each scene. And it was a similar thing with Patrick Wilson playing a drunk because I mean, he’s such a talented actor, and how many different ways can you play a drunk?\n\nSometimes he would be hysterical and I’d say, people are going to like you too much if you play it like that. And then he would be so awful sometimes where I would be off camera almost in tears because it felt so abusive really. He really had such a rolodex of drunks and ways to really let him go for it, and it was just fantastic to be in the room and see.\n\nCatch ‘Millers in Marriage‘ in select theaters and on Digital.",

They show the league the type of players they look for every year and have been consistent over the last four drafts in staying true to their board and style.\n\nThis is my first all-Eagles, no trades, 2025 NFL mock draft for Philly Sports Network of the draft SzN.\n\nEagles Mock Draft 1.0\n\nRound One Pick 32- T.J. Sanders, Defensive Tackle, South Carolina\n\nSanders has elite length and eliminates passing lanes with his height and reach. He utilizes a quick burst off the line and is disruptive, causing havoc in the backfield. T.J. provides an interior pass rush (8.5 sacks last 2 seasons), sheds blocks well, is a solid tackler, has gaudy TFL totals (17 in 23/24), and is a toolsy player with high upside. He had a 21.2% pass-rush win rate and an 11.3% run-stop rate in college and is a versatile piece that could be truly explosive in this defensive front.\n\nWhen looking for a true 3-down DT, TJ Sanders checks all the boxes pic.twitter.com/TkfG7pKJvS — Brad (@Graham_SFN) February 11, 2025\n\nRound Two Pick 64- Josaiah Stewart, Edge Rusher, Michigan\n\nStewart has excellent speed, agility, an elite first step, and a plethora of pass-rush moves; swim, chop, etc. He has shown adequate bend getting around the edge, has a high motor to keep pressure on opposing quarterbacks, and has active, violent hands to thwart offensive linemen in his way. He processes offenses quickly. Josaiah can win with outside or inside pass rush moves and has a 16% pressure rate and a 17% run-stop rate tied for best-in-class. The Eagles prefer athletic edge rushers, and while some may think he is small for the position, he could be a perfect fit in Philadelphia.\n\nSep 16, 2024; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA; Philadelphia Eagles defensive end Bryce Huff (0) tackles Atlanta Falcons running back Bijan Robinson (7) after a catch during the second quarter at Lincoln Financial Field.

He exudes body control, is an above-average route runner, creates YAC, breaks tackles, and loves learning. Helm has some of the best hands in class and rarely drops a pass. He is also a film rat who desires to continually improve. He can thrive in the 12 P scheme and always finds a soft spot in coverage. Gunnar uses his body well to shield defenders and excels in space. He is the best run blocker in class!\n\nRound Four Pick 128 Jeffrey Bassa, Linebacker, Oregon\n\nJeffrey was the QB of the defense for Oregon, calling plays for three years. He is an above-average cover LB, using his former skills from being a saftey. Bassa has elite instincts, reads routes with speed, is twitchy, can blitz, and has elite closing speed and footwork. Jeffrey has also been a Gunner on special teams. This year, he was a Senior Bowl show-off! I love fit with the Eagles.\n\nRound Five Pick 162 Hollin Pierce, Offensive Tackle, Rutgers\n\nPierce has the size, height, anchor, and hands the Eagles love to develop. At 6’8 340, he is a roadblock, a mauler, and a vicious finisher. Hollin keeps pockets clean and blows up double teams. He measured the 3rd longest arms and 4th widest wingspan. Pierce is a tough, hard worker and a riser in this draft class at the position! Jeff Stoutland could take Hollin from a relative unknown to All-Pro by the time Lane is ready to hang the cleats up.\n\nFeb 9, 2025; New Orleans, LA, USA; Philadelphia Eagles offensive tackle Jordan Mailata (68) celebrates with Philadelphia Eagles offensive tackle Mekhi Becton (77) after winning Super Bowl LIX at Caesars Superdome.

Williams has shown his elite ball skills with seven interceptions this season at Cal. He is fluid and quick, recognizes routes with ease, and reacts instantly. Nohl also defends the run and tackles well. He is a physical corner too. Williams goes after the ball as if it was thrown to him when it is in the air. He should have a great showing at the combine in Indianapolis and has a chance to improve his stock. He has the talent to be a top-100 player. Adding another ball-hawking, aggressive, athletic, cost-effective corner to coach is desirable with the uncertainty of Slay and others possibly leaving Philly.\n\nRound Five Pick 169- Jalen McLeod, Edge OLB, Auburn\n\nMcLeod has a high motor and a knack for getting to the ball. He frustrates opposing defenses with physicality, think Chauncey Gardner-Johnson. He is versatile and play OLB or put his hand in the dirt as an Edge. Jalen is a menace on the field utilizing his speed, leverage, and eye awareness. He chases down ball carriers as if they stole from him, Playmaker! And why wouldn’t the Eagles want another Jalen on the squad?

Nola has been a longtime partner with Team Red, White, & Blue, a nonprofit organization that aims to support former troops who have returned home from service.\n\nThe charity and efforts are near and dear to Aaron’s heart. “Team Red, White & Blue is a remarkable organization, and I’m thrilled to announce this new charity poker tournament to benefit our veteran community,” said Nola. “It is our hope to raise more than $250,000 for this important cause, and I look forward to joining my teammates, partners and fans for a fun evening at the ballpark on May 15.”\n\nAaron Nola and Kyle Schwarber.

Those events had taken place at Brooklyn Bowl in Philadelphia, and Nola’s friends, family, and teammates joined him for a fun evening of bowling.\n\nThis year, Aaron is switching it up. The team is now going to host a charity poker tournament at the CP Rankin club in Citizens Bank Park. On May 15th, fans, veterans, and members of the Phillies organization will have a chance to play and raise money.\n\n“Aaron Nola’s unwavering commitment to supporting veterans in partnership with Team RWB over the last three years sets a gold standard among elite American athletes,” said Mike Erwin, Founder and Executive Director of Team RWB. “This event will not only raise funds for our mission but will also have a lasting impact by showing a future generation of service members that they will be supported by their nation.”\n\n“Yuengling Brewery is proud to support Team RWB in their work to support America’s Veterans. Their programs and ongoing support align with our interest in supporting the U.S. military and the sacrifices they make to keep our country safe,” said Dick Yuengling, Chief Executive Officer and Owner, D.G. Yuengling & Son, Inc. “Aaron Nola puts on an excellent event to raise additional funds from the community and make more people aware of this great cause. We look forward to joining the Phillies, Aaron, and Team RWB this May to combine efforts and support our nation’s heroes.”\n\nFor more information on how you can attend the event and Team RWB, check out their website: https://teamrwb.org/nola.\n\nPhoto Credit: Jonathan Dyer-Imagn Images",

        "source": "https://metrophiladelphia.com/",
        "content": "Sign up for our email newsletter to stay up-to-date on the latest local sports news throughout Philadelphia.\n\nPhiladelphia Flyers head coach John Tortorella and his wife, Christine Tortorella are incredibly passionate about rescues and animal welfare. The Tortorella’s have “The John and Christine Tortorella Family Foundation,” which features “Bear’s Angels,” is a program that partners with rescues and shelters that help homeless and abused animals. “Enlighten Your World… READ!” also helps with reading and writing skills.\n\nThe Tortorella’s are also passionate about “Hockey & Hounds.” The pair works locally with the Pennsylvania SPCA (PSPCA) and Philadelphia Animal Welfare Society (PAWS) through the Hockey & Hounds program. Each week, Hockey & Hounds features a rescue dog of the week. This week, the pup is an 11-month-old named King! During the Flyers Charities Carnival, the head coach spoke candidly about his love for animals and what inspired him to impact the community.\n\nQ: What got you involved with “Hockey & Hounds?”\n\nJT: “It orginated out in Columbus. Anthony Rothman, who does a radio show out there, we became friends. He does the real stuff, watching out for these dogs. So, as big sports guys, we connected and talked about hockey as long as we talked about animals. That’s the deal we made. Hundreds of dogs were adopted in Columbus in my six years there. Philadelphia is probably the best organization my wife and I have been involved with that understands how badly the causes are needed here to bring awareness.”\n\nQ: For people who can’t adopt (dogs/cats), how else can they get involved in helping the rescues?\n\nJT: “Just to go to the place, to the shelter near you, just to walk a dog. My wife was really into dogs before I met her. She brought to my attention the need. We were in a lockout or strike, so we went to our local shelter and walked dogs all day. There are so many different avenues that people can help with. You don’t want to force people to adopt a dog because it usually returns. If someone honestly doesn’t want a dog or cat, it usually comes back to the shelter.\n\nFlyers head coach John Tortarella meets with the media.\n\nYou can make donations for food. The neatest one is to carve out an hour in a day of your busy week or maybe a few days a week just to let these dogs out to get them out of their cages and let them be dogs. Fostering is a huge part of helping these animals. It allows them to see what home life is and lets them have the personality they have instead of being cooped up in the kennel. It’s not always money. They’re all (rescues) looking for money but just caring. If you care, you’ll find ways to help.”\n\nQ: How many pets do you have?\n\nJT: “We have five rescue dogs and three rescue horses.”\n\nQ: Horses? How did that come about?\n\nJT: “We started in Columbus about nine years ago. We didn’t have a clue what we were doing. With our foundation, we’re all through the country and have different shelters. We ran across this shelter to the south of us from where we lived and became friends with the family. There were a couple of horses that were left for dead in the field. They were starved to death. We had a five-acre farm. They nursed the horses back to where they could stand; they couldn’t even stand. They asked if we could bring them over and let them graze on your grass.”\n\nQ: Were the horses first or the dogs?\n\nJT: “The dogs came first. My wife is passionate about it. It’s her life. She didn’t know what she was getting into. She follows me around with all the jobs I’ve had in hockey, and if it isn’t hockey, it’s rescuing animals. It’s a huge part of our life right now. We loved doing it and met so many great people doing it. It’s so needed. It’s such an emotional rollercoaster when you try to help these animals. You can bring awareness to my platform. The greatest thing about my job is that it’s a platform. It’s not me. It’s just my platform to talk about this. We need help. These animals need help. We’re in all the way and want to help in any way possible.”\n\nAs you can see, John Tortorella is passionate about protecting animals.

        "source": "https://metrophiladelphia.com/",
        "content": "Sign up for our email newsletter to stay up-to-date on the latest local sports news throughout Philadelphia.\n\nPro Football Focus listed a collection of Super Bowl Champion Philadelphia Eagles among the top 101 performances from the 2024-25 NFL season. Eleven Birds were selected, with the six offensive stars barely outpacing the five defenders. Offensive Lineman Jordan Mialata led the way, as he did for Saquon Barkley this season, landing as the third-best player in the NFL according to that publication. If you squint really hard, you can find Super Bowl LIX MVP Jalen Hurts near the end of the text….as the eighth-best NFL QB from the NFL this season.\n\nTwo Top 10 Players in Philadelphia\n\nEven with missing some time due to injury, Mialata still placed in the “bronze medal” position. The massive 6-foot-8 lineman allowed only two sacks this year while having one of the most dominant seasons a lineman has seen since 2006. He was equally effective in pass-blocking and run-blocking, allowing the Australian to earn such high praise from PFF.\n\nDespite being the only 2,500-yard rusher the NFL has ever seen, Saquon Barkley had the tenth-best performance of the season and second-best running back campaign behind Baltimore’s Derrick Henry. His 2,504 total yards smashed Terrell Davis’ combined regular season and postseason rushing mark. Barkley’s elusiveness was a significant factor in the ranking for the running back, described as “the Eagles closer” due to having the most touches, yards, and scores of all NFL running backs in the fourth quarter this season. Has anyone checked if Barkley can toss a baseball? Just checking for some friends in sunny South Florida.\n\nThree More Birds Inside Top 30 NFL Players\n\nFootball – NFL – Super Bowl LIX – Philadelphia Eagles v Kansas City Chiefs – Caesars Superdome, New Orleans, Louisiana, United States – February 9, 2025 Philadelphia Eagles’ Zack Baun celebrates with Josh Sweat after intercepting the ball REUTERS/Mike Segar TPX IMAGES OF THE DAY\n\nBehind Barkley is the publication’s 2024 Breakout Player of the Year, Zach Baun, at Number 11. The free agent signed with Philly on a 1-year “prove it” deal… and well, Baun did that and some, earning his first All-Pro selection with the NFL’s highest-rated linebacker play in 2024. Baun excelled in both facets of the run-and-pass game, leading to a Super Bowl Championship for Philadelphia. Baun’s bet on himself last season should pay out handsomely for the 28-year-old defender this summer.\n\nThe second Eagles lineman lands on the list at #18, thanks to Lane Johnson’s excellence at the tackle position. Johnson had one of the most productive seasons of his career en route to his second Lombardi trophy. Like Mialtata (and Baun), his all-around dominance in the pass-and-run scheme propelled the 34-year-old lineman to the best overall grade of his career. The five-time Pro Bowler allowed only one sack this season, which occurred during the final quarter of the Eagles’ victory over Kansas City in New Orleans.\n\nA.J. Brown marks the first appearance of an Eagles wide receiver in the Top 101. Philly’s pass catcher was the NFL’s best-ranked wideout in 1-0n-1 coverage this season – something that Jalen Hurts utilized brilliantly in the postseason on several occasions. Brown finished with over 1,000 receiving yards for the fifth time in his six-year NFL career. He is signed through 2029 in Philadelphia.\n\nRelated: Eagles WR A.J. Brown supports new OC Kevin Patullo, states changes will need to be made\n\nEagles Rookies Receive Recognition\n\nFootball – NFL – Super Bowl LIX – Philadelphia Eagles v Kansas City Chiefs – Caesars Superdome, New Orleans, Louisiana, United States – February 9, 2025 Philadelphia Eagles’ Cooper DeJean celebrates during the game REUTERS/Mike Segar\n\nCooper DeJean (#45) and Quinyon Mitchell (#78) surprised a bunch of NFL front offices with their seamless transition to the pro level. Everyone in Philadelphia can recall where they were when DeJean returned a Patrick Mahomes pass to the painted turf for a touchdown during Super Bowl LIX. However, Vic Fangio’s defense gained momentum once a healthy DeJean was added to the starting line-up in October. The Eagles lost only one game this season with the rookie in the cornerback slot as he locked down a position that Philadelphia ranked last in at the end of the 2023 season.\n\nSpeaking of locking things down, Eagles’ rookie Quinyon Mitchell (#78) placed sixth among qualifying players in coverage this season… and the second-best rookie behind the guy you just read about, DeJean. The first-round pick out of Toledo erased any doubts anyone had about his ability to perform at the NFL level coming out of a smaller college with a stellar freshman season for Philly. Mitchell was sixth among qualified cornerbacks in coverage this season.\n\nHurts Barely Lands on List at 91\n\nFeb 9, 2025; New Orleans, LA, USA; Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Jalen Hurts (1) warms up before the second half of Super Bowl LIX at Caesars Superdome. Mandatory Credit: Geoff Burke-Imagn Images\n\nThe remaining four Eagles include a QB-protector, a duo of threats to the opposing quarterback, and the Super Bowl MVP-QB himself. Landon Dickerson (#64), Jalen Carter (#77), Milton Williams (#90), and Jalen Hurts (#91) round out the impressive total of Philadelphia football players inside the Top 101.\n\nOn the defensive side of the ball, there was no sophomore slump for Carter as he continued to reward the Eagles selection. The interior defender was rated as the fourth-best pass rusher in their metrics, with a 13% win rate when attacking the opposing QB during the 2024 season. Teammate Milton Williams cranked it up in the postseason as PFF’s best-graded pass rusher en route to becoming a household name with a strip sack of Mahomes in the fourth quarter of the Super Bowl win.\n\nHurts might not have been on the list without a strong offseason performance. The publication claimed the late entry for Hurts (and Milton Williams) was “due to exceptional performances in the postseason.” Three turnovers in three months since the Eagles’ October bye week only go so far in this economy, folks. No matter, as Nike said, “Love Hurts,” and Philly’s star QB will continue to try to prove the doubters wrong.\n\nMandatory Credit: Bill Streicher-Imagn Images",

        "source": "https://metrophiladelphia.com/",
        "content": "Sign up for our Gay City News email newsletter to get news, updates, and local insights delivered straight to your inbox!\n\nEric McGinty’s “Stockade,” made in 2023, has only screened at two film festivals prior to its arrival on VOD. Given the amount of gatekeeping that goes on behind the scenes, that’s not necessarily a sign of its lack of quality. In this case, it turns out to be one. “Stockade” displays technical incompetence in acting, writing, and editing, stretching out a story that might fill a 20-minute short to a painfully elongated 88 minutes. If it were a student film, that’d be one thing, but as a work sent out into the world by a director with another feature and two shorts under his belt, it’s an embarrassment.\n\nAhlam (out actor Sarah Bitar) is lying in bed when she receives a call from her mother in Lebanon. The artist is now trying to make a go of life in Brooklyn, but she has difficulty earning a living. She works as a babysitter to an Arab-American child, whose mother insists Ahlam speak to her in Arabic. Paul (cinematographer Guy de Lancey), who has been injured in a recent accident and now needs a cane, offers her a well-paying job. Since he can’t leave his apartment, he asks her to travel upstate to a house in Kingston with a package. For all the errand’s mystery, he assures her she’s not being used as a drug mule. When she arrives at the house, she opens the package and finds artwork from Iraq. Richard (McGinty) arrives to collect it, promising he’ll return the next day. He does not show up. Instead, a couple confront Ahlam. The man gives her a bottle of water laced with drugs, and once she passes out, the two kidnap her.\n\nMany of the basic elements of filmmaking grammar become far more visible in their absence. “Stockade” is not an experimental film. It would love to be a thriller, but its editing and writing generate no tension. In fact, its cuts are subtly jarring, making for a grating experience. Why does it take its eye away from two women’s conversation to insert a brief shot of a pool of carp? Why does a shot-reverse shot sequence going back and forth between people in the room look as though the lighting and cinematography are far different for each person? Why didn’t McGinty recognize that the color grading needed to be done carefully, so that these shots match each other? Full of unintended awkwardness, most dialogue scenes exist solely to drop a piece of information, supposedly pushing the narrative forward. The script may as well be the product of an AI who has never actually heard two people engaged in small talk.\n\nBitar’s performance leaves her character’s emotions barely visible. After being drugged, kidnapped, escaping and returning home to Brooklyn, Ahlam shows few signs of these events’ long-term impact. In real life, she would probably be more tense meeting a stranger alone in her studio afterwards. “Stockade” never establishes the time frame of these events. Do weeks or months go by between her escape and her return to a painter’s life back in Brooklyn?\n\nFor a film based around the struggle to stay our of poverty and retain a visa to stay in the US, it can’t create an aura of danger. (Mc Ginty describes it as an “immigrant film noir,” stating his desire to center “characters and situations that are under-represented in most mainstream films.”) Even the kidnappers are as polite and unthreatening as they could possibly be. While the precariousness of an immigrant’s life is part of the story, it never feels truly inhabited. Nor is there the slightest anger behind the references to America’s wars in the Middle East and the history of looting antiquities for Western museums. It’s all just a story, badly told.\n\n“Stockade” | Directed by Eric McGinty | In English and Arabic and French with English subtitles | Freestyle Digital Media | Available on VOD Feb. 25th",

A mis-hit by Quinn Sullivan sent the ball out to Pedro Gallese’s right and into the path of Kai Wagner, who sent a low, fizzing cross through the 6-yard box where Tai Baribo was waiting to tap the ball in and level the game at 1.\n\nThe first goal of the Bradley Carnell era came from the exact type of soccer we’ve been told we’re going to see this season. High, relentless pressure when the other team is in possession, and then quick and direct passes that lead to goals in transition once turning the other team over. Despite going down early, Carnell stuck to his game plan, and the team was rewarded once they found their footing.\n\nImage Credit: Philadelphia Union\n\nGazdag Gives Union the Lead\n\nNow on level terms and with a pep-talk from the new manager at the break, Union came out of the second half absolutely flying. In the 48th minute, with the ball along the left sideline, Quinn Sullivan lofted a picturesque pass that curled to the far post and fell perfectly into the path of an outstretched Daniel Gazdag’s right foot.\n\nGazdag, getting the perfect touch on the ball from Sullivan, neatly re-directed the ball passed Gallese’s near-post and into the back of the net, giving Union their first lead of the Bradley Carnell era. Quinn Sullivan, who played a big role in creating the first goal, gets credited with an assist on the goal by Gazdag. A great start to the 2025 season for Quinn.\n\nImage Credit: Philadelphia Union\n\nUhre Extends Union’s Lead\n\nWhen playing it out of the back goes wrong! Just 3 minutes after Gazdag’s goal, Orlando City’s Rodrigo Schlegel mishandled a back-pass that sat perfectly for a pressing Mikael Uhre.\n\nUhre stepped onto the ball and hit it with his first touch at the top of the penalty arch, beating Gallese and jumping Union out to a 3-1 lead early in the 2nd half.\n\nImage Credit: Philadelphia Union\n\nBaribo Brace Seals First Win of Bradley Carnell Era\n\nIn the 64th minute and with a 3-1 lead, 19-year-old Frankie Westfield received the ball along the right side of the pitch and darted forward with conviction. After collecting a failed first attempt at a cross into the box, Westfield, with his right foot, sent a second ball through the penalty area, which was put in the back of the net by the first-touch of Tai Baribo, his 2nd goal of the game, and his 18th goal in his previous 23 games across all competitions for Union.\n\nThe assist was the first of Westfield’s MLS career and comes as the “cherry on top” of his MLS debut. Still just 19 and able to play either outside back position, Frankie Westfield looks set to log some minutes behind Kai Wagner and Nate Harriel this season and should now bring some extra confidence to the pitch whenever he’s called upon next.\n\nImage Credit: Philadelphia Union\n\nPašalić Puts In Consolation Goal\n\nIn the 79th minute and down 4-1, Orlando City’s Marco Pašalić notched his 2nd goal of the night and his MLS career after a couple of shot attempts rang the post and Union failed to clear the area. The goal didn’t mean anything for the result at the end of the day, but veteran Keeper Andre Blake surely wasn’t happy with young defender Olwethu Makhanya’s positioning and spectatorship on the play and gave him a bit of an earful, which I’m sure is a bit easier for Makhanya to swallow after a 4-2 win.\n\nImage Credit: Philadelphia Union\n\nQuotes from Carnell\n\nAfter the opening goal from Orlando inside the first 10 minutes, a lot of Union fans were probably having that “here we go again” feeling. But Bradley Carnell’s team stuck to the game plan, got themselves level, made a few tweaks at half-time, and absolutely shell-shocked Orlando in the final 45 minutes of the game.\n\n“For them to come out and be challenged here in this game was kind of a microcosm of the whole pre-season. We go a goal down, and then we’re chasing a little bit, we lose our structure, and then coming out of the 2nd half after correcting one or two things and then all of a sudden you can change the picture in a million ways and we did do that in transition, we really did exactly what we wanted to do from the beginning of the game.” – Philadelphia Union Head Coach, Bradley Carnell\n\nLet’s be honest here. I’m not sure anyone, maybe even Bradley Carnell, could have predicted a 4-1 win on the road in the opening game of the season. It’s a great start to a new era of Union soccer, and while Carnell knows they need to continue growing and getting better, he’s seeing lots of things to like about his team, and he’s happy to see them rewarded on Saturday night.\n\n“We left that Montreal [pre-season] game last week feeling very confident and very happy the way the pre-season ended. So I’m excited they could put it on display tonight, but I’m more just happy for the group. I’ve asked a lot of them, they’ve committed to me, we’ve had some great energy, we’ve done a lot of things off the field and reestablished some foundational standings within our group now, and I think you could see that togetherness today.” – Bradley Carnell\n\nImage Credit: Philadelphia Union\n\nMatch Highlights\n\nBe sure to return to Philly Sports Network for more Philadelphia Union and other soccer content!\n\nFollow our Union team on Twitter:\n\nTim Lovenguth | Jimmy King | Paul Frenzel\n\nNate Tennesen | Eric Frysinger\n\nSteve Beavon | Liam Jenkins\n\nDoop on Union fans!\n\nFeatured Image Credit: Philadelphia Union",

Matchday 1 saw 46 goals scored throughout Saturday and Sunday, kicking off an electric start to MLS’ 30th season. The 46 goals scored over the weekend were the most ever in MLS history in the opening week.\n\nAlong with a record-breaking goals record, a new club made its debut. San Diego FC, the 30th MLS club, beat defending champions LA Galaxy 2-0 in their debut.\n\nImage Credit: Apple\n\nHere are some of the top highlights from a thrilling opening week in MLS\n\nUnion take down Orlando City in Bradley Carnell’s debut\n\nThe Philadelphia Union rolled into Inter&Co Stadium to face Orlando City and left with three points in the bag. New Union manager Bradley Carnell’s debut was worthwhile as the Union took down Orlando, 4-2.\n\nTai Baribo scored the Union’s first goal in the 23′ and added a brace in the 64′. Daniel Gazdag scored in the 48′ and Mikael Uhre in the 51′.\n\nFour players also made their MLS debuts for the Union. Frankie Westfield, Olwethu Makhanya, Ian Glavinovich, and Jovan Lukic made their opening appearances for The Boys in Blue. Westfield, a homegrown product, tallied an assist on Baribo’s second goal of the game.\n\nThe Union made a few mistakes, most notably on defense, but Carnell’s high-pressing system took advantage of Orlando.\n\nSan Diego stuns LA Galaxy in club debut\n\nIn the club’s MLS debut, San Diego FC defeated the reigning MLS Cup Champions LA Galaxy on their home turf.\n\nAnders Dreyer scored a brace (52′, 90+3′) to give San Diego its first three points. San Diego became the third MLS expansion team since 2017 to win its opening match. San Diego’s supporter section was rocking in LA, showing the excitement and passion the fans have for their new club.\n\nMiami scores in the 90+10′ to draw against NYCFC\n\nThe 2024 Supporters’ Shield winners Inter Miami picked up one point in a 2-2 draw against NYCFC. Miami picked up an early lead in the first half until NYCFC scored two consecutive goals.\n\nTomas Aviles, who scored for Miami in the 5′, was given a red card in the 23′. Miami would be down to just 10 men for the remainder of the game. In the 10 minutes of added stoppage time in the second half, Telasco Segovia equalized the game for Miami so they could walk away with one point. Lionel Messi threaded a through ball to Segovia, who added the tying goal in his MLS debut. Messi assisted on both of Miami’s goals in the draw.\n\nSan Jose blanks Salt Lake City, 4-0\n\nLast season, the San Jose Earthquakes finished with the least amount of points in the whole league with 21. After some offseason changes, they came out of the gates firing against Salt Lake City en route to a 4-0 win.\n\nJamar Ricketts, Rodrigues, Ousseni Bouda, and Vitor Costa added goals in San Jose’s win. San Jose head coach Bruce Arena joined Bob Bradley as the only coaches in league history to win a game with at least five different MLS clubs.\n\nAfter the addition of Arenas and other offseason moves, better days are ahead for San Jose.\n\nLathe propels Atlanta United over CF Montréal\n\nEmmanuel Latte Lath arrived at Atlanta United from EFL Championship side Middlesbrough FC earlier this month on an MLS record $22 million transfer fee. In his MLS debut, he added a brace (42′, 63′) for Atlanta in a 3-2 win. 65,520 fans also attended the match at Mercedes-Benz Stadium on Saturday, making it the third-highest-attended match globally.\n\nEdwin Mosquera broke the 2-2 tie in the 85′ to give Atlanta three points. Miguel Almiron, who rejoined Atlanta this offseason from Newcastle United, assisted on Mosquera’s winning goal.\n\nMLS Standings: Matchday 1\n\nMLS Eastern Conference Standings\n\nColumbus Crew – 3 pts\n\nPhiladelphia Union – 3 pts\n\nAtlanta United – 3 pts\n\nFC Cincinnati – 3 pts\n\nCharlotte FC – 1 pt\n\nD.C.

The Sixers are coming off a buzzer-beater loss to the Brooklyn Nets on Saturday night, while the Bulls were beaten by the Suns on the same day. The Sixers are in the midst of a seven-game losing streak, while the Bulls are riding a six-game losing streak of their own.\n\nSixers game information\n\nWho: Chicago Bulls (22-35) at Philadelphia 76ers (20-36)\n\nWhen: 7 p.m. EST\n\nWhere: Wells Fargo Center, Philadelphia, PA\n\nWatch: NBC Sports Network, NBA League Pass\n\nLatest on the Sixers\n\nThe Sixers are playing in the midst of a dilemma or several dilemmas. On the one hand, they trailed the Bulls by just a game and a half for 10th place in the conference and a spot in the tournament. Win, and they’re one step closer to the postseason. But, if the Sixers continue to lose, they’re currently holding the sixth-worst record in the league, and if the balls bounce right, they’d be able to hold on to the protected pick that they sent the Thunder as part of the Al Horford trade a few years back.\n\nThen you have the other issues. In addition to Jared McCain, the potential rookie of the year, being lost for the season a few months back, the Sixers have been hit with injuries to every player on the roster at some point this season.\n\nFor Philadelphia, the biggest issue is Joel Embiid‘s knee, which reportedly swollen after the Nets game. Embiid will miss the game tonight and potentially move forward more as the Sixers, and he is considering consulting with various doctors.\n\nPHILADELPHIA, PENNSYLVANIA – FEBRUARY 11: Joel Embiid #21 of the Philadelphia 76ers looks down against the Toronto Raptors in the second half at the Wells Fargo Center on February 11, 2025 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

(Photo by Mitchell Leff/Getty Images)\n\nPaul George, the team’s big free agent signing, is getting regular injections in his injured hand just to be able to suit up. The team will also miss Kyle Lowry, Eric Gordon, and rookie Justin Edwards for the game.\n\nIn addition to the injuries the team has faced, the shooting from the field has been abysmal, and three-point attempts have been even worse. The rotations have been questionable, and the team has, save for a few players, looked disinterested in being on the court. The Sixers face a lot of questions with 26 games left to play in the regular season, and this time of year isn’t the best for facing that many issues.\n\nLatest on the Bulls\n\nThe Bulls started the month of February in 10th place in the Eastern Conference. They have gone 1-7 during the month and are currently in, wait for it, 10th place. That should tell you all you need to know about the East this season, but the Bulls, after trading away Zach LaVine at the deadline, have looked just like you’d expect them to look.\n\nAfter the trade of LaVine, the team’s top two players are Nikola Vucevic and Coby White, who just happen to be listed as questionable for the game against the Sixers. With forward Patrick Williams already out with a knee injury and Jalen Smith out with a concussion, the Bulls seem to be in the same position as the Sixers.\n\nFeb 22, 2025; Chicago, Illinois, USA; Chicago Bulls forward Matas Buzelis (14) goes up for a dunk against the Phoenix Suns during the first half at United Center. Mandatory Credit: David Banks-Imagn Images\n\nWhile Josh Giddy has played very well this season, if the team is missing Vucevic and White, then they’ll be down to Giddy and Lonzo Ball to carry the weight against the Sixers. At this point in the season, it’s anyone guess as to what will happen. The team could be looking at Ball, Kevin Huerter, Matas Buzelis, Giddey and Julian Phillips starting tonight and that doesn’t put them in a very good position to win.\n\nWhat to watch for tonight\n\nUnfortunately, tonight, the Sixers will likely be chucking up three-pointers as if they’re in a contest and not hitting many, as has been their offensive system throughout the season. These days, anything over 28% on their long-distance attempts is counted as a good shooting night for the team.\n\nFeb 11, 2025; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA; Philadelphia 76ers guard Quentin Grimes (5) shoots the ball against Toronto Raptors forward Chris Boucher (25) in the second quarter at Wells Fargo Center. Mandatory Credit: Kyle Ross-Imagn Images\n\nWhat they will have is Tyrese Maxey, Paul George, Kelly Oubre Jr., Guerschon Yabusele, Quentin Grimes, and Ricky Council IV to lean on, which should be enough to take down the Bulls. The team can get out and run, generating better shots and hopefully a good shooting game. With the Bulls being shorthanded as well, tonight would be a good night for Maxey, Oubre Jr., and George to all get a few steals each and play a better defensive game than we’ve seen over the past two games.\n\nOnly time will tell which team wants it more. The “it” is the higher draft pick or 10th seed in the playoffs. Which one each team is striving for remains to be seen.\n\nPrediction\n\nSixers 114 – Bulls 103",

Mandatory Credit: Kyle Ross-Imagn Images\n\nIt’s been a running thought by fans and even national media members that Embiid should simply have the surgery and prepare for next season ever since first mentioned the idea. The only problem is that this supposed surgery may not even exist.\n\nThere are many types of knee injuries, multiple that involve the meniscus as well. Simply put, it all depends on what is actually wrong with his knee. Is it a matter of debris or another tear? Neither of those possibilities has been reported or even hinted at. Is it a matter of Embiid having virtually or literally no more cartilage in his knee? Considering his injury history, this seems far more likely. However, there is no clear surgical option in this case.\n\nNov 20, 2024; Memphis, Tennessee, USA; Philadelphia 76ers center Joel Embiid (21) limps to the bench during a time out during the second half against the Memphis Grizzlies at FedExForum. Mandatory Credit: Petre Thomas-Imagn Images\n\nMicrofracture surgery has proven time and time again to hurt more than it’s helped for NBA players. Without a tear, there is no ability to perform a meniscus repair surgery, nor is there a point to another meniscectomy in that case.\n\nOne frequently suggested surgery is known by some as the Lonzo Ball surgery; to many more, it’s known as a meniscal allograft transplantation or meniscus transplant. While the early results are somewhat positive for Ball, the difference between Ball and Embiin in both age and body size provides significantly different — less positive — optics for recovery.\n\nWhatever the Sixers and Embiid jointly decide, they will need to put a lot of man-hours into their research. With 26 games left this season and the Sixers currently being 16 games below .500, this is as clear a sign as any to waive the white flag on Joel Embiid’s season, barring some miracle cure.\n\nFor the latest breaking news on your Philadelphia 76ers and other Philly sports, follow Zach Ciavolella on X — @CiavoNBA and Bluesky — @ciavo.bsky.social",

        "content": "Feb 22, 2025; Lakeland, Florida, USA; Philadelphia Phillies third base Alec Bohm (28) rounds second base during the third inning against the Detroit Tigers at Publix Field at Joker Marchant Stadium. Mandatory Credit: Mike Watters-Imagn Images\n\nSign up for our email newsletter to stay up-to-date on the latest local sports news throughout Philadelphia.\n\nSpring Training Baseball is upon us as the Philadelphia Phillies have completed the first two games of their 2025 Spring Training slate. The Phillies dropped both contests to the Detroit Tigers and the Baltimore Orioles by respective scores of 7-6 and 6-1.\n\nFour Phillies slugged home runs over the first two games while several big leaguers began to get their reps in as well.\n\nHow the Games Progressed\n\nThe first bit of Spring Training action came a short drive away in Lakeland, Fla., against the Tigers. After a scoreless first two frames, Cal Stevenson notched the first base hit of the Spring for the Phillies, a double into left field. The first baserunner then became the first run scored as Johan Rojas fought off a slider inside to bring in Stevenson. Following a walk from Bryson Stott and an Alec Bohm single, Max Kepler batted in two of his new teammates on a single of his own to give the Phillies a 3-0 lead.\n\nKepler worked a walk in his next plate appearance, putting a runner on base for Buddy Kennedy as he slugged the Phillies’ first home run of the spring. Weston Wilson had earned the honor both of the previous two springs but was recently shut down for six weeks due to a strained oblique.\n\nThe Phillies notched one more run on the day, a solo home run from Josh Breaux, a catcher who the Phillies picked up last year after he was released by the New York Yankees.\n\nThe Phillies did drop the game 7-6, but none of the pitchers who appeared in the contest project to make the Phillies’ Opening Day roster.\n\nFeb 22, 2025; Lakeland, Florida, USA; Philadelphia Phillies catcher Rafael Marchn (13) bats during the second inning against the Detroit Tigers at Publix Field at Joker Marchant Stadium. Mandatory Credit: Mike Watters-Imagn Images\n\nIn Sunday’s home opener against the Orioles, the Phillies found themselves down quickly. Tyler Phillips, who recorded seven starts with the Phillies in 2024, allowed three runs over two innings against the Orioles.\n\nThe Orioles picked up four additional runs over the course of the fourth, fifth, seventh, and ninth innings against pitchers Kyle Tyler, John McMillon, Tristan Barnett, and Cody Stashak.\n\nIn proper Philadelphia style, the long ball was the source of much of the Phillies’ offense. Christian Arroyo slugged a solo shot onto the left field concourse in the bottom of the third.\n\nA few innings later, in the bottom of the seventh, prospect Justin Crawford slipped a single through a defensive shift before Gabriel Rincones Jr. hit a two-run shot over the berm in right center field.\n\nOverall, the Phillies dropped the contest 7-3.\n\nTakeaways from Phillies Early Start\n\nEvery player that steps onto the diamond wants to win on any given day, but Spring Training has no weight to wins and losses whatsoever. The important thing is allowing players to get work in, figure out position battles, and stay healthy throughout the process.\n\nThe most interesting players to follow after the first two games are Buddy Kennedy and Cal Stevenson. Both will battle for what is likely the final roster spot, a backup outfield/utility position. Both players are 1-for-4 thus far with an extra base hit, a run scored, and a walk. Kennedy’s hit went a lot further, but Stevenson has plenty of time to make his case. Following Wilson’s injury, the battle will likely come down to Kennedy, Stevenson, and Kody Clemens, all of whom saw time in the big leagues in 2024. Clemens is 1-for-2 thus far.\n\nAlec Bohm, Johan Rojas, Nick Castellanos, Brandon Marsh, Kyle Schwarber, Bryson Stott, and Edmundo Sosa have all seen action thus far for the Phillies. Phillips is the only familiar face to pitch for the Phillies in the first two contests.\n\nTop prospects Aidan Miller and Justin Crawford made appearances in both games over the weekend. The pair are likely to not make an impact at the Major League level this season, but they have the potential to be cornerstone pieces of the Phillies’ lineup for years to come.\n\nFeb 22, 2025; Lakeland, Florida, USA; Philadelphia Phillies outfielder Cal Stevenson (47) catches a fly ball during the first inning against the Detroit Tigers at Publix Field at Joker Marchant Stadium.

Animal welfare groups rescued a dozen horses from the property – several of which were injured – along with a pig and a goat.\n\nSurveillance video distributed by the PPD on Monday shows a man walking in the area moments before flames emerged from the pop-up stable.\n\nPolice described the suspect as a white man with a thin build who was wearing dark-colored pants, a gray long sleeve shirt and a black hat. Anyone with information is asked to contact the City Wide Arson Task Force at 215-783-1092 or call or text the police tip line, 215-686-TIPS (8477).\n\nThe Pennsylvania SPCA is caring for the horses that survived the fire, while ACCT Philly took custody of the goat and pig.\n\nACCT Philly, the city’s animal care and control provider, said in a Facebook post last week that it “appears the stable was operating as a business and people were boarding their horses at the property.”\n\nThe organization said citations were issued Feb. 16 following a visit to the site, and that ACCT Philly was working with the city to address the situation. Philadelphia residents are permitted to own horses but are supposed to go through a licensing process.",

The gang’s motto: “If you want to join the Senders, get a body, then you gang with us,” according to Assistant DA Adam Faraye. ‘Getting a body’ refers to the act of killing someone.\n\n“The Senders are not quite gone, but they’re close,” DA Larry Krasner said at Friday’s news conference. “They’re very close.”\n\nMost of the violence occurred between 5th and 9th streets from Snyder to Oregon avenues; however, incidents connected to the Senders, and their feuds with other groups, were reported as far away as Lawncrest and Germantown.\n\nTaahir Rowe, 20, is facing murder charges for the January 2022 ambush shooting of 16-year-old Mehki Ingram on the 800 block of June Street in West Philadelphia’s Mill Creek neighborhood. Ingram died after several days in the hospital.\n\nOne of the other suspects, 19-year-old Eli Simmons, is being accused of participating in 10 shootings that left 16 people injured over the span of about 16 months in 2022 and 2023. Faraye said Simmons was being detained on $12.5 million bail.\n\nProsecutors said that, as part of the gang feud, three gunmen opened fire in February 2023 on a group of teenagers gathered on the 3100 block of Norris Street in Strawberry Mansion. The gunfire struck a mother and her 2-year-old daughter as they crossed the street, and five teens were injured.\n\nOther outbursts involving the Senders included three separate South Philadelphia triple shootings in January 2022 on the 700 block of Ritner Street; in April 2023 at 22nd and Wolf streets; and in May 2023 on the 600 block of Oregon Avenue, authorities said.\n\nElante Outerbridge, 17, is charged with nine counts of attempted murder in relation to the seven-victim incident and a shooting several months earlier in Southwest Philadelphia, according to the DA’s Office.\n\nHe is among the youngest defendants included in the bust, having been just 15 years old at the time of the two shootings. Most of the suspects were under 18 at the height of the gang warfare.\n\n“A lot of these young kids think it’s a game,” said PPD Detective Kelley Gallagher, who worked on the case. “On social media, they compare it to a basketball game. And how that works is, for every shooting victim, they say they have a point.”",

Workers will receive roughly eight months of salary if they accept the offer, the Associated Press reported.\n\nRELATED: Federal worker buyout deadline: What we know about the deferred resignation program\n\nThis buyout is led by Elon Musk, one of President Donald Trump’s advisers, who has organized a financial incentive for workers to leave their government jobs by offering several months of pay in exchange for their resignation, the Associated Press reported.\n\nHow many government workers are there?\n\nBy the numbers:\n\nThe federal government employs over 3 million people, accounting for 1.9% of the nation’s entire civilian workforce, the Associated Press reported, citing the Pew Research Center. The civilian workforce is about 2.4 million, not including the U.S. Postal Service employees and active-duty military.\n\nAlmost 20% of federal workers are in Washington, D.C., Maryland, and Virginia. California has 147,500 federal employees, but it's less than 1% of total nonfarming employees in the state, the AP noted. Texas has 130,000 federal workers, but that accounts for less than 1% of nonfarming jobs there and Florida has 94,000.",

Her video has gotten more than 6 million views as of Sunday, with both supporters and nonbelievers commenting.\n\nWhat they're saying:\n\n\"The way I would instantly feel safer on that flight,\" one man said in response to the video. \"There is a thin line between faith and fear,\" another commented.\n\nSalter posted a subsequent video saying she had no idea her video would garner so many views, but she particularly wanted to answer a repeated question she was getting from social media users.\n\n\"I actually get the oil from my church,\" she explained. \"My stepfather is a pastor, and he prayed over the oil and passed it out to the congregation.\"\n\nShe said she keeps some bottles of oil at her home and in her purse.\n\n\"Happened to have one right before the trip and, of course, with some of these planes that's been crashing and some weird stuff that's going on, I just wanted to pray for it and get everybody here safe,\" she said. \"God kept us safe. God kept us covered, and the devil is a liar.\"\n\nSalter did the same thing on the plane for her return flight to Florida on Feb. 20.\n\nJetBlue did not immediately respond to a FOX Business request for comment.\n\nThe backstory:\n\nThe videos come after some high-profile aviation incidents in recent weeks.\n\nOn Jan. 29, American Airlines Flight 5342 collided with a U.S. Army helicopter, killing all 67 onboard when the two aircraft plunged into the Potomac River.\n\nTwo days later, a medical jet crashed in Philadelphia, killing six who were onboard and one person in a car, while injuring dozens of others.\n\nOn Feb. 6, a small commuter plane went down in Alaska, killing 10 people.\n\nOn Feb. 17, Delta Connection Flight 4819, operated by Endeavor Air, crashed while landing at Toronto Pearson Airport. No fatalities were reported, though 21 people were injured, including three who were critically wounded. The flight had departed from Minneapolis–St. Paul Airport earlier that day.\n\nFOX Business' Andrea Margolis contributed to this report.\n\nSTAY CONNECTED WITH FOX 35 ORLANDO:",

        "content": "The Brief Shapiro said that $2 billion identified as either frozen or held up by an unspecified review was now accessible to state agencies. The Pennsylvania governor sued in federal court on February 13. Trump administration lawyers have argued that the government’s move to freeze funds was legal.\n\n\n\nPennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro said Monday that President Donald Trump ’s administration has freed up billions in federal aid that the Democrat had accused it of withholding illegally and unconstitutionally.\n\nWhat we know:\n\nShapiro said in a news conference that more than $2 billion that his administration had identified as either frozen or held up by an unspecified review was now accessible to state agencies.\n\nShapiro sued in federal court over the aid on Feb. 13, after federal courts had repeatedly rejected the Trump administration’s sweeping pause on federal funding and questioned whether the Trump administration was ignoring court orders.\n\nShapiro also said he pressed his case in conversations with senior Trump administration officials while he was in Washington, D.C., over the weekend. The U.S. attorney's office in Philadelphia, which represents the federal agencies named in the lawsuit, declined comment Monday.\n\nDig deeper:\n\nIn federal court in Rhode Island, Trump administration lawyers, however, have argued that the government's move to freeze funds was legal and asked a judge to reject a request by nearly two dozen Democratic states for a preliminary injunction.\n\nAdministration lawyers characterized the freeze as simply a \"pause\" to consider how best to use federal funds. They contended the case was moot since the Office of Management and Budget had rescinded its memo in late January freezing federal grants and loans.\n\nMuch of the stalled grant funding identified by Shapiro's administration was passed by Congress in signature laws signed by former President Joe Biden, including his landmark 2022 climate law, the Inflation Reduction Act, and his 2021 infrastructure law.\n\nThe lawsuit had said aid was being withheld from programs that distribute money to upgrade energy efficiency in homes, plug abandoned gas wells, clean up abandoned mine land, improve municipal water and sewer systems and reimburse industry for cutting their planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nFive federal agencies were named as defendants: the White House Office of Management and Budget, the Environmental Protection Agency and the departments of Interior and Transportation.\n\nNone have commented on the lawsuit, except for the Department of Energy, which said it was complying with the court orders. However, the department didn’t say whether it had released funding that Shapiro’s administration accused it of holding up.",

        "source": "https://www.fox29.com/",
        "content": "article\n\nThe Brief The Trump administration is eliminating at least 1,600 USAID positions and placing most remaining staff on leave. A federal judge ruled in favor of the administration’s plan, rejecting employee lawsuits to block the cuts. Workers abroad will keep access to agency systems and emergency communication tools, but many are stranded without clear guidance. A separate judge has temporarily stopped the administration from withholding foreign aid, ordering some funding to be restored.\n\n\n\nThe Trump administration moved its fast-paced dismantling of the U.S. Agency for International Development toward what appeared to be its final phases, telling all but a fraction of staffers worldwide that they were on leave as of Monday and notifying at least 1,600 of the U.S.-based staffers they were being fired.\n\nThe move was the latest and one of the biggest steps in what President Donald Trump and cost-cutting ally Elon Musk say is their goal of gutting the six-decade-old aid and development agency in a broader campaign to slash the size of the federal government.\n\nMore federal layoffs\n\nThe backstory:\n\nIt comes after a federal judge on Friday allowed the administration to move forward with pulling thousands of USAID staffers off the job in the United States and around the world. U.S. District Judge Carl Nichols rejected pleas that came in a lawsuit from employees to keep temporarily blocking the government’s plan.\n\n\"As of 11:59 p.m. EST on Sunday, February 23, 2025, all USAID direct hire personnel, with the exception of designated personnel responsible for mission-critical functions, core leadership and/or specially designated programs, will be placed on administrative leave globally,\" according to the notices sent to USAID workers and viewed by The Associated Press.\n\nCiting a big concern for workers stationed overseas who have reported being cut off from government communications, the notices say that \"USAID is committed to keeping its overseas personnel safe. Until they return home, personnel will retain access to Agency systems and to diplomatic and other resources.\"\n\nRelated article\n\nThe administration said employees put on leave overseas are expected to receive \"voluntary Agency-funded return travel\" and other benefits.\n\nNichols, who was nominated by Trump, said he had been \"very concerned\" about workers in high-risk areas left overseas without access to emergency communications. But he said he has since been reassured by the administration that workers would still have access to two-way radios that allow 24–7 communications in emergencies, as well as a phone app with a \"panic button.\"\n\nThe judge said the government’s statements persuaded him \"that the risk posed to USAID employees who are placed on administrative leave while stationed abroad — if there is any — is far more minimal than it initially appeared.\"\n\nBig picture view:\n\nThe notices of firings and leaves come on top of hundreds of USAID contractors receiving no-name form letters of termination over the weekend, according to copies that AP viewed.\n\nThe blanket nature of the notification letters to USAID contractors, excluding the names or positions of those receiving it, could make it difficult for the dismissed workers to get unemployment benefits, workers noted.\n\nA different judge in a second lawsuit tied to the dismantling of USAID has temporarily blocked the freeze on foreign assistance and said this past week that the administration had kept withholding the aid despite his court order and must at least temporarily restore the funding to programs worldwide.\n\nUSAID’s notice Sunday said it was \"committed to keeping its overseas personnel safe\" and pledged not to cut off USAID staffers abroad from agency systems and other support.\n\nWhat is USAID?\n\nDig deeper:\n\nUSAID offers assistance to countries recovering from disasters, trying to escape poverty, and engaging in democratic reforms, including war-torn Gaza and West Africa also recovering from years of vicious wars. The U.S. is by far the world’s largest donor of humanitarian aid, with USAID administering billions of dollars in humanitarian, development and security assistance in more than 100 countries.\n\nPresident John F. Kennedy created the organization at the height of the Cold War to counter Soviet influence. Congress passed the Foreign Assistance Act in 1961, and Kennedy signed that law and an executive order establishing USAID as an independent agency.\n\nThe U.S. spends less than 1% of its budget on foreign assistance, a smaller share overall than some other nations.",

        "content": "Yes, the Philadelphia 76ers played without two-time NBA scoring champion and the always-injured Joel Embiid. Yes, they haven't been a playoff contender this season, even with two other All-Stars in the starting lineup.\n\nYet, there it was, on the scoreboard, on all the social media derision, on the top of the implausibility-meter when the 76ers broke camp for the Bahamas.\n\nThat was no misprint on the ticker in the fourth quarter: Bulls 136, 76ers 86.\n\nDown 50!\n\nWhat they're saying:\n\nDid the Sixers quit? Do the Sixers realize — with or without whatever Embiid and his balky left knee can give them — their season is over?\n\n\"I don't want to believe that,\" nine-time All-Star Paul George said. \"I don't sense that in the locker room and I don't believe that.\"\n\nGeorge has little choice publicly but to stand by the Sixers, even as they lost their eighth straight game and 10th of 11 overall — 142-110 on Monday night to the 23-win Chicago Bulls — and see even the odds of a play-in tournament berth dip to the point where fans are already looking at next season.\n\nNot that it promises anything better than the mess that's unraveled in South Philly this year.\n\n\"I'm not quite sure what fell apart to give up 140 points, at home, against the Chicago Bulls,\" George said.\n\nEmbiid sits again\n\nThe real bad news — you know, before six Bulls scored at least 15 points — came hours ahead of this debacle when the Sixers offered no real update on Embiid. Embiid missed his 38th game of the season for the sagging Sixers, and all options — from rest to potential surgery to playing through pain — remain on the table, depending on the results of continued testing and imaging.\n\nEmbiid has played in just 19 of 57 games for the Sixers, who fell to 20-37 an have only a faint shot at earning a berth in the NBA play-in tournament. Embiid has averaged 23.8 points — he averaged at least 30 and won two scoring titles the last three seasons — and scored only 29 points combined in his last two games.\n\n\"I don’t think anybody envisioned it going like this,\" coach Nick Nurse said. \"It’s disappointing on a lot of levels. He wants to play. We want him to play. Our best version is of with him playing. It hasn’t worked out like that. Yet.\"\n\nThe 76ers are a franchise in turmoil and suffering through an internal tug-of-war when it comes to Embiid. Can he play through the pain and should he, even with the woeful record? Why not just shut him down and try again next year?\n\nEven George — who left the Los Angeles Clippers to sign a four-year, $212 million free-agent contract — conceded the juice might not be worth the squeeze when it comes to a potential Embiid return. The 76ers are one of the worst teams in the league and are trending closer to Toronto, Charlotte, Washington and a lottery pick than making a serious run in the postseason.\n\nMaybe sitting Embiid is for the best — just as it was seemingly was early in the Process.\n\nWhat's next:\n\nThe 76ers’ first-round pick is top-six protected or else it goes to the Oklahoma City Thunder, perhaps one more reason the Sixers could shut down Embiid and cut their losses on the season.\n\n\"We're showing no signs of a team that will compete,\" George said. \"We just don't have the habits of a championship or a playoff-contending team would have. To be honest, right now, it's a little farfetched. All we can do is work hard. Try to just keep going for one another. We've shown no signs of, forget championship, but a playoff contending-team here.\"\n\nDoes Nurse survive and earn a third season on the bench?\n\nWhat about team president Daryl Morey, who built this mishmashed roster full of patchwork free-agents and needlessly gave Embiid a three-year, $193 million contract extension ahead of training camp.\n\nLooking ahead\n\nSo where is the next win on the schedule? Wednesday night against a Knicks team winning at a 65% clip at Madison Square Garden? Against Steph Curry and the Warriors?\n\n\"It’s hard to see a vision, but we have a lot of games left,\" 2024 All-Star guard Tyrese Maxey said.\n\nNot really. Certainly not enough to make anyone who watched a 1-9 February — and has four of 20 wins against Charlotte — believe the season can be saved. The 76ers are only 7-8 this season when Embiid, George and Maxey start together.\n\n\"Everybody needs to look at themselves, at what they can do better, and then look at what they can do better for the team. And do our jobs, man. Be professional,\" Nurse said.",

        "title": "Trump to reinstate tariffs on Canada and Mexico, sparking economic concerns",
        "source": "https://www.fox29.com/",
        "content": "The Brief Trump will impose tariffs on Canada and Mexico starting next month, ending a temporary suspension. Economists warn the tariffs could raise consumer prices and hurt economic growth. Canada, Mexico, and other nations may retaliate, potentially leading to a broader trade conflict.\n\n\n\nPresident Donald Trump said Monday that his tariffs on Canada and Mexico are will begin next month. His move ends a monthlong suspension on the planned import taxes that could potentially hurt economic growth and worsen inflation.\n\nWhile Trump was answering a specific question about the taxes to be charged on America's two largest trading partners, the U.S. president also stressed more broadly that his intended \"reciprocal\" tariffs were on schedule to begin as soon as April.\n\nTrump has claimed that other countries charge unfair import taxes that have come at the expense of domestic manufacturing and jobs. His near constant threats of tariffs have already raised concerns among businesses and consumers about an economic slowdown and accelerating inflation. But Trump claims that the import taxes would ultimately generate revenues to reduce the federal budget deficit and new jobs for workers.\n\nWhat they're saying:\n\n\"We’re on time with the tariffs, and it seems like that’s moving along very rapidly,\" the U.S. president said at a White House news conference with French President Emmanuel Macron.\n\n\"The tariffs are going forward on time, on schedule,\" Trump said.\n\nWhat we know:\n\nMost economists say the cost of the taxes could largely be borne by consumers, retailers and manufacturers such as auto companies that source globally and rely on raw materials such as steel and aluminum that Trump is already, separately, tariffing at 25%.\n\nCompanies like Walmart have warned about uncertainty, while the University of Michigan's latest consumer sentiment index plunged by roughly 10% over the past month in part due to fears about tariffs and inflation worsening. In the 2024 presidential election, voters backed Trump on the belief that he could cool inflation that had spiked to a four-decade high in the aftermath of the coronavirus pandemic during President Joe Biden's time in office.\n\nWhat we don't know:\n\nInvestors, businesses and the broader public are still trying to determine whether Trump is merely threatening tariffs as a negotiating tool or if he sincerely backs the tax hikes as a way to offset his planned income tax cuts.\n\nTrump already plans to remove the exemptions on his 2018 steel and aluminum tariffs, taxing imports of both metals at 25%.\n\nDespite talks the Trump administration has held with Canadian and Mexican officials, the U.S. president signaled Monday that he would end the 30-day suspension of tariffs that were initially set to take effect in February. Trump plans to tax imports from Mexico at 25% as well as most goods from Canada, with energy products such as Canadian oil and electricity being tariffed at a lower 10%.\n\nDig deeper:\n\nTrump is placing tariffs on Canadian and Mexican goods with the stated goal of pressuring them to do more to address illegal immigration and the smuggling of illicit drugs such as fentanyl. While relatively little fentanyl comes from Canada, the country announced a czar to address the issue and appease Trump in addition to existing measures. Mexico has relocated members of its National Guard to the border with the United States in addition to existing measures.\n\nTrump also plans to impose new tariffs to match the rates charged by other countries. Set to begin as soon as April, the tariffs could be higher than what other countries would charge as subsidies, regulatory barriers and the value added tax — which is akin to a sales tax common in Europe — would be included in the calculations.\n\nThe possibility of retaliatory tariffs planned by Canada, Mexico and Europe could lead to a broader trade conflict that sabotage growth. In February, the Yale University Budget Lab estimated that the Canadian and Mexican tariffs could depress average U.S. incomes by $1,170 to $1,245 a year.\n\nWhat are tariffs?\n\nThe backstory:\n\nTariffs are a tax on imports . Tariffs are typically charged as a percentage of the price a buyer pays a foreign seller. In the United States, tariffs are collected by Customs and Border Protection agents at 328 ports of entry across the country.\n\nTrump has been threatening tariffs to ensure greater cooperation from countries on stopping illegal immigration and the smuggling of chemicals used for fentanyl. Trump has also pledged to use tariffs to boost domestic manufacturing.\n\nRELATED: Fed declines to lower interest rate, ending 3-cut run\n\nU.S. tariff rates vary: They are generally 2.5% on passenger cars, for instance, and 6% on golf shoes. Tariffs can be lower for countries with which the United States has trade agreements. For example, most goods were able to move between the United States, Mexico and Canada tariff-free because of Trump’s US-Mexico-Canada trade agreement. That will change under new tariffs imposed by Trump.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump gives a thumbs up before boarding Air Force One at Joint Base Andrews in Maryland on January 31, 2025, as he travels to the Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida. (Photo by Jim Watson/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nRELATED: Trump proposes abolishment of federal income tax\n\nTrump’s tariffs are an about-face to the trade agreement he himself negotiated with Canada and Mexico in his first term. The USMCA agreement – which he called \"the fairest, most balanced, and beneficial trade agreement we have ever signed into law,’’ – was supposed to bring predictability to North American trade, giving businesses the confidence to make investments. It hasn’t worked out that way.\n\nNow, experts say the 25% tax is like launching \"a grenade\" into the U.S. auto, oil and other major industries.\n\nWhat items from Canada and Mexico will have tariffs?\n\nWhat we know:\n\nMajor imports from Canada and Mexico include cars and trucks, automobile parts, crude oil, and agricultural products.\n\nDetails of the new order on Saturday revealed Canadian oil will be subject to a 10% tariff, not 25%, as other Canadian goods.\n\nWhat we don't know:\n\nIt's still unclear if there will be other exemptions for some products that could result in swift price increases to U.S. consumers.\n\nIt's also unclear if Trump will follow through with threats to impose tariffs on the European Union. He said Friday that he \"absolutely\" would add tariffs to EU imports, but he didn't elaborate.\n\nBy the numbers:\n\nUnder 25% tariffs, tariffs would surge from $1.3 billion to $132 billion a year on Mexico’s imports to the United States and from $440 million to $107 billion on Canada’s, according to the tax and consulting firm PwC.\n\nRELATED: What to know about Trump's interests in Greenland, Panama Canal\n\nIn 2023, the U.S. bought more than $45 billion in agricultural products from Mexico –including 63% of imported vegetables and 47% of fruits and nuts. Farm imports from Canada came to $40 billion. A 25% tariff could push prices up.\n\nRELATED: Trump's no-tax-on-overtime proposal: What to know\n\nIn 2023, the United States imported $69 billion worth of cars and light trucks from Mexico – more than any other country -- and $37 billion from Canada. Another $78 billion in auto parts came from Mexico and $20 billion from Canada. The engines in Ford F-series pickups and the iconic Mustang sports coupe, for instance, come from Canada.\n\nS&P Global Mobility reckoned that auto \"importers are likely to pass most, if not all, of this (cost) increase to consumers.’’ TD Economics notes that average U.S. car prices could rise by around $3,000 – this at a time when the average new car already goes for $50,000 and the average used car for $26,000, according to Kelley Blue Book.\n\nRELATED: Are we in an energy emergency? What Trump's executive order means\n\nCanada is also by far America’s biggest foreign supplier of crude oil. From January through November last year, Canada shipped the U.S. $90 billion worth of crude, well ahead of No. 2 Mexico at $11 billion.\n\nWhy are tariffs controversial?\n\nTrump has said tariffs will create more factory jobs, shrink the federal deficit, lower food prices and allow the government to subsidize childcare.\n\nTariffs can also be used to pressure other countries on issues that may or may not be related to trade. In 2019, for example, Trump used the threat of tariffs as leverage to persuade Mexico to crack down on waves of Central American migrants crossing Mexican territory on their way to the United States.\n\nTrump even sees tariffs as a way to prevent wars.\n\n\"Tariffs are the greatest thing ever invented,’’ Trump said at a rally in Flint, Michigan, during his presidential campaign.\n\nIn his first term, Trump imposed tariffs with a flourish — targeting imported solar panels, steel, aluminum and pretty much everything from China.\n\n\"Tariff Man,\" he called himself.\n\nThe other side:\n\nTariffs raise costs for companies and consumers that rely on imports. Mainstream economists are generally skeptical of tariffs, considering them a mostly inefficient way for governments to raise money and promote prosperity. They’re also likely to provoke retaliation.\n\nThe European Union, for example, punched back against Trump’s tariffs on steel and aluminum by taxing U.S. products, from bourbon to Harley-Davidson motorcycles. Likewise, China responded to Trump’s trade war by slapping tariffs on American goods, including soybeans and pork in a calculated drive to hurt his supporters in farm country.\n\nA study by economists at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the University of Zurich, Harvard and the World Bank concluded that Trump’s tariffs failed to restore jobs to the American heartland. The tariffs \"neither raised nor lowered U.S. employment’’ where they were supposed to protect jobs, the study found.\n\nDespite Trump’s 2018 taxes on imported steel, for example, the number of jobs at U.S. steel plants barely budged: They remained right around 140,000. By comparison, Walmart alone employs 1.6 million people in the United States.\n\nWorse, the retaliatory taxes imposed by China and other nations on U.S. goods had \"negative employment impacts,’’ especially for farmers, the study found. These retaliatory tariffs were only partly offset by billions in government aid that Trump doled out to farmers. The Trump tariffs also damaged companies that relied on targeted imports.\n\nWho actually pays tariffs?\n\nBig picture view:\n\nTrump insists that they are paid for by foreign countries. In fact, it is importers — American companies — that pay tariffs, and the money goes to the U.S. Treasury. Those companies, in turn, typically pass their higher costs on to their customers in the form of higher prices. That’s why economists say consumers usually end up footing the bill for tariffs.\n\nStill, tariffs can hurt foreign countries by making their products pricier and harder to sell abroad. Foreign companies might have to cut prices — and sacrifice profits — to offset the tariffs and try to maintain their market share in the United States. Yang Zhou, an economist at Shanghai’s Fudan University, concluded in a study that Trump’s tariffs on Chinese goods inflicted more than three times as much damage to the Chinese economy as they did to the U.S. economy.\n\nWhy you should care:\n\nA study this month by Warwick McKibbin and Marcus Noland of the Peterson Institute for International Economics concluded that the 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico and 10% tariffs on China \"would damage all the economies involved, including the U.S.’’\n\n\"For Mexico,’’ the study said, \"a 25% tariff would be catastrophic. Moreover, the economic decline caused by the tariff could increase the incentives for Mexican immigrants to cross the border illegally into the U.S. — directly contradicting another Trump administration priority.’’\n\nFormer trade negotiator Wendy Cutler, now vice president at the Asia Society Policy Institute, said the extent of the economic damage will depend on how long the tariffs are in effect.\n\nIf it’s just a few days, \"that’s one thing. If they are in place for weeks onto months, we’re going to see supply chain disruptions, higher costs for U.S. manufacturers, leading to higher prices for U.S. consumers,’’ she said. \"It could have macroeconomic impacts. It could affect the stock market. Then internationally it could lead to more tension with our trading partners and make it harder for us to work with them.''",

Billy McFarland, the founder of the failed festival who later pleaded guilty to wire fraud charges, recently spoke about plans for the new event. Tickets are on sale now.\n\n\n\nA second iteration of the notorious Fyre Festival is apparently coming soon.\n\nBilly McFarland, the founder of the failed festival who later pleaded guilty to wire fraud charges, recently spoke about plans for a sequel to the musical event.\n\nHere’s what to know:\n\nFyre Festival\n\nThe backstory:\n\nThe failed Fyre Festival held in 2017 in the Bahamas was promoted as \"the cultural experience of the decade,\" an ultra-luxurious event on the Bahamian island of Exuma over two weekends. It was promoted at the time on social media by Kendall Jenner, Bella Hadid, Emily Ratajkowski and other models and celebrities as the event organizers coaxed people into buying ticket packages ranging from $1,200 to over $100,000.\n\nBut customers hoping to see Blink-182 and the hip-hop act Migos arrived to learn the musical acts were canceled. Their luxury accommodations and gourmet food consisted of leaky white tents and cheese sandwiches. Customers lashed out on social media with the hashtag #fyrefraud, and a lawsuit called the festival \"nothing more than a get-rich-quick scam.\" It said the festival’s inadequate food, water, shelter and medical care left attendees stranded on a remote island in a \"dangerous and panicked situation.\"\n\nIn 2018, McFarland was later sentenced to six years in federal prison after pleading guilty to multiple counts of wire fraud in connection to the original festival, with the judge calling him a \"serial fraudster.\" He was released in May 2022 after serving four years.\n\nFILE - Billy McFarland leaves Manhattan Federal Court on July 1, 2017. (Jefferson Siegel/New York Daily News/Tribune News Service via Getty Images) Expand\n\nMcFarland had previously announced plans for Fyre Festival 2 in 2023, which at the time was set to take place in the Caribbean. However, plans for that festival were scrapped and tickets were refunded, according to the LA Times.\n\nFyre Festival 2 location\n\nWhat we know:\n\nMcFarland on Monday again announced Fyre Festival 2 on social media and described it as a \"three-day escape to the Mexican Caribbean where you’ll explore by day alongside your favorite talent and come together at night to celebrate with music.\"\n\nSpecifically, a press release states that Fyre Festival 2 will be May 30 to June 2 in Isla Mujeres, located about 8 miles off the coast of Cancún.\n\nMcFarland is apparently not handling the logistics this time around. Fyre Festival 2 is being produced by the event production company LostNights, while tickets and hospitality packages will be handled by soldout.com and FriendlySky, according to the press release.\n\nIt also promises \"world-class accommodations,\" as well as \"adventures led by international and local talent, taking guests on boundary-pushing excursions by day and uniting for intimate beach-side performances at night.\"\n\nWhat they're saying:\n\n\"FYRE 2 is real. My dream is finally becoming a reality,\" McFarland told TODAY in an interview that also aired on Monday.\n\n\"FYRE 2 really isn’t about the past, and it’s not really about me. It’s about taking the vision, which is strong,\" McFarland added.\n\nFyre Festival 2 tickets, lineup\n\nTicket Information:\n\nGeneral access tickets are on sale now and start at $1,400, which includes four-day access to Fyre Festival 2 and does not include accommodation. Other packages, labeled as \"VIP access\" and \"Artist access,\" start at $5,000 and $25,000 respectively.\n\nWhat we don't know:\n\nPerformers for the planned Fyre Festival 2 have not been announced.\n\nWhat they're saying:\n\n\"I’m sure many people think I’m crazy for doing this again,\" McFarland said in a statement. \"But I feel I’d be crazy not to do it again.

        "content": "The Brief Ticket prices to watch the Philadelphia 76ers play at the Wells Fargo Center are going for $2. Despite the team's record, many fans showed up to support the team as they faced the Chicago Bulls Monday night.\n\n\n\nYou can see an NBA game for less than you pay to see the local high school team.\n\nSome may say that's because the local high school team is playing better, but true fans support the team no matter what the record is and when its stars are hurt, especially when the cost to park your car or even take the subway is more than an NBA ticket.\n\nWhat we know:\n\nThe Chicago Bulls ended a six-game losing streak after beating the Philadelphia 76ers 142-110 Monday night.\n\nThe Bulls now hold the 10th and final play-in tournament spot in the Eastern Conference. Meanwhile, the Sixers sit in 12th place.\n\n76ers center Joel Embiid did not play in Monday's game due to an injured left knee.\n\nTicket prices for the game reached as low as $2 on various ticket-selling apps.\n\nMany fans still showed up to support the Philly team despite the team's record.\n\nWhat they're saying:\n\n\"What's it like seeing the Sixers for as cheap as three dollars a ticket?\" Keeley asked.\n\n\"I'm here. We're here. Listen, we'll pay more for the drinks than the tickets,\" a fan replied.\n\nEven the kids' soft drinks are more expensive.\n\nFans told us it's $8 for a Coca-Cola, four times the $2 price we saw tickets going for on StubHub for the home game against the Chicago Bulls.\n\nA Chicago fan has a ticket from the Sixers-Bulls game 50 years ago that was $8 back in 1975.\n\nMonday night, it was kind of an unofficial back-to-the-future night to see them play, with 1970s prices of tickets paid by the fans we met going in.\n\n\"They were six dollars,\" said Olivia Koch from West Chester University. \"Can you believe six dollars for a ticket? I know compared to the Eagles and Phillies, it's nuts, crazy.\"\n\n\"When was the last time you paid that much for a Sixers ticket? Keeley asked Matt T. from South Philadelphia. \"Man, I can't... I cannot remember,\" he replied.\n\n\"When was the last time you paid six dollars to see any pro game in any sport?\" Keeley asked Lara Costello, a Sixers fan. \"I don't even remember. Maybe never in my life, I don't think so,\" she said.\n\n\"Is this in your college budget, six dollars?\" Keeley asked Kendall Clemmer, a Sixers fan. \"I think six dollars, I think anybody can go for that,\" Clemmer replied.\n\n\"Are the Bulls better than the Sixers this year?\" Keeley asked Katherine Gaffney, an Arcadia University student from Chicago. \"They're one tank above the 76ers in the conference. So this is two bad teams you're paying to see?\" she said. \"Yes, tickets were 11 dollars, we had to come,\" she added.\n\nThe reason for the steep slide in ticket prices is the Sixers' steep slide in play.\n\n\"They're struggling, they're struggling. I think if Embiid was healthy, they'd be doing a lot better,\" said Chonetha Hernandez, a Sixers fan.\n\n\"Do you feel like you're getting your money's worth going to the game tonight?\" Keeley asked Oscar Hernandez, a Sixers fan. \"Uh, no, not really. I'm kinda bummed out the season came out the way it is,\" he replied.\n\n\"Does it stink paying money to see Embiid and then not seeing him play?\" Keeley asked Ari Hernandez, a Sixers fan. \"Yeah, it really sucks, and then when he is not even there on the bench, it also sucks even more, a little worse, a little worse,\" she said.\n\n\"Even though you paid for your tickets already, were there any second thoughts crossing your mind? Should I even go tonight?\" Keeley asked Chris Johnson, a season ticket holder. \"I did. I had them on StubHub tonight. The only reason I came is because they didn't sell,\" he laughed.\n\n\"The Embiid story, everybody's got mixed emotions…All I know is we won the Super Bowl! We won the Super Bowl! That'll carry through whatever the Sixers are doing. Whatever the Sixers are doing, we'll figure it out. We'll figure it out,\" said Tyrone J., a Sixers fan.",

Officials say the violent attack was unprovoked.\n\n\n\nA young police officer is fighting for his life after an unprovoked attack in the line of duty in Camden on Sunday.\n\nAn investigation is underway.\n\nWhat we know:\n\nOfficials are investigating after police say a Camden County police officer was stabbed outside a grocery store Sunday night.\n\nPolice say just before 6 p.m. on Sunday night, an officer was speaking to an individual outside Duran Grocery, at Broadway and Chestnut, as he was there to do a business check.\n\nCompletely unprovoked, police say Richard Dennis, 38, came up and stabbed the officer in the neck.\n\n\"He quickly went back to his training applied pressure while hitting his emergency button on his radio,\" said Chief Rodriguez. \"There was a supervisor directly down the street, probably a half block away that responded immediately, put him in the vehicle, and transported him here to the hospital which really saved his life.\"\n\nPolice say Dennis was taken into custody around the corner three minutes later and they recovered the knife.\n\nDennis, 38, is charged with attempted murder, aggravated assault on a law enforcement officer and related offenses.\n\nCamden County police identified the officer as Joshua McKnight, 23, a Pine Hill, NJ native who served as a Marine for four years before joining the department two years ago.\n\nChief Gabriel Rodriguez says Officer McKnight is responsive, still in and out of consciousness, but they are hopeful his condition will continue to improve.\n\nWhat we don't know:\n\nPolice say Dennis would not speak with investigators, so they still do not have a motive.\n\nWhat they're saying:\n\nOfficials are calling the attack \"unprovoked,\" and say it unfolded as the officer was conducting a business check.\n\n\"This is a surreal feeling for us, we’re all feeling a numbness that this happened to one of us in this way, unprovoked, and it’s scary,\" said Chief Rodriguez. \"This is a job he’s wanted to do his entire life, his mother said that as soon as she got to the hospital.

Our heartfelt prayers are with the officer who was injured, the responding officers, and their loved ones waiting, hoping for their safe return home.\"\n\n\"When something like this that just doesn’t make any sense happened it hurts everyone, everyone’s impacted,\" says Mayor Victor Carstarphen, who visited the officer at the hospital Sunday night.\n\nThere was a heavy, visible police presence back at the scene today and around the neighborhood. Chief Rodriguez says that area is always on their radar, and it is not unusual for officers to be in cars by themselves with other officers working nearby. However, they’re considering everything.\n\n\"We want to make sure our officers feel safe while they’re out there doing their job, so yes, I am considering some changes as well,\" he said.\n\nWhat's next:\n\nDennis is expected to appear in court on Thursday.",

A recall report warned that the impacted vehicles could face a loss of power steering assistance. The problem has not caused any known injuries, deaths or crashes.\n\n\n\nTesla is recalling more than 376,000 of its electric vehicles in the U.S. over a potential power steering issue.\n\nA recall report dated Feb. 19 and submitted to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration warns that the impacted vehicles could face a loss of power steering assistance.\n\nRELATED: 1 in 5 vehicles on US roads have an unresolved recall. Is yours one of them?\n\nHere’s what drivers should know:\n\nTesla recall over power-assisted steering issue\n\nWhat we know:\n\nTesla is recalling certain 2023 Model 3 and Model Y vehicles manufactured for sale in the U.S. that were equipped with a software release prior to 2023.38.4. The vehicles could face a loss of power steering assistance \"when the vehicle reaches a stop and then accelerates again\" if they experience an \"overstress condition\" in the printed circuit board for electronic power-assisted steering (EPAS), Tesla said in the recall report.\n\n\"A loss of power steering assist can require greater steering effort, especially at low speeds, increasing the risk of a crash,\" NHTSA said.\n\nThe problem has not caused any known injuries, deaths or crashes.\n\nBy the numbers:\n\nA total of 376,241 vehicles have been recalled as part of the issue.\n\nFILE - In an aerial view, Tesla cars sit parked in a lot at the Tesla factory on April 20, 2022, in Fremont, California. (Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)\n\nDig deeper:\n\nTesla said it designed the vehicles in a way that steering \"will not be affected\" if they suffer the \"overstress condition\" while driving above 0 miles per hour.\n\n\"Tesla’s design avoids any unreasonable risk to safety by preventing a loss of EPAS while the vehicle is in motion,\" the automaker said on its website. \"In addition, Tesla does not believe that loss of EPAS when the vehicle reaches 0 mph is an unreasonable risk to safety because manual steering remains available.\"\n\nBut Tesla said it decided to recall the affected vehicles in all markets to \"avoid confusion for our customers\" after a \"determination by a regulator in a non-US market that loss of EPAS at 0 mph should be remedied through a recall.\"\n\nWhat's next:\n\nTesla began deploying a free over-the-air software fix to address the issue that could cause the \"overstress condition\" in the printed circuit board in October 2023. It said in the report that 99% of U.S. affected Model 3 and Model Y cars had already received software release 2023.38.4 or later as of Jan. 23, 2025. Owners of the recalled EVs will not need to take their vehicle to a dealership, according to the report. They can expect to receive notification about the recall in the mail late next month.\n\nHow to check if your car is under recall\n\nDig deeper:\n\nDrivers can check if their vehicle is under recall by using the NHTSA’s VIN look up tool:\n\nGo to NHTSA.gov/Recalls\n\nEnter the vehicle's 17-character VIN\n\nSearch for recalls",

Elon Musk, who’s been tasked with slashing federal spending, said they must reply within 48 hours or risk losing their jobs. Key federal agencies from the FBI and State Department to the Pentagon have instructed their employees not to comply.\n\n\n\nElon Musk’s email to federal employees this weekend requesting \"what they got done\" last week at work has been met with resistance, from key federal agencies to lawmakers.\n\nHundreds of thousands of federal workers were given little more than 48 hours to comply or risk losing their job, sparking confusion.\n\nElon Musk email to federal employees\n\nFILE - Elon Musk, chief executive officer of Tesla Inc., during the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in National Harbor, Maryland, US, on Thursday, Feb. 20, 2025. Photographer: Will Oliver/ EPA / Bloomberg via Getty Images\n\nThe backstory:\n\nElon Musk tweeted on Saturday that all federal employees will be asked to report \"what they got done last week,\" and that failure to reply would be considered a resignation.\n\nShortly afterward, federal employees received a three-line email telling them to share \"approx. 5 bullets of what you accomplished last week and cc your manager.\"\n\nScreenshots of the email sent to FOX Television Stations by a federal employee who wished to remain anonymous. (Images: FTS)\n\nBig picture view:\n\nLayoffs and firings have affected many federal departments in recent weeks.\n\nSince Donald Trump took office in January, one of his top priorities has been cutting and reorganizing spending within the federal government.\n\nThe president has tapped billionaire businessman Elon Musk to lead the so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), which has been tasked with finding and prioritizing what to cut. Thousands of federal government employees have been laid off or fired in the process.\n\nDig deeper:\n\nMusk’s email came just hours after Trump encouraged him on social media to \"get more aggressive\" in reducing the size of the government.\n\nRELATED: Elon Musk says federal employees must email ‘what they got done last week’\n\nReaction to Elon Musk’s email\n\nWhat they're saying:\n\nDemocrats and some Republicans were critical of Musk's directive.\n\nKey federal agencies from the FBI and State Department to the Pentagon instructed their employees not to comply with the request.\n\nLabor unions have threatened lawsuits.\n\nPresident Trump and Musk both posted a meme mocking federal employees.\n\n\"Put a dose of compassion\"\n\n\"If I could say one thing to Elon Musk, it’s like, please put a dose of compassion in this,\" Sen. John Curtin, R-Utah. \"These are real people. These are real lives. These are mortgages. ... It's a false narrative to say we have to cut and you have to be cruel to do it as well.\"\n\nDemands OMP withdrawal\n\nRep. Gerry Connolly, D-VA, demanded Sunday that the Office of Personnel Management withdraw the email.\n\n\"This threat is illegal, reckless, and yet another example of the cruel and arbitrary chaos Mr. Musk is inflicting on the people’s government and its dedicated public servants. You must immediately clarify that federal employees’ nonresponse to this ill-conceived, weekend email does not constitute resignation,\" he wrote .\n\n\"Pause any responses\"\n\nNewly confirmed FBI Director Kash Patel , an outspoken Trump ally, instructed bureau employees to ignore Musk’s request, at least for now.\n\n\"The FBI, through the Office of the Director, is in charge of all of our review processes, and will conduct reviews in accordance with FBI procedures,\" Patel wrote in an email confirmed by The Associated Press. \"When and if further information is required, we will coordinate the responses. For now, please pause any responses.\"\n\nRELATED: FBI Director Kash Patel to take over ATF, reports say\n\n\"The Department will coordinate responses\"\n\nPentagon leadership instructed employees to \"pause\" any response to Musk's team as well.\n\n\"The Department of Defense is responsible for reviewing the performance of its personnel and it will conduct any review in accordance with its own procedures,\" according to an email from Jules Hurst, the deputy undersecretary of defense for personnel and readiness. \"When and if required, the Department will coordinate responses...\"\n\n\"Cruel and disrespectful\"\n\n\"It is cruel and disrespectful to hundreds of thousands of veterans who are wearing their second uniform in the civil service to be forced to justify their job duties to this out-of-touch, privileged, unelected billionaire who has never performed one single hour of honest public service in his life,\" AFGE President Everett Kelley said.\n\n\"AFGE will challenge any unlawful terminations of our members and federal employees across the country.\"\n\nThe other side:\n\nMusk and Trump appeared undeterred.\n\nThey both posted a meme on social media mocking federal employees. The Sunday post featured a cartoon character writing a list of accomplishments from the previous week led by, \"Cried about Trump,\" \"Cried about Elon,\" \"Made it into the office for once,\" and \"Read some emails.\"\n\nTrump posted it to his Truth Social site a few hours after Musk posted it on X .\n\nAccording to DOGE’s official website , as of Feb. 17, 2025, the agency estimates its savings around $55 billion. The agency attributes this to \"a combination of fraud detection/deletion, contract/lease cancelations, contract/lease renegotiations, asset sales, grant cancelations, workforce reductions, programmatic changes, and regulatory savings.\"\n\nWhat's next:\n\nThe deadline to reply was listed as Monday, Feb. 24, at 11:59 p.m., although the email did not include Musk's social media threat about those who fail to respond.\n\nIt’s unclear what the next steps will be this week once the deadline passes.\n\nUSAID workers fired\n\nMeanwhile:\n\nThe Trump administration said it is placing all but a fraction of staffers at the U.S. Agency for International Development on leave worldwide and eliminating at least 1,600 U.S.-based jobs.\n\nThe notices were sent to USAID workers and viewed Sunday by The Associated Press.\n\nBig picture view:\n\nThe move was the latest and one of the biggest steps yet toward what Trump and Musk say is their goal of gutting the 60-year-old aid agency as part of their broader goal of cutting the size of the federal government.",

Mr. Trump canceled the visit a day before over a national anthem dispute.\n\nMr. Trump said some members of the 2018 team \"disagree with their president because he insists that they proudly stand for the national anthem, hand on heart.\"\n\nThe president claimed the Eagles wanted to send a \"smaller delegation\" to the White House. Sources told CBS News Philadelphia that \"less than a handful\" of players signed up to meet with the president.\n\nAccording to the White House, the Eagles informed them on May 31 that 81 people — players, coaches, management and personnel — would visit the executive mansion.\n\nFormer White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders accused the Eagles of pulling a \"political stunt\" by rescheduling the visit because many of the players wouldn't attend. The White House claimed Mr. Trump would be overseas during the proposed dates.\n\nIn response to the cancellation of the White House visit, the Eagles released a statement without mentioning the president.\n\n\"It has been incredibly thrilling to celebrate our first Super Bowl championship. Watching the entire Eagles community come together has been an inspiration,\" the Eagles' statement read. \"We are truly grateful for all of the support we have received, and we are looking forward to continuing our preparations for the 2018 season.\"\n\nNick Foles #9 of the Philadelphia Eagles celebrates with the Vince Lombardi Trophy after defeating the New England Patriots 41-33 in Super Bowl LII at the U.S. Bank Stadium on February 4, 2018 in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Elsa/Getty Images\n\nMoments after the White House canceled the event, former Eagles wide receiver Torrey Smith posted on social media, \"So many lies.\"\n\nSeveral members of the 2018 Eagles, including Malcolm Jenkins, Chris Long, and Brandon Graham, previously said they would not attend the White House ceremony.\n\n\"To me, not going to the White House had nothing to do with the anthem. I said I wasn't going to the White House a long time ago,\" Long said in June 2018.\n\nJenkins, who helped create the Players Coalition to fight for racial and social equality, demonstrated by raising his fist during the national anthem. In a 2017 preseason game, Long put his arm around Jenkins during the anthem and said afterward, \"I'm here to show support as a White athlete.\"\n\nIn 2016, former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick began kneeling during the national anthem to raise awareness for racial injustice. In the years after, other NFL players joined by protesting during the anthem.\n\nWere the Eagles the only championship team not to visit the Trump White House in his first term?\n\nThe 2018 Eagles are not the only championship team, professional or collegiate, to skip a visit to the White House during Mr. Trump's first term as president.\n\nIn fact, the Eagles aren't the only Philadelphia-area championship team not to go. The 2017-18 Villanova Wildcats didn't visit the White House after former head coach Jay Wright said Mr. Trump did not invite the team.\n\nWhile the Patriots went in 2017, several players skipped the visit, including Tom Brady for \"personal reasons\" and Devin McCourty, Martellus Bennett, Dont'a Hightower and former Eagles Chris Long and LeGarrette Blount for political differences.\n\nIn 2017, the NBA champion Golden State Warriors didn't go to the White House. Mr. Trump rescinded the invitation after Warriors star Stephen Curry said he may not attend. The Warriors won the title the next year and were not invited.\n\nAfter their WNBA championships, neither the 2017 Minnesota Lynx nor the 2018 Seattle Storm were invited by Mr. Trump to the White House.\n\nSeveral college championship teams did not attend the White House during Mr. Trump's first term, including the 2016-17 University of North Carolina men's basketball team, 2016-17 South Carolina women's basketball team, 2017-18 Notre Dame women's basketball team and 2018-19 University of Virginia men's basketball team.\n\nThe 2018-19 Baylor women's basketball team became the first women's team to visit the White House solo under Mr. Trump.\n\nWhich president started Super Bowl winner White House visits?\n\nIn 1980, President Jimmy Carter invited the Pittsburgh Steelers to the White House for a joint visit with the Pittsburgh Pirates, who had won the 1979 World Series.\n\nThe Steelers beat the Rams in Super Bowl XIV. The Pirates won the 1979 World Series in seven games over the Baltimore Orioles. The Steelers were the first Super Bowl-winning team to be invited to the White House.\n\nDuring the visit, Carter held a Pirates hat and a Steelers \"terrible towel.\"\n\nThe history of the White House championship visits\n\nSports teams visiting the White House after winning a championship is a tradition now, but it dates back to the 19th century.\n\nAccording to the White House Historical Association, President Andrew Johnson invited amateur baseball teams Brooklyn Atlantics and Washington Nationals on Aug. 30, 1865. Four years later, in 1869, President Ulysses S. Grant invited the first professional sports team, the Cincinnati Red Stockings, to the White House.\n\nIn 1924, President Calvin Coolidge hosted the Washington Senators, the first MLB team invited to the White House, after the club won the World Series.\n\nThe first NBA team to visit the White House after winning a championship was the Celtics in 1963 when President John F. Kennedy hosted Boston.\n\nIn 1983, President Ronald Reagan invited the New York Islanders to the White House after the team won the Stanley Cup. The Islanders were the first NHL team to visit.",

He's now in charge of the country's largest health agency.\n\n\"I think it's a sad day for children. I think it's a sad day for the public's health,\" Dr. Paul A.

I am neither. I am pro-safety,\" Kennedy said during his hearing.\n\nOffit says there are decades of research highlighting the safety of vaccines, which Kennedy has challenged.\n\n\"So I think he said whatever he needed to say to get confirmed, but I think that he is going to be exactly who he has been for the last 20 years,\" Offit said. \"Believe him when he says what he is.\"\n\nBeyond the vaccine issue, Kennedy has vowed to \"make America healthy again.\"\n\n\"We will reverse the chronic disease epidemic and put the nation back on the road to good health,\" Kennedy said.\n\nKennedy says part of that will include taking aim at junk food.\n\n\"I agree with him largely on highly processed foods,\" said Dr. Ezekiel J. Emanuel, an expert in medical ethics and health policy at the University of Pennsylvania.\n\n\"We do know that highly processed foods are associated with a number of health problems — obesity, diabetes, dementia,\" Emanuel said.\n\nIt's unclear exactly how Kennedy will take on the food industry, but he and others in the Trump administration are vowing to disrupt the federal bureaucracy and cut wasteful spending.\n\n\"I think there are some things which are clearly worrisome,\" Emanuel said.\n\nEmanuel and Offit are especially worried about medical research that the Trump administration is already trying to cut.\n\nThe Health and Human Services Department includes the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the National Institutes of Health, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and the Food and Drug Administration.",

But despite that, Black men are significantly more likely to die from the disease, and Black women who have a less chance of developing cancer are more likely to die from it,\" said Dr. William Dahut, the chief scientific officer at the American Cancer Society.\n\nThe report finds Black patients compared to White patients have a two-fold higher risk of death for myeloma, prostate, uterine (endometrial), and stomach cancers, and 40% to 50% higher for colorectal, breast, cervical and liver cancers.\n\n\"In prostate cancer, Black men are about 67% more likely to be diagnosed and about two times more likely to die,\" Dahut said. \"There's probably a different inherited risk in Black men than white men. Based on our research, Black men are often not offered the same treatment options as white men.\"\n\nWaddington shares his story to raise awareness about the disparities.\n\n\"Part of this work I do with the American Cancer Society is I tell people I wanna be around for grandkids,\" Waddington said. \"I push myself to stay on top of my health. This is what I want my legacy to be, granddad did something to help, you know, the community overcome cancer.\"\n\nWork, he hopes, will save more lives.\n\nThe cancer society says men should be getting PSA blood tests starting at age 50 – earlier if they're in a high risk group.",

I was like, 'oh my god, how is that even possible?'\" said Romanelli. \"He was here, just doing his thing, and he heard cries for help. And he went and helped a person. And he doesn't know me, he didn't owe me anything. I just think that that's a remarkable human to do something like that,\" said Romanelli.\n\nWhile Venter says he'd do it all again in a heartbeat, the incident has inspired him to host a free self-defense seminar for women on Saturday, March 15 at 2 p.m. His goal is to give them the skills to defend themselves in a similar situation.\n\n\"We're going to work on mostly situational awareness, and 3 or 4 self-defense [moves] that we're going to practice over and over,\" said Venter.\n\nIf you're interested in signing up for Venter's self-defense class, there are still spots available.

        "content": "SEPTA bus drivers secured safety improvements, including bulletproof glass enclosures for their vehicles, when they signed a new contract last year and avoided a strike.\n\nThe compartments were designed after the murder of Bernard Gribbin, who was driving a Route 23 bus on Germantown Avenue when he was shot multiple times by a passenger on Oct. 26, 2023 – sparking concerns about safety among drivers.\n\nNow, those bulletproof enclosures will be put to the test.\n\nSEPTA says on Tuesday, multiple SWAT officers will fire rounds at the bulletproof panes to test their durability.\n\nAssuming the compartment holds up, a pilot program to install them on some buses will begin and those buses will hit the road this spring.\n\nThe glass enclosures were designed by Custom Glass Solutions of Trumbauersville, Bucks County. The Transport Workers Union of America, which represents thousands of SEPTA employees, says the enclosures are the first of their kind in the country.\n\nUnion officers from Philadelphia as well as other cities, including Houston and Miami, will be watching the demonstration.\n\n\"This safety measure is necessary because of the outrageous and grotesque level of violence against front-line transit workers,\" TWU International President John Samuelsen said in a statement. \"We need to completely encapsulate Bus Operators to protect them from all sorts of attacks and threats, including gunfire. It's unacceptable that Bus Operators leaving home for work worry they might wind up in the emergency room, or worse.\"\n\nGribbin, 48, was described in an obituary as an Army veteran who was stationed in Germany and deployed to Bosnia from 1996 to 1999. The avid follower of pro wrestling lived in Abington, Montgomery County, and had worked for SEPTA for 12 years as a bus operator.",

A post shared on Monday, Feb. 24 said \"It has been a very difficult weekend for us. We have lost our work team for now.\"\n\nThe business said it would continue to operate as normal in the meantime.\n\nLast month, an apparent ICE raid was carried out at a car wash in North Philadelphia's Juniata Park neighborhood. Seven people were detained in the operation, which ICE Philadelphia said was also based on allegations that employees were being subjected to labor exploitation.\n\nThe owner of the car wash told CBS News Philadelphia the men had worked at the business for at least 15 years, and claimed ICE never presented a warrant before carrying out the arrests.\n\nICE operations on businesses have been playing out across the country amid President Donald Trump's crackdown on illegal immigration.\n\nThe first piece of legislation signed by Trump in his second term as president was the Laken Riley Act, which expands the federal government's ability to detain immigrants who are in the U.S. illegally.\n\nDerek DeCosmo, an immigration expert at DeCosmo Law, explained that under the new law, anyone with an allegation against them or a pending charge could be subject to being held by authorities. \"A judge is not going to have the legal authority to review it,\" DeCosmo said.\n\nAccording to data obtained by CBS News, ICE started releasing some detainees earlier this month because it ran out of space in its detention system amid a spike in arrests.",

        "source": "https://www.cbsnews.com/philadelphia/",
        "content": "Joel Embiid has been ruled out for Monday night's game against the Chicago Bulls as he and the Sixers consult with doctors after he completed new imaging on his injured left knee. ESPN was the first to report the news.\n\nSixers head coach Nick Nurse said the tests on Embiid's left knee will continue on Monday and Tuesday. So is this the last we've seen of the big fella this season? Nurse said the team isn't at the point of ruling him out for the season.\n\n\"We are playing and testing and trying to figure it out and go from there,\" Nurse said.\n\nEmbiid and the Sixers are weighing all options, including surgery, as he continues to deal with an injured left knee that has hampered his play on the court and kept him sidelined for most of the season.\n\nOver the weekend, Embiid sat the entire fourth quarter in Philadelphia's loss against the Brooklyn Nets after he was slow to get up in the third quarter, but Nurse said that was a lineup decision — not because of an injury.\n\nEmbiid has been getting injections in his left knee regularly along with other treatments, but it hasn't improved. The 2022-23 NBA MVP and two-time scoring champ has admitted recently that he's been struggling with the knee injury and has hinted at having surgery to \"fix the problem.\"\n\nEmbiid has only played in 19 of the Sixers' 56 games due to his left knee injury, a foot sprain, a sinus fracture and a three-game suspension he served at the beginning of the 2024-25 season for shoving Philadelphia Inquirer columnist Marcus Hayes.\n\nEmbiid hasn't been himself all year as he's continued to battle through the injuries. His 23.8 points per game are his lowest average since the 2019-20 season. He's also been shooting an uncharacteristic 44.4% from the field, which is the first time he's shot below 50% since the 2021-22 season.\n\nEmbiid and the Sixers had championship aspirations after an offseason that landed them nine-time All-Star Paul George, but the signing hasn't work out thus far.\n\nLast season, Embiid also missed a significant number of games after he tore the meniscus in his left knee. He played 39 regular season games, had surgery on his left knee in February, and then returned in time for Philadelphia's loss in the first round of the playoffs against the New York Knicks.\n\nAt the beginning of the season, the Sixers wanted Embiid to be healthy for the postseason, which is something that he's struggled with his entire career. Embiid told ESPN he would probably never play in back-to-back games for the rest of his career. But the plan to get them there obviously hasn't come to fruition\n\n\"It is disappointing, it certainly has been disappointing, there's no question about it,\" Nurse said. \"I don't think that anybody envisioned it going like this. So yeah, it is. It's disappointing on a lot of levels, man. He wants to play. We want him to play. Our best version of our team is with him playing, getting to where we want it to go and it hasn't worked out like that yet.\"",

I had no idea that this person, whose name is Stephen Jones, who I barely knew at all, described as a friend by my opponent? That's absurd,\" he said.\n\nDugan says he was never invited to the meeting in the first place and says something isn't adding up.

A handful of volunteers meet weekly to load their cars with fruits, snacks and even fresh bread.\n\nAnthony Adams and his friend Kevin Bass started the nonprofit Homies Helping Homies after realizing food insecurity was not just a problem among those who are homeless.\n\n\"A lot of things people do in desperation are to feed their family,\" Adams said. \"At the end of the day, if we can put one meal on the table to relieve some of that stress, we've done what we are out here to do.\"\n\nHomies Helping Homies operates in a small storage unit where most groceries are stored. While most volunteers, like Adams, have other jobs, they still make time to give back.\n\n\"We don't put pressure to show up,\" Adams said. \"They come when they want.\"\n\nThe grassroots organization started in 2020 at the height of the George Floyd protests.\n\nAdams and Bass had an idea.\n\n\"We were passing eye wash kits, water and snacks to make sure people were hydrated throughout the day,\" Adams said.\n\nPeople just started giving them household items to hand out.\n\nWhen the pandemic hit, food pantries closed. In response, they set up a small table just a few blocks from their storage unit.\n\n\"That first table, it took about a month and a half of preparation,\" Adams said, \"and that table lasted 45 minutes before everything was gone.\"\n\nThey've been setting up shop ever since.\n\n\"In a perfect world, we wouldn't exist,\" Adams said. \"We exist because of food insecurity, and marginalized people don't have the resources they need for everyday life.\"",

Vincent didn't identify the team.\n\nBut according to The Athletic, that team is the Green Bay Packers.\n\nGreen Bay Packers president and CEO Mark Murphy called the tush push \"bad for the game\" in a message posted on the team's website after the Packers were eliminated by the Eagles in the playoffs.\n\n\"There is no skill involved and it is almost an automatic first down on plays of a yard or less,\" Murphy wrote. \"I would like to see the league prohibit pushing or aiding the run.\"\n\nEagles right tackle Lane Johnson reacted to the news about the proposal on X with a crying laughing face emoji.\n\nPhiladelphia Eagles quarterback Jalen Hurts (1) scores a touchdown against the Kansas City Chiefs during the first half of the NFL Super Bowl 59 football game, Feb. 9, 2025, in New Orleans. Godofredo A. Vásquez / AP\n\nNFL owners could vote on the proposal when they meet next month in Florida.\n\nThe tush push has become synonymous with the Eagles. Perhaps no example summed up how much the play can be a challenge for Eagles opponents quite like when Philadelphia used it against Washington in the NFC championship game. The Commanders jumped offside four times in a sequence of five plays while trying to stop the tush push — earning them a warning from the referee that he could award the Eagles a touchdown if the Commanders did it again.\n\nBills coach Sean McDermott, a member of the competition committee, on Monday mentioned player safety concerns — even though Buffalo has used a version of the play.\n\n\"The way that the techniques that are used with the play, to me, have been potentially contrary to the health and safety of the players,\" McDermott said at the NFL scouting combine. \"You have to go back through, in fairness, to the injury data on the play, but I just think the optics of it I'm not in love with.\"\n\nMcDermott didn't say whether he favored a rule change. Although the Bills were mostly successful when they used the tush push in short-yardage situations last season, quarterback Josh Allen was stopped for no gain on fourth-and-1 early in the fourth quarter of a 32-29 loss to Kansas City in the AFC championship game.",

        "content": "Joel Embiid and the 76ers are consulting doctors and considering alternative options, including surgery, on his injured left knee, an NBA source confirmed to CBS News Philadelphia. ESPN first reported the news.\n\nThe news comes as Embiid sat the entire fourth quarter in Philadelphia's loss at the buzzer to the Brooklyn Nets on Saturday night at the Wells Fargo Center. He was slow to get up late in the third quarter against Brooklyn after he lost the ball and hit the court.\n\nEmbiid is scheduled to have tests on his knee early this week. Embiid has been getting injections in his left knee regularly along with other treatments but his left knee hasn't improved. The 2022-23 NBA MVP has admitted recently that he's been struggling with the knee injury and has hinted at having surgery to \"fix the problem.\"\n\nEmbiid has also dealt with a foot sprain and a sinus fracture in the 2024-25 season. He's only played in 19 of 56 possible games due to injuries and a three-game suspension after he shoved a Philadelphia Inquirer columnist. Embiid is questionable for Monday night's game against the Chicago Bulls with left knee injury management.\n\nEmbiid and the Sixers entered the season with high expectations following an offseason in which the team inked nine-time All-Star Paul George to a max contract and signed rising star Tyrese Maxey to a contract extension. But the team has been plagued by injuries and struggled on the court. Embiid also signed a three-year, $192 million contract extension in the offseason. The Sixers are 20-36, have lost seven straight and are 12th in the Eastern Conference, which is just outside the NBA's Play-In Tournament.\n\nIn 19 games this season, Embiid is averaging 23.8 points, which is his lowest mark since the 2019-20 season. He's also averaging 8.2 rebounds and shooting 44.4% from the field.\n\nLast season, Embiid also missed a significant number of games after he tore the meniscus in his left knee. He played 39 regular season games, had surgery on his left knee in February and then returned in time for Philadelphia's loss in the first round of the playoffs against the New York Knicks.\n\nEmbiid then won the gold medal with the United States over the summer and missed the first nine games of the season the 2024-25 season due to managing his injured left knee.\n\nEmbiid potentially having surgery or missing an extended period of time will have ramifications on the team's first-round pick in the 2025 NBA draft. The Sixers' first-round pick is top-six protected. If it doesn't fall within the first six picks, it goes to the Oklahoma City Thunder. Philadelphia's loss to the Nets on Saturday put the Sixers in sole possession of the sixth-worst record in the NBA.",

The Vatican's typically brief morning update said: \"The pope slept well, all night.\"\n\nVatican sources said the pope's condition remained the same Tuesday morning as it had been the previous evening, and that he had been able to get out of bed and eat breakfast on his own.\n\nOn Monday evening, doctors said he remained in critical condition with double pneumonia but reported a \"slight improvement\" in some laboratory results. In the most upbeat bulletin in days, they said he had resumed work from his hospital room, calling a parish in Gaza City that he's kept in touch with since the war there began.\n\nAfter night fell, thousands of faithful gathered in a rain-soaked, chilly St. Peter's Square for the first of a nightly recitation of the Rosary. The prayer evoked the 2005 vigils when St. John Paul II was dying in the Apostolic Palace, but those on hand said they were praying for Francis' recovery.\n\nStanding on the same stage where Francis usually presides, the Vatican secretary of state, Cardinal Pietro Parolin, said that ever since Francis had been hospitalized, a chorus of prayers for his recovery had swelled up from around the world.\n\n\"Starting this evening, we want to unite ourselves publicly to this prayer here, in his house,\" Parolin said, praying that Francis \"in this moment of illness and trial\" would recover quickly.\n\nThe Argentine pope, who had part of one lung removed as a young man, has been hospitalized since Feb. 14 and doctors have said his condition is touch-and-go, given his age, fragility and pre-existing lung disease.\n\nBut in Monday's update, they said he hadn't had any more respiratory crises since Saturday and the flow and concentration of supplemental oxygen has been slightly reduced. The slight kidney insufficiency detected Sunday wasn't causing alarm at the moment, doctors said, while saying his prognosis remained guarded.\n\nStill, the mood was mostly grim in the monumental square, with many of the roughly 4,000 assembled understanding they may be in Rome for Francis' final days. Crowds sat under umbrellas on folding chairs or stood by the vast colonnades as they reflected fondly on the pontiff's legacy.\n\n\"To see him suffer hurts,\" said Robert Pietro, a Romanian seminarian who stood at the prayer holding a small, fragrant candle in tribute. \"But we also pray in thanksgiving for what he has done for the Church.\"\n\nRoberto Allison, a priest from the Mexican state of Guadalajara, said members of his community had come together to show appreciation for \"all that we have learned from him.\"\n\nStopping to deliver personal blessings to some at the end of the ceremony, Cardinal Angelo Bagnasco said the crowd's diversity - many world languages could be heard spoken - was \"a big sign of comfort\" for the Catholic Church.\n\nThe faithful attend a rosary prayer for Pope Francis in St. Peter's Square at the Vatican on rvening of Feb. 24, 2025. Riccardo De Luca / Anadolu via Getty Images\n\nA couple of Catholic tourists from Chicago, who arrived holding umbrellas well before the service started, said they prayed for the pope at daily Mass earlier at St. Peter's Basilica, and decided to come back. Like many, they found it \"hard to process\" they may be in Rome for Francis' final days.\n\n\"No one knows the day and time, but it's a historic moment nonetheless,\" said Edward Burjek.\n\nIt felt the same for Hatzumi Villanueva of Peru. She was particularly fond of former pope St. John Paul II but said Francis, as the first Latin American pope, \"draws a bit closer.\"\n\n\"We came to pray for the pope, that he may recover soon, for the great mission he's sharing with his message of peace,\" said Villanueva, who praised his empathy for migrants.\n\nFrancis' papacy has also emphasized the defense of the environment and partial openness to LGBTQ+ rights.\n\nOutside the Vatican, Romans, pilgrims and even non-Catholics said they were offering special prayers for the hospitalized pope.\n\n\"We are all sorry,\" said Raniero Mancinelli, who has tailored ceremonial clothing for Francis and the two previous popes in his shop just outside the Vatican's walls.\n\nElisabetta Zumbo carried a 5-foot-long cross down a cordoned-off section of the street leading to St. Peter's as she prepared to lead a group of 34 pilgrims from the northern Italian city of Piacenza. With the rain pouring down, she pledged her group would pray intensely for the pope.\n\n\"There is a lot of emotion and a lot of sadness,\" Zumbo said.\n\nNearby, a couple from London visiting St. Peter's with their son said that even though they're not Catholic, they felt close to the pontiff \"being there in his home\" in the monumental basilica.",

The man then pointed the gun at an officer and fired at least one shot, but missed the officer.\n\nSmall said the officer was \"lucky\" to not be struck since the shot was fired from just inches away.\n\nOfficers showed restraint, arresting the gunman without firing any shots themselves, Small said.\n\nAt the scene, investigators recovered a semi-automatic handgun and at least one bullet casing, Small said.

        "source": "https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/",
        "content": "Dan Bongino, the conservative podcaster named deputy director of the FBI, has spent the past seven years publicly criticizing the agency he will now help run, pushing conspiracy theories about corrupt FBI leadership and agents who were out to get President Donald Trump.\n\nA survey of Bongino’s podcast transcripts by NBC News from 2017 to 2025 found that he made the FBI a regular target on his show, routinely claiming that the bureau colluded with the so-called deep state, an alleged shadowy network of entrenched federal and military operatives. Those themes figured heavily on “The Dan Bongino Show,” a syndicated radio show and daily podcast that is among the most popular in the U.S.\n\nAlong the way, Bongino has gone from a relatively unknown conservative pundit to one of the most followed and recognizable pro-Trump voices in all of media, commanding an audience of millions across various platforms.\n\n“The FBI has totally and completely failed America,” Bongino said in a June 2024 episode of his podcast, a sentiment typical of his attacks on the bureau. “It kills me to have to tell you that you can’t trust these people, you cannot.”\n\nGet top local stories in Philly delivered to you every morning. Sign up for NBC Philadelphia's News Headlines newsletter.\n\nBongino has also espoused an extreme view on the law and power, saying in May 2024: “Power. That is all that matters,” as part of a critique of the Biden administration’s effort to forgive student loans before going on to laugh at the idea of checks and balances in the government. “That’s a good one. That’s really funny.”\n\nThe FBI declined to comment. Bongino addressed his critics Monday on his podcast, appearing to strike a slightly more leveled tone while still implying that the FBI had been corrupted.\n\n“I get it, if you are a political opponent of mine that has been involved with proudly celebrating a weaponized justice system, how you don’t understand how a guy like me who discusses partisan content in an opinion show and go and do (an) unquestionably nonpartisan job,” he said. “I’m going to ask you a simple question. Have you seen what I did before I came here?”\n\nHe continued: “I’m committed to service. People play different roles in their lives. People are dads, people are soccer coaches. People are cops and military officers and military enlisted people. People are carpenters, people are plumbers. We play different roles in our life, and each one requires a different skill set.”\n\nThe deputy director is second-in-command of the FBI, and the job has traditionally been filled by a career agent who manages daily operations across the bureau’s 55 field offices. The job, like other comparable posts, does not require approval from the Senate.\n\nBut neither Bongino nor FBI Director Kash Patel have ever served in the agency they will now lead, and their public criticism of the FBI and embrace of misinformation and partisanship is raising questions about how they will run the FBI, even as they insist they are going to wipe the agency clean of politics.\n\nDuring a joint news conference on Monday, French President Emmanuel Macron interrupted President Donald Trump to clarify, “We provided real money.”\n\nOn Bongino’s podcast from May 2017 through Monday, there were more than 21,000 mentions of “FBI” or “deep state,” according to data from the KnowledgeFight podcast database. Mentions peaked in June 2023, the month Trump was indicted for obstruction and other crimes after federal officials accused him of hoarding classified documents. The case was dismissed after Trump won the 2024 election.\n\nBongino wasn’t always critical of the bureau; in episodes from early 2017 and before, he maintained a fairly deferential tone. But in the later months of that year, things shifted.\n\nHe started discussing conspiracy theories that the Obama administration had illegally spied on Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign with the FBI, despite a lack of evidence.\n\nAnd by the end of Trump’s first year in office, Bongino had come to a revelation, he said, claiming in a Dec. 14, 2017 episode that he believed that FBI leadership had interfered in the U.S. election by collecting information about Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign in an attempt to rig the election for Democrat Hillary Clinton. At the time, the FBI was, in fact, heavily criticized for releasing information about Clinton’s use of a private email server for official public communications.\n\nHe’s also been one of the loudest supporters of unfounded claims that the 2020 election was stolen, railing often about what he said was a coordinated effort from Democratic politicians and groups to manipulate social media, voting laws, poll workers and vote-by-mail to throw the election to Democrat Joe Biden.\n\nBiden won in 2020; there was no widespread voter fraud, according to members of Trump’s own administration. But Bongino warned that without addressing these alleged injustices, the same “cabal” would interfere in the 2024 election.\n\nRoy Rochlin/Getty Images Roy Rochlin/Getty Images\n\nBongino’s criticism of the FBI initially focused on top officials who he claimed were partisan. But after the FBI obtained a search warrant to recover classified documents from Trump’s Mar-a-Lago home, Bongino called for larger-scale firings at the agency: “Every person involved in this has to be fired immediately,” he said in an August 2022 Fox & Friends interview. “And then when the left starts whining in the media, fire 100 more the next day. Do not even let them breathe, everyone has to go, you do not even live in a constitutional republic anymore, and there is no fixing this, there is only rebuilding it.”\n\n“I’ll say for the 10th or 20th time this week, this is why the FBI must be disbanded,” Bongino said on a September 2022 episode. “You understand this is going to get worse, you’re not going to fix this. The organization needs to be disbanded.”\n\nBongino escalated his attacks on the FBI in 2023, characterizing the agency as a “clear and present danger” to the United States. Bongino accused the FBI of systemic corruption, alleging that it colluded with foreign governments, spread disinformation, suppressed information related to Biden’s son Hunter Biden and interfered in elections.\n\nHe frequently targeted then-FBI Director Christopher Wray, calling his leadership an embarrassment and suggesting that the agency had become a tool for political oppression. Bongino also claimed that the FBI actively suppressed information about COVID-19, violated the First Amendment and targeted Donald Trump and conservatives.\n\nBongino continued to make the call to disband the FBI through 2024.\n\nIt’s not entirely clear how Bongino entered the running for the deputy director position.\n\nHe does have law enforcement experience, having served in the U.S. Secret Service, on details for Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama. He was also in the New York Police Department.\n\nSince then, he’s been in Trump’s orbit as a conservative commentator. He worked on Fox News from 2021 through 2023, and was chosen to host a radio show in the same time slot as Rush Limbaugh after his 2021 death.\n\nBongino will be one of nearly two-dozen former Fox News personalities in Trump’s administration, a list that includes Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy and Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard. Trump similarly staffed his first administration with several of the network’s employees.\n\nIn July, conservative-leaning publication The Daily Signal published a YouTube interview with Bongino in which he said he would be open to leading the FBI “if President Trump called.”\n\nIn November 2024, shortly after Trump’s election, Bongino began lobbying on Patel’s behalf to his listeners, urging them to share positive endorsements for Patel’s FBI director nomination on social media.\n\n“Folks, we need Kash Patel at FBI. As far as I’m concerned right now, he is the only guy who knows where the bodies are buried and go in there and clean that mess up, we got to get Kash,” Bongino said in a Nov. 19 episode of his podcast. Since the election, he has brought up Patel in at least 40 separate episodes.\n\nTo take the position at the FBI, Bongino has to give up his microphone. Trump said in his announcement that Bongino was “willing and prepared.”\n\n“Great news for Law Enforcement and American Justice!” Trump said in a social media post announcing the appointment.\n\nThis article first appeared on NBCNews.com.

        "content": "Current and former FBI officials expressed shock and dismay Monday over the news that President Donald Trump had selected a right-wing podcaster and ardent FBI critic to be the bureau’s deputy director, even as the man picked for the job said he was ready to put partisanship aside.\n\nOn his podcast, former Secret Service agent Dan Bongino — who once called the FBI “irredeemably corrupt”— thanked the president for the appointment and suggested that he was prepared to step out of his role as a MAGA warrior. But even as he did so, he repeated the baseless charge that the Justice Department had been “weaponized,” a claim he has frequently brandished to criticize the agency he will now help lead.\n\n“I get it, if you are a political opponent of mine that has been involved with proudly celebrating a weaponized justice system, how you don’t understand how a guy like me who discusses partisan content in an opinion show and go and do (an) unquestionably nonpartisan job,” he said. “I’m going to ask you a simple question.

We play different roles in our life, and each one requires a different skill set.”\n\nGet top local stories in Philly delivered to you every morning. Sign up for NBC Philadelphia's News Headlines newsletter.\n\nBongino’s conciliatory words did little to reassure skeptics within the FBI, who noted that, in the bureau’s 117-year history, the deputy director has always been a career FBI agent with deep knowledge of how the bureau functions — and not a political appointee selected by the president.\n\nNeither FBI Director Kash Patel nor Bongino have ever worked at the FBI.\n\nIn fact, the FBI Agents Association said in a memo to the workforce that Patel had privately committed to installing an agent as his second in command.\n\nThe group did not comment Monday, and the FBI declined to comment.\n\nSome FBI officials consider the deputy director job more important than the director’s role, because the deputy oversees operations, supervises the heads of field offices and handles some of the most sensitive intelligence in the federal government.\n\n“This is beyond problematic,” said Christopher O’Leary, a former senior FBI official who retired in 2023. “Any hope that Kash could be steered by having experienced leaders around him is out the window. We now have two conspiracy theorists and election deniers running our premier law enforcement and intelligence agency.”\n\nHere are five things to know about former federal prosecutor Kash Patel.\n\nSome current FBI employees, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they are not allowed to talk to reporters, were even more blunt. They said they feared Bongino's appointment spelled the end of an independent FBI and put the bureau’s fearsome investigative and intelligence capabilities in the hands of political actors with radical agendas.\n\n“I didn’t sleep and I want to pack my desk today,” one said.\n\nAnother FBI official said he viewed the hiring of Bongino as akin to bringing on conspiracy theorist Alex Jones or Oath Keepers leader Stuart Rhodes.\n\nLike those two men, Bongino has become known for both his loyalty to Trump and for trafficking in bizarre and unproven allegations about the FBI and the Capitol riot.\n\nHe once argued that every FBI agent and supervisor who had anything to do with the 2022 search of Trump’s Mar-a-Lago compound — which was conducted pursuant to a lawful search warrant — be fired. And he recently claimed without evidence that the FBI knows who placed pipe bombs outside the RNC and DNC the day before the Jan. 6 attack, even though the FBI says it has not identified any suspects and recently asked the public for help.\n\n“Will the deputy director get a security clearance? FBI background checks? Does it matter that he supported the Oath Keepers?\" one retired FBI agent said, referring to the far-right group that Rhodes founded. \"I doubt it because the director supported Jan. 6th.\"\n\nThe retired agent spoke on the condition of anonymity to avoid being targeted by online threats.\n\nDespite the focus on Bongino, many FBI employees tried to keep their heads down and go on with their jobs Monday, current and former officials said.\n\nBongino worked for two years for the New York Police Department before joining the Secret Service in 1999, where he served for 12 years. He ran unsuccessfully three times as a Republican candidate for office before striking out to build what has become a media empire, including one of the most popular podcasts in the U.S.\n\nOn Monday, Bongino sought to strike an inspiring tone.\n\n“We’re going to re-establish faith in this institution, the good people there, doing their job, hitting the streets, developing sources,” he said. “We’ll have your back. … The FBI belongs to the American people. Doesn’t belong to me, doesn’t belong to anyone else but the American people. But this is the honor of a lifetime, and it’s a serious mission. I plan on implementing that vision.”\n\nThis story first appeared on NBCNews.com. More from NBC News:",

        "content": "There was garbage time as far as the eye can see Monday night at Wells Fargo Center.\n\nThe Sixers’ 32-point margin of defeat against the Bulls was flattering. They trailed by as many as 50 in their eighth consecutive loss, allowed 142 points and plummeted to 20-37 this season. Chicago snapped a six-game skid and improved to 23-35.\n\nNothing about the night suggested that, with better health and luck, everything may eventually click into place.\n\nPaul George acknowledged as much in the locker room.\n\nGet top local stories in Philly delivered to you every morning. Sign up for NBC Philadelphia's News Headlines newsletter.\n\n“Regardless of who’s playing, who’s not playing, to have (aspirations) or for this group to believe we can be … not even to get to the playoffs, but to make a push toward it … we’ve shown no signs of a team that will compete,” George said. “We just don’t have the habits of a champion or that a playoff-contending team would have.\n\n“So to be honest right now, it’s a little far-fetched. All we can do is work hard, try to just keep going for one another, but we’ve shown no signs of — forget championship, but a playoff-contending team here.”\n\nIndeed, the Sixers’ outing made it very logical to think more about draft lottery odds and the team’s top-six protected first-round pick than any sort of potential play-in tournament exploits.\n\nThe Sixers ended the game with seven players out because of injuries. Joel Embiid is sidelined again by his left knee injury and the Sixers are assessing his options. Guerschon Yabusele hurt both eyes against Chicago, including a corneal abrasion to his right. Quentin Grimes exited with right knee soreness.\n\nOn top of escalating injuries and ever-shifting starting lineups, the Sixers have grown accustomed to dismal defense and losing this year. Since Jan. 1, they’ve gone 7-20 and ranked 26th in the NBA in net rating, 30th in defensive rating.\n\nAccording to Cleaning the Glass, they’re 28th on the season in how often opponents have gotten shots at the rim and 29th in opponents’ field goal percentage at the rim.\n\n“Just have to be more dialed in,” George said. “More effort, more energy and more pride on the defensive end. Again, it’s the same conversations we’ve been having. It baffles me how (easily) we give up layups in this league. I just don’t understand it.”\n\nOf course, head coach Nick Nurse’s postgame message to the Sixers didn’t revolve around sophisticated strategies.\n\n“I just said there’s a lot of games left and we’ve got to be professional,” he said. “We’ve got to go out and play. First of all, everybody needs to look at themselves and what they can do better, and then look at what they can do better for the team. And do our jobs, man. Be professional.”\n\nNurse called his team’s showing “very, very disappointing.”\n\nTyrese Maxey certainly shared that view, describing the Sixers’ performance as “unacceptable.”\n\n“It’s hard right now,” Maxey said. “It’s very difficult. It’s hard to see a vision … but we have a lot of games left, a lot of time left with each other. I think one of the messages that I’m going to give is we all started playing basketball because we love the game and it’s fun. A lot of us should be competitive. That’s how I feel.\n\n“I play the game because I love it. I play the game because I’m extremely competitive and I like to win, and I’ve got a lot of pride about winning, just putting forth the effort that I put in. … When we step out on the court, we’ve got to go out there and show that.”\n\nOn one hand, it would reasonable to say just about everything needs to change for the Sixers.\n\nOn the other hand, George kept it rather simple.\n\n“We’ve got to want to do it,” he said. “It’s what it comes down to. You’ve got to want to do it. Either you commit to put your body on the line or you don’t.”",

The court was divided 5-3 on throwing out Glossip's conviction, with conservative Justice Neil Gorsuch not participating.\n\nJustice Sonia Sotomayor, writing for the court, said the prosecution \"violated its constitutional obligation to correct false testimony.\" As a result, \"Glossip is entitled to a new trial,\" she wrote.\n\nGlossip, 62, was convicted of arranging the murder in 1997 of his boss at the Oklahoma City motel where they worked.\n\nGet top local stories in Philly delivered to you every morning. Sign up for NBC Philadelphia's News Headlines newsletter.\n\nHe has been on death row since 1998 and has faced imminent execution on several occasions.\n\nGlossip's latest appeal received a major boost when the state attorney general, Republican Gentner Drummond, agreed that the conviction was unsound and asked the court to rule in his favor.\n\nThe conviction relied largely on the testimony of key witness Justin Sneed, who carried out the 1997 murder. Sneed, who pleaded guilty and avoided a death sentence, testified that Glossip had hired him to kill motel owner Barry Van Treese.\n\nThe appeal revolved around claims that prosecutors withheld information about Sneed and that he gave false testimony at trial. Prosecutors knew but did not disclose at Glossip’s second trial in 2004 that Sneed had been diagnosed with bipolar disorder and prescribed lithium after his arrest.\n\nSneed also falsely testified that he had never seen a psychiatrist.\n\nAfter an investigation, Drummond concluded that because Glossip’s conviction rested significantly on Sneed’s credibility, it should not be sustained.\n\nThe state has stopped short of agreeing with Glossip’s claim that he is innocent.\n\nThe Supreme Court has a 6-3 conservative majority that rarely intervenes to prevent executions from taking place, but occasionally steps in when there has been a clear miscarriage of justice.\n\nDespite Drummond’s findings, an Oklahoma appeals court upheld the death sentence last year, and the state’s pardon and parole board voted against granting Glossip clemency.\n\nThe original prosecutors who had worked on the case, Connie Smothermon and Gary Ackley, disputed Drummond's account and said they had not been properly consulted during the investigation.\n\nThey wrote a letter questioning the new findings that was attached to an amicus brief filed by relatives of Van Treese that urged the court to uphold Glossip’s conviction.\n\nThe Supreme Court previously signaled an interest in Glossip’s case in May 2023 by stepping in to prevent him from being executed. The court also blocked Glossip’s execution in 2015 in separate litigation over the state’s lethal injection procedure.\n\nThis article first appeared on NBCNews.com. Read more from NBC News here:",

        "content": "President Donald Trump backed Elon Musk’s demand that federal employees explain their recent accomplishments by the end of Monday or risk getting fired, even as government agency officials were told that compliance with Musk’s edict was voluntary.\n\nConfusion and anger over the situation spawned new litigation and added to turmoil within the federal workforce.\n\n“What he’s doing is saying, ‘Are you actually working?’” Trump said in the Oval Office during a meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron. “And then, if you don’t answer, like, you’re sort of semi-fired or you’re fired, because a lot of people aren’t answering because they don’t even exist.”\n\nThe Republican president said Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency has found “hundreds of billions of dollars in fraud” as he suggested that federal paychecks are going to nonexistent employees. He did not present evidence for his claims.\n\nGet top local stories in Philly delivered to you every morning. Sign up for NBC Philadelphia's News Headlines newsletter.\n\nEven as Trump and Musk pressed their case, the Office of Personnel Management informed agency leaders that their workers were not required to respond by the deadline of 11:59 p.m. ET Monday.\n\nIn an email to its workforce earlier Monday obtained by NBC News, the Justice Department said that during a meeting with the interagency Chief Human Capital Officers Council, OPM informed agencies that employee responses to the email are voluntary. OPM also clarified that despite what Musk had posted, not responding to the email does not equate to a resignation, the email said.\n\nMusk says workers 'will be given another chance' as pushback mounts\n\nThe conflicting directives led to varying advice for federal employees, depending on where they work. Some were told to answer the request for a list of five things that they did last week, others were informed it was optional, and others were directed not to answer at all.\n\nMusk bristled at resistance, saying federal workers “hate even the tiniest amount of accountability.” He continued to threaten firings hours after employees were told that they didn’t need to comply with his demands.\n\n“Subject to the discretion of the President, they will be given another chance,” he posted on X, his social media platform. “Failure to respond a second time will result in termination.”\n\nAttorneys representing unions, businesses, veterans and conservation organizations filed an updated lawsuit in federal court in California on Monday, arguing Musk had violated the law by threatening mass firings.\n\nIn an appearance with French President Macron at the White House, President Trump commented on Elon Musk’s demand over the weekend that federal employees detail their work accomplishments in an email.\n\nThe lawsuit, spearheaded by the State Democracy Defenders Fund, called it “one of the most massive employment frauds in the history of this country.”\n\nAnna Kelly, a White House deputy press secretary, criticized the litigation by saying “in the time it took these employees on taxpayer-funded salaries to file a frivolous lawsuit, they could have briefly recapped their accomplishments to their managers, as is common in the private sector, 100 times over.”\n\nMusk is leading Trump’s efforts to overhaul and downsize the federal government. They’ve urged employees to resign, directed agencies to lay off probationary workers and halted work at some agencies altogether.\n\nThere has been pushback in protests around Washington and from within the government. The Office of Special Counsel, a watchdog for the federal workforce, said Monday that the firing of several probationary workers may be illegal. Trump is trying to fire the office’s leader, Hampton Dellinger, in a case that has reached the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nDellinger asked the U.S. Merit Systems Protection Board to stop layoffs of six employees, but suggested that many more workers should also be protected from losing their jobs.\n\nThere are also signs Musk is testing the limits of his influence. Some administration officials — including some of Trump’s most strident allies, such as FBI Director Kash Patel — have told employees not to respond to the email requesting five things they did, citing privacy or security concerns and noting that agencies have their own processes for evaluating employees.\n\n“When and if further information is required, we will coordinate the responses. For now, please pause any responses,” Patel wrote in an email.\n\nIt has been the most significant public divergence between the billionaire entrepreneur and Senate-approved Cabinet leaders who have otherwise been enthusiastic about fulfilling Musk’s objectives.\n\nTrump dismissed the idea there was any kind of split involving his most powerful adviser.\n\n“They don’t mean that in any way combatively with Elon,” he said, adding that “everyone thought it was a pretty ingenious idea.”\n\nThe latest turbulence began over the weekend, when Trump posted on his social media website, “ELON IS DOING A GREAT JOB, BUT I WOULD LIKE TO SEE HIM GET MORE AGGRESSIVE.”\n\nMusk followed by saying “all federal employees will shortly receive an email requesting to understand what they got done last week,” and he claimed “failure to respond will be taken as a resignation.” The directive echoed how he has managed his own companies.\n\nOPM sent out its own request afterward.\n\n“Please reply to this email with approx. 5 bullets of what you accomplished last week and cc your manager,” the message said. However, it said nothing about the potential for employees being fired for noncompliance.\n\nThere was swift resistance from several key U.S. agencies led by the president’s loyalists — including the State Department, Homeland Security and the Pentagon — which instructed their employees over the weekend not to respond. Lawmakers in both major political parties said Musk’s mandate may be illegal.\n\nWhat have federal agencies told their employees?\n\nJustice Department employees were told in an email Monday morning that they don’t need to respond to the request “due to the confidential and sensitive nature of the Department’s work.”\n\nBut employees in the U.S. attorney’s office in Washington were instructed to respond “in general terms,” leaving out case-specific or otherwise sensitive information. In an email viewed by The Associated Press, attorneys were provided with guidance about how to respond about the number of court hearings they attended, defendants they charged, cases they resolved or other tasks.\n\nThe Department of Health and Human Services told staff that “there is no HHS expectation that HHS employees respond.” If anyone wanted to write back, they were directed to be vague.\n\n“Assume that what you write will be read by malign foreign actors and tailor your response accordingly,” said an email to employees.\n\nEducation Department workers were directed to comply on Monday morning. “The email is legitimate and employees should respond,” wrote Rachel Oglesby, chief of staff at the department. She added that “frontline supervisors will evaluate responses and non-responses.”\n\nCharles Ezell, the acting director of OPM, suggested that Musk’s request may lead to new expectations for employees. Officials “may consider incorporating an expectation that employees submit weekly accomplishments bullets,” he wrote in an email to staff.\n\nThousands of government employees have already been forced out of the federal workforce — either by being fired or through a “deferred resignation″ offer — during the first month of Trump’s second term. There’s no official figure available for the total firings or layoffs, but the AP has tallied hundreds of thousands of workers who are being affected. Many work outside Washington.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Steve Peoples in New York, Eric Tucker, Amanda Seitz, Byron Tau, Ellen Knickmeyer, Matthew Perrone, Alanna Durkin Richer and Tara Copp in Washington and Valerie Gonzalez in McAllen, Texas, contributed to this report.",

Sign up for NBC Philadelphia's News Headlines newsletter.\n\nThousands of federal government employees have been fired and laid off across the country as part of the Trump administration’s efforts to shrink the size of the federal workforce. The cuts are being led by billionaire Elon Musk and his Department of Government Efficiency.\n\nThe White House initially offered a “deferred resignation” proposal in exchange for financial incentives, like months of paid leave, to almost all federal employees who opted to leave their jobs by Feb. 6.\n\nBut just before that deadline, a federal judge blocked Trump’s plan, wanting to hear arguments from the administration and the labor unions, which said the offer was illegal.\n\nAccording to the Office of Personnel Management, about 75,000 federal employees had accepted the offer as of Feb. 12.\n\nThen on Feb. 13, the Trump administration ordered agencies to lay off probationary federal employees, workers who were on the job for less than a year and who have yet to gain civil service protection. Just last week, around 400 Philadelphia IRS employees were among the thousands of probationary workers across the country who were laid off.\n\n“As to how we’re doing, the only answer is poorly,” Alex Berman, the executive vice president of the National Treasury Union Chapter 71, which represents Philly-area IRS workers, told NBC10 on Monday. “I have been on my phone constantly talking to the more than 400 people at my chapter alone who were let go under false pretenses. Now we’re looking at, if you don’t do X, you’ll be fired.”\n\nBerman referred to an email that was sent to federal workers last week asking them to detail their work.\n\nMonday’s rally took place at Independence National Historical Park where two employees were recently laid off, according to a union official.\n\n“I truly worry about the future of our workforce,” Boyle said Monday. “Imagine attempting to recruit the best and the brightest right now to join public service. Why would anyone sign up for this treatment?”\n\nNBC10 reached out to the White House for comment. We have not yet heard back.",

        "content": "When Molly Smith went for her first mammogram in 2021, she had reason to be wary. Her grandmother, mother, sister and another family member have all been diagnosed with breast cancer.\n\nThe mammogram detected abnormal tissue — said Smith, 46, a mother of two from Myrtle Beach, South Carolina — and more testing was necessary. To her great relief, Smith received a clean report following an ultrasound, MRI and biopsy. But she incurred bills of more than $1,000 that her insurance didn’t cover.\n\nSmith is one of millions of American women who are at high risk for breast cancer but whose insurance does not cover the costs of follow-on screenings needed to detect the disease. Breast cancer can be hidden in mammograms for many women, so doctors recommend additional screenings, which include ultrasounds, MRIs and tomosynthesis, a kind of 3D mammogram.\n\nMolly Smith (NBC News)\n\nGet top local stories in Philly delivered to you every morning. Sign up for NBC Philadelphia's News Headlines newsletter.\n\n“With ultrasounds you find cancers that are not evident on mammograms,” said Dr. Madhavi Raghu, a radiation oncologist in western Connecticut. “If tomosynthesis is normal and the ultrasound is normal, the likelihood a patient has underlying cancer is quite low.”\n\nWomen with dense breast tissue, a condition affecting roughly half of women over 40, are at special risk for breast cancer, according to the Food and Drug Administration. The condition makes it harder to spot cancer on a mammogram, so last year the FDA began requiring mammogram providers to notify women with dense breast tissue that they could need further evaluation and screenings to rule out cancer.\n\nBut such screenings cost money, out of pocket, for most women. While one mammogram per year is typically covered by private health insurance plans, they don’t generally reimburse fully for additional screenings.\n\nAnd last year, doctors in Connecticut, New York, North Carolina and Texas say Medicare stopped reimbursing for the same breast cancer ultrasound screenings it had reimbursed for in 2023. Raghu provided NBC News with several redacted patient records showing Medicare declining reimbursements in 2024 for ultrasound breast screenings it reimbursed in 2023.\n\nThe lack of coverage puts women with Medicare and those with private insurance in a terrible bind.\n\n“You know you need to go back,” said Smith, who has private insurance, “and there’s always that looming question: Am I a ticking time bomb, and what is it going to cost me?”\n\nMolly Smith, right, with her sister Sundi, left, grandmother Mary and cousin Hazel. (Courtesy Molly Smith)\n\nA spokeswoman for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services said in a statement that ultrasound or MRI scans are only covered by Medicare when provided as a diagnostic test.\n\n“If the scans were provided as a screening test, then Medicare is unable to cover those by law,” she said.\n\nScreening is considered a routine form of testing for patients with no symptoms, while diagnostic testing investigates symptoms or abnormalities found during a screening. The CMS spokeswoman said the agency’s “coverage policy” had not changed.\n\nUltrasound screenings for women with dense breast tissue, under the CMS interpretation, would not be investigating symptoms. Physicians question this explanation because there is only one reimbursement code for a breast ultrasound, regardless of whether it is proposed as a screening or a diagnostic test. The recent denials by Medicare appear to place all breast ultrasounds into the category that is not covered.\n\nPhysicians say there is another problem with Medicare not reimbursing for ultrasound and other screenings: Private insurers often follow CMS’ lead on reimbursement decisions.\n\nLimiting reimbursement for cancer screenings translates to higher out-of-pocket costs for women who need them. Unreimbursed expenses are rising, research published in the journal Radiology shows, as more women sign up for high-deductible insurance plans to reduce their health care costs. The study also confirms a fear many doctors express: Faced with additional costs for necessary screenings, many women just won’t get them. Some 21% of the women surveyed for the Radiology study said they would decline additional screenings if they had to pay for them.\n\n“The fact that mammograms are not always a good standard or indicator is a problem we have to raise awareness on,” said Doris Caldwell, a survivor of inflammatory breast cancer in Spearfish, South Dakota. Because inflammatory breast cancer doesn’t typically show up in mammograms, Caldwell has MRIs annually. This year, she said she expects to pay $1,200 out of pocket.\n\nDoris Caldwell with her husband, Joel, and a granddaughter. (Courtesy Doris Caldwell)\n\n“It feels like you shouldn’t have to struggle to get the extra screening you need for early detection,” Caldwell added. “The earlier you catch cancer, the cheaper it is to treat. This should be easy.”\n\nAdding to the urgency: The American Cancer Society’s most recent statistics on breast cancer found that between 2012 and 2021 diagnoses of the disease rose faster among younger women — those under 50 — than among women over 50.\n\n“Out-of-pocket cost sharing is a significant barrier for those individuals who need access to multiple early detection services in order to find cancer at an earlier stage when treatment is more effective,” said Lisa Lacasse, president of the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network. “Removing cost sharing for each intervention in the screening process is a critical step toward ending cancer as we know it, for everyone.”\n\nLast year, Iowa lawmakers passed legislation requiring private health insurers to cover the entire cost of additional breast cancer screenings, such as ultrasounds and MRIs, while a Massachusetts law from last fall requires insurers to cover ultrasounds and other screenings without increasing patients’ out-of-pocket costs.\n\nLegislators in Connecticut, Florida, Indiana, Hawaii, South Carolina and Virginia have recently introduced bills that would require insurers to cover these additional screenings, according to the American College of Radiology. The American Cancer Society says it hopes to see similar legislation passed soon in Nebraska, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and Wisconsin.\n\nOther states, such as South Dakota and Montana, have tried unsuccessfully to pass similar legislation. A recent effort in Montana failed, distressing Shelley Emslie, a schoolteacher and breast cancer survivor in Bigfork, Montana. She needs regular MRIs to detect a return of her cancer; the costs of extra screenings approximate $3,500 each year, she said, charges her employer’s high-deductible insurance plan does not cover.\n\n“I just know there are other women out there not getting the screening because of the cost,” Emslie told NBC News. “You’re going to have people who have a mammogram and need additional screening, but they’re not going to go back in.”\n\nThis story first appeared on NBCNews.com.

        "content": "A Louisiana landscape of centuries-old sugar cane plantations and enduring Afro-Creole culture along the Mississippi River had been eligible for receiving rare federal protection following a multi-year review by the National Park Service.\n\nBut this month, the agency withdrew the 11-mile stretch of land known as Great River Road from consideration for National Historic Landmark designation at the request of state officials, who celebrated the move as a win for economic development.\n\nCommunity organizations bemoaned the decision as undermining efforts to preserve the rich yet endangered cultural legacies of free African American communities that grew out of slavery.\n\nThe region, in the heart of Louisiana's heavily industrialized Chemical Corridor in St. John the Baptist Parish, has been at the center of conflicts between grassroots community groups challenging the expansion of polluting industrial facilities and officials and business leaders doubling down on their importance for sustaining local economies. The area is among the most threatened by climate injustice in the nation, according to the Environmental Defense Fund's climate vulnerability index.\n\nGet top local stories in Philly delivered to you every morning. Sign up for NBC Philadelphia's News Headlines newsletter.\n\nAshley Rogers, executive director of the nearby Whitney Plantation, said the decision to remove the Great River Road region from consideration for federally granted recognition was due to the “changing priorities” of the Trump administration, the latest blow to “a culture under attack.”\n\n“It’s 100% because of the politics of the current administration, it’s not because we’ve suddenly decided that this place doesn’t matter,” Rogers said.\n\nA multi-year National Park Service study on the area completed in October concluded that the “exceptional integrity” of the Great River Road landscape conveys “the feeling of living and working in the plantation system in the American South.\"\n\nPlantation buildings are so well-preserved that director Quentin Tarantino used them while filming “Django Unchained,” to capture the antebellum era. But there's also a rich and overlooked history of the enslaved people who worked the plantations, their burial sites likely hidden in the surrounding cane fields and many of their descendants still living in tight-knit communities nearby.\n\nThe study deemed the region eligible to gain the same federal recognition as around 2,600 of the nation’s most important historical sites, including Mount Vernon, George Washington’s estate and Monticello, Thomas Jefferson’s residence.\n\nFort Knox is the site of the U.S. Treasury’s Bullion Depository for American gold reserves in Kentucky.\n\nHowever, the determination was “premature and untimely” given that a grain terminal that threatened to impact historic properties was no longer planned, said the National Park Service’s Joy Beasley, who oversees the designation of historic landmarks, in a Feb. 13 letter to the Army Corps of Engineers.\n\nBeasley’s letter stated the reversal was prompted by a request from the state’s Department of Environmental Quality, which is tasked with regulating environmental protection and has made no secret of its support for industrial expansion.\n\nThe head of the department, Aurelia S. Giacometto, framed the decision as freeing the region from federal meddling and oversight and opening up pathways for development.\n\n“I’m grateful that the Trump Administration understands that states and localities are better at determining their interests relating to clean air, water and developing industry than leaving crucial decisions like those to Washington,” Giacometto said in a statement.\n\nPort of South Louisiana CEO Paul Matthew said in a press release that companies are clamoring to develop and expand along the Mississippi River, which would improve quality of life and spur economic growth without sacrificing cultural legacies.\n\n“If you really want to lift people out of poverty, you get them work and increase job opportunity,” Republican Gov. Jeff Landry said.\n\nLocal historical and community organizations believe the region can instead improve its economy by focusing on preserving and promoting its history.\n\nRamshackled homes and shuttered buildings in the area are endemic of longstanding underinvestment in these communities, but it's not too late to reverse this trend through means besides industrialization, said Joy Banner, co-founder of the local nonprofit The Descendants Project, which is restoring historical properties in Great River Road.\n\nBanner helped lead efforts to successfully halt the construction of a towering $600 million industrial grain terminal that would have been built in her hometown, the predominantly Black community of Wallace — spurring the National Park Service's study. A spokesperson for the Army Corps of Engineers said any future industrial development in the Great River Road would still need to consider the potential impacts on historical and cultural heritage.\n\nIn the region's Willow Grove neighborhood, 76-year-old Isabella Poche still trims the grass and repaints the tombs at the cemetery where her mother, sisters and other relatives were buried with help from the Black community's generations-old mutual aid society she now leads. Beyond the furrows of the sugar cane fields where her family once worked, a large plantation home stands in the distance by the river's bank. It's a peaceful place she hopes to see protected.\n\n“I don’t want to move anywhere else,” Poche said. “I've been here all my life.\"",

        "content": "Pope Francis was well enough to meet with the Vatican secretary of state to approve new decrees for possible saints and make some major governing decisions that suggest he is getting essential work done and looking ahead despite being hospitalized in critical condition with double pneumonia.\n\nThe audience, which occurred Monday, signaled that the machinery of the Vatican is still grinding on even though doctors have warned the prognosis for the 88-year-old Francis is guarded.\n\nDecisions on saints and a formal meeting of cardinals\n\nThe Vatican's Tuesday noon bulletin contained a series of significant decisions, most importantly that Francis had met with Cardinal Pietro Parolin and Archbishop Edgar Pena Parra, the so-called Vatican “substitute” or chief of staff. It was the first known time the pope had met with Parolin, who is essentially the Vatican prime minister, since his Feb. 14 hospitalization.\n\nGet top local stories in Philly delivered to you every morning. Sign up for NBC Philadelphia's News Headlines newsletter.\n\nDuring the audience, Francis approved decrees for two new saints and five people for beatification — the first step toward sainthood. Francis also decided to “convene a consistory about the future canonizations.”\n\nFrancis regularly approves decrees from the Vatican's saint-making office when he is at the Vatican, albeit during audiences with the head of the office, not Parolin. But the calling of a consistory, which is a formal meeting of cardinals, was also significant and forward-looking, given his illness.\n\nNo date was set for the meeting. But it was also at a banal consistory to set dates for canonizations on Feb. 11, 2013, that Pope Benedict XVI announced, in Latin, that he would resign because he couldn't keep up with the rigors of the papacy. Francis has said he, too, would consider resigning if he found himself in that situation, after Benedict “opened the door” and became the first pope in 600 years to retire.\n\nGiovanna Chirri, the reporter for the Italian news agency ANSA who was covering the consistory that day and broke the story because she understood Latin, said she didn't think Francis would follow in Benedict's footsteps, “even if some would want it.”\n\n“I could be wrong, but I hope not,” she told The Associated Press. “As long as he's alive, the world and the church need him.”\n\nFrancis' English biographer, Austen Ivereigh, said it was possible and that all that matters is that Francis be “wholly free to make the right decision.”\n\n“The pope has always said that the papacy is for life, and he has shown that there is no problem with a frail and elderly pope,” Ivereigh said. “But he has also said that should he ever have a long-term degenerative or debilitating condition which prevents him from fully carrying out the exercise of the papal ministry, he would consider resigning. And so would any pope.”\n\nFrancis' ideas about resignation\n\nFrancis has said that if he were to resign, he would live in Rome, outside the Vatican, and be called ''emeritus bishop of Rome\" rather than emeritus pope given the problems that occurred with Benedict's experiment as a retired pope. Despite his best efforts, Benedict remained a point of reference for conservatives before he died in 2022, and his home inside the Vatican gardens something of a pilgrimage destination for the right.\n\nFrancis has also written a letter of resignation, to be invoked if he became medically incapacitated.\n\nIn addition to the audience with Parolin, the Vatican released Francis' message for Lent, the period leading up to Easter, in yet another forward-looking sign. In a subsequent bulletin, Francis named a handful of new bishops for Brazil, a new archbishop for Vancouver and modified the law for the Vatican City State to create a new hierarchy.\n\nFrancis recently named the first-ever woman to head the city-state, Sister Raffaella Petrini, who takes over March 1. In the announcement Tuesday, Francis specifically empowered her to lead and to tell her priestly deputies what to do.\n\nMany if not all of these decisions were likely in the works for some time. But the Vatican has said Francis has been doing some work in the hospital, including signing documents, and regardless there is no provision in the Catholic Church to transfer full papal power except in the case of a resignation or death of a pope.\n\nThe only other outsider who is known to have visited the pope, other than his personal secretaries and medical personnel, is Italian Premier Giorgia Meloni, Meloni, who visited Feb. 19.\n\nThe pope slept well\n\nOn Tuesday morning, the Vatican’s typically brief morning update said: “The pope slept well, all night.”\n\nThe previous evening, doctors had said he remained in critical condition at Rome's Gemelli hospital with double pneumonia but reported a “slight improvement” in some laboratory results. In the most upbeat bulletin in days, the Vatican said Francis had resumed work from his hospital room, calling a parish in Gaza City that he has kept in touch with since the war there began.\n\nDoctors have said the condition of the Argentine pope, who had part of one lung removed as a young man, is touch-and-go, given his age, fragility and pre-existing lung disease before the pneumonia set in.\n\nBut in Monday’s update, they said he hadn’t had any more respiratory crises since Saturday, and the flow and concentration of supplemental oxygen has been slightly reduced. The slight kidney insufficiency detected on Sunday was not causing alarm at the moment, doctors said.\n\nAllies and ordinary faithful hopeful\n\nFrancis’ right-wing critics have been spreading dire rumors about his condition, but his allies have cheered him on and expressed hope that he will pull through. Many noted that from the very night of his election as pope, Francis had asked for the prayers of ordinary faithful, a request he repeats daily.\n\n“I’m a witness of everything he did for the church, with a great love of Jesus,” Honduran Cardinal Oscar Rodriguez Maradiaga told La Repubblica. “Humanly speaking, I don’t think it’s time for him to go to Paradise.”\n\nAt Gemelli on a rainy Tuesday morning, ordinary Romans and visitors alike were also praying for the pope. Hoang Phuc Nguyen, who lives in Canada but was visiting Rome to participate in a Holy Year pilgrimage, took the time to come to Gemelli to say a special prayer for the pope at the statue of St. John Paul II outside the main entrance.\n\n“We heard that he is in the hospital right now and we are very worried about his health,” Nguyen said. \"He is our father and it is our responsibility to pray for him.”\n\n___\n\nGiovanna dell'Orto contributed.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press religion coverage receives support through the AP’s collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

        "content": "The Eagles’ signature play is under attack again.\n\nAn unnamed team has reportedly proposed to ban the Tush Push/Brotherly Shove, NFL executive vice president of football operations Troy Vincent said, per NFL Network’s Judy Battista.\n\nWe’ll see what happens in the next couple of months.\n\nQuestion on the Tush Push play is whether it could be modified to keep some semblance of the play intact. The play is run so infrequently that there isn’t enough injury data for the league to push for a ban based on injuries alone. — Judy Battista (@judybattista) February 24, 2025\n\nGet top local stories in Philly delivered to you every morning. Sign up for NBC Philadelphia's News Headlines newsletter.\n\nAccording to Dianna Russini of The Athletic, the Packers are the team that has proposed this rule change. The Eagles beat the Packers this past postseason in the wild-card round on their way to Super Bowl LIX.\n\nThis, of course, is not the first time there has been talk of banning the Tush Push. It came up a couple of years ago but a rule change proposal never got on the voting floor. If the rule change is officially proposed, it could come to a vote at the NFL’s annual league meetings in Palm Beach, Florida, next month. Any rule change proposal would need 24 of 32 owners to sign off on it.\n\nAfter the last Super Bowl season in 2022, there seemed to be a little push to ban the play.\n\n“All I know is everything we're doing is legal and it works,” Eagles GM Howie Roseman said at the 2023 combine. “And just because people do something that’s really good, doesn't mean it should be outlawed.”\n\nThe Eagles have had a lot of success running this particular version of the QB sneak and other teams have failed to replicate that success. The Eagles would probably tell you that the “push” element of the play is not the most important.\n\nThe play starts with having good offensive line play. The Eagles had that on their interior this season with Landon Dickerson, Cam Jurgens and Mekhi Becton. It also helps to have QB Jalen Hurts. Having a QB who can squat 600 pounds is helpful in these situations.\n\nHere’s what Vincent said about the play in December 2023:\n\n\"I think there was a report that either the league office or the Commissioner was looking to eliminate this play. That was false,\" Vincent said, via NFL.com. \"We've been monitoring this play from Week 1 of the regular season. This play has evolved. It has evolved, which coaches told us it would. We're seeing passes come out of that formation. People doing things differently than what we've seen a year ago. Everyone doesn't have the Philly success rate, but people are trying it.\n\n\"I would just say, Philly does it better than everyone else. That's a fact. On those fourth-and-1, fourth-and-inches situations, we've seen others — I think I've reviewed 78 plays on Friday of just the push play itself — just looking at formation. Is it one-back, two backs pushing, three backs? They're very effective.\n\n\"And that's what we don't want to do. So talking to the membership, you don't want to punish anyone for doing something well. People have tried different things to stop it. Have not had success. That's why bringing it to the membership just to say this play has evolved. Other people are doing it, and we've seen some pretty good football from the evolution of the original formation.\"",

Online\n\nJimmy Kimmel's heart is full.\n\nNearly one year after his and wife Molly McNearney's son Billy Kimmel underwent his third open heart surgery, the late night talk show host exclusively shared with E! News that the 7-year-old is \"in perfect health.\"\n\n\"Billy is about to turn 8,\" Jimmy Kimmel raved at Keep Memory Alive's Power of Love Gala in Las Vegas Feb. 22. \"He's doing great. He's very healthy.\"\n\nGet top local stories in Philly delivered to you every morning. Sign up for NBC Philadelphia's News Headlines newsletter.\n\nAnd that's why the 57-year-old said it \"means a lot\" to be honored at the star-studded fundraiser, which benefits Cleveland Clinic Lou Ruvo Center for Brain Health in his home state of Nevada. (For more from his interview, tune into E! News tonight, Feb. 24, at 11 p.m.)\n\nHaving previously received an outpouring of support from the health community during his son's medical ordeal, Jimmy Kimmel — who also shares 10-year-old daughter Jane Kimmel with Molly, as well as kids Katie Kimmel, 33, and Kevin Kimmel, 31, with ex-wife Gina Maddy — thought it was only right to pass on the love to another cause.\n\nREAD Kirsten Dunst and Jimmy Kimmel Reveal Their Sons Got Into a Fight at School\n\n\"It's very special when people say, 'Oh, we're praying for your son,'\" Jimmy Kimmel explained. \"People throw those words around lightly, but when you hear them about yourself, they're very meaningful.\"\n\nEmphasizing the importance of supporting others, he added, \"It is really helpful to know that you can go to a place where they are on the cutting edge of figuring this stuff out, hopefully curing these terrible brain-related diseases and conditions that that people have.\"\n\nJimmy Kimmel is recalling partying with Taylor Swift and her boyfriend Travis Kelce at a party packed with A-Listers.\n\nThe comedian's son was diagnosed with a rare congenital heart defect three hours after his birth in 2017. His condition required immediate surgery, leading the then-newborn to undergo what would be his first operation.\n\n\"It was the longest three hours of my life,\" Jimmy Kimmel recounted during a May 2017 episode of his eponymous talk show. \"They didn't do everything. He'll have to have another open heart surgery in three to six months.\"\n\nBilly Kimmel went through his second surgery that December. In May 2023, he underwent his third operation to have a new valve put in his heart.\n\n\"Walking around this hospital,\" Jimmy Kimmel wrote on Instagram last year, \"meeting parents at their most vulnerable, children in pain and the miracle workers who do everything in their considerable power to save them is a humbling experience.\"\n\nHe added, \"Thanks to those loving strangers who took time to pray for and send positive energy to our baby.\"",

        "source": "https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/",
        "content": "Nearly 40% of the federal contracts that the Trump administration claims to have canceled as part of its signature cost-cutting program aren’t expected to save the government any money, the administration's own data shows.\n\nThe Department of Government Efficiency run by Elon Musk last week published an initial list of 1,125 contracts that it terminated in recent weeks across the federal government. Data published on DOGE's “Wall of Receipts” shows that more than one-third of the contract cancellations, 417 in all, are expected to yield no savings.\n\nThat’s usually because the total value of the contracts has already been fully obligated, which means the government has a legal requirement to spend the funds for the goods or services it purchased and in many cases has already done so.\n\n“It’s like confiscating used ammunition after it’s been shot when there’s nothing left in it. It doesn’t accomplish any policy objective,” said Charles Tiefer, a retired University of Baltimore law professor and expert on government contracting law. “Their terminating so many contracts pointlessly obviously doesn’t accomplish anything for saving money.”\n\nGet top local stories in Philly delivered to you every morning. Sign up for NBC Philadelphia's News Headlines newsletter.\n\nDozens of them were for already-paid subscriptions to The Associated Press, Politico and other media services that the administration said it would discontinue. Others were for research studies that have been awarded, training that has taken place, software that has been purchased and interns that have come and gone.\n\nAn administration official said it made sense to cancel contracts that are seen as potential dead weight, even if the moves do not yield any savings. The official was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\nIn all, DOGE data says the 417 contracts in question had a total value of $478 million. Dozens of other canceled contracts are expected to yield little if any savings.\n\n“It's too late for the government to change its mind on many of these contracts and walk away from its payment obligation,” said Tiefer, who served on the Commission on Wartime Contracting in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\nDuring a joint news conference on Monday, French President Emmanuel Macron interrupted President Donald Trump to clarify, “We provided real money.”\n\nTiefer said DOGE appeared to be taking a “slash and burn” approach to cutting contracts, which he said could damage the performance of government agencies. He said savings could be made instead by working with agency contracting officers and inspectors general to find efficiencies, an approach the administration has not taken.\n\nDOGE says the overall contract cancellations are expected to save more than $7 billion so far, an amount that has been questioned as inflated by independent experts.\n\nThe canceled contracts were to purchase a wide range of goods and services.\n\nThe Department of Housing and Urban Development awarded a contract in September to purchase and install office furniture at various branches. While the contract does not expire until later this year, federal records show the agency had already agreed to spend the maximum $567,809 with a furniture company.\n\nThe U.S. Agency for International Development negotiated a $145,549 contract last year to clean the carpet at its headquarters in Washington. But the full amount had already been obligated to a firm that is owned by a Native American tribe based in Michigan.\n\nAnother already-spent $249,600 contract went to a Washington, D.C., firm to help prepare the Department of Transportation for the recent transition from the Biden to the Trump administration.\n\nSome of the canceled contracts were intended to modernize and improve the way government works, which would seem to be at odds with DOGE’s cost-cutting mission.\n\nOne of the largest, for instance, went to a consulting firm to help carry out a reorganization at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, which led the agency’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The maximum $13.6 million had already been obligated to Deloitte Consulting LLP for help with the restructuring, which included closing several research offices.\n\n___\n\nFoley reported from Iowa City, Iowa.",

Josh Shapiro said Monday that President Donald Trump's administration has freed up billions in federal aid.\n\nPennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro said Monday that President Donald Trump's administration has freed up billions in federal aid.\n\nHARRISBURG, Pa. -- Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro said Monday that President Donald Trump 's administration has freed up billions in federal aid that the Democrat had accused it of withholding illegally and unconstitutionally.\n\nShapiro said in a news conference that more than $2 billion that his administration had identified as either frozen or held up by an unspecified review was now accessible to state agencies.\n\nShapiro sued in federal court over the aid on Feb. 13, after federal courts had repeatedly rejected the Trump administration's sweeping pause on federal funding and questioned whether the Trump administration was ignoring court orders.\n\nShapiro also said he pressed his case in conversations with senior Trump administration officials while he was in Washington, D.C., over the weekend. The U.S. attorney's office in Philadelphia, which represents the federal agencies named in the lawsuit, declined comment Monday.\n\nPennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro on Tuesday, Feb. 4, 2025, in Harrisburg, Pa. AP Photo/Matt Rourke\n\nIn federal court in Rhode Island, Trump administration lawyers, however, have argued that the government's move to freeze funds was legal and asked a judge to reject a request by nearly two dozen Democratic states for a preliminary injunction.\n\nAdministration lawyers characterized the freeze as simply a \"pause\" to consider how best to use federal funds. They contended the case was moot since the Office of Management and Budget had rescinded its memo in late January freezing federal grants and loans.\n\nMuch of the stalled grant funding identified by Shapiro's administration was passed by Congress in signature laws signed by former President Joe Biden, including his landmark 2022 climate law, the Inflation Reduction Act, and his 2021 infrastructure law.\n\nThe lawsuit had said aid was being withheld from programs that distribute money to upgrade energy efficiency in homes, plug abandoned gas wells, clean up abandoned mine land, improve municipal water and sewer systems and reimburse industry for cutting their planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nFive federal agencies were named as defendants: the White House Office of Management and Budget, the Environmental Protection Agency and the departments of Interior and Transportation.\n\nNone have commented on the lawsuit, except for the Department of Energy, which said it was complying with the court orders. However, the department didn't say whether it had released funding that Shapiro's administration accused it of holding up.",

A lot of people are working and fighting for you. A lot is still up in the air,\" Houlahan said.\n\nOn Monday night, Musk renewed his threat that he would fire any federal workers who do not respond to an email asking them to list five things they accomplished last week.\n\nSeveral government agencies, including the FBI and State Department, have told their employees not to respond to the email.\n\nMusk wrote that \"failure to respond a second time will result in termination.\"\n\n\"I thought it was great because we have people who don't show up for work, and no one knows if they work for the government,\" said President Trump, backing Musk.\n\nOutside Independence Hall on Monday, members of the American Federation of Government Workers held a rally calling the terminations illegal.\n\nDemocratic Congressman Brendan Boyle says the cuts could have a devastating impact - pointing to 400 recent layoffs at the Pennsylvania IRS office.\n\n\"These are not federal jobs, these are Pennsylvania jobs. These are Philadelphia jobs,\" Boyle told the crowd.\n\nIndependence Mall is among the national parks to lose rangers in the layoffs.\n\nMany of the fired workers received a letter accusing them of not meeting performance standards.\n\n\"Many of them had never had a performance review,\" Boyle said.",

(WPVI) -- The search is on for the person who snatched a puppy from a store in Montgomery County, and the whole thing was caught on surveillance camera.\n\nThe video shows the suspect entering the Playful Pets shop in Plymouth Township last Monday and showing an interest in a German Shepherd puppy.\n\nBut investigators say she didn't run off with the dog right away.\n\n\"She meandered around the store for a short period of time, kind of distracted the employee that was working there, and ultimately left the store with the puppy without paying for it,\" said Plymouth Township Det. Sgt. Chris Schwartz.\n\nIn the video you can see the suspect eventually picking up the puppy, valued at $2,800, and go down the stairwell to the front door.\n\n\"She left the front door, puppy in hand, and ran to a red Ford Ranger pickup truck and fled the area,\" said Schwartz.\n\nThe suspect was last seen traveling eastbound on Ridge Pike in Plymouth Township.\n\nThe woman's identity is unknown, but investigators are optimistic that images of her will help them solve this case.\n\n\"We just have the video to go on right now. We are looking for the public's help identifying this person that took the puppy from Playful Pets,\" he says.\n\nAnyone with information about this case is asked to contact Plymouth Township Police.",

        "source": "https://metrophiladelphia.com/",
        "content": "Sign up for our Daily Email newsletter to stay up-to-date on the latest local news throughout Philadelphia.\n\nSibling relationships, spouse relationships and other “extracurricular” bonds are what make up most of the plot of ‘Millers in Marriage.’ The new film from writer-director-actor Ed Burns features a stacked cast (with the likes of Burns, Julianna Margulies, Gretchen Mol, Minnie Driver, Patrick Wilson and more) and an even more stacked storyline of familial and marital dysfunction.\n\nIn the film, Margulies’ Maggie Miller is examining the changing dynamics between her success versus her husband’s (played by Campbell Scott.) Mol’s Eve Miller, on the other hand, is trying to find her voice again in a toxic marriage through a new budding friendship.\n\nTo chat more about their characters and dynamics, both Margulies and Mol sat down with Metro to dive into ‘Millers in Marriage.’\n\nWhy sign on with ‘Millers in Marriage’?\n\nMol: It started with, I’m going to send you a script [that] Ed Burns is directing and wrote— immediately, I was excited. And then there were just all these amazing female roles…it was people just talking and acting. It also felt contemporary and very much something I could relate to as far as the arc that the character takes. So really, it was an easy decision.\n\nMargulies: Very much what Gretchen said, but also, I think it is very rare to get a script for people in their 50s and at this point in their marriages. All three siblings [in the film] are going through a crisis in their marriage, and it was so refreshing to be able to read a script where I couldn’t wait to turn the page and see what happened within the relationships of all of ’em. And not just the marriages, but the siblings in general and the pecking order.\n\nSo much of their childhood reflects back into their present day and how they deal with their marriages. I think for Gretchen’s role, to see a woman sort of get capped at the knees just when she’s hitting her peak to stop to have babies and make that choice—was it her choice? Whereas my character is a writer. I actually, in a strange way, think that my character got the luck of the draw because she could work while she had children. She could write her books while being at home, and she didn’t have to make that choice. And now she’s at a crossroads where her career is more successful than her husband’s, and can her husband handle that?\n\nI was so excited to do a movie that had no green screen, there was no sequel. It’s an adult film for adults and for people who can relate to it, who suddenly are finding themselves without children at home. So I found it really refreshing to be able to dive into it and to see that an actual movie was getting made about something I was interested in.\n\nWhen you were first reading the script and then went on to film, since everyone is so intertwined in it, what were the most fun relationship dynamics for you to explore or see unfold?\n\nMol: I think what I loved actually about the sibling relationship is all of these characters are interconnected by these parents that you never actually meet, but who get a few mentions throughout. So in every interaction, we would get together and we would talk about that and we would sort of figure out which sibling was this and how Juliana was sort of the caretaker and how that might be frustrating to have my character being sort of the messy one a little bit.\n\nSo all of those dynamics were just laid in so beautifully and subtly. They get to this time in their lives and you see them still unable to really have fruitful, lovely relationships. Their relationships are a little bit broken. The movie creeps up on you in a way because these particular people still have a lot of growing to do and learning and exploring and discovery to do. Hopefully, this is sort of the second chance or the beginning of a new chapter where they do understand themselves and the decisions that they made earlier and why they make the choices that they make.\n\nMargulies: I loved playing with Campbell Scott, it was just so delicious. He was so open and every actor on the set, we had such a fun time making this movie together, all of us. And when you work as an actor for Ed Burns who’s written it and is directing it, every day on set is kind of joyful. I mean, I’m really not exaggerating when I say the days were fun. But I wanted to see every relationship, really. I wanted to see Minnie Driver’s relationship with Maggie, or how is Gretchen’s character Eve and Maggie going to take her in?\n\nI think Maggie’s a little bit closed off to human emotion because she’s the eldest and she’s always taking care of everyone. And now it’s her turn. And I understand it. I mean, the other day someone said, are you going to be upset when your kid goes to college? He’s a junior right now in high school. And I said, no, I’ve been taking care of my elderly parents, my kid… maybe I’m just naive and I’ll probably be a crying mess, but I’m really looking forward to what my next chapter is. And I think that’s what this movie’s about.\n\nI saw that Ed himself is very collaborative with his actors on set. Were any moments from the film born out of that collaboration that stand out to you?\n\nMargulies: Oh yes, every day Ed would always get what was written and then he would tell us, we got that, now you go have fun with it. Say whatever you want to say as long as it’s in the context of the scene. For my character, one of the scenes was in the bedroom after the dinner party where she and Nick [Campbell Scott] get in a fight because he doesn’t appreciate what she said at dinner. We improv some of that that stayed in the movie.\n\nAnd then at breakfast when she has given him her book to read and the next morning she comes down the stairs and he says, so seriously, “That’s me, I don’t appreciate what you’re doing.” We got it in the first couple of takes and then Eddie just said, just go. I think Ed was so confident in the material that he wanted to see what it brought out in us. And that comes from having experience as someone who writes and directs and acts in his own movies.\n\nMol: I had that experience too, he is such a great storyteller. I felt like from the first conversation that we had on the phone about Eve, the next time I read the script there were these little changes and little things that we had talked about that made their way into it. You really got to find everything and different possibilities in each scene. And it was a similar thing with Patrick Wilson playing a drunk because I mean, he’s such a talented actor, and how many different ways can you play a drunk?\n\nSometimes he would be hysterical and I’d say, people are going to like you too much if you play it like that. And then he would be so awful sometimes where I would be off camera almost in tears because it felt so abusive really. He really had such a rolodex of drunks and ways to really let him go for it, and it was just fantastic to be in the room and see.\n\nCatch ‘Millers in Marriage‘ in select theaters and on Digital.",

They show the league the type of players they look for every year and have been consistent over the last four drafts in staying true to their board and style.\n\nThis is my first all-Eagles, no trades, 2025 NFL mock draft for Philly Sports Network of the draft SzN.\n\nEagles Mock Draft 1.0\n\nRound One Pick 32- T.J. Sanders, Defensive Tackle, South Carolina\n\nSanders has elite length and eliminates passing lanes with his height and reach. He utilizes a quick burst off the line and is disruptive, causing havoc in the backfield. T.J. provides an interior pass rush (8.5 sacks last 2 seasons), sheds blocks well, is a solid tackler, has gaudy TFL totals (17 in 23/24), and is a toolsy player with high upside. He had a 21.2% pass-rush win rate and an 11.3% run-stop rate in college and is a versatile piece that could be truly explosive in this defensive front.\n\nWhen looking for a true 3-down DT, TJ Sanders checks all the boxes pic.twitter.com/TkfG7pKJvS — Brad (@Graham_SFN) February 11, 2025\n\nRound Two Pick 64- Josaiah Stewart, Edge Rusher, Michigan\n\nStewart has excellent speed, agility, an elite first step, and a plethora of pass-rush moves; swim, chop, etc. He has shown adequate bend getting around the edge, has a high motor to keep pressure on opposing quarterbacks, and has active, violent hands to thwart offensive linemen in his way. He processes offenses quickly. Josaiah can win with outside or inside pass rush moves and has a 16% pressure rate and a 17% run-stop rate tied for best-in-class. The Eagles prefer athletic edge rushers, and while some may think he is small for the position, he could be a perfect fit in Philadelphia.\n\nSep 16, 2024; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA; Philadelphia Eagles defensive end Bryce Huff (0) tackles Atlanta Falcons running back Bijan Robinson (7) after a catch during the second quarter at Lincoln Financial Field.

He exudes body control, is an above-average route runner, creates YAC, breaks tackles, and loves learning. Helm has some of the best hands in class and rarely drops a pass. He is also a film rat who desires to continually improve. He can thrive in the 12 P scheme and always finds a soft spot in coverage. Gunnar uses his body well to shield defenders and excels in space. He is the best run blocker in class!\n\nRound Four Pick 128 Jeffrey Bassa, Linebacker, Oregon\n\nJeffrey was the QB of the defense for Oregon, calling plays for three years. He is an above-average cover LB, using his former skills from being a saftey. Bassa has elite instincts, reads routes with speed, is twitchy, can blitz, and has elite closing speed and footwork. Jeffrey has also been a Gunner on special teams. This year, he was a Senior Bowl show-off! I love fit with the Eagles.\n\nRound Five Pick 162 Hollin Pierce, Offensive Tackle, Rutgers\n\nPierce has the size, height, anchor, and hands the Eagles love to develop. At 6’8 340, he is a roadblock, a mauler, and a vicious finisher. Hollin keeps pockets clean and blows up double teams. He measured the 3rd longest arms and 4th widest wingspan. Pierce is a tough, hard worker and a riser in this draft class at the position! Jeff Stoutland could take Hollin from a relative unknown to All-Pro by the time Lane is ready to hang the cleats up.\n\nFeb 9, 2025; New Orleans, LA, USA; Philadelphia Eagles offensive tackle Jordan Mailata (68) celebrates with Philadelphia Eagles offensive tackle Mekhi Becton (77) after winning Super Bowl LIX at Caesars Superdome.

Williams has shown his elite ball skills with seven interceptions this season at Cal. He is fluid and quick, recognizes routes with ease, and reacts instantly. Nohl also defends the run and tackles well. He is a physical corner too. Williams goes after the ball as if it was thrown to him when it is in the air. He should have a great showing at the combine in Indianapolis and has a chance to improve his stock. He has the talent to be a top-100 player. Adding another ball-hawking, aggressive, athletic, cost-effective corner to coach is desirable with the uncertainty of Slay and others possibly leaving Philly.\n\nRound Five Pick 169- Jalen McLeod, Edge OLB, Auburn\n\nMcLeod has a high motor and a knack for getting to the ball. He frustrates opposing defenses with physicality, think Chauncey Gardner-Johnson. He is versatile and play OLB or put his hand in the dirt as an Edge. Jalen is a menace on the field utilizing his speed, leverage, and eye awareness. He chases down ball carriers as if they stole from him, Playmaker! And why wouldn’t the Eagles want another Jalen on the squad? It has worked out well so far.\n\nBeen a fan of Auburn EDGE/LB Jalen McLeod since his App State days and he's got a great motor and cross chop to win against tackles. Played the \"Buck\" role as a hybrid outside linebacker who drop into coverage.\n\n\n\nAt his best rushing the passer. Had 2 FFs against Alabama. https://t.co/8NYk9rqq6Z pic.twitter.com/h6oCdGBgMt — Devin Jackson (@RealD_Jackson) January 24, 2025\n\nAs always, thank you for reading!\n\nFollow me on X @PHLEagleNews\n\nMandatory Credit: Stephen Lew-Imagn Images",

Nola has been a longtime partner with Team Red, White, & Blue, a nonprofit organization that aims to support former troops who have returned home from service.\n\nThe charity and efforts are near and dear to Aaron’s heart. “Team Red, White & Blue is a remarkable organization, and I’m thrilled to announce this new charity poker tournament to benefit our veteran community,” said Nola. “It is our hope to raise more than $250,000 for this important cause, and I look forward to joining my teammates, partners and fans for a fun evening at the ballpark on May 15.”\n\nAaron Nola and Kyle Schwarber.

Those events had taken place at Brooklyn Bowl in Philadelphia, and Nola’s friends, family, and teammates joined him for a fun evening of bowling.\n\nThis year, Aaron is switching it up. The team is now going to host a charity poker tournament at the CP Rankin club in Citizens Bank Park. On May 15th, fans, veterans, and members of the Phillies organization will have a chance to play and raise money.\n\n“Aaron Nola’s unwavering commitment to supporting veterans in partnership with Team RWB over the last three years sets a gold standard among elite American athletes,” said Mike Erwin, Founder and Executive Director of Team RWB. “This event will not only raise funds for our mission but will also have a lasting impact by showing a future generation of service members that they will be supported by their nation.”\n\n“Yuengling Brewery is proud to support Team RWB in their work to support America’s Veterans. Their programs and ongoing support align with our interest in supporting the U.S. military and the sacrifices they make to keep our country safe,” said Dick Yuengling, Chief Executive Officer and Owner, D.G. Yuengling & Son, Inc. “Aaron Nola puts on an excellent event to raise additional funds from the community and make more people aware of this great cause. We look forward to joining the Phillies, Aaron, and Team RWB this May to combine efforts and support our nation’s heroes.”\n\nFor more information on how you can attend the event and Team RWB, check out their website: https://teamrwb.org/nola.\n\nPhoto Credit: Jonathan Dyer-Imagn Images",

        "content": "Sign up for our email newsletter to stay up-to-date on the latest local sports news throughout Philadelphia.\n\nPhiladelphia Flyers head coach John Tortorella and his wife, Christine Tortorella are incredibly passionate about rescues and animal welfare. The Tortorella’s have “The John and Christine Tortorella Family Foundation,” which features “Bear’s Angels,” is a program that partners with rescues and shelters that help homeless and abused animals. “Enlighten Your World… READ!” also helps with reading and writing skills.\n\nThe Tortorella’s are also passionate about “Hockey & Hounds.” The pair works locally with the Pennsylvania SPCA (PSPCA) and Philadelphia Animal Welfare Society (PAWS) through the Hockey & Hounds program. Each week, Hockey & Hounds features a rescue dog of the week. This week, the pup is an 11-month-old named King! During the Flyers Charities Carnival, the head coach spoke candidly about his love for animals and what inspired him to impact the community.\n\nQ: What got you involved with “Hockey & Hounds?”\n\nJT: “It orginated out in Columbus. Anthony Rothman, who does a radio show out there, we became friends. He does the real stuff, watching out for these dogs. So, as big sports guys, we connected and talked about hockey as long as we talked about animals. That’s the deal we made. Hundreds of dogs were adopted in Columbus in my six years there. Philadelphia is probably the best organization my wife and I have been involved with that understands how badly the causes are needed here to bring awareness.”\n\nQ: For people who can’t adopt (dogs/cats), how else can they get involved in helping the rescues?\n\nJT: “Just to go to the place, to the shelter near you, just to walk a dog. My wife was really into dogs before I met her. She brought to my attention the need. We were in a lockout or strike, so we went to our local shelter and walked dogs all day. There are so many different avenues that people can help with. You don’t want to force people to adopt a dog because it usually returns. If someone honestly doesn’t want a dog or cat, it usually comes back to the shelter.\n\nFlyers head coach John Tortarella meets with the media.\n\nYou can make donations for food. The neatest one is to carve out an hour in a day of your busy week or maybe a few days a week just to let these dogs out to get them out of their cages and let them be dogs. Fostering is a huge part of helping these animals. It allows them to see what home life is and lets them have the personality they have instead of being cooped up in the kennel. It’s not always money. They’re all (rescues) looking for money but just caring. If you care, you’ll find ways to help.”\n\nQ: How many pets do you have?\n\nJT: “We have five rescue dogs and three rescue horses.”\n\nQ: Horses? How did that come about?\n\nJT: “We started in Columbus about nine years ago. We didn’t have a clue what we were doing. With our foundation, we’re all through the country and have different shelters. We ran across this shelter to the south of us from where we lived and became friends with the family. There were a couple of horses that were left for dead in the field. They were starved to death. We had a five-acre farm. They nursed the horses back to where they could stand; they couldn’t even stand. They asked if we could bring them over and let them graze on your grass.”\n\nQ: Were the horses first or the dogs?\n\nJT: “The dogs came first. My wife is passionate about it. It’s her life. She didn’t know what she was getting into. She follows me around with all the jobs I’ve had in hockey, and if it isn’t hockey, it’s rescuing animals. It’s a huge part of our life right now. We loved doing it and met so many great people doing it. It’s so needed. It’s such an emotional rollercoaster when you try to help these animals. You can bring awareness to my platform. The greatest thing about my job is that it’s a platform. It’s not me. It’s just my platform to talk about this. We need help. These animals need help. We’re in all the way and want to help in any way possible.”\n\nAs you can see, John Tortorella is passionate about protecting animals.

        "source": "https://metrophiladelphia.com/",
        "content": "Sign up for our email newsletter to stay up-to-date on the latest local sports news throughout Philadelphia.\n\nPro Football Focus listed a collection of Super Bowl Champion Philadelphia Eagles among the top 101 performances from the 2024-25 NFL season. Eleven Birds were selected, with the six offensive stars barely outpacing the five defenders. Offensive Lineman Jordan Mialata led the way, as he did for Saquon Barkley this season, landing as the third-best player in the NFL according to that publication. If you squint really hard, you can find Super Bowl LIX MVP Jalen Hurts near the end of the text….as the eighth-best NFL QB from the NFL this season.\n\nTwo Top 10 Players in Philadelphia\n\nEven with missing some time due to injury, Mialata still placed in the “bronze medal” position. The massive 6-foot-8 lineman allowed only two sacks this year while having one of the most dominant seasons a lineman has seen since 2006. He was equally effective in pass-blocking and run-blocking, allowing the Australian to earn such high praise from PFF.\n\nDespite being the only 2,500-yard rusher the NFL has ever seen, Saquon Barkley had the tenth-best performance of the season and second-best running back campaign behind Baltimore’s Derrick Henry. His 2,504 total yards smashed Terrell Davis’ combined regular season and postseason rushing mark. Barkley’s elusiveness was a significant factor in the ranking for the running back, described as “the Eagles closer” due to having the most touches, yards, and scores of all NFL running backs in the fourth quarter this season. Has anyone checked if Barkley can toss a baseball? Just checking for some friends in sunny South Florida.\n\nThree More Birds Inside Top 30 NFL Players\n\nFootball – NFL – Super Bowl LIX – Philadelphia Eagles v Kansas City Chiefs – Caesars Superdome, New Orleans, Louisiana, United States – February 9, 2025 Philadelphia Eagles’ Zack Baun celebrates with Josh Sweat after intercepting the ball REUTERS/Mike Segar TPX IMAGES OF THE DAY\n\nBehind Barkley is the publication’s 2024 Breakout Player of the Year, Zach Baun, at Number 11. The free agent signed with Philly on a 1-year “prove it” deal… and well, Baun did that and some, earning his first All-Pro selection with the NFL’s highest-rated linebacker play in 2024. Baun excelled in both facets of the run-and-pass game, leading to a Super Bowl Championship for Philadelphia. Baun’s bet on himself last season should pay out handsomely for the 28-year-old defender this summer.\n\nThe second Eagles lineman lands on the list at #18, thanks to Lane Johnson’s excellence at the tackle position. Johnson had one of the most productive seasons of his career en route to his second Lombardi trophy. Like Mialtata (and Baun), his all-around dominance in the pass-and-run scheme propelled the 34-year-old lineman to the best overall grade of his career. The five-time Pro Bowler allowed only one sack this season, which occurred during the final quarter of the Eagles’ victory over Kansas City in New Orleans.\n\nA.J. Brown marks the first appearance of an Eagles wide receiver in the Top 101. Philly’s pass catcher was the NFL’s best-ranked wideout in 1-0n-1 coverage this season – something that Jalen Hurts utilized brilliantly in the postseason on several occasions. Brown finished with over 1,000 receiving yards for the fifth time in his six-year NFL career. He is signed through 2029 in Philadelphia.\n\nRelated: Eagles WR A.J. Brown supports new OC Kevin Patullo, states changes will need to be made\n\nEagles Rookies Receive Recognition\n\nFootball – NFL – Super Bowl LIX – Philadelphia Eagles v Kansas City Chiefs – Caesars Superdome, New Orleans, Louisiana, United States – February 9, 2025 Philadelphia Eagles’ Cooper DeJean celebrates during the game REUTERS/Mike Segar\n\nCooper DeJean (#45) and Quinyon Mitchell (#78) surprised a bunch of NFL front offices with their seamless transition to the pro level. Everyone in Philadelphia can recall where they were when DeJean returned a Patrick Mahomes pass to the painted turf for a touchdown during Super Bowl LIX. However, Vic Fangio’s defense gained momentum once a healthy DeJean was added to the starting line-up in October. The Eagles lost only one game this season with the rookie in the cornerback slot as he locked down a position that Philadelphia ranked last in at the end of the 2023 season.\n\nSpeaking of locking things down, Eagles’ rookie Quinyon Mitchell (#78) placed sixth among qualifying players in coverage this season… and the second-best rookie behind the guy you just read about, DeJean. The first-round pick out of Toledo erased any doubts anyone had about his ability to perform at the NFL level coming out of a smaller college with a stellar freshman season for Philly. Mitchell was sixth among qualified cornerbacks in coverage this season.\n\nHurts Barely Lands on List at 91\n\nFeb 9, 2025; New Orleans, LA, USA; Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Jalen Hurts (1) warms up before the second half of Super Bowl LIX at Caesars Superdome. Mandatory Credit: Geoff Burke-Imagn Images\n\nThe remaining four Eagles include a QB-protector, a duo of threats to the opposing quarterback, and the Super Bowl MVP-QB himself. Landon Dickerson (#64), Jalen Carter (#77), Milton Williams (#90), and Jalen Hurts (#91) round out the impressive total of Philadelphia football players inside the Top 101.\n\nOn the defensive side of the ball, there was no sophomore slump for Carter as he continued to reward the Eagles selection. The interior defender was rated as the fourth-best pass rusher in their metrics, with a 13% win rate when attacking the opposing QB during the 2024 season. Teammate Milton Williams cranked it up in the postseason as PFF’s best-graded pass rusher en route to becoming a household name with a strip sack of Mahomes in the fourth quarter of the Super Bowl win.\n\nHurts might not have been on the list without a strong offseason performance. The publication claimed the late entry for Hurts (and Milton Williams) was “due to exceptional performances in the postseason.” Three turnovers in three months since the Eagles’ October bye week only go so far in this economy, folks. No matter, as Nike said, “Love Hurts,” and Philly’s star QB will continue to try to prove the doubters wrong.\n\nMandatory Credit: Bill Streicher-Imagn Images",

        "source": "https://metrophiladelphia.com/",
        "content": "Sign up for our Gay City News email newsletter to get news, updates, and local insights delivered straight to your inbox!\n\nEric McGinty’s “Stockade,” made in 2023, has only screened at two film festivals prior to its arrival on VOD. Given the amount of gatekeeping that goes on behind the scenes, that’s not necessarily a sign of its lack of quality. In this case, it turns out to be one. “Stockade” displays technical incompetence in acting, writing, and editing, stretching out a story that might fill a 20-minute short to a painfully elongated 88 minutes. If it were a student film, that’d be one thing, but as a work sent out into the world by a director with another feature and two shorts under his belt, it’s an embarrassment.\n\nAhlam (out actor Sarah Bitar) is lying in bed when she receives a call from her mother in Lebanon. The artist is now trying to make a go of life in Brooklyn, but she has difficulty earning a living. She works as a babysitter to an Arab-American child, whose mother insists Ahlam speak to her in Arabic. Paul (cinematographer Guy de Lancey), who has been injured in a recent accident and now needs a cane, offers her a well-paying job. Since he can’t leave his apartment, he asks her to travel upstate to a house in Kingston with a package. For all the errand’s mystery, he assures her she’s not being used as a drug mule. When she arrives at the house, she opens the package and finds artwork from Iraq. Richard (McGinty) arrives to collect it, promising he’ll return the next day. He does not show up. Instead, a couple confront Ahlam. The man gives her a bottle of water laced with drugs, and once she passes out, the two kidnap her.\n\nMany of the basic elements of filmmaking grammar become far more visible in their absence. “Stockade” is not an experimental film. It would love to be a thriller, but its editing and writing generate no tension. In fact, its cuts are subtly jarring, making for a grating experience. Why does it take its eye away from two women’s conversation to insert a brief shot of a pool of carp? Why does a shot-reverse shot sequence going back and forth between people in the room look as though the lighting and cinematography are far different for each person? Why didn’t McGinty recognize that the color grading needed to be done carefully, so that these shots match each other? Full of unintended awkwardness, most dialogue scenes exist solely to drop a piece of information, supposedly pushing the narrative forward. The script may as well be the product of an AI who has never actually heard two people engaged in small talk.\n\nBitar’s performance leaves her character’s emotions barely visible. After being drugged, kidnapped, escaping and returning home to Brooklyn, Ahlam shows few signs of these events’ long-term impact. In real life, she would probably be more tense meeting a stranger alone in her studio afterwards. “Stockade” never establishes the time frame of these events. Do weeks or months go by between her escape and her return to a painter’s life back in Brooklyn?\n\nFor a film based around the struggle to stay our of poverty and retain a visa to stay in the US, it can’t create an aura of danger. (Mc Ginty describes it as an “immigrant film noir,” stating his desire to center “characters and situations that are under-represented in most mainstream films.”) Even the kidnappers are as polite and unthreatening as they could possibly be. While the precariousness of an immigrant’s life is part of the story, it never feels truly inhabited. Nor is there the slightest anger behind the references to America’s wars in the Middle East and the history of looting antiquities for Western museums. It’s all just a story, badly told.\n\n“Stockade” | Directed by Eric McGinty | In English and Arabic and French with English subtitles | Freestyle Digital Media | Available on VOD Feb. 25th",

        "content": "Sign up for our email newsletter to stay up-to-date on the latest local sports news throughout Philadelphia.\n\nA new era of Philadelphia Union soccer is here, and life under Bradley Carnell is off to a positive start. Despite conceding an early goal on the road, a big second-half performance pushes Union to a 4-2 win and 3 points on the opening weekend of the 2025 MLS season.\n\nImage Credit: Philadelphia Union\n\nStarting XI\n\nCarnell’s first starting lineup as the Head Coach of the Philadelphia Union had a few wrinkles, other than moving from the 4-4-2 Diamond that was favored under Jim Curtin to a 4-2-2-2.\n\nAndre Blake was back between the posts for his 300th career appearance for the Philadelphia Union on Saturday night after missing much of the 2024 season. In front of him, a makeshift backline made up of 2 first-team debutants, Frankie Westfield and Olwethu Makhanya, partnered by two veterans in Jakob Glesnes and Kai Wagner.\n\nJovan Lukić, another debutant who made some positive first impressions after a rocky start, took a spot in the double pivot next to Danley Jean-Jacques, who kicks off his first full season with the Union in 2025. Much more familiar to the fans of the Blue and Gold, Daniel Gazdag and Quinn Sullivan took position as the two attacking midfielders, with Tai Baribo and Mikael Uhre putting the pressure up top.\n\n“I’m not sure too many teams come to Orlando and feel comfortable and confident, especially with a new group, a new coach coming into town…and then you have some new guys on the field. We have [Danley] Jean-Jacques, we have [Jovan] Lukić – who did a great job, the double 6’s there, they did a really great job – and then you have Frankie, Olwethu, so I mean yeah, to come to this place and respond against a bit of adversity, to show the courage and the character and resilience that we’ve been building up over 5 weeks now, I’m really proud of the boys” – Philadelphia Union Head Coach, Bradley Carnell\n\nImage Credit: Philadelphia Union\n\nAn Early Orlando Lead\n\nJust 8 minutes in and on his league debut, Marco Pašalić opened his MLS account after Orlando City seamlessly connected a number of passes around Union debutants Jovan Lukić and Olwethu Makhanya and moseyed their way into the penalty area, kicking off the Bradley Carnell era on a bad foot.\n\nImage Credit: Philadelphia Union\n\nBaribo Brings Union Level\n\nAfter pressure from Quinn Sullivan forced Orlando into a turnover inside their own half in the 23rd minute, Union worked their way into the final 3rd and created some chaos around the penalty area. A mis-hit by Quinn Sullivan sent the ball out to Pedro Gallese’s right and into the path of Kai Wagner, who sent a low, fizzing cross through the 6-yard box where Tai Baribo was waiting to tap the ball in and level the game at 1.\n\nThe first goal of the Bradley Carnell era came from the exact type of soccer we’ve been told we’re going to see this season. High, relentless pressure when the other team is in possession, and then quick and direct passes that lead to goals in transition once turning the other team over. Despite going down early, Carnell stuck to his game plan, and the team was rewarded once they found their footing.\n\nImage Credit: Philadelphia Union\n\nGazdag Gives Union the Lead\n\nNow on level terms and with a pep-talk from the new manager at the break, Union came out of the second half absolutely flying. In the 48th minute, with the ball along the left sideline, Quinn Sullivan lofted a picturesque pass that curled to the far post and fell perfectly into the path of an outstretched Daniel Gazdag’s right foot.\n\nGazdag, getting the perfect touch on the ball from Sullivan, neatly re-directed the ball passed Gallese’s near-post and into the back of the net, giving Union their first lead of the Bradley Carnell era. Quinn Sullivan, who played a big role in creating the first goal, gets credited with an assist on the goal by Gazdag.

Just 3 minutes after Gazdag’s goal, Orlando City’s Rodrigo Schlegel mishandled a back-pass that sat perfectly for a pressing Mikael Uhre.\n\nUhre stepped onto the ball and hit it with his first touch at the top of the penalty arch, beating Gallese and jumping Union out to a 3-1 lead early in the 2nd half.\n\nImage Credit: Philadelphia Union\n\nBaribo Brace Seals First Win of Bradley Carnell Era\n\nIn the 64th minute and with a 3-1 lead, 19-year-old Frankie Westfield received the ball along the right side of the pitch and darted forward with conviction. After collecting a failed first attempt at a cross into the box, Westfield, with his right foot, sent a second ball through the penalty area, which was put in the back of the net by the first-touch of Tai Baribo, his 2nd goal of the game, and his 18th goal in his previous 23 games across all competitions for Union.\n\nThe assist was the first of Westfield’s MLS career and comes as the “cherry on top” of his MLS debut. Still just 19 and able to play either outside back position, Frankie Westfield looks set to log some minutes behind Kai Wagner and Nate Harriel this season and should now bring some extra confidence to the pitch whenever he’s called upon next.\n\nImage Credit: Philadelphia Union\n\nPašalić Puts In Consolation Goal\n\nIn the 79th minute and down 4-1, Orlando City’s Marco Pašalić notched his 2nd goal of the night and his MLS career after a couple of shot attempts rang the post and Union failed to clear the area. The goal didn’t mean anything for the result at the end of the day, but veteran Keeper Andre Blake surely wasn’t happy with young defender Olwethu Makhanya’s positioning and spectatorship on the play and gave him a bit of an earful, which I’m sure is a bit easier for Makhanya to swallow after a 4-2 win.\n\nImage Credit: Philadelphia Union\n\nQuotes from Carnell\n\nAfter the opening goal from Orlando inside the first 10 minutes, a lot of Union fans were probably having that “here we go again” feeling. But Bradley Carnell’s team stuck to the game plan, got themselves level, made a few tweaks at half-time, and absolutely shell-shocked Orlando in the final 45 minutes of the game.\n\n“For them to come out and be challenged here in this game was kind of a microcosm of the whole pre-season. We go a goal down, and then we’re chasing a little bit, we lose our structure, and then coming out of the 2nd half after correcting one or two things and then all of a sudden you can change the picture in a million ways and we did do that in transition, we really did exactly what we wanted to do from the beginning of the game.” – Philadelphia Union Head Coach, Bradley Carnell\n\nLet’s be honest here. I’m not sure anyone, maybe even Bradley Carnell, could have predicted a 4-1 win on the road in the opening game of the season. It’s a great start to a new era of Union soccer, and while Carnell knows they need to continue growing and getting better, he’s seeing lots of things to like about his team, and he’s happy to see them rewarded on Saturday night.\n\n“We left that Montreal [pre-season] game last week feeling very confident and very happy the way the pre-season ended. So I’m excited they could put it on display tonight, but I’m more just happy for the group. I’ve asked a lot of them, they’ve committed to me, we’ve had some great energy, we’ve done a lot of things off the field and reestablished some foundational standings within our group now, and I think you could see that togetherness today.” – Bradley Carnell\n\nImage Credit: Philadelphia Union\n\nMatch Highlights\n\nBe sure to return to Philly Sports Network for more Philadelphia Union and other soccer content!\n\nFollow our Union team on Twitter:\n\nTim Lovenguth | Jimmy King | Paul Frenzel\n\nNate Tennesen | Eric Frysinger\n\nSteve Beavon | Liam Jenkins\n\nDoop on Union fans!\n\nFeatured Image Credit: Philadelphia Union",

Matchday 1 saw 46 goals scored throughout Saturday and Sunday, kicking off an electric start to MLS’ 30th season. The 46 goals scored over the weekend were the most ever in MLS history in the opening week.\n\nAlong with a record-breaking goals record, a new club made its debut. San Diego FC, the 30th MLS club, beat defending champions LA Galaxy 2-0 in their debut.\n\nImage Credit: Apple\n\nHere are some of the top highlights from a thrilling opening week in MLS\n\nUnion take down Orlando City in Bradley Carnell’s debut\n\nThe Philadelphia Union rolled into Inter&Co Stadium to face Orlando City and left with three points in the bag. New Union manager Bradley Carnell’s debut was worthwhile as the Union took down Orlando, 4-2.\n\nTai Baribo scored the Union’s first goal in the 23′ and added a brace in the 64′. Daniel Gazdag scored in the 48′ and Mikael Uhre in the 51′.\n\nFour players also made their MLS debuts for the Union. Frankie Westfield, Olwethu Makhanya, Ian Glavinovich, and Jovan Lukic made their opening appearances for The Boys in Blue. Westfield, a homegrown product, tallied an assist on Baribo’s second goal of the game.\n\nThe Union made a few mistakes, most notably on defense, but Carnell’s high-pressing system took advantage of Orlando.\n\nSan Diego stuns LA Galaxy in club debut\n\nIn the club’s MLS debut, San Diego FC defeated the reigning MLS Cup Champions LA Galaxy on their home turf.\n\nAnders Dreyer scored a brace (52′, 90+3′) to give San Diego its first three points. San Diego became the third MLS expansion team since 2017 to win its opening match. San Diego’s supporter section was rocking in LA, showing the excitement and passion the fans have for their new club.\n\nMiami scores in the 90+10′ to draw against NYCFC\n\nThe 2024 Supporters’ Shield winners Inter Miami picked up one point in a 2-2 draw against NYCFC. Miami picked up an early lead in the first half until NYCFC scored two consecutive goals.\n\nTomas Aviles, who scored for Miami in the 5′, was given a red card in the 23′. Miami would be down to just 10 men for the remainder of the game. In the 10 minutes of added stoppage time in the second half, Telasco Segovia equalized the game for Miami so they could walk away with one point. Lionel Messi threaded a through ball to Segovia, who added the tying goal in his MLS debut. Messi assisted on both of Miami’s goals in the draw.\n\nSan Jose blanks Salt Lake City, 4-0\n\nLast season, the San Jose Earthquakes finished with the least amount of points in the whole league with 21. After some offseason changes, they came out of the gates firing against Salt Lake City en route to a 4-0 win.\n\nJamar Ricketts, Rodrigues, Ousseni Bouda, and Vitor Costa added goals in San Jose’s win. San Jose head coach Bruce Arena joined Bob Bradley as the only coaches in league history to win a game with at least five different MLS clubs.\n\nAfter the addition of Arenas and other offseason moves, better days are ahead for San Jose.\n\nLathe propels Atlanta United over CF Montréal\n\nEmmanuel Latte Lath arrived at Atlanta United from EFL Championship side Middlesbrough FC earlier this month on an MLS record $22 million transfer fee. In his MLS debut, he added a brace (42′, 63′) for Atlanta in a 3-2 win. 65,520 fans also attended the match at Mercedes-Benz Stadium on Saturday, making it the third-highest-attended match globally.\n\nEdwin Mosquera broke the 2-2 tie in the 85′ to give Atlanta three points. Miguel Almiron, who rejoined Atlanta this offseason from Newcastle United, assisted on Mosquera’s winning goal.\n\nMLS Standings: Matchday 1\n\nMLS Eastern Conference Standings\n\nColumbus Crew – 3 pts\n\nPhiladelphia Union – 3 pts\n\nAtlanta United – 3 pts\n\nFC Cincinnati – 3 pts\n\nCharlotte FC – 1 pt\n\nD.C.

The Sixers are coming off a buzzer-beater loss to the Brooklyn Nets on Saturday night, while the Bulls were beaten by the Suns on the same day. The Sixers are in the midst of a seven-game losing streak, while the Bulls are riding a six-game losing streak of their own.\n\nSixers game information\n\nWho: Chicago Bulls (22-35) at Philadelphia 76ers (20-36)\n\nWhen: 7 p.m. EST\n\nWhere: Wells Fargo Center, Philadelphia, PA\n\nWatch: NBC Sports Network, NBA League Pass\n\nLatest on the Sixers\n\nThe Sixers are playing in the midst of a dilemma or several dilemmas. On the one hand, they trailed the Bulls by just a game and a half for 10th place in the conference and a spot in the tournament. Win, and they’re one step closer to the postseason. But, if the Sixers continue to lose, they’re currently holding the sixth-worst record in the league, and if the balls bounce right, they’d be able to hold on to the protected pick that they sent the Thunder as part of the Al Horford trade a few years back.\n\nThen you have the other issues. In addition to Jared McCain, the potential rookie of the year, being lost for the season a few months back, the Sixers have been hit with injuries to every player on the roster at some point this season.\n\nFor Philadelphia, the biggest issue is Joel Embiid‘s knee, which reportedly swollen after the Nets game. Embiid will miss the game tonight and potentially move forward more as the Sixers, and he is considering consulting with various doctors.\n\nPHILADELPHIA, PENNSYLVANIA – FEBRUARY 11: Joel Embiid #21 of the Philadelphia 76ers looks down against the Toronto Raptors in the second half at the Wells Fargo Center on February 11, 2025 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

(Photo by Mitchell Leff/Getty Images)\n\nPaul George, the team’s big free agent signing, is getting regular injections in his injured hand just to be able to suit up. The team will also miss Kyle Lowry, Eric Gordon, and rookie Justin Edwards for the game.\n\nIn addition to the injuries the team has faced, the shooting from the field has been abysmal, and three-point attempts have been even worse. The rotations have been questionable, and the team has, save for a few players, looked disinterested in being on the court. The Sixers face a lot of questions with 26 games left to play in the regular season, and this time of year isn’t the best for facing that many issues.\n\nLatest on the Bulls\n\nThe Bulls started the month of February in 10th place in the Eastern Conference. They have gone 1-7 during the month and are currently in, wait for it, 10th place. That should tell you all you need to know about the East this season, but the Bulls, after trading away Zach LaVine at the deadline, have looked just like you’d expect them to look.\n\nAfter the trade of LaVine, the team’s top two players are Nikola Vucevic and Coby White, who just happen to be listed as questionable for the game against the Sixers. With forward Patrick Williams already out with a knee injury and Jalen Smith out with a concussion, the Bulls seem to be in the same position as the Sixers.\n\nFeb 22, 2025; Chicago, Illinois, USA; Chicago Bulls forward Matas Buzelis (14) goes up for a dunk against the Phoenix Suns during the first half at United Center. Mandatory Credit: David Banks-Imagn Images\n\nWhile Josh Giddy has played very well this season, if the team is missing Vucevic and White, then they’ll be down to Giddy and Lonzo Ball to carry the weight against the Sixers. At this point in the season, it’s anyone guess as to what will happen. The team could be looking at Ball, Kevin Huerter, Matas Buzelis, Giddey and Julian Phillips starting tonight and that doesn’t put them in a very good position to win.\n\nWhat to watch for tonight\n\nUnfortunately, tonight, the Sixers will likely be chucking up three-pointers as if they’re in a contest and not hitting many, as has been their offensive system throughout the season. These days, anything over 28% on their long-distance attempts is counted as a good shooting night for the team.\n\nFeb 11, 2025; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA; Philadelphia 76ers guard Quentin Grimes (5) shoots the ball against Toronto Raptors forward Chris Boucher (25) in the second quarter at Wells Fargo Center. Mandatory Credit: Kyle Ross-Imagn Images\n\nWhat they will have is Tyrese Maxey, Paul George, Kelly Oubre Jr., Guerschon Yabusele, Quentin Grimes, and Ricky Council IV to lean on, which should be enough to take down the Bulls. The team can get out and run, generating better shots and hopefully a good shooting game. With the Bulls being shorthanded as well, tonight would be a good night for Maxey, Oubre Jr., and George to all get a few steals each and play a better defensive game than we’ve seen over the past two games.\n\nOnly time will tell which team wants it more. The “it” is the higher draft pick or 10th seed in the playoffs. Which one each team is striving for remains to be seen.\n\nPrediction\n\nSixers 114 – Bulls 103",

Mandatory Credit: Kyle Ross-Imagn Images\n\nIt’s been a running thought by fans and even national media members that Embiid should simply have the surgery and prepare for next season ever since first mentioned the idea. The only problem is that this supposed surgery may not even exist.\n\nThere are many types of knee injuries, multiple that involve the meniscus as well. Simply put, it all depends on what is actually wrong with his knee. Is it a matter of debris or another tear? Neither of those possibilities has been reported or even hinted at. Is it a matter of Embiid having virtually or literally no more cartilage in his knee? Considering his injury history, this seems far more likely. However, there is no clear surgical option in this case.\n\nNov 20, 2024; Memphis, Tennessee, USA; Philadelphia 76ers center Joel Embiid (21) limps to the bench during a time out during the second half against the Memphis Grizzlies at FedExForum. Mandatory Credit: Petre Thomas-Imagn Images\n\nMicrofracture surgery has proven time and time again to hurt more than it’s helped for NBA players. Without a tear, there is no ability to perform a meniscus repair surgery, nor is there a point to another meniscectomy in that case.\n\nOne frequently suggested surgery is known by some as the Lonzo Ball surgery; to many more, it’s known as a meniscal allograft transplantation or meniscus transplant. While the early results are somewhat positive for Ball, the difference between Ball and Embiin in both age and body size provides significantly different — less positive — optics for recovery.\n\nWhatever the Sixers and Embiid jointly decide, they will need to put a lot of man-hours into their research. With 26 games left this season and the Sixers currently being 16 games below .500, this is as clear a sign as any to waive the white flag on Joel Embiid’s season, barring some miracle cure.\n\nFor the latest breaking news on your Philadelphia 76ers and other Philly sports, follow Zach Ciavolella on X — @CiavoNBA and Bluesky — @ciavo.bsky.social",

        "content": "Feb 22, 2025; Lakeland, Florida, USA; Philadelphia Phillies third base Alec Bohm (28) rounds second base during the third inning against the Detroit Tigers at Publix Field at Joker Marchant Stadium. Mandatory Credit: Mike Watters-Imagn Images\n\nSign up for our email newsletter to stay up-to-date on the latest local sports news throughout Philadelphia.\n\nSpring Training Baseball is upon us as the Philadelphia Phillies have completed the first two games of their 2025 Spring Training slate. The Phillies dropped both contests to the Detroit Tigers and the Baltimore Orioles by respective scores of 7-6 and 6-1.\n\nFour Phillies slugged home runs over the first two games while several big leaguers began to get their reps in as well.\n\nHow the Games Progressed\n\nThe first bit of Spring Training action came a short drive away in Lakeland, Fla., against the Tigers. After a scoreless first two frames, Cal Stevenson notched the first base hit of the Spring for the Phillies, a double into left field. The first baserunner then became the first run scored as Johan Rojas fought off a slider inside to bring in Stevenson. Following a walk from Bryson Stott and an Alec Bohm single, Max Kepler batted in two of his new teammates on a single of his own to give the Phillies a 3-0 lead.\n\nKepler worked a walk in his next plate appearance, putting a runner on base for Buddy Kennedy as he slugged the Phillies’ first home run of the spring. Weston Wilson had earned the honor both of the previous two springs but was recently shut down for six weeks due to a strained oblique.\n\nThe Phillies notched one more run on the day, a solo home run from Josh Breaux, a catcher who the Phillies picked up last year after he was released by the New York Yankees.\n\nThe Phillies did drop the game 7-6, but none of the pitchers who appeared in the contest project to make the Phillies’ Opening Day roster.\n\nFeb 22, 2025; Lakeland, Florida, USA; Philadelphia Phillies catcher Rafael Marchn (13) bats during the second inning against the Detroit Tigers at Publix Field at Joker Marchant Stadium. Mandatory Credit: Mike Watters-Imagn Images\n\nIn Sunday’s home opener against the Orioles, the Phillies found themselves down quickly. Tyler Phillips, who recorded seven starts with the Phillies in 2024, allowed three runs over two innings against the Orioles.\n\nThe Orioles picked up four additional runs over the course of the fourth, fifth, seventh, and ninth innings against pitchers Kyle Tyler, John McMillon, Tristan Barnett, and Cody Stashak.\n\nIn proper Philadelphia style, the long ball was the source of much of the Phillies’ offense. Christian Arroyo slugged a solo shot onto the left field concourse in the bottom of the third.\n\nA few innings later, in the bottom of the seventh, prospect Justin Crawford slipped a single through a defensive shift before Gabriel Rincones Jr. hit a two-run shot over the berm in right center field.\n\nOverall, the Phillies dropped the contest 7-3.\n\nTakeaways from Phillies Early Start\n\nEvery player that steps onto the diamond wants to win on any given day, but Spring Training has no weight to wins and losses whatsoever. The important thing is allowing players to get work in, figure out position battles, and stay healthy throughout the process.\n\nThe most interesting players to follow after the first two games are Buddy Kennedy and Cal Stevenson. Both will battle for what is likely the final roster spot, a backup outfield/utility position. Both players are 1-for-4 thus far with an extra base hit, a run scored, and a walk. Kennedy’s hit went a lot further, but Stevenson has plenty of time to make his case. Following Wilson’s injury, the battle will likely come down to Kennedy, Stevenson, and Kody Clemens, all of whom saw time in the big leagues in 2024. Clemens is 1-for-2 thus far.\n\nAlec Bohm, Johan Rojas, Nick Castellanos, Brandon Marsh, Kyle Schwarber, Bryson Stott, and Edmundo Sosa have all seen action thus far for the Phillies. Phillips is the only familiar face to pitch for the Phillies in the first two contests.\n\nTop prospects Aidan Miller and Justin Crawford made appearances in both games over the weekend. The pair are likely to not make an impact at the Major League level this season, but they have the potential to be cornerstone pieces of the Phillies’ lineup for years to come.\n\nFeb 22, 2025; Lakeland, Florida, USA; Philadelphia Phillies outfielder Cal Stevenson (47) catches a fly ball during the first inning against the Detroit Tigers at Publix Field at Joker Marchant Stadium.

The contest will start at 1:05 P.M. and will be broadcast on NBC Sports Philadelphia+.\n\nCristopher Sanchez is scheduled to start on Monday with Joe Ross slated for the start on Tuesday at the Tampa Bay Rays. Zack Wheeler and Jesus Luzardo are also slated to make their Spring Training debuts later this week for the Phillies.",

Animal welfare groups rescued a dozen horses from the property – several of which were injured – along with a pig and a goat.\n\nSurveillance video distributed by the PPD on Monday shows a man walking in the area moments before flames emerged from the pop-up stable.\n\nPolice described the suspect as a white man with a thin build who was wearing dark-colored pants, a gray long sleeve shirt and a black hat. Anyone with information is asked to contact the City Wide Arson Task Force at 215-783-1092 or call or text the police tip line, 215-686-TIPS (8477).\n\nThe Pennsylvania SPCA is caring for the horses that survived the fire, while ACCT Philly took custody of the goat and pig.\n\nACCT Philly, the city’s animal care and control provider, said in a Facebook post last week that it “appears the stable was operating as a business and people were boarding their horses at the property.”\n\nThe organization said citations were issued Feb. 16 following a visit to the site, and that ACCT Philly was working with the city to address the situation. Philadelphia residents are permitted to own horses but are supposed to go through a licensing process.",

The gang’s motto: “If you want to join the Senders, get a body, then you gang with us,” according to Assistant DA Adam Faraye. ‘Getting a body’ refers to the act of killing someone.\n\n“The Senders are not quite gone, but they’re close,” DA Larry Krasner said at Friday’s news conference. “They’re very close.”\n\nMost of the violence occurred between 5th and 9th streets from Snyder to Oregon avenues; however, incidents connected to the Senders, and their feuds with other groups, were reported as far away as Lawncrest and Germantown.\n\nTaahir Rowe, 20, is facing murder charges for the January 2022 ambush shooting of 16-year-old Mehki Ingram on the 800 block of June Street in West Philadelphia’s Mill Creek neighborhood. Ingram died after several days in the hospital.\n\nOne of the other suspects, 19-year-old Eli Simmons, is being accused of participating in 10 shootings that left 16 people injured over the span of about 16 months in 2022 and 2023. Faraye said Simmons was being detained on $12.5 million bail.\n\nProsecutors said that, as part of the gang feud, three gunmen opened fire in February 2023 on a group of teenagers gathered on the 3100 block of Norris Street in Strawberry Mansion. The gunfire struck a mother and her 2-year-old daughter as they crossed the street, and five teens were injured.\n\nOther outbursts involving the Senders included three separate South Philadelphia triple shootings in January 2022 on the 700 block of Ritner Street; in April 2023 at 22nd and Wolf streets; and in May 2023 on the 600 block of Oregon Avenue, authorities said.\n\nElante Outerbridge, 17, is charged with nine counts of attempted murder in relation to the seven-victim incident and a shooting several months earlier in Southwest Philadelphia, according to the DA’s Office.\n\nHe is among the youngest defendants included in the bust, having been just 15 years old at the time of the two shootings. Most of the suspects were under 18 at the height of the gang warfare.\n\n“A lot of these young kids think it’s a game,” said PPD Detective Kelley Gallagher, who worked on the case. “On social media, they compare it to a basketball game. And how that works is, for every shooting victim, they say they have a point.”",

Attorneys for federal workers say in a lawsuit that Musk violated the law with his demand that employees explain their accomplishments or risk being fired.\n\nThe backstory:\n\nElon Musk tweeted during the weekend that all federal employees will be asked to report \"what they got done last week,\" and that failure to reply would be considered a resignation.\n\nRELATED: Elon Musk email to federal employees targeted in lawsuit\n\nMoments later, federal workers received a three-line email telling them to share \"approx. 5 bullets of what you accomplished last week and cc your manager.\"\n\nTrump administration offers buyouts to federal workers\n\nDig deeper:\n\nPresident Donald Trump’s administration is offering buyouts to federal employees to quickly reduce the government workforce through the deferred resignation program.\n\nThe buyouts are for all full-time federal employees except for military personnel, employees of the U.S. Postal Service and those in positions related to immigration enforcement and national security. Workers will receive roughly eight months of salary if they accept the offer, the Associated Press reported.\n\nRELATED: Federal worker buyout deadline: What we know about the deferred resignation program\n\nThis buyout is led by Elon Musk, one of President Donald Trump’s advisers, who has organized a financial incentive for workers to leave their government jobs by offering several months of pay in exchange for their resignation, the Associated Press reported.\n\nHow many government workers are there?\n\nBy the numbers:\n\nThe federal government employs over 3 million people, accounting for 1.9% of the nation’s entire civilian workforce, the Associated Press reported, citing the Pew Research Center. The civilian workforce is about 2.4 million, not including the U.S. Postal Service employees and active-duty military.\n\nAlmost 20% of federal workers are in Washington, D.C., Maryland, and Virginia. California has 147,500 federal employees, but it's less than 1% of total nonfarming employees in the state, the AP noted. Texas has 130,000 federal workers, but that accounts for less than 1% of nonfarming jobs there and Florida has 94,000.",

        "content": "The Brief Shapiro said that $2 billion identified as either frozen or held up by an unspecified review was now accessible to state agencies. The Pennsylvania governor sued in federal court on February 13. Trump administration lawyers have argued that the government’s move to freeze funds was legal.\n\n\n\nPennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro said Monday that President Donald Trump ’s administration has freed up billions in federal aid that the Democrat had accused it of withholding illegally and unconstitutionally.\n\nWhat we know:\n\nShapiro said in a news conference that more than $2 billion that his administration had identified as either frozen or held up by an unspecified review was now accessible to state agencies.\n\nShapiro sued in federal court over the aid on Feb. 13, after federal courts had repeatedly rejected the Trump administration’s sweeping pause on federal funding and questioned whether the Trump administration was ignoring court orders.\n\nShapiro also said he pressed his case in conversations with senior Trump administration officials while he was in Washington, D.C., over the weekend. The U.S. attorney's office in Philadelphia, which represents the federal agencies named in the lawsuit, declined comment Monday.\n\nDig deeper:\n\nIn federal court in Rhode Island, Trump administration lawyers, however, have argued that the government's move to freeze funds was legal and asked a judge to reject a request by nearly two dozen Democratic states for a preliminary injunction.\n\nAdministration lawyers characterized the freeze as simply a \"pause\" to consider how best to use federal funds. They contended the case was moot since the Office of Management and Budget had rescinded its memo in late January freezing federal grants and loans.\n\nMuch of the stalled grant funding identified by Shapiro's administration was passed by Congress in signature laws signed by former President Joe Biden, including his landmark 2022 climate law, the Inflation Reduction Act, and his 2021 infrastructure law.\n\nThe lawsuit had said aid was being withheld from programs that distribute money to upgrade energy efficiency in homes, plug abandoned gas wells, clean up abandoned mine land, improve municipal water and sewer systems and reimburse industry for cutting their planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nFive federal agencies were named as defendants: the White House Office of Management and Budget, the Environmental Protection Agency and the departments of Interior and Transportation.\n\nNone have commented on the lawsuit, except for the Department of Energy, which said it was complying with the court orders. However, the department didn’t say whether it had released funding that Shapiro’s administration accused it of holding up.",

        "source": "https://www.fox29.com/",
        "content": "article\n\nThe Brief The Trump administration is eliminating at least 1,600 USAID positions and placing most remaining staff on leave. A federal judge ruled in favor of the administration’s plan, rejecting employee lawsuits to block the cuts. Workers abroad will keep access to agency systems and emergency communication tools, but many are stranded without clear guidance. A separate judge has temporarily stopped the administration from withholding foreign aid, ordering some funding to be restored.\n\n\n\nThe Trump administration moved its fast-paced dismantling of the U.S. Agency for International Development toward what appeared to be its final phases, telling all but a fraction of staffers worldwide that they were on leave as of Monday and notifying at least 1,600 of the U.S.-based staffers they were being fired.\n\nThe move was the latest and one of the biggest steps in what President Donald Trump and cost-cutting ally Elon Musk say is their goal of gutting the six-decade-old aid and development agency in a broader campaign to slash the size of the federal government.\n\nMore federal layoffs\n\nThe backstory:\n\nIt comes after a federal judge on Friday allowed the administration to move forward with pulling thousands of USAID staffers off the job in the United States and around the world. U.S. District Judge Carl Nichols rejected pleas that came in a lawsuit from employees to keep temporarily blocking the government’s plan.\n\n\"As of 11:59 p.m. EST on Sunday, February 23, 2025, all USAID direct hire personnel, with the exception of designated personnel responsible for mission-critical functions, core leadership and/or specially designated programs, will be placed on administrative leave globally,\" according to the notices sent to USAID workers and viewed by The Associated Press.\n\nCiting a big concern for workers stationed overseas who have reported being cut off from government communications, the notices say that \"USAID is committed to keeping its overseas personnel safe. Until they return home, personnel will retain access to Agency systems and to diplomatic and other resources.\"\n\nRelated article\n\nThe administration said employees put on leave overseas are expected to receive \"voluntary Agency-funded return travel\" and other benefits.\n\nNichols, who was nominated by Trump, said he had been \"very concerned\" about workers in high-risk areas left overseas without access to emergency communications. But he said he has since been reassured by the administration that workers would still have access to two-way radios that allow 24–7 communications in emergencies, as well as a phone app with a \"panic button.\"\n\nThe judge said the government’s statements persuaded him \"that the risk posed to USAID employees who are placed on administrative leave while stationed abroad — if there is any — is far more minimal than it initially appeared.\"\n\nBig picture view:\n\nThe notices of firings and leaves come on top of hundreds of USAID contractors receiving no-name form letters of termination over the weekend, according to copies that AP viewed.\n\nThe blanket nature of the notification letters to USAID contractors, excluding the names or positions of those receiving it, could make it difficult for the dismissed workers to get unemployment benefits, workers noted.\n\nA different judge in a second lawsuit tied to the dismantling of USAID has temporarily blocked the freeze on foreign assistance and said this past week that the administration had kept withholding the aid despite his court order and must at least temporarily restore the funding to programs worldwide.\n\nUSAID’s notice Sunday said it was \"committed to keeping its overseas personnel safe\" and pledged not to cut off USAID staffers abroad from agency systems and other support.\n\nWhat is USAID?\n\nDig deeper:\n\nUSAID offers assistance to countries recovering from disasters, trying to escape poverty, and engaging in democratic reforms, including war-torn Gaza and West Africa also recovering from years of vicious wars. The U.S. is by far the world’s largest donor of humanitarian aid, with USAID administering billions of dollars in humanitarian, development and security assistance in more than 100 countries.\n\nPresident John F. Kennedy created the organization at the height of the Cold War to counter Soviet influence. Congress passed the Foreign Assistance Act in 1961, and Kennedy signed that law and an executive order establishing USAID as an independent agency.\n\nThe U.S. spends less than 1% of its budget on foreign assistance, a smaller share overall than some other nations.",

Do the Sixers realize — with or without whatever Embiid and his balky left knee can give them — their season is over?\n\n\"I don't want to believe that,\" nine-time All-Star Paul George said. \"I don't sense that in the locker room and I don't believe that.\"\n\nGeorge has little choice publicly but to stand by the Sixers, even as they lost their eighth straight game and 10th of 11 overall — 142-110 on Monday night to the 23-win Chicago Bulls — and see even the odds of a play-in tournament berth dip to the point where fans are already looking at next season.\n\nNot that it promises anything better than the mess that's unraveled in South Philly this year.\n\n\"I'm not quite sure what fell apart to give up 140 points, at home, against the Chicago Bulls,\" George said.\n\nEmbiid sits again\n\nThe real bad news — you know, before six Bulls scored at least 15 points — came hours ahead of this debacle when the Sixers offered no real update on Embiid. Embiid missed his 38th game of the season for the sagging Sixers, and all options — from rest to potential surgery to playing through pain — remain on the table, depending on the results of continued testing and imaging.\n\nEmbiid has played in just 19 of 57 games for the Sixers, who fell to 20-37 an have only a faint shot at earning a berth in the NBA play-in tournament. Embiid has averaged 23.8 points — he averaged at least 30 and won two scoring titles the last three seasons — and scored only 29 points combined in his last two games.\n\n\"I don’t think anybody envisioned it going like this,\" coach Nick Nurse said. \"It’s disappointing on a lot of levels. He wants to play. We want him to play. Our best version is of with him playing. It hasn’t worked out like that. Yet.\"\n\nThe 76ers are a franchise in turmoil and suffering through an internal tug-of-war when it comes to Embiid. Can he play through the pain and should he, even with the woeful record? Why not just shut him down and try again next year?\n\nEven George — who left the Los Angeles Clippers to sign a four-year, $212 million free-agent contract — conceded the juice might not be worth the squeeze when it comes to a potential Embiid return. The 76ers are one of the worst teams in the league and are trending closer to Toronto, Charlotte, Washington and a lottery pick than making a serious run in the postseason.\n\nMaybe sitting Embiid is for the best — just as it was seemingly was early in the Process.\n\nWhat's next:\n\nThe 76ers’ first-round pick is top-six protected or else it goes to the Oklahoma City Thunder, perhaps one more reason the Sixers could shut down Embiid and cut their losses on the season.\n\n\"We're showing no signs of a team that will compete,\" George said. \"We just don't have the habits of a championship or a playoff-contending team would have. To be honest, right now, it's a little farfetched. All we can do is work hard. Try to just keep going for one another. We've shown no signs of, forget championship, but a playoff contending-team here.\"\n\nDoes Nurse survive and earn a third season on the bench?\n\nWhat about team president Daryl Morey, who built this mishmashed roster full of patchwork free-agents and needlessly gave Embiid a three-year, $193 million contract extension ahead of training camp.\n\nLooking ahead\n\nSo where is the next win on the schedule? Wednesday night against a Knicks team winning at a 65% clip at Madison Square Garden? Against Steph Curry and the Warriors?\n\n\"It’s hard to see a vision, but we have a lot of games left,\" 2024 All-Star guard Tyrese Maxey said.\n\nNot really. Certainly not enough to make anyone who watched a 1-9 February — and has four of 20 wins against Charlotte — believe the season can be saved. The 76ers are only 7-8 this season when Embiid, George and Maxey start together.\n\n\"Everybody needs to look at themselves, at what they can do better, and then look at what they can do better for the team. And do our jobs, man. Be professional,\" Nurse said.",

        "source": "https://www.fox29.com/",
        "content": "The Brief Trump will impose tariffs on Canada and Mexico starting next month, ending a temporary suspension. Economists warn the tariffs could raise consumer prices and hurt economic growth. Canada, Mexico, and other nations may retaliate, potentially leading to a broader trade conflict.\n\n\n\nPresident Donald Trump said Monday that his tariffs on Canada and Mexico are will begin next month. His move ends a monthlong suspension on the planned import taxes that could potentially hurt economic growth and worsen inflation.\n\nWhile Trump was answering a specific question about the taxes to be charged on America's two largest trading partners, the U.S. president also stressed more broadly that his intended \"reciprocal\" tariffs were on schedule to begin as soon as April.\n\nTrump has claimed that other countries charge unfair import taxes that have come at the expense of domestic manufacturing and jobs. His near constant threats of tariffs have already raised concerns among businesses and consumers about an economic slowdown and accelerating inflation. But Trump claims that the import taxes would ultimately generate revenues to reduce the federal budget deficit and new jobs for workers.\n\nWhat they're saying:\n\n\"We’re on time with the tariffs, and it seems like that’s moving along very rapidly,\" the U.S. president said at a White House news conference with French President Emmanuel Macron.\n\n\"The tariffs are going forward on time, on schedule,\" Trump said.\n\nWhat we know:\n\nMost economists say the cost of the taxes could largely be borne by consumers, retailers and manufacturers such as auto companies that source globally and rely on raw materials such as steel and aluminum that Trump is already, separately, tariffing at 25%.\n\nCompanies like Walmart have warned about uncertainty, while the University of Michigan's latest consumer sentiment index plunged by roughly 10% over the past month in part due to fears about tariffs and inflation worsening. In the 2024 presidential election, voters backed Trump on the belief that he could cool inflation that had spiked to a four-decade high in the aftermath of the coronavirus pandemic during President Joe Biden's time in office.\n\nWhat we don't know:\n\nInvestors, businesses and the broader public are still trying to determine whether Trump is merely threatening tariffs as a negotiating tool or if he sincerely backs the tax hikes as a way to offset his planned income tax cuts.\n\nTrump already plans to remove the exemptions on his 2018 steel and aluminum tariffs, taxing imports of both metals at 25%.\n\nDespite talks the Trump administration has held with Canadian and Mexican officials, the U.S. president signaled Monday that he would end the 30-day suspension of tariffs that were initially set to take effect in February. Trump plans to tax imports from Mexico at 25% as well as most goods from Canada, with energy products such as Canadian oil and electricity being tariffed at a lower 10%.\n\nDig deeper:\n\nTrump is placing tariffs on Canadian and Mexican goods with the stated goal of pressuring them to do more to address illegal immigration and the smuggling of illicit drugs such as fentanyl. While relatively little fentanyl comes from Canada, the country announced a czar to address the issue and appease Trump in addition to existing measures. Mexico has relocated members of its National Guard to the border with the United States in addition to existing measures.\n\nTrump also plans to impose new tariffs to match the rates charged by other countries. Set to begin as soon as April, the tariffs could be higher than what other countries would charge as subsidies, regulatory barriers and the value added tax — which is akin to a sales tax common in Europe — would be included in the calculations.\n\nThe possibility of retaliatory tariffs planned by Canada, Mexico and Europe could lead to a broader trade conflict that sabotage growth. In February, the Yale University Budget Lab estimated that the Canadian and Mexican tariffs could depress average U.S. incomes by $1,170 to $1,245 a year.\n\nWhat are tariffs?\n\nThe backstory:\n\nTariffs are a tax on imports . Tariffs are typically charged as a percentage of the price a buyer pays a foreign seller. In the United States, tariffs are collected by Customs and Border Protection agents at 328 ports of entry across the country.\n\nTrump has been threatening tariffs to ensure greater cooperation from countries on stopping illegal immigration and the smuggling of chemicals used for fentanyl. Trump has also pledged to use tariffs to boost domestic manufacturing.\n\nRELATED: Fed declines to lower interest rate, ending 3-cut run\n\nU.S. tariff rates vary: They are generally 2.5% on passenger cars, for instance, and 6% on golf shoes. Tariffs can be lower for countries with which the United States has trade agreements. For example, most goods were able to move between the United States, Mexico and Canada tariff-free because of Trump’s US-Mexico-Canada trade agreement. That will change under new tariffs imposed by Trump.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump gives a thumbs up before boarding Air Force One at Joint Base Andrews in Maryland on January 31, 2025, as he travels to the Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida. (Photo by Jim Watson/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nRELATED: Trump proposes abolishment of federal income tax\n\nTrump’s tariffs are an about-face to the trade agreement he himself negotiated with Canada and Mexico in his first term. The USMCA agreement – which he called \"the fairest, most balanced, and beneficial trade agreement we have ever signed into law,’’ – was supposed to bring predictability to North American trade, giving businesses the confidence to make investments. It hasn’t worked out that way.\n\nNow, experts say the 25% tax is like launching \"a grenade\" into the U.S. auto, oil and other major industries.\n\nWhat items from Canada and Mexico will have tariffs?\n\nWhat we know:\n\nMajor imports from Canada and Mexico include cars and trucks, automobile parts, crude oil, and agricultural products.\n\nDetails of the new order on Saturday revealed Canadian oil will be subject to a 10% tariff, not 25%, as other Canadian goods.\n\nWhat we don't know:\n\nIt's still unclear if there will be other exemptions for some products that could result in swift price increases to U.S. consumers.\n\nIt's also unclear if Trump will follow through with threats to impose tariffs on the European Union. He said Friday that he \"absolutely\" would add tariffs to EU imports, but he didn't elaborate.\n\nBy the numbers:\n\nUnder 25% tariffs, tariffs would surge from $1.3 billion to $132 billion a year on Mexico’s imports to the United States and from $440 million to $107 billion on Canada’s, according to the tax and consulting firm PwC.\n\nRELATED: What to know about Trump's interests in Greenland, Panama Canal\n\nIn 2023, the U.S. bought more than $45 billion in agricultural products from Mexico –including 63% of imported vegetables and 47% of fruits and nuts. Farm imports from Canada came to $40 billion. A 25% tariff could push prices up.\n\nRELATED: Trump's no-tax-on-overtime proposal: What to know\n\nIn 2023, the United States imported $69 billion worth of cars and light trucks from Mexico – more than any other country -- and $37 billion from Canada. Another $78 billion in auto parts came from Mexico and $20 billion from Canada. The engines in Ford F-series pickups and the iconic Mustang sports coupe, for instance, come from Canada.\n\nS&P Global Mobility reckoned that auto \"importers are likely to pass most, if not all, of this (cost) increase to consumers.’’ TD Economics notes that average U.S. car prices could rise by around $3,000 – this at a time when the average new car already goes for $50,000 and the average used car for $26,000, according to Kelley Blue Book.\n\nRELATED: Are we in an energy emergency? What Trump's executive order means\n\nCanada is also by far America’s biggest foreign supplier of crude oil. From January through November last year, Canada shipped the U.S. $90 billion worth of crude, well ahead of No. 2 Mexico at $11 billion.\n\nWhy are tariffs controversial?\n\nTrump has said tariffs will create more factory jobs, shrink the federal deficit, lower food prices and allow the government to subsidize childcare.\n\nTariffs can also be used to pressure other countries on issues that may or may not be related to trade. In 2019, for example, Trump used the threat of tariffs as leverage to persuade Mexico to crack down on waves of Central American migrants crossing Mexican territory on their way to the United States.\n\nTrump even sees tariffs as a way to prevent wars.\n\n\"Tariffs are the greatest thing ever invented,’’ Trump said at a rally in Flint, Michigan, during his presidential campaign.\n\nIn his first term, Trump imposed tariffs with a flourish — targeting imported solar panels, steel, aluminum and pretty much everything from China.\n\n\"Tariff Man,\" he called himself.\n\nThe other side:\n\nTariffs raise costs for companies and consumers that rely on imports. Mainstream economists are generally skeptical of tariffs, considering them a mostly inefficient way for governments to raise money and promote prosperity. They’re also likely to provoke retaliation.\n\nThe European Union, for example, punched back against Trump’s tariffs on steel and aluminum by taxing U.S. products, from bourbon to Harley-Davidson motorcycles. Likewise, China responded to Trump’s trade war by slapping tariffs on American goods, including soybeans and pork in a calculated drive to hurt his supporters in farm country.\n\nA study by economists at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the University of Zurich, Harvard and the World Bank concluded that Trump’s tariffs failed to restore jobs to the American heartland. The tariffs \"neither raised nor lowered U.S. employment’’ where they were supposed to protect jobs, the study found.\n\nDespite Trump’s 2018 taxes on imported steel, for example, the number of jobs at U.S. steel plants barely budged: They remained right around 140,000. By comparison, Walmart alone employs 1.6 million people in the United States.\n\nWorse, the retaliatory taxes imposed by China and other nations on U.S. goods had \"negative employment impacts,’’ especially for farmers, the study found. These retaliatory tariffs were only partly offset by billions in government aid that Trump doled out to farmers. The Trump tariffs also damaged companies that relied on targeted imports.\n\nWho actually pays tariffs?\n\nBig picture view:\n\nTrump insists that they are paid for by foreign countries. In fact, it is importers — American companies — that pay tariffs, and the money goes to the U.S. Treasury. Those companies, in turn, typically pass their higher costs on to their customers in the form of higher prices. That’s why economists say consumers usually end up footing the bill for tariffs.\n\nStill, tariffs can hurt foreign countries by making their products pricier and harder to sell abroad. Foreign companies might have to cut prices — and sacrifice profits — to offset the tariffs and try to maintain their market share in the United States. Yang Zhou, an economist at Shanghai’s Fudan University, concluded in a study that Trump’s tariffs on Chinese goods inflicted more than three times as much damage to the Chinese economy as they did to the U.S. economy.\n\nWhy you should care:\n\nA study this month by Warwick McKibbin and Marcus Noland of the Peterson Institute for International Economics concluded that the 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico and 10% tariffs on China \"would damage all the economies involved, including the U.S.’’\n\n\"For Mexico,’’ the study said, \"a 25% tariff would be catastrophic. Moreover, the economic decline caused by the tariff could increase the incentives for Mexican immigrants to cross the border illegally into the U.S. — directly contradicting another Trump administration priority.’’\n\nFormer trade negotiator Wendy Cutler, now vice president at the Asia Society Policy Institute, said the extent of the economic damage will depend on how long the tariffs are in effect.\n\nIf it’s just a few days, \"that’s one thing. If they are in place for weeks onto months, we’re going to see supply chain disruptions, higher costs for U.S. manufacturers, leading to higher prices for U.S. consumers,’’ she said. \"It could have macroeconomic impacts. It could affect the stock market. Then internationally it could lead to more tension with our trading partners and make it harder for us to work with them.''",

Tickets are on sale now.\n\n\n\nA second iteration of the notorious Fyre Festival is apparently coming soon.\n\nBilly McFarland, the founder of the failed festival who later pleaded guilty to wire fraud charges, recently spoke about plans for a sequel to the musical event.\n\nHere’s what to know:\n\nFyre Festival\n\nThe backstory:\n\nThe failed Fyre Festival held in 2017 in the Bahamas was promoted as \"the cultural experience of the decade,\" an ultra-luxurious event on the Bahamian island of Exuma over two weekends. It was promoted at the time on social media by Kendall Jenner, Bella Hadid, Emily Ratajkowski and other models and celebrities as the event organizers coaxed people into buying ticket packages ranging from $1,200 to over $100,000.\n\nBut customers hoping to see Blink-182 and the hip-hop act Migos arrived to learn the musical acts were canceled. Their luxury accommodations and gourmet food consisted of leaky white tents and cheese sandwiches. Customers lashed out on social media with the hashtag #fyrefraud, and a lawsuit called the festival \"nothing more than a get-rich-quick scam.\" It said the festival’s inadequate food, water, shelter and medical care left attendees stranded on a remote island in a \"dangerous and panicked situation.\"\n\nIn 2018, McFarland was later sentenced to six years in federal prison after pleading guilty to multiple counts of wire fraud in connection to the original festival, with the judge calling him a \"serial fraudster.\" He was released in May 2022 after serving four years.\n\nFILE - Billy McFarland leaves Manhattan Federal Court on July 1, 2017.

However, plans for that festival were scrapped and tickets were refunded, according to the LA Times.\n\nFyre Festival 2 location\n\nWhat we know:\n\nMcFarland on Monday again announced Fyre Festival 2 on social media and described it as a \"three-day escape to the Mexican Caribbean where you’ll explore by day alongside your favorite talent and come together at night to celebrate with music.\"\n\nSpecifically, a press release states that Fyre Festival 2 will be May 30 to June 2 in Isla Mujeres, located about 8 miles off the coast of Cancún.\n\nMcFarland is apparently not handling the logistics this time around. Fyre Festival 2 is being produced by the event production company LostNights, while tickets and hospitality packages will be handled by soldout.com and FriendlySky, according to the press release.\n\nIt also promises \"world-class accommodations,\" as well as \"adventures led by international and local talent, taking guests on boundary-pushing excursions by day and uniting for intimate beach-side performances at night.\"\n\nWhat they're saying:\n\n\"FYRE 2 is real. My dream is finally becoming a reality,\" McFarland told TODAY in an interview that also aired on Monday.\n\n\"FYRE 2 really isn’t about the past, and it’s not really about me. It’s about taking the vision, which is strong,\" McFarland added.\n\nFyre Festival 2 tickets, lineup\n\nTicket Information:\n\nGeneral access tickets are on sale now and start at $1,400, which includes four-day access to Fyre Festival 2 and does not include accommodation.

        "content": "The Brief Ticket prices to watch the Philadelphia 76ers play at the Wells Fargo Center are going for $2. Despite the team's record, many fans showed up to support the team as they faced the Chicago Bulls Monday night.\n\n\n\nYou can see an NBA game for less than you pay to see the local high school team.\n\nSome may say that's because the local high school team is playing better, but true fans support the team no matter what the record is and when its stars are hurt, especially when the cost to park your car or even take the subway is more than an NBA ticket.\n\nWhat we know:\n\nThe Chicago Bulls ended a six-game losing streak after beating the Philadelphia 76ers 142-110 Monday night.\n\nThe Bulls now hold the 10th and final play-in tournament spot in the Eastern Conference. Meanwhile, the Sixers sit in 12th place.\n\n76ers center Joel Embiid did not play in Monday's game due to an injured left knee.\n\nTicket prices for the game reached as low as $2 on various ticket-selling apps.\n\nMany fans still showed up to support the Philly team despite the team's record.\n\nWhat they're saying:\n\n\"What's it like seeing the Sixers for as cheap as three dollars a ticket?\" Keeley asked.\n\n\"I'm here. We're here. Listen, we'll pay more for the drinks than the tickets,\" a fan replied.\n\nEven the kids' soft drinks are more expensive.\n\nFans told us it's $8 for a Coca-Cola, four times the $2 price we saw tickets going for on StubHub for the home game against the Chicago Bulls.\n\nA Chicago fan has a ticket from the Sixers-Bulls game 50 years ago that was $8 back in 1975.\n\nMonday night, it was kind of an unofficial back-to-the-future night to see them play, with 1970s prices of tickets paid by the fans we met going in.\n\n\"They were six dollars,\" said Olivia Koch from West Chester University. \"Can you believe six dollars for a ticket? I know compared to the Eagles and Phillies, it's nuts, crazy.\"\n\n\"When was the last time you paid that much for a Sixers ticket? Keeley asked Matt T. from South Philadelphia. \"Man, I can't... I cannot remember,\" he replied.\n\n\"When was the last time you paid six dollars to see any pro game in any sport?\" Keeley asked Lara Costello, a Sixers fan. \"I don't even remember. Maybe never in my life, I don't think so,\" she said.\n\n\"Is this in your college budget, six dollars?\" Keeley asked Kendall Clemmer, a Sixers fan. \"I think six dollars, I think anybody can go for that,\" Clemmer replied.\n\n\"Are the Bulls better than the Sixers this year?\" Keeley asked Katherine Gaffney, an Arcadia University student from Chicago. \"They're one tank above the 76ers in the conference. So this is two bad teams you're paying to see?\" she said. \"Yes, tickets were 11 dollars, we had to come,\" she added.\n\nThe reason for the steep slide in ticket prices is the Sixers' steep slide in play.\n\n\"They're struggling, they're struggling. I think if Embiid was healthy, they'd be doing a lot better,\" said Chonetha Hernandez, a Sixers fan.\n\n\"Do you feel like you're getting your money's worth going to the game tonight?\" Keeley asked Oscar Hernandez, a Sixers fan. \"Uh, no, not really. I'm kinda bummed out the season came out the way it is,\" he replied.\n\n\"Does it stink paying money to see Embiid and then not seeing him play?\" Keeley asked Ari Hernandez, a Sixers fan. \"Yeah, it really sucks, and then when he is not even there on the bench, it also sucks even more, a little worse, a little worse,\" she said.\n\n\"Even though you paid for your tickets already, were there any second thoughts crossing your mind? Should I even go tonight?\" Keeley asked Chris Johnson, a season ticket holder. \"I did. I had them on StubHub tonight. The only reason I came is because they didn't sell,\" he laughed.\n\n\"The Embiid story, everybody's got mixed emotions…All I know is we won the Super Bowl! We won the Super Bowl! That'll carry through whatever the Sixers are doing. Whatever the Sixers are doing, we'll figure it out. We'll figure it out,\" said Tyrone J., a Sixers fan.",

Officials say the violent attack was unprovoked.\n\n\n\nA young police officer is fighting for his life after an unprovoked attack in the line of duty in Camden on Sunday.\n\nAn investigation is underway.\n\nWhat we know:\n\nOfficials are investigating after police say a Camden County police officer was stabbed outside a grocery store Sunday night.\n\nPolice say just before 6 p.m. on Sunday night, an officer was speaking to an individual outside Duran Grocery, at Broadway and Chestnut, as he was there to do a business check.\n\nCompletely unprovoked, police say Richard Dennis, 38, came up and stabbed the officer in the neck.\n\n\"He quickly went back to his training applied pressure while hitting his emergency button on his radio,\" said Chief Rodriguez. \"There was a supervisor directly down the street, probably a half block away that responded immediately, put him in the vehicle, and transported him here to the hospital which really saved his life.\"\n\nPolice say Dennis was taken into custody around the corner three minutes later and they recovered the knife.\n\nDennis, 38, is charged with attempted murder, aggravated assault on a law enforcement officer and related offenses.\n\nCamden County police identified the officer as Joshua McKnight, 23, a Pine Hill, NJ native who served as a Marine for four years before joining the department two years ago.\n\nChief Gabriel Rodriguez says Officer McKnight is responsive, still in and out of consciousness, but they are hopeful his condition will continue to improve.\n\nWhat we don't know:\n\nPolice say Dennis would not speak with investigators, so they still do not have a motive.\n\nWhat they're saying:\n\nOfficials are calling the attack \"unprovoked,\" and say it unfolded as the officer was conducting a business check.\n\n\"This is a surreal feeling for us, we’re all feeling a numbness that this happened to one of us in this way, unprovoked, and it’s scary,\" said Chief Rodriguez. \"This is a job he’s wanted to do his entire life, his mother said that as soon as she got to the hospital. He was out of his vehicle for 58 seconds before this attack occurred.\"\n\nAttorney General Matt Platkin condemned the violent attack on those in the line of duty.\n\n\"On Sunday evening, a member of the Camden County Police Department was stabbed in the line of duty in Camden, New Jersey… No acts of violence can be condoned, in particular ones that target our heroic law enforcement professionals. Our heartfelt prayers are with the officer who was injured, the responding officers, and their loved ones waiting, hoping for their safe return home.\"\n\n\"When something like this that just doesn’t make any sense happened it hurts everyone, everyone’s impacted,\" says Mayor Victor Carstarphen, who visited the officer at the hospital Sunday night.\n\nThere was a heavy, visible police presence back at the scene today and around the neighborhood. Chief Rodriguez says that area is always on their radar, and it is not unusual for officers to be in cars by themselves with other officers working nearby. However, they’re considering everything.\n\n\"We want to make sure our officers feel safe while they’re out there doing their job, so yes, I am considering some changes as well,\" he said.\n\nWhat's next:\n\nDennis is expected to appear in court on Thursday.",

A recall report warned that the impacted vehicles could face a loss of power steering assistance. The problem has not caused any known injuries, deaths or crashes.\n\n\n\nTesla is recalling more than 376,000 of its electric vehicles in the U.S. over a potential power steering issue.\n\nA recall report dated Feb. 19 and submitted to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration warns that the impacted vehicles could face a loss of power steering assistance.\n\nRELATED: 1 in 5 vehicles on US roads have an unresolved recall. Is yours one of them?\n\nHere’s what drivers should know:\n\nTesla recall over power-assisted steering issue\n\nWhat we know:\n\nTesla is recalling certain 2023 Model 3 and Model Y vehicles manufactured for sale in the U.S. that were equipped with a software release prior to 2023.38.4. The vehicles could face a loss of power steering assistance \"when the vehicle reaches a stop and then accelerates again\" if they experience an \"overstress condition\" in the printed circuit board for electronic power-assisted steering (EPAS), Tesla said in the recall report.\n\n\"A loss of power steering assist can require greater steering effort, especially at low speeds, increasing the risk of a crash,\" NHTSA said.\n\nThe problem has not caused any known injuries, deaths or crashes.\n\nBy the numbers:\n\nA total of 376,241 vehicles have been recalled as part of the issue.\n\nFILE - In an aerial view, Tesla cars sit parked in a lot at the Tesla factory on April 20, 2022, in Fremont, California. (Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)\n\nDig deeper:\n\nTesla said it designed the vehicles in a way that steering \"will not be affected\" if they suffer the \"overstress condition\" while driving above 0 miles per hour.\n\n\"Tesla’s design avoids any unreasonable risk to safety by preventing a loss of EPAS while the vehicle is in motion,\" the automaker said on its website. \"In addition, Tesla does not believe that loss of EPAS when the vehicle reaches 0 mph is an unreasonable risk to safety because manual steering remains available.\"\n\nBut Tesla said it decided to recall the affected vehicles in all markets to \"avoid confusion for our customers\" after a \"determination by a regulator in a non-US market that loss of EPAS at 0 mph should be remedied through a recall.\"\n\nWhat's next:\n\nTesla began deploying a free over-the-air software fix to address the issue that could cause the \"overstress condition\" in the printed circuit board in October 2023. It said in the report that 99% of U.S. affected Model 3 and Model Y cars had already received software release 2023.38.4 or later as of Jan. 23, 2025. Owners of the recalled EVs will not need to take their vehicle to a dealership, according to the report. They can expect to receive notification about the recall in the mail late next month.\n\nHow to check if your car is under recall\n\nDig deeper:\n\nDrivers can check if their vehicle is under recall by using the NHTSA’s VIN look up tool:\n\nGo to NHTSA.gov/Recalls\n\nEnter the vehicle's 17-character VIN\n\nSearch for recalls",

(Images: FTS)\n\nBig picture view:\n\nLayoffs and firings have affected many federal departments in recent weeks.\n\nSince Donald Trump took office in January, one of his top priorities has been cutting and reorganizing spending within the federal government.\n\nThe president has tapped billionaire businessman Elon Musk to lead the so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), which has been tasked with finding and prioritizing what to cut. Thousands of federal government employees have been laid off or fired in the process.\n\nDig deeper:\n\nMusk’s email came just hours after Trump encouraged him on social media to \"get more aggressive\" in reducing the size of the government.\n\nRELATED: Elon Musk says federal employees must email ‘what they got done last week’\n\nReaction to Elon Musk’s email\n\nWhat they're saying:\n\nDemocrats and some Republicans were critical of Musk's directive.\n\nKey federal agencies from the FBI and State Department to the Pentagon instructed their employees not to comply with the request.\n\nLabor unions have threatened lawsuits.\n\nPresident Trump and Musk both posted a meme mocking federal employees.\n\n\"Put a dose of compassion\"\n\n\"If I could say one thing to Elon Musk, it’s like, please put a dose of compassion in this,\" Sen. John Curtin, R-Utah. \"These are real people. These are real lives. These are mortgages. ... It's a false narrative to say we have to cut and you have to be cruel to do it as well.\"\n\nDemands OMP withdrawal\n\nRep. Gerry Connolly, D-VA, demanded Sunday that the Office of Personnel Management withdraw the email.\n\n\"This threat is illegal, reckless, and yet another example of the cruel and arbitrary chaos Mr. Musk is inflicting on the people’s government and its dedicated public servants. You must immediately clarify that federal employees’ nonresponse to this ill-conceived, weekend email does not constitute resignation,\" he wrote .\n\n\"Pause any responses\"\n\nNewly confirmed FBI Director Kash Patel , an outspoken Trump ally, instructed bureau employees to ignore Musk’s request, at least for now.\n\n\"The FBI, through the Office of the Director, is in charge of all of our review processes, and will conduct reviews in accordance with FBI procedures,\" Patel wrote in an email confirmed by The Associated Press. \"When and if further information is required, we will coordinate the responses. For now, please pause any responses.\"\n\nRELATED: FBI Director Kash Patel to take over ATF, reports say\n\n\"The Department will coordinate responses\"\n\nPentagon leadership instructed employees to \"pause\" any response to Musk's team as well.\n\n\"The Department of Defense is responsible for reviewing the performance of its personnel and it will conduct any review in accordance with its own procedures,\" according to an email from Jules Hurst, the deputy undersecretary of defense for personnel and readiness. \"When and if required, the Department will coordinate responses...\"\n\n\"Cruel and disrespectful\"\n\n\"It is cruel and disrespectful to hundreds of thousands of veterans who are wearing their second uniform in the civil service to be forced to justify their job duties to this out-of-touch, privileged, unelected billionaire who has never performed one single hour of honest public service in his life,\" AFGE President Everett Kelley said.\n\n\"AFGE will challenge any unlawful terminations of our members and federal employees across the country.\"\n\nThe other side:\n\nMusk and Trump appeared undeterred.\n\nThey both posted a meme on social media mocking federal employees. The Sunday post featured a cartoon character writing a list of accomplishments from the previous week led by, \"Cried about Trump,\" \"Cried about Elon,\" \"Made it into the office for once,\" and \"Read some emails.\"\n\nTrump posted it to his Truth Social site a few hours after Musk posted it on X .\n\nAccording to DOGE’s official website , as of Feb. 17, 2025, the agency estimates its savings around $55 billion. The agency attributes this to \"a combination of fraud detection/deletion, contract/lease cancelations, contract/lease renegotiations, asset sales, grant cancelations, workforce reductions, programmatic changes, and regulatory savings.\"\n\nWhat's next:\n\nThe deadline to reply was listed as Monday, Feb. 24, at 11:59 p.m., although the email did not include Musk's social media threat about those who fail to respond.\n\nIt’s unclear what the next steps will be this week once the deadline passes.\n\nUSAID workers fired\n\nMeanwhile:\n\nThe Trump administration said it is placing all but a fraction of staffers at the U.S. Agency for International Development on leave worldwide and eliminating at least 1,600 U.S.-based jobs.\n\nThe notices were sent to USAID workers and viewed Sunday by The Associated Press.\n\nBig picture view:\n\nThe move was the latest and one of the biggest steps yet toward what Trump and Musk say is their goal of gutting the 60-year-old aid agency as part of their broader goal of cutting the size of the federal government.",

Charly Triballeau/AFP via Getty Images\n\nThe Super Bowl win is the Eagles' second in seven seasons. They've won two of three Super Bowl appearances since 2018. Before Super Bowl LII in 2018, Philadelphia had only been to the big game twice, losing in 1980 and 2005.\n\nThe last time the Eagles won the Super Bowl in 2018, President Trump canceled their visit over a national anthem dispute.\n\nWhile President Trump became the first sitting president to attend a Super Bowl, he has remained silent about the Eagles' winning the game. Mr. Trump also didn't congratulate the Birds after the NFC championship game.\n\nHere's what to know about the Birds potentially heading to the White House after winning the second Super Bowl in franchise history.\n\nWhat happened after the Eagles won the Super Bowl in 2018?\n\nAfter the Eagles won their first Super Bowl in 2018, Philadelphia did not visit the White House. Mr. Trump canceled the visit a day before over a national anthem dispute.\n\nMr. Trump said some members of the 2018 team \"disagree with their president because he insists that they proudly stand for the national anthem, hand on heart.\"\n\nThe president claimed the Eagles wanted to send a \"smaller delegation\" to the White House. Sources told CBS News Philadelphia that \"less than a handful\" of players signed up to meet with the president.\n\nAccording to the White House, the Eagles informed them on May 31 that 81 people — players, coaches, management and personnel — would visit the executive mansion.\n\nFormer White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders accused the Eagles of pulling a \"political stunt\" by rescheduling the visit because many of the players wouldn't attend. The White House claimed Mr. Trump would be overseas during the proposed dates.\n\nIn response to the cancellation of the White House visit, the Eagles released a statement without mentioning the president.\n\n\"It has been incredibly thrilling to celebrate our first Super Bowl championship. Watching the entire Eagles community come together has been an inspiration,\" the Eagles' statement read. \"We are truly grateful for all of the support we have received, and we are looking forward to continuing our preparations for the 2018 season.\"\n\nNick Foles #9 of the Philadelphia Eagles celebrates with the Vince Lombardi Trophy after defeating the New England Patriots 41-33 in Super Bowl LII at the U.S. Bank Stadium on February 4, 2018 in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Elsa/Getty Images\n\nMoments after the White House canceled the event, former Eagles wide receiver Torrey Smith posted on social media, \"So many lies.\"\n\nSeveral members of the 2018 Eagles, including Malcolm Jenkins, Chris Long, and Brandon Graham, previously said they would not attend the White House ceremony.\n\n\"To me, not going to the White House had nothing to do with the anthem. I said I wasn't going to the White House a long time ago,\" Long said in June 2018.\n\nJenkins, who helped create the Players Coalition to fight for racial and social equality, demonstrated by raising his fist during the national anthem. In a 2017 preseason game, Long put his arm around Jenkins during the anthem and said afterward, \"I'm here to show support as a White athlete.\"\n\nIn 2016, former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick began kneeling during the national anthem to raise awareness for racial injustice. In the years after, other NFL players joined by protesting during the anthem.\n\nWere the Eagles the only championship team not to visit the Trump White House in his first term?\n\nThe 2018 Eagles are not the only championship team, professional or collegiate, to skip a visit to the White House during Mr. Trump's first term as president.\n\nIn fact, the Eagles aren't the only Philadelphia-area championship team not to go. The 2017-18 Villanova Wildcats didn't visit the White House after former head coach Jay Wright said Mr. Trump did not invite the team.\n\nWhile the Patriots went in 2017, several players skipped the visit, including Tom Brady for \"personal reasons\" and Devin McCourty, Martellus Bennett, Dont'a Hightower and former Eagles Chris Long and LeGarrette Blount for political differences.\n\nIn 2017, the NBA champion Golden State Warriors didn't go to the White House. Mr. Trump rescinded the invitation after Warriors star Stephen Curry said he may not attend. The Warriors won the title the next year and were not invited.\n\nAfter their WNBA championships, neither the 2017 Minnesota Lynx nor the 2018 Seattle Storm were invited by Mr. Trump to the White House.\n\nSeveral college championship teams did not attend the White House during Mr. Trump's first term, including the 2016-17 University of North Carolina men's basketball team, 2016-17 South Carolina women's basketball team, 2017-18 Notre Dame women's basketball team and 2018-19 University of Virginia men's basketball team.\n\nThe 2018-19 Baylor women's basketball team became the first women's team to visit the White House solo under Mr. Trump.\n\nWhich president started Super Bowl winner White House visits?\n\nIn 1980, President Jimmy Carter invited the Pittsburgh Steelers to the White House for a joint visit with the Pittsburgh Pirates, who had won the 1979 World Series.\n\nThe Steelers beat the Rams in Super Bowl XIV. The Pirates won the 1979 World Series in seven games over the Baltimore Orioles.

He's now in charge of the country's largest health agency.\n\n\"I think it's a sad day for children. I think it's a sad day for the public's health,\" Dr. Paul A.

I am neither. I am pro-safety,\" Kennedy said during his hearing.\n\nOffit says there are decades of research highlighting the safety of vaccines, which Kennedy has challenged.\n\n\"So I think he said whatever he needed to say to get confirmed, but I think that he is going to be exactly who he has been for the last 20 years,\" Offit said. \"Believe him when he says what he is.\"\n\nBeyond the vaccine issue, Kennedy has vowed to \"make America healthy again.\"\n\n\"We will reverse the chronic disease epidemic and put the nation back on the road to good health,\" Kennedy said.\n\nKennedy says part of that will include taking aim at junk food.\n\n\"I agree with him largely on highly processed foods,\" said Dr. Ezekiel J. Emanuel, an expert in medical ethics and health policy at the University of Pennsylvania.\n\n\"We do know that highly processed foods are associated with a number of health problems — obesity, diabetes, dementia,\" Emanuel said.\n\nIt's unclear exactly how Kennedy will take on the food industry, but he and others in the Trump administration are vowing to disrupt the federal bureaucracy and cut wasteful spending.\n\n\"I think there are some things which are clearly worrisome,\" Emanuel said.\n\nEmanuel and Offit are especially worried about medical research that the Trump administration is already trying to cut.\n\nThe Health and Human Services Department includes the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the National Institutes of Health, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and the Food and Drug Administration.",

But despite that, Black men are significantly more likely to die from the disease, and Black women who have a less chance of developing cancer are more likely to die from it,\" said Dr. William Dahut, the chief scientific officer at the American Cancer Society.\n\nThe report finds Black patients compared to White patients have a two-fold higher risk of death for myeloma, prostate, uterine (endometrial), and stomach cancers, and 40% to 50% higher for colorectal, breast, cervical and liver cancers.\n\n\"In prostate cancer, Black men are about 67% more likely to be diagnosed and about two times more likely to die,\" Dahut said. \"There's probably a different inherited risk in Black men than white men. Based on our research, Black men are often not offered the same treatment options as white men.\"\n\nWaddington shares his story to raise awareness about the disparities.\n\n\"Part of this work I do with the American Cancer Society is I tell people I wanna be around for grandkids,\" Waddington said. \"I push myself to stay on top of my health. This is what I want my legacy to be, granddad did something to help, you know, the community overcome cancer.\"\n\nWork, he hopes, will save more lives.\n\nThe cancer society says men should be getting PSA blood tests starting at age 50 – earlier if they're in a high risk group.",

Literally, came out of nowhere and just appeared and gave me my bag back. I was like, 'oh my god, how is that even possible?'\" said Romanelli. \"He was here, just doing his thing, and he heard cries for help. And he went and helped a person. And he doesn't know me, he didn't owe me anything. I just think that that's a remarkable human to do something like that,\" said Romanelli.\n\nWhile Venter says he'd do it all again in a heartbeat, the incident has inspired him to host a free self-defense seminar for women on Saturday, March 15 at 2 p.m. His goal is to give them the skills to defend themselves in a similar situation.\n\n\"We're going to work on mostly situational awareness, and 3 or 4 self-defense [moves] that we're going to practice over and over,\" said Venter.\n\nIf you're interested in signing up for Venter's self-defense class, there are still spots available.

        "content": "SEPTA bus drivers secured safety improvements, including bulletproof glass enclosures for their vehicles, when they signed a new contract last year and avoided a strike.\n\nThe compartments were designed after the murder of Bernard Gribbin, who was driving a Route 23 bus on Germantown Avenue when he was shot multiple times by a passenger on Oct. 26, 2023 – sparking concerns about safety among drivers.\n\nNow, those bulletproof enclosures will be put to the test.\n\nSEPTA says on Tuesday, multiple SWAT officers will fire rounds at the bulletproof panes to test their durability.\n\nAssuming the compartment holds up, a pilot program to install them on some buses will begin and those buses will hit the road this spring.\n\nThe glass enclosures were designed by Custom Glass Solutions of Trumbauersville, Bucks County. The Transport Workers Union of America, which represents thousands of SEPTA employees, says the enclosures are the first of their kind in the country.\n\nUnion officers from Philadelphia as well as other cities, including Houston and Miami, will be watching the demonstration.\n\n\"This safety measure is necessary because of the outrageous and grotesque level of violence against front-line transit workers,\" TWU International President John Samuelsen said in a statement. \"We need to completely encapsulate Bus Operators to protect them from all sorts of attacks and threats, including gunfire. It's unacceptable that Bus Operators leaving home for work worry they might wind up in the emergency room, or worse.\"\n\nGribbin, 48, was described in an obituary as an Army veteran who was stationed in Germany and deployed to Bosnia from 1996 to 1999. The avid follower of pro wrestling lived in Abington, Montgomery County, and had worked for SEPTA for 12 years as a bus operator.",

A post shared on Monday, Feb. 24 said \"It has been a very difficult weekend for us. We have lost our work team for now.\"\n\nThe business said it would continue to operate as normal in the meantime.\n\nLast month, an apparent ICE raid was carried out at a car wash in North Philadelphia's Juniata Park neighborhood. Seven people were detained in the operation, which ICE Philadelphia said was also based on allegations that employees were being subjected to labor exploitation.\n\nThe owner of the car wash told CBS News Philadelphia the men had worked at the business for at least 15 years, and claimed ICE never presented a warrant before carrying out the arrests.\n\nICE operations on businesses have been playing out across the country amid President Donald Trump's crackdown on illegal immigration.\n\nThe first piece of legislation signed by Trump in his second term as president was the Laken Riley Act, which expands the federal government's ability to detain immigrants who are in the U.S. illegally.\n\nDerek DeCosmo, an immigration expert at DeCosmo Law, explained that under the new law, anyone with an allegation against them or a pending charge could be subject to being held by authorities. \"A judge is not going to have the legal authority to review it,\" DeCosmo said.\n\nAccording to data obtained by CBS News, ICE started releasing some detainees earlier this month because it ran out of space in its detention system amid a spike in arrests.",

        "source": "https://www.cbsnews.com/philadelphia/",
        "content": "Joel Embiid has been ruled out for Monday night's game against the Chicago Bulls as he and the Sixers consult with doctors after he completed new imaging on his injured left knee. ESPN was the first to report the news.\n\nSixers head coach Nick Nurse said the tests on Embiid's left knee will continue on Monday and Tuesday. So is this the last we've seen of the big fella this season? Nurse said the team isn't at the point of ruling him out for the season.\n\n\"We are playing and testing and trying to figure it out and go from there,\" Nurse said.\n\nEmbiid and the Sixers are weighing all options, including surgery, as he continues to deal with an injured left knee that has hampered his play on the court and kept him sidelined for most of the season.\n\nOver the weekend, Embiid sat the entire fourth quarter in Philadelphia's loss against the Brooklyn Nets after he was slow to get up in the third quarter, but Nurse said that was a lineup decision — not because of an injury.\n\nEmbiid has been getting injections in his left knee regularly along with other treatments, but it hasn't improved. The 2022-23 NBA MVP and two-time scoring champ has admitted recently that he's been struggling with the knee injury and has hinted at having surgery to \"fix the problem.\"\n\nEmbiid has only played in 19 of the Sixers' 56 games due to his left knee injury, a foot sprain, a sinus fracture and a three-game suspension he served at the beginning of the 2024-25 season for shoving Philadelphia Inquirer columnist Marcus Hayes.\n\nEmbiid hasn't been himself all year as he's continued to battle through the injuries. His 23.8 points per game are his lowest average since the 2019-20 season. He's also been shooting an uncharacteristic 44.4% from the field, which is the first time he's shot below 50% since the 2021-22 season.\n\nEmbiid and the Sixers had championship aspirations after an offseason that landed them nine-time All-Star Paul George, but the signing hasn't work out thus far.\n\nLast season, Embiid also missed a significant number of games after he tore the meniscus in his left knee. He played 39 regular season games, had surgery on his left knee in February, and then returned in time for Philadelphia's loss in the first round of the playoffs against the New York Knicks.\n\nAt the beginning of the season, the Sixers wanted Embiid to be healthy for the postseason, which is something that he's struggled with his entire career. Embiid told ESPN he would probably never play in back-to-back games for the rest of his career. But the plan to get them there obviously hasn't come to fruition\n\n\"It is disappointing, it certainly has been disappointing, there's no question about it,\" Nurse said. \"I don't think that anybody envisioned it going like this. So yeah, it is. It's disappointing on a lot of levels, man. He wants to play. We want him to play. Our best version of our team is with him playing, getting to where we want it to go and it hasn't worked out like that yet.\"",

That's absurd,\" he said.\n\nDugan says he was never invited to the meeting in the first place and says something isn't adding up.

Pay attention to both candidates,\" he said. \"Inform yourself. Educate yourself.\"",

Vincent didn't identify the team.\n\nBut according to The Athletic, that team is the Green Bay Packers.\n\nGreen Bay Packers president and CEO Mark Murphy called the tush push \"bad for the game\" in a message posted on the team's website after the Packers were eliminated by the Eagles in the playoffs.\n\n\"There is no skill involved and it is almost an automatic first down on plays of a yard or less,\" Murphy wrote. \"I would like to see the league prohibit pushing or aiding the run.\"\n\nEagles right tackle Lane Johnson reacted to the news about the proposal on X with a crying laughing face emoji.\n\nPhiladelphia Eagles quarterback Jalen Hurts (1) scores a touchdown against the Kansas City Chiefs during the first half of the NFL Super Bowl 59 football game, Feb. 9, 2025, in New Orleans. Godofredo A. Vásquez / AP\n\nNFL owners could vote on the proposal when they meet next month in Florida.\n\nThe tush push has become synonymous with the Eagles. Perhaps no example summed up how much the play can be a challenge for Eagles opponents quite like when Philadelphia used it against Washington in the NFC championship game. The Commanders jumped offside four times in a sequence of five plays while trying to stop the tush push — earning them a warning from the referee that he could award the Eagles a touchdown if the Commanders did it again.\n\nBills coach Sean McDermott, a member of the competition committee, on Monday mentioned player safety concerns — even though Buffalo has used a version of the play.\n\n\"The way that the techniques that are used with the play, to me, have been potentially contrary to the health and safety of the players,\" McDermott said at the NFL scouting combine. \"You have to go back through, in fairness, to the injury data on the play, but I just think the optics of it I'm not in love with.\"\n\nMcDermott didn't say whether he favored a rule change. Although the Bills were mostly successful when they used the tush push in short-yardage situations last season, quarterback Josh Allen was stopped for no gain on fourth-and-1 early in the fourth quarter of a 32-29 loss to Kansas City in the AFC championship game.",

        "content": "Joel Embiid and the 76ers are consulting doctors and considering alternative options, including surgery, on his injured left knee, an NBA source confirmed to CBS News Philadelphia. ESPN first reported the news.\n\nThe news comes as Embiid sat the entire fourth quarter in Philadelphia's loss at the buzzer to the Brooklyn Nets on Saturday night at the Wells Fargo Center. He was slow to get up late in the third quarter against Brooklyn after he lost the ball and hit the court.\n\nEmbiid is scheduled to have tests on his knee early this week. Embiid has been getting injections in his left knee regularly along with other treatments but his left knee hasn't improved. The 2022-23 NBA MVP has admitted recently that he's been struggling with the knee injury and has hinted at having surgery to \"fix the problem.\"\n\nEmbiid has also dealt with a foot sprain and a sinus fracture in the 2024-25 season. He's only played in 19 of 56 possible games due to injuries and a three-game suspension after he shoved a Philadelphia Inquirer columnist. Embiid is questionable for Monday night's game against the Chicago Bulls with left knee injury management.\n\nEmbiid and the Sixers entered the season with high expectations following an offseason in which the team inked nine-time All-Star Paul George to a max contract and signed rising star Tyrese Maxey to a contract extension. But the team has been plagued by injuries and struggled on the court. Embiid also signed a three-year, $192 million contract extension in the offseason. The Sixers are 20-36, have lost seven straight and are 12th in the Eastern Conference, which is just outside the NBA's Play-In Tournament.\n\nIn 19 games this season, Embiid is averaging 23.8 points, which is his lowest mark since the 2019-20 season. He's also averaging 8.2 rebounds and shooting 44.4% from the field.\n\nLast season, Embiid also missed a significant number of games after he tore the meniscus in his left knee. He played 39 regular season games, had surgery on his left knee in February and then returned in time for Philadelphia's loss in the first round of the playoffs against the New York Knicks.\n\nEmbiid then won the gold medal with the United States over the summer and missed the first nine games of the season the 2024-25 season due to managing his injured left knee.\n\nEmbiid potentially having surgery or missing an extended period of time will have ramifications on the team's first-round pick in the 2025 NBA draft. The Sixers' first-round pick is top-six protected. If it doesn't fall within the first six picks, it goes to the Oklahoma City Thunder. Philadelphia's loss to the Nets on Saturday put the Sixers in sole possession of the sixth-worst record in the NBA.",

        "content": "Pope Francis remains in critical condition Pope Francis' health shows improvement but condition remains critical 02:19\n\nVatican City — Pope Francis continued his recovery from pneumonia Tuesday as the Vatican set in motion a nightly marathon of prayers from \"his house\" and allies cheered him on in hopes that he might recover and get back to leading the Catholic Church. The Vatican's typically brief morning update said: \"The pope slept well, all night.\"\n\nVatican sources said the pope's condition remained the same Tuesday morning as it had been the previous evening, and that he had been able to get out of bed and eat breakfast on his own.\n\nOn Monday evening, doctors said he remained in critical condition with double pneumonia but reported a \"slight improvement\" in some laboratory results. In the most upbeat bulletin in days, they said he had resumed work from his hospital room, calling a parish in Gaza City that he's kept in touch with since the war there began.\n\nAfter night fell, thousands of faithful gathered in a rain-soaked, chilly St. Peter's Square for the first of a nightly recitation of the Rosary. The prayer evoked the 2005 vigils when St. John Paul II was dying in the Apostolic Palace, but those on hand said they were praying for Francis' recovery.\n\nStanding on the same stage where Francis usually presides, the Vatican secretary of state, Cardinal Pietro Parolin, said that ever since Francis had been hospitalized, a chorus of prayers for his recovery had swelled up from around the world.\n\n\"Starting this evening, we want to unite ourselves publicly to this prayer here, in his house,\" Parolin said, praying that Francis \"in this moment of illness and trial\" would recover quickly.\n\nThe Argentine pope, who had part of one lung removed as a young man, has been hospitalized since Feb. 14 and doctors have said his condition is touch-and-go, given his age, fragility and pre-existing lung disease.\n\nBut in Monday's update, they said he hadn't had any more respiratory crises since Saturday and the flow and concentration of supplemental oxygen has been slightly reduced. The slight kidney insufficiency detected Sunday wasn't causing alarm at the moment, doctors said, while saying his prognosis remained guarded.\n\nStill, the mood was mostly grim in the monumental square, with many of the roughly 4,000 assembled understanding they may be in Rome for Francis' final days. Crowds sat under umbrellas on folding chairs or stood by the vast colonnades as they reflected fondly on the pontiff's legacy.\n\n\"To see him suffer hurts,\" said Robert Pietro, a Romanian seminarian who stood at the prayer holding a small, fragrant candle in tribute. \"But we also pray in thanksgiving for what he has done for the Church.\"\n\nRoberto Allison, a priest from the Mexican state of Guadalajara, said members of his community had come together to show appreciation for \"all that we have learned from him.\"\n\nStopping to deliver personal blessings to some at the end of the ceremony, Cardinal Angelo Bagnasco said the crowd's diversity - many world languages could be heard spoken - was \"a big sign of comfort\" for the Catholic Church.\n\nThe faithful attend a rosary prayer for Pope Francis in St. Peter's Square at the Vatican on rvening of Feb. 24, 2025. Riccardo De Luca / Anadolu via Getty Images\n\nA couple of Catholic tourists from Chicago, who arrived holding umbrellas well before the service started, said they prayed for the pope at daily Mass earlier at St. Peter's Basilica, and decided to come back. Like many, they found it \"hard to process\" they may be in Rome for Francis' final days.\n\n\"No one knows the day and time, but it's a historic moment nonetheless,\" said Edward Burjek.\n\nIt felt the same for Hatzumi Villanueva of Peru. She was particularly fond of former pope St. John Paul II but said Francis, as the first Latin American pope, \"draws a bit closer.\"\n\n\"We came to pray for the pope, that he may recover soon, for the great mission he's sharing with his message of peace,\" said Villanueva, who praised his empathy for migrants.\n\nFrancis' papacy has also emphasized the defense of the environment and partial openness to LGBTQ+ rights.\n\nOutside the Vatican, Romans, pilgrims and even non-Catholics said they were offering special prayers for the hospitalized pope.\n\n\"We are all sorry,\" said Raniero Mancinelli, who has tailored ceremonial clothing for Francis and the two previous popes in his shop just outside the Vatican's walls.\n\nElisabetta Zumbo carried a 5-foot-long cross down a cordoned-off section of the street leading to St. Peter's as she prepared to lead a group of 34 pilgrims from the northern Italian city of Piacenza. With the rain pouring down, she pledged her group would pray intensely for the pope.\n\n\"There is a lot of emotion and a lot of sadness,\" Zumbo said.\n\nNearby, a couple from London visiting St. Peter's with their son said that even though they're not Catholic, they felt close to the pontiff \"being there in his home\" in the monumental basilica.",
