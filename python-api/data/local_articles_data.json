        "source": "https://www.inquirer.com/",
        "content": "The project will bring the turnpike 12 feet closer to the Peter Mott House, once home to a free Black abolitionist and Underground Railroad conductor. Widening the New Jersey Turnpike between Exits 1 and 4 will upgrade a section of the highway largely unchanged since it opened on Nov. 5, 1951. But the$2 billion project,slated to begin next year,also will bring southbound traffic 12 feet closer to the Peter Mott House, a museum that’s a centerpiece in the historically Black borough of Lawnside inCamden County. The Mott House, once home to a free Black abolitionist and Underground Railroad conductor, is about 120 feet from the existing turnpike. The added lane “is also going to be closer to people’s homes,” said Linda Shockley, president of theLawnside Historical Society. “We don’t really know what their [theNew Jersey Turnpike Authority] plan is,” she said. “They have what they call public ‘meetings,’ but we call them public ‘tellings,’ because they tell us what they’re going to do.” The Turnpike Authority has scheduled a public hearing focused on one component of the widening project at 7 p.m. Tuesday at Lawnside Borough Hall. After discussion of the proposal to build a U-turn restricted to official vehicles near Essex Avenue, there should be time available to discuss the overall project, said Matthew Rao, ofAECOM, the infrastructure firm doing the engineering work. “We’ve got good news,” Rao, the project manager, said during an interview Friday. “We believe Lawnside will qualify for noise barriers [along sections of the turnpike] including at the Peter Mott House,” he said. The firm also expects to conduct vibration monitoring at the Mott House before and after construction. “We don’t anticipate any problems” to arise from the work …[but] this is a historically significant property,” Rao said. Rao said 10 meetings have been held so far with Lawnside residents and officials. The authority makes robust efforts to answer questions and keep communities informed while also adhering to public notification requirements, said turnpike officials. Shockley said the news was “encouraging,” but“there needs to be information in greater detail, shared widely with the entire community.” The project will include replacing 55 bridges and overpasses along the nearly 37-mile stretch of the turnpike between Exit 4 inMount Laureland Exit 1 in Pennsville Township. A total of 18 municipalities, as well as state, county, and local roads in Burlington, Camden, Gloucester, and Salem Counties will be impacted as well — including Warwick Road in Lawnside. Construction is expected to last into the early 2030s. “The construction is going to be a hot mess,” said Kia Jones, a retiree who lives on Gloucester Avenue across from the Mott House. “The noise level from the construction and the traffic also is a concern in the community.” The Mott House “is a museum that does tours and education programs, so that we can know our history,” she said. “But the noise from the turnpike already makes it difficult for visitors and students to hear.” State Assemblyman Bill Moen (D., Camden) has worked with Lawnside officials about traffic noise and emergency vehicle access during the construction. And he has other turnpike concerns as well. “Since the 1990s, there have been efforts to advocate for connecting the turnpike to Route 42,” he said. Drivers bound for Philadelphia orAtlantic Citymust exit the turnpike and use local roads to gain access to Atlantic City Expressway and the Walt Whitman Bridge. “We’re still having conversations” about building such a connection from Exit 3 in Bellmawr, Moen said. Sam Donelson a program manager with AECOM, said the congestion at Exit 3 and the Black Horse Pike is being looked at. “But there’s a lot of analysis to go and It’s a little premature to [say] what those congestion relief opportunities might be,” he said. » READ MORE:Bellmawr’s Exit 3 is already a traffic nightmare for residents.

CHICAGO-Immigration and Customs Enforcement, along with several other federal agencies, began what they called \"enhanced targeted operations\" on Sunday inChicago. In a statement posted to social media, ICE said it was working with its federal partners \"to enforce U.S. immigration law and preserve public safety and national security by keeping potentially dangerous criminal aliens out of our communities.\" The Drug Enforcement Administration's Chicago Office also confirmed it was working with the Justice Department and ICE on enforcement efforts. The agency's X account posted photos that appeared to show border czar Tom Homan speaking with federal agents. Federal agents were seen surrounding a home at 99th and Commercial on Sunday afternoon, one of the locations on ICE's radar. \"It was about five or more cars and at first, I thought it was just police, but then they all just came out and I seen his badge, ICE,\" one neighbor said. \"No one opened the door, luckily. They were out there five minutes and everyone scattered.\" Video from Citizen also showed more agents in Garfield Park. Details on other ICE sightings around the city have not been released. Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson shareda statementon X around 6 p.m. Sunday, assuring residents that Chicago police were not involved in the ICE visits. \"There have been confirmed reports of ICE enforcement activity in Chicago today, Sunday, Jan. 26. Per city code, Chicago police were not involved in this immigration enforcement activity. My team and I are in close communication with city officials, including the CPD. It is imperative that all Chicagoans know their constitutional rights and share the Know Your Rights guidance with their neighbors and community,\" Johnson said. Other agencies ICE said it was working with include the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF), Customs and Border Protection (CBP), and the U.S. Marshals Service. What we know: Acting Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove visited Chicago on Sunday to \"personally observe\" immigration enforcement operations long touted by President Donald Trump. Bove was in the nation's third-largest city \"to personally observe Department of Homeland Security immigration enforcement operations\" and support the efforts of assisting federal agencies, according to U.S. Department of Justice spokesman Chad Gilmartin. Emil Bove, attorney for Donald Trump, at Manhattan criminal court in New York, US, on Friday, Jan. 10, 2025. The high-profile sentencing follows a failed attempt by Trump's lawyers to persuade the US Supreme Court to delay the hearing as he prepares Homan accompanied Bove on the visit, along with television personality Dr. Phil, who spoke about the mission in avideo posted Sunday morning on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter. \"It's a pretty high risk mission that we're going on. This truly is a targeted ICE mission because they're not sweeping neighborhoods like people are trying to imply. I know that because I've been involved in this, heading into this. They've identified 270 high value targets. What I mean by that is these are known criminals and terrorists. We're talking about murderers, child traffickers, child rapists. We're talking about bad actors, both in the countries they've come from and since they've been here in the United States,\" Dr. Phil said. \"That's who ICE is targeting to bring out of these communities. We're going after specific targets, not just sweeping neighborhoods and picking up anyone that looks like they don't belong here. Anybody belongs here.\" Messages left for Immigration and Customs Enforcement, ATF and FBI officials were not immediately returned to the Associated Press. ICE agents spotted in Chicago area on Sunday, Jan. 26.(Provided to FOX 32) Local perspective: Chicago residents, especially in immigrant circles,have already been on edgefor months in anticipation of large-scale immigration arrests promised by the Trump administration. Immigrant rights groups have tried to prepare with campaigns for immigrants to know their rights in case of an arrest. City officials have done the same, publishing similar information at hundreds of public transit stations. A local immigrant advocacy groupfiled a lawsuiton Saturday against the Trump administration and ICE over their planned deportation raids. On Friday, Chicago Public Schools officialsmistakenly believed ICE agents had come to a city elementary schooland put out statements to that effect before learning the agents were from the Secret Service. Word of immigration agents at a school — which have long been off limits to immigration agents until Trump ended the policy last week — drew swift criticism from community groups and Gov. JB Pritzker. What they're saying: The Democratic governor, a frequent Trump critic, questioned the operations and targeting immigrants. \"We need to get rid of the violent criminals. But we also need to protect people, at least the residents of Illinois and all across the nation, who are just doing what we hope that immigrants will do,\" Pritzker said Sunday on CNN’s \"State of the Union.\" Chicago has been one of Trump's favorite targets. The city has some of the strongest sanctuary protections, whichbar cooperation between city police and immigration agents. On Saturday, several immigrant rights groups sued ICE, seeking an injunction prohibiting certain types of immigration raids in Chicago. \"Immigrant communities who have called Chicago their home for decades are scared,\" said Antonio Gutierrez from Organized Communities Against Deportation, one of the plaintiffs. \"We refuse to live in fear and will fight any attempts to roll back the work we’ve done to keep families together.\" The Associated Press contributed to this story.

        "source": "https://www.inquirer.com/",
        "content": "Data centers, bitcoin operations, and electric vehicles are driving up demand for electricity as extreme weather conditions strain the power grid even further. Concerned with the possibility of the state’s electric supplies not meeting demand in the coming decade, thePennsylvania Utility Commission (PUC)gathered written comments from 30 industry stakeholders exploring preventative measures. In its comments, theNatural Resources Defense Council, a nonprofit international environmental advocacy group, called the state’s electric supply situation “precarious” and further warned that, if managed incorrectly, it will “cost tens of billions of dollars and risk life-threatening winter power outages.” The comment period was a follow-up to the PUC’s technical conference held in November, also about electric resource adequacy — or the ability to meet electricity demand without blackouts or disruptions in service. Environmental advocacy groups like POWER Interfaith, the Philadelphia-area, faith-based community-organizing network, said the answer is renewable, solar, and wind energies for example, and they suggested in their comments that the PUC remove barriers to affordable clean energy. » READ MORE:Environmentalists battle to get Peco to increase its use of green energy, but the oil industry calls it a job killer Last November, Pecoagreedto purchase more solar energy — in this case, enough to supply 3,000 homes. POWER called on other state utilities to follow Peco’s example. “As concerns rise about the threat of the coming administration to climate work, this win is a good reminder that there is still much progress that can be made at the local level and at our Public Utility Commissions to transition us away from fossil fuels and toward the future that our clients like POWER envision,” said Devin McDougall, anEarthjusticeattorney. The sources for rising electric demand include data centers, bitcoin operations, and electric vehicles. But the major driver is extreme weather conditions, which strain the power grid anddisproportionately impactlow-income residents. According to theNational Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI), in 2024 there were 27 weather and climate disasters with over $1 billion in damage each. One in seven Philadelphia residents spend over 10% of their income on utilities. More than 6% is considered to be a “high” energy burden; 10% or more is considered “severe.” These residents also live in low-income neighborhoods where outages tend to be more frequent, last longer, and have residents that are ill-prepared to deal with power shutdowns. POWER also argued that clean energy is a health-equity issue because the most vulnerable residents of Pennsylvania live with toxic residue of fossil fuel extraction oil. » READ MORE:POWER Interfaith proposes the ‘People’s Energy Plan,’ pushing Peco to use more renewable energy PJM Interconnection, the grid operator for 13 states, including Pennsylvania, has reported there is currently enough electricity for this winter season given the latest weather forecasts, but extreme conditions may result in implementing emergency procedures. The escalating demand also comes at a time when supply is shrinking because of the growing retirement of older coal- and gas-powered generation units and the slow pace of bringing on new units to replace them. According toPhiladelphia Energy Authority, an independent municipal authority, “Pennsylvania’s generation capacity is caught between a rock and a hard place. On the one hand, coal-fired power plants are retiring rapidly. On the other, the PJM queue is clogged with potential solar plants withering on the vine as interconnection processes grind grudgingly, and equipment for new gas-fired power plants faces a worldwide shortage.” The PUC, along with industry stakeholders, is using all its feedback to decide what steps to take to avert a crisis. “There’s a certain sense of urgency we have to have,” said Dave Velazquez, Peco president and CEO. “Utilities and the commission have a unique responsibility to our customers to make sure the lights stay on.”",

        "source": "https://www.inquirer.com/",
        "content": "Now that the Eagles are returning to the Super Bowl, the first thing on the mind of many Birds fans is: How do I purchase Super Bowl tickets? Now that the Eagles have defeated the Washington Commanders to earn a rematch against the Kansas City Chiefs in theSuper Bowl, the first thing on the mind of many Birds fans is: How do I purchase Super Bowl tickets? The short answer is it’s not going to be easy, or cheap. The face value of tickets for the Super Bowl on Feb. 9 is around $1,000 for the nosebleed section. But other than a few lucky season ticket holders, most fans will pay thousands of dollars more for a seat at the NFL’s biggest game. The Eagles are returning to the site where they played their first Super Bowl. This year’s big game is being held at Caesars Superdome in New Orleans, the home of the Saints. In 1981, it hosted the Eagles in the franchise’s first Super Bowl appearance, a mostly one-sided win by Jim Plunkett and the then-Oakland Raiders. The Superdome, which opened in 1975, has hosted seven Super Bowl games. Most recently, it was home to the Baltimore Ravens’ 34-31 win over the San Francisco 49ers in Super Bowl XLVII, which most fans remember for apower outage that delayed the game 34 minutes. While the stadium’s capacity is normally about 73,000 people, it can expand for big events to hold over 78,000 fans. In 2018, the Eagles held a lottery for season ticket holders, allowing a select few to have a chance to purchase seats at face value. Something similar occurred in 2023. As of Monday, some season ticket holders were already notified they were not selected in the Eagles’ Super Bowl ticket lottery, according to emails obtained by The Inquirer. The NFL distributes 35% of the available Super Bowl tickets to the NFC and AFC champions, with each team getting 17.5%. But many of those tickets go to players, coaches, sponsors, and members of the team’s staff. It’s virtually impossible for Eagles fans who aren’t season-ticket holders to purchase tickets at face value. For years, the NFL had its own lottery system that gave fans a shot at purchasing tickets at face value, but the league discontinued that practice in 2017. The NFL has a lottery for fans with disabilities, but entering that required sending a written request by certified mail to the league last year. (If you have a disability and would like to put yourself in the running for tickets — one wheelchair and one companion seat — to Super Bowl LX at Levi’s Stadium in Santa Clara, Calif., you can send your request for the two tickets, along with your name and address, by certified mail from Feb. 1 through Sept. 1 to: Super Bowl ADA Random Drawing, 345 Park Avenue, New York, N.Y. 10154.) The Eagles and On Location are selling tickets and hospitality packages starting around $6,600 per person, but that doesn’t include airfare or hotel accommodations. It does include an official Super Bowl ticket and pregame hospitality, including an open bar and “chef curated cuisine.” The only other realistic avenue to purchase Super Bowl tickets is from reputable secondary sales sites, such as Ticketmaster and SeatGeek. But as was the case with the NFC championship game, it will be pricey — as of early Sunday evening, the cheapest ticket on StubHub was around $5,000 before fees. On Ticketmaster, it was closer to $6,000. According to NOLA.com, hotel rooms across the city are going for more than $1,000 a night, even outside Orleans Parish. As of Monday morning, hotels near the Superdome were mostly booked up for Super Bowl weekend, likely snatched up after the NFL announced the city would be hosting the game. Those listed as available were pricey — a room at the Wyndham Garden Baronne Plaza hotel was listed for $861 a night, while a Holiday Inn Express 11 miles away had rooms available for $840 a night. If you can’t afford the high cost of attending the Super Bowl, the game will air on Fox on Feb. 9 starting at 6:30 p.m. The announcers for Fox will be the same as the NFC championship game — Kevin Burkhardt and future Hall of Famer Tom Brady, in his first year as a color analyst. Erin Andrews and Tom Rinaldi will be the sideline reporters.",

        "content": "Share There are no fans quite like Philadelphia Eagles fans. The Birds lovers showed their excitement as the team in green are headed to New Orleans to take on the Chiefs in Super Bowl LIX. PHILADELPHIA-An Eagles legend was among thousands of fans that flooded Broad Street after the Birds punched their ticket to the Super Bowl on Sunday. None other than former Eagles quarterback and Super Bowl LII MVP Nick Foles and his wife, Tori, reveled in the win in the Philadelphia streets. What we know: Foles, 36, served as an honorary team captain on Sunday and presented the Eagles with the George Halas Trophy following their 55-23 win over the Commanders. \"On behalf of the National Football League, it is my honor to present the George Halas Trophy to the National Football Conference champions, our Philadelphia Eagles,\" Foles said with one arm wrapped around Eagles owner Jeffery Lurie. Foles, a Philadelphia sports hero who took down Tom Brady and the Patriots in Super Bowl LII, headed to Broad Street to celebrate the win with thousands of fans who crammed onto one of the city's most iconic thoroughfares. \"Had to celebrate a little on Broad Street with Tori,\" Foles wrote in a post on X that included a picture of the couple among the crowds. What's next: Foles' next party could be on Burbon Street in New Orleans if the Eagles can pull off a Super Bowl LIX win over the Kansas City Chiefs. The Super Bowl will kick-off Sunday, Feb. 9 at 6:30 p.m. only on FOX.

CHICAGO —Paul George’s inaugural season with the76ershas been marred by numerous injuries, and things don’t appear to be easing up. This is far from what the nine-time All-Star and the Sixers expected whenhe signed a four-year, $211.5 million free-agent contract in July. On Saturday, George banged up his left little finger when he jammed it in the first half of a 109-97 victory over the Chicago Bulls at the United Center. The forward, who missed the second half, was scheduled to have an MRI on Sunday. » READ MORE:Sixers might not be bad enough to tank effectively. If healthy, the best bet is to go all-in for a playoff push. The 34-year-old has already missed 14 games because of separate left knee hyperextensions and bone bruises, along with left groin tightness and load management. George’s latest injury came one game after he posted a team-high 30 points Friday in a 132-129 victory over the Eastern Conference-leading Cleveland Cavaliers. It was the 15th-year veteran’s third 30-plus-point performance of the season. “You feel bad for him,”Tyrese Maxeysaid, “especially because now you think he’s finding his rhythm, kind of finding his niche where he fits in with the offense with Joe [Joel Embiid] and without Joe. And that kind of [stinks]. … Praying for him. And you know, I don’t really know what happened yet. So whatever it is, I’ll see and just pray for him.” George is averaging 17.1 points, 5.6 rebounds, 4.7 assists, and 1.7 steals. He’s shooting 42.9% from the field, including 36.5% on three-pointers. However, he has averaged 21.0 points on 48.0% shooting — including making 46.7% of his three-pointers — in his last six games. “I feel better and better as the games come along,” George said Friday about building chemistry with Maxey, who had 29 points vs. Cleveland. “It just comes down to games played, to be honest … starting to find a rhythm and just understanding of each other, and I think that’s kind of where we’ve gotten to.” » READ MORE:Don’t know Ace Bailey and Dylan Harper? Here’s why Rutgers’ draft prospects should have Sixers fans’ attention. However, George has struggled to find an offensive groove in the 13 games that Embiid played this season. He has averaged 14.1 points on 38.3% shooting while making just 25 of 83 three-pointers (30.1%) in those games. Second-year forward Ricky Council IV was assigned to the Sixers’ G League affiliate Delaware Blue Coats, who hosted the Greensboro Swarm on Sunday at Chase Fieldhouse in Wilmington. Council finished with 29 points and eight rebounds in the Blue Coats’ 111-102 victory before being recalled.

Philadelphia government began 2024 with a new mayor, plus a slate of new City Council members and a new Council president to lead them. Johnson replaced the long-tenured Darrell L. Clarke after never having held a leadership role in the legislative body. But a year in, he has effectively evolved from South Philly-focused Council member to citywide representative. He’s earned the support of many of his fellow lawmakers, even through the controversial 76ers arena negotiations and sparring with Mayor Cherelle L. Parker over school board appointments. Now, City Hall reporter Anna Orso writes, Johnson enters his second year in office bruised by the Sixers’ sudden reversal but in firm control of the chamber.

For me, that moment was when as a toddler, when I wandered into Wanamaker’s in Center City with my Dad at Christmas. I remember freezing for what seemed to be minutes on end — staring up at that iconic bronze eagle like it was medusa herself — wondering why the Eagles logo was in a century-old department store. What caught my gaze next was that incredible organ playing in the backdrop of the annual Christmas Light Show. Standing in that Wanamaker’s Grand Court with my mouth hanging wide open at every deep chord , while my mom waited for us in the Crystal Tea Room , is today a memory for me that is as vivid as though I was there standing there today. In the wake of the reality that the next generation of Philly kids may not be able to see those incredible pieces of the city’s history at 13th and Market leaves me with one lasting comfort along with the memories. I saw them standing there with my dad. 👋 Wishing you a smooth slide into a new week. I’ll be back in your inbox tomorrow morning. Correction: In Friday’s newsletter, we referred to Pennsylvania Gov.

But a block in, the “worst” she had to remove from a planter was a water bottle and some confetti. “It’s really not as bad as I expected,” Thurner said. Crowd control barricades along the sidewalks were the only sign that a mass gathering had taken place on Broad Street. The bottles, broken and intact, as well as the casings of fireworks, were gone by sunrise.

        "content": "The recently rampage in New Orleans was partly a catalyst for the new security, said Wildwood's mayor: \"The world has changed.\" From keeping a lid on teen rowdinessto trying to prevent tragedy like the recent terror attack on New Orleans’ Bourbon Street, Wildwood officials announced a number of security upgrades intended to make their historic boardwalk a safer place. The security initiative, which city officials said is meant to help protect against crime and terrorism, includes new lighting that has been installed along the city’s popular boardwalk and strategically positioned security cameras for better surveillance. Still in the planning are adding bollards, or short posts, to various points that will prevent unauthorized vehicles from accessing the boardwalk and protect pedestrians against accidental incidents or intentional vehicle-ramming attacks. “Look at what happened in New Orleans,” said Mayor Ernie Troiano Jr. “We take for granted that nobody would be stupid enough to take a car or truck up a ramp and ride down the boardwalk. Now you have to always consider the worst, and pray for the best.” Early New Year’s Day,Shamsud-Din Jabbar, 42, a Texas-born U.S. and Army veteran drove a pickup truck in a crowd on Bourbon Street in New Orleans’ French Quarter, killing 15 people and injured 57, before he was killed in a shootout with police. An ISIS flag was found in Jabbar’s truck. The rampage was investigated as an act of domestic terrorism. The tragedy in New Orleans was “a catalyst” for the thought that more security measures were called for, said Troiano. “The world has changed,” he said. Wildwood has already added new lighting along the boardwalk from 26th Street to Burk Avenue near the Wildwoods Convention Center and installed new surveillance cameras at locations along that area, city officials said. Some bollards will be permanent while others will be movable. The safety enhancements were planned with the help of the city and state police who conducted threat assessments, according to Wildwood Deputy Mayor Steve Mikulski. “While we acknowledge that vulnerabilities cannot be completely eliminated, these target enhancements are designed to significantly deter potential threats and mitigate the impact of any incidents,” Mikulski said. Many of the problems law enforcers in Wildwood and other Shore towns have had to contend with, especially in the busy summer months, have been unruly behavior and underage drinking by young people on boardwalks, beaches, and municipal streets. In Ocean City,a 15-year-old boy was stabbedin the stomach last Memorial Day weekend. His injuries were not life threatening. Shore towns have triedvarious strategiesto keep the peace, including earlier beach closings and curfews. After last Memorial Day weekend, Wildwood officials issued a nighttimebackpack banon their city’s boardwalk to limit alcohol and other substances, particularly among underage users.",

Located across from section 118, Gritty’s Chaos Factory will offer a variety of merchandise featuring the Flyers mascot, the living embodiment of chaotic neutral and the orange personification of Philly’s id. The main feature of the store will be the ability to customize your own “Itty Bitty Gritty.” Fans can buy a Gritty doll for $39.99 that comes with a jersey and  the option to purchase additional costumes — modeled after iconic ones Gritty has worn, like his turkey and leprechaun suits — for $14.99 to $19.99. The Itty Bitty Gritty dolls also squeak and come with interchangeable belly buttons, just like the real thing. “On the outside, the Itty Bitty Gritty looks like me, it squeaks like me, and it has my eyes.. but on the inside, it’s all Chaos,” Gritty wrote in an Instagram post Monday. “Some call it a plush doll, some call it an action figure.. but I want to make something VERY clear. it’s both... but better.” Christine Mina, senior vice president of marketing for the Flyers, said this is believed to be the first store ever devoted to a pro team’s mascot. It will only be open during Flyers games, to help draw Gritty’s fans (a.k.a. “Gritizens”) to see his antics in person and maybe catch some hockey, too. “Gritty’s brand is a huge opportunity for us and we’re always looking for ways to further connect with fans and bring them into the building,” she said. The opening of Gritty’s Chaos Factory comes two years after the Flyers established Gritty’s Chaos Corner in section 122. Fans who buy tickets in that section get a front-row seat to Gritty’s game-time shenanigans. Mina said the section has been popular not only with kids and parents, but with other adult Flyers fans and fans from opposing teams too. “He has a huge adult audience, which is a little unique to his brand and to mascots across the board,” she said. “It’s been a fun opportunity for us to bring new fans who might not have come otherwise.” Since hisdebut in 2018, which initially led to a wave of horror and then to undying devotion by the people of Philadelphia, Gritty’s fanbase has grownacross the countryandaround the world. Sure, he’s beloved for being unhinged, picking fights with opposing fans, and cultivating nonsense like a well-pruned garden, but, like Philly, Gritty also has a softer side. He visits kids in hospitals and marches for love in Philly’s Pride Parade, too. You never know which Gritty you’re going to get, and that’s part of his charm. “Chaos is a pillar of Gritty’s brand. It’s what makes him so fun and unpredictable,” Mina said. “You never know what he’s going to be or what he’s going to do, but you know he’s going to enjoy it.” Gritty may stop by his Chaos Factory from time to time to meet with his fans and hang with his minions (a.k.a. Itty Bitty Grittys), Mina said. “We’re excited to see what people do with their Itty Bitty Grittys — what outfits they pick and the chaos they reign with them,” she said.",

        "content": "6abc STUDIOS (WPVI) --Paid Sponsor Content The Bates landscaping team pulled into the 6abc lot with a plan to transform a little slice of our yard into a landscaped oasis. Their crew first framed out a 10x10 space then dug into the frozen earth to make it level and stable. They laid down an irregular flagstone patio, framed with boulders and topped with colorful planters and a toasty propane fire pit. Justin Bates founded Bates Landscaping in 2011.  He and his siblings had grown up working in theirfather'slandscape business.  Though Justin loved it, he he went to work in the restaurant industry as an adult, but soon found hemissedworking outdoors.  So he cashed out his retirement savings, bought some tools and hired some workers. He started out of his mother's garage in Lansdowne, mowing lawns for 8-10 customers. As business grew, his brother, Dylan, came on board, and so did Melissa Blake. She is his lead designer, business development officer and wife.  The two met working in that restaurant but she had a background in landscaping, with a degree from Penn State University and experience working at a tree care company. Justin's sister, Cailee works for the business too and so does Melissa's sister. Their projects range from simple front yard renovations to give added curb appeal to total backyard transformations with water features and maybe a barrel sauna. In February, they will participate in the the Philly Home + Garden Show for the first time.  In their 30x30 space, they hope to show people how to maximize their outdoor space. While winter may not be the time most people think of lounging outdoors, they say now is the best time to call.  It's when they're designing and sourcing materials for projects they'll complete in the spring.

(Photo by Mitchell Leff PHILADELPHIA-The Eagles are officially headed to the Super Bowl to take on the Chiefs, but one big question still remains - will Jason Kelce cheer for his brother or his former team? The backstory: The stage is set for anepic Super Bowl rematch as the Eagles take on the Chiefs just two years after the Kelce brothers faced off in what was dubbed \"The Kelce Bowl.\" However, this year, Jason Kelce won't be part of the action. Instead, he'll likely be among the fans in the stands. So, will the Eagles legend cheer for his brother Travis, the city that loves him, or stay neutral like Mama Kelce? Related Rumors are swirling that an Eagles legend could step back on the field as his team gets ready for their second Super Bowl in 3 years. What they're saying: Eagles defensive tackle Fletcher Cox toldTMZ Sportsthat Jason is Philly all the way! \"We know he's going with his team,\" Cox said. And it appears Jason agreed during an episode of his New Heights podcast last year. \"I will root for the Eagles, of course… I will also root for Travis to have a good game,\" Jason said. What's next: The podcast says they might have to revisit the question in this week's episode to see if Jason's previous answer still stands today. Watch the Super Bowl LIX live & free!

        "content": "Share FILE - This photo shows a general view of the P4 laboratory on the campus of the Wuhan Institute of Virology in Wuhan in China's central Hubei province on December 21, 2024, ahead of the fifth anniversary of China confirming its first death from the The CIA believes a laboratory is the theory that most likely explains the origination of COVID-19, an assessment that was released Saturday reportedly shows. The CIA reviewed all known intelligence surrounding the virus and believes the totality of evidence makes a lab origin more likely than a natural origin – though with \"low confidence\" in its own conclusion. Here is what to know about the recent assessment: A new CIA assessment about the origination of COVID was declassified and released Saturday on the orders of John Ratcliffe,President Donald Trump’spick to lead the spy agency. The assessment shows the CIA now believes – albeit with \"low confidence\" – that the virus responsible for the pandemic most likely originated from a lab. Earlier reports onthe origins of COVID-19have split over whether the coronavirus emerged from a Chinese lab, potentially by mistake, or whether it arose naturally. The assessment, which was completed on order from the Biden administration and former CIA Director William Burns, acknowledged the CIA has \"low confidence\" in its own conclusion, but said it now believes the evidence makes a lab origin more likely. The conclusion was not reached because of any new information, but rather from a fresh analysis. The low degree of confidence in the conclusion suggests the evidence is deficient, inconclusive or contradictory, The Associated Press reported. The backstory: While the origin of the virus remains unknown, scientists think the most likely hypothesis is that it circulated in bats, like many coronaviruses, before infecting another species. In turn, the infection spread to humans handling or butchering those animals at a market in Wuhan, China, where the first human cases appeared in late November 2019. Some official investigations, however, have raised the question of whether the virus escaped from a lab in Wuhan. Two years ago a report by the Energy Department concluded a lab leak was the most likely origin, though that report also expressed low confidence in the finding. The same year then-FBI Director Christopher Wray said his agency believed the virus \"most likely\" spread after escaping from a lab. Ratcliffe, who served as director of national intelligence during Trump's first term, has said he favors the lab leak scenario, too. RELATED:Dr. Anthony Fauci’s security detail revoked by President Trump Why you should care: The origin of the virus is a crucial question that has eluded governments and health agencies around the world since the COVID-19 pandemic began. The answer could lead to significant domestic and geopolitical implications since the spread of the virus led to lockdowns, economic upheaval and millions of deaths. The other side: Chinese authorities have in the past dismissed speculation about COVID's origins as unhelpful and motivated by politics. China's embassy in Washington did not immediately return messages seeking comment after the CIA’s assessment was released Saturday.

A previously unreleased track, ‘Hot For You Baby,’ will be featured on the 40th-anniversary reissue of her iconic album ‘Private Dancer.’ Set for release on March 21, this expanded edition of ‘Private Dancer’ will include unreleased tracks, remastered live performances, and iconic music videos. It celebrates Turner’s enduring impact on music and culture. The backstory: ‘Hot For You Baby,’ written by John Paul Young and produced by John Carter, was recorded during the 1984 ‘Private Dancer’ sessions but didn’t make the original release. The track is described as a rowdy ’80s rock anthem that perfectly showcases Turner’s husky, unmistakable voice. Turner’s ‘Private Dancer’ was a career-defining moment, peaking at No. 3 on the Billboard 200 and producing her only Billboard Hot 100 No. 1 hit, ‘What’s Love Got to Do With It.’ The album cemented Turner’s solo resurgence and legacy.

        "content": "Only four skaters, including the returning Scott Laughton, and two goalies took part in Monday’s morning skate. There was a lot of uncertainty on Monday at the Flyers morning skate. Ahead of the team’s game Monday against the New Jersey Devils at the Wells Fargo Center (7 p.m., NBCSP), coachJohn Tortorelladidn’t have any lineup news aside from sayingSam Erssonwill get the start. “We’ve got some nicks, sickness, still not sure what the lineup is going to be,” Tortorella said. Only four skaters — defenseman Erik Johnson and forwardsScott Laughton,Matvei Michkov, and Rodrigo Ābols — and the Flyers two goalies, including backupIvan Fedotov, hopped on the ice. Laughton, who missed a week and three games due to a family matter, returned to practice on Sunday. “We’ll see what happens, but, yeah, I feel ready to go,” Laughton said on Monday. “I was working out a little bit back home, so feel OK and ready to go. Nice to have two skates and feel the puck again.” » READ MORE:Here are three numbers that could change the Flyers’ season after consecutive losses Based on who was and was not out there, there’s a good chance Johnson remains in the lineup. Egor Zamula did not play on Saturday due to an upper-body ailment and has not practiced since. There’s also a good chance Ābols is out with Laughton slotting in at center. Therefore, the expectation is Anthony Richard — and his speed — will stay in the lineup. His speed   will be key as the Flyers try to lock down the center of the ice and play  a strong transition game. But Tortorella  wants the focus in this one to be the high man. “[The Devils are] balanced through their lineup. We’re going to have to play in the middle. I think the biggest point of emphasis for me going into tonight’s game is just our third man,” he said. “I think that’s been inconsistent, and we just can’t play that [way].” Tortorella stressed that while having the third-man high helps defensively — that player can get back easier on defense — it can also help the Flyers play on their toes and transition out of their own end. The line of Noah Cates,Bobby Brink, and Tyson Foerster has consistently done this by utilizing the triangle, a foundational aspect of hockey. But as Tortorella has noted, “That’s the part of the game that I think we need to be more consistent, especially against a team like this.” “A team like this” is a Devils squad that is fourth in the NHL in scoring chances for percentage (54.29%) and one of eight teams that has held opponents to under 1000 scoring chances at five-on-five,according to Natural Stat Trick. New Jersey is also fifth in high-danger chances for percentage (54.31%). But the last time they played, a 3-1 Flyers win on Jan. 18, the Devils were out-chanced and held to just a singular high-danger chance at five-on-five. “I think we took away their middle speed,” said Laughton, who last suited up for that game. “They’ve got some top-end speed with [Jack] Hughes and [Jesper] Bratt and guys like that [who] like to kind of wind it up. I thought we did a good job in the neutral zone. We blocked a ton of shots in our zone and they have some defensemen that can really rip the puck and Erss played a great game. “We’re going to need that again. We have a lot of division games coming up at a key time here before the break and kind of need to get rolling here.” Ryan Poehling skated on Sunday before practice and Nick Deslauriers skated on Monday before the morning skate, according to NBCSP. Each is dealing with an upper-body injury. Poehling, who was not in pads, has been out with a head injury since he was hit high by the New York Islanders’ Maxim Tsyplakov on Jan. 16. TTsyplakov was suspended for three games and is eligible to be in the lineup for the Islanders on Thursday at the Wells Fargo Center (7:30 p.m., ESPN+, HULU). Deslauriers has been on injured reserve since Dec. 6; it is retroactive to Nov. 9, the last game he played in.",

        "content": "Share Participants at a wreath-laying ceremony on the roll call square at the Buchenwald Memorial. It is the day of remembrance for the victims of National Socialism. On January 27, 1945, the Auschwitz concentration camp was liberated by Soviet troops. (Ph About 50 survivors of Auschwitz and other camps attended commemorative events at the Auschwitz-Birkenau State Museum Monday, International Holocaust Remembrance Day. The day marks the anniversary of the liberation of the Auschwitz death camp by Soviet troops - and this year is the 80th anniversary. The backstory: Some 6 million European Jews were killed by the Nazis during the Holocaust — the mass murder of Jews and other groups before and during World War II. Soviet Red Army troops liberated Auschwitz-Birkenau on Jan. 27, 1945, and the day has become known as International Holocaust Remembrance Day. An estimated 1.1 million people, mostly Jews, were killed in Auschwitz-Birkenau. Big picture view: One reason that Auschwitz has emerged as the leading symbol of the Holocaust and other Nazi crimes is that it was also a labor camp and thousands survived, eyewitnesses who could tell the world what happened there. This year’s anniversary takes on added poignancy due to the advanced age of the survivors, and an awareness that they will soon be gone, even as new wars make their warnings as relevant as ever. Monday's ceremony was widely treated as the last major observance that any notable number of survivors will be able to attend. Just 220,000 Holocaust survivors are still alive, according to the Conference on Jewish Material Claims Against Germany, and more than 20% are over the age of 90. What they're saying: Secretary of State Marco Rubio acknowledged in a statement that this \"may be one of the last years survivors are able to share eyewitness accounts of the horrors they experienced.\" \"We honor those who survived, thank the liberators, and renew our shared commitment to human freedom and justice,\" the statement read. \"As Secretary of State, I will continue my unwavering commitment to support Holocaust survivors and their heirs, just as I did in the United States Senate.\" Over the weekend, Pope Francis warned of the \"scourge of anti-semitism\" in his prayer on the eve of International Holocaust Remembrance Day. Francis said, \"The horror of the extermination of millions of Jewish people and others of different faiths during those years must never be forgotten or denied.\" World leaders and royalty joined with elderly camp survivors Monday for commemorations. Politicians, however, were not asked to speak this year. Due to the advanced age of the survivors, organizers chose to make them the center of the observances. Among the leaders expected to attend are Germany's Chancellor Olaf Scholz and President Frank-Walter Steinmeier. Germany has never sent both of its highest state representatives to the observances before, according to German news agency dpa. Among the attendees were also French President Emmanuel Macron, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Britain's King Charles III, along with kings and queens from Spain, Denmark and Norway. Local perspective: Today the site is a museum and memorial managed by the Polish state, and is one of the most visited sites in Poland. In 2024, over 1.83 million people visited the site.

        "source": "https://www.inquirer.com/",
        "content": "Part of what’s worrying some U.S. tech industry observers is the idea that the startup has caught up with American companies at the forefront of generative AI at a fraction of the cost. A frenzy over an artificial intelligence chatbot made by Chinese tech startup DeepSeek was upending stock markets Monday and fueling debates over the economic and geopolitical competition between the U.S. and China in developing AI technology. DeepSeek’s AI assistant became the No. 1 downloaded free app on Apple’s iPhone store Monday, propelled by curiosity about the ChatGPT competitor. Part of what’s worrying some U.S. tech industry observers is the idea that the Chinese startup has caught up with the American companies at the forefront of generative AI at a fraction of the cost. That, if true, calls into question the huge amounts of money U.S. tech companies say they plan to spend on the data centers and computer chips needed to power further AI advancements. But hype and misconceptions about DeepSeek’s technological advancements also sowed confusion. “The models they built are fantastic, but they aren’t miracles either,” said Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon, who follows the semiconductor industry and was one of several stock analysts describing Wall Street’s reaction as overblown. “They’re not using any innovations that are unknown or secret or anything like that,” Rasgon said. ”These are things that everybody’s experimenting with.” The startup DeepSeek was founded in 2023 in Hangzhou, China and released its first AI large language model later that year. Its CEO Liang Wenfeng previously cofounded one of China’s top hedge funds, High-Flyer, which focuses on AI-driven quantitative trading. DeepSeek began attracting more attention in the AI industry last month when it released a new AI model that it boasted was on par with similar models from U.S. companies such as ChatGPT maker OpenAI, and was more cost-effective in its use of expensive Nvidia chips to train the system on huge troves of data. The chatbot became more widely accessible when it appeared on Apple and Google app stores early this year. But it was a follow-up research paper published last week — on the same day as President Donald Trump’s inauguration — that set in motion the panic that followed. That paper was about another DeepSeek AI model called R1 that showed advanced “reasoning” skills — such as the ability to rethink its approach to a math problem — and was significantly cheaper than a similar model sold by OpenAI called o1. “What their economics look like, I have no idea,” Rasgon said. “But I think the price points freaked people out.” Behind the drama over DeepSeek’s technical capabilities is a debate within the U.S. over how best to compete with China on AI. “Deepseek R1 is AI’s Sputnik moment,” said venture capitalist Marc Andreessen in a Sunday post on social platform X, referencing the1957 satellite launchthat set off a Cold War space exploration race between the Soviet Union and the U.S. Andreessen, who has advised Trump on tech policy, has warned that over regulation of the AI industry by the U.S. government will hinder American companies and enable China to get ahead. But the attention on DeepSeek also threatens to undermine a key strategy of U.S. foreign policy in recent years to restrict the sale of American-designed AI semiconductors to China. Some experts on U.S.-China relations don’t think that is an accident. “The technology innovation is real, but the timing of the release is political in nature,” said Gregory Allen, director of the Wadhwani AI Center at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. Allen compared DeepSeek’s announcement last week to U.S.-sanctioned Chinese company Huawei’s release of a new phone during diplomatic discussions over Biden administration export controls in 2023. “Trying to show that the export controls are futile or counterproductive is a really important goal of Chinese foreign policy right now,” Allen said. Trump signed an order on his first day in office last week that said his administration would “identify and eliminate loopholes in existing export controls,” signaling that he is likely to continue and harden Biden’s approach.",

        "content": "Share US President Donald Trump waves as he boards Air Force One upon departure from Harry Reid International Airport in Las Vegas, Nevada on January 25, 2025. (Photo by Mandel Ngan/AFP via Getty Images) The Trump administration has fired about 17 independent inspectors general at federal agencies, a move consistent with his efforts to reshape the federal government in his first few days back in the White House. Here’s what to know about inspectors general, and Trump’s latest removal of them: The backstory: The role of the modern-day inspector general dates to post-Watergate Washington, when Congress installed offices inside federal and state agencies as an independent check against mismanagement and abuse of power. Their mission is to perform audits, investigations and evaluations, and to help prevent and detect waste, fraud and abuse. Though inspectors general are presidential appointees, some serve presidents of both parties. All are expected to be nonpartisan. Trump also replaced multiple key inspectors general in 2020, including those leading the Defense Department and intelligence community, as well as the inspector general tapped to chair a special oversight board for the $2.2 trillion economic relief package on the coronavirus. RELATED:What is FEMA? The Federal Emergency Management Agency explained What we know: Friday night,the Trump administrationbegan firing several independent inspectors general at federal agencies. The action removes oversight of his new administration, and some members of Congress are suggesting the dismissals violate federal oversight laws because Congress was not given 30-day notices about the removals. The Associated Press is reporting the firings based on information from two people familiar with the actions who spoke on condition of anonymity because the details haven't been made public. What we don't know: It’s unclear exactly how many inspectors general have been fired. An email to The Associated Press sent by one of the fired inspectors general said \"roughly 17\" inspectors general had been removed. The names and departments of those included have also not yet been made public. The Washington Post, which first reported the firings, said that many of those who were fired were appointees from Trump’s first term. Among those inspectors general reportedly removed included those for the Departments of Agriculture, Commerce, Defense and Education. What they're saying: Congress is reacting differently to the lack of notice about the latest round of removals of inspectors general. Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., acknowledged that the firings violated statutes but shrugged it off: \"Just tell them you need to follow the law next time,\" he said. \"Further explanation\" needed \"There may be good reason the IGs were fired. We need to know that if so,\" Sen. Chuck Grassley, chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said in a statement. \"I’d like further explanation from President Trump. Regardless, the 30 day detailed notice of removal that the law demands was not provided to Congress,\" said Grassley, R-Iowa. Democrats and watchdog groups, however, used the dismissals to raise alarm that Trump was making it easier to take advantage of the government. \"Lawless approach\" \"Yesterday, in the dark of night, President Trump fired at least 12 independent inspector generals at important federal agencies across the administration,\" Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York said Saturday on the chamber's floor. \"This is a chilling purge and it's a preview of the lawless approach Donald Trump and his administration are taking far too often as he's becoming president.\" Schumer said the dismissals are \"possibly in violation of federal law\" and help demonstrate that the move \"is a glaring sign that it's a golden age for abuse in government and even corruption.\" Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., noted that inspectors general are \"critical to rooting out waste, fraud, and abuse throughout the federal government.\" The mass firings were \"alarming,\" she said. Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts called Trump’s actions \"a purge of independent watchdogs in the middle of the night.\" The White House did not comment on Saturday. President Donald Trump was in Las Vegas for a speech focused on his campaign promise to end federal taxation on tips. Big picture view: The removals were consistent with the president's first week back in the White House, which has featureda series of stepsto remake the federal government. Trump has done everything from using executive orders to impose hiring freezes and crack down on diversity,equity and inclusion initiatives, to suggesting that he wants to shutter the Federal Emergency Management Agency and leave disaster recovery up to individual states affected by major emergencies.

PHILADELPHIA-Rumors are swirling that an Eagles legend could step back on the field as his team gets ready for their second Super Bowl in 3 years. What we know: The Eagles claimed the NFC Championship title Sunday night, punching their ticket to the Super Bowl and a highly anticipated rematch against the Kansas City Chiefs. As the team and the entire city of Philadelphia celebrated the victory, several reporters caught up with Brandon Graham to see if the Eagles veteran would be putting the uniform back on for the Big Game. The backstory: Graham was placed on the injured reserve list aftertearing his triceps during the Eagles winover the L.A. Rams back in November.

Their win set up a Super Bowl LVII rematch with the Kansas City Chiefs, this time in New Orleans. Here’s a look at four numbers and stats that stood out from Sunday’s Eagles win. » READ MORE:Eagles turn NFC championship into game of ‘mental warfare.’ Turns out, the Commanders were unarmed. There was a chance last offseason thatNick Sirianniwould be looking for a new job. A year later, he joined a pretty exclusive club. Three coachesin NFL history have reached multiple Super Bowls in their first four seasons as a head coach: Joe Gibbs, Mike Tomlin, and Sirianni. Gibbs is already in the Pro Football Hall of Fame, Tomlin will be one day, and Sirianni’s legend is only in its early stages. Sirianni is already proving to be a prolific winner. He became the fifth Super Bowl-era head coach to reach the playoffs in his first four seasons and owns the third-best winning percentage by a head coach in the Super Bowl era. The other two? Hall of Famers John Madden and George Allen. Eagles ownerJeffrey Luriealso joined a Hall of Fame duo Sunday, becoming thethird ownerto earn at least four Super Bowl berths with three different head coaches, joining former Denver Broncos owner Pat Bowlen and former Oakland Raiders owner Al Davis. » READ MORE:The Eagles are underdogs no more: Like Doug Pederson said, it’s the norm for them to reach the Super Bowl The last time a team hadseven rushing touchdownsin a playoff game, the game itself made some modern technological history. The Chicago Bears defeated Washington, 73-0, in the first NFL championship game broadcast nationwide on radio. The Eagles turned back the clock Sunday.Saquon Barkleyrushed for three touchdowns,Jalen Hurtsscored three of his own, twice via Tush Push, and Will Shipley crossed the goal line for rushing score No. 7 late in the fourth quarter when the party at Lincoln Financial Field had already started. Hurts and Barkley are the first teammates in NFL history to each have three or more rushing touchdowns in the same playoff game. The Eagles now have 39 rushing touchdowns on the season, three away from tying their record-setting 42 scores from two seasons ago. » READ MORE:‘Now we see’: There’s no stopping Saquon Barkley as he’s about to take his record-setting show to New Orleans Quinyon Mitchell’s introduction to a national audience came when the Eagles hosted the Commanders on Nov. 14 and he shut down Pro Bowl wide receiver Terry McLaurin. McLaurin got him back a little in the rematch more than a month later, but Mitchell showed again Sunday why he is in the running for the Defensive Rookie of the Year award. McLaurin, a second-team All-Pro selection, ran 48 routes Sunday, according to Next Gen Stats, and Mitchell lined up across from him on 75% (36) of those routes. On those 36 routes, McLaurin was targeted four times by Jayden Daniels and caught just one pass for seven yards. Mitchell also intercepted a Daniels throw intended for McLaurin in the end zone in the fourth quarter. » READ MORE:The Eagles preach and practice attacking the football on defense. Facing the Commanders, it was easy to see why. Hurts had one of his best games of the 2024 season Sunday. The brilliance of Hurts is in his ability to extend plays with his legs and throw on the run, but he was at his best Sunday when standing in the pocket. The Eagles had a reshuffling along their offensive line with normal centerCam Jurgensdealing with a back injury that relegated him to emergency backup (that the team needed in the second half). The Commanders, according to Next Gen Stats, generated five unblocked pressures and eight quick pressures, both of which were the second-most Hurts faced all season. Hurts was 18-for-20 (90% completion rate) for 216 yards and his only touchdown throw when standing in the pocket, but was just 2-for-8 for 30 yards and four throwaways when he was forced out of the pocket.",

        "source": "https://6abc.com/",
        "content": "TOWAMENCIN TWP., Pa. (WPVI) --An official in Montgomery County, Pa. has resigned after posting a video showing her making a hand gesture that resembles a Nazi salute. Towamencin Township Supervisor Laura Smith submitted her resignation on Sunday. Her letter to the board wasposted on the township's website. \"To allow the Township to move forward without the encumbrance of the fallout of my video, I tender my resignation from the Towamencin Township Board of Supervisors effective immediately,\" it reads. The board said it intends to accept the resignation at a public meeting as soon as possible. \"The Board of Supervisors cannot and will not tolerate such conduct,\" the board said in a statement. Smith's gesture - in a video posted on TikTok but since deleted - also appears to mimic a controversial hand gesture made by Elon Musk just days ago at President Trump's inauguration. In the video, Smith hits her chest before she puts her arm straight out in the air with her palm down. The resignation message mirrored an earlier statement from Smith, in which she said, \"A video I posted recently to social media has been greatly mischaracterized. Not wishing to give offense, I removed the video from my accounts. I abhor racism, antisemitism or discrimination in any fashion or form, and my record as a township supervisor attests to my commitment to treat all people with dignity and respect.\" The board of supervisors said Monday a special meeting is being held about Smith's resignation on Tuesday, Feb. 4.  It will be held at 6 p.m. at the Meeting Hall of the Municipal Complex at 1090 Troxel Road. Two members of the board responded to the controversy over the weekend. Joyce Snyder told Action News in part, \"I want to say that I find her actions repugnant. Next, I ask her to think about her effectiveness as a leader.\" While Kofi Osei said in part: \"I condemn this blatant antisemitism expressed by Laura Smith in no uncertain terms and believe she should apologize and resign.\" Jason Holtzman, who is the director of the Jewish Community Relations Council of the Jewish Federation of Greater Philadelphia said: \"Public officials have a responsibility to ensure their words and actions do not perpetuate antisemitic propaganda and tropes. Ahead of International Holocaust Remembrance Day this Monday, January 27, it is even more important that we all make the commitment to educating ourselves on the lessons of the Holocaust and be resolute in condemning this hate in all forms.\"",

        "source": "https://www.inquirer.com/",
        "content": "Jurgens was forced to gut out playing the NFC title game with a back injury when his replacement at center, Landon Dickerson, went down with an injury of his own. Next up, the Super Bowl. Cam Jurgenssat hunched over at his locker stall. He winced a little when he finally rose. Back injuries are tricky, as anyone who deals with chronic pain there knows. But the Eagles center’s postgame walk on eggshells was enough visual proof that Jurgens played at far less than 100 percent. How much then? “Good enough percent,” Jurgens said after the Eagles trounced the Commanders, 55-23, in the NFC championship on Sunday. “But I’ll be great for theSuper Bowl.” Jurgens personified the toughness of the Eagles, specifically their offensive line. Landon Dickerson did, as well, but he didn’t finish the game he started for Jurgens, and was gone by the time the celebratory home locker room at Lincoln Financial Field opened to reporters. » READ MORE:Eagles turn NFC championship into game of ‘mental warfare.’ Turns out, the Commanders were unarmed. Both played center and both played through injury — Dickerson until he could no longer, and Jurgens because he said he had no choice. His team needed him. “I was just trying for that to be my mentality. I need to be ready to go,” Jurgens said. “I got to be an emergency player. I got to be ready to go and do everything I can to be out there and be good enough.” Under normal circumstances, Jurgens wouldn’t have been active. He hardly practiced last week and wasn’t at a good enough percent to start after a lengthy pregame warmup. But he insisted the Eagles dress him, team sources said, just in case. Dickerson, normally at left guard, had been playing through his share of bumps, bruises, and sprains for months — a wrist here, a knee there, and who knows what else anywhere. “These guys are playing through pain,” Eagles coachNick Siriannisaid. “I just can’t say enough about how much I respect these guys of what they have to do with their bodies. I don’t think anyone knows the half it, what they have to do to play the long season.” » READ MORE:Grading the Eagles: The offense takes flight in every way, and the defense finds the football It might be hyperbolic to dramatize the physical plight of professional athletes. They’re freaks of nature. They play a kid’s sport. Casual fans just latching on to the Eagles’ run to a rematch with Patrick Mahomes, Andy Reid, and the Chiefs might not appreciate the sacrifice of Jurgens and Dickerson. But anyone who has given his or her heart and soul to a job well done should be able to recognize the meaning in their efforts. Jurgens’ emotion afterward spoke to what it took for him to jump in at halftime and play the final 30 minutes. “That was really gritty of him,” Eagles quarterbackJalen Hurtssaid. Jurgens wasn’t just a pylon out there, though. The Eagles put a second-half whipping on Washington with the run offense that once again beat a defense into submission. All told, the Eagles rushed for 229 yards.Saquon Barkleygained 118 of those yards on 15 carries as he continued to put the finishing touches on one of the greatest years ever for a running back. Barkley, who needs only 30 yards to set the combined regular and postseason record for rushing yards, was again first to salute his blockers. The O-line is the heartbeat of the Eagles. It was in each of two previous seasons in which they reached the Super Bowl. They have immense talent and depth — take a bow,Howie Roseman— and they have an unequal in O-line coach Jeff Stoutland. But the culture of toughness was fostered by Jurgens’ predecessor,Jason Kelce, and by right tackle-on-an-islandLane Johnson— “Tom Hanks onCast Away,” as he described himself — the lone Eagles O-lineman to be on all three Super Bowl teams. Two years ago, the former played through a quadriceps injury, while the latter held off core muscle surgery until the postseason. » READ MORE:How would the Eagles go on without Jason Kelce and Fletcher Cox? Cam Jurgens and Jalen Carter answered with their play. Jurgens had Hall of Fame-bound cleats to step into this season and he must have been asked about it as many times as Kelce’s face popped up on screen since retirement. He played it down for months and went on to be voted to his first Pro Bowl. “It’s big shoes to step into,” Jurgens said. “Whenever you go into the situation like that, and you think, ‘I need to fill this guy’s shoes, I need to be like Kelce, I need to do this,’ you’re going to fail. I don’t think anybody can succeed. I always look at it like I need to be the best person I can be. I need to fill my own shoes. I’m a damn good player and I just got to learn from my coaches, guys around me, and I just got to get better. “I just fought all year. Stout was on my [butt]. He’s on everybody’s [butt].” This week more than most, according to Johnson. Stoutland knew that if Jurgens couldn’t go, his unit would have two pieces out of place with Dickerson moving to center and Tyler Steen jumping in at left guard. Dickerson was the man in the middle at Alabama, and he played 42 backup snaps there the last two seasons. But he had never snapped the ball to Hurts in a game. And while Steen played 122 of his 295 snaps at left guard this season, he had never started in a playoff game. “We’ll be watching film and Stout brings up scenarios. He’ll go, ‘If he does this, he’s going to [expletive] you up,’” Steen said. “And you’re like, ‘OK …,’ but it’s a good thing he emphasizes it because when it happens you’re like, ‘Oh, this is what he was talking about,’ and it’s about to happen.” » READ MORE:‘Now we see’: There’s no stopping Saquon Barkley as he’s about to take his record-setting show to New Orleans Steen helped keep defensive tackle Jonathan Allen and Washington’s pass rushers off Hurts. The quarterback was sacked twice, but that was far less than the average of six times he was dropped in the two previous playoff games. But it was the run blocking that separated the Eagles. Left tackleJordan Mailatasealed the edge on Barkley’s 60-yard touchdown off his first touch. He teamed up with Steen on Hurts' 9-yard score off a draw. Johnson and right guard Mekhi Becton tossed defenders on several runs. Becton, another Stoutland reclamation project, remembered a call he received from the coach during training camp after the former first-round Jets tackle had wrestled the right guard job from Steen. Stoutland told him of the 2017 season when Halapoulivaati Vaitai stepped in for injured left tackle Jason Peters. “He was saying how he was the reason they won that Super Bowl. And he pretty much told me, at the beginning of the year, I’ll be the reason we get there,” Becton said. “So I told him that on the field, when I gave him a hug, I was like, ‘Let’s go finish.’” The Chiefs stand in the way. Defensive coordinator Steve Spagnuolo is bound to unmercifully blitz Hurts. Dickerson left with a knee injury. His status is uncertain but his leg may have to fall off to keep him from suiting up in two weeks. Jurgens already claimed he’s a go. But it took a “lot of heat,” Jurgens said, to get through Sunday. He lauded Tom Hunkele, Joseph O’Pella, and the Eagles training staff for getting him through “a long week.” The bizarre series of plays when the Commanders committed four penalties in a five-play span to keep the Eagles from a successful Tush Push might have felt like a week. “I was laughing the whole time,” Becton said. “It was pretty funny. And then you see a few guys up there just screaming, ‘Come on. Let’s run the play. Come on.’ And then when we did run it, we took them in the end zone. “It’s just a fun play to do. It hurts, but it’s fun.” Jurgens was at the center of it all. Two years ago, he played only five special-teams snaps as the backup in Super Bowl LVII. Kelce still laments the Spagnuolo blitz that he said he failed to pick up in the fourth quarter of that eventual 38-35 loss. Hurts handles most of the pre-snap protection calls now. Jurgens is there to assist. Maybe they get it done vs. Chiefs, who beat the Bills in the AFC championship game, this time. Kelce, who was in Kansas City on Sunday, will be rooting for his replacement, even at the expense of his brother, Travis. He knows as well as anyone what Jurgens played through. “Absolutely. Back [expletive] is ridiculous,” Kelce said in a text message. “He’s a warrior for going out there.”",

        "title": "Trump expected to sign military executive orders on Monday",
        "source": "https://6abc.com/",
        "content": "President Donald Trump will sign executive orders relating to the military, a White House official confirmed to ABC News. The first executive order Trump is expected to sign will reinstate service members removed from the military for refusing the COVID-19 vaccine, restore their rank, and provide back pay. The second executive order Trump is expected to sign directs the Department of Defense to determine a policy regarding transgender service members based on readiness. It does not put an immediate ban on trans service members. It simply directs the DOD to come up with a policy. The orders, which were first reported by the New York Post, come as Trump's nominee to lead the Pentagon, Pete Hegseth, was sworn in as secretary of defense on Saturday. Hegseth has long stated he planned to implement major cultural changes to the military, including ending DEI practices and removing \"woke\" service members. Moments after his arrival at the Pentagon on Monday, Hegseth told reporters that there are \"more executive orders coming.\" Trump had banned transgender Americans form serving in the military in 2017 during his first administration, but then-President Joe Biden issued an order in 2021 repealing the ban. Hours after being sworn in for his second term last week, Trump signed an order revoking the Biden administration's 2021 move to allow transgender members to serve. However, the order Trump is expected to sign on Monday goes even further, one of the officials said, and will outline new military standards regarding gender pronouns and state that mental and physical readiness requires transgender service members be banned from the military. \"It can take a minimum of 12 months for an individual to complete treatments after transition surgery, which often involves the use of heavy narcotics. During this period, they are not physically capable of meeting military readiness requirements and require ongoing medical care. This is not conducive for deployment or other readiness requirements,\" one of the officials said, citing a fact sheet. \"The implementation[of the ban]is on the DoD regarding specifics,\" the official said. In 2018, there were an estimated 14,000 transgender service members in the US military, according to the Palm Center, an independent research institute that has conducted extensive research on sexual minorities in the military. A second EO states that any \"discriminatory\" policies related to DEI in the military will be banned. The order comes after the Trump administration ordered employees in any federal diversity, equity, inclusion and accessibility offices to be placed on paid administrative leave \"effective immediately.\" All DEI practices in the US armed forces will also be subject to an internal review by Hegseth. The third executive order directs Hegseth to reinstate all active and reserve service members who were previously discharged for failing to get the Covid-19 vaccine. They will be reinstated with their former rank and given back pay and benefits, one of the officials said. However, the Pentagon had already rescinded the military's Covid-19 vaccination mandate allowing them to rejoin after Biden signed the 2023 National Defense Authorization Act requiring the change. CNN reported in October 2023 that only 43 of the more than 8,000 US service members who were discharged from the military for refusing to be vaccinated sought to rejoin eight months after the vaccine mandate was officially repealed.

        "content": "After ongoing plumbing problems felled the cafe, its union workers are asking for severance pay and employment offers at other Ultimo locations. Rittenhouse is down a coffee shop as of last week, when Ultimo at 20th and Locust announced it would close permanently due to ongoing plumbing issuesthat have been affecting the building and its workers since last February. That also means there’s one less unionized coffee shop in Philadelphia. Owners Aaron and Elizabeth Ultimo informed staff and Local 80, which represents Ultimo’s workers, of the closure on Jan. 14. The Rittenhouse cafe employed seven people and was one of four Ultimo locations,two of which had unions. Operations atUltimo’s other shopscontinue as usual. “Due to the ongoing plumbing repair that needed to be resolved in order for the space to be operational, we had little choice but to close,” Elizabeth Ultimo said in a statement. “We deeply regret the stress and hardship the permanent closure of this location has caused for everyone involved.” Workers at Ultimo Rittenhouse were almost one year into athree-year contract, according to Kate Lord, a union member and nearly four-year veteran of the coffee shop. “This is a loss for everyone, [the Ultimos] included,” Lord said. “We can all recognize that.” Workers were on the frontline of the plumbing problem, which Lord said got worse over the course of 11 months, despite temporary fixes by the landlord. (The Ultimos do not own the property at 238 S. 20th St.) “It got to a point where it was just sort of a constant leak onto the sidewalk and into the basement,” Lord said. The union had publicly aired the ongoing plumbing issue over the past few months, with the Philadelphia Joint Board Workers Unitedpostingaboutunexpected closureson Instagram to raise funds for staffers. The same Instagram account, @phillyworkersunited, posted about the permanent closure last week. It also announced details about a closure agreement proposal the union presented to the owners. Workers are asking for severance pay and continued employment at other Ultimo locations when possible. A post shared by PJB Workers United (@phillyworkersunited) “Despite having agreed to meet with us for effects bargaining,” the post read, “the Company gave us no response to any of our proposals and immediately stated that they would ‘get back to us next week.’” While commenters on the post construed the closure as union-busting — “Oh dang, I guess that’s one less coffee shop I’m visiting around Philly,” one wrote — the owners said the union did not play into this, citing the plumbing problem as the sole cause of the cafe’s demise. “There’s no other reason that we closed,” Elizabeth Ultimo said. Lord said the union is focused on making sure employees affected by the closure are taken care of, and that the relationship between the union and the Ultimos had been good — something that makes them want to continue working there. “A lot of us saw some kind of future at this company, whether that’s immediate or long-term,” she said. “There are a lot of people who are not looking to let go of that anytime soon.”",

        "content": "Share ICE agents have confirmed that they have arrested multiple people in Atlanta, Cartersville, and Savannah as part of an ongoing immigration enforcement operation. ATLANTA-After rumors swirled online aboutICE raids in Georgia, it has been confirmed that arrests in metro Atlanta are underway as of Jan. 26, 2025. RELATED:ICE raid rumors in Georgia: Are police departments partnering with federal officials to depot migrants? Police in at least two metro-Atlanta cities want to shut down rumors. Forest Park and Clayton County police say someone on social media falsely claims they’re working with federal immigration officials to conduct immigration-status checks. The departments of both cities say that is not true. What they're saying: \"U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, along with federal partners including the FBI, ATF and DEA, began conducting enhanced targeted operations today in Atlanta to enforce U.S. immigration law and preserve public safety and national security by keeping potentially dangerous criminal aliens out of our communities,\" a spokesperson for ICE said in a statement. \"Working with @HSIAtlanta and other law enforcement partners to arrest and remove criminal aliens that threaten our communities #iCE #immigration,\" the Enforcement and Removal Operations officetweetedSunday evening. What we know: On Sunday, an ICE spokesperson specified that targeted operations are happening in Atlanta. FBI Atlanta, Homeland Security Investigations' Atlanta office, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives and Drug Enforcement Administration are confirmed to be involved. \"Removing criminal aliens from our communities isn’t just enforcement—it’s protection. Ensuring the safety and security of our neighborhoods starts with upholding the law. #PublicSafety #CommunityFirst,\" HSI Atlanta tweeted with a photo of what appeared to be an arrest being made at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport. The DEA confirmed via X that they assisted with immigration enforcement efforts in Atlanta, Savannah and Cartersville on Sunday: There are also confirmed ongoing operations inChicago, Arizona, California, Colorado, Nebraska, and Texas/ What we don't know: Not much is known at that moment. It is not clear how many local law enforcement agencies are aiding in the operations. Authorities have not said how many people were been taken into custody across Georgia so far. The backstory: Ahead of both terms, President Donald Trump has consistently campaigned on the promise to crack down on illegal immigration in the U.S. The Trump administration is sending active-duty troops to the southern border just days after President Donald Trump declared a national border emergency. On Inauguration Day, a number of his executive orders were geared toward beefing up security at the southern border. By the numbers: ICE has been keeping a tally of how many arrests have been made each day. On Sunday night, it was confirmed that 956 people were arrested, and 554 detainers were lodged. While some of the operations may not have been unusual, ICE averaged 311 daily arrests in the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30. Over the last few days, at least six mass deportation flights have been made from the U.S. to Mexico or Guatemala. The U.S. State Department announced six deportation flights have been completed in accordance to President Donald Trump's crackdown on illegal immigration. Four flights went to Mexico and two to Guatemala. The U.S. government will now require asylum seekers to wait in Mexico while their application is processed. The other side: The raids in Chicago over the last few days drew swift criticism from community groups and Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker. \"We need to get rid of the violent criminals. But we also need to protect people, at least the residents of Illinois and all across the nation, who are just doing what we hope that immigrants will do,\" Pritzker said Sunday on CNN’s \"State of the Union.\" This story is developing. Check back for details.

The offense cashed in again and again, rushing for seven touchdowns, including a 60-yard jaunt by Saquon Barkley to get things started. A.J. Brown showed he’s more than just a sideline bookworm, too, finishing with six catches for96 yards and a touchdown. There were concerns about Jalen Hurts and his sore left knee entering the game, but the quarterback went 20-for-28 for 246 yards, a passing touchdown, the game-sealing run, and two Tush Push scores. Marcus Hayes writes that Hurts showed again thathe is a stone-cold winner. — Jim Swan,@phillysport,sports.daily@inquirer.com.

The Eagles wanted to come out slugging against the Commanders and they wound up landing a haymaker to get things started with Barkley’s 60-yard touchdown run. “We wanted to send a message and we did that,” Barkley said. “We knew that when you play a team two or three times, they kind of get a bead on some of your stuff. We gave them a dummy call and it worked to perfection.” Now Barkley will have a chance at the Super Bowl to set a record for the most rushing yards in a season when combining the regular season and the playoffs. He needs 30 yards to breakTerrell Davis’ 1998 record of 2,476. Among the stars of the defensive effort, C.J. Gardner-Johnson entered “Kobe mode” for the Eagles on the fifth anniversary of the death of his idol,Kobe Bryant. Even rookie Will Shipley got a chance to make his mark for the Birds, forcing a fumble and scoring hisfirst career touchdown. The Chiefs held off the Buffalo Bills in the AFC championship game as Patrick Mahomesmade the winning plays again. More coverageof the Eagles' playoff victorycan be found here. This is the way the season has been going for the injury-plagued Sixers: One night after he scored 30 points in an upset of the Cavaliers, Paul George left a win against the Bulls with an injured left little finger. George has already missed 14 games this season because of injuries. “You feel bad for him,” Tyrese Maxey said, “especially because now you think he’s finding his rhythm, kind of finding his niche where he fits in with the offense with Joe [Joel Embiid] and without Joe. And that kind of [stinks]. …Praying for him.\" If the Sixers' season goes south, there could be help on the way if they maintain the No. 6 overall pick. Two possibilities for that slot, Rutgers' Ace Bailey and Dylan Harper, played Saturdayat Madison Square Garden. The Flyers are tied for the sixth-worst goal differential in the NHL this season at minus-21. Why is that an important stat? Teams with a negative goal differential rarely make it to the postseason. Time is ticking on the Flyers if they hope to make the playoffs. Jackie Spiegel offers three things that could change the course for the Flyersthe rest of the way. For the third year in a row, the Phillies’ fortunes will rest squarely with their core of Bryce Harper, Trea Turner, Zack Wheeler, Aaron Nola, J.T. Realmuto, Kyle Schwarber, and Nick Castellanos. But if they hope to keep pace with the Dodgers long-term, they must bring supporting actors like Bryson Stott and Orion Kerkering into more prominent roles.Scott Lauber explains why. Penn State moved quickly in filling its vacancy at defensive coordinator and plucked a coach from a Big Ten rival in the process. According to several reports, the Nittany Lions are hiring Jim Knowles, Ohio State’s defensive coordinator. A St. Joseph’s Prep alumnus, Knowles reportedly will become the highest-paid coordinatorin college football history.

        "source": "https://www.inquirer.com/",
        "content": "Wentz, who was the Eagles’ starting quarterback for five seasons, says his time in Philly \"feels like five, six lifetimes ago.\" KANSAS CITY, Mo. — Carson Wentz was 1,122 miles from the stadium where his NFL career began in 2016 and 1,512 days removed from making his last NFL start in an Eagles uniform. He posed for pictures alongside Patrick Mahomes and his other Chiefs teammates inside the Kansas City Chiefs’ locker room at Arrowhead Stadium just after 9:30 p.m. local time Sunday. This time of year, seven years ago, he was preparing to watch Nick Foles lead theEaglesto aSuper Bowlvictory over the New England Patriots while he was sidelined with a torn ACL in his left knee. The years between Super Bowl appearances for Wentz have been anything but a clear path. From a sour ending in Philly in 2020 to one-year stints with the Indianapolis Colts in 2021 and Washington Commanders in 2022 to backing up Matthew Stafford last season with the Los Angeles Rams, Wentz’s career trajectory looks much different from the expectations set for him in his MVP-caliber 2017 season. But as he beamed with joy in a cigar-stenched  locker room on the verge of a chance at a first-ever three-peat, Wentz had plenty of perspective on what the moment meant for him. » READ MORE:The Eagles preach and practice attacking the football on defense. Facing the Commanders, it was easy to see why. “It’s been a journey,” Wentz told The Inquirer as music blasted in a celebratory locker room after theChiefs’ 32-29 victory over the Buffalo Billsin the AFC championship game. “Every day, or every year, has been something different so far, but I’m just along for the ride, and God’s been good, just continuing to open doors. [I’m] still playing the game I love, and it might look different, but [I’m] still having fun.” Here was Wentz, now the Chiefs backup quarterback, with just two starts over the last two years in inconsequential regular-season finales, basking in the midst of another special run for a Kansas City squad that has become accustomed to this spot. As players began filing into the locker room after the field celebration, Wentz was one of the last players to join his teammates there, soaking in the moment with his wife, Madison Oberg, and their three daughters. The 32-year-old admitted that his family has “been along for quite the journey last couple years, too,” but added that seeing his wife and girls celebrate the win is “so fun to see them just light up and come to support me, support their team.” » READ MORE:Jeff McLane: ‘He’s a warrior’: Cam Jurgens plays through injury in Eagles’ NFC title win, gets Jason Kelce’s seal of approval Wentz has backed up two Super Bowl-winning quarterbacks in consecutive years, sitting behind Stafford last season and Mahomes this year. Wentz says he has relished watching two of the best quarterbacks in the game operate and has picked up things from each “that I can implement [to my own game].” “Whether it’s just their preparation or play, though they play completely different,” Wentz said, “they’re both just the ultimate competitors. Being able to back them up and learn from them, and just be a part of the culture that they’re instilling in their respective organizations has been fun to be a part of it.” The feeling is mutual for Mahomes, who took some time postgame to praise Wentz’s work ethic and how early he arrives at the facility. “Carson is extremely intelligent,” Mahomes said. “You see why he has the talent, you see why he was a starting quarterback in this league, an MVP-level quarterback in this league, and so excited for him. I know he got the Super Bowl when he was in Philly, but be able to go up against the Eagles again … it’ll be a great moment to be able to go up and do that and try to do whatever we can to find a way to get a win.” » READ MORE:Eagles fans climb poles, party in the streets, and celebrate another trip to the Super Bowl Wentz and the Chiefs, led by former Eagles coach Andy Reid, will have arematch with the Eaglesin Super Bowl LIX. On top of Reid facing his old team for the second time in three seasons, Wentz will get a chance to face the team that drafted him second overall nine years ago, although he’ll be watching from the sideline again on the big stage. In evaluating his options this offseason, Wentz knew he wanted to be a part of the “winning culture” Reid has created with the Chiefs, winners of three Super Bowls over the last five years. He signed with the Chiefs on April 1 last year. Out of all the things he has experienced this season, from getting to start in the Chiefs’ Week 18 loss to the Denver Broncos to Sunday night’s thrilling win, Wentz says his favorite part of the season is “cherishing those memories [in the locker room], cherishing your time that you have with the guys.” » READ MORE:Mike Sielski: The Eagles are underdogs no more “Coach Reid definitely was a big part [of me coming here], just being a part of what he’s been building here, and has built here,” Wentz said. “Just learning from him, and the intricate offense and just the creativity that they’ve been instilling, and just his coaching style and the full-fledged respect that he has from everybody in the building, it’s been really fun, and it’s definitely been special for me this year.” Wentz says the Feb. 9 matchup between the Eagles and Chiefs is ”just another ballgame,” noting that he has already started against the Eagles, in 2022 as the Commanders’ quarterback. And although the game won’t entail Wentz andJalen Hurtsfacing off head-to-head in two weeks, the predecessor vs. the successor, Wentz is preparing in case his number is called at Caesars Superdome for all the marbles. And as for his time in Philly? “That feels like five, six lifetimes ago at this point,” Wentz said with a smile, but added, “but I’m grateful for my time there, without a doubt, and it’ll be a fun one in two weeks.”",

Eventually, police lines moved in and cleared the crowd for the cleanup and to make way for the morning rush. Every inch of Broad Street by City Hall in Center City Philadelphia was covered with Eagles fans just moments after the final seconds ticked away. \"The game was awesome - it was over in the second half,\" said Walt Johnson of Overbrook.  \"I know the defense stepped up and that's all we had to do because the offense speaks for itself!\" WATCH: 'Why do we hunt?'

More crowds gathered in the northeast, at the intersection of Frankford and Cottman avenues. You can watch live coverage from SKYFOX in the video player above. What we know: Eagles fans were spotted celebrating in the streets of Philly the only way they know how. Philadelphia city officials detailed safety precautions, road closures and more preparations, including info on pole greasing. When asked directly if the greasing would take place, Managing Director Adam Thiel issued a brief warning to potential pole climbers. \"Don’t climb the poles, greased or not greased, please don’t climb the poles, because you could break the poles and that’s expensive, and it’s money we could spend on other things.\" Eagles fans are already climbing poles as they celebrate the Birds' victory against the Washington Commanders.

Well, one fan decided to recreate the moment by climbing on a pole and catching up on his own copy of the book. Many Eagles fans took to the streets of Philadelphia to celebrate the Birds' win against the Washington Commanders. One fan even took to a pole to pay homage to A.J. Brown and his reading of the book, 'Inner Excellence.' An Eagles fan is throwing out some money to celebrate the Eagles heading to the Super Bowl. The backstory: The Eagles offense got off to a hot start after holding the Commanders to just a field goal on their opening drive. On their first play from scrimmage, running back Saqon Barkley broke through the line of scrimmage and then the secondary to take a pitch 60 yards for the touchdown. The Eagles forced and recovered two fumbles in the first half and turned both into touchdowns - including a second Barkley touchdown run from the 4 yard line and a touchdown pass to AJ Brown late in the second quarter. The Commanders lone first-half touchdown came when quarterback Jayden Daniels dropped a short pass over the middle to Terry McLaurin who took it 36 yards to the end zone. Both teams came out slower in the second half, as both were forced to punt on their first possessions. The Eagles, however, got the scoring restarted on their second possession when Hurts scrambled for his second rushing touchdown of the game. The Commanders responded quickly with an 8-play drive capped off by a Jayden Daniels run up the middle for a 10-yard touchdown. The Commanders then covered on a two-point conversion to make it a two-score game. After forcing the Eagles to punt on the ensuing drive, the Commanders squandered a chance to close in on the Eagles when Eagles linebacker Oren Burks forced Commanders running back Austin Ekeler to fumble the ball and Burks; fellow linebacker Zach Baun recover at midfield. The Eagles again took a turnover and turned it into points with a comical series of penalties on tush push attempts at the goal line. After a Washington turnover on downs, the Eagles were able to drive 31 more yards, finishing off the drive with a 4-yard Saquon Barkley touchdown run. By the numbers: Saquon Barkley finished the game with 118 yards on 15 carries and 3 touchdowns. The Eagles passing offense also came to life as Hurts finished the game 20 of 28 with 246 yards and a touchdown. Hurts also accounted for three rushing touchdowns of his own. AJ Brown led all Eagles receivers with 96 yards on 6 receptions, including a touchdown. Goedert had seven catches for 85 yards. The Eagles defense forced two fumbles, while the Eagles special teams forced a third. The Eagles will take on the Chiefs in a rematch for Super Bowl LIX in New Orleans.

(Photo by GREG BAKER/AFP via Getty Images) A Chinese AI startup is gaining popularity, amassing tons of downloads shortly after the app’s debut. The backstory: DeepSeek is a Chinese AI startup that was founded in 2023 by Liang Wenfeng, the chief of AI-driven quant hedge fund High-Flyer. The app is different from other chatbots, including OpenAI’s ChatGPT because DeepSeek can explain its reasoning before delivering a response to a prompt. The company debuted R1, a specialized model designed for complex problem-solving, on Jan. 20, and was built quickly, with fewer, less powerful AI chips, at a lower cost than other U.S. models, FOX Business reported, citingthe Wall Street Journal. RELATED:ChatGPT outperformed doctors in diagnostic accuracy, study reveals Bloomberg reported that the company’s R1 release offers performance on par with OpenAI’s latest and has granted license for people interested in creating chatbots using the technology to build on it. DeepSeek’s app grew in popularity and has been downloaded in global app stores 1.6 million times by Jan. 25 in the U.S. The app ranks first in iPhone app stores in Australia, Canada, China, Singapore, the U.S. and the U.K.FOX Businessnoted that unlike ChatGPT and other major AI competitors, DeepSeek is open-source, meaning developers can offer their own improvements on the software. RELATED:Elon Musk debuts 'Grok' AI bot to rival ChatGPT What they're saying: Experts told the Wall Street Journal thatDeepSeek’s technology is still behind OpenAIand Google. However, it is a close competitor despite using less-advanced chips, and isn’t using as many steps that some U.S. developers believe are vital. According to the Wall Street Journal, two models of DeepSeek were ranked in the top 10 on Chatbot Arena, a platform hosted by University of California, Berkeley researchers that rates chatbot performance. DeepSeek’s flagship model is free, but the organization charges users who connect their own applications to DeepSeek’s model and computing framework, the Wall Street Journal reported.

The recall pertains to the 8-ounce size of the Horizon Organic Aseptic Plain Whole Milk. In total, 19,688 cases have been recalled, and the recall was upgraded to Class II on Jan. 17. The best-by dates of the recalled products are between March 3 and March 7, 2025. The milk was sold in Arizona, California and Nevada. Affected products were sold under a UPC code of 3663207113 for a 12-pack container, and a single unit UPC code of 3663207127. On its website, the FDA noted that the milk is potentially susceptible to \"premature product spoilage during shelf life.\" According to the FDA's guidelines, a Class II recall refers to a \"situation in which use of, or exposure to, a violative product may cause temporary or medically reversible adverse health consequences or where the probability of serious adverse health consequences is remote.\" It is not exceedingly uncommon for food to be recalled due to spoilage issues. Earlier this month, Walmart stores recalled more than 12,000 cartons ofGreat Value brand chicken broth,citing the reason as \"potential for packaging failures that could compromise the sterility of the product, resulting in spoilage.\" \"The health and safety of our customers is always a top priority,\" a Walmart spokesperson said in a statement. \"As soon as we were made aware of the issue, we took action to remove all impacted product from the select, impacted stores. We are continuing to work with the supplier to investigate.\" FOX Business reached out to Horizon Organic for comment. FOX Business' Christine Rouselle contributed to this report.

No one knows that better than one veteran who not only watched history unfold, but documented it along the way. During his time in the Navy, veteran Richard Young worked as a dark room operator. He would help develop photos of aerial landscapes that would later be used to plan tactical conquests. In his personal time, while still with the Navy, he captured some of the most raw and powerful moments of World War II. Young served in the U.S. Navy Pacific from 1943 to 1946 in Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, and Tokyo, Japan. By using his photography, Young was able to tell the story of World War II from his perspective.

        "content": "This Eagles offense demoralizes opponents. The Commanders' will was broken. One more performance like this, and the Eagles will be world champs. Demoralizing. That’s how it feels to play against this Eagles offense. Really, there is no other way it can feel. Snap after snap. Run after run after slant after run. Nothing there? Throw it away and live to see another down. Then run it some more. Four, 5, 60 yards at a time. All of them bruising. All of them gained with the understanding that they will continue gaining more until there is none left to gain. The Eagles may not have the most electric offense in modern NFL history. But it is the most inevitable. They beat you up until you break, assuming you do not break right away. “You can always tell when a team is about to give up,” Mekhi Becton said with a glimmer in his eye that matched the one that sparkled off the diamond chain hanging from his neck. » READ MORE:SIELSKI: The Eagles are underdogs no more: Like Doug Pederson said, it’s the norm for them to reach the Super Bowl The Eagles guard was thinking about a specific moment as he said this. Standing at his locker in the wake of the Eagles’55-23 thumping of the Commandersin the NFC championship, Becton smiled devilishly as he thought back on the sequence that served to confirm that their Super Bowl berth was booked. Early fourth quarter, first-and-goal at the Washington 1-yard line, the Commanders clinging to an 11-point deficit that, in a vacuum, looked somewhat tenuous. As the Eagles took their familiar places at the line of scrimmage —Jalen Hurtstight under center, everyone else tight to him — they looked across the neutral zone and knew that it was over. What happened next only served as confirmation. The first offside call was innocent enough. Then came the second, Washington linebacker Frankie Luvu flying Mortal Kombat style over the offensive line, crashing to the ground in the offensive backfield with the ball still unsnapped. After the third offside penalty, referee Shawn Hochuli announced that any future Commanders offside penalty would be accompanied by a 15-yard unsportsmanlike conduct penalty. After the fourth infraction was indeed committed, Hochuli updated his executive order, announcing that the Commanders had been advised that the officiating crew could and would elect to award the Eagles a touchdown if the offside-ing continued. “Simply put, a team can’t commit multiple fouls in an effort to prevent the score,” Hochuli told a pool reporter later. “Again, if it’s meant to prevent a score, we can essentially award the score.” Either way, it wouldn’t have mattered. The Commanders were beaten. Hurts plunged over the goal line, the Eagles took a 41-23 lead, and the fourth quarter became a victory lap. “That was mental warfare,” Eagles tackleJordan Mailatasaid. “That’s all that was. Mental warfare.” This is more than a Super Bowl-caliber offense. It is a will-breaker. You see the effects of it all over the field. You saw it on Sunday. The two unsportsmanlike conduct penalties in the red zone, one of them a late hit out of bounds onSaquon Barkleythat extended a touchdown drive that should have ended in a field-goal attempt. The three forced fumbles and Eagles recoveries, giving them six on the postseason, part of a ridiculous plus-10 takeaway margin that alone would be enough to get most teams to the Super Bowl. That absurd goal-line sequence early in the fourth quarter when the Commanders committed four offside penalties. Bad things tend to happen to teams that feel they need to give more than they’ve got. As usual, it was Saquon Barkley and the offensive line setting the tone. First play of the game. Six other times you had seen it this season. Here it was again. Barkley gathered the ball, bounced a few defenders out of his way, and set his sights on the goal line 60 yards in the distance. It is a presumptuous thing, to be thinking end zone on the dark side of the 50-yard line. Yet, here again, his head was in the right place. » READ MORE:‘Now we see’: There’s no stopping Saquon Barkley as he’s about to take his record-setting show to New Orleans It is getting to a point where you see it before he does: the scattered bodies, the over-pursuit, and then the seam. That is what you saw the first time Barkley touched the ball in his first NFC championship game: daylight. “He has tremendous balance when he gets hit,” Mailata said. “Contact balance, I don’t even know if that’s a thing. I wish we had a camera in our helmet so you guys could see that. It’s a truly special view.” There was no looking back. Not while Barkley was running, and certainly not after he’d crossed the goal line to give the Eagles a lead they’d never relinquish. A Super Bowl berth that many suspected was a formality quickly revealed itself to be so. Barkley would finish with 15 carries for 118 yards and three touchdowns, the last of them coming on an easy 4-yard scamper with 7 minutes, 58 seconds  left that gave the Eagles a 48-23 lead. It was Barkley’s fifth straight game with at least 118 yards, including 119  in the playoff opener against the Green Bay Packers and 205  in last week’s divisional-round win over the Los Angeles Rams. He now has seven runs of 60-plus yards this season. The rest of the NFL has combined for 14. No other running back has more than two. This is exactly whatHowie Roseman,Jeffrey Lurie, andNick Siriannienvisioned when they made Barkley their free-agent priority this past offseason. Never in the history of the NFL has a move that raised so many eyebrows at the outset looked so obvious in hindsight. You pair the hardest-running back in the league with its hardest-blocking offensive line and, once you do, you can throw your pass-first paradigm out the window. It is almost unfair that the Eagles complement Barkley and their running game with a couple of wide receivers who cannot be single-covered and a quarterback who must be accounted for at all times. On Sunday, the frustration set in early for the Commanders. They are an impressive team. They played hard. They played fast. They would have had a shot if they’d played perfectly. But they didn’t, which is the way it usually turns when perfection feels like a necessity. » READ MORE:Grading the Eagles: The offense takes flight in every way, and the defense finds the football After the Commanders cut the Eagles’ lead to 14-12 on a 36-yard touchdown catch-and-run by Terry McLaurin, they had the choice between kicking the extra point or attempting to tie the game with a two-point conversion. There is a strain of coaching logic that deems it unwise to chase points in the first half: If the two-point conversion fails, your opponent needs only a touchdown and PAT to make it a two-possession game. It is a sensible school of thought, and maybe the Commanders would have deemed it applicable had they been playing a typical NFL offense. But the Eagles are an offense that can seemingly gain 2 yards at will. So even if Washington had kicked the PAT to make it 14-13, there was a decent chance the Eagles would simply go for two after their next touchdown, making it a two-score game. Might as well go for the tie, right? These are the subtle ways the Eagles’ might manifests itself even when Barkley isn’t actively manifesting himself. As it turns out, the Eagles out-thought themselves and went for two anyway after their next touchdown. And, as it turns out, the Commanders stopped them. Sort out the logic as you wish. The point stands: The Eagles chew up real estate both in between the lines and in between the ears. It is, as Mailata said, mental warfare. One more game of it, and they will be world champs.",

When Sanziana Penafiel, 24, and Mark Washington, 26, decided to buy their first house, they heard a lot of discouraging messages. The market is very tough right now. It’s gonna be a brutal process. You’re gonna overpay. They jumped into the market anyway. And they saw for themselves that in the South Jersey neighborhoods where they wanted to live,competition for homes was fierce. “It was incredibly overwhelming,” Penafiel told me. For example, the couple toured a house in Florence Township, and “as soon as we decided, ‘Let’s go for it,’ it was already off the market,” she said. That level of competition is why Zillow is predicting that the broader Philly metro area is going to be one to watch this year. We’re a popular place, and we have a housing supply problem. Keep reading to see where the Philly metro ranks on Zillow’s list of hottest markets for 2025 and learn what other metros are doingthat we aren’t. For $20 million, the Philadelphia Housing Authority just bought two student housing buildings in University City that it plans to turn into subsidized housing. You can expect more where that came from soon. PHA plans to acquire 2,000 units of housing from the private sector. And the housing authority will be going after buildings in desirable neighborhoods, or “properties in communities that have long denied PHA residents,” Kelvin Jeremiah, the housing authority’s CEO, told my colleague. Buying private buildings is cheaper and allows tenants to move in faster than if PHA built new. PHA’s moves are part of a broader strategy that includes a mix of: buying and converting privately owned buildings fixing its own older buildings building new homes Keep reading to find out why Philly landlords are asking the city’s housing authority to buy their buildings and how much PHA plans to spendpurchasing properties in the coming months.

Thanks for sharing your ideas and adding to the conversation. The Inquirer’s Opinion Desk also collected thoughts from 12 Philadelphians aboutwhat they think the city should do. Below are thoughts from some of my newsletter readers. Robert L: “I initially was in favor of the arena but after thinking about how many days per year it would be dark, I realized it wasn’t going to ‘activate’ Market East like some thought. The best way to activate Market East is mixed use withlots of residential condos/apartmentsto keep the area activated each and every day and evening too — which will also lower crime in the area.” He sang the praises ofthe East Market development. Elizabeth A.: “Hands down — something like what Comcast proposed at the 11th hour —a biotech hub. The West bank of the Schuylkill has boomed with development. With proper strategic planning (something I am sorry to say is totally lacking from the current administration), revitalization would see hotels, restaurants, cafés, retail, etc. AND Jefferson station transportation hub is in the middle. A no brainer.” Chris D.: “I disliked the prospects of a mammoth basketball arena on East Market Street, so I am glad that the arena has been canceled. On the other hand, I do think there is a place for sports on East Market Street. A place for 2,000 to 4,000 fans to gather to watch games on very large screens. I am envisioningsomething like Xfinity Live. A place where people can take the subway to watch Philly teams playing away games with fans from across the region.” Marcia W.: “Market Street East can rival the best boulevards and walking streets of Europe.A combination of fooderies, shops, musical venues, and street artistswould welcome people. The Pennsylvania Horticulture Society would advise on colorful low maintenance plants.” She acknowledged that the city would need to improve traffic, sanitation, and safety. There you have it. We’ll be watching Market East closely to see whether any of your ideas become reality. Enjoy the rest of your week.

        "content": "PHILADELPHIA (WPVI) --Contemporary artists shine inThe Time Is Always Now: Artists Reframe the Black Figure. Artist Thomas J. Price has a work on view called As Sound Turned to Noise, which is made of bronze and stands nine feet tall. \"There are 28 Black and African diasporic artists, primarily based within the United States and United Kingdom,\" says Yocari De Los Santos, Constance E. Clayton Curatorial Fellow with the Philadelphia Museum of Art. \"A lot of the works actually on display are relatively new, made within the 21st century.\" Six of those artists, showcasing 22 of their works, were added to the stateside premiere in Philadelphia. \"It was originally conceived by the British writer and curator Ekow Eshun for the National Portrait Gallery in London,\" says De Los Santos. Now, there are about 65 works in all on view. De Los Santos says artists are looking at the Black figure through different perspectives and mediums. Njideka Akunyili Crosby has a painting on display titled, Still You Bloom in the Land of No Gardens, which features the artist, herself, with her child. The expansive exhibition covers three themes. The first is 'Double Consciousness'. \"'Double Consciousness' is a word coined by W. E. B. Du Bois in 1897,\" says De Los Santos. \"A lot of the artists in this section, they both confront the white gaze, but look beyond it.\" Artists in this section include Amy Sherald and Kerry James Marshall, just to name a few. The 'Past and Presence' theme explores history. \"Up until the 20th century, largely white artists, white perspective, dominated how the figure was portrayed,\" says De Los Santos. Philadelphia-based artist, Roberto Lugo is featured in this section, reframing the work, Madonna and Child. Lugo's work is titled Maribel and Child, named and modeled after his mother. \"What artists do in this section is they kind of confront that history, so you have some artists looking at 17th and 18th century paintings,\" says De Los Santos. The third theme is 'Our Aliveness'. \"Artists, literally, describing the Black in every day,\" says De Los Santos. She says the artists capture the \"richness and complexity of Black life.\" \"Behind the backdrop and the context that sometimes within, whenever Black presence is visible, with either in private or in public places, can sometimes face animosity or even violence,\" says De Los Santos. The tour ends in the reflection and response room. \"I invite people to come into the show,\" says De Los Santos. \"And look through the lens of these artists.\" The Time Is Always Now: Artists Reframe the Black Figure is on view through February 9 at the Philadelphia Museum of Art.

        "content": "The Eagles forced four turnovers, including three “Peanut Punch” fumbles in their NFC title game win. Zack Baun was still hooked up to the oxygen machine, catching his breath after the Washington Commanders’ eight-minute, 18-play opening drive, whenSaquon Barkleyhappened. The star running back ripped off a 60-yard rushing touchdown on the Eagles’ first offensive play of the game Sunday, putting the Eagles up 7-3 and forcing Baun back into action moments after his backside touched the bench. Oxygen mask off, helmet on. “When it’s time to go, it’s time to go,” Baun explained. If Baun felt depleted on that next series, it didn’t show. On the fourth play of the drive, the All-Pro inside linebacker forced the first of three Commanders fumbles to help the Eagles win the turnover battle intheir 55-23 rompin the NFC championship game. Baun did his best impression of former Bears defensive back Charles Tillman on Commanders receiver Dyami Brown, popping the ball loose with his fist. » READ MORE:‘Now we see’: There’s no stopping Saquon Barkley as he’s about to take his record-setting show to New Orleans Reed Blankenship fell on the loose football at the Commanders’ 48-yard line, bringing the offense back on the field and setting up Barkley’s second rushing touchdown. Baun is noWayneGretzky, but like the hockey legend, he expressed an understanding that a player misses 100% of the shots he doesn’t take, both on net and at the football. “Just punching at the ball and shots on goal,” Baun said. “You can’t score unless you shoot. It’s got to be on your mind. That’s the hard part. You’re just thinking, ‘Get this guy to the ground,’ and then you implement trying to punch, it’s a whole different game.” Knocking the ball loose was on the Eagles’ minds all night long, both on defense and on special teams. Late in the second quarter, on the kickoff followingJalen Hurts’ first Tush Push touchdown, Will Shipley forced a fumble on Commanders return man Jeremy McNichols. The rookie running back was left unblocked by Commanders safety Percy Butler off the line, then evaded a block from the off-returner Luke McCaffrey before striking McNichols. Kenneth Gainwell fell on the ball at the Commanders’ 24, setting up a quick scoring drive in which Hurts connected withA.J. Brownon a 4-yard touchdown pass to put the Eagles up, 27-12. Shipley, the Eagles’ fourth-round pick out of Clemson, is a running back by trade. He hasn’t been asked to do much tackling or hitting throughout his career. Still, Shipley said that the takeaway circuit that the Eagles have started practice with every Thursday has made swatting at the ball a habit for defensive players and special-teamers alike. One stop of the circuit in particular, a shock-and-shed drill run by inside linebackers coach Bobby King that involves punching out a ball from a dummy has been illuminating for Shipley. “That’s one that’s really helped me, just ‘cause I haven’t played defense,” Shipley said. “So being able to use my hands, shed somebody, and go for that ball, I feel like that’s kind of exactly what happened tonight.” The second half brought more takeaways for the Eagles. Late in the third quarter, with the Commanders down two scores, Oren Burks punched the ball out of Commanders running back Austin Ekeler’s grasp following a reception.Jalen Carterattempted to corral the ball, but it slipped out of his hands. Baun came to the rescue, falling on the loose football just a moment before Commanders center Tyler Biadasz, his former Wisconsin teammate, tried to do the same. Hurts scored yet another Tush Push touchdown on the ensuing possession to put the Eagles up, 41-23. » READ MORE:Grading the Eagles: The offense takes flight in every way, and the defense finds the football Burks, the 29-year-old inside linebacker, has stepped up as the starter alongside Baun since Nakobe Dean went down in the wild-card round against the Green Bay Packers after suffering a torn patellar tendon in his knee. Baun credited Burks with bringing the takeaway mindset to Philadelphia after spending the previous two seasons with the San Francisco 49ers and learning under four-time All-Pro inside linebacker Fred Warner. In his last three postseason games, Burks has forced two fumbles, including one against the Packers on special teams. While Burks has primarily served as a special-teams ace throughout his seven-year NFL career, he said he never lost confidence in his ability to contribute on defense. “Just staying the course,” Burks said. “Just working. Knowing that you can add value in some way. You never know what that’s going to look like.” In addition to the Eagles’ three forced fumbles,Quinyon Mitchellpicked off Commanders quarterback Jayden Daniels late in the fourth quarter. All four of the Eagles’ takeaways resulted in touchdowns. Shipley creditedNick Siriannifor renewing the team’s emphasis on takeaways after the bye week for their resurgence in that category. In Weeks 1-4, the Eagles had forced just two turnovers, both of which were interceptions. Plus, the Eagles had coughed up the ball on eight occasions for a differential of minus-6. » READ MORE:Unheralded Eagles rookie Will Shipley makes a ‘difference’ with forced fumble and first career TD Since then, including the postseason, the Eagles have come up with 34 takeaways while turning the ball over just seven times. Ten of those takeaways have occurred in the playoffs alone. When the final whistle blew and midnight green and white confetti showered Lincoln Financial Field, Baun got a chance to catch his breath. He carried his son, Elian, in the crook of his arm as he celebrated the Eagles’ impending trip toSuper BowlLIX in New Orleans, the city where he spent the first four years of his NFL career. “This is crazy,” Baun said. “This is wild. We work really hard at this. And we work hard all year. “But at the same time, it feels like we’re supposed to be here. With the work we put in. The guys we have. The coaching staff we have. Just feels like we were supposed to do this.”",

New Union managerBradley Carnellhas seen plenty over his career in professional soccer: He’s coaching in MLS, played in Germany, and has done both in his native South Africa. He knows what it takes to rise to the sport’s pinnacle, having played for his country at the 2002World Cup. All of that should serve Carnell well ashe settles into this job. They could even serve as fuel for motivational speeches in the locker room. But that’s not how he approaches being a manager. “I don’t care about where I’ve been and what I’ve done,” Carnell told The Inquirer. “I’ve never been a show-and-tell guy. I’ve never said once with my team, ‘Oh, when I played in the World Cup …’” This is not because of how few Union players were alive when the 48-year-old stood onsoccer’s biggest stage. If you tell a player you competed in a World Cup, they’ll listen, no matter their age — even someone as young as 15-year-oldCavan Sullivan. No, it’s just how Carnell is as a person. “For me, to coach players to get to those moments, that makes it rewarding,” he said. “It’s got nothing to do with me. I have aspirations as a coach, but they are far less than, for me, getting development out of this roster and letting those guys achieve their dreams — or represent their country or go play abroad, if their dreams so desire.” » READ MORE:Cavan Sullivan is the Union’s biggest story this year, whether that’s fair or not If you’re the type who judges coaches based on how they talk (not that this alone leads to wins and losses), you won’t findCharlie Manuel’s folksiness,Nick Sirianni’s metaphors,or Buddy Ryan’s bombast.

That confidence is why he debuted as a professional player at age 16, moved to Germany at 21, andspent a dozen years there.Along the way, he earned 40 national team caps. And though Carnell wasn’t as famous as some teammates — Quinton Fortune played for Manchester United, Lucas Radebe for Leeds, and Benni McCarthy in Spain and Portugal — he played every minute available at that World Cup as a defender. It’s a great story to tell a Union squad full of prospects who hope to someday match what the United States did in 2002, when itreached the quarterfinalsfor the only time since 1930. Indeed, Sullivan and his colleaguesdream of more. Still, that’s not how Carnell wants to project himself. “I’m ambitious, don’t get me wrong — I’m a winner. I’m a competitor,” he said. “But, you know, I can’t tell the players what I did and how I used to do it because that means nothing in modern soccer. That bears no value for me.” It would also be sensible if Carnell felt he had something to prove to his former employers. In late 2020, he became the New York Red Bulls’ interim manager for 14 games after four years as an assistant. Chris Armas was fired in early September, the season was on the rocks, and in October Carnell’s bosses picked Gerhard Struber to take the helm, but he couldn’t travel because of pandemic-related visa delays. » READ MORE:Lionel Messi brings Union teen phenom Cavan Sullivan into his orbit, or at least Adidas does With that on top of everything else the pandemic did to sports, Carnell led the team to a 6-5-3 record and a playoff spot. However, he didn’t get to coach the playoff game because Struber’s visa got cleared in time. When he arrived, he promptly lost in the one-game first round. Carnell went back to being an assistant for the 2021 season, then was hired by St. Louis City SC in 2022 to prepare for its expansion season in 2023. The club shot out of the gates, winning the Western Conference regular-season title. Then the dream turned into a nightmare, as St. Louis was ousted by No. 8 seed (and new cross-state rival) Sporting Kansas City. St. Louis started 2024 with justtwo losses in 13 games. But seven of those games were ties, and they turned to losses starting in mid-May. Amid a nine-game winless skid and rumors of a fractured locker room, Carnell was fired at the end of June. Various sources in New York and St. Louis painted a similar big picture: Carnell can coach, he’s a nice guy, and maybe Philadelphia will be where it goes right for him — especially with a young Union team that likely won’t be a contender. So does Carnell feel he has a chip on his shoulder? “There’s always avenues, and channels, and excuses, and if, coulda, woulda, shoulda,” he said. “I’m not that type of person. I’m a guy who doesn’t dwell in the past, and I really don’t talk much about what was. I always like to know what is about now, in the current moment, and to try and put that [in], and building places to take us steps forward.” » READ MORE:Ernst Tanner knows Union fans are frustrated, and promises improvement this year That doesn’t mean he’s forgotten, though. “I look at these as building blocks,” he said, “shaping me and forging me into a manager.” When Union sporting director Ernst Tanner called Carnell to inquire about his availability, it was far from the first time they’d talked. Tanner was part of Red Bull’s global soccer organization when Carnell arrived in New York in early 2017 from South Africa’s Orlando Pirates. They struck up conversations and kept them going over the years. “He knows about me, I know about Ernst, and I know where he comes from,” Carnell said. “When Ernst called and said if we could explore this possibility, then we then we got to work.” Soon enough, Carnell was invited to meet with the men atop the Union’s ownership group: Jay Sugarman, Richard Leibovitch, and academy bankroller Richie Graham. They sealed the deal, making Carnell the fourth manager in the Union’s 16-year history. “Chatting with these guys, how I worked fitted hand in hand with how upper management and ownership would like to take this mission and this project forward,” he said. “I feel I’m pretty well-versed in the expectations of developing the club as a whole, not just this first team. Which made it really exciting, to have a signature to go back to, what the club feels that they need to value.” » READ MORE:After Jack McGlynn’s star turn with the U.S. national team, where does he fit with the Union? How does Carnell want to do this job? He knows that while this roster is young, he has joined a team whose way of doing things was set before his arrival. “The club has their game model, I have my game model, the players have their tendencies, plus some synchronization built in from seasons prior,” he said. “And now, how can we merge into one big success? So, how much do I give a little bit? How much do I take a little bit? How much does a club demand a little bit? And how much are the players willing to give?” Carnell has a history of giving young players chances: Tyler Adams and Caden Clark in New York, Miguel Perez and Caden Glover in St. Louis. He knows that’s the biggest reason why he was brought here, with Sullivan, CJ Olney, Neil Pierre, and others on the cusp of breakthroughs. But he will listen to the club’s veterans, especiallyAlejandro Bedoya. The Union’s longtime captain knows his playing days are nearing their end, but Carnell was pleased when Bedoya approached him to offer whatever he can. “We had open conversations, and he was like, ‘Coach, I’m here for anything you need, for me to drive messages — I’m part of you,’” Carnell said. “To have that assurance, and to have that drive from a guy like Ale, a legend at the club … these are the messages I want to hear from the older senior players: that they’re ready to take on the challenge, and almost reinvent themselves, and to have this growth mindset and to be open to new messages and to even then develop themselves further.” » READ MORE:Ventnor City native B.J. Callaghan is ready for his first full year as a MLS manager It would be a challenge for anyone to inheritJim Curtin’s seat. His combination of coaching acumen, local roots, and personal charm are just about impossible to match — and his longevity probably will be, too. The odds are slim that anyone will ever coach405 games over 11 seasonswith the Union again, because that’s how the world works. Curtin also became soccer’s unofficial ambassador around town, from his kids’ youth games to sports talk radio (on the rare occasions when it mentions soccer) to international visitors. If someone wanted to talk with him about the Eagles for five minutes and then soccer for 30 seconds, he’d oblige. If someone wanted his opinion on a big European club or the U.S. women’s team coming to town, he’d have something to say and want to say it. That stuff didn’t come with Carnell’s job description, and it didn’t have to. There’s nothing out of the ordinary about a sports team hiring a coach simply to coach. But while he isn’t a from the area orVillanovaalumnus, he wants to put some roots down here. He, his wife, Claudia, and daughters Caitlyn (age 20, and at the University of Kansas) and Kiera (age 16) recently got green cards. “We’ve committed as a family to America,” Carnell said, “and really shown commitment to be here for the long haul.” » READ MORE:Gregg Berhalter draws cheers from his fellow coaches as he begins his tenure with the Chicago Fire In North Jersey, he made connections that he still has today. In St. Louis, he embraced the soccer history of a city — one with more than any other in America. He knows six of its sons played onthe legendary 1950 U.S. World Cup team(with Philadelphia legends Walter Bahr and Ed McIlvenney), and some of their families still live there. Now Carnell will have the most prominent soccer job in America’s birthplace when the Club World Cup comes to town this summer and likely when the biggest World Cup of all arrives next year. His first job is to win games, and his second is to develop the Union’s young corps so it can reach its great potential. That’s what he’ll be known for more than anything else — and he doesn’t have much time to prepare for a season that starts next month. But in a city where soccer constantly fights for scraps of attention, the other stuff might help. Especially knowing how beloved Curtin was, and still is, by many fans. “I might be a foreign coach, or I might be foreign to the town,” he said, “but that doesn’t change my mindset of serving and representing these fans, [the] community, people, with the utmost respect and the attention this whole product and this whole city deserve. It’s just part of who I am. … I don’t need to be ‘local’ to be local.”",

Most refunds are issued in less than 21 days, but the IRS advises taxpayers not to depend on the refund for major purchases or bills. Filing electronically and selecting direct deposit remains the fastest and safest way for taxpayers to receive their 2024 tax refunds, according to the IRS. Taxpayers can check a refund's status by using the Where's My Refund? Tool online. Timeline: The last day you can file your 2024 taxes without requesting an extension is Tuesday, April 15, 2025.

        "title": "Kenyatta Johnson had a turbulent year as Philly’s top lawmaker, from school board spats to the Sixers arena fiasco",
        "source": "https://www.inquirer.com/",
        "content": "Johnson enters his second year in office bruised by the Sixers debacle but in firm control of the chamber, enjoying support from the vast majority of his colleagues. It was the mayor who broke the news about the Sixers arena. Over the phone on a frigid January weekend, City Council PresidentKenyatta Johnsonlearned thatthe $1.3 billion deal he had spent muchof his first year shepherding as the city’s top legislative leader had imploded. The victory he and MayorCherelle L. Parkercelebrated just weeks earlier was now kaput. The basketball team — unbeknownst to city lawmakers — abandoned its long-fought planto build an  arena in Center City,instead opting to stay in South Philly, leaving Philadelphia’s top officials looking flat-footed and Council members outraged. Johnson reflected on that moment recently in his City Hall office, taking a sip of tea. He leaned back in his chair and grinned. “My initial reaction when I heard it was, ‘We put a lot of time, work, and effort in this process,’” he said. “And I wanted to know, how do we move forward?” His recollection was classically Johnson: the City Council president, who is still relatively new at the job, generally keeps his moves close to the vest, avoids bombast, and almost never engages in a public takedown, even when some of his colleagues would. Through Johnson’s first year helming an at-times unruly bunch of 17 lawmakers, his leadership style has come into clearer view. In moments of controversy, he has been ultra cognizant of his image as a leader, and he’s earned goodwill — even from onetime opponents. Johnson enters his second year as Council president bruisedby the Sixers debaclebut in firm control of the chamber, enjoying support from the vast majority of his colleagues. Public criticism of his leadership has been minimal, and as Council’s top legislator, he’s mended relationships with some of his former adversaries. » READ MORE:After the Sixers arena debacle, Philly City Council is back and ready to work on anything else That wasn’t promised for Johnson, 51,a Democrat from South Philadelphia whose elevation to Council president a year ago wasthe culmination of a political comeback storythat saw him rise after beingacquitted of federal corruption charges. Two years ago, his legal troubles were the talk of the city’s political class. These days, they seem like ancient history. Still, his biggest challenges may be yet to come.He enters the yearwith his reputation hanging in the balance after spending much of the fall shepherding the controversial arena project through Council, which the Sixers then scuttled. His members’ relationship with Parker is tenuous, and if it frays, could make basic governance a painstaking process. The tests ahead are clear to Johnson. In a recent interview, he said he’s prepared to meet the moment, maintaining his even-keeled approach — with plans to be more proactive in negotiations for the new Sixers arena. “That’s when leaders lead,” he said. It was early last year, and it already felt like everything in City Hall was changing: new mayor, new Council president, and one of the greenest City Councils in recent memory after a wave of departures. Johnson was replacing Darrell L. Clarke,the outgoing president seen as an elder statesmanwho knew how the body worked because he’d spent four decades in it. Johnson, first elected in 2011, has been a member for 13 years, but had never been in leadership. A month into Johnson’s tenure as president, the one other person who knew how to run the show was gone. Michael A. Decker, Council’s chief clerk and top administrator,died unexpectedly in February.He had effectively presided over meetings and ensured rules were followed. There was no obvious successor. “Things got real,” Johnson recalled. “You’re talking about years and years and years of this institution operating that could possibly collapse if not handled correctly.” Johnson called off that week’s meeting and moved to find a replacement. Within a week, he’d convinced Elizabeth McCollum-Nazario, a former staffer who’d left Council years prior, to return to be the body’s chief clerk. Members said they were impressed by Johnson’s steady hand in taking over for Clarke. “Just look at the last year as it relates to new leadership, new staff, new everything,” said Isaiah Thomas, a Democrat who represents the city at-large. “I commend Kenyatta for what he’s done to put us in a position that we’re in now.” Though Johnson and Clarke rose out of separate political factions — Johnson started as an aide to State Sen. Anthony Hardy Williams in West Philadelphia, while Clarke was a protégé to former Mayor John F. Street in North Philly — the men are similar in temperament. Both started out as rabble-rousing activists, then evolved into Council members who consistently sought consensus with their colleagues, even on issues that proved to be political land mines. » READ MORE:From the ‘loudest mouth’ to Council president: Darrell Clarke reflects on his career in Philly politics Councilmember Jamie Gauthier, a progressive Democrat who represents West Philadelphia, said Johnson has consistently made her feel heard, including during the arena negotiations when she wanted the Sixers to pay more to offset potential displacement in nearby Chinatown. Gauthier ultimately voted against the project, but said Johnson advocated for her position through the process. “He really did create a table that was for every Council member,” she said. “I felt that he wanted us in.” Council members quickly came to trust Johnson, but his first few months weren’t without political friction. There were several public spats between Council members and Parker, the most high-profile of which was a fight over one of her nominees for the city’s school board, which are approved by Council.Several lawmakers took issue with Joyce Wilkerson,a sitting board member, and Johnson sided with his members, declining to even bring the nomination up for a vote. ButParker didn’t back down.She formally asked Wilkerson to remain on the board until she picked a replacement. Nine months later, Parker hasn’t done so. There were rumblings that Council could have sued over Wilkerson’s seating that was done without their approval. Instead, Johnson let it go. “This back-and-forth does nothing for us in terms of moving the city of Philadelphia forward,” he said. Such is the delicate balance a Council president must strike in maintaining a relationship with the mayor, a partnership this city has seen fray before. Former Mayor Michael Nutter’s standing with lawmakers deteriorated so much that, by his second term, he couldn’t get a single member to introduce a piece of signature legislationto privatize the city’s gas utility. Parker and Johnson, who came into powerat a time of great uncertainty in the city,know their political fates are inextricably tied. Neither can advance their priorities without the other. After the school board spat, Council still passed the mayor’s budget proposal,advanced funding for her priorities,andapproved the now-scrapped Center City Sixers arena dealthat she went to bat for. Johnson said he and Parker meet weekly. Joseph P. McLaughlin, an adviser in two former mayoral administrations, said that when Ed Rendell was the incoming mayor, Street was the Council president and told members, in effect: “There’s no way for us to look good unless the mayor looks good.” Street and Rendell had a famously productive working relationship. “I think Kenyatta is recognizing that, especially in the first year,” McLaughlin said, “you got to support the mayor.” When Johnson was solely a district Council member, he at times earned the ire of activists who thought he stymied progress in his South and Southwest Philadelphia district. Traffic-safety groups and bicycle activists were furious in 2022 when Johnson used his powerto block traffic calming measures on Washington Avenuein his district. Last year, the city saw a spate of high-profile cyclist deaths, including that of 30-year-old Barbara Friedes, who was killed, police said, after a speeding driverstruck her while she was riding in a bike lane. City leaders were under pressure to act. Christopher Gale, executive director of the Bicycle Coalition of Greater Philadelphia, said that shortly after Friedes was killed, Johnson, as Council’s president, met with advocates and told them that he could have handled the Washington Avenue situation better. “He was like, ‘Yeah, we could be better, so let’s be better,’” Gale recalled. “He’s been very clear-eyed and has had a citywide look at how this affects not just his voters and not just his district, but the entire city. And I really appreciate that citywide view.” After the meeting, Johnsonintroduced legislation to ban driversfrom stopping in bike lanes, a key priority for advocates.Council passed it within weeks. The episode and Johnson’s response to it shows how he evolved from a district Council member — whose only job was to be responsive to constituents in his corner of the city — into a citywide leader. Last fall’s contentious arena debate was another example. Johnson set aside weeks of time to hold hearings on the Sixers’ Center City proposal, which would have resulted in the team leaving the Wells Fargo Center that sits in Johnson’s own district. He said that through the negotiation process, he wasn’t advocating for the team to stay in South Philly. “Being supportive of and voting for this project, which actually was leaving my district, was about me leading for what’s in the best interest of the city of Philadelphia as a whole,” Johnson said. The Sixers’ new plan to remain in Johnson’s district happens to work out, he said. “A win-win for everyone,” he said with a smile.",

Costco has officially confirmed a month-long rumor that the wholesale club will officially swap out Pepsi for Coca-Cola products at its food courts, prompting excitement among some of its customers. \"This summer, we will be converting our food court fountain business back over to Coca-Cola,\" Costco CEO Ron Vachris said during the company’s annual shareholders meeting on Thursday. Rumors that Costco will swap out its fountain drinks were first reported last month by Costco Insider. \"After over a decade, Costco is switching back from Pepsi toCoke productsin their stores,\" Costco Insider said in a post on Instagram. \"The change will bring Coke, Coke Zero and Diet Coke, as well as Sprite instead of Starry.\" COSTCO FOOD COURT CHATTER SUGGESTS SODA SWITCH COMING IN 2025: 'SUPER HAPPY' FILE - Customers fill cups with PepsiCo.

COSTCO GIVES UPDATE ON $1.50 HOT DOG, SODA COMBO STAPLE Last year, CFO Gary Millerchip also reassured that Costco’s hot dog prices are expected to remain the same, Fox Business reported at the time. \"I also want to confirm the $1.50 hot dog price is safe,\" Millerchip said during a quarterly earnings call last May.

        "source": "https://www.inquirer.com/",
        "content": "Since speed cameras came to Roosevelt Boulevard, speeding violations have dropped 95%, and fatal and serious injury crashes are down 21%, PennDot data show. Philadelphia will install 42 speed-enforcement cameras along U.S. Route 13, the highway designation for several dangerous city roadways, under legislation ceremonially signed Monday by MayorCherelle L. Parker. The cameras would be placed on Baltimore Avenue; Powelton Avenue; 33rd, 34th, and 38th Streets; Girard Avenue,Hunting ParkAvenue; Levick and Robbins Streets; andFrankfordAvenue. “Slowing down saves lives,” Parker said during a City Hall news conference, noting that speed is a leading cause of crashes and determines how severe they are. Route 13 would be the city’s third speed-camera corridor. Roosevelt Boulevard has had the cameras since 2000, and thePhiladelphia Parking Authority, which manages the program,plans to have 30 cameras operating along Broad Street in March. From 2019 through 2023, U.S. Route 13 saw 123 fatal and serious injury crashes, 160 crashes of all types attributed to speeding, and 258 total crashes involving pedestrians, according to analysis by the city’s Office of Transportation and Infrastructure Systems. A state law enacted in 2023 made the Roosevelt Boulevard speed cameras permanent (they had been used on a trial basis) and alsoauthorized Philadelphia to designate five more dangerous corridorsfor the technology. Cameras have reduced speeding on the Boulevard by 95%, state data show. Broad Street was chosen last year to go next as themost dangerous roadway in the city, after speeds and crashes dropped sharply on Roosevelt Boulevard. Former Republican State Rep. John Taylor of the Northeast, the author of original Roosevelt Boulevard camera bill, attended the signing. He stressed that speed cameras are not a cash grab, as did the mayor and others. “If you get onto Roosevelt Boulevard, as many of you do, you know the culture has changed,” Taylor said. “People have slowed down — and that’s all we’ve ever asked for.” Although a part of Roosevelt Boulevard is labeled U.S. 13, Parker said no additional cameras will be installed there. Tickets for violations are $100 for speeding 11 mph to 19 mph over the limit, $125 for up to 20 mph over, and $150 for 30 mph or more. No points are assessed against a driver’s license for camera-captured violations. State law requires that revenue from the enforcement pays for the operation of the cameras and funds road safety programs administered by PennDot. “We have schools right off of Frankford Avenue, and kids are traversing Frankford Avenue all day long. We owe it to them,“ said Councilmember Mike Driscoll, who sponsored the Route 13 camera bill. “We owe it to our seniors that just want to go toWawaand get a cup of coffee and not have to be in a Daytona 500,” he said.",

        "title": "Philly is one of the least affordable major metros for its renters",
        "source": "https://www.inquirer.com/",
        "content": "The typical Philadelphia-area renter would need to make almost $75,000 to afford a typical apartment for rent, according to a Redfin report comparing major metros. Housing in the Philadelphia region is often considered affordable when compared to other parts of the country. But tell that to renters who live here. The Philadelphia metropolitan area is one of theleast affordable in the country for its apartment rentersbased on their incomes, according to a report by the online real estate brokerageRedfin. Apartments for rent in the last quarter of 2024 cost a median of $1,865 per month. The annual income a household needed to comfortably afford that rent was $74,600. But last year, the typical renter household in the region made $58,970. Of the 44 major metros that Redfin analyzed, the Philly metro ranked as the ninth-least affordable for its apartment residents. » READ MORE:In 2024, homes for sale in the Philly region were more affordable than across the country as a whole. But they weren’t affordable. “It really isn’t about whether or not anyone in this country can afford to live in Philly,” said Riquan King, director of advocacy at the Philadelphia-basedTenant Union Representative Network. “It’s about whether Philadelphians can live in Philly.” And across the city, longtime residents have been priced out of their neighborhoods, because they can’t afford rents. The recentboom in apartment construction— seen nationally and in Philadelphia — is helping to tame rent growth. That, along with growing wages, will help make rents across the country more affordable this year, said Sheharyar Bokhari, a senior economist at Redfin. “The affordability gap between renting and buying is likely to widen further in 2025, ashome prices riseandmortgage rates remain high,” Bokhari said in a statement. “That means potential homebuyers — especially from younger generations — may decide to continue renting for longer, as it’s the only affordable option.” Nationwide, renters needed to make $63,680 to afford the median asking rent of $1,592 in the last quarter of 2024. That’s the lowest income needed since early 2022, according to Redfin. But the typical U.S. renter household still didn’t make enough to comfortably afford the typical rent last year. The median income for these households was $54,752 — almost $9,000 less than they need. Metro areas in Texas — Austin, Houston, and Dallas — were the most affordable areas for their apartment residents, who made more money than they needed to comfortably afford rent. Providence, R.I.; Miami; and New York were the least affordable for their renters. Redfin considered apartments affordable if households spent no more than 30% of their income on rent. King said housing is one of the many expenses that are squeezing Philadelphians, including childcare, health care, and transportation. When it comes to housing affordability, he said, “what we’re really talking about is, do you have the ability to keep a roof over your head and pay for all the other components of life?” The attorney gave the example of a Philadelphia woman who faced a judge last week after breaking a previous agreement to pay back rent to her landlord. She paid what she could but came up short because she needed to cover her son’s college registration costs. She had broken the agreement, so she lost her court case and will have to leave her home. Tenants with low and moderate incomes can’t afford extra major expenses. They also can’t afford to stay in their homes when rents go up, but they struggle with moving expenses and securing another place to live. Renters regularly come to the Tenant Union Representative Network for help because they can’t find ahome that is both big enough for their family and affordable. “Rarely do you find both,” King said. “And sometimes you don’t find either.” Nora Lichtash, executive director of the Philadelphia-based nonprofitWomen’s Community Revitalization Project, said she wasn’t surprised by the area’s rankingon Redfin’s list. “I know how bad it is, because I know how many people can’t afford rents in Philly,” she said. “When I see us compared to those other cities, it makes me even angrier.” Lichtash is a leader in an ongoing campaign by thePhiladelphia Coalition for Affordable Communities, a group of 78 organizations, to get the city tospend more of its housing funding on residents with the lowest incomes. Philadelphians' incomes haven’t kept up with rising housing costs. They’re working more than one job to try to cover expenses. And residents with disabilities don’t make enough from their benefits to afford homes, Lichtash said. » READ MORE:A community-driven initiative is asking Philly to spend more housing funds on the lowest-income households Now is the time for the city to rethink how it uses its housing funds, according to the Philadelphia Coalition for Affordable Communities. “People are really struggling,” Lichtash said.",

        "content": "Hurts had his best game of the season while newcomers Saquon Barkley, Zack Baun, and Quinyon Mitchell delivered to earn their first trips to the Super Bowl. The Eagles are once againSuper Bowl-bound. After cruising to a55-23 victoryover the Washington Commanders at Lincoln Financial Field on Sunday, the Eagles punched their ticket to the NFL’s title game for a second time in three seasons. The scoring output was the most from any team in a conference championship and allowed for plenty of celebration during and after the final whistle. Here’s what we learned: » READ MORE:‘He’s a warrior’: Cam Jurgens plays through injury in Eagles’ NFC title win, gets Jason Kelce’s seal of approval For a second time in three years, the smoke from a celebratory cigar wafted aroundJalen Hurts’ locker stall to mark a blowout win in the NFC title game. And for a second time in three years, there’s reason to believe the Eagles quarterback could reach a higher level in the season’s final game. Both Hurts and Eagles coachNick Siriannihave long insisted that the way things look for this Eagles offense comes secondary to the final score, but Sunday showcased how dangerous the group can be when it gets A-level performances from both the running and passing games simultaneously. Going 20-for-28 for 246 yards and four total touchdowns, Hurts was as sharp and efficient as he’s been all season, consistently answering the call for the offense in pivotal situations. Washington utilized a familiar plan against the Eagles, crowding the line of scrimmage to test Hurts’ ability to set protections without being certain where the rush may come from. Still, the Eagles were able to gash the Commanders in response. According to Next Gen Stats, Hurts went 18-for-20 for 216 yards when passing from the pocket and averaged 3.02 seconds to throw, a tenth of a second quicker than his regular-season average. After the game, Hurts said Sirianni let him “out of the straitjacket,” perhaps suggesting he had license to be more aggressive than he has been in previous games. Hurts declined the chance to clarify what he meant, but it’s worth noting the quarterback has often talked about his role in this season’s offense being different while alluding toSaquon Barkley’s presence and production. Hurts has also cut down significantly on his turnovers since the team’s early bye week, which sparked a shift toward utilizing Barkley, who had 118 yards and three touchdowns Sunday, more heavily. Either way, Sirianni and Hurts would be better off leaving the straitjacket out of their suitcases for the trip to New Orleans. The version of Hurts that last took the Eagles to the Super Bowl in 2022 was good enough to go throw-for-throw with Patrick Mahomes once, and the version we saw on Sunday is good enough to do it again. » READ MORE:Hayes: Jalen Hurts quiets haters and leads the Eagles back to the Super Bowl: ‘I guess he let me out of my straitjacket today’ The collection of players who joined the team since the 2022 season stood out among the Eagles celebrating in the moments after the final whistle Sunday, Barkley darted from one end of the field to the other looking for his family. Zack Baun stood among a barrage of confetti holding his son, Elian, who sported some miniature noise-proof headphones. Meanwhile,Quinyon Mitchell,Jalen Carter, Mekhi Becton, andCooper DeJeanbuzzed around near midfield, each wearing the commemorative NFC championship T-shirts for the first time. Those new faces, mixed in with the central figures from the ‘22 team now making their second trip to the NFL’s biggest stage in three years, mark the necessary evolution the Eagles required to return to such heights. An overachieving, cost-effective defense built by Eagles general managerHowie Rosemanand led by one of the league’s best coordinators inVic Fangiostands in stark contrast to last year’s group. An offense centered around Roseman’s offseason addition of Barkley doesn’t hurt, either. It’s hard to say where the Eagles would be without the contributions of Barkley, Baun, Mitchell, or the other additions from last summer, but it’s safe to assume they wouldn’t be bound for New Orleans. At first glance, there are a few reasons to believe the Eagles can avenge their Super Bowl LVII loss this time around against the Kansas City Chiefs. The Eagles defense has fared well against even elite quarterbacks under Fangio this season, with Jayden Daniels being the latest example on a list that includes Joe Burrow, Lamar Jackson, and Matthew Stafford. Mahomes is in a class of his own, especially this deep into the postseason, but the foundation is there for the Eagles defense to make things difficult for him. Just as it did against Daniels, it will start with an effective four-man rush and effective coverage behind it, especially considering that the Chiefs ranked 29th in rushing yards per attempt during the regular season (4.0 yards per carry). The chess match between Fangio and Andy Reid, two of the most experienced and respected play-callers on their respective sides of the ball, will be a fascinating one. » READ MORE:The Eagles are headed to the Super Bowl to face the Chiefs. Here’s everything you need to know. On the other side of the ball, the Eagles’ running game should be able to set the terms against a Kansas City rushing defense that has had some shaky outings recently. The Chiefs have allowed at least 147 rushing yards in each of their last four games, including 202 yards against the Pittsburgh Steelers in Week 17. If the Eagles get their explosive running game going against Kansas City, the passing game should follow against Chiefs defensive coordinator Steve Spagnuolo’s man coverage-heavy system. Mahomes can make everything else irrelevant, but the Eagles have given themselves the best chance possible with Fangio running the defense. Oren Burks, up:Burks had the unenviable task of filling in for Nakobe Dean midway through the postseason, but he has exceeded most expectations in the last two games. The veteran linebacker had nine tackles, one sack, and a forced fumble against the Commanders, showing he’s able to not only hold up in place of Dean but make an impact, as well. Will Shipley, up:Shipley’smemorable performancebegan with a forced fumble on kickoff coverage and ended with a series of fourth-quarter runs that included a 57-yarder to set up his own 2-yard touchdown a few plays later. Shipley’s forced fumble helped the Eagles rattle off 14 unanswered points just before halftime and went a long way toward tilting the game. However improbable, the rookie running back’s biggest play of the season may have been a tackle. Quinyon Mitchell, up:In his third meeting with Commanders star wideout Terry McLaurin, Mitchell turned in another rock-solid performance. According to Next Gen Stats, Mitchell was matched up with McLaurin on 36 of his 48 routes run and spent half of those snaps in press coverage. He allowed just one catch for 7 yards on four targets against McLaurin and got a fourth-quarter interception, his second pick of the playoffs, on a pass intended for the wideout, as well.",

During a 20-minute question-and-answer session with reporters aboard Air Force One on Saturday, Trump said he discussed his vision on a call earlier in the day with King Abdullah II of Jordan and would speak Sunday with President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi of Egypt.

        "content": "Share Kristi Noem was sworn in Saturday as the U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security. She shared a clip on social of the ceremony, which was held at the home of Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas. Noem was confirmed earlier Saturday. WASHINGTON-The Senate confirmed Kristi Noem as homeland security secretary on Saturday, putting the South Dakota governor in charge of a sprawling agency that is essential to national security and President Donald Trump's plans to clamp down on illegal immigration. Republicans kept the Senate working Saturday to install the latest member of Trump's national security team on a 59-34 vote. Noem was sworn in by Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas at his home later Saturday. She was to have been sworn in by Vice President JD Vance in the afternoon but that was called off when she was delayed, according to a person familiar with the events who was not authorized to discuss them and spoke on condition of anonymity. The Senate will next vote Monday evening on Scott Bessent's confirmation as treasury secretary. The backstory: Noem, a Trump ally who is in her second term as governor, received some support from Democrats on the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee when it voted 13-2 to advance her nomination earlier in the week. Republicans, who already hold the votes necessary to confirm her, have also expressed confidence in her determination to lead border security and immigration enforcement.'' RELATED:Kristi Noem faces Senate confirmation hearing Noem, who held her state's lone U.S. House seat for eight years before becoming governor in 2019, has risen in the GOP by tacking closely with Trump. At one point, she was even under consideration to be his running mate. South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem, President-elect Donald Trump’s nominee for Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, is sworn in during her confirmation hearing before the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee on Capitol Hill on Her political stock took a momentary dip, however, when she released a book last year containing an account of herkilling her hunting dog, as well as a false claim that she once met with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. What they're saying: On social media, Noem thanked Trump for \"the confidence in me to serve as Secretary of Homeland Security.\" She added, \"I will work to make America SAFE again!\" Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., said Friday, \"Fixing this crisis and restoring respect for the rule of law is one of President Trump and Republicans’ top priorities. And it’s going to require a decisive and committed leader at the Department of Homeland Security.\" \"Fixing this crisis and restoring respect for the rule of law is one of President Trump and Republicans’ top priorities,\" Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., said Friday. \"And it’s going to require a decisive and committed leader at the Department of Homeland Security. I believe Kristi has everything it takes to undertake this task.\" The other side: Still, Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York, as well as most other Democrats, voted against Noem. He pointed to \"bipartisan solutions to fix the mess at our border,\" adding that Noem \"seems headed in the wrong direction.\" Why you should care: The secretary oversees U.S. Customs and Border Protection, Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Citizenship and Immigration Services. Beyond those agencies, the department is also responsible for securing airline transportation, protecting dignitaries, responding to natural disasters and more. Trump is planning major changes to the way the department functions, including involving the military in immigration enforcement and reshaping the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Those plans could immediately put Noem in the spotlight after the new president visited recent disaster sites in North Carolina and California on Friday. Noem would be tasked with delivering on Trump's favorite issue, border security. The president's goals of deporting millions of people who entered the country illegally could put Noem, with her experience governing a rural state and growing up on a farm, in a difficult position. In South Dakota, many migrants, some in the country without permanent legal status, power the labor-heavy jobs that produce food and housing. RELATED:Kristi Noem defends killing puppy after widespread outrage from Republicans and Dems She has so far pledged to faithfully execute the president's orders and copied his talk of an \"invasion\" at the U.S. border with Mexico. Noem joined other Republican governors who sent National Guard troops to Texas to assist Operation Lone Star, which sought to discourage migrants. Her decision was especially criticized because she accepted a $1 million donation from a Tennessee billionaire to cover some of the deployment cost. Noem said she opted to send National Guard troops \"because of this invasion,\" adding that \"it is a war zone down there.\" During her Senate hearing, Noem was repeatedly asked by Democratic senators whether she would administer disaster aid to states even if Trump asked her not to. Noem avoided saying that she would defy the president, but she told lawmakers, \"I will deliver the programs according to the law and that it will be done with no political bias.\" Six people cycled through as homeland security secretary during Trump's first four years in office.

Joshua Dechant, 38, and Tracy Dechant, 42, were charged with two felony counts of Endangering the Welfare of Children and arraigned on $75k bail each. It's alleged that the Dechants subjected twin 15-year-old boys to wicked abuse, including depriving the teens of water and making them walk around naked. What we know: Prosecutors say Pennsylvania State Police were called to Divot Drive after a neighbor reported a scantly clothed 15-year-old wandering around the neighborhood. The malnourished and \"nearly naked\" teen sought help from a neighbor, who told police that once he let the teen inside he \"would not stop eating.\" It was later learned that the teen's stepfather, Joshua Dechant, forced the teen out of the house into below-freezing temperatures as a form of punishment. Investigators said the teen suffered inhumane conditions for about 20 minutes and his feet were red from having to walk barefoot through the snow. It's alleged that Joshua and Tracy Dechant, the victim's mother, inflicted wicked and humiliating forms of child abuse on the 15-year-old and his twin brother. Prosecutors say the abuse included depriving the twins of food and water, forcing them to walk around the house naked, and sleeping on the floor with one blanket. According to investigators, the teens weighed just 53 and 55 lbs at the time of the incident. A medical professional said the boys should weigh around 140 lbs. A review of the boys' medical records showed they gained only 10 lbs over the last eight years. Investigators say other children who were inside the home were taken into custody by police and will be cared for by family members. What's next: Joshua and Tray Dechant were charged with two felony counts of child abuse and remain in Lehigh County Jail under $75,000 bail. They are due back in court in February.

        "content": "Share Fitbit is recalling certain Ionic smartwatches due to a burn hazard, the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission said. Google-owned Fitbit has agreed to pay a $12.25 million civil penalty for failing to alert consumers that its Ionic smartwatches could overheat and cause burns, federal regulators said Thursday. In addition to the $12.25 million civil penalty, the settlement agreement requires Fitbit to maintain internal controls and procedures designed to ensure compliance with the Consumer Product Safety Act (CPSA), including enhancements made to its compliance program. What we know: According to the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC), the settlement resolves CPSC’s charges that Fitbit knowingly failed to immediately report to CPSC, as required by law, that its Ionic smartwatches contained a defect that \"could create a substantial product hazard and create an unreasonable risk of serious injury or death to consumers.\" The Fitbit Ionic smartwatches were recalled in March 2022. (Credit: CPSC) The Commission and Fitbit jointly announced arecall of the Ionic smartwatcheson March 2, 2022. The recall stated that the firm had received at least 115 reports in the United States of the battery in the smartwatch overheating, with 78 reports of burn injuries in the United States, including two reports of third-degree burns and four reports of second-degree burns. Learn more about the recallhere. The backstory: Between 2018 and 2020, Fitbit received numerous reports of the Ionic smartwatches overheating while being worn by consumers, causing some consumers to sustain burns, including second-degree and third-degree burns on their arms or wrists. EARLIER:Fitbit recalls over 1M Ionic smartwatches that can overheat, posing burn hazard In early 2020, Fitbit initiated a firmware update to mitigate the potential for battery overheating. However, CPSC said Fitbit continued to receive reports of consumers suffering burns due to the product overheating. What they're saying: \"Despite possessing information that reasonably supported the conclusion that the smartwatches contained a defect that could create a substantial product hazard or created an unreasonable risk of serious injury, Fitbit did not immediately report to the Commission as required,\" CPSC wrote in a press release on January 23. By a 5 to 0 vote, the commission provisionally accepted the settlement agreement, subject to public comment.

RELATED COVERAGE:LIVE: Eagles vs. Commanders NFC Championship updates What we know: The Philadelphia Eagles faced the Washington Commanders in the NFC Championship game Sunday, January 26. Many Eagles fans packed parking lots near the stadium to tailgate. One fan took roast to a whole new level. In a video captured by Frances Patano, an Eagles fan can be seen transporting a pig that is roasting in a shopping cart. Many fans bring their grills and cook up their favorite game-day foods at the tailgates. However, this fan might be the first to push their pig roast around the parking lot.

        "content": "On what may have proved to be Sunday's most important play, Brown burned Washington's Marshon Lattimore for a 31-yard gain that set up an Eagles touchdown just before the half. A.J. Brown’s week of interviews, appearances, and other obligations before the Eagles’ last trip to theSuper Bowlmade the days leading up to the game not feel like football. “I honestly felt like a paid actor,” Brown said Sunday after theEaglesclinched their second trip in three years tofootball’s grand stage. “The only part that felt like real football was the game. When you remove those things and just try to focus on the game, that’s the only thing that matters. Just trying to win. Everything else is for everybody else.” Brown will have the same obligations in New Orleans as he had two years ago in Arizona, but the wide receiver said he’s better prepared for the super hype this time for the rematch against the Kansas City Chiefs. He said the key is “removing feelings, removing excitement.” » READ MORE:Marcus Hayes: Opinion Jalen Hurts is a stone-cold winner “You try not to focus on it,” Brown said. “It’s something that you have to do. It’s not important. It’s important for everyone else to see you and hear what you have to say. But ultimately, none of that matters. You’re just trying to come out victorious.” Brown was quiet in the team’s first two postseason games before reminding everyone on Sunday that he’s one of the league’s premier receivers. He finished with a touchdown and 96 yards on six catches, perhaps none bigger than his fourth-down grab late in the second half of the NFC championship game. Saquon Barkleyset the tone with his 60-yard TD on the team’s first offensive play and Brown quieted the Washington Commanders with his big grab over Marshon Lattimore. Brown’s reward is a trip to the Super Bowl and days of questions. “We’ve been there before,” Brown said. “I’m not saying I’m used to it, but we’ve been there before. If you’ve been there before, you know what it’s like. You know what’s at stake and you know how to handle it now. That’s the only thing I’m focused on. Doing things differently and doing everything in my power to get this win.” » READ MORE:Mike Sielski: The Eagles are underdogs no more Brown finished the last Super Bowl with 96 yards and a TD on six catches. With his performance, he didn’t look like a guy who felt like a paid actor in the days leading up. And he looked like that player again on Sunday. The momentum the Eagles grabbed early in Sunday’s win was beginning to fade when they faced a fourth-and-5 at Washington’s 45-yard line.Nick Siriannikept the offense on the field with 2 minutes, 14 seconds left in the second quarter, but it seemed as ifJalen Hurtswould just try to bait the Commanders into an offside penalty before the Eagles ultimately punted. Instead, the Eagles sent Brown on a go route down the sideline. Brown sped past Lattimore and made the grab. It was a gutsy play call as the Eagles were only ahead by two and an incompletion would have given possession to the Commanders near midfield. The seeds of an eventual blowout were beginning to be planted. “You know that’s not the first time Nick has done that,” Brown said. “Nick has trust in us. We have trust in each other to make that play.” The Birds offense still runs through Barkley, but Brown’s return to form was important before the Super Bowl. The Eagles won’t be one-dimensional in New Orleans. Two years ago, Brown andDeVonta Smithcombined for 13 catches and 196 yards in the Super Bowl loss to Kansas City. Sunday’s win, which also included 45 yards from Smith, is enough to believe that the Eagles can do more than just run the ball when they return to the Super Bowl. Brown celebrated with his teammates but it would have been hard to tell the Eagles won the NFC title and not an October game if he wasn’t wearing the championship hat and shirt. Brown was excellent, yet he mentioned three times a mistake he made in the third quarter that likely few even noticed. There was no gloating. His postgame session with reporters was interrupted by a teammate holding a copy ofInner Excellence, the motivational book Brown read on the sideline during the team’s opening-round win over Green Bay. He said the book is his “recipe” and showed how he highlighted portions of it. “Every performance, presentation, or problem you face is an opportunity to learn and grow and vividly experience each moment,” wrote author Jim Murphy in a passage highlighted and underlined by Brown. “You will find as you take this journey with me that your best moments always come from a clear mind and unburdened heart. This allows you to take the risks necessary to be everything you were created to be.” There will be no shortage of distractions during Super Bowl week in New Orleans. The Eagles will practice just like they do inSouth Philadelphiaand study film of the Chiefs. But almost everything else will be different. Brown already knows. He did this before. This time, he’s prepared. “I’m just trying to keep my emotions intact, knowing that the job is not finished,” Brown said. “This is fun. I’m just so excited for the guys who haven’t been before and don’t understand this feeling. But I just want to win. We have four quarters. That’s the only thing I’m focused on.” » READ MORE:Moro Ojomo gave ‘Inner Excellence’ to A.J. Brown. The lesser-known Eagle has his own motivational story.",
