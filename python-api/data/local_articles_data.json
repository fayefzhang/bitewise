        "title": "Political uncertainty remains as Trump strikes temporary tariff deals",
        "source": "https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/",
        "content": "The impacts of Donald Trump’s long-promised pledge to use tariffs as a political cudgel started to come into focus Monday, even as the president cut last-minute deals with some of the country’s closest allies allowing him to back down from his initial threats.\n\nOn Saturday, Trump announced that he would slap broad 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico, both U.S. allies, and 10% tariffs on China, a political foe. The move was expected, but it still sparked fears about the rising costs of goods across the U.S. economy.\n\nThat concern is particularly potent because Trump campaigned heavily on lowering costs and easing inflation. If they are fully implemented, Trump's tariff proposals would affect American households' purchasing power by $1,000 to $1,200 annually, according to the Budget Lab at Yale University.\n\nThe first domino to fall came early Monday, when Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum announced a deal had been reached to delay tariffs on her country by one month, in return for Mexico’s agreeing to beef up its presence at the border with the United States with 10,000 members of its national guard.\n\nGet top local stories in Philly delivered to you every morning. Sign up for NBC Philadelphia's News Headlines newsletter.\n\nIt was an effort to placate the Trump administration, which at times has been inconsistent with its messaging about the rationale for tariffs but has consistently said curbing the flow of drug trafficking into the United States is a main focus.\n\nTrump officials quickly took a victory lap after the announcement, even as several steps to avoid a potential heated trade war remain.\n\n“So for literally three days, I heard the far left in this country say that these tariffs would make Americans' life worse,” Vice President JD Vance said at an event in Ohio in response to a question from NBC News. “And what actually happened is the Mexican government was so afraid of the tariffs that they actually are taking their border enforcement and their anti-cartel activity more seriously.\n\n“That is not a pathway to making Americans worse off,” he added. “That’s a pathway to making Americans better off.”\n\nTrump posted on Truth Social that he had a “very friendly conversation” with Sheinbaum, a quick shift in tone. Over the weekend, she rejected what she called “slander” from Trump for suggesting her government had an alliance with drug traffickers.\n\nThe past few days have shown one thing: Trump's tariff threats were not necessarily hollow campaign rhetoric.\n\n“One thing that is different is that leaders need to realize that Trump is serious,” Heritage Foundation research fellow EJ Antoni said. “If they just think it’s all bluster or campaign promises, nothing will really change, right? They have to know he is serious.”\n\nAntoni predicted continued “de-escalation” as Trump’s threats start to be interpreted as real, because of the size of the U.S. economy and the disproportionate trade relationships with Canada and Mexico. The two allies are America's largest trading partners, but international trade accounts for a much larger percentage of their overall economies.\n\n“He economically holds all the cards” he said. “He has now made clear this is serious and happening. You can either get on the train, get off the tracks or get run over.”\n\nThe U.S. reached an agreement with Mexico and Canada on Monday to delay a 25% tariff on all imports from the countries for one month.\n\nAt times, inconsistent rhetoric has come from the Trump administration about the motivation for tariffs. Trump economic adviser Peter Navarro told reporters in Washington on Monday that the fight is not a trade war but \"a drug war,\" echoing comments of other advisers.\n\nTrump himself, though, has repeatedly said he is concerned that the targets of the tariffs bully the United States and that the tariffs can be a weapon to end that perceived mistreatment.\n\nFor example, hours after the Mexico deal was announced, Trump continued to antagonize Canada, claiming the only thing it could do to avoid tariffs is become the 51st state — which Canada has repeatedly said it would not do.\n\n“What I’d like to see ... Canada become our 51st state,” Trump said in an Oval Office meeting with reporters when he was asked what Canada could do to end the pending trade war. “We give them protection, military protection. We don’t need them to build our cars — I’d rather see Detroit or South Carolina ... or any one of our states build the cars.”\n\nTrump spoke shortly before he was scheduled to have his second call of the day with outgoing Canadian Prime Minster Justin Trudeau. Unlike from Mexico, little fentanyl comes across the U.S.-Canadian border. Trudeau told reporters Saturday night that it is less than 1% of all the supply in the United States.\n\nA 30-day delay on tariffs on Canada was announced Monday afternoon after that second call. Trudeau said he had a “good call with President Trump,\" who has used him as a political bogeyman for months. As part of the deal, Trudeau said the country would spend $1.3 billion on a border security plan and appoint a “fentanyl czar.”\n\nThe Canadian government first proposed the border security funding part of the plan last year.\n\nA spokeswoman for the Canadian government did not reply to a request seeking comment about whether the already proposed plan was used as part of the deal with Trump.\n\nThe White House did not reply to a request for comment.\n\nMost congressional Republicans have not commented publicly on whether they support Trump’s push for tariffs on historic political and economic allies, with a few exceptions. Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, was the first to chime in Monday morning when he took to X to “plead” with Trump to consider tariffs’ impacts on his agriculture-heavy state.\n\n“Biden inflation increase the input cost to farming by 20% incl particularly high prices on fertilizer,” Grassley wrote. “So I plead w President Trump to exempt potash from the tariff because family farmers get most of our potash from Canada.”\n\nSen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., told Newsmax that he shares “the market’s concern” about long-term tariffs.\n\n“It’s going to hurt Americans, American companies, American exporters. It will hurt American consumers long term,” he said.\n\nWhile Trump brokered 30-day reprieves with Canada and Mexico, it is unclear how the tariff fight will end with them, and the threats against China — by far the largest economy of the three — were not resolved Monday.\n\nChina has said it will challenge the tariffs at the World Trade Organization and pursue “countermeasures” in response.\n\nThere is little indication that Republican senators will start to speak out in large numbers against Trump’s threats of trade wars, even if there is a prolonged fight on the issue.\n\n“There might be a few,” said a political adviser to Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D. “But generally, I think there is a sense that Trump holds all the cards here. To the extent there is concern about home state constituencies, I think a lot of that will be expressed quietly and behind the scenes.”\n\nAnother veteran Republican familiar with Thune’s thinking said he is unlikely to react in any overtly public or rash way.\n\n“These are U.S. senators. They have egos like everyone else,” the person said. “Sen. Thune approaches things differently. He is more of a read-the-room guy. I’d not expect him to act impulsively on anything, including this.”\n\nThe impacts of potential tariffs, for now, have been averted, but the future remains unclear, which leaves uncertainty both in the United States and around the globe. U.S. markets fell early Monday, but they quickly rebounded after the one-month Mexico pause was announced.\n\nThe SGE category was created by Congress in 1962 to hire outside experts.\n\nThough Trump ran on the promise that tariffs would be good for the nation, in recent days, he has begun to acknowledge that if they are fully implemented there would be some short-term pain. But he now argues that those bumps and bruises would be beneficial to the nation in the long run.\n\n“Will there be some pain? Yes, maybe (and maybe not!),” Trump posted on Truth Social. “But we will make America great again, and it will all be worth the price that must be paid. We are a country that is now being run with common sense — and the results will be spectacular!!!”\n\nHenry J. Gomez contributed.\n\nThis article first appeared on NBCNews.com.

        "source": "https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/",
        "content": "Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro is expected to seek more money for public schools and public transit when he delivers his third budget proposal to lawmakers Tuesday. Shapiro is also expected to reprise his support for legalizing marijuana and introducing taxes on skill games viewed as competitors to casinos and lottery contests.\n\nShapiro's budget proposal could approach $50 billion for the 2025-26 fiscal year beginning July 1. He was scheduled to address a joint session of the General Assembly at 11:30 a.m. in the House of Representatives as he delivered the document to lawmakers.\n\nPassage will require approval from Pennsylvania’s Democratic-controlled House and its Republican-controlled Senate.\n\nShapiro is under pressure from education allies and Democratic lawmakers to marshal billions more for schools in response to a court decision that found Pennsylvania’s system of public school funding violates the constitutional rights of students in the poorest districts.\n\nGet top local stories in Philly delivered to you every morning. Sign up for NBC Philadelphia's News Headlines newsletter.\n\nShapiro's budget delivered a substantial increase for schools this year, while lawyers for the schools that sued the state are asking for a $1.3 billion increase for the next fiscal cycle, or almost 13% more.\n\nShapiro also has said he'll seek tax breaks to subsidize the cost of building new power plants and more money for rural health care services. He also is expected to make another pitch to legalize marijuana to skeptical Republican lawmakers.\n\nMeanwhile, Shapiro has been adamant about preventing cutbacks by the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority, the Philadelphia region’s public transit agency struggling to regain ridership lost during the pandemic.\n\nRepublicans resisted giving Shapiro his full request last year, prompting him to divert one-time federal highway funds to stave off near-term service cutbacks and fare increases. One Shapiro-backed idea to pay for it is taxing the skill games that are popular in bars, convenience stores, pizzerias and standalone parlors around the state.\n\nShapiro is up against numerous pressures.\n\nThese include entreaties to boost pay for workers who care for older adults and disabled people while also navigating growing deficit projections, a slow-growing economy and a shrinking workforce.\n\nCounties say the mental health services network they administer is on the verge of collapse and nursing home operators say they’re getting rid of beds because they can’t afford to staff them. Meanwhile, home care providers say it’s getting harder to find and keep workers, making it harder for people who need their services to receive them.\n\nShapiro does have a cushion of about $10.5 billion in reserve, thanks to federal COVID-19 relief and inflation-juiced tax collections over the past few years.\n\nHowever, this year's $47.6 billion spending plan required about $3 billion of surplus cash to balance, eliciting warnings from Republicans that the state must slow the pace of spending or risk depleting its surplus within several years.\n\nThe state is projected to bring in less than $47 billion in tax collections in the 2025-26 fiscal year — likely well below what Shapiro will propose in spending, especially after the state issues refunds.\n\n___\n\nFollow Marc Levy on X at: https://x.com/timelywriter",

That day, I promised myself that I would never take a child into surgery crying again.”\n\nGuimarães relies on his craft as a former clown.\n\n“When I started medical school, I joined a clown group where we had theater classes to learn how to be clowns and how to distract children during our weekly visits to pediatric inpatients at the university hospital,” says Guimarães. “Since then, I fell in love with working with children, and over time, the skills I learned as a hospital clown also helped me examine children in the office without scaring them.”\n\nGuimarães typically orders a variety of costumes such as Batman and The Flash.\n\n“I let the child choose which one they want to wear,” he says, adding, “I explain to them that we will go in ‘flying’ or running and that we are going to clear their nose and ears! I enter the surgical room when they are ready and engaged in the game. If I notice they are still scared, I ask a parent to come in with them. That way, anesthesia induction is always calmer.”\n\nDr. Guimarães with a patient who chose a Batman cape for surgery. (@otorrino.leandro via Instagram)\n\nGuimarães says after the patient falls asleep, their costume is removed and given to their parent.\n\n“I usually record the child’s entrance and send the video to the mother — they love it because they can show their children how brave they were!” he says.\n\nAll children get to take their costumes home after the surgery, and as Guimarães explains, “Some children operated on by my colleagues see them, so I end up giving them one as well.”\n\nAccording to Guimarães, many of his patients show up to their follow-up appointments wearing their costumes, “proudly showing that the experience was not traumatic at all.”\n\nThe doctor says his patients are transformed into fearless superheroes.\n\n“Most children love them!” he says. “They get super excited and feel empowered when they put on the costume! They walk in so happily that their parents also feel at ease and almost forget that they are entrusting me with their most precious treasure for surgery.”\n\nGuimarães feels heroic, too.\n\n“I get emotional when parents tell me that their children pass by the hospital and say they want to have surgery again because their memory of the experience is positive, full of play and fun,” he says.\n\nGuimarães adds, “Some children who later needed surgeries from other specialties wished that I could be their surgeon, even if it was for something unrelated, like an elbow fracture. That is incredibly rewarding for me.”\n\nThis story first appeared on TODAY.com. More from TODAY:",

        "content": "Several businesses across the country – including in Philadelphia – participated in a “day without immigrants” on Monday, Feb. 3, 2025, in protest against President Donald Trump’s immigration policies.\n\nThe campaign called on immigrants to not go to work, not attend schools and not spend any money on businesses in order to show how important immigrants are to the country’s economy.\n\nMonday afternoon in Philadelphia, several businesses were closed in solidarity with the nationwide protests, including Braza’s BBQ Chicken, a Peruvian restaurant in South Philadelphia.\n\n“Us, the immigration population, we are part of the backbone of the economy of the country,” Juan Andres Placencia, the owner of Braza’s, told NBC10.\n\nGet top local stories in Philly delivered to you every morning. Sign up for NBC Philadelphia's News Headlines newsletter.\n\nPlacencia said it was a difficult financial decision to close but a necessary one to honor his family.\n\n“It gives us an opportunity to demonstrate our numbers,” he said. “Demonstrate what it really means to not have immigrants as part of the U.S. economy. As workers. As people that offer job opportunities to others.\"\n\nWhile business owners closed for the day, other protesters marched from 9th Street and Washington Avenue in South Philadelphia to City Hall in Center City.\n\n“If we are not buying, participating actually, you will see that those offices aren’t clean,” Ana Victoria Sandoval, a member of the immigration rights group Juntos, told NBC10. “The floors aren’t clean. They are going to be running low because that is us that are bringing it to the table.”\n\nThe protest occurred amid recent U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raids and operations across the U.S. under President Trump’s new administration.\n\n“I feel like it’s something that shouldn’t happen,” Luis Ojeda of Juntos told NBC10. “All we can do is pray for the best.”\n\nMonday's protest was peaceful and there were no reports of injuries or arrests. Organizers of the protest said they’re planning on holding another demonstration in the near future.\n\nThe nationwide rally occurred less than a week after an ICE operation at a car wash in Philadelphia’s Juniata Park neighborhood. Juntos members said at the time that a total of seven people were detained during the raid.\n\nSince President Donald Trump took office in January, his administration touted deportation efforts and published new rules making it easier to remove people — part of a flurry of actions to make good on campaign promises to crack down on illegal immigration.\n\nMany of ICE's recent actions have not been unusual. Under the Biden administration, ICE averaged 311 daily arrests in the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30. President Joe Biden also sent active-duty troops to the border in 2023, and numerous administrations have sent National Guard troops to assist Customs and Border Protection.\n\nHowever, rumors of arrests and news reports or social media posts about the presence of agents sparked worries in communities around the country. Some rights groups launched plans to protect immigrants in the event of arrests at schools or workplaces, including in Philadelphia.",

Sign up for NBC Philadelphia's News Headlines newsletter.\n\nOn Friday, Jan. 31, 2025, just after 6 p.m., a Learjet 55 operated by Jet Rescue Air Ambulance crashed along Cottman Avenue in front of the Roosevelt Mall near Roosevelt Boulevard.\n\nOfficials said the plane was in the air for less than a minute before it crashed.\n\nThat location is about 3 miles from Northeast Philadelphia Airport.\n\nThe medical jet was transporting a child who had just completed treatment for a life-threatening condition, her mother and four others when it crashed, officials have said.\n\nWho was on the plane?\n\nJet Rescue Air Ambulance identified the crew as Capt. Alan Alejandro Montoya Perales, co-pilot Josue de Jesus Juarez Juarez, Dr. Raul Meza Arredondo and paramedic Rodrigo Lopez Padilla.\n\nThe Government of Ensenada also identified the patient and her mother who were in the plane as Valentina Guzman Murillo and Lizeth Murillo Ozuna, respectively.\n\nEveryone aboard the flight was killed in the crash.\n\nOfficials have said that all of the individuals on the plane were from Mexico. Guzman Murillo was being transported home, according to Jet Rescue spokesperson Shai Gold.\n\nThe flight’s final destination was Tijuana after a stop in Branson, Missouri.\n\nGold said this was a seasoned crew and everyone involved in these flights goes through rigorous training.\n\nWhy did the plane crash?\n\nNo official cause of the crash has yet been provided.\n\nAccording to the flight tacker company FlightAware, the jet took off from Northeast Philadelphia Airport at 6:06 p.m. on Friday, Jan. 31, 2025.\n\nThe air traffic controller made contact with the plane on departure and the pilot responded.\n\nHowever, shortly after takeoff, the air traffic controller repeatedly tried to make contact with the pilot again, but they got no response.\n\nThe flight path shows the plane made it about 1,600 feet in the air before air traffic control lost contact.\n\nOn Sunday, investigators recovered the black box, or cockpit voice recorder (CVR), from the plane. It was located at the site of the initial impact -- near Cottman Avenue and Rupert Street -- at a depth of 8 feet in crater.\n\nThe NTSB also recovered the aircraft's enhanced ground proximity warning system (EGPWS).\n\nOn Monday, in a visit to the site of the crash, U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy noted the investigation is still ongoing into the cause of the crash and officials are still analyzing those devices as they seek answers.\n\n\"We have agreed to be as transparent as possible with information as it comes out,\" he said.\n\nAlso, in discussing the investigation, Duffy took time to applaud Parker as well as city and state officials for the speedy response to the tragedy.\n\n“There has been a substantial impact that has taken place in your city,” Duffy said, calling Parker’s work in response to the incident \"remarkable.”\n\n“They responded quickly to the scene and did a fantastic job,” he said.\n\nWho was injured, killed on the ground?\n\nIn an update on Monday, Philadelphia Mayor Cherelle Parker said that officials now believe at least 24 people were hurt when the plane crashed in Northeast Philly.\n\nAlso, she said, one person in a car -- who officials have not yet shared further identifying information on -- was killed when the plane crashed near the Roosevelt Mall.\n\nParker also said that, as of Monday, four people remained hospitalized following the crash. Two of those still hospitalized were listed in critical condition, Parker said.\n\nNBC10 spoke to the cousin of a 33-year-old woman named Dominque, who was injured in the crash and remained in a medically-induced coma.\n\n“She is in a medically-induced coma,” Fletcher told NBC10 on Sunday. “Seventy percent of her body is burnt. She’s responding well to medication. She has surgery scheduled for today.”\n\nAnother person who remained hospitalized days after the crash is 10-year-old Trey Howard.\n\nThe boy's father, Andre Howard, told NBC10 his son was hit in the head with metal while in a car near the scene of the crash.\n\n\"The way it landed, it was only because he laid on his sister,\" Howard told NBC10. \"He landed right on the right side of his head.\"\n\nOfficials said Sunday that they are still investigating and are working to determine if anyone else was injured or if anyone has gone missing since last week's crash.\n\nHow the crash has affected the Northeast Philadelphia community\n\nMayor Parker said over the weekend that at least 11 homes were damaged, as well as a few businesses, due to the crash.\n\nSaleena Temple told NBC10 her sister Alexis Lloyd lost her home during the crash. Temple said Lloyd was only a few feet away from the fiery impact.\n\n“She was in the kitchen, cooking when it happened,” Temple said.\n\nOfficials with the city's Office of Emergency Management said that PECO and PGW have confirmed all services have been returned in the area near the crash, except for immediately impacted buildings.\n\nBut, they said, there will be repairs needed to lights, traffic signals and roads.\n\nAlso, the incident caused road closures and SEPTA bus route detours over the weekend.\n\nBy Monday, Roosevelt Boulevard had fully reopened to traffic, though Cottman Avenue in the area of the crash remains closed.\n\nOfficials have said only two bus routes, the Route 70 and 77 busses, remain detoured due to the crash.\n\nFinally, city officials plan a town hall meeting for those impacted by this crash.\n\nParker said Monday that the town hall would be held at the Solomon Solis-Cohen Elementary School at 7001 Horrocks Street on Wednesday, Feb. 5, 2025 at 7 p.m.\n\nThis is a breaking news story. It will be updated as new information becomes available.",

        "source": "https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/",
        "content": "The Super Bowl is one of the most exciting events on the sports calendar. Between pregame theatrics, a headlining halftime show and, of course, a championship NFL game, there’s something for just about everybody to look forward to on Super Bowl Sunday.\n\nFor a decade-long stretch, however, one aspect was noticeably stale.\n\nThe Super Bowl logo went from a unique design each year to an annual re-hash. The NFL has made creative progress with it in the last four years, but why did it take so long to get innovative again?\n\nWith this year’s matchup between the Philadelphia Eagles and Kansas City Chiefs set, let’s look at how the Super Bowl logo got to where it is today:\n\nGet top local stories in Philly delivered to you every morning. Sign up for NBC Philadelphia's News Headlines newsletter.\n\nHow did Super Bowl logos used to look?\n\nBefore the NFL got into a repetitive cycle, it had over four decades of original Super Bowl logos.\n\nThe first Super Bowl logo didn’t even say “Super Bowl,” as it was considered the “First World Championship Game” between the AFL and NFL. Super Bowl II marked the origins of not only artistic logos, but also the use of Roman numerals.\n\nFor the next 40-plus years, each Super Bowl logo stood out on its own. Fonts, colors and more continued to evolve, and the designs even began to incorporate the sites of the game itself. Prime examples of this creativity include Super Bowl XXI (Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California), Super Bowl XXXI (New Orleans), Super Bowl XXXVIII (Houston) and Super Bowl XXXIX (Jacksonville).\n\nThe best Super Bowl logo is: pic.twitter.com/LaNNwk8R6y — NFL UK & Ireland (@NFLUKIRE) February 9, 2022\n\nWhen did the NFL change its Super Bowl logo design?\n\nAfter utilizing unique logos for Super Bowls I through XLIV, the NFL made a switch to a cookie-cutter design.\n\nBefore Super XLIV took place in Miami in February 2010, the NFL and the North Texas Super Bowl Committee unveiled the logo for the ensuing Super Bowl that would take place in Arlington, Texas. From top to bottom, the logo had the Lombardi Trophy, Cowboys Stadium, a bar that read “Super Bowl” and the Roman numerals for 45.\n\nThe logo was the first of its kind, as no other Super Bowl had involved the Lombardi Trophy in its design. And for the next 10 years, that – like just about everything else – would not change.\n\n“It's a unique mixture of icons that represents what this whole thing is all about. It's well done,” Bill Lively, the president and CEO of the North Texas Super Bowl XLV Host committee, said at the time, via ESPN. “We've approached our mission not just for 45 but for many, many [Super Bowl] games to come.”\n\nThe NFL got some outside help in creating its new system in 2010, which extended beyond the Super Bowl and into other rounds of the playoffs. Landor Associates, now Landor & Fitch, partnered with the league and helped launch the redesign.\n\nHow did the Super Bowl logo change from 2010 to 2020?\n\nFor five straight years, the Super Bowl logo had the same formula: the Lombardi Trophy and stadium sitting atop “Super Bowl” and the Roman numerals. It used the same font and colors with only the background venue and numerals adjusting with each iteration.\n\nThe NFL switched things up for Super Bowl 50 in the 2015 season, more from a name standpoint than a design one. To celebrate a half-century – and avoid calling that season’s big game “Super Bowl L” – the league ditched the Roman numerals for one season.\n\nAs for the logo, the NFL incorporated color into the Super Bowl logo for the first time in six years, giving the “50” a sleek gold. Aside from that, the only difference between that and prior logos was sticking the 50 behind the Lombardi Trophy instead of below it and placing Levi’s Stadium as the venue.\n\nYesterday, the #NFL revealed the Super Bowl 50 logo to be hosted here in 2016. READ: http://t.co/GZvYEvy3cR pic.twitter.com/kW1EPovY0i — Levi's® Stadium (@LevisStadium) June 5, 2014\n\nThe Roman numerals returned for Super Bowl LI, and so did repetitive logos. For the next five years, the logo went “L” plus the Lombardi Trophy plus the remaining numerals. Over that stretch, there were ever-so-slight modifications like color and miniscule font tweaks, but they were otherwise indistinguishable. Super Bowls LVII and LVIII looked as identical to one another as the four-year run of Super Bowls XLV through XLVIII – just add an “I” and that’s it.\n\nDo other leagues use the same championship logo every year?\n\nPart of the NFL’s rationale in sticking with one design was its desire to match other major leagues and events.\n\n“A sports event of this stature needed a consistent, iconic identity — a symbol that fans could immediately recognize, much like the Olympic rings,” Landor said, via The Washington Post.\n\nThe Olympic rings are no doubt an iconic symbol, but the Olympics still incorporate a new logo for each edition of the Summer and Winter Games. The same goes for the World Cup, too.\n\nLooking at other major American sports leagues, the NBA maintained a Finals logo from 2004 to 2017 before switching to a bland design. After four seasons, the league finally switched back to its signature, cursive font for its championship series in 2022. Major League Baseball went through a handful of recurring World Series designs in the 1970s, ‘80s and ‘90s before making different logos throughout the 21st century.\n\nSuper Bowl LVI logo\n\nThe NFL took a creative step forward with its logo for Super Bowl LVI, even if it was a small one.\n\nThe Roman numerals were red with a little bit of yellow and palm trees were included for the game’s return to the Los Angeles area. The Lombardi Trophy was also moved behind the numerals, eliminating any confusion about if it was meant to signify an “I.”\n\nThe logo for Super Bowl LVI at SoFi Stadium in Los Angeles was unveiled today.\n\n\n\nThe journey begins. pic.twitter.com/wfWEachUAq — Field Yates (@FieldYates) February 10, 2021\n\nWhile any change could be seen as a good change, there were still some complaints about the Super Bowl LVI logo and its “bloody” shade of red.\n\nSuper Bowl LVII logo\n\nLike many of the logos from the first four decades of the Super Bowl, as well as its immediate predecessor, the Super Bowl LVII logo infused its location.\n\nThe logo for Super Bowl LVII has been revealed, once again adding some local flavor to the Roman numerals: https://t.co/L7c8mwYwoh pic.twitter.com/ZlQO3vLV49 — Andrew Lind (@AndrewMLind) February 14, 2022\n\nThe Super Bowl LVII logo showcases a canyon and blue, turquoise, purple and red desert features as the game returned to Glendale, Arizona. The Lombardi Trophy is slightly behind the colorful “L,” though it is alongside the “V,” whereas it was behind the “V” on the Super Bowl LVI logo.\n\nSuper Bowl LVIII logo\n\nThe Super Bowl LVIII logo infused some Sin City flair for the first ever championship game in Las Vegas.\n\nThe logo features a purple and red gradient with the iconic \"Fabulous Las Vegas Sign.\"\n\nSuper Bowl LIX logo\n\nThe Super Bowl LIX logo got some NOLA inspiration and made history in the process.\n\nThe NFL collaborated with Tahj Williams, a local artist who is the queen of her Black Masking Indian tribe in New Orleans. Williams used Black Masking Indian methods of beading to build the Super Bowl LIX logo by hand.",

Israel retaliated with an air and land assault on Gaza, killing more than 47,000 people, most of them civilians, according to local officials. Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians have been displaced.\n\nThe scale of Israeli counteroffensive has led to international condemnation, but Netanyahu has defended his actions, most recently en route to Washington.\n\n\"The decisions we have made during the war, combined with the heroism of the IDF soldiers, they have already changed the face of the Middle East. They have changed it beyond recognition. I think that by working hard with President Trump, we can change it even more, for the better,\" Netanyahu said.\n\nTrump had said he wants Jordan and Egypt to accept more Palestinian refugees as part of an effort to “clean out” Gaza.\n\nNetanyahu and Trump were close allies during Trump's first term in office, but their relationship became strained after Netanyahu congratulated Joe Biden on winning the 2020 election while Trump was still challenging the results.\n\nJust days after the Oct. 7 attack, Trump told a crowd at a campaign rally that Netanyahu had “let us down” during his first administration, arguing that he had been unhelpful before the United States killed a top Iranian general. That led to criticism from his Republican rivals, and Trump later posted on social media, “#IStandWithIsrael” and “#IStandWithBibi,” using Netanyahu's nickname.\n\nTheir relationship appeared mended in July when Netanyahu visited Trump at his Florida residence after having met with Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris and after a failed attempt on Trump's life.\n\nNetanyahu said Sunday the \"fact that this will be [Trump's] first meeting with a foreign leader since his inauguration has great significance for the state of Israel\" and \"testifies to the strength of the alliance between Israel and the United States.\"\n\nThe trip is far from Netanyahu's first trip to the White House.\n\nWhen he was welcomed Monday at Blair House, the historic official guest residence of the White House, its director said it was Netanyahu's 14th visit to the residence — many more than any other foreign leader has made since it was built in the 19th century.\n\nThis article first appeared on NBCNews.com.

        "content": "A federal judge presiding over the heated public feud between actors Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni over whether sexual harassment occurred during the making of “It Ends With Us” warned lawyers Monday to obey court rules about public statements meant to ensure a fair trial.\n\nJudge Lewis J. Liman suggested he could make the March 9, 2026, trial happen sooner if lawyers were unable to stop making fiery public comments that could contaminate a potential jury pool.\n\nNeither actor attended the Manhattan federal court hearing where lawyers again repeated their claims that their adversaries weren't playing fair.\n\nAttorney Michael Gottlieb, representing Lively, complained that Baldoni’s attorney had made inflammatory statements publicly that were devastating to Lively.\n\nGet top local stories in Philly delivered to you every morning. Sign up for NBC Philadelphia's News Headlines newsletter.\n\nHe said she was “very eager to move forward and have her day in court.”\n\nBlake Lively and Justin Baldoni are facing off in several legal battles. The “Gossip Girl” alum filed a lawsuit against her “It Ends With Us” co-star and director in December, accusing him of an alleged smear campaign and allegedly sexually harassing her.\n\nBryan Freedman, representing Baldoni and his production company, said his clients had suffered hundreds of millions of dollars in damages due to Lively’s claims that she was sexually harassed on the movie set.\n\nFreedman said he didn't want to say “they started it,” but that this is what occurred when Lively took her complaints about Baldoni to the media.\n\nLively sued Baldoni, his production company and others in New York in late December for sexual harassment and attacks on her reputation and sought unspecified damages. Baldoni sued last month, accusing Lively and her husband, “Deadpool” actor Ryan Reynolds, of defamation and extortion and seeking at least $400 million in damages.\n\n“It Ends With Us,” an adaptation of Colleen Hoover’s bestselling 2016 novel that begins as a romance but takes a dark turn into domestic violence, was released in August, exceeding box office expectations with a $50 million debut. But the movie’s release was shrouded by speculation over discord between Lively and Baldoni.\n\nLively became widely known after she appeared in the 2005 film “The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants.” She bolstered her stardom on the TV series “Gossip Girl” from 2007 to 2012 before starring in films including “The Town” and “The Shallows.”\n\nBaldoni starred in the TV comedy “Jane the Virgin,” directed the 2019 film “Five Feet Apart” and wrote “Man Enough,” a book pushing back against traditional notions of masculinity.",

Over 13 million hens have been lost or slaughtered since December following the bird flu outbreak, according to the Agriculture Department’s latest Egg Markets Overview.\n\nEconomists and market analysts have cited the bird flu as the chief reason for the price spike, along with the typical consumer demand for eggs during the winter holiday season.\n\nGet top local stories in Philly delivered to you every morning. Sign up for NBC Philadelphia's News Headlines newsletter.\n\n\"Consumers and restaurants are being forced to make difficult decisions,\" Waffle House, Inc. said in the statement.\n\nThe franchise said the $0.50 increase \"is a temporary targeted surcharge\" tied to the rise in egg prices, and that they \"will adjust or remove the surcharge as market conditions allow.\"\n\n\"While we hope these price fluctuations will be short-lived we cannot predict how long this shortage will last,\" the franchise said.\n\nPertinent to the food industry's recovery and mitigating the spread of the virus is identifying cases of bird flu.\n\nTo assist with bird flu investigations, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has urged labs to determine whether people hospitalized with the flu have the virus or just seasonal influenza within 24 hours of admission.\n\nThis guidance has been in place since last fall, but many hospitals have been sending flu samples out for testing in bulk every few days. According to the CDC's Dr. Nirav Shah, patients have often already been sent home by the time test results have come back.\n\n\"The more time that goes by, the more memories fade and the harder it is to identify a potential source,” Shah said during a news briefing last month. This can also mean that “their close contacts may be beyond the window for preventative medications like Tamiflu.”\n\nThe seasonal flu is raging in the U.S. right now, especially in the West, across the Midwest and deep into the Southeast, the CDC said last month.\n\nThis article first appeared on NBCNews.com.

Kennedy Jr., the controversial environmental lawyer turned public health critic, cleared his first hurdle on Tuesday to become the nation's top health official when the senate finance committee voted to advance his nomination for a floor vote.\n\nRepublicans voted together to advance his nomination, while Democrats all opposed.\n\nHis nomination now will face a full senate vote, despite concerns about the work he's done to sow doubts around vaccine safety and his potential to profit off lawsuits over drugmakers.\n\nTo gain control of the $1.7 trillion Health and Human Services agency, Kennedy will need support from all but three Republicans if Democrats uniformly oppose him.\n\nGet top local stories in Philly delivered to you every morning. Sign up for NBC Philadelphia's News Headlines newsletter.\n\nRepublican Sen. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, who is also a physician and sits on the finance committee, voted to advance Kennedy's confirmation. Last week, during Kennedy's hearings, Cassidy repeatedly implored Kennedy to reject a disproven theory that vaccines cause autism, to no avail. He ended the hearing by saying he was “struggling” with the vote.\n\n“Your past, undermining confidence in vaccines with unfounded or misleading arguments, concerns me,” Cassidy told Kennedy.\n\nRepublican Sens. Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Mitch McConnell of Kentucky are all seen as potential no votes, too, because they voted against President Donald Trump's defense secretary nominee and have expressed concerns about Kennedy's anti-vaccine work.\n\nIn a CBS “60 Minutes” interview that aired Sunday, McConnell declined to say how he would vote on Kennedy's nomination but reiterated “vaccines are critically important.”\n\nDemocrats, meanwhile, continue to raise alarms about Kennedy's potential to financially benefit from changing vaccine guidelines or weakening federal lawsuit protections against vaccine makers if confirmed as health secretary.\n\n“It seems possible that many different types of vaccine-related decisions and communications — which you would be empowered to make and influence as Secretary — could result in significant financial compensation for your family,” Democratic Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Ron Wyden of Oregon wrote in a letter sent over the weekend to Kennedy.\n\nIn Pete Hegseth’s confirmation hearing on Tuesday, Sen. Elizabeth Warren questioned Trump’s Pentagon pick on why his stance on women in the military changed after the 2024 election of Donald Trump.\n\nKennedy said he'll give his son all of the referral fees in legal cases against vaccine makers, including the fees he gets from referring clients in a case against Merck. Kennedy told the committee he's referred hundreds of clients to a law firm that's suing Merck's Gardasil, the human papillomavirus vaccine that prevents cervical cancer. He's earned $2.5 million from the deal over the past three years.\n\nAs secretary, Kennedy will oversee vaccine recommendations and public health campaigns for the $1.7 trillion agency, which is also responsible for food and hospital inspections, providing health insurance for millions of Americans and researching deadly diseases.\n\nKennedy, a longtime Democrat, ran for president but withdrew last year to throw his support to Trump in exchange for an influential job in his Republican administration. Together, they have forged a new and unusual coalition made up of conservatives who oppose vaccines and liberals who want to see the government promote healthier foods. Trump and Kennedy have branded the movement as “Make America Healthy Again.”\n\nRobert F. Kennedy Jr., President Donald Trump's nominee to lead the Department of Health and Human Services, appeared before the Senate Finance Committee for his first confirmation hearing on Wednesday.",

One side is always favored, and the other is forced to knock them off. That’s true yet again in this year’s Super Bowl LIX, where Vegas has pegged the Kansas City Chiefs as 1.5-point favorites over the Philadelphia Eagles as of Tuesday (via Action Network).\n\nHere’s a look at some of the biggest upsets and spreads in Super Bowl history:\n\nGet top local stories in Philly delivered to you every morning. Sign up for NBC Philadelphia's News Headlines newsletter.\n\nWhat is the biggest upset in Super Bowl history?\n\nNew York Jets (+18) over Baltimore Colts in Super Bowl III\n\nDespite a Super Bowl record-tying 18-point spread, New York Jets quarterback Joe Namath guaranteed a victory before this game. It’s safe to say that worked out for Broadway Joe. The 13-1 Baltimore Colts entered the game riding a 10-game winning streak and were fresh off a 34-0 victory in the NFL Championship Game. New York jumped out to a 16-0 lead before Baltimore added a late TD for a 16-7 final score.\n\nNew England Patriots (+14) over St. Louis Rams in Super Bowl XXXVI\n\nTom Brady’s first Super Bowl win was perhaps his most unlikely, as the New England Patriots entered as 14-point underdogs against the “Greatest Show on Turf” Rams. Kurt Warner’s squad was looking for a second title in three years, while Brady had just 16 starts to his name. New England had a 17-3 lead entering the fourth quarter before St. Louis tied the game with a minute and a half to play. Brady then marched down the field to set up a game-winning field goal as time expired, sealing a 20-17 win.\n\nNew York Giants (+12.5) over New England Patriots in Super Bowl XLII\n\nThree years after Brady’s third Super Bowl, he entered as a 12.5-point favorite as the 18-0 Patriots faced the 13-6 New York Giants. New England’s historic offense never got going in this one, holding a narrow 7-3 lead entering the fourth quarter. The teams traded scores in the final frame, with Plaxico Burress’ touchdown catch putting New York ahead 17-14 with 35 seconds left. Brady and Co. couldn’t do anything with the short time remaining, and their perfect season was spoiled by Eli Manning.\n\nKansas City Chiefs (+12) over Minnesota Vikings in Super Bowl IV\n\nThe NFL team (Minnesota) was again heavily favored over the AFL team (Kansas City) in Super Bowl IV, the same way the Colts were predicted to easily beat the Jets the year prior. Yet again, the AFL proved its teams were just as good, if not better, than any NFL team. The Chiefs led 16-0 at halftime and cruised to an easy 23-7 victory, with Len Dawson taking home MVP for KC.\n\nDenver Broncos (+11.5) over Green Bay Packers in Super Bowl XXXII\n\nThe defending champion Packers, led by Brett Favre, were 11.5-point favorites over John Elway’s Broncos. Elway was already 0-3 in the Super Bowl over his career, and he hadn’t reached the big game in eight seasons. In a back-and-forth affair, the game was tied at seven, then again at 17 and later at 24, before Denver pulled ahead for a 31-24 win. Terrell Davis had three touchdowns en route to winning Super Bowl MVP.\n\nWhat is the biggest spread in Super Bowl history?\n\nThe biggest spread in a Super Bowl is 18 – which has happened twice in history.\n\nThe first 18-point spread was in the aforementioned Super Bowl III between the Jets and Colts, with New York winning the game 16-7. Twenty-six years later, there was another 18-point spread. In Super Bowl XXIX, the San Francisco 49ers were massive favorites over the San Diego Chargers – and they delivered. Steve Young’s 49ers won the game 49-26, covering the 18-point spread as they locked up their fifth Super Bowl title in 13 years.\n\nHow many favorites have lost the Super Bowl?\n\nThe favorite has lost the Super Bowl outright 21 times in its 58-year history. The Chiefs were underdogs in their Super Bowl wins in 2023 and 2024, though both games were narrow spreads (+2 and +1, respectively). The favorite has failed to cover the spread in 29 of 58 games, with two of those 29 being a push.\n\nFormer Patriots wide receiver Julian Edelman explains why the Eagles will need to play a \"perfect game\" to beat Patrick Mahomes and the Chiefs in Super Bowl LIX.",

        "content": "New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy sparked Republican outrage over recent comments suggesting he and the state's first lady offered an immigrant with uncertain immigration status the opportunity to stay at their home, but he didn't actually make the offer and the person never moved in, his spokesperson said Tuesday.\n\nThe second term Democratic governor was relaying a conversation he had had with with first lady Tammy Murphy about someone they knew who was legally in the country but worried about their status, his spokesperson Mahen Gunaratna said. The governor had said he suggested inviting the person to stay at their house, but the offer wasn't made in the end, Gunaratna said.\n\nMurphy's initial comments came up over the weekend while he was speaking at a progressive forum about how his administration could push back against Trump.\n\n“I don’t want to get into too much detail, but there’s someone in our broader universe whose immigration status is not yet at the point that they are trying to get it to,” Murphy said. “We said ‘You know what? Let’s have her live at our house above our garage, and good luck to the feds trying to come in and get her.’”\n\nGet top local stories in Philly delivered to you every morning. Sign up for NBC Philadelphia's News Headlines newsletter.\n\nRepublicans pounced on the comment. Mario Kranjac, a Republican running to succeed Murphy, said it’s time for immigration officials to pay the governor a visit. Elon Musk, the world’s richest man, and recently confirmed to be a “ special government employee,” has been heading up what he and the White House call the Department of Government Efficiency. In a post on X showing Murphy’s statement, Musk said: “Wow.”\n\nMurphy’s administration has been largely supportive of immigration. Under his tenure, the state attorney general issued guideline limiting cooperation between local New Jersey police and immigration officials. A bill that would make the directive state law is pending in the Legislature, but hasn’t advanced.\n\nIt has gotten renewed attention since Trump’s second administration began and immigration officials arrested people in Newark last month. The arrests led immigrant rights advocates to call out “Where’s Governor Murphy?” during a news conference held by Newark’s mayor to deride the immigration enforcement.\n\nMurphy, a wealthy former Goldman Sachs executive who served as an ambassador to Germany during the Obama administration, has a home along the Navesink River in Middletown, New Jersey.",

(Nathan Congleton/TODAY)\n\nDeclan, who has systemic juvenile arthritis and has been hospitalized 17 times, was discussing how excited he was to be on hand to see the Eagles defeat the Commanders when he explained why he gave away the money, saying on TODAY his teacher had talked about “paying it forward.”\n\n“It also makes me feel good,” he added.\n\nHis mom, Jillian, said going to the NFC championship offered a break from the troubles Declan has had.\n\n“For that whole day, we were able to forget about everything he goes through,” she said.\n\n“He’s in pain a lot and has to go to the doctors all the time and we were able to just live in the moment and enjoy his fairy tale and dream come true.”\n\nDeclan, who was wearing the jersey of star Eagles running back Saquon Barkley, then chose the mystery Eagles bird over doing the weather with Dylan Dreyer when Savannah Guthrie gave him the option.

        "content": "Originally appeared on E! Online\n\nAriana Grande is reminding people of the truth: the voice is mine.\n\nThe \"Wicked\" actress — whose performance in the film earned her an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actress —addressed criticism that she now speaks with a higher-pitched voice than in the past.\n\n“The thing that I do that perplexes people so much — and it's just so funny because if you're a person who uses their voice, you know about this,” Grande said on the Feb. 3 episode of the Smartless podcast, “is if I have a long day of press or if I have to sing, I'll place [my voice] a little higher.”\n\nGet top local stories in Philly delivered to you every morning. Sign up for NBC Philadelphia's News Headlines newsletter.\n\nThe 31-year-old added, “I'll change my vocal placement to kind of preserve. But that is just something that's healthy for the voice. It's just basically pitching your voice up a tiny bit.”\n\nGrande — who began dating her \"Wicked\" costar Ethan Slater in 2023 — also addressed the haters directly, calling their criticism “interesting.”\n\nREAD Ariana Grande Skips Grammy Awards for 5th Year in a Row\n\n“It's just a normal thing for vocalists,” she continued. “But people are like, ‘That's not her natural voice.’ And I'm like, ‘Well, it is actually, but it's just a little higher. All of it is natural.’”\n\nAnd considering Grande already clapped back at the online critics about her voice as Glinda the Good Witch in \"Wicked\" last year, she recognized that the comments may never end.\n\n“It's so funny because I’ve talked about it a zillion times,” she explained, “and people are still like, ‘Where's your real voice?’ And I'm like, ‘Well, they all are.’”\n\nBut despite the armchair analysis from fans online, the “Positions” singer is grateful for the parts of Glinda (née Galinda) she gets to take with her going forward, including her voice.\n\n“I think that might stay,” she told Variety in January of her higher register and crisper articulation. “Galinda required a lot of vocal work for me. Certain things maybe won’t melt away. Some will, but I’m really grateful for the pieces that will stay with us forever.”\n\nShe added, “What a beautiful thing to be left with, and to feel the ghost of every day.”\n\nAriana Grande spoke with Access Hollywood at the 2025 Palm Springs International Film Festival and spoke about being honored. The \"Wicked\" star also revealed what she's holding space for in 2025.\n\nPHOTOS Ariana Grande, 2018 Met Gala, Red Carpet Fashions",

        "source": "https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/",
        "content": "China retaliated immediately Tuesday as a 10% U.S. tariff on all Chinese goods went into effect, announcing a series of measures including its own levies of 10% to 15% on some U.S. products.\n\nStarting Feb. 10, China will impose an additional tariff of 15% on coal and liquefied natural gas and a 10% tariff on crude oil, agricultural machinery, large-displacement automobiles and pickup trucks, the government said.\n\nThe Chinese announcement came minutes after the U.S. tariff took effect at 12:01 a.m. ET, the only one to go ahead after President Donald Trump paused 25% tariffs he had announced on goods from Canada and Mexico.\n\nThe failure to forestall tit-for-tat tariffs with China raises the risk of a spiraling trade war between the world’s two biggest economies.\n\nGet top local stories in Philly delivered to you every morning. Sign up for NBC Philadelphia's News Headlines newsletter.\n\n“This unilateral tariff hike by the U.S. side seriously violates World Trade Organization rules, does nothing to solve its own problems, and undermines normal China–U.S. economic and trade cooperation,” the Customs Tariff Commission of the State Council, China’s Cabinet, said in a statement.\n\nThe U.S. reached an agreement with Mexico and Canada on Monday to delay a 25% tariff on all imports from the countries for one month.\n\nIn addition, Beijing announced an investigation into Google for alleged anti-trust violations, and export controls on items related to tungsten and other rare earth elements that are critical components of high-tech products.\n\nIt also said U.S. gene sequencing company Illumina and PVH Corp., the owner of Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger, would be added to the “unreliable entity list,” restricting their ability to operate in China.\n\nMainland Chinese markets remain closed for the Lunar New Year holiday. Other Asia-Pacific markets were mostly still up on news that the Canadian and Mexican tariffs had been put on hold, CNBC reported, though stocks in the Chinese territory of Hong Kong pared gains.\n\nBeijing said it had referred the U.S. tariff measures to the World Trade Organization “to safeguard its legitimate rights and interests.”\n\nThe additional U.S. tariff “seriously violates WTO rules and is an egregious act, representing typical unilateralism and trade protectionism,” a spokesperson for the Chinese Ministry of Commerce said.\n\nThe U.S. has blocked the appointments of appellate judges to the World Trade Organization since Trump’s first term, leaving it largely unable to mediate international trade disputes. But China could still use a lawsuit to gather international support against the U.S. tariffs.\n\n“The U.S. approach severely undermines the rules-based multilateral trading system, damages the foundation of Sino-U.S. economic and trade cooperation, and disrupts the stability of global industrial and supply chains,” China’s commerce ministry said.\n\nMany Chinese products are already subject to tariffs that were introduced by Trump in his first term and were maintained or in some cases expanded by former President Joe Biden.\n\nBeijing’s newly announced tariffs are more targeted than the U.S. tariff, which appears to apply to all Chinese products, and some may have more impact than others. China doesn’t import much crude oil from the United States, for example, while Google is blocked in China and has limited business in the country after withdrawing in 2010 over a censorship dispute.\n\nOthers could present more of a challenge. The U.S. imports about a quarter of its tungsten from China, which produces about 80% of the world’s supply, meaning there are few alternative sources. The critical metal is used by chipmakers such as Nvidia.\n\nChina’s tariffs are “largely symbolic” and will have limited impact on the U.S., said Tianchen Xu, senior economist at the Economist Intelligence Unit in Beijing, adding that they cover only 8.5% of all Chinese imports from the U.S. last year.\n\nThey also represent a change in approach from Trump’s first term, when China responded to tariffs more strongly. That is more difficult now as China struggles with an economic slowdown.\n\n“Trump wants a lot from the Chinese side, and he will launch one attack after another,” Xu said in an email. “China has no intent to escalate the conflict, given that any escalation will exert further pressure onto its economy.”\n\nTrump announced the 10% China tariff on Saturday along with 25% tariffs on goods imported from Canada and Mexico, citing border security, as well as the illicit international flow of drugs such as fentanyl. Though the Canadian and Mexican tariffs have been paused for 30 days after talks with those countries’ leaders, no such deal appears to have been struck with China.\n\nTrump is expected to speak with Chinese leader Xi Jinping “in the next couple of days,” White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said Monday.\n\nChina appears to be taking a different approach than Canada, Mexico and Colombia, all of which made concessions to the U.S. to avoid the immediate imposition of tariffs.\n\n“I would’ve waited to try to negotiate with Trump, because Trump might have avoided the tariffs for good if China had shown some compromise,” said Alicia Garcia-Herrero, chief economist for Asia Pacific at Natixis in Hong Kong.\n\nTrump said the 10% tariff on China was meant to pressure Beijing to stem the flow of precursor chemicals from China to Mexico and other countries, where they are processed into fentanyl and then smuggled into the U.S.\n\nThough the U.S. and China say Beijing has taken some action, China says the best way for the U.S. to solve its deadly fentanyl crisis is to reduce domestic demand and that tariffs could affect future cooperation on drug control.\n\n“Fentanyl is an issue for the U.S.,” the Chinese Embassy in Washington said in a statement on Tuesday. “In the spirit of humanity and goodwill, China has given support to the U.S.’s response to this issue.”\n\nTrump said Monday that the 10% tariff was just “an opening salvo.”\n\n“If we can’t make a deal with China, then the tariffs will be very, very substantial,” he said.\n\nThis article first appeared on NBCNews.com.

He was placed on administrative duty pending the outcome of an Internal Affairs and officer-involved shooting investigation.\n\nAn investigation is also underway with the Philadelphia District Attorney's Office.",

Just enjoying the moment.\"\n\nGraham later clarified that he needs to make it through this week of practice without any setbacks before a final decision is made but the Eagles' defensive hero from Super Bowl 52 appears ready for an improbable comeback.\n\nThe 36-year-old Graham was thought to be done for the season after he tore his triceps in a Nov. 24 game against the Los Angeles Rams. Graham was placed on injured reserve two days later, seemingly ending what he had called the final season of his career.\n\n\"When I got hurt, I saw it as a possibility,\" he said. \"I talked to people and they said it was a possibility. I rehabbed as hard as I could ... So when the time came they would give me the chance.\"\n\nRELATED: Eagles' Brandon Graham addresses possible return from injury reserve to play Super Bowl\n\nThat chance could come Sunday against Patrick Mahomes and the Kansas City Chiefs.\n\nGraham was on the losing side of the Super Bowl two years ago against Kansas City when he made little impact during his 18 defensive snaps on a slick field that made rushing the passer difficult for everyone.\n\nThe situation was very different five years earlier against New England when Graham's strip-sack against Tom Brady late in the fourth quarter thwarted a comeback attempt by the Patriots and helped deliver Philadelphia its first Super Bowl title.\n\nThat was the crowning moment in a 15-year career in which Graham set an Eagles record with 215 games played in the regular season and playoffs and his 82 total sacks rank third for the franchise.\n\nGraham is one of two position players and four players overall left from the Eagles' Super Bowl championship team in the 2017 season.\n\nGraham's return would provide an emotional boost but he hopes to deliver more than that. He had 3 1/2 sacks in his 11 games before getting hurt.\n\n\"If they didn't feel like I could bring something, they wouldn't waste their time activating me,\" he said.",

He also loves thrifting and hunting for treasure.\n\nSo, picture his surprise when he found a painting on the shelf at new Life Thrift in Glenside seemingly from 1864!\n\n\"It's kind of a nice watercolor. Had like a mill and a stream and a little guy fishing on a hill,\" said Andy.\n\n\"I was able to discern a signature and a date. Had Dorsey and 1864 on it. And white paint. From there, what I did is I pulled out my phone, took a look at it, looked it up.\"\n\nSo, he bought it for 10 bucks.\n\n\"I brought it home, posted on Instagram with some of the information that I had found and almost immediately, Machiko from 1838, Black Metropolis reached out to tell me more about William H. Dorsey.\"\n\nDorsey was an African American artist, scrapbooker and cultural historian living in Philadelphia in the late 1800s. He painted the watercolor in 1864 during the Civil War. And it's the only known painting Dorsey completed in existence.\n\nAndy knew this piece of living history was bigger than just himself and deserved to be shown to the world and studied. So, he donated it to the Historical Society of Pennsylvania.\n\nDavid Brigham from the Historical Society of Pennsylvania says, \"William Dorsey was 25 years old when he made this watercolor. So, he was young. He was aspiring, he went on to accomplish other things, including, playing an important role in the formation of the American Negro Historical Society. So, this painting, embodies those stories.\"\n\nFramed by his experiences of living through the Civil War, Dorsey's art and life is now taking on new appreciation.\n\nAndy says, \"It was something that was always bigger than what needed to be on my wall.\"\n\nDorseys work now where it belongs\n\nAll thanks to the eye of an art lover fishing it out of a thrift store.",

        "content": "Ellen Greenberg case: Bombshell decision in court over death investigation of Philly teacher\n\nPHILADELPHIA (WPVI) -- The City of Philadelphia settled two lawsuits Monday brought by the parents of Ellen Greenberg.\n\nThe Greenbergs have fought to change their daughter's suicide ruling for 14 years.\n\nJury selection began Monday for the civil suit, accusing the city of emotional distress for mishandling Ellen's death investigation. But before a jury was seated, both sides decided to settle.\n\nRELATED: Ellen Greenberg case: Major development in family's fight to change manner of death ruling\n\n\"Now the city has agreed that the current medical examiner will reopen Ellen's case and look at the evidence of her manner of death and come to their own conclusion,\" said attorney William Trask of Lamb McErlane.\n\nAn undisclosed monetary settlement is also part of the agreement. Both Trask and attorney Joe Podraza have fought alongside the Greenbergs for the past five years.\n\nIn 2011, Ellen was discovered stabbed more than 20 times in her locked Manayunk apartment that she shared with her fiancé, Samuel Goldberg.\n\nHer fiancé has never been suspected of foul play.\n\nDr. Marlon Osbourne , the pathologist who performed the autopsy, initially ruled it a homicide, then weeks later switched it to suicide.\n\nThe catalyst for the settlement may have been a verification statement filed in the courts this weekend by Dr. Osbourne.\n\nThe Greenberg family sued several Philadelphia city officials, claiming the investigation into the 27-year-old's death caused them emotional distress.\n\nDr. Osbourne stated in Saturday's filing, \"Since issuing the amended death certificate, I have become aware of additional information,\" and \"it is my professional opinion Ellen's manner of death should be designated as something other than suicide.\"\n\nThe Greenbergs spoke to 6abc inside City Hall.\n\n\"It's been 14 years we've been trying to clear Ellen Greenberg's name and we're very proud of her and we hope we made her proud of us today,\" said Ellen's mother Sandee.\n\n\"They did everything they possibly could to stand in our way instead of helping us,\" said her father Josh.\n\nDue to conflicts, the criminal case was kicked from the Philadelphia District Attorney's Office to the Attorney General's Office and then to the Chester County District Attorney's Office, with Chester County ultimately finding there was not enough evidence for charges.\n\nMonday's decision also impacts the first civil suit filed by the Greenbergs set to go before the State Supreme Court. That suit, which was also settled Monday, was to compel the city to change the determination from suicide to homicide or undetermined.\n\nThe City of Philadelphia released this statement in response to the settlement:\n\n\"A settlement agreement between the City of Philadelphia and the family of Ellen Greenberg has been reached to resolve the matter of Joshua M. Greenberg, D.M.D., et al. v. Sam P. Gulino, et al. The terms of the settlement include an independent review of the autopsy file, and an express waiver of any claims that might be brought as a result of that process.\"",

He was pronounced dead January 21.\n\nHis parents are now suing Walgreens, its parent company Boots Alliance and Optum Rx, the pharmacy benefits manager, for negligence.\n\n\"Defendant OptumRx had a duty to not artificially inflate prescription drug prices for medications such as Advair Diskus for insured patients, including Cole Schmidtknecht, making them so unaffordable that patients could not obtain the medications their physicians prescribed,\" the lawsuit said. \"Walgreens Defendants failed to exercise reasonable care in that they knew, or should have known, of the unreasonable risk of harm to asthmatic patients, including Cole Schmidtknecht, that would result from their failing to provide him with Advair Diskus or a medically equivalent alternative medication at an affordable price at the point of service.\"\n\nThe lawsuit comes less than two months after the assassination-style killing of United Healthcare CEO Brian Thompson, whose death renewed debate about how health insurance companies treat their customers.",

He also called for aggressive action to fight antisemitism on college c\n\nPresident Donald Trump could soon sign an executive order directing the secretary of education to dismantle the federal Department of Education, according to sources briefed on drafts of the order that have circulated among top administration officials.\n\nNOTE: The video is from a previous report.\n\nThe proposed order gutting the agency is expected to call for the education secretary to submit a proposal for dismantling the department and for Congress to pass legislation to get rid of it.\n\nThe timing on when Trump plans to sign the order remains unclear, but sources familiar with the process told ABC News that conversations about the future of the department have been actively occurring.\n\nPresident Donald Trump talks with CNN's Kaitlan Collins as he departs a ceremony in the East Room of the the White House, Monday, Feb. 3, 2025, in Washington. AP Photo/Alex Brandon\n\nClosing down the department would be an extraordinary move that would help Trump inch closer to fulfilling the promise that he made for months on the campaign trail: dismantling it and sending education policy back to the states.\n\nBut any executive action is likely to ask for a plan to shut down the department, but not an immediate directive to shut down the department, sources told ABC News.\n\nIts also unclear how the next education secretary would handle plans to close the department and reallocate its functions. Trumps education secretary choice Linda McMahon has not yet had a Senate confirmation hearing. A bill in the Senate to shutter the department would likely fail without a two-thirds majority vote.\n\nTrump and department skeptics have said they believe the agency has too much spending power -- more than $20 billion in the 2025 fiscal year -- without adequate academic results. from The Nation's Report Card highlighted the widening achievement gap and sliding reading scores for fourth- and eighth-grade students.\n\nTrump last week signed executive orders defending parental rights and prioritizing universal school choice, combating antisemitism and cutting federal funding for K-12 \"indoctrination.\"\n\nConservatives dating back to President Ronald Reagan have campaigned on the promise of closing the Education Department. It's also recently become a bicameral push from Republicans on Capitol Hill.\n\nThe news comes as dozens of Department of Education employees received letters placing them on administrative paid leave over the weekend as the department takes steps to issue unprecedented reform.\n\nTrump's rhetoric -- including threatening for months to shutter the department -- has now made some department employees worried about the agency's future, according to an employee who said they've been placed on administrative leave from their \"dream job.\"\n\nIt feels like it could happen, so its very disturbing, the employee said.",

Ferguson and his team, including art director Andrew, focus on creating designs that resonate with people on a deeper level, drawing inspiration from diverse influences like jazz, spoken word, and the symbolism of frogs as a metaphor for transformation.\n\nAll Caps Studio is also rooted in giving back to its community. In 2020, the brand used their platform to launch a Black Lives Matter fundraiser, raising over 100,000 for the cause through a single t-shirt design.\n\nAs All Caps Studio continues to grow, Ferguson aims to expand the brand beyond clothing, dreaming to create a space where local creatives can connect and collaborate.",

But in a crowd of 70,000 plus people that's not easy,\" explained father and son, Bill and Braden Wetzler of Newtown.\n\nThe ID and bank card happened to belong to Sarah Alexander. She lives in North Carolina but was up for the Eagles and Commanders game with her dad and sister.\n\n\"I hadn't realized I lost my ID and bank card until we got back to the hotel.

He's seen a lot of metal coming through his scrap metal operation over the years.\n\nThe Atco, New Jersey salvage operation has been in his family since World War II, operating mainly during the week as a scrap metal operation recycling center.\n\nIn the 80s, his grandparents built up a wide collection of military surplus aircraft and parts.\n\nPiles and piles of metal, scrap, vintage cars, schools buses, and old military aircraft are precariously strewn about the yard making for a unique and foreboding backdrop.\n\nSo much kept piling up, that when a production crew for Eddie and Cruiser's accidentally drove by the yard they immediately fell in love with the setting. They filmed most of the movie's climax there and cemented Wade's as a Hollywood destination for an awesome ready-made movie set.\n\n\"They got permission from my grandparents at the time to film here. They came back, built the set and were filming for a whole week. In the film, they're here for 10 minutes,\" Sharp remembers.\n\nThe family kept their connections with the movie studios and since then they've played host to a variety of filming locations looking for the perfect post-apocalyptic setting. And they've provided movies with plenty of props and items too.\n\n\"We have a good relationship with set decorators. They're looking for this or that for their show, I'll look for it and we'll send it out.\"\n\nThey've had many productions come out to shoot at the yard over the years such as Eddie and the Cruisers in 1983, Amazon's Fallout series released in 2024, and Apple Studio's Wolfs starring Brad Pitt and George Clooney coming out in 2024.\n\nAnd they've offered props to productions like Blacklist (2019-2023), The Walking Dead-Dead City (2023), Severance (2023, 2024) and Only Murders in the Building (2024).\n\n\"I watch TV with my wife, I can point out my props when I see them on the screen. I'll say that's mine, that's mine, that's ours! She hates watching TV with me,\" Sharp laughs.\n\nSharp says they host photo shoots there too. Plenty of cosplayers and folks looking to spark their imagination with an unforgettable background love taking pictures amidst the towering piles of trash and metal relics.\n\nThe public is welcome to visit by appointment only, usually on the weekends.

And the issues that fire and police were dealing with. Again, this is a very populated area.\"\n\n\"We had four homes destroyed, six received major damage, 11 received other damages,\" city officials told Action News on Tuesday, adding that \"343 homes were impacted in some way.\"\n\nPart of Cottman Ave. remains closed as the investigation continues.\n\nThe NTSB also released a photo of the plane's cockpit voice recorder (CVR) that was recovered from the impact site.\n\nNTSB releases an image of the cockpit voice recorder (CVR) of the Learjet 55 that crashed on Jan. 31 in Philadelphia NTSB\n\nThe crash Friday evening killed all six people on the Learjet 55 air ambulance, including a girl who had been receiving medical treatment at Shriners Children's Philadelphia hospital. A seventh person inside a vehicle was killed on the ground.\n\nMayor Cherelle Parker said two more people who were hurt on the ground have been identified, bringing the total to 24. Four people remained hospitalized Monday, two in critical condition.\n\nHowever, Mayor Parker says those numbers are subject to change as the investigation continues.\n\nParker also said footage of the crash has made her \"think about what could have been, had a gas line been hit.\"\n\nRELATED: Woman missing after plane crash in Northeast Philadelphia, sister says | Exclusive\n\nJet Rescue Air Ambulance said the plane had been taking Valentina Guzmán Murillo, 11, and her mother, Lizeth Murillo Osuna, 31, home to Mexico. It plummeted within a minute of taking off from Northeast Philadelphia Airport. Jet Rescue identified its team members as Dr. Raul Meza Arredondo, 41; the captain, Alan Montoya Perales, 46; the copilot, Josue de Jesus Juarez Juarez, 43; and paramedic Rodrigo Lopez Padilla, 41.\n\nValentina had recently completed treatment for a condition not easily treated in Mexico, hospital officials have said.\n\nDebris from the crash exploded into a fireball, and pieces of the plane were blown into the residential and commercial Northeast Philadelphia neighborhood, severely damaging several businesses. City officials said four homes were destroyed, six sustained major damage and 11 were otherwise damaged.\n\n\"It was a very steep angle at which that aircraft came down,\" Duffy said.\n\nRELATED: What can the 'black box' tell us about plane crashes?\n\nThe aircraft's cockpit voice recorder, recovered about 8 feet (2.4 meters) beneath the ground's surface, was on its way to be examined in Washington, D.C., Duffy said. He said the plane did not have a data recorder, but investigators are hoping to retrieve flight data from the jet's ground proximity warning system.\n\n\"Information can come off that device, whether it's the speed or location of the aircraft. We will be able to get some data, hopefully, off that device,\" he said.\n\nThe Philadelphia crash occurred two days after the deadliest U.S. air disaster in a generation, when an American Airlines jet with 60 passengers and four crew members collided in midair in Washington, D.C., with an Army helicopter carrying three soldiers.\n\nAudio recorded by LiveATC captured an air traffic controller at Northeast Philadelphia Airport telling \"Medevac Medservice 056\" to turn right when departing. About 30 seconds later, the controller repeats the request before asking, \"You on frequency?\" Minutes later the controller says, \"We have a lost aircraft. We're not exactly sure what happened, so we're trying to figure it out. For now the field is going to be closed.\"\n\nWATCH: New video gives closest look yet at site of plane crash in Northeast Philadelphia\n\nRAW VIDEO: The NTSB released video on Sunday that shows the site of the plane crash in Northeast Philadelphia from the ground and air.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.",

They laid down an irregular flagstone patio, framed with boulders and topped with colorful planters and a toasty propane fire pit.\n\nJustin Bates founded Bates Landscaping in 2011. He and his siblings had grown up working in their father's landscape business. Though Justin loved it, he he went to work in the restaurant industry as an adult, but soon found he missed working outdoors. So he cashed out his retirement savings, bought some tools and hired some workers.\n\nHe started out of his mother's garage in Lansdowne, mowing lawns for 8-10 customers.\n\nAs business grew, his brother, Dylan, came on board, and so did Melissa Blake. She is his lead designer, business development officer and wife. The two met working in that restaurant but she had a background in landscaping, with a degree from Penn State University and experience working at a tree care company.\n\nJustin's sister, Cailee works for the business too and so does Melissa's sister.\n\nTheir projects range from simple front yard renovations to give added curb appeal to total backyard transformations with water features and maybe a barrel sauna.\n\nIn February, they will participate in the the Philly Home + Garden Show for the first time. In their 30x30 space, they hope to show people how to maximize their outdoor space.\n\nWhile winter may not be the time most people think of lounging outdoors, they say now is the best time to call. It's when they're designing and sourcing materials for projects they'll complete in the spring.\n\nBates Landscaping | Facebook | Instagram\n\n705 St Marys St, Phoenixville, Pa. 19460\n\n484.887.8678 |info@bateslandscaping.net",

Within weeks of Trump taking office, Musk has shown he has a broad mandate to carry out his government efficiency initiative known as DOGE.\n\nOn Monday, Trump confirmed Musk has access to the Treasury Department's critical payment system, which sends out money on behalf of the entire federal government. Federal unions and others on Monday sued the Treasury Department over the access.\n\nTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent was inside the Oval Office as Trump commented on Musk's purview.\n\n\"Elon can't do and won't do anything without our approval. And we'll give him the approval where appropriate. Where not appropriate, we won't,\" the president said.\n\nMusk's business success has been partly fueled by federal money, and SpaceX has received billions of dollars in direct government contracts.\n\nAs a special government employee, Musk is covered by a federal conflicts-of-interest statute that prohibits government employees from participating in matters that would affect their financial interests. That law can be enforced criminally or in the civil context, but it can only be enforced by the Justice Department.\n\n\"We are relying on the Justice Department for enforcement of the financial conflict-of-interest standards against Elon Musk and everyone else, and there is a reason to doubt that the Trump Justice Department will enforce any statutes, including criminal statutes, against a Trump ally,\" said Kathleen Clark, a Washington University law professor who specializes in government ethics.\n\nThe designation also makes Musk subject to many government ethics standards, but not all of them.\n\nIt remains to be seen if Musk's designation requires him to file a financial disclosure that will be made public.\n\nAccording to the DOJ summary, special government employees \"may be required to submit a financial disclosure report within 30 days of assuming your position. If you are paid above the rate paid to a GS-15 and expected to serve for more than 60 days, you are required to submit a report that is made available to the public. If you are paid at or below that level, you must file a report on a confidential basis if your decision making could have an economic effect on a non-federal entity.\"\n\nMusk's link to Trump's agenda is affecting his outside business. After Trump announced he would impose a 25% tariff on Canada starting at midnight Tuesday, the Canadian province of Ontario said it was canceling a contract with Starlink, Musk's satellite internet service.\n\n(The-CNN-Wire & 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

        "content": "Sign up for our email newsletter to stay up-to-date on the latest local sports news throughout Philadelphia.\n\nThe Philadelphia 76ers are at home, in the middle of their six game home stand to host the defending NBA Champion Boston Celtics. Despite being severely undermanned, the Sixers had run off a four game winning streak before having it snapped on Friday night against the Nuggets in a game that was closer than anyone thought it would be. The Celtics are coming into Philly having won four of their last five games and eight of their last ten.\n\nSixers vs Celtics game information\n\nWho: Boston Celtics (34-15) at Philadelphia 76ers (19-28)\n\nWhen: 6:00 pm EST\n\nWhere: Wells Fargo Center, Philadelphia PA\n\nHow to watch: NBC Sports Philadelphia, NBC Sports Boston, ESPN\n\nLatest on the Sixers\n\nThe Sixers will once more be without three of their starters and three of their top reserves as they take on the Celtics Sunday night. Joel Embiid, Paul George and Caleb Martin have all been ruled out for the game along with KJ Martin and Andre Drummond, while Jared McCain is done for the remainder of the season. For a team that’s faced as many injuries as the Sixers have, the team has grown under the guidance of guard Tyrese Maxey.\n\nMaxey has been on fire of late and he’s taken the team with him. He’s clearly playing confident basketball again and is doing all he can with the players on the court. Over his last ten games, Maxey is averaging 33.4 points and 6.8 assists while shooting over 50% from the floor. He’s just been amazing for the team.\n\nJan 6, 2025; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA; Philadelphia 76ers guard Tyrese Maxey (0) reacts to his three pointer against the Phoenix Suns during the fourth quarter at Wells Fargo Center. Mandatory Credit: Bill Streicher-Imagn Images\n\nWith the “big names” missing so much time, the rest of the squad has really stepped up. Lately, Guerschon Yabusele, Justin Edwards, Kelly Oubre Jr., Ricky Council IV and most surprisingly, Eric Gordon have all been stepping up and growing in their roles. Oubre Jr. has been fantastic averaging 17.5 points and 7.7 rebounds over his last ten games. He’s taken on the role of Maxeys second in command and has been doing as much as he possibly he can for the team.\n\nYabusele and Edwards have provided energy, defense, hustle and scoring throughout the last few weeks. Edwards has been playing defense better than anyone would have expected out of an undrafted first year player while showing a fearlessness with his offensive game.\n\nYabusele has averaged 14.6 points and 6.5 rebounds over his last ten games. Against the Nuggets, he had 28 points, 7 rebounds and 3 steals while shooting 70.6% from the field and 57.1% on his three pointers. AS the season has gone on, Yabusele has played himself into a major role with the team.\n\nLatest on the Celtics\n\nThe Celtics are having another stroll through the regular season. They’re 34-15 on the season and in second place by five and half games to the Cavaliers, but it doesn’t seem like the Celtics care about that. They know what they need to do in order to win in the playoffs and the Finals, so they’re just playing their game and moving right along.\n\nDec 25, 2024; Boston, Massachusetts, USA; Philadelphia 76ers guard Kelly Oubre Jr. (9) dunks the ball against the Boston Celtics during the first half at TD Garden. Mandatory Credit: Eric Canha-Imagn Images\n\nJayson Tatum is having another great year leading the Celtics. Despite his shooting percentages being slightly lower than in previous year, Tatum is at the head of a team that features six players scoring in double figures. With 26.7 points, 8.9 rebounds and 5.5 assists per game, Tatum remains one of the best and most consistent players in the league. The rebound and assist totals, if they hold for the remainder of the season, would be career-highs for him.\n\nAfter you get past Tatum, you have to deal with Jaylen Brown, Kristaps Porzingis and Derrick White before you get down to Jrue Holiday and Payton Pritchard. The team can come at you in any number of ways, they have a top five offense and a top three defense. Brown is having another phenomenal year averaging 23.4 points, 6 rebounds and 4.8 assists while Porzingisi is overlooked despite averaging 19.7 points and 7.1 rebounds per game.\n\nOn the occasional off night for players like Tatum and Brown, the others have stepped up as they did in their recent win over the Bulls. With Tatum having a horrible shooting night and only getting 16 points, Porzingis stepped up with 34 points and 11 rebounds while Derrick White has 22 points and Brown had 28. The Celtics just have too many options to throw at teams and they keep on wining games.\n\nWhat to watch for tonight\n\nThe Sixers have been playing great basketball of late and are getting contributions from quite a few different players. The roster is limited and this game will be tough. However, it will be fun to watch Tyrese Maxey take on the Celtics as he did the Nuggets. If not to just show them that the Sixers aren’t going away and if they’re able to sneak into the playoffs and get healthy, they’ll be a real problem.\n\nDespite the small lineup, the Sixers should be able to get some points again from Yabusele as he’s been bullying his way through the post of late. The team will have a hard time with the Celtics’ balanced attack but with Maxey having drastically improved on defense, Yabusele and Justin Edwards will be pestering the Celtics offense and Oubre Jr. along with Eric Gordon can chip in as much as possible, they can make it a very tough visit to Philadelphia.\n\nPrediction\n\nSixers 126 – Celtics 122\n\nMandatory Credit: Kyle Ross-Imagn Images",

        "content": "‘Come From Away’ is on stage at the Academy of Music from Feb. 4 to 9.\n\nSign up for our Daily Email newsletter to stay up-to-date on the latest local news throughout Philadelphia.\n\nDuring a week dominated by tragic air travel news, the heartwarming true-story musical ‘Come From Away‘, created by composer-playwrights Irene Sankoff and David Hein, offers a welcome source of comfort.\n\nRunning at the Academy of Music from Feb. 4 to 9, courtesy of Ensemble Arts Philly and the Shubert Organization, the show recounts the remarkable events in Gander, Newfoundland, following the September 11 attacks. When 38 planes carrying 7,000 passengers were unexpectedly diverted to Gander Airport, the stranded travelers and the town’s compassionate residents formed lifelong bonds.\n\nHein and Sankoff transformed the real-life experiences of those who landed in Gander during the 2001 attacks—along with the deep connections rekindled at their 10-year reunion—into a musical filled with heart and humanity. They crafted composite characters, such as “Beulah Davis,” inspired by Newfoundland teacher Diane Davis and local volunteer Beulah Cooper, brought to life on stage by actor-singer Kristin Litzenberg.\n\n“I grew up in a household filled with music and theater, and my dad taught the marching bands at Upper Darby High School,” says Litzenberg in regard to catching the acting and singing bug early in her childhood. “I spent many a day and night seeing musical productions on Upper Darby’s Summer Stage, too. And while I didn’t follow my parents into a life of music education, it was because I wanted to be seen.”\n\nAnd seen beyond being an only child “with a large imagination,” practicing her favorite songs in her bedroom mirror, as well as singing in church and high school before set her sights on New York for more training and bigger productions. There, she landed roles in ‘Hello, Dolly!’, ‘Sister Act’, ‘The Pirates of Penzance’, and touring summer stock productions.\n\n“I was always off dancing and singing while my folks worked with the bands,” she recalls. “And I was constantly making up my own stories, too.”\n\nThe big story of ‘Come From Away’ suits Litzenberg — a mezzo soprano with a rich, powerful belt — bringing its lush musicality and deeply resonant lyrics to life.\n\n“I love a challenge in song, composers such as Sondheim and Jason Robert Brown. It’s fun to be able to park and bark and sing your face off, but, there’s just something to a great acting piece through song, and finding that acting through the lyrics. That really resonates with me.”\n\nThe challenge of ‘Come From Away’ stems, in part, from its small cast, telling the multitude of stories and the richness of emotion that came from that real life 9/11 setting, here portrayed in intricate harmony.\n\n“For this show, we were taught to use less vibrato, more straight tone singing and attention to detail and dynamics,” says Litzenberg. “A lot of the singing in ‘Come From Away’ can be underscore to when characters are speaking, so you’re making sure to bring out the words and music in a way that those telling the story can be heard loud and clear. And, of course, you want to bring the “Newfoundland sound” into the theater, something specific to Gander.”\n\nAs for the story of strangers becoming friends — or, as Litzenberg puts it, “ordinary people doing extraordinary things” — the actor and singer has met those involved in the real life events to better learn what everyone went through at that time.\n\n“I do not take lightly my relationship to the two women that I play in this production… It is still one of the most special things to happen in their lives — many of them continue to travel today to various ‘Come From Away’ touring productions around the country,” says Litzenberg. “That is such a testament to that town and that story, and all of this is really special.”\n\n‘Come From Away’ is on stage at the Academy of Music from Feb. 4 to 9.

Looking forward to the rest of it.”\n\nGoedert, the 49th pick in the 2018 NFL Draft, came to Philadelphia less than three months after the Eagles had won their first-ever Lombardi trophy in Super Bowl LII. Beloved tight end Brent Celek was expected to announce his retirement, and Philadelphia was in need of a new partner for Zach Ertz in their 12 personnel looks — that is a formation with one running back, two tight ends, and two receivers on the field.\n\nPHILADELPHIA, PA – NOVEMBER 03: Zach Ertz #86 of the Philadelphia Eagles celebrates with Dallas Goedert #88 after Ertz scored a touchdown against the Chicago Bears in the second quarter at Lincoln Financial Field on November 3, 2019 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

They’re so passionate, especially when the Eagles win. And it’s always cool to give back to the community. [To] come and see the people that support you every Sunday. I think it’s important, and it’s been a lot of fun.”\n\nIn 2023, Goedert had a chance to win his own Super Bowl when the Eagles faced, you guessed it, the Kansas City Chiefs. Their opponent then and now is not losses on the team, according to Goedert.\n\n“They’re the next opponent in our way of our ultimate end goal, but at the same time, they were the ones that knocked us off a couple years ago. Everybody remembers that. Everybody still feels the pain of that one. So we’re excited to go and get our get back.”\n\nThe sting of defeat lingers, even years later, but for Goedert and the Eagles, there are certainly reasons to believe the team is in a strong position heading into this matchup.\n\n“I feel really good. I feel really confident,” Goedert said. “I think we can win in so many different ways. Our defense is playing lights out. We’ve been creating turnovers. We’ve been really good holding on to the ball. So going to this game really confident, you know, as both teams should be, but I have a really good feeling about it, so it should be good.”\n\nPhiladelphia will have to make a decision this summer. Goedert’s current contract includes a potential out this offseason, which could open up nearly $7 million in cap savings should Goedert be released with a post-June 1 designation—meaning the decision could be made ahead of June 1 and officially processed after June 1.\n\nDec 1, 2024; Baltimore, Maryland, USA; Philadelphia Eagles tight end Dallas Goedert (88) spikes the ball after a touchdown during the first half against the Baltimore Ravens at M&T Bank Stadium.

But that is a trouble for another day. For now, the biggest game of Goedert’s life is just one week away. Winning the Super Bowl is certainly his primary focus, as it has been for years.\n\n“Winning the Super Bowl has been a dream of mine since I was a little kid, and dream of everybody in this whole city to win and one for the Eagles. But yeah, that’d mean everything to me. Once you get the first one, you’ll be looking forward to the second one, but I’m really looking forward to the first one right now.”\n\nWhile the possibility of an offseason split from the Eagles remains, so does the idea of finishing his career in Philadelphia, which is a welcome thought to Goedert.\n\n“I think it’d be really cool. Hopefully, [I] get to finish my career in Philadelphia. It’s been so good to me so far, and I think we’ve got a lot of good football left.”",

Following practice, Sixers head coach Nick Nurse addressed the media, providing the first fully positive update in recent memory.\n\nAmidst injuries to Joel Embiid, Paul George, Caleb Martin, KJ Martin, Andre Drummond, and Eric Gordon, the Sixers have had to roll out thinner and thinner rotations, seemingly as the year has continued. That time appears to be coming to an end based on Nick Nurse’s comments post-practice.\n\nJan 4, 2025; Brooklyn, New York, USA; Philadelphia 76ers center Joel Embiid (21) looks back during the first half against the Brooklyn Nets at Barclays Center.

See what the prognosis is for tomorrow.”\n\nSimple, succinct, and surprisingly positive.\n\nMore should be known as early as tonight and as late as tip-off tomorrow — always a great window — but it seems that several Sixers may truly be on their way back.\n\nThe Sixers will return to their home court tomorrow, beginning yet another back-to-back—first facing the new-look Dallas Mavericks on Tuesday and then potentially new-look Miami Heat on Wednesday. Considering the injury history of many of these players, the injury track record of this season, and the general narrative around back-to-backs and specific players like Embiid, there are obviously some added complications to the situation, but there remains the possibility of a return for some.\n\nDec 28, 2024; Salt Lake City, Utah, USA; Philadelphia 76ers center Joel Embiid (21) and forward Paul George (8) react to a play against the Utah Jazz during the fourth quarter at Delta Center.

And then again, I’m gonna concentrate on tomorrow’s game, and I’m sure after tomorrow’s game, we’re gonna have to evaluate it again, and the next morning, we have to evaluate it again, and then see what we got and go play.”\n\nIt doesn’t elicit the most excitement, but it does provide some semblance of hope that this team will become more normal bit by bit.",

Visitors looking for authentic experiences often find themselves in our vibrant neighborhoods, where small businesses play a crucial role in shaping that experience. Through this series, we hope to not only increase foot traffic to these businesses but also to inspire both visitors and residents with their stories of innovation and resilience.”\n\nAs a release notes, “Legacy & Love” is part of Visit Philadelphia’s “In Pursuit of A More Perfect Union” series, which showcases the city as a welcoming and inclusive destination while reexamining the evolving values of America’s founding vision. It’s also the beginning of an ongoing commitment to highlight and celebrate Black entrepreneurship in Philadelphia. Visit Philadelphia will continue to expand the series by featuring additional businesses throughout the year as well.\n\n“The Legacy & Love series is a powerful reminder of how entrepreneurship is woven into Philadelphia’s cultural fabric,” added Daniel Davis, director of diverse marketing at Visit Philadelphia. “We’re excited to use our platform to highlight these small business owners, sharing their stories and life’s work with millions of potential new customers through our social media channels and paid advertising efforts.”\n\nThe four businesses being highlighted include Paul Beale’s Florist from North Philadelphia, Vera Doyle in Mt. Airy, Hakim’s Bookstore in West Philadelphia, and Arterial Coffee in West Philadelphia.\n\nPaul Beale’s was founded in 1971 by Altermese Beale, and the family’s legacy continues today with Altermese’s daughter and owner, Paulette Beale Harris. Vera Doyle, on the other hand, was created by Lori Thomson (who was inspired by her mother) to showcase items from Black and women-owned brands and artists.\n\nHakim’s Bookstore was opened by Dawud Hakim, and made its mark as one of the first Black-owned bookstores in the U.S., it’s now owned and operated by his daughter, Yvonne Blake, and granddaughter Alana Rambera. And Arterial Coffee is co-owned by sisters Sharla and Sharaine Brown, and is meant to be a creative space that honors their family’s journey.\n\nThe series will explore a few different points from each business including: The challenges faced by previous generations in building their businesses, how their legacies have been passed onto future generations, and the ways current owners honor those legacies while forging their own paths.\n\n“I’m honored to be part of Visit Philadelphia’s Legacy & Love series,” finished Lori Thomson, owner of Vera Doyle in a statement. “Building my legacy in Philadelphia means honoring the city’s rich history of Black entrepreneurship and paying homage to my mother.

Luka Doncic being traded to the Los Angeles Lakers without requesting out of Dallas is, quite literally, one of the most shocking and unfathomable trades in the history of professional sports. It sets an awful precedent for a multi-billion dollar corporation that they can just blindside the second-best basketball player on the planet and backhandedly rub his name in the dirt on the way out.\n\nFor perspective, I despise the Boston Celtics just as much as the next Philadelphian, but if they erroneously traded away Jayson Tatum with no warning for Damian Lillard, I would feel quite similarly to how I do about this Mavericks debacle. You just do not mess with your homegrown, generational talents- and generational might be an understatement for Luka Doncic.\n\nIt did, however, get me thinking about some potential galaxy-brained Sixers trades that can no longer be considered stupid! This will in no way trigger anybody, and of course —insert wink here, everyone is going to understand that these are now very feasible and even possibly on the table!\n\nHere is what I came up with:\n\nPaul George and a 2031 first-round pick to OKC for Shai Gilgeous-Alexander\n\nThis one should be an easy conversation starter for Daryl Morey. The OKC Thunder have spent their entire franchise’s existence with a superstar on the roster. This trade might get rid of one superstar, but it also brings a superstar back that Sam Presti is already very comfortable with!\n\nJan 14, 2025; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA; Oklahoma City Thunder guard Shai Gilgeous-Alexander (2) drives for a shot past Philadelphia 76ers forward Guerschon Yabusele (28) during the third quarter at Wells Fargo Center. Mandatory Credit: Bill Streicher-Imagn Images\n\nThe dialogue should go something like this:\n\n“Hey, Sam, it’s Daryl. Remember that one time Paul George finished third in MVP voting while playing for the Thunder? I would argue that is the best basketball he has ever played in his career.”\n\n“Of course I remember, Daryl. Then, I was taken aback by having to ship him to the Clippers when I thought we had a really good thing going. It did not sit well with me. We are very happy with Shai, but I will not forget that embarrassment.”\n\n“Well, Sam, what if I told you that you have the chance to right that wrong today? I will give you Paul George back and even give you a first round pick because I like you, all we need is SGA.”\n\n“Done.”\n\nIt’s that easy!\n\nKelly Oubre and Eric Gordon to Phoenix for Kevin Durant\n\nThe Phoenix Suns are the NBA equivalent of the New Orleans Saints. They keep kicking the can down the road, trying to preserve a championship window that is not even open. This trade would help them finally reset their expectations and get ready for the next era of Suns basketball.\n\nJan 6, 2025; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA; Phoenix Suns forward Kevin Durant (35) controls the ball in front of Philadelphia 76ers guard Kelly Oubre Jr. (9) during the second quarter at Wells Fargo Center. Mandatory Credit: Bill Streicher-Imagn Images\n\nKevin Durant, Devin Booker, and Bradley Beal all have pretty redundant skill sets, and their favorite area of the floor to operate is in the mid-range. Take Durant’s age and injury concerns out of the picture and replace him with 2 guys who are unafraid to fire up three-pointers, and you may just get a more diverse offense!\n\nDevin Booker can go back to running the show, and Oubre can be the perfect running mate for him, especially on the defensive end of the floor. Really is a no-brainer for either side when you think about it!\n\nJoel Embiid to Denver for Nikola Jokic\n\nThe Nuggets won their first championship just two years ago, but after an epic meltdown in the Western semifinals last season against the Timberwolves, coupled with Jamal Murray‘s regression as a basketball player, this team obviously does not have what it takes to win anymore! They even got rid of Kentavious Caldwell-Pope for crying out loud!\n\nJan 31, 2025; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA; Philadelphia 76ers center Joel Embiid (21) reacts with Denver Nuggets center Nikola Jokic (15) after the game at Wells Fargo Center. Mandatory Credit: Kyle Ross-Imagn Images\n\nNikola Jokic deserves better! And what better way to elevate the man who elevates everyone else than to soup up the entire roster around him?\n\nTyrese Maxey has become what Nuggets fans expected Jamal Murray to develop into. Kelly Oubre Jr. might not be as good on paper as Michael Porter Jr., but he provides the team with all the same skills that Porter does, and he does it more consistently. For now, Caleb Martin is a better player than Christian Braun, and he’s a known playoff riser. Tell me the difference between Geurschon Yabusele and Aaron Gordon.\n\nThe Sixers would shoot more threes around Jokic than the Nuggets do, and their defense around Jokic would be better as well. And Jokic would finally provide the Sixers with the natural facilitator that they need. It makes all the sense in the world! Waiting on you, Calvin Booth!",

        "source": "https://metrophiladelphia.com/",
        "content": "Transgender protesters marched on NYU Langone in Manhattan on Monday night in fury after parents say the hospital is pulling the plug on gender-affirming care for children.\n\nTransgender pride flags ruffled in the night Monday as thousands of LGBTQ+ protesters and their supporters marched on NYU Langone Hospital in Manhattan after the medical giant pulled the plug on gender-affirming care for children.\n\nThe gathering at St. Vartan Park, located on 1st Avenue and 35th Street across the way from NYU Langone, stressed that the decision to deny such care to trans youth is a matter of life and death, and their fury hinged on the fear that struggling children could lose their lives to self-harm. NYU Langone’s decision came following an executive order that President Trump signed barring gender-affirming healthcare for trans youth.\n\n“I have a feeling that they don’t care, that what they are doing is literally killing people, every message that is trying to undermine our right to health care,” Jewish transgender activist and author Abby Stein told a legion of demonstrators on Feb. 3. “You choose our teens to be targeted — shame! You have blood on your hands!”\n\nIt wasn’t just the transgender community themselves who expressed outrage over the right-wing protocol taking hold in a liberal city; celebrities and medical staff also looked to raise their voices in support of their trans neighbors.\n\nActress Cynthia Nixon, known for her role in “Sex and the City,” grabbed a microphone and revealed that her transgender son underwent surgery at NYU Langone, telling the crowd that the doctors were kind and understanding. That the hospital reversed their policy on gender-affirming care left Nixon disturbed. .\n\n“The idea that this city is filled with young people who thought they had a place to go where they could receive the highest care, and that place has now been shut to them, sickens me — sickens me to my core,” Nixon said. “The last two weeks have been an assault, a barrage — so many horrific things coming at us from every direction. But since the inauguration, and I would say, actually since the election, nothing has made me feel so good as coming around the corner today and seeing you all standing here fighting for trans rights.”\n\nAfter speakers expressed their indignation, the thousands of protesters flooded out of the park and marched toward NYU Langone — only to be halted by cops who looked to stop them from descending on the medical center and inadvertently blocking emergency traffic.\n\nThings swiftly grew heated as protesters came face-to-face with officers. A scuffle unfolded as cops attempted to make an arrest, resulting in a tug of war as police and demonstrators pulled the arms of a protester as they wrestled over the arrest. Yanking one masked demonstrator, police dragged them before lifting them by the arms and legs and carrying them to a marked van.\n\nThe protest continued across the street from NYU Langone, where activists promised to return if the hospital did not reconsider their decision.\n\n“We cannot ever lose momentum, and we cannot ever allow fear to silence us, fear to keep us hidden. We have fought for so long to stand in the light of the sun, to dance in the dark night of the sky,” prominent transgender activist Qween Jean said. “Trans people will have respect.”\n\namNewYork Metro reached out to NYU Langone for comment and is awaiting a response. Prior to Trump’s order, the hospital gained national recognition for its gender-affirming care and support of the LGBTQ+ community.",

        "content": "Sign up for our Gay City News email newsletter to get news, updates, and local insights delivered straight to your inbox!\n\nRev. Dr. Bernárd Lynch, who did groundbreaking AIDS ministry in New York and London and who risked everything by speaking out for LGBTQ rights as an openly gay married Catholic priest, became a Freeman of the City of London at a ceremony at London’s Guildhall on Jan. 17, receiving an honor dating back to 1237, shortly after Magna Carta.\n\nThe “Freedom of the City of London” has been bestowed in more recent years on leaders from Franklin Roosevelt to Winston Churchill and Nelson Mandela to artists such as Ian McKellen and Judi Dench.\n\nLynch, 77, was surrounded by friends and family, including his husband, Billy Desmond, at the intimate ceremony supervised by the Ward Beadle and led by the clerk of the Chamberlain’s Court, Laura Miller, who explained its storied history and celebrated Lynch’s many achievements in civic and religious life, from Ireland to Africa to America to the UK.\n\nThe subsequent reception on Primrose Hill was attended by the Irish Ambassador to the UK, Martin Fraser, who read a letter of congratulations from Irish President Michael D. Higgins for this “apt recognition of your extraordinary contributions over many years for your efforts in advocating for equal rights, particularly for the LGBTQIA+ community, and individuals affected by HIV/AIDS.”\n\nIn reflecting on the honor, Lynch recalled his work in the early 1980s at the dawn of the pandemic leading an AIDS ministry for Dignity/New York at a time when people with the mysterious syndrome were being abandoned by their families, their government, and their churches.\n\n“When HIV/AIDS hit us with the force of a nuclear tsunami,” he told the assembled, “we learnt from the depths of our oppression that life is most radically about justice. While one can have justice without love, one cannot have love without justice.”\n\n“People pay for what they do,” he said, and few paid as dearly as Lynch for sticking his neck out with his Roman collar on. Lynch was persecuted by the Catholic Archdiocese of New York for working tirelessly with dying gay men, giving them affirmation and solace unavailable to them from the institutional church. He spoke of how Desmond recently asked him, “How did you keep going? You were the only priest that stood up for us! How did you find hope in the face of such tragedy and injustice?”\n\nLynch credits the unconditional love he got from his late mother and the support he got from his father, who just turned 100, when he was put on trial in the Bronx in 1990 on false charges that were thrown out of court and where he was exonerated. “This is where hope began,” he said as he went from the courtroom to “the hospital beds of my dying brothers.”\n\n“Where there is no love you put in love and there you will find love,” he said. “They taught me love” amidst “unspeakable grief.”\n\nHe continued that work in London, where he put down roots in 1991.\n\nAs for being honored in a country where he has lived now for 34 years and has not always felt welcome as an Irishman, he quoted President Higgins, who said during a state visit to the UK, “We British and Irish live in each other’s shadow.”\n\n“That shadow is made much brighter today,” Lynch said, “not just for me, for all minorities and for all the diaspora of every race, color, and creed.”\n\n“Freedom is ultimate,” he told RTE (Irish TV), “whether we’re talking about life or love or doing works of justice. We pursue [freedom] all our lives and I don’t think we ever catch up with it. But there are moments when we have more space to be who we are and to be accepted for what we’ve done… Anything that brings people together and allows people to celebrate their own humanity however that expresses itself is a great gift.”\n\nAmen to that, Bernárd Lynch.",

They have been capitalizing on their opponents’ mistakes at an absurd clip.\n\nThe Eagles scored 28 points off turnovers in the NFC Championship Game, upping them to +10 in takeaways for the postseason after finishing the regular season at +11.

Make it a habit,” linebacker Oren Burks told me. “It’s constantly being pointed out — you could have punched it here, you could have punched it there. Like, when that’s on your mind … you might get 500 punches and not get one out but you might get two and it might come out. That’s going to motivate you.”\n\nBurks has been on a personal tear, forcing a fumble on the opening kickoff in the wild-card round and employing his patented “peanut punch” on Austin Ekeler in the NFC Championship Game.\n\n“Perseverance is key because it might not happen early in the game,” Burks said. “But, like, when we need it, you gotta rely on it. It just comes down to finding a way to get it done. We just keep preaching it. Drill it over and over and over again.”\n\nRookies Jeremiah Trotter Jr., Will Shipley, and Jalyx Hunt are three names that frequently come up as game-changing presences at practices. They are masked menaces during ball-security drills, constantly poking at the pigskin and slinking their arms into tight spaces.\n\n“We want to win. We want to hit people. We want to be physical,” defensive end Jalyx Hunt told me. “And we want the ball … if you have that mentality, then you’re going to have our production.”\n\nBurks added: “The D-line has been awesome to play with, like Jalen [Carter] and all of them guys, make my job a lot easier, and we just have a great linebacker corps with Zack [Baun] and everyone in the back. Everyone’s together. Everyone’s on the same page. And you want to see one another succeed and that goes a long way.”\n\nVic Fangio Has Built Eagles’ New Culture, Feared Mentality\n\nMay 30, 2024; Philadelphia, PA, USA; Philadelphia Eagles defensive coordinator Vic Fangio during practice at NovaCare Complex. Mandatory Credit: Bill Streicher-USA TODAY Sports\n\nThe Eagles’ official postseason slogan has been “Let’s Hunt.” That catchy phrase has been plastered on everything, bedazzling team-branded hoodies on the sideline and captioning weekly hype videos. It’s a bit ironic, too, when you consider the stellar play of breakout rookie Jalyx Hunt. His sack on Matthew Stafford in the NFC Divisional Round put him on the national radar.\n\nFollowing the Eagles’ 55-23 dismantling of the Commanders in the NFC Championship Game, Hunt — five tackles in that one — was celebratory yet reserved at his locker stall as he reminded everyone that this team has business to finish in New Orleans.\n\n“This is what we expected, and where we expected to be, but this is not the goal,” Hunt said. “The Super Bowl is the goal, so super excited and we know we have to lock in and make the noticeable changes and things we have to change to do what we want to do.”\n\nHunt was quick to praise Vic Fangio for pelting that philosophy into the defense. The no-nonsense coordinator has resurrected the Eagles on that side of the ball, transforming them from one of the NFL’s worst units in 2023 into one of the best in 2024 — No. 1 in yards allowed (278.4), No. 2 in points allowed (17.8 ), No. 13 in sacks (41), and No. 6 in takeaways (26).\n\n“You gotta get the ball,” Hunt said. “We know that we have a firepower offense, one that is like unmatched. So if we can get them the ball back we feel as if we have a better chance of winning. And, we just got to get the ball. It’s a mandatory thing. Vic don’t like when we not doing that.”\n\nSpeaking of takeaways, the Eagles have 10 total turnovers through three playoff games this year: four interceptions, six fumbles. Fangio shifted his focus after the bye week when the team was sitting with a 2-2 record and -4 in the takeaway department.\n\n“Taking the ball away was a huge point of emphasis,” Oren Burks said. “I feel like you just have to have it on your mind and take the reps at it. And it’s just a mentality, like, okay, we find a way to take the ball away and you’re like playoff games aren’t given so you find a way to take the ball away. Same thing with that mindset.”\n\nMandatory Credit: Bill Streicher-Imagn Images",

Mandatory Credit: Bill Streicher-Imagn Images\n\nSign up for our email newsletter to stay up-to-date on the latest local sports news throughout Philadelphia.\n\nIt’s officially Super Bowl week as the Philadelphia Eagles and Kansas City Chiefs have both arrived in New Orleans, Louisiana ahead of their monumental rematch. Following Philadelphia’s 2-2 start to the regular season, it was difficult to envision the Eagles reaching this point in the postseason, yet here they are. Now the Eagles will attempt to get their revenge and stop the Chiefs from pulling off a historic threepeat as Super Bowl Champions.\n\nIn the latest edition of my Eagles mailbag, I’ll discuss Philadelphia’s x-factor in Super Bowl LIX, Kellen Moore’s potential replacement and much more regarding the team moving forward.\n\n@Cory_Nidoh asked, “Who is the biggest X-Factor for the Eagles in this game?”\n\nJan 26, 2025; Philadelphia, PA, USA; Philadelphia Eagles running back Saquon Barkley (26) runs with the ball against the Washington Commanders during the second half in the NFC Championship game at Lincoln Financial Field. Mandatory Credit: Eric Hartline-Imagn Images\n\nI might be taking the easy way out with this answer but it has to be Saquon Barkley, in my opinion. We’ve seen Barkley take over games at various points throughout this season, even when Philadelphia’s passing game has struggled. In the most recent matchups between the Eagles and Chiefs, Philadelphia’s rushing attack has still had it’s way with Kansas City’s defense. Now that they’ve added Barkley to the mix, it feels like he could be the true x-factor that can tip the scales in Philadelphia’s favor.\n\nThe Chiefs have struggled to slow down starting running backs in their two playoff games this season. Chiefs have allowed starting RBs to average 5.6 yards per carry this postseason, as both James Cook and Joe Mixon outperformed their regular season yards per carry against Kansas City in the postseason.\n\nJames Cook: 4.9 YPC during the regular season and 6.5 YPC against the Chiefs in the postseason.\n\nJoe Mixon: 4.1 YPC during the regular season and 4.9 YPC against the Chiefs in the postseason.\n\nConsidering that Barkley already averaged 5.8 yards per carry in the regular season, it’s mind-blowing to think about what he could potentially average against the Chiefs in Super Bowl LIX. It’s also worth noting that former Eagles running back D’Andre Swift averaged 6.3 yards per carry against the Chiefs in their regular season matchup last season. Chiefs defensive coordinator Steve Spagnuolo will certainly have his hands full with trying to slow down Barkley.\n\n@WhereEagl3sDar3 asked, “Do you think our defense is schematically better suited to challenge Mahomes and Reid than LVII?”\n\nNov 24, 2024; Inglewood, California, USA; Los Angeles Rams wide receiver Puka Nacua (17) runs the ball against Philadelphia Eagles cornerback Cooper DeJean (33) cornerback Quinyon Mitchell (27) and defensive tackle Jalen Carter (98) during the second half at SoFi Stadium. Mandatory Credit: Gary A. Vasquez-Imagn Images\n\nAbsolutely and I’m not sure that it’s close at all. In 2022, Philadelphia’s defense was very reliant on generating sacks and turnovers. Yet this year’s unit was dominant before they started forcing turnovers at a historic rate. Now that their poor turnover luck has turned in their favor, Philadelphia’s defense has truly become the total package.\n\nI was asked several months ago to rank Philadelphia’s defenses from 2017, 2022 and 2024. At the time, I ranked 2024 as the best unit of the three and I feel even more confident saying so right now. The additions of Quinyon Mitchell, Cooper DeJean, Zack Baun and Jalen Carter make this defense infinitely more talented and better prepared to stop Mahomes and Reid in Super Bowl LIX.\n\n@VladdyMuse asked, “How does Kellen Moore and Jalen Hurts avoid and read the Chiefs’ confusing defense (how should they handle the plethora of blitzes)?”\n\nDec 1, 2024; Baltimore, Maryland, USA; Philadelphia Eagles offensive coordinator Kellen Moore on the sidelines during the first half against the Baltimore Ravens at M&T Bank Stadium. Mandatory Credit: Tommy Gilligan-Imagn Images\n\nThe ultimate chess match in Super Bowl LIX will be Kellen Moore and Jalen Hurts’ plan against Spagnuolo’s unique pressure looks. Kansas City’s defense is able to generate pressure utilizing all sorts of personnel packages and pre-snap alignments. While Hurts has taken far too many sacks when blitzed this season, he has been efficient passing the ball compared to 2023.\n\nIn 2024, Hurts has completed 64.2% of his passes for 1,096 yards, eight touchdowns and just one interception when blitzed, according to Pro Football Focus. Which is drastically better than his performance last season, when he threw nine touchdowns and eight interceptions when blitzed.\n\nHurts struggled against Kansas City’s defense in 2023, as he completed just 53.6% of his passes for 83 yards, zero touchdowns and one interception against the Chiefs in Week 11. Spagnuolo’s defense was able to generate three sacks on just 15 snaps utilizing the blitz.\n\nLuckily for Hurts, Moore has helped Philadelphia’s starting quarterback take a step forward against the blitz this season. Look for the Eagles to utilize pre-snap motion to get Kansas City to tip their hand earlier than they’d like to on defense.\n\nMoore showcased some unique looks with handoffs to Dallas Goedert and pitches to DeVonta Smith in the NFC Championship Game, and we could very well see those utilized once again. If the Eagles are able to stress the Chiefs both horizontally and vertically, that will help minimize the threat of Spagnuolo’s unique pressure looks.\n\n@IamDSPN asked, “My brother expects a tackle eligible TD from Lane, I said Jordan but his point is a couple of unscouted looks should be in this game just as with the first SB win. What do you think?”\n\nNov 3, 2024; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA; Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Jalen Hurts (1) and offensive tackle Lane Johnson (65) high five after a Saquon Barkley (not pictured) touchdown run against the Jacksonville Jaguars during the second quarter at Lincoln Financial Field. Mandatory Credit: Bill Streicher-Imagn Images\n\nIt’s do or die time in the Super Bowl and there’s no reason to hold onto any potential trick plays that either team could have up their sleeves. While I wouldn’t necessarily expect the Eagles to throw a pass to an offensive lineman, I would keep my eye out for two plays, in particular. I believe would could see some type of fake tush push pass variation in Super Bowl LIX, especially in a third-and-short situation.\n\nI’d also watch for a bit more utilization of Philadelphia’s main three pass catchers as rushers. We saw Goedert and Smith both utilized in unique ways against the Washington Commanders in the NFC Championship Game. A.J. Brown had five carries for 70 yards, including a 49-yard touchdown during his time with the Tennessee Titans. Maybe we’ll see Brown get his first carry as a member of the Eagles on Sunday.\n\n@mrcrockpot asked, “Drums or flats for the Super Bowl?”\n\nThis might be my hottest take of all-time but I truly believe that bone-in chicken wings are severely overrated. I prefer boneless wings and believe they are far superior, even if people want to call them “chicken nuggets.” You can call them whatever you’d like to call them but they remain the must better choice of the two.\n\nIn fact, all meat on the bone is a significant waste of time and money. Don’t even get me started with steak, that’s an entire rabbit hole that I’d rather not go down. When I’m eating, especially while trying to watch an important sporting event, the last thing I want to worry about is where I’m putting leftover bones and doing extra work for a fraction of the amount of food than what I would get with a boneless wing.\n\nTherefore, my answer is neither. You can enjoy your drums and flats but I’ll be a man-child and enjoy my “chicken nuggets.”\n\n@willinoize asked, “Including Bobby Slowik, what other possible Kellen Moore replacements names should we keep an eye on?”\n\nJan 26, 2025; Philadelphia, PA, USA; Philadelphia Eagles head coach Nick Sirianni and offensive coordinator Kellen Moore during the first half in the NFC Championship game at Lincoln Financial Field. Mandatory Credit: Bill Streicher-Imagn Images\n\nAll signs are pointing towards Moore remaining in New Orleans after Super Bowl LIX and becoming the next head coach of the Saints. Therefore, the Eagles will now have to fill a void at offensive coordinator for the third consecutive offseason. I created a list of 10 potential offensive coordinator candidates last week, including former Houston Texans offensive coordinator Bobby Slowik.\n\nYet several of the names on my initial list are reportedly expected to land jobs elsewhere. Therefore, I wanted to share a few additional candidates that didn’t make my initial list. Grant Udinski is a 29-year-old native of Doylestown, Pennsylvania that currently serves as the assistant offensive coordinator and assistant quarterbacks coach for the Minnesota Vikings. Udinski has already interviewed for several offensive coordinator openings this offseason and would make sense as a potential target for the Eagles.\n\nCommanders quarterback coach Tavita Pritchard is another intriguing candidate to watch for. Pritchard is 37-years-old and spent over a decade coaching at Stanford before making the leap to the NFL with Washington in 2023. He is a former quarterback that helped Sam Howell, Jayden Daniels and Marcus Mariota exceed expectations with the Commanders. Given his time coaching at Stanford, Pritchard likely has a strong relationship with current Eagles quarterback Tanner McKee as well.\n\n@Michael93826345 asked, “Is there a possibility that Mekhi Becton plays guard in Philly until Lane Johnson retires and have him be the next RT and then have either Trevor Keegan or Tyler Steen at RG?”\n\nDec 1, 2024; Baltimore, Maryland, USA; Philadelphia Eagles running back Saquon Barkley (26) celebrates his fourth quarter touchdown with tackle Mekhi Becton (77) against the Baltimore Ravens at M&T Bank Stadium. Mandatory Credit: Mitch Stringer-Imagn Images\n\nThe curious case of Mekhi Becton will certainly be something interesting to monitor in free agency. If the Eagles view Becton as only a guard, then they might not be willing to meet the potential offers that he’ll receive in free agency. Yet if Philadelphia views Becton as their potential replacement plan behind Lane Johnson at right tackle, then that would drastically raise his value to the Eagles.\n\nI personally believe Becton has found a long-term home at guard, where he still doesn’t look fully comfortable at just yet. But it clearly seems like his best position given his struggles throughout the start of his NFL career at offensive tackle. If Becton moves on in free agency, Tyler Steen has already shown the ability to step in and play well at either guard spot this season.\n\n@shawnrob42 asked, “What do you consider the team’s needs by position heading into the 2025 draft?”\n\nJan 26, 2025; Philadelphia, PA, USA; Philadelphia Eagles linebacker Nolan Smith Jr. (3) reacts after a play against the Washington Commanders during the first half of the NFC Championship game at Lincoln Financial Field. Mandatory Credit: Bill Streicher-Imagn Images\n\nMany are fixated on the Eagles addressing edge defender early in the 2025 NFL Draft, yet I believe that position has fallen down Philadelphia’s list of needs quite a bit over the last two months, thanks to the play of both Nolan Smith and Jalyx Hunt.\n\nWhile Eagles general manager Howie Roseman will surely address several of the team’s projected needs in free agency ahead of the 2025 NFL Draft, here is how I would rank Philadelphia’s needs heading into the offseason:\n\nOffensive Tackle – Jordan Mailata and Lane Johnson form the best offensive tackle duo in the NFL. While Johnson swears he is going to play next season, he is 36-years-old and isn’t getting any younger. Tyler Steen appears to be more of a guard in the NFL, which means the Eagles don’t have a long-term answer at right tackle behind Johnson. Defensive Tackle – Jalen Carter is an absolute star, there’s no denying that. Jordan Davis will be heading into the fourth year of his rookie contract and Moro Ojomo has yet to play a starting role. Therefore, defensive tackle could be a major need following the potential loss of Milton Williams in free agency. Tight End – Dallas Goedert has played at a high level since returning in Week 18, yet he’s constantly injured every season. While Grant Calcaterra showed some potential during Goedert’s absence, he isn’t the long-term answer at tight end in Philadelphia. Given how strong the 2025 NFL Draft is at tight end, the Eagles would be wise to add one within the first two nights of the event. Edge Defender – Nolan Smith appears to be a rising star and Jalyx Hunt has already shown more promise than many expected to see during his rookie season. Josh Sweat is set to hit the open market and Bryce Huff was a major letdown in his first season in Philadelphia. The Eagles could move on from Huff in 2025 and look to add another young edge defender into the fold. Cornerback – This might seem crazy after the team added Quinyon Mitchell and Cooper DeJean in the 2024 NFL Draft. Yet Darius Slay’s days in Philadelphia are seemingly numbered and Isaiah Rodgers is set to hit free agency. Kelee Ringo and Eli Ricks haven’t exactly shown much in their first two seasons in the NFL either.\n\nMandatory Credit: Bill Streicher-Imagn Images",

Today, the departure of a truck signals that spring may be just around the corner. That is right, today the Phillies’ equipment truck departs heading southbound with the GPS set for Clearwater, Florida.\n\nBefore the cracking of bats and the smells of freshly cut grass and hot dogs fill the air, the smell of diesel and the shrills of a tractor-trailer’s engine will indicate the former is on the way.\n\n“Truck Day is always an exciting event, as it means we’re even closer to the start of Phillies baseball,” said Phillies Manager of Equipment & Umpire Services Dan O’Rourke. “Thanks to Citizens, our equipment truck will be dressed for the occasion, providing fun sightings for fans as it makes its 1,058-mile journey from Philadelphia to its final spring training destination.”\n\nMural Arts Philadelphia (Mural Arts), alongside the City of Philadelphia and Philadelphia Phillies, unveil the design of a new mural of MLB All-Star Dick Allen.

This comes after a slew of executive orders titled things like “Protecting the American People Against Invasion” and “Securing Our Border” were signed by the returning president.\n\nAlongside these executive orders, which grant broad powers to the national government to facilitate deportations, the Department of Homeland Security issued a directive that would allow ICE and CBP (Customs and Border Patrol) to raid sensitive areas such as schools and churches.\n\nPhiladelphia Councilmember-at-Large Rue Landau held a Trump Preparedness Hearing after these executive orders were signed. “In these last 48 hours, we have witnessed a wave of executive orders—orders that threaten to turn away vulnerable people who look to America for hope,” said Landau. “But Philadelphia has always been at its best when we stand together against injustice—our strength lies in our unity. And in the days ahead, we will need that strength.”\n\nLandau’s office told Metro after the ICE raid in Juniata Park, “Unfortunately, we knew as soon as Trump was elected that he would target immigrants in Philadelphia who are just trying to make a living. I’m grateful that community members and organizations are starting to mobilize toward a rapid response network, and I am working with others in City Council to ensure we are transmitting accurate and up-to-date information so people know their rights.\n\n“I will never stop fighting for our communities regardless of what Trump’s federal government tries to inflict on us.”\n\nLocal leaders came out to say that Philadelphians will not be targeted in their schools and places of worship, regardless of what the federal government says.\n\nOn Thursday, Philadelphia’s Archbishop Nelson J. Perez issued a statement regarding immigration saying, “Our area is home to many immigrants. Some are recent arrivals. Others have lived and worked here for years. All of them are our brothers and sisters. They were created in the image and likeness of God. They deserve dignity, respect, compassion, and fairness.”\n\nThe Catholic Social Services of the Archdiocese of Philadelphia primary mission is “to provide immigration legal services, education and protection to immigrants in Philadelphia and the surrounding metropolitan area.”\n\nSimilarly, on Friday Pennsylvania State Sen. Sharif Street hosted a press conference about the changes to federal immigration policy where he emphasized the safety of children in schools.\n\n“You can send your kids to school, the Philadelphia School District is not working to deport people,” said Street. “It harkens of racial profiling, no one can look undocumented.”\n\nRacial profiling has already begun as a byproduct of the changes in federal immigration policy. While getting a McDonald’s breakfast at the 40th Street location in West Philly, Adisa Bamigbaye, 25, an American citizen of Nigerian and Moroccan descent, was stopped and asked for his papers.\n\n“I see he had like police on his uniform but it doesn’t look like a regular police uniform,” Bamigbaye explained. “Obviously I haven’t been to the 1900’s but I was like ‘Wow this is how it felt back then they’re asking me for papers right now.’ This is crazy… It makes me think of people who are immigrants and are gonna have to go through this on a regular basis.”\n\nBamigbaye explained that he didn’t have papers. He asked if he was being detained and if he was being accused of a crime, refused to show ID, and asked if he was free to go.\n\nAlthough Bamigbaye is an American citizen, he followed the American Civil Liberty Union’s “Know Your Rights” guide to a tee inadvertedly.\n\nThe ACLU recommends that if stopped by an immigration officer, “You have the right to remain silent and do not have to discuss your immigration or citizenship status with police, immigration agents, or other officials.” In some states, you are legally required to tell law enforcement your name — but both Pennsylvania and New Jersey have no such law.\n\nThe ASPIRA Association, which is the largest nonprofit organization dedicated to Hispanic education in the United States, has a Philadelphia branch which operates in communities like Hunting Park, Olney, and Kensington. ASPIRA operates three charter schools in Philadelphia, each of them admit students without asking for their immigration status, report families to authorities, or allow ICE or Law Enforcement access without legal requirement.\n\nICE is granted permission to conduct Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO’s) under the The Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 Section 287(g) of the Immigration and Nationality Act. This grants ICE the ability to “through the delegation of specified immigration officer duties — to enhance collaboration with state and local law enforcement partners to protect the homeland through the arrest and removal of aliens who undermine the safety of our nation’s communities and the integrity of U.S. immigration laws.”\n\nICE has partnered with 60 state law enforcement agencies around the country to conduct these removal operations, however no law enforcement agencies from Pennsylvania, New Jersey, or Delaware are a part of this program.\n\nPhiladelphia is now just begining to see the presence of ICE officers, they’ve been spotted in Juniata Park where the car wash raid took place, Adisa Bamigbaye encountered them in West Philly, and they tried to intimidate the owners of the Puerto Rican restaurant Boricua Restaurant #2 in Kensington.\n\nIn a message posted to social media, the owners of Boricua echoed the same message that the ACLU, ASPIRA, clergy, and public officials have been sharing — it has never been more important that immigrants to know their rights than in this second Trump presidency.\n\nResources for immigrants in our region can be found at:\n\nNationalities Service Center: 1216 Arch St 4th floor; 215-893-8400; nscphila.org\n\nHIAS PA: 123 S Broad St.; 215-832-0900; hiaspa.org\n\nWelcoming Center: 211 N. 13th St., 4th floor; 215-557-2626; welcomingcenter.org\n\nEsperanza Immigration Legal Services: 4261 N 5th St.; 215-324-0746; esperanza.us",

They held up their end of the bargain so now the grizzled veteran is making sure he’s on that flight to New Orleans.\n\n“Seeing him fly around at practice today was reassuring that he’s ready because he was out there working some guys today,” left tackle Jordan Mailata told reporters. “He looked like his old self again and it was pretty special that he would come back for us, for this moment.”\n\nAccording to linebacker Zack Baun, the Eagles set a goal to make it to the Super Bowl as soon as Graham tore his triceps against the Rams in a game on November 24. Everyone knew he was done for the rest of the regular season, although a postseason return wasn’t ruled out.\n\n“Our whole goal was to make it to the Super Bowl so BG had the chance to play and we held up our end of the bargain,” Baun said, “and, hopefully, he’s doing the same on his end, and getting ready to play.”\n\n“BG is so motivational,” defensive tackle Jalen Carter said. “He motivates everybody. So, just to see what he’s been through — and he’s been telling us, ‘Hey, get us to the Super Bowl. I’m going to be back here and I’m going to be playing with you guys.’ And just to see what he’s doing now, it’s amazing.”\n\nGraham broke the Eagles’ huddle down to end Friday’s practice. The move was an encouraging sign as well as a symbolic one, allowing him to get the final word in before the team boarded a plane for Super Bowl LIX.\n\n“He looked good. He was out there today flying around and talking mess,” right tackle Lane Johnson said. “I know he’s excited. Everybody’s excited for him. Everybody knows what type of player BG’s been, someone that has consistently bounced back from adversity and so we’re all excited for him, very excited.”\n\nJalen Hurts Not Dwelling on Eagles’ Previous Super Bowl loss\n\nJan 26, 2025; Philadelphia, PA, USA; Terry Bradshaw interviews Philadelphia Eagles head coach Nick Sirianni and quarterback Jalen Hurts (1) after winning the NFC Championship game against the Washington Commanders at Lincoln Financial Field. Mandatory Credit: Eric Hartline-Imagn Images\n\nJalen Hurts wasn’t ready to detail his thoughts on the last Super Bowl he played in. The Eagles dropped that one 38-35 to the Chiefs, with Hurts famously keeping a picture of the red-and-white confetti dropping on his head as his cell phone’s lock screen. Hurts has moved on.\n\nWhen asked to share his most vivid memory from Super Bowl LVII, Hurts said: “Next question.”\n\nThe quarterback wasn’t trying to be rude. He just didn’t want to dwell on it.\n\n“It’s a business trip,” Hurts said, “and it’s an opportunity that we’ve worked for to have and we want to take advantage of it.”\n\nAnother reporter brought the previous loss up one more time, attempting to get a straight answer out of Hurts about how he moved on from it.\n\n“I moved on to the next season and prepared for that,” Hurts said. “Obviously, you have different motivations. You’re motivated by any time you come up short in anything and having that perspective, just trying to learn from all of your lessons. No shortcoming is bigger than the other, and you want to learn from them all.”\n\nLane Johnson Feeling Great, Not Ready to Retire\n\nDec 31, 2023; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA; Philadelphia Eagles offensive tackle Lane Johnson (65) reacts against the Arizona Cardinals at Lincoln Financial Field. Mandatory Credit: Bill Streicher-USA TODAY Sports\n\nLane Johnson has gone on the record multiple times saying how he wants to play another season or two. He’s under contract through the 2026 season after inking an extension in March 2023. Nothing has changed.\n\n“I’m definitely not retiring after this game, win or lose,” Johnson said. “I’m definitely playing next year so that’s really how you take it. When you get up in age, you take it one year at a time.”\n\nAge is just a number, especially the way the Eagles’ training staff takes care of their over-the-hill gang.\n\n“Physically, I feel a lot better than I have in the past couple of years,” Johnson said. “I feel really good. And, for being this late in the year, it’s usually not like that, so I’m thankful and we got a good team here to help us out with that [stuff].”\n\nMandatory Credit: Eric Hartline-USA TODAY Sports",

They have not scored a goal since their win over the New Jersey Devils on Jan. 27. This is the first time in franchise history that the Flyers have been shutout in three consecutive games in the regular season. The last time they were shutout in three consecutive games was during the 2002 Eastern Conference Quarter-Finals against the Ottawa Senators.\n\nThe Flyers ran with an 11-forward and seven defensemen lineup for Sunday’s tilt. Jacob Gaucher made his NHL debut for the Flyers, and Emil Andrae made his first appearance since Dec. 19 after being recalled from the Lehigh Valley Phantoms. During the game, defenseman Rasmus Ristolainen did not return for the third period.\n\nFlyers at Avalanche\n\nThe Flyers came out of the gates hot in the first period. The first 20 minutes ended 0-0, but the team set up some good offensive chances and outshot the Avalanche 10-6. Samuel Ersson made a few big saves on Colorado’s offensive threats. There didn’t seem to be any moping around following the Morgan Frost and Joel Farabee trade.\n\nDefenseman Samuel Girard scored near the halfway point of the second period to put the Avalanche up 1-0. Scott Laughton had a chance on the prior but missed wide. The Avalanche transitioned on a rush opportunity, and Girard beat Ersson for his third goal of the season.\n\nJan 29, 2025; Newark, New Jersey, USA; Philadelphia Flyers goaltender Samuel Ersson (33) makes a glove save against the New Jersey Devils during the first period at Prudential Center. Mandatory Credit: John Jones-Imagn Images\n\nWith 2:32 remaining in the second, Nathan MacKinnon doubled the Avalanche’s lead with a powerplay goal. Laughton was sent to the penalty box for a hooking call, and MacKinnon rifled a shot into the top corner, beating Ersson. Surprisingly, it was MacKinnon’s first powerplay goal in 44 games. It was also his 80th point of the season and he is the first player in the NHL this year to reach 80 points.\n\nDespite the Flyers starting the first period hot, they cooled down in the second, and the Avalanche took over.\n\nIn the third period, the Flyers’ offensive woes continued. They were given a powerplay in the final minutes of the period but weren’t able to generate any momentum. There were some late chances in the final 20 seconds, but the Flyers wouldn’t find any luck getting on the scoreboard.\n\nThe Avalanche hounded the Flyers defensively after taking the lead and walked away with a 2-0 win.\n\nJacob Gaucher’s NHL debut\n\nFollowing the Frost and Farabee trade, the Flyers called up Jacob Gaucher from the Lehigh Valley Phantoms. Gaucher impressed during training camp and has scored 27 points (14G, 13A) for the Phantoms this season. Against the Avalanche in his NHL debut, Gaucher recorded 8:08 of time-on-ice with two shots, one blocked shot, and one hit.\n\nUp Next\n\nThe Flyers will travel to the Delta Center for the first time to take on Utah Hockey Club on Tuesday. The puck is scheduled to drop at 9:00 pm EST. Newly acquired forwards Andrei Kuzmenko and Jakob Pelletier can make their Flyers debuts in Utah.\n\nMandatory Credit: Tim Fuller-Imagn Images",

So did he see his shadow?\n\nWhat did Punxsutawney Phil see?\n\nUnfortunately for those looking to get a head start on their warmer season plans, Phil saw his shadow, projecting for six more weeks of winter. Last year, Phil claimed an early spring was on the horizon. Over the past 10 years, he has been nearly split, calling for a prolonged winter six times to four projected early springs.\n\nHow often is Punxsutawney Phil right?\n\nAccording to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Phil has accurately reported the length of winter 30% of the time over the past 20 years.\n\nIn comparison, Staten Island Chuck in New York is accurate 85% of the time, and General Beauregard Lee is correct 80% of the time. Pennsylvania’s other groundhogs’ are somewhat successful — Octoraro Orphie (52.63%), Uni the Groundhog (47.37%) and Schnogadahl Sammi (38.89%).\n\nWhat exactly is Groundhog Day?\n\nThe beloved Pennsylvania tradition dates back to 1886. Every year, on Feb. 2, the Punxsutawney Groundhog Club visits Phil’s official home in Gobbler’s Knob. Once there, they try to wake up their furry friend Phil. Once Phil comes out of his home, an immense crowd of spectators excitedly awaits his next move. According to legend, if Phil sees his shadow, there will be six more weeks of winter, whereas if he doesn’t, then early spring is expected.",

On Sunday morning, The Eagles organization hosted a Super Bowl Send-Off Party presented by Triple-A, with the ticket proceeds benefiting the Eagles Autism Foundation.\n\nBefore the team took the stage, fans were treated to performances from the Eagles Cheerleaders and Eagles Drumline. Joy was on fans’ faces from sideline to sideline as many fans stepped foot on the turf between the white stripes or into the painted endzone for the first time. From 10-yard dashes to recreating DeVonta Smith’s toe-tapping sideline wizardry, Philly fans of all ages beamed in the excitement of being on the very field they’ve seen from the stands or on their television sets routinely over the last four months.\n\nMany “MVP” chants were serenaded towards Saquon Barkley as the team highlighted each playoff victory this season on the giant scoreboards inside the stadium. The loudest cheers were for those long touchdown scampers from #26, namely the first touch 60-yard dash in the NFC Championship win against Washington. There was also a lot of love for Philadelphia’s defense on the numerous turnovers that the Zach Baun-led unit has caused this playoff season.\n\nJan 26, 2025; Philadelphia, PA, USA; Philadelphia Eagles running back Saquon Barkley (26) celebrates after winning the NFC Championship game against the Washington Commanders at Lincoln Financial Field.

Graham, the longest-tenured member of the Eagles roster, is back on the field with the team, which reopened his practice window on Thursday. The NFL veteran’s message to the gathering of Eagles fans was clear and confident. “We are going to go get this win,” Graham said to the crowd. “Get ready for a party on Broad Street!”\n\nThe players led one final “Fly Eagles Fly” fight song and a loud “E-A-G-L-E-S” chant before sending the frigid but incredibly delighted fans home. The Eagles have completed their preflight checks and are ready to spread their wings and fly south for another Super Bowl fight against former coach Andy Reid. Philadelphia will practice at the New Orleans Saints practice facility next week prior to Super Bowl LIX against the Kansas City Chiefs in the Big Easy next Sunday.\n\nMandatory Credit: Bill Streicher-Imagn Images",

Mandatory Credit: Jayne Kamin-Oncea-USA TODAY Sports\n\nSign up for our email newsletter to stay up-to-date on the latest local sports news throughout Philadelphia.\n\nPHILADELPHIA— Heading into his fourteenth season in Major League Baseball, Bryce Harper has proven year in and year out he is one of baseball’s best.\n\nAfter another excellent campaign in 2024, Harper finished towards the top of most offensive categories. Parlaying his stellar defense at first base into a Gold Glove nomination, Bryce got it done on both sides of the ball. His Phillies finished second in the league in total wins, and Bryce Harper again shined in the postseason.\n\nDespite being excellent yet again, it almost felt like Bryce Harper got lost in the shuffle. Shohei Ohtani‘s arrival in the National League certainly stole the spotlight from the 2-time National League MVP. Strong seasons from Francisco Lindor, Ketel Marte, and rising star Elly De La Cruz often dominated the news cycle. Harper finished 6th in the National League voting for MVP this past season.\n\nEven though he played at such a high level in 2024, the Philadelphia Phillies are going to need Bryce Harper to be even better in 2025. With the Los Angeles Dodgers loading up on talent, the New York Mets adding Juan Soto, and the Atlanta Braves getting healthy, the Phillies are going to have their hands full this upcoming season. A storybook season out of Harper might be what Philly needs to get over the hump.\n\nOct 8, 2024; New York City, New York, USA; Philadelphia Phillies first baseman Bryce Harper (3) hits an RBI single in the eighth inning against the New York Mets during game three of the NLDS for the 2024 MLB Playoffs at Citi Field. Mandatory Credit: Brad Penner-Imagn Images\n\nThe Challenge\n\nIf you ask Bryce Harper what his goal for 2025 is, he will respond with a variation of “to win the World Series.”\n\nBringing a title home to Philadelphia has been something Bryce has spoken about since the moment he arrived in 2019. He came within two wins of that goal in 2022 and has become obsessed with overcoming the bar the Phillies have set.\n\nBeating the Dodgers, Mets, Braves, and all other National League challengers won’t be an easy task. LA won the World Series last season and has completely retooled their roster. It is not quite often you see a team coming off a championship add as much talent as the Dodgers have. Despite defeating Atlanta in the 2022 and 2023 playoffs, the Braves were not the same club in 2024. Injuries to their best players kept Atlanta from challenging Philly in the National League East. As much as fans wish to forget, the New York Mets did eliminate the Phillies in the Divisional series this past year. Adding Juan Soto makes New York that much more legitimate.\n\nIf they get past the N.L., the New York Yankees, Cleveland Guardians, Houston Astros, Texas Rangers, and other American League contenders will try to rise to the occasion.\n\nOct 6, 2024; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA; Philadelphia Phillies first base Bryce Harper (3) hits a two run home run in the sixth inning against the New York Mets during game two of the NLDS for the 2024 MLB Playoffs at Citizens Bank Park.

Harper’s quest in 2025 is simple in theory but not in execution. Bringing the third championship in the history of Philadelphia’s baseball franchise will be his quest.\n\nBryce was brought to the Philadelphia Phillies to bring the franchise back to its glory days. Harper has accomplished every other feat there is during his six seasons in Philly. A World Series championship with the Phillies is what takes him from Hall of Famer to baseball legend.\n\nWith Spring Training set to begin in just over a week, chapter one of this story begins. All will witness how 2025 unravels for not just the Philadelphia Phillies, but all of Major League Baseball. 30 teams set their sights on championship glory. Only one club gets to raise the Commissioner’s trophy when all is said and done.\n\nWill Bryce Harper overcome all odds and complete his story? Let the games begin.\n\nMandatory Credit: Jayne Kamin-Oncea-USA TODAY Sports",

The report reveals that hepatitis B and C are present across all residential ZIP codes, contributing to cases of premature death and cancer among residents.\n\nThe report shows that more than 48,000 residents are living with these viruses, however health officials say this likely underestimates the true number, as these conditions often have no symptoms and remain untested. Healthcare professionals urge every adult to be tested at least once in their lifetime for hepatitis C and hepatitis B. The decline in reported infections over the last decade reflects, at least in part, a lack of routine testing.\n\n“This report highlights the continued progress toward eliminating hepatitis B, C, and D from Philadelphia,” said Health Commissioner Dr. Palak Raval-Nelson. “Much work remains, however, and by coordinating efforts across Philadelphia we can eliminate the impact they have on the health of our residents.”\n\nhepatitis B\n\nAn estimated 1.6 percent of Philadelphians are living with hepatitis B — 666 people in 2023 had new hepatitis B infections, according to the report. Non-Hispanic Black residents represent the highest proportion of people living with hepatitis B. Asian and Pacific Islanders experience nearly ten times the rate of infection of White residents.\n\nThe report also shows that transmission is being seen among communities previously assumed to be vaccinated. As a result, health officials strong urge all adults 19-59 years of age get vaccinated for hepatitis B — a service that many healthcare providers and pharmacies throughout Philadelphia offer.\n\nhepatitis C\n\nIt is estimated that more than 51,000 Philadelphia residents have been diagnosed with hepatitis C since 2016, half of whom have been cured or cleared the virus thanks to treatment availability. More than 1,000 people in 2023 tested positive for hepatitis C for the first time, and they—along with nearly 25,000 others—still need access to treatment and supportive services.\n\nhepatitis D\n\nThis is the city’s first report that includes hepatitis D, and Health Department officials aim to better understand how to prevent the spread of hepatitis D with this and future reports.\n\nVaccination and treatment\n\nThe Health Department’s Viral Hepatitis Program urges all Philadelphians to learn about viral hepatitis and take steps to protect their health and their communities. This includes getting vaccinated for hepatitis B, getting tested for hepatitis B and C, and seeking treatment for hepatitis B or a cure for hepatitis C.\n\nThe Health Department, and partners like HepCAP and Hep B United Philadelphia, also have information and resources available at phillyhepatitis.org",

The eatery teased the public with a little pop-up preview last year, Dec. 20 to 22, and has been open on a limited-time basis lately.\n\nThis weekend, Cooper returned to the kitchen for an occasional star turn, with fans lining up to catch a glimpse of him in kitchen apron and black gloves.\n\nMatthew Paul Pomykala from Passaic, NJ, came by to try out the Bradley Cooper cheesesteak spot.\n\n“I heard that the cheesesteaks are good,” Pomykala said while waiting in line. “I’m excited to see if Bradley Cooper’s in there cooking food. It seems like a good place to go on a date on a Saturday morning.”\n\nCooper manned the griddle that day, helping several employees make cheesesteaks. The restaurant stayed open that day until it sold out.\n\nSome say the sandwiches truly are the star, packed with beef, onions, and Cooper Sharp American cheese (the brand is not related to the actor) on fresh-baked sesame seed buns made in-house.\n\n“It’s no surprise that the cheesesteaks at this narrow, counter-service spot are excellent,” is how TheInfatuation.com put it, thanks to the partnership.\n\nWorkers wear black Danny and Coop’s Cheesesteaks T-shirts with the company logo and prices visible on the wall. A cheesesteak at Danny and Coop’s costs $17.45, while a bottle of water costs $1.84.\n\nAlthough it’s still new, the restaurant already has 74,000 followers on Instagram happy to see an East Village restaurant star being born.\n\nAfter 11 reviews, the place has four out of five stars on Yelp, and the reviews will continue to flow.\n\nThe question is whether the shine will remain even if Cooper isn’t in the kitchen and whether the Philly cheesesteaks will be enough to keep crowds lining up on a New York City sidewalk, where the sandwiches may eventually become the stars.\n\nFollow instagram.com/dannyandcoops for details on their next shift.",

McGlynn’s first MLS goal came back in 2022 when he dazzled the crowd with his signature left foot from a free-kick against none other than his brand new team, Houston Dynamo.\n\nIn addition to gradually becoming a more important player for Union season by season, McGlynn has developed his game on an international level, representing the United States at the U16, U20, U23, and at the 2024 Summer Olympics. McGlynn netted his first goal for the USMNT on January 18th, 2025, against Venezuela.\n\n“We want to thank Jack for his dedication and contributions to the team, both on and off the field…Over the past three years, he has been a key part of our midfield, and we are incredibly proud of his growth. At this time, we believe this move is best for both the club and for Jack, allowing us to use the significant proceeds to reinvest and refine our roster, while placing him in an environment suited to his style of play and continued development. We have no doubt he’ll enjoy a successful career, and we look forward to following his journey.” – Philadelphia Union Sporting Director, Ernst Tanner Mandatory Credit: Philadelphia Union\n\nDetails of the Deal\n\nThe deal gets done utilizing Major League Soccer’s newly instated ‘cash for player trade’ rule, and is the first Homegrown cash trade transaction since the rule was recently introduced. Union will send the 21-year-old USMNT midfielder out West in exchange for a guaranteed $2,100,000, an additional $1,300,000 if certain performance metrics are met, and a significant sell-on percentage, which is reportedly around 50%.\n\nAdditionally, it’s been reported by Jonathan Tannenwald at The Philadelphia Inquirer that both NYCFC and New York Red Bulls each hold 20% of Jack McGlynn’s rights as a result of Union breaking Homegrown Rules back in 2019. What that essentially means is when Houston eventually sells McGlynn (hopefully to Europe for a big fee), they’ll split that fee 50-50 with Philadelphia Union. Of that 50% they receive, Union will then have to turn around and give NYRBs and NYCFC each 20% of their split.\n\nFor conversation’s sake, let’s say Houston sells McGlynn to Ajax for $10 Million Dollars (I’m not suggesting this is the fee McGlynn will sell for one day; it’s just an easy number for someone who is bad at math). Here’s how that money would break down, from my best understanding – which I’m admittedly still piecing together:\n\n$10 Million Fee\n\n50% to HOUSTON DYNAMO – $5 Million\n\n\n\n50% to Philadelphia Union – $5 Million\n\n–> 20% of Union’s $5 Million to NYRB – $1 Million\n\n–> 20% of Union’s $5 Million to NYCFC – $1 Million\n\n= $3 Million net fee for Philadelphia Union\n\nMandatory Credit: Philadelphia Union\n\nWhat does this mean for Union\n\nIf you’re a fan of the Philadelphia Union, I’m sure it’s hard to see Jack McGlynn leave, especially to another MLS team. He’s been one of the Union’s most promising homegrown players and is undoubtedly one of the favorites when you look around the stadium and take note of names on the back of fan’s jerseys.\n\nBut the simple truth is, Jack McGlynn’s style and skillset just don’t fit the intense, high-pressing system that Ernst Tanner wants Bradley Carnell to bring back into Union’s team in 2025. While he excels on the ball and has one of the best left-foot Union have ever had, he’s never been known as one of the fastest players on the pitch and has struggled to keep up defensively at times, which would likely be under the spotlight even more in 2025.\n\nThat leaves Union with a number of core options in the midfield – Daniel Gazdag as the everyday #10, A defensive-minded duo of Danley Jean Jacques and Jesus Bueno, veteran and leader of the team Ale Bedoya, and the creative Quinn Sullivan and his young phenom brother, Cavan, who will look to establish a more consistent role with the first team this season. Young prospects in CJ Onley, Nick Pariano, Jeremy Rafanello, and David Vazquez will be leaned on to add depth and fill in when needed this season, on top of any additional players Union brings in during this transfer window (One announcement expected shortly).\n\nMandatory Credit: Philadelphia Union\n\nGood move for McGlynn’s Career\n\nLikewise, for Union fans, I’m sure making the decision to leave Philadelphia and head out West wasn’t easy on McGlynn either, but I think it might be the right move for him. His stock is potentially higher than it’s ever been after a strong showing in the January USMNT camp, and the move to Houston gives him an opportunity to enter a team that not only has a starting position open for him but fits his style way better than Union’s ever did.\n\nFor Jack, this is a huge opportunity to showcase his skillset in a system that allows him to flourish, hopefully one day earning the move to Europe he’s always dreamed of.\n\n“Jack is one of the bright, young American talents in both MLS and the U.S. National Team player pool, and we look forward to his continued development in Houston. We expect him to thrive in our possession-oriented style of play, as Jack’s strengths match the attributes that we value in our central midfielders. With over 100 MLS appearances, he is a very proven player to occupy our fourth U22 Initiative spot on the roster. We are excited to welcome Jack to Houston as we push for a successful 20th Season.” – Houston Dynamo President of Soccer, Pat Onstad\n\nSep 14, 2024; Fort Lauderdale, Florida, USA; Inter Miami forward Lionel Messi (10) plays th ball defended by Philadelphia Union midfielder Jack McGlynn (16) in the first half at Chase Stadium.

(Photo by Elsa/Getty Images)\n\nSign up for our email newsletter to stay up-to-date on the latest local sports news throughout Philadelphia.\n\nAs the Philadelphia Eagles prepare to take on the modern-day NFL titan that is the Kansas City Chiefs, the Philadelphia Phillies will have to face a titan of their own this season in the Los Angeles Dodgers.\n\nDespite both teams sitting atop their respective divisions and owning high payrolls, there are obvious gaps in power that the Phillies will need to navigate if they want to find success in 2025.\n\nHow They Fared in 2024\n\nThere is zero confusion over who ran the table in Major League Baseball in 2024. Not only did the Dodgers claim the title of World Champion, but they owned the best record in MLB at 98-64.\n\nThe road to the World Series was not an easy one either for the Dodgers as they had to take down the division rival San Diego Padres (93-69) and the New York Mets (89-73) before facing the best team in the American League, the New York Yankees (94-68).\n\nWhile the Dodgers may have been the best team by record in MLB, the Phillies were not far behind them, in second overall sitting at 95-67. However, the National League East Champions were subject to an early exit in the postseason, losing to the Mets in the National League Division Series.\n\nComparatively, the Phillies and Dodgers both possessed top-five offenses in 2024. The Dodgers scored the second-most runs in baseball at 842 runs (5.47 runs per game) while the Phillies were fifth with 784 runs (4.84 runs per game). Defensively, both teams were relatively in the middle of the pack on the season with the Phillies and Dodgers being 12th and 13th respectively in runs allowed. The Phillies allowed 671 runs (4.14 runs per game) while the Dodgers allowed 686 (4.23 runs per game).\n\nWhen the two teams faced off in the regular season, the Phillies dominated. The Phillies went 5-1 against the Dodgers, keeping their top-five offense to 2.67 runs per game over the six-game set.\n\nPHILADELPHIA, PENNSYLVANIA – OCTOBER 24: Philadelphia Phillies principal owner John S. Middleton looks on during batting practice prior to Game Seven of the Championship Series against the Arizona Diamondbacks at Citizens Bank Park on October 24, 2023 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. (Photo by Elsa/Getty Images)\n\nOffseason Acquisitions Change the Game\n\nOn paper, the Phillies were neck-and-neck with the World Series Champs through the regular season. Once a team reaches the postseason, anything can indeed happen. In a game where the regular season is a 162-game marathon, it can be impossible to tell who is going to out-sprint the rest at the end of the race.\n\nAt the beginning of the offseason, the Dodgers had 11 players enter free agency: outfielders Teoscar Hernandez, Enrique Hernandez, and Kevin Kiermaier and pitchers Joe Kelly, Jack Flaherty, Blake Treinen, Walker Buehler, Daniel Hudson, Clayton Kershaw, Zach Logar, and Brent Honeywell. They have since re-signed Snell, Treinen, and Teoscar Hernandez.\n\nEssentially, the Dodgers have let go of two outfielders, two starting pitchers, and a handful of relievers. In their place, the Dodgers have added outfielder Michael Conforto, infielder Hyeseong Kim, starting pitcher Roki Sasaki, and relievers Tanner Scott and Kirby Yates. Oh, and Shohei Ohtani is almost certainly returning as a starting pitcher in 2025. So, to put it briefly, the World Series Champions have gotten a LOT better.\n\nMeanwhile, the Phillies have stagnated by comparison. Outfielder Austin Hayes and pitchers Spencer Turnbull, Carlos Estevez, and Jeff Hoffman all entered free agency in the offseason. In response, the Phillies signed outfielder Max Kepler and relievers Jordan Romano and Joe Ross, along with trading for starting pitcher Jesus Luzardo.\n\nWhile Luzardo is a definite improvement over Turnbull in the rotation, Romano’s value hinges on his return to form after an elbow injury. Ross will eat his fair share of innings in the bullpen but likely will not be in many high-leverage situations. Kepler could bring value out of left field for the Phillies or could be another warm body at the position, only time will tell.\n\nFollow the Money\n\nSo what is the main difference between the Phillies and Dodgers? Money, plain and simple. At the time of publishing, the Phillies’ 2025 payroll is set at $288 million, $100 million less than the Dodgers’ $380 million, per FanGraphs. To put the Dodgers’ spending into context, Yankees’ owner Hal Steinbrenner recently said in an interview on YES Network: “It’s difficult for most of us owners to be able to do the kind of things that they’re doing.“\n\nThat is right, Steinbrenner said it’s difficult to spend the type of money the Dodgers are spending. Having the Japanese market cornered with their triumvirate of Japanese starters in Ohtani, Sasaki, and Yoshinobu Yamamoto certainly helps, but the truth is few can compete with the cash the Dodgers’ ownership group is spitting out.\n\nAnd so, John Middleton will have to face off against the true definition of “stupid money” if he wants a chance to get his trophy back.\n\nWhen Will the Phillies and Dodgers Face Off?\n\nThe Phillies face the Dodgers right out the gate as they host them in their second series of the season on April 4-6. While statistics and conjecture can compare the two teams in a thousand ways, these three games will be the first true litmus test for where the two teams stand.\n\nInterestingly enough, the 2025 schedule has it such that the two teams will not meet again until the final 12 games of the season when the Phillies travel out west for their final road trip of the season. The three-game set on September 15-17 will show how the two teams stack up will a full season of wear and tear, just weeks before the postseason begins.\n\nPhoto by Elsa/Getty Images",

The two nations threatened retaliation of their own, raising the prospects of a broader regional trade war.\n\nIn a statement on X, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said that on a call with Trump he pledged additional cooperation on border security.\n\n\"Proposed tariffs will be paused for at least 30 days while we work together,\" Trudeau said.\n\nTrump’s tariffs\n\nFILE - U.S. President Donald Trump talks to reporters from the Resolute Desk after signing an executive order to appoint the deputy administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration in the Oval Office at the White House on January 30, 2025 in Wash Expand\n\nThe backstory:\n\nOver the weekend, Trump declared an economic emergency in order to place duties of 10% on all imports from China and 25% on imports from Mexico and Canada.\n\nMexico and Canada ordered retaliatory tariffs , though Mexico is holding off on theirs for the moment as security and trade talks continue between the two countries.\n\nThe Ministry of Commerce in China said it would file a lawsui t with the World Trade Organization for the \"wrongful practices of the U.S.\" and take measures to safeguard its rights and interests.\n\nImport taxes were still in place for Canada and China to begin on Tuesday.\n\nTrump posted on social media that he spoke Monday morning with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and would \"be speaking to him again at 3:00 P.M.\"\n\nTrump has promised more import taxes to come.\n\nRELATED: Trump tariffs on Canadian oil could impact these 3 US regions, gas analyst says\n\nDig deeper:\n\nTrump has said he was enacting the tariffs to take greater action against illegal drugs.\n\nHe said the tariffs would lift if Canada and Mexico did more to crack down on illegal immigration and fentanyl smuggling, though there are no clear benchmarks.\n\nTrump also said the U.S. can no longer run a trade imbalance with its two largest trade partners.\n\nBy the numbers:\n\nMexico is facing a 25% tariff, while Canada would be charged 25% on its imports to the United States and 10% on its energy products. China is facing a 10% additional tariff due to its role in the making and selling of fentanyl, the Trump White House said.",

        "content": "article\n\nThe Brief Brandon Graham could make his season debut in Super Bowl LIX. Graham, 36, tore his triceps late last season against the LA Rams. He is one of only two players leftover from the Eagles Super Bowl winning roster.\n\n\n\nAfter making it through his first week back at practice from a torn triceps, Brandon Graham is planning on playing in the Super Bowl on Sunday for the Philadelphia Eagles.\n\nWhat we know:\n\nThe 36-year-old Graham was thought to be done for the season after he tore his triceps in a Nov. 24 game against the Los Angeles Rams. Graham was placed on injured reserve two days later, seemingly ending what he had called the final season of his career.\n\n\"When I got hurt, I saw it as a possibility,\" he said. \"I talked to people and they said it was a possibility. I rehabbed as hard as I could ... So when the time came they would give me the chance.\"\n\nFeatured article\n\nGraham later clarified that he needs to make it through this week of practice without any setbacks before a final decision is made but the Eagles' defensive hero from Super Bowl 52 appears ready for an improbable comeback.\n\n\"I'm feeling good,\" Graham said Monday at the NFL's opening night. \"I’m excited to be able to play in this game. Just enjoying the moment.\"\n\nThe backstory:\n\nGraham was on the losing side of the Super Bowl two years ago against Kansas City when he made little impact during his 18 defensive snaps on a slick field that made rushing the passer difficult for everyone.\n\nThe situation was very different five years earlier against New England when Graham's strip-sack against Tom Brady late in the fourth quarter thwarted a comeback attempt by the Patriots and helped deliver Philadelphia its first Super Bowl title.\n\nThat was the crowning moment in a 15-year career in which Graham set an Eagles record with 215 games played in the regular season and playoffs and his 82 total sacks rank third for the franchise.\n\nGraham is one of two position players and four players overall left from the Eagles’ Super Bowl championship team in the 2017 season.\n\nWhat's next:\n\nGraham's return would provide an emotional boost but he hopes to deliver more than that. He had 3 1/2 sacks in his 11 games before getting hurt.\n\n\"If they didn’t feel like I could bring something, they wouldn’t waste their time activating me,\" he said.",

        "content": "article\n\nPennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro is expected to seek more money for public schools and public transit when he delivers his third budget proposal to lawmakers Tuesday. Shapiro is also expected to reprise his support for legalizing marijuana and introducing taxes on skill games viewed as competitors to casinos and lottery contests.\n\nShapiro's budget proposal could approach $50 billion for the 2025-26 fiscal year beginning July 1. He was scheduled to address a joint session of the General Assembly at 11:30 a.m. in the House of Representatives as he delivered the document to lawmakers.\n\nWhat we know:\n\nShapiro is under pressure from education allies and Democratic lawmakers to marshal billions more for schools in response to a court decision that found Pennsylvania’s system of public school funding violates the constitutional rights of students in the poorest districts.\n\nShapiro's budget delivered a substantial increase for schools this year, while lawyers for the schools that sued the state are asking for a $1.3 billion increase for the next fiscal cycle, or almost 13% more.\n\nShapiro also has said he'll seek tax breaks to subsidize the cost of building new power plants and more money for rural health care services. He also is expected to make another pitch to legalize marijuana to skeptical Republican lawmakers.\n\nMeanwhile, Shapiro has been adamant about preventing cutbacks by the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority, the Philadelphia region’s public transit agency struggling to regain ridership lost during the pandemic.\n\nThe other side:\n\nRepublicans resisted giving Shapiro his full request last year, prompting him to divert one-time federal highway funds to stave off near-term service cutbacks and fare increases. One Shapiro-backed idea to pay for it is taxing the skill games that are popular in bars, convenience stores, pizzerias and standalone parlors around the state.\n\nShapiro is up against numerous pressures.\n\nThese include entreaties to boost pay for workers who care for older adults and disabled people while also navigating growing deficit projections, a slow-growing economy and a shrinking workforce.\n\nWhat they're saying:\n\nCounties say the mental health services network they administer is on the verge of collapse and nursing home operators say they’re getting rid of beds because they can’t afford to staff them. Meanwhile, home care providers say it’s getting harder to find and keep workers, making it harder for people who need their services to receive them.\n\nDig deeper:\n\nShapiro does have a cushion of about $10.5 billion in reserve, thanks to federal COVID-19 relief and inflation-juiced tax collections over the past few years.\n\nHowever, this year's $47.6 billion spending plan required about $3 billion of surplus cash to balance, eliciting warnings from Republicans that the state must slow the pace of spending or risk depleting its surplus within several years.\n\nWhat's next:\n\nThe state is projected to bring in less than $47 billion in tax collections in the 2025-26 fiscal year — likely well below what Shapiro will propose in spending, especially after the state issues refunds.\n\nPassage will require approval from Pennsylvania’s Democratic-controlled House and its Republican-controlled Senate.",

Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, who is also a physician and sits on the finance committee , voted to advance Kennedy’s confirmation. Last week, during Kennedy’s hearings, Cassidy repeatedly implored Kennedy to reject a disproven theory that vaccines cause autism, to no avail. He ended the hearing by saying he was \"struggling\" with the vote.\n\n\"Your past, undermining confidence in vaccines with unfounded or misleading arguments, concerns me,\" Cassidy told Kennedy.\n\nThe backstory:\n\nKennedy, a longtime Democrat, ran for president but withdrew last year to throw his support to Trump in exchange for an influential job in his Republican administration. Together, they have forged a new and unusual coalition made up of conservatives who oppose vaccines and liberals who want to see the government promote healthier foods. Trump and Kennedy have branded the movement as \"Make America Healthy Again.\"",

Alan Alejandro Montoya Perales, co-pilot Josue de Jesus Juarez Juarez, Dr. Raul Meza Arredondo, paramedic Rodrigo Lopez Padilla, patient Valentina Guzman Murillo and her mother, Lizeth Murillo Ozuna.\n\nA seventh victim, a person inside a vehicle near the crash, was announced by Mayor Cherelle Parker during a press conference on Sunday.

This marks the eighth competitive Grammy win for the band and the first Grammy for a song using AI assistance.\n\n\n\nThe Beatles have won their eighth competitive Grammy Award, thanks in part to advancements in artificial intelligence. Their 2023 track \"Now and Then\" was awarded Best Rock Performance at the 2024 Grammys, beating out Green Day, Pearl Jam, The Black Keys, Idles, and St. Vincent.\n\nThe win marks a historic moment in music history, as \"Now and Then\" is believed to be the first Grammy-winning song knowingly created with AI assistance, according to Billboard .\n\nSean Ono Lennon accepted the award on behalf of The Beatles, honoring his father’s legacy during the Grammy ceremony.\n\nHow AI helped complete the song\n\nThe backstory:\n\nThe origins of \"Now and Then\" date back to the late 1970s, when John Lennon recorded a rough demo at his New York apartment. In the mid-1990s, Paul McCartney, Ringo Starr, and George Harrison attempted to complete the song for The Beatles Anthology project, but technological limitations prevented them from separating Lennon's vocals from the lo-fi piano track.\n\nSean Ono Lennon accepts the Best Rock Performance award on behalf of The Beatles for \"Now and Then\" onstage during the 67th GRAMMY Awards Premiere Ceremony at Peacock Theater on February 02, 2025 in Los Angeles, California. (Photo by Amy Sussman/Getty Images)\n\nFast-forward to 2021, and filmmaker Peter Jackson—known for \"The Beatles: Get Back\"—developed machine-learning technology capable of isolating and enhancing Lennon's voice. This allowed McCartney and Starr to finally finish the track, adding fresh instrumentals and harmonies to create what is now considered The Beatles' \"final song.\"\n\nDid AI create the song? McCartney clarifies its role\n\nWhat they're saying:\n\nWhen \"Now and Then\" was released in November 2023, some fans speculated that AI was used to recreate Lennon's voice. However, Paul McCartney quickly addressed the controversy, explaining that AI was only used to \"clean up\" existing recordings, not generate artificial vocals.\n\n\"To be clear, nothing has been artificially or synthetically created. It’s all real and we all play on it,\" McCartney said in 2023. \"We cleaned up some existing recordings—a process which has gone on for years.\"\n\nHow does this win compare to The Beatles' Grammy history?\n\nBy the numbers:\n\nThe Beatles won their first Grammy in 1965 for \"A Hard Day’s Night.\"\n\nThe band has now won eight competitive Grammy Awards, plus four lifetime achievement honors.\n\nTheir last competitive win was in 1997 for \"Free as a Bird.\"",

From there, they can choose between Same-Day Scheduled, On-Demand or Express, the company said. New or existing insurance plans are applied to the transaction as they would when picking up a prescription in-store.

To make same-day delivery of medications a reality, Walmart utilizes an AI-powered delivery platform called Spark. The platform uses a new geospatial technology to define delivery areas \"with greater precision\" using customer insights and external data, according to Walmart – rather than traditional metrics such as zip code or distance from the store.\n\nWhat they're saying:\n\n\"It’s an expectation now that you can have your groceries delivered – you can have everything you need delivered to your home,\" Bonnie Chandler, a pharmacy manager in North Little Rock, Arkansas, said in a press release. \"Your health care should be similar to that as well.",

The Philadelphia native announced he bought a new rare pet eagle named Saquon Barkley. The comedian previously bought a pet eagle named Jalen Hurts for Super Bowl LVII.\n\n\n\nPhilly native, Kevin Hart, is no stranger to eagles, both the NFL team and the animal.\n\nThe comedian revealed he’s got a new pet eagle named Saquon Barkley, and it may have cost him several million dollars.\n\nWhat we know:\n\nIn a video posted to Instagram Monday, Kevin Hart revealed he has a new pet eagle.\n\nKevin opened the video showing his first pet eagle named Jalen Hurts, which he says he purchased for $1.5 million back in 2023 when the Philadelphia Eagles took on the Kansas City Chiefs for Super Bowl LVII.\n\nThe actor revealed he had some issues with Jalen Hurts, the pet eagle, who he says mistook him for a rodent. After calling in trainers to get Hurts, the pet eagle, properly trained, Kev says they've got it all handled now. Kevin proclaims that Jalen Hurts the eagle now knows he’s ‘dad’,\n\nBut wait, there's more.\n\n'Like anything, all good things come in pairs,\" said Kevin Hart.\n\nThe camera then zooms out, showing another eagle behind him and next to Jalen Hurts, the pet eagle.\n\nThat's when the comedian says he dropped $12 million on a \"rare eagle with big legs\" and named it Saquon Barkley.\n\nThroughout the video, both pet eagles appeared to be making ‘dad’ nervous as they sporadically flapped their wings while in their trainers' hands.\n\nKevin then makes a cocktail called ‘The Barkley Hurts’ using his tequila brand, Gran Coramino, which he says is the official tequila of the Philadelphia Eagles.\n\nWhat we don't know:\n\nWe are unaware if Kevin actually bought these eagles as pets, but we won't put it past him or his over $39 million net worth, according to Forbes.\n\nWatch the Super Bowl LIX live & free!

        "content": "The Brief A federal judge will likely extend a temporary block on President Donald Trump's plan to freeze federal grants and loans. Last week, the White House rescinded the memo on the freeze, but they said Trump's executive orders on funding remained intact. The freeze could target a wide range of financial assistance including educational funding, diversity programs and the Green New Deal.\n\n\n\nA judge extended a temporary block on President Donald Trump’s plan to halt federal grants and loans, which originally targeted a wide range of funding totaling potentially trillions of dollars.\n\nU.S. District Judge Loren L. AliKhan extended an order she issued last week that paused a sweeping plan to freeze potentially trillions in federal spending. Earlier she expressed concern about nonprofit groups at risk of shutting down, even after judges ordered a halt to funding freezes.\n\nThe order on the federal grant freeze has sparked widespread confusion over the last week among Americans and organizations that rely on Washington and their financial lifeline.\n\nFederal funding freeze blocked\n\nThe backstory:\n\nLast week, AliKhan temporarily blocked President Donald Trump's freeze on federal grants and loans.\n\nThe judge blocked the action minutes before it was set to go into effect.\n\nUS President Donald Trump speaks to the press after signing an executive order in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington, DC on January 31, 2025. (Credit: Mandel NGAN / AFP via Getty Images)\n\nThen on Jan. 29, the White House Office of Management and Budget rescinded the Trump administration memo pausing federal loans, grants and other financial assistance.\n\nMemo rescinded, but executive order remains in effect\n\nWhat we know:\n\nAdministration officials insisted that despite the confusion, the order still had its intended effect by underscoring to federal agencies their obligations to abide by Trump's executive orders.\n\nThe White House confirmed that OMB pulled the memo Wednesday in a two-sentence notice sent to agencies and departments, but said that Trump's underlying executive orders targeting federal spending in areas like diversity, equity and inclusion and climate change, remained in place.\n\nWhat they're saying:\n\nFollowing the news, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt clarified that the rescission was on the memo itself, but not on the executive order.\n\n\"This is NOT a rescission of the federal funding freeze,\" she said on the social media platform X. \"It is simply a rescission of the OMB memo. Why? To end any confusion created by the court's injunction. The President's EO's on federal funding remain in full force and effect, and will be rigorously implemented.\"\n\nWhat is federal funding freeze?\n\nTrump issued a directive last week to temporarily suspend all federal grants and loans , a move that could impact trillions of dollars in government funding and disrupt vital public programs relied upon by millions of Americans.\n\nAccording to the White House memo, the suspension would begin on Jan. 28 at 5 p.m. EST. However, federal judge AliKhan temporarily blocked Trump's freeze minutes before it was set to go into effect.\n\nThe memo, written by Matthew J. Vaeth, the acting director of the Office of Management and Budget, said federal agencies would need to temporarily pause all activities related to obligation or disbursement of all Federal financial assistance including, but not limited to, \"financial assistance for foreign aid, nongovernmental organizations, DEI, woke gender ideology and the Green New Deal.\"\n\nRELATED: States report Medicaid outage amid federal funding drama\n\nAdministration officials said the decision was necessary to ensure that all funding complied with Trump's executive orders.\n\nAdministration officials said federal assistance to individuals would not be affected, including Social Security, Medicare, food stamps, student loans and scholarships.\n\nWhat they're saying:\n\n\"If you are receiving individual assistance from the federal government, you will still continue to receive that,\" Leavitt said. \"However, it is the responsibility of this president and this administration to be good stewards of taxpayer dollars.\"\n\nThe suspension specifically targeted financial assistance related to foreign aid, nongovernmental organizations, diversity and equity and the Green New Deal.\n\nHowever, the sweeping scope of the freeze raised concerns about possible disruptions to educational funding, with education programs potentially being impacted. It also became unclear Tuesday whether Medicaid would be affected.",

        "content": "The Brief President Donald Trump said over the weekend that he would impose steep tariffs on goods imported from China, Canada and Mexico. He then said on Monday that he will delay tariffs on Mexican imports for at least a month as Mexico has agreed to deploy its National Guard to control immigration and drug enforcement at the border. Tariffs are taxes imposed on imported goods that are paid by the importer. The purpose of a tariff is to raise the price of imported goods and encourage domestic production.\n\n\n\nPresident Donald Trump has said that he will delay tariffs on Mexican imports for at least a month as the country south of the U.S. has said they will reinforce the border with 10,000 members of the National Guard immediately.\n\nTrump announced last week that he would be imposing 25% tariffs on goods imported from Canada and Mexico, and a 10% tariff on all imports from China.\n\nThe tariffs were framed as a response to illegal immigration and fentanyl-related concerns but the Trump administration has said it will also apply to oil — a move critics say could cause gas prices to shoot up in excess of $0.20 a gallon, FOX Business reports.\n\nRELATED: How will tariffs affect grocery prices, gas prices, the stock market and more\n\nWhat is a tariff?\n\nThe Basics:\n\nTariffs are taxes imposed on imported goods that are paid by the importer. The purpose of a tariff is to raise the price of imported goods and services to discourage consumption and get people to purchase more local products to stimulate the nation's economy.\n\nThe idea is to encourage more local production so that imported goods can be replaced by domestic products, raising revenue for the government.\n\nAccording to a report featured in the Journal of Economic Perspectives, it is common for U.S. presidents to introduce protectionist measures — like heavy tariffs — early on in their terms.\n\nIn 2018, Trump imposed tariffs on $283 billion of US imports in 2018, with rates ranging between 10% and 50%. In response, several countries including China, Russia, Canada, Mexico and the EU all filed cases against the U.S. with the World Trade Organization. Many of those countries also retaliated with tariffs of their own.\n\nTrade war concerns\n\nWhat's next:\n\nOn Sunday, Canada and Mexico ordered retaliatory tariffs on American goods in response to sweeping tariffs imposed by Trump, and businesses and consumers in both countries questioned how the new trade war might affect them.\n\nCanada initially ordered tariffs of 25% on American imports starting Tuesday, including beverages, cosmetics and paper products worth 30 billion Canadian dollars ($20 billion). A second list of goods was to be released soon, including passenger vehicles, trucks, steel and aluminum products, certain fruits and vegetables, beef, pork, dairy products, aerospace products and more. Those goods were estimated to be worth 125 billion Canadian dollars ($85 billion).\n\nTrump and Mexico's President Claudia Sheinbaum Pardo then announced Monday that there would be a month-long pause on tariffs applied to Mexican imports in exchange for border enforcement, with10,000 members of Mexico's National Guard being deployed to reinforce efforts at the nation's northern border.\n\n\"Mexico will reinforce the northern border with 10,000 members of the National Guard immediately, to stop drug trafficking from Mexico to the United States, in particular fentanyl,\" Sheinbaum posted on X. \"The United States commits to work to stop the trafficking of high powered weapons to Mexico.\"\n\nCanada is the largest export market for 36 states, and Mexico is the largest trading partner of the U.S.\n\nThe Ministry of Commerce in China said it would file a lawsui t with the World Trade Organization for the \"wrongful practices of the U.S.\" and take measures to safeguard its rights and interests.\n\nConcerns over the tariffs impacted U.S. stocks Monday as financial markets worldwide dropped on fears of a potential trade war.\n\nThe S&P 500 fell 1.4% in early trading, mirroring losses in stock markets across Asia and Europe. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 435 points, or 1%, by 9:35 a.m. Eastern time, while the Nasdaq composite declined by 1.8%.\n\nThe market downturn affected a wide range of assets, from bitcoin to the Mexican peso, not just U.S. companies expected to be hit hardest by Trump's tariffs. On Wall Street, Big Tech and other companies vulnerable to higher interest rates experienced some of the sharpest losses.\n\nTrump has promised more import taxes to come.\n\nHow will tariffs affect grocery prices?\n\nBig picture view:\n\nThere is growing concern that Trump's tariffs will lead to higher prices for groceries, electronics, and various other household expenses. This could put upward pressure on the U.S. inflation rate, which has been gradually slowing since its peak three summers ago.\n\nJason Moser from The Motley Fool says the risk is in the longer Trump's tariffs go on. \"Mexico actually provides about half of the U.S. fresh produce imports annually. More than 80% of our avocados,\" he said. \"You might want to stock up on some tequila. Certainly, consumer electronics, bigger ticket items like cars. I think that's one to think about too given how connected that supply chain is between Mexico, Canada and the U.S.\" Moser told FOX 5 on Monday. \"I think the risk is on the longer this goes on, then we start seeing those price increases, perhaps we see supply chain interruption,\" he added.\n\nThe Associated Press said that in 2023, the U.S. bought more than $45 billion in agricultural products from Mexico – including 63% of imported vegetables and 47% of fruits and nuts. Agricultural imports from Canada that same year came to $40 billion.\n\nU.S. farmers are nervous that Canada and Mexico will retaliate by placing tariffs on American products such as soybeans and corn.",
