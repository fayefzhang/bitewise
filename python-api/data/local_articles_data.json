        "content": "La Salle's Fran Dunphy, who has won more than 600 games and made 17 NCAA Tournament appearances in 33 seasons as coach at three of Philadelphia's Big 5 schools, said Thursday he would retire at the end of the season.\n\nThe 76-year-old Dunphy will become special assistant to the president at La Salle. He will be honored as part of the Explorers’ game against Duquesne on Feb. 26.\n\nDunphy is ingrained in the Philadelphia hoops scene like few others. He played basketball at Philly high schools and went to games at the Palestra as a kid. He was co-captain under Tom Gola at La Salle and earned a master’s degree at Villanova.\n\nGet top local stories in Philly delivered to you every morning. Sign up for NBC Philadelphia's News Headlines newsletter.\n\nKnown as “Mr. Big 5,” his 623 wins are most by a coach in the history of the association of Philly schools that have played for city bragging rights since 1955.\n\n“I will forever be thankful to La Salle as well as all my fellow coaches and players that I’ve been fortunate to work with throughout my coaching career,” Dunphy said in a Feb. 20, 2025, news release. “I am looking forward to finishing this season strong with our team, and as I embark on the next chapter of my life. I could not be happier to stay at La Salle and work with President Allen, (athletic director) Ash Puri and this great University that I call home.”\n\nDunphy's first head coaching job was at Penn, where he won 310 games and 10 Ivy League titles and went to nine NCAA tournaments from 1989-2006. The Quakers won 48 straight Ivy League games from 1992-96, and his 1993-94 team went 25-3, was ranked as high as No. 24 and defeated Nebraska in the opening round of the NCAA Tournament.\n\nHe won 270 games and six regular-season or conference tournament championships and went to eight NCAA tournaments in 13 years at Temple.\n\nHe was out of coaching for three seasons before he returned to La Salle, his alma mater, in 2022. His first two teams had losing records, and this season the Explorers are 12-15 overall and 14th in the 15-team Atlantic 10 at 4-10.\n\nDunphy is a member of the Philadelphia Big 5, La Salle Athletics, Penn Athletics and Philadelphia Sports Writers Halls of Fame.\n\n“Fran’s impact on the sport of college basketball and the Atlantic 10 is immeasurable, with over 600 wins, including nearly 200 at an A-10 school,” Atlantic 10 commissioner Bernadette V. McGlade said. “He is an ambassador for this sport, whose professionalism and leadership will be felt by student-athletes, coaches, and administrators for years to come.\"\n\nClick here to see more reactions to Dunphy's pending retirement.",

He didn’t ask for no endorsement. He came there as a gentleman, and he left as a gentleman. Took maybe two minutes to introduce myself to him when he came in. And less than a minute when he left. Thanked him for coming. Appreciated him for coming. And that was it.”\n\nIn fact, Jones said, the event was never intended to be about endorsements, instead it was supposed to allow political candidates to come in, get petitions signed and meet with constituents.\n\nKrasner, Jones said, attended, though he had no petitions. He also said Dugan did not attend the event.\n\n\"That was the first time I ever met Krasner, he’ll tell you himself. He didn’t even know who I was. Somebody introduced me at the meeting, said this is your ward leader, Steve Jones,\" said Jones. \"At that time I was a ward leader. And I talked to him for about two minutes and that was it.”\n\nSince that event, Jones said, he has stepped down from the role of ward leader.\n\nHowever, Dugan released a statement on the weekend's event, claiming that Krasner was a \"good friend\" of Jones'. Dugan also claimed he was never invited to the political event.\n\n\n\n“That’s a lie,” Jones said. “I invited Dugan myself down at the Democratic Party last Wednesday.”\n\nTalking after a morning presser, on Monday, Krasner -- a two-term Democrat seeking a third term -- said he wanted to give Dugan until 2 p.m. to rescind his statement.\n\nContacted ahead of Krasner's press availability, Dugan's campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\n\n\nA spokesperson for Krasner’s campaign also told NBC10 neither Jones nor his former ward ever endorsed Krasner. He also said the campaign didn’t find out about Jones’ conviction until Sunday, Feb. 23. The spokesperson said they planned on calling for Jones’ resignation until learning that Jones had already stepped down.",

Kennedy's limousine after the president was shot, then was forced to retire early because he remained haunted by memories of the assassination, died Friday. He was 93.\n\nHill died at home in Belvedere, California, his publisher said. A cause of death was not given.\n\nAlthough few may recognize his name, the footage of Hill, captured on Abraham Zapruder's chilling home movie of the assassination, provided some of the most indelible images of Kennedy's assassination in Dallas on Nov. 22, 1963.\n\nHill received Secret Service awards and was promoted for his actions that day, but for decades blamed himself for Kennedy's death, saying he didn't react quickly enough and would gladly have given his life to save the president.\n\nGet top local stories in Philly delivered to you every morning. Sign up for NBC Philadelphia's News Headlines newsletter.\n\n\"If I had reacted just a little bit quicker. And I could have, I guess,\" a weeping Hill told Mike Wallace on CBS' 60 Minutes in 1975, shortly after he retired at age 43 at the urging of his doctors. \"And I'll live with that to my grave.\"\n\nIt was only in recent years that Hill said he was able to finally start putting the assassination behind him and accept what happened.\n\nOn the day of the assassination, Hill was assigned to protect first lady Jacqueline Kennedy, and was riding on the left running board of the follow-up car directly behind the presidential limousine as it made its way through Dealey Plaza.\n\nHill told the Warren Commission that he reacted after hearing a shot and seeing the president slump in his seat. The president was struck by a fatal headshot before Hill was able to make it to the limousine.\n\nZapruder's film captured Hill as he leapt from the Secret Service car, grabbed a handle on the limousine's trunk and pulled himself onto it as the driver accelerated. He forced Mrs. Kennedy, who had crawled onto the trunk, back into her seat as the limousine sped off.\n\nHill later became the agent in charge of the White House protective detail and eventually an assistant director of the Secret Service, retiring because of what he characterized as deep depression and recurring memories of the assassination.\n\nThe 1993 Clint Eastwood thriller \"In the Line of Fire,\" about a former Secret Service agent scarred by the JFK assassination, was inspired in part by Hill.\n\nHill was born in 1932 and grew up in Washburn, North Dakota. He attended Concordia College in Moorhead, Minnesota, served in the Army and worked as a railroad agent before joining the Secret Service in 1958. He worked in the agency's Denver office for about a year, before joining the elite group of agents assigned to protect the president and first family.\n\nSince his retirement, Hill has spoken publicly about the assassination only a handful of times, but the most poignant was his 1975 interview with Wallace, during which Hill broke down several times.\n\n\"If I had reacted about five-tenths of a second faster, maybe a second faster, I wouldn't be here today,\" Hill said.\n\n\"You mean you would have gotten there and you would have taken the shot?\" Wallace asked.\n\n\"The third shot, yes, sir,\" Hill said.\n\n\"And that would have been all right with you?\"\n\n\"That would have been fine with me,\" Hill responded.\n\nIn his 2005 memoir, \"Between You and Me,\" Wallace recalled his interview with Hill as one of the most moving of his career.\n\nIn 2006, Wallace and Hill reunited on CNN's \"Larry King Live,\" where Hill credited that first 60 Minutes interview with helping him finally start the healing process.\n\n\"I have to thank Mike for asking me to do that interview and then thank him more because he's what caused me to finally come to terms with things and bring the emotions out where they surfaced,\" he said. \"It was because of his questions and the things he asked that I started to recover.\"\n\nDecades after the assassination, Hill co-authored several books about his Secret Service years with Lisa McCubbin Hill, whom he married in 2021.\n\n“We had that once-in-a-lifetime love that everyone hopes for,” McCubbin Hill said in a statement. “We were soulmates.”\n\nClint Hill also became a speaker and gave interviews about his experience in Dallas. In 2018, he was given the state of North Dakota's highest civilian honor, the Theodore Roosevelt Rough Rider Award. A portrait of Hill adorns a Capitol gallery of fellow honorees.\n\nA private funeral service will be held in Washington, D.C., on a future date.",

The mayor was a Navy veteran of World War II and built a long career as a civil engineer, according to a town profile. He was also married to his late wife, Mae, for 64 years.\n\nDuring his 2017 campaign, Perillo wore out two pair of shoes while walking door-to-door. At 93, he handed out more than 7,500 campaign flyers across Tinton falls, a town in Monmouth County of close to 20,000 people.\n\nEvery flyer helped. After the votes were counted, Perillo won his first election by just over 300 votes.\n\nPerillo's service garnered the attention of the state's governor, Phil Murphy.\n\n\"As a World War II veteran and mayor of Tinton Falls, Vito leaves behind an incredible legacy of service,\" Murphy posted to X.",

She was 88.\n\nShe died at home surrounded by her family, publicist Elaine Schock said in a statement. Flack announced in 2022 she had ALS, commonly known as Lou Gehrig's disease, and could no longer sing.\n\nLittle known before her early 30s, Flack became an overnight star after Clint Eastwood used “The First Time I Ever Saw Your Face” as the soundtrack for one of cinema’s more memorable and explicit love scenes, between the actor and Donna Mills in his 1971 film “Play Misty for Me.” The hushed, hymn-like ballad, with Flack’s graceful soprano afloat on a bed of soft strings and piano, topped the Billboard pop chart in 1972 and received a Grammy for record of the year. In 1973, she matched both achievements with “Killing Me Softly,” becoming the first artist to win consecutive Grammys for best record.\n\nGet top local stories in Philly delivered to you every morning.

Jesse Jackson who saw her as a sophisticated, bold presence in the music world and in the social movements of the time. Flack visited Angela Davis while she was in prison and facing charges — for which she was acquitted — for murder and kidnapping.\n\nFlack sang at the funeral of Jackie Robinson, major league baseball’s first Black player, and was among the many guest performers on the feminist children’s entertainment project created by Marlo Thomas, “Free to Be ... You and Me.”",

        "content": "The offseason gets a little shorter when you win the Super Bowl.\n\nAfter a 17-game season and a playoff run and a parade, the NFL Combine sneaks up on you a little bit. And now it’s already here.\n\nThe entire NFL world will again take over Indianapolis this week for the annual Scouting Combine and the Eagles will be there too. This time last year, the Eagles had decided to bring back Nick Sirianni but with some major changes to the coaching staff. This year? One of the big storylines of the offseason will be Sirianni’s upcoming contract extension after winning Super Bowl LIX.\n\nThe Eagles are riding high into this offseason but there are plenty of key storylines to follow this week at the combine:\n\nGet top local stories in Philly delivered to you every morning. Sign up for NBC Philadelphia's News Headlines newsletter.\n\nHearing from Howie and Nick\n\nHowie Roseman and Sirianni spoke right after the Super Bowl but haven’t done any mass interviews since. With how late the season ended and because the combine was rapidly approaching, the Eagles’ brass didn’t have any sort of end-of-the-season availability.\n\nSo there are plenty of questions about how the 2024 season ended but also plenty of questions looking ahead to this offseason. We’ll hear from both of them on Tuesday afternoon in Indy.\n\nThis will be our first time hearing from Sirianni since the Eagles promoted Kevin Patullo from passing game coordinator to offensive coordinator. And also our first time hearing from him since news became official that Kellen Moore and Doug Nussmeier were leaving.\n\nRoseman had a pretty incredible 2024 offseason that led to a resurgent year. Can he do it again? What are his top priorities for this offseason? There are several key Eagles set to be free agents.\n\nFree agency will kick off when the negotiating window opens at 4 p.m. on March 10. Until then, the Eagles have exclusive negotiating rights with all their pending free agents. That means players like Zack Baun, Milton Williams, Josh Sweat, Mekhi Becton and more.\n\nBasking in the glory\n\nThe Eagles will get to walk around with their chests puffed out a bit in Indy this week. They’ve earned that. The rest of the league will now be hunting the Eagles and that’s a different place to be for Sirianni — Roseman has been there before.\n\nBut there’s definitely a respect that comes with winning the Super Bowl and you’d imagine that beating up the Chiefs will garner even more.\n\nWhat will BG do?\n\nBrandon Graham entered the 2024 season expecting it to be his 15th and final season in the NFL. He got hurt in November but somehow returned from a torn triceps to play in the Super Bowl after missing just 2 1/2 months.\n\nGraham, 36, played well in Super Bowl LIX in limited action. After the game, he said he wasn’t ready to make a decision about his future, leaving the door open for a possible return. Of course, walking away as a champion after that storybook comeback has to be attractive.\n\nAt some point, the Eagles and Graham will need to figure this out. If he’s coming back, the Eagles will have to figure out the right salary. If he decides to retire, Graham has already said he wants to stay with the organization in some capacity.\n\nHearing from the rest of the league\n\nIn addition to hearing from the Eagles’ brass, we’ll also get to hear from some key decisions makers from the other teams around the NFL. Thirty of 32 NFL teams will have either their head coach or general manager speak in front of a microphone.\n\nBut don’t expect to see a big Kellen Moore press conference. The Saints usually choose to let their coach and GM speak to New Orleans reporters away from the crowds. But we could still hear something from Moore about departure from Philadelphia.\n\nPrepping for the draft\n\nOf course, the real reason the combine exists is to get ready for the NFL Draft. If you feel like you’re a little bit behind on draft prep, don’t worry. The Eagles have been working for a long time to get ready and they still have a couple months.\n\nThis week is a great opportunity to not just see on-field tests but also to meet (formally and informally) with just about all of the prospects in this year’s class. The Eagles got great early returns from their 2024 class and have been on a bit of a roll recently in the draft. They’ll try to keep it going in 2025.\n\nHere’s a reminder of where the Eagles’ picks this year:\n\nRound 1-32 (own pick)\n\nRound 2-64 (own pick)\n\nRound 3-96\n\nRound 4 (from Lions)\n\nRound 5 (from Texans)\n\nRound 5 (from Commanders)\n\nRound 5 (own pick)\n\nSubscribe to Eagle Eye anywhere you get your podcasts:\n\nApple Podcasts | YouTube Music | Spotify | Stitcher | Simplecast | RSS | Watch on YouTube",

        "source": "https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/",
        "content": "A side of Jalen Hurts we’ve never seen before, an underrated Eagles position coach and an outrageous snub on a list of the top 101 players in the NFL.\n\n\n\nIt’s crazy how suddenly the offseason kicks into gear when you play in a Super Bowl. The Combine is this week in Indianapolis, free agency is 16 days away and the draft is in just two months.\n\n\n\nHere's our 10 Observations as Philly continues recovering from the parade. It may take a while.\n\n\n\n1. One of the cool things about the Super Bowl aftermath has been seeing Jalen Hurts finally let his guard down and show his personality. And he’s got a hell of a personality, he just never lets anybody other than maybe coaches and teammates and his family see it. So for everybody else to get to see him show some true joy these last couple weeks in videos on the sideline with his teammates in the final minutes of the game, in the locker room during the post-game celebration, at the parade celebrating with a million Eagles fans and in various TV appearances and interviews, it’s been a real treat. This is a side of Hurts the public never saw from the day he got drafted in the spring of 2020 until after the Super Bowl nearly five years later. And it certainly has served Hurts well to hide his emotions and stay on that flat-line that allows him to compete and prepare at the highest level, with no interference from the emotional ups and downs that affect most athletes. But as important as that is to Hurts’ performance, seeing him laughing and smiling and carrying on and getting emotional with his teammates has been amazing. He never showed that side of his personality when he took the Eagles to the playoffs in his first year as a starter, he didn’t show it the first trip to the Super Bowl, he didn’t show it when he finished second in MVP voting. It took 40-22 over the Chiefs for Hurts to finally let everybody see a part of him that’s been suppressed for years. It was definitely worth the wait.\n\n\n\n2. Including regular season and postseason, Milton Williams had 7.0 sacks and Jalen Carter had 6 ½. This is the first time since sacks became an official stat in 1982 that two Eagles interior linemen had 6 ½ sacks in the same season. No other team this year had two interior linemen with at least 6 ½ sacks. Only one other interior linemen 25 or under had at least 6 ½ sacks this year – the Saints’ Bryan Bresee had 7 ½. The last team with multiple interior linemen with 6 ½ sacks in the same season was the 2002 Jaguars with John Henderson and Marcus Stroud. Zack Baun is definitely priority No. 1, but Williams is awfully close.\n\n\n\n3. To really understand just how terrific wide receivers coach Aaron Moorehead has been you have to start by looking at who came before him. From 2012 through 2019, the Eagles had six wide receivers coaches – David Culley, Bob Bicknell, Greg Lewis, Mike Groh, Gunter Brewer and Carson Walsh. And obviously part of it was talent, but it speaks volumes that between 2014, when Jeremy Maclin had his only 1,000 yard season, through 2021, the Eagles didn’t have a single wide receiver with 1,000 yards. But since Moorehead got here in 2020, everything has changed. A-Mo, the only coach remaining that Doug Pederson brought in, has done wonders with DeVonta Smith and A.J. Brown, who now deserve the mantle as best 1-2 WR combo in the NFL. We had so many years with bad receivers around here and just having one guy like DeVonta or A.J. would have seemed like a miracle a lot of those years. Having two? It’s no coincidence that in games both of them have played the Eagles are 51-10. And the only other team with two WRs who have averaged at least 12.5 yards per catch and 65 yards per game since 2022 is the Dolphins with Jaylen Waddle and Tyreek Hill and all that’s gotten them in the three years they’ve been together is no playoff wins (and none for the franchise since 2000). Moorehead, who played in the NFL for five years, has stabilized a position that was a train wreck for much of the last decade. Terrific teacher, terrific communicator, terrific motivator, and he’s definitely brought out the best in Smith and Brown.\n\n\n\n4. Jalen Hurts this year became the first quarterback since Joe Montana in 1989 to complete 75 percent of his passes in a Super Bowl while also averaging 13 yards per completion. Hurts was at 77.3 percent and 13.0 yards per completion against the Chiefs and Montana was at 75.9 percent and 13.5 yards per completion against the Broncos in Super Bowl XXIV, also at the Superdome.\n\n\n\n5. A.J. Brown is 27 and already has five career 1,000-yard seasons. The only players with more 1,000-yard seasons before their 28th birthday are Randy Moss and Mike Evans. Brown has 7,026 yards and a 15.8 career average. The only other players with 7,000 yards and a 15.8 average after six seasons are Jerry Rice, Calvin Johnson, Moss and Torry Holt.\n\n\n\n6. Jake Elliott is 10-for-11 in postseason field goal attempts from at least 40 yards. Every other kicker in Eagles history is 11-for-23.\n\n\n\n7. Three guys who deserve a ton of credit for how they handled the 2024 season are young d-backs Sydney Brown, Kelee Ringo and Eli Ricks. All three had significant roles on defense as rookies in 2023. Brown played 335 defensive snaps in 2023, Ricks played 301 and Ringo 199. And all three showed promise, Brown as a tough, physical safety, Ricks as a tall, rangy corner and Ringo as a speedy playmaker at corner. The Eagles and Cards were the only teams that had three rookie defensive backs playing 150 or more snapss a year ago and when the season ended, it was fair to assume that those guys would have increased roles in 2024, Brown after he healed up from his torn ACL on the last day of the regular season. But things change. All three came back and all three made the 53-man roster. But when you draft Quinyon Mitchell and Cooper DeJean, that’s a lot of reps that are no longer available in the secondary. So Brown dropped 335 snaps to 79 (after missing the first five games), Ricks dropped from 301 to 14 and Ringo from 199 to 112. That’s a net drop of 630 snaps – from 835 to 205. So how did they respond? Brown increased his special teams snaps from 15 per game to about 18 ½ and Ringo increased from 305 to 340, and both were excellent throughout the year on special teams for a Super Bowl championship team. Ricks’s special teams snaps dropped simply because he was only active for a handful of games. But all three handled what could have been a challenging situation like total pros and contributed where they could. If you don’t understand and embrace your role, no matter how big or small, you can’t play for Nick Sirianni. All three of those young d-backs did, and now they all have rings. And potentially bright futures as defensive backs, as well.\n\n\n\n8A. The Eagles have won more playoff games under Nick Sirianni than they won from 1961 through 1999.\n\n\n\n8B. Sirianni has won more playoff games in four years than Buddy Ryan, Rich Kotite, Ray Rhodes, Chip Kelly, Marion Campbell, Mike McCormick, Jerry Williams, Ed Khayat, Nick Skorich and Dick Vermeil combined in 41 years.\n\n\n\n9. Pro Football Focus listing Jalen Hurts as the 91th-best player in the NFL on their list of the top 101 players in the NFL is one of the dumbest things I’ve ever seen. And this is a ranking that includes the postseason. Among the players ahead of him are an edge rusher who had 8.0 sacks for a 4-13 team, a wide receiver who had the 31st-most yards in the NFL for a team that didn’t make the playoffs and a tight end who had the 14th-most catches among tight ends and a disastrous postseason. Just dumb.\n\n\n\n10. Here’s a look at every offensive coach Jalen Hurts has had since he was drafted by the Eagles in 2020. Just imagine what Hurts could accomplish if he ever had the opportunity to stay in the same system over a number of years. That’s a big reason Kevin Pattulo is now offensive coordinator. A new role, but that continuity is huge for Hurts.\n\nDoug Pederson (head coach, play caller, 2020)\n\nRich Scangarello (senior offensive assistant, 2020)\n\nAndrew Breiner (pass game analyst, 2020)\n\nMarty Mornhinweg(senior offensive consultant, 2020)\n\nNick Sirianni (head coach 2021-24, play caller first half of 2021)\n\nShane Steichen(offensive coordinator 2021-22, play caller second half of 2021)\n\nBrian Johnson (quarterbacks 2021-22, offensive coordinator, play caller 2023)\n\nKevin Patullo (pass game coordinator 2021-24, offensive coordinator, 2025)\n\nAlex Tanney (assistant QBs 2022, QBs 2023)\n\nMarcus Brady (senior offensive assistant, 2023)\n\nKellen Moore (offensive coordinator, 2024)\n\nDoug Nussmeier(quarterbacks, 2024)\n\nParks Frazier (passing game coordinator, 2025)\n\nTBA (quarterbacks, 2025)\n\nSubscribe to Eagle Eye anywhere you get your podcasts:\n\nApple Podcasts | YouTube Music | Spotify | Stitcher | Simplecast | RSS | Watch on YouTube",

        "content": "Philadelphia District Attorney Larry Krasner said that five more people will be charged after three people were injured when shooting erupted during an Eid al-Fitr event in April of last year.\n\nThis brings the total number of people charged in this incident to ten.\n\nIn discussing these new charges on Monday, Krasner said the incident was a \"wild shooting\" that terrorized members of one particular faith.\n\n“There were people running for their lives. There were people diving out of the way of bullets. Bullets were coming every direction. And, it was more than people shooting at people. It was more than the endangerment of individuals, for reasons that I think are obvious,\" Krasner said. \"It terrorized people of one particular faith who were celebrating a very sacred and important holiday.”\n\nGet top local stories in Philly delivered to you every morning. Sign up for NBC Philadelphia's News Headlines newsletter.\n\nIn investigating this case, officials said on Monday that law enforcement officials determined that one of the guns used in the shooting had been privately made.\n\nWhile, Krasner said, details were limited as the investigation on this case is ongoing, officials said they were able to trace the manufacturing of the privately produced firearm -- often called a \"ghost gun\" -- to the basement of a home in Delaware County.\n\nOfficials wouldn't say just where this basement was located, but they did say three adults and two juveniles have been charged on allegations that claim these individuals were making and selling firearms.\n\nThe three adults charged, Krasner said, were Chase Freas, 18, Nicholas Luciani, 26, and Shane Scott, 21.\n\nLuciani and Freas are currently in police custody, but Krasner said, Scott remains a fugitive.\n\n“Shane, turn yourself in. This will only get worse,” Krasner said. “It can only help you.”\n\nHow the shooting at a West Philly Eid al-Fitr celebration unfolded\n\nThe shooting happened at about 2:30 p.m. as about 1,000 people were gathered at the Clara Muhammad Square on 47th Street and Wyalusing Avenue around to celebrate Eid al-Fitr, which marks the end of the Islamic holiday, Ramadan.\n\nThe Philadelphia Masjid -- a local mosque -- is located near that park.\n\nLeaders of that mosque, on Monday, noted that individuals involved were not Muslim and were not involved in the celebrations for the day. Instead, they noted the shooting was likely tied to an incident that happened elsewhere but spilled into the mosque's celebrations for the holiday.\n\nPolice have since identified only one of the five people who were arrested on the day of the shooting -- Kahbir Oglesby-Hicks, 21, who has been charged with multiple firearm charges and evading arrest.\n\nThe other suspects that police arrested at that time were all juveniles -- two 15-year-old boys, a 16-year-old girl and a 16-year-old boy.\n\nOfficials have not yet released the identities of these juveniles.\n\nDuring the incident, officials said that officers at the scene observed two groups at the park shooting at each other.\n\nOfficials said responding officers apprehended a man -- Oglesby-Hicks -- along with two teen boys and a teen girl while they were running away from the scene.\n\nThose four suspects were stopped by the officers who recovered four weapons, investigators said.\n\nAlso that day, a police officer shot an armed 15-year-old boy in the left arm and leg. That boy was arrested, as well.\n\nIn discussing this incident, Krasner said the officer involved in that shooting -- who he didn't name, but noted was a woman -- was a hero who may have saved the lives of others by acting quickly when she fired on the armed teen.\n\n“She did the right thing,\" said Krasner. \"She was gutsy. She was courageous.”\n\nAlso, during last year's shootout a man in his 20s was shot in the stomach and a teen was shot in the hands, officials have said.",

(Noticias Telemundo)\n\nIn the Instagram post, Kardashian attempted to bring awareness to the case of Cantu, a death row inmate who was convicted of murdering his cousin and his cousin's fiancée. He was executed on Feb. 28, 2024. However, the image she used in her post was of a man who lives in Westchester, New York, and shares the same name as the inmate.\n\nGet top local stories in Philly delivered to you every morning. Sign up for NBC Philadelphia's News Headlines newsletter.\n\n\"The image was taken down almost immediately once the error was discovered,\" attorney Michael Rhodes said in a statement.\n\nA civil complaint filed Thursday with the Los Angeles Superior Court says Kardashian's mixup exposed Cantu \"to hatred, contempt, and/or ridicule.\"\n\n\"Kardashian published and disseminated false information about Cantu that was clearly untrue, erroneous, unfounded, shocking, scandalous, degrading, disgraceful, and/or shameful,\" it says.\n\nCantu, the complaint says, has suffered serious emotional damage, anxiety, post-traumatic stress, and \"loss of reputation.\"\n\nHe is suing for libel, slander, emotional distress, invasion of privacy, representing him in false light, and negligence. He is seeking compensatory and punitive damages in an amount to be determined in court.\n\nKardashian's lawyer said they would \"prefer to solve this without litigation, but of course will defend Kim as needed.\"\n\nGreg Sobo, Cantu's attorney, said given Kardashian's celebrity status and influence she should \"know the power of social media.\"\n\n\"For too long, we have seen social media cause devastating injuries to innocent victims,\" he said in a statement. \"Social media is too often abused to bully the innocent, incite harm, and injure our communities. Just like those who cause physical harm should be held accountable, those who cause injuries to innocent victims through social media must also be held responsible.\"\n\nHe described his client as a \"very private family man with two daughters\" who was grieving a loss at the time Kardashian made her post.\n\n\"As a result of the Kardashian abuse, Mr. Cantu’s privacy was destroyed at a most critical and sensitive time, and he has suffered very real trauma that will last a lifetime,\" Sobo said, adding that they took the matter to court after several failed attempts to reach Kardashian's team.\n\nThis story first appeared on NBCNews.com.

        "content": "Reuben Frank and Dave Zangaro bring back Stay or Go in 2025, trying to figure out the futures of every Eagles player on the roster.\n\nUp first: Quarterback\n\nIan Book\n\nRoob: The Eagles clearly like Book, who was here during the 2022 season and again late this year. He’s never going to play here, but he’s a smart guy who picks up the offense quickly and you could definitely see him going into coaching at some point, and it wouldn’t be surprising if it were here. The Eagles have been a real springboard for quarterbacks who’ve gone into coaching – Mike Kafka, Matt Nagy, G.J. Kinne, Josh McCown, Tee Martin, Thad Lewis and Doug Pederson all spent time as players with the Eagles and are now coaching. So Book may be here, but it won’t be as a player.\n\nGet top local stories in Philly delivered to you every morning. Sign up for NBC Philadelphia's News Headlines newsletter.\n\nVerdict: Goes\n\nDave: The Eagles brought back Book late in the 2024 season when Jalen Hurts was dealing with his concussion and he was even briefly on the active roster. Book has been with the Eagles in just two seasons and the Eagles have gone to the Super Bowl in both of them. Coincidence? … Yeah, probably. But the Eagles obviously liked Book enough to bring him back when they were up against it last year and he’ll still be a phone call away in 2025 if something happens again. But he’s a long shot to actually be on the roster to start the season. Book was a fourth-round pick in 20201 but has played in just one regular season game. He could have a future in coaching if he’s interested.\n\nVerdict: Goes\n\nJalen Hurts\n\nRoob: Tough one, but I do think Hurts will likely be back in 2025 for his sixth season with the Eagles. OK seriously, Hurts may already be the greatest quarterback in Eagles history – 160 touchdowns, six playoff wins, four playoff berths in four years as a starter, two Super Bowl trips in three years, a Super Bowl championship, a Super Bowl MVP – and he doesn’t even turn 27 until August. No quarterback since Davey O’Brien in 1939 and 1940 has started at least 10 games for the Eagles and retired having never played for another team. You never know what the future holds, but you’d love to see Hurts have a career like Ben Roethlisberger, Dan Marino, John Elway, Troy Aikman or Terry Bradshaw and spend his entire career with one team.\n\nVerdict: Stays\n\nDave: The Eagles are probably going to keep the Super Bowl MVP around for another season. There were plenty of questions about Hurts throughout the 2024 regular season and, honestly, the discourse around Hurts is exhausting. Is he elite? Is he top 10? Top 5? Who cares? Three of the best games we have ever seen Hurts play came in Super Bowl LVII, this year’s NFC Championship Game and Super Bowl LIX. Say whatever you want about Hurts but he shows up in the biggest moments. Does that mean he’s a perfect player? No, of course not. And it’s still fair to criticize him when he makes mistakes in the regular season. But the Eagles have a good quarterback who is happy to do whatever it takes to win. He’s the right guy for this team and he’ll soon have a Super Bowl ring for proof.\n\nVerdict: Stays\n\nTanner McKee\n\nRoob: McKee showed enough in his brief appearance vs. the Cowboys and his start against the Giants – four TDs, no INTs, 117.2 passer rating – that teams out there are going to call Howie Roseman just to get an idea what it would take to pry McKee loose. I can’t imagine the Eagles would get offered enough for Roseman to part ways with an awfully promising young quarterback, although if the offer was good enough you have to take it. But I also think McKee is too good to spend 2025 – his third NFL season – as a No. 3. Which brings us to …\n\nVerdict: Stays\n\nDave: Our suspicions about McKee were proven right in 2024. When the former sixth-round pick got a chance to play this season, he was really impressive. While he was inactive most of the season as the Eagles’ third-string emergency quarterback, Pickett in two games completed 30 of 45 passes (66.7%) for 323 yards with 4 touchdowns and 0 interceptions. He’s the second-best quarterback on the roster even though the Eagles never bumped him up the depth chart. I think he’s ready to be their backup quarterback going into 2025. Perhaps, the Eagles would trade McKee if the offer was good enough but they shouldn’t be in a hurry to get rid of the young and talented quarterback. We know the Eagles value the position and he has shown traits that are worth developing.\n\nVerdict: Stays\n\nKenny Pickett\n\nRoob: There’s a lot to like about the way Pickett played in the Dallas and Washington games. He got the ball down the field, threw a couple touchdowns, made good decisions and played very tough. Pickett is only 26, 15-10 as a starting quarterback and just two years removed from being a 1st-round pick and I’m going to guess that there’s a team out there that either plans to draft a quarterback and would like a smart veteran to begin the 2025 season as the starter while mentoring the young guy or already has an underachieving quarterback on the roster and wants a veteran to compete in training camp. If you’re Howie Roseman, you’re sitting there with two capable backup quarterbacks who have some value, and you don’t need two. So I’m thinking the Eagles trade Pickett for a mid-round pick, move forward with McKee as No. 2 and Howie has himself another pick, which would be more useful than having two backup QBs. Howie loves draft picks. I think he turns Pickett into one.\n\nVerdict: Goes\n\nDave: This is a tough one. I absolutely think the Eagles should be open to trading Pickett before the start of the season but I don’t have a lot of confidence that they’ll do it. They traded for Pickett before the 2024 season for a reason and he didn’t do anything to hurt their confidence in him. Part of the reason the Eagles traded for Pickett was because he had two years left on his rookie contract and now the Eagles are going into that second year. In 2024, Pickett completed just under 60% of his passes for 291 yards with 2 touchdowns and 1 interception. He was solid. Could the Eagles be opportunistic and trade Pickett after an injury somewhere in the league? Sure. But, for now, I think Pickett will be around to start the 2025 season. The Eagles are coming off a Super Bowl season and they’ll want the most important position on the field to be loaded.\n\nVerdict: Stays\n\nSubscribe to Eagle Eye anywhere you get your podcasts:\n\nApple Podcasts | YouTube Music | Spotify | Stitcher | Simplecast | RSS | Watch on YouTube",

He spoke one-on-one with Trump, former President Joe Biden, former Vice President Kamala Harris, former President Barack Obama, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and other key figures.\n\nHolt frequently traveled to areas hit by deadly hurricanes, tornadoes, wildfires and mass shootings.\n\n“He has led the network during some of the country’s most fraught and challenging times in the past decade,” Janelle Rodriguez, executive vice president of programming for NBC News, wrote in a message to staff. “Quite simply, Lester is the beating heart of this news organization.”\n\nHe has been named the “most-trusted television news personality in America” two consecutive times, according to polls from The Hollywood Reporter and Morning Consult. “Nightly News” is consistently a top television show each week, averaging around 7 million viewers.\n\nHolt also anchors “Nightly News: Kids Edition,” an Emmy-nominated digital newscast geared toward informing and educating children.\n\nHolt, who joined NBC News in 2000, took the helm of \"Nightly News\" from veteran broadcaster Brian Williams, who exited the show after drawing intense criticism for embellishing the details of a helicopter attack in Iraq. Holt was named permanent anchor of the flagship program on June 18, 2015.\n\nHolt arrived at the network after more than a decade at the WBBM-TV station in Chicago, where he served as the afternoon and evening news anchor. He started his television journalism career as a reporter at WCBS-TV in New York in 1981. The following year, Holt moved to Los Angeles to report for KCBS-TV (then known as KNXT) before heading back to WCBS in 1984.\n\nHe has received various industry honors, including Emmy Awards and, in 2019, the esteemed Walter Cronkite Award for Excellence in Journalism.\n\nThis article first appeared on NBCNews.com.

        "content": "Elon Musk’s cost-cutting team is eliminating jobs at the vehicle safety agency that oversees Tesla and has launched investigations into deadly crashes involving his company's cars.\n\nThe National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has cut a “modest” amount of positions, according to a statement from the agency. Musk has accused NHTSA of holding back progress on self-driving technology with its investigations and recalls.\n\nAsked about whether the cuts would impact any probes into Tesla, the agency referred to its statement that says it will “enforce the law on all manufacturers of motor vehicles and equipment.”\n\nThe Department of Government Efficiency, commonly known as DOGE, is an initiative led by Elon Musk with a goal to ”maximize governmental efficiency and productivity.”\n\nGet top local stories in Philly delivered to you every morning. Sign up for NBC Philadelphia's News Headlines newsletter.\n\nThe NHTSA job cuts, enacted by Musk's advisory group on shrinking the federal government, was earlier reported by The Washington Post.\n\nIn addition to investigations into Tesla’s partially automated vehicles, NHTSA has mandated that Tesla and other automakers using self-driving technology report crash data on vehicles, a requirement that Tesla has criticized and that watchdogs fear could be eliminated.\n\nThe staff reductions have come through a combination of firings, buyouts and layoffs. The agency noted in its statement that the Biden administration had expanded its payroll, suggesting the smaller staff was sufficient to carry out its mission.\n\n“Even with these modest efficiencies, NHTSA is still considerably larger today than it was four years ago,” the statement said. “We have retained positions critical to the mission of saving lives, preventing injuries, and reducing economic costs due to road traffic crashes.”",

        "source": "https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/",
        "content": "Attorneys for federal workers said Monday in a lawsuit that billionaire Trump adviser Elon Musk had violated the law with his weekend demand that employees explain their accomplishments or risk being fired.\n\nThe updated lawsuit, which was filed in federal court in California and was provided to The Associated Press, is trying to block mass layoffs pursued by Musk and President Donald Trump, including any connected to the email distributed by the Office of Personnel Management on Saturday. The office, which functions as a human resources agency for the federal government, said employees needed to detail five things that they did last week by end of day on Monday.\n\n“No OPM rule, regulation, policy, or program has ever, in United States history, purported to require all federal workers to submit reports to OPM,” said the amended complaint, which was filed on behalf of unions, businesses veterans, and conservation organizations represented by the group State Democracy Defenders Fund. It called the threat of mass firings “one of the most massive employment frauds in the history of this country.”\n\nMusk, who's leading the Republican president's efforts to overhaul and downsize the federal government, continued to threaten federal workers on Monday morning even as confusion spread through the administration and some top officials told employees not to comply.\n\nGet top local stories in Philly delivered to you every morning. Sign up for NBC Philadelphia's News Headlines newsletter.\n\n“Those who do not take this email seriously will soon be furthering their career elsewhere,” Musk posted on X, his social media platform.\n\nHe also escalated Trump's demand for employees to stop working remotely.\n\n“Starting this week, those who still fail to return to office will be placed on administrative leave,” Musk posted.\n\nThe latest round of turmoil began over the weekend, when Trump posted on Truth Social, his social media website, that “ELON IS DOING A GREAT JOB, BUT I WOULD LIKE TO SEE HIM GET MORE AGGRESSIVE.\"\n\nMusk followed up by saying “all federal employees will shortly receive an email requesting to understand what they got done last week.” He claimed that \"failure to respond will be taken as a resignation.” The directive echoed how the billionaire entrepreneur has managed his own companies.\n\nThe Office of Personnel Management sent out its own request afterwards.\n\n“Please reply to this email with approx. 5 bullets of what you accomplished last week and cc your manager,\" the message said. However, it said nothing about the potential for employees to get fired for noncompliance. The deadline was listed as 11:59 p.m. EST on Monday.\n\nThere was swift resistance from several key U.S. agencies led by the president’s loyalists — including the FBI, the State Department, Homeland Security and the Pentagon — which instructed their employees over the weekend not to respond. Lawmakers in both major political parties said Musk’s mandate may be illegal, while unions threatened to sue.\n\nOne message on Sunday morning from the Department of Health and Human Services, led by Robert F. Kennedy Jr., instructed its roughly 80,000 employees to comply. That was shortly after the acting general counsel, Sean Keveney, had instructed some not to. And by Sunday evening, agency leadership issued new instructions that employees should “pause activities” related to the request until noon on Monday.\n\n“I’ll be candid with you. Having put in over 70 hours of work last week advancing Administration’s priorities, I was personally insulted to receive the below email,” Keveney said in an email viewed by The Associated Press that acknowledged a broad sense of “uncertainty and stress” within the agency.\n\nKeveney laid out security concerns and pointed out some of the work done by the agency’s employees may be protected by attorney-client privilege: “I have received no assurances that there are appropriate protections in place to safeguard responses to this email.”\n\nDemocrats and even some Republicans, including Sen. John Curtis, R-Utah, were critical of Musk’s ultimatum.\n\n“If I could say one thing to Elon Musk, it’s like, please put a dose of compassion in this,” Curtis, whose state has 33,000 federal employees, said on CBS’ “Face the Nation.” “These are real people. These are real lives. These are mortgages. ... It’s a false narrative to say we have to cut and you have to be cruel to do it as well.”\n\nNewly confirmed FBI Director Kash Patel, an outspoken Trump ally, instructed employees to ignore Musk’s request, at least for now.\n\n“The FBI, through the Office of the Director, is in charge of all of our review processes, and will conduct reviews in accordance with FBI procedures,” Patel wrote in an email confirmed by the AP. “When and if further information is required, we will coordinate the responses. For now, please pause any responses.”\n\nEd Martin, interim U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia, sent his staff a message Sunday that may have caused more confusion.\n\n“Let me clarify: We will comply with this OPM request whether by replying or deciding not to reply,” Martin wrote in the email obtained by the AP, referring to the Office of Personnel Management.\n\n“Please make a good faith effort to reply and list your activities (or not, as you prefer), and I will, as I mentioned, have your back regarding any confusion,” Martin continued. “We can do this.”\n\nOfficials at the Departments of State, Defense and Homeland Security were more consistent.\n\nTibor Nagy, acting undersecretary of state for management, told employees in an email that department leadership would respond on behalf of workers. “No employee is obligated to report their activities outside of their Department chain of command,” Nagy wrote in an email.\n\nPentagon leadership instructed employees to “pause” any response to Musk’s team, according to an email from Jules Hurst, the deputy undersecretary of defense for personnel and readiness.\n\nThe Homeland Security Department, meanwhile, told employees that “no reporting action from you is needed at this time” and that agency managers would respond, according to an email from R.D. Alles, deputy undersecretary for management.\n\nThousands of government employees have already been forced out of the federal workforce — either by being fired or through a “deferred resignation″ offer — during the first month of Trump’s second term. There is no official figure available for the total firings or layoffs so far, but the AP has tallied hundreds of thousands of workers who are being affected. Many work outside of Washington.\n\nMusk on Sunday called his latest request “a very basic pulse check.”\n\n“The reason this matters is that a significant number of people who are supposed to be working for the government are doing so little work that they are not checking their email at all!” Musk wrote on X. “In some cases, we believe non-existent people or the identities of dead people are being used to collect paychecks. In other words, there is outright fraud.”\n\nHe has provided no evidence of such fraud. Separately, Musk and Trump have falsely claimed in recent days that tens of millions of dead people over 100 years old are receiving Social Security payments.\n\nMeanwhile, thousands of other employees are preparing to leave the federal workforce this coming week, including probationary civilian workers at the Pentagon and all but a fraction of U.S. Agency for International Development staffers through cuts or leave.\n\nPeoples reported from New York. Associated Press writers Byron Tau, Ellen Knickmeyer, Matthew Perrone and Tara Copp in Washington and Valerie Gonzalez in McAllen, Texas, contributed to this report.",

Alfred, her beloved pup, lends his name to Alfie's IPA, a flagship beer featuring cashmere, citrus, and galaxy hops. \"It's really one of my favorites on tap, but I am an IPA lover,\" she says.\n\nAnother house favorite is Fens Stout, named after her dog Fen. \"It pours tall, dark, and handsome just like him,\" Morrow jokes.\n\nAs a special tribute, every pet that inspires a beer gets their name and photo added to a dedicated wall in the brewery.\n\nWith great beer, a welcoming atmosphere, and plenty of four-legged friends, Snouts and Stouts Brewing is a must try.",

Three police officers were shot during the incident and one died.\n\nWest York Borough police officer Andrew Duarte was killed in the shooting, the borough confirmed. The other two officers were hospitalized in stable condition.\n\nLaw enforcement from multiple agencies, including West York Borough Police, Pennsylvania State Police, and the York County Quick Response Team, responded to the situation. Officers attempted to negotiate with Ortiz, but he emerged from the ICU holding a hospital staff member at gunpoint, her hands bound by zip ties.\n\n\"The officers were left with no recourse,\" Barker said. \"They opened fire, killing Ortiz and preventing further loss of life.\"\n\n\"After reviewing surveillance footage and witness statements, it is absolutely clear and beyond any doubt that the officers acted lawfully in using deadly force,\" he said. \"Quite frankly, they needed to-because by doing so, they potentially saved even more lives.\"\n\nUPMC said no patients have been injured.\n\nPolice say Ortiz may have been motivated by the care provided to a terminally ill relative.\n\nA senior law enforcement official tells ABC News that the gunman had trouble accepting that his family member was terminally ill, and was upset over a perceived lack of care.\n\nThat family member died within the last week.",

All have had cancer before age 50.\n\nWhile scientists work on finding out why cancer is hitting adults younger these days, these patients have unique needs to be met.\n\nLuckily, there is a new program in Philadelphia for that.\n\nIt's a sobering statistic - although colorectal cancers are down overall, they're hitting those 50 years of age and younger harder.\n\n\"Between 2011 and 2019, the rates have increased by almost 2% per year,\" says Dr. Christopher Cann, a Gastrointestinal Oncologist at Fox Chase Cancer Center.\n\nBecause of that, Dr. Cann says many young adults may have a different future than their parents.\n\n\"About a two times increased risk of colon cancer and a four times increased risk of rectal cancer,\" he notes.\n\nAnd Dr. Cann says the symptoms can be vague.\n\n\"Fatigue, abdominal pain, and then rectal bleeding,\" are the most common.\n\nThe bleeding is often assumed to be hemorrhoids, so patients are slow to see a doctor, according to one survey.\n\n\"41% of patients within that age group waited over six months before seeking medical attention, and two thirds of patients saw two or more physicians before they were even diagnosed,\" he says.\n\nSo the cancers are more often advanced, and harder to treat.\n\nWith 17 cancers in all rising among those under 50, Fox Chase has created Philadelphia's first Young Adults Cancer program, for 18 to 39-year-olds.\n\n\"They're beginning their careers. They're beginning a family. They're in the midst of education. They're often not financially stable,\" Dr. Cann says.\n\nIt goes beyond medical care, to include social work, psychiatry, psychology, financial guidance, child care guidance - and preserving their fertility.\n\n\"We've already seen a significant increase in referrals to onco-fertility. So I think it was a 450% increase,\" he says.\n\nIt's all designed to lessen the stress of daily life, so patients can focus on their cancer care.\n\nSimilar programs elsewhere have had good results.\n\n\"Depression rates are lower, anxiety rates are lower. People are following up more,\" he adds.\n\nDr. Cann says clinical trials specifically for young adults are also in the offing. The first three should open in about six months.",

        "source": "https://metrophiladelphia.com/",
        "content": "Sign up for our Gay City News email newsletter to get news, updates, and local insights delivered straight to your inbox!\n\nEric McGinty’s “Stockade,” made in 2023, has only screened at two film festivals prior to its arrival on VOD. Given the amount of gatekeeping that goes on behind the scenes, that’s not necessarily a sign of its lack of quality. In this case, it turns out to be one. “Stockade” displays technical incompetence in acting, writing, and editing, stretching out a story that might fill a 20-minute short to a painfully elongated 88 minutes. If it were a student film, that’d be one thing, but as a work sent out into the world by a director with another feature and two shorts under his belt, it’s an embarrassment.\n\nAhlam (out actor Sarah Bitar) is lying in bed when she receives a call from her mother in Lebanon. The artist is now trying to make a go of life in Brooklyn, but she has difficulty earning a living. She works as a babysitter to an Arab-American child, whose mother insists Ahlam speak to her in Arabic. Paul (cinematographer Guy de Lancey), who has been injured in a recent accident and now needs a cane, offers her a well-paying job. Since he can’t leave his apartment, he asks her to travel upstate to a house in Kingston with a package. For all the errand’s mystery, he assures her she’s not being used as a drug mule. When she arrives at the house, she opens the package and finds artwork from Iraq. Richard (McGinty) arrives to collect it, promising he’ll return the next day. He does not show up. Instead, a couple confront Ahlam. The man gives her a bottle of water laced with drugs, and once she passes out, the two kidnap her.\n\nMany of the basic elements of filmmaking grammar become far more visible in their absence. “Stockade” is not an experimental film. It would love to be a thriller, but its editing and writing generate no tension. In fact, its cuts are subtly jarring, making for a grating experience. Why does it take its eye away from two women’s conversation to insert a brief shot of a pool of carp? Why does a shot-reverse shot sequence going back and forth between people in the room look as though the lighting and cinematography are far different for each person? Why didn’t McGinty recognize that the color grading needed to be done carefully, so that these shots match each other? Full of unintended awkwardness, most dialogue scenes exist solely to drop a piece of information, supposedly pushing the narrative forward. The script may as well be the product of an AI who has never actually heard two people engaged in small talk.\n\nBitar’s performance leaves her character’s emotions barely visible. After being drugged, kidnapped, escaping and returning home to Brooklyn, Ahlam shows few signs of these events’ long-term impact. In real life, she would probably be more tense meeting a stranger alone in her studio afterwards. “Stockade” never establishes the time frame of these events. Do weeks or months go by between her escape and her return to a painter’s life back in Brooklyn?\n\nFor a film based around the struggle to stay our of poverty and retain a visa to stay in the US, it can’t create an aura of danger. (Mc Ginty describes it as an “immigrant film noir,” stating his desire to center “characters and situations that are under-represented in most mainstream films.”) Even the kidnappers are as polite and unthreatening as they could possibly be. While the precariousness of an immigrant’s life is part of the story, it never feels truly inhabited. Nor is there the slightest anger behind the references to America’s wars in the Middle East and the history of looting antiquities for Western museums. It’s all just a story, badly told.\n\n“Stockade” | Directed by Eric McGinty | In English and Arabic and French with English subtitles | Freestyle Digital Media | Available on VOD Feb. 25th",

Neighbors can call 1-800-RED-CROSS (1-800-733-2767) by Wednesday, Feb. 26 to open a case and see if you are eligible for financial assistance in addition to other services.\n\nSmall businesses can apply for up to $20,000 in grant support through The Merchants Fund Emergency Relief Grants – established in partnership with the Department of Commerce – to help ease the economic impact of the plane crash disaster.

        "content": "Sign up for our Daily Email newsletter to stay up-to-date on the latest local news throughout Philadelphia.\n\nTickets are now on sale for the new Edelman Fossil Park & Museum of Rowan University (EFM) in South Jersey—and it’s as big and prehistoric as it sounds.\n\nThe venue, which explores the world of dinosaurs, is set to open to the public on March 29, and with it comes 44,000 square feet across 123 acres overlooking a 4-acre fossil-rich quarry.\n\n“Our goal with the museum is to bring back that childlike sense of wonder and help people feel a deeper connection to the incredible history of our planet,” said Dr. Kenneth Lacovara, founding executive director of the Edelman in a statement.\n\n“Right here in South Jersey, we’ve preserved millions of years of history in stunning detail, with each fossil telling its own unique story. We want visitors to feel like they’re stepping into the world of dinosaurs and walk away feeling inspired, empowered, and ready to make a difference for the future.”\n\nAlongside its exhibits, the world-class institution will also include a unique fossil dig experience, a free-roam virtual reality adventure, personalized interactive encounters, and a dinosaur-themed playground. As a release notes, the goal is to offer a unique blend of scientific discovery and exploration for all ages.\n\nLocated 20 minutes from Philadelphia, highlights of the EFM include a Dinosaur Coast Gallery (an interactive environment depicting the lives of East Coast dinosaurs from 66 million years ago) and the Monstrous Seas Gallery (an immersive underwater journey through the primitive depths of the Cretaceous ocean, featuring a 55-foot mosasaur and other species found on the Fossil Park’s property.)\n\nVisitors can also find the Critter Cove and the Discovery Forest. The former allows families to meet the modern-day relatives of different and well-known Cretaceous creatures, while the latter boasts a nature-themed adventure that explores the Earth’s history and evolution. The Discovery Forest ultimately ends at the venue’s TED-Ed theater, where “animated films make science come alive.”\n\nThe new Edelman Fossil Park & Museum also features the Hall of Extinction & Hope. As a release describes, this “inspiring” exhibit explores the Fifth Extinction, the catastrophic moment when an asteroid impact ended the reign of the dinosaurs, and different action steps to save our planet for future generations.\n\nUpon opening, there’s also the Virtual Reality portion (which is classified as a Premium Experience.) This free-roam VR journey follows an Expedition Voyager mission to collect scientific samples and come face-to-face with dinosaurs and Cretaceous creatures. Other amenities at Edelman span the Quarry Grounds Cafe, Darwin & Co. Retail Store, Outdoor Nature Trails, Cretaceous Gardens, outdoor family activities and plenty more.\n\nAdditionally, EFM’s Quarry Dig Experience (another premium add-on), happens to be the mega-popular attraction that inspired the creation of the museum in the first place.\n\nWith the dig, visitors can experience paleontology by digging for real fossils and explore the ongoing scientific work being conducted by Rowan scientists and students. Learning guides throughout the site will be there to provide context, and this 90-minute experience includes an orientation, the dig itself, and fossil identification with the venue’s Fossil Guides.\n\nThis particular portion of the museum will be open seasonally from May to October, and digs will officially begin on Thursday, May 1. It’s recommended to book your spot well in advance as well.\n\nGeneral admission tickets ($24-$29) to the Edelman Fossil Park & Museum give you all-day access to the museum’s galleries including full-scale dinosaurs, an interactive fossil scavenger hunt, and all of the exhibits mentioned before. With the free-roaming Expedition Voyager virtual reality or the Quarry Dig Fossil Experience (prices vary), guests may make a reservation by selecting a visit date and entry time during purchase. Premium add-on availability is based on your entry time.\n\nTo find out more information on Edelman (66 Million Mosasaur Way, Sewell, New Jersey) visit efm.org",

        "source": "https://metrophiladelphia.com/",
        "content": "Sign up for our email newsletter to stay up-to-date on the latest local sports news throughout Philadelphia.\n\nPro Football Focus listed a collection of Super Bowl Champion Philadelphia Eagles among the top 101 performances from the 2024-25 NFL season. Eleven Birds were selected, with the six offensive stars barely outpacing the five defenders. Offensive Lineman Jordan Mialata led the way, as he did for Saquon Barkley this season, landing as the third-best player in the NFL according to that publication. If you squint really hard, you can find Super Bowl LIX MVP Jalen Hurts near the end of the text….as the eighth-best NFL QB from the NFL this season.\n\nTwo Top 10 Players in Philadelphia\n\nEven with missing some time due to injury, Mialata still placed in the “bronze medal” position. The massive 6-foot-8 lineman allowed only two sacks this year while having one of the most dominant seasons a lineman has seen since 2006. He was equally effective in pass-blocking and run-blocking, allowing the Australian to earn such high praise from PFF.\n\nDespite being the only 2,500-yard rusher the NFL has ever seen, Saquon Barkley had the tenth-best performance of the season and second-best running back campaign behind Baltimore’s Derrick Henry. His 2,504 total yards smashed Terrell Davis’ combined regular season and postseason rushing mark. Barkley’s elusiveness was a significant factor in the ranking for the running back, described as “the Eagles closer” due to having the most touches, yards, and scores of all NFL running backs in the fourth quarter this season. Has anyone checked if Barkley can toss a baseball? Just checking for some friends in sunny South Florida.\n\nThree More Birds Inside Top 30 NFL Players\n\nFootball – NFL – Super Bowl LIX – Philadelphia Eagles v Kansas City Chiefs – Caesars Superdome, New Orleans, Louisiana, United States – February 9, 2025 Philadelphia Eagles’ Zack Baun celebrates with Josh Sweat after intercepting the ball REUTERS/Mike Segar TPX IMAGES OF THE DAY\n\nBehind Barkley is the publication’s 2024 Breakout Player of the Year, Zach Baun, at Number 11. The free agent signed with Philly on a 1-year “prove it” deal… and well, Baun did that and some, earning his first All-Pro selection with the NFL’s highest-rated linebacker play in 2024. Baun excelled in both facets of the run-and-pass game, leading to a Super Bowl Championship for Philadelphia. Baun’s bet on himself last season should pay out handsomely for the 28-year-old defender this summer.\n\nThe second Eagles lineman lands on the list at #18, thanks to Lane Johnson’s excellence at the tackle position. Johnson had one of the most productive seasons of his career en route to his second Lombardi trophy. Like Mialtata (and Baun), his all-around dominance in the pass-and-run scheme propelled the 34-year-old lineman to the best overall grade of his career. The five-time Pro Bowler allowed only one sack this season, which occurred during the final quarter of the Eagles’ victory over Kansas City in New Orleans.\n\nA.J. Brown marks the first appearance of an Eagles wide receiver in the Top 101. Philly’s pass catcher was the NFL’s best-ranked wideout in 1-0n-1 coverage this season – something that Jalen Hurts utilized brilliantly in the postseason on several occasions. Brown finished with over 1,000 receiving yards for the fifth time in his six-year NFL career. He is signed through 2029 in Philadelphia.\n\nRelated: Eagles WR A.J. Brown supports new OC Kevin Patullo, states changes will need to be made\n\nEagles Rookies Receive Recognition\n\nFootball – NFL – Super Bowl LIX – Philadelphia Eagles v Kansas City Chiefs – Caesars Superdome, New Orleans, Louisiana, United States – February 9, 2025 Philadelphia Eagles’ Cooper DeJean celebrates during the game REUTERS/Mike Segar\n\nCooper DeJean (#45) and Quinyon Mitchell (#78) surprised a bunch of NFL front offices with their seamless transition to the pro level. Everyone in Philadelphia can recall where they were when DeJean returned a Patrick Mahomes pass to the painted turf for a touchdown during Super Bowl LIX. However, Vic Fangio’s defense gained momentum once a healthy DeJean was added to the starting line-up in October. The Eagles lost only one game this season with the rookie in the cornerback slot as he locked down a position that Philadelphia ranked last in at the end of the 2023 season.\n\nSpeaking of locking things down, Eagles’ rookie Quinyon Mitchell (#78) placed sixth among qualifying players in coverage this season… and the second-best rookie behind the guy you just read about, DeJean. The first-round pick out of Toledo erased any doubts anyone had about his ability to perform at the NFL level coming out of a smaller college with a stellar freshman season for Philly. Mitchell was sixth among qualified cornerbacks in coverage this season.\n\nHurts Barely Lands on List at 91\n\nFeb 9, 2025; New Orleans, LA, USA; Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Jalen Hurts (1) warms up before the second half of Super Bowl LIX at Caesars Superdome. Mandatory Credit: Geoff Burke-Imagn Images\n\nThe remaining four Eagles include a QB-protector, a duo of threats to the opposing quarterback, and the Super Bowl MVP-QB himself. Landon Dickerson (#64), Jalen Carter (#77), Milton Williams (#90), and Jalen Hurts (#91) round out the impressive total of Philadelphia football players inside the Top 101.\n\nOn the defensive side of the ball, there was no sophomore slump for Carter as he continued to reward the Eagles selection. The interior defender was rated as the fourth-best pass rusher in their metrics, with a 13% win rate when attacking the opposing QB during the 2024 season. Teammate Milton Williams cranked it up in the postseason as PFF’s best-graded pass rusher en route to becoming a household name with a strip sack of Mahomes in the fourth quarter of the Super Bowl win.\n\nHurts might not have been on the list without a strong offseason performance. The publication claimed the late entry for Hurts (and Milton Williams) was “due to exceptional performances in the postseason.” Three turnovers in three months since the Eagles’ October bye week only go so far in this economy, folks. No matter, as Nike said, “Love Hurts,” and Philly’s star QB will continue to try to prove the doubters wrong.\n\nMandatory Credit: Bill Streicher-Imagn Images",

After years of detailed plans and delays, the long-decaying ship, SS United States, has finally left Pier 82 on the Delaware River. Now, after three decades, it’s on its way to becoming an artificial reef off the coast of Florida.\n\nIn 2024 — the SS United States which is docked on the Delaware River — was vandalized. The suspects have been identified on camera breaking into the old ship, but have not been apprehended. The retired ocean liner — docked at Pier 82 in Philadelphia since 1996 — was the only one of its kind to be completely manufactured in the United States with the potential to carry troops in wartime. Since her maiden voyage in 1952 — it still holds the record for the fastest liner to make the trip across the Atlantic in either direction.\n\nLast month — also on the Delaware River — we saw those images of the USS John F. Kennedy being towed down the Delaware River. For those of us who are old enough to remember when the USS John F. Kennedy was christened by Jackie Kennedy and a then 9-year old Caroline in 1967 — only days away from what would have been JFK’s 50th birthday.\n\nOriginally supposed to be classed in the Kitty-Hawk of Aircraft Carriers — the USS John F. Kennedy actually was modified to such an extent during construction — that the ship formed its own class. After 40 years of service including in the Yom Kippur War of 1973 and Operation Desert Storm in 1991 — she would arrive at Pier 4 at the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard in March 2008 — where it had been docked for upgrades some 20 years before.\n\nPhiladelphia’s Maritime history harkens back to the very inception of our European settlements. The Port of Philadelphia came to life as part of William Penn’s famous Charter of 1701 — and prior to being surpassed by the Port of New York — was our busiest during the formative years of our nation.\n\nOur city’s nautical history originates nearly from the moment that William Penn decided on a site for Philadelphia — the perfect place for a metropolis at the conjoining of two rivers. It’s been a rich history for nearly 343 years.\n\nMichael Thomas Leibrandt is member of the York Road Historical Society and lives and works in Abington Township.",

Nola has been a longtime partner with Team Red, White, & Blue, a nonprofit organization that aims to support former troops who have returned home from service.\n\nThe charity and efforts are near and dear to Aaron’s heart. “Team Red, White & Blue is a remarkable organization, and I’m thrilled to announce this new charity poker tournament to benefit our veteran community,” said Nola. “It is our hope to raise more than $250,000 for this important cause, and I look forward to joining my teammates, partners and fans for a fun evening at the ballpark on May 15.”\n\nAaron Nola and Kyle Schwarber.

Mandatory Credit: Mike Watters-Imagn Images\n\nSign up for our email newsletter to stay up-to-date on the latest local sports news throughout Philadelphia.\n\nSpring Training Baseball is upon us as the Philadelphia Phillies have completed the first two games of their 2025 Spring Training slate. The Phillies dropped both contests to the Detroit Tigers and the Baltimore Orioles by respective scores of 7-6 and 6-1.\n\nFour Phillies slugged home runs over the first two games while several big leaguers began to get their reps in as well.\n\nHow the Games Progressed\n\nThe first bit of Spring Training action came a short drive away in Lakeland, Fla., against the Tigers. After a scoreless first two frames, Cal Stevenson notched the first base hit of the Spring for the Phillies, a double into left field. The first baserunner then became the first run scored as Johan Rojas fought off a slider inside to bring in Stevenson. Following a walk from Bryson Stott and an Alec Bohm single, Max Kepler batted in two of his new teammates on a single of his own to give the Phillies a 3-0 lead.\n\nKepler worked a walk in his next plate appearance, putting a runner on base for Buddy Kennedy as he slugged the Phillies’ first home run of the spring. Weston Wilson had earned the honor both of the previous two springs but was recently shut down for six weeks due to a strained oblique.\n\nThe Phillies notched one more run on the day, a solo home run from Josh Breaux, a catcher who the Phillies picked up last year after he was released by the New York Yankees.\n\nThe Phillies did drop the game 7-6, but none of the pitchers who appeared in the contest project to make the Phillies’ Opening Day roster.\n\nFeb 22, 2025; Lakeland, Florida, USA; Philadelphia Phillies catcher Rafael Marchn (13) bats during the second inning against the Detroit Tigers at Publix Field at Joker Marchant Stadium. Mandatory Credit: Mike Watters-Imagn Images\n\nIn Sunday’s home opener against the Orioles, the Phillies found themselves down quickly. Tyler Phillips, who recorded seven starts with the Phillies in 2024, allowed three runs over two innings against the Orioles.\n\nThe Orioles picked up four additional runs over the course of the fourth, fifth, seventh, and ninth innings against pitchers Kyle Tyler, John McMillon, Tristan Barnett, and Cody Stashak.\n\nIn proper Philadelphia style, the long ball was the source of much of the Phillies’ offense. Christian Arroyo slugged a solo shot onto the left field concourse in the bottom of the third.\n\nA few innings later, in the bottom of the seventh, prospect Justin Crawford slipped a single through a defensive shift before Gabriel Rincones Jr. hit a two-run shot over the berm in right center field.\n\nOverall, the Phillies dropped the contest 7-3.\n\nTakeaways from Phillies Early Start\n\nEvery player that steps onto the diamond wants to win on any given day, but Spring Training has no weight to wins and losses whatsoever. The important thing is allowing players to get work in, figure out position battles, and stay healthy throughout the process.\n\nThe most interesting players to follow after the first two games are Buddy Kennedy and Cal Stevenson. Both will battle for what is likely the final roster spot, a backup outfield/utility position. Both players are 1-for-4 thus far with an extra base hit, a run scored, and a walk. Kennedy’s hit went a lot further, but Stevenson has plenty of time to make his case. Following Wilson’s injury, the battle will likely come down to Kennedy, Stevenson, and Kody Clemens, all of whom saw time in the big leagues in 2024. Clemens is 1-for-2 thus far.\n\nAlec Bohm, Johan Rojas, Nick Castellanos, Brandon Marsh, Kyle Schwarber, Bryson Stott, and Edmundo Sosa have all seen action thus far for the Phillies. Phillips is the only familiar face to pitch for the Phillies in the first two contests.\n\nTop prospects Aidan Miller and Justin Crawford made appearances in both games over the weekend. The pair are likely to not make an impact at the Major League level this season, but they have the potential to be cornerstone pieces of the Phillies’ lineup for years to come.\n\nFeb 22, 2025; Lakeland, Florida, USA; Philadelphia Phillies outfielder Cal Stevenson (47) catches a fly ball during the first inning against the Detroit Tigers at Publix Field at Joker Marchant Stadium.

The contest will start at 1:05 P.M. and will be broadcast on NBC Sports Philadelphia+.\n\nCristopher Sanchez is scheduled to start on Monday with Joe Ross slated for the start on Tuesday at the Tampa Bay Rays. Zack Wheeler and Jesus Luzardo are also slated to make their Spring Training debuts later this week for the Phillies.",

Mandatory Credit: Kyle Ross-Imagn Images\n\nIt’s been a running thought by fans and even national media members that Embiid should simply have the surgery and prepare for next season ever since first mentioned the idea. The only problem is that this supposed surgery may not even exist.\n\nThere are many types of knee injuries, multiple that involve the meniscus as well. Simply put, it all depends on what is actually wrong with his knee. Is it a matter of debris or another tear? Neither of those possibilities has been reported or even hinted at. Is it a matter of Embiid having virtually or literally no more cartilage in his knee? Considering his injury history, this seems far more likely. However, there is no clear surgical option in this case.\n\nNov 20, 2024; Memphis, Tennessee, USA; Philadelphia 76ers center Joel Embiid (21) limps to the bench during a time out during the second half against the Memphis Grizzlies at FedExForum. Mandatory Credit: Petre Thomas-Imagn Images\n\nMicrofracture surgery has proven time and time again to hurt more than it’s helped for NBA players. Without a tear, there is no ability to perform a meniscus repair surgery, nor is there a point to another meniscectomy in that case.\n\nOne frequently suggested surgery is known by some as the Lonzo Ball surgery; to many more, it’s known as a meniscal allograft transplantation or meniscus transplant. While the early results are somewhat positive for Ball, the difference between Ball and Embiin in both age and body size provides significantly different — less positive — optics for recovery.\n\nWhatever the Sixers and Embiid jointly decide, they will need to put a lot of man-hours into their research. With 26 games left this season and the Sixers currently being 16 games below .500, this is as clear a sign as any to waive the white flag on Joel Embiid’s season, barring some miracle cure.\n\nFor the latest breaking news on your Philadelphia 76ers and other Philly sports, follow Zach Ciavolella on X — @CiavoNBA and Bluesky — @ciavo.bsky.social",

Animal welfare groups rescued a dozen horses from the property – several of which were injured – along with a pig and a goat.\n\nSurveillance video distributed by the PPD on Monday shows a man walking in the area moments before flames emerged from the pop-up stable.\n\nPolice described the suspect as a white man with a thin build who was wearing dark-colored pants, a gray long sleeve shirt and a black hat. Anyone with information is asked to contact the City Wide Arson Task Force at 215-783-1092 or call or text the police tip line, 215-686-TIPS (8477).\n\nThe Pennsylvania SPCA is caring for the horses that survived the fire, while ACCT Philly took custody of the goat and pig.\n\nACCT Philly, the city’s animal care and control provider, said in a Facebook post last week that it “appears the stable was operating as a business and people were boarding their horses at the property.”\n\nThe organization said citations were issued Feb. 16 following a visit to the site, and that ACCT Philly was working with the city to address the situation. Philadelphia residents are permitted to own horses but are supposed to go through a licensing process.",

        "content": "Sign up for our email newsletter to stay up-to-date on the latest local sports news throughout Philadelphia.\n\nPhiladelphia Flyers head coach John Tortorella and his wife, Christine Tortorella are incredibly passionate about rescues and animal welfare. The Tortorella’s have “The John and Christine Tortorella Family Foundation,” which features “Bear’s Angels,” is a program that partners with rescues and shelters that help homeless and abused animals. “Enlighten Your World… READ!” also helps with reading and writing skills.\n\nThe Tortorella’s are also passionate about “Hockey & Hounds.” The pair works locally with the Pennsylvania SPCA (PSPCA) and Philadelphia Animal Welfare Society (PAWS) through the Hockey & Hounds program. Each week, Hockey & Hounds features a rescue dog of the week. This week, the pup is an 11-month-old named King! During the Flyers Charities Carnival, the head coach spoke candidly about his love for animals and what inspired him to impact the community.\n\nQ: What got you involved with “Hockey & Hounds?”\n\nJT: “It orginated out in Columbus. Anthony Rothman, who does a radio show out there, we became friends. He does the real stuff, watching out for these dogs. So, as big sports guys, we connected and talked about hockey as long as we talked about animals. That’s the deal we made. Hundreds of dogs were adopted in Columbus in my six years there. Philadelphia is probably the best organization my wife and I have been involved with that understands how badly the causes are needed here to bring awareness.”\n\nQ: For people who can’t adopt (dogs/cats), how else can they get involved in helping the rescues?\n\nJT: “Just to go to the place, to the shelter near you, just to walk a dog. My wife was really into dogs before I met her. She brought to my attention the need. We were in a lockout or strike, so we went to our local shelter and walked dogs all day. There are so many different avenues that people can help with. You don’t want to force people to adopt a dog because it usually returns. If someone honestly doesn’t want a dog or cat, it usually comes back to the shelter.\n\nFlyers head coach John Tortarella meets with the media.\n\nYou can make donations for food. The neatest one is to carve out an hour in a day of your busy week or maybe a few days a week just to let these dogs out to get them out of their cages and let them be dogs. Fostering is a huge part of helping these animals. It allows them to see what home life is and lets them have the personality they have instead of being cooped up in the kennel. It’s not always money. They’re all (rescues) looking for money but just caring. If you care, you’ll find ways to help.”\n\nQ: How many pets do you have?\n\nJT: “We have five rescue dogs and three rescue horses.”\n\nQ: Horses? How did that come about?\n\nJT: “We started in Columbus about nine years ago. We didn’t have a clue what we were doing. With our foundation, we’re all through the country and have different shelters. We ran across this shelter to the south of us from where we lived and became friends with the family. There were a couple of horses that were left for dead in the field. They were starved to death. We had a five-acre farm. They nursed the horses back to where they could stand; they couldn’t even stand. They asked if we could bring them over and let them graze on your grass.”\n\nQ: Were the horses first or the dogs?\n\nJT: “The dogs came first. My wife is passionate about it. It’s her life. She didn’t know what she was getting into. She follows me around with all the jobs I’ve had in hockey, and if it isn’t hockey, it’s rescuing animals. It’s a huge part of our life right now. We loved doing it and met so many great people doing it. It’s so needed. It’s such an emotional rollercoaster when you try to help these animals. You can bring awareness to my platform. The greatest thing about my job is that it’s a platform. It’s not me. It’s just my platform to talk about this. We need help. These animals need help. We’re in all the way and want to help in any way possible.”\n\nAs you can see, John Tortorella is passionate about protecting animals.

They show the league the type of players they look for every year and have been consistent over the last four drafts in staying true to their board and style.\n\nThis is my first all-Eagles, no trades, 2025 NFL mock draft for Philly Sports Network of the draft SzN.\n\nEagles Mock Draft 1.0\n\nRound One Pick 32- T.J. Sanders, Defensive Tackle, South Carolina\n\nSanders has elite length and eliminates passing lanes with his height and reach. He utilizes a quick burst off the line and is disruptive, causing havoc in the backfield. T.J. provides an interior pass rush (8.5 sacks last 2 seasons), sheds blocks well, is a solid tackler, has gaudy TFL totals (17 in 23/24), and is a toolsy player with high upside. He had a 21.2% pass-rush win rate and an 11.3% run-stop rate in college and is a versatile piece that could be truly explosive in this defensive front.\n\nWhen looking for a true 3-down DT, TJ Sanders checks all the boxes pic.twitter.com/TkfG7pKJvS — Brad (@Graham_SFN) February 11, 2025\n\nRound Two Pick 64- Josaiah Stewart, Edge Rusher, Michigan\n\nStewart has excellent speed, agility, an elite first step, and a plethora of pass-rush moves; swim, chop, etc. He has shown adequate bend getting around the edge, has a high motor to keep pressure on opposing quarterbacks, and has active, violent hands to thwart offensive linemen in his way. He processes offenses quickly. Josaiah can win with outside or inside pass rush moves and has a 16% pressure rate and a 17% run-stop rate tied for best-in-class. The Eagles prefer athletic edge rushers, and while some may think he is small for the position, he could be a perfect fit in Philadelphia.\n\nSep 16, 2024; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA; Philadelphia Eagles defensive end Bryce Huff (0) tackles Atlanta Falcons running back Bijan Robinson (7) after a catch during the second quarter at Lincoln Financial Field.

He exudes body control, is an above-average route runner, creates YAC, breaks tackles, and loves learning. Helm has some of the best hands in class and rarely drops a pass. He is also a film rat who desires to continually improve. He can thrive in the 12 P scheme and always finds a soft spot in coverage. Gunnar uses his body well to shield defenders and excels in space. He is the best run blocker in class!\n\nRound Four Pick 128 Jeffrey Bassa, Linebacker, Oregon\n\nJeffrey was the QB of the defense for Oregon, calling plays for three years. He is an above-average cover LB, using his former skills from being a saftey. Bassa has elite instincts, reads routes with speed, is twitchy, can blitz, and has elite closing speed and footwork. Jeffrey has also been a Gunner on special teams. This year, he was a Senior Bowl show-off! I love fit with the Eagles.\n\nRound Five Pick 162 Hollin Pierce, Offensive Tackle, Rutgers\n\nPierce has the size, height, anchor, and hands the Eagles love to develop. At 6’8 340, he is a roadblock, a mauler, and a vicious finisher. Hollin keeps pockets clean and blows up double teams. He measured the 3rd longest arms and 4th widest wingspan. Pierce is a tough, hard worker and a riser in this draft class at the position! Jeff Stoutland could take Hollin from a relative unknown to All-Pro by the time Lane is ready to hang the cleats up.\n\nFeb 9, 2025; New Orleans, LA, USA; Philadelphia Eagles offensive tackle Jordan Mailata (68) celebrates with Philadelphia Eagles offensive tackle Mekhi Becton (77) after winning Super Bowl LIX at Caesars Superdome.

Williams has shown his elite ball skills with seven interceptions this season at Cal. He is fluid and quick, recognizes routes with ease, and reacts instantly. Nohl also defends the run and tackles well. He is a physical corner too. Williams goes after the ball as if it was thrown to him when it is in the air. He should have a great showing at the combine in Indianapolis and has a chance to improve his stock. He has the talent to be a top-100 player. Adding another ball-hawking, aggressive, athletic, cost-effective corner to coach is desirable with the uncertainty of Slay and others possibly leaving Philly.\n\nRound Five Pick 169- Jalen McLeod, Edge OLB, Auburn\n\nMcLeod has a high motor and a knack for getting to the ball. He frustrates opposing defenses with physicality, think Chauncey Gardner-Johnson. He is versatile and play OLB or put his hand in the dirt as an Edge. Jalen is a menace on the field utilizing his speed, leverage, and eye awareness. He chases down ball carriers as if they stole from him, Playmaker! And why wouldn’t the Eagles want another Jalen on the squad? It has worked out well so far.\n\nBeen a fan of Auburn EDGE/LB Jalen McLeod since his App State days and he's got a great motor and cross chop to win against tackles. Played the \"Buck\" role as a hybrid outside linebacker who drop into coverage.\n\n\n\nAt his best rushing the passer. Had 2 FFs against Alabama. https://t.co/8NYk9rqq6Z pic.twitter.com/h6oCdGBgMt — Devin Jackson (@RealD_Jackson) January 24, 2025\n\nAs always, thank you for reading!\n\nFollow me on X @PHLEagleNews\n\nMandatory Credit: Stephen Lew-Imagn Images",

From Artistic Director John Jarboe and co-writer MK Tuomanen, Beards on Ice tackles the difficult tasks of solving the climate crisis and teaching drag queens how to ice skate.\n\nThe hour-long spectacle will come in two exciting varieties: A family-friendly afternoon romp for kids and kids-at-heart titled Family Meltdown, and Beards on Ice: Still Edging, a PG-13, late-night cabaret that’s appropriately titled as it has a bit more edge. The shows will take place between two locations, Tarken Ice Rink (6250 Frontenac St.) on March 15-16 and Laura Sims Skate House (210 Cobbs Creek Pkwy) on March 22-23. Each night, the family-friendly performance will be held at 4:30 p.m., and the PG-13 performance will be held at 8 p.m.\n\n“It feels so good to have some joy and absurdity brought into the climate change conversation, while speaking to the seriousness of the issue,” Jarboe said. “At the end of the performance, we want people to be more involved in the day-to-day climate justice work that’s happening in Philadelphia. It can be hard in a city landscape where everyone is dealing with a lot — how do you help people get rid of the armor they build throughout the day and listen? You show them a beautiful costume, you sing them an amazing song, you make them laugh while acknowledging the radical crisis that we’re in and the great opportunity we have as a species to come together.”\n\nAdvance tickets by donation ($0-$40) can be purchased online and there will also be suggested donation tickets available at the door of both show locations. Those in attendance, whether at Tarken Ice Rink or Laura Sims Skate House, will also enjoy a free skate rental and an hour-long skating session after the performance, hot chocolate, and resources from Philly’s climate justice organizations, including Physicians for Social Responsibility PA.\n\nFor more information on Beards on Ice or on The Bearded Ladies Cabaret themselves, visit beardedladiescabaret.com",

The gang’s motto: “If you want to join the Senders, get a body, then you gang with us,” according to Assistant DA Adam Faraye. ‘Getting a body’ refers to the act of killing someone.\n\n“The Senders are not quite gone, but they’re close,” DA Larry Krasner said at Friday’s news conference. “They’re very close.”\n\nMost of the violence occurred between 5th and 9th streets from Snyder to Oregon avenues; however, incidents connected to the Senders, and their feuds with other groups, were reported as far away as Lawncrest and Germantown.\n\nTaahir Rowe, 20, is facing murder charges for the January 2022 ambush shooting of 16-year-old Mehki Ingram on the 800 block of June Street in West Philadelphia’s Mill Creek neighborhood. Ingram died after several days in the hospital.\n\nOne of the other suspects, 19-year-old Eli Simmons, is being accused of participating in 10 shootings that left 16 people injured over the span of about 16 months in 2022 and 2023. Faraye said Simmons was being detained on $12.5 million bail.\n\nProsecutors said that, as part of the gang feud, three gunmen opened fire in February 2023 on a group of teenagers gathered on the 3100 block of Norris Street in Strawberry Mansion. The gunfire struck a mother and her 2-year-old daughter as they crossed the street, and five teens were injured.\n\nOther outbursts involving the Senders included three separate South Philadelphia triple shootings in January 2022 on the 700 block of Ritner Street; in April 2023 at 22nd and Wolf streets; and in May 2023 on the 600 block of Oregon Avenue, authorities said.\n\nElante Outerbridge, 17, is charged with nine counts of attempted murder in relation to the seven-victim incident and a shooting several months earlier in Southwest Philadelphia, according to the DA’s Office.\n\nHe is among the youngest defendants included in the bust, having been just 15 years old at the time of the two shootings. Most of the suspects were under 18 at the height of the gang warfare.\n\n“A lot of these young kids think it’s a game,” said PPD Detective Kelley Gallagher, who worked on the case. “On social media, they compare it to a basketball game. And how that works is, for every shooting victim, they say they have a point.”",

Mandatory Credit: Nathan Ray Seebeck-Imagn Images\n\nSign up for our email newsletter to stay up-to-date on the latest local sports news throughout Philadelphia.\n\nSpring Training is upon us, and the Philadelphia Phillies have returned to action.\n\nThe players are in Clearwater, Florida, preparing to defend their first National League East title since 2011. After an early exit against their rivals, the New York Mets, fans have begun to question the current status of the Phillies roster. From the bullpen to the lineup, the Phillies fanbase has let their voices be heard.\n\nRegarding the infield, each starter finds themselves associated with a growing opinion. As question marks bubble, I break down the biggest question for each member of the club’s starting infield.\n\nPhillies Infield\n\nCan JT Realmuto return to offensive excellence?\n\nCatcher J.T. Realmuto deserves all the credit in the world.\n\nSince joining the Phillies in 2019, Realmuto has caught more innings than any other catcher in the big leagues. This past season, J.T.’s stats were much better following the All-Star break (.272/.337/.451/.788 with 7 HR and 27 RBI) than prior to (.261/.309/.411/.720 with 7 HR and 20 RBI).\n\nDespite the production, his offensive numbers weren’t up to the standard that the Phillies needed. He finished 2024 with a .266/.322/.429/.751 line with 14 home runs and only 47 RBI. The only statistic that JT Realmuto was in the top 10 amongst catchers with as many or more at-bats is his batting average, where he ranked 8th.\n\nThe big question for Realmuto in 2024 is if he can get the bat going once again. He is an integral part of the Phillies’ roster, and they’re going to need him to get it going again on offense if they want to make noise this postseason.\n\nCan Bryce Harper stay on the field?\n\nBryce Harper is not a player you need to question in any aspect. He has earned the trust of everyone in the entire league; however, he has had to battle some injuries during his time with the Phillies.\n\nLast year he played in 145 of the 162 games, the second most since he joined the Phillies (excluding the 2020 year when he played 58 out of the 60 games). The Phillies need him to stay healthy to win it all, and with a full offseason without rehabbing a serious injury, I think fans can expect him to be there for at least 145 this season.\n\nIf Harper can maintain his health, he should return to MVP form in 2025.\n\nSep 25, 2024; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA; Philadelphia Phillies second baseman Bryson Stott (5) throws to first against the Chicago Cubs in the ninth inning at Citizens Bank Park. Mandatory Credit: Kyle Ross-Imagn Images\n\nBryson Stott—2023 or 2024?\n\nSecond baseman Bryson Stott started his sophomore season with a 17-game hit streak in 2023. He was one of the most consistent and clutch players on the Phillies that year. During his third season, Stott reportedly dealt with a lingering elbow issue that began in June. He would deal with the injury for the remainder of the season. His best month in 2024 was in July, where he hit .292/.340/.604/.944 with 10 HR and 23 RBI.\n\nThis season might be make or break for Bryson Stott. With the rise of top prospect Aidan Miller, Stott will need to shine once again in 2025. The question of his offensive ability will remain until Bryson is able to hit consistently. Will this season be a repeat of 2023 or 2024?\n\nWill Trea Turner find consistency?\n\nShortstop Trea Turner has had an up-and-down start to his Phillies tenure.\n\nThe standing ovation in 2023 has been well documented to this point. Turner’s struggles got him off on the wrong foot in his Phillies tenure, but he turned things around last season. His second year saw improvement, but he struggled in September and October.\n\nNot only has Trea been a roller coaster offensively, but defensively as well. His first two seasons with Philadelphia were the most error-filled seasons of his career, committing 23 and 17 errors, respectively. Turner is one of the many big names on the roster that the Phillies are relying on to get them over the hump, and the consistency needs to be there for them to accomplish their goal.\n\nCan Trea Turner be consistent on both sides of the ball? 2025 might unlock the answer to this question.\n\nFeb 19, 2025; Clearwater, FL, USA; Philadelphia Phillies shortstop Trea Turner (7) signs autographs for fans during spring training workouts at BayCare Ballpark. Mandatory Credit: Nathan Ray Seebeck-Imagn Images\n\nCan Alec Bohm dial in?\n\nThird baseman Alec Bohm had the best first half of his career in 2024.\n\nBohm parlayed that hitting dominance by earning his first All-Star nod. Following the All-Star break, he suffered a hand injury and could not regain the same hitting prowess that he showcased in the first half of the year.\n\nAt the break, Bohm was hitting .295/.348/.482/.830 with 11 HR and 70 RBI. It felt like he was guaranteed to get a hit with a runner on base. After the break, he hit .251/.299/.382/.681 with four HR and 27 RBI. He struggled mightily and could not find ways to get on base.\n\nBohm dominated the Phillies talk this offseason. He was included in several trade rumors this offseason, despite assurances by Rob Thomson and Dave Dombrowski that the club had no interest in moving him.\n\nAlec is a mentally driven player. What I mean by that is if everything is good, he is capable of ripping doubles into the left field gap every single night. On the flip side, if something isn’t going right, he starts to struggle.\n\nThe question will be if Alec Bohm can figure out how to control the emotional side of baseball. If Alec can dial in this season, 2024 might just be the stepping stone to greatness that the Phillies were hoping for.\n\nMandatory Credit: Nathan Ray Seebeck-Imagn Images",

        "content": "Sign up for our email newsletter to stay up-to-date on the latest local sports news throughout Philadelphia.\n\nA new era of Philadelphia Union soccer is here, and life under Bradley Carnell is off to a positive start. Despite conceding an early goal on the road, a big second-half performance pushes Union to a 4-2 win and 3 points on the opening weekend of the 2025 MLS season.\n\nImage Credit: Philadelphia Union\n\nStarting XI\n\nCarnell’s first starting lineup as the Head Coach of the Philadelphia Union had a few wrinkles, other than moving from the 4-4-2 Diamond that was favored under Jim Curtin to a 4-2-2-2.\n\nAndre Blake was back between the posts for his 300th career appearance for the Philadelphia Union on Saturday night after missing much of the 2024 season. In front of him, a makeshift backline made up of 2 first-team debutants, Frankie Westfield and Olwethu Makhanya, partnered by two veterans in Jakob Glesnes and Kai Wagner.\n\nJovan Lukić, another debutant who made some positive first impressions after a rocky start, took a spot in the double pivot next to Danley Jean-Jacques, who kicks off his first full season with the Union in 2025. Much more familiar to the fans of the Blue and Gold, Daniel Gazdag and Quinn Sullivan took position as the two attacking midfielders, with Tai Baribo and Mikael Uhre putting the pressure up top.\n\n“I’m not sure too many teams come to Orlando and feel comfortable and confident, especially with a new group, a new coach coming into town…and then you have some new guys on the field. We have [Danley] Jean-Jacques, we have [Jovan] Lukić – who did a great job, the double 6’s there, they did a really great job – and then you have Frankie, Olwethu, so I mean yeah, to come to this place and respond against a bit of adversity, to show the courage and the character and resilience that we’ve been building up over 5 weeks now, I’m really proud of the boys” – Philadelphia Union Head Coach, Bradley Carnell\n\nImage Credit: Philadelphia Union\n\nAn Early Orlando Lead\n\nJust 8 minutes in and on his league debut, Marco Pašalić opened his MLS account after Orlando City seamlessly connected a number of passes around Union debutants Jovan Lukić and Olwethu Makhanya and moseyed their way into the penalty area, kicking off the Bradley Carnell era on a bad foot.\n\nImage Credit: Philadelphia Union\n\nBaribo Brings Union Level\n\nAfter pressure from Quinn Sullivan forced Orlando into a turnover inside their own half in the 23rd minute, Union worked their way into the final 3rd and created some chaos around the penalty area. A mis-hit by Quinn Sullivan sent the ball out to Pedro Gallese’s right and into the path of Kai Wagner, who sent a low, fizzing cross through the 6-yard box where Tai Baribo was waiting to tap the ball in and level the game at 1.\n\nThe first goal of the Bradley Carnell era came from the exact type of soccer we’ve been told we’re going to see this season. High, relentless pressure when the other team is in possession, and then quick and direct passes that lead to goals in transition once turning the other team over. Despite going down early, Carnell stuck to his game plan, and the team was rewarded once they found their footing.\n\nImage Credit: Philadelphia Union\n\nGazdag Gives Union the Lead\n\nNow on level terms and with a pep-talk from the new manager at the break, Union came out of the second half absolutely flying. In the 48th minute, with the ball along the left sideline, Quinn Sullivan lofted a picturesque pass that curled to the far post and fell perfectly into the path of an outstretched Daniel Gazdag’s right foot.\n\nGazdag, getting the perfect touch on the ball from Sullivan, neatly re-directed the ball passed Gallese’s near-post and into the back of the net, giving Union their first lead of the Bradley Carnell era. Quinn Sullivan, who played a big role in creating the first goal, gets credited with an assist on the goal by Gazdag. A great start to the 2025 season for Quinn.\n\nImage Credit: Philadelphia Union\n\nUhre Extends Union’s Lead\n\nWhen playing it out of the back goes wrong! Just 3 minutes after Gazdag’s goal, Orlando City’s Rodrigo Schlegel mishandled a back-pass that sat perfectly for a pressing Mikael Uhre.\n\nUhre stepped onto the ball and hit it with his first touch at the top of the penalty arch, beating Gallese and jumping Union out to a 3-1 lead early in the 2nd half.\n\nImage Credit: Philadelphia Union\n\nBaribo Brace Seals First Win of Bradley Carnell Era\n\nIn the 64th minute and with a 3-1 lead, 19-year-old Frankie Westfield received the ball along the right side of the pitch and darted forward with conviction. After collecting a failed first attempt at a cross into the box, Westfield, with his right foot, sent a second ball through the penalty area, which was put in the back of the net by the first-touch of Tai Baribo, his 2nd goal of the game, and his 18th goal in his previous 23 games across all competitions for Union.\n\nThe assist was the first of Westfield’s MLS career and comes as the “cherry on top” of his MLS debut. Still just 19 and able to play either outside back position, Frankie Westfield looks set to log some minutes behind Kai Wagner and Nate Harriel this season and should now bring some extra confidence to the pitch whenever he’s called upon next.\n\nImage Credit: Philadelphia Union\n\nPašalić Puts In Consolation Goal\n\nIn the 79th minute and down 4-1, Orlando City’s Marco Pašalić notched his 2nd goal of the night and his MLS career after a couple of shot attempts rang the post and Union failed to clear the area. The goal didn’t mean anything for the result at the end of the day, but veteran Keeper Andre Blake surely wasn’t happy with young defender Olwethu Makhanya’s positioning and spectatorship on the play and gave him a bit of an earful, which I’m sure is a bit easier for Makhanya to swallow after a 4-2 win.\n\nImage Credit: Philadelphia Union\n\nQuotes from Carnell\n\nAfter the opening goal from Orlando inside the first 10 minutes, a lot of Union fans were probably having that “here we go again” feeling. But Bradley Carnell’s team stuck to the game plan, got themselves level, made a few tweaks at half-time, and absolutely shell-shocked Orlando in the final 45 minutes of the game.\n\n“For them to come out and be challenged here in this game was kind of a microcosm of the whole pre-season. We go a goal down, and then we’re chasing a little bit, we lose our structure, and then coming out of the 2nd half after correcting one or two things and then all of a sudden you can change the picture in a million ways and we did do that in transition, we really did exactly what we wanted to do from the beginning of the game.” – Philadelphia Union Head Coach, Bradley Carnell\n\nLet’s be honest here. I’m not sure anyone, maybe even Bradley Carnell, could have predicted a 4-1 win on the road in the opening game of the season. It’s a great start to a new era of Union soccer, and while Carnell knows they need to continue growing and getting better, he’s seeing lots of things to like about his team, and he’s happy to see them rewarded on Saturday night.\n\n“We left that Montreal [pre-season] game last week feeling very confident and very happy the way the pre-season ended. So I’m excited they could put it on display tonight, but I’m more just happy for the group. I’ve asked a lot of them, they’ve committed to me, we’ve had some great energy, we’ve done a lot of things off the field and reestablished some foundational standings within our group now, and I think you could see that togetherness today.” – Bradley Carnell\n\nImage Credit: Philadelphia Union\n\nMatch Highlights\n\nBe sure to return to Philly Sports Network for more Philadelphia Union and other soccer content!\n\nFollow our Union team on Twitter:\n\nTim Lovenguth | Jimmy King | Paul Frenzel\n\nNate Tennesen | Eric Frysinger\n\nSteve Beavon | Liam Jenkins\n\nDoop on Union fans!\n\nFeatured Image Credit: Philadelphia Union",

        "source": "https://metrophiladelphia.com/",
        "content": "Sign up for our Daily Email newsletter to stay up-to-date on the latest local news throughout Philadelphia.\n\nEveryone has to retire at some point…even hit men. In ‘Old Guy‘, Christoph Waltz’s Danny Dolinski has to deal with the fact that he’s being pushed out of his longtime career, and at the same time, has to train his replacement (Cooper Hoffman.)\n\nThis action-comedy from director Simon West (‘Con Air’) explores Dolinski’s trouble relinquishing his position to a “Gen Z”, and along with West and Hoffman, Lucy Liu also joins the cast as Danny’s old friend turned confidant turned perhaps a little something more.\n\nTo chat more about this feature and what went into crafting it, both Simon West and Lucy Liu sat down to discuss ‘Old Guy.’\n\nWhy sign on with this project? What elements of it were you excited to tackle?\n\nWest: Well, you always want to get a script that you just can’t stop reading, and it’s a page-turner. A very good test is: Do you fall asleep when you’re reading it or do you want to turn the next page? And this luckily was one of those latter ones. You look for the highlights… where are the humor scenes, where are the dramatic scenes? And if there are enough of those highlights that keep you interested in the reading, then you get excited about shooting them. So I look forward to those key scenes that I read about a year before I actually shoot them, but it’s kind of nerve-wracking.\n\nWill I get them on film as good as they are in my head? And sometimes, hopefully, most of the time you get it right and you do get them as good as they are on the page or as good as you imagined. But at the end of the day, I’m in the hands of the actors, so they have to deliver and I can just encourage them and create a world that they can do their best work. And also casting the right people like Lucy, Christoph and Cooper… you have to cast the right people so that they’re capable of doing all that.\n\nLiu: I love that it reminded me of a movie that was before the internet, when it wasn’t complicated. It was just about their relationships, their connections, and less about special effects or aliens coming from another planet, which by the way, I do love. But it seems so compact and concise with where the directions of the characters were going emotionally. And I think it’s a very short movie. So the fact that it moves quickly and that it hits all the different levels in that very short period of time in a very authentic way was exciting to me.\n\nWith a film like this, where a lot of the plot comes from the characters and their relationships, thinking of you, Lucy, along with Chrisoph and Cooper—how do you make sure that chemistry is there?\n\nLiu: That’s just something that you have to figure out when you get there…that’s not something that’s natural. You hope that it is when you read the script and you have this idea of what you hope it will be. And it was more than that even so when I got on the set with Christoph, and Cooper is just a lovely human being and somebody who’s enthusiastic and willing to try anything.\n\nI mean, Christoph and I had to have that chemistry in order to really make it believable that she would transition from being rejected from this Prince Charming to then suddenly having some affection towards her old friend. And luckily, it was something that came about because of the chemistry that we had together.\n\nSimon, from a director’s standpoint, this film is almost equal parts action and comedy. How do you blend those genres together to make it cohesive?\n\nWest: Well, it’s sort of two different sides to your brain, and so one day you’re doing a dramatic scene and I use one side of my brain, and then the next day I’m doing a technical action scene, which is using the other side of my brain. But really when I do action, it’s just making a little short film in itself. So it has to have a beginning, a middle and end. It’s just a little bit more visual and hopefully still character-driven, but it’s not relying on dialogue so much in an action sequence.\n\nSo they’re just two slightly different parts of your brain, but being told by the same person and they still have to work in the same way. You still have to bring the audience along with you…they still have to want to be with those characters in the traumatic scene, and they want to find out what happens in this action scene without just being bombarded. So it’s just that it becomes a reflex after you’ve done it a few times.\n\nIn a world full of action films, what stands out to you about ‘Old Guy’?\n\nLiu: For me, I think it’s about being relevant and when you feel like you still are relevant [but] then the world is telling you that you’re done. That is something that Christoph mentioned in other interviews as well, that you’re not quite accepting the fact that that’s happening—you’re being pushed out and it’s not a great feeling. It’s hurtful.\n\nAt the same time, there’s a reality to what happens as we are mortal people, and how can you stay in the game when everyone else is telling you that you’re washed up? That’s the journey that he’s taking. So it’s brave and it’s, as Simon said before, it’s also a very unusual job. So you can apply that to banking, you can apply that to anything. And in this case, he’s a hit man and he can’t hit the mark he used to.\n\nCatch ‘Old Guy‘ in select theaters and on Digital now.",

Thousands of federal government employees have been laid off or fired in the process.\n\nBy the numbers:\n\nThe federal government consists of about 2.4 million civilians. 20% of them live in the Washington, D.C. region.\n\nThere is no official figure available for the total firings or layoffs, but The Associated Press has confirmed, or learned via sources, and reported the following number of firings in these departments:\n\nAgriculture Department: Layoffs of about 2,000 \"probationary, non-firefighting employees\" were expected\n\nDefense Department: 5,400 probationary workers\n\nDepartment of Health and Human Services: About 700 probationary employees with the CDC, and others at other agencies\n\nDepartment of Homeland Security: 405 probationary staffers\n\nDepartment of Veterans Affairs: 1,000 employees serving for less than two years\n\nEducation Department: At least 39 people\n\nEnergy Department: As many as 350 employees\n\nInspectors general: At least 17\n\nInternal Revenue Service: Cuts are expected soon for thousands of probationary workers, according to sources\n\nJustice Department: More than a dozen career employees\n\nNational Park Service: About 1,000 newly-hired employees\n\nThe other side:\n\nAccording to the agency’s website, as of Feb. 17, 2025, DOGE estimates its savings around $55 billion. The agency attributes this to \"a combination of fraud detection/deletion, contract/lease cancelations, contract/lease renegotiations, asset sales, grant cancelations, workforce reductions, programmatic changes, and regulatory savings.\"",

That's when police say he got out of his vehicle and approached the vehicle he had hit.\n\nMoments later, police say the 73-year-old man was hit by another vehicle and dragged 'a considerable distance.'\n\nThat driver of the Toyota RAV 4 did stop and was a rideshare driver with no passengers at the time of the crash.\n\nPolice say it appears the victim had suffered an injury in that initial crash due to the discovery of blood inside the vehicle.\n\nWhat's next:\n\nThe investigation is active and ongoing with the Crash Investigation Division.",

It’s an unusual arrangement that raises questions about a bureau that’s long been a target of conservatives.\n\n\n\nKash Patel, who was sworn in as FBI director last week, is expected to be named the acting head of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, a Justice Department official told The Associated Press.\n\nIf he’s sworn in as head of the ATF next week as expected, that would put Patel in charge of two of the Justice Department's largest agencies. It’s an unusual arrangement that raises questions about the future of the bureau that’s long been criticized by conservatives.\n\nAs FBI director, Patel is at the top of America’s premier federal law enforcement agency despite concerns from Democrats over his qualifications and the prospect that he will do President Donald Trump's bidding. He was confirmed by the Senate in a 51-49 vote – GOP Sens. Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski voted against him.\n\nRELATED: Elon Musk says federal employees must email ‘what they got done last week’\n\nWhat is the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives?\n\nThe backstory:\n\nATF is a separate agency with about 5,500 employees and is responsible for enforcing the nation's laws around firearms, explosives and arson. Among other things, it's in charge of licensing federal firearms dealers, tracing guns used in crimes and analyzing intelligence in shooting investigations.\n\nU.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi swears in the new Federal Bureau of Investigation Director Kash Patel as his girlfriend Alexis Wilkins holds the Bhagavad Gita in the Indian Treaty Room in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building on February 21, 2025 Expand\n\nThe last confirmed ATF director was Steve Dettelbach, a former federal prosecutor, who led the agency from July 2022 until last month. He was the first confirmed director since 2015 as both Republican and Democratic administrations failed to get nominees through the politically fraught process.\n\nWhat they're saying:\n\nConservatives have long railed against ATF over its role in regulating firearms and have suggested shuttering the agency. Under the Biden administration, the ATF advanced new regulations aimed at cracking down on ghost guns and requiring thousands more firearms dealers to run background checks on buyers at gun shows or other places outside brick-and-mortar stores.\n\nRELATED: Trump fires Joint Chiefs of Staff chairman Gen. CQ Brown Jr.\n\nGun Owners of America, a gun rights group, called his confirmation as FBI director \"a major victory for gun owners and constitutional rights advocates nationwide.\"\n\nIn an executive order earlier this month, Trump directed the attorney general to review all actions taken by the Biden administration around firearms \"to assess any ongoing infringements of the Second Amendment rights of our citizens.\"\n\nRELATED: Here's how US gun ownership has evolved over the past decade, new Gallup poll shows\n\nAfter the directive, Attorney General Pam Bondi fired the ATF's top lawyer. Bondi said in a Fox News interview Friday that she fired chief counsel Pamela Hicks because the agency was \"targeting gun owners.\"\n\nWhy are there concerns about Patel leading the ATF?\n\nThe other side:\n\nGun safety groups have raised alarm about putting Patel in charge of the FBI, with gun control group Brady calling him a \"known gun rights extremist.\"",

The agency attributes this to \"a combination of fraud detection/deletion, contract/lease cancelations, contract/lease renegotiations, asset sales, grant cancelations, workforce reductions, programmatic changes, and regulatory savings.\"\n\nRELATED: USDA accidentally fired bird flu employees and is now trying to rehire them",

        "content": "article\n\nThe Brief The Trump administration is eliminating at least 1,600 USAID positions and placing most remaining staff on leave. A federal judge ruled in favor of the administration’s plan, rejecting employee lawsuits to block the cuts. Workers abroad will keep access to agency systems and emergency communication tools, but many are stranded without clear guidance. A separate judge has temporarily stopped the administration from withholding foreign aid, ordering some funding to be restored.\n\n\n\nThe Trump administration moved its fast-paced dismantling of the U.S. Agency for International Development toward what appeared to be its final phases, telling all but a fraction of staffers worldwide that they were on leave as of Monday and notifying at least 1,600 of the U.S.-based staffers they were being fired.\n\nThe move was the latest and one of the biggest steps in what President Donald Trump and cost-cutting ally Elon Musk say is their goal of gutting the six-decade-old aid and development agency in a broader campaign to slash the size of the federal government.\n\nMore federal layoffs\n\nThe backstory:\n\nIt comes after a federal judge on Friday allowed the administration to move forward with pulling thousands of USAID staffers off the job in the United States and around the world. U.S. District Judge Carl Nichols rejected pleas that came in a lawsuit from employees to keep temporarily blocking the government’s plan.\n\n\"As of 11:59 p.m. EST on Sunday, February 23, 2025, all USAID direct hire personnel, with the exception of designated personnel responsible for mission-critical functions, core leadership and/or specially designated programs, will be placed on administrative leave globally,\" according to the notices sent to USAID workers and viewed by The Associated Press.\n\nCiting a big concern for workers stationed overseas who have reported being cut off from government communications, the notices say that \"USAID is committed to keeping its overseas personnel safe. Until they return home, personnel will retain access to Agency systems and to diplomatic and other resources.\"\n\nRelated article\n\nThe administration said employees put on leave overseas are expected to receive \"voluntary Agency-funded return travel\" and other benefits.\n\nNichols, who was nominated by Trump, said he had been \"very concerned\" about workers in high-risk areas left overseas without access to emergency communications. But he said he has since been reassured by the administration that workers would still have access to two-way radios that allow 24–7 communications in emergencies, as well as a phone app with a \"panic button.\"\n\nThe judge said the government’s statements persuaded him \"that the risk posed to USAID employees who are placed on administrative leave while stationed abroad — if there is any — is far more minimal than it initially appeared.\"\n\nBig picture view:\n\nThe notices of firings and leaves come on top of hundreds of USAID contractors receiving no-name form letters of termination over the weekend, according to copies that AP viewed.\n\nThe blanket nature of the notification letters to USAID contractors, excluding the names or positions of those receiving it, could make it difficult for the dismissed workers to get unemployment benefits, workers noted.\n\nA different judge in a second lawsuit tied to the dismantling of USAID has temporarily blocked the freeze on foreign assistance and said this past week that the administration had kept withholding the aid despite his court order and must at least temporarily restore the funding to programs worldwide.\n\nUSAID’s notice Sunday said it was \"committed to keeping its overseas personnel safe\" and pledged not to cut off USAID staffers abroad from agency systems and other support.\n\nWhat is USAID?\n\nDig deeper:\n\nUSAID offers assistance to countries recovering from disasters, trying to escape poverty, and engaging in democratic reforms, including war-torn Gaza and West Africa also recovering from years of vicious wars. The U.S. is by far the world’s largest donor of humanitarian aid, with USAID administering billions of dollars in humanitarian, development and security assistance in more than 100 countries.\n\nPresident John F. Kennedy created the organization at the height of the Cold War to counter Soviet influence. Congress passed the Foreign Assistance Act in 1961, and Kennedy signed that law and an executive order establishing USAID as an independent agency.\n\nThe U.S. spends less than 1% of its budget on foreign assistance, a smaller share overall than some other nations.",

Action Karate will host a free women’s self-defense and kickboxing class on Saturday, March 15.\n\n\n\nIt’s not unusual for Stephan Venter to perform a strong kick when instructing at Action Karate in Northern Liberties.\n\nHowever, on Thursday, it proved to be successful outside the gym.\n\nWhat we know:\n\nSurveillance cameras captured Action Karate instructor Stephan Venter running out of the building at 3rd and Poplar Streets, after a parent and student waiting for an upcoming class informed him that a woman needed help outside.\n\nShe was yelling that her purse was stolen.\n\n\"I’m just screaming bloody murder like a complete lunatic, like stop him, stop him, stop him, help, help, help to anybody around,\" said Jennifer Romanelli.\n\nRomanelli says she was inside Parkview Dry Cleaners getting her suit altered when a man, who entered the store and was asked to leave repeatedly, suddenly snatched her purse. She says the owner, Lita, took off running first, and she followed.\n\n\"I’m like, ‘I’m going to run and run and run, because I’m not letting this guy get my stuff, like I don’t care, I’m not going to give up.’\"\n\nVenter says he didn’t think twice.\n\n\"I shouted at him, ‘Drop the bag!’ He wouldn’t drop it, I caught up with him, I gave him a kick on the leg,\" he said. \"As I got him a kick on the leg, he dropped the bag, stumbled, and then he kept running away.\"\n\nRomanelli says Lita turned around and told her not only was the man stopped, but that her bag was safe.\n\n\"Literally out of nowhere, like an angel, this guy appears, like a ninja, and he’s like here you go,\" she said. \"I’m like, what the?Is this happening? So her and I are completely stunned.\"\n\nIronically, Stephan had to run back to teach a ninja class, he says. He went back to the cleaners later to make sure everyone was OK, and connected with Romanelli. She says she researched the gym and contacted Venter’s boss to explain his heroism. Venter, who was born and raised in South Africa, has been in Philadelphia for six months.\n\n\"He’s an amazing human,\" she said.\n\nVenter tells FOX 29 he would \"do it again in a heartbeat,\" though he points to 28 years of training and experience, and does not recommend anyone follow in his footsteps.\n\nWhat's next:\n\nThe incident inspired him and Action Karate to host a free women’s self-defense and kickboxing class on Saturday, March 15th at 2:00 p.m.\n\nSpots are limited and you can register by calling 267-225-6006.\n\nRomanelli says without question, she will be there.\n\n\"We can be cynical and the world is crazy and the fact that two humans who don’t know me helped me in need, just makes me have like such a different perspective on things, and just like, you know, have faith in humanity again.\"",

Elon Musk, who’s been tasked with slashing federal spending, said they must reply within 48 hours or risk losing their jobs. Key federal agencies from the FBI and State Department to the Pentagon have instructed their employees not to comply.\n\n\n\nElon Musk’s email to federal employees this weekend requesting \"what they got done\" last week at work has been met with resistance, from key federal agencies to lawmakers.\n\nHundreds of thousands of federal workers were given little more than 48 hours to comply or risk losing their job, sparking confusion.\n\nElon Musk email to federal employees\n\nFILE - Elon Musk, chief executive officer of Tesla Inc., during the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in National Harbor, Maryland, US, on Thursday, Feb. 20, 2025. Photographer: Will Oliver/ EPA / Bloomberg via Getty Images\n\nThe backstory:\n\nElon Musk tweeted on Saturday that all federal employees will be asked to report \"what they got done last week,\" and that failure to reply would be considered a resignation.\n\nShortly afterward, federal employees received a three-line email telling them to share \"approx. 5 bullets of what you accomplished last week and cc your manager.\"\n\nScreenshots of the email sent to FOX Television Stations by a federal employee who wished to remain anonymous. (Images: FTS)\n\nBig picture view:\n\nLayoffs and firings have affected many federal departments in recent weeks.\n\nSince Donald Trump took office in January, one of his top priorities has been cutting and reorganizing spending within the federal government.\n\nThe president has tapped billionaire businessman Elon Musk to lead the so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), which has been tasked with finding and prioritizing what to cut. Thousands of federal government employees have been laid off or fired in the process.\n\nDig deeper:\n\nMusk’s email came just hours after Trump encouraged him on social media to \"get more aggressive\" in reducing the size of the government.\n\nRELATED: Elon Musk says federal employees must email ‘what they got done last week’\n\nReaction to Elon Musk’s email\n\nWhat they're saying:\n\nDemocrats and some Republicans were critical of Musk's directive.\n\nKey federal agencies from the FBI and State Department to the Pentagon instructed their employees not to comply with the request.\n\nLabor unions have threatened lawsuits.\n\nPresident Trump and Musk both posted a meme mocking federal employees.\n\n\"Put a dose of compassion\"\n\n\"If I could say one thing to Elon Musk, it’s like, please put a dose of compassion in this,\" Sen. John Curtin, R-Utah. \"These are real people. These are real lives. These are mortgages. ... It's a false narrative to say we have to cut and you have to be cruel to do it as well.\"\n\nDemands OMP withdrawal\n\nRep. Gerry Connolly, D-VA, demanded Sunday that the Office of Personnel Management withdraw the email.\n\n\"This threat is illegal, reckless, and yet another example of the cruel and arbitrary chaos Mr. Musk is inflicting on the people’s government and its dedicated public servants. You must immediately clarify that federal employees’ nonresponse to this ill-conceived, weekend email does not constitute resignation,\" he wrote .\n\n\"Pause any responses\"\n\nNewly confirmed FBI Director Kash Patel , an outspoken Trump ally, instructed bureau employees to ignore Musk’s request, at least for now.\n\n\"The FBI, through the Office of the Director, is in charge of all of our review processes, and will conduct reviews in accordance with FBI procedures,\" Patel wrote in an email confirmed by The Associated Press. \"When and if further information is required, we will coordinate the responses. For now, please pause any responses.\"\n\nRELATED: FBI Director Kash Patel to take over ATF, reports say\n\n\"The Department will coordinate responses\"\n\nPentagon leadership instructed employees to \"pause\" any response to Musk's team as well.\n\n\"The Department of Defense is responsible for reviewing the performance of its personnel and it will conduct any review in accordance with its own procedures,\" according to an email from Jules Hurst, the deputy undersecretary of defense for personnel and readiness. \"When and if required, the Department will coordinate responses...\"\n\n\"Cruel and disrespectful\"\n\n\"It is cruel and disrespectful to hundreds of thousands of veterans who are wearing their second uniform in the civil service to be forced to justify their job duties to this out-of-touch, privileged, unelected billionaire who has never performed one single hour of honest public service in his life,\" AFGE President Everett Kelley said.\n\n\"AFGE will challenge any unlawful terminations of our members and federal employees across the country.\"\n\nThe other side:\n\nMusk and Trump appeared undeterred.\n\nThey both posted a meme on social media mocking federal employees. The Sunday post featured a cartoon character writing a list of accomplishments from the previous week led by, \"Cried about Trump,\" \"Cried about Elon,\" \"Made it into the office for once,\" and \"Read some emails.\"\n\nTrump posted it to his Truth Social site a few hours after Musk posted it on X .\n\nAccording to DOGE’s official website , as of Feb. 17, 2025, the agency estimates its savings around $55 billion. The agency attributes this to \"a combination of fraud detection/deletion, contract/lease cancelations, contract/lease renegotiations, asset sales, grant cancelations, workforce reductions, programmatic changes, and regulatory savings.\"\n\nWhat's next:\n\nThe deadline to reply was listed as Monday, Feb. 24, at 11:59 p.m., although the email did not include Musk's social media threat about those who fail to respond.\n\nIt’s unclear what the next steps will be this week once the deadline passes.\n\nUSAID workers fired\n\nMeanwhile:\n\nThe Trump administration said it is placing all but a fraction of staffers at the U.S. Agency for International Development on leave worldwide and eliminating at least 1,600 U.S.-based jobs.\n\nThe notices were sent to USAID workers and viewed Sunday by The Associated Press.\n\nBig picture view:\n\nThe move was the latest and one of the biggest steps yet toward what Trump and Musk say is their goal of gutting the 60-year-old aid agency as part of their broader goal of cutting the size of the federal government.",

A lyric change at the 4 Nations Face-Off hockey championship is the latest sign of rising tensions between the U.S. and its longtime ally.\n\n\n\nThe singer who performed the Canadian anthem before the 4 Nations Face-Off championship game Thursday night changed a lyric in \"O Canada\" to protest President Donald Trump’s repeated comments about annexing Canada as the 51st state.\n\nChantal Kreviazuk changed the lyric from \"in all of us command\" to \"that only us command.\"\n\nTrump, meanwhile, repeated his calls for Canada to become the 51st state on Thursday afternoon, before the start of the hockey championship game.\n\nWhy did the Canadian anthem singer change the lyric?\n\nKreviazuk later confirmed that the lyric change was in response to Trump.\n\nWhat they're saying:\n\nDuring Canada’s 3-2 overtime victory, Kreviazuk told The Associated Press that she did it \"because I believe in democracy, and a sovereign nation should not have to be defending itself against tyranny and fascism.\"\n\nRELATED: What would it take for Canada to become the 51st state?\n\n\"I’m somebody who grew up on music that spoke to the heart and the moment, and it shaped me as a songwriter and really as a human being,\" she added. \"I don’t think it would be authentic to me to be given a world stage and not express myself and be true to myself.\"\n\nKreviazuk, who is from Winnipeg, Manitoba, also wrote the phrase \"that only us command\" with mascara on her left hand. She posted a picture of that on her Instagram.\n\n\"I just put it on there so if I ever had a moment and I kind of froze, I would be able to look at my hand and see it,\" Kreviazuk said. \"I’d love to see people sort of get inspired and catch the fire and say their heart more in their art. ... Sometimes you just got to speak the truth in your art and it’s awesome. That’s what it should be about.\"\n\nThe NHL declined to comment.\n\nDid Americans boo the Canadian anthem?\n\nFans in Boston lightly booed Kreviazuk’s version, though it was soon drowned out by her singing. The crowd in Montreal booed \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" prior to U.S. tournament games at Bell Centre last week, more vociferously before the team faced Canada.\n\nWhy are tensions rising between the U.S. and Canada?\n\nBig picture view:\n\nTensions have risen between the neighbors and longtime allies over the past several weeks as Trump has suggested multiple times that Canada become the 51st U.S. state. He’s threatening steep tariffs as a way to force Canada into becoming part of the U.S.\n\n\"I think they have to become the 51st state,\" Trump said Thursday. \"And, you heard the people booing the national anthem, but I think ultimately they'll be praising the national anthem. We'll have to work out some deal with it, because I do like the ‘O Canada’ … It's a beautiful thing. I think we're going to have to keep it for the 51st state.\"\n\nThe other side:\n\nCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has said that will never happen.\n\n\"You can’t take our country — and you can’t take our game,\" Trudeau posted on X after Canada won the hockey championship.\n\nDavid McGuinty, Canada’s Public Safety Minister, said the same when asked about it Thursday.\n\n\"Canada is a sovereign and independent country. It has been for over 150 years and will remain so. This discussion of 51st state is a non-starter,\" McGuinty said.",

This marks Father Judge boys basketball team's first championship win since 1998. FOX 29's Ellen Kolodziej has a recap of the championship.\n\n\n\nFrom the Public League to the Catholic League, it was a battle for the ages!\n\nFather Judge took on Roman Catholic with an ending that felt like this year's Super Bowl.\n\nWhat we know:\n\nRoman Catholic was going for a three-peat and its 35th championship, while Father Judge had not won since 1998, when its coach was a player on the team.\n\nAt the Cathedral of basketball, the trash talk overpowered the prayers.\n\n\"This game means everything to us, everything! Why do they think they can play us? Do they know who we are?\" said Brady Helm of Roman Catholic.\n\n\"We are bringing it back to Solly Avenue for the first time in 25 years. Let's go, let's go, let's go!\" cheered the Judge kids.\n\nIt's the Holy Grail of Catholic high schools, no matter what parish you're from—the Catholic League championship.\n\nThe matchup pitted two all-boys schools with so much tradition and so many faithful fans.\n\n\"It's exciting. You see the kids bought in, and it's nice to have that back at Father Judge. It gives the kids something to remember forever,\" said Brian Patrick King, president of Father Judge High School.\n\n\"A lot of history, a lot of tradition for our alumni, for our students, for our families. This means everything, and we're just excited for a great game!\" said John Prendergast, president of Roman Catholic High School.\n\nAnd they saw a great game indeed! After overcoming a 10-point deficit, the Crusaders of Father Judge slayed the mighty Cahillites of Roman, 41 to 34.\n\nWhat they're saying:\n\nA crushing defeat for Roman, but Coach Chris McNesby was gracious in the defeat.\n\n\"It's a great basketball game. So happy for them. They're a great program. Chris Roantree does a great job. Great for the league. Tough one for our guys. Played hard, competed, but great atmosphere for high school basketball,\" said McNesby.\n\n\"We just made history today. It means a lot to us. Everybody is happy. We did it for the alumni, our family, we did it for each other... yes!\" said Kevair Kennedy of Father Judge.\n\n\"It's the best group of guys you could ever have as a team. I'm just so proud of all of them,\" said the coach.\n\n\"We believed in each other through the ups and downs. After some losses that we took, we didn't stop trusting each other. We kept trusting each other, and this is the result,\" said Nazir Tyler of Father Judge.\n\nIt was a full-circle moment for Coach Jim Roantree and Assistant Coach Jim Reeves, who both played on the last winning Judge team 27 years ago.\n\n\"They doubted us in '98, they doubted us in '25, and we're cutting the nets down again. It's a beautiful thing,\" said Jim Reeves, Father Judge coach.\n\nRoman Catholic obviously put on a brave effort and fought right up until the end, but as some of the Crusaders told Kolodziej, they felt like they were the Eagles stopping the Kansas City Chiefs from a three-peat.",

        "content": ".\n\nThe Brief A possible motive for the deadly hospital shooting in York, Pennsylvania, is still unknown. Officials say the suspect had recent contact with the ICU \"for a medical purpose.\" The hospital remained closed to visitors on Sunday.\n\n\n\nThe man who authorities say entered a Pennsylvania hospital with zip ties and a pistol over the weekend had recent contact with the hospital's intensive care unit, where he took staff members hostage and was killed in a shootout that left a police officer dead and others injured.\n\nWhat we don't know:\n\nInvestigators released no new information Sunday about a possible motive for the shooting at UPMC Memorial Hospital in York on Saturday, in which a doctor, nurse, custodian and two other officers were injured.\n\nWhat they're saying:\n\nYork County District Attorney Tim Barker said during a news conference Saturday that the man — identified as 49-year-old Diogenes Archangel-Ortiz — appeared to have had recent contact with the ICU \"for a medical purpose involving another person.\" He didn’t release any details or identify Archangel-Ortiz’s relationship to the person, citing privacy concerns.\n\nWhile the investigation is in its early stages, Barker said after watching surveillance video and reviewing statements by police and workers that it appeared the shooter intentionally targeted the workers there.\n\nThe backstory:\n\nThe injured hospital workers were reported to be in stable condition Sunday, and UPMC officials said they were \"progressing in their recovery.\" The hospital remained closed to visitors.\n\n\"We know that families and visitors are vital to helping patients heal, and we are working toward making visitation possible again,\" the hospital said in a statement.\n\nBarker said the hospital's own security officers were first on the scene and that the gunman fired at them, prompting a call for backup.\n\nDozens of officers responded from multiple agencies. When they attempted to access the ICU, the gunman was holding a female staff member at gunpoint and ordered police back behind the doors. They complied to ensure the worker wouldn't be hurt.\n\nAuthorities said Archangel-Ortiz ended up entering the hallway with the staff member, her hands bound with zip ties.\n\n\"The officers, left with no recourse, did open fire,\" Barker said, and the gunman was killed.\n\nThe officer who died was identified as Andrew Duarte, 30, of the West York Borough Police Department.\n\nDuarte was a law enforcement veteran who joined the department in 2022 after five years with the Denver Police Department, according to his LinkedIn profile.

Such attacks have contributed to making health care one of the nation’s most dangerous fields, with workers suffering more nonfatal injuries from workplace violence than workers in any other profession, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",

Most of the federal government’s workforce is based outside the Washington, D.C. area.\n\nWhat they're saying:\n\n\"If you’re doing, say, vegetation sampling and prescribed fire as your main work, there aren’t many jobs,\" Eric Anderson, 48, of Chicago, told the Associated Press. Anderson was fired Feb. 14 from his job as a biological science technician at Indiana Dunes National Park.\n\nCathy Nguyen, 51, of Honolulu, was laid off last month from her job at USAID, where she helped manage the PEPFAR program, which combats HIV/AIDS. \"It’s requiring me to rethink how I want to spend my professional life,\" Nguyen shared with the AP.\n\nLawsuit filed over Elon Musk email demand to federal workers\n\nA lawsuit was filed Monday against Elon Musk’s email threat to federal employees that was sent over the weekend. Attorneys for federal workers say in a lawsuit that Musk violated the law with his demand that employees explain their accomplishments or risk being fired.\n\nThe backstory:\n\nElon Musk tweeted during the weekend that all federal employees will be asked to report \"what they got done last week,\" and that failure to reply would be considered a resignation.\n\nRELATED: Elon Musk email to federal employees targeted in lawsuit\n\nMoments later, federal workers received a three-line email telling them to share \"approx. 5 bullets of what you accomplished last week and cc your manager.\"\n\nTrump administration offers buyouts to federal workers\n\nDig deeper:\n\nPresident Donald Trump’s administration is offering buyouts to federal employees to quickly reduce the government workforce through the deferred resignation program.\n\nThe buyouts are for all full-time federal employees except for military personnel, employees of the U.S. Postal Service and those in positions related to immigration enforcement and national security. Workers will receive roughly eight months of salary if they accept the offer, the Associated Press reported.\n\nRELATED: Federal worker buyout deadline: What we know about the deferred resignation program\n\nThis buyout is led by Elon Musk, one of President Donald Trump’s advisers, who has organized a financial incentive for workers to leave their government jobs by offering several months of pay in exchange for their resignation, the Associated Press reported.\n\nHow many government workers are there?\n\nBy the numbers:\n\nThe federal government employs over 3 million people, accounting for 1.9% of the nation’s entire civilian workforce, the Associated Press reported, citing the Pew Research Center. The civilian workforce is about 2.4 million, not including the U.S. Postal Service employees and active-duty military.\n\nAlmost 20% of federal workers are in Washington, D.C., Maryland, and Virginia. California has 147,500 federal employees, but it's less than 1% of total nonfarming employees in the state, the AP noted. Texas has 130,000 federal workers, but that accounts for less than 1% of nonfarming jobs there and Florida has 94,000.",

That figure includes about 5% non-regrettable attrition from 2024, according to the memo.\n\nMeta, which is also the parent company of Instagram , WhatsApp and Oculus in addition to Facebook, has seen its stock rise by about 14.8% since the start of the year.\n\nLast month, Zuckerberg said the company is planning to invest up to $65 billion in the company's artificial intelligence (AI) initiatives.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\nHe wrote in a post on Facebook that 2025 \"will be a defining year for AI,\" and said he expects the company's \"Meta AI will be the leading assistant serving more than 1 billion people, Llama 4 will become the leading state of the art model, and we'll build an AI engineer that will start contributing increasing amounts of code to our R&D efforts.\"\n\nRead more of this story from FOX Business.",

He is set to speak at 2 p.m. and the event will be livestreamed at the top of this story.\n\nGet top local stories in Philly delivered to you every morning. Sign up for NBC Philadelphia's News Headlines newsletter.\n\nThe former leader of this ward, Steven Jones, stepped down from the position over the weekend after he was convicted of aggravated indecent assault of a child under the age of 13, unlawful contact with a minor, corruption of minors and indecent assault of a child under the age of 13, on Feb. 10, 2025.\n\nHis sentencing is scheduled for May 22, 2025.\n\nYet, in an interview with NBC10, Jones said he invited Krasner -- and claimed he also invited Krasner's Democratic primary political opponent Patrick Dugan -- to attend the political event on Saturday, Feb. 22, even though Jones said he had never met Krasner before and didn't endorse any candidate at the event.\n\n“I never endorsed Krasner or anybody else,\" Jones said in an interview on Monday. \"No, I didn’t endorse him. He didn’t ask for no endorsement. He came there as a gentleman, and he left as a gentleman. Took maybe two minutes to introduce myself to him when he came in. And less than a minute when he left. Thanked him for coming. Appreciated him for coming. And that was it.”\n\nIn fact, Jones said, the event was never intended to be about endorsements, instead it was supposed to allow political candidates to come in, get petitions signed and meet with constituents.\n\nKrasner, Jones said, attended, though he had no petitions. He also said Dugan did not attend the event.\n\n\"That was the first time I ever met Krasner, he’ll tell you himself. He didn’t even know who I was. Somebody introduced me at the meeting, said this is your ward leader, Steve Jones,\" said Jones. \"At that time I was a ward leader. And I talked to him for about two minutes and that was it.”\n\nSince that event, Jones said, he has stepped down from the role of ward leader.\n\nHowever, Dugan released a statement on the weekend's event, claiming that Krasner was a \"good friend\" of Jones'. Dugan also claimed he was never invited to the political event.\n\n\n\n“That’s a lie,” Jones said. “I invited Dugan myself down at the Democratic Party last Wednesday.”\n\nTalking after a morning presser, on Monday, Krasner -- a two-term Democrat seeking a third term -- said he wanted to give Dugan until 2 p.m. to rescind his statement.\n\nContacted ahead of Krasner's press availability, Dugan's campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\n\n\nA spokesperson for Krasner’s campaign also told NBC10 neither Jones nor his former ward ever endorsed Krasner. He also said the campaign didn’t find out about Jones’ conviction until Sunday, Feb. 23. The spokesperson said they planned on calling for Jones’ resignation until learning that Jones had already stepped down.",

        "content": "Clint Hill, the Secret Service agent who leapt onto the back of President John F. Kennedy's limousine after the president was shot, then was forced to retire early because he remained haunted by memories of the assassination, died Friday. He was 93.\n\nHill died at home in Belvedere, California, his publisher said. A cause of death was not given.\n\nAlthough few may recognize his name, the footage of Hill, captured on Abraham Zapruder's chilling home movie of the assassination, provided some of the most indelible images of Kennedy's assassination in Dallas on Nov. 22, 1963.\n\nHill received Secret Service awards and was promoted for his actions that day, but for decades blamed himself for Kennedy's death, saying he didn't react quickly enough and would gladly have given his life to save the president.\n\nGet top local stories in Philly delivered to you every morning. Sign up for NBC Philadelphia's News Headlines newsletter.\n\n\"If I had reacted just a little bit quicker. And I could have, I guess,\" a weeping Hill told Mike Wallace on CBS' 60 Minutes in 1975, shortly after he retired at age 43 at the urging of his doctors. \"And I'll live with that to my grave.\"\n\nIt was only in recent years that Hill said he was able to finally start putting the assassination behind him and accept what happened.\n\nOn the day of the assassination, Hill was assigned to protect first lady Jacqueline Kennedy, and was riding on the left running board of the follow-up car directly behind the presidential limousine as it made its way through Dealey Plaza.\n\nHill told the Warren Commission that he reacted after hearing a shot and seeing the president slump in his seat. The president was struck by a fatal headshot before Hill was able to make it to the limousine.\n\nZapruder's film captured Hill as he leapt from the Secret Service car, grabbed a handle on the limousine's trunk and pulled himself onto it as the driver accelerated. He forced Mrs. Kennedy, who had crawled onto the trunk, back into her seat as the limousine sped off.\n\nHill later became the agent in charge of the White House protective detail and eventually an assistant director of the Secret Service, retiring because of what he characterized as deep depression and recurring memories of the assassination.\n\nThe 1993 Clint Eastwood thriller \"In the Line of Fire,\" about a former Secret Service agent scarred by the JFK assassination, was inspired in part by Hill.\n\nHill was born in 1932 and grew up in Washburn, North Dakota. He attended Concordia College in Moorhead, Minnesota, served in the Army and worked as a railroad agent before joining the Secret Service in 1958. He worked in the agency's Denver office for about a year, before joining the elite group of agents assigned to protect the president and first family.\n\nSince his retirement, Hill has spoken publicly about the assassination only a handful of times, but the most poignant was his 1975 interview with Wallace, during which Hill broke down several times.\n\n\"If I had reacted about five-tenths of a second faster, maybe a second faster, I wouldn't be here today,\" Hill said.\n\n\"You mean you would have gotten there and you would have taken the shot?\" Wallace asked.\n\n\"The third shot, yes, sir,\" Hill said.\n\n\"And that would have been all right with you?\"\n\n\"That would have been fine with me,\" Hill responded.\n\nIn his 2005 memoir, \"Between You and Me,\" Wallace recalled his interview with Hill as one of the most moving of his career.\n\nIn 2006, Wallace and Hill reunited on CNN's \"Larry King Live,\" where Hill credited that first 60 Minutes interview with helping him finally start the healing process.\n\n\"I have to thank Mike for asking me to do that interview and then thank him more because he's what caused me to finally come to terms with things and bring the emotions out where they surfaced,\" he said. \"It was because of his questions and the things he asked that I started to recover.\"\n\nDecades after the assassination, Hill co-authored several books about his Secret Service years with Lisa McCubbin Hill, whom he married in 2021.\n\n“We had that once-in-a-lifetime love that everyone hopes for,” McCubbin Hill said in a statement. “We were soulmates.”\n\nClint Hill also became a speaker and gave interviews about his experience in Dallas. In 2018, he was given the state of North Dakota's highest civilian honor, the Theodore Roosevelt Rough Rider Award. A portrait of Hill adorns a Capitol gallery of fellow honorees.\n\nA private funeral service will be held in Washington, D.C., on a future date.",

That election takes place later this year.\n\nGet top local stories in Philly delivered to you every morning.

Around the time of his birthday, the mayor told friends and colleagues that he was thinking of looking for a different job.\n\n\"Respected and admired by all who had the privilege of knowing him, Mayor Perillo led with wisdom, kindness, and a deep sense of duty,\" Terefenko's statement continued.\n\nPerillo may have turned to politics late in life, but he had a long history of service. The mayor was a Navy veteran of World War II and built a long career as a civil engineer, according to a town profile. He was also married to his late wife, Mae, for 64 years.\n\nDuring his 2017 campaign, Perillo wore out two pair of shoes while walking door-to-door. At 93, he handed out more than 7,500 campaign flyers across Tinton falls, a town in Monmouth County of close to 20,000 people.\n\nEvery flyer helped. After the votes were counted, Perillo won his first election by just over 300 votes.\n\nPerillo's service garnered the attention of the state's governor, Phil Murphy.\n\n\"As a World War II veteran and mayor of Tinton Falls, Vito leaves behind an incredible legacy of service,\" Murphy posted to X.",

She was 88.\n\nShe died at home surrounded by her family, publicist Elaine Schock said in a statement. Flack announced in 2022 she had ALS, commonly known as Lou Gehrig's disease, and could no longer sing.\n\nLittle known before her early 30s, Flack became an overnight star after Clint Eastwood used “The First Time I Ever Saw Your Face” as the soundtrack for one of cinema’s more memorable and explicit love scenes, between the actor and Donna Mills in his 1971 film “Play Misty for Me.” The hushed, hymn-like ballad, with Flack’s graceful soprano afloat on a bed of soft strings and piano, topped the Billboard pop chart in 1972 and received a Grammy for record of the year. In 1973, she matched both achievements with “Killing Me Softly,” becoming the first artist to win consecutive Grammys for best record.\n\nGet top local stories in Philly delivered to you every morning.

Jesse Jackson who saw her as a sophisticated, bold presence in the music world and in the social movements of the time. Flack visited Angela Davis while she was in prison and facing charges — for which she was acquitted — for murder and kidnapping.\n\nFlack sang at the funeral of Jackie Robinson, major league baseball’s first Black player, and was among the many guest performers on the feminist children’s entertainment project created by Marlo Thomas, “Free to Be ... You and Me.”",

And now it’s already here.\n\nThe entire NFL world will again take over Indianapolis this week for the annual Scouting Combine and the Eagles will be there too. This time last year, the Eagles had decided to bring back Nick Sirianni but with some major changes to the coaching staff. This year? One of the big storylines of the offseason will be Sirianni’s upcoming contract extension after winning Super Bowl LIX.\n\nThe Eagles are riding high into this offseason but there are plenty of key storylines to follow this week at the combine:\n\nGet top local stories in Philly delivered to you every morning. Sign up for NBC Philadelphia's News Headlines newsletter.\n\nHearing from Howie and Nick\n\nHowie Roseman and Sirianni spoke right after the Super Bowl but haven’t done any mass interviews since. With how late the season ended and because the combine was rapidly approaching, the Eagles’ brass didn’t have any sort of end-of-the-season availability.\n\nSo there are plenty of questions about how the 2024 season ended but also plenty of questions looking ahead to this offseason. We’ll hear from both of them on Tuesday afternoon in Indy.\n\nThis will be our first time hearing from Sirianni since the Eagles promoted Kevin Patullo from passing game coordinator to offensive coordinator. And also our first time hearing from him since news became official that Kellen Moore and Doug Nussmeier were leaving.\n\nRoseman had a pretty incredible 2024 offseason that led to a resurgent year. Can he do it again? What are his top priorities for this offseason? There are several key Eagles set to be free agents.\n\nFree agency will kick off when the negotiating window opens at 4 p.m. on March 10. Until then, the Eagles have exclusive negotiating rights with all their pending free agents. That means players like Zack Baun, Milton Williams, Josh Sweat, Mekhi Becton and more.\n\nBasking in the glory\n\nThe Eagles will get to walk around with their chests puffed out a bit in Indy this week. They’ve earned that. The rest of the league will now be hunting the Eagles and that’s a different place to be for Sirianni — Roseman has been there before.\n\nBut there’s definitely a respect that comes with winning the Super Bowl and you’d imagine that beating up the Chiefs will garner even more.\n\nWhat will BG do?\n\nBrandon Graham entered the 2024 season expecting it to be his 15th and final season in the NFL. He got hurt in November but somehow returned from a torn triceps to play in the Super Bowl after missing just 2 1/2 months.\n\nGraham, 36, played well in Super Bowl LIX in limited action. After the game, he said he wasn’t ready to make a decision about his future, leaving the door open for a possible return. Of course, walking away as a champion after that storybook comeback has to be attractive.\n\nAt some point, the Eagles and Graham will need to figure this out. If he’s coming back, the Eagles will have to figure out the right salary. If he decides to retire, Graham has already said he wants to stay with the organization in some capacity.\n\nHearing from the rest of the league\n\nIn addition to hearing from the Eagles’ brass, we’ll also get to hear from some key decisions makers from the other teams around the NFL. Thirty of 32 NFL teams will have either their head coach or general manager speak in front of a microphone.\n\nBut don’t expect to see a big Kellen Moore press conference. The Saints usually choose to let their coach and GM speak to New Orleans reporters away from the crowds. But we could still hear something from Moore about departure from Philadelphia.\n\nPrepping for the draft\n\nOf course, the real reason the combine exists is to get ready for the NFL Draft. If you feel like you’re a little bit behind on draft prep, don’t worry. The Eagles have been working for a long time to get ready and they still have a couple months.\n\nThis week is a great opportunity to not just see on-field tests but also to meet (formally and informally) with just about all of the prospects in this year’s class. The Eagles got great early returns from their 2024 class and have been on a bit of a roll recently in the draft. They’ll try to keep it going in 2025.\n\nHere’s a reminder of where the Eagles’ picks this year:\n\nRound 1-32 (own pick)\n\nRound 2-64 (own pick)\n\nRound 3-96\n\nRound 4 (from Lions)\n\nRound 5 (from Texans)\n\nRound 5 (from Commanders)\n\nRound 5 (own pick)\n\nSubscribe to Eagle Eye anywhere you get your podcasts:\n\nApple Podcasts | YouTube Music | Spotify | Stitcher | Simplecast | RSS | Watch on YouTube",

        "content": "A side of Jalen Hurts we’ve never seen before, an underrated Eagles position coach and an outrageous snub on a list of the top 101 players in the NFL.\n\n\n\nIt’s crazy how suddenly the offseason kicks into gear when you play in a Super Bowl. The Combine is this week in Indianapolis, free agency is 16 days away and the draft is in just two months.\n\n\n\nHere's our 10 Observations as Philly continues recovering from the parade. It may take a while.\n\n\n\n1. One of the cool things about the Super Bowl aftermath has been seeing Jalen Hurts finally let his guard down and show his personality. And he’s got a hell of a personality, he just never lets anybody other than maybe coaches and teammates and his family see it. So for everybody else to get to see him show some true joy these last couple weeks in videos on the sideline with his teammates in the final minutes of the game, in the locker room during the post-game celebration, at the parade celebrating with a million Eagles fans and in various TV appearances and interviews, it’s been a real treat. This is a side of Hurts the public never saw from the day he got drafted in the spring of 2020 until after the Super Bowl nearly five years later. And it certainly has served Hurts well to hide his emotions and stay on that flat-line that allows him to compete and prepare at the highest level, with no interference from the emotional ups and downs that affect most athletes. But as important as that is to Hurts’ performance, seeing him laughing and smiling and carrying on and getting emotional with his teammates has been amazing. He never showed that side of his personality when he took the Eagles to the playoffs in his first year as a starter, he didn’t show it the first trip to the Super Bowl, he didn’t show it when he finished second in MVP voting. It took 40-22 over the Chiefs for Hurts to finally let everybody see a part of him that’s been suppressed for years. It was definitely worth the wait.\n\n\n\n2. Including regular season and postseason, Milton Williams had 7.0 sacks and Jalen Carter had 6 ½. This is the first time since sacks became an official stat in 1982 that two Eagles interior linemen had 6 ½ sacks in the same season. No other team this year had two interior linemen with at least 6 ½ sacks. Only one other interior linemen 25 or under had at least 6 ½ sacks this year – the Saints’ Bryan Bresee had 7 ½. The last team with multiple interior linemen with 6 ½ sacks in the same season was the 2002 Jaguars with John Henderson and Marcus Stroud. Zack Baun is definitely priority No. 1, but Williams is awfully close.\n\n\n\n3. To really understand just how terrific wide receivers coach Aaron Moorehead has been you have to start by looking at who came before him. From 2012 through 2019, the Eagles had six wide receivers coaches – David Culley, Bob Bicknell, Greg Lewis, Mike Groh, Gunter Brewer and Carson Walsh. And obviously part of it was talent, but it speaks volumes that between 2014, when Jeremy Maclin had his only 1,000 yard season, through 2021, the Eagles didn’t have a single wide receiver with 1,000 yards. But since Moorehead got here in 2020, everything has changed. A-Mo, the only coach remaining that Doug Pederson brought in, has done wonders with DeVonta Smith and A.J. Brown, who now deserve the mantle as best 1-2 WR combo in the NFL. We had so many years with bad receivers around here and just having one guy like DeVonta or A.J. would have seemed like a miracle a lot of those years. Having two? It’s no coincidence that in games both of them have played the Eagles are 51-10. And the only other team with two WRs who have averaged at least 12.5 yards per catch and 65 yards per game since 2022 is the Dolphins with Jaylen Waddle and Tyreek Hill and all that’s gotten them in the three years they’ve been together is no playoff wins (and none for the franchise since 2000). Moorehead, who played in the NFL for five years, has stabilized a position that was a train wreck for much of the last decade. Terrific teacher, terrific communicator, terrific motivator, and he’s definitely brought out the best in Smith and Brown.\n\n\n\n4. Jalen Hurts this year became the first quarterback since Joe Montana in 1989 to complete 75 percent of his passes in a Super Bowl while also averaging 13 yards per completion. Hurts was at 77.3 percent and 13.0 yards per completion against the Chiefs and Montana was at 75.9 percent and 13.5 yards per completion against the Broncos in Super Bowl XXIV, also at the Superdome.\n\n\n\n5. A.J. Brown is 27 and already has five career 1,000-yard seasons. The only players with more 1,000-yard seasons before their 28th birthday are Randy Moss and Mike Evans. Brown has 7,026 yards and a 15.8 career average. The only other players with 7,000 yards and a 15.8 average after six seasons are Jerry Rice, Calvin Johnson, Moss and Torry Holt.\n\n\n\n6. Jake Elliott is 10-for-11 in postseason field goal attempts from at least 40 yards. Every other kicker in Eagles history is 11-for-23.\n\n\n\n7. Three guys who deserve a ton of credit for how they handled the 2024 season are young d-backs Sydney Brown, Kelee Ringo and Eli Ricks. All three had significant roles on defense as rookies in 2023. Brown played 335 defensive snaps in 2023, Ricks played 301 and Ringo 199. And all three showed promise, Brown as a tough, physical safety, Ricks as a tall, rangy corner and Ringo as a speedy playmaker at corner. The Eagles and Cards were the only teams that had three rookie defensive backs playing 150 or more snapss a year ago and when the season ended, it was fair to assume that those guys would have increased roles in 2024, Brown after he healed up from his torn ACL on the last day of the regular season. But things change. All three came back and all three made the 53-man roster. But when you draft Quinyon Mitchell and Cooper DeJean, that’s a lot of reps that are no longer available in the secondary. So Brown dropped 335 snaps to 79 (after missing the first five games), Ricks dropped from 301 to 14 and Ringo from 199 to 112. That’s a net drop of 630 snaps – from 835 to 205. So how did they respond? Brown increased his special teams snaps from 15 per game to about 18 ½ and Ringo increased from 305 to 340, and both were excellent throughout the year on special teams for a Super Bowl championship team. Ricks’s special teams snaps dropped simply because he was only active for a handful of games. But all three handled what could have been a challenging situation like total pros and contributed where they could. If you don’t understand and embrace your role, no matter how big or small, you can’t play for Nick Sirianni. All three of those young d-backs did, and now they all have rings. And potentially bright futures as defensive backs, as well.\n\n\n\n8A. The Eagles have won more playoff games under Nick Sirianni than they won from 1961 through 1999.\n\n\n\n8B. Sirianni has won more playoff games in four years than Buddy Ryan, Rich Kotite, Ray Rhodes, Chip Kelly, Marion Campbell, Mike McCormick, Jerry Williams, Ed Khayat, Nick Skorich and Dick Vermeil combined in 41 years.\n\n\n\n9. Pro Football Focus listing Jalen Hurts as the 91th-best player in the NFL on their list of the top 101 players in the NFL is one of the dumbest things I’ve ever seen. And this is a ranking that includes the postseason. Among the players ahead of him are an edge rusher who had 8.0 sacks for a 4-13 team, a wide receiver who had the 31st-most yards in the NFL for a team that didn’t make the playoffs and a tight end who had the 14th-most catches among tight ends and a disastrous postseason. Just dumb.\n\n\n\n10. Here’s a look at every offensive coach Jalen Hurts has had since he was drafted by the Eagles in 2020. Just imagine what Hurts could accomplish if he ever had the opportunity to stay in the same system over a number of years. That’s a big reason Kevin Pattulo is now offensive coordinator. A new role, but that continuity is huge for Hurts.\n\nDoug Pederson (head coach, play caller, 2020)\n\nRich Scangarello (senior offensive assistant, 2020)\n\nAndrew Breiner (pass game analyst, 2020)\n\nMarty Mornhinweg(senior offensive consultant, 2020)\n\nNick Sirianni (head coach 2021-24, play caller first half of 2021)\n\nShane Steichen(offensive coordinator 2021-22, play caller second half of 2021)\n\nBrian Johnson (quarterbacks 2021-22, offensive coordinator, play caller 2023)\n\nKevin Patullo (pass game coordinator 2021-24, offensive coordinator, 2025)\n\nAlex Tanney (assistant QBs 2022, QBs 2023)\n\nMarcus Brady (senior offensive assistant, 2023)\n\nKellen Moore (offensive coordinator, 2024)\n\nDoug Nussmeier(quarterbacks, 2024)\n\nParks Frazier (passing game coordinator, 2025)\n\nTBA (quarterbacks, 2025)\n\nSubscribe to Eagle Eye anywhere you get your podcasts:\n\nApple Podcasts | YouTube Music | Spotify | Stitcher | Simplecast | RSS | Watch on YouTube",

There were people diving out of the way of bullets. Bullets were coming every direction. And, it was more than people shooting at people. It was more than the endangerment of individuals, for reasons that I think are obvious,\" Krasner said. \"It terrorized people of one particular faith who were celebrating a very sacred and important holiday.”\n\nGet top local stories in Philly delivered to you every morning. Sign up for NBC Philadelphia's News Headlines newsletter.\n\nIn investigating this case, officials said on Monday that law enforcement officials determined that one of the guns used in the shooting had been privately made.\n\nWhile, Krasner said, details were limited as the investigation on this case is ongoing, officials said they were able to trace the manufacturing of the privately produced firearm -- often called a \"ghost gun\" -- to the basement of a home in Delaware County.\n\nOfficials wouldn't say just where this basement was located, but they did say three adults and two juveniles have been charged on allegations that claim these individuals were making and selling firearms.\n\nThe three adults charged, Krasner said, were Chase Freas, 18, Nicholas Luciani, 26, and Shane Scott, 21.\n\nLuciani and Freas are currently in police custody, but Krasner said, Scott remains a fugitive.\n\n“Shane, turn yourself in. This will only get worse,” Krasner said. “It can only help you.”\n\nHow the shooting at a West Philly Eid al-Fitr celebration unfolded\n\nThe shooting happened at about 2:30 p.m. as about 1,000 people were gathered at the Clara Muhammad Square on 47th Street and Wyalusing Avenue around to celebrate Eid al-Fitr, which marks the end of the Islamic holiday, Ramadan.\n\nThe Philadelphia Masjid -- a local mosque -- is located near that park.\n\nLeaders of that mosque, on Monday, noted that individuals involved were not Muslim and were not involved in the celebrations for the day. Instead, they noted the shooting was likely tied to an incident that happened elsewhere but spilled into the mosque's celebrations for the holiday.\n\nPolice have since identified only one of the five people who were arrested on the day of the shooting -- Kahbir Oglesby-Hicks, 21, who has been charged with multiple firearm charges and evading arrest.\n\nThe other suspects that police arrested at that time were all juveniles -- two 15-year-old boys, a 16-year-old girl and a 16-year-old boy.\n\nOfficials have not yet released the identities of these juveniles.\n\nDuring the incident, officials said that officers at the scene observed two groups at the park shooting at each other.\n\nOfficials said responding officers apprehended a man -- Oglesby-Hicks -- along with two teen boys and a teen girl while they were running away from the scene.\n\nThose four suspects were stopped by the officers who recovered four weapons, investigators said.\n\nAlso that day, a police officer shot an armed 15-year-old boy in the left arm and leg. That boy was arrested, as well.\n\nIn discussing this incident, Krasner said the officer involved in that shooting -- who he didn't name, but noted was a woman -- was a hero who may have saved the lives of others by acting quickly when she fired on the armed teen.\n\n“She did the right thing,\" said Krasner. \"She was gutsy. She was courageous.”\n\nAlso, during last year's shootout a man in his 20s was shot in the stomach and a teen was shot in the hands, officials have said.",

He is seeking compensatory and punitive damages in an amount to be determined in court.\n\nKardashian's lawyer said they would \"prefer to solve this without litigation, but of course will defend Kim as needed.\"\n\nGreg Sobo, Cantu's attorney, said given Kardashian's celebrity status and influence she should \"know the power of social media.\"\n\n\"For too long, we have seen social media cause devastating injuries to innocent victims,\" he said in a statement. \"Social media is too often abused to bully the innocent, incite harm, and injure our communities. Just like those who cause physical harm should be held accountable, those who cause injuries to innocent victims through social media must also be held responsible.\"\n\nHe described his client as a \"very private family man with two daughters\" who was grieving a loss at the time Kardashian made her post.\n\n\"As a result of the Kardashian abuse, Mr. Cantu’s privacy was destroyed at a most critical and sensitive time, and he has suffered very real trauma that will last a lifetime,\" Sobo said, adding that they took the matter to court after several failed attempts to reach Kardashian's team.\n\nThis story first appeared on NBCNews.com.

        "content": "Reuben Frank and Dave Zangaro bring back Stay or Go in 2025, trying to figure out the futures of every Eagles player on the roster.\n\nUp first: Quarterback\n\nIan Book\n\nRoob: The Eagles clearly like Book, who was here during the 2022 season and again late this year. He’s never going to play here, but he’s a smart guy who picks up the offense quickly and you could definitely see him going into coaching at some point, and it wouldn’t be surprising if it were here. The Eagles have been a real springboard for quarterbacks who’ve gone into coaching – Mike Kafka, Matt Nagy, G.J. Kinne, Josh McCown, Tee Martin, Thad Lewis and Doug Pederson all spent time as players with the Eagles and are now coaching. So Book may be here, but it won’t be as a player.\n\nGet top local stories in Philly delivered to you every morning. Sign up for NBC Philadelphia's News Headlines newsletter.\n\nVerdict: Goes\n\nDave: The Eagles brought back Book late in the 2024 season when Jalen Hurts was dealing with his concussion and he was even briefly on the active roster. Book has been with the Eagles in just two seasons and the Eagles have gone to the Super Bowl in both of them. Coincidence? … Yeah, probably. But the Eagles obviously liked Book enough to bring him back when they were up against it last year and he’ll still be a phone call away in 2025 if something happens again. But he’s a long shot to actually be on the roster to start the season. Book was a fourth-round pick in 20201 but has played in just one regular season game. He could have a future in coaching if he’s interested.\n\nVerdict: Goes\n\nJalen Hurts\n\nRoob: Tough one, but I do think Hurts will likely be back in 2025 for his sixth season with the Eagles. OK seriously, Hurts may already be the greatest quarterback in Eagles history – 160 touchdowns, six playoff wins, four playoff berths in four years as a starter, two Super Bowl trips in three years, a Super Bowl championship, a Super Bowl MVP – and he doesn’t even turn 27 until August. No quarterback since Davey O’Brien in 1939 and 1940 has started at least 10 games for the Eagles and retired having never played for another team. You never know what the future holds, but you’d love to see Hurts have a career like Ben Roethlisberger, Dan Marino, John Elway, Troy Aikman or Terry Bradshaw and spend his entire career with one team.\n\nVerdict: Stays\n\nDave: The Eagles are probably going to keep the Super Bowl MVP around for another season. There were plenty of questions about Hurts throughout the 2024 regular season and, honestly, the discourse around Hurts is exhausting. Is he elite? Is he top 10? Top 5? Who cares? Three of the best games we have ever seen Hurts play came in Super Bowl LVII, this year’s NFC Championship Game and Super Bowl LIX. Say whatever you want about Hurts but he shows up in the biggest moments. Does that mean he’s a perfect player? No, of course not. And it’s still fair to criticize him when he makes mistakes in the regular season. But the Eagles have a good quarterback who is happy to do whatever it takes to win. He’s the right guy for this team and he’ll soon have a Super Bowl ring for proof.\n\nVerdict: Stays\n\nTanner McKee\n\nRoob: McKee showed enough in his brief appearance vs. the Cowboys and his start against the Giants – four TDs, no INTs, 117.2 passer rating – that teams out there are going to call Howie Roseman just to get an idea what it would take to pry McKee loose. I can’t imagine the Eagles would get offered enough for Roseman to part ways with an awfully promising young quarterback, although if the offer was good enough you have to take it. But I also think McKee is too good to spend 2025 – his third NFL season – as a No. 3. Which brings us to …\n\nVerdict: Stays\n\nDave: Our suspicions about McKee were proven right in 2024. When the former sixth-round pick got a chance to play this season, he was really impressive. While he was inactive most of the season as the Eagles’ third-string emergency quarterback, Pickett in two games completed 30 of 45 passes (66.7%) for 323 yards with 4 touchdowns and 0 interceptions. He’s the second-best quarterback on the roster even though the Eagles never bumped him up the depth chart. I think he’s ready to be their backup quarterback going into 2025. Perhaps, the Eagles would trade McKee if the offer was good enough but they shouldn’t be in a hurry to get rid of the young and talented quarterback. We know the Eagles value the position and he has shown traits that are worth developing.\n\nVerdict: Stays\n\nKenny Pickett\n\nRoob: There’s a lot to like about the way Pickett played in the Dallas and Washington games. He got the ball down the field, threw a couple touchdowns, made good decisions and played very tough. Pickett is only 26, 15-10 as a starting quarterback and just two years removed from being a 1st-round pick and I’m going to guess that there’s a team out there that either plans to draft a quarterback and would like a smart veteran to begin the 2025 season as the starter while mentoring the young guy or already has an underachieving quarterback on the roster and wants a veteran to compete in training camp. If you’re Howie Roseman, you’re sitting there with two capable backup quarterbacks who have some value, and you don’t need two. So I’m thinking the Eagles trade Pickett for a mid-round pick, move forward with McKee as No. 2 and Howie has himself another pick, which would be more useful than having two backup QBs. Howie loves draft picks. I think he turns Pickett into one.\n\nVerdict: Goes\n\nDave: This is a tough one. I absolutely think the Eagles should be open to trading Pickett before the start of the season but I don’t have a lot of confidence that they’ll do it. They traded for Pickett before the 2024 season for a reason and he didn’t do anything to hurt their confidence in him. Part of the reason the Eagles traded for Pickett was because he had two years left on his rookie contract and now the Eagles are going into that second year. In 2024, Pickett completed just under 60% of his passes for 291 yards with 2 touchdowns and 1 interception. He was solid. Could the Eagles be opportunistic and trade Pickett after an injury somewhere in the league? Sure. But, for now, I think Pickett will be around to start the 2025 season. The Eagles are coming off a Super Bowl season and they’ll want the most important position on the field to be loaded.\n\nVerdict: Stays\n\nSubscribe to Eagle Eye anywhere you get your podcasts:\n\nApple Podcasts | YouTube Music | Spotify | Stitcher | Simplecast | RSS | Watch on YouTube",

        "content": "Lester Holt, the anchor and managing editor of “NBC Nightly News” for a decade, announced Monday that he is stepping down from the long-running broadcast at the beginning of the summer.\n\nHolt will continue to be a fixture at the network with a full-time role at “Dateline,” where he has been the principal anchor for almost 15 years, according to a memo shared with network staff Monday.\n\nNBC News did not immediately name Holt’s successor.\n\nHolt was named anchor of “Nightly News” in June 2015 after steering weekend editions of the news broadcast for eight years and co-anchoring “Weekend TODAY” for 12 years. He has served as principal anchor of “Dateline” since September 2011.\n\nGet top local stories in Philly delivered to you every morning. Sign up for NBC Philadelphia's News Headlines newsletter.\n\n“A smile comes to my face when I think that with Nightly News, and Dateline, I have now anchored two of the most successful and iconic television news programs in broadcast history,” Holt wrote in a note Monday to “Nightly” and “Dateline” staffers. “As a 20-year-old radio reporter on the police beat chasing breaking news around San Francisco, I could never have imagined my career path would unfold in the way it has. What an amazing ride.”\n\nIn his 10 years at the helm of “Nightly News,” Holt covered the defining events of the era, including the political rise of President Donald Trump, the Covid pandemic, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the Oct. 7, 2023, attack in Israel and the war in Gaza.\n\nIn recent months, Holt co-anchored the network’s coverage of election night, traveled to Iran for an exclusive interview with President Masoud Pezeshkian and helmed a “Dateline” special about the devastating 2025 Los Angeles wildfires.\n\nHolt’s interviews with world leaders regularly made headlines and set the news agenda. He spoke one-on-one with Trump, former President Joe Biden, former Vice President Kamala Harris, former President Barack Obama, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and other key figures.\n\nHolt frequently traveled to areas hit by deadly hurricanes, tornadoes, wildfires and mass shootings.\n\n“He has led the network during some of the country’s most fraught and challenging times in the past decade,” Janelle Rodriguez, executive vice president of programming for NBC News, wrote in a message to staff. “Quite simply, Lester is the beating heart of this news organization.”\n\nHe has been named the “most-trusted television news personality in America” two consecutive times, according to polls from The Hollywood Reporter and Morning Consult. “Nightly News” is consistently a top television show each week, averaging around 7 million viewers.\n\nHolt also anchors “Nightly News: Kids Edition,” an Emmy-nominated digital newscast geared toward informing and educating children.\n\nHolt, who joined NBC News in 2000, took the helm of \"Nightly News\" from veteran broadcaster Brian Williams, who exited the show after drawing intense criticism for embellishing the details of a helicopter attack in Iraq. Holt was named permanent anchor of the flagship program on June 18, 2015.\n\nHolt arrived at the network after more than a decade at the WBBM-TV station in Chicago, where he served as the afternoon and evening news anchor. He started his television journalism career as a reporter at WCBS-TV in New York in 1981. The following year, Holt moved to Los Angeles to report for KCBS-TV (then known as KNXT) before heading back to WCBS in 1984.\n\nHe has received various industry honors, including Emmy Awards and, in 2019, the esteemed Walter Cronkite Award for Excellence in Journalism.\n\nThis article first appeared on NBCNews.com.

        "content": "Elon Musk’s cost-cutting team is eliminating jobs at the vehicle safety agency that oversees Tesla and has launched investigations into deadly crashes involving his company's cars.\n\nThe National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has cut a “modest” amount of positions, according to a statement from the agency. Musk has accused NHTSA of holding back progress on self-driving technology with its investigations and recalls.\n\nAsked about whether the cuts would impact any probes into Tesla, the agency referred to its statement that says it will “enforce the law on all manufacturers of motor vehicles and equipment.”\n\nThe Department of Government Efficiency, commonly known as DOGE, is an initiative led by Elon Musk with a goal to ”maximize governmental efficiency and productivity.”\n\nGet top local stories in Philly delivered to you every morning.

The agency noted in its statement that the Biden administration had expanded its payroll, suggesting the smaller staff was sufficient to carry out its mission.\n\n“Even with these modest efficiencies, NHTSA is still considerably larger today than it was four years ago,” the statement said. “We have retained positions critical to the mission of saving lives, preventing injuries, and reducing economic costs due to road traffic crashes.”",

        "content": "Attorneys for federal workers said Monday in a lawsuit that billionaire Trump adviser Elon Musk had violated the law with his weekend demand that employees explain their accomplishments or risk being fired.\n\nThe updated lawsuit, which was filed in federal court in California and was provided to The Associated Press, is trying to block mass layoffs pursued by Musk and President Donald Trump, including any connected to the email distributed by the Office of Personnel Management on Saturday. The office, which functions as a human resources agency for the federal government, said employees needed to detail five things that they did last week by end of day on Monday.\n\n“No OPM rule, regulation, policy, or program has ever, in United States history, purported to require all federal workers to submit reports to OPM,” said the amended complaint, which was filed on behalf of unions, businesses veterans, and conservation organizations represented by the group State Democracy Defenders Fund. It called the threat of mass firings “one of the most massive employment frauds in the history of this country.”\n\nMusk, who's leading the Republican president's efforts to overhaul and downsize the federal government, continued to threaten federal workers on Monday morning even as confusion spread through the administration and some top officials told employees not to comply.\n\nGet top local stories in Philly delivered to you every morning. Sign up for NBC Philadelphia's News Headlines newsletter.\n\n“Those who do not take this email seriously will soon be furthering their career elsewhere,” Musk posted on X, his social media platform.\n\nHe also escalated Trump's demand for employees to stop working remotely.\n\n“Starting this week, those who still fail to return to office will be placed on administrative leave,” Musk posted.\n\nThe latest round of turmoil began over the weekend, when Trump posted on Truth Social, his social media website, that “ELON IS DOING A GREAT JOB, BUT I WOULD LIKE TO SEE HIM GET MORE AGGRESSIVE.\"\n\nMusk followed up by saying “all federal employees will shortly receive an email requesting to understand what they got done last week.” He claimed that \"failure to respond will be taken as a resignation.” The directive echoed how the billionaire entrepreneur has managed his own companies.\n\nThe Office of Personnel Management sent out its own request afterwards.\n\n“Please reply to this email with approx. 5 bullets of what you accomplished last week and cc your manager,\" the message said. However, it said nothing about the potential for employees to get fired for noncompliance. The deadline was listed as 11:59 p.m. EST on Monday.\n\nThere was swift resistance from several key U.S. agencies led by the president’s loyalists — including the FBI, the State Department, Homeland Security and the Pentagon — which instructed their employees over the weekend not to respond. Lawmakers in both major political parties said Musk’s mandate may be illegal, while unions threatened to sue.\n\nOne message on Sunday morning from the Department of Health and Human Services, led by Robert F. Kennedy Jr., instructed its roughly 80,000 employees to comply. That was shortly after the acting general counsel, Sean Keveney, had instructed some not to. And by Sunday evening, agency leadership issued new instructions that employees should “pause activities” related to the request until noon on Monday.\n\n“I’ll be candid with you. Having put in over 70 hours of work last week advancing Administration’s priorities, I was personally insulted to receive the below email,” Keveney said in an email viewed by The Associated Press that acknowledged a broad sense of “uncertainty and stress” within the agency.\n\nKeveney laid out security concerns and pointed out some of the work done by the agency’s employees may be protected by attorney-client privilege: “I have received no assurances that there are appropriate protections in place to safeguard responses to this email.”\n\nDemocrats and even some Republicans, including Sen. John Curtis, R-Utah, were critical of Musk’s ultimatum.\n\n“If I could say one thing to Elon Musk, it’s like, please put a dose of compassion in this,” Curtis, whose state has 33,000 federal employees, said on CBS’ “Face the Nation.” “These are real people. These are real lives. These are mortgages. ... It’s a false narrative to say we have to cut and you have to be cruel to do it as well.”\n\nNewly confirmed FBI Director Kash Patel, an outspoken Trump ally, instructed employees to ignore Musk’s request, at least for now.\n\n“The FBI, through the Office of the Director, is in charge of all of our review processes, and will conduct reviews in accordance with FBI procedures,” Patel wrote in an email confirmed by the AP. “When and if further information is required, we will coordinate the responses. For now, please pause any responses.”\n\nEd Martin, interim U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia, sent his staff a message Sunday that may have caused more confusion.\n\n“Let me clarify: We will comply with this OPM request whether by replying or deciding not to reply,” Martin wrote in the email obtained by the AP, referring to the Office of Personnel Management.\n\n“Please make a good faith effort to reply and list your activities (or not, as you prefer), and I will, as I mentioned, have your back regarding any confusion,” Martin continued. “We can do this.”\n\nOfficials at the Departments of State, Defense and Homeland Security were more consistent.\n\nTibor Nagy, acting undersecretary of state for management, told employees in an email that department leadership would respond on behalf of workers. “No employee is obligated to report their activities outside of their Department chain of command,” Nagy wrote in an email.\n\nPentagon leadership instructed employees to “pause” any response to Musk’s team, according to an email from Jules Hurst, the deputy undersecretary of defense for personnel and readiness.\n\nThe Homeland Security Department, meanwhile, told employees that “no reporting action from you is needed at this time” and that agency managers would respond, according to an email from R.D. Alles, deputy undersecretary for management.\n\nThousands of government employees have already been forced out of the federal workforce — either by being fired or through a “deferred resignation″ offer — during the first month of Trump’s second term. There is no official figure available for the total firings or layoffs so far, but the AP has tallied hundreds of thousands of workers who are being affected. Many work outside of Washington.\n\nMusk on Sunday called his latest request “a very basic pulse check.”\n\n“The reason this matters is that a significant number of people who are supposed to be working for the government are doing so little work that they are not checking their email at all!” Musk wrote on X. “In some cases, we believe non-existent people or the identities of dead people are being used to collect paychecks. In other words, there is outright fraud.”\n\nHe has provided no evidence of such fraud. Separately, Musk and Trump have falsely claimed in recent days that tens of millions of dead people over 100 years old are receiving Social Security payments.\n\nMeanwhile, thousands of other employees are preparing to leave the federal workforce this coming week, including probationary civilian workers at the Pentagon and all but a fraction of U.S. Agency for International Development staffers through cuts or leave.\n\nPeoples reported from New York. Associated Press writers Byron Tau, Ellen Knickmeyer, Matthew Perrone and Tara Copp in Washington and Valerie Gonzalez in McAllen, Texas, contributed to this report.",

        "content": "1 officer dead, 5 others injured in shooting at Pennsylvania hospital\n\nOne officer was killed and at least five others were shot in a hostage situation at a hospital in York County, Pennsylvania, on Saturday, according to state officials.\n\nThe suspect, Diogenes Archangel Ortiz, entered UPMC Memorial in West Manchester Township with a semi-automatic handgun and zip ties at around 10:30 a.m. He then went to the ICU and took several hospital staff hostage, officials said at a press conference Saturday afternoon.\n\n\"This is a huge loss to our community,\" York County District Attorney Tim Barker said at a press conference Saturday. \"Officer Duarte gave his life protecting others.\"\n\nOrtiz shot a hospital doctor, nurse and custodian, all of whom are now stable, officials said. Three police officers were shot during the incident and one died.\n\nWest York Borough police officer Andrew Duarte was killed in the shooting, the borough confirmed. The other two officers were hospitalized in stable condition.\n\nLaw enforcement from multiple agencies, including West York Borough Police, Pennsylvania State Police, and the York County Quick Response Team, responded to the situation. Officers attempted to negotiate with Ortiz, but he emerged from the ICU holding a hospital staff member at gunpoint, her hands bound by zip ties.\n\n\"The officers were left with no recourse,\" Barker said. \"They opened fire, killing Ortiz and preventing further loss of life.\"\n\n\"After reviewing surveillance footage and witness statements, it is absolutely clear and beyond any doubt that the officers acted lawfully in using deadly force,\" he said. \"Quite frankly, they needed to-because by doing so, they potentially saved even more lives.\"\n\nUPMC said no patients have been injured.\n\nPolice say Ortiz may have been motivated by the care provided to a terminally ill relative.\n\nA senior law enforcement official tells ABC News that the gunman had trouble accepting that his family member was terminally ill, and was upset over a perceived lack of care.\n\nThat family member died within the last week.",

He produces all products from the hive, from an assortment of honeys to beeswax candles, including his most unusual offering from a hive that smelled like maple bacon.

He tested the honey out at a cheese and honey pairing at the Free Library and says it was the hit of the night.\n\nDon manages about 150 hives in neighborhoods around the city with the zip code on top of his jar indicating the bee's foraging grounds.

All have had cancer before age 50.\n\nWhile scientists work on finding out why cancer is hitting adults younger these days, these patients have unique needs to be met.\n\nLuckily, there is a new program in Philadelphia for that.\n\nIt's a sobering statistic - although colorectal cancers are down overall, they're hitting those 50 years of age and younger harder.\n\n\"Between 2011 and 2019, the rates have increased by almost 2% per year,\" says Dr. Christopher Cann, a Gastrointestinal Oncologist at Fox Chase Cancer Center.\n\nBecause of that, Dr. Cann says many young adults may have a different future than their parents.\n\n\"About a two times increased risk of colon cancer and a four times increased risk of rectal cancer,\" he notes.\n\nAnd Dr. Cann says the symptoms can be vague.\n\n\"Fatigue, abdominal pain, and then rectal bleeding,\" are the most common.\n\nThe bleeding is often assumed to be hemorrhoids, so patients are slow to see a doctor, according to one survey.\n\n\"41% of patients within that age group waited over six months before seeking medical attention, and two thirds of patients saw two or more physicians before they were even diagnosed,\" he says.\n\nSo the cancers are more often advanced, and harder to treat.\n\nWith 17 cancers in all rising among those under 50, Fox Chase has created Philadelphia's first Young Adults Cancer program, for 18 to 39-year-olds.\n\n\"They're beginning their careers. They're beginning a family. They're in the midst of education. They're often not financially stable,\" Dr. Cann says.\n\nIt goes beyond medical care, to include social work, psychiatry, psychology, financial guidance, child care guidance - and preserving their fertility.\n\n\"We've already seen a significant increase in referrals to onco-fertility. So I think it was a 450% increase,\" he says.\n\nIt's all designed to lessen the stress of daily life, so patients can focus on their cancer care.\n\nSimilar programs elsewhere have had good results.\n\n\"Depression rates are lower, anxiety rates are lower. People are following up more,\" he adds.\n\nDr. Cann says clinical trials specifically for young adults are also in the offing. The first three should open in about six months.",

        "source": "https://metrophiladelphia.com/",
        "content": "Sign up for our Gay City News email newsletter to get news, updates, and local insights delivered straight to your inbox!\n\nEric McGinty’s “Stockade,” made in 2023, has only screened at two film festivals prior to its arrival on VOD. Given the amount of gatekeeping that goes on behind the scenes, that’s not necessarily a sign of its lack of quality. In this case, it turns out to be one. “Stockade” displays technical incompetence in acting, writing, and editing, stretching out a story that might fill a 20-minute short to a painfully elongated 88 minutes. If it were a student film, that’d be one thing, but as a work sent out into the world by a director with another feature and two shorts under his belt, it’s an embarrassment.\n\nAhlam (out actor Sarah Bitar) is lying in bed when she receives a call from her mother in Lebanon. The artist is now trying to make a go of life in Brooklyn, but she has difficulty earning a living. She works as a babysitter to an Arab-American child, whose mother insists Ahlam speak to her in Arabic. Paul (cinematographer Guy de Lancey), who has been injured in a recent accident and now needs a cane, offers her a well-paying job. Since he can’t leave his apartment, he asks her to travel upstate to a house in Kingston with a package. For all the errand’s mystery, he assures her she’s not being used as a drug mule. When she arrives at the house, she opens the package and finds artwork from Iraq. Richard (McGinty) arrives to collect it, promising he’ll return the next day. He does not show up. Instead, a couple confront Ahlam. The man gives her a bottle of water laced with drugs, and once she passes out, the two kidnap her.\n\nMany of the basic elements of filmmaking grammar become far more visible in their absence. “Stockade” is not an experimental film. It would love to be a thriller, but its editing and writing generate no tension. In fact, its cuts are subtly jarring, making for a grating experience. Why does it take its eye away from two women’s conversation to insert a brief shot of a pool of carp? Why does a shot-reverse shot sequence going back and forth between people in the room look as though the lighting and cinematography are far different for each person? Why didn’t McGinty recognize that the color grading needed to be done carefully, so that these shots match each other? Full of unintended awkwardness, most dialogue scenes exist solely to drop a piece of information, supposedly pushing the narrative forward. The script may as well be the product of an AI who has never actually heard two people engaged in small talk.\n\nBitar’s performance leaves her character’s emotions barely visible. After being drugged, kidnapped, escaping and returning home to Brooklyn, Ahlam shows few signs of these events’ long-term impact. In real life, she would probably be more tense meeting a stranger alone in her studio afterwards. “Stockade” never establishes the time frame of these events. Do weeks or months go by between her escape and her return to a painter’s life back in Brooklyn?\n\nFor a film based around the struggle to stay our of poverty and retain a visa to stay in the US, it can’t create an aura of danger. (Mc Ginty describes it as an “immigrant film noir,” stating his desire to center “characters and situations that are under-represented in most mainstream films.”) Even the kidnappers are as polite and unthreatening as they could possibly be. While the precariousness of an immigrant’s life is part of the story, it never feels truly inhabited. Nor is there the slightest anger behind the references to America’s wars in the Middle East and the history of looting antiquities for Western museums. It’s all just a story, badly told.\n\n“Stockade” | Directed by Eric McGinty | In English and Arabic and French with English subtitles | Freestyle Digital Media | Available on VOD Feb. 25th",

        "content": "Sign up for our Daily Email newsletter to stay up-to-date on the latest local news throughout Philadelphia.\n\nTickets are now on sale for the new Edelman Fossil Park & Museum of Rowan University (EFM) in South Jersey—and it’s as big and prehistoric as it sounds.\n\nThe venue, which explores the world of dinosaurs, is set to open to the public on March 29, and with it comes 44,000 square feet across 123 acres overlooking a 4-acre fossil-rich quarry.\n\n“Our goal with the museum is to bring back that childlike sense of wonder and help people feel a deeper connection to the incredible history of our planet,” said Dr. Kenneth Lacovara, founding executive director of the Edelman in a statement.\n\n“Right here in South Jersey, we’ve preserved millions of years of history in stunning detail, with each fossil telling its own unique story. We want visitors to feel like they’re stepping into the world of dinosaurs and walk away feeling inspired, empowered, and ready to make a difference for the future.”\n\nAlongside its exhibits, the world-class institution will also include a unique fossil dig experience, a free-roam virtual reality adventure, personalized interactive encounters, and a dinosaur-themed playground. As a release notes, the goal is to offer a unique blend of scientific discovery and exploration for all ages.\n\nLocated 20 minutes from Philadelphia, highlights of the EFM include a Dinosaur Coast Gallery (an interactive environment depicting the lives of East Coast dinosaurs from 66 million years ago) and the Monstrous Seas Gallery (an immersive underwater journey through the primitive depths of the Cretaceous ocean, featuring a 55-foot mosasaur and other species found on the Fossil Park’s property.)\n\nVisitors can also find the Critter Cove and the Discovery Forest. The former allows families to meet the modern-day relatives of different and well-known Cretaceous creatures, while the latter boasts a nature-themed adventure that explores the Earth’s history and evolution. The Discovery Forest ultimately ends at the venue’s TED-Ed theater, where “animated films make science come alive.”\n\nThe new Edelman Fossil Park & Museum also features the Hall of Extinction & Hope. As a release describes, this “inspiring” exhibit explores the Fifth Extinction, the catastrophic moment when an asteroid impact ended the reign of the dinosaurs, and different action steps to save our planet for future generations.\n\nUpon opening, there’s also the Virtual Reality portion (which is classified as a Premium Experience.) This free-roam VR journey follows an Expedition Voyager mission to collect scientific samples and come face-to-face with dinosaurs and Cretaceous creatures. Other amenities at Edelman span the Quarry Grounds Cafe, Darwin & Co. Retail Store, Outdoor Nature Trails, Cretaceous Gardens, outdoor family activities and plenty more.\n\nAdditionally, EFM’s Quarry Dig Experience (another premium add-on), happens to be the mega-popular attraction that inspired the creation of the museum in the first place.\n\nWith the dig, visitors can experience paleontology by digging for real fossils and explore the ongoing scientific work being conducted by Rowan scientists and students. Learning guides throughout the site will be there to provide context, and this 90-minute experience includes an orientation, the dig itself, and fossil identification with the venue’s Fossil Guides.\n\nThis particular portion of the museum will be open seasonally from May to October, and digs will officially begin on Thursday, May 1. It’s recommended to book your spot well in advance as well.\n\nGeneral admission tickets ($24-$29) to the Edelman Fossil Park & Museum give you all-day access to the museum’s galleries including full-scale dinosaurs, an interactive fossil scavenger hunt, and all of the exhibits mentioned before. With the free-roaming Expedition Voyager virtual reality or the Quarry Dig Fossil Experience (prices vary), guests may make a reservation by selecting a visit date and entry time during purchase. Premium add-on availability is based on your entry time.\n\nTo find out more information on Edelman (66 Million Mosasaur Way, Sewell, New Jersey) visit efm.org",

        "source": "https://metrophiladelphia.com/",
        "content": "Sign up for our email newsletter to stay up-to-date on the latest local sports news throughout Philadelphia.\n\nPro Football Focus listed a collection of Super Bowl Champion Philadelphia Eagles among the top 101 performances from the 2024-25 NFL season. Eleven Birds were selected, with the six offensive stars barely outpacing the five defenders. Offensive Lineman Jordan Mialata led the way, as he did for Saquon Barkley this season, landing as the third-best player in the NFL according to that publication. If you squint really hard, you can find Super Bowl LIX MVP Jalen Hurts near the end of the text….as the eighth-best NFL QB from the NFL this season.\n\nTwo Top 10 Players in Philadelphia\n\nEven with missing some time due to injury, Mialata still placed in the “bronze medal” position. The massive 6-foot-8 lineman allowed only two sacks this year while having one of the most dominant seasons a lineman has seen since 2006. He was equally effective in pass-blocking and run-blocking, allowing the Australian to earn such high praise from PFF.\n\nDespite being the only 2,500-yard rusher the NFL has ever seen, Saquon Barkley had the tenth-best performance of the season and second-best running back campaign behind Baltimore’s Derrick Henry. His 2,504 total yards smashed Terrell Davis’ combined regular season and postseason rushing mark. Barkley’s elusiveness was a significant factor in the ranking for the running back, described as “the Eagles closer” due to having the most touches, yards, and scores of all NFL running backs in the fourth quarter this season. Has anyone checked if Barkley can toss a baseball? Just checking for some friends in sunny South Florida.\n\nThree More Birds Inside Top 30 NFL Players\n\nFootball – NFL – Super Bowl LIX – Philadelphia Eagles v Kansas City Chiefs – Caesars Superdome, New Orleans, Louisiana, United States – February 9, 2025 Philadelphia Eagles’ Zack Baun celebrates with Josh Sweat after intercepting the ball REUTERS/Mike Segar TPX IMAGES OF THE DAY\n\nBehind Barkley is the publication’s 2024 Breakout Player of the Year, Zach Baun, at Number 11. The free agent signed with Philly on a 1-year “prove it” deal… and well, Baun did that and some, earning his first All-Pro selection with the NFL’s highest-rated linebacker play in 2024. Baun excelled in both facets of the run-and-pass game, leading to a Super Bowl Championship for Philadelphia. Baun’s bet on himself last season should pay out handsomely for the 28-year-old defender this summer.\n\nThe second Eagles lineman lands on the list at #18, thanks to Lane Johnson’s excellence at the tackle position. Johnson had one of the most productive seasons of his career en route to his second Lombardi trophy. Like Mialtata (and Baun), his all-around dominance in the pass-and-run scheme propelled the 34-year-old lineman to the best overall grade of his career. The five-time Pro Bowler allowed only one sack this season, which occurred during the final quarter of the Eagles’ victory over Kansas City in New Orleans.\n\nA.J. Brown marks the first appearance of an Eagles wide receiver in the Top 101. Philly’s pass catcher was the NFL’s best-ranked wideout in 1-0n-1 coverage this season – something that Jalen Hurts utilized brilliantly in the postseason on several occasions. Brown finished with over 1,000 receiving yards for the fifth time in his six-year NFL career. He is signed through 2029 in Philadelphia.\n\nRelated: Eagles WR A.J. Brown supports new OC Kevin Patullo, states changes will need to be made\n\nEagles Rookies Receive Recognition\n\nFootball – NFL – Super Bowl LIX – Philadelphia Eagles v Kansas City Chiefs – Caesars Superdome, New Orleans, Louisiana, United States – February 9, 2025 Philadelphia Eagles’ Cooper DeJean celebrates during the game REUTERS/Mike Segar\n\nCooper DeJean (#45) and Quinyon Mitchell (#78) surprised a bunch of NFL front offices with their seamless transition to the pro level. Everyone in Philadelphia can recall where they were when DeJean returned a Patrick Mahomes pass to the painted turf for a touchdown during Super Bowl LIX. However, Vic Fangio’s defense gained momentum once a healthy DeJean was added to the starting line-up in October. The Eagles lost only one game this season with the rookie in the cornerback slot as he locked down a position that Philadelphia ranked last in at the end of the 2023 season.\n\nSpeaking of locking things down, Eagles’ rookie Quinyon Mitchell (#78) placed sixth among qualifying players in coverage this season… and the second-best rookie behind the guy you just read about, DeJean. The first-round pick out of Toledo erased any doubts anyone had about his ability to perform at the NFL level coming out of a smaller college with a stellar freshman season for Philly. Mitchell was sixth among qualified cornerbacks in coverage this season.\n\nHurts Barely Lands on List at 91\n\nFeb 9, 2025; New Orleans, LA, USA; Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Jalen Hurts (1) warms up before the second half of Super Bowl LIX at Caesars Superdome. Mandatory Credit: Geoff Burke-Imagn Images\n\nThe remaining four Eagles include a QB-protector, a duo of threats to the opposing quarterback, and the Super Bowl MVP-QB himself. Landon Dickerson (#64), Jalen Carter (#77), Milton Williams (#90), and Jalen Hurts (#91) round out the impressive total of Philadelphia football players inside the Top 101.\n\nOn the defensive side of the ball, there was no sophomore slump for Carter as he continued to reward the Eagles selection. The interior defender was rated as the fourth-best pass rusher in their metrics, with a 13% win rate when attacking the opposing QB during the 2024 season. Teammate Milton Williams cranked it up in the postseason as PFF’s best-graded pass rusher en route to becoming a household name with a strip sack of Mahomes in the fourth quarter of the Super Bowl win.\n\nHurts might not have been on the list without a strong offseason performance. The publication claimed the late entry for Hurts (and Milton Williams) was “due to exceptional performances in the postseason.” Three turnovers in three months since the Eagles’ October bye week only go so far in this economy, folks. No matter, as Nike said, “Love Hurts,” and Philly’s star QB will continue to try to prove the doubters wrong.\n\nMandatory Credit: Bill Streicher-Imagn Images",

After years of detailed plans and delays, the long-decaying ship, SS United States, has finally left Pier 82 on the Delaware River. Now, after three decades, it’s on its way to becoming an artificial reef off the coast of Florida.\n\nIn 2024 — the SS United States which is docked on the Delaware River — was vandalized. The suspects have been identified on camera breaking into the old ship, but have not been apprehended. The retired ocean liner — docked at Pier 82 in Philadelphia since 1996 — was the only one of its kind to be completely manufactured in the United States with the potential to carry troops in wartime. Since her maiden voyage in 1952 — it still holds the record for the fastest liner to make the trip across the Atlantic in either direction.\n\nLast month — also on the Delaware River — we saw those images of the USS John F. Kennedy being towed down the Delaware River. For those of us who are old enough to remember when the USS John F. Kennedy was christened by Jackie Kennedy and a then 9-year old Caroline in 1967 — only days away from what would have been JFK’s 50th birthday.\n\nOriginally supposed to be classed in the Kitty-Hawk of Aircraft Carriers — the USS John F. Kennedy actually was modified to such an extent during construction — that the ship formed its own class. After 40 years of service including in the Yom Kippur War of 1973 and Operation Desert Storm in 1991 — she would arrive at Pier 4 at the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard in March 2008 — where it had been docked for upgrades some 20 years before.\n\nPhiladelphia’s Maritime history harkens back to the very inception of our European settlements. The Port of Philadelphia came to life as part of William Penn’s famous Charter of 1701 — and prior to being surpassed by the Port of New York — was our busiest during the formative years of our nation.\n\nOur city’s nautical history originates nearly from the moment that William Penn decided on a site for Philadelphia — the perfect place for a metropolis at the conjoining of two rivers. It’s been a rich history for nearly 343 years.\n\nMichael Thomas Leibrandt is member of the York Road Historical Society and lives and works in Abington Township.",

Nola has been a longtime partner with Team Red, White, & Blue, a nonprofit organization that aims to support former troops who have returned home from service.\n\nThe charity and efforts are near and dear to Aaron’s heart. “Team Red, White & Blue is a remarkable organization, and I’m thrilled to announce this new charity poker tournament to benefit our veteran community,” said Nola. “It is our hope to raise more than $250,000 for this important cause, and I look forward to joining my teammates, partners and fans for a fun evening at the ballpark on May 15.”\n\nAaron Nola and Kyle Schwarber. Photo Credit Matt Watson / Philly Sports Network\n\nNola Gives Back\n\nPartering with both Team RWB and Yuengling, Aaron and his wife Hunter have hosted two events in recent years to raise money for the organization. Those events had taken place at Brooklyn Bowl in Philadelphia, and Nola’s friends, family, and teammates joined him for a fun evening of bowling.\n\nThis year, Aaron is switching it up.

Mandatory Credit: Mike Watters-Imagn Images\n\nSign up for our email newsletter to stay up-to-date on the latest local sports news throughout Philadelphia.\n\nSpring Training Baseball is upon us as the Philadelphia Phillies have completed the first two games of their 2025 Spring Training slate. The Phillies dropped both contests to the Detroit Tigers and the Baltimore Orioles by respective scores of 7-6 and 6-1.\n\nFour Phillies slugged home runs over the first two games while several big leaguers began to get their reps in as well.\n\nHow the Games Progressed\n\nThe first bit of Spring Training action came a short drive away in Lakeland, Fla., against the Tigers. After a scoreless first two frames, Cal Stevenson notched the first base hit of the Spring for the Phillies, a double into left field. The first baserunner then became the first run scored as Johan Rojas fought off a slider inside to bring in Stevenson. Following a walk from Bryson Stott and an Alec Bohm single, Max Kepler batted in two of his new teammates on a single of his own to give the Phillies a 3-0 lead.\n\nKepler worked a walk in his next plate appearance, putting a runner on base for Buddy Kennedy as he slugged the Phillies’ first home run of the spring. Weston Wilson had earned the honor both of the previous two springs but was recently shut down for six weeks due to a strained oblique.\n\nThe Phillies notched one more run on the day, a solo home run from Josh Breaux, a catcher who the Phillies picked up last year after he was released by the New York Yankees.\n\nThe Phillies did drop the game 7-6, but none of the pitchers who appeared in the contest project to make the Phillies’ Opening Day roster.\n\nFeb 22, 2025; Lakeland, Florida, USA; Philadelphia Phillies catcher Rafael Marchn (13) bats during the second inning against the Detroit Tigers at Publix Field at Joker Marchant Stadium. Mandatory Credit: Mike Watters-Imagn Images\n\nIn Sunday’s home opener against the Orioles, the Phillies found themselves down quickly. Tyler Phillips, who recorded seven starts with the Phillies in 2024, allowed three runs over two innings against the Orioles.\n\nThe Orioles picked up four additional runs over the course of the fourth, fifth, seventh, and ninth innings against pitchers Kyle Tyler, John McMillon, Tristan Barnett, and Cody Stashak.\n\nIn proper Philadelphia style, the long ball was the source of much of the Phillies’ offense. Christian Arroyo slugged a solo shot onto the left field concourse in the bottom of the third.\n\nA few innings later, in the bottom of the seventh, prospect Justin Crawford slipped a single through a defensive shift before Gabriel Rincones Jr. hit a two-run shot over the berm in right center field.\n\nOverall, the Phillies dropped the contest 7-3.\n\nTakeaways from Phillies Early Start\n\nEvery player that steps onto the diamond wants to win on any given day, but Spring Training has no weight to wins and losses whatsoever. The important thing is allowing players to get work in, figure out position battles, and stay healthy throughout the process.\n\nThe most interesting players to follow after the first two games are Buddy Kennedy and Cal Stevenson. Both will battle for what is likely the final roster spot, a backup outfield/utility position. Both players are 1-for-4 thus far with an extra base hit, a run scored, and a walk. Kennedy’s hit went a lot further, but Stevenson has plenty of time to make his case. Following Wilson’s injury, the battle will likely come down to Kennedy, Stevenson, and Kody Clemens, all of whom saw time in the big leagues in 2024. Clemens is 1-for-2 thus far.\n\nAlec Bohm, Johan Rojas, Nick Castellanos, Brandon Marsh, Kyle Schwarber, Bryson Stott, and Edmundo Sosa have all seen action thus far for the Phillies. Phillips is the only familiar face to pitch for the Phillies in the first two contests.\n\nTop prospects Aidan Miller and Justin Crawford made appearances in both games over the weekend. The pair are likely to not make an impact at the Major League level this season, but they have the potential to be cornerstone pieces of the Phillies’ lineup for years to come.\n\nFeb 22, 2025; Lakeland, Florida, USA; Philadelphia Phillies outfielder Cal Stevenson (47) catches a fly ball during the first inning against the Detroit Tigers at Publix Field at Joker Marchant Stadium.

The contest will start at 1:05 P.M. and will be broadcast on NBC Sports Philadelphia+.\n\nCristopher Sanchez is scheduled to start on Monday with Joe Ross slated for the start on Tuesday at the Tampa Bay Rays. Zack Wheeler and Jesus Luzardo are also slated to make their Spring Training debuts later this week for the Phillies.",

Mandatory Credit: Kyle Ross-Imagn Images\n\nIt’s been a running thought by fans and even national media members that Embiid should simply have the surgery and prepare for next season ever since first mentioned the idea. The only problem is that this supposed surgery may not even exist.\n\nThere are many types of knee injuries, multiple that involve the meniscus as well. Simply put, it all depends on what is actually wrong with his knee. Is it a matter of debris or another tear? Neither of those possibilities has been reported or even hinted at. Is it a matter of Embiid having virtually or literally no more cartilage in his knee? Considering his injury history, this seems far more likely. However, there is no clear surgical option in this case.\n\nNov 20, 2024; Memphis, Tennessee, USA; Philadelphia 76ers center Joel Embiid (21) limps to the bench during a time out during the second half against the Memphis Grizzlies at FedExForum. Mandatory Credit: Petre Thomas-Imagn Images\n\nMicrofracture surgery has proven time and time again to hurt more than it’s helped for NBA players. Without a tear, there is no ability to perform a meniscus repair surgery, nor is there a point to another meniscectomy in that case.\n\nOne frequently suggested surgery is known by some as the Lonzo Ball surgery; to many more, it’s known as a meniscal allograft transplantation or meniscus transplant. While the early results are somewhat positive for Ball, the difference between Ball and Embiin in both age and body size provides significantly different — less positive — optics for recovery.\n\nWhatever the Sixers and Embiid jointly decide, they will need to put a lot of man-hours into their research. With 26 games left this season and the Sixers currently being 16 games below .500, this is as clear a sign as any to waive the white flag on Joel Embiid’s season, barring some miracle cure.\n\nFor the latest breaking news on your Philadelphia 76ers and other Philly sports, follow Zach Ciavolella on X — @CiavoNBA and Bluesky — @ciavo.bsky.social",

Animal welfare groups rescued a dozen horses from the property – several of which were injured – along with a pig and a goat.\n\nSurveillance video distributed by the PPD on Monday shows a man walking in the area moments before flames emerged from the pop-up stable.\n\nPolice described the suspect as a white man with a thin build who was wearing dark-colored pants, a gray long sleeve shirt and a black hat. Anyone with information is asked to contact the City Wide Arson Task Force at 215-783-1092 or call or text the police tip line, 215-686-TIPS (8477).\n\nThe Pennsylvania SPCA is caring for the horses that survived the fire, while ACCT Philly took custody of the goat and pig.\n\nACCT Philly, the city’s animal care and control provider, said in a Facebook post last week that it “appears the stable was operating as a business and people were boarding their horses at the property.”\n\nThe organization said citations were issued Feb. 16 following a visit to the site, and that ACCT Philly was working with the city to address the situation. Philadelphia residents are permitted to own horses but are supposed to go through a licensing process.",

        "content": "Sign up for our email newsletter to stay up-to-date on the latest local sports news throughout Philadelphia.\n\nPhiladelphia Flyers head coach John Tortorella and his wife, Christine Tortorella are incredibly passionate about rescues and animal welfare. The Tortorella’s have “The John and Christine Tortorella Family Foundation,” which features “Bear’s Angels,” is a program that partners with rescues and shelters that help homeless and abused animals. “Enlighten Your World… READ!” also helps with reading and writing skills.\n\nThe Tortorella’s are also passionate about “Hockey & Hounds.” The pair works locally with the Pennsylvania SPCA (PSPCA) and Philadelphia Animal Welfare Society (PAWS) through the Hockey & Hounds program. Each week, Hockey & Hounds features a rescue dog of the week. This week, the pup is an 11-month-old named King! During the Flyers Charities Carnival, the head coach spoke candidly about his love for animals and what inspired him to impact the community.\n\nQ: What got you involved with “Hockey & Hounds?”\n\nJT: “It orginated out in Columbus. Anthony Rothman, who does a radio show out there, we became friends. He does the real stuff, watching out for these dogs. So, as big sports guys, we connected and talked about hockey as long as we talked about animals. That’s the deal we made. Hundreds of dogs were adopted in Columbus in my six years there. Philadelphia is probably the best organization my wife and I have been involved with that understands how badly the causes are needed here to bring awareness.”\n\nQ: For people who can’t adopt (dogs/cats), how else can they get involved in helping the rescues?\n\nJT: “Just to go to the place, to the shelter near you, just to walk a dog. My wife was really into dogs before I met her. She brought to my attention the need. We were in a lockout or strike, so we went to our local shelter and walked dogs all day. There are so many different avenues that people can help with. You don’t want to force people to adopt a dog because it usually returns. If someone honestly doesn’t want a dog or cat, it usually comes back to the shelter.\n\nFlyers head coach John Tortarella meets with the media.\n\nYou can make donations for food. The neatest one is to carve out an hour in a day of your busy week or maybe a few days a week just to let these dogs out to get them out of their cages and let them be dogs. Fostering is a huge part of helping these animals. It allows them to see what home life is and lets them have the personality they have instead of being cooped up in the kennel. It’s not always money. They’re all (rescues) looking for money but just caring. If you care, you’ll find ways to help.”\n\nQ: How many pets do you have?\n\nJT: “We have five rescue dogs and three rescue horses.”\n\nQ: Horses? How did that come about?\n\nJT: “We started in Columbus about nine years ago. We didn’t have a clue what we were doing. With our foundation, we’re all through the country and have different shelters. We ran across this shelter to the south of us from where we lived and became friends with the family. There were a couple of horses that were left for dead in the field. They were starved to death. We had a five-acre farm. They nursed the horses back to where they could stand; they couldn’t even stand. They asked if we could bring them over and let them graze on your grass.”\n\nQ: Were the horses first or the dogs?\n\nJT: “The dogs came first. My wife is passionate about it. It’s her life. She didn’t know what she was getting into. She follows me around with all the jobs I’ve had in hockey, and if it isn’t hockey, it’s rescuing animals. It’s a huge part of our life right now. We loved doing it and met so many great people doing it. It’s so needed. It’s such an emotional rollercoaster when you try to help these animals. You can bring awareness to my platform. The greatest thing about my job is that it’s a platform. It’s not me. It’s just my platform to talk about this. We need help. These animals need help. We’re in all the way and want to help in any way possible.”\n\nAs you can see, John Tortorella is passionate about protecting animals.

        "content": "Sign up for our email newsletter to stay up-to-date on the latest local sports news throughout Philadelphia.\n\nA lot will change between now and the NFL Draft, but the type of players and athletes that the Philadelphia Eagles draft does not. They show the league the type of players they look for every year and have been consistent over the last four drafts in staying true to their board and style.\n\nThis is my first all-Eagles, no trades, 2025 NFL mock draft for Philly Sports Network of the draft SzN.\n\nEagles Mock Draft 1.0\n\nRound One Pick 32- T.J. Sanders, Defensive Tackle, South Carolina\n\nSanders has elite length and eliminates passing lanes with his height and reach. He utilizes a quick burst off the line and is disruptive, causing havoc in the backfield. T.J. provides an interior pass rush (8.5 sacks last 2 seasons), sheds blocks well, is a solid tackler, has gaudy TFL totals (17 in 23/24), and is a toolsy player with high upside. He had a 21.2% pass-rush win rate and an 11.3% run-stop rate in college and is a versatile piece that could be truly explosive in this defensive front.\n\nWhen looking for a true 3-down DT, TJ Sanders checks all the boxes pic.twitter.com/TkfG7pKJvS — Brad (@Graham_SFN) February 11, 2025\n\nRound Two Pick 64- Josaiah Stewart, Edge Rusher, Michigan\n\nStewart has excellent speed, agility, an elite first step, and a plethora of pass-rush moves; swim, chop, etc. He has shown adequate bend getting around the edge, has a high motor to keep pressure on opposing quarterbacks, and has active, violent hands to thwart offensive linemen in his way. He processes offenses quickly. Josaiah can win with outside or inside pass rush moves and has a 16% pressure rate and a 17% run-stop rate tied for best-in-class. The Eagles prefer athletic edge rushers, and while some may think he is small for the position, he could be a perfect fit in Philadelphia.\n\nSep 16, 2024; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA; Philadelphia Eagles defensive end Bryce Huff (0) tackles Atlanta Falcons running back Bijan Robinson (7) after a catch during the second quarter at Lincoln Financial Field.

He exudes body control, is an above-average route runner, creates YAC, breaks tackles, and loves learning. Helm has some of the best hands in class and rarely drops a pass. He is also a film rat who desires to continually improve. He can thrive in the 12 P scheme and always finds a soft spot in coverage. Gunnar uses his body well to shield defenders and excels in space. He is the best run blocker in class!\n\nRound Four Pick 128 Jeffrey Bassa, Linebacker, Oregon\n\nJeffrey was the QB of the defense for Oregon, calling plays for three years. He is an above-average cover LB, using his former skills from being a saftey. Bassa has elite instincts, reads routes with speed, is twitchy, can blitz, and has elite closing speed and footwork. Jeffrey has also been a Gunner on special teams. This year, he was a Senior Bowl show-off! I love fit with the Eagles.\n\nRound Five Pick 162 Hollin Pierce, Offensive Tackle, Rutgers\n\nPierce has the size, height, anchor, and hands the Eagles love to develop. At 6’8 340, he is a roadblock, a mauler, and a vicious finisher. Hollin keeps pockets clean and blows up double teams. He measured the 3rd longest arms and 4th widest wingspan. Pierce is a tough, hard worker and a riser in this draft class at the position! Jeff Stoutland could take Hollin from a relative unknown to All-Pro by the time Lane is ready to hang the cleats up.\n\nFeb 9, 2025; New Orleans, LA, USA; Philadelphia Eagles offensive tackle Jordan Mailata (68) celebrates with Philadelphia Eagles offensive tackle Mekhi Becton (77) after winning Super Bowl LIX at Caesars Superdome.

Williams has shown his elite ball skills with seven interceptions this season at Cal. He is fluid and quick, recognizes routes with ease, and reacts instantly. Nohl also defends the run and tackles well. He is a physical corner too. Williams goes after the ball as if it was thrown to him when it is in the air. He should have a great showing at the combine in Indianapolis and has a chance to improve his stock. He has the talent to be a top-100 player. Adding another ball-hawking, aggressive, athletic, cost-effective corner to coach is desirable with the uncertainty of Slay and others possibly leaving Philly.\n\nRound Five Pick 169- Jalen McLeod, Edge OLB, Auburn\n\nMcLeod has a high motor and a knack for getting to the ball. He frustrates opposing defenses with physicality, think Chauncey Gardner-Johnson. He is versatile and play OLB or put his hand in the dirt as an Edge. Jalen is a menace on the field utilizing his speed, leverage, and eye awareness. He chases down ball carriers as if they stole from him, Playmaker! And why wouldn’t the Eagles want another Jalen on the squad? It has worked out well so far.\n\nBeen a fan of Auburn EDGE/LB Jalen McLeod since his App State days and he's got a great motor and cross chop to win against tackles.

From Artistic Director John Jarboe and co-writer MK Tuomanen, Beards on Ice tackles the difficult tasks of solving the climate crisis and teaching drag queens how to ice skate.\n\nThe hour-long spectacle will come in two exciting varieties: A family-friendly afternoon romp for kids and kids-at-heart titled Family Meltdown, and Beards on Ice: Still Edging, a PG-13, late-night cabaret that’s appropriately titled as it has a bit more edge. The shows will take place between two locations, Tarken Ice Rink (6250 Frontenac St.) on March 15-16 and Laura Sims Skate House (210 Cobbs Creek Pkwy) on March 22-23. Each night, the family-friendly performance will be held at 4:30 p.m., and the PG-13 performance will be held at 8 p.m.\n\n“It feels so good to have some joy and absurdity brought into the climate change conversation, while speaking to the seriousness of the issue,” Jarboe said. “At the end of the performance, we want people to be more involved in the day-to-day climate justice work that’s happening in Philadelphia. It can be hard in a city landscape where everyone is dealing with a lot — how do you help people get rid of the armor they build throughout the day and listen? You show them a beautiful costume, you sing them an amazing song, you make them laugh while acknowledging the radical crisis that we’re in and the great opportunity we have as a species to come together.”\n\nAdvance tickets by donation ($0-$40) can be purchased online and there will also be suggested donation tickets available at the door of both show locations. Those in attendance, whether at Tarken Ice Rink or Laura Sims Skate House, will also enjoy a free skate rental and an hour-long skating session after the performance, hot chocolate, and resources from Philly’s climate justice organizations, including Physicians for Social Responsibility PA.\n\nFor more information on Beards on Ice or on The Bearded Ladies Cabaret themselves, visit beardedladiescabaret.com",

The gang’s motto: “If you want to join the Senders, get a body, then you gang with us,” according to Assistant DA Adam Faraye. ‘Getting a body’ refers to the act of killing someone.\n\n“The Senders are not quite gone, but they’re close,” DA Larry Krasner said at Friday’s news conference. “They’re very close.”\n\nMost of the violence occurred between 5th and 9th streets from Snyder to Oregon avenues; however, incidents connected to the Senders, and their feuds with other groups, were reported as far away as Lawncrest and Germantown.\n\nTaahir Rowe, 20, is facing murder charges for the January 2022 ambush shooting of 16-year-old Mehki Ingram on the 800 block of June Street in West Philadelphia’s Mill Creek neighborhood. Ingram died after several days in the hospital.\n\nOne of the other suspects, 19-year-old Eli Simmons, is being accused of participating in 10 shootings that left 16 people injured over the span of about 16 months in 2022 and 2023. Faraye said Simmons was being detained on $12.5 million bail.\n\nProsecutors said that, as part of the gang feud, three gunmen opened fire in February 2023 on a group of teenagers gathered on the 3100 block of Norris Street in Strawberry Mansion. The gunfire struck a mother and her 2-year-old daughter as they crossed the street, and five teens were injured.\n\nOther outbursts involving the Senders included three separate South Philadelphia triple shootings in January 2022 on the 700 block of Ritner Street; in April 2023 at 22nd and Wolf streets; and in May 2023 on the 600 block of Oregon Avenue, authorities said.\n\nElante Outerbridge, 17, is charged with nine counts of attempted murder in relation to the seven-victim incident and a shooting several months earlier in Southwest Philadelphia, according to the DA’s Office.\n\nHe is among the youngest defendants included in the bust, having been just 15 years old at the time of the two shootings. Most of the suspects were under 18 at the height of the gang warfare.\n\n“A lot of these young kids think it’s a game,” said PPD Detective Kelley Gallagher, who worked on the case. “On social media, they compare it to a basketball game. And how that works is, for every shooting victim, they say they have a point.”",

Mandatory Credit: Nathan Ray Seebeck-Imagn Images\n\nSign up for our email newsletter to stay up-to-date on the latest local sports news throughout Philadelphia.\n\nSpring Training is upon us, and the Philadelphia Phillies have returned to action.\n\nThe players are in Clearwater, Florida, preparing to defend their first National League East title since 2011. After an early exit against their rivals, the New York Mets, fans have begun to question the current status of the Phillies roster. From the bullpen to the lineup, the Phillies fanbase has let their voices be heard.\n\nRegarding the infield, each starter finds themselves associated with a growing opinion. As question marks bubble, I break down the biggest question for each member of the club’s starting infield.\n\nPhillies Infield\n\nCan JT Realmuto return to offensive excellence?\n\nCatcher J.T. Realmuto deserves all the credit in the world.\n\nSince joining the Phillies in 2019, Realmuto has caught more innings than any other catcher in the big leagues. This past season, J.T.’s stats were much better following the All-Star break (.272/.337/.451/.788 with 7 HR and 27 RBI) than prior to (.261/.309/.411/.720 with 7 HR and 20 RBI).\n\nDespite the production, his offensive numbers weren’t up to the standard that the Phillies needed. He finished 2024 with a .266/.322/.429/.751 line with 14 home runs and only 47 RBI. The only statistic that JT Realmuto was in the top 10 amongst catchers with as many or more at-bats is his batting average, where he ranked 8th.\n\nThe big question for Realmuto in 2024 is if he can get the bat going once again. He is an integral part of the Phillies’ roster, and they’re going to need him to get it going again on offense if they want to make noise this postseason.\n\nCan Bryce Harper stay on the field?\n\nBryce Harper is not a player you need to question in any aspect. He has earned the trust of everyone in the entire league; however, he has had to battle some injuries during his time with the Phillies.\n\nLast year he played in 145 of the 162 games, the second most since he joined the Phillies (excluding the 2020 year when he played 58 out of the 60 games). The Phillies need him to stay healthy to win it all, and with a full offseason without rehabbing a serious injury, I think fans can expect him to be there for at least 145 this season.\n\nIf Harper can maintain his health, he should return to MVP form in 2025.\n\nSep 25, 2024; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA; Philadelphia Phillies second baseman Bryson Stott (5) throws to first against the Chicago Cubs in the ninth inning at Citizens Bank Park. Mandatory Credit: Kyle Ross-Imagn Images\n\nBryson Stott—2023 or 2024?\n\nSecond baseman Bryson Stott started his sophomore season with a 17-game hit streak in 2023. He was one of the most consistent and clutch players on the Phillies that year. During his third season, Stott reportedly dealt with a lingering elbow issue that began in June. He would deal with the injury for the remainder of the season. His best month in 2024 was in July, where he hit .292/.340/.604/.944 with 10 HR and 23 RBI.\n\nThis season might be make or break for Bryson Stott. With the rise of top prospect Aidan Miller, Stott will need to shine once again in 2025. The question of his offensive ability will remain until Bryson is able to hit consistently. Will this season be a repeat of 2023 or 2024?\n\nWill Trea Turner find consistency?\n\nShortstop Trea Turner has had an up-and-down start to his Phillies tenure.\n\nThe standing ovation in 2023 has been well documented to this point. Turner’s struggles got him off on the wrong foot in his Phillies tenure, but he turned things around last season. His second year saw improvement, but he struggled in September and October.\n\nNot only has Trea been a roller coaster offensively, but defensively as well. His first two seasons with Philadelphia were the most error-filled seasons of his career, committing 23 and 17 errors, respectively. Turner is one of the many big names on the roster that the Phillies are relying on to get them over the hump, and the consistency needs to be there for them to accomplish their goal.\n\nCan Trea Turner be consistent on both sides of the ball? 2025 might unlock the answer to this question.\n\nFeb 19, 2025; Clearwater, FL, USA; Philadelphia Phillies shortstop Trea Turner (7) signs autographs for fans during spring training workouts at BayCare Ballpark. Mandatory Credit: Nathan Ray Seebeck-Imagn Images\n\nCan Alec Bohm dial in?\n\nThird baseman Alec Bohm had the best first half of his career in 2024.\n\nBohm parlayed that hitting dominance by earning his first All-Star nod. Following the All-Star break, he suffered a hand injury and could not regain the same hitting prowess that he showcased in the first half of the year.\n\nAt the break, Bohm was hitting .295/.348/.482/.830 with 11 HR and 70 RBI. It felt like he was guaranteed to get a hit with a runner on base. After the break, he hit .251/.299/.382/.681 with four HR and 27 RBI. He struggled mightily and could not find ways to get on base.\n\nBohm dominated the Phillies talk this offseason. He was included in several trade rumors this offseason, despite assurances by Rob Thomson and Dave Dombrowski that the club had no interest in moving him.\n\nAlec is a mentally driven player. What I mean by that is if everything is good, he is capable of ripping doubles into the left field gap every single night. On the flip side, if something isn’t going right, he starts to struggle.\n\nThe question will be if Alec Bohm can figure out how to control the emotional side of baseball. If Alec can dial in this season, 2024 might just be the stepping stone to greatness that the Phillies were hoping for.\n\nMandatory Credit: Nathan Ray Seebeck-Imagn Images",

        "content": "Sign up for our email newsletter to stay up-to-date on the latest local sports news throughout Philadelphia.\n\nA new era of Philadelphia Union soccer is here, and life under Bradley Carnell is off to a positive start. Despite conceding an early goal on the road, a big second-half performance pushes Union to a 4-2 win and 3 points on the opening weekend of the 2025 MLS season.\n\nImage Credit: Philadelphia Union\n\nStarting XI\n\nCarnell’s first starting lineup as the Head Coach of the Philadelphia Union had a few wrinkles, other than moving from the 4-4-2 Diamond that was favored under Jim Curtin to a 4-2-2-2.\n\nAndre Blake was back between the posts for his 300th career appearance for the Philadelphia Union on Saturday night after missing much of the 2024 season. In front of him, a makeshift backline made up of 2 first-team debutants, Frankie Westfield and Olwethu Makhanya, partnered by two veterans in Jakob Glesnes and Kai Wagner.\n\nJovan Lukić, another debutant who made some positive first impressions after a rocky start, took a spot in the double pivot next to Danley Jean-Jacques, who kicks off his first full season with the Union in 2025. Much more familiar to the fans of the Blue and Gold, Daniel Gazdag and Quinn Sullivan took position as the two attacking midfielders, with Tai Baribo and Mikael Uhre putting the pressure up top.\n\n“I’m not sure too many teams come to Orlando and feel comfortable and confident, especially with a new group, a new coach coming into town…and then you have some new guys on the field. We have [Danley] Jean-Jacques, we have [Jovan] Lukić – who did a great job, the double 6’s there, they did a really great job – and then you have Frankie, Olwethu, so I mean yeah, to come to this place and respond against a bit of adversity, to show the courage and the character and resilience that we’ve been building up over 5 weeks now, I’m really proud of the boys” – Philadelphia Union Head Coach, Bradley Carnell\n\nImage Credit: Philadelphia Union\n\nAn Early Orlando Lead\n\nJust 8 minutes in and on his league debut, Marco Pašalić opened his MLS account after Orlando City seamlessly connected a number of passes around Union debutants Jovan Lukić and Olwethu Makhanya and moseyed their way into the penalty area, kicking off the Bradley Carnell era on a bad foot.\n\nImage Credit: Philadelphia Union\n\nBaribo Brings Union Level\n\nAfter pressure from Quinn Sullivan forced Orlando into a turnover inside their own half in the 23rd minute, Union worked their way into the final 3rd and created some chaos around the penalty area. A mis-hit by Quinn Sullivan sent the ball out to Pedro Gallese’s right and into the path of Kai Wagner, who sent a low, fizzing cross through the 6-yard box where Tai Baribo was waiting to tap the ball in and level the game at 1.\n\nThe first goal of the Bradley Carnell era came from the exact type of soccer we’ve been told we’re going to see this season. High, relentless pressure when the other team is in possession, and then quick and direct passes that lead to goals in transition once turning the other team over. Despite going down early, Carnell stuck to his game plan, and the team was rewarded once they found their footing.\n\nImage Credit: Philadelphia Union\n\nGazdag Gives Union the Lead\n\nNow on level terms and with a pep-talk from the new manager at the break, Union came out of the second half absolutely flying. In the 48th minute, with the ball along the left sideline, Quinn Sullivan lofted a picturesque pass that curled to the far post and fell perfectly into the path of an outstretched Daniel Gazdag’s right foot.\n\nGazdag, getting the perfect touch on the ball from Sullivan, neatly re-directed the ball passed Gallese’s near-post and into the back of the net, giving Union their first lead of the Bradley Carnell era. Quinn Sullivan, who played a big role in creating the first goal, gets credited with an assist on the goal by Gazdag. A great start to the 2025 season for Quinn.\n\nImage Credit: Philadelphia Union\n\nUhre Extends Union’s Lead\n\nWhen playing it out of the back goes wrong! Just 3 minutes after Gazdag’s goal, Orlando City’s Rodrigo Schlegel mishandled a back-pass that sat perfectly for a pressing Mikael Uhre.\n\nUhre stepped onto the ball and hit it with his first touch at the top of the penalty arch, beating Gallese and jumping Union out to a 3-1 lead early in the 2nd half.\n\nImage Credit: Philadelphia Union\n\nBaribo Brace Seals First Win of Bradley Carnell Era\n\nIn the 64th minute and with a 3-1 lead, 19-year-old Frankie Westfield received the ball along the right side of the pitch and darted forward with conviction. After collecting a failed first attempt at a cross into the box, Westfield, with his right foot, sent a second ball through the penalty area, which was put in the back of the net by the first-touch of Tai Baribo, his 2nd goal of the game, and his 18th goal in his previous 23 games across all competitions for Union.\n\nThe assist was the first of Westfield’s MLS career and comes as the “cherry on top” of his MLS debut. Still just 19 and able to play either outside back position, Frankie Westfield looks set to log some minutes behind Kai Wagner and Nate Harriel this season and should now bring some extra confidence to the pitch whenever he’s called upon next.\n\nImage Credit: Philadelphia Union\n\nPašalić Puts In Consolation Goal\n\nIn the 79th minute and down 4-1, Orlando City’s Marco Pašalić notched his 2nd goal of the night and his MLS career after a couple of shot attempts rang the post and Union failed to clear the area. The goal didn’t mean anything for the result at the end of the day, but veteran Keeper Andre Blake surely wasn’t happy with young defender Olwethu Makhanya’s positioning and spectatorship on the play and gave him a bit of an earful, which I’m sure is a bit easier for Makhanya to swallow after a 4-2 win.\n\nImage Credit: Philadelphia Union\n\nQuotes from Carnell\n\nAfter the opening goal from Orlando inside the first 10 minutes, a lot of Union fans were probably having that “here we go again” feeling. But Bradley Carnell’s team stuck to the game plan, got themselves level, made a few tweaks at half-time, and absolutely shell-shocked Orlando in the final 45 minutes of the game.\n\n“For them to come out and be challenged here in this game was kind of a microcosm of the whole pre-season. We go a goal down, and then we’re chasing a little bit, we lose our structure, and then coming out of the 2nd half after correcting one or two things and then all of a sudden you can change the picture in a million ways and we did do that in transition, we really did exactly what we wanted to do from the beginning of the game.” – Philadelphia Union Head Coach, Bradley Carnell\n\nLet’s be honest here. I’m not sure anyone, maybe even Bradley Carnell, could have predicted a 4-1 win on the road in the opening game of the season. It’s a great start to a new era of Union soccer, and while Carnell knows they need to continue growing and getting better, he’s seeing lots of things to like about his team, and he’s happy to see them rewarded on Saturday night.\n\n“We left that Montreal [pre-season] game last week feeling very confident and very happy the way the pre-season ended. So I’m excited they could put it on display tonight, but I’m more just happy for the group. I’ve asked a lot of them, they’ve committed to me, we’ve had some great energy, we’ve done a lot of things off the field and reestablished some foundational standings within our group now, and I think you could see that togetherness today.” – Bradley Carnell\n\nImage Credit: Philadelphia Union\n\nMatch Highlights\n\nBe sure to return to Philly Sports Network for more Philadelphia Union and other soccer content!\n\nFollow our Union team on Twitter:\n\nTim Lovenguth | Jimmy King | Paul Frenzel\n\nNate Tennesen | Eric Frysinger\n\nSteve Beavon | Liam Jenkins\n\nDoop on Union fans!\n\nFeatured Image Credit: Philadelphia Union",

In ‘Old Guy‘, Christoph Waltz’s Danny Dolinski has to deal with the fact that he’s being pushed out of his longtime career, and at the same time, has to train his replacement (Cooper Hoffman.)\n\nThis action-comedy from director Simon West (‘Con Air’) explores Dolinski’s trouble relinquishing his position to a “Gen Z”, and along with West and Hoffman, Lucy Liu also joins the cast as Danny’s old friend turned confidant turned perhaps a little something more.\n\nTo chat more about this feature and what went into crafting it, both Simon West and Lucy Liu sat down to discuss ‘Old Guy.’\n\nWhy sign on with this project? What elements of it were you excited to tackle?\n\nWest: Well, you always want to get a script that you just can’t stop reading, and it’s a page-turner. A very good test is: Do you fall asleep when you’re reading it or do you want to turn the next page? And this luckily was one of those latter ones. You look for the highlights… where are the humor scenes, where are the dramatic scenes? And if there are enough of those highlights that keep you interested in the reading, then you get excited about shooting them. So I look forward to those key scenes that I read about a year before I actually shoot them, but it’s kind of nerve-wracking.\n\nWill I get them on film as good as they are in my head? And sometimes, hopefully, most of the time you get it right and you do get them as good as they are on the page or as good as you imagined. But at the end of the day, I’m in the hands of the actors, so they have to deliver and I can just encourage them and create a world that they can do their best work. And also casting the right people like Lucy, Christoph and Cooper… you have to cast the right people so that they’re capable of doing all that.\n\nLiu: I love that it reminded me of a movie that was before the internet, when it wasn’t complicated. It was just about their relationships, their connections, and less about special effects or aliens coming from another planet, which by the way, I do love. But it seems so compact and concise with where the directions of the characters were going emotionally. And I think it’s a very short movie. So the fact that it moves quickly and that it hits all the different levels in that very short period of time in a very authentic way was exciting to me.\n\nWith a film like this, where a lot of the plot comes from the characters and their relationships, thinking of you, Lucy, along with Chrisoph and Cooper—how do you make sure that chemistry is there?\n\nLiu: That’s just something that you have to figure out when you get there…that’s not something that’s natural. You hope that it is when you read the script and you have this idea of what you hope it will be. And it was more than that even so when I got on the set with Christoph, and Cooper is just a lovely human being and somebody who’s enthusiastic and willing to try anything.\n\nI mean, Christoph and I had to have that chemistry in order to really make it believable that she would transition from being rejected from this Prince Charming to then suddenly having some affection towards her old friend. And luckily, it was something that came about because of the chemistry that we had together.\n\nSimon, from a director’s standpoint, this film is almost equal parts action and comedy. How do you blend those genres together to make it cohesive?\n\nWest: Well, it’s sort of two different sides to your brain, and so one day you’re doing a dramatic scene and I use one side of my brain, and then the next day I’m doing a technical action scene, which is using the other side of my brain. But really when I do action, it’s just making a little short film in itself. So it has to have a beginning, a middle and end. It’s just a little bit more visual and hopefully still character-driven, but it’s not relying on dialogue so much in an action sequence.\n\nSo they’re just two slightly different parts of your brain, but being told by the same person and they still have to work in the same way. You still have to bring the audience along with you…they still have to want to be with those characters in the traumatic scene, and they want to find out what happens in this action scene without just being bombarded. So it’s just that it becomes a reflex after you’ve done it a few times.\n\nIn a world full of action films, what stands out to you about ‘Old Guy’?\n\nLiu: For me, I think it’s about being relevant and when you feel like you still are relevant [but] then the world is telling you that you’re done. That is something that Christoph mentioned in other interviews as well, that you’re not quite accepting the fact that that’s happening—you’re being pushed out and it’s not a great feeling. It’s hurtful.\n\nAt the same time, there’s a reality to what happens as we are mortal people, and how can you stay in the game when everyone else is telling you that you’re washed up? That’s the journey that he’s taking. So it’s brave and it’s, as Simon said before, it’s also a very unusual job. So you can apply that to banking, you can apply that to anything. And in this case, he’s a hit man and he can’t hit the mark he used to.\n\nCatch ‘Old Guy‘ in select theaters and on Digital now.",

Key federal agencies from the FBI and State Department to the Pentagon instructed their employees not to comply.\n\nRELATED: Elon Musk email to federal employees met with resistance\n\nFederal employees fired\n\nThe backstory:\n\nLayoffs and firings have affected many federal departments in recent weeks.\n\nSince Donald Trump took office in January, one of his top priorities has been cutting and reorganizing spending within the federal government.\n\nThe president has tapped billionaire businessman Elon Musk to lead the so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), which has been tasked with finding and prioritizing what to cut. Thousands of federal government employees have been laid off or fired in the process.\n\nBy the numbers:\n\nThe federal government consists of about 2.4 million civilians. 20% of them live in the Washington, D.C. region.\n\nThere is no official figure available for the total firings or layoffs, but The Associated Press has confirmed, or learned via sources, and reported the following number of firings in these departments:\n\nAgriculture Department: Layoffs of about 2,000 \"probationary, non-firefighting employees\" were expected\n\nDefense Department: 5,400 probationary workers\n\nDepartment of Health and Human Services: About 700 probationary employees with the CDC, and others at other agencies\n\nDepartment of Homeland Security: 405 probationary staffers\n\nDepartment of Veterans Affairs: 1,000 employees serving for less than two years\n\nEducation Department: At least 39 people\n\nEnergy Department: As many as 350 employees\n\nInspectors general: At least 17\n\nInternal Revenue Service: Cuts are expected soon for thousands of probationary workers, according to sources\n\nJustice Department: More than a dozen career employees\n\nNational Park Service: About 1,000 newly-hired employees\n\nThe other side:\n\nAccording to the agency’s website, as of Feb. 17, 2025, DOGE estimates its savings around $55 billion. The agency attributes this to \"a combination of fraud detection/deletion, contract/lease cancelations, contract/lease renegotiations, asset sales, grant cancelations, workforce reductions, programmatic changes, and regulatory savings.\"",

It’s an unusual arrangement that raises questions about a bureau that’s long been a target of conservatives.\n\n\n\nKash Patel, who was sworn in as FBI director last week, is expected to be named the acting head of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, a Justice Department official told The Associated Press.\n\nIf he’s sworn in as head of the ATF next week as expected, that would put Patel in charge of two of the Justice Department's largest agencies. It’s an unusual arrangement that raises questions about the future of the bureau that’s long been criticized by conservatives.\n\nAs FBI director, Patel is at the top of America’s premier federal law enforcement agency despite concerns from Democrats over his qualifications and the prospect that he will do President Donald Trump's bidding. He was confirmed by the Senate in a 51-49 vote – GOP Sens. Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski voted against him.\n\nRELATED: Elon Musk says federal employees must email ‘what they got done last week’\n\nWhat is the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives?\n\nThe backstory:\n\nATF is a separate agency with about 5,500 employees and is responsible for enforcing the nation's laws around firearms, explosives and arson. Among other things, it's in charge of licensing federal firearms dealers, tracing guns used in crimes and analyzing intelligence in shooting investigations.\n\nU.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi swears in the new Federal Bureau of Investigation Director Kash Patel as his girlfriend Alexis Wilkins holds the Bhagavad Gita in the Indian Treaty Room in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building on February 21, 2025 Expand\n\nThe last confirmed ATF director was Steve Dettelbach, a former federal prosecutor, who led the agency from July 2022 until last month. He was the first confirmed director since 2015 as both Republican and Democratic administrations failed to get nominees through the politically fraught process.\n\nWhat they're saying:\n\nConservatives have long railed against ATF over its role in regulating firearms and have suggested shuttering the agency. Under the Biden administration, the ATF advanced new regulations aimed at cracking down on ghost guns and requiring thousands more firearms dealers to run background checks on buyers at gun shows or other places outside brick-and-mortar stores.\n\nRELATED: Trump fires Joint Chiefs of Staff chairman Gen. CQ Brown Jr.\n\nGun Owners of America, a gun rights group, called his confirmation as FBI director \"a major victory for gun owners and constitutional rights advocates nationwide.\"\n\nIn an executive order earlier this month, Trump directed the attorney general to review all actions taken by the Biden administration around firearms \"to assess any ongoing infringements of the Second Amendment rights of our citizens.\"\n\nRELATED: Here's how US gun ownership has evolved over the past decade, new Gallup poll shows\n\nAfter the directive, Attorney General Pam Bondi fired the ATF's top lawyer. Bondi said in a Fox News interview Friday that she fired chief counsel Pamela Hicks because the agency was \"targeting gun owners.\"\n\nWhy are there concerns about Patel leading the ATF?\n\nThe other side:\n\nGun safety groups have raised alarm about putting Patel in charge of the FBI, with gun control group Brady calling him a \"known gun rights extremist.\"",

        "source": "https://www.fox29.com/",
        "content": "article\n\nThe Brief The Trump administration is eliminating at least 1,600 USAID positions and placing most remaining staff on leave. A federal judge ruled in favor of the administration’s plan, rejecting employee lawsuits to block the cuts. Workers abroad will keep access to agency systems and emergency communication tools, but many are stranded without clear guidance. A separate judge has temporarily stopped the administration from withholding foreign aid, ordering some funding to be restored.\n\n\n\nThe Trump administration moved its fast-paced dismantling of the U.S. Agency for International Development toward what appeared to be its final phases, telling all but a fraction of staffers worldwide that they were on leave as of Monday and notifying at least 1,600 of the U.S.-based staffers they were being fired.\n\nThe move was the latest and one of the biggest steps in what President Donald Trump and cost-cutting ally Elon Musk say is their goal of gutting the six-decade-old aid and development agency in a broader campaign to slash the size of the federal government.\n\nMore federal layoffs\n\nThe backstory:\n\nIt comes after a federal judge on Friday allowed the administration to move forward with pulling thousands of USAID staffers off the job in the United States and around the world. U.S. District Judge Carl Nichols rejected pleas that came in a lawsuit from employees to keep temporarily blocking the government’s plan.\n\n\"As of 11:59 p.m. EST on Sunday, February 23, 2025, all USAID direct hire personnel, with the exception of designated personnel responsible for mission-critical functions, core leadership and/or specially designated programs, will be placed on administrative leave globally,\" according to the notices sent to USAID workers and viewed by The Associated Press.\n\nCiting a big concern for workers stationed overseas who have reported being cut off from government communications, the notices say that \"USAID is committed to keeping its overseas personnel safe. Until they return home, personnel will retain access to Agency systems and to diplomatic and other resources.\"\n\nRelated article\n\nThe administration said employees put on leave overseas are expected to receive \"voluntary Agency-funded return travel\" and other benefits.\n\nNichols, who was nominated by Trump, said he had been \"very concerned\" about workers in high-risk areas left overseas without access to emergency communications. But he said he has since been reassured by the administration that workers would still have access to two-way radios that allow 24–7 communications in emergencies, as well as a phone app with a \"panic button.\"\n\nThe judge said the government’s statements persuaded him \"that the risk posed to USAID employees who are placed on administrative leave while stationed abroad — if there is any — is far more minimal than it initially appeared.\"\n\nBig picture view:\n\nThe notices of firings and leaves come on top of hundreds of USAID contractors receiving no-name form letters of termination over the weekend, according to copies that AP viewed.\n\nThe blanket nature of the notification letters to USAID contractors, excluding the names or positions of those receiving it, could make it difficult for the dismissed workers to get unemployment benefits, workers noted.\n\nA different judge in a second lawsuit tied to the dismantling of USAID has temporarily blocked the freeze on foreign assistance and said this past week that the administration had kept withholding the aid despite his court order and must at least temporarily restore the funding to programs worldwide.\n\nUSAID’s notice Sunday said it was \"committed to keeping its overseas personnel safe\" and pledged not to cut off USAID staffers abroad from agency systems and other support.\n\nWhat is USAID?\n\nDig deeper:\n\nUSAID offers assistance to countries recovering from disasters, trying to escape poverty, and engaging in democratic reforms, including war-torn Gaza and West Africa also recovering from years of vicious wars. The U.S. is by far the world’s largest donor of humanitarian aid, with USAID administering billions of dollars in humanitarian, development and security assistance in more than 100 countries.\n\nPresident John F. Kennedy created the organization at the height of the Cold War to counter Soviet influence. Congress passed the Foreign Assistance Act in 1961, and Kennedy signed that law and an executive order establishing USAID as an independent agency.\n\nThe U.S. spends less than 1% of its budget on foreign assistance, a smaller share overall than some other nations.",

They manage logistics, permits, language barriers, and charter flights along a customized route to ensure the challenge can be completed on time.\n\nThe runners are then able to focus on the physical demands.\n\nEdell and the rest of the runners started their journey at orientation in Cape Town, South Africa. Then it was off to Antarctica for the first race.\n\n\"We hopped a Russian military plane to Antarctica,\" Edell said. \"When the doors opened I remember the announcer saying you are required to wear sunglasses because the sun is so bright, especially when it is reflecting off of the snow that you can actually burn your retinas if you stay out too long.\"\n\nThe temperature was 11 degrees, but with the wind chill, it was -7.\n\nDespite the deadly conditions, they completed the first marathon.\n\nAccording to Edell, the hardest part of the entire race, was the recovery.\n\n\"It really is more of a psychological game at a certain point where you're almost in a grappling match with your own head, trying to prove how capable you are,\" Edell said.\n\nFor the second marathon, they returned to Cape Town, then to Perth, Australia, Dubai, Madrid, Spain and the Fortaleza, Brazil for marathon six, the race that almost broke Edell.\n\n\"It was 85 degrees, oppressive humidity, the sixth marathon, I had severe chaffing from sweating through my clothes it was brutal,\" Edell said.\n\nThe final marathon was in Miami.\n\nAccording to Edell, the hardest part of the week was the lack of recovery.\n\n\"After the second marathon, you realize I still have about four marathons to do, your body is wiped out,\" Edell said. \"You’re going through temperature changes, you’re juggling nutrition and you have jetlag.\"\n\nIn an effort to avoid food poisoning, the runners turned to fast food.\n\nThroughout the week, they relied on a diet of Chicken McNuggets and Gatorade.\n\nEdell told KTVU he would consider doing the challenge again, but said he would never forget what he learned throughout the week but also the year-long training process.\n\n\"You realize that your human body and mind have so much more potential than what your head is telling you,\" Edell said.\n\nThe Source Interview with Chris Edell\n\n\n\n",

Action Karate will host a free women’s self-defense and kickboxing class on Saturday, March 15.\n\n\n\nIt’s not unusual for Stephan Venter to perform a strong kick when instructing at Action Karate in Northern Liberties.\n\nHowever, on Thursday, it proved to be successful outside the gym.\n\nWhat we know:\n\nSurveillance cameras captured Action Karate instructor Stephan Venter running out of the building at 3rd and Poplar Streets, after a parent and student waiting for an upcoming class informed him that a woman needed help outside.\n\nShe was yelling that her purse was stolen.\n\n\"I’m just screaming bloody murder like a complete lunatic, like stop him, stop him, stop him, help, help, help to anybody around,\" said Jennifer Romanelli.\n\nRomanelli says she was inside Parkview Dry Cleaners getting her suit altered when a man, who entered the store and was asked to leave repeatedly, suddenly snatched her purse. She says the owner, Lita, took off running first, and she followed.\n\n\"I’m like, ‘I’m going to run and run and run, because I’m not letting this guy get my stuff, like I don’t care, I’m not going to give up.’\"\n\nVenter says he didn’t think twice.\n\n\"I shouted at him, ‘Drop the bag!’ He wouldn’t drop it, I caught up with him, I gave him a kick on the leg,\" he said. \"As I got him a kick on the leg, he dropped the bag, stumbled, and then he kept running away.\"\n\nRomanelli says Lita turned around and told her not only was the man stopped, but that her bag was safe.\n\n\"Literally out of nowhere, like an angel, this guy appears, like a ninja, and he’s like here you go,\" she said. \"I’m like, what the?Is this happening? So her and I are completely stunned.\"\n\nIronically, Stephan had to run back to teach a ninja class, he says. He went back to the cleaners later to make sure everyone was OK, and connected with Romanelli. She says she researched the gym and contacted Venter’s boss to explain his heroism. Venter, who was born and raised in South Africa, has been in Philadelphia for six months.\n\n\"He’s an amazing human,\" she said.\n\nVenter tells FOX 29 he would \"do it again in a heartbeat,\" though he points to 28 years of training and experience, and does not recommend anyone follow in his footsteps.\n\nWhat's next:\n\nThe incident inspired him and Action Karate to host a free women’s self-defense and kickboxing class on Saturday, March 15th at 2:00 p.m.\n\nSpots are limited and you can register by calling 267-225-6006.\n\nRomanelli says without question, she will be there.\n\n\"We can be cynical and the world is crazy and the fact that two humans who don’t know me helped me in need, just makes me have like such a different perspective on things, and just like, you know, have faith in humanity again.\"",

Elon Musk, who’s been tasked with slashing federal spending, said they must reply within 48 hours or risk losing their jobs. Key federal agencies from the FBI and State Department to the Pentagon have instructed their employees not to comply.\n\n\n\nElon Musk’s email to federal employees this weekend requesting \"what they got done\" last week at work has been met with resistance, from key federal agencies to lawmakers.\n\nHundreds of thousands of federal workers were given little more than 48 hours to comply or risk losing their job, sparking confusion.\n\nElon Musk email to federal employees\n\nFILE - Elon Musk, chief executive officer of Tesla Inc., during the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in National Harbor, Maryland, US, on Thursday, Feb. 20, 2025. Photographer: Will Oliver/ EPA / Bloomberg via Getty Images\n\nThe backstory:\n\nElon Musk tweeted on Saturday that all federal employees will be asked to report \"what they got done last week,\" and that failure to reply would be considered a resignation.\n\nShortly afterward, federal employees received a three-line email telling them to share \"approx. 5 bullets of what you accomplished last week and cc your manager.\"\n\nScreenshots of the email sent to FOX Television Stations by a federal employee who wished to remain anonymous. (Images: FTS)\n\nBig picture view:\n\nLayoffs and firings have affected many federal departments in recent weeks.\n\nSince Donald Trump took office in January, one of his top priorities has been cutting and reorganizing spending within the federal government.\n\nThe president has tapped billionaire businessman Elon Musk to lead the so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), which has been tasked with finding and prioritizing what to cut. Thousands of federal government employees have been laid off or fired in the process.\n\nDig deeper:\n\nMusk’s email came just hours after Trump encouraged him on social media to \"get more aggressive\" in reducing the size of the government.\n\nRELATED: Elon Musk says federal employees must email ‘what they got done last week’\n\nReaction to Elon Musk’s email\n\nWhat they're saying:\n\nDemocrats and some Republicans were critical of Musk's directive.\n\nKey federal agencies from the FBI and State Department to the Pentagon instructed their employees not to comply with the request.\n\nLabor unions have threatened lawsuits.\n\nPresident Trump and Musk both posted a meme mocking federal employees.\n\n\"Put a dose of compassion\"\n\n\"If I could say one thing to Elon Musk, it’s like, please put a dose of compassion in this,\" Sen. John Curtin, R-Utah. \"These are real people. These are real lives. These are mortgages. ... It's a false narrative to say we have to cut and you have to be cruel to do it as well.\"\n\nDemands OMP withdrawal\n\nRep. Gerry Connolly, D-VA, demanded Sunday that the Office of Personnel Management withdraw the email.\n\n\"This threat is illegal, reckless, and yet another example of the cruel and arbitrary chaos Mr. Musk is inflicting on the people’s government and its dedicated public servants. You must immediately clarify that federal employees’ nonresponse to this ill-conceived, weekend email does not constitute resignation,\" he wrote .\n\n\"Pause any responses\"\n\nNewly confirmed FBI Director Kash Patel , an outspoken Trump ally, instructed bureau employees to ignore Musk’s request, at least for now.\n\n\"The FBI, through the Office of the Director, is in charge of all of our review processes, and will conduct reviews in accordance with FBI procedures,\" Patel wrote in an email confirmed by The Associated Press. \"When and if further information is required, we will coordinate the responses. For now, please pause any responses.\"\n\nRELATED: FBI Director Kash Patel to take over ATF, reports say\n\n\"The Department will coordinate responses\"\n\nPentagon leadership instructed employees to \"pause\" any response to Musk's team as well.\n\n\"The Department of Defense is responsible for reviewing the performance of its personnel and it will conduct any review in accordance with its own procedures,\" according to an email from Jules Hurst, the deputy undersecretary of defense for personnel and readiness. \"When and if required, the Department will coordinate responses...\"\n\n\"Cruel and disrespectful\"\n\n\"It is cruel and disrespectful to hundreds of thousands of veterans who are wearing their second uniform in the civil service to be forced to justify their job duties to this out-of-touch, privileged, unelected billionaire who has never performed one single hour of honest public service in his life,\" AFGE President Everett Kelley said.\n\n\"AFGE will challenge any unlawful terminations of our members and federal employees across the country.\"\n\nThe other side:\n\nMusk and Trump appeared undeterred.\n\nThey both posted a meme on social media mocking federal employees. The Sunday post featured a cartoon character writing a list of accomplishments from the previous week led by, \"Cried about Trump,\" \"Cried about Elon,\" \"Made it into the office for once,\" and \"Read some emails.\"\n\nTrump posted it to his Truth Social site a few hours after Musk posted it on X .\n\nAccording to DOGE’s official website , as of Feb. 17, 2025, the agency estimates its savings around $55 billion. The agency attributes this to \"a combination of fraud detection/deletion, contract/lease cancelations, contract/lease renegotiations, asset sales, grant cancelations, workforce reductions, programmatic changes, and regulatory savings.\"\n\nWhat's next:\n\nThe deadline to reply was listed as Monday, Feb. 24, at 11:59 p.m., although the email did not include Musk's social media threat about those who fail to respond.\n\nIt’s unclear what the next steps will be this week once the deadline passes.\n\nUSAID workers fired\n\nMeanwhile:\n\nThe Trump administration said it is placing all but a fraction of staffers at the U.S. Agency for International Development on leave worldwide and eliminating at least 1,600 U.S.-based jobs.\n\nThe notices were sent to USAID workers and viewed Sunday by The Associated Press.\n\nBig picture view:\n\nThe move was the latest and one of the biggest steps yet toward what Trump and Musk say is their goal of gutting the 60-year-old aid agency as part of their broader goal of cutting the size of the federal government.",

A lyric change at the 4 Nations Face-Off hockey championship is the latest sign of rising tensions between the U.S. and its longtime ally.\n\n\n\nThe singer who performed the Canadian anthem before the 4 Nations Face-Off championship game Thursday night changed a lyric in \"O Canada\" to protest President Donald Trump’s repeated comments about annexing Canada as the 51st state.\n\nChantal Kreviazuk changed the lyric from \"in all of us command\" to \"that only us command.\"\n\nTrump, meanwhile, repeated his calls for Canada to become the 51st state on Thursday afternoon, before the start of the hockey championship game.\n\nWhy did the Canadian anthem singer change the lyric?\n\nKreviazuk later confirmed that the lyric change was in response to Trump.\n\nWhat they're saying:\n\nDuring Canada’s 3-2 overtime victory, Kreviazuk told The Associated Press that she did it \"because I believe in democracy, and a sovereign nation should not have to be defending itself against tyranny and fascism.\"\n\nRELATED: What would it take for Canada to become the 51st state?\n\n\"I’m somebody who grew up on music that spoke to the heart and the moment, and it shaped me as a songwriter and really as a human being,\" she added. \"I don’t think it would be authentic to me to be given a world stage and not express myself and be true to myself.\"\n\nKreviazuk, who is from Winnipeg, Manitoba, also wrote the phrase \"that only us command\" with mascara on her left hand. She posted a picture of that on her Instagram.\n\n\"I just put it on there so if I ever had a moment and I kind of froze, I would be able to look at my hand and see it,\" Kreviazuk said. \"I’d love to see people sort of get inspired and catch the fire and say their heart more in their art. ... Sometimes you just got to speak the truth in your art and it’s awesome. That’s what it should be about.\"\n\nThe NHL declined to comment.\n\nDid Americans boo the Canadian anthem?\n\nFans in Boston lightly booed Kreviazuk’s version, though it was soon drowned out by her singing. The crowd in Montreal booed \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" prior to U.S. tournament games at Bell Centre last week, more vociferously before the team faced Canada.\n\nWhy are tensions rising between the U.S. and Canada?\n\nBig picture view:\n\nTensions have risen between the neighbors and longtime allies over the past several weeks as Trump has suggested multiple times that Canada become the 51st U.S. state. He’s threatening steep tariffs as a way to force Canada into becoming part of the U.S.\n\n\"I think they have to become the 51st state,\" Trump said Thursday. \"And, you heard the people booing the national anthem, but I think ultimately they'll be praising the national anthem. We'll have to work out some deal with it, because I do like the ‘O Canada’ … It's a beautiful thing. I think we're going to have to keep it for the 51st state.\"\n\nThe other side:\n\nCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has said that will never happen.\n\n\"You can’t take our country — and you can’t take our game,\" Trudeau posted on X after Canada won the hockey championship.\n\nDavid McGuinty, Canada’s Public Safety Minister, said the same when asked about it Thursday.\n\n\"Canada is a sovereign and independent country. It has been for over 150 years and will remain so. This discussion of 51st state is a non-starter,\" McGuinty said.",

        "content": "The Brief Father Judge defeated Roman Catholic, 41-34 in boys basketball for the Catholic League championship. This marks Father Judge boys basketball team's first championship win since 1998. FOX 29's Ellen Kolodziej has a recap of the championship.\n\n\n\nFrom the Public League to the Catholic League, it was a battle for the ages!\n\nFather Judge took on Roman Catholic with an ending that felt like this year's Super Bowl.\n\nWhat we know:\n\nRoman Catholic was going for a three-peat and its 35th championship, while Father Judge had not won since 1998, when its coach was a player on the team.\n\nAt the Cathedral of basketball, the trash talk overpowered the prayers.\n\n\"This game means everything to us, everything! Why do they think they can play us? Do they know who we are?\" said Brady Helm of Roman Catholic.\n\n\"We are bringing it back to Solly Avenue for the first time in 25 years. Let's go, let's go, let's go!\" cheered the Judge kids.\n\nIt's the Holy Grail of Catholic high schools, no matter what parish you're from—the Catholic League championship.\n\nThe matchup pitted two all-boys schools with so much tradition and so many faithful fans.\n\n\"It's exciting. You see the kids bought in, and it's nice to have that back at Father Judge. It gives the kids something to remember forever,\" said Brian Patrick King, president of Father Judge High School.\n\n\"A lot of history, a lot of tradition for our alumni, for our students, for our families. This means everything, and we're just excited for a great game!\" said John Prendergast, president of Roman Catholic High School.\n\nAnd they saw a great game indeed! After overcoming a 10-point deficit, the Crusaders of Father Judge slayed the mighty Cahillites of Roman, 41 to 34.\n\nWhat they're saying:\n\nA crushing defeat for Roman, but Coach Chris McNesby was gracious in the defeat.\n\n\"It's a great basketball game. So happy for them. They're a great program. Chris Roantree does a great job. Great for the league. Tough one for our guys. Played hard, competed, but great atmosphere for high school basketball,\" said McNesby.\n\n\"We just made history today. It means a lot to us. Everybody is happy. We did it for the alumni, our family, we did it for each other... yes!\" said Kevair Kennedy of Father Judge.\n\n\"It's the best group of guys you could ever have as a team. I'm just so proud of all of them,\" said the coach.\n\n\"We believed in each other through the ups and downs. After some losses that we took, we didn't stop trusting each other. We kept trusting each other, and this is the result,\" said Nazir Tyler of Father Judge.\n\nIt was a full-circle moment for Coach Jim Roantree and Assistant Coach Jim Reeves, who both played on the last winning Judge team 27 years ago.\n\n\"They doubted us in '98, they doubted us in '25, and we're cutting the nets down again. It's a beautiful thing,\" said Jim Reeves, Father Judge coach.\n\nRoman Catholic obviously put on a brave effort and fought right up until the end, but as some of the Crusaders told Kolodziej, they felt like they were the Eagles stopping the Kansas City Chiefs from a three-peat.",

        "content": ".\n\nThe Brief A possible motive for the deadly hospital shooting in York, Pennsylvania, is still unknown. Officials say the suspect had recent contact with the ICU \"for a medical purpose.\" The hospital remained closed to visitors on Sunday.\n\n\n\nThe man who authorities say entered a Pennsylvania hospital with zip ties and a pistol over the weekend had recent contact with the hospital's intensive care unit, where he took staff members hostage and was killed in a shootout that left a police officer dead and others injured.\n\nWhat we don't know:\n\nInvestigators released no new information Sunday about a possible motive for the shooting at UPMC Memorial Hospital in York on Saturday, in which a doctor, nurse, custodian and two other officers were injured.\n\nWhat they're saying:\n\nYork County District Attorney Tim Barker said during a news conference Saturday that the man — identified as 49-year-old Diogenes Archangel-Ortiz — appeared to have had recent contact with the ICU \"for a medical purpose involving another person.\" He didn’t release any details or identify Archangel-Ortiz’s relationship to the person, citing privacy concerns.\n\nWhile the investigation is in its early stages, Barker said after watching surveillance video and reviewing statements by police and workers that it appeared the shooter intentionally targeted the workers there.\n\nThe backstory:\n\nThe injured hospital workers were reported to be in stable condition Sunday, and UPMC officials said they were \"progressing in their recovery.\" The hospital remained closed to visitors.\n\n\"We know that families and visitors are vital to helping patients heal, and we are working toward making visitation possible again,\" the hospital said in a statement.\n\nBarker said the hospital's own security officers were first on the scene and that the gunman fired at them, prompting a call for backup.\n\nDozens of officers responded from multiple agencies. When they attempted to access the ICU, the gunman was holding a female staff member at gunpoint and ordered police back behind the doors. They complied to ensure the worker wouldn't be hurt.\n\nAuthorities said Archangel-Ortiz ended up entering the hallway with the staff member, her hands bound with zip ties.\n\n\"The officers, left with no recourse, did open fire,\" Barker said, and the gunman was killed.\n\nThe officer who died was identified as Andrew Duarte, 30, of the West York Borough Police Department.\n\nDuarte was a law enforcement veteran who joined the department in 2022 after five years with the Denver Police Department, according to his LinkedIn profile. He described receiving a \"hero award\" in 2021 from Mothers Against Drunk Driving for his work in impaired driving enforcement for the state of Colorado.\n\nWhat's next:\n\nPennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro ordered flags be flown half-staff to honor Duarte.\n\nThe two wounded officers, from Northern York County Regional and Springettsbury Township police departments, were reported in stable condition. Their identities weren't immediately released.\n\nDig deeper:\n\nThe shooting was the latest episode of a wave of gun violence in recent years that has swept through U.S. hospitals and medical centers, which have struggled to adapt to the growing threats. Such attacks have contributed to making health care one of the nation’s most dangerous fields, with workers suffering more nonfatal injuries from workplace violence than workers in any other profession, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",

Most of the federal government’s workforce is based outside the Washington, D.C. area.\n\nWhat they're saying:\n\n\"If you’re doing, say, vegetation sampling and prescribed fire as your main work, there aren’t many jobs,\" Eric Anderson, 48, of Chicago, told the Associated Press. Anderson was fired Feb. 14 from his job as a biological science technician at Indiana Dunes National Park.\n\nCathy Nguyen, 51, of Honolulu, was laid off last month from her job at USAID, where she helped manage the PEPFAR program, which combats HIV/AIDS. \"It’s requiring me to rethink how I want to spend my professional life,\" Nguyen shared with the AP.\n\nLawsuit filed over Elon Musk email demand to federal workers\n\nA lawsuit was filed Monday against Elon Musk’s email threat to federal employees that was sent over the weekend. Attorneys for federal workers say in a lawsuit that Musk violated the law with his demand that employees explain their accomplishments or risk being fired.\n\nThe backstory:\n\nElon Musk tweeted during the weekend that all federal employees will be asked to report \"what they got done last week,\" and that failure to reply would be considered a resignation.\n\nRELATED: Elon Musk email to federal employees targeted in lawsuit\n\nMoments later, federal workers received a three-line email telling them to share \"approx. 5 bullets of what you accomplished last week and cc your manager.\"\n\nTrump administration offers buyouts to federal workers\n\nDig deeper:\n\nPresident Donald Trump’s administration is offering buyouts to federal employees to quickly reduce the government workforce through the deferred resignation program.\n\nThe buyouts are for all full-time federal employees except for military personnel, employees of the U.S. Postal Service and those in positions related to immigration enforcement and national security. Workers will receive roughly eight months of salary if they accept the offer, the Associated Press reported.\n\nRELATED: Federal worker buyout deadline: What we know about the deferred resignation program\n\nThis buyout is led by Elon Musk, one of President Donald Trump’s advisers, who has organized a financial incentive for workers to leave their government jobs by offering several months of pay in exchange for their resignation, the Associated Press reported.\n\nHow many government workers are there?\n\nBy the numbers:\n\nThe federal government employs over 3 million people, accounting for 1.9% of the nation’s entire civilian workforce, the Associated Press reported, citing the Pew Research Center. The civilian workforce is about 2.4 million, not including the U.S. Postal Service employees and active-duty military.\n\nAlmost 20% of federal workers are in Washington, D.C., Maryland, and Virginia. California has 147,500 federal employees, but it's less than 1% of total nonfarming employees in the state, the AP noted. Texas has 130,000 federal workers, but that accounts for less than 1% of nonfarming jobs there and Florida has 94,000.",

(Photo by Smith Collection/Gado/Getty Images)\n\n\"In approving this increase, the CNGC considered that the target total cash compensation for the named executive officers (other than the CEO) was at or below the 15th percentile of the target total cash compensation of executives holding similar positions at the peer group of companies that the Company benchmarks against for executive compensation purposes,\" Meta said.\n\nWith the change, the total cash compensation for the non-CEO executives at Meta \"falls at approximately the 50th percentile of the Peer Group Target Cash Compensation.\"\n\nThe higher bonuses come after Meta signaled in mid-January that it would cut 5% of its workforce based on performance. Zuckerberg said in a memo, \"I've decided to raise the bar on performance management and move out low-performers faster.\"\n\n\"We typically manage out people who aren't meeting expectations over the course of a year, but now we're going to do more extensive performance-based cuts during the year,\" he said.\n\nMeta said that it is planning to reach 10% of \"non-regrettable\" attrition before the end of its current performance cycle. That figure includes about 5% non-regrettable attrition from 2024, according to the memo.\n\nMeta, which is also the parent company of Instagram , WhatsApp and Oculus in addition to Facebook, has seen its stock rise by about 14.8% since the start of the year.\n\nLast month, Zuckerberg said the company is planning to invest up to $65 billion in the company's artificial intelligence (AI) initiatives.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\nHe wrote in a post on Facebook that 2025 \"will be a defining year for AI,\" and said he expects the company's \"Meta AI will be the leading assistant serving more than 1 billion people, Llama 4 will become the leading state of the art model, and we'll build an AI engineer that will start contributing increasing amounts of code to our R&D efforts.\"\n\nRead more of this story from FOX Business.",
