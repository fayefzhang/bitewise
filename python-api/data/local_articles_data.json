        "content": "A lawsuit filed by Jack Sullivan’s parents says the social media companies facilitated the crime through their platforms and failed to remove predatory accounts. Eighteen hours after Jack Sullivan received an Instagram message from a user who called themselves Alice Dave, he was dead. The 20-year-old Kutztown University sophomore was watching a movie, his father next to him on the couch intheirAbingtonhome, when the young, strange woman sparked a flirtatious conversation. The two exchanged messages, and later intimate photos on Snapchat — the app infamous for disappearing messages. But later on that January 2023 night, Alice’s flirty texts were replaced with threats that if Sullivan didn’t send money, she would share the photos with his family, friends, and campus community. “all u have to do is cooperate with me and i will not expose u, if you block me i will ruin your life,” Alice wrote, according to law enforcement records. “don’t try to act smart I know where you live.” By the following afternoon, Sullivan transferred roughly $2,800, court records show. But his extortionist refused to delete the photos. Less than 24 hours after the first message, Sullivan walked onto train tracks leading to theJenkintownSEPTAstation.He paced on the tracks for a few minutes as Alice demanded more payments. “I don’t even think I have enough for it,” he wrote. Three minutes later a passing train struck and killed him. Sullivan’s death was originally ruled a suicide, but the coroner’s office in Montgomery County changed the cause of death to homicide once details of the events leading up to it became clear. Sullivanwas a victim of an online sexual extortion, orsextortion, scheme. Federal law enforcement has been prosecuting two Nigerian men, Imoleayo Samuel Aina and Samuel Olasunkanmi Abiodun, in connection with Alice’s account and Sullivan’s death. Amid the criminal prosecution, Sullivan’s parents filed a civil lawsuit against the social media companies that they said facilitated the crime through their platforms and failed to remove predatory accounts. The December complaint, filed in Common Pleas Court in Philadelphia, accuses Meta — which owns Facebook and Instagram — and Snap Inc. — which owns Snapchat — of deliberately creating addictive platforms without protecting vulnerable users. “They gave these individuals the tools, the environment, the platform, the algorithm, and the pool of victims to commit their crimes,” said Kevin O’Brien, an attorney with Stampone O’Brien Dilsheimer Holloway who represents the family. The lawsuit is the latest against tech giants as lawmakers and judges struggle to determine whether social media platforms are neutral publishers of third-party content or products that can be held liable for harm they cause. “Sextortion is a horrific crime,” a spokesperson for Meta said. “We work aggressively to fight it, disrupting networks of scammers and supporting law enforcement in investigating and prosecuting them.” Snap Inc. did not respond to a request for comment. The lawsuit also names SEPTA, and businesses that own the land leading to the tracks, as defendants. A spokesperson for SEPTA declined to comment on the litigation but said the agency’s investigation found the train engineer reacted appropriately. When Jim Sullivan, Jack Sullivan’s father, received the call that his son was found dead on the train tracks, he was shocked and set out to piece together his son’s last hours, ultimately learning of the threats from his son’s phone. He reached out to Alice, who responded with more threats. “So we very clearly understood exactly what had happened,” Jim Sullivan said. Jim Sullivan worked with law enforcement to identify the people who extorted his son, and Aina and Abiodun wereextraditedin August to face charges of cyberstalking resulting in death, extortion, and wire fraud, and other offenses. » READ MORE:What is Sextortion and how can you help prevent it? | Expert Opinion Abiodun has pleaded guilty to wire fraud and conspiracy to commit money laundering, and awaits sentencing. Aina’s prosecution is ongoing. Their attorneys did not respond to requests for comment. The U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania declined to comment. Both men are allegedly associated with a network of mostly Nigerian scammers known as “Yahoo Boys,” originally named for the use of Yahoo email accounts. Sextortion incidents have increased in recent years, the FBI says. Perpetrators most commonly target boys ages 14 to 17, and the agency received more than 13,000 reports of sextortion between October 2021 and March 2023 that led to at least 20 deaths. In August, Levi Maciejewski, the 13-year-old son of the head football coach at Shippensburg University in Cumberland County, died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound after he was preyed on in a sextortion scheme,PennLive reported. “This can happen to anybody,” Jim Sullivan said. The Sullivans’ lawsuit goes to the heart of an ongoing debate over harms of social media use — especially for young people — and the legal responsibilities of tech companies. As many as 95% of American teens are on social media platforms, and a third report using them “almost constantly,”according to research cited in a 2023 advisory by the U.S. Surgeon General’s Office. Teens who spend more than three hours a day on social media platforms have double the risk of depression and anxiety, and half of teens report that social media makes them feel worse about the way they look, according to the advisory. Children and teens on social media are also exposed to “challenges” that can promote risky behavior. For example, a 10-year-old Chester girl, Nylah Anderson,died in 2021 while attempting the “blackout challenge,”a viralTikToktrend that encouraged children to use household items to choke themselves. The mental health harms, risky challenges, and scams have led to lawsuits by parents nationwide. And courts have been struggling to apply laws that were written before the advent of social media to the reality of complex algorithms and personalized feeds. So far, the U.S. Supreme Court has found thatsocial media platforms are not liable when bad actors use their algorithm. For example, the courtheld in 2023that social media companies were not aiding and abetting terrorism when their algorithms recommended ISIS-related content and their platforms were used for recruitment. “If the Mafia uses the phones, AT&T is not responsible if the godfather places a hit on someone,” said Amanda Shanor, a professor of legal studies and business ethics at the Wharton School of Business at the University of Pennsylvania, in explaining the rationale for these decisions. » READ MORE:A Delco mom can sue TikTok for her daughter’s death during a ‘blackout challenge,’ federal appeals court rules But what many lawsuits — including the Sullivans’ complaint — argue is that the platform addicted users, increasing their risk for poor mental health. Or, in Jack Sullivan’s case, increasing the chance that he would be an available victim. “This isn’t like a phone, this is like a cigarette,” Shanor said, describing the argument. Last year,the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit rejected TikTok’s argumentthat it cannot be sued over Nylah’s death. And other lawsuits challenging protections for social media companies are making their way through federal courts. Meta has taken steps to reduce the risk of sextortion on its platforms, including an effort to specifically target the Yahoo Boys. In July, the company announced that it removed around63,000 Instagram accounts from Nigeria that attempted to target other users for sextortion. It also removed Facebook accounts, pages, and groups that were run by the Yahoo Boys. Meta also incorporated a feature that blurs nude images in messages and warns people of the risks of sending them, a spokesperson said. The Sullivans’ lawsuit says this effort is proof Meta could have removed accounts earlier, but didn’t. “There was nothing preventing these measures, design changes, and/or reasonable warnings from being implemented and integrated into the application products well in advance” of Jack Sullivan’s Jan. 4, 2023, death, the complaint says. » READ MORE:A Lyft driver was killed in Fairhill by the driver of a stolen Kia. His daughter is suing the car company for making the vehicles so easy to steal. Snapchat, with its main feature of disappearing messages, could not have been betterdesigned for the Yahoo Boys if the scammers had designed it themselves, saidO’Brien, the Sullivans’ lawyer. Jim Sullivan hopes the lawsuit can push social media companies to do more. And he plans to use his experience to speak to young people about the risks that exist on social media. He wants teens and college students to know that it is possible to walk away from an extortion attempt and connect with an authority figure, despite the shame and fear. “Jack was optimistic and a problem solver, empathetic, and a helper, and all of these really great, positive resourceful things, and couldn’t see his way out of this trap,” he said. “You can get yourself out of it.”",

        "content": "With pitchers and catchers due to report for spring training in less than two weeks, it’s time to assess the Phillies’ future, with input from opposing scouts. It didn’t require much squinting for thePhilliesto see Starlyn Caba as a future major-league shortstop. But for an organization that’s trying to balance winning aWorld Serieswith a $300 million roster and ripening the farm system, there are limits to how many prospects can be off-limits in trades. So, after a year of hanging up on teams that called about Caba, the Philliesdealt him to the Marlinsin December for lefty starter Jesús Luzardo. Even so, the Phillies wouldn’t have made the move if not for Luzardo’s reasonable salary ($6.225 million this year) and two seasons of club control. At least not for Caba, “who we like a great deal,” president of baseball operationsDave Dombrowskisaid last month. » READ MORE:Phillies storylines to watch in 2025: Transforming Trea Turner, welcoming back Alec Bohm, and more But while Caba recently cracked Baseball America’s top 100 prospects list at No. 72, the Phillies’ farm system still features Andrew Painter (No. 9), Aidan Miller (36), Eduardo Tait (93), and Justin Crawford (96). Painter is expected to make his major-league debut this year; Miller and Crawford will join him as non-roster invitees to major-league camp. And because pitchers and catchers are due to report for spring training in less than two weeks, it’s time for The Inquirer’s ranking of the top 10 Phillies prospects, an annual exercise carried out with input from opposing scouts. Age:22 (on April 10) |Height/weight:6-foot-7 / 215 |Throws:Right 2024 stats:Did not pitch (injured). Outlook:He’sbaaaaaaack. Sort of. Eighteen months after an elbow-ligament reconstruction, Painter will throw bullpen sessions and do everything else with the healthy pitchers in major-league camp. But hewon’t pitch in spring training games, Dombrowski said, because the Phillies want to balance an innings limit in his return from injury with having him available later in the season. » READ MORE:Andrew Painter is healthy and pitching again. Here’s how the Phillies are planning for his return in 2025. Key question:When will he finally make his major-league debut? “July-ish,” in Dombrowski’s words. If all goes as planned in a buildup that will continue in Clearwater after camp breaks and proceed through the minors, Painter will touch down in Philly by the summer. He affirmed his health — and cemented his status as a top-five pitching prospect in the sport — by dominating the Arizona Fall League (2.30 ERA, four walks, 18 strikeouts in 15⅔ innings). His fastball returned to the upper-90s, and he flashed a harder slider. “He’s one of the best pitchers I’ve seen,” Guardians top prospect Chase DeLauter told MLB.com. “Elite stuff.” Age:21 (on June 9) |Height/weight:6-2 / 205 |Bats/throws:Right 2024 stats:.275/.401/.483, 5 HR, 14.3% walk rate, 21.4% strikeout rate at low-A Clearwater (182 plate appearances); .258/.353/.444, 5 HR, 11.6% BB rate, 22.1% K rate at high-A Jersey Shore (258 PA); .191/.227/.191, 0 HR, 0 BB%, 18.2% K rate at double-A Reading (22 PA). Outlook:Through 18 games after getting promoted to high-A in June, Miller batted .167 with one homer, 19 strikeouts, and a .558 OPS. Over his next 40 games, he batted .296 with five homers, 38 strikeouts, and an .897 OPS. And scouts who didn’t already believe in him were converted to the cult. “All-Star upside,” said one NL talent evaluator. “He’s got a good chance to succeed as a high-contact, extra-base-hit guy in the 20- to 25-homer realm by 2026.” » READ MORE:Aidan Miller ‘can get used to this’ after teaming up with Phillies top prospects Key question:Is he a long-term shortstop? When the Phillies drafted Miller in the first round in 2023, the industry presumption was that he would eventually shift over to third base. It hasn’t happened. And withTrea Turnerlikely to move from shortstop within the next few years, it’s sensible to keep Miller where he is. Besides, as one scout noted, Miller is “not flashy or quick, but steady, poised, and very instinctive” at shortstop. Age:21 |Height/weight:6-1 / 175 |Bats/throws:Left/right 2024 stats:.301/.349/.438, 6 HR, 27-for-35 stolen bases, 6.6% BB rate, 20.1% K rate at Jersey Shore (317 PA); .333/.380/.455, 3 HR, 15-for-16 SB, 6.1% BB rate, 16.1% K rate at Reading (180 PA). Outlook:Within the scouting community, the most frequently cited criticism of Crawford is his extreme tendency to hit the ball on the ground. It’s notable, then, that his ground-ball rate went from 69.7% in 2023 to 60.9% last year. There’s room for further improvement, but given his speed, Crawford can turn ant-killing grounders into infield hits. He led the farm system in hits (143) and was second in doubles (25) last season, then homered to lead Team USA into the medal round of the Premier 12 Tournament in November. » READ MORE:Phillies prospect Justin Crawford lived ‘a dream’ playing for Team USA Key question:Will he graduate to the majors this year? The Phillies have had seven opening-day center fielders in the last seven years. Crawford is a long shot to be No. 8. But if Crawford makes an impression in his first major-league camp, Dombrowski won’t be shy about pushing him. With the Red Sox, Dombrowski called up Andrew Benintendi at age 21 from double A in 2016 and Rafael Devers at age 20 after nine triple-A games in 2017. Crawford’s father, Carl, made his major-league debut at age 20. Justin’s time is coming. Age:18 |Height/weight:5-11 / 219 |Bats/throws:Left/right 2024 stats:.321/.377/.500, 6 HR, 6.1% BB rate, 14.6% K rate in rookie ball (212 PA); .269/.316/.462, 5 HR, 7% BB rate, 28.9% K rate at Clearwater (114 PA). Outlook:In 1998, the Phillies signed a teenage catcher from Panama for $8,000. Carlos Ruiz turned out to be pretty good. They returned to that Central America country in 2022 and paid $90,000 for Tait. So far, the reviews are positive. Tait’s calling card is his left-handed power that one scout labeled as “special.” In his first season in the United States, he registered some of the highest exit velocities recorded by Phillies minor leaguers. After beginning the season in rookie ball, he ended it as one of the youngest players in the Florida State League. » READ MORE:J.T. Realmuto or … who? The Phillies will face a complex decision with their star catcher. Key question:Will he stay behind the plate? It can be difficult for talent evaluators to predict the future of a catching prospect because of the responsibility that comes with the position. When the catcher is still a teenager, the projection is nearly impossible. One scout cited Tait’s arm strength and said he “has the raw tools to continue to mature defensively.” Another cautioned that Tait’s “fully developed body” might keep growing and take him out from behind the plate. Either way, he’s light-years away from the majors. But his journey will be fascinating to follow. Age:22 (on June 9) |Height/weight:6-1 / 213 |Throws:Right 2024 stats:3.46 ERA, 1.288 WHIP, 13.5% walk rate, 34.2% strikeout rate at Orioles’ high-A Aberdeen (52 innings); 4.15 ERA, 1.038 WHIP, 8.6% BB rate, 37.1% K rate at Jersey Shore (8⅔ IP); 3.66 ERA, 1.068 WHIP, 9.1% BB rate, 45.5% K rate at Reading (19⅔ IP). Outlook:Aftertrading two pitching prospects(George Klassen and Sam Aldegheri) to the Angels at the deadline for reliever Carlos Estévez, the Philliesgot two back(Chace and Seth Johnson) from the Orioles for lefty Gregory Soto. Chace struck out 48 of 112 batters in six starts between Jersey Shore and Reading and exhibited better control than in the past in Baltimore’s system. How’s that for a strong first impression? » READ MORE:Meet the pitching prospects the Phillies got in the Gregory Soto trade: Seth Johnson and Moisés Chace Key question:Does he project as a starter or a reliever? A lot will ride on the development of Chace’s slider — and to a lesser extent, changeup. He throws two variations of a slider: a sweeper and a hard cutter. The latter is a more recent addition and figures to help against left-handed hitters. If he’s able to command both sliders, in addition to a fastball that comes from a low arm slot and tends to miss bats, he will have the weapons to go through a lineup multiple times. Age:23 |Height/weight:6-5 / 190 |Throws:Right 2024 stats:6.46 ERA, 1.813 WHIP, 15.1% BB rate, 22.7% K rate at triple-A Lehigh Valley (108⅔ innings). Outlook:Look out below. Once regarded alongside Painter asNo. 1 and 1Ain the Phillies system, Abel is tumbling down the prospect chart after a dreadful season in which he couldn’t throw strikes consistently. His struggles began with an illness late in spring training, and things got only marginally better. (Abel had a 6.88 ERA at the All-Star break, 5.75 thereafter.) But he stayed healthy and topped 100 innings for a second consecutive season. » READ MORE:From 2023: Don’t forget about Mick Abel, the other half of the Phillies’ best pitching prospect duo in 20 years Key question:Was 2024 a developmental speed bump or a warning sign? Perspective is important. Abel pitched last season at 22, five years younger than the average age in the triple-A International League, according toBaseball-Reference.com. That isn’t insignificant. He’s also a cerebral student of pitching, and with a five-pitch repertoire, there’s a lot for him to think about. Maybe he’d benefit from simplifying things. Mostly, though, it comes down to throwing strikes and trusting his stuff to get high-level hitters out. Nori’s age:20| Height/weight:5-10 / 190| Bats/throws:Left Burkholder’s age:19| Height/weight:6-2 / 195| Bats/throws:Right Nori’s 2024 stats:.240/.424/.280, 0 HR, 4-for-6 SB, 24.2% BB rate, 21.2% K rate at Clearwater (66 PA) Burkholder’s 2024 stats:.500/.500/1.500, 0 HR, 0% BB rate, 0% K rate at Clearwater (2 PA) Outlook:It feels like a cop-out to lump together the Phillies’first two picks from the 2024 draft, but the on-field sample size isn’t large enough for scouts to separate them. Burkholder, in particular, played only four innings in his pro debut Aug. 13 before straining his hamstring. After a glimpse of Nori, one scout noted his speed and on-base ability and projected a Johnny “Damon-esque-type ceiling” as a center fielder. » READ MORE:Phillies draft high school outfielders Dante Nori and Griffin Burkholder with their first two picks Key question:Which outfielder will be the better player? The comparisons are inevitable. Not only were Nori and Burkholder drafted only 36 picks apart, but both came out of high school. They even got identical signing bonuses ($2,497,500). Nori’s speed and defense in center field might make him the safer bet; Burkholder’s right-handed power potential might boost his ceiling. They’re expected to share the outfield for Clearwater this season. Age:24 (on March 3)| Height/weight:6-3 / 225| Bats/throws:Left/right 2024 stats:.263/.357/.487, 11 HR, 20-for-27 SB, 11.6% BB rate, 25.6% K rate at Reading (258 PA) Outlook:After missing two months last season with a torn ligament in his right thumb, Rincones batted .296 with eight doubles, six homers, and a .961 OPS in his first 23 games upon rejoining Reading’s lineup. Consider it a snapshot of his potential. To make up for lost time, the Phillies sent him to the Arizona Fall League, where he reached base at a .367 clip with only two homers but also just seven strikeouts in 90 plate appearances. If he stays healthy, there’s 20-homer/20-steal upside. » READ MORE:From 2023: The Phillies’ next great hitting prospect might be a Scottish Venezuelan-American with a frame like Pat Burrell Key question:Could he contribute in the majors this season? Maybe. It’s no secret the Phillies lack corner-outfield depth, but they’re so thin that they recently purchased 22-year-old Dylan Campbell from the Dodgers for international bonus money. Rincones might open the season back in double A, but it won’t be long before he’s in Lehigh Valley. And if the Phillies need help beyondNick Castellanos, Max Kepler,Brandon Marsh, Johan Rojas, Weston Wilson, and perhaps out-of-options Kody Clemens, they will reach down and find … Rincones? Age:23| Height/weight:6-0 / 160| Throws:Right 2024 stats:3.39 ERA, 1.091 WHIP, 8% BB rate, 29% K rate at Jersey Shore (77 IP); 4.85 ERA, 1.517 WHIP, 6.1% BB rate, 14.4% K rate at Reading (29⅔ IP). Outlook:The Phillies added Cabrera to the 40-man roster in November because they didn’t want to risk losing him in the Rule 5 draft. And he probably would’ve been selected. Never mind his slight build. The skinny righty pitched into the sixth inning in 10 of 19 starts and struck out nearly 25% of batters. He does it with two fastballs but also an above-average changeup that is widely considered his best pitch. » READ MORE:Will Bryson Stott and Orion Kerkering be part of the next Phillies core? Their 2025 seasons will be telling. Key question:Is his future in the bullpen? Undersize pitchers don’t tend to stick in starting rotations. Across baseball last season, only eight 5-foot-11 or shorter pitchers made at least five starts. The Phillies haven’t had a 5-foot-11 or shorter pitcher make at least five starts in a season since Pedro Martínez and Antonio Bastardo in 2009. Cabrera has the repertoire to be a starter. It will come down to commanding his pitches and staying healthy. Age:20| Height/weight:5-10 / 180| Bats/throws:Right 2024 stats:.338/.495/.481, 3 HR, 9-for-9 SB, 20.2% BB rate, 9.6% K rate in rookie ball (104 PA). Outlook:Remember this name. Multiple scouts listed Escobar as a sleeper in the Phillies’ farm system. He signed for $450,000 out of  Venezuela in 2022 and made a solid, albeit brief, stateside debut last season in the Florida Complex League. Sidelined by double shin splints after 24 games, he flashed impressive bat-to-ball skills and sneaky power. One NL scout compared him to the Astros’ Isaac Paredes for both his contact rate and infield versatility. » READ MORE:The Phillies’ reliever numbers don’t add up now, but that’s part of Dave Dombrowski’s bullpen-building calculation Key question:Where does he stack up among Phillies infield prospects? Bryan Rincon, a switch-hitting shortstop who turns 21 next week, gets strong reviews for his defense. Devin Saltiban, who turns 20 next month, has more advanced skills at the plate and the versatility to project as a utility player in the majors. Given his age and inexperience, Escobar might be more of a project but have a higher ceiling, according to one NL scout. The Phillies figure to challenge him at the low-A level.",

        "content": "And, Brandon Graham returns to practice for the Eagles. Saquon Barkley cannot wait to play in his first Super Bowl. Brandon Graham cannot wait to play in his third — and he might get the chance. It’s a long shot, for sure, but the 36-year-old defensive end returned to the field Thursday as the Eagles opened the 21-day practice window for him. Graham said his season was finished after he suffered a torn triceps on Nov. 24 and yet here he is, preparing for a chance to face the Kansas City Chiefs on Feb. 9. The New York Times and Forbes have reported that torn triceps typically take five to six months to fully heal. “So far, man, this has been one of the easiest injuries I’ve had compared to the ones I had before,” Graham insisted. “If it’s not feeling right, I’m not going to do it, butso far, so good.” Again, it’s a long shot, but what a story it would be. Barkley will be a story for sure when he celebrates his 28th birthday on Super Bowl Sunday. In the midst of a historic first season with theBirds, the All-Pro running back is intent on sealing the deal. His Eagles teammates have told him how wrenching it was losing the Super Bowl two years ago. “Definitely don’t want to be part of that,” Barkley said. “That’s definitely something that drives us. For those guys that have been a part of it, but also just want to get the job done and knowing how it is for those guys, how it felt, and doing everything I can in my ... ability to make surethat doesn’t happen.” — Jim Swan,@phillysport,sports.daily@inquirer.com.

That became official Thursday when Tyrese Maxey was not selected as a reserve for the Eastern Conference. Perennial All-Stars Joel Embiid and Paul George were already taken out of contention, largely because of injuries. As for Maxey, his exclusion could be considered a snub. The point guard is sixth in scoring at 27.6 points per game and third in steals with 2.0 per game. His best work came in the Sixers’ most recent games. Maxey has scored 28 points or more in his last 12 games, joining Hall of Famers Wilt Chamberlain and Allen Iverson and teammate Embiid as the only players to maintain such a streak. Maxey faced steep competition at guard, though. Selected as reserves for the East were Boston’s Jaylen Brown, Milwaukee’s Damian Lillard, Cleveland’s Darius Garland, Miami’s Tyler Herro, andDetroit’s Cade Cunningham. Playing for the 49ers, linebacker Oren Burks found himself thrust into Super Bowl LVIII last year when starter Dre Greenlaw went down with an injury. Burks is headed back to the big game, this time as an injury replacement for Nakobe Dean. And this time, Burks is coming off one of the best games of his career in the NFC championship game. “The season has a lot of ebbs and flows, but this is the big one that you’ve beenpreparing for your whole life,” Burks said. The Chiefs are saying all the right things as they get ready for the Eagles. Andy Reid heaped praise on the Birds, saying “they’re fully loaded on the offensive side.” Ahead of their game Thursday with the New York Islanders, the Flyers decided to make a change on the blue line. They called up a Swedish defenseman from Lehigh Valley, but it was not Emil Andrae or Helge Grans. This time, the Flyers called up Adam Ginning from the Phantoms. A stay-at-home defenseman, Ginning brings one thing for sure to the Flyersat 6-foot-4: size. Amid that game, it was discovered that the Flyers struck a deal with the Calgary Flames to trade both Morgan Frost and Joel Farabee in exchange for Andrei Kuzmenko and Jakob Pelletier, a 2025 second-round pick, and a 2028 seventh-round pick. An interesting move, considering both Frost and Farabee were once valued as part of ayoung group poised to lead the Flyers. The team could use some guidance at the moment, following a3-0 loss to the New York Islanders last night. Our Devin Jackson is at Senior Bowl workouts in Mobile, Ala., checking out the next batch of NFL players ahead of the draft in April.

The Eaglesplay the Kansas City Chiefs in Super Bowl LIX on Feb. 9 at 6:30 p.m. (Fox29). We asked you: Who kick-started your Eagles fandom? Among your responses: My earliest memory of watching the Eagles (on a tiny black and white TV) was during the 1956 season﻿. However, I will never forget listening to the NFL championship game at Franklin Field between the Eagles and Vince Lombardi’s Green Bay Packers in December 1960 on WCAU Radio — because home games were blacked out on local TV — with my Dad. I can still hear Bill Campbell’s voice counting down the final seconds of the 17-13 win after Chuck Bednarik’s final tackle of Jim Taylor on the Eagle 10-yard line. Oh, and did I mention, my father and I were jumping up and down? If there were a moment when I truly became a proud Eagle fan, that was it.— John D. I’ve been a fan since the mid ’50s but it was the “Cinderella” 1960 championship team that really kick-started my fandom. They were picked to finish last in the conference ( back then there were 2 conferences-8 teams in each. The 2 teams that finished in 1st place played for the championship). We finished 10-2 and beat Green Bay, 17-13. Caught them just before the Lombardi dynasty kicked in. Van Brocklin, McDonald, Bednarik, Retzlaff, et al... Great year!— Jack H. The Eagles won the NFL championships in 1948 and ’49, beating the Chicago Cardinals and then the L.A. Rams. We did not have a TV, but I would see newsreels of the team on the Saturday morning movies at Media and Drexel Hill when we would go to see the Westerns. Then I followed them in the newspapers back then and talked about them with my school friends. Bosh Pritchard, Pete Pihos, Tommy Thompson, and Steve Van Buren were the stars. I sometime rode my bike from Springfield to Clifton Heights to visit Steve Van Buren on Baltimore Pike where he was selling cars during the offseason. I did not see a live game until the 1950’s.— Everett S. This is gonna sound super lame, but I have the people at EA sports to thank! When I was about 7 or 8, I downloaded Madden Mobile on my iPad. One of the first things you had to do was choose a team! I picked the Eagles because I was (and am) a very patriotic person and associated eagles with America. Less than a few years later [Nick Foles] led us to our first ring.— Stiles B. My dad got me going with the Eagles, but they were not totally on my radar until the 1960 NFL championship. Back then, the league wasn’t the TV presence it has become, nor was any pro sport. When we visited my grandparents on Sundays, we’d watch home games on a black-and-white TV in a tiny room on the second floor, so as not to distract the family. It was that classic win over Green Bay, and Concrete Charlie basically holding Jimmy Taylor down as the clock ran down and the Birds won. This 11-year-old was sold for good.— Mike R.

        "content": "The Philly DA, soon expected to announce his campaign for reelection, said his office won’t interfere in legal actions taken by ICE. But if agents act beyond their legal scope or bring harm to immigrants, he said, “Try me.” Philadelphia District AttorneyLarry Krasnersaid Friday that local elected officials and law enforcement cannot be forced to comply with the Trump administration’s “Nazi stuff,” referring to the president’s planned crackdown on immigration. “Local law enforcement can volunteer to do Nazi stuff,” Krasner, a Democrat, said. “I’m sure I stand with all my colleagues up here when we say nope, N-O-P-E, nope. Maybe there are some local law enforcement who want to put on jackboots and gray uniforms and march behind this, but not us.” The comment came during a news conference Friday at Philadelphia City Hall where state representatives and City Council members condemned PresidentDonald Trump’s actions on immigration,including rescinding guidance that once barred federal agents from entering churches, schools, and hospitals. Reports of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement activity have reverberated around the Philadelphia area since Trump took office, heightening anxieties for immigrant communities. Earlier this week, ICE agents raided a North Philadelphia car wash,arresting seven people and triggering a protest. Officials on Friday aimed to make the public aware of Philadelphia’s intentions to protect its immigrant communities in the sanctuary city. Krasner, who has long positioned himself as and campaigned on being a staunch adversary to Trump, is expected to launch his reelection bid for a third term as DA in the coming weeks. Earlier this month, formerPhiladelphia Judge Patrick Dugan announced his bid to challenge Krasner. Krasner said the basis of local officials’ noncompliance with federal orders is supported by the Anti-Commandeering Doctrine, which is based on the Tenth Amendment and says “the federal government cannot require states or state officials to adopt or enforce federal law,”according to SCOTUSBlog. A memo from Trump’s Acting Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove, published in various news outlets last week, threatened consequences for local officials who do not cooperate with Trump’s plans to crack down on immigration, adding that local officials are legally bound to cooperate with the U.S. Department of Justice based on the Constitution’s supremacy clause. In light of that memo,Krasner said he and his staff would not comply with any immigration orders that break the law. He expressed a similar sentiment Friday, also acknowledging that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement “is going to do what it is legally and constitutionally entitled to do. ”As a law enforcement officer, we would not interfere with that,” Krasner said. But Krasner added that his office will not hold back from prosecuting ICE agents in Philadelphia for doing “criminal things that go beyond their rights.” “Any ICE agent, any Proud Boy who thinks hate crimes are cool, thinks ‘I can get away with anything because there’s a king in D.C.?’ No, you can’t. That’s not how it’s going to work,” Krasner said. “If you are so inclined to break the law to harm immigrants … if you are inclined to use them as your scapegoat, harm them, be cruel to them, you better do it within the law, and if you don’t, try me.”",

        "title": "Philly’s federal workers are worried about job security and government services amid Trump administration shakeups",
        "source": "https://www.inquirer.com/",
        "content": "The Office of Personnel Management's memo giving employees the chance to resign with eight months' pay is leaving workers pondering their job security. When federal workers received a memo from the U.S. government’s human resources agency this week offering the chance to resign with eight months’ pay, some thought it might be spam. “Once you determine whether it’s real or not, it’s kind of like, what is this?” said Philip Glover, national vice president for the American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE) District 3. His union represents about 9,400 federal workers in and near Philadelphia, among some 800,000 across the U.S. and abroad. Ina memo to federal workers Tuesday, the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM)offereda “deferred resignation.” Those who agree, by Feb. 6, to leave their jobswill retain all pay and benefits — and an exemption from Trump-era in-person work mandates — until Sept. 30. Those who pass up the offer do not have“full assurance” that their position or agency will continue to exist, according to the memo. The memo is one in a series of directives under PresidentDonald Trump’s second administration aimed at overhauling federal agencies. Trump signed several executive orders on his first day in office tofreeze hiring, bring federal workers back to in-person work full time, andend diversity, equity, and inclusion programsin federal government. » READ MORE:Donald Trump’s executive orders are likely to have a tangible impact on Philadelphia’s federal workers The Inquirer spoke with union leaders and local federal workers from across several agencies, some on the basis of anonymity due to fear of retaliation in the workplace. Several said Trump’s executive orders and the resignation memo have caused anxiety, distrust in the federal government, and confusion about the future of their jobs. They’re also concerned that essential government services could suffer. Typically, the leaders of federal agencies communicate with their own employees directly. Federal workers receiving an email from OPM was “very odd” said Glover. Some noticed how the memo’s title —Fork in the Road—mimicked the subject line in Elon Musk’s email to Twitter employeeswhenthe billionaire took over. The recent directives jibewith the goals of the “Department of Government Efficiency,”led by Musk, who has been tasked with identifying and eradicating what’s deemed to be wasteful spending, including shrinking the federal workforce. The memo marked a major shift from the federal government’s usual “level of formality,” said Marie Owens Powell, president of AFGE’s Council 238 which represents over 8,500 EPA employees across the country. “Seeing something that’s literally called ‘Fork in the Road’ was not what one would expect, whatsoever,” said Powell. The OPM has said it intends to shrink a majority of federal agencies through “restructurings, realignments, and reductions in force,” according to the offer notice. The memo also says federal workers should be “reliable, loyal, trustworthy” and that “performance standards will be updated to reward and promote those that exceed expectations.” “I don’t feel real good about this loyalty test that they’re pushing forward,” said Glover. The OPM did not respond to a request for comment on the loyalty language and new performance standards. » READ MORE:Who are the Philly region’s federal workers? A look at the employees impacted by Trump’s recent executive orders. A Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA) employee in Philadelphia, who has been a federal worker since 2016, was shocked by OPM’s resignation offer and wondered: “Is my job in jeopardy?” The nine-year federal worker thought she would retire as a federal employee, but has begun to rethink that. She thought government work offered job security, but is less certain now. “What does the future hold for me?” she said. “I don’t know, because it seemed like anything can happen within a week.” Another Philadelphia VBA worker, a five-year employee, said she found the memo’s language troubling. “Our jobs are uncertain because that email reads that you have to be performing at above the exceptional level,” she said. “That would be the norm — for everyone, and that is not realistic.” AFGE’s lawyers are looking into the legality of the offer, said Glover. While it offers to pay workers through September if they accept, federal government spending is currently fundedthrough March 14. OPM regulations typically only allow buyouts of up to $25,000 per person unless Congress makes an exception, noted Glover. The average federal worker makes$106,382 per year, according to OPM data, which is about $71,000 from now to September. Union leaders are skeptical of the offer — two, speaking with The Inquirer, called it a “scam.” The AFGE is urgingcaution to members consideringtheresignation. “There’s not yet any evidence the administration can or will uphold its end of the bargain, that Congress will go along with this unilateral massive restructuring, or that appropriated funds can be used this way, among other issues that have been raised,” an AFGE spokesperson said in a statement. The spokesperson said the union’s locals and councils maydemand to bargain over the program and could filegrievances or unfair labor practice charges alleging the federal government directly communicated with employees, bypassing the unions. Several federal agencies offer hybrid schedules — something workers (and their bosses) have gotten used to. Trump’s executive order mandating a return to full-time in-person work might not be physically possible, workers said. The Northeast Regional Office for the National Park Service, on Market Street in Philadelphia, can only hold about 60 employees, said Dave Fitzpatrick, secretary-treasurer of the AFGE Council 270 and a retired National Park Service maintenance employee in Philadelphia. The parks’ administrative workers would claim desks on a hoteling system that complemented their in-person schedules. “If you needed a desk for a couple of days, you would make a reservation, so now they’re telling all these folks to come back,” Fitzpatrick said. “There’s physically not enough room for them to fit into that space.” At the Philadelphia VBA: “I think we’re going to be squished like a can of sardines,” said the nine-year federal worker. And returning to the office full time could mean an added expense for those who will now need additional help to care for children or other family members, workers said. One Philly VA employee who has worked for the agency for more than 20 years said a flexible work-from-home schedule allowed them to attend medical appointments with their mom, who has been diagnosed with cancer. The employee themself also has a chronic illness, which was slightly easier to manage withtelework. Now, the VA employee said, “I’m gonna have to take a lot more time off in order to accommodate those necessary appointments.” But they want to keep their job, to continue “to help people” rather than “take an easy buyout and give up.” If employees do take the resignation offer, there is no expectation their roles would be filled again, said Powell, who represents EPA workers. “The work that they do would cease to be done,” said Powell. At the EPA that includes responding to emergencies, cleaning up toxic pollution, sampling water, and monitoring air. “When there’s nobody to call, there’s going to be a problem,” she said. “The people that are there to respond to these emergencies, to do these cleanups, to make sure your water is clean or your air is breathable and safe for you and your children are not going to be there.” Ittakes federal workers to process passports, keep airplanes flying, and national parks running, Glover notes. Brad Starnes, president of AFGE’s Local 3631, described OPM’s email as “a rather ominous communication.” Wednesday morning, he got a flood of phone calls and emails from union members he represents, which includes EPA employees in Pennsylvania and Delaware. Workers were “blindsided” and “shocked,” he said. “You cannot just pull people out of an organization that provides the breadth of services that we provide that are truly needed, and expect that … there will not be severe impacts on the American people,” said Starnes. “That’s what scares me. Nothing like this has ever happened. This is new ground.” Independence Hall relies on seasonal staff to keep up with tourists and crowds in the busy summer months, and with the hiring freeze and the “deferred resignation” program, individuals seeking to learn about Philadelphia and U.S. history may be sorely disappointed, said Fitzpatrick, the retired parks employee in Philadelphia. “I don’t know what the summer season is going to look like at Independence, but there’s going to be a lot of people standing outside trying to get on tours that just aren’t going to happen,” he said. The hunger for Philadelphia’s tourist attractions is likely to escalate next year with the celebration of the nation’s 250th anniversary, which city officials are already preparing for. Trump himselfhas called for an extraordinary celebrationin yet another executive order. For one longtime employee with the National Park Service, telling the story of the Declaration of Independence or the Constitution is not only a job — it’s personal. “We are dedicated employees in this park, more so than any park I have ever seen, and we take our jobs seriously because we know that sometimes this is it for these people,” the employee said. “This is the shot of what American history really is.”",

The plane ride home from Japan feels even longer after you lose your world title and taste defeat for the first time as a professional boxer. But it provided Stephen Fulton — the former super bantamweight champion from West Philadelphia — two years ago with the time to reflect. “Having everything and losing it all,” Fulton said, “makes you think about all the things you’ve done in your life and appreciate the things you’ve done and also appreciate yourself more and love yourself more. When I lost the title, I lost family, friends, those things. You have to regroup.” » READ MORE:Do you know these seven all-time Philly boxing greats? Take a look. Fulton was knocked out in Japan by Naoya Inoue in July 2023 and then knocked down a year later in his next fight against Carlos Castro. But he was not ready to fold. Fulton rallied, earned a decision against Castro, and righted his career. On Saturday night, Fulton (22-1, 8 knockouts) has a chance to become a champion again when he meets WBC featherweight champ Brandon Figueroa (25-1-1, 19 KOs) at the T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas. “I learned a lot about myself,” said the 30-year-old Fulton, whose fight is broadcast by Amazon Prime pay-per-view. “No matter what I go through, I feel like I can overcome it.” Figueroa’s only career loss is a decision to Fulton in November 2021. That fight made Fulton a unified champion at 122 pounds and gave him one of the signature wins of his career. Saturday is a rematch at a different weight class as this is Fulton’s second featherweight fight — he moved up to 125 pounds after losing to Inoue. Fulton is also training now with Bozy Ennis, the father of Jaron “Boots” Ennis. Ennis, Hamza Muhammad, and Wahid Rahim share Fulton’s corner. “It’s like the best of both worlds on my behalf,” Fulton said. “Bozy has a different style than maybe Hamza and Wahid might have. So when you combine their styles, it all works out at the end of the tunnel.” It would have been easy for Fulton to fold last September after he touched the canvas in the fifth round, just 14 months removed from a difficult loss. His career was at a crossroads as he returned to his corner. But he was urged to keep pushing, and he did. On Saturday night, Fulton can be champion again. “I might have been knocked down but I’m going to get back up, stay focused, and get the job done,” Fulton said. “People always face adversity in life. It’s all about how you react to it.” » READ MORE:Danny Garcia’s father fought back from a stroke to be in his corner",

Barkley, a member of the New York Giants at the time, harbored a bit of resentment toward the team that knocked his squad out of the playoffs in the divisional round. The star running back watched only part of the Super Bowl that year, as he was on a flight back from Phoenix after participating in the media frenzy that is radio row. “That stuff is fun,” Barkley said on Thursday. “Radio row and all of that. But I like this a little bit better.” » READ MORE:Eagles’ Brandon Graham returns to practice ahead of the Super Bowl as he recovers from triceps injury Next week, Barkley returns to the Super Bowl with a new allegiance and a different agenda. The 27-year-old running back — who will turn 28 on the day of the Super Bowl, Feb. 9 — will be a key part of an Eagles team on a quest to win its second Lombardi Trophy in the last eight seasons. Even though Barkley wasn’t a member of the group that lost to the Kansas City Chiefs in February 2023, he still feels the pain carried by some of his teammates who fell short of the ultimate goal at the time. “I think even though I wasn’t part of that team ... when you’re able to develop a friendship and a relationship with these guys and be able to go to war with each other, it felt like I was,” Barkley said. “I know how, like I wasn’t there, but I can feel in my own body how it felt for them and see the confetti fall in the wrong color and having to walk out. “Definitely don’t want to be part of that. That’s definitely something that drives us. For those guys that have been a part of it, but also just want to get the job done and knowing how it is for those guys, how it felt, and doing everything I can in my ... ability to make sure that doesn’t happen.” After a historic regular season and a dominant postseason, Barkley enters the week of the Super Bowl in rare company. According to the NFL’s Next Gen Stats, Barkley is one of three players all-time to have at least 400 rushing yards in the playoffs before playing in the Super Bowl, joining Hall of Fame running backs John Riggins and Terrell Davis. Both players went on to rush for more than 150 yards in the Super Bowl, and each won the game’s Most Valuable Player award. » READ MORE:The Chiefs are aware of a ‘fully loaded’ Eagles team ahead of Super Bowl LIX Davis set the single-season rushing record(including playoffs) in 1998 as a member of the Denver Broncos when he ran for a total of 2,476 yards. Barkley, sitting at 2,447, needs 30 rushing yards to break Davis’ record. Still, Barkley is more focused on the team’s bigger goal. “The only thing that makes it special, whether we got the rushing record during the season or if we get the all-time rushing record, playoffs included, the only thing that makes it special is winning a Super Bowl,” Barkley said. “This profession that we’re in, this sport that we’re in, there’s a lot of great things that we’ve accomplished so far up to this, but if we don’t get the job done next Sunday, maybe when you’re in your 30s and 40s and you look back at it, you’re going to think about how special it was. But it’s kind of going to make it feel ... like you came up short.” Barkley will make his first Super Bowl appearance in just his second postseason run of his seven-year NFL career. Upon signing his three-year, $37.75 million deal with the Eagles in March, Barkley had the mindset that his new team had the firepower to make it to the NFL’s biggest stage. “I didn’tthinkthat it was possible,” Barkley said. “I kind of knew. You’ve got to envision it. You’ve got to believe it. “Every year, no matter what, you have to come in with that mindset. Because we all have a chance to go out there and accomplish what we want to accomplish. I believed in it. I envisioned it.” Radio row has nothing on the opportunity ahead for Barkley at the Super Bowl this time around. After setting the franchise’s single-season rushing record in 2024, the running back is still hungry to accomplish more. “It’s a cool feeling when everything that you worked for, it’s all right in front of you,” Barkley said. “The player that I knew I was and the player that I believed I was is finally getting to show.” » READ MORE:Eagles linebacker Oren Burks finds himself in a key spot in a second straight Super Bowl",

        "source": "https://www.inquirer.com/",
        "content": "From a five-minute anthem written by Philly ad men to a short and memorable song created by fans, for fans. Other NFL teams have their own version of a fight song to rally their fans together for a big game — from the Buffalo Bills’ “Shout” to the Chicago Bears’ “Bear Down, Chicago Bears.” But let’s be honest, none compares to “Fly, Eagles Fly,” a song that fans have been hearing quite a lot of lately, with the team coming off a 14-3 season and preparing to compete inSuper BowlLIX. If you still don’t know the lyrics behind theEagles’ victory song, it’s time to start learning — it’s short and easy to remember. And if you don’t know the history behind the song that plays after every Birds’ touchdown, don’t worry. Here’s everything you need to know ahead of the Eagles’ Super Bowl rematch against the Chiefs … Before there was the short and sweet “Fly, Eagles Fly” fight song that we know today, there was anearly five-minute versionthat went “Fight, Eagles Fight,” which is still part of the revamped song fans sing today. The five-minute song was created in the 1950s by Philadelphia ad men Charles J. Borrelli and Roger Courtland. In the 1960s, the song was performed by the Eagles’ Sound of Brass, a 200-member marching band, before losing the approval of Eagles fans in the 1980s. In the 1990s, Eagles fan Bobby Mansure helped create the fight song that lives on today — “Fly, Eagles Fly” — by reworking the former 1950s version that the Eagles played before games at Connie Mack Stadium.Mansure met Brian Saunders, and the twoMummersformed a band known as The Fly Guys. It consisted of Mansure as the lead saxophone player, Saunders on the tenor sax, and Anthony DiMeo on the banjo. Together, the group would breathe new life into the future anthem of the Eagles. In 1996, the Eagles hired them to work the parking lots before games and help pump up the crowd. In search of an Eagles-themed song to play for fans, they came across the original version of “The Eagles Victory Song.” The guys decided to up the tempo and coined a new phrase, “Fly, Eagles Fly,” which wasn’t featured in the original song. Soon, they were infiltrating tailgates to teach fans the new fight song. “We handed out pieces of paper to every tailgate we went to,” Mansuretold the Inquirer’s Matt Breen last year. “We sold it to the parking lots. Instead of parading through, we stopped at tailgates and talked to people. We got phone numbers. We just connected with people and soon they were like, ‘Can you show up to our tailgate?’” Eventually, The Fly Guys — now the Eagles’ official pep band — and their revamped fight song became so popular that the team started playing it on the stadium speakers after each touchdown. That tradition continues today, and the song has also become part of the team’s pregame festivities before the national anthem. » READ MORE:Fly, Eagles Fly: How two Mummers gave Philadelphia an anthem In order to complete the song, the group decided to add a chant at the end, the now familiar “E-A-G-L-E-S, Eagles!” chant, which can be heard from the streets of Philadelphia toPhilly-themed sports bars in Tokyo.They invited friends into Saunders’ home studio to make it sound like a crowded stadium, and an anthem was born. “Before that, you were getting more of the ‘Give me an E, give me an A,’ that kind of thing,” Saunders told Breen. “It’s certainly not what it is now. When you have the right amount of syllables and the word ‘Eagles,’ things sometimes just fall together perfectly. Like it belonged there. There was no other way you could end the song. You had to have an ending.” Be sure to check out Breen’s full story on the origin of the fight song,here.

        "source": "https://www.inquirer.com/",
        "content": "The Philadelphia Skating Club said its community members were part of the deadly D.C. airline crash. It may be days before all the victims are identified, and perhaps weeks or months before the cause of the collision of an American Airlines plane and a U.S. Army helicopter is determined, but for now the only certainty for the region’s figure skating community is an enduring sense of “immense grief.” A number of passengers who were killed in Wednesday night’s tragic crash were part of that tight-knit community, including accomplished skaters, coaches, and family members. The Philadelphia Skating Club & Humane Society and the University of Delaware confirmed that several of the victims had local ties. Three of the victims identified so far were from Delaware. Officials on Thursday confirmed the inevitable: They had abandoned any hope of rescuing the victims in the chilly waters of the Potomac River, where the crash occurred about 9 p.m. Wednesday as the airliner was attempting to land at Reagan National Airport near Washington. The plane was carrying 60 passengers and four crew members. Three soldiers were aboard the helicopter that evidently flew into the plane’s path. As of Thursday night, 28 bodies had been recovered. Sen. Chris Coons (D., Del.) said Thursday night that three of the victims — Sasha Kirsanov, Sean Kay, and Angela Yang — were Delawareans. Kirsanov was a former coach of the University of Delaware Figure Skating Club. In a statement, university president Dennis Assanis said, “We believe two young skaters,” members of the university’s skating club, also were on board. The university did not identify them, but the skating clubposted enthusiastically on social medialast week about Kay and Yang’s forthcoming trip to Kansas — where the American Airlines flight originated — for a national development camp. Assanis said that Kirsanov, who lived in Newark, and the skaters trained at the university’s High Performance Training Center, which “has been the training home for many years of multiple world-class skating champions and competitors.” Kirsanov’s wife, Natalya Gudin, who is also a coach,told ABC News: “I lost everything. I lost my husband. I lost my students. I lost my friends.” She said she last spoke to her husband Wednesday afternoon ahead of the flight’s boarding. Gudin said she learned of the crash from the mother of a figure skater on the flight. “I need my husband back,” she said. “I need his body back.” Coons said on social media: “My heart goes out to Sasha’s wife Natalia [and] the University of Delaware Figure Skating Club.” In his statement, Assanis said: “The figure skating community is tight-knit, and many of our students and coaches have trained and competed alongside those who were lost.” Wichita, Kan., from where the flight departed before heading to Washington, hosted the U.S. Figure Skating Championship last week, along with a training camp that wrapped this week. “These athletes, coaches, and family members were returning home,” U.S. Figure Skatingsaidin a statement Thursday morning. “We are devastated by this unspeakable tragedy and hold the victims’ families closely in our hearts.” In Philadelphia, the skating club — the nation’s oldest — expressed “immense grief at the loss of so many talented skaters, their coaches and families.” The club had not disclosed the names of any local victims as of Thursday night. “Sadly, one of the families lost just became members of our club and another shared his talent with us at our recent 175th Anniversary Gala,” the group said. “We share this loss and grief with the entire USFS Community.” The statement continued: “We are devastated. … Our thoughts and prayers are with everyone during this tragic time.” The Skating Club of Boston said it was grieving the loss of two skaters, their mothers, and two coaches, theBoston Globereported. The coaches, Evgenia Shishkova and Vadim Naumov, were Russianworld champions and a married couple. They won the pairs figure skating event at the 1994 World Championship and had been living in the United States since 1988 after retiring from competitive skating, transitioning into coaching roles. The search for bodies was continuing Thursday night. The tragedyevoked memories of the February 1961 plane crashin which all 18 members of the U.S. world championship figure skating team and 54 other passengers were killed.",

        "title": "Fake ‘ICE Volunteer Corps’ truck stirs fear in Chester County immigrant community",
        "source": "https://www.inquirer.com/",
        "content": "In the Facebook group “¿Qué Pasa, Kennett Square?,” a member of that community posted photos of the vehicle on Jan. 24 with the warning in Spanish that it was “Not ICE.” As Pennsylvania’s immigrant community worries over deportations under the new Trump administration, a vehicle and its driver presenting as a member of “ICE Volunteer Corps” is stirring anxieties inChester County. There is, of course, no such thing as a volunteer division ofImmigrationCustoms and Enforcement, the federal agency the president has tasked to ramp up raids and deport millions of undocumented people in the opening weeks of his second term. But that didn’t stop the driverfrom brandishing the fraudulent ICE stickers on the side and back of a white Jeep this month, one spotted by residents in both West Chester and Kennett Square in recent days — the latter home to thousands of undocumented people who work in the region’s agricultural industry. West Chester University, in a statement sent to the campus community Monday, confirmed that the school had received complaints about the vehicle on its campus. The university confirmed its existence via photos and security footage. “Upon thorough review by the WCU Department of Public Safety, the reported vehicle is not believed to be an official government vehicle,” the statement said. Put more plainly: “We believe that the vehicle’s unofficial signage was meant to create confusion and concern,” the statement continued. Lindsey Sweet, an immigration attorney in Chester County, said she has heard multiple reports of people spotting the vehicle around Kennett Square, the nation’s mushroom-producing capital and home to a growing population of asylum-seeking migrants from countries such as Guatemala, Nicaragua, and Venezuela. According to Sweet, as well as photos viewed by The Inquirer, the vehicle is affixed with what appear to be police lights on top. Sweet said that in addition to the West Chester University sighting, the vehicle had been spotted parked outside aWawastore in the Kennett Square area. “There’s a lot of fear,” Sweet said. “[The Jeep] has really rattled the community, even though it’s a private citizen who has the sticker on their car. It’s caused a lot of fear — unnecessarily.” A spokesperson for ICE in Philadelphia said the agency does not have volunteers but did not return a subsequent request for a statement about the vehicle. An administrative member of the Kennett Square Police Department said that the department did not have knowledge of the vehicle. Meanwhile, members of the Latino community have been quick to take action to dispel fear and rumors. In the Facebook group “¿Qué Pasa, Kennett Square?,” a member of that community posted photos of the vehicle on Jan. 24 with the warning in Spanish that it was “Not ICE.” “We’ve sent the information to the police since it’s illegal what he’s doing,” the user wrote, according to Facebook’s Spanish-to-English translation. “If you see similar cars and you are not sure if they are really ICE, take a picture so you can investigate if they are actually ICE officers.” The post generated a flurry of comments and activity, as users claimed they, too, had spotted the vehicle at Acme, McDonald’s, and other Chester County locations. It is a federal crime to impersonate an ICE officer, and penalties can include fines and imprisonment. West Chester University said its officers were on heightened alert over the vehicle, though security footage did not yield a clear photo of the vehicle’s license plate number. For Sweet, one half of the law firm Sweet & Paciorek, the vehicle incident is just one element of the confusion that has swept her clientele since PresidentDonald Trump’s inauguration this month. Deportations of criminals happened regularly under the Biden administration, though Trump has vowed to ramp up enforcement and overhaul immigration policy to vastly limit the number of migrants in the country. ICE raided a North Philadelphia car washthis week, arresting seven immigrants. Nationally,military cargo planes are being used to fly migrants to Colombia and Border Patrol agents are turning away those who may have previously entered the country and applied for asylum. Sweet said that migrants she works with have varying immigration statuses, though many are asylum-seekers with work authorization who are waiting for immigration court hearings despite a backlog that has led to wait times of up to several years. A major fear among undocumented agricultural workers in Chester County, according to Sweet, is that the Trump administration willexpand its expedited removal policy, meaning those who have yet to have a court hearing could be subject to deportation as they wait to see a judge and make their case for asylum. “There’s a large group of people who are here who are relying on the fact that they’re going to have this court hearing and haven’t done anything about their case yet,” said Sweet, who spent a marathon week advising both nonprofits and individuals about the rights immigrants have during an ICE encounter. “If that court date goes away and they’re now being removed from the United States,” Sweet said, “they’re not prepared for that.”",

        "source": "https://www.inquirer.com/",
        "content": "Lawmakers in the state Senate are poised to approve judicial vacancies in 10 counties next week. Philadelphia — which has the most open judicial seats of any county — isn't one of them. Less than a month into the new year, a routine process is causing a squabble in Harrisburg, with some Philadelphia officials expressing frustration over a slate of judges who are set to be appointed next week. The dustup comes after a bipartisan group of lawmakers struck a deal to fill vacancies on courts across 10 Pennsylvania counties. But Philadelphia — which has the largest court system in the state, and where nine judicial seats are empty — isn’t one of them. Several members of Philadelphia’s delegation to Harrisburg are concerned the city was left out of the deal, and the city’s bar association says long vacancies in the Common Pleas Court have had a cascading effect on a stressed system. Seven of the court’s nine open judicial seats have been empty for more than a year. State Sen. Anthony Hardy Williams, a West Philadelphia Democrat who has served in Harrisburg for more than 35 years, said Philadelphia’s exclusion from the slate of appointments sets a precedent that reduces the city’s influence in Harrisburg. He said legislative leaders advanced the slate without input from Philadelphia’s senators. “This was a deal struck without the members of the Philadelphia delegation saying they’re OK with it,” Williams said. “This is an absolute dilution of our Philadelphia delegation’s power. … For us to not be included is an insult.” Other lawmakers said there’s nothing out of the ordinary. The Senate considers slates of judicial appointees on a rolling basis. For example, the state Senate confirmed 10 judges in 2023, five of whom were in Philadelphia. No judges were appointed last year. A spokesperson for Senate Minority Leader Jay Costa (D., Allegheny) declined to comment. State Sen. Nikil Saval, a Democrat who chairs the Philadelphia delegation, said he is hopeful the city’s vacancies will be filled in a future appointment package. Judicial vacancies are nothing new, as judges retire or are appointed to higher courts. To fill open seats outside of election season, Pennsylvania Democratic and Republican leaders typically work with the governor’s office to advance a slate that satisfies both parties. The governor appoints nominees to fill judicial and county row-officevacancies, who then must be approved by a two-thirds vote in the Senate, requiring bipartisan cooperation.(Magisterial district court judges outside Philadelphia require only a majority vote.) An appointed judge fills the remainder of a predecessor’s 10-year term or serves until after the next municipal election, whichever is shorter. In Philadelphia, they make at least $228,400 per year. » READ MORE:Justice delayed: Philly courts’ backlog leaves many jailed for months without a hearing Philadelphia’s Common Pleas Court has the highest number of judicial vacancies of any court system in the state. The court — which is a trial-level court that handles serious crimes,cases involving children and families, and appeals from lower courts — should have 93 judges, but has been operating for months with 84. The Philadelphia Bar Association, which has repeatedly called for lawmakers in Harrisburg to fill the vacancies, said in a statement that additional judges are needed “immediately” to relieve overcrowded schedules. “We simply cannot afford to wait any longer,” said Katayun Jaffari, the chancellor of the Philadelphia Bar Association. “We, again, urge our leaders in Harrisburg and Philadelphia to rise above political concerns and work collaboratively to fill these vacancies.” There are judicial vacancies in other counties, but no other Pennsylvania trial court is as understaffed as Philadelphia’s Common Pleas Court. Allegheny County is down six judges, but the package of appointments legislators are set to consider next weekwould fill three of those seats. Every other county in the state has three or fewer judicial vacancies, according to a list provided by a spokesperson for the state courts system. For Williams, excluding Philadelphia from any deal to fill judicial vacancies is a matter of reducing the city’s influence. He said he expressed his “extreme frustration” to Costa, who told him that Philadelphia was not included in the package because the delegation was not unified behind its nominees to fill the seats. Williams said the discord may have come down to one nominee: Larry Farnese, a former state senator now vying for a judgeship in Philadelphia. Some caucus members expressed discomfort with Farnese’snomination — shades of 2023, when sources saida long-simmering feud with another Philadelphiastate senatortanked Farnese’s chances of being appointedfrom a short list of nominees. Farnese did not respond to a request for comment Thursday. » READ MORE:Philly Democrats’ process of picking ‘magic seat’ judges involved mischief and vengeance this year Despite the internal strife, Williams said the delegation had coalesced around its judicial nominees — including Farnese. He said the group learned the city was left out of the appointment package and submitted a letter to Costa saying its members were in agreement, but by then it was too late, and a deal had already been struck. “This is not just about one judge,” Williams said. “This is about a process and precedent within the caucus. … I’m sounding an alarm because others need to understand if this precedent is established, that means we will go forward with this being normal. And it’s not.”",

As they would later discover, the Kutztown University sophomore had fallen victim to an online sexual-extortion scam by a Nigerian group known as the “Yahoo Boys.” Communicating via Snapchat and Instagram, members of the group posed as a young woman, solicited intimate photos of Sullivan, and then threatened to release them if he didn’t continually send them funds. Sullivan’s death was ruled first a suicide, then a homicide once details of the events leading up to it became clear.

Reporter Abraham Gutman digs into the ongoing debate over the harms of social media use and a Montco family’s quest to keep other young people safe. The Philadelphia region is home to tens of thousands of federal workers in fields ranging from veterans benefits to the National Park Service. On Tuesday, those workers and others across the country received a memo from President Donald Trump’s administration offering them eight months’ pay if they resign by Feb. 6. The directive is part of an effort by the White House to downsize the federal workforce in the name of government efficiency, as well as to ensure employees are “reliable, loyal, trustworthy,” according to the memo. It’s also causing fear that essential services won’t be deployed. “You cannot just pull people out of an organization that provides the breadth of services that we provide that are truly needed, and expect that … there will not be severe impacts on the American people,” a local union rep told The Inquirer.

        "content": "Senate Majority Leader Joe Pittman (R., Indiana) said in an interview earlier this month that Senate Republicans still have reservations about legalizing recreational marijuana. HARRISBURG — Gov.Josh Shapirowill againpitch in his annual budget address next week that Pennsylvania should legalize recreational marijuana andtap into tax revenuelike almost all of its neighboring states. But legalizing recreational marijuana still faces major hurdles in Pennsylvania, where the GOP-controlled state Senate is not sold on the idea. Senate Majority Leader Joe Pittman (R., Indiana) said in an interview earlier this month that SenateRepublicansstill have logistic reservations about marijuana’s federal classification as a Schedule I drug alongside heroin, as well as whether state government could support a recreational program. “It’s a practicality issue more than a philosophical issue,” Pittman said. Meanwhile,Democratslike Shapiro and House Majority Leader Matt Bradford (D., Montgomery) say regulating the adult-use cannabis industry is a no-brainer, when all surrounding states — except West Virginia — are already profiting off Pennsylvanians crossing state lines. “Frankly, we’re losing all kinds of revenue to other states,” Shapiro said in an interview earlier this month. Shapiro proposed a 20% tax on legal marijuana as part of his budget address last year (and the year before). In his 2024 budget pitch, his administration estimated that an adult-use cannabis industry in the statecould bring in $14.8 million in tax revenue in its first yearand would be regulated by the Department of Agriculture. That estimate increased to $76 million in its second year, $160 million in its third, and $230 million in its fourth. Still, some Pennsylvania Republicans seem more open to the cannabis industry after surrounding states,including Ohio, a GOP stronghold, legalized it. And Pennsylvania will need new revenue generators tohelp fill a $4.5 billion budget shortfallas spending is set to outpace revenue beginning this fiscal year and is expected to grow in the coming ones — perhaps increasing lawmakers’ interest in taxing marijuana. » READ MORE:Gov. Josh Shapiro says he ‘got stuff done’ in his first two years. With a budget shortfall on the horizon, his biggest challenges are to come. State Sens. Dan Laughlin (R., Erie) and Sharif Street (D., Philadelphia) introduced a sweeping, bipartisan bill in the last legislative session to legalize and regulate adult-use marijuana. The bill would have set a minimum purchase and use age requirement of 21 years old, created a regulatory board and a cannabis business development fund, strengthened driving-under-the-influence laws for marijuana use, and more. But the bill never came up for a vote. Laughlin has moved into a new leadership role as chairman of the Senate Law and Justice Committee, where a recreational marijuana bill would likely be assigned as the first step of the legislative process. Similar marijuana legalization legislation was introduced in the Democratic-controlled House last session, but it also did not get a vote. But Pittman, the leader of Senate Republicans, still doubts there is widespread support for legalizing recreational marijuana among his caucus — in part, he said, because of the way Pennsylvania implemented its medical marijuana program under former Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf. Pennsylvania legalized medical marijuana in 2016, with dispensaries opening around the state in 2018. But that process was fraught with issues, from weak oversight to unfair application of the law and more. A Spotlight PA investigationfound that a small number of Pennsylvania doctorsapprove most of the state’s medical marijuana cards, among other issues. “Obviously, this state has not done well in rolling out medical marijuana,” Pittman said. “We’ve not demonstrated our ability to have the bureaucracy manage something of that magnitude.” Both Pittman and Bradford said the other chamber should send them a bill to consider. However, Bradford was more confident that his narrow Democratic majority would be able to pass a measure legalizing recreational marijuana, in light of the lack of broad support in the GOP-controlled Senate. “It strikes me as abdicating our responsibility to protect our communities and our children, and at the same time, we are losing revenue that is going to go into our neighboring states,” Bradford said. “Yes, our numbers are close, but we are confident that we can get our numbers together and show that there is a path forward on cannabis.” Dave Sunday, Pennsylvania’s new Republican attorney general, has said he opposes the legalization of adult-use cannabis butsaid that if it is legalized,he would follow state law.",

        "content": "When tight end Chad Lewis went down with an injury during the magical 2004-05 season, Thomason, who played three seasons with the Eagles, got a call he'd never forget. Jeff Thomason was in a work trailer in South Jersey 20 years ago ready to start another Monday morning on a construction site of a new housing development. His phone rang. It was Tom Melvin, anEaglesassistant coach. Thomason played three seasons with the Birds before trading in his helmet for a hard hat. He watched from home the previous night as the Eagles won the NFC title and finally broke through to the Super Bowl. Thomason figured his old coach was calling to thank him for his contributions in prior seasons. Nope. Melvin wanted Thomason to come to South Philly and try out for the Eagles. Chad Lewis, the team’s starting tight end and Thomason’s buddy, broke his foot the night before, catching a touchdown in the team’s 27-10 victory over the Atlanta Falcons. The Birds needed a replacement for the Super Bowl so they called Thomason, then an assistant project manager with Toll Brothers. » READ MORE:Saquon Barkley envisioned being in a position to win a Super Bowl long before wearing Eagles green “It was shocking,” Thomason said. “I kind of thought they were joking with me. Never did I think they would bring me back to play in the game.” Thomason was in. He had retired two years earlier but still missed the game. Of course he would play in the Super Bowl. First, he had to ask his boss. “I was like ‘I’m going to use my two weeks’ vacation, all right?’ He’s like ‘What?’” Thomason said. Thomason aced his tryout and flew to Jacksonville, Fla., in January 2005 with the Eagles. He played tight end and helped on special teams in the Super Bowl moonlighting as a football player on the biggest stage. The Eagles lost to the Patriots, 24-21. It was back to work for Thomason. “It’s a story that needs to be told on TV someday,” said  Thomason, 55 who today lives near Dallas and works in sales. “I didn’t think there was a chance in the world that this guy was ever going to play football again.” Thomason joined the Eagles in 2000, and his first catch with his new team was the touchdown on the opening drive of the Pickle Juice Game, the stunner in Dallas wherethe Andy Reid Era truly took off. Years earlier, Reid rejuvenated Thomason’s career after Green Bay cut him before the 1994 season. Thomason, figuring that football was over, took a job selling shower heads. Reid, then the Packers’ tight ends coach, called and told him to stay in shape,because   the Packers might need him again. Reid called again a year later, and Green Bay signed Thomason. » READ MORE:Moro Ojomo gave ‘Inner Excellence’ to A.J. Brown. The lesser-known Eagle has his own motivational story. “He truly, truly cares about everyone he’s around, so he’s the guy you want to run through a wall for,” Thomason said of Reid,  the Kansas City Chief coach, who opposes the Birds in Super Bowl LIX on Feb. 6. “I could call Andy tomorrow and he’ll pick his phone up and ask how my wife is. He’s just as authentic, as caring, and as real as I’ve ever seen. Everything I do in life, I try to implement that same approach. It makes it real.” Thomason spent a decade in the NFL as a trusty blocker and dependable special teamer who caught 10 touchdowns, all of which ended with him spiking the football and throwing out his arms to make a “T.” “Lord knows I can’t do anything else but stand around. I can’t dance, that’s for sure,” Thomason said. “It had to be something stationary. It had to be something simple. My brother, a long time ago, used to throw the ‘T’ out there, so I did it. The first time I did it, it was more of a ‘Y’ because I was so excited. I slowly got it to ‘T.’” Thomason’s contract with the Eagles ended after the 2002 season, and interest around the league in him was tepid. He accomplished his goal to play 10 seasons, so Thomason walked away after the crushing loss to Tampa Bay in the NFC championship game. » READ MORE:Saquon Barkley took his high school records but gave him a hard-to-top icebreaker He   long had an interest in construction and used some connections to get an entry-level job with Toll Brothers, the home builders based in Fort Washington. Thomason spent six months in the audit department before moving to the trailer, where he made $37,000 and reported to a 25-year-old boss. “It’s hard to walk away from the game,” Thomason said. “It’s your whole life. It’s your whole identity. It’s the only thing I had done since I was 8 years old. You’re really never at peace with it. It’s hard, man. It’s hard to get rid of it. “I knew I could still play but my time in the NFL — it’s Not For Long, obviously — came to an end. But I was never ready to walk away from that. I can tell you that.” Thomason had been away from the team for two seasons, but most of the coaches were the same, the playbook was still fresh in his mind, and the roster was familiar. Thomason had completed triathlons during his retirement and trained in  jujitsu. He was in shape. Everything was in place for him to go from the work site to the Super Bowl. “I just had to make sure my body could move around,” Thomason said. Thomason played in two Super Bowls with the Packers, in the 1996 and 1997 seasons, but his trip with Philly was the first time he had a podium on media day. Thomason spent his career as a backup tight end. For a week, he was the star. Thomason was national news, the feel-good story of the Super Bowl. He was featured onGood Morning America,60 Minutes, and nearly every nightly news broadcast. » READ MORE:Eagles’ Brandon Graham returns to practice ahead of the Super Bowl as he recovers from triceps injury It was special. Thomason made sure to take it all in, knowing this would be his final game. He thought his career ended two years earlier, but instead he got one more night. “The Super Bowl is the greatest thing in the world,” Thomason said. “That opening kickoff, there’s nothing like it with all the flashing lights. I’m so lucky. It was such a blessing. I wish I could’ve helped them win.” The owner of Toll Brothers caught enough grief for making Thomason use his two-week vacation that he announced that any employee who  plays in the Super Bowl, World Series, NBA Finals, or Stanley Cup Finalswould receive an additional two weeks of vacation. Thomason was at ease. Now, he could just play. “It was such a gift,” Thomason said. “I’m so grateful to Andy. I’m so grateful to Tom Melvin. I’m so grateful to the Philadelphia Eagles for giving me that chance. I sat there on that field. It was a loss, and I felt sick to my stomach. But sitting there selfishly and looking at the grass, knowing I’m never going to see that grass again like that. Wearing cleats, shoulder pads, and a helmet. It was pretty crazy.” ",

Whether they ultimately achieve that goal remains to be seen.

        "content": "A year after drafting corner Quinyon Mitchell in the first round, the Eagles could tap into Nick Sirianni's connections at Toledo one again. MOBILE, Ala. — A year ago, the Eagles made an initial connection withQuinyon Mitchellat the Senior Bowland the cornerback went on to be their first-round pick in the 2024 NFL draft. Now, a year later, could the Eagles select another defensive player from Toledo in the early rounds this year? Defensive lineman Darius Alexander, the Rockets’ standout player at this year’s Senior Bowl, was difficult to block all week for opposing offensive linemen. At 6-foot-3 and 304 pounds, according to Senior Bowl measurements, Alexander has an explosive first step and strong hand usage to disengage run blocks. In addition to taking snaps as an interior defensive lineman, Alexander showcased an ability to rush the passer as an outside defensive end. One of his best reps of the week came on Thursday during the 11-on-11 team session, beating Oregon left tackle Josh Conerly, one of theearly week standouts, with a double-hand swipe-and-swim move to get into the backfield with what would have been a sack in a live-game situation. » READ MORE:Eagles draft: LSU tight end Mason Taylor could intrigue the Birds after strong Senior Bowl practices “I just see myself as an underdog,” Alexander said after practice. “I just come here, put my head down, and get ready to go to work. I spent time working on my game [and] also getting in the film. … My D-line coach, Frank Okam, he prepared me for moments like this, too.” Toledo coach Jason Candle and Eagles coachNick Sirianniwere teammates and roommates at Division III university Mount Union, and Sirianni coached with current Toledo defensive coordinator Vince Kehres at Mount Union as well. The connections to Siranni’s past surely played a part in the Eagles drafting Mitchell last year and could play a part this year, too, with Alexander. Alexander, from FortWayne, Ind., finished his final college season with 7½ tackles for loss, 3½ sacks, and an interception returned for a touchdown in Toledo’s bowl game victory over Pittsburgh. Alexander says he has been talking to Mitchell “all day, every week” and says playing  with Mitchell on the Eagles “would be great.” “We got great coaches, great staff, great people on campus and then throughout the city of Ohio that motivate us to push us to be great,” Alexander said. “And we just want to come out here and show them that [Toledo] got players that could come out here and compete with the best.” ThoughJalen CarterandJordan Davishave played at a high level, the Eagles could lose defensive tackle Milton Williams to free agency this offseason and could be in the market to add  a player to that mix. The Toledo standout will be in demand this week. After practice, Pittsburgh Steelers assistant general manager Andy Weidl, who previously worked with the Eagles, introduced himself to Alexander and has another meeting planned with him. The Eagles have also met with Alexander this week. » READ MORE:Eagles draft: Offensive tackles Josh Conerly and Emery Jones showcase their potential on Day 1 at the Senior Bowl Alexander is expected to be a Day 2  draft selection, and his performance this week not only strengthened his stock but proved that he can be an every-down player at three-technique, which would replace Williams’ role seamlessly. No one may have made themselves more money this week than Texas A&M edge rusher Shemar Stewart, whose explosiveness at 6-5, 281 pounds, per Senior Bowl measurements, is unmatched by any player who competed at the Senior Bowl. Stewart’s production with the Aggies has been underwhelming (4½ sacks in three seasons), but his traits were on full display during practice this week. Though the Miami native opted not to practice on Day 3 of the Senior Bowl, nor play in the game on Saturday, his best rep came during Wednesday’s session for the American team. On the play, Stewart turned the corner on LSU’s Emery Jones before he could lay a finger on him, then knocked the ball out of Mississippi quarterback Jaxson Dart’s hand. “I’ve been tall, big, all my whole, my whole life, and [living in] South Florida, you had to learn how to move with the best of them. So I feel like that’s where I got my movement skills from,” Stewart said. “During the offseason, I just go and work on seeing the hands. … While I was training with coach Nathan O’Neal, I was working on just seeing the hands, getting my accuracy on hitting hands better.” The other player who generated plenty of buzz this week was Marshall’s Mike Green, a  small-school pass rusher who proved he could back up the production he put out on tape. Green, who finished with 22½ tackles for loss and 17 sacks in a breakout redshirt sophomore season, produced a viral clip on Wednesday when he barreled over Oregon’s Conerly during a one-on-one pass-rushing session. The  native of Williamsburg, Va.,   opted out of Thursday’s practice, like Stewart, but displayed his upside as a run defender this week as well. Green entered the week in the first-round discussion and will leave the week firmly in that range. Though he may not last until the Eagles’ pick late in the first round, Green should be on their radar with Josh Sweat potentially departing in the offseason.",

The property:A 30-acre stretch of land at 5000 Flat Rock Road Former plans:Former Dallas Cowboys star Emmitt Smith once planned to develop the site and add labs, offices, and homes. The current owner:Manayunk Renaissance LLC, a subsidiary of a South Jersey-based construction company, bought the property in 2021 for $23 million. The construction company has worked on big projects in the region, including the Manayunk Bridge trail and park. But it hasn’t said publicly what it ultimately plans to do with its Venice Island property. The president of a neighborhood group said he thinks it’s “inevitable” that future plans for the large undeveloped property on the island will include a large residential development. Keep reading to learn more about just what Venice Island is, how homes came to be allowed there, andwhat could happen on it next. We often hear that homes in and around Philly are affordable. But of course, that’s relative. They’re affordablecompared to other places. I’ve written about how a lot of homebuyers in our areacan’t comfortably afford the homes for sale. Well, apartment renters are in the same boat. A new Redfin analysis found that, actually, the Philadelphia metro area is one of the least affordable major metros for its renters, based on their incomes. The online real estate brokerage looked specifically at renters living in apartment buildings with five or more units. There’s been a lot of apartment construction across the country and in Philly, which helps to tame rent growth. Still, the typical renter household in the Philly area makes $15,630 less than they need to comfortably afford the typical apartment that was listed for rent last month. Keep reading to see where the Philly region ranks among major metros in rental affordability for residents andhow much renters here need to make to afford apartments. Philly lawmakers will consider two bills that wouldreduce upfront costs for renters. A man who got in trouble for replacing native plants around his Avalon home with sodhas signed a plea agreement.

A couple weekends ago, I found myself sitting sweaty on my dirt-covered living room floor after wrestling my spider plant out of its too-small pot and transferring it to a bigger one. I’d known for a while that the plant needed a bigger home, but I kept putting it off. I waited too long, and now I keep having to pull brown leaves off it.

Her century-old, colonial revival home in Elkins Park is filled with succulents, ferns, roses, sunflowers, and more. And that’s just inside.

The executive order directs agencies to cease grants and other funding that could be used for hormone therapy, puberty blockers, or surgeries for transgender children. It also directs the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to review the terms of publicly funded coverage under Medicare, Medicaid, and the Affordable Care Act to curtail gender-affirming care. The order, widely expected to be challenged in court, could prevent those recipients from being able to receive the treatments and have a chilling effect on providers willing to offer gender-affirming care, doctors and legal experts said. “Obviously, going into Trump’s presidency we all knew what his agenda was,” said Hiester, who lives in West Chester. “I wasn’t shocked but the worst is he raised the age to 19, so I have another year to worry about this. I’m a senior. I’m committed to college. I should be enjoying every single moment but now, first with the election and now this, it’s really hard to focus on the good things.” Hiester has private health insurance and believes that for now, he will still have access to his hormone therapy, but he and others in the transgender community are concerned about a cascading effect that could threaten access, depending on how the order is interpreted. And the larger impact, Hiester and others have stressed, is the mental and emotional toll as Trump’s directives pile up. One of Trump’s most vocal promises on the campaign trail was to end gender-affirming care. On his first day in the White House,he declared his administration would recognize only two genders. And a slew of executive orders have targeted transgender people, including a directive thatthe military adopt a policy that being transgender is incompatiblewith “high standards for troop readiness,” and an order dropped Thursday banning “radical gender ideology,” in schools. The order about minor care, titled “Protecting Children From Chemical and Surgical Mutilation,” describes widely medically approved transgender care in inflammatory and misleading language, claiming children are being “maimed” and “sterilized.” While the order suggests this medical treatment is routine,very few minors undergo surgery to affirm genderand a small percentage of the adolescent population seeks gender therapies. Gender-affirming care for children and adolescents has been deemed medically appropriate by the American Academy of Pediatrics and other major medical and mental health organizations. Research shows young people with gender dysphoriasuffer higher ratesof suicide, self-harm, depression, and anxiety. Gender-affirming carebroadly refers tomedical services intended for people whose gender identity does not match the gender they were assigned at birth. Care could range from voice coaching and hair removal to hormone therapy and surgery. Trump’s order specifically applies to chemical (such as hormonal treatments) and surgical therapies. Conservative lawmakers’ defense of gender-affirming care bans often argue some therapies are irreversible and could come with side effects such as the risk of fertility loss. But researchers and medical professionals saymore research needs to be done to confirm the accuracy of any side effects, and LGBTQ advocates note that de-transitioning is extremely rare. “His order has the potential of making gender-affirming care very difficult, if not impossible, to get even for adults and more specifically for adults who are financially or otherwise already underserved and already marginalized,” said Shanin Gross, a family medicine doctor in South Jersey who specializes in gender-affirming care. In Pennsylvania and New Jersey, clinics, hospitals, and organizations that serve transgenderand nonbinary people urged calm. The action is likely to face challenges while they aretrying to sort out what its implementation could mean for their work. A primary concern is that medical institutions that receive federal funding for research or education grants that also provide care to transgender youth could lose funding. Gross, a 55-year-old doctor fromCherry Hill, worries that the order’s restrictions on Medicaid and Medicare could discourage doctors from providing gender-related care through these government-funded programs providing health coverage for low-income children and families, people with disabilities, and seniors. Gross also fearsthe order could trigger sanctions that would prevent a doctor from participating in Medicaid or Medicare. “I think that the goal behind the whole executive order and the intentionally broad and vague way it is written is to frighten as many health systems and individual providers as possible into thinking that they will lose funding or otherwise be unable to conduct business,” Gross said. “And the implication of the government officials with no medical training controlling what medical treatments we are allowed to have is terrifying and something we all should want to avoid.” The order could further restrict access to treatments that can already be difficult to get for minors in the U.S. Twenty-six states have restricted youth access to gender-affirming care, which remains legal in Pennsylvania and New Jersey. “Clearly the intent of the executive order is to create a climate of fear and anxiety that will result in care deprivation,” said Harper Seldin, an attorney with the ACLU. Sultan Shakir, president and executive officer of the Mazzoni Center — Philadelphia’s biggest LGBTQ health agency — denounced the action, stressing that “transgender people of all ages” are “entitled to the care and opportunities that others take for granted to live lives recognized as their full selves.” TheCenter Citynonprofit provides medical care for transgender individuals including hormone therapy. The Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia runs one of the nation’s largest clinics providing medical care and mental health support for transgender and gender nonbinary children and teens and their families. The hospital’sGender & Sexuality Development Programwas founded in 2014. In 2021, more than 800 new families sought care — a record surge from the prior year when between 250 to 350 families received services,according to CHOP. Trump’s order directs the head of HHS to take all appropriate steps to end gender-affirming care, including scrutinizing Medicare or Medicaid “conditions of participation or conditions for coverage” and “clinical abuse or inappropriate use” of state Medicaid programs. It’s not clear what the impact on CHOP could be. CHOP said in a statement Thursday that its “top priority is always the safety and well-being of the patient families we treat, ensuring that each child has a chance for a healthy future, while complying with applicable laws and directives. We look forward to continuing to work closely with our partners in government to make sure that the needs of children and their families come first.” For several transgender individuals and their parents interviewed, the worry is that therapies and support groups they depend on could shutter. Joanne, 52, of Center City, is concerned that her daughter, who has been on a two-year waitlist for surgery, could have to wait even longer. The Inquirer isn’t printing Joanne’s last name to protect her daughter, who she fears will face public backlash. The mother said she’s looked into surgery in Thailand but worries about the language barrier. As her daughter starts looking at schools, she’s urged her to apply to universities in Canada. “I’m at the point where I don’t think we can beat them anymore so I don’t know how much I can try, and I’m certainly not going to join them, so the third option is to run away,” she said. Gender-affirming care is expensive, something parents who’ve gone through the process worried about this week. Dawn Bowman, whose 20-year-old son is transgender, said her family sold a life insurance policy to help pay for therapies when he was in his teens. “At a point, I realized this is a life or death thing,” she said. “What really gets lost in this discussion is that when these kids go through the wrong puberty, they self-harm. It’s OK to not understand things but to demonize people because you don’t understand them, and say they’re you’re to help them, you’re actually hurting them.” As Trump ends just his second week in office, Hiester is trying to focus on school, playing tennis, and his job as a lifeguard. In the fall, he’ll head to college in Washington, D.C., where he wants to study education to become a high school teacher. He’s inspired by teachers who supported him over a tough last four years. “The larger impact of all this, is just how much hatred there is…that can have such an effect on, especially, younger trans people,” Hiester said. “People who are just trying to live their lives and be a kid.” Staff writer Harold Brubaker contributed to this article.",

        "content": "Ahead of the March launch of Smith's first album in 20 years, 'Based on a True Story,' the actor is 'flying as an Eagle, fresh out of Philly.' Big Willie is back on the scene. Oscar-winning actor Will Smith is releasing his first album in two decades,Based on a True Story, in March. His latest track, “Beautiful Scars,” proves the Fresh Prince still has it. The West Philly native, 56, weaves in an Eagles tribute on the OmArr and LeXoskleteon-produced track. “Fly as an Eagle, fresh out of Philly. Yeah, I still rep the city. Mirrors on the wall, worth half a billi,” Smith raps in a video he posted on social media on Tuesday. “Beautiful Scars” explores the perils of fame, the journey of self-acceptance, and the lessons learned through hardship. The song is accompanied by a music video inspired by the Keanu Reeves sci-fi classic,The Matrix. The video starts off with scenes from a2019 video, where Smith described his regretful decision to pass on the role of Neo to play Captain James West in the box office flop,Wild Wild West. “It’s one of those stories I’m not proud of, but it’s the truth. I did turn down Neo inThe Matrix. I’m not proud of it.” With rapper Big Sean playing a Morpheus-like role, he asks Smith to make the ultimate decision: blue pill or red pill. “Blue pill, everything remains the same and you get to move on with your life. Red pill, you get to go back and star in that movie that got away. The choice is yours,” he raps. “I really like my life right now,” Smith replies. Caught between the two options, Smith opts to live on in this AI-run world, maintaining the life he’s led with no regrets — Chris Rock slap and all. The rest of the video, directed by Adil El Arbi and Bilall Fallah (Bad Boys: Ride of Die), switches between re-imagined scenes from the film, and behind-the-scenes footage of the music video. The six-minute video closes with a cryptic message from the simulation: “Wake up, Will. The matrix has you.” Through it all, Smith has remained loyal to Philly sports. At the 40th Grammy Awards, he accepted hisBest Rap Solo Performance awardfor “Men in Black” wearing a Phillies cap and jersey. More recently, ahead of the Eagles’ Week 13 matchup against the Baltimore Ravens, he posted a video reaffirming his family’s fandom. A post shared by Will Smith (@willsmith) “This is a sensitive situation for our family, and we goin’ keep it real simple today,” Smith said as he panned the camera to a small group. “The first thing we want to know is, ‘Where’s Philly at?’.” The caption for the video, which the Eagles team later reposted, included the very fight song Smith referenced on his new track. “On game day, it’s FLY EAGLES FLY in this household 🦅😂🦅. Philly vs Bmore today!!,” Smith wrote.",

        "content": "Before dating Travis Kelce, the Berks County native was an Eagles fan. Now, she’s a Chiefs fan — and that likely isn’t changing before the Super Bowl. Taylor Swiftis now the world’s most famous Chiefs fan, thanks to her high-profile relationship with tight end Travis Kelce. But before she became a staple at Arrowhead Stadium, Swift was a Birds fan from Berks County. Swift and Kelce’s storybegan in 2023after Kelce attended her Eras Tour show at Arrowhead Stadium,armed with a friendship braceletwith his phone number on it — that he didn’t get to give her because “she doesn’t meet people before or after her shows.” There’s photo evidence of her meeting Aaron Rodgers after one of her shows at MetLife Stadium, so that’s notquitetrue. And onNew Heights,Jason Kelcespeculated Swift rebuffed him because the Chiefs had just beaten the Eagles in theSuper Bowl. ”She probably just hasn’t gotten over the Super Bowl yet,” Jason said. “She’s a big Eagles fan.” Despite her fandom, the relationship continued to grow withsurprise appearances at Chiefs games,Kelce family vacations, and even Travisappearing on stage at one of her shows. But at some point, that fandom changed. » READ MORE:From Bradley Cooper to Taylor Swift: Who has the better Super Bowl fan base? A totally unbiased (not really) take. At an earlier tour stop at Lincoln Financial Field, Swift confirmed she was a Birds fan and had included a reference to the team in her song “Gold Rush” — “Eagles T-shirt hanging from the door.” “There was sort of a — I don’t know how large the debate was — the debate about I have a lyric that says, ‘my Eagles T-shirt hanging from the door,’” Swiftsaid of the song while performing the Eras Tourat Lincoln Financial Field. “I saw some people wondering if it was the band, the Eagles, or the team, the Eagles. Guys, come on. I’m from Philly, of course it’s the team.” She was spotted entering her New York recording studio, Electric Lady Studios, in an Eagles crew neck in 2023, so the Birds fandom is recent. At least until her relationship with Kelce began later that year. Swift also met Andy Reid years prior, when he was still with the Eagles. “Yeah, listen, she’s been great. I knew her before, from Philadelphia. Her dad played at [the University of] Delaware and was a big football fan and good guy,” Reidsaid on theLet’s Gopodcast in 2024. “So I had met him there and her. … That was the last thing Trav wanted to hear, that I knew her before him.

        "content": "Burks was called into action for the 49ers in Super Bowl LVIII when Dre Greenlaw went down with an injury. This time Burks is filling in for Nakobe Dean. The next-man-up mentality is part of the ethos of the sport. For Oren Burks, it is more than just part of football, it is pretty much his entire seven-year NFL career. Burks has never been a full-time starter. He’s a special teams ace, a leader in the locker room, and a hole filler whose number only gets called when someone else goes down. From special teamer to starting in theSuper Bowl, it’s been an interesting first season with the Eagles for the 29-year-old linebacker, but it’s not an entirely new experience. Rewind to last February, when Burks was the third linebacker with the San Francisco 49ers. He played 34% of the defensive snaps during the regular season, by far the most in his career. He played 20 snaps in San Francisco’s first playoff game and 16 in a conference championship victory over the Detroit Lions. He was going to have a similar role in the Super Bowl, but then Dre Greenlaw suffered a freak Achilles injury running onto the field in the second quarter. » READ MORE:Eagles’ Brandon Graham returns to practice Burks was next in line. He played 71 snaps, his second-highest total in an NFL game, and he struggled. The Kansas City Chiefs targeted Burks nine times in coverage and completed t all nine passes, including one for a touchdown. It was one of Burks’ worst games by Pro Football Focus grading in his career as the Chiefs won, 25-22, in overtime. One year later, Burks is in a similar spot, though it’s far from the same. Nakobe Dean’s season-ending injury occurred during the wild-card win over Green Bay and Burks has been starting ever since. His play has gotten better, too. Burks had one of the best games of his career during the Eagles’ 55-23 NFC championship victory over Washington. He recorded nine tackles, including a sack and a forced fumble. This from a guy who missed so much of training camp with a knee injury that his roster spot wasn’t a guarantee. The Eagles brought him in on a one-year deal to provide some depth at linebacker, but he barely got on the field in camp. He was initially cut before being named to the practice squad and then receiving a promotion to the 53-man roster. “I had one or two practices and then the last preseason game and that was my resumé,” Burks said. “I really just believed in this locker room and wanted to be here and wanted to prove that I should be here. “That’s been my whole career, just trying to find a way to add value. And that’s whether it’s on [special] teams, whether it’s on defense, being a great locker room guy, being a great leader, just embracing that.” Burks, of course, isn’t happy how his opportunity happened. Burks started in Week 17 when Dean had an abdominal injury and then again in Week 18 when the Eagles rested their starters. But Burks  expected to be back on the bench as Dean returned for  the playoffs. The Eagles have a deep and talented roster, but linebacker was a big question mark entering the 2024 season. Dean had yet to excel, Zack Baun was an unknown, Burks was a special teams ace, Devin White looked good at times in camp but didn’t earn a job, and Jeremiah Trotter Jr. was a fifth-round draft pick. Linebacker, however, has turned into a strength. Dean emerged as a key player after missing most of 2023 with an injury, and Baun, initially signed as a potential rotational edge rusher, turned into an All-Pro off-ball linebacker.Vic Fangiohas gotten a lot out of the group, and he’s getting a lot out of Burks now, too. But even before Burks’ number was called as a starter, he started the playoffs with a pop, forcing a fumble on the opening kickoff of the wild-card game against the Packers. “The season has a lot of ebbs and flows, but this is the big one that you’ve been preparing for your whole life,” Burks said. Dean is still part of all this, Burks said. He’s out in California rehabbing after surgery to repair a torn patellar tendon in his knee, but his smiling face was seen on FaceTime after the game Sunday, and Burks said he was looking forward to seeing Dean in New Orleans. “He’s just as much a part of that win as any of us,” Burks said. » READ MORE:Meet the Moms: Inside the ‘sisterhood’ that supports the rise of the Eagles’ homegrown Philly Dawgs defense As for how he’s able to help some of the guys who weren’t in the locker room for a Super Bowl vs. the Chiefs, Burks said he made sure to let Baun know how crazy things would be once they left Philadelphia and arrived in New Orleans. On the field, Burks knows how good of a route-runner Travis Kelce is and how difficult the Chiefs will make things on the Eagles defense. And that Mahomes guy? “Don’t give him too much time at the end,” Burks said. “That’s one of the big things, a common theme. He’s a hell of a quarterback. He comes through in those clutch moments.”",

O’Brien became leader of the 22,100-student West Philadelphia university in September afterJohn A. Fry, who led Drexel for 14 years, was named president ofTemple University. Merlo, who spent 14 years as a scholar and leader at Penn, where he also coachedmen’s water poloand led the team tothree championship titlesin the Mid Atlantic Division of the Collegiate Water Polo Association, was chosen following the work of a search committee including trustees, faculty members, students and administrators that lasted just under six months. » READ MORE:Drexel will trim senior leaders’ salaries, slash retirement benefits, and consider layoffs in the face of its $63 million operating loss “Dr. Merlo is the ideal leader to uphold Drexel’s values and guide the university into its next chapter,” Richard Greenawalt, outgoing chair of Drexel’s board of trustees said in a statement. “His commitment to academic entrepreneurship and his proven success in bringing together faculty, students, scholars, and practitioners to address critical societal challenges are particularly vital as we move forward with strategic institutional priorities, including an academic transformation already underway, and focus on building long-term financial resilience.” Merlo comes as Drexel, along with many other colleges, continues to cope with financial challenges as the college-going pool declines, faith in higher education wanes, and competition increases. In September, the schoolasked several deansto step down as part of consolidating two colleges and one of its schools into a new entity. It’s part of a larger academic restructuring, which also includes plans to move from a quarter system to a semester system over the next few years. Later that fall, college leaders announced the school had experienced a 15% decline in first-year students and a $63 million operating loss.

It already had identified much of those cuts; some of the work may now fall to Merlo. “I am absolutely thrilled to be asked to lead this institution, which I have admired from a distance for some time,” Merlo said in a 20-minute interview, shortly after the board approved his hire. He cited the college’s co-op program that places students in paid work experiences as part of their core learning and the school’s willingness to adapt to changing conditions. “I consider myself an academic entrepreneur,” he said. “I see myself as such in every leadership role I’ve had. This just feels like such a fantastic fit.” At NYU,Merlo prioritized fundraisingand “right-sizing staff,” Drexel said, noting that NYU’s Arts & Science school raised its most amount of money ever in 2024. Right-sizing, Merlo said, means trying to allocate the right talent to the right task and re-targeting resources to where they are most needed. “I’m an economist,” he said, “so I understand very well that concept that we maximize our objective functions subject to the constraints we face.” Drexel, like most private colleges, declined to release Merlo’s salary, which will eventually become available through public tax forms. His predecessor, Fry, earned $2.2 million in total compensation in 2022, with a base salary of more than $886,000. Merlo’s initial focus will be making sure Drexel’s projects, including its academic structural changes, get completed and that “we land the plane in the best possible way,” he said. » READ MORE:Salus president was surprised by merger partner Drexel’s financial woes: ‘We’re not happy about it’ Merlo isn’t the first president born outside the U.S. to lead Drexel. The lateConstantine “Taki” Papadakis, who served as president from 1995 until his death in 2009, was born in Greece. Papadakis oversaw a major expansion of Drexel, transforming it from a struggling engineering school to a strong institution with a law school and medical school. Born in a small town outside of Milan, he grew up in a working-class family and was a first-generation college student whose father, now, 95, “still wonders when I’m going to get a real job,” Merlo said. He began playing water polo at age 12, and it grew into a passion, he said during a 2020 interview on a sports program. He got his undergraduate degree in economics and social sciences from Bocconi University in Italy in 1987, came to the United States in 1988, and earned his doctorate in economics from NYU. He started his career as an assistant professor at the University of Minnesota in 1992 and worked there for six years before returning to NYU as an associate professor of economics. In 2000, he joined Penn where he worked for 14 years, serving as an economics professor, chair of the department and director of the Penn Institute for Economic Research. In 2009, he received the Lindback Foundation Award for Distinguished Teaching. In hiring Merlo in 2000, a Penn deandescribed himas one of the leading experts in the nation on the political economy, according to The Daily Pennsylvanian. In a 2013 story by the student newspaper, he was described as “gregarious, articulate, passionate and intense,” in regard to his coaching. » READ MORE:As Drexel undergoes a presidential transition, its leaders outline plans and problems to overcome He joined Rice University in 2014 where he was an economics professor and chaired the department, later becoming dean of its school of social sciences. There, he also worked with government agencies and nonprofit groups to set up a public policy research institute, according to Drexel. Since 2019, he’s served as dean of NYU’s largest academic unit, overseeing three schools, as well as departments, research centers, institutes and language and cultural houses. During his tenure, five new centers fostering cross-disciplinary work have been started, as well as an office of research. His research has explored the economic impact of public policy and he has written about how the economy affects voting and crime and “the career decisions of politicians.” Merlo also coached water polo at Rice and NYU, in addition to Penn, and three times has been named coach of the year. Merlo said he learned important lessons from coaching that he has applied to every leadership he’s had: “Coaches don’t win championships. Teams win championships. The job of the coach is just to put together the best possible team and then guide them through and help them achieve their full potential. “And you need the right team. How do you motivate and inspire people in doing their particular role on a team? ...How do you make this a fulfilling and inspirational mission for each member of your team? That’s when magic happens.” In addition to water polo, Merlo said he also enjoys the opera and cooking: “Risotto is my absolute specialty.” Mike Lawrie, incoming board of trustees’ chair who led the search committee, called Merlo “a rising star in higher education. He has championed new initiatives and taken on leadership roles at every institution that he has served, while endearing himself to students, faculty and staff along the way.” Lawrie, who is founder and CEO of the Lawrie Group, a consulting and management firm, and founder, chair andCEO of TLG Acquisition One Corp., will replace Greenawalt as board chair, the school announced.

Bankrupt Prospect Medical Holdings announced Friday that it intends to sell bankrupt Crozer Health to a “not-for-profit consortium of health-care operators,” with state involvement in its plan,but state officials from the attorney general and the governor’s office monitoring the bankruptcy did not immediately confirm that a deal had been reached. The announcement did not name the health-care operators who would participate in the consortium. Prospect, which filed for bankruptcy Jan. 11, has been negotiating with representatives of Gov.Josh Shapiro’s administration and the state attorney general to transfer Crozer to a new nonprofit. State officials have been involved because the state has been working for more than a year keep the hospitals open. Prospect said in an emergency sale motion Friday that an agreement was reached “merely hours” before “the potentially unavoidable decision to shut hospital doors and begin turning away patients” would have been made. “The proposed sale remains subject to definitive documentation,” Prospect said. If an agreement is reached, a bankruptcy hearing would be held Thursday to seek emergency approval of the sale. At the opening bankruptcy hearing Jan. 14, Prospect’s lawyer made clear that one of the company’s top priorities in the bankruptcy was unloading Crozer, which has a $130 million operating last year, according to the lawyer. The lawyer, Thomas R. Calfano, of Sidley Austin, predicted that the company would soon be back with an emergency motion to sell Crozer — or close it. This is a developing story and will be updated.",

        "source": "https://6abc.com/",
        "content": "Tariffson goods fromMexicoand Canada that are set to take effect could hike the price of a gallon of gasoline for some drivers by as much as 70 cents and send grocery bills climbing, experts told ABC News. The Trump administration this week reiterated plans to slap 25% tariffs on all products from Canada and Mexico on Feb. 1. Those countries make up two of the three largest U.S. trading partners, government data shows. Tariffs of this magnitude would likely increase prices paid by U.S. shoppers, since importers typically pass along a share of the cost of those higher taxes to consumers, experts said. The policy could raise prices for an array of products ranging from tomatoes to tequila to auto parts. The scary thing is the list of products is very, very long, said Jason Miller, a professor of supply-chain management at Michigan State University. The price impact remains unclear, however, since businesses within the supply chain could opt to take on some or all of the tax burden, some experts added, noting the tariffs may not take effect at all since Trump has previously used them as a source of leverage in international negotiations. In response to ABC News' request for comment, a White House spokesperson touted Trump's previous economic policies, including tariffs. In his first administration, President Trump instituted an America First economic agenda of tariffs, tax cuts, deregulation, and an unleashing of American energy that resulted in historic job, wage, and investment growth with no inflation. In his second administration, President Trump will again use tariffs to level the playing field and usher in a new era of growth and prosperity for American industry and workers,\" White House spokesperson Kush Desai told ABC News. Here's what to know about which products could see price increases as result of the tariffs, according to experts: Mexico and Canada account for 70% of U.S. crude oil imports, which make up a key input for the nations gasoline supply, according to theU.S. Energy Information Administration, a government agency. Those imports come primarily from Canada, which sends crude oil to U.S. refineries built specifically to process the crude and redistribute it as car-ready gasoline, Timothy Fitzgerald, a professor of business economics at the University of Tennessee who studies the petroleum industry, told ABC News. Gasoline that originates as Canadian crude reaches customers in the upper Midwest as well as some along the East and West coasts, Fitzgerald said. For those drivers, he added, prices could rise between 40 and 70 cents per gallon of gasoline. You could definitely be looking at 50 cent-a-gallon increases in a lot of parts of the country, Fitzgerald added, noting that the effects would be limited to the regions that rely on imported crude. The tariff-related price increase may combine with a seasonal price hike set to take effect within weeks, since demand for gas typically grows as travel picks up in the warmer spring weather, experts said. That seasonal price impact could add another 30 cents per gallon, putting the total increase in gasoline prices at $1 per gallon if the tariffs remain in place at the onset of spring, Fitzgerald said. The U.S. imported $38.5 billion in agricultural goods from Mexico in 2023, making it the top recipient of such products,U.S Department of Agriculturedata showed. Those imports include more than $3 billion worth of fresh fruits and vegetables. Mexican imports account for a large share of some fruits and vegetables routinely eaten by Americans. Roughly 90% of avocados eaten in the U.S. last year originated in Mexico, USDA data showed. Other products with a high concentration of Mexican imports include tomatoes, cucumbers, bell peppers, jalapenos, limes and mangos, Miller said. It would be difficult for the U.S. to replace those goods with domestic production or an alternative supplier, making it likely that prices would rise significantly if the tariffs take effect, he added. Youd certainly expect to see an impact on prices, Miller said. The U.S. also imports large quantities of beer, tequila and other alcoholic beverages from Mexico, experts said. In 2022, the U.S. imported about $26 billion worth of alcoholic drinks from Mexico, according to theUSDA. Dont forget all that beer we import from Mexico, Miller said. Carmakers and consumers depend on the auto industrys deep ties to Canada and Mexico, making tariffs a threat to prices, experts said. Mexico and Canada make up the top two U.S. trading partners for both finished motor vehicles and car parts, according to aCato Instituteanalysis of data from the U.S. International Trade Commission. In 2023, Canada and Mexico accounted for nearly $120 billion worth of U.S. motor vehicle imports, which totaled about 47% of all such vehicles imported that year. Canada and Mexico made up nearly the same share of auto parts imports that year, the Cato Institute analysis showed. The operations of auto companies on both sides of the border will be hugely affected by these tariffs, Robert Lawrence, a professor of trade and investment at Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government, told ABC News.",

        "content": "Fifteen years ago, Miriam Helmick was sentenced to life without parole for the murder of her second husband, Colorado businessman Alan Helmick. She currently sits behind bars at the Colorado Womens Correctional Facility serving a prison sentence for a crime she says she did not commit. Now, Miriam Helmick is speaking publicly for the first time since her conviction, offering details about her relationship with Alan and the events of the fateful day when he died. It won't be over for anybody until it's over for me, and I do have hopes, Helmick said. I know that I didn't kill him. Helmick spoke with ABC News' John Quiñones in a prison interview for a new 20/20 airing Friday, January 31, at 9 p.m. ET on ABC, and streaming the next day on Hulu. The couple's story began on the dance floor. Miriam, a dance instructor, taught Alan ballroom dancing and their friendship blossomed into romance. Their nuptials were a second marriage for them both, and they had dreams of sharing a life together. Miriam describes Alan as a very kind, very sweet man. She said he was funny and well liked in the community. He always had your best interest at heart usually, Miriam Helmick said about Alan. Their dreams came to a sudden and tragic end on June 10, 2008. Miriam said she was running errands that morning and planned to meet Alan for lunch. When she couldnt reach him by phone, she told police she returned to their Whitewater, Colorado, home and found her husband lying in a pool of blood. The house appeared ransacked, and Miriam frantically called 911. Robin Martin, an investigator with the Mesa County Sheriffs Office who worked on the case, remembered how the first officers who arrived on the scene said they found Miriam distraught and kneeling over her husband. Alan was on the floor in the kitchen, Martin said. It looked like he had been shot in the head. We had a bullet casing next to his body. Police found no one else in the house. As they conducted a sweep of the home, they noticed drawers pulled out in the kitchen and a trash can tipped over in Alans office. Investigators followed routine protocol to thoroughly review the spouses whereabouts. They tested Miriam for gunshot residue and swabbed her clothes for blood. Those tests came back negative. She even showed police all the printed receipts from where she was shopping that day. \"She actually went from one end of the valley to the other end, Mesa County Prosecutor Rich Tuttle said. We were able to track her movements not only by her receipts, but by her cellphone interacting with cellphone towers. Miriam also told police about a shocking incident that happened just six weeks earlier. Miriam said that someone had attempted to blow up Alans car. The couple had been in nearby Delta, Colorado, when Miriam went to the restroom and came back to see Alans car on fire. A wick was found in the gas tank. He came in saying that his car was on fire, and he asked me to get water, and that's all I know about it from there, Miriam Helmick told 20/20. When investigators in Delta asked Alan if Miriam could have been the one to start the fire, Alan insisted she would not have done that and asked that police stop the investigation. Oh God. No, I don't think that, Alan Helmick is heard on a recording of the police interview about the fire incident in Delta, Colorado. Why would she do that? In her 20/20 interview, Miriam Helmick suggested that Alan might have started the fire himself. She said that he could have been trying to collect insurance money. The thing about Alan (was) if he had thought I had done it, he'd have helped me pack a bag, put me on I-70, Helmick said. According to Miriam, Alan told her the investigation was done and that was the last they spoke of it. As days passed with no suspects in custody for Alan's murder, Miriam Helmick said she became convinced she was being watched, reporting that weird things were happening around her house. Then weeks after Alans death, Miriam said she found a disturbing card on her doorstep with a message inside that said, Allen[sic]was first, your[sic]next. Run, run, run! It was a mysterious note that made Miriams friends worry for her safety and that she may be the next target. Miriam calls me and shes frantic, Jeri Yarbrough recalled of the incident with her friend. She goes, What should I do? And I said, Well, you need to hang up the phone and call the police and get out of there. I said, because somebody could be there trying to hurt you. When Martin investigated the card, she said she was shocked by what she tracked down. The surveillance video from the store where the card was purchased showed it was Miriam Helmick who bought that greeting card. It was her. She was wearing the same style of shirt that she had walked in with her[police]interview, Martin said. In her interview with ABC News Correspondent John Quiñones, Helmick claimed that she saw suspicious cars driving around her property in the time after Alans death and that she felt police were not taking it seriously. She said she wrote the card herself in the hopes that police would up their investigation. \"Maybe it was a really bad decision, Miriam said, but at the same time, I thought they would come out and actually look to see who this person was because it didn't seem to be care very much about my safety at that point, and they hadn't told me that I was a person of interest. Prosecutors said Miriam alone was responsible for Alans death. Six months after the murder, Miriam was charged with first-degree murder, attempted murder for the car fire incident and several counts of forgery. Prosecutors claimed Miriams motive for murder was money. There were suspicious bank account activity where it appeared that Miriam had forged multiple checks from Alan's account, Tuttle said. All told, she had taken about $40,000 out of his account through writing those checks. Miriam told Quiñones that Alan knew that she was writing those checks. She said that they owned a dance studio and a horse farm together and Miriam was responsible for payroll and other business expenses. In December 2009, a jury found Miriam Helmick guilty of first-degree murder in the death of Alan Helmick. She was also convicted of attempted first-degree murder for the car fire and multiple forgery counts. She was sentenced to life in prison plus 78 years. Tuttle told Quiñones he thinks the jury got it right. I think there's no way that Miriam Helmick should ever be free in society again. So, life in prison without the possibility of parole, it's the only sentence that serves justice, Tuttle said. From prison, Miriam said she is determined to clear her name and will not stop until she is successful. I know that I didn't kill him, Helmick said. I don't care about anybody else's opinion. What I want more than anything is to prove that. Miriam Helmick has filed numerous appeals with the courts. They have all been rejected. When it comes to Alans family and friends, there are some things that they would rather forget, they told \"20/20.\" I try not to think about the murder. I more like to think about the fun times that we had with Alan. Those are good memories, Ed Benson said of his friend. Alans friends prefer to remember him as someone who was a lot of fun. \"He was the kind of guy you could meet and have a drink with and have a good laugh, Alans friend, Bob Cucchetti, said.",

        "title": "FDA approves painkiller designed to eliminate the risk of addiction",
        "source": "https://6abc.com/",
        "content": "WASHINGTON --Federal officials on Thursday approved a new type of pain pill designed to eliminate the risks of addiction and overdose associated with opioid medications like Vicodin and OxyContin. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration said it approved Vertex Pharmaceuticals' Journavx for short-term pain that often follows surgery or injuries. It's the first new pharmaceutical approach to treating pain in more than 20 years, offering an alternative to both opioids and over-the-counter medications like ibuprofen and acetaminophen. But the medication's modest effectiveness and lengthy development process underscore the challenges of finding new ways to manage pain. Studies in more than 870 patients with acute pain due to foot and abdominal surgeries showed Vertex's drug provided more relief than a dummy pill but didn't outperform a common opioid-acetaminophen combination pill. \"It's not a slam dunk on effectiveness,\" said Michael Schuh of the Mayo Clinic, a pharmacist and pain medicine expert who was not involved in the research. \"But it is a slam dunk in that it's a very different pathway and mechanism of action. So, I think that shows a lot promise.\" The new drug will carry a list price of $15.50 per pill, making it many times more expensive than comparable opioids, which are often available as generics for $1 or less. Vertex began researching the drug in the 2000s, when overdoses were rocketing upward, principally driven by mass prescribing of opioid painkillers for common ailments like arthritis and back pain. Prescriptions have fallen sharply in the last decade and the current wave of the opioid epidemic is mainly due to illicit fentanyl, not pharmaceutical medicines. Opioids reduce pain by binding to receptors in the brain that receive nerve signals from different parts of the body. Those chemical interactions also give rise to opioids' addictive effects. Vertex's drug works differently, blocking proteins that trigger pain signals that are later sent to the brain. \"In trying to develop medicines that don't have the addictive risks of opioid medicines, a key factor is working to block pain signaling before it gets to the brain,\" Vertex's Dr. David Altshuler, told The Associated Press last year. Commonly reported side effects with the drug were nausea, constipation, itching, rash and headache. \"The new medication has side effect profiles that are inherently, not only different, but don't involve the risk of substance abuse and other key side effects associated with opioids,\" said Dr. Charles Argoff of the Albany Medical Center, who consulted for Vertex on the drug's development. The initial concept to focus on pain-signaling proteins came out of research involving people with a rare hereditary condition that causes insensitivity to pain. Vertex has attracted interest from Wall Street for its ambitious drug pipeline that involves winning FDA approval for multiple drugs across several forms of chronic pain, which generally represents a bigger financial opportunity than acute pain. But the Boston drugmaker's share price plummeted in December when Vertex reported disappointing mid-stage results in a study of patients with chronic nerve pain affecting the lower back and legs. The drug didn't perform significantly better than placebo, the research found. \"We believe the data reflect a near worst-case scenario for this key pipeline program,\" biotechnology analyst Brian Abrahams said in a research note to investors, adding that the results jeopardized estimates that Vertex's pipeline could be worth billions across multiple forms of pain. Still, Vertex executives said they plan to move forward with a new, late-stage study of the drug, theorizing that a different trial design could yield better results and pave the way for FDA approval in chronic pain.",

WASHINGTON --Recovery efforts were ongoing Friday morning following the nation's first major commercial airline crash since 2009. Crews are now awaiting heavy machinery, including cranes, from the Army Corps of Engineers, Coast Guard and private contractors before they can extract additional collision victims, sources familiar with the operation told ABC News. The hope is the equipment will be in position to begin raising pieces of the fuselage as soon as Friday but the operation is expected to last at least through the weekend. Dive teams ceased operations on the Potomac on Thursday after recovering all of the bodies they were able to without moving the fuselage, according to two sources familiar with the operations. On Wednesday night, a regional American Airlines passenger jet and a Black Hawk military helicopter collided over Washington, D.C. The flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorder -- known as black boxes -- from the American Airlines plane have been recovered and are at a National Transportation Safety Board lab. DC PLANE CRASH:A timeline of the deadly collision 41 bodies have been recovered and 28 of those victims have been positively identified, Washington, D.C., Fire and EMS Chief John Donnelly Sr. said at a news conference Friday. Next of kin notifications had been made to 18 families as of 6 a.m. Friday, he said. All 67 people on board the plane and the helicopter were killed in the Wednesday night crash. Donnelly said crews expect to recover all of the bodies. It appears crews will need to remove the plane fuselage from the river to recover the remaining victims, he said. Salvage work on removing aircraft from the water will start as early as Saturday, he said. Fire and EMS has received 911 calls from people who spotted debris in the water; body parts have not been recovered from those 911 calls, he added. Additional bodies and human remains will need to be extracted from the wreckage once it is lifted to the surface of the river. Crews are bracing for the possibility some of the victims will not be recovered because of the fireball that resulted from the collision, the sources said. The Federal Aviation Administration is not giving permission for low-altitude helicopter routes around Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport, the FAA told ABC News. It's unclear how long this will last. Helicopters can still fly into and out of the airport, but are restricted from flying specific river routes. PresidentDonald Trumpsaid there were no survivors from the crash in remarks Thursday morning, calling the crash a \"tragedy of terrible proportions.\" \"Our hearts are shattered,\" Trump said in a press briefing at the White House, after holding a moment of silence. \"Our prayers are with you now and in the days to come.\" \"We are all searching for answers,\" Trump said, adding, \"We do not know what led to this crash\" but have \"some pretty good ideas.\" The NTSB has said their preliminary report into what caused the crash will take approximately 30 days and that it will take \"a year or more\" to get a final probable cause. Todd Inman, a member of the National Transportation Safety Board, appeared on \"Good Morning America\" on Friday, saying that the NTSB \"will be on scene here doing all the recovery of the perishable evidence we need for as long as it takes.\" \"The preliminary report, we believe, will be out in 30 days but in case of these major investigations, it will take a year, if not more, for us to come to a final probable cause,\" Inman continued. \"The most important thing is, the work doesn't just end then. We make recommendations so that we don't have tragedies like this again in the future.\" Inman said the NTSB has started the process of extracting data from the voice recorder. \"The data recorder itself has thousands of data points and they all have to be synchronized against a lot of other things that happened in the plane,\" Inman said. \"The voice recorders have to be what is called 'auditioned' among a number of people so that there's complete agreement of how the transcript will come out. We also look for ancillary noises. Maybe a boom or thud or crack or something in the cockpit. Those things are going on concurrently, along with the fact we have several hundred people in the field looking at every other aspect of this investigation.\" Inman also said that it is way too early to make any conclusions about what exactly caused the crash. \"The only conclusion I know is last night we met with several hundred family members who lost their loved ones in the Potomac,\" he said. \"We don't need that to happen anymore. We're going to work. We're going to continue. We're going find out what happened and we're going try to stop it from happening again.\" DC PLANE CRASH VICTIMS:What we know about those on AA Flight 5342, Army Black Hawk American Airlines CEO Robert Isom remains in Washington, D.C., on Thursday to support the families and help authorities. \"Out of respect for the families, we are not sharing the names of the two pilots and two flight attendants at this time, but our thoughts and prayers go out to their loved ones,\" Isom said. The Black Hawk helicopter, which had three soldiers on board, carries a black box with a voice and flight data recorder. Authorities were still looking for the helicopter's black box recorder, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said Friday on Fox News Channel. Other factors in the crash, including the helicopter's altitude and whether the crew was using its night vision goggles, are still under investigation, Hegseth said. \"It was a fairly experienced crew that was doing a required annual night evaluation,\" Hegseth said Thursday. \"They did have night vision goggles.\" Jimmie Cummings, a spokesman for the Army's Combat Readiness Center at Fort Novosel, Alabama, said that just like all soldiers who must meet regular qualifications for their weapons, Army aviators have to meet annual qualifications, regardless of their flight experience. For aviators, that means flying under different conditions, which could mean flying in daytime or nighttime. It was based at Fort Belvoir, Virginia, according to an Army official. \"We are working with local officials and will provide additional information once it becomes available,\" the official said. On Wednesday at Reagan Airport, a supervisor made the decision to combine two controller positions into one position. This decision was made 40 minutes earlier than normal because the supervisor determined that the traffic was low enough to combine, according to a source with direct knowledge. This position handles local arrivals into Reagan and helicopter traffic when it's combined. This happens routinely when aircraft volume goes down. Reagan is not understaffed, the source added. The air traffic controllers' union said in a statement that it's working with all federal agencies and \"stands with the highly trained, highly skilled\" workforce that \"keeps the United States as the gold standard for aviation safety.\"",

        "content": "Atco, NJ --Gregory Sharp is metal. The facility manager at Wade's Salvage Inc. knows everything about it. The price, the weight, the value. He's seen a lot of metal coming through his scrap metal operation over the years. The Atco, New Jersey salvage operation has been in his family since World War II, operating mainly during the week as a scrap metal operation recycling center. In the 80s, his grandparents built up a wide collection of military surplus aircraft and parts. Piles and piles of metal, scrap, vintage cars, schools buses, and old military aircraft are precariously strewn about the yard making for a unique and foreboding backdrop. So much kept piling up, that when a production crew for Eddie and Cruiser's accidentally drove by the yard they immediately fell in love with the setting. They filmed most of the movie's climax there and cemented Wade's as a Hollywood destination for an awesome ready-made movie set. \"They got permission from my grandparents at the time to film here. They came back, built the set and were filming for a whole week. In the film, they're here for 10 minutes,\" Sharp remembers. The family kept their connections with the movie studios and since then they've played host to a variety of filming locations looking for the perfect post-apocalyptic setting. And they've provided movies with plenty of props and items too. \"We have a good relationship with set decorators. They're looking for this or that for their show, I'll look for it and we'll send it out.\" They've had many productions come out to shoot at the yard over the years such as Eddie and the Cruisers in 1983, Amazon's Fallout series released in 2024, and Apple Studio's Wolfs starring Brad Pitt and George Clooney coming out in 2024. And they've offered props to productions like Blacklist (2019-2023), The Walking Dead-Dead City (2023), Severance (2023, 2024) and Only Murders in the Building (2024). \"I watch TV with my wife, I can point out my props when I see them on the screen. I'll say that's mine, that's mine, that's ours! She hates watching TV with me,\" Sharp laughs. Sharp says they host photo shoots there too. Plenty of cosplayers and folks looking to spark their imagination with an unforgettable background love taking pictures amidst the towering piles of trash and metal relics. The public is welcome to visit by appointment only, usually on the weekends. For more information about tours, please call them at 856-767-2760",

        "source": "https://6abc.com/",
        "content": "The repealed regulation keeping teens from buying guns originated in 1968. A federal appeals court on Thursday struck down a longstanding federal ban that prevented the sale of handguns to Americans between the ages of 18 and 20 - a landmark gun control regulation in place since 1968. The conservative Fifth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals ruled that the federal law banning handgun sales to teens is inconsistent with the nation's historical tradition and violates the Second Amendment. The decision cited the Supreme Court's 2022 opinion by Clarence Thomas in New York State Rifle and Pistol Association v. Bruen, which significantly expanded gun rights and threatens to rollback other gun safety laws nationwide. \"Ultimately, the text of the Second Amendment includes eighteen-to-twenty-year-old individuals among 'the people' whose right to keep and bear arms is protected,\" the court wrote in its opinion statement. The statement went on, \"The federal government has presented scant evidence that eighteen-to-twenty-year-olds firearm rights during the founding-era were restricted in a similar manner to the contemporary federal handgun purchase ban, and its 19th century evidence 'cannot provide much insight into the meaning of the Second Amendment when it contradicts earlier evidence.'\" The immediate nationwide impact of the ruling is unclear. The case is almost certainly bound for the Supreme Court. Handguns have been the most commonly used weapons in murders and mass shootings for decades in the United States, according to government data analyzed by The Violence Project. Last term, the Supreme Court upheld a longstanding federal law prohibiting the possession of firearms by people under domestic violence restraining orders. In the next few weeks, it will consider whether gun manufacturers can be held liable for violent crimes perpetrated by criminals who easily get the weapons.",

They laid down an irregular flagstone patio, framed with boulders and topped with colorful planters and a toasty propane fire pit. Justin Bates founded Bates Landscaping in 2011.  He and his siblings had grown up working in theirfather'slandscape business.  Though Justin loved it, he he went to work in the restaurant industry as an adult, but soon found hemissedworking outdoors.  So he cashed out his retirement savings, bought some tools and hired some workers. He started out of his mother's garage in Lansdowne, mowing lawns for 8-10 customers. As business grew, his brother, Dylan, came on board, and so did Melissa Blake. She is his lead designer, business development officer and wife.  The two met working in that restaurant but she had a background in landscaping, with a degree from Penn State University and experience working at a tree care company. Justin's sister, Cailee works for the business too and so does Melissa's sister. Their projects range from simple front yard renovations to give added curb appeal to total backyard transformations with water features and maybe a barrel sauna.

        "content": "PHILADELPHIA (WPVI) --Some passengers of the American Airlines regional jet that collided with a military helicopter and crashed in Washington, D.C., have connections to the Philadelphia region. Flight 5342 and the U.S. Army Black Hawk helicoptercollided just before 9 p.m. Wednesday. Wreckage from the crash fell into the Potomac River where recovery operations continue. There were 60 passengers and four crew members on board the plane and three soldiers on the helicopter. No survivors are expected. Here's what we know about the connections to the Philadelphia region so far: The wife of skating coach Alexandr \"Sasha\" Kirsanov, 46, confirmed to ABC News her husband was on the plane. Natalya Gudin said Kirsanov was with two youth ice skaters on board the flight. \"I lost everything. I lost my husband. I lost my students. I lost my friends,\" Gudin said. Gudin, who also coaches students with her husband in Delaware, said she stayed home to be with their other skaters. \"We are husband and wife,\" Gudin said. \"We decided who's going, who's staying home,\" she said. \"We decided he would go to the development camp.\" Two young skaters, Sean Kay and Angela Yang, who had ties to the University of Delaware Figure Skating Club, were also among those killed, according to U.S. Senator Chris Coons. \"I'm devastated to hear the news that at least three Delawareans died during last night's air collision. Sasha Kirsanov, Sean Kay, and Angela Yang went to Wichita to pursue their passion for figure skating,\" Coons said in a statement. Last week, thethe club postedabout Kay and Yang before their trip to Wichita. \"It is a tragedy that none of them returned home to our state. Delaware is a state of neighbors, and tonight we hold all of our neighbors a little closer. My heart goes out to Sasha's wife Natalia, the University of Delaware Figure Skating Club, and every other Delawarean touched by the three of them,\" added Coons. RELATED:'Hearts are heavy': 14 figure skaters among victims of DC plane crash Gudin last spoke with her husband as he boarded the flight on Wednesday, she said. \"I need my husband back,\" Gudin said as she waited at a hotel for further information from authorities. \"I need his body back.\" University of Delaware President Dr. Dennis Assanis released a statement on the tragedy saying, \"The figure skating community is tight-knit, and many of our students and coaches have trained and competed alongside those who were lost.\" \"Our hearts go out to the families and friends of all of the victims of this horrific tragedy,\" he added. The Philadelphia Skating Clubposted a statement on social mediaThursday saying the victims include \"beloved members\" of the club. \"Everyone is trying to rally around each other, especially for those who were really close to the ones that were lost,\" said Regina Barr, the director and skating coach of the club, which is located in Ardmore. She said one of their newest members, who joined the club just a few weeks ago, was among those killed. Action News has confirmed that the skater was Alydia Livingston who had recently partnered with a local skater in our area. \"He's been a long-time skater here and we were very proud of the new ice dance team,\" Barr said. In a prepared statement, the Ice Works Skating Club in Aston, Pa. said some of the victims on the plane skated at the club. \"Even though many of these skaters were not club members at our rink, they all spent time training here and competing in our events,\" said Lisa Shaw, the skating director at IceWorks.",

(WPVI) --Two New Jersey parents who work in law enforcement are facing charges in connection with an alleged sex crime case against children. Troopers surrounded Brian and Elizabeth DiBiasi's home in Hamilton Township, Mercer County before they were arrested on Wednesday. Attorney General Matthew Platkin said the husband and wife are charged in connection with creating, producing and distributing images of child sexual abuse. Records show Brian, 39, has worked with the Hamilton Township Police Department for 21 years and Elizabeth, 42, has been employed by the Mercer County Sheriff's Office for 18 years. On Tuesday, Platkin said investigators received a tip that Brian allegedly distributed multiple files online showing nude images of his wife in the presence of children. He's also accused of mentioning children being present while he and his wife had sex. \"Sexual offenses against children are among the most serious crimes we charge,\" said Platkin. \"It's especially disturbing when, as in this case, the accused are members of law enforcement.\" Some residents told us they were concerned because there are many children in the neighborhood. \"People look like normal people and sometimes they're monsters underneath and that's scary,\" said Hart. Mayor Jeff Martin and Chief of Police Ken DeBoskey said in a joint statement, \"Hamilton Township has zero tolerance for crimes of this nature. We remain fully committed to upholding the highest standards of integrity and accountability within our community and our police department.\" Mercer County Sheriff Jack Kemler said, \"As the Mercer County Sheriff and a community leader, know that I have zero tolerance for (alleged) immoral acts in our community and within our ranks. Like many employers, we cannot control how people behave outside of the workplace and at home.\" Both suspects are being held in Monmouth County Jail. The sheriff's office said Elizabeth DiBias is suspended without pay as police continue to investigate. The Hamilton Police Division said Brian DiBias is being suspended without pay and served with a notice of termination. Platkin said Brian is charged with causing or permitting a child to engage in a sexual act that may be photographed, filmed or reproduced (1st degree), engaging in sexual conduct that would debauch the morals of a child (2nd degree); possessing fewer than 1,000 images of child sexual abuse (3rd degree); distributing images of child sexual abuse (2nd degree); and possessing images of child sexual abuse with the intent to distribute (2nd degree). Elizabeth is charged with engaging in sexual conduct that would debauch the morals of a child (2nd degree).",

PHILADELPHIA-A national tragedy is hitting close to home for a local ice skating club as they mourn the devastating loss of fellow athletes, along with their own members, who were all on their way home from doing what they loved when the unthinkable happened. What we know: All 67 people aboard the American Airlines jet and Army helicopter are feared dead in what is likely the worst U.S. aviation disaster in almost 24 years, officials said Thursday. In a statement to FOX 29, the Philadelphia Ice Skating Club and Humane Society said that \"beloved\" members were among those killed when anAmerican Airlines plane collided with an Army helicopternear Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport Wednesday night: \"The Philadelphia Skating Club and Humane Society is devastated to learn of the crash in Washington D.C. that took the lives of several members of the figure skating community, including beloved members of our club. We feel immense grief at the loss of so many talented skaters, their coaches and families. Sadly, one of the families lost just became members of our club and another shared his talent with us at our recent 175th Anniversary Gala. We share this loss and grief with the entire USFS Community. Our thoughts and prayers are with everyone during this tragic time.\" Meanwhile, three other individuals in the Delaware figure skating community were named as victims of the doomed flight. Delaware Senator Chris Coons stated a former coach at the University of Delaware Figure Skating Club, Alexandr \"Sasha\" Kirsanov, a fixture at the High Performance Training Center on the university's campus was traveling with two young skaters, ice dance partners Angela Yang and Sean Kay. The local figure skating community is mourning the loss of a number of members of the US Figure Skating with local connections, including three from Delaware.

In Aston, Delaware County, Lisa Shaw has 25 years of history at IceWorks. She's currently the Skating Director and President of the club. She read a brief statement to FOX 29, but would not comment further. \"The figure skating community is a small, tight-knit group, and even though many of these skaters were not club members at our rink, they all spent time training here and competing in our events,\" she said.

PHILADELPHIA-While admitting Philadelphia public schools have a long way to go, Superintendent Tony Watlington sees important improvements in student performance. He answered questions from FOX 29 in advance of his celebratory State of the Schools address. What they're saying: \"We are really excited. We think when all the data is verified across the country, we’ll be declared one of the fastest improving, large school districts in the country,\" said Watlington. That has been Tony Watlington’s goal since the day he took control of Philadelphia schools. In a State of the Schools message, Watlington said, \"more students are coming to school and staying. Reading and math scores are up in grades 3rd through 8th. And the dropout rate is down by 14 hundred.\" Watlington reports, \"the School District of Philadelphia, the nation’s 8th largest, has increased enrollment by 1,841 students. That says to me parents and the community have greater confidence in the school district.\" The superintendent believes challenges remain, including no improvements in algebra, a coming plan to close schools and grinding poverty. In his third year of a five-year contract, he said, \"I believe poverty provides a level of significant challenge. As a child of poverty myself, I know firsthand the power of a highly qualified, well-supported, stable teacher.\" The district’s four and a half billion-dollar budget will see an infusion of more than two hundred thirty million in new state money, the result of a successful lawsuit claiming unequal state funding and more city dollars as well. Watlington said with the increased funding he plans to, \"double down on what’s working. High impact, high dosage tutoring, doubling down on professional development supporting teachers.\" The superintendent has a challenging teachers’ union contract to help negotiate in the fall and plans to stay put. \"I intend to be here as long as the mayor and board will have me. I’m absolutely committed to Philadelphia, yes,\" said Watlington. The Source:The information in this story is from The School District of Philadelphia Superintendent Tony Watlington.

WASHINGTON-Afederal judge temporarily blockedPresident Donald Trump's attempt to pause funding for federal grants and loans while his administration conducts a review aimed at eliminating progressive initiatives. But are food stamps (SNAP), Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid safe? Here’s the latest on the funding freeze: The administrative stay, prompted by a lawsuit brought by nonprofit groups, lasts until Monday and applies only to existing programs. FILE - \"SNAP/EBT Food Stamp Benefits Accepted\" is displayed on a screen inside a Family Dollar Stores Inc. store in Chicago, Illinois, U.S., on March 3, 2020.

These include: Food Stamps (SNAP)Student LoansSocial SecurityMedicareMedicaidFunds for Small BusinessesFarmersPell GrantsHead StartRental Assistance A White House directive to pause federal grants and loans raised uncertainty and fears among many who depend on federal aid before a judge intervened Tuesday to temporarily block it from taking effect. Officials said new administrations must review federal programs \" to ensure that they are being executed in accordance with the law and the new President’s policies.\" Dig deeper: Here's more In implementing President Trump’s Executive Orders,OMB issued guidancerequesting that agencies temporarily pause, to the extent permitted by law, grant, loan or federal financial assistance programs that are implicated by the President’s Executive Orders. Any program not implicated by the President’s Executive Orders is not subject to the pause. The Executive Orders listed in the guidance are: Protecting the American People Against Invasion Reevaluating and Realigning United States Foreign Aid Putting America First in International Environmental Agreements Unleashing American Energy Ending Radical and Wasteful Government DEI Programs and Preferencing Defending Women from Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government Enforcing the Hyde Amendment Any program that provides direct benefits to individuals is not subject to the pause. The guidance establishes a process for agencies to work with OMB to determine quickly whether any program is inconsistent with the President’s Executive Orders. A pause could be as short as day. In fact, OMB has worked with agencies and has already approved many programs to continue even before the pause has gone into effect. Any payment required by law to be paid will be paid without interruption or delay. Q: Is this a freeze on all Federal financial assistance? A: No, the pause does not apply across-the-board. It is expressly limited to programs, projects, and activities implicated by the President’s Executive Orders, such as ending DEI, the green new deal, and funding nongovernmental organizations that undermine the national interest. Q: Is this a freeze on benefits to Americans like SNAP or student loans? A: No, any program that provides direct benefits to Americans is explicitly excluded from the pause and exempted from this review process. In addition to Social Security and Medicare, already explicitly excluded in the guidance, mandatory programs like Medicaid and SNAP will continue without pause. Funds for small businesses, farmers, Pell grants, Head Start, rental assistance, and other similar programs will not be paused. If agencies are concerned that these programs may implicate the President’s Executive Orders, they should consult OMB to begin to unwind these objectionable policies without a pause in the payments. Q: Is the pause of federal financial assistance an impoundment? A: No, it is not an impoundment under the Impoundment Control Act. It is a temporary pause to give agencies time to ensure that financial assistance conforms to the policies set out in the President’s Executive Orders, to the extent permitted by law. Temporary pauses are a necessary part of program implementation that have been ordered by past presidents to ensure that programs are being executed and funds spent in accordance with a new President’s policies and do not constitute impoundments. Q: Why was this pause necessary? A: To act as faithful stewards of taxpayer money, new administrations must review federal programs to ensure that they are being executed in accordance with the law and the new President’s policies.

        "content": "Share FILE - ABC Sports commentator Dick Button at the 1988 Winter Olympics / XV Olympic Winter Games. LOS ANGELES-Dick Button, a two-time Olympic gold medalist and one of the most influential figures in figure skating history, has died at the age of 95. His son, Edward Button, confirmed his passing on Thursday but did not provide a cause. Button’s impact on the sport spanned decades, from his groundbreaking performances in the 1940s and 1950s to his later role as a commentator who helped shape figure skating’s popularity worldwide. The backstory: Button won back-to-back Olympic gold medals in 1948 and 1952, making history as the first U.S. figure skater to reach the top of the podium. He was a dominant force in men’s figure skating, capturing five consecutive world championships and revolutionizing the sport with technical innovations. He was the first skater to land a double axel in competition and the first to perform a triple jump—the triple loop—setting a new standard for athleticism on the ice. Following his competitive career, Button transitioned to broadcasting, where he became the most recognized and respected voice in figure skating commentary. His detailed analysis, knowledge of the sport, and signature style helped bring figure skating to a broader audience. Button’s legacy extends beyond competition and broadcasting—he was instrumental in shaping the modern landscape of figure skating. Fellow Olympic champion Scott Hamilton called him \"one of the most important figures in our sport.\" The Source:This report is based on an Associated Press article and confirmations from The New York Times and The Washington Post, citing Button’s son and daughter.

        "content": "Share Former NJ Sen. Bob Menendez has been sentenced to 11 years in prison after being convicted of abusing a Senate committee leadership position. FOX 5 NY’s Morgan McKay has the latest. NEW YORK-Former New Jersey SenatorBob Menendezhas been sentenced to 11 years in prison after being convicted last year of 16 counts of bribery, extortion, conspiracy and obstruction of justice charges. The sentence caps a remarkable downfall for Menendez, who was convicted last July of enriching himself through a variety of corrupt acts. Prosecutors said that in exchange for the gold, thousands of dollars in cash and a luxury car, the Democrat tried to protect associates from criminal investigations, met with Egyptian intelligence officials and took steps to help that country access to millions of dollars in U.S. military aid. Earlier Wednesday, Judge Sidney H. Stein also sentenced two New Jersey businessmen convicted of paying bribes. Menendez, 71, has promised to appeal. This is a breaking news update. Stay with FOX 5 NY as this story develops. Prosecutors had said thatMenendezshould have been imprisoned for 15 years, calling it an \"extraordinary attempt, at the highest levels of the Legislative Branch, to corrupt the nation’s core sovereign powers over foreign relations.\" Lawyers for the former Senator are urging the judge to be lenient, saying the ordeal has made him a \"national punchline\" despite a lifetime of good deeds that have saved lives. The backstory: Menendez wasconvicted in Julyon corruption charges after an FBI raid in 2022 uncovered $150,000 in gold bars and $480,000 in cash at his home. Prosecutors say the money came from bribes by three New Jersey businessmen seeking his influence to protect their interests and profit. A defense lawyer for Sen. Bob Menendez has tried to convince a New York jury that there's nothing to the federal government's bribery case against the Democrat. When he was charged in fall 2023, Menendez was chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. He was forced out of that position in 2023 and gave up his Senate seat in August. In arguments last week, defense lawyers called for Judge Sidney H. Stein to be lenient with Menendez, saying his conviction had \"rendered him a national punchline and stripped him of every conceivable personal, professional, and financial benefit.\" \"Bob is deserving of mercy because of the penalties already imposed, his age, and the lack of a compelling need to impose a custodial sentence,\" the lawyers said. Dig deeper: Two businessmen, Wael Hana and Fred Daibes, were convicted alongside Menendez, while a third pleaded guilty and testified at the trial in July. Prosecutors are seeking a prison sentence of at least 10 years for Hana and nine years for Daibes, saying the crimes took place between 2018 and 2022. \"The defendants’ crimes amount to an extraordinary attempt, at the highest levels of the Legislative Branch, to corrupt the nation’s core sovereign powers over foreign relations and law enforcement,\" prosecutors wrote.

        "content": "Authorities say that a person of interest in the deaths of a man and woman in Pennsylvania purchased a gun that was later used in a shooting that claimed the life of a border patrol agent. PHILADELPHIA-The case of a Delaware County couple killed in their home in late 2022 is now linked to the line-of-duty shooting death of a border patrol agent in Vermont, officials said. Pennsylvania State Police made the announcement Wednesday. What we know: Officials with Pennsylvania State Police said a United States Customs and Border Patrol Agent was killed in-the-line-duty on January 20th, 2025, in Vermont, near a Canadian border crossing in Coventry, about 20 miles from the border. The agent was attempting to conduct a vehicle stop with 21-year-old Washington state resident Teresa Youngblut and German citizen Felix Bauckholt in the car when the gunfire was exchanged. The two had been under surveillance several days. Bauckholt was killed in the gunfire, along with 44-year-old Border Patrol Agent David Maland. Related A United States Border Patrol agent was shot and killed in Vermont on Monday, according to The Department of Homeland Security. Youngblut is in custody facing weapons charges. The investigation of the murdered agent revealed the gun used was purchased by a person of interest in the double homicide of Rita and Richard Zajko. Authorities have since identified that person of interest as 32-year-old Michelle J. Zajko. Zajko allegedly bought two handguns in February 2024 that were used in the shooting that killedU.S. Border Patrol AgentDavid \"Chris\" Maland. The backstory: Pennsylvania State Police were called to a house on Highland Drive, in Chester Heights, on January 2, 2023, for a welfare check. When they arrived, they found 72-year-old Richard Zajko and his 69-year-old wife, Rita, dead, inside the home. During the investigation, it was determined the couple was killed in the home on December 31, 2022. The case has remained active with the PSP Media, Criminal Investigation Unit ever since. Related Weeks after the couple was found dead, Pennsylvania State Police troopers announced their beliefs that the double homicide was not a random act of violence. Dig deeper: In a motion filed Monday, U.S. Attorney Michael Drescher said Youngblut should be detained as the case proceeds due to the nature of the crime, the weight of evidence against her, her lack of ties to Vermont, and the danger she poses to the community. According to the motion, the gun used by Youngblut and one that Bauckholt was carrying were purchased by a third person in Vermont last February. The buyer is a person of interest in the double homicide of the Zajkos. And both Youngblut and the buyer \"are acquainted with and have been in frequent contact with\" someone who was detained during that investigation and who also is a person of interest in a homicide investigation in Vallejo, California, the motion said. What's next: The Pennsylvania State Police is requesting anyone with information regarding the investigations to contact PSP Tips at 1-800-4PA-TIPS (8477) oronline at their tip website, here. Individuals can also contact their local Pennsylvania State Police station, Criminal Investigation Unit.

        "content": "ARLINGTON, Va.-A midair collision between an Army helicopter and a passenger jet killed all 67 people aboard the two aircraft, officials said, as they search for answers in the nation's deadliest aviation disaster in nearly 25 years. At least 41 bodies have been recovered from the icy waters of the Potomac River after the helicopter reportedly crossed into the path of an American Airlines jet late Wednesday. The incident occurred as the jet was landing at Ronald Reagan National Airport, located just outside Washington, D.C. Federal investigators have cautioned that determining the cause of the crash could take months, and they refrained from speculating during a press briefing. Here is what we know about the collision: 2:30pm: Fire Chief John Donnelly and VP of Reagan National Airport Terry Liercke give an update on the DCA plane crash. D.C. Fire and EMS alongside the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority provided an update on the recovery efforts and progress two days after the deadly plane crash. Officials reported \"41 sets of remains have been recovered, and 28 victims have been positively identified.\" The recovery process continues. Officials mentioned the removal of the aircraft assisting in the recovery process and investigation. 12pm: Wednesday’s crash was similar to a deadly collision in 1949, when D.C.’s airspace was less crowded. A passenger plane on final approach to then Washington National Airport collided with a military plane, plunging both aircraft into the Potomac River, killing 55 people. At the time, it was the deadliest air crash in the U.S. 11:30am: Aviation experts have long worried that the airspace surrounding Washington, D.C. could lead to catastrophe. \"This was a disaster waiting to happen,\" said Ross Aimer, a retired United Airlines captain and chief executive officer of Aero Consulting Experts told the Associated Press. \"Those of us who have been around a long time have been yelling into a vacuum that something like this would happen because our systems are stretched to extremes.\" Officials said flight conditions were clear as the jet arrived from Wichita, Kansas. A Federal Aviation Administration report obtained by The Associated Press described staffing levels as \"not normal for the time of day and volume of traffic.\" 11:15am: Timothy Lilley, a former military helicopter pilot, confirmed that his28-year-old son, Sam Lilley, was one of the two pilots aboard the American Airlines flight. \"This is undoubtedly the worst day of my life,\" Timothy told FOX 5 Atlanta from Washington, D.C. Timothy, who was in New York for work, initially couldn't believe it was his son's flight. \"Last night when I saw on Fox News there was a crash in DC, I really didn't think there was any way that was my son,\" he said. However, after failing to hear from Sam, who always checked in, his worst fears were confirmed. The father and son shared a passion for flying, with Sam having started his flight training in 2019 and working with PSA Airlines, part of the American Airlines group, for two years. Sam was also engaged to be married. Sam Lilley 11:15am: Police boats were in the Potomac River on Friday as part of the recovery and investigation after a deadly midair collision killed 67 people Wednesday night. More than 40 bodies have been pulled from the river as the massive recovery effort continues. Crews worked in the rain Friday morning with wet conditions expected throughout the day. Planes continued to take off and land at Ronald Reagan National Airport next, with operations at the airfield gradually returning to normal after canceled and delayed flights following the crash. According to Reuters the FAA is restricting helicopter flights near DCA imposing significant limitations on Route 1 and Route 4 around the airport. 11am: The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration has restricted helicopter flights near Ronald Reagan National Airport indefinitely, according to the Associated Press. The news organization says the FAA is prohibiting most helicopters from portions of two helicopter routes near the airport. The report says only police and medical helicopters in the section between the airport and nearby bridges will be allowed at this time.

Recovery operations resumed on Friday morning amid rainy conditions. The plane carried  60 passengers and four crew members, and three soldiers were aboard the helicopter. Air crash investigations can take months, and federal investigators told reporters Thursday they would not speculate on the cause. 8:15am: President Donald Trump took to his social media platform, Truth Social, on Friday to post that the Black Hawk helicopter that collided with the American Airlines passenger jet near Ronald Reagan National Airport resulting in the deaths of everyone onboard \"was flying too high, by a lot.\" \"It was far above the 200-foot limit. That’s not really too complicated to understand, is it???\" Trump’s post continued. According toFOX Business, NTSB member Todd Inman, when asked by the news organization about whether the helicopter’s altitude played a role in the crash, said \"Right now, we've not ruled anything in or out.\" \"But I would be very careful to anyone who's listening to this to rely upon off the shelf software, speculation they're seeing online. Our job is to get the absolute facts as we get these [black] boxes in and get them analyzed and we look at more granular data, will be able to give a much better picture on that,\" he said.

READ MORE:Two planes aborted landings at DCA due to helicopters in flight path in week before crash: report 6am: A collision involving a regional jet from Wichita, Kansas, and a military helicopter on a training exercise killed all aboard both aircraft, officials said. The skies were clear at the time. The Federal Aviation Administration reported that moments before American Airlines Flight 5342 was to land, air traffic controllers requested the jet to land on a shorter runway, to which the pilots agreed. Flight tracking sites indicated the plane adjusted its approach accordingly. Less than 30 seconds before the crash, an air traffic controller asked the helicopter if it had visual contact with the jet, and the military pilot confirmed. A subsequent radio call from the controller directed the helicopter to \"pass behind the CRJ,\" apparently advising it to wait for the Bombardier CRJ-701 twin-engine jet to pass. The helicopter did not respond, and the aircraft collided seconds later.

Federal investigators will now try to piece together the moments before the collision. The plane's radio transponder ceased transmitting approximately 2,400 feet short of the runway, near the middle of the Potomac River. Officials stated that the plane's body was discovered upside-down in three sections in waist-deep water. The helicopter's wreckage was also located in the river. National Transportation Safety Board investigators have recovered the cockpit voice recorder and flight data recorder from the plane, said agency spokesperson Peter Knudson. 5:30am: Among the passengers were members of the Skating Club of Boston, returning from a development camp that followed the 2025 U.S. Figure Skating Championships in Wichita. Club CEO Doug Zeghibe confirmed that 14 people from the skating community were on the plane, including teenage figure skaters Jinna Han and Spencer Lane, their mothers, and two Russian-born coaches, Evgenia Shishkova and Vadim Naumov, who won a world championship in pairs skating in 1994. The victims also included an Ohio college student returning from her grandfather's funeral and a group of hunters coming back from a guided trip in Kansas. Three students from Fairfax County, Virginia, and six parents from the district were also on board, according to Superintendent Michelle Reid. It was the deadliest U.S. air crash since 2001. At least 28 bodies have been pulled from the icy waters, including those of the three soldiers who were on the helicopter.

The Chinese Embassy in Washington reported that two Chinese nationals were among the victims. Jonathan Campos, 34, was identified as the captain of the airplane, multiple media outlets reported. Jonathan Koziol, chief of staff for Army aviation, described the helicopter crew as \"very experienced\" and familiar with the congested flying conditions around Washington. While their identities have not been officially released, the wife of one of the helicopter pilots, Andrew Eaves of Noxubee County, Mississippi, announced on Facebook that her husband was among those killed.

        "source": "https://www.fox29.com/",
        "content": "President Donald Trump used an address Thursday to the World Economic Forum to promise lower taxes to global business leaders if they bring manufacturing to the United States. Trump also threatened to impose tariffs if they do not. LiveNOW's Austin Westfall breaks down Trump's message with Sandra Swirksi, founder and CEO of Interger. WASHINGTON-President Donald Trump announced that 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico will go into effect on Saturday, but he has not yet decided whether to include oil imports in the measure. Speaking from the Oval Office on Thursday, Trump said he would make the determination by the end of the night, basing his decision on whether he believes the two trading partners are charging the U.S. a \"fair\" price for oil. While the tariffs were framed as a response to illegal immigration and fentanyl-related concerns, extending them to oil could impact gas prices and inflation. The move comes despite Trump’s previous campaign promise to cut energy costs in half within a year of taking office. Trump’s threat to include oil in the new tariffs has raised concerns about rising gas prices, a key issue for voters. Canada and Mexico are major oil suppliers to the U.S., with Canada alone accounting for nearly 4.6 million barrels per day in October 2024, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. The potential tariffs could lead to increased costs for refineries that rely on Canadian and Mexican crude, possibly pushing gas prices higher. On Thursday, U.S. oil prices were trading at approximately $73 per barrel, well below the peak of over $120 per barrel in 2022, but industry experts warn that tariffs could drive prices up. What they're saying: Matthew Holmes, executive vice president at the Canadian Chamber of Commerce, criticized the move, warning that tariffs on Canadian oil would ultimately hurt American consumers. \"This is a lose-lose,\" Holmes told the Associated Press. \"We will keep working with partners to show President Trump and Americans that this doesn’t make life any more affordable. It makes life more expensive and sends our integrated businesses scrambling.\" Trump, however, dismissed concerns over price increases, insisting the U.S. does not rely on imports.

We have all the trees you need, meaning the lumber.\" By the numbers: Why you should care: The new tariffs, particularly if extended to oil, could have a direct impact on everyday consumers. Increased costs for imported crude oil could lead to higher gasoline prices, despite Trump’s campaign promise to cut energy prices in half. Additionally, the move could strain relations with Canada and Mexico, two of the U.S.’s closest trading partners, and spark retaliatory trade measures that could affect other sectors beyond energy.

        "content": "Share Three of President Donald Trump’s cabinet picks finished their confirmation hearings on Thursday. Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Tulsi Gabbard and Kash Patel were questioned by Democratic senators. Republicans as well as Democrats criticized President Donald Trump’s pick for national intelligence director, condemning Tulsi Gabbard for previous comments sympathetic to Russia, for meeting with Syria’s now-deposed leader and for supporting government leaker Edward Snowden, the Associated Press reported. Gabbard said years of failures by America’s intelligence services require big changes. She said false or politicized intelligence has led to wars, foreign policy failures and the misuse of espionage. \"The bottom line is this must end,\" she said. Gabbard has won praise in Russian state-controlled media by echoing Russian propaganda justifying the Kremlin’s invasion of Ukraine. Republicans accused her of spreading Russian disinformation. Kansas Republican Jerry Moran wanted to know: Would Russia \"get a pass\" from her? Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s long record of questioning the safety of childhood vaccinations could jeopardize his confirmation for health secretary. If all the Democrats rejected Kennedy’s nomination, he could only afford to lose three Republicans. According to the Associated Press, when Kennedy refused Thursday to freject a long-discredited theory that vaccines cause autism, despite years of studies and research that have found they do not, it clearly troubled Health Committee chairman Bill Cassidy. Cassidy is a Louisiana Republican and liver doctor who has regularly encouraged his constituents to vaccinate against COVID-19 and other diseases. \"If there’s any false note, any undermining of a mama’s trust in vaccines, another person will die from a vaccine preventable disease,\" Cassidy said. Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s hearing ended following a heated exchange with Sen. Bernie Sanders. Sanders questioned Kennedy on his views on vaccines. Kennedy fired back saying that members of Congress, including Sanders, were receiving money from pharmaceutical companies, according to the Associated Press. The line drew cheers and applause from Kennedy’s supporters in the room. Sanders responded that he doesn’t take money from organizations or groups that represent the drug-making industry. What they're saying: Kash Patel said \"I’m going to let the cops be cops and put handcuffs on the bad guys and put child molesters in prison and put murderers in prison,\" Patel told lawmakers when asked what his plans for the bureau are. The Associated Press reported that Patel wrote in a Wall Street Journal op-ed published this week that \"violent crime is destroying families across the nation.\" There has been little discussion of national security issues throughout the hearing, which focused on Patel’s past comments. That’s despite a heightened threat of international terrorism and an FBI investigation into a massive breach by Chinese hackers of American telecommunications companies. Democratic Sen. Adam Schiff called on Kash Patel to turn around and face the Capitol police officers in the hearing room. It came as Schiff was criticizing Patel for producing a song featuring President Trump and a choir of jailed Jan. 6 defendants to help raise money for the families of those charged in the Capitol riot. \"If you have the courage to, look them in the eye, Mr. Patel. And tell them you’re proud of what you did. Tell them you’re proud that you raised money off of people that assaulted their colleagues, that pepper sprayed them, that beat them with poles,\" Schiff said the AP reported. Patel fired back: \"That’s an abject lie, you know it. I never, never, ever accepted violence against law enforcement.\" Robert F. Kennedy Jr. had his second of two confirmation hearings for his Health and Human Services Secretary nomination. He will appear before the Health Committee a day after his hearing before the Finance Committee. The Associated Press reported that at Wednesday’s Senate Finance Committee, it was Republican Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, who challenged Kennedy the most. RELATED:Who is RFK Jr.'s wife? Cheryl Hines seen at Senate confirmation hearing Tulsi Gabbard, former US Representative from Hawaii and President Donald Trump's nominee to be director of National Intelligence, during a Senate Intelligence Committee confirmation hearing in Washington, DC, US, on Thursday, Jan. 30, 2025. (Daniel H When asking him to detail his plans for Medicare and Medicaid, Kennedy responded with few answers and misstated some basic facts about how the federally funded programs work and how many people they serve. Cassidy’s vote is crucial for Kennedy since he also serves on the finance committee that will decide whether the health secretary nominee makes it to the Senate floor. Tulsi Gabbard, President Donald Trump’s pick to be director of national intelligence, is expected to face questions from the Senate Intelligence Committee over past comments about Russia and a 2017 visit with Syria’s now-deposed leader, the Associated Press reported. RELATED:Kristi Noem faces Senate confirmation hearing Gabbard unsuccessfully sought the 2020 presidential nomination and left the party in 2022. Gabbard endorsed Trump in August and campaigned often with him. She served in the Army National Guard for more than two decades and was deployed to Iraq and Kuwait. Kash Patel was selected by Trump to lead the FBI and may face questions from Democratic senators Thursday about his loyalty to Trump and stated desire to overhaul the bureau. The backstory: Once President Donald Trump nominates his picks for various positions, they are then presented to the appropriate Senate committee. The committee would then vote to recommend a candidate to the full Senate. The full Senate will debate. Trump's picks will either be confirmed or rejected by a simple majority. If they are approved, they are then sworn in. Republicans currently hold 53 seats in the Senate, which could suggest many of Trump's picks will be confirmed without issue.

The Bombardier CRJ-701 twin-engine jet, manufactured in 2004, can carry up to 70 passengers. Minutes before landing, air traffic controllers asked the arriving jet if it could land on the shorter Runway 33. The pilots confirmed they could, and controllers cleared the plane to land. Flight tracking data showed the plane adjusting its approach to the new runway. Less than 30 seconds before the collision, an air traffic controller asked the helicopter if it had the jet in sight. Moments later, the controller radioed the helicopter again: \"PAT 25 pass behind the CRJ.\" Seconds later, the two aircraft collided. The plane's transponder stopped transmitting about 2,400 feet short of the runway, roughly over the middle of the river.

This is a bad situation that looks like it should have been prevented. NOT GOOD!!!\" He followed that post with another that read, \"What a terrible night this has been.

        "content": " TRENTON-A New Jersey couple who are both police officers are facing disturbing allegations of creating child sexual abuse material and distributing the explicit images online. Prosecutors did not name the man and woman, who they say work as law enforcement officers in different police departments within Mercer County. Investigators say the husband allegedly uploaded over 30 explicit images of his wife in the presence of children, and made other disturbing claims in an online chat. What we know: Investigators in Mercer County on Tuesday acted on a tip from the National Center of Missing and Exploited Children that claimed an mobile messaging platform user uploaded and distributed possible child sexual abuse material. The Mercer County Prosecutor's Office said the user allegedly distributed over 30 media files that contained naked images of his wife in the presence of children. In an online chat exchange, the husband allegedly mentioned that children were present while he and his wife had sex. The husband and wife are both law enforcement officers in different departments in Mercer County, according to prosecutors. The husband has been charged with several crimes, including first degree causing or permitting a child to engage in a sexual act that may be photographed, videoed, or reproduced. The wife was charged with second degree engaging in sexual conduct that would debauch the morals of a child. What they're saying: New Jersey Attorney General Matthew Platkin called the allegations \"disturbing\" in a press release shared Thursday night. \"Sexual offenses against children are among the most serious crimes we charged,\" Platkin said. \"It's especially disturbing when, as in this case, the accused are members of law enforcement.\" Department of Criminal Justice Director Theresa L. Hilton said the allegations could cause \"immeasurable harm to the victims.\" The Hamilton Police Department said one of the officers in the ongoing investigation worked for the department, but did not identify if it was the husband or wife. The department said the officer is being suspended and served with a notice of termination. \"The off-duty allegations made against this officer do not reflect the values of this agency or of the dedicated and hard-working men and women who put their lives on the line every day for the citizens of Hamilton Township to keep you safe,\" a statement read. What's next: Prosecutors say the first-degree charges can carry a sentence of 10 to 20 years in state prison, and a fine up to $200K. Second and third degree charges can result in 3-10 years in state prison and fines up to $150K.

PHILADELPHIA-A Montgomery County inmate is accused of recruiting a man to help him use Instagram to find someone to kill the mother of his child, prosecutors said Thursday. Zunir Wilson-Walker, 22, and Jadan Uriah Jones, 20, were both charged with multiple crimes in the alleged murder-for-hire plot that prison officials caught wind of. Investigators believe in November Walker-Wilson offered $15,000, a Cartier watch, and a car as payment for carrying out the murder of his child's mother. What we know: Investigators suspected the murder-for-hire plot after reviewing a phone conversation that Wilson-Walker alleged used another inmates phone account to make. Wilson-Walker asked Jones to make a fake Instagram account and create a story that offered $15,000, a Cartier watch, and a vehicle for \"beating up and killing the mother of his child.\" It's alleged that Wilson-Walker instructed Jones to use the Instagram story function to avoid attracting attention from police and others. Investigators said Walker-Wilson had lost his phone privileges for verbally abusing and threatening the mother of his child. He also had his prison-issued tablet revoked after investigators say he sent eight harassing and threatening messages to the same woman, which violated a Protection From Abuse Order. Jones is accused of creating an Instagram account called \"walkdownmontt\" and posting a series of stories that investigators say included derogatory comments about the woman, as well as her location information. The posts offered $15K, jewelry, and a car to get Wilson-Walker's former girlfriend \"took off the map.\" What's next: Both men were charged with criminal solicitation of first-degree murder, conspiracy to murder, and criminal use of communication facility. Wilson-Walker was also charged with terroristic threats, stalking, simple assault, strangulation and other charges related to the victim. Wilson-Walker is being held on over $500K bail, and Jones had his bail set at $99K.

WASHINGTON-Military helicopter flights forced at least two planes to abort landings atReagan National Airportin the week before a deadly collision presumably killed 67 people on Wednesday, according to a report. On Tuesday night, just one day before the collision between an American Airlines flight and an Army Black Hawk helicopter, a different plane alerted the air traffic control tower that it had to abort its landing to avoid collision with a helicopter,the Washington Post reported. Yet another plane arriving at DCA from Charlotte scrubbed its landing on Jan. 23, again because of a helicopter. \"They had to circle back around because there was a helicopter in the flight path,\" said Richard Hart, a passenger on the Jan. 23 flight who spoke to the Washington Post. \"At the time I found it odd. ... Now I find it disturbingly tragic.\" LIVE UPDATES: DC PLANE CRASH INVESTIGATORS RECOVER AMERICAN AIRLINES BLACK BOXES AFTER MIDAIR COLLISION Crews retrieve wreckage of American Airlines flight 5342 on the Potomac River, Washington, D.C., on Jan. 30, 2025. The plane was involved in a fatal collision with a U.S. Army Black Hawk helicopter the previous night. (Leigh Green for Fox News Digita The two close calls came within a week of Wednesday's horrifying collision, in which an inbound commercial flight from Wichita, Kansas, collided with a military helicopter over the Potomac River. A total of 64 people, including four crew members, were aboard passenger American Airlines Flight 5342, and three soldiers were on theArmy Sikorsky UH-60 Black Hawkthat came from Fort Belvoir in Virginia. All are presumed dead. The tragedy has raised concerns about frequent military training flights around Reagan National Airport, including a helicopter lane that intersects with the flight path of aircraft on the southeastern approach to Runway 33, where American Eagle Flight 5342 from Wichita attempted to land Wednesday, the Post reported. The Federal Aviation Administration has placed an air traffic controller dedicated to helicopters in the National Airport tower to manage the hazards, the report said, citing a source familiar with tower operations. However, an internal preliminary report from the FAA showed that the number of staff members working at the air control tower at DCA was \"not normal for the time of day and volume of traffic\" on Wednesday, the Associated Press reported. \"The position configuration was not normal for the time of day and volume of traffic,\" the report said. DC PLANE CRASH TIMELINE: MIDAIR COLLISION INVOLVES 67 PASSENGERS, CREW MEMBERS, SOLDIERS Graphic shows a timeline of the plane crash near Reagan National Airport near Washington, D.C. (Fox News) Despite the report saying the staffing was \"not normal,\" a person familiar with the matter told Fox News Digital that staffing in the control tower at DCA on Wednesday night was at a normal level. The person explained that the positions get combined regularly if air controllers have to step away from the console for breaks, or if they are involved in a shift change. Controllers may also have to step away when air traffic is slow, the person explained, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss internal procedures. Supervisors have the ability to combine roles, which was the case on Wednesday night, though the person familiar with the matter could not say why. When asked about the air traffic and previous reports of it being heavy on Wednesday night, the source said it was moderate. The Washington Post story cited a 2023 Government Accountability Office report to Congress that found 50 entities operated roughly 88,000 helicopter flights within 30 miles of DCA between 2017 and 2019, citing FAA data.

(ANDREW CABALLERO-REYNOLDS/AFP via Getty Images) Regulators have attempted to define safe paths for military helicopters to fly without interfering with commercial flights landing or taking off at the airport. A 2021 GAO report noted, \"in airspace near Reagan National and the Potomac River, FAA further limits the maximum altitudes for helicopters where helicopter routes overlap with commercial passenger airplane operations to ensure the safety of all aircraft.\" On Wednesday night, air traffic controllers had contacted the Black Hawk pilot and asked whether he could see the approaching commercial aircraft as Flight 5342 prepared to land on Runway 33. \"Do you have the CRJ in sight?\" the controller asked, and the helicopter pilot confirmed he saw the passenger plane. The pilot requested \"visual separation,\" meaning he was trying to get out of the flight's path, according to FlightRadar24 audio. The plane and helicopter collided moments later in a fiery explosion. DC PLANE CRASH LIKELY ‘COMBINATION’ OF FACTORS, ‘LUCKY’ THERE HAVEN'T BEEN MORE AIR ACCIDENTS: ATTORNEY A general view of Reagan National Airport in Arlington, Virginia on Thursday, January 30, 2025. An American Airlines flight from Wichita, Kansas collided with a Black Hawk helicopter while approaching the airport for landing the previous evening. (Le Jim Brauchle, a former U.S. Air Force navigator who is now an attorney representing families of victims in aviation disasters, previously told Fox News Digital that keeping a lookout for obstacles can be difficult. \"Having flown at night, having tried to look and see traffic, I think most people would say, ‘Oh, how hard is it to miss an airliner,’ right? You should be able to see that. But it's a lot more difficult than people would expect,\" he said. At night in an urban environment likeWashington, D.C.,or northern Virginia, pilots may not be able to see other aircraft and instead may rely on seeing anti-collision or landing lights, according to Brauchle. But different ambient lights from tall buildings and towers that are lit may make it difficult to distinguish which lights belong to other aircraft. \"What I've heard from the audio is that they called out to [air traffic control]. The helicopter said that he had the aircraft in sight,\" the attorney said. \"My guess is, and again, I'm just speculating, is they saw something that they thought was the airplane, whether it be a tower light, maybe it was another aircraft that was taking off. Whatever they thought they saw obviously wasn't the aircraft.\" Former Navy pilot Kegan Gill joined FOX 5's D.C. team to discuss the deadly collision. The cause of the collision is currently under investigation by the FAA and several other federal agencies. The close call on Tuesday, the evening before the deadly collision, involved Republic Airways Flight 4514 from Connecticut, the Washington Post reported. The pilot told air traffic controllers it had to divert because of an emergency alert about helicopter traffic below the aircraft. Flight tracker maps showed the plane was headed south along the Potomac River corridor towards Reagan National Airport but took a sharp turn to the west. It later landed safely at 8:16 p.m., the report said. LINK:GET MORE ON THIS STORY FROM FOX NEWS Fox News Digital's Audrey Conklin, Greg Wehner and Stephen Sorace contributed to this report.

WASHINGTON, D.C.-It is being reported that staffing was \"not normal\" in the air traffic control tower at Reagan National Airport during the time of the deadly plane crash on Wednesday night. What we know: In a recent report by the Federal Aviation Administration obtained by The Associated Press, one air traffic controller was working two positions at the time of the crash. \"The position configuration was not normal for the time of day and volume of traffic,\" the report says. Although, the official cause of the crash has not yet been determined. WASHINGTON, DC- JANUARY 30:  Emergency response units search the crash site of the American Airlines plane on the Potomac River after the plane crashed on approach to Reagan National Airport on January 30, 2025 in Washington, DC. The American Airlines flight from Wichita, Kansas collided in midair with a military helicopter while approaching the airport. According to reports, there were no survivors amongst the 67 people on board both aircraft. (Photo by Kayla Bartkowski/Getty Images) The backstory: The American Airlines jet had 60 passengers and four crew members on board. Three soldiers were aboard the helicopter. According to officials, the helicopter apparently flew into the flight path of the plane while it was landing at the airport on Wednesday evening around 9 p.m. The crash triggered a major search-and-rescue operation in the icy Potomac River. Dozens of bodies were recovered from the waters during the overnight hours. The plane's fuselage was found upside down and broken into three sections in waist-deep water. The wreckage of the helicopter was also located. If the casualty numbers hold, this incident could become the deadliest U.S. air crash in nearly 24 years. The National Transportation and Safety Board provide updates on their investigation into the DCA plane crash. What they're saying: NTSB officials stated during a press conference that their main focus is on recovering the bodies of the victims. NTSB board member Todd Inman also stated that a preliminary report on the crash will be released within 30 days. \"Our mission is to understand not just what happened but why it happened, and to recommend changes to prevent it from happening again,\" said Inman. President Donald Trump, Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, and Vice President JD Vance give updates on the deadly plane crash at DCA. What they're saying: During a press conference around 11: 21 a.m., President Trump entered the press room asking for a moment of silence for the victims. The president went on to provide updates on the search, switching to a recovery mission. \"There are no survivors,\" he said. \"As one nation, we grieve for every precious soul that has been taken from us so suddenly,\" Trump said. He also noted that other nations are also grieving for foreign nationals from those countries who were also on the plane. \"We are in mourning.\" He said the U.S. military and the National Transportation Safety Board is investigating. \"We’ll find out how this disaster occurred and will ensure that nothing like this ever happens again,\" he said. The president said he was naming Chris Rocheleau, a 22-year FAA veteran, as acting commissioner to the Federal Aviation Administration. \"The FAA is actively recruiting workers who suffer severe intellectual disabilities, psychiatric problems, and other mental and physical conditions under a diversity and inclusion hiring initiative spelled out on the agency’s website,\" said Trump, noting that the program allowed for the hiring of people with hearing and vision issues as well as paralysis, epilepsy and \"dwarfism.\" Trump said air traffic controllers need to be geniuses.

We have had a much higher standard than anybody else. And there are things that you have to go by brain power, you have to go by psychological quality, and psychological quality is a very important element of it. These are various very powerful tests that we put to use, and they were terminated by Biden, and Biden went by a standard that is the exact opposite.\" Trump went on to say that for an air traffic controller \"we want the brightest, the smartest, the sharpest, we want somebody that is psychologically superior, and that's what we are going to have.\" The Source:Information in this article comes from the Associated Press and FOX 5 reporting.

This week saw a number ofexecutive orders from President Donald Trump, fieryconfirmation hearingsfor his cabinet nominees, and of course thetragic midair collisioninvolving an Army helicopter and passenger jet. Friday, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt held her secondbriefingof the new administration at 1 p.m. ET. President Trump will then sign more executive orders at 3 p.m., according to the White House daily schedule. It’s not yet clear what the orders will be, though tariffs on Canada and Mexico have been a hot topic for the president this week. You can watch these events in the player above, and refresh this story for updates. U.S. President Donald Trump talks to reporters from the Resolute Desk after signing an executive order to appoint the deputy administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration in the Oval Office at the White House on January 30, 2025 in Washington, 3:30 p.m. ET:The remains of 41 people had been pulled from the river as of Friday afternoon, including 28 that had been positively identified, Washington, D.C., Fire Chief John Donnelly Sr. said at a news conference. He said next of kin notifications had been made to 18 families, and that he expects the remains of all 67 people who died to eventually be recovered. The wreckage of the plane's fuselage will probably have to be pulled from the water to get all the bodies, he said. \"This is heartbreaking work,\" Donnelly said, noting that more than 300 responders were taking part in the effort at any one time, including teams of divers and two U.S. Coast Guard cutters, at least one of which carries a crane. \"It’s been a tough response for a lot of our people.\" It was unclear how long the recovery operation would take. Although Ronald Reagan National Airport has reopened, two of its three runways remain closed to keep aircraft from flying over the crash scene while taking off or landing, said Terry Liercke, the airport's vice president and manager. Roughly 100 flights were canceled Friday. 3:20 p.m. ET:Trump administration officials are moving to fire FBI agents engaged ininvestigations involving President Donald Trump in the coming days, two people familiar with the plans said Friday. It was not clear how many agents might be affected, though scores of investigators were involved in various inquiries touching Trump. Officials acting at the direction of the administration have been working to identify individual employees who participated in politically sensitive investigations for possible termination, said the people who insisted on anonymity to discuss private conversations. 1:45 p.m. ET:Leavitt said the White House applauded the release of 8 additional hostages from Hamas captivity. \"Thanks to the ceasefire deal secured by President Trump, 3 Israeli and 5 Thai Nationals are being reunited with their families and their loved ones after being held in unspeakable conditions, for over 15 months, and the president remains committed to the release of all remaining hostages, and they should have never been taken by the brutal terrorist group Hamas in the first place,\" she stated. 1:40 p.m. ET:\"When you are flying on an airplane with your loved ones, which every one of us in this room has, do you pray that that your plane lands safely and gets you to your destination or do you pray that the pilot has a certain skin color? I think we all know the answer to that question, and as President Trump said yesterday, it's common sense,\" Leavitt said. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt addresses President Donald Trump and the administration's response to the deadly mid-air collision over the Potomac River outside of Reagan National Airport. Since taking office on Jan. 20, U.S., Trump has issued a series of executive orders aimed at dismantling diversity, equity and inclusion programs. Trump also began his White House briefing Thursday with a moment of silence and a prayer for victims ofWednesday’s crash at Reagan National Airport. But his remarks quickly became a diatribe against diversity hiring and that lowered standards may have been to blame for the crash. 1:30 p.m. ET:\"I can confirm that tomorrow, the February 1 deadline that President Trump put into place, that a statement several weeks ago continues, the president will be implementing tomorrow a 25% tariffs on Mexico, 25% tariffs on Canada and a 10% tariff on China,\" Leavitt said. She continued: \"At this point, the president has made it very clear those tariffs are going to be implemented. And in effect, if the president at any time decides to roll back those tariffs, I'll leave it to him to make that decision. But starting tomorrow, those tariffs will be in place.\" 1:14 p.m. ET:Leavitt said President Trump wants to increase Federal Aviation Administration standards following the tragic plane crash near Washington D.C. on Wednesday. She said that Trump said that the helicopter was flying higher than the plane should have been, but she noted that the investigation was still ongoing. 1:07 p.m. ET:At Friday's White House press briefing, press secretary Leavitt said the White House received more than 10,000 submissions for its open media seats. These seats were opened Friday for Ruthless Podcast, which covers political news and is hosted by Josh Holmes and Michael Duncan. 12:45 p.m. ET:Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth says investigators have not yet recovered a key recording device from the Army helicopter involved in Wednesday’s fatal collision at Ronald Reagan National Airport, AP says. Speaking on Fox News Channel on Friday, Hegseth noted authorities were still looking for the helicopter’s black box. Other factors in the crash, including the helicopter’s altitude and whether the crew was using its night vision goggles, are still under investigation, Hegseth said. 12:15 p.m. ET:President Donald Trump took to his social media platform, Truth Social, on Friday to post that the Black Hawk helicopter that collided with the American Airlines passenger jet near Ronald Reagan National Airport resulting in the deaths of everyone onboard \"was flying too high, by a lot.\" \"It was far above the 200-foot limit.

        "content": "Share US Senator Ron Wyden (D-OR) questioned Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. on his stance of vaccines and whether he is anti-vax. WASHINGTON-Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is facing Senate committees this week for his confirmation hearing to be the next Heath and Human Services secretary. Kennedy appeared first on Wednesday before the Finance Committee, one of two committees with jurisdiction over HHS, and again on Thursday before the Health Committee. Kennedy's confirmation is far from certain in the Senate, where he is expected to face pointed questioning from both Republicans and Democrats on the chamber's health and finance committees. Kennedy’s nomination alarmed people who are concerned about his record of spreading unfounded fears about vaccines. He has long advanced the debunked idea that vaccines cause autism. Caroline Kennedy urged the U.S. Senate in a Tuesday letter to reject the nomination of her cousin to be President Donald Trump's health secretary,calling him a \"predator.\" Caroline Kennedy wrote a scathing letter Tuesday encouraging the U.S. Senate to deny the nomination of her cousin, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., to be President Donald Trump's health secretary. In the letter to senators obtained by the Associated Press, she called Robert F. Kennedy Jr. a \"predator\" who is addicted to power. Ms. Kennedy said in the letter that her cousin’s views on vaccines are disqualifying. She offered senators personal details from their lives growing up together that she said pose an even greater concern. Kennedy ran for president as a Democrat, then as an independent, before he dropped out and endorsed PresidentDonald Trump. The backstory: Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is the son of Democratic icon Robert F. Kennedy, who was assassinated in 1968 during his own presidential campaign. The 71-year-old, whose famous name and family tragedies have put him in the national spotlight since he was a child, has spent years airing his populist — and sometimes extreme — views in podcasts, TV interviews and speeches, building his own quixotic brand. PREVIOUS:Trump expected to nominate RFK Jr. for health secretary Kennedy's numerous remarks, anti-vaccine nonprofit and lawsuits against immunizations are likely to haunt him. RELATED:McConnell slams polio vaccine critics in apparent warning to RFK Jr. He's rejected the anti-vaccine label, instead casting himself as a crusader for \"medical freedom\" who wants more research. He and Trump have vowed not to \"take away\" vaccines. To defuse criticism, he resigned from the Children’s Health Defense, his nonprofit that has filed dozens of lawsuits against vaccines, including government authorizations of some of them. In his opening statement Wednesday, Kennedy rejected the ‘anti-vaccine’ label, telling senators he’s not anti-vaccine but has asked \"uncomfortable questions.\" While Kennedy has called vaccines unsafe, in his opening remarks he said all of his children are vaccinated. \"I believe that vaccines play a critical role in health care,\" Kennedy told the committee. Dig deeper: Other conservatives have questioned Kennedy's abortion views, after he said last year that it should be legal for full-term pregnancies. His campaign later clarified that he supports abortion rights until fetal viability, around 22 to 24 weeks. In meetings with some senators, he promised to follow Trump's directive on the issue. Republican Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri, for example, said he was convinced after talking to Kennedy that he would be a strong anti-abortion advocate. But skepticism remains, with Pence's advocacy group highlighting his abortion views in an ad campaign. \"RFK Jr. has made certain overtures to pro-life leaders that he would be mindful of their concerns at HHS, there is little reason for confidence at this time,\" his group said in a letter sent to senators last week. In Iowa, Kennedy's nomination both excites and worries corn and soybean farmer Brian Fyre. The sixth-generation farmer and Republican thinks Kennedy will offer a fresh perspective, but he also can't afford the ban on corn syrup or pesticides that Kennedy has promised. If confirmed, Kennedy would oversee the Food and Drug Administration, which has the power to enact restrictions. Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson, a Republican from a dairy farm state, sees it differently, telling a crowd at the Heritage Foundation last month that Kennedy's agriculture ideas are a promising part of a bigger goal: \"to Make America Healthy Again.\" Big picture view: Health and Human Services has a broad reach across the lives of Americans, including inspecting the nation’s food, regulating medicines and overseeing research of diseases and cures. It provides health insurance for nearly half of the country — poor, disabled and older Americans, including via Medicare. FROM THE ARCHIVES: LiveNOW from FOX host Christy Matino spoke to Dr. Richard Besser, president and CEO of Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and former acting director of the CDC, about RFK Jr.'s nomination. What's next: After Trump nominates his picks for various positions, they are then presented to the appropriate Senate committee. The committee then votes whether to recommend a candidate to the full Senate. The full Senate will debate. Trump's picks will either be confirmed or rejected by a simple majority. If they are approved, they are then sworn-in. Republicans currently hold 53 seats in the Senate, which could suggest many of Trump's picks will be confirmed without issue.

        "title": "An Abington college student died after being extorted on Instagram and Snapchat. His family blames the social platforms.",
        "source": "https://www.inquirer.com/",
        "content": "A lawsuit filed by Jack Sullivan’s parents says the social media companies facilitated the crime through their platforms and failed to remove predatory accounts. Eighteen hours after Jack Sullivan received an Instagram message from a user who called themselves Alice Dave, he was dead. The 20-year-old Kutztown University sophomore was watching a movie, his father next to him on the couch intheirAbingtonhome, when the young, strange woman sparked a flirtatious conversation. The two exchanged messages, and later intimate photos on Snapchat — the app infamous for disappearing messages. But later on that January 2023 night, Alice’s flirty texts were replaced with threats that if Sullivan didn’t send money, she would share the photos with his family, friends, and campus community. “all u have to do is cooperate with me and i will not expose u, if you block me i will ruin your life,” Alice wrote, according to law enforcement records. “don’t try to act smart I know where you live.” By the following afternoon, Sullivan transferred roughly $2,800, court records show. But his extortionist refused to delete the photos. Less than 24 hours after the first message, Sullivan walked onto train tracks leading to theJenkintownSEPTAstation.He paced on the tracks for a few minutes as Alice demanded more payments. “I don’t even think I have enough for it,” he wrote. Three minutes later a passing train struck and killed him. Sullivan’s death was originally ruled a suicide, but the coroner’s office in Montgomery County changed the cause of death to homicide once details of the events leading up to it became clear. Sullivanwas a victim of an online sexual extortion, orsextortion, scheme. Federal law enforcement has been prosecuting two Nigerian men, Imoleayo Samuel Aina and Samuel Olasunkanmi Abiodun, in connection with Alice’s account and Sullivan’s death. Amid the criminal prosecution, Sullivan’s parents filed a civil lawsuit against the social media companies that they said facilitated the crime through their platforms and failed to remove predatory accounts. The December complaint, filed in Common Pleas Court in Philadelphia, accuses Meta — which owns Facebook and Instagram — and Snap Inc. — which owns Snapchat — of deliberately creating addictive platforms without protecting vulnerable users. “They gave these individuals the tools, the environment, the platform, the algorithm, and the pool of victims to commit their crimes,” said Kevin O’Brien, an attorney with Stampone O’Brien Dilsheimer Holloway who represents the family. The lawsuit is the latest against tech giants as lawmakers and judges struggle to determine whether social media platforms are neutral publishers of third-party content or products that can be held liable for harm they cause. “Sextortion is a horrific crime,” a spokesperson for Meta said. “We work aggressively to fight it, disrupting networks of scammers and supporting law enforcement in investigating and prosecuting them.” Snap Inc. did not respond to a request for comment. The lawsuit also names SEPTA, and businesses that own the land leading to the tracks, as defendants. A spokesperson for SEPTA declined to comment on the litigation but said the agency’s investigation found the train engineer reacted appropriately. When Jim Sullivan, Jack Sullivan’s father, received the call that his son was found dead on the train tracks, he was shocked and set out to piece together his son’s last hours, ultimately learning of the threats from his son’s phone. He reached out to Alice, who responded with more threats. “So we very clearly understood exactly what had happened,” Jim Sullivan said. Jim Sullivan worked with law enforcement to identify the people who extorted his son, and Aina and Abiodun wereextraditedin August to face charges of cyberstalking resulting in death, extortion, and wire fraud, and other offenses. » READ MORE:What is Sextortion and how can you help prevent it? | Expert Opinion Abiodun has pleaded guilty to wire fraud and conspiracy to commit money laundering, and awaits sentencing. Aina’s prosecution is ongoing. Their attorneys did not respond to requests for comment. The U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania declined to comment. Both men are allegedly associated with a network of mostly Nigerian scammers known as “Yahoo Boys,” originally named for the use of Yahoo email accounts. Sextortion incidents have increased in recent years, the FBI says. Perpetrators most commonly target boys ages 14 to 17, and the agency received more than 13,000 reports of sextortion between October 2021 and March 2023 that led to at least 20 deaths. In August, Levi Maciejewski, the 13-year-old son of the head football coach at Shippensburg University in Cumberland County, died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound after he was preyed on in a sextortion scheme,PennLive reported. “This can happen to anybody,” Jim Sullivan said. The Sullivans’ lawsuit goes to the heart of an ongoing debate over harms of social media use — especially for young people — and the legal responsibilities of tech companies. As many as 95% of American teens are on social media platforms, and a third report using them “almost constantly,”according to research cited in a 2023 advisory by the U.S. Surgeon General’s Office. Teens who spend more than three hours a day on social media platforms have double the risk of depression and anxiety, and half of teens report that social media makes them feel worse about the way they look, according to the advisory. Children and teens on social media are also exposed to “challenges” that can promote risky behavior. For example, a 10-year-old Chester girl, Nylah Anderson,died in 2021 while attempting the “blackout challenge,”a viralTikToktrend that encouraged children to use household items to choke themselves. The mental health harms, risky challenges, and scams have led to lawsuits by parents nationwide. And courts have been struggling to apply laws that were written before the advent of social media to the reality of complex algorithms and personalized feeds. So far, the U.S. Supreme Court has found thatsocial media platforms are not liable when bad actors use their algorithm. For example, the courtheld in 2023that social media companies were not aiding and abetting terrorism when their algorithms recommended ISIS-related content and their platforms were used for recruitment. “If the Mafia uses the phones, AT&T is not responsible if the godfather places a hit on someone,” said Amanda Shanor, a professor of legal studies and business ethics at the Wharton School of Business at the University of Pennsylvania, in explaining the rationale for these decisions. » READ MORE:A Delco mom can sue TikTok for her daughter’s death during a ‘blackout challenge,’ federal appeals court rules But what many lawsuits — including the Sullivans’ complaint — argue is that the platform addicted users, increasing their risk for poor mental health. Or, in Jack Sullivan’s case, increasing the chance that he would be an available victim. “This isn’t like a phone, this is like a cigarette,” Shanor said, describing the argument. Last year,the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit rejected TikTok’s argumentthat it cannot be sued over Nylah’s death. And other lawsuits challenging protections for social media companies are making their way through federal courts. Meta has taken steps to reduce the risk of sextortion on its platforms, including an effort to specifically target the Yahoo Boys. In July, the company announced that it removed around63,000 Instagram accounts from Nigeria that attempted to target other users for sextortion. It also removed Facebook accounts, pages, and groups that were run by the Yahoo Boys. Meta also incorporated a feature that blurs nude images in messages and warns people of the risks of sending them, a spokesperson said. The Sullivans’ lawsuit says this effort is proof Meta could have removed accounts earlier, but didn’t. “There was nothing preventing these measures, design changes, and/or reasonable warnings from being implemented and integrated into the application products well in advance” of Jack Sullivan’s Jan. 4, 2023, death, the complaint says. » READ MORE:A Lyft driver was killed in Fairhill by the driver of a stolen Kia. His daughter is suing the car company for making the vehicles so easy to steal. Snapchat, with its main feature of disappearing messages, could not have been betterdesigned for the Yahoo Boys if the scammers had designed it themselves, saidO’Brien, the Sullivans’ lawyer. Jim Sullivan hopes the lawsuit can push social media companies to do more. And he plans to use his experience to speak to young people about the risks that exist on social media. He wants teens and college students to know that it is possible to walk away from an extortion attempt and connect with an authority figure, despite the shame and fear. “Jack was optimistic and a problem solver, empathetic, and a helper, and all of these really great, positive resourceful things, and couldn’t see his way out of this trap,” he said. “You can get yourself out of it.”",

        "content": "With pitchers and catchers due to report for spring training in less than two weeks, it’s time to assess the Phillies’ future, with input from opposing scouts. It didn’t require much squinting for thePhilliesto see Starlyn Caba as a future major-league shortstop. But for an organization that’s trying to balance winning aWorld Serieswith a $300 million roster and ripening the farm system, there are limits to how many prospects can be off-limits in trades. So, after a year of hanging up on teams that called about Caba, the Philliesdealt him to the Marlinsin December for lefty starter Jesús Luzardo. Even so, the Phillies wouldn’t have made the move if not for Luzardo’s reasonable salary ($6.225 million this year) and two seasons of club control. At least not for Caba, “who we like a great deal,” president of baseball operationsDave Dombrowskisaid last month. » READ MORE:Phillies storylines to watch in 2025: Transforming Trea Turner, welcoming back Alec Bohm, and more But while Caba recently cracked Baseball America’s top 100 prospects list at No. 72, the Phillies’ farm system still features Andrew Painter (No. 9), Aidan Miller (36), Eduardo Tait (93), and Justin Crawford (96). Painter is expected to make his major-league debut this year; Miller and Crawford will join him as non-roster invitees to major-league camp. And because pitchers and catchers are due to report for spring training in less than two weeks, it’s time for The Inquirer’s ranking of the top 10 Phillies prospects, an annual exercise carried out with input from opposing scouts. Age:22 (on April 10) |Height/weight:6-foot-7 / 215 |Throws:Right 2024 stats:Did not pitch (injured). Outlook:He’sbaaaaaaack. Sort of. Eighteen months after an elbow-ligament reconstruction, Painter will throw bullpen sessions and do everything else with the healthy pitchers in major-league camp. But hewon’t pitch in spring training games, Dombrowski said, because the Phillies want to balance an innings limit in his return from injury with having him available later in the season. » READ MORE:Andrew Painter is healthy and pitching again. Here’s how the Phillies are planning for his return in 2025. Key question:When will he finally make his major-league debut? “July-ish,” in Dombrowski’s words. If all goes as planned in a buildup that will continue in Clearwater after camp breaks and proceed through the minors, Painter will touch down in Philly by the summer. He affirmed his health — and cemented his status as a top-five pitching prospect in the sport — by dominating the Arizona Fall League (2.30 ERA, four walks, 18 strikeouts in 15⅔ innings). His fastball returned to the upper-90s, and he flashed a harder slider. “He’s one of the best pitchers I’ve seen,” Guardians top prospect Chase DeLauter told MLB.com. “Elite stuff.” Age:21 (on June 9) |Height/weight:6-2 / 205 |Bats/throws:Right 2024 stats:.275/.401/.483, 5 HR, 14.3% walk rate, 21.4% strikeout rate at low-A Clearwater (182 plate appearances); .258/.353/.444, 5 HR, 11.6% BB rate, 22.1% K rate at high-A Jersey Shore (258 PA); .191/.227/.191, 0 HR, 0 BB%, 18.2% K rate at double-A Reading (22 PA). Outlook:Through 18 games after getting promoted to high-A in June, Miller batted .167 with one homer, 19 strikeouts, and a .558 OPS. Over his next 40 games, he batted .296 with five homers, 38 strikeouts, and an .897 OPS. And scouts who didn’t already believe in him were converted to the cult. “All-Star upside,” said one NL talent evaluator. “He’s got a good chance to succeed as a high-contact, extra-base-hit guy in the 20- to 25-homer realm by 2026.” » READ MORE:Aidan Miller ‘can get used to this’ after teaming up with Phillies top prospects Key question:Is he a long-term shortstop? When the Phillies drafted Miller in the first round in 2023, the industry presumption was that he would eventually shift over to third base. It hasn’t happened. And withTrea Turnerlikely to move from shortstop within the next few years, it’s sensible to keep Miller where he is. Besides, as one scout noted, Miller is “not flashy or quick, but steady, poised, and very instinctive” at shortstop. Age:21 |Height/weight:6-1 / 175 |Bats/throws:Left/right 2024 stats:.301/.349/.438, 6 HR, 27-for-35 stolen bases, 6.6% BB rate, 20.1% K rate at Jersey Shore (317 PA); .333/.380/.455, 3 HR, 15-for-16 SB, 6.1% BB rate, 16.1% K rate at Reading (180 PA). Outlook:Within the scouting community, the most frequently cited criticism of Crawford is his extreme tendency to hit the ball on the ground. It’s notable, then, that his ground-ball rate went from 69.7% in 2023 to 60.9% last year. There’s room for further improvement, but given his speed, Crawford can turn ant-killing grounders into infield hits. He led the farm system in hits (143) and was second in doubles (25) last season, then homered to lead Team USA into the medal round of the Premier 12 Tournament in November. » READ MORE:Phillies prospect Justin Crawford lived ‘a dream’ playing for Team USA Key question:Will he graduate to the majors this year? The Phillies have had seven opening-day center fielders in the last seven years. Crawford is a long shot to be No. 8. But if Crawford makes an impression in his first major-league camp, Dombrowski won’t be shy about pushing him. With the Red Sox, Dombrowski called up Andrew Benintendi at age 21 from double A in 2016 and Rafael Devers at age 20 after nine triple-A games in 2017. Crawford’s father, Carl, made his major-league debut at age 20. Justin’s time is coming. Age:18 |Height/weight:5-11 / 219 |Bats/throws:Left/right 2024 stats:.321/.377/.500, 6 HR, 6.1% BB rate, 14.6% K rate in rookie ball (212 PA); .269/.316/.462, 5 HR, 7% BB rate, 28.9% K rate at Clearwater (114 PA). Outlook:In 1998, the Phillies signed a teenage catcher from Panama for $8,000. Carlos Ruiz turned out to be pretty good. They returned to that Central America country in 2022 and paid $90,000 for Tait. So far, the reviews are positive. Tait’s calling card is his left-handed power that one scout labeled as “special.” In his first season in the United States, he registered some of the highest exit velocities recorded by Phillies minor leaguers. After beginning the season in rookie ball, he ended it as one of the youngest players in the Florida State League. » READ MORE:J.T. Realmuto or … who? The Phillies will face a complex decision with their star catcher. Key question:Will he stay behind the plate? It can be difficult for talent evaluators to predict the future of a catching prospect because of the responsibility that comes with the position. When the catcher is still a teenager, the projection is nearly impossible. One scout cited Tait’s arm strength and said he “has the raw tools to continue to mature defensively.” Another cautioned that Tait’s “fully developed body” might keep growing and take him out from behind the plate. Either way, he’s light-years away from the majors. But his journey will be fascinating to follow. Age:22 (on June 9) |Height/weight:6-1 / 213 |Throws:Right 2024 stats:3.46 ERA, 1.288 WHIP, 13.5% walk rate, 34.2% strikeout rate at Orioles’ high-A Aberdeen (52 innings); 4.15 ERA, 1.038 WHIP, 8.6% BB rate, 37.1% K rate at Jersey Shore (8⅔ IP); 3.66 ERA, 1.068 WHIP, 9.1% BB rate, 45.5% K rate at Reading (19⅔ IP). Outlook:Aftertrading two pitching prospects(George Klassen and Sam Aldegheri) to the Angels at the deadline for reliever Carlos Estévez, the Philliesgot two back(Chace and Seth Johnson) from the Orioles for lefty Gregory Soto. Chace struck out 48 of 112 batters in six starts between Jersey Shore and Reading and exhibited better control than in the past in Baltimore’s system. How’s that for a strong first impression? » READ MORE:Meet the pitching prospects the Phillies got in the Gregory Soto trade: Seth Johnson and Moisés Chace Key question:Does he project as a starter or a reliever? A lot will ride on the development of Chace’s slider — and to a lesser extent, changeup. He throws two variations of a slider: a sweeper and a hard cutter. The latter is a more recent addition and figures to help against left-handed hitters. If he’s able to command both sliders, in addition to a fastball that comes from a low arm slot and tends to miss bats, he will have the weapons to go through a lineup multiple times. Age:23 |Height/weight:6-5 / 190 |Throws:Right 2024 stats:6.46 ERA, 1.813 WHIP, 15.1% BB rate, 22.7% K rate at triple-A Lehigh Valley (108⅔ innings). Outlook:Look out below. Once regarded alongside Painter asNo. 1 and 1Ain the Phillies system, Abel is tumbling down the prospect chart after a dreadful season in which he couldn’t throw strikes consistently. His struggles began with an illness late in spring training, and things got only marginally better. (Abel had a 6.88 ERA at the All-Star break, 5.75 thereafter.) But he stayed healthy and topped 100 innings for a second consecutive season. » READ MORE:From 2023: Don’t forget about Mick Abel, the other half of the Phillies’ best pitching prospect duo in 20 years Key question:Was 2024 a developmental speed bump or a warning sign? Perspective is important. Abel pitched last season at 22, five years younger than the average age in the triple-A International League, according toBaseball-Reference.com. That isn’t insignificant. He’s also a cerebral student of pitching, and with a five-pitch repertoire, there’s a lot for him to think about. Maybe he’d benefit from simplifying things. Mostly, though, it comes down to throwing strikes and trusting his stuff to get high-level hitters out. Nori’s age:20| Height/weight:5-10 / 190| Bats/throws:Left Burkholder’s age:19| Height/weight:6-2 / 195| Bats/throws:Right Nori’s 2024 stats:.240/.424/.280, 0 HR, 4-for-6 SB, 24.2% BB rate, 21.2% K rate at Clearwater (66 PA) Burkholder’s 2024 stats:.500/.500/1.500, 0 HR, 0% BB rate, 0% K rate at Clearwater (2 PA) Outlook:It feels like a cop-out to lump together the Phillies’first two picks from the 2024 draft, but the on-field sample size isn’t large enough for scouts to separate them. Burkholder, in particular, played only four innings in his pro debut Aug. 13 before straining his hamstring. After a glimpse of Nori, one scout noted his speed and on-base ability and projected a Johnny “Damon-esque-type ceiling” as a center fielder. » READ MORE:Phillies draft high school outfielders Dante Nori and Griffin Burkholder with their first two picks Key question:Which outfielder will be the better player? The comparisons are inevitable. Not only were Nori and Burkholder drafted only 36 picks apart, but both came out of high school. They even got identical signing bonuses ($2,497,500). Nori’s speed and defense in center field might make him the safer bet; Burkholder’s right-handed power potential might boost his ceiling. They’re expected to share the outfield for Clearwater this season. Age:24 (on March 3)| Height/weight:6-3 / 225| Bats/throws:Left/right 2024 stats:.263/.357/.487, 11 HR, 20-for-27 SB, 11.6% BB rate, 25.6% K rate at Reading (258 PA) Outlook:After missing two months last season with a torn ligament in his right thumb, Rincones batted .296 with eight doubles, six homers, and a .961 OPS in his first 23 games upon rejoining Reading’s lineup. Consider it a snapshot of his potential. To make up for lost time, the Phillies sent him to the Arizona Fall League, where he reached base at a .367 clip with only two homers but also just seven strikeouts in 90 plate appearances. If he stays healthy, there’s 20-homer/20-steal upside. » READ MORE:From 2023: The Phillies’ next great hitting prospect might be a Scottish Venezuelan-American with a frame like Pat Burrell Key question:Could he contribute in the majors this season? Maybe. It’s no secret the Phillies lack corner-outfield depth, but they’re so thin that they recently purchased 22-year-old Dylan Campbell from the Dodgers for international bonus money. Rincones might open the season back in double A, but it won’t be long before he’s in Lehigh Valley. And if the Phillies need help beyondNick Castellanos, Max Kepler,Brandon Marsh, Johan Rojas, Weston Wilson, and perhaps out-of-options Kody Clemens, they will reach down and find … Rincones? Age:23| Height/weight:6-0 / 160| Throws:Right 2024 stats:3.39 ERA, 1.091 WHIP, 8% BB rate, 29% K rate at Jersey Shore (77 IP); 4.85 ERA, 1.517 WHIP, 6.1% BB rate, 14.4% K rate at Reading (29⅔ IP). Outlook:The Phillies added Cabrera to the 40-man roster in November because they didn’t want to risk losing him in the Rule 5 draft. And he probably would’ve been selected. Never mind his slight build. The skinny righty pitched into the sixth inning in 10 of 19 starts and struck out nearly 25% of batters. He does it with two fastballs but also an above-average changeup that is widely considered his best pitch. » READ MORE:Will Bryson Stott and Orion Kerkering be part of the next Phillies core? Their 2025 seasons will be telling. Key question:Is his future in the bullpen? Undersize pitchers don’t tend to stick in starting rotations. Across baseball last season, only eight 5-foot-11 or shorter pitchers made at least five starts. The Phillies haven’t had a 5-foot-11 or shorter pitcher make at least five starts in a season since Pedro Martínez and Antonio Bastardo in 2009. Cabrera has the repertoire to be a starter. It will come down to commanding his pitches and staying healthy. Age:20| Height/weight:5-10 / 180| Bats/throws:Right 2024 stats:.338/.495/.481, 3 HR, 9-for-9 SB, 20.2% BB rate, 9.6% K rate in rookie ball (104 PA). Outlook:Remember this name. Multiple scouts listed Escobar as a sleeper in the Phillies’ farm system. He signed for $450,000 out of  Venezuela in 2022 and made a solid, albeit brief, stateside debut last season in the Florida Complex League. Sidelined by double shin splints after 24 games, he flashed impressive bat-to-ball skills and sneaky power. One NL scout compared him to the Astros’ Isaac Paredes for both his contact rate and infield versatility. » READ MORE:The Phillies’ reliever numbers don’t add up now, but that’s part of Dave Dombrowski’s bullpen-building calculation Key question:Where does he stack up among Phillies infield prospects? Bryan Rincon, a switch-hitting shortstop who turns 21 next week, gets strong reviews for his defense. Devin Saltiban, who turns 20 next month, has more advanced skills at the plate and the versatility to project as a utility player in the majors. Given his age and inexperience, Escobar might be more of a project but have a higher ceiling, according to one NL scout. The Phillies figure to challenge him at the low-A level.",

        "content": "And, Brandon Graham returns to practice for the Eagles. Saquon Barkley cannot wait to play in his first Super Bowl. Brandon Graham cannot wait to play in his third — and he might get the chance. It’s a long shot, for sure, but the 36-year-old defensive end returned to the field Thursday as the Eagles opened the 21-day practice window for him. Graham said his season was finished after he suffered a torn triceps on Nov. 24 and yet here he is, preparing for a chance to face the Kansas City Chiefs on Feb. 9. The New York Times and Forbes have reported that torn triceps typically take five to six months to fully heal. “So far, man, this has been one of the easiest injuries I’ve had compared to the ones I had before,” Graham insisted. “If it’s not feeling right, I’m not going to do it, butso far, so good.” Again, it’s a long shot, but what a story it would be. Barkley will be a story for sure when he celebrates his 28th birthday on Super Bowl Sunday. In the midst of a historic first season with theBirds, the All-Pro running back is intent on sealing the deal. His Eagles teammates have told him how wrenching it was losing the Super Bowl two years ago. “Definitely don’t want to be part of that,” Barkley said. “That’s definitely something that drives us. For those guys that have been a part of it, but also just want to get the job done and knowing how it is for those guys, how it felt, and doing everything I can in my ... ability to make surethat doesn’t happen.” — Jim Swan,@phillysport,sports.daily@inquirer.com. If someone forwarded you this email,sign up for free here. The 76ers will not have an All-Star for the first time in eight seasons. That became official Thursday when Tyrese Maxey was not selected as a reserve for the Eastern Conference. Perennial All-Stars Joel Embiid and Paul George were already taken out of contention, largely because of injuries. As for Maxey, his exclusion could be considered a snub. The point guard is sixth in scoring at 27.6 points per game and third in steals with 2.0 per game. His best work came in the Sixers’ most recent games. Maxey has scored 28 points or more in his last 12 games, joining Hall of Famers Wilt Chamberlain and Allen Iverson and teammate Embiid as the only players to maintain such a streak. Maxey faced steep competition at guard, though. Selected as reserves for the East were Boston’s Jaylen Brown, Milwaukee’s Damian Lillard, Cleveland’s Darius Garland, Miami’s Tyler Herro, andDetroit’s Cade Cunningham. Playing for the 49ers, linebacker Oren Burks found himself thrust into Super Bowl LVIII last year when starter Dre Greenlaw went down with an injury. Burks is headed back to the big game, this time as an injury replacement for Nakobe Dean. And this time, Burks is coming off one of the best games of his career in the NFC championship game. “The season has a lot of ebbs and flows, but this is the big one that you’ve beenpreparing for your whole life,” Burks said. The Chiefs are saying all the right things as they get ready for the Eagles. Andy Reid heaped praise on the Birds, saying “they’re fully loaded on the offensive side.” Ahead of their game Thursday with the New York Islanders, the Flyers decided to make a change on the blue line. They called up a Swedish defenseman from Lehigh Valley, but it was not Emil Andrae or Helge Grans. This time, the Flyers called up Adam Ginning from the Phantoms. A stay-at-home defenseman, Ginning brings one thing for sure to the Flyersat 6-foot-4: size. Amid that game, it was discovered that the Flyers struck a deal with the Calgary Flames to trade both Morgan Frost and Joel Farabee in exchange for Andrei Kuzmenko and Jakob Pelletier, a 2025 second-round pick, and a 2028 seventh-round pick. An interesting move, considering both Frost and Farabee were once valued as part of ayoung group poised to lead the Flyers. The team could use some guidance at the moment, following a3-0 loss to the New York Islanders last night. Our Devin Jackson is at Senior Bowl workouts in Mobile, Ala., checking out the next batch of NFL players ahead of the draft in April.

Among your responses: My earliest memory of watching the Eagles (on a tiny black and white TV) was during the 1956 season﻿. However, I will never forget listening to the NFL championship game at Franklin Field between the Eagles and Vince Lombardi’s Green Bay Packers in December 1960 on WCAU Radio — because home games were blacked out on local TV — with my Dad. I can still hear Bill Campbell’s voice counting down the final seconds of the 17-13 win after Chuck Bednarik’s final tackle of Jim Taylor on the Eagle 10-yard line. Oh, and did I mention, my father and I were jumping up and down? If there were a moment when I truly became a proud Eagle fan, that was it.— John D. I’ve been a fan since the mid ’50s but it was the “Cinderella” 1960 championship team that really kick-started my fandom. They were picked to finish last in the conference ( back then there were 2 conferences-8 teams in each. The 2 teams that finished in 1st place played for the championship). We finished 10-2 and beat Green Bay, 17-13. Caught them just before the Lombardi dynasty kicked in. Van Brocklin, McDonald, Bednarik, Retzlaff, et al... Great year!— Jack H. The Eagles won the NFL championships in 1948 and ’49, beating the Chicago Cardinals and then the L.A. Rams. We did not have a TV, but I would see newsreels of the team on the Saturday morning movies at Media and Drexel Hill when we would go to see the Westerns. Then I followed them in the newspapers back then and talked about them with my school friends. Bosh Pritchard, Pete Pihos, Tommy Thompson, and Steve Van Buren were the stars. I sometime rode my bike from Springfield to Clifton Heights to visit Steve Van Buren on Baltimore Pike where he was selling cars during the offseason. I did not see a live game until the 1950’s.— Everett S. This is gonna sound super lame, but I have the people at EA sports to thank! When I was about 7 or 8, I downloaded Madden Mobile on my iPad. One of the first things you had to do was choose a team! I picked the Eagles because I was (and am) a very patriotic person and associated eagles with America. Less than a few years later [Nick Foles] led us to our first ring.— Stiles B. My dad got me going with the Eagles, but they were not totally on my radar until the 1960 NFL championship. Back then, the league wasn’t the TV presence it has become, nor was any pro sport. When we visited my grandparents on Sundays, we’d watch home games on a black-and-white TV in a tiny room on the second floor, so as not to distract the family. It was that classic win over Green Bay, and Concrete Charlie basically holding Jimmy Taylor down as the clock ran down and the Birds won. This 11-year-old was sold for good.— Mike R.

        "source": "https://www.inquirer.com/",
        "content": "The Philly DA, soon expected to announce his campaign for reelection, said his office won’t interfere in legal actions taken by ICE. But if agents act beyond their legal scope or bring harm to immigrants, he said, “Try me.” Philadelphia District AttorneyLarry Krasnersaid Friday that local elected officials and law enforcement cannot be forced to comply with the Trump administration’s “Nazi stuff,” referring to the president’s planned crackdown on immigration. “Local law enforcement can volunteer to do Nazi stuff,” Krasner, a Democrat, said. “I’m sure I stand with all my colleagues up here when we say nope, N-O-P-E, nope. Maybe there are some local law enforcement who want to put on jackboots and gray uniforms and march behind this, but not us.” The comment came during a news conference Friday at Philadelphia City Hall where state representatives and City Council members condemned PresidentDonald Trump’s actions on immigration,including rescinding guidance that once barred federal agents from entering churches, schools, and hospitals. Reports of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement activity have reverberated around the Philadelphia area since Trump took office, heightening anxieties for immigrant communities. Earlier this week, ICE agents raided a North Philadelphia car wash,arresting seven people and triggering a protest. Officials on Friday aimed to make the public aware of Philadelphia’s intentions to protect its immigrant communities in the sanctuary city. Krasner, who has long positioned himself as and campaigned on being a staunch adversary to Trump, is expected to launch his reelection bid for a third term as DA in the coming weeks. Earlier this month, formerPhiladelphia Judge Patrick Dugan announced his bid to challenge Krasner. Krasner said the basis of local officials’ noncompliance with federal orders is supported by the Anti-Commandeering Doctrine, which is based on the Tenth Amendment and says “the federal government cannot require states or state officials to adopt or enforce federal law,”according to SCOTUSBlog. A memo from Trump’s Acting Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove, published in various news outlets last week, threatened consequences for local officials who do not cooperate with Trump’s plans to crack down on immigration, adding that local officials are legally bound to cooperate with the U.S. Department of Justice based on the Constitution’s supremacy clause. In light of that memo,Krasner said he and his staff would not comply with any immigration orders that break the law. He expressed a similar sentiment Friday, also acknowledging that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement “is going to do what it is legally and constitutionally entitled to do. ”As a law enforcement officer, we would not interfere with that,” Krasner said. But Krasner added that his office will not hold back from prosecuting ICE agents in Philadelphia for doing “criminal things that go beyond their rights.” “Any ICE agent, any Proud Boy who thinks hate crimes are cool, thinks ‘I can get away with anything because there’s a king in D.C.?’ No, you can’t. That’s not how it’s going to work,” Krasner said. “If you are so inclined to break the law to harm immigrants … if you are inclined to use them as your scapegoat, harm them, be cruel to them, you better do it within the law, and if you don’t, try me.”",

        "title": "Philly’s federal workers are worried about job security and government services amid Trump administration shakeups",
        "source": "https://www.inquirer.com/",
        "content": "The Office of Personnel Management's memo giving employees the chance to resign with eight months' pay is leaving workers pondering their job security. When federal workers received a memo from the U.S. government’s human resources agency this week offering the chance to resign with eight months’ pay, some thought it might be spam. “Once you determine whether it’s real or not, it’s kind of like, what is this?” said Philip Glover, national vice president for the American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE) District 3. His union represents about 9,400 federal workers in and near Philadelphia, among some 800,000 across the U.S. and abroad. Ina memo to federal workers Tuesday, the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM)offereda “deferred resignation.” Those who agree, by Feb. 6, to leave their jobswill retain all pay and benefits — and an exemption from Trump-era in-person work mandates — until Sept. 30. Those who pass up the offer do not have“full assurance” that their position or agency will continue to exist, according to the memo. The memo is one in a series of directives under PresidentDonald Trump’s second administration aimed at overhauling federal agencies. Trump signed several executive orders on his first day in office tofreeze hiring, bring federal workers back to in-person work full time, andend diversity, equity, and inclusion programsin federal government. » READ MORE:Donald Trump’s executive orders are likely to have a tangible impact on Philadelphia’s federal workers The Inquirer spoke with union leaders and local federal workers from across several agencies, some on the basis of anonymity due to fear of retaliation in the workplace. Several said Trump’s executive orders and the resignation memo have caused anxiety, distrust in the federal government, and confusion about the future of their jobs. They’re also concerned that essential government services could suffer. Typically, the leaders of federal agencies communicate with their own employees directly. Federal workers receiving an email from OPM was “very odd” said Glover. Some noticed how the memo’s title —Fork in the Road—mimicked the subject line in Elon Musk’s email to Twitter employeeswhenthe billionaire took over. The recent directives jibewith the goals of the “Department of Government Efficiency,”led by Musk, who has been tasked with identifying and eradicating what’s deemed to be wasteful spending, including shrinking the federal workforce. The memo marked a major shift from the federal government’s usual “level of formality,” said Marie Owens Powell, president of AFGE’s Council 238 which represents over 8,500 EPA employees across the country. “Seeing something that’s literally called ‘Fork in the Road’ was not what one would expect, whatsoever,” said Powell. The OPM has said it intends to shrink a majority of federal agencies through “restructurings, realignments, and reductions in force,” according to the offer notice. The memo also says federal workers should be “reliable, loyal, trustworthy” and that “performance standards will be updated to reward and promote those that exceed expectations.” “I don’t feel real good about this loyalty test that they’re pushing forward,” said Glover. The OPM did not respond to a request for comment on the loyalty language and new performance standards. » READ MORE:Who are the Philly region’s federal workers? A look at the employees impacted by Trump’s recent executive orders. A Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA) employee in Philadelphia, who has been a federal worker since 2016, was shocked by OPM’s resignation offer and wondered: “Is my job in jeopardy?” The nine-year federal worker thought she would retire as a federal employee, but has begun to rethink that. She thought government work offered job security, but is less certain now. “What does the future hold for me?” she said. “I don’t know, because it seemed like anything can happen within a week.” Another Philadelphia VBA worker, a five-year employee, said she found the memo’s language troubling. “Our jobs are uncertain because that email reads that you have to be performing at above the exceptional level,” she said. “That would be the norm — for everyone, and that is not realistic.” AFGE’s lawyers are looking into the legality of the offer, said Glover. While it offers to pay workers through September if they accept, federal government spending is currently fundedthrough March 14. OPM regulations typically only allow buyouts of up to $25,000 per person unless Congress makes an exception, noted Glover. The average federal worker makes$106,382 per year, according to OPM data, which is about $71,000 from now to September. Union leaders are skeptical of the offer — two, speaking with The Inquirer, called it a “scam.” The AFGE is urgingcaution to members consideringtheresignation. “There’s not yet any evidence the administration can or will uphold its end of the bargain, that Congress will go along with this unilateral massive restructuring, or that appropriated funds can be used this way, among other issues that have been raised,” an AFGE spokesperson said in a statement. The spokesperson said the union’s locals and councils maydemand to bargain over the program and could filegrievances or unfair labor practice charges alleging the federal government directly communicated with employees, bypassing the unions. Several federal agencies offer hybrid schedules — something workers (and their bosses) have gotten used to. Trump’s executive order mandating a return to full-time in-person work might not be physically possible, workers said. The Northeast Regional Office for the National Park Service, on Market Street in Philadelphia, can only hold about 60 employees, said Dave Fitzpatrick, secretary-treasurer of the AFGE Council 270 and a retired National Park Service maintenance employee in Philadelphia. The parks’ administrative workers would claim desks on a hoteling system that complemented their in-person schedules. “If you needed a desk for a couple of days, you would make a reservation, so now they’re telling all these folks to come back,” Fitzpatrick said. “There’s physically not enough room for them to fit into that space.” At the Philadelphia VBA: “I think we’re going to be squished like a can of sardines,” said the nine-year federal worker. And returning to the office full time could mean an added expense for those who will now need additional help to care for children or other family members, workers said. One Philly VA employee who has worked for the agency for more than 20 years said a flexible work-from-home schedule allowed them to attend medical appointments with their mom, who has been diagnosed with cancer. The employee themself also has a chronic illness, which was slightly easier to manage withtelework. Now, the VA employee said, “I’m gonna have to take a lot more time off in order to accommodate those necessary appointments.” But they want to keep their job, to continue “to help people” rather than “take an easy buyout and give up.” If employees do take the resignation offer, there is no expectation their roles would be filled again, said Powell, who represents EPA workers. “The work that they do would cease to be done,” said Powell. At the EPA that includes responding to emergencies, cleaning up toxic pollution, sampling water, and monitoring air. “When there’s nobody to call, there’s going to be a problem,” she said. “The people that are there to respond to these emergencies, to do these cleanups, to make sure your water is clean or your air is breathable and safe for you and your children are not going to be there.” Ittakes federal workers to process passports, keep airplanes flying, and national parks running, Glover notes. Brad Starnes, president of AFGE’s Local 3631, described OPM’s email as “a rather ominous communication.” Wednesday morning, he got a flood of phone calls and emails from union members he represents, which includes EPA employees in Pennsylvania and Delaware. Workers were “blindsided” and “shocked,” he said. “You cannot just pull people out of an organization that provides the breadth of services that we provide that are truly needed, and expect that … there will not be severe impacts on the American people,” said Starnes. “That’s what scares me. Nothing like this has ever happened. This is new ground.” Independence Hall relies on seasonal staff to keep up with tourists and crowds in the busy summer months, and with the hiring freeze and the “deferred resignation” program, individuals seeking to learn about Philadelphia and U.S. history may be sorely disappointed, said Fitzpatrick, the retired parks employee in Philadelphia. “I don’t know what the summer season is going to look like at Independence, but there’s going to be a lot of people standing outside trying to get on tours that just aren’t going to happen,” he said. The hunger for Philadelphia’s tourist attractions is likely to escalate next year with the celebration of the nation’s 250th anniversary, which city officials are already preparing for. Trump himselfhas called for an extraordinary celebrationin yet another executive order. For one longtime employee with the National Park Service, telling the story of the Declaration of Independence or the Constitution is not only a job — it’s personal. “We are dedicated employees in this park, more so than any park I have ever seen, and we take our jobs seriously because we know that sometimes this is it for these people,” the employee said. “This is the shot of what American history really is.”",

The plane ride home from Japan feels even longer after you lose your world title and taste defeat for the first time as a professional boxer. But it provided Stephen Fulton — the former super bantamweight champion from West Philadelphia — two years ago with the time to reflect. “Having everything and losing it all,” Fulton said, “makes you think about all the things you’ve done in your life and appreciate the things you’ve done and also appreciate yourself more and love yourself more. When I lost the title, I lost family, friends, those things. You have to regroup.” » READ MORE:Do you know these seven all-time Philly boxing greats? Take a look. Fulton was knocked out in Japan by Naoya Inoue in July 2023 and then knocked down a year later in his next fight against Carlos Castro. But he was not ready to fold. Fulton rallied, earned a decision against Castro, and righted his career. On Saturday night, Fulton (22-1, 8 knockouts) has a chance to become a champion again when he meets WBC featherweight champ Brandon Figueroa (25-1-1, 19 KOs) at the T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas. “I learned a lot about myself,” said the 30-year-old Fulton, whose fight is broadcast by Amazon Prime pay-per-view. “No matter what I go through, I feel like I can overcome it.” Figueroa’s only career loss is a decision to Fulton in November 2021. That fight made Fulton a unified champion at 122 pounds and gave him one of the signature wins of his career. Saturday is a rematch at a different weight class as this is Fulton’s second featherweight fight — he moved up to 125 pounds after losing to Inoue. Fulton is also training now with Bozy Ennis, the father of Jaron “Boots” Ennis. Ennis, Hamza Muhammad, and Wahid Rahim share Fulton’s corner. “It’s like the best of both worlds on my behalf,” Fulton said. “Bozy has a different style than maybe Hamza and Wahid might have. So when you combine their styles, it all works out at the end of the tunnel.” It would have been easy for Fulton to fold last September after he touched the canvas in the fifth round, just 14 months removed from a difficult loss. His career was at a crossroads as he returned to his corner. But he was urged to keep pushing, and he did. On Saturday night, Fulton can be champion again. “I might have been knocked down but I’m going to get back up, stay focused, and get the job done,” Fulton said. “People always face adversity in life. It’s all about how you react to it.” » READ MORE:Danny Garcia’s father fought back from a stroke to be in his corner",

Barkley, a member of the New York Giants at the time, harbored a bit of resentment toward the team that knocked his squad out of the playoffs in the divisional round. The star running back watched only part of the Super Bowl that year, as he was on a flight back from Phoenix after participating in the media frenzy that is radio row. “That stuff is fun,” Barkley said on Thursday. “Radio row and all of that. But I like this a little bit better.” » READ MORE:Eagles’ Brandon Graham returns to practice ahead of the Super Bowl as he recovers from triceps injury Next week, Barkley returns to the Super Bowl with a new allegiance and a different agenda. The 27-year-old running back — who will turn 28 on the day of the Super Bowl, Feb. 9 — will be a key part of an Eagles team on a quest to win its second Lombardi Trophy in the last eight seasons. Even though Barkley wasn’t a member of the group that lost to the Kansas City Chiefs in February 2023, he still feels the pain carried by some of his teammates who fell short of the ultimate goal at the time. “I think even though I wasn’t part of that team ... when you’re able to develop a friendship and a relationship with these guys and be able to go to war with each other, it felt like I was,” Barkley said. “I know how, like I wasn’t there, but I can feel in my own body how it felt for them and see the confetti fall in the wrong color and having to walk out. “Definitely don’t want to be part of that. That’s definitely something that drives us. For those guys that have been a part of it, but also just want to get the job done and knowing how it is for those guys, how it felt, and doing everything I can in my ... ability to make sure that doesn’t happen.” After a historic regular season and a dominant postseason, Barkley enters the week of the Super Bowl in rare company. According to the NFL’s Next Gen Stats, Barkley is one of three players all-time to have at least 400 rushing yards in the playoffs before playing in the Super Bowl, joining Hall of Fame running backs John Riggins and Terrell Davis. Both players went on to rush for more than 150 yards in the Super Bowl, and each won the game’s Most Valuable Player award. » READ MORE:The Chiefs are aware of a ‘fully loaded’ Eagles team ahead of Super Bowl LIX Davis set the single-season rushing record(including playoffs) in 1998 as a member of the Denver Broncos when he ran for a total of 2,476 yards. Barkley, sitting at 2,447, needs 30 rushing yards to break Davis’ record. Still, Barkley is more focused on the team’s bigger goal. “The only thing that makes it special, whether we got the rushing record during the season or if we get the all-time rushing record, playoffs included, the only thing that makes it special is winning a Super Bowl,” Barkley said. “This profession that we’re in, this sport that we’re in, there’s a lot of great things that we’ve accomplished so far up to this, but if we don’t get the job done next Sunday, maybe when you’re in your 30s and 40s and you look back at it, you’re going to think about how special it was. But it’s kind of going to make it feel ... like you came up short.” Barkley will make his first Super Bowl appearance in just his second postseason run of his seven-year NFL career. Upon signing his three-year, $37.75 million deal with the Eagles in March, Barkley had the mindset that his new team had the firepower to make it to the NFL’s biggest stage. “I didn’tthinkthat it was possible,” Barkley said. “I kind of knew. You’ve got to envision it. You’ve got to believe it. “Every year, no matter what, you have to come in with that mindset. Because we all have a chance to go out there and accomplish what we want to accomplish. I believed in it. I envisioned it.” Radio row has nothing on the opportunity ahead for Barkley at the Super Bowl this time around. After setting the franchise’s single-season rushing record in 2024, the running back is still hungry to accomplish more. “It’s a cool feeling when everything that you worked for, it’s all right in front of you,” Barkley said. “The player that I knew I was and the player that I believed I was is finally getting to show.” » READ MORE:Eagles linebacker Oren Burks finds himself in a key spot in a second straight Super Bowl",

Other NFL teams have their own version of a fight song to rally their fans together for a big game — from the Buffalo Bills’ “Shout” to the Chicago Bears’ “Bear Down, Chicago Bears.” But let’s be honest, none compares to “Fly, Eagles Fly,” a song that fans have been hearing quite a lot of lately, with the team coming off a 14-3 season and preparing to compete inSuper BowlLIX.

Here’s everything you need to know ahead of the Eagles’ Super Bowl rematch against the Chiefs … Before there was the short and sweet “Fly, Eagles Fly” fight song that we know today, there was anearly five-minute versionthat went “Fight, Eagles Fight,” which is still part of the revamped song fans sing today. The five-minute song was created in the 1950s by Philadelphia ad men Charles J. Borrelli and Roger Courtland. In the 1960s, the song was performed by the Eagles’ Sound of Brass, a 200-member marching band, before losing the approval of Eagles fans in the 1980s. In the 1990s, Eagles fan Bobby Mansure helped create the fight song that lives on today — “Fly, Eagles Fly” — by reworking the former 1950s version that the Eagles played before games at Connie Mack Stadium.Mansure met Brian Saunders, and the twoMummersformed a band known as The Fly Guys. It consisted of Mansure as the lead saxophone player, Saunders on the tenor sax, and Anthony DiMeo on the banjo. Together, the group would breathe new life into the future anthem of the Eagles. In 1996, the Eagles hired them to work the parking lots before games and help pump up the crowd. In search of an Eagles-themed song to play for fans, they came across the original version of “The Eagles Victory Song.” The guys decided to up the tempo and coined a new phrase, “Fly, Eagles Fly,” which wasn’t featured in the original song. Soon, they were infiltrating tailgates to teach fans the new fight song. “We handed out pieces of paper to every tailgate we went to,” Mansuretold the Inquirer’s Matt Breen last year. “We sold it to the parking lots. Instead of parading through, we stopped at tailgates and talked to people. We got phone numbers. We just connected with people and soon they were like, ‘Can you show up to our tailgate?’” Eventually, The Fly Guys — now the Eagles’ official pep band — and their revamped fight song became so popular that the team started playing it on the stadium speakers after each touchdown. That tradition continues today, and the song has also become part of the team’s pregame festivities before the national anthem. » READ MORE:Fly, Eagles Fly: How two Mummers gave Philadelphia an anthem In order to complete the song, the group decided to add a chant at the end, the now familiar “E-A-G-L-E-S, Eagles!” chant, which can be heard from the streets of Philadelphia toPhilly-themed sports bars in Tokyo.They invited friends into Saunders’ home studio to make it sound like a crowded stadium, and an anthem was born. “Before that, you were getting more of the ‘Give me an E, give me an A,’ that kind of thing,” Saunders told Breen. “It’s certainly not what it is now. When you have the right amount of syllables and the word ‘Eagles,’ things sometimes just fall together perfectly. Like it belonged there. There was no other way you could end the song. You had to have an ending.” Be sure to check out Breen’s full story on the origin of the fight song,here. In case you need a refresher, here are the full lyrics to “Fly, Eagles Fly” as well as a video of fans singing the song. Fly, Eagles fly! On the road to victory! (Fight! Fight! Fight!) Fight, Eagles fight! Score a touchdown 1, 2, 3! (1! 2! 3!) Hit ‘em low! Hit ‘em high! And watch our Eagles fly! Fly, Eagles fly! On the road to victory! E-A-G-L-E-S! Eagles!",

        "source": "https://www.inquirer.com/",
        "content": "The Philadelphia Skating Club said its community members were part of the deadly D.C. airline crash. It may be days before all the victims are identified, and perhaps weeks or months before the cause of the collision of an American Airlines plane and a U.S. Army helicopter is determined, but for now the only certainty for the region’s figure skating community is an enduring sense of “immense grief.” A number of passengers who were killed in Wednesday night’s tragic crash were part of that tight-knit community, including accomplished skaters, coaches, and family members. The Philadelphia Skating Club & Humane Society and the University of Delaware confirmed that several of the victims had local ties. Three of the victims identified so far were from Delaware. Officials on Thursday confirmed the inevitable: They had abandoned any hope of rescuing the victims in the chilly waters of the Potomac River, where the crash occurred about 9 p.m. Wednesday as the airliner was attempting to land at Reagan National Airport near Washington. The plane was carrying 60 passengers and four crew members. Three soldiers were aboard the helicopter that evidently flew into the plane’s path. As of Thursday night, 28 bodies had been recovered. Sen. Chris Coons (D., Del.) said Thursday night that three of the victims — Sasha Kirsanov, Sean Kay, and Angela Yang — were Delawareans. Kirsanov was a former coach of the University of Delaware Figure Skating Club. In a statement, university president Dennis Assanis said, “We believe two young skaters,” members of the university’s skating club, also were on board. The university did not identify them, but the skating clubposted enthusiastically on social medialast week about Kay and Yang’s forthcoming trip to Kansas — where the American Airlines flight originated — for a national development camp. Assanis said that Kirsanov, who lived in Newark, and the skaters trained at the university’s High Performance Training Center, which “has been the training home for many years of multiple world-class skating champions and competitors.” Kirsanov’s wife, Natalya Gudin, who is also a coach,told ABC News: “I lost everything. I lost my husband. I lost my students. I lost my friends.” She said she last spoke to her husband Wednesday afternoon ahead of the flight’s boarding. Gudin said she learned of the crash from the mother of a figure skater on the flight. “I need my husband back,” she said. “I need his body back.” Coons said on social media: “My heart goes out to Sasha’s wife Natalia [and] the University of Delaware Figure Skating Club.” In his statement, Assanis said: “The figure skating community is tight-knit, and many of our students and coaches have trained and competed alongside those who were lost.” Wichita, Kan., from where the flight departed before heading to Washington, hosted the U.S. Figure Skating Championship last week, along with a training camp that wrapped this week. “These athletes, coaches, and family members were returning home,” U.S. Figure Skatingsaidin a statement Thursday morning. “We are devastated by this unspeakable tragedy and hold the victims’ families closely in our hearts.” In Philadelphia, the skating club — the nation’s oldest — expressed “immense grief at the loss of so many talented skaters, their coaches and families.” The club had not disclosed the names of any local victims as of Thursday night. “Sadly, one of the families lost just became members of our club and another shared his talent with us at our recent 175th Anniversary Gala,” the group said. “We share this loss and grief with the entire USFS Community.” The statement continued: “We are devastated. … Our thoughts and prayers are with everyone during this tragic time.” The Skating Club of Boston said it was grieving the loss of two skaters, their mothers, and two coaches, theBoston Globereported. The coaches, Evgenia Shishkova and Vadim Naumov, were Russianworld champions and a married couple. They won the pairs figure skating event at the 1994 World Championship and had been living in the United States since 1988 after retiring from competitive skating, transitioning into coaching roles. The search for bodies was continuing Thursday night. The tragedyevoked memories of the February 1961 plane crashin which all 18 members of the U.S. world championship figure skating team and 54 other passengers were killed.",

        "source": "https://www.inquirer.com/",
        "content": "In the Facebook group “¿Qué Pasa, Kennett Square?,” a member of that community posted photos of the vehicle on Jan. 24 with the warning in Spanish that it was “Not ICE.” As Pennsylvania’s immigrant community worries over deportations under the new Trump administration, a vehicle and its driver presenting as a member of “ICE Volunteer Corps” is stirring anxieties inChester County. There is, of course, no such thing as a volunteer division ofImmigrationCustoms and Enforcement, the federal agency the president has tasked to ramp up raids and deport millions of undocumented people in the opening weeks of his second term. But that didn’t stop the driverfrom brandishing the fraudulent ICE stickers on the side and back of a white Jeep this month, one spotted by residents in both West Chester and Kennett Square in recent days — the latter home to thousands of undocumented people who work in the region’s agricultural industry. West Chester University, in a statement sent to the campus community Monday, confirmed that the school had received complaints about the vehicle on its campus. The university confirmed its existence via photos and security footage. “Upon thorough review by the WCU Department of Public Safety, the reported vehicle is not believed to be an official government vehicle,” the statement said. Put more plainly: “We believe that the vehicle’s unofficial signage was meant to create confusion and concern,” the statement continued. Lindsey Sweet, an immigration attorney in Chester County, said she has heard multiple reports of people spotting the vehicle around Kennett Square, the nation’s mushroom-producing capital and home to a growing population of asylum-seeking migrants from countries such as Guatemala, Nicaragua, and Venezuela. According to Sweet, as well as photos viewed by The Inquirer, the vehicle is affixed with what appear to be police lights on top. Sweet said that in addition to the West Chester University sighting, the vehicle had been spotted parked outside aWawastore in the Kennett Square area. “There’s a lot of fear,” Sweet said. “[The Jeep] has really rattled the community, even though it’s a private citizen who has the sticker on their car. It’s caused a lot of fear — unnecessarily.” A spokesperson for ICE in Philadelphia said the agency does not have volunteers but did not return a subsequent request for a statement about the vehicle. An administrative member of the Kennett Square Police Department said that the department did not have knowledge of the vehicle. Meanwhile, members of the Latino community have been quick to take action to dispel fear and rumors. In the Facebook group “¿Qué Pasa, Kennett Square?,” a member of that community posted photos of the vehicle on Jan. 24 with the warning in Spanish that it was “Not ICE.” “We’ve sent the information to the police since it’s illegal what he’s doing,” the user wrote, according to Facebook’s Spanish-to-English translation. “If you see similar cars and you are not sure if they are really ICE, take a picture so you can investigate if they are actually ICE officers.” The post generated a flurry of comments and activity, as users claimed they, too, had spotted the vehicle at Acme, McDonald’s, and other Chester County locations. It is a federal crime to impersonate an ICE officer, and penalties can include fines and imprisonment. West Chester University said its officers were on heightened alert over the vehicle, though security footage did not yield a clear photo of the vehicle’s license plate number. For Sweet, one half of the law firm Sweet & Paciorek, the vehicle incident is just one element of the confusion that has swept her clientele since PresidentDonald Trump’s inauguration this month. Deportations of criminals happened regularly under the Biden administration, though Trump has vowed to ramp up enforcement and overhaul immigration policy to vastly limit the number of migrants in the country. ICE raided a North Philadelphia car washthis week, arresting seven immigrants. Nationally,military cargo planes are being used to fly migrants to Colombia and Border Patrol agents are turning away those who may have previously entered the country and applied for asylum. Sweet said that migrants she works with have varying immigration statuses, though many are asylum-seekers with work authorization who are waiting for immigration court hearings despite a backlog that has led to wait times of up to several years. A major fear among undocumented agricultural workers in Chester County, according to Sweet, is that the Trump administration willexpand its expedited removal policy, meaning those who have yet to have a court hearing could be subject to deportation as they wait to see a judge and make their case for asylum. “There’s a large group of people who are here who are relying on the fact that they’re going to have this court hearing and haven’t done anything about their case yet,” said Sweet, who spent a marathon week advising both nonprofits and individuals about the rights immigrants have during an ICE encounter. “If that court date goes away and they’re now being removed from the United States,” Sweet said, “they’re not prepared for that.”",

        "title": "Philly is down 9 judges, and some officials say the city got snubbed in a deal to fill seats elsewhere",
        "source": "https://www.inquirer.com/",
        "content": "Lawmakers in the state Senate are poised to approve judicial vacancies in 10 counties next week. Philadelphia — which has the most open judicial seats of any county — isn't one of them. Less than a month into the new year, a routine process is causing a squabble in Harrisburg, with some Philadelphia officials expressing frustration over a slate of judges who are set to be appointed next week. The dustup comes after a bipartisan group of lawmakers struck a deal to fill vacancies on courts across 10 Pennsylvania counties. But Philadelphia — which has the largest court system in the state, and where nine judicial seats are empty — isn’t one of them. Several members of Philadelphia’s delegation to Harrisburg are concerned the city was left out of the deal, and the city’s bar association says long vacancies in the Common Pleas Court have had a cascading effect on a stressed system. Seven of the court’s nine open judicial seats have been empty for more than a year. State Sen. Anthony Hardy Williams, a West Philadelphia Democrat who has served in Harrisburg for more than 35 years, said Philadelphia’s exclusion from the slate of appointments sets a precedent that reduces the city’s influence in Harrisburg. He said legislative leaders advanced the slate without input from Philadelphia’s senators. “This was a deal struck without the members of the Philadelphia delegation saying they’re OK with it,” Williams said. “This is an absolute dilution of our Philadelphia delegation’s power. … For us to not be included is an insult.” Other lawmakers said there’s nothing out of the ordinary. The Senate considers slates of judicial appointees on a rolling basis. For example, the state Senate confirmed 10 judges in 2023, five of whom were in Philadelphia. No judges were appointed last year. A spokesperson for Senate Minority Leader Jay Costa (D., Allegheny) declined to comment. State Sen. Nikil Saval, a Democrat who chairs the Philadelphia delegation, said he is hopeful the city’s vacancies will be filled in a future appointment package. Judicial vacancies are nothing new, as judges retire or are appointed to higher courts. To fill open seats outside of election season, Pennsylvania Democratic and Republican leaders typically work with the governor’s office to advance a slate that satisfies both parties. The governor appoints nominees to fill judicial and county row-officevacancies, who then must be approved by a two-thirds vote in the Senate, requiring bipartisan cooperation.(Magisterial district court judges outside Philadelphia require only a majority vote.) An appointed judge fills the remainder of a predecessor’s 10-year term or serves until after the next municipal election, whichever is shorter. In Philadelphia, they make at least $228,400 per year. » READ MORE:Justice delayed: Philly courts’ backlog leaves many jailed for months without a hearing Philadelphia’s Common Pleas Court has the highest number of judicial vacancies of any court system in the state. The court — which is a trial-level court that handles serious crimes,cases involving children and families, and appeals from lower courts — should have 93 judges, but has been operating for months with 84. The Philadelphia Bar Association, which has repeatedly called for lawmakers in Harrisburg to fill the vacancies, said in a statement that additional judges are needed “immediately” to relieve overcrowded schedules. “We simply cannot afford to wait any longer,” said Katayun Jaffari, the chancellor of the Philadelphia Bar Association. “We, again, urge our leaders in Harrisburg and Philadelphia to rise above political concerns and work collaboratively to fill these vacancies.” There are judicial vacancies in other counties, but no other Pennsylvania trial court is as understaffed as Philadelphia’s Common Pleas Court. Allegheny County is down six judges, but the package of appointments legislators are set to consider next weekwould fill three of those seats. Every other county in the state has three or fewer judicial vacancies, according to a list provided by a spokesperson for the state courts system. For Williams, excluding Philadelphia from any deal to fill judicial vacancies is a matter of reducing the city’s influence. He said he expressed his “extreme frustration” to Costa, who told him that Philadelphia was not included in the package because the delegation was not unified behind its nominees to fill the seats. Williams said the discord may have come down to one nominee: Larry Farnese, a former state senator now vying for a judgeship in Philadelphia. Some caucus members expressed discomfort with Farnese’snomination — shades of 2023, when sources saida long-simmering feud with another Philadelphiastate senatortanked Farnese’s chances of being appointedfrom a short list of nominees. Farnese did not respond to a request for comment Thursday. » READ MORE:Philly Democrats’ process of picking ‘magic seat’ judges involved mischief and vengeance this year Despite the internal strife, Williams said the delegation had coalesced around its judicial nominees — including Farnese. He said the group learned the city was left out of the appointment package and submitted a letter to Costa saying its members were in agreement, but by then it was too late, and a deal had already been struck. “This is not just about one judge,” Williams said. “This is about a process and precedent within the caucus. … I’m sounding an alarm because others need to understand if this precedent is established, that means we will go forward with this being normal. And it’s not.”",

As they would later discover, the Kutztown University sophomore had fallen victim to an online sexual-extortion scam by a Nigerian group known as the “Yahoo Boys.” Communicating via Snapchat and Instagram, members of the group posed as a young woman, solicited intimate photos of Sullivan, and then threatened to release them if he didn’t continually send them funds. Sullivan’s death was ruled first a suicide, then a homicide once details of the events leading up to it became clear.

Reporter Abraham Gutman digs into the ongoing debate over the harms of social media use and a Montco family’s quest to keep other young people safe. The Philadelphia region is home to tens of thousands of federal workers in fields ranging from veterans benefits to the National Park Service. On Tuesday, those workers and others across the country received a memo from President Donald Trump’s administration offering them eight months’ pay if they resign by Feb. 6. The directive is part of an effort by the White House to downsize the federal workforce in the name of government efficiency, as well as to ensure employees are “reliable, loyal, trustworthy,” according to the memo. It’s also causing fear that essential services won’t be deployed. “You cannot just pull people out of an organization that provides the breadth of services that we provide that are truly needed, and expect that … there will not be severe impacts on the American people,” a local union rep told The Inquirer.

        "content": "Senate Majority Leader Joe Pittman (R., Indiana) said in an interview earlier this month that Senate Republicans still have reservations about legalizing recreational marijuana. HARRISBURG — Gov.Josh Shapirowill againpitch in his annual budget address next week that Pennsylvania should legalize recreational marijuana andtap into tax revenuelike almost all of its neighboring states. But legalizing recreational marijuana still faces major hurdles in Pennsylvania, where the GOP-controlled state Senate is not sold on the idea. Senate Majority Leader Joe Pittman (R., Indiana) said in an interview earlier this month that SenateRepublicansstill have logistic reservations about marijuana’s federal classification as a Schedule I drug alongside heroin, as well as whether state government could support a recreational program. “It’s a practicality issue more than a philosophical issue,” Pittman said. Meanwhile,Democratslike Shapiro and House Majority Leader Matt Bradford (D., Montgomery) say regulating the adult-use cannabis industry is a no-brainer, when all surrounding states — except West Virginia — are already profiting off Pennsylvanians crossing state lines. “Frankly, we’re losing all kinds of revenue to other states,” Shapiro said in an interview earlier this month. Shapiro proposed a 20% tax on legal marijuana as part of his budget address last year (and the year before). In his 2024 budget pitch, his administration estimated that an adult-use cannabis industry in the statecould bring in $14.8 million in tax revenue in its first yearand would be regulated by the Department of Agriculture. That estimate increased to $76 million in its second year, $160 million in its third, and $230 million in its fourth. Still, some Pennsylvania Republicans seem more open to the cannabis industry after surrounding states,including Ohio, a GOP stronghold, legalized it. And Pennsylvania will need new revenue generators tohelp fill a $4.5 billion budget shortfallas spending is set to outpace revenue beginning this fiscal year and is expected to grow in the coming ones — perhaps increasing lawmakers’ interest in taxing marijuana. » READ MORE:Gov. Josh Shapiro says he ‘got stuff done’ in his first two years. With a budget shortfall on the horizon, his biggest challenges are to come. State Sens. Dan Laughlin (R., Erie) and Sharif Street (D., Philadelphia) introduced a sweeping, bipartisan bill in the last legislative session to legalize and regulate adult-use marijuana. The bill would have set a minimum purchase and use age requirement of 21 years old, created a regulatory board and a cannabis business development fund, strengthened driving-under-the-influence laws for marijuana use, and more. But the bill never came up for a vote. Laughlin has moved into a new leadership role as chairman of the Senate Law and Justice Committee, where a recreational marijuana bill would likely be assigned as the first step of the legislative process. Similar marijuana legalization legislation was introduced in the Democratic-controlled House last session, but it also did not get a vote. But Pittman, the leader of Senate Republicans, still doubts there is widespread support for legalizing recreational marijuana among his caucus — in part, he said, because of the way Pennsylvania implemented its medical marijuana program under former Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf. Pennsylvania legalized medical marijuana in 2016, with dispensaries opening around the state in 2018. But that process was fraught with issues, from weak oversight to unfair application of the law and more. A Spotlight PA investigationfound that a small number of Pennsylvania doctorsapprove most of the state’s medical marijuana cards, among other issues. “Obviously, this state has not done well in rolling out medical marijuana,” Pittman said. “We’ve not demonstrated our ability to have the bureaucracy manage something of that magnitude.” Both Pittman and Bradford said the other chamber should send them a bill to consider. However, Bradford was more confident that his narrow Democratic majority would be able to pass a measure legalizing recreational marijuana, in light of the lack of broad support in the GOP-controlled Senate. “It strikes me as abdicating our responsibility to protect our communities and our children, and at the same time, we are losing revenue that is going to go into our neighboring states,” Bradford said. “Yes, our numbers are close, but we are confident that we can get our numbers together and show that there is a path forward on cannabis.” Dave Sunday, Pennsylvania’s new Republican attorney general, has said he opposes the legalization of adult-use cannabis butsaid that if it is legalized,he would follow state law.",

        "content": "When tight end Chad Lewis went down with an injury during the magical 2004-05 season, Thomason, who played three seasons with the Eagles, got a call he'd never forget. Jeff Thomason was in a work trailer in South Jersey 20 years ago ready to start another Monday morning on a construction site of a new housing development. His phone rang. It was Tom Melvin, anEaglesassistant coach. Thomason played three seasons with the Birds before trading in his helmet for a hard hat. He watched from home the previous night as the Eagles won the NFC title and finally broke through to the Super Bowl. Thomason figured his old coach was calling to thank him for his contributions in prior seasons. Nope. Melvin wanted Thomason to come to South Philly and try out for the Eagles. Chad Lewis, the team’s starting tight end and Thomason’s buddy, broke his foot the night before, catching a touchdown in the team’s 27-10 victory over the Atlanta Falcons. The Birds needed a replacement for the Super Bowl so they called Thomason, then an assistant project manager with Toll Brothers. » READ MORE:Saquon Barkley envisioned being in a position to win a Super Bowl long before wearing Eagles green “It was shocking,” Thomason said. “I kind of thought they were joking with me. Never did I think they would bring me back to play in the game.” Thomason was in. He had retired two years earlier but still missed the game. Of course he would play in the Super Bowl. First, he had to ask his boss. “I was like ‘I’m going to use my two weeks’ vacation, all right?’ He’s like ‘What?’” Thomason said. Thomason aced his tryout and flew to Jacksonville, Fla., in January 2005 with the Eagles. He played tight end and helped on special teams in the Super Bowl moonlighting as a football player on the biggest stage. The Eagles lost to the Patriots, 24-21. It was back to work for Thomason. “It’s a story that needs to be told on TV someday,” said  Thomason, 55 who today lives near Dallas and works in sales. “I didn’t think there was a chance in the world that this guy was ever going to play football again.” Thomason joined the Eagles in 2000, and his first catch with his new team was the touchdown on the opening drive of the Pickle Juice Game, the stunner in Dallas wherethe Andy Reid Era truly took off. Years earlier, Reid rejuvenated Thomason’s career after Green Bay cut him before the 1994 season. Thomason, figuring that football was over, took a job selling shower heads. Reid, then the Packers’ tight ends coach, called and told him to stay in shape,because   the Packers might need him again. Reid called again a year later, and Green Bay signed Thomason. » READ MORE:Moro Ojomo gave ‘Inner Excellence’ to A.J. Brown. The lesser-known Eagle has his own motivational story. “He truly, truly cares about everyone he’s around, so he’s the guy you want to run through a wall for,” Thomason said of Reid,  the Kansas City Chief coach, who opposes the Birds in Super Bowl LIX on Feb. 6. “I could call Andy tomorrow and he’ll pick his phone up and ask how my wife is. He’s just as authentic, as caring, and as real as I’ve ever seen. Everything I do in life, I try to implement that same approach. It makes it real.” Thomason spent a decade in the NFL as a trusty blocker and dependable special teamer who caught 10 touchdowns, all of which ended with him spiking the football and throwing out his arms to make a “T.” “Lord knows I can’t do anything else but stand around. I can’t dance, that’s for sure,” Thomason said. “It had to be something stationary. It had to be something simple. My brother, a long time ago, used to throw the ‘T’ out there, so I did it. The first time I did it, it was more of a ‘Y’ because I was so excited. I slowly got it to ‘T.’” Thomason’s contract with the Eagles ended after the 2002 season, and interest around the league in him was tepid. He accomplished his goal to play 10 seasons, so Thomason walked away after the crushing loss to Tampa Bay in the NFC championship game. » READ MORE:Saquon Barkley took his high school records but gave him a hard-to-top icebreaker He   long had an interest in construction and used some connections to get an entry-level job with Toll Brothers, the home builders based in Fort Washington. Thomason spent six months in the audit department before moving to the trailer, where he made $37,000 and reported to a 25-year-old boss. “It’s hard to walk away from the game,” Thomason said. “It’s your whole life. It’s your whole identity. It’s the only thing I had done since I was 8 years old. You’re really never at peace with it. It’s hard, man. It’s hard to get rid of it. “I knew I could still play but my time in the NFL — it’s Not For Long, obviously — came to an end. But I was never ready to walk away from that. I can tell you that.” Thomason had been away from the team for two seasons, but most of the coaches were the same, the playbook was still fresh in his mind, and the roster was familiar. Thomason had completed triathlons during his retirement and trained in  jujitsu. He was in shape. Everything was in place for him to go from the work site to the Super Bowl. “I just had to make sure my body could move around,” Thomason said. Thomason played in two Super Bowls with the Packers, in the 1996 and 1997 seasons, but his trip with Philly was the first time he had a podium on media day. Thomason spent his career as a backup tight end. For a week, he was the star. Thomason was national news, the feel-good story of the Super Bowl. He was featured onGood Morning America,60 Minutes, and nearly every nightly news broadcast. » READ MORE:Eagles’ Brandon Graham returns to practice ahead of the Super Bowl as he recovers from triceps injury It was special. Thomason made sure to take it all in, knowing this would be his final game. He thought his career ended two years earlier, but instead he got one more night. “The Super Bowl is the greatest thing in the world,” Thomason said. “That opening kickoff, there’s nothing like it with all the flashing lights. I’m so lucky. It was such a blessing. I wish I could’ve helped them win.” The owner of Toll Brothers caught enough grief for making Thomason use his two-week vacation that he announced that any employee who  plays in the Super Bowl, World Series, NBA Finals, or Stanley Cup Finalswould receive an additional two weeks of vacation. Thomason was at ease. Now, he could just play. “It was such a gift,” Thomason said. “I’m so grateful to Andy. I’m so grateful to Tom Melvin. I’m so grateful to the Philadelphia Eagles for giving me that chance. I sat there on that field. It was a loss, and I felt sick to my stomach. But sitting there selfishly and looking at the grass, knowing I’m never going to see that grass again like that. Wearing cleats, shoulder pads, and a helmet. It was pretty crazy.” ",

        "content": "A year after drafting corner Quinyon Mitchell in the first round, the Eagles could tap into Nick Sirianni's connections at Toledo one again. MOBILE, Ala. — A year ago, the Eagles made an initial connection withQuinyon Mitchellat the Senior Bowland the cornerback went on to be their first-round pick in the 2024 NFL draft. Now, a year later, could the Eagles select another defensive player from Toledo in the early rounds this year? Defensive lineman Darius Alexander, the Rockets’ standout player at this year’s Senior Bowl, was difficult to block all week for opposing offensive linemen. At 6-foot-3 and 304 pounds, according to Senior Bowl measurements, Alexander has an explosive first step and strong hand usage to disengage run blocks. In addition to taking snaps as an interior defensive lineman, Alexander showcased an ability to rush the passer as an outside defensive end. One of his best reps of the week came on Thursday during the 11-on-11 team session, beating Oregon left tackle Josh Conerly, one of theearly week standouts, with a double-hand swipe-and-swim move to get into the backfield with what would have been a sack in a live-game situation. » READ MORE:Eagles draft: LSU tight end Mason Taylor could intrigue the Birds after strong Senior Bowl practices “I just see myself as an underdog,” Alexander said after practice. “I just come here, put my head down, and get ready to go to work. I spent time working on my game [and] also getting in the film. … My D-line coach, Frank Okam, he prepared me for moments like this, too.” Toledo coach Jason Candle and Eagles coachNick Sirianniwere teammates and roommates at Division III university Mount Union, and Sirianni coached with current Toledo defensive coordinator Vince Kehres at Mount Union as well. The connections to Siranni’s past surely played a part in the Eagles drafting Mitchell last year and could play a part this year, too, with Alexander. Alexander, from FortWayne, Ind., finished his final college season with 7½ tackles for loss, 3½ sacks, and an interception returned for a touchdown in Toledo’s bowl game victory over Pittsburgh. Alexander says he has been talking to Mitchell “all day, every week” and says playing  with Mitchell on the Eagles “would be great.” “We got great coaches, great staff, great people on campus and then throughout the city of Ohio that motivate us to push us to be great,” Alexander said. “And we just want to come out here and show them that [Toledo] got players that could come out here and compete with the best.” ThoughJalen CarterandJordan Davishave played at a high level, the Eagles could lose defensive tackle Milton Williams to free agency this offseason and could be in the market to add  a player to that mix. The Toledo standout will be in demand this week. After practice, Pittsburgh Steelers assistant general manager Andy Weidl, who previously worked with the Eagles, introduced himself to Alexander and has another meeting planned with him. The Eagles have also met with Alexander this week. » READ MORE:Eagles draft: Offensive tackles Josh Conerly and Emery Jones showcase their potential on Day 1 at the Senior Bowl Alexander is expected to be a Day 2  draft selection, and his performance this week not only strengthened his stock but proved that he can be an every-down player at three-technique, which would replace Williams’ role seamlessly. No one may have made themselves more money this week than Texas A&M edge rusher Shemar Stewart, whose explosiveness at 6-5, 281 pounds, per Senior Bowl measurements, is unmatched by any player who competed at the Senior Bowl. Stewart’s production with the Aggies has been underwhelming (4½ sacks in three seasons), but his traits were on full display during practice this week. Though the Miami native opted not to practice on Day 3 of the Senior Bowl, nor play in the game on Saturday, his best rep came during Wednesday’s session for the American team. On the play, Stewart turned the corner on LSU’s Emery Jones before he could lay a finger on him, then knocked the ball out of Mississippi quarterback Jaxson Dart’s hand. “I’ve been tall, big, all my whole, my whole life, and [living in] South Florida, you had to learn how to move with the best of them. So I feel like that’s where I got my movement skills from,” Stewart said. “During the offseason, I just go and work on seeing the hands. … While I was training with coach Nathan O’Neal, I was working on just seeing the hands, getting my accuracy on hitting hands better.” The other player who generated plenty of buzz this week was Marshall’s Mike Green, a  small-school pass rusher who proved he could back up the production he put out on tape. Green, who finished with 22½ tackles for loss and 17 sacks in a breakout redshirt sophomore season, produced a viral clip on Wednesday when he barreled over Oregon’s Conerly during a one-on-one pass-rushing session. The  native of Williamsburg, Va.,   opted out of Thursday’s practice, like Stewart, but displayed his upside as a run defender this week as well. Green entered the week in the first-round discussion and will leave the week firmly in that range. Though he may not last until the Eagles’ pick late in the first round, Green should be on their radar with Josh Sweat potentially departing in the offseason.",

But of course, that’s relative. They’re affordablecompared to other places. I’ve written about how a lot of homebuyers in our areacan’t comfortably afford the homes for sale. Well, apartment renters are in the same boat. A new Redfin analysis found that, actually, the Philadelphia metro area is one of the least affordable major metros for its renters, based on their incomes. The online real estate brokerage looked specifically at renters living in apartment buildings with five or more units. There’s been a lot of apartment construction across the country and in Philly, which helps to tame rent growth. Still, the typical renter household in the Philly area makes $15,630 less than they need to comfortably afford the typical apartment that was listed for rent last month. Keep reading to see where the Philly region ranks among major metros in rental affordability for residents andhow much renters here need to make to afford apartments.

        "title": "‘Fear and anxiety:’ What Trump’s ban on federal support for gender-affirming care means for Philly transgender teens",
        "source": "https://www.inquirer.com/",
        "content": "The order, widely expected to be challenged in court, could block recipients from being able to receive the treatments and have a chilling effect on providers willing to offer care. A few weeks afterDonald Trumpwon the presidential election, Wesley Hiester and his mom went to see Hiester’s doctor to ask about stockpiling a larger supply of testosterone. The 17-year-old, who started hormone therapy when he was a high school freshman, was concerned that there could be restrictions placed on the gender-affirming treatments he received. He wanted to be prepared. This week, Trumpissued an order barring federal funding of gender-affirming carefor people under the age of 19. The executive order directs agencies to cease grants and other funding that could be used for hormone therapy, puberty blockers, or surgeries for transgender children. It also directs the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to review the terms of publicly funded coverage under Medicare, Medicaid, and the Affordable Care Act to curtail gender-affirming care. The order, widely expected to be challenged in court, could prevent those recipients from being able to receive the treatments and have a chilling effect on providers willing to offer gender-affirming care, doctors and legal experts said. “Obviously, going into Trump’s presidency we all knew what his agenda was,” said Hiester, who lives in West Chester. “I wasn’t shocked but the worst is he raised the age to 19, so I have another year to worry about this. I’m a senior. I’m committed to college. I should be enjoying every single moment but now, first with the election and now this, it’s really hard to focus on the good things.” Hiester has private health insurance and believes that for now, he will still have access to his hormone therapy, but he and others in the transgender community are concerned about a cascading effect that could threaten access, depending on how the order is interpreted. And the larger impact, Hiester and others have stressed, is the mental and emotional toll as Trump’s directives pile up. One of Trump’s most vocal promises on the campaign trail was to end gender-affirming care. On his first day in the White House,he declared his administration would recognize only two genders. And a slew of executive orders have targeted transgender people, including a directive thatthe military adopt a policy that being transgender is incompatiblewith “high standards for troop readiness,” and an order dropped Thursday banning “radical gender ideology,” in schools. The order about minor care, titled “Protecting Children From Chemical and Surgical Mutilation,” describes widely medically approved transgender care in inflammatory and misleading language, claiming children are being “maimed” and “sterilized.” While the order suggests this medical treatment is routine,very few minors undergo surgery to affirm genderand a small percentage of the adolescent population seeks gender therapies. Gender-affirming care for children and adolescents has been deemed medically appropriate by the American Academy of Pediatrics and other major medical and mental health organizations. Research shows young people with gender dysphoriasuffer higher ratesof suicide, self-harm, depression, and anxiety. Gender-affirming carebroadly refers tomedical services intended for people whose gender identity does not match the gender they were assigned at birth. Care could range from voice coaching and hair removal to hormone therapy and surgery. Trump’s order specifically applies to chemical (such as hormonal treatments) and surgical therapies. Conservative lawmakers’ defense of gender-affirming care bans often argue some therapies are irreversible and could come with side effects such as the risk of fertility loss. But researchers and medical professionals saymore research needs to be done to confirm the accuracy of any side effects, and LGBTQ advocates note that de-transitioning is extremely rare. “His order has the potential of making gender-affirming care very difficult, if not impossible, to get even for adults and more specifically for adults who are financially or otherwise already underserved and already marginalized,” said Shanin Gross, a family medicine doctor in South Jersey who specializes in gender-affirming care. In Pennsylvania and New Jersey, clinics, hospitals, and organizations that serve transgenderand nonbinary people urged calm. The action is likely to face challenges while they aretrying to sort out what its implementation could mean for their work. A primary concern is that medical institutions that receive federal funding for research or education grants that also provide care to transgender youth could lose funding. Gross, a 55-year-old doctor fromCherry Hill, worries that the order’s restrictions on Medicaid and Medicare could discourage doctors from providing gender-related care through these government-funded programs providing health coverage for low-income children and families, people with disabilities, and seniors. Gross also fearsthe order could trigger sanctions that would prevent a doctor from participating in Medicaid or Medicare. “I think that the goal behind the whole executive order and the intentionally broad and vague way it is written is to frighten as many health systems and individual providers as possible into thinking that they will lose funding or otherwise be unable to conduct business,” Gross said. “And the implication of the government officials with no medical training controlling what medical treatments we are allowed to have is terrifying and something we all should want to avoid.” The order could further restrict access to treatments that can already be difficult to get for minors in the U.S. Twenty-six states have restricted youth access to gender-affirming care, which remains legal in Pennsylvania and New Jersey. “Clearly the intent of the executive order is to create a climate of fear and anxiety that will result in care deprivation,” said Harper Seldin, an attorney with the ACLU. Sultan Shakir, president and executive officer of the Mazzoni Center — Philadelphia’s biggest LGBTQ health agency — denounced the action, stressing that “transgender people of all ages” are “entitled to the care and opportunities that others take for granted to live lives recognized as their full selves.” TheCenter Citynonprofit provides medical care for transgender individuals including hormone therapy. The Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia runs one of the nation’s largest clinics providing medical care and mental health support for transgender and gender nonbinary children and teens and their families. The hospital’sGender & Sexuality Development Programwas founded in 2014. In 2021, more than 800 new families sought care — a record surge from the prior year when between 250 to 350 families received services,according to CHOP. Trump’s order directs the head of HHS to take all appropriate steps to end gender-affirming care, including scrutinizing Medicare or Medicaid “conditions of participation or conditions for coverage” and “clinical abuse or inappropriate use” of state Medicaid programs. It’s not clear what the impact on CHOP could be. CHOP said in a statement Thursday that its “top priority is always the safety and well-being of the patient families we treat, ensuring that each child has a chance for a healthy future, while complying with applicable laws and directives. We look forward to continuing to work closely with our partners in government to make sure that the needs of children and their families come first.” For several transgender individuals and their parents interviewed, the worry is that therapies and support groups they depend on could shutter. Joanne, 52, of Center City, is concerned that her daughter, who has been on a two-year waitlist for surgery, could have to wait even longer. The Inquirer isn’t printing Joanne’s last name to protect her daughter, who she fears will face public backlash. The mother said she’s looked into surgery in Thailand but worries about the language barrier. As her daughter starts looking at schools, she’s urged her to apply to universities in Canada. “I’m at the point where I don’t think we can beat them anymore so I don’t know how much I can try, and I’m certainly not going to join them, so the third option is to run away,” she said. Gender-affirming care is expensive, something parents who’ve gone through the process worried about this week. Dawn Bowman, whose 20-year-old son is transgender, said her family sold a life insurance policy to help pay for therapies when he was in his teens. “At a point, I realized this is a life or death thing,” she said. “What really gets lost in this discussion is that when these kids go through the wrong puberty, they self-harm. It’s OK to not understand things but to demonize people because you don’t understand them, and say they’re you’re to help them, you’re actually hurting them.” As Trump ends just his second week in office, Hiester is trying to focus on school, playing tennis, and his job as a lifeguard. In the fall, he’ll head to college in Washington, D.C., where he wants to study education to become a high school teacher. He’s inspired by teachers who supported him over a tough last four years. “The larger impact of all this, is just how much hatred there is…that can have such an effect on, especially, younger trans people,” Hiester said. “People who are just trying to live their lives and be a kid.” Staff writer Harold Brubaker contributed to this article.",

He is best known for his lethal shot and burst onto the scene with 39 goals and 74 points as a rookie with Vancouver in 2022-23. But Kuzemko hasn't come anywhere near replicating that league-best 27.3% shooting percentage the past two seasons. An unrestricted free agent at season's end, Kuzmenko appears to have a 29-game tryout to show chemistry with Michkov and rediscover his scoring touch.

        "content": "Ahead of the March launch of Smith's first album in 20 years, 'Based on a True Story,' the actor is 'flying as an Eagle, fresh out of Philly.' Big Willie is back on the scene. Oscar-winning actor Will Smith is releasing his first album in two decades,Based on a True Story, in March. His latest track, “Beautiful Scars,” proves the Fresh Prince still has it. The West Philly native, 56, weaves in an Eagles tribute on the OmArr and LeXoskleteon-produced track. “Fly as an Eagle, fresh out of Philly. Yeah, I still rep the city. Mirrors on the wall, worth half a billi,” Smith raps in a video he posted on social media on Tuesday. “Beautiful Scars” explores the perils of fame, the journey of self-acceptance, and the lessons learned through hardship. The song is accompanied by a music video inspired by the Keanu Reeves sci-fi classic,The Matrix. The video starts off with scenes from a2019 video, where Smith described his regretful decision to pass on the role of Neo to play Captain James West in the box office flop,Wild Wild West. “It’s one of those stories I’m not proud of, but it’s the truth. I did turn down Neo inThe Matrix. I’m not proud of it.” With rapper Big Sean playing a Morpheus-like role, he asks Smith to make the ultimate decision: blue pill or red pill. “Blue pill, everything remains the same and you get to move on with your life. Red pill, you get to go back and star in that movie that got away. The choice is yours,” he raps. “I really like my life right now,” Smith replies. Caught between the two options, Smith opts to live on in this AI-run world, maintaining the life he’s led with no regrets — Chris Rock slap and all. The rest of the video, directed by Adil El Arbi and Bilall Fallah (Bad Boys: Ride of Die), switches between re-imagined scenes from the film, and behind-the-scenes footage of the music video. The six-minute video closes with a cryptic message from the simulation: “Wake up, Will. The matrix has you.” Through it all, Smith has remained loyal to Philly sports. At the 40th Grammy Awards, he accepted hisBest Rap Solo Performance awardfor “Men in Black” wearing a Phillies cap and jersey. More recently, ahead of the Eagles’ Week 13 matchup against the Baltimore Ravens, he posted a video reaffirming his family’s fandom. A post shared by Will Smith (@willsmith) “This is a sensitive situation for our family, and we goin’ keep it real simple today,” Smith said as he panned the camera to a small group. “The first thing we want to know is, ‘Where’s Philly at?’.” The caption for the video, which the Eagles team later reposted, included the very fight song Smith referenced on his new track. “On game day, it’s FLY EAGLES FLY in this household 🦅😂🦅. Philly vs Bmore today!!,” Smith wrote.",

        "content": "Before dating Travis Kelce, the Berks County native was an Eagles fan. Now, she’s a Chiefs fan — and that likely isn’t changing before the Super Bowl. Taylor Swiftis now the world’s most famous Chiefs fan, thanks to her high-profile relationship with tight end Travis Kelce. But before she became a staple at Arrowhead Stadium, Swift was a Birds fan from Berks County. Swift and Kelce’s storybegan in 2023after Kelce attended her Eras Tour show at Arrowhead Stadium,armed with a friendship braceletwith his phone number on it — that he didn’t get to give her because “she doesn’t meet people before or after her shows.” There’s photo evidence of her meeting Aaron Rodgers after one of her shows at MetLife Stadium, so that’s notquitetrue. And onNew Heights,Jason Kelcespeculated Swift rebuffed him because the Chiefs had just beaten the Eagles in theSuper Bowl. ”She probably just hasn’t gotten over the Super Bowl yet,” Jason said. “She’s a big Eagles fan.” Despite her fandom, the relationship continued to grow withsurprise appearances at Chiefs games,Kelce family vacations, and even Travisappearing on stage at one of her shows. But at some point, that fandom changed. » READ MORE:From Bradley Cooper to Taylor Swift: Who has the better Super Bowl fan base? A totally unbiased (not really) take. At an earlier tour stop at Lincoln Financial Field, Swift confirmed she was a Birds fan and had included a reference to the team in her song “Gold Rush” — “Eagles T-shirt hanging from the door.” “There was sort of a — I don’t know how large the debate was — the debate about I have a lyric that says, ‘my Eagles T-shirt hanging from the door,’” Swiftsaid of the song while performing the Eras Tourat Lincoln Financial Field. “I saw some people wondering if it was the band, the Eagles, or the team, the Eagles. Guys, come on. I’m from Philly, of course it’s the team.” She was spotted entering her New York recording studio, Electric Lady Studios, in an Eagles crew neck in 2023, so the Birds fandom is recent. At least until her relationship with Kelce began later that year. Swift also met Andy Reid years prior, when he was still with the Eagles. “Yeah, listen, she’s been great. I knew her before, from Philadelphia. Her dad played at [the University of] Delaware and was a big football fan and good guy,” Reidsaid on theLet’s Gopodcast in 2024. “So I had met him there and her. … That was the last thing Trav wanted to hear, that I knew her before him.

        "content": "Burks was called into action for the 49ers in Super Bowl LVIII when Dre Greenlaw went down with an injury. This time Burks is filling in for Nakobe Dean. The next-man-up mentality is part of the ethos of the sport. For Oren Burks, it is more than just part of football, it is pretty much his entire seven-year NFL career. Burks has never been a full-time starter. He’s a special teams ace, a leader in the locker room, and a hole filler whose number only gets called when someone else goes down. From special teamer to starting in theSuper Bowl, it’s been an interesting first season with the Eagles for the 29-year-old linebacker, but it’s not an entirely new experience. Rewind to last February, when Burks was the third linebacker with the San Francisco 49ers. He played 34% of the defensive snaps during the regular season, by far the most in his career. He played 20 snaps in San Francisco’s first playoff game and 16 in a conference championship victory over the Detroit Lions. He was going to have a similar role in the Super Bowl, but then Dre Greenlaw suffered a freak Achilles injury running onto the field in the second quarter. » READ MORE:Eagles’ Brandon Graham returns to practice Burks was next in line. He played 71 snaps, his second-highest total in an NFL game, and he struggled. The Kansas City Chiefs targeted Burks nine times in coverage and completed t all nine passes, including one for a touchdown. It was one of Burks’ worst games by Pro Football Focus grading in his career as the Chiefs won, 25-22, in overtime. One year later, Burks is in a similar spot, though it’s far from the same. Nakobe Dean’s season-ending injury occurred during the wild-card win over Green Bay and Burks has been starting ever since. His play has gotten better, too. Burks had one of the best games of his career during the Eagles’ 55-23 NFC championship victory over Washington. He recorded nine tackles, including a sack and a forced fumble. This from a guy who missed so much of training camp with a knee injury that his roster spot wasn’t a guarantee. The Eagles brought him in on a one-year deal to provide some depth at linebacker, but he barely got on the field in camp. He was initially cut before being named to the practice squad and then receiving a promotion to the 53-man roster. “I had one or two practices and then the last preseason game and that was my resumé,” Burks said. “I really just believed in this locker room and wanted to be here and wanted to prove that I should be here. “That’s been my whole career, just trying to find a way to add value. And that’s whether it’s on [special] teams, whether it’s on defense, being a great locker room guy, being a great leader, just embracing that.” Burks, of course, isn’t happy how his opportunity happened. Burks started in Week 17 when Dean had an abdominal injury and then again in Week 18 when the Eagles rested their starters. But Burks  expected to be back on the bench as Dean returned for  the playoffs. The Eagles have a deep and talented roster, but linebacker was a big question mark entering the 2024 season. Dean had yet to excel, Zack Baun was an unknown, Burks was a special teams ace, Devin White looked good at times in camp but didn’t earn a job, and Jeremiah Trotter Jr. was a fifth-round draft pick. Linebacker, however, has turned into a strength. Dean emerged as a key player after missing most of 2023 with an injury, and Baun, initially signed as a potential rotational edge rusher, turned into an All-Pro off-ball linebacker.Vic Fangiohas gotten a lot out of the group, and he’s getting a lot out of Burks now, too. But even before Burks’ number was called as a starter, he started the playoffs with a pop, forcing a fumble on the opening kickoff of the wild-card game against the Packers. “The season has a lot of ebbs and flows, but this is the big one that you’ve been preparing for your whole life,” Burks said. Dean is still part of all this, Burks said. He’s out in California rehabbing after surgery to repair a torn patellar tendon in his knee, but his smiling face was seen on FaceTime after the game Sunday, and Burks said he was looking forward to seeing Dean in New Orleans. “He’s just as much a part of that win as any of us,” Burks said. » READ MORE:Meet the Moms: Inside the ‘sisterhood’ that supports the rise of the Eagles’ homegrown Philly Dawgs defense As for how he’s able to help some of the guys who weren’t in the locker room for a Super Bowl vs. the Chiefs, Burks said he made sure to let Baun know how crazy things would be once they left Philadelphia and arrived in New Orleans. On the field, Burks knows how good of a route-runner Travis Kelce is and how difficult the Chiefs will make things on the Eagles defense. And that Mahomes guy? “Don’t give him too much time at the end,” Burks said. “That’s one of the big things, a common theme. He’s a hell of a quarterback. He comes through in those clutch moments.”",

        "content": "Antonio Merlo previously worked at the University of Pennsylvania Drexel Universityhas tapped an Italian-born political economist who formerly worked at the University of Pennsylvania and currently serves as a dean at New York University as its next president. Antonio Merlo, 61, dean of the faculty of the College of Arts & Science, will replace interim president Denis P. O’Brien on July 1. O’Brien became leader of the 22,100-student West Philadelphia university in September afterJohn A. Fry, who led Drexel for 14 years, was named president ofTemple University. Merlo, who spent 14 years as a scholar and leader at Penn, where he also coachedmen’s water poloand led the team tothree championship titlesin the Mid Atlantic Division of the Collegiate Water Polo Association, was chosen following the work of a search committee including trustees, faculty members, students and administrators that lasted just under six months. » READ MORE:Drexel will trim senior leaders’ salaries, slash retirement benefits, and consider layoffs in the face of its $63 million operating loss “Dr. Merlo is the ideal leader to uphold Drexel’s values and guide the university into its next chapter,” Richard Greenawalt, outgoing chair of Drexel’s board of trustees said in a statement. “His commitment to academic entrepreneurship and his proven success in bringing together faculty, students, scholars, and practitioners to address critical societal challenges are particularly vital as we move forward with strategic institutional priorities, including an academic transformation already underway, and focus on building long-term financial resilience.” Merlo comes as Drexel, along with many other colleges, continues to cope with financial challenges as the college-going pool declines, faith in higher education wanes, and competition increases. In September, the schoolasked several deansto step down as part of consolidating two colleges and one of its schools into a new entity. It’s part of a larger academic restructuring, which also includes plans to move from a quarter system to a semester system over the next few years. Later that fall, college leaders announced the school had experienced a 15% decline in first-year students and a $63 million operating loss. In November, Drexellaid off 60 employees, and another 155, or 3.6% of the workforce, opted for a voluntary retirement incentive program. » READ MORE:Drexel lays off 60 employees The school at that time said it wasaiming to come upwith $150 million through cuts and revenue increases to regain a positive operating margin by 2027. It already had identified much of those cuts; some of the work may now fall to Merlo. “I am absolutely thrilled to be asked to lead this institution, which I have admired from a distance for some time,” Merlo said in a 20-minute interview, shortly after the board approved his hire. He cited the college’s co-op program that places students in paid work experiences as part of their core learning and the school’s willingness to adapt to changing conditions. “I consider myself an academic entrepreneur,” he said. “I see myself as such in every leadership role I’ve had. This just feels like such a fantastic fit.” At NYU,Merlo prioritized fundraisingand “right-sizing staff,” Drexel said, noting that NYU’s Arts & Science school raised its most amount of money ever in 2024. Right-sizing, Merlo said, means trying to allocate the right talent to the right task and re-targeting resources to where they are most needed. “I’m an economist,” he said, “so I understand very well that concept that we maximize our objective functions subject to the constraints we face.” Drexel, like most private colleges, declined to release Merlo’s salary, which will eventually become available through public tax forms. His predecessor, Fry, earned $2.2 million in total compensation in 2022, with a base salary of more than $886,000. Merlo’s initial focus will be making sure Drexel’s projects, including its academic structural changes, get completed and that “we land the plane in the best possible way,” he said. » READ MORE:Salus president was surprised by merger partner Drexel’s financial woes: ‘We’re not happy about it’ Merlo isn’t the first president born outside the U.S. to lead Drexel. The lateConstantine “Taki” Papadakis, who served as president from 1995 until his death in 2009, was born in Greece. Papadakis oversaw a major expansion of Drexel, transforming it from a struggling engineering school to a strong institution with a law school and medical school. Born in a small town outside of Milan, he grew up in a working-class family and was a first-generation college student whose father, now, 95, “still wonders when I’m going to get a real job,” Merlo said. He began playing water polo at age 12, and it grew into a passion, he said during a 2020 interview on a sports program. He got his undergraduate degree in economics and social sciences from Bocconi University in Italy in 1987, came to the United States in 1988, and earned his doctorate in economics from NYU. He started his career as an assistant professor at the University of Minnesota in 1992 and worked there for six years before returning to NYU as an associate professor of economics. In 2000, he joined Penn where he worked for 14 years, serving as an economics professor, chair of the department and director of the Penn Institute for Economic Research. In 2009, he received the Lindback Foundation Award for Distinguished Teaching. In hiring Merlo in 2000, a Penn deandescribed himas one of the leading experts in the nation on the political economy, according to The Daily Pennsylvanian. In a 2013 story by the student newspaper, he was described as “gregarious, articulate, passionate and intense,” in regard to his coaching. » READ MORE:As Drexel undergoes a presidential transition, its leaders outline plans and problems to overcome He joined Rice University in 2014 where he was an economics professor and chaired the department, later becoming dean of its school of social sciences. There, he also worked with government agencies and nonprofit groups to set up a public policy research institute, according to Drexel. Since 2019, he’s served as dean of NYU’s largest academic unit, overseeing three schools, as well as departments, research centers, institutes and language and cultural houses. During his tenure, five new centers fostering cross-disciplinary work have been started, as well as an office of research. His research has explored the economic impact of public policy and he has written about how the economy affects voting and crime and “the career decisions of politicians.” Merlo also coached water polo at Rice and NYU, in addition to Penn, and three times has been named coach of the year. Merlo said he learned important lessons from coaching that he has applied to every leadership he’s had: “Coaches don’t win championships. Teams win championships. The job of the coach is just to put together the best possible team and then guide them through and help them achieve their full potential. “And you need the right team. How do you motivate and inspire people in doing their particular role on a team? ...How do you make this a fulfilling and inspirational mission for each member of your team? That’s when magic happens.” In addition to water polo, Merlo said he also enjoys the opera and cooking: “Risotto is my absolute specialty.” Mike Lawrie, incoming board of trustees’ chair who led the search committee, called Merlo “a rising star in higher education. He has championed new initiatives and taken on leadership roles at every institution that he has served, while endearing himself to students, faculty and staff along the way.” Lawrie, who is founder and CEO of the Lawrie Group, a consulting and management firm, and founder, chair andCEO of TLG Acquisition One Corp., will replace Greenawalt as board chair, the school announced. Drexel’sLawrie Advanced Global Leadership Programis named after him.",

        "content": "The state attorney general and governor's office did not confirm the announcement by Prospect Medical Holdings, however. Bankrupt Prospect Medical Holdings announced Friday that it intends to sell bankrupt Crozer Health to a “not-for-profit consortium of health-care operators,” with state involvement in its plan,but state officials from the attorney general and the governor’s office monitoring the bankruptcy did not immediately confirm that a deal had been reached. The announcement did not name the health-care operators who would participate in the consortium. Prospect, which filed for bankruptcy Jan. 11, has been negotiating with representatives of Gov.Josh Shapiro’s administration and the state attorney general to transfer Crozer to a new nonprofit. State officials have been involved because the state has been working for more than a year keep the hospitals open. Prospect said in an emergency sale motion Friday that an agreement was reached “merely hours” before “the potentially unavoidable decision to shut hospital doors and begin turning away patients” would have been made. “The proposed sale remains subject to definitive documentation,” Prospect said. If an agreement is reached, a bankruptcy hearing would be held Thursday to seek emergency approval of the sale. At the opening bankruptcy hearing Jan. 14, Prospect’s lawyer made clear that one of the company’s top priorities in the bankruptcy was unloading Crozer, which has a $130 million operating last year, according to the lawyer. The lawyer, Thomas R. Calfano, of Sidley Austin, predicted that the company would soon be back with an emergency motion to sell Crozer — or close it. This is a developing story and will be updated.",

        "title": "Tariffs on Canada and Mexico may hike these prices",
        "source": "https://6abc.com/",
        "content": "Tariffson goods fromMexicoand Canada that are set to take effect could hike the price of a gallon of gasoline for some drivers by as much as 70 cents and send grocery bills climbing, experts told ABC News. The Trump administration this week reiterated plans to slap 25% tariffs on all products from Canada and Mexico on Feb. 1. Those countries make up two of the three largest U.S. trading partners, government data shows. Tariffs of this magnitude would likely increase prices paid by U.S. shoppers, since importers typically pass along a share of the cost of those higher taxes to consumers, experts said. The policy could raise prices for an array of products ranging from tomatoes to tequila to auto parts. The scary thing is the list of products is very, very long, said Jason Miller, a professor of supply-chain management at Michigan State University. The price impact remains unclear, however, since businesses within the supply chain could opt to take on some or all of the tax burden, some experts added, noting the tariffs may not take effect at all since Trump has previously used them as a source of leverage in international negotiations. In response to ABC News' request for comment, a White House spokesperson touted Trump's previous economic policies, including tariffs. In his first administration, President Trump instituted an America First economic agenda of tariffs, tax cuts, deregulation, and an unleashing of American energy that resulted in historic job, wage, and investment growth with no inflation. In his second administration, President Trump will again use tariffs to level the playing field and usher in a new era of growth and prosperity for American industry and workers,\" White House spokesperson Kush Desai told ABC News. Here's what to know about which products could see price increases as result of the tariffs, according to experts: Mexico and Canada account for 70% of U.S. crude oil imports, which make up a key input for the nations gasoline supply, according to theU.S. Energy Information Administration, a government agency. Those imports come primarily from Canada, which sends crude oil to U.S. refineries built specifically to process the crude and redistribute it as car-ready gasoline, Timothy Fitzgerald, a professor of business economics at the University of Tennessee who studies the petroleum industry, told ABC News. Gasoline that originates as Canadian crude reaches customers in the upper Midwest as well as some along the East and West coasts, Fitzgerald said. For those drivers, he added, prices could rise between 40 and 70 cents per gallon of gasoline. You could definitely be looking at 50 cent-a-gallon increases in a lot of parts of the country, Fitzgerald added, noting that the effects would be limited to the regions that rely on imported crude. The tariff-related price increase may combine with a seasonal price hike set to take effect within weeks, since demand for gas typically grows as travel picks up in the warmer spring weather, experts said. That seasonal price impact could add another 30 cents per gallon, putting the total increase in gasoline prices at $1 per gallon if the tariffs remain in place at the onset of spring, Fitzgerald said. The U.S. imported $38.5 billion in agricultural goods from Mexico in 2023, making it the top recipient of such products,U.S Department of Agriculturedata showed. Those imports include more than $3 billion worth of fresh fruits and vegetables. Mexican imports account for a large share of some fruits and vegetables routinely eaten by Americans. Roughly 90% of avocados eaten in the U.S. last year originated in Mexico, USDA data showed. Other products with a high concentration of Mexican imports include tomatoes, cucumbers, bell peppers, jalapenos, limes and mangos, Miller said. It would be difficult for the U.S. to replace those goods with domestic production or an alternative supplier, making it likely that prices would rise significantly if the tariffs take effect, he added. Youd certainly expect to see an impact on prices, Miller said. The U.S. also imports large quantities of beer, tequila and other alcoholic beverages from Mexico, experts said. In 2022, the U.S. imported about $26 billion worth of alcoholic drinks from Mexico, according to theUSDA. Dont forget all that beer we import from Mexico, Miller said. Carmakers and consumers depend on the auto industrys deep ties to Canada and Mexico, making tariffs a threat to prices, experts said. Mexico and Canada make up the top two U.S. trading partners for both finished motor vehicles and car parts, according to aCato Instituteanalysis of data from the U.S. International Trade Commission. In 2023, Canada and Mexico accounted for nearly $120 billion worth of U.S. motor vehicle imports, which totaled about 47% of all such vehicles imported that year. Canada and Mexico made up nearly the same share of auto parts imports that year, the Cato Institute analysis showed. The operations of auto companies on both sides of the border will be hugely affected by these tariffs, Robert Lawrence, a professor of trade and investment at Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government, told ABC News.",

        "content": "Fifteen years ago, Miriam Helmick was sentenced to life without parole for the murder of her second husband, Colorado businessman Alan Helmick. She currently sits behind bars at the Colorado Womens Correctional Facility serving a prison sentence for a crime she says she did not commit. Now, Miriam Helmick is speaking publicly for the first time since her conviction, offering details about her relationship with Alan and the events of the fateful day when he died. It won't be over for anybody until it's over for me, and I do have hopes, Helmick said. I know that I didn't kill him. Helmick spoke with ABC News' John Quiñones in a prison interview for a new 20/20 airing Friday, January 31, at 9 p.m. ET on ABC, and streaming the next day on Hulu. The couple's story began on the dance floor. Miriam, a dance instructor, taught Alan ballroom dancing and their friendship blossomed into romance. Their nuptials were a second marriage for them both, and they had dreams of sharing a life together. Miriam describes Alan as a very kind, very sweet man. She said he was funny and well liked in the community. He always had your best interest at heart usually, Miriam Helmick said about Alan. Their dreams came to a sudden and tragic end on June 10, 2008. Miriam said she was running errands that morning and planned to meet Alan for lunch. When she couldnt reach him by phone, she told police she returned to their Whitewater, Colorado, home and found her husband lying in a pool of blood. The house appeared ransacked, and Miriam frantically called 911. Robin Martin, an investigator with the Mesa County Sheriffs Office who worked on the case, remembered how the first officers who arrived on the scene said they found Miriam distraught and kneeling over her husband. Alan was on the floor in the kitchen, Martin said. It looked like he had been shot in the head. We had a bullet casing next to his body. Police found no one else in the house. As they conducted a sweep of the home, they noticed drawers pulled out in the kitchen and a trash can tipped over in Alans office. Investigators followed routine protocol to thoroughly review the spouses whereabouts. They tested Miriam for gunshot residue and swabbed her clothes for blood. Those tests came back negative. She even showed police all the printed receipts from where she was shopping that day. \"She actually went from one end of the valley to the other end, Mesa County Prosecutor Rich Tuttle said. We were able to track her movements not only by her receipts, but by her cellphone interacting with cellphone towers. Miriam also told police about a shocking incident that happened just six weeks earlier. Miriam said that someone had attempted to blow up Alans car. The couple had been in nearby Delta, Colorado, when Miriam went to the restroom and came back to see Alans car on fire. A wick was found in the gas tank. He came in saying that his car was on fire, and he asked me to get water, and that's all I know about it from there, Miriam Helmick told 20/20. When investigators in Delta asked Alan if Miriam could have been the one to start the fire, Alan insisted she would not have done that and asked that police stop the investigation. Oh God. No, I don't think that, Alan Helmick is heard on a recording of the police interview about the fire incident in Delta, Colorado. Why would she do that? In her 20/20 interview, Miriam Helmick suggested that Alan might have started the fire himself. She said that he could have been trying to collect insurance money. The thing about Alan (was) if he had thought I had done it, he'd have helped me pack a bag, put me on I-70, Helmick said. According to Miriam, Alan told her the investigation was done and that was the last they spoke of it. As days passed with no suspects in custody for Alan's murder, Miriam Helmick said she became convinced she was being watched, reporting that weird things were happening around her house. Then weeks after Alans death, Miriam said she found a disturbing card on her doorstep with a message inside that said, Allen[sic]was first, your[sic]next. Run, run, run! It was a mysterious note that made Miriams friends worry for her safety and that she may be the next target. Miriam calls me and shes frantic, Jeri Yarbrough recalled of the incident with her friend. She goes, What should I do? And I said, Well, you need to hang up the phone and call the police and get out of there. I said, because somebody could be there trying to hurt you. When Martin investigated the card, she said she was shocked by what she tracked down. The surveillance video from the store where the card was purchased showed it was Miriam Helmick who bought that greeting card. It was her. She was wearing the same style of shirt that she had walked in with her[police]interview, Martin said. In her interview with ABC News Correspondent John Quiñones, Helmick claimed that she saw suspicious cars driving around her property in the time after Alans death and that she felt police were not taking it seriously. She said she wrote the card herself in the hopes that police would up their investigation. \"Maybe it was a really bad decision, Miriam said, but at the same time, I thought they would come out and actually look to see who this person was because it didn't seem to be care very much about my safety at that point, and they hadn't told me that I was a person of interest. Prosecutors said Miriam alone was responsible for Alans death. Six months after the murder, Miriam was charged with first-degree murder, attempted murder for the car fire incident and several counts of forgery. Prosecutors claimed Miriams motive for murder was money. There were suspicious bank account activity where it appeared that Miriam had forged multiple checks from Alan's account, Tuttle said. All told, she had taken about $40,000 out of his account through writing those checks. Miriam told Quiñones that Alan knew that she was writing those checks. She said that they owned a dance studio and a horse farm together and Miriam was responsible for payroll and other business expenses. In December 2009, a jury found Miriam Helmick guilty of first-degree murder in the death of Alan Helmick. She was also convicted of attempted first-degree murder for the car fire and multiple forgery counts. She was sentenced to life in prison plus 78 years. Tuttle told Quiñones he thinks the jury got it right. I think there's no way that Miriam Helmick should ever be free in society again. So, life in prison without the possibility of parole, it's the only sentence that serves justice, Tuttle said. From prison, Miriam said she is determined to clear her name and will not stop until she is successful. I know that I didn't kill him, Helmick said. I don't care about anybody else's opinion. What I want more than anything is to prove that. Miriam Helmick has filed numerous appeals with the courts. They have all been rejected. When it comes to Alans family and friends, there are some things that they would rather forget, they told \"20/20.\" I try not to think about the murder. I more like to think about the fun times that we had with Alan. Those are good memories, Ed Benson said of his friend. Alans friends prefer to remember him as someone who was a lot of fun. \"He was the kind of guy you could meet and have a drink with and have a good laugh, Alans friend, Bob Cucchetti, said.",

        "title": "FDA approves painkiller designed to eliminate the risk of addiction",
        "source": "https://6abc.com/",
        "content": "WASHINGTON --Federal officials on Thursday approved a new type of pain pill designed to eliminate the risks of addiction and overdose associated with opioid medications like Vicodin and OxyContin. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration said it approved Vertex Pharmaceuticals' Journavx for short-term pain that often follows surgery or injuries. It's the first new pharmaceutical approach to treating pain in more than 20 years, offering an alternative to both opioids and over-the-counter medications like ibuprofen and acetaminophen. But the medication's modest effectiveness and lengthy development process underscore the challenges of finding new ways to manage pain. Studies in more than 870 patients with acute pain due to foot and abdominal surgeries showed Vertex's drug provided more relief than a dummy pill but didn't outperform a common opioid-acetaminophen combination pill. \"It's not a slam dunk on effectiveness,\" said Michael Schuh of the Mayo Clinic, a pharmacist and pain medicine expert who was not involved in the research. \"But it is a slam dunk in that it's a very different pathway and mechanism of action. So, I think that shows a lot promise.\" The new drug will carry a list price of $15.50 per pill, making it many times more expensive than comparable opioids, which are often available as generics for $1 or less. Vertex began researching the drug in the 2000s, when overdoses were rocketing upward, principally driven by mass prescribing of opioid painkillers for common ailments like arthritis and back pain. Prescriptions have fallen sharply in the last decade and the current wave of the opioid epidemic is mainly due to illicit fentanyl, not pharmaceutical medicines. Opioids reduce pain by binding to receptors in the brain that receive nerve signals from different parts of the body. Those chemical interactions also give rise to opioids' addictive effects. Vertex's drug works differently, blocking proteins that trigger pain signals that are later sent to the brain. \"In trying to develop medicines that don't have the addictive risks of opioid medicines, a key factor is working to block pain signaling before it gets to the brain,\" Vertex's Dr. David Altshuler, told The Associated Press last year. Commonly reported side effects with the drug were nausea, constipation, itching, rash and headache. \"The new medication has side effect profiles that are inherently, not only different, but don't involve the risk of substance abuse and other key side effects associated with opioids,\" said Dr. Charles Argoff of the Albany Medical Center, who consulted for Vertex on the drug's development. The initial concept to focus on pain-signaling proteins came out of research involving people with a rare hereditary condition that causes insensitivity to pain. Vertex has attracted interest from Wall Street for its ambitious drug pipeline that involves winning FDA approval for multiple drugs across several forms of chronic pain, which generally represents a bigger financial opportunity than acute pain. But the Boston drugmaker's share price plummeted in December when Vertex reported disappointing mid-stage results in a study of patients with chronic nerve pain affecting the lower back and legs. The drug didn't perform significantly better than placebo, the research found. \"We believe the data reflect a near worst-case scenario for this key pipeline program,\" biotechnology analyst Brian Abrahams said in a research note to investors, adding that the results jeopardized estimates that Vertex's pipeline could be worth billions across multiple forms of pain. Still, Vertex executives said they plan to move forward with a new, late-stage study of the drug, theorizing that a different trial design could yield better results and pave the way for FDA approval in chronic pain.",

WASHINGTON --Recovery efforts were ongoing Friday morning following the nation's first major commercial airline crash since 2009. Crews are now awaiting heavy machinery, including cranes, from the Army Corps of Engineers, Coast Guard and private contractors before they can extract additional collision victims, sources familiar with the operation told ABC News. The hope is the equipment will be in position to begin raising pieces of the fuselage as soon as Friday but the operation is expected to last at least through the weekend. Dive teams ceased operations on the Potomac on Thursday after recovering all of the bodies they were able to without moving the fuselage, according to two sources familiar with the operations. On Wednesday night, a regional American Airlines passenger jet and a Black Hawk military helicopter collided over Washington, D.C. The flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorder -- known as black boxes -- from the American Airlines plane have been recovered and are at a National Transportation Safety Board lab. DC PLANE CRASH:A timeline of the deadly collision 41 bodies have been recovered and 28 of those victims have been positively identified, Washington, D.C., Fire and EMS Chief John Donnelly Sr. said at a news conference Friday. Next of kin notifications had been made to 18 families as of 6 a.m. Friday, he said. All 67 people on board the plane and the helicopter were killed in the Wednesday night crash. Donnelly said crews expect to recover all of the bodies. It appears crews will need to remove the plane fuselage from the river to recover the remaining victims, he said. Salvage work on removing aircraft from the water will start as early as Saturday, he said. Fire and EMS has received 911 calls from people who spotted debris in the water; body parts have not been recovered from those 911 calls, he added. Additional bodies and human remains will need to be extracted from the wreckage once it is lifted to the surface of the river. Crews are bracing for the possibility some of the victims will not be recovered because of the fireball that resulted from the collision, the sources said. The Federal Aviation Administration is not giving permission for low-altitude helicopter routes around Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport, the FAA told ABC News. It's unclear how long this will last. Helicopters can still fly into and out of the airport, but are restricted from flying specific river routes. PresidentDonald Trumpsaid there were no survivors from the crash in remarks Thursday morning, calling the crash a \"tragedy of terrible proportions.\" \"Our hearts are shattered,\" Trump said in a press briefing at the White House, after holding a moment of silence. \"Our prayers are with you now and in the days to come.\" \"We are all searching for answers,\" Trump said, adding, \"We do not know what led to this crash\" but have \"some pretty good ideas.\" The NTSB has said their preliminary report into what caused the crash will take approximately 30 days and that it will take \"a year or more\" to get a final probable cause. Todd Inman, a member of the National Transportation Safety Board, appeared on \"Good Morning America\" on Friday, saying that the NTSB \"will be on scene here doing all the recovery of the perishable evidence we need for as long as it takes.\" \"The preliminary report, we believe, will be out in 30 days but in case of these major investigations, it will take a year, if not more, for us to come to a final probable cause,\" Inman continued. \"The most important thing is, the work doesn't just end then. We make recommendations so that we don't have tragedies like this again in the future.\" Inman said the NTSB has started the process of extracting data from the voice recorder. \"The data recorder itself has thousands of data points and they all have to be synchronized against a lot of other things that happened in the plane,\" Inman said. \"The voice recorders have to be what is called 'auditioned' among a number of people so that there's complete agreement of how the transcript will come out. We also look for ancillary noises. Maybe a boom or thud or crack or something in the cockpit. Those things are going on concurrently, along with the fact we have several hundred people in the field looking at every other aspect of this investigation.\" Inman also said that it is way too early to make any conclusions about what exactly caused the crash. \"The only conclusion I know is last night we met with several hundred family members who lost their loved ones in the Potomac,\" he said. \"We don't need that to happen anymore. We're going to work. We're going to continue. We're going find out what happened and we're going try to stop it from happening again.\" DC PLANE CRASH VICTIMS:What we know about those on AA Flight 5342, Army Black Hawk American Airlines CEO Robert Isom remains in Washington, D.C., on Thursday to support the families and help authorities. \"Out of respect for the families, we are not sharing the names of the two pilots and two flight attendants at this time, but our thoughts and prayers go out to their loved ones,\" Isom said. The Black Hawk helicopter, which had three soldiers on board, carries a black box with a voice and flight data recorder. Authorities were still looking for the helicopter's black box recorder, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said Friday on Fox News Channel. Other factors in the crash, including the helicopter's altitude and whether the crew was using its night vision goggles, are still under investigation, Hegseth said. \"It was a fairly experienced crew that was doing a required annual night evaluation,\" Hegseth said Thursday. \"They did have night vision goggles.\" Jimmie Cummings, a spokesman for the Army's Combat Readiness Center at Fort Novosel, Alabama, said that just like all soldiers who must meet regular qualifications for their weapons, Army aviators have to meet annual qualifications, regardless of their flight experience. For aviators, that means flying under different conditions, which could mean flying in daytime or nighttime. It was based at Fort Belvoir, Virginia, according to an Army official. \"We are working with local officials and will provide additional information once it becomes available,\" the official said. On Wednesday at Reagan Airport, a supervisor made the decision to combine two controller positions into one position. This decision was made 40 minutes earlier than normal because the supervisor determined that the traffic was low enough to combine, according to a source with direct knowledge. This position handles local arrivals into Reagan and helicopter traffic when it's combined. This happens routinely when aircraft volume goes down. Reagan is not understaffed, the source added. The air traffic controllers' union said in a statement that it's working with all federal agencies and \"stands with the highly trained, highly skilled\" workforce that \"keeps the United States as the gold standard for aviation safety.\"",

        "content": "Atco, NJ --Gregory Sharp is metal. The facility manager at Wade's Salvage Inc. knows everything about it. The price, the weight, the value. He's seen a lot of metal coming through his scrap metal operation over the years. The Atco, New Jersey salvage operation has been in his family since World War II, operating mainly during the week as a scrap metal operation recycling center. In the 80s, his grandparents built up a wide collection of military surplus aircraft and parts. Piles and piles of metal, scrap, vintage cars, schools buses, and old military aircraft are precariously strewn about the yard making for a unique and foreboding backdrop. So much kept piling up, that when a production crew for Eddie and Cruiser's accidentally drove by the yard they immediately fell in love with the setting. They filmed most of the movie's climax there and cemented Wade's as a Hollywood destination for an awesome ready-made movie set. \"They got permission from my grandparents at the time to film here. They came back, built the set and were filming for a whole week. In the film, they're here for 10 minutes,\" Sharp remembers. The family kept their connections with the movie studios and since then they've played host to a variety of filming locations looking for the perfect post-apocalyptic setting. And they've provided movies with plenty of props and items too. \"We have a good relationship with set decorators. They're looking for this or that for their show, I'll look for it and we'll send it out.\" They've had many productions come out to shoot at the yard over the years such as Eddie and the Cruisers in 1983, Amazon's Fallout series released in 2024, and Apple Studio's Wolfs starring Brad Pitt and George Clooney coming out in 2024. And they've offered props to productions like Blacklist (2019-2023), The Walking Dead-Dead City (2023), Severance (2023, 2024) and Only Murders in the Building (2024). \"I watch TV with my wife, I can point out my props when I see them on the screen. I'll say that's mine, that's mine, that's ours! She hates watching TV with me,\" Sharp laughs. Sharp says they host photo shoots there too. Plenty of cosplayers and folks looking to spark their imagination with an unforgettable background love taking pictures amidst the towering piles of trash and metal relics.

        "source": "https://6abc.com/",
        "content": "The repealed regulation keeping teens from buying guns originated in 1968. A federal appeals court on Thursday struck down a longstanding federal ban that prevented the sale of handguns to Americans between the ages of 18 and 20 - a landmark gun control regulation in place since 1968. The conservative Fifth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals ruled that the federal law banning handgun sales to teens is inconsistent with the nation's historical tradition and violates the Second Amendment. The decision cited the Supreme Court's 2022 opinion by Clarence Thomas in New York State Rifle and Pistol Association v. Bruen, which significantly expanded gun rights and threatens to rollback other gun safety laws nationwide. \"Ultimately, the text of the Second Amendment includes eighteen-to-twenty-year-old individuals among 'the people' whose right to keep and bear arms is protected,\" the court wrote in its opinion statement. The statement went on, \"The federal government has presented scant evidence that eighteen-to-twenty-year-olds firearm rights during the founding-era were restricted in a similar manner to the contemporary federal handgun purchase ban, and its 19th century evidence 'cannot provide much insight into the meaning of the Second Amendment when it contradicts earlier evidence.'\" The immediate nationwide impact of the ruling is unclear. The case is almost certainly bound for the Supreme Court. Handguns have been the most commonly used weapons in murders and mass shootings for decades in the United States, according to government data analyzed by The Violence Project. Last term, the Supreme Court upheld a longstanding federal law prohibiting the possession of firearms by people under domestic violence restraining orders. In the next few weeks, it will consider whether gun manufacturers can be held liable for violent crimes perpetrated by criminals who easily get the weapons.",

They laid down an irregular flagstone patio, framed with boulders and topped with colorful planters and a toasty propane fire pit. Justin Bates founded Bates Landscaping in 2011.  He and his siblings had grown up working in theirfather'slandscape business.  Though Justin loved it, he he went to work in the restaurant industry as an adult, but soon found hemissedworking outdoors.  So he cashed out his retirement savings, bought some tools and hired some workers. He started out of his mother's garage in Lansdowne, mowing lawns for 8-10 customers. As business grew, his brother, Dylan, came on board, and so did Melissa Blake. She is his lead designer, business development officer and wife.  The two met working in that restaurant but she had a background in landscaping, with a degree from Penn State University and experience working at a tree care company. Justin's sister, Cailee works for the business too and so does Melissa's sister. Their projects range from simple front yard renovations to give added curb appeal to total backyard transformations with water features and maybe a barrel sauna.

Sponsored Story by the Philly Home + Garden Show. Don Shump is the man behind the sweet stuff atPhiladelphia Bee Company. He produces all products from the hive, from an assortment of honeys to beeswax candles, including his most unusual offering from a hive that smelled like maple bacon.  Lab tests at Penn State University determined the honey was being made with the help of the spotted lantern flies which had attacked the trees giving the bees access to the sap.  He tested the honey out at a cheese and honey pairing at the Free Library and says it was the hit of the night. Don manages about 150 hives in neighborhoods around the city with the zip code on top of his jar indicating the bee's foraging grounds.  Some of Don's honey also goes into the sweet honey bonbons atShane Confectionary in Old City(which has a lot of other sweet treats for Valentines Day.)

        "content": "PHILADELPHIA (WPVI) --Some passengers of the American Airlines regional jet that collided with a military helicopter and crashed in Washington, D.C., have connections to the Philadelphia region. Flight 5342 and the U.S. Army Black Hawk helicoptercollided just before 9 p.m. Wednesday. Wreckage from the crash fell into the Potomac River where recovery operations continue. There were 60 passengers and four crew members on board the plane and three soldiers on the helicopter. No survivors are expected. Here's what we know about the connections to the Philadelphia region so far: The wife of skating coach Alexandr \"Sasha\" Kirsanov, 46, confirmed to ABC News her husband was on the plane. Natalya Gudin said Kirsanov was with two youth ice skaters on board the flight. \"I lost everything. I lost my husband. I lost my students. I lost my friends,\" Gudin said. Gudin, who also coaches students with her husband in Delaware, said she stayed home to be with their other skaters. \"We are husband and wife,\" Gudin said. \"We decided who's going, who's staying home,\" she said. \"We decided he would go to the development camp.\" Two young skaters, Sean Kay and Angela Yang, who had ties to the University of Delaware Figure Skating Club, were also among those killed, according to U.S. Senator Chris Coons. \"I'm devastated to hear the news that at least three Delawareans died during last night's air collision. Sasha Kirsanov, Sean Kay, and Angela Yang went to Wichita to pursue their passion for figure skating,\" Coons said in a statement. Last week, thethe club postedabout Kay and Yang before their trip to Wichita. \"It is a tragedy that none of them returned home to our state. Delaware is a state of neighbors, and tonight we hold all of our neighbors a little closer. My heart goes out to Sasha's wife Natalia, the University of Delaware Figure Skating Club, and every other Delawarean touched by the three of them,\" added Coons. RELATED:'Hearts are heavy': 14 figure skaters among victims of DC plane crash Gudin last spoke with her husband as he boarded the flight on Wednesday, she said. \"I need my husband back,\" Gudin said as she waited at a hotel for further information from authorities. \"I need his body back.\" University of Delaware President Dr. Dennis Assanis released a statement on the tragedy saying, \"The figure skating community is tight-knit, and many of our students and coaches have trained and competed alongside those who were lost.\" \"Our hearts go out to the families and friends of all of the victims of this horrific tragedy,\" he added. The Philadelphia Skating Clubposted a statement on social mediaThursday saying the victims include \"beloved members\" of the club. \"Everyone is trying to rally around each other, especially for those who were really close to the ones that were lost,\" said Regina Barr, the director and skating coach of the club, which is located in Ardmore. She said one of their newest members, who joined the club just a few weeks ago, was among those killed. Action News has confirmed that the skater was Alydia Livingston who had recently partnered with a local skater in our area. \"He's been a long-time skater here and we were very proud of the new ice dance team,\" Barr said. In a prepared statement, the Ice Works Skating Club in Aston, Pa. said some of the victims on the plane skated at the club. \"Even though many of these skaters were not club members at our rink, they all spent time training here and competing in our events,\" said Lisa Shaw, the skating director at IceWorks.",

        "content": "Troopers surrounded Brian and Elizabeth DiBiasi's home in Hamilton Township before they were arrested on Wednesday. HAMILTON TWP., N.J. (WPVI) --Two New Jersey parents who work in law enforcement are facing charges in connection with an alleged sex crime case against children. Troopers surrounded Brian and Elizabeth DiBiasi's home in Hamilton Township, Mercer County before they were arrested on Wednesday. Attorney General Matthew Platkin said the husband and wife are charged in connection with creating, producing and distributing images of child sexual abuse. Records show Brian, 39, has worked with the Hamilton Township Police Department for 21 years and Elizabeth, 42, has been employed by the Mercer County Sheriff's Office for 18 years. On Tuesday, Platkin said investigators received a tip that Brian allegedly distributed multiple files online showing nude images of his wife in the presence of children. He's also accused of mentioning children being present while he and his wife had sex. \"Sexual offenses against children are among the most serious crimes we charge,\" said Platkin. \"It's especially disturbing when, as in this case, the accused are members of law enforcement.\" Some residents told us they were concerned because there are many children in the neighborhood. \"People look like normal people and sometimes they're monsters underneath and that's scary,\" said Hart. Mayor Jeff Martin and Chief of Police Ken DeBoskey said in a joint statement, \"Hamilton Township has zero tolerance for crimes of this nature. We remain fully committed to upholding the highest standards of integrity and accountability within our community and our police department.\" Mercer County Sheriff Jack Kemler said, \"As the Mercer County Sheriff and a community leader, know that I have zero tolerance for (alleged) immoral acts in our community and within our ranks. Like many employers, we cannot control how people behave outside of the workplace and at home.\" Both suspects are being held in Monmouth County Jail. The sheriff's office said Elizabeth DiBias is suspended without pay as police continue to investigate. The Hamilton Police Division said Brian DiBias is being suspended without pay and served with a notice of termination. Platkin said Brian is charged with causing or permitting a child to engage in a sexual act that may be photographed, filmed or reproduced (1st degree), engaging in sexual conduct that would debauch the morals of a child (2nd degree); possessing fewer than 1,000 images of child sexual abuse (3rd degree); distributing images of child sexual abuse (2nd degree); and possessing images of child sexual abuse with the intent to distribute (2nd degree). Elizabeth is charged with engaging in sexual conduct that would debauch the morals of a child (2nd degree).",

PHILADELPHIA-A national tragedy is hitting close to home for a local ice skating club as they mourn the devastating loss of fellow athletes, along with their own members, who were all on their way home from doing what they loved when the unthinkable happened. What we know: All 67 people aboard the American Airlines jet and Army helicopter are feared dead in what is likely the worst U.S. aviation disaster in almost 24 years, officials said Thursday. In a statement to FOX 29, the Philadelphia Ice Skating Club and Humane Society said that \"beloved\" members were among those killed when anAmerican Airlines plane collided with an Army helicopternear Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport Wednesday night: \"The Philadelphia Skating Club and Humane Society is devastated to learn of the crash in Washington D.C. that took the lives of several members of the figure skating community, including beloved members of our club. We feel immense grief at the loss of so many talented skaters, their coaches and families. Sadly, one of the families lost just became members of our club and another shared his talent with us at our recent 175th Anniversary Gala. We share this loss and grief with the entire USFS Community. Our thoughts and prayers are with everyone during this tragic time.\" Meanwhile, three other individuals in the Delaware figure skating community were named as victims of the doomed flight. Delaware Senator Chris Coons stated a former coach at the University of Delaware Figure Skating Club, Alexandr \"Sasha\" Kirsanov, a fixture at the High Performance Training Center on the university's campus was traveling with two young skaters, ice dance partners Angela Yang and Sean Kay. The local figure skating community is mourning the loss of a number of members of the US Figure Skating with local connections, including three from Delaware.

The club says they will not be releasing any additional information at this time as we await updates from US Figure Skating.

In Aston, Delaware County, Lisa Shaw has 25 years of history at IceWorks. She's currently the Skating Director and President of the club. She read a brief statement to FOX 29, but would not comment further. \"The figure skating community is a small, tight-knit group, and even though many of these skaters were not club members at our rink, they all spent time training here and competing in our events,\" she said.

PHILADELPHIA-While admitting Philadelphia public schools have a long way to go, Superintendent Tony Watlington sees important improvements in student performance. He answered questions from FOX 29 in advance of his celebratory State of the Schools address. What they're saying: \"We are really excited. We think when all the data is verified across the country, we’ll be declared one of the fastest improving, large school districts in the country,\" said Watlington. That has been Tony Watlington’s goal since the day he took control of Philadelphia schools. In a State of the Schools message, Watlington said, \"more students are coming to school and staying. Reading and math scores are up in grades 3rd through 8th. And the dropout rate is down by 14 hundred.\" Watlington reports, \"the School District of Philadelphia, the nation’s 8th largest, has increased enrollment by 1,841 students. That says to me parents and the community have greater confidence in the school district.\" The superintendent believes challenges remain, including no improvements in algebra, a coming plan to close schools and grinding poverty. In his third year of a five-year contract, he said, \"I believe poverty provides a level of significant challenge. As a child of poverty myself, I know firsthand the power of a highly qualified, well-supported, stable teacher.\" The district’s four and a half billion-dollar budget will see an infusion of more than two hundred thirty million in new state money, the result of a successful lawsuit claiming unequal state funding and more city dollars as well. Watlington said with the increased funding he plans to, \"double down on what’s working. High impact, high dosage tutoring, doubling down on professional development supporting teachers.\" The superintendent has a challenging teachers’ union contract to help negotiate in the fall and plans to stay put. \"I intend to be here as long as the mayor and board will have me. I’m absolutely committed to Philadelphia, yes,\" said Watlington. The Source:The information in this story is from The School District of Philadelphia Superintendent Tony Watlington.

WASHINGTON-Afederal judge temporarily blockedPresident Donald Trump's attempt to pause funding for federal grants and loans while his administration conducts a review aimed at eliminating progressive initiatives. But are food stamps (SNAP), Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid safe? Here’s the latest on the funding freeze: The administrative stay, prompted by a lawsuit brought by nonprofit groups, lasts until Monday and applies only to existing programs. FILE - \"SNAP/EBT Food Stamp Benefits Accepted\" is displayed on a screen inside a Family Dollar Stores Inc. store in Chicago, Illinois, U.S., on March 3, 2020.

These include: Food Stamps (SNAP)Student LoansSocial SecurityMedicareMedicaidFunds for Small BusinessesFarmersPell GrantsHead StartRental Assistance A White House directive to pause federal grants and loans raised uncertainty and fears among many who depend on federal aid before a judge intervened Tuesday to temporarily block it from taking effect. Officials said new administrations must review federal programs \" to ensure that they are being executed in accordance with the law and the new President’s policies.\" Dig deeper: Here's more In implementing President Trump’s Executive Orders,OMB issued guidancerequesting that agencies temporarily pause, to the extent permitted by law, grant, loan or federal financial assistance programs that are implicated by the President’s Executive Orders. Any program not implicated by the President’s Executive Orders is not subject to the pause. The Executive Orders listed in the guidance are: Protecting the American People Against Invasion Reevaluating and Realigning United States Foreign Aid Putting America First in International Environmental Agreements Unleashing American Energy Ending Radical and Wasteful Government DEI Programs and Preferencing Defending Women from Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government Enforcing the Hyde Amendment Any program that provides direct benefits to individuals is not subject to the pause. The guidance establishes a process for agencies to work with OMB to determine quickly whether any program is inconsistent with the President’s Executive Orders. A pause could be as short as day. In fact, OMB has worked with agencies and has already approved many programs to continue even before the pause has gone into effect. Any payment required by law to be paid will be paid without interruption or delay. Q: Is this a freeze on all Federal financial assistance? A: No, the pause does not apply across-the-board. It is expressly limited to programs, projects, and activities implicated by the President’s Executive Orders, such as ending DEI, the green new deal, and funding nongovernmental organizations that undermine the national interest. Q: Is this a freeze on benefits to Americans like SNAP or student loans? A: No, any program that provides direct benefits to Americans is explicitly excluded from the pause and exempted from this review process. In addition to Social Security and Medicare, already explicitly excluded in the guidance, mandatory programs like Medicaid and SNAP will continue without pause. Funds for small businesses, farmers, Pell grants, Head Start, rental assistance, and other similar programs will not be paused. If agencies are concerned that these programs may implicate the President’s Executive Orders, they should consult OMB to begin to unwind these objectionable policies without a pause in the payments. Q: Is the pause of federal financial assistance an impoundment? A: No, it is not an impoundment under the Impoundment Control Act. It is a temporary pause to give agencies time to ensure that financial assistance conforms to the policies set out in the President’s Executive Orders, to the extent permitted by law. Temporary pauses are a necessary part of program implementation that have been ordered by past presidents to ensure that programs are being executed and funds spent in accordance with a new President’s policies and do not constitute impoundments. Q: Why was this pause necessary? A: To act as faithful stewards of taxpayer money, new administrations must review federal programs to ensure that they are being executed in accordance with the law and the new President’s policies.

        "content": "Share FILE - ABC Sports commentator Dick Button at the 1988 Winter Olympics / XV Olympic Winter Games. LOS ANGELES-Dick Button, a two-time Olympic gold medalist and one of the most influential figures in figure skating history, has died at the age of 95. His son, Edward Button, confirmed his passing on Thursday but did not provide a cause. Button’s impact on the sport spanned decades, from his groundbreaking performances in the 1940s and 1950s to his later role as a commentator who helped shape figure skating’s popularity worldwide. The backstory: Button won back-to-back Olympic gold medals in 1948 and 1952, making history as the first U.S. figure skater to reach the top of the podium. He was a dominant force in men’s figure skating, capturing five consecutive world championships and revolutionizing the sport with technical innovations. He was the first skater to land a double axel in competition and the first to perform a triple jump—the triple loop—setting a new standard for athleticism on the ice. Following his competitive career, Button transitioned to broadcasting, where he became the most recognized and respected voice in figure skating commentary. His detailed analysis, knowledge of the sport, and signature style helped bring figure skating to a broader audience. Button’s legacy extends beyond competition and broadcasting—he was instrumental in shaping the modern landscape of figure skating. Fellow Olympic champion Scott Hamilton called him \"one of the most important figures in our sport.\" The Source:This report is based on an Associated Press article and confirmations from The New York Times and The Washington Post, citing Button’s son and daughter.

        "content": "Share Former NJ Sen. Bob Menendez has been sentenced to 11 years in prison after being convicted of abusing a Senate committee leadership position. FOX 5 NY’s Morgan McKay has the latest. NEW YORK-Former New Jersey SenatorBob Menendezhas been sentenced to 11 years in prison after being convicted last year of 16 counts of bribery, extortion, conspiracy and obstruction of justice charges. The sentence caps a remarkable downfall for Menendez, who was convicted last July of enriching himself through a variety of corrupt acts. Prosecutors said that in exchange for the gold, thousands of dollars in cash and a luxury car, the Democrat tried to protect associates from criminal investigations, met with Egyptian intelligence officials and took steps to help that country access to millions of dollars in U.S. military aid. Earlier Wednesday, Judge Sidney H. Stein also sentenced two New Jersey businessmen convicted of paying bribes. Menendez, 71, has promised to appeal. This is a breaking news update. Stay with FOX 5 NY as this story develops. Prosecutors had said thatMenendezshould have been imprisoned for 15 years, calling it an \"extraordinary attempt, at the highest levels of the Legislative Branch, to corrupt the nation’s core sovereign powers over foreign relations.\" Lawyers for the former Senator are urging the judge to be lenient, saying the ordeal has made him a \"national punchline\" despite a lifetime of good deeds that have saved lives. The backstory: Menendez wasconvicted in Julyon corruption charges after an FBI raid in 2022 uncovered $150,000 in gold bars and $480,000 in cash at his home. Prosecutors say the money came from bribes by three New Jersey businessmen seeking his influence to protect their interests and profit. A defense lawyer for Sen. Bob Menendez has tried to convince a New York jury that there's nothing to the federal government's bribery case against the Democrat. When he was charged in fall 2023, Menendez was chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. He was forced out of that position in 2023 and gave up his Senate seat in August. In arguments last week, defense lawyers called for Judge Sidney H. Stein to be lenient with Menendez, saying his conviction had \"rendered him a national punchline and stripped him of every conceivable personal, professional, and financial benefit.\" \"Bob is deserving of mercy because of the penalties already imposed, his age, and the lack of a compelling need to impose a custodial sentence,\" the lawyers said. Dig deeper: Two businessmen, Wael Hana and Fred Daibes, were convicted alongside Menendez, while a third pleaded guilty and testified at the trial in July. Prosecutors are seeking a prison sentence of at least 10 years for Hana and nine years for Daibes, saying the crimes took place between 2018 and 2022. \"The defendants’ crimes amount to an extraordinary attempt, at the highest levels of the Legislative Branch, to corrupt the nation’s core sovereign powers over foreign relations and law enforcement,\" prosecutors wrote.

        "content": "Authorities say that a person of interest in the deaths of a man and woman in Pennsylvania purchased a gun that was later used in a shooting that claimed the life of a border patrol agent. PHILADELPHIA-The case of a Delaware County couple killed in their home in late 2022 is now linked to the line-of-duty shooting death of a border patrol agent in Vermont, officials said. Pennsylvania State Police made the announcement Wednesday. What we know: Officials with Pennsylvania State Police said a United States Customs and Border Patrol Agent was killed in-the-line-duty on January 20th, 2025, in Vermont, near a Canadian border crossing in Coventry, about 20 miles from the border. The agent was attempting to conduct a vehicle stop with 21-year-old Washington state resident Teresa Youngblut and German citizen Felix Bauckholt in the car when the gunfire was exchanged. The two had been under surveillance several days. Bauckholt was killed in the gunfire, along with 44-year-old Border Patrol Agent David Maland. Related A United States Border Patrol agent was shot and killed in Vermont on Monday, according to The Department of Homeland Security. Youngblut is in custody facing weapons charges. The investigation of the murdered agent revealed the gun used was purchased by a person of interest in the double homicide of Rita and Richard Zajko. Authorities have since identified that person of interest as 32-year-old Michelle J. Zajko. Zajko allegedly bought two handguns in February 2024 that were used in the shooting that killedU.S. Border Patrol AgentDavid \"Chris\" Maland. The backstory: Pennsylvania State Police were called to a house on Highland Drive, in Chester Heights, on January 2, 2023, for a welfare check. When they arrived, they found 72-year-old Richard Zajko and his 69-year-old wife, Rita, dead, inside the home. During the investigation, it was determined the couple was killed in the home on December 31, 2022. The case has remained active with the PSP Media, Criminal Investigation Unit ever since. Related Weeks after the couple was found dead, Pennsylvania State Police troopers announced their beliefs that the double homicide was not a random act of violence. Dig deeper: In a motion filed Monday, U.S. Attorney Michael Drescher said Youngblut should be detained as the case proceeds due to the nature of the crime, the weight of evidence against her, her lack of ties to Vermont, and the danger she poses to the community. According to the motion, the gun used by Youngblut and one that Bauckholt was carrying were purchased by a third person in Vermont last February. The buyer is a person of interest in the double homicide of the Zajkos. And both Youngblut and the buyer \"are acquainted with and have been in frequent contact with\" someone who was detained during that investigation and who also is a person of interest in a homicide investigation in Vallejo, California, the motion said. What's next: The Pennsylvania State Police is requesting anyone with information regarding the investigations to contact PSP Tips at 1-800-4PA-TIPS (8477) oronline at their tip website, here. Individuals can also contact their local Pennsylvania State Police station, Criminal Investigation Unit.

        "content": "ARLINGTON, Va.-A midair collision between an Army helicopter and a passenger jet killed all 67 people aboard the two aircraft, officials said, as they search for answers in the nation's deadliest aviation disaster in nearly 25 years. At least 41 bodies have been recovered from the icy waters of the Potomac River after the helicopter reportedly crossed into the path of an American Airlines jet late Wednesday. The incident occurred as the jet was landing at Ronald Reagan National Airport, located just outside Washington, D.C. Federal investigators have cautioned that determining the cause of the crash could take months, and they refrained from speculating during a press briefing. Here is what we know about the collision: 2:30pm: Fire Chief John Donnelly and VP of Reagan National Airport Terry Liercke give an update on the DCA plane crash. D.C. Fire and EMS alongside the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority provided an update on the recovery efforts and progress two days after the deadly plane crash. Officials reported \"41 sets of remains have been recovered, and 28 victims have been positively identified.\" The recovery process continues. Officials mentioned the removal of the aircraft assisting in the recovery process and investigation. 12pm: Wednesday’s crash was similar to a deadly collision in 1949, when D.C.’s airspace was less crowded. A passenger plane on final approach to then Washington National Airport collided with a military plane, plunging both aircraft into the Potomac River, killing 55 people. At the time, it was the deadliest air crash in the U.S. 11:30am: Aviation experts have long worried that the airspace surrounding Washington, D.C. could lead to catastrophe. \"This was a disaster waiting to happen,\" said Ross Aimer, a retired United Airlines captain and chief executive officer of Aero Consulting Experts told the Associated Press. \"Those of us who have been around a long time have been yelling into a vacuum that something like this would happen because our systems are stretched to extremes.\" Officials said flight conditions were clear as the jet arrived from Wichita, Kansas. A Federal Aviation Administration report obtained by The Associated Press described staffing levels as \"not normal for the time of day and volume of traffic.\" 11:15am: Timothy Lilley, a former military helicopter pilot, confirmed that his28-year-old son, Sam Lilley, was one of the two pilots aboard the American Airlines flight. \"This is undoubtedly the worst day of my life,\" Timothy told FOX 5 Atlanta from Washington, D.C. Timothy, who was in New York for work, initially couldn't believe it was his son's flight. \"Last night when I saw on Fox News there was a crash in DC, I really didn't think there was any way that was my son,\" he said. However, after failing to hear from Sam, who always checked in, his worst fears were confirmed. The father and son shared a passion for flying, with Sam having started his flight training in 2019 and working with PSA Airlines, part of the American Airlines group, for two years. Sam was also engaged to be married. Sam Lilley 11:15am: Police boats were in the Potomac River on Friday as part of the recovery and investigation after a deadly midair collision killed 67 people Wednesday night. More than 40 bodies have been pulled from the river as the massive recovery effort continues. Crews worked in the rain Friday morning with wet conditions expected throughout the day. Planes continued to take off and land at Ronald Reagan National Airport next, with operations at the airfield gradually returning to normal after canceled and delayed flights following the crash. According to Reuters the FAA is restricting helicopter flights near DCA imposing significant limitations on Route 1 and Route 4 around the airport. 11am: The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration has restricted helicopter flights near Ronald Reagan National Airport indefinitely, according to the Associated Press. The news organization says the FAA is prohibiting most helicopters from portions of two helicopter routes near the airport. The report says only police and medical helicopters in the section between the airport and nearby bridges will be allowed at this time.

Recovery operations resumed on Friday morning amid rainy conditions. The plane carried  60 passengers and four crew members, and three soldiers were aboard the helicopter. Air crash investigations can take months, and federal investigators told reporters Thursday they would not speculate on the cause. 8:15am: President Donald Trump took to his social media platform, Truth Social, on Friday to post that the Black Hawk helicopter that collided with the American Airlines passenger jet near Ronald Reagan National Airport resulting in the deaths of everyone onboard \"was flying too high, by a lot.\" \"It was far above the 200-foot limit. That’s not really too complicated to understand, is it???\" Trump’s post continued. According toFOX Business, NTSB member Todd Inman, when asked by the news organization about whether the helicopter’s altitude played a role in the crash, said \"Right now, we've not ruled anything in or out.\" \"But I would be very careful to anyone who's listening to this to rely upon off the shelf software, speculation they're seeing online. Our job is to get the absolute facts as we get these [black] boxes in and get them analyzed and we look at more granular data, will be able to give a much better picture on that,\" he said.

The skies were clear at the time. The Federal Aviation Administration reported that moments before American Airlines Flight 5342 was to land, air traffic controllers requested the jet to land on a shorter runway, to which the pilots agreed. Flight tracking sites indicated the plane adjusted its approach accordingly. Less than 30 seconds before the crash, an air traffic controller asked the helicopter if it had visual contact with the jet, and the military pilot confirmed. A subsequent radio call from the controller directed the helicopter to \"pass behind the CRJ,\" apparently advising it to wait for the Bombardier CRJ-701 twin-engine jet to pass. The helicopter did not respond, and the aircraft collided seconds later.

Federal investigators will now try to piece together the moments before the collision. The plane's radio transponder ceased transmitting approximately 2,400 feet short of the runway, near the middle of the Potomac River. Officials stated that the plane's body was discovered upside-down in three sections in waist-deep water. The helicopter's wreckage was also located in the river. National Transportation Safety Board investigators have recovered the cockpit voice recorder and flight data recorder from the plane, said agency spokesperson Peter Knudson. 5:30am: Among the passengers were members of the Skating Club of Boston, returning from a development camp that followed the 2025 U.S. Figure Skating Championships in Wichita. Club CEO Doug Zeghibe confirmed that 14 people from the skating community were on the plane, including teenage figure skaters Jinna Han and Spencer Lane, their mothers, and two Russian-born coaches, Evgenia Shishkova and Vadim Naumov, who won a world championship in pairs skating in 1994. The victims also included an Ohio college student returning from her grandfather's funeral and a group of hunters coming back from a guided trip in Kansas. Three students from Fairfax County, Virginia, and six parents from the district were also on board, according to Superintendent Michelle Reid. It was the deadliest U.S. air crash since 2001. At least 28 bodies have been pulled from the icy waters, including those of the three soldiers who were on the helicopter.

Jonathan Koziol, chief of staff for Army aviation, described the helicopter crew as \"very experienced\" and familiar with the congested flying conditions around Washington. While their identities have not been officially released, the wife of one of the helicopter pilots, Andrew Eaves of Noxubee County, Mississippi, announced on Facebook that her husband was among those killed.

        "title": "US tariffs on Canada and Mexico begin Saturday—what it means for gas prices",
        "source": "https://www.fox29.com/",
        "content": "President Donald Trump used an address Thursday to the World Economic Forum to promise lower taxes to global business leaders if they bring manufacturing to the United States. Trump also threatened to impose tariffs if they do not. LiveNOW's Austin Westfall breaks down Trump's message with Sandra Swirksi, founder and CEO of Interger. WASHINGTON-President Donald Trump announced that 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico will go into effect on Saturday, but he has not yet decided whether to include oil imports in the measure. Speaking from the Oval Office on Thursday, Trump said he would make the determination by the end of the night, basing his decision on whether he believes the two trading partners are charging the U.S. a \"fair\" price for oil. While the tariffs were framed as a response to illegal immigration and fentanyl-related concerns, extending them to oil could impact gas prices and inflation. The move comes despite Trump’s previous campaign promise to cut energy costs in half within a year of taking office. Trump’s threat to include oil in the new tariffs has raised concerns about rising gas prices, a key issue for voters. Canada and Mexico are major oil suppliers to the U.S., with Canada alone accounting for nearly 4.6 million barrels per day in October 2024, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. The potential tariffs could lead to increased costs for refineries that rely on Canadian and Mexican crude, possibly pushing gas prices higher. On Thursday, U.S. oil prices were trading at approximately $73 per barrel, well below the peak of over $120 per barrel in 2022, but industry experts warn that tariffs could drive prices up. What they're saying: Matthew Holmes, executive vice president at the Canadian Chamber of Commerce, criticized the move, warning that tariffs on Canadian oil would ultimately hurt American consumers. \"This is a lose-lose,\" Holmes told the Associated Press. \"We will keep working with partners to show President Trump and Americans that this doesn’t make life any more affordable. It makes life more expensive and sends our integrated businesses scrambling.\" Trump, however, dismissed concerns over price increases, insisting the U.S. does not rely on imports.

We have all the trees you need, meaning the lumber.\" By the numbers: Why you should care: The new tariffs, particularly if extended to oil, could have a direct impact on everyday consumers. Increased costs for imported crude oil could lead to higher gasoline prices, despite Trump’s campaign promise to cut energy prices in half. Additionally, the move could strain relations with Canada and Mexico, two of the U.S.’s closest trading partners, and spark retaliatory trade measures that could affect other sectors beyond energy.

        "title": "Kash Patel, Tulsi Gabbard and others conclude confirmation hearings today",
        "source": "https://www.fox29.com/",
        "content": "Share Three of President Donald Trump’s cabinet picks finished their confirmation hearings on Thursday. Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Tulsi Gabbard and Kash Patel were questioned by Democratic senators. Republicans as well as Democrats criticized President Donald Trump’s pick for national intelligence director, condemning Tulsi Gabbard for previous comments sympathetic to Russia, for meeting with Syria’s now-deposed leader and for supporting government leaker Edward Snowden, the Associated Press reported. Gabbard said years of failures by America’s intelligence services require big changes. She said false or politicized intelligence has led to wars, foreign policy failures and the misuse of espionage. \"The bottom line is this must end,\" she said. Gabbard has won praise in Russian state-controlled media by echoing Russian propaganda justifying the Kremlin’s invasion of Ukraine. Republicans accused her of spreading Russian disinformation. Kansas Republican Jerry Moran wanted to know: Would Russia \"get a pass\" from her? Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s long record of questioning the safety of childhood vaccinations could jeopardize his confirmation for health secretary. If all the Democrats rejected Kennedy’s nomination, he could only afford to lose three Republicans. According to the Associated Press, when Kennedy refused Thursday to freject a long-discredited theory that vaccines cause autism, despite years of studies and research that have found they do not, it clearly troubled Health Committee chairman Bill Cassidy. Cassidy is a Louisiana Republican and liver doctor who has regularly encouraged his constituents to vaccinate against COVID-19 and other diseases. \"If there’s any false note, any undermining of a mama’s trust in vaccines, another person will die from a vaccine preventable disease,\" Cassidy said. Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s hearing ended following a heated exchange with Sen. Bernie Sanders. Sanders questioned Kennedy on his views on vaccines. Kennedy fired back saying that members of Congress, including Sanders, were receiving money from pharmaceutical companies, according to the Associated Press. The line drew cheers and applause from Kennedy’s supporters in the room. Sanders responded that he doesn’t take money from organizations or groups that represent the drug-making industry. What they're saying: Kash Patel said \"I’m going to let the cops be cops and put handcuffs on the bad guys and put child molesters in prison and put murderers in prison,\" Patel told lawmakers when asked what his plans for the bureau are. The Associated Press reported that Patel wrote in a Wall Street Journal op-ed published this week that \"violent crime is destroying families across the nation.\" There has been little discussion of national security issues throughout the hearing, which focused on Patel’s past comments. That’s despite a heightened threat of international terrorism and an FBI investigation into a massive breach by Chinese hackers of American telecommunications companies. Democratic Sen. Adam Schiff called on Kash Patel to turn around and face the Capitol police officers in the hearing room. It came as Schiff was criticizing Patel for producing a song featuring President Trump and a choir of jailed Jan. 6 defendants to help raise money for the families of those charged in the Capitol riot. \"If you have the courage to, look them in the eye, Mr. Patel. And tell them you’re proud of what you did. Tell them you’re proud that you raised money off of people that assaulted their colleagues, that pepper sprayed them, that beat them with poles,\" Schiff said the AP reported. Patel fired back: \"That’s an abject lie, you know it. I never, never, ever accepted violence against law enforcement.\" Robert F. Kennedy Jr. had his second of two confirmation hearings for his Health and Human Services Secretary nomination. He will appear before the Health Committee a day after his hearing before the Finance Committee. The Associated Press reported that at Wednesday’s Senate Finance Committee, it was Republican Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, who challenged Kennedy the most. RELATED:Who is RFK Jr.'s wife? Cheryl Hines seen at Senate confirmation hearing Tulsi Gabbard, former US Representative from Hawaii and President Donald Trump's nominee to be director of National Intelligence, during a Senate Intelligence Committee confirmation hearing in Washington, DC, US, on Thursday, Jan. 30, 2025. (Daniel H When asking him to detail his plans for Medicare and Medicaid, Kennedy responded with few answers and misstated some basic facts about how the federally funded programs work and how many people they serve. Cassidy’s vote is crucial for Kennedy since he also serves on the finance committee that will decide whether the health secretary nominee makes it to the Senate floor. Tulsi Gabbard, President Donald Trump’s pick to be director of national intelligence, is expected to face questions from the Senate Intelligence Committee over past comments about Russia and a 2017 visit with Syria’s now-deposed leader, the Associated Press reported. RELATED:Kristi Noem faces Senate confirmation hearing Gabbard unsuccessfully sought the 2020 presidential nomination and left the party in 2022. Gabbard endorsed Trump in August and campaigned often with him. She served in the Army National Guard for more than two decades and was deployed to Iraq and Kuwait. Kash Patel was selected by Trump to lead the FBI and may face questions from Democratic senators Thursday about his loyalty to Trump and stated desire to overhaul the bureau. The backstory: Once President Donald Trump nominates his picks for various positions, they are then presented to the appropriate Senate committee. The committee would then vote to recommend a candidate to the full Senate. The full Senate will debate. Trump's picks will either be confirmed or rejected by a simple majority. If they are approved, they are then sworn in. Republicans currently hold 53 seats in the Senate, which could suggest many of Trump's picks will be confirmed without issue.

The Bombardier CRJ-701 twin-engine jet, manufactured in 2004, can carry up to 70 passengers. Minutes before landing, air traffic controllers asked the arriving jet if it could land on the shorter Runway 33. The pilots confirmed they could, and controllers cleared the plane to land. Flight tracking data showed the plane adjusting its approach to the new runway. Less than 30 seconds before the collision, an air traffic controller asked the helicopter if it had the jet in sight. Moments later, the controller radioed the helicopter again: \"PAT 25 pass behind the CRJ.\" Seconds later, the two aircraft collided. The plane's transponder stopped transmitting about 2,400 feet short of the runway, roughly over the middle of the river.

        "content": " TRENTON-A New Jersey couple who are both police officers are facing disturbing allegations of creating child sexual abuse material and distributing the explicit images online. Prosecutors did not name the man and woman, who they say work as law enforcement officers in different police departments within Mercer County. Investigators say the husband allegedly uploaded over 30 explicit images of his wife in the presence of children, and made other disturbing claims in an online chat. What we know: Investigators in Mercer County on Tuesday acted on a tip from the National Center of Missing and Exploited Children that claimed an mobile messaging platform user uploaded and distributed possible child sexual abuse material. The Mercer County Prosecutor's Office said the user allegedly distributed over 30 media files that contained naked images of his wife in the presence of children. In an online chat exchange, the husband allegedly mentioned that children were present while he and his wife had sex. The husband and wife are both law enforcement officers in different departments in Mercer County, according to prosecutors. The husband has been charged with several crimes, including first degree causing or permitting a child to engage in a sexual act that may be photographed, videoed, or reproduced. The wife was charged with second degree engaging in sexual conduct that would debauch the morals of a child. What they're saying: New Jersey Attorney General Matthew Platkin called the allegations \"disturbing\" in a press release shared Thursday night. \"Sexual offenses against children are among the most serious crimes we charged,\" Platkin said. \"It's especially disturbing when, as in this case, the accused are members of law enforcement.\" Department of Criminal Justice Director Theresa L. Hilton said the allegations could cause \"immeasurable harm to the victims.\" The Hamilton Police Department said one of the officers in the ongoing investigation worked for the department, but did not identify if it was the husband or wife. The department said the officer is being suspended and served with a notice of termination. \"The off-duty allegations made against this officer do not reflect the values of this agency or of the dedicated and hard-working men and women who put their lives on the line every day for the citizens of Hamilton Township to keep you safe,\" a statement read. What's next: Prosecutors say the first-degree charges can carry a sentence of 10 to 20 years in state prison, and a fine up to $200K. Second and third degree charges can result in 3-10 years in state prison and fines up to $150K.

PHILADELPHIA-A Montgomery County inmate is accused of recruiting a man to help him use Instagram to find someone to kill the mother of his child, prosecutors said Thursday. Zunir Wilson-Walker, 22, and Jadan Uriah Jones, 20, were both charged with multiple crimes in the alleged murder-for-hire plot that prison officials caught wind of. Investigators believe in November Walker-Wilson offered $15,000, a Cartier watch, and a car as payment for carrying out the murder of his child's mother. What we know: Investigators suspected the murder-for-hire plot after reviewing a phone conversation that Wilson-Walker alleged used another inmates phone account to make. Wilson-Walker asked Jones to make a fake Instagram account and create a story that offered $15,000, a Cartier watch, and a vehicle for \"beating up and killing the mother of his child.\" It's alleged that Wilson-Walker instructed Jones to use the Instagram story function to avoid attracting attention from police and others. Investigators said Walker-Wilson had lost his phone privileges for verbally abusing and threatening the mother of his child. He also had his prison-issued tablet revoked after investigators say he sent eight harassing and threatening messages to the same woman, which violated a Protection From Abuse Order. Jones is accused of creating an Instagram account called \"walkdownmontt\" and posting a series of stories that investigators say included derogatory comments about the woman, as well as her location information. The posts offered $15K, jewelry, and a car to get Wilson-Walker's former girlfriend \"took off the map.\" What's next: Both men were charged with criminal solicitation of first-degree murder, conspiracy to murder, and criminal use of communication facility. Wilson-Walker was also charged with terroristic threats, stalking, simple assault, strangulation and other charges related to the victim. Wilson-Walker is being held on over $500K bail, and Jones had his bail set at $99K.

A total of 64 people, including four crew members, were aboard passenger American Airlines Flight 5342, and three soldiers were on theArmy Sikorsky UH-60 Black Hawkthat came from Fort Belvoir in Virginia. All are presumed dead. The tragedy has raised concerns about frequent military training flights around Reagan National Airport, including a helicopter lane that intersects with the flight path of aircraft on the southeastern approach to Runway 33, where American Eagle Flight 5342 from Wichita attempted to land Wednesday, the Post reported. The Federal Aviation Administration has placed an air traffic controller dedicated to helicopters in the National Airport tower to manage the hazards, the report said, citing a source familiar with tower operations. However, an internal preliminary report from the FAA showed that the number of staff members working at the air control tower at DCA was \"not normal for the time of day and volume of traffic\" on Wednesday, the Associated Press reported. \"The position configuration was not normal for the time of day and volume of traffic,\" the report said. DC PLANE CRASH TIMELINE: MIDAIR COLLISION INVOLVES 67 PASSENGERS, CREW MEMBERS, SOLDIERS Graphic shows a timeline of the plane crash near Reagan National Airport near Washington, D.C. (Fox News) Despite the report saying the staffing was \"not normal,\" a person familiar with the matter told Fox News Digital that staffing in the control tower at DCA on Wednesday night was at a normal level. The person explained that the positions get combined regularly if air controllers have to step away from the console for breaks, or if they are involved in a shift change. Controllers may also have to step away when air traffic is slow, the person explained, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss internal procedures. Supervisors have the ability to combine roles, which was the case on Wednesday night, though the person familiar with the matter could not say why. When asked about the air traffic and previous reports of it being heavy on Wednesday night, the source said it was moderate. The Washington Post story cited a 2023 Government Accountability Office report to Congress that found 50 entities operated roughly 88,000 helicopter flights within 30 miles of DCA between 2017 and 2019, citing FAA data.

(ANDREW CABALLERO-REYNOLDS/AFP via Getty Images) Regulators have attempted to define safe paths for military helicopters to fly without interfering with commercial flights landing or taking off at the airport. A 2021 GAO report noted, \"in airspace near Reagan National and the Potomac River, FAA further limits the maximum altitudes for helicopters where helicopter routes overlap with commercial passenger airplane operations to ensure the safety of all aircraft.\" On Wednesday night, air traffic controllers had contacted the Black Hawk pilot and asked whether he could see the approaching commercial aircraft as Flight 5342 prepared to land on Runway 33. \"Do you have the CRJ in sight?\" the controller asked, and the helicopter pilot confirmed he saw the passenger plane. The pilot requested \"visual separation,\" meaning he was trying to get out of the flight's path, according to FlightRadar24 audio. The plane and helicopter collided moments later in a fiery explosion. DC PLANE CRASH LIKELY ‘COMBINATION’ OF FACTORS, ‘LUCKY’ THERE HAVEN'T BEEN MORE AIR ACCIDENTS: ATTORNEY A general view of Reagan National Airport in Arlington, Virginia on Thursday, January 30, 2025. An American Airlines flight from Wichita, Kansas collided with a Black Hawk helicopter while approaching the airport for landing the previous evening. (Le Jim Brauchle, a former U.S. Air Force navigator who is now an attorney representing families of victims in aviation disasters, previously told Fox News Digital that keeping a lookout for obstacles can be difficult. \"Having flown at night, having tried to look and see traffic, I think most people would say, ‘Oh, how hard is it to miss an airliner,’ right? You should be able to see that. But it's a lot more difficult than people would expect,\" he said. At night in an urban environment likeWashington, D.C.,or northern Virginia, pilots may not be able to see other aircraft and instead may rely on seeing anti-collision or landing lights, according to Brauchle. But different ambient lights from tall buildings and towers that are lit may make it difficult to distinguish which lights belong to other aircraft. \"What I've heard from the audio is that they called out to [air traffic control]. The helicopter said that he had the aircraft in sight,\" the attorney said. \"My guess is, and again, I'm just speculating, is they saw something that they thought was the airplane, whether it be a tower light, maybe it was another aircraft that was taking off. Whatever they thought they saw obviously wasn't the aircraft.\" Former Navy pilot Kegan Gill joined FOX 5's D.C. team to discuss the deadly collision. The cause of the collision is currently under investigation by the FAA and several other federal agencies. The close call on Tuesday, the evening before the deadly collision, involved Republic Airways Flight 4514 from Connecticut, the Washington Post reported. The pilot told air traffic controllers it had to divert because of an emergency alert about helicopter traffic below the aircraft. Flight tracker maps showed the plane was headed south along the Potomac River corridor towards Reagan National Airport but took a sharp turn to the west. It later landed safely at 8:16 p.m., the report said. LINK:GET MORE ON THIS STORY FROM FOX NEWS Fox News Digital's Audrey Conklin, Greg Wehner and Stephen Sorace contributed to this report.

WASHINGTON, D.C.-It is being reported that staffing was \"not normal\" in the air traffic control tower at Reagan National Airport during the time of the deadly plane crash on Wednesday night. What we know: In a recent report by the Federal Aviation Administration obtained by The Associated Press, one air traffic controller was working two positions at the time of the crash. \"The position configuration was not normal for the time of day and volume of traffic,\" the report says. Although, the official cause of the crash has not yet been determined. WASHINGTON, DC- JANUARY 30:  Emergency response units search the crash site of the American Airlines plane on the Potomac River after the plane crashed on approach to Reagan National Airport on January 30, 2025 in Washington, DC. The American Airlines flight from Wichita, Kansas collided in midair with a military helicopter while approaching the airport. According to reports, there were no survivors amongst the 67 people on board both aircraft. (Photo by Kayla Bartkowski/Getty Images) The backstory: The American Airlines jet had 60 passengers and four crew members on board. Three soldiers were aboard the helicopter. According to officials, the helicopter apparently flew into the flight path of the plane while it was landing at the airport on Wednesday evening around 9 p.m. The crash triggered a major search-and-rescue operation in the icy Potomac River. Dozens of bodies were recovered from the waters during the overnight hours. The plane's fuselage was found upside down and broken into three sections in waist-deep water. The wreckage of the helicopter was also located. If the casualty numbers hold, this incident could become the deadliest U.S. air crash in nearly 24 years. The National Transportation and Safety Board provide updates on their investigation into the DCA plane crash. What they're saying: NTSB officials stated during a press conference that their main focus is on recovering the bodies of the victims. NTSB board member Todd Inman also stated that a preliminary report on the crash will be released within 30 days. \"Our mission is to understand not just what happened but why it happened, and to recommend changes to prevent it from happening again,\" said Inman. President Donald Trump, Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, and Vice President JD Vance give updates on the deadly plane crash at DCA. What they're saying: During a press conference around 11: 21 a.m., President Trump entered the press room asking for a moment of silence for the victims. The president went on to provide updates on the search, switching to a recovery mission. \"There are no survivors,\" he said. \"As one nation, we grieve for every precious soul that has been taken from us so suddenly,\" Trump said. He also noted that other nations are also grieving for foreign nationals from those countries who were also on the plane. \"We are in mourning.\" He said the U.S. military and the National Transportation Safety Board is investigating. \"We’ll find out how this disaster occurred and will ensure that nothing like this ever happens again,\" he said. The president said he was naming Chris Rocheleau, a 22-year FAA veteran, as acting commissioner to the Federal Aviation Administration. \"The FAA is actively recruiting workers who suffer severe intellectual disabilities, psychiatric problems, and other mental and physical conditions under a diversity and inclusion hiring initiative spelled out on the agency’s website,\" said Trump, noting that the program allowed for the hiring of people with hearing and vision issues as well as paralysis, epilepsy and \"dwarfism.\" Trump said air traffic controllers need to be geniuses.

We have had a much higher standard than anybody else. And there are things that you have to go by brain power, you have to go by psychological quality, and psychological quality is a very important element of it. These are various very powerful tests that we put to use, and they were terminated by Biden, and Biden went by a standard that is the exact opposite.\" Trump went on to say that for an air traffic controller \"we want the brightest, the smartest, the sharpest, we want somebody that is psychologically superior, and that's what we are going to have.\" The Source:Information in this article comes from the Associated Press and FOX 5 reporting.

This week saw a number ofexecutive orders from President Donald Trump, fieryconfirmation hearingsfor his cabinet nominees, and of course thetragic midair collisioninvolving an Army helicopter and passenger jet. Friday, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt held her secondbriefingof the new administration at 1 p.m. ET. President Trump will then sign more executive orders at 3 p.m., according to the White House daily schedule. It’s not yet clear what the orders will be, though tariffs on Canada and Mexico have been a hot topic for the president this week. You can watch these events in the player above, and refresh this story for updates. U.S. President Donald Trump talks to reporters from the Resolute Desk after signing an executive order to appoint the deputy administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration in the Oval Office at the White House on January 30, 2025 in Washington, 3:30 p.m. ET:The remains of 41 people had been pulled from the river as of Friday afternoon, including 28 that had been positively identified, Washington, D.C., Fire Chief John Donnelly Sr. said at a news conference. He said next of kin notifications had been made to 18 families, and that he expects the remains of all 67 people who died to eventually be recovered. The wreckage of the plane's fuselage will probably have to be pulled from the water to get all the bodies, he said. \"This is heartbreaking work,\" Donnelly said, noting that more than 300 responders were taking part in the effort at any one time, including teams of divers and two U.S. Coast Guard cutters, at least one of which carries a crane. \"It’s been a tough response for a lot of our people.\" It was unclear how long the recovery operation would take. Although Ronald Reagan National Airport has reopened, two of its three runways remain closed to keep aircraft from flying over the crash scene while taking off or landing, said Terry Liercke, the airport's vice president and manager. Roughly 100 flights were canceled Friday. 3:20 p.m. ET:Trump administration officials are moving to fire FBI agents engaged ininvestigations involving President Donald Trump in the coming days, two people familiar with the plans said Friday. It was not clear how many agents might be affected, though scores of investigators were involved in various inquiries touching Trump. Officials acting at the direction of the administration have been working to identify individual employees who participated in politically sensitive investigations for possible termination, said the people who insisted on anonymity to discuss private conversations. 1:45 p.m. ET:Leavitt said the White House applauded the release of 8 additional hostages from Hamas captivity. \"Thanks to the ceasefire deal secured by President Trump, 3 Israeli and 5 Thai Nationals are being reunited with their families and their loved ones after being held in unspeakable conditions, for over 15 months, and the president remains committed to the release of all remaining hostages, and they should have never been taken by the brutal terrorist group Hamas in the first place,\" she stated. 1:40 p.m. ET:\"When you are flying on an airplane with your loved ones, which every one of us in this room has, do you pray that that your plane lands safely and gets you to your destination or do you pray that the pilot has a certain skin color? I think we all know the answer to that question, and as President Trump said yesterday, it's common sense,\" Leavitt said. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt addresses President Donald Trump and the administration's response to the deadly mid-air collision over the Potomac River outside of Reagan National Airport. Since taking office on Jan. 20, U.S., Trump has issued a series of executive orders aimed at dismantling diversity, equity and inclusion programs. Trump also began his White House briefing Thursday with a moment of silence and a prayer for victims ofWednesday’s crash at Reagan National Airport. But his remarks quickly became a diatribe against diversity hiring and that lowered standards may have been to blame for the crash. 1:30 p.m. ET:\"I can confirm that tomorrow, the February 1 deadline that President Trump put into place, that a statement several weeks ago continues, the president will be implementing tomorrow a 25% tariffs on Mexico, 25% tariffs on Canada and a 10% tariff on China,\" Leavitt said. She continued: \"At this point, the president has made it very clear those tariffs are going to be implemented. And in effect, if the president at any time decides to roll back those tariffs, I'll leave it to him to make that decision. But starting tomorrow, those tariffs will be in place.\" 1:14 p.m. ET:Leavitt said President Trump wants to increase Federal Aviation Administration standards following the tragic plane crash near Washington D.C. on Wednesday. She said that Trump said that the helicopter was flying higher than the plane should have been, but she noted that the investigation was still ongoing. 1:07 p.m. ET:At Friday's White House press briefing, press secretary Leavitt said the White House received more than 10,000 submissions for its open media seats. These seats were opened Friday for Ruthless Podcast, which covers political news and is hosted by Josh Holmes and Michael Duncan. 12:45 p.m. ET:Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth says investigators have not yet recovered a key recording device from the Army helicopter involved in Wednesday’s fatal collision at Ronald Reagan National Airport, AP says. Speaking on Fox News Channel on Friday, Hegseth noted authorities were still looking for the helicopter’s black box. Other factors in the crash, including the helicopter’s altitude and whether the crew was using its night vision goggles, are still under investigation, Hegseth said. 12:15 p.m. ET:President Donald Trump took to his social media platform, Truth Social, on Friday to post that the Black Hawk helicopter that collided with the American Airlines passenger jet near Ronald Reagan National Airport resulting in the deaths of everyone onboard \"was flying too high, by a lot.\" \"It was far above the 200-foot limit.

Kennedy appeared first on Wednesday before the Finance Committee, one of two committees with jurisdiction over HHS, and again on Thursday before the Health Committee. Kennedy's confirmation is far from certain in the Senate, where he is expected to face pointed questioning from both Republicans and Democrats on the chamber's health and finance committees. Kennedy’s nomination alarmed people who are concerned about his record of spreading unfounded fears about vaccines. He has long advanced the debunked idea that vaccines cause autism. Caroline Kennedy urged the U.S. Senate in a Tuesday letter to reject the nomination of her cousin to be President Donald Trump's health secretary,calling him a \"predator.\" Caroline Kennedy wrote a scathing letter Tuesday encouraging the U.S. Senate to deny the nomination of her cousin, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., to be President Donald Trump's health secretary. In the letter to senators obtained by the Associated Press, she called Robert F. Kennedy Jr. a \"predator\" who is addicted to power. Ms. Kennedy said in the letter that her cousin’s views on vaccines are disqualifying. She offered senators personal details from their lives growing up together that she said pose an even greater concern. Kennedy ran for president as a Democrat, then as an independent, before he dropped out and endorsed PresidentDonald Trump. The backstory: Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is the son of Democratic icon Robert F. Kennedy, who was assassinated in 1968 during his own presidential campaign. The 71-year-old, whose famous name and family tragedies have put him in the national spotlight since he was a child, has spent years airing his populist — and sometimes extreme — views in podcasts, TV interviews and speeches, building his own quixotic brand. PREVIOUS:Trump expected to nominate RFK Jr. for health secretary Kennedy's numerous remarks, anti-vaccine nonprofit and lawsuits against immunizations are likely to haunt him. RELATED:McConnell slams polio vaccine critics in apparent warning to RFK Jr. He's rejected the anti-vaccine label, instead casting himself as a crusader for \"medical freedom\" who wants more research. He and Trump have vowed not to \"take away\" vaccines. To defuse criticism, he resigned from the Children’s Health Defense, his nonprofit that has filed dozens of lawsuits against vaccines, including government authorizations of some of them. In his opening statement Wednesday, Kennedy rejected the ‘anti-vaccine’ label, telling senators he’s not anti-vaccine but has asked \"uncomfortable questions.\" While Kennedy has called vaccines unsafe, in his opening remarks he said all of his children are vaccinated. \"I believe that vaccines play a critical role in health care,\" Kennedy told the committee. Dig deeper: Other conservatives have questioned Kennedy's abortion views, after he said last year that it should be legal for full-term pregnancies. His campaign later clarified that he supports abortion rights until fetal viability, around 22 to 24 weeks. In meetings with some senators, he promised to follow Trump's directive on the issue. Republican Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri, for example, said he was convinced after talking to Kennedy that he would be a strong anti-abortion advocate. But skepticism remains, with Pence's advocacy group highlighting his abortion views in an ad campaign. \"RFK Jr. has made certain overtures to pro-life leaders that he would be mindful of their concerns at HHS, there is little reason for confidence at this time,\" his group said in a letter sent to senators last week. In Iowa, Kennedy's nomination both excites and worries corn and soybean farmer Brian Fyre. The sixth-generation farmer and Republican thinks Kennedy will offer a fresh perspective, but he also can't afford the ban on corn syrup or pesticides that Kennedy has promised. If confirmed, Kennedy would oversee the Food and Drug Administration, which has the power to enact restrictions. Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson, a Republican from a dairy farm state, sees it differently, telling a crowd at the Heritage Foundation last month that Kennedy's agriculture ideas are a promising part of a bigger goal: \"to Make America Healthy Again.\" Big picture view: Health and Human Services has a broad reach across the lives of Americans, including inspecting the nation’s food, regulating medicines and overseeing research of diseases and cures. It provides health insurance for nearly half of the country — poor, disabled and older Americans, including via Medicare. FROM THE ARCHIVES: LiveNOW from FOX host Christy Matino spoke to Dr. Richard Besser, president and CEO of Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and former acting director of the CDC, about RFK Jr.'s nomination. What's next: After Trump nominates his picks for various positions, they are then presented to the appropriate Senate committee. The committee then votes whether to recommend a candidate to the full Senate. The full Senate will debate. Trump's picks will either be confirmed or rejected by a simple majority. If they are approved, they are then sworn-in. Republicans currently hold 53 seats in the Senate, which could suggest many of Trump's picks will be confirmed without issue.

        "title": "An Abington college student died after being extorted on Instagram and Snapchat. His family blames the social platforms.",
        "source": "https://www.inquirer.com/",
        "content": "A lawsuit filed by Jack Sullivan’s parents says the social media companies facilitated the crime through their platforms and failed to remove predatory accounts. Eighteen hours after Jack Sullivan received an Instagram message from a user who called themselves Alice Dave, he was dead. The 20-year-old Kutztown University sophomore was watching a movie, his father next to him on the couch intheirAbingtonhome, when the young, strange woman sparked a flirtatious conversation. The two exchanged messages, and later intimate photos on Snapchat — the app infamous for disappearing messages. But later on that January 2023 night, Alice’s flirty texts were replaced with threats that if Sullivan didn’t send money, she would share the photos with his family, friends, and campus community. “all u have to do is cooperate with me and i will not expose u, if you block me i will ruin your life,” Alice wrote, according to law enforcement records. “don’t try to act smart I know where you live.” By the following afternoon, Sullivan transferred roughly $2,800, court records show. But his extortionist refused to delete the photos. Less than 24 hours after the first message, Sullivan walked onto train tracks leading to theJenkintownSEPTAstation.He paced on the tracks for a few minutes as Alice demanded more payments. “I don’t even think I have enough for it,” he wrote. Three minutes later a passing train struck and killed him. Sullivan’s death was originally ruled a suicide, but the coroner’s office in Montgomery County changed the cause of death to homicide once details of the events leading up to it became clear. Sullivanwas a victim of an online sexual extortion, orsextortion, scheme. Federal law enforcement has been prosecuting two Nigerian men, Imoleayo Samuel Aina and Samuel Olasunkanmi Abiodun, in connection with Alice’s account and Sullivan’s death. Amid the criminal prosecution, Sullivan’s parents filed a civil lawsuit against the social media companies that they said facilitated the crime through their platforms and failed to remove predatory accounts. The December complaint, filed in Common Pleas Court in Philadelphia, accuses Meta — which owns Facebook and Instagram — and Snap Inc. — which owns Snapchat — of deliberately creating addictive platforms without protecting vulnerable users. “They gave these individuals the tools, the environment, the platform, the algorithm, and the pool of victims to commit their crimes,” said Kevin O’Brien, an attorney with Stampone O’Brien Dilsheimer Holloway who represents the family. The lawsuit is the latest against tech giants as lawmakers and judges struggle to determine whether social media platforms are neutral publishers of third-party content or products that can be held liable for harm they cause. “Sextortion is a horrific crime,” a spokesperson for Meta said. “We work aggressively to fight it, disrupting networks of scammers and supporting law enforcement in investigating and prosecuting them.” Snap Inc. did not respond to a request for comment. The lawsuit also names SEPTA, and businesses that own the land leading to the tracks, as defendants. A spokesperson for SEPTA declined to comment on the litigation but said the agency’s investigation found the train engineer reacted appropriately. When Jim Sullivan, Jack Sullivan’s father, received the call that his son was found dead on the train tracks, he was shocked and set out to piece together his son’s last hours, ultimately learning of the threats from his son’s phone. He reached out to Alice, who responded with more threats. “So we very clearly understood exactly what had happened,” Jim Sullivan said. Jim Sullivan worked with law enforcement to identify the people who extorted his son, and Aina and Abiodun wereextraditedin August to face charges of cyberstalking resulting in death, extortion, and wire fraud, and other offenses. » READ MORE:What is Sextortion and how can you help prevent it? | Expert Opinion Abiodun has pleaded guilty to wire fraud and conspiracy to commit money laundering, and awaits sentencing. Aina’s prosecution is ongoing. Their attorneys did not respond to requests for comment. The U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania declined to comment. Both men are allegedly associated with a network of mostly Nigerian scammers known as “Yahoo Boys,” originally named for the use of Yahoo email accounts. Sextortion incidents have increased in recent years, the FBI says. Perpetrators most commonly target boys ages 14 to 17, and the agency received more than 13,000 reports of sextortion between October 2021 and March 2023 that led to at least 20 deaths. In August, Levi Maciejewski, the 13-year-old son of the head football coach at Shippensburg University in Cumberland County, died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound after he was preyed on in a sextortion scheme,PennLive reported. “This can happen to anybody,” Jim Sullivan said. The Sullivans’ lawsuit goes to the heart of an ongoing debate over harms of social media use — especially for young people — and the legal responsibilities of tech companies. As many as 95% of American teens are on social media platforms, and a third report using them “almost constantly,”according to research cited in a 2023 advisory by the U.S. Surgeon General’s Office. Teens who spend more than three hours a day on social media platforms have double the risk of depression and anxiety, and half of teens report that social media makes them feel worse about the way they look, according to the advisory. Children and teens on social media are also exposed to “challenges” that can promote risky behavior. For example, a 10-year-old Chester girl, Nylah Anderson,died in 2021 while attempting the “blackout challenge,”a viralTikToktrend that encouraged children to use household items to choke themselves. The mental health harms, risky challenges, and scams have led to lawsuits by parents nationwide. And courts have been struggling to apply laws that were written before the advent of social media to the reality of complex algorithms and personalized feeds. So far, the U.S. Supreme Court has found thatsocial media platforms are not liable when bad actors use their algorithm. For example, the courtheld in 2023that social media companies were not aiding and abetting terrorism when their algorithms recommended ISIS-related content and their platforms were used for recruitment. “If the Mafia uses the phones, AT&T is not responsible if the godfather places a hit on someone,” said Amanda Shanor, a professor of legal studies and business ethics at the Wharton School of Business at the University of Pennsylvania, in explaining the rationale for these decisions. » READ MORE:A Delco mom can sue TikTok for her daughter’s death during a ‘blackout challenge,’ federal appeals court rules But what many lawsuits — including the Sullivans’ complaint — argue is that the platform addicted users, increasing their risk for poor mental health. Or, in Jack Sullivan’s case, increasing the chance that he would be an available victim. “This isn’t like a phone, this is like a cigarette,” Shanor said, describing the argument. Last year,the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit rejected TikTok’s argumentthat it cannot be sued over Nylah’s death. And other lawsuits challenging protections for social media companies are making their way through federal courts. Meta has taken steps to reduce the risk of sextortion on its platforms, including an effort to specifically target the Yahoo Boys. In July, the company announced that it removed around63,000 Instagram accounts from Nigeria that attempted to target other users for sextortion. It also removed Facebook accounts, pages, and groups that were run by the Yahoo Boys. Meta also incorporated a feature that blurs nude images in messages and warns people of the risks of sending them, a spokesperson said. The Sullivans’ lawsuit says this effort is proof Meta could have removed accounts earlier, but didn’t. “There was nothing preventing these measures, design changes, and/or reasonable warnings from being implemented and integrated into the application products well in advance” of Jack Sullivan’s Jan. 4, 2023, death, the complaint says. » READ MORE:A Lyft driver was killed in Fairhill by the driver of a stolen Kia. His daughter is suing the car company for making the vehicles so easy to steal. Snapchat, with its main feature of disappearing messages, could not have been betterdesigned for the Yahoo Boys if the scammers had designed it themselves, saidO’Brien, the Sullivans’ lawyer. Jim Sullivan hopes the lawsuit can push social media companies to do more. And he plans to use his experience to speak to young people about the risks that exist on social media. He wants teens and college students to know that it is possible to walk away from an extortion attempt and connect with an authority figure, despite the shame and fear. “Jack was optimistic and a problem solver, empathetic, and a helper, and all of these really great, positive resourceful things, and couldn’t see his way out of this trap,” he said. “You can get yourself out of it.”",

        "content": "With pitchers and catchers due to report for spring training in less than two weeks, it’s time to assess the Phillies’ future, with input from opposing scouts. It didn’t require much squinting for thePhilliesto see Starlyn Caba as a future major-league shortstop. But for an organization that’s trying to balance winning aWorld Serieswith a $300 million roster and ripening the farm system, there are limits to how many prospects can be off-limits in trades. So, after a year of hanging up on teams that called about Caba, the Philliesdealt him to the Marlinsin December for lefty starter Jesús Luzardo. Even so, the Phillies wouldn’t have made the move if not for Luzardo’s reasonable salary ($6.225 million this year) and two seasons of club control. At least not for Caba, “who we like a great deal,” president of baseball operationsDave Dombrowskisaid last month. » READ MORE:Phillies storylines to watch in 2025: Transforming Trea Turner, welcoming back Alec Bohm, and more But while Caba recently cracked Baseball America’s top 100 prospects list at No. 72, the Phillies’ farm system still features Andrew Painter (No. 9), Aidan Miller (36), Eduardo Tait (93), and Justin Crawford (96). Painter is expected to make his major-league debut this year; Miller and Crawford will join him as non-roster invitees to major-league camp. And because pitchers and catchers are due to report for spring training in less than two weeks, it’s time for The Inquirer’s ranking of the top 10 Phillies prospects, an annual exercise carried out with input from opposing scouts. Age:22 (on April 10) |Height/weight:6-foot-7 / 215 |Throws:Right 2024 stats:Did not pitch (injured). Outlook:He’sbaaaaaaack. Sort of. Eighteen months after an elbow-ligament reconstruction, Painter will throw bullpen sessions and do everything else with the healthy pitchers in major-league camp. But hewon’t pitch in spring training games, Dombrowski said, because the Phillies want to balance an innings limit in his return from injury with having him available later in the season. » READ MORE:Andrew Painter is healthy and pitching again. Here’s how the Phillies are planning for his return in 2025. Key question:When will he finally make his major-league debut? “July-ish,” in Dombrowski’s words. If all goes as planned in a buildup that will continue in Clearwater after camp breaks and proceed through the minors, Painter will touch down in Philly by the summer. He affirmed his health — and cemented his status as a top-five pitching prospect in the sport — by dominating the Arizona Fall League (2.30 ERA, four walks, 18 strikeouts in 15⅔ innings). His fastball returned to the upper-90s, and he flashed a harder slider. “He’s one of the best pitchers I’ve seen,” Guardians top prospect Chase DeLauter told MLB.com. “Elite stuff.” Age:21 (on June 9) |Height/weight:6-2 / 205 |Bats/throws:Right 2024 stats:.275/.401/.483, 5 HR, 14.3% walk rate, 21.4% strikeout rate at low-A Clearwater (182 plate appearances); .258/.353/.444, 5 HR, 11.6% BB rate, 22.1% K rate at high-A Jersey Shore (258 PA); .191/.227/.191, 0 HR, 0 BB%, 18.2% K rate at double-A Reading (22 PA). Outlook:Through 18 games after getting promoted to high-A in June, Miller batted .167 with one homer, 19 strikeouts, and a .558 OPS. Over his next 40 games, he batted .296 with five homers, 38 strikeouts, and an .897 OPS. And scouts who didn’t already believe in him were converted to the cult. “All-Star upside,” said one NL talent evaluator. “He’s got a good chance to succeed as a high-contact, extra-base-hit guy in the 20- to 25-homer realm by 2026.” » READ MORE:Aidan Miller ‘can get used to this’ after teaming up with Phillies top prospects Key question:Is he a long-term shortstop? When the Phillies drafted Miller in the first round in 2023, the industry presumption was that he would eventually shift over to third base. It hasn’t happened. And withTrea Turnerlikely to move from shortstop within the next few years, it’s sensible to keep Miller where he is. Besides, as one scout noted, Miller is “not flashy or quick, but steady, poised, and very instinctive” at shortstop. Age:21 |Height/weight:6-1 / 175 |Bats/throws:Left/right 2024 stats:.301/.349/.438, 6 HR, 27-for-35 stolen bases, 6.6% BB rate, 20.1% K rate at Jersey Shore (317 PA); .333/.380/.455, 3 HR, 15-for-16 SB, 6.1% BB rate, 16.1% K rate at Reading (180 PA). Outlook:Within the scouting community, the most frequently cited criticism of Crawford is his extreme tendency to hit the ball on the ground. It’s notable, then, that his ground-ball rate went from 69.7% in 2023 to 60.9% last year. There’s room for further improvement, but given his speed, Crawford can turn ant-killing grounders into infield hits. He led the farm system in hits (143) and was second in doubles (25) last season, then homered to lead Team USA into the medal round of the Premier 12 Tournament in November. » READ MORE:Phillies prospect Justin Crawford lived ‘a dream’ playing for Team USA Key question:Will he graduate to the majors this year? The Phillies have had seven opening-day center fielders in the last seven years. Crawford is a long shot to be No. 8. But if Crawford makes an impression in his first major-league camp, Dombrowski won’t be shy about pushing him. With the Red Sox, Dombrowski called up Andrew Benintendi at age 21 from double A in 2016 and Rafael Devers at age 20 after nine triple-A games in 2017. Crawford’s father, Carl, made his major-league debut at age 20. Justin’s time is coming. Age:18 |Height/weight:5-11 / 219 |Bats/throws:Left/right 2024 stats:.321/.377/.500, 6 HR, 6.1% BB rate, 14.6% K rate in rookie ball (212 PA); .269/.316/.462, 5 HR, 7% BB rate, 28.9% K rate at Clearwater (114 PA). Outlook:In 1998, the Phillies signed a teenage catcher from Panama for $8,000. Carlos Ruiz turned out to be pretty good. They returned to that Central America country in 2022 and paid $90,000 for Tait. So far, the reviews are positive. Tait’s calling card is his left-handed power that one scout labeled as “special.” In his first season in the United States, he registered some of the highest exit velocities recorded by Phillies minor leaguers. After beginning the season in rookie ball, he ended it as one of the youngest players in the Florida State League. » READ MORE:J.T. Realmuto or … who? The Phillies will face a complex decision with their star catcher. Key question:Will he stay behind the plate? It can be difficult for talent evaluators to predict the future of a catching prospect because of the responsibility that comes with the position. When the catcher is still a teenager, the projection is nearly impossible. One scout cited Tait’s arm strength and said he “has the raw tools to continue to mature defensively.” Another cautioned that Tait’s “fully developed body” might keep growing and take him out from behind the plate. Either way, he’s light-years away from the majors. But his journey will be fascinating to follow. Age:22 (on June 9) |Height/weight:6-1 / 213 |Throws:Right 2024 stats:3.46 ERA, 1.288 WHIP, 13.5% walk rate, 34.2% strikeout rate at Orioles’ high-A Aberdeen (52 innings); 4.15 ERA, 1.038 WHIP, 8.6% BB rate, 37.1% K rate at Jersey Shore (8⅔ IP); 3.66 ERA, 1.068 WHIP, 9.1% BB rate, 45.5% K rate at Reading (19⅔ IP). Outlook:Aftertrading two pitching prospects(George Klassen and Sam Aldegheri) to the Angels at the deadline for reliever Carlos Estévez, the Philliesgot two back(Chace and Seth Johnson) from the Orioles for lefty Gregory Soto. Chace struck out 48 of 112 batters in six starts between Jersey Shore and Reading and exhibited better control than in the past in Baltimore’s system. How’s that for a strong first impression? » READ MORE:Meet the pitching prospects the Phillies got in the Gregory Soto trade: Seth Johnson and Moisés Chace Key question:Does he project as a starter or a reliever? A lot will ride on the development of Chace’s slider — and to a lesser extent, changeup. He throws two variations of a slider: a sweeper and a hard cutter. The latter is a more recent addition and figures to help against left-handed hitters. If he’s able to command both sliders, in addition to a fastball that comes from a low arm slot and tends to miss bats, he will have the weapons to go through a lineup multiple times. Age:23 |Height/weight:6-5 / 190 |Throws:Right 2024 stats:6.46 ERA, 1.813 WHIP, 15.1% BB rate, 22.7% K rate at triple-A Lehigh Valley (108⅔ innings). Outlook:Look out below. Once regarded alongside Painter asNo. 1 and 1Ain the Phillies system, Abel is tumbling down the prospect chart after a dreadful season in which he couldn’t throw strikes consistently. His struggles began with an illness late in spring training, and things got only marginally better. (Abel had a 6.88 ERA at the All-Star break, 5.75 thereafter.) But he stayed healthy and topped 100 innings for a second consecutive season. » READ MORE:From 2023: Don’t forget about Mick Abel, the other half of the Phillies’ best pitching prospect duo in 20 years Key question:Was 2024 a developmental speed bump or a warning sign? Perspective is important. Abel pitched last season at 22, five years younger than the average age in the triple-A International League, according toBaseball-Reference.com. That isn’t insignificant. He’s also a cerebral student of pitching, and with a five-pitch repertoire, there’s a lot for him to think about. Maybe he’d benefit from simplifying things. Mostly, though, it comes down to throwing strikes and trusting his stuff to get high-level hitters out. Nori’s age:20| Height/weight:5-10 / 190| Bats/throws:Left Burkholder’s age:19| Height/weight:6-2 / 195| Bats/throws:Right Nori’s 2024 stats:.240/.424/.280, 0 HR, 4-for-6 SB, 24.2% BB rate, 21.2% K rate at Clearwater (66 PA) Burkholder’s 2024 stats:.500/.500/1.500, 0 HR, 0% BB rate, 0% K rate at Clearwater (2 PA) Outlook:It feels like a cop-out to lump together the Phillies’first two picks from the 2024 draft, but the on-field sample size isn’t large enough for scouts to separate them. Burkholder, in particular, played only four innings in his pro debut Aug. 13 before straining his hamstring. After a glimpse of Nori, one scout noted his speed and on-base ability and projected a Johnny “Damon-esque-type ceiling” as a center fielder. » READ MORE:Phillies draft high school outfielders Dante Nori and Griffin Burkholder with their first two picks Key question:Which outfielder will be the better player? The comparisons are inevitable. Not only were Nori and Burkholder drafted only 36 picks apart, but both came out of high school. They even got identical signing bonuses ($2,497,500). Nori’s speed and defense in center field might make him the safer bet; Burkholder’s right-handed power potential might boost his ceiling. They’re expected to share the outfield for Clearwater this season. Age:24 (on March 3)| Height/weight:6-3 / 225| Bats/throws:Left/right 2024 stats:.263/.357/.487, 11 HR, 20-for-27 SB, 11.6% BB rate, 25.6% K rate at Reading (258 PA) Outlook:After missing two months last season with a torn ligament in his right thumb, Rincones batted .296 with eight doubles, six homers, and a .961 OPS in his first 23 games upon rejoining Reading’s lineup. Consider it a snapshot of his potential. To make up for lost time, the Phillies sent him to the Arizona Fall League, where he reached base at a .367 clip with only two homers but also just seven strikeouts in 90 plate appearances. If he stays healthy, there’s 20-homer/20-steal upside. » READ MORE:From 2023: The Phillies’ next great hitting prospect might be a Scottish Venezuelan-American with a frame like Pat Burrell Key question:Could he contribute in the majors this season? Maybe. It’s no secret the Phillies lack corner-outfield depth, but they’re so thin that they recently purchased 22-year-old Dylan Campbell from the Dodgers for international bonus money. Rincones might open the season back in double A, but it won’t be long before he’s in Lehigh Valley. And if the Phillies need help beyondNick Castellanos, Max Kepler,Brandon Marsh, Johan Rojas, Weston Wilson, and perhaps out-of-options Kody Clemens, they will reach down and find … Rincones? Age:23| Height/weight:6-0 / 160| Throws:Right 2024 stats:3.39 ERA, 1.091 WHIP, 8% BB rate, 29% K rate at Jersey Shore (77 IP); 4.85 ERA, 1.517 WHIP, 6.1% BB rate, 14.4% K rate at Reading (29⅔ IP). Outlook:The Phillies added Cabrera to the 40-man roster in November because they didn’t want to risk losing him in the Rule 5 draft. And he probably would’ve been selected. Never mind his slight build. The skinny righty pitched into the sixth inning in 10 of 19 starts and struck out nearly 25% of batters. He does it with two fastballs but also an above-average changeup that is widely considered his best pitch. » READ MORE:Will Bryson Stott and Orion Kerkering be part of the next Phillies core? Their 2025 seasons will be telling. Key question:Is his future in the bullpen? Undersize pitchers don’t tend to stick in starting rotations. Across baseball last season, only eight 5-foot-11 or shorter pitchers made at least five starts. The Phillies haven’t had a 5-foot-11 or shorter pitcher make at least five starts in a season since Pedro Martínez and Antonio Bastardo in 2009. Cabrera has the repertoire to be a starter. It will come down to commanding his pitches and staying healthy. Age:20| Height/weight:5-10 / 180| Bats/throws:Right 2024 stats:.338/.495/.481, 3 HR, 9-for-9 SB, 20.2% BB rate, 9.6% K rate in rookie ball (104 PA). Outlook:Remember this name. Multiple scouts listed Escobar as a sleeper in the Phillies’ farm system. He signed for $450,000 out of  Venezuela in 2022 and made a solid, albeit brief, stateside debut last season in the Florida Complex League. Sidelined by double shin splints after 24 games, he flashed impressive bat-to-ball skills and sneaky power. One NL scout compared him to the Astros’ Isaac Paredes for both his contact rate and infield versatility. » READ MORE:The Phillies’ reliever numbers don’t add up now, but that’s part of Dave Dombrowski’s bullpen-building calculation Key question:Where does he stack up among Phillies infield prospects? Bryan Rincon, a switch-hitting shortstop who turns 21 next week, gets strong reviews for his defense. Devin Saltiban, who turns 20 next month, has more advanced skills at the plate and the versatility to project as a utility player in the majors. Given his age and inexperience, Escobar might be more of a project but have a higher ceiling, according to one NL scout. The Phillies figure to challenge him at the low-A level.",

Graham said his season was finished after he suffered a torn triceps on Nov. 24 and yet here he is, preparing for a chance to face the Kansas City Chiefs on Feb. 9. The New York Times and Forbes have reported that torn triceps typically take five to six months to fully heal. “So far, man, this has been one of the easiest injuries I’ve had compared to the ones I had before,” Graham insisted. “If it’s not feeling right, I’m not going to do it, butso far, so good.” Again, it’s a long shot, but what a story it would be. Barkley will be a story for sure when he celebrates his 28th birthday on Super Bowl Sunday. In the midst of a historic first season with theBirds, the All-Pro running back is intent on sealing the deal. His Eagles teammates have told him how wrenching it was losing the Super Bowl two years ago. “Definitely don’t want to be part of that,” Barkley said. “That’s definitely something that drives us. For those guys that have been a part of it, but also just want to get the job done and knowing how it is for those guys, how it felt, and doing everything I can in my ... ability to make surethat doesn’t happen.” — Jim Swan,@phillysport,sports.daily@inquirer.com.

That became official Thursday when Tyrese Maxey was not selected as a reserve for the Eastern Conference. Perennial All-Stars Joel Embiid and Paul George were already taken out of contention, largely because of injuries. As for Maxey, his exclusion could be considered a snub. The point guard is sixth in scoring at 27.6 points per game and third in steals with 2.0 per game. His best work came in the Sixers’ most recent games. Maxey has scored 28 points or more in his last 12 games, joining Hall of Famers Wilt Chamberlain and Allen Iverson and teammate Embiid as the only players to maintain such a streak. Maxey faced steep competition at guard, though. Selected as reserves for the East were Boston’s Jaylen Brown, Milwaukee’s Damian Lillard, Cleveland’s Darius Garland, Miami’s Tyler Herro, andDetroit’s Cade Cunningham. Playing for the 49ers, linebacker Oren Burks found himself thrust into Super Bowl LVIII last year when starter Dre Greenlaw went down with an injury. Burks is headed back to the big game, this time as an injury replacement for Nakobe Dean. And this time, Burks is coming off one of the best games of his career in the NFC championship game. “The season has a lot of ebbs and flows, but this is the big one that you’ve beenpreparing for your whole life,” Burks said. The Chiefs are saying all the right things as they get ready for the Eagles. Andy Reid heaped praise on the Birds, saying “they’re fully loaded on the offensive side.” Ahead of their game Thursday with the New York Islanders, the Flyers decided to make a change on the blue line. They called up a Swedish defenseman from Lehigh Valley, but it was not Emil Andrae or Helge Grans. This time, the Flyers called up Adam Ginning from the Phantoms. A stay-at-home defenseman, Ginning brings one thing for sure to the Flyersat 6-foot-4: size. Amid that game, it was discovered that the Flyers struck a deal with the Calgary Flames to trade both Morgan Frost and Joel Farabee in exchange for Andrei Kuzmenko and Jakob Pelletier, a 2025 second-round pick, and a 2028 seventh-round pick. An interesting move, considering both Frost and Farabee were once valued as part of ayoung group poised to lead the Flyers. The team could use some guidance at the moment, following a3-0 loss to the New York Islanders last night. Our Devin Jackson is at Senior Bowl workouts in Mobile, Ala., checking out the next batch of NFL players ahead of the draft in April.

Among your responses: My earliest memory of watching the Eagles (on a tiny black and white TV) was during the 1956 season﻿. However, I will never forget listening to the NFL championship game at Franklin Field between the Eagles and Vince Lombardi’s Green Bay Packers in December 1960 on WCAU Radio — because home games were blacked out on local TV — with my Dad. I can still hear Bill Campbell’s voice counting down the final seconds of the 17-13 win after Chuck Bednarik’s final tackle of Jim Taylor on the Eagle 10-yard line. Oh, and did I mention, my father and I were jumping up and down? If there were a moment when I truly became a proud Eagle fan, that was it.— John D. I’ve been a fan since the mid ’50s but it was the “Cinderella” 1960 championship team that really kick-started my fandom. They were picked to finish last in the conference ( back then there were 2 conferences-8 teams in each. The 2 teams that finished in 1st place played for the championship). We finished 10-2 and beat Green Bay, 17-13. Caught them just before the Lombardi dynasty kicked in. Van Brocklin, McDonald, Bednarik, Retzlaff, et al... Great year!— Jack H. The Eagles won the NFL championships in 1948 and ’49, beating the Chicago Cardinals and then the L.A. Rams. We did not have a TV, but I would see newsreels of the team on the Saturday morning movies at Media and Drexel Hill when we would go to see the Westerns. Then I followed them in the newspapers back then and talked about them with my school friends. Bosh Pritchard, Pete Pihos, Tommy Thompson, and Steve Van Buren were the stars. I sometime rode my bike from Springfield to Clifton Heights to visit Steve Van Buren on Baltimore Pike where he was selling cars during the offseason. I did not see a live game until the 1950’s.— Everett S. This is gonna sound super lame, but I have the people at EA sports to thank! When I was about 7 or 8, I downloaded Madden Mobile on my iPad. One of the first things you had to do was choose a team! I picked the Eagles because I was (and am) a very patriotic person and associated eagles with America. Less than a few years later [Nick Foles] led us to our first ring.— Stiles B. My dad got me going with the Eagles, but they were not totally on my radar until the 1960 NFL championship. Back then, the league wasn’t the TV presence it has become, nor was any pro sport. When we visited my grandparents on Sundays, we’d watch home games on a black-and-white TV in a tiny room on the second floor, so as not to distract the family. It was that classic win over Green Bay, and Concrete Charlie basically holding Jimmy Taylor down as the clock ran down and the Birds won. This 11-year-old was sold for good.— Mike R.

        "source": "https://www.inquirer.com/",
        "content": "The Philly DA, soon expected to announce his campaign for reelection, said his office won’t interfere in legal actions taken by ICE. But if agents act beyond their legal scope or bring harm to immigrants, he said, “Try me.” Philadelphia District AttorneyLarry Krasnersaid Friday that local elected officials and law enforcement cannot be forced to comply with the Trump administration’s “Nazi stuff,” referring to the president’s planned crackdown on immigration. “Local law enforcement can volunteer to do Nazi stuff,” Krasner, a Democrat, said. “I’m sure I stand with all my colleagues up here when we say nope, N-O-P-E, nope. Maybe there are some local law enforcement who want to put on jackboots and gray uniforms and march behind this, but not us.” The comment came during a news conference Friday at Philadelphia City Hall where state representatives and City Council members condemned PresidentDonald Trump’s actions on immigration,including rescinding guidance that once barred federal agents from entering churches, schools, and hospitals. Reports of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement activity have reverberated around the Philadelphia area since Trump took office, heightening anxieties for immigrant communities. Earlier this week, ICE agents raided a North Philadelphia car wash,arresting seven people and triggering a protest. Officials on Friday aimed to make the public aware of Philadelphia’s intentions to protect its immigrant communities in the sanctuary city. Krasner, who has long positioned himself as and campaigned on being a staunch adversary to Trump, is expected to launch his reelection bid for a third term as DA in the coming weeks. Earlier this month, formerPhiladelphia Judge Patrick Dugan announced his bid to challenge Krasner. Krasner said the basis of local officials’ noncompliance with federal orders is supported by the Anti-Commandeering Doctrine, which is based on the Tenth Amendment and says “the federal government cannot require states or state officials to adopt or enforce federal law,”according to SCOTUSBlog. A memo from Trump’s Acting Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove, published in various news outlets last week, threatened consequences for local officials who do not cooperate with Trump’s plans to crack down on immigration, adding that local officials are legally bound to cooperate with the U.S. Department of Justice based on the Constitution’s supremacy clause. In light of that memo,Krasner said he and his staff would not comply with any immigration orders that break the law. He expressed a similar sentiment Friday, also acknowledging that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement “is going to do what it is legally and constitutionally entitled to do. ”As a law enforcement officer, we would not interfere with that,” Krasner said. But Krasner added that his office will not hold back from prosecuting ICE agents in Philadelphia for doing “criminal things that go beyond their rights.” “Any ICE agent, any Proud Boy who thinks hate crimes are cool, thinks ‘I can get away with anything because there’s a king in D.C.?’ No, you can’t. That’s not how it’s going to work,” Krasner said. “If you are so inclined to break the law to harm immigrants … if you are inclined to use them as your scapegoat, harm them, be cruel to them, you better do it within the law, and if you don’t, try me.”",

        "title": "Philly’s federal workers are worried about job security and government services amid Trump administration shakeups",
        "source": "https://www.inquirer.com/",
        "content": "The Office of Personnel Management's memo giving employees the chance to resign with eight months' pay is leaving workers pondering their job security. When federal workers received a memo from the U.S. government’s human resources agency this week offering the chance to resign with eight months’ pay, some thought it might be spam. “Once you determine whether it’s real or not, it’s kind of like, what is this?” said Philip Glover, national vice president for the American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE) District 3. His union represents about 9,400 federal workers in and near Philadelphia, among some 800,000 across the U.S. and abroad. Ina memo to federal workers Tuesday, the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM)offereda “deferred resignation.” Those who agree, by Feb. 6, to leave their jobswill retain all pay and benefits — and an exemption from Trump-era in-person work mandates — until Sept. 30. Those who pass up the offer do not have“full assurance” that their position or agency will continue to exist, according to the memo. The memo is one in a series of directives under PresidentDonald Trump’s second administration aimed at overhauling federal agencies. Trump signed several executive orders on his first day in office tofreeze hiring, bring federal workers back to in-person work full time, andend diversity, equity, and inclusion programsin federal government. » READ MORE:Donald Trump’s executive orders are likely to have a tangible impact on Philadelphia’s federal workers The Inquirer spoke with union leaders and local federal workers from across several agencies, some on the basis of anonymity due to fear of retaliation in the workplace. Several said Trump’s executive orders and the resignation memo have caused anxiety, distrust in the federal government, and confusion about the future of their jobs. They’re also concerned that essential government services could suffer. Typically, the leaders of federal agencies communicate with their own employees directly. Federal workers receiving an email from OPM was “very odd” said Glover. Some noticed how the memo’s title —Fork in the Road—mimicked the subject line in Elon Musk’s email to Twitter employeeswhenthe billionaire took over. The recent directives jibewith the goals of the “Department of Government Efficiency,”led by Musk, who has been tasked with identifying and eradicating what’s deemed to be wasteful spending, including shrinking the federal workforce. The memo marked a major shift from the federal government’s usual “level of formality,” said Marie Owens Powell, president of AFGE’s Council 238 which represents over 8,500 EPA employees across the country. “Seeing something that’s literally called ‘Fork in the Road’ was not what one would expect, whatsoever,” said Powell. The OPM has said it intends to shrink a majority of federal agencies through “restructurings, realignments, and reductions in force,” according to the offer notice. The memo also says federal workers should be “reliable, loyal, trustworthy” and that “performance standards will be updated to reward and promote those that exceed expectations.” “I don’t feel real good about this loyalty test that they’re pushing forward,” said Glover. The OPM did not respond to a request for comment on the loyalty language and new performance standards. » READ MORE:Who are the Philly region’s federal workers? A look at the employees impacted by Trump’s recent executive orders. A Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA) employee in Philadelphia, who has been a federal worker since 2016, was shocked by OPM’s resignation offer and wondered: “Is my job in jeopardy?” The nine-year federal worker thought she would retire as a federal employee, but has begun to rethink that. She thought government work offered job security, but is less certain now. “What does the future hold for me?” she said. “I don’t know, because it seemed like anything can happen within a week.” Another Philadelphia VBA worker, a five-year employee, said she found the memo’s language troubling. “Our jobs are uncertain because that email reads that you have to be performing at above the exceptional level,” she said. “That would be the norm — for everyone, and that is not realistic.” AFGE’s lawyers are looking into the legality of the offer, said Glover. While it offers to pay workers through September if they accept, federal government spending is currently fundedthrough March 14. OPM regulations typically only allow buyouts of up to $25,000 per person unless Congress makes an exception, noted Glover. The average federal worker makes$106,382 per year, according to OPM data, which is about $71,000 from now to September. Union leaders are skeptical of the offer — two, speaking with The Inquirer, called it a “scam.” The AFGE is urgingcaution to members consideringtheresignation. “There’s not yet any evidence the administration can or will uphold its end of the bargain, that Congress will go along with this unilateral massive restructuring, or that appropriated funds can be used this way, among other issues that have been raised,” an AFGE spokesperson said in a statement. The spokesperson said the union’s locals and councils maydemand to bargain over the program and could filegrievances or unfair labor practice charges alleging the federal government directly communicated with employees, bypassing the unions. Several federal agencies offer hybrid schedules — something workers (and their bosses) have gotten used to. Trump’s executive order mandating a return to full-time in-person work might not be physically possible, workers said. The Northeast Regional Office for the National Park Service, on Market Street in Philadelphia, can only hold about 60 employees, said Dave Fitzpatrick, secretary-treasurer of the AFGE Council 270 and a retired National Park Service maintenance employee in Philadelphia. The parks’ administrative workers would claim desks on a hoteling system that complemented their in-person schedules. “If you needed a desk for a couple of days, you would make a reservation, so now they’re telling all these folks to come back,” Fitzpatrick said. “There’s physically not enough room for them to fit into that space.” At the Philadelphia VBA: “I think we’re going to be squished like a can of sardines,” said the nine-year federal worker. And returning to the office full time could mean an added expense for those who will now need additional help to care for children or other family members, workers said. One Philly VA employee who has worked for the agency for more than 20 years said a flexible work-from-home schedule allowed them to attend medical appointments with their mom, who has been diagnosed with cancer. The employee themself also has a chronic illness, which was slightly easier to manage withtelework. Now, the VA employee said, “I’m gonna have to take a lot more time off in order to accommodate those necessary appointments.” But they want to keep their job, to continue “to help people” rather than “take an easy buyout and give up.” If employees do take the resignation offer, there is no expectation their roles would be filled again, said Powell, who represents EPA workers. “The work that they do would cease to be done,” said Powell. At the EPA that includes responding to emergencies, cleaning up toxic pollution, sampling water, and monitoring air. “When there’s nobody to call, there’s going to be a problem,” she said. “The people that are there to respond to these emergencies, to do these cleanups, to make sure your water is clean or your air is breathable and safe for you and your children are not going to be there.” Ittakes federal workers to process passports, keep airplanes flying, and national parks running, Glover notes. Brad Starnes, president of AFGE’s Local 3631, described OPM’s email as “a rather ominous communication.” Wednesday morning, he got a flood of phone calls and emails from union members he represents, which includes EPA employees in Pennsylvania and Delaware. Workers were “blindsided” and “shocked,” he said. “You cannot just pull people out of an organization that provides the breadth of services that we provide that are truly needed, and expect that … there will not be severe impacts on the American people,” said Starnes. “That’s what scares me. Nothing like this has ever happened. This is new ground.” Independence Hall relies on seasonal staff to keep up with tourists and crowds in the busy summer months, and with the hiring freeze and the “deferred resignation” program, individuals seeking to learn about Philadelphia and U.S. history may be sorely disappointed, said Fitzpatrick, the retired parks employee in Philadelphia. “I don’t know what the summer season is going to look like at Independence, but there’s going to be a lot of people standing outside trying to get on tours that just aren’t going to happen,” he said. The hunger for Philadelphia’s tourist attractions is likely to escalate next year with the celebration of the nation’s 250th anniversary, which city officials are already preparing for. Trump himselfhas called for an extraordinary celebrationin yet another executive order. For one longtime employee with the National Park Service, telling the story of the Declaration of Independence or the Constitution is not only a job — it’s personal. “We are dedicated employees in this park, more so than any park I have ever seen, and we take our jobs seriously because we know that sometimes this is it for these people,” the employee said. “This is the shot of what American history really is.”",

The plane ride home from Japan feels even longer after you lose your world title and taste defeat for the first time as a professional boxer. But it provided Stephen Fulton — the former super bantamweight champion from West Philadelphia — two years ago with the time to reflect. “Having everything and losing it all,” Fulton said, “makes you think about all the things you’ve done in your life and appreciate the things you’ve done and also appreciate yourself more and love yourself more. When I lost the title, I lost family, friends, those things. You have to regroup.” » READ MORE:Do you know these seven all-time Philly boxing greats? Take a look. Fulton was knocked out in Japan by Naoya Inoue in July 2023 and then knocked down a year later in his next fight against Carlos Castro. But he was not ready to fold. Fulton rallied, earned a decision against Castro, and righted his career. On Saturday night, Fulton (22-1, 8 knockouts) has a chance to become a champion again when he meets WBC featherweight champ Brandon Figueroa (25-1-1, 19 KOs) at the T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas. “I learned a lot about myself,” said the 30-year-old Fulton, whose fight is broadcast by Amazon Prime pay-per-view. “No matter what I go through, I feel like I can overcome it.” Figueroa’s only career loss is a decision to Fulton in November 2021. That fight made Fulton a unified champion at 122 pounds and gave him one of the signature wins of his career. Saturday is a rematch at a different weight class as this is Fulton’s second featherweight fight — he moved up to 125 pounds after losing to Inoue. Fulton is also training now with Bozy Ennis, the father of Jaron “Boots” Ennis. Ennis, Hamza Muhammad, and Wahid Rahim share Fulton’s corner. “It’s like the best of both worlds on my behalf,” Fulton said. “Bozy has a different style than maybe Hamza and Wahid might have. So when you combine their styles, it all works out at the end of the tunnel.” It would have been easy for Fulton to fold last September after he touched the canvas in the fifth round, just 14 months removed from a difficult loss. His career was at a crossroads as he returned to his corner. But he was urged to keep pushing, and he did. On Saturday night, Fulton can be champion again. “I might have been knocked down but I’m going to get back up, stay focused, and get the job done,” Fulton said. “People always face adversity in life. It’s all about how you react to it.” » READ MORE:Danny Garcia’s father fought back from a stroke to be in his corner",

Barkley, a member of the New York Giants at the time, harbored a bit of resentment toward the team that knocked his squad out of the playoffs in the divisional round. The star running back watched only part of the Super Bowl that year, as he was on a flight back from Phoenix after participating in the media frenzy that is radio row. “That stuff is fun,” Barkley said on Thursday. “Radio row and all of that. But I like this a little bit better.” » READ MORE:Eagles’ Brandon Graham returns to practice ahead of the Super Bowl as he recovers from triceps injury Next week, Barkley returns to the Super Bowl with a new allegiance and a different agenda. The 27-year-old running back — who will turn 28 on the day of the Super Bowl, Feb. 9 — will be a key part of an Eagles team on a quest to win its second Lombardi Trophy in the last eight seasons. Even though Barkley wasn’t a member of the group that lost to the Kansas City Chiefs in February 2023, he still feels the pain carried by some of his teammates who fell short of the ultimate goal at the time. “I think even though I wasn’t part of that team ... when you’re able to develop a friendship and a relationship with these guys and be able to go to war with each other, it felt like I was,” Barkley said. “I know how, like I wasn’t there, but I can feel in my own body how it felt for them and see the confetti fall in the wrong color and having to walk out. “Definitely don’t want to be part of that. That’s definitely something that drives us. For those guys that have been a part of it, but also just want to get the job done and knowing how it is for those guys, how it felt, and doing everything I can in my ... ability to make sure that doesn’t happen.” After a historic regular season and a dominant postseason, Barkley enters the week of the Super Bowl in rare company. According to the NFL’s Next Gen Stats, Barkley is one of three players all-time to have at least 400 rushing yards in the playoffs before playing in the Super Bowl, joining Hall of Fame running backs John Riggins and Terrell Davis. Both players went on to rush for more than 150 yards in the Super Bowl, and each won the game’s Most Valuable Player award. » READ MORE:The Chiefs are aware of a ‘fully loaded’ Eagles team ahead of Super Bowl LIX Davis set the single-season rushing record(including playoffs) in 1998 as a member of the Denver Broncos when he ran for a total of 2,476 yards. Barkley, sitting at 2,447, needs 30 rushing yards to break Davis’ record. Still, Barkley is more focused on the team’s bigger goal. “The only thing that makes it special, whether we got the rushing record during the season or if we get the all-time rushing record, playoffs included, the only thing that makes it special is winning a Super Bowl,” Barkley said. “This profession that we’re in, this sport that we’re in, there’s a lot of great things that we’ve accomplished so far up to this, but if we don’t get the job done next Sunday, maybe when you’re in your 30s and 40s and you look back at it, you’re going to think about how special it was. But it’s kind of going to make it feel ... like you came up short.” Barkley will make his first Super Bowl appearance in just his second postseason run of his seven-year NFL career. Upon signing his three-year, $37.75 million deal with the Eagles in March, Barkley had the mindset that his new team had the firepower to make it to the NFL’s biggest stage. “I didn’tthinkthat it was possible,” Barkley said. “I kind of knew. You’ve got to envision it. You’ve got to believe it. “Every year, no matter what, you have to come in with that mindset. Because we all have a chance to go out there and accomplish what we want to accomplish. I believed in it.

        "source": "https://www.inquirer.com/",
        "content": "From a five-minute anthem written by Philly ad men to a short and memorable song created by fans, for fans. Other NFL teams have their own version of a fight song to rally their fans together for a big game — from the Buffalo Bills’ “Shout” to the Chicago Bears’ “Bear Down, Chicago Bears.” But let’s be honest, none compares to “Fly, Eagles Fly,” a song that fans have been hearing quite a lot of lately, with the team coming off a 14-3 season and preparing to compete inSuper BowlLIX. If you still don’t know the lyrics behind theEagles’ victory song, it’s time to start learning — it’s short and easy to remember. And if you don’t know the history behind the song that plays after every Birds’ touchdown, don’t worry. Here’s everything you need to know ahead of the Eagles’ Super Bowl rematch against the Chiefs … Before there was the short and sweet “Fly, Eagles Fly” fight song that we know today, there was anearly five-minute versionthat went “Fight, Eagles Fight,” which is still part of the revamped song fans sing today. The five-minute song was created in the 1950s by Philadelphia ad men Charles J. Borrelli and Roger Courtland. In the 1960s, the song was performed by the Eagles’ Sound of Brass, a 200-member marching band, before losing the approval of Eagles fans in the 1980s. In the 1990s, Eagles fan Bobby Mansure helped create the fight song that lives on today — “Fly, Eagles Fly” — by reworking the former 1950s version that the Eagles played before games at Connie Mack Stadium.Mansure met Brian Saunders, and the twoMummersformed a band known as The Fly Guys. It consisted of Mansure as the lead saxophone player, Saunders on the tenor sax, and Anthony DiMeo on the banjo. Together, the group would breathe new life into the future anthem of the Eagles. In 1996, the Eagles hired them to work the parking lots before games and help pump up the crowd. In search of an Eagles-themed song to play for fans, they came across the original version of “The Eagles Victory Song.” The guys decided to up the tempo and coined a new phrase, “Fly, Eagles Fly,” which wasn’t featured in the original song. Soon, they were infiltrating tailgates to teach fans the new fight song. “We handed out pieces of paper to every tailgate we went to,” Mansuretold the Inquirer’s Matt Breen last year. “We sold it to the parking lots. Instead of parading through, we stopped at tailgates and talked to people. We got phone numbers. We just connected with people and soon they were like, ‘Can you show up to our tailgate?’” Eventually, The Fly Guys — now the Eagles’ official pep band — and their revamped fight song became so popular that the team started playing it on the stadium speakers after each touchdown. That tradition continues today, and the song has also become part of the team’s pregame festivities before the national anthem. » READ MORE:Fly, Eagles Fly: How two Mummers gave Philadelphia an anthem In order to complete the song, the group decided to add a chant at the end, the now familiar “E-A-G-L-E-S, Eagles!” chant, which can be heard from the streets of Philadelphia toPhilly-themed sports bars in Tokyo.They invited friends into Saunders’ home studio to make it sound like a crowded stadium, and an anthem was born. “Before that, you were getting more of the ‘Give me an E, give me an A,’ that kind of thing,” Saunders told Breen. “It’s certainly not what it is now. When you have the right amount of syllables and the word ‘Eagles,’ things sometimes just fall together perfectly. Like it belonged there. There was no other way you could end the song. You had to have an ending.” Be sure to check out Breen’s full story on the origin of the fight song,here. In case you need a refresher, here are the full lyrics to “Fly, Eagles Fly” as well as a video of fans singing the song. Fly, Eagles fly! On the road to victory! (Fight! Fight! Fight!) Fight, Eagles fight! Score a touchdown 1, 2, 3! (1! 2! 3!) Hit ‘em low! Hit ‘em high! And watch our Eagles fly! Fly, Eagles fly! On the road to victory! E-A-G-L-E-S! Eagles!",

        "title": "Philly and Delaware skating clubs confirm passengers with local ties among D.C. plane crash victims: ‘We are devastated’",
        "source": "https://www.inquirer.com/",
        "content": "The Philadelphia Skating Club said its community members were part of the deadly D.C. airline crash. It may be days before all the victims are identified, and perhaps weeks or months before the cause of the collision of an American Airlines plane and a U.S. Army helicopter is determined, but for now the only certainty for the region’s figure skating community is an enduring sense of “immense grief.” A number of passengers who were killed in Wednesday night’s tragic crash were part of that tight-knit community, including accomplished skaters, coaches, and family members. The Philadelphia Skating Club & Humane Society and the University of Delaware confirmed that several of the victims had local ties. Three of the victims identified so far were from Delaware. Officials on Thursday confirmed the inevitable: They had abandoned any hope of rescuing the victims in the chilly waters of the Potomac River, where the crash occurred about 9 p.m. Wednesday as the airliner was attempting to land at Reagan National Airport near Washington. The plane was carrying 60 passengers and four crew members. Three soldiers were aboard the helicopter that evidently flew into the plane’s path. As of Thursday night, 28 bodies had been recovered. Sen. Chris Coons (D., Del.) said Thursday night that three of the victims — Sasha Kirsanov, Sean Kay, and Angela Yang — were Delawareans. Kirsanov was a former coach of the University of Delaware Figure Skating Club. In a statement, university president Dennis Assanis said, “We believe two young skaters,” members of the university’s skating club, also were on board. The university did not identify them, but the skating clubposted enthusiastically on social medialast week about Kay and Yang’s forthcoming trip to Kansas — where the American Airlines flight originated — for a national development camp. Assanis said that Kirsanov, who lived in Newark, and the skaters trained at the university’s High Performance Training Center, which “has been the training home for many years of multiple world-class skating champions and competitors.” Kirsanov’s wife, Natalya Gudin, who is also a coach,told ABC News: “I lost everything. I lost my husband. I lost my students. I lost my friends.” She said she last spoke to her husband Wednesday afternoon ahead of the flight’s boarding. Gudin said she learned of the crash from the mother of a figure skater on the flight. “I need my husband back,” she said. “I need his body back.” Coons said on social media: “My heart goes out to Sasha’s wife Natalia [and] the University of Delaware Figure Skating Club.” In his statement, Assanis said: “The figure skating community is tight-knit, and many of our students and coaches have trained and competed alongside those who were lost.” Wichita, Kan., from where the flight departed before heading to Washington, hosted the U.S. Figure Skating Championship last week, along with a training camp that wrapped this week. “These athletes, coaches, and family members were returning home,” U.S. Figure Skatingsaidin a statement Thursday morning. “We are devastated by this unspeakable tragedy and hold the victims’ families closely in our hearts.” In Philadelphia, the skating club — the nation’s oldest — expressed “immense grief at the loss of so many talented skaters, their coaches and families.” The club had not disclosed the names of any local victims as of Thursday night. “Sadly, one of the families lost just became members of our club and another shared his talent with us at our recent 175th Anniversary Gala,” the group said. “We share this loss and grief with the entire USFS Community.” The statement continued: “We are devastated. … Our thoughts and prayers are with everyone during this tragic time.” The Skating Club of Boston said it was grieving the loss of two skaters, their mothers, and two coaches, theBoston Globereported. The coaches, Evgenia Shishkova and Vadim Naumov, were Russianworld champions and a married couple. They won the pairs figure skating event at the 1994 World Championship and had been living in the United States since 1988 after retiring from competitive skating, transitioning into coaching roles. The search for bodies was continuing Thursday night. The tragedyevoked memories of the February 1961 plane crashin which all 18 members of the U.S. world championship figure skating team and 54 other passengers were killed.",

        "title": "Fake ‘ICE Volunteer Corps’ truck stirs fear in Chester County immigrant community",
        "source": "https://www.inquirer.com/",
        "content": "In the Facebook group “¿Qué Pasa, Kennett Square?,” a member of that community posted photos of the vehicle on Jan. 24 with the warning in Spanish that it was “Not ICE.” As Pennsylvania’s immigrant community worries over deportations under the new Trump administration, a vehicle and its driver presenting as a member of “ICE Volunteer Corps” is stirring anxieties inChester County. There is, of course, no such thing as a volunteer division ofImmigrationCustoms and Enforcement, the federal agency the president has tasked to ramp up raids and deport millions of undocumented people in the opening weeks of his second term. But that didn’t stop the driverfrom brandishing the fraudulent ICE stickers on the side and back of a white Jeep this month, one spotted by residents in both West Chester and Kennett Square in recent days — the latter home to thousands of undocumented people who work in the region’s agricultural industry. West Chester University, in a statement sent to the campus community Monday, confirmed that the school had received complaints about the vehicle on its campus. The university confirmed its existence via photos and security footage. “Upon thorough review by the WCU Department of Public Safety, the reported vehicle is not believed to be an official government vehicle,” the statement said. Put more plainly: “We believe that the vehicle’s unofficial signage was meant to create confusion and concern,” the statement continued. Lindsey Sweet, an immigration attorney in Chester County, said she has heard multiple reports of people spotting the vehicle around Kennett Square, the nation’s mushroom-producing capital and home to a growing population of asylum-seeking migrants from countries such as Guatemala, Nicaragua, and Venezuela. According to Sweet, as well as photos viewed by The Inquirer, the vehicle is affixed with what appear to be police lights on top. Sweet said that in addition to the West Chester University sighting, the vehicle had been spotted parked outside aWawastore in the Kennett Square area. “There’s a lot of fear,” Sweet said. “[The Jeep] has really rattled the community, even though it’s a private citizen who has the sticker on their car. It’s caused a lot of fear — unnecessarily.” A spokesperson for ICE in Philadelphia said the agency does not have volunteers but did not return a subsequent request for a statement about the vehicle. An administrative member of the Kennett Square Police Department said that the department did not have knowledge of the vehicle. Meanwhile, members of the Latino community have been quick to take action to dispel fear and rumors. In the Facebook group “¿Qué Pasa, Kennett Square?,” a member of that community posted photos of the vehicle on Jan. 24 with the warning in Spanish that it was “Not ICE.” “We’ve sent the information to the police since it’s illegal what he’s doing,” the user wrote, according to Facebook’s Spanish-to-English translation. “If you see similar cars and you are not sure if they are really ICE, take a picture so you can investigate if they are actually ICE officers.” The post generated a flurry of comments and activity, as users claimed they, too, had spotted the vehicle at Acme, McDonald’s, and other Chester County locations. It is a federal crime to impersonate an ICE officer, and penalties can include fines and imprisonment. West Chester University said its officers were on heightened alert over the vehicle, though security footage did not yield a clear photo of the vehicle’s license plate number. For Sweet, one half of the law firm Sweet & Paciorek, the vehicle incident is just one element of the confusion that has swept her clientele since PresidentDonald Trump’s inauguration this month. Deportations of criminals happened regularly under the Biden administration, though Trump has vowed to ramp up enforcement and overhaul immigration policy to vastly limit the number of migrants in the country. ICE raided a North Philadelphia car washthis week, arresting seven immigrants. Nationally,military cargo planes are being used to fly migrants to Colombia and Border Patrol agents are turning away those who may have previously entered the country and applied for asylum. Sweet said that migrants she works with have varying immigration statuses, though many are asylum-seekers with work authorization who are waiting for immigration court hearings despite a backlog that has led to wait times of up to several years. A major fear among undocumented agricultural workers in Chester County, according to Sweet, is that the Trump administration willexpand its expedited removal policy, meaning those who have yet to have a court hearing could be subject to deportation as they wait to see a judge and make their case for asylum. “There’s a large group of people who are here who are relying on the fact that they’re going to have this court hearing and haven’t done anything about their case yet,” said Sweet, who spent a marathon week advising both nonprofits and individuals about the rights immigrants have during an ICE encounter. “If that court date goes away and they’re now being removed from the United States,” Sweet said, “they’re not prepared for that.”",

        "title": "Philly is down 9 judges, and some officials say the city got snubbed in a deal to fill seats elsewhere",
        "source": "https://www.inquirer.com/",
        "content": "Lawmakers in the state Senate are poised to approve judicial vacancies in 10 counties next week. Philadelphia — which has the most open judicial seats of any county — isn't one of them. Less than a month into the new year, a routine process is causing a squabble in Harrisburg, with some Philadelphia officials expressing frustration over a slate of judges who are set to be appointed next week. The dustup comes after a bipartisan group of lawmakers struck a deal to fill vacancies on courts across 10 Pennsylvania counties. But Philadelphia — which has the largest court system in the state, and where nine judicial seats are empty — isn’t one of them. Several members of Philadelphia’s delegation to Harrisburg are concerned the city was left out of the deal, and the city’s bar association says long vacancies in the Common Pleas Court have had a cascading effect on a stressed system. Seven of the court’s nine open judicial seats have been empty for more than a year. State Sen. Anthony Hardy Williams, a West Philadelphia Democrat who has served in Harrisburg for more than 35 years, said Philadelphia’s exclusion from the slate of appointments sets a precedent that reduces the city’s influence in Harrisburg. He said legislative leaders advanced the slate without input from Philadelphia’s senators. “This was a deal struck without the members of the Philadelphia delegation saying they’re OK with it,” Williams said. “This is an absolute dilution of our Philadelphia delegation’s power. … For us to not be included is an insult.” Other lawmakers said there’s nothing out of the ordinary. The Senate considers slates of judicial appointees on a rolling basis. For example, the state Senate confirmed 10 judges in 2023, five of whom were in Philadelphia. No judges were appointed last year. A spokesperson for Senate Minority Leader Jay Costa (D., Allegheny) declined to comment. State Sen. Nikil Saval, a Democrat who chairs the Philadelphia delegation, said he is hopeful the city’s vacancies will be filled in a future appointment package. Judicial vacancies are nothing new, as judges retire or are appointed to higher courts. To fill open seats outside of election season, Pennsylvania Democratic and Republican leaders typically work with the governor’s office to advance a slate that satisfies both parties. The governor appoints nominees to fill judicial and county row-officevacancies, who then must be approved by a two-thirds vote in the Senate, requiring bipartisan cooperation.(Magisterial district court judges outside Philadelphia require only a majority vote.) An appointed judge fills the remainder of a predecessor’s 10-year term or serves until after the next municipal election, whichever is shorter. In Philadelphia, they make at least $228,400 per year. » READ MORE:Justice delayed: Philly courts’ backlog leaves many jailed for months without a hearing Philadelphia’s Common Pleas Court has the highest number of judicial vacancies of any court system in the state. The court — which is a trial-level court that handles serious crimes,cases involving children and families, and appeals from lower courts — should have 93 judges, but has been operating for months with 84. The Philadelphia Bar Association, which has repeatedly called for lawmakers in Harrisburg to fill the vacancies, said in a statement that additional judges are needed “immediately” to relieve overcrowded schedules. “We simply cannot afford to wait any longer,” said Katayun Jaffari, the chancellor of the Philadelphia Bar Association. “We, again, urge our leaders in Harrisburg and Philadelphia to rise above political concerns and work collaboratively to fill these vacancies.” There are judicial vacancies in other counties, but no other Pennsylvania trial court is as understaffed as Philadelphia’s Common Pleas Court. Allegheny County is down six judges, but the package of appointments legislators are set to consider next weekwould fill three of those seats. Every other county in the state has three or fewer judicial vacancies, according to a list provided by a spokesperson for the state courts system. For Williams, excluding Philadelphia from any deal to fill judicial vacancies is a matter of reducing the city’s influence. He said he expressed his “extreme frustration” to Costa, who told him that Philadelphia was not included in the package because the delegation was not unified behind its nominees to fill the seats. Williams said the discord may have come down to one nominee: Larry Farnese, a former state senator now vying for a judgeship in Philadelphia. Some caucus members expressed discomfort with Farnese’snomination — shades of 2023, when sources saida long-simmering feud with another Philadelphiastate senatortanked Farnese’s chances of being appointedfrom a short list of nominees. Farnese did not respond to a request for comment Thursday. » READ MORE:Philly Democrats’ process of picking ‘magic seat’ judges involved mischief and vengeance this year Despite the internal strife, Williams said the delegation had coalesced around its judicial nominees — including Farnese. He said the group learned the city was left out of the appointment package and submitted a letter to Costa saying its members were in agreement, but by then it was too late, and a deal had already been struck. “This is not just about one judge,” Williams said. “This is about a process and precedent within the caucus. … I’m sounding an alarm because others need to understand if this precedent is established, that means we will go forward with this being normal. And it’s not.”",

As they would later discover, the Kutztown University sophomore had fallen victim to an online sexual-extortion scam by a Nigerian group known as the “Yahoo Boys.” Communicating via Snapchat and Instagram, members of the group posed as a young woman, solicited intimate photos of Sullivan, and then threatened to release them if he didn’t continually send them funds. Sullivan’s death was ruled first a suicide, then a homicide once details of the events leading up to it became clear.

Reporter Abraham Gutman digs into the ongoing debate over the harms of social media use and a Montco family’s quest to keep other young people safe. The Philadelphia region is home to tens of thousands of federal workers in fields ranging from veterans benefits to the National Park Service. On Tuesday, those workers and others across the country received a memo from President Donald Trump’s administration offering them eight months’ pay if they resign by Feb. 6. The directive is part of an effort by the White House to downsize the federal workforce in the name of government efficiency, as well as to ensure employees are “reliable, loyal, trustworthy,” according to the memo. It’s also causing fear that essential services won’t be deployed. “You cannot just pull people out of an organization that provides the breadth of services that we provide that are truly needed, and expect that … there will not be severe impacts on the American people,” a local union rep told The Inquirer.

        "content": "Senate Majority Leader Joe Pittman (R., Indiana) said in an interview earlier this month that Senate Republicans still have reservations about legalizing recreational marijuana. HARRISBURG — Gov.Josh Shapirowill againpitch in his annual budget address next week that Pennsylvania should legalize recreational marijuana andtap into tax revenuelike almost all of its neighboring states. But legalizing recreational marijuana still faces major hurdles in Pennsylvania, where the GOP-controlled state Senate is not sold on the idea. Senate Majority Leader Joe Pittman (R., Indiana) said in an interview earlier this month that SenateRepublicansstill have logistic reservations about marijuana’s federal classification as a Schedule I drug alongside heroin, as well as whether state government could support a recreational program. “It’s a practicality issue more than a philosophical issue,” Pittman said. Meanwhile,Democratslike Shapiro and House Majority Leader Matt Bradford (D., Montgomery) say regulating the adult-use cannabis industry is a no-brainer, when all surrounding states — except West Virginia — are already profiting off Pennsylvanians crossing state lines. “Frankly, we’re losing all kinds of revenue to other states,” Shapiro said in an interview earlier this month. Shapiro proposed a 20% tax on legal marijuana as part of his budget address last year (and the year before). In his 2024 budget pitch, his administration estimated that an adult-use cannabis industry in the statecould bring in $14.8 million in tax revenue in its first yearand would be regulated by the Department of Agriculture. That estimate increased to $76 million in its second year, $160 million in its third, and $230 million in its fourth. Still, some Pennsylvania Republicans seem more open to the cannabis industry after surrounding states,including Ohio, a GOP stronghold, legalized it. And Pennsylvania will need new revenue generators tohelp fill a $4.5 billion budget shortfallas spending is set to outpace revenue beginning this fiscal year and is expected to grow in the coming ones — perhaps increasing lawmakers’ interest in taxing marijuana. » READ MORE:Gov. Josh Shapiro says he ‘got stuff done’ in his first two years. With a budget shortfall on the horizon, his biggest challenges are to come. State Sens. Dan Laughlin (R., Erie) and Sharif Street (D., Philadelphia) introduced a sweeping, bipartisan bill in the last legislative session to legalize and regulate adult-use marijuana. The bill would have set a minimum purchase and use age requirement of 21 years old, created a regulatory board and a cannabis business development fund, strengthened driving-under-the-influence laws for marijuana use, and more. But the bill never came up for a vote. Laughlin has moved into a new leadership role as chairman of the Senate Law and Justice Committee, where a recreational marijuana bill would likely be assigned as the first step of the legislative process. Similar marijuana legalization legislation was introduced in the Democratic-controlled House last session, but it also did not get a vote. But Pittman, the leader of Senate Republicans, still doubts there is widespread support for legalizing recreational marijuana among his caucus — in part, he said, because of the way Pennsylvania implemented its medical marijuana program under former Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf. Pennsylvania legalized medical marijuana in 2016, with dispensaries opening around the state in 2018. But that process was fraught with issues, from weak oversight to unfair application of the law and more. A Spotlight PA investigationfound that a small number of Pennsylvania doctorsapprove most of the state’s medical marijuana cards, among other issues. “Obviously, this state has not done well in rolling out medical marijuana,” Pittman said. “We’ve not demonstrated our ability to have the bureaucracy manage something of that magnitude.” Both Pittman and Bradford said the other chamber should send them a bill to consider. However, Bradford was more confident that his narrow Democratic majority would be able to pass a measure legalizing recreational marijuana, in light of the lack of broad support in the GOP-controlled Senate. “It strikes me as abdicating our responsibility to protect our communities and our children, and at the same time, we are losing revenue that is going to go into our neighboring states,” Bradford said. “Yes, our numbers are close, but we are confident that we can get our numbers together and show that there is a path forward on cannabis.” Dave Sunday, Pennsylvania’s new Republican attorney general, has said he opposes the legalization of adult-use cannabis butsaid that if it is legalized,he would follow state law.",

        "content": "When tight end Chad Lewis went down with an injury during the magical 2004-05 season, Thomason, who played three seasons with the Eagles, got a call he'd never forget. Jeff Thomason was in a work trailer in South Jersey 20 years ago ready to start another Monday morning on a construction site of a new housing development. His phone rang. It was Tom Melvin, anEaglesassistant coach. Thomason played three seasons with the Birds before trading in his helmet for a hard hat. He watched from home the previous night as the Eagles won the NFC title and finally broke through to the Super Bowl. Thomason figured his old coach was calling to thank him for his contributions in prior seasons. Nope. Melvin wanted Thomason to come to South Philly and try out for the Eagles. Chad Lewis, the team’s starting tight end and Thomason’s buddy, broke his foot the night before, catching a touchdown in the team’s 27-10 victory over the Atlanta Falcons. The Birds needed a replacement for the Super Bowl so they called Thomason, then an assistant project manager with Toll Brothers. » READ MORE:Saquon Barkley envisioned being in a position to win a Super Bowl long before wearing Eagles green “It was shocking,” Thomason said. “I kind of thought they were joking with me. Never did I think they would bring me back to play in the game.” Thomason was in. He had retired two years earlier but still missed the game. Of course he would play in the Super Bowl. First, he had to ask his boss. “I was like ‘I’m going to use my two weeks’ vacation, all right?’ He’s like ‘What?’” Thomason said. Thomason aced his tryout and flew to Jacksonville, Fla., in January 2005 with the Eagles. He played tight end and helped on special teams in the Super Bowl moonlighting as a football player on the biggest stage. The Eagles lost to the Patriots, 24-21. It was back to work for Thomason. “It’s a story that needs to be told on TV someday,” said  Thomason, 55 who today lives near Dallas and works in sales. “I didn’t think there was a chance in the world that this guy was ever going to play football again.” Thomason joined the Eagles in 2000, and his first catch with his new team was the touchdown on the opening drive of the Pickle Juice Game, the stunner in Dallas wherethe Andy Reid Era truly took off. Years earlier, Reid rejuvenated Thomason’s career after Green Bay cut him before the 1994 season. Thomason, figuring that football was over, took a job selling shower heads. Reid, then the Packers’ tight ends coach, called and told him to stay in shape,because   the Packers might need him again. Reid called again a year later, and Green Bay signed Thomason. » READ MORE:Moro Ojomo gave ‘Inner Excellence’ to A.J. Brown. The lesser-known Eagle has his own motivational story. “He truly, truly cares about everyone he’s around, so he’s the guy you want to run through a wall for,” Thomason said of Reid,  the Kansas City Chief coach, who opposes the Birds in Super Bowl LIX on Feb. 6. “I could call Andy tomorrow and he’ll pick his phone up and ask how my wife is. He’s just as authentic, as caring, and as real as I’ve ever seen. Everything I do in life, I try to implement that same approach. It makes it real.” Thomason spent a decade in the NFL as a trusty blocker and dependable special teamer who caught 10 touchdowns, all of which ended with him spiking the football and throwing out his arms to make a “T.” “Lord knows I can’t do anything else but stand around. I can’t dance, that’s for sure,” Thomason said. “It had to be something stationary. It had to be something simple. My brother, a long time ago, used to throw the ‘T’ out there, so I did it. The first time I did it, it was more of a ‘Y’ because I was so excited. I slowly got it to ‘T.’” Thomason’s contract with the Eagles ended after the 2002 season, and interest around the league in him was tepid. He accomplished his goal to play 10 seasons, so Thomason walked away after the crushing loss to Tampa Bay in the NFC championship game. » READ MORE:Saquon Barkley took his high school records but gave him a hard-to-top icebreaker He   long had an interest in construction and used some connections to get an entry-level job with Toll Brothers, the home builders based in Fort Washington. Thomason spent six months in the audit department before moving to the trailer, where he made $37,000 and reported to a 25-year-old boss. “It’s hard to walk away from the game,” Thomason said. “It’s your whole life. It’s your whole identity. It’s the only thing I had done since I was 8 years old. You’re really never at peace with it. It’s hard, man. It’s hard to get rid of it. “I knew I could still play but my time in the NFL — it’s Not For Long, obviously — came to an end. But I was never ready to walk away from that. I can tell you that.” Thomason had been away from the team for two seasons, but most of the coaches were the same, the playbook was still fresh in his mind, and the roster was familiar. Thomason had completed triathlons during his retirement and trained in  jujitsu. He was in shape. Everything was in place for him to go from the work site to the Super Bowl. “I just had to make sure my body could move around,” Thomason said. Thomason played in two Super Bowls with the Packers, in the 1996 and 1997 seasons, but his trip with Philly was the first time he had a podium on media day. Thomason spent his career as a backup tight end. For a week, he was the star. Thomason was national news, the feel-good story of the Super Bowl. He was featured onGood Morning America,60 Minutes, and nearly every nightly news broadcast. » READ MORE:Eagles’ Brandon Graham returns to practice ahead of the Super Bowl as he recovers from triceps injury It was special. Thomason made sure to take it all in, knowing this would be his final game. He thought his career ended two years earlier, but instead he got one more night. “The Super Bowl is the greatest thing in the world,” Thomason said. “That opening kickoff, there’s nothing like it with all the flashing lights. I’m so lucky. It was such a blessing. I wish I could’ve helped them win.” The owner of Toll Brothers caught enough grief for making Thomason use his two-week vacation that he announced that any employee who  plays in the Super Bowl, World Series, NBA Finals, or Stanley Cup Finalswould receive an additional two weeks of vacation. Thomason was at ease. Now, he could just play. “It was such a gift,” Thomason said. “I’m so grateful to Andy. I’m so grateful to Tom Melvin. I’m so grateful to the Philadelphia Eagles for giving me that chance. I sat there on that field. It was a loss, and I felt sick to my stomach. But sitting there selfishly and looking at the grass, knowing I’m never going to see that grass again like that. Wearing cleats, shoulder pads, and a helmet. It was pretty crazy.” ",

        "content": "A year after drafting corner Quinyon Mitchell in the first round, the Eagles could tap into Nick Sirianni's connections at Toledo one again. MOBILE, Ala. — A year ago, the Eagles made an initial connection withQuinyon Mitchellat the Senior Bowland the cornerback went on to be their first-round pick in the 2024 NFL draft. Now, a year later, could the Eagles select another defensive player from Toledo in the early rounds this year? Defensive lineman Darius Alexander, the Rockets’ standout player at this year’s Senior Bowl, was difficult to block all week for opposing offensive linemen. At 6-foot-3 and 304 pounds, according to Senior Bowl measurements, Alexander has an explosive first step and strong hand usage to disengage run blocks. In addition to taking snaps as an interior defensive lineman, Alexander showcased an ability to rush the passer as an outside defensive end. One of his best reps of the week came on Thursday during the 11-on-11 team session, beating Oregon left tackle Josh Conerly, one of theearly week standouts, with a double-hand swipe-and-swim move to get into the backfield with what would have been a sack in a live-game situation. » READ MORE:Eagles draft: LSU tight end Mason Taylor could intrigue the Birds after strong Senior Bowl practices “I just see myself as an underdog,” Alexander said after practice. “I just come here, put my head down, and get ready to go to work. I spent time working on my game [and] also getting in the film. … My D-line coach, Frank Okam, he prepared me for moments like this, too.” Toledo coach Jason Candle and Eagles coachNick Sirianniwere teammates and roommates at Division III university Mount Union, and Sirianni coached with current Toledo defensive coordinator Vince Kehres at Mount Union as well. The connections to Siranni’s past surely played a part in the Eagles drafting Mitchell last year and could play a part this year, too, with Alexander. Alexander, from FortWayne, Ind., finished his final college season with 7½ tackles for loss, 3½ sacks, and an interception returned for a touchdown in Toledo’s bowl game victory over Pittsburgh. Alexander says he has been talking to Mitchell “all day, every week” and says playing  with Mitchell on the Eagles “would be great.” “We got great coaches, great staff, great people on campus and then throughout the city of Ohio that motivate us to push us to be great,” Alexander said. “And we just want to come out here and show them that [Toledo] got players that could come out here and compete with the best.” ThoughJalen CarterandJordan Davishave played at a high level, the Eagles could lose defensive tackle Milton Williams to free agency this offseason and could be in the market to add  a player to that mix. The Toledo standout will be in demand this week. After practice, Pittsburgh Steelers assistant general manager Andy Weidl, who previously worked with the Eagles, introduced himself to Alexander and has another meeting planned with him. The Eagles have also met with Alexander this week. » READ MORE:Eagles draft: Offensive tackles Josh Conerly and Emery Jones showcase their potential on Day 1 at the Senior Bowl Alexander is expected to be a Day 2  draft selection, and his performance this week not only strengthened his stock but proved that he can be an every-down player at three-technique, which would replace Williams’ role seamlessly. No one may have made themselves more money this week than Texas A&M edge rusher Shemar Stewart, whose explosiveness at 6-5, 281 pounds, per Senior Bowl measurements, is unmatched by any player who competed at the Senior Bowl. Stewart’s production with the Aggies has been underwhelming (4½ sacks in three seasons), but his traits were on full display during practice this week. Though the Miami native opted not to practice on Day 3 of the Senior Bowl, nor play in the game on Saturday, his best rep came during Wednesday’s session for the American team. On the play, Stewart turned the corner on LSU’s Emery Jones before he could lay a finger on him, then knocked the ball out of Mississippi quarterback Jaxson Dart’s hand. “I’ve been tall, big, all my whole, my whole life, and [living in] South Florida, you had to learn how to move with the best of them. So I feel like that’s where I got my movement skills from,” Stewart said. “During the offseason, I just go and work on seeing the hands. … While I was training with coach Nathan O’Neal, I was working on just seeing the hands, getting my accuracy on hitting hands better.” The other player who generated plenty of buzz this week was Marshall’s Mike Green, a  small-school pass rusher who proved he could back up the production he put out on tape. Green, who finished with 22½ tackles for loss and 17 sacks in a breakout redshirt sophomore season, produced a viral clip on Wednesday when he barreled over Oregon’s Conerly during a one-on-one pass-rushing session. The  native of Williamsburg, Va.,   opted out of Thursday’s practice, like Stewart, but displayed his upside as a run defender this week as well. Green entered the week in the first-round discussion and will leave the week firmly in that range. Though he may not last until the Eagles’ pick late in the first round, Green should be on their radar with Josh Sweat potentially departing in the offseason.",

But of course, that’s relative. They’re affordablecompared to other places. I’ve written about how a lot of homebuyers in our areacan’t comfortably afford the homes for sale. Well, apartment renters are in the same boat. A new Redfin analysis found that, actually, the Philadelphia metro area is one of the least affordable major metros for its renters, based on their incomes. The online real estate brokerage looked specifically at renters living in apartment buildings with five or more units. There’s been a lot of apartment construction across the country and in Philly, which helps to tame rent growth. Still, the typical renter household in the Philly area makes $15,630 less than they need to comfortably afford the typical apartment that was listed for rent last month. Keep reading to see where the Philly region ranks among major metros in rental affordability for residents andhow much renters here need to make to afford apartments. Philly lawmakers will consider two bills that wouldreduce upfront costs for renters. A man who got in trouble for replacing native plants around his Avalon home with sodhas signed a plea agreement. A new $62 million school building isunder construction in Port Richmond. Debris from the construction of a student housing tower fell through theroof of a neighboring West Philly church. Cooper University Health Care in Camden celebrated the start of construction ona $650 million patient tower. The Fashion District was a key piece of the Sixers' now-abandoned plans for a Center City arena. Here’s what Philadelphiansreally think of the mall. A proposed self-storage facility in Northeast Philly will likely be a lot smaller afterneighbors pushed back. House of the week: For $875,000 in Media, a three-bedroomtownhouse near a wildlife preserve. A couple weekends ago, I found myself sitting sweaty on my dirt-covered living room floor after wrestling my spider plant out of its too-small pot and transferring it to a bigger one. I’d known for a while that the plant needed a bigger home, but I kept putting it off. I waited too long, and now I keep having to pull brown leaves off it. Wilfreta Baugh is a much more responsible plant parent. And she’s also got way more house plants than my seven. Her century-old, colonial revival home in Elkins Park is filled with succulents, ferns, roses, sunflowers, and more. And that’s just inside. Baugh says she’s had a “50-year love affair” with creating floral art, and she’s won a bunch of ribbons through the years at the Philadelphia Flower Show. Peek inside her home (where the air quality must be off the charts) and see the flapper costume she made withdried grasses and ferns and twisted vines. A $2 billion project to widen the N.J.

        "title": "‘Fear and anxiety:’ What Trump’s ban on federal support for gender-affirming care means for Philly transgender teens",
        "source": "https://www.inquirer.com/",
        "content": "The order, widely expected to be challenged in court, could block recipients from being able to receive the treatments and have a chilling effect on providers willing to offer care. A few weeks afterDonald Trumpwon the presidential election, Wesley Hiester and his mom went to see Hiester’s doctor to ask about stockpiling a larger supply of testosterone. The 17-year-old, who started hormone therapy when he was a high school freshman, was concerned that there could be restrictions placed on the gender-affirming treatments he received. He wanted to be prepared. This week, Trumpissued an order barring federal funding of gender-affirming carefor people under the age of 19. The executive order directs agencies to cease grants and other funding that could be used for hormone therapy, puberty blockers, or surgeries for transgender children. It also directs the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to review the terms of publicly funded coverage under Medicare, Medicaid, and the Affordable Care Act to curtail gender-affirming care. The order, widely expected to be challenged in court, could prevent those recipients from being able to receive the treatments and have a chilling effect on providers willing to offer gender-affirming care, doctors and legal experts said. “Obviously, going into Trump’s presidency we all knew what his agenda was,” said Hiester, who lives in West Chester. “I wasn’t shocked but the worst is he raised the age to 19, so I have another year to worry about this. I’m a senior. I’m committed to college. I should be enjoying every single moment but now, first with the election and now this, it’s really hard to focus on the good things.” Hiester has private health insurance and believes that for now, he will still have access to his hormone therapy, but he and others in the transgender community are concerned about a cascading effect that could threaten access, depending on how the order is interpreted. And the larger impact, Hiester and others have stressed, is the mental and emotional toll as Trump’s directives pile up. One of Trump’s most vocal promises on the campaign trail was to end gender-affirming care. On his first day in the White House,he declared his administration would recognize only two genders. And a slew of executive orders have targeted transgender people, including a directive thatthe military adopt a policy that being transgender is incompatiblewith “high standards for troop readiness,” and an order dropped Thursday banning “radical gender ideology,” in schools. The order about minor care, titled “Protecting Children From Chemical and Surgical Mutilation,” describes widely medically approved transgender care in inflammatory and misleading language, claiming children are being “maimed” and “sterilized.” While the order suggests this medical treatment is routine,very few minors undergo surgery to affirm genderand a small percentage of the adolescent population seeks gender therapies. Gender-affirming care for children and adolescents has been deemed medically appropriate by the American Academy of Pediatrics and other major medical and mental health organizations. Research shows young people with gender dysphoriasuffer higher ratesof suicide, self-harm, depression, and anxiety. Gender-affirming carebroadly refers tomedical services intended for people whose gender identity does not match the gender they were assigned at birth. Care could range from voice coaching and hair removal to hormone therapy and surgery. Trump’s order specifically applies to chemical (such as hormonal treatments) and surgical therapies. Conservative lawmakers’ defense of gender-affirming care bans often argue some therapies are irreversible and could come with side effects such as the risk of fertility loss. But researchers and medical professionals saymore research needs to be done to confirm the accuracy of any side effects, and LGBTQ advocates note that de-transitioning is extremely rare. “His order has the potential of making gender-affirming care very difficult, if not impossible, to get even for adults and more specifically for adults who are financially or otherwise already underserved and already marginalized,” said Shanin Gross, a family medicine doctor in South Jersey who specializes in gender-affirming care. In Pennsylvania and New Jersey, clinics, hospitals, and organizations that serve transgenderand nonbinary people urged calm. The action is likely to face challenges while they aretrying to sort out what its implementation could mean for their work. A primary concern is that medical institutions that receive federal funding for research or education grants that also provide care to transgender youth could lose funding. Gross, a 55-year-old doctor fromCherry Hill, worries that the order’s restrictions on Medicaid and Medicare could discourage doctors from providing gender-related care through these government-funded programs providing health coverage for low-income children and families, people with disabilities, and seniors. Gross also fearsthe order could trigger sanctions that would prevent a doctor from participating in Medicaid or Medicare. “I think that the goal behind the whole executive order and the intentionally broad and vague way it is written is to frighten as many health systems and individual providers as possible into thinking that they will lose funding or otherwise be unable to conduct business,” Gross said. “And the implication of the government officials with no medical training controlling what medical treatments we are allowed to have is terrifying and something we all should want to avoid.” The order could further restrict access to treatments that can already be difficult to get for minors in the U.S. Twenty-six states have restricted youth access to gender-affirming care, which remains legal in Pennsylvania and New Jersey. “Clearly the intent of the executive order is to create a climate of fear and anxiety that will result in care deprivation,” said Harper Seldin, an attorney with the ACLU. Sultan Shakir, president and executive officer of the Mazzoni Center — Philadelphia’s biggest LGBTQ health agency — denounced the action, stressing that “transgender people of all ages” are “entitled to the care and opportunities that others take for granted to live lives recognized as their full selves.” TheCenter Citynonprofit provides medical care for transgender individuals including hormone therapy. The Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia runs one of the nation’s largest clinics providing medical care and mental health support for transgender and gender nonbinary children and teens and their families. The hospital’sGender & Sexuality Development Programwas founded in 2014. In 2021, more than 800 new families sought care — a record surge from the prior year when between 250 to 350 families received services,according to CHOP. Trump’s order directs the head of HHS to take all appropriate steps to end gender-affirming care, including scrutinizing Medicare or Medicaid “conditions of participation or conditions for coverage” and “clinical abuse or inappropriate use” of state Medicaid programs. It’s not clear what the impact on CHOP could be. CHOP said in a statement Thursday that its “top priority is always the safety and well-being of the patient families we treat, ensuring that each child has a chance for a healthy future, while complying with applicable laws and directives. We look forward to continuing to work closely with our partners in government to make sure that the needs of children and their families come first.” For several transgender individuals and their parents interviewed, the worry is that therapies and support groups they depend on could shutter. Joanne, 52, of Center City, is concerned that her daughter, who has been on a two-year waitlist for surgery, could have to wait even longer. The Inquirer isn’t printing Joanne’s last name to protect her daughter, who she fears will face public backlash. The mother said she’s looked into surgery in Thailand but worries about the language barrier. As her daughter starts looking at schools, she’s urged her to apply to universities in Canada. “I’m at the point where I don’t think we can beat them anymore so I don’t know how much I can try, and I’m certainly not going to join them, so the third option is to run away,” she said. Gender-affirming care is expensive, something parents who’ve gone through the process worried about this week. Dawn Bowman, whose 20-year-old son is transgender, said her family sold a life insurance policy to help pay for therapies when he was in his teens. “At a point, I realized this is a life or death thing,” she said. “What really gets lost in this discussion is that when these kids go through the wrong puberty, they self-harm. It’s OK to not understand things but to demonize people because you don’t understand them, and say they’re you’re to help them, you’re actually hurting them.” As Trump ends just his second week in office, Hiester is trying to focus on school, playing tennis, and his job as a lifeguard. In the fall, he’ll head to college in Washington, D.C., where he wants to study education to become a high school teacher. He’s inspired by teachers who supported him over a tough last four years. “The larger impact of all this, is just how much hatred there is…that can have such an effect on, especially, younger trans people,” Hiester said. “People who are just trying to live their lives and be a kid.” Staff writer Harold Brubaker contributed to this article.",

But Kuzemko hasn't come anywhere near replicating that league-best 27.3% shooting percentage the past two seasons. An unrestricted free agent at season's end, Kuzmenko appears to have a 29-game tryout to show chemistry with Michkov and rediscover his scoring touch.

Frost, 25, will get a fresh start in Calgary, which could do wonders for his confidence and allow him to play more freely.

        "content": "Ahead of the March launch of Smith's first album in 20 years, 'Based on a True Story,' the actor is 'flying as an Eagle, fresh out of Philly.' Big Willie is back on the scene. Oscar-winning actor Will Smith is releasing his first album in two decades,Based on a True Story, in March. His latest track, “Beautiful Scars,” proves the Fresh Prince still has it. The West Philly native, 56, weaves in an Eagles tribute on the OmArr and LeXoskleteon-produced track. “Fly as an Eagle, fresh out of Philly. Yeah, I still rep the city. Mirrors on the wall, worth half a billi,” Smith raps in a video he posted on social media on Tuesday. “Beautiful Scars” explores the perils of fame, the journey of self-acceptance, and the lessons learned through hardship. The song is accompanied by a music video inspired by the Keanu Reeves sci-fi classic,The Matrix. The video starts off with scenes from a2019 video, where Smith described his regretful decision to pass on the role of Neo to play Captain James West in the box office flop,Wild Wild West. “It’s one of those stories I’m not proud of, but it’s the truth. I did turn down Neo inThe Matrix. I’m not proud of it.” With rapper Big Sean playing a Morpheus-like role, he asks Smith to make the ultimate decision: blue pill or red pill. “Blue pill, everything remains the same and you get to move on with your life. Red pill, you get to go back and star in that movie that got away. The choice is yours,” he raps. “I really like my life right now,” Smith replies. Caught between the two options, Smith opts to live on in this AI-run world, maintaining the life he’s led with no regrets — Chris Rock slap and all. The rest of the video, directed by Adil El Arbi and Bilall Fallah (Bad Boys: Ride of Die), switches between re-imagined scenes from the film, and behind-the-scenes footage of the music video. The six-minute video closes with a cryptic message from the simulation: “Wake up, Will. The matrix has you.” Through it all, Smith has remained loyal to Philly sports. At the 40th Grammy Awards, he accepted hisBest Rap Solo Performance awardfor “Men in Black” wearing a Phillies cap and jersey. More recently, ahead of the Eagles’ Week 13 matchup against the Baltimore Ravens, he posted a video reaffirming his family’s fandom. A post shared by Will Smith (@willsmith) “This is a sensitive situation for our family, and we goin’ keep it real simple today,” Smith said as he panned the camera to a small group. “The first thing we want to know is, ‘Where’s Philly at?’.” The caption for the video, which the Eagles team later reposted, included the very fight song Smith referenced on his new track. “On game day, it’s FLY EAGLES FLY in this household 🦅😂🦅. Philly vs Bmore today!!,” Smith wrote.",

        "content": "Before dating Travis Kelce, the Berks County native was an Eagles fan. Now, she’s a Chiefs fan — and that likely isn’t changing before the Super Bowl. Taylor Swiftis now the world’s most famous Chiefs fan, thanks to her high-profile relationship with tight end Travis Kelce. But before she became a staple at Arrowhead Stadium, Swift was a Birds fan from Berks County. Swift and Kelce’s storybegan in 2023after Kelce attended her Eras Tour show at Arrowhead Stadium,armed with a friendship braceletwith his phone number on it — that he didn’t get to give her because “she doesn’t meet people before or after her shows.” There’s photo evidence of her meeting Aaron Rodgers after one of her shows at MetLife Stadium, so that’s notquitetrue. And onNew Heights,Jason Kelcespeculated Swift rebuffed him because the Chiefs had just beaten the Eagles in theSuper Bowl. ”She probably just hasn’t gotten over the Super Bowl yet,” Jason said. “She’s a big Eagles fan.” Despite her fandom, the relationship continued to grow withsurprise appearances at Chiefs games,Kelce family vacations, and even Travisappearing on stage at one of her shows. But at some point, that fandom changed. » READ MORE:From Bradley Cooper to Taylor Swift: Who has the better Super Bowl fan base? A totally unbiased (not really) take. At an earlier tour stop at Lincoln Financial Field, Swift confirmed she was a Birds fan and had included a reference to the team in her song “Gold Rush” — “Eagles T-shirt hanging from the door.” “There was sort of a — I don’t know how large the debate was — the debate about I have a lyric that says, ‘my Eagles T-shirt hanging from the door,’” Swiftsaid of the song while performing the Eras Tourat Lincoln Financial Field. “I saw some people wondering if it was the band, the Eagles, or the team, the Eagles. Guys, come on. I’m from Philly, of course it’s the team.” She was spotted entering her New York recording studio, Electric Lady Studios, in an Eagles crew neck in 2023, so the Birds fandom is recent. At least until her relationship with Kelce began later that year. Swift also met Andy Reid years prior, when he was still with the Eagles. “Yeah, listen, she’s been great. I knew her before, from Philadelphia. Her dad played at [the University of] Delaware and was a big football fan and good guy,” Reidsaid on theLet’s Gopodcast in 2024. “So I had met him there and her. … That was the last thing Trav wanted to hear, that I knew her before him.

        "content": "Burks was called into action for the 49ers in Super Bowl LVIII when Dre Greenlaw went down with an injury. This time Burks is filling in for Nakobe Dean. The next-man-up mentality is part of the ethos of the sport. For Oren Burks, it is more than just part of football, it is pretty much his entire seven-year NFL career. Burks has never been a full-time starter. He’s a special teams ace, a leader in the locker room, and a hole filler whose number only gets called when someone else goes down. From special teamer to starting in theSuper Bowl, it’s been an interesting first season with the Eagles for the 29-year-old linebacker, but it’s not an entirely new experience. Rewind to last February, when Burks was the third linebacker with the San Francisco 49ers. He played 34% of the defensive snaps during the regular season, by far the most in his career. He played 20 snaps in San Francisco’s first playoff game and 16 in a conference championship victory over the Detroit Lions. He was going to have a similar role in the Super Bowl, but then Dre Greenlaw suffered a freak Achilles injury running onto the field in the second quarter. » READ MORE:Eagles’ Brandon Graham returns to practice Burks was next in line. He played 71 snaps, his second-highest total in an NFL game, and he struggled. The Kansas City Chiefs targeted Burks nine times in coverage and completed t all nine passes, including one for a touchdown. It was one of Burks’ worst games by Pro Football Focus grading in his career as the Chiefs won, 25-22, in overtime. One year later, Burks is in a similar spot, though it’s far from the same. Nakobe Dean’s season-ending injury occurred during the wild-card win over Green Bay and Burks has been starting ever since. His play has gotten better, too. Burks had one of the best games of his career during the Eagles’ 55-23 NFC championship victory over Washington. He recorded nine tackles, including a sack and a forced fumble. This from a guy who missed so much of training camp with a knee injury that his roster spot wasn’t a guarantee. The Eagles brought him in on a one-year deal to provide some depth at linebacker, but he barely got on the field in camp. He was initially cut before being named to the practice squad and then receiving a promotion to the 53-man roster. “I had one or two practices and then the last preseason game and that was my resumé,” Burks said. “I really just believed in this locker room and wanted to be here and wanted to prove that I should be here. “That’s been my whole career, just trying to find a way to add value. And that’s whether it’s on [special] teams, whether it’s on defense, being a great locker room guy, being a great leader, just embracing that.” Burks, of course, isn’t happy how his opportunity happened. Burks started in Week 17 when Dean had an abdominal injury and then again in Week 18 when the Eagles rested their starters. But Burks  expected to be back on the bench as Dean returned for  the playoffs. The Eagles have a deep and talented roster, but linebacker was a big question mark entering the 2024 season. Dean had yet to excel, Zack Baun was an unknown, Burks was a special teams ace, Devin White looked good at times in camp but didn’t earn a job, and Jeremiah Trotter Jr. was a fifth-round draft pick. Linebacker, however, has turned into a strength. Dean emerged as a key player after missing most of 2023 with an injury, and Baun, initially signed as a potential rotational edge rusher, turned into an All-Pro off-ball linebacker.Vic Fangiohas gotten a lot out of the group, and he’s getting a lot out of Burks now, too. But even before Burks’ number was called as a starter, he started the playoffs with a pop, forcing a fumble on the opening kickoff of the wild-card game against the Packers. “The season has a lot of ebbs and flows, but this is the big one that you’ve been preparing for your whole life,” Burks said. Dean is still part of all this, Burks said. He’s out in California rehabbing after surgery to repair a torn patellar tendon in his knee, but his smiling face was seen on FaceTime after the game Sunday, and Burks said he was looking forward to seeing Dean in New Orleans. “He’s just as much a part of that win as any of us,” Burks said. » READ MORE:Meet the Moms: Inside the ‘sisterhood’ that supports the rise of the Eagles’ homegrown Philly Dawgs defense As for how he’s able to help some of the guys who weren’t in the locker room for a Super Bowl vs. the Chiefs, Burks said he made sure to let Baun know how crazy things would be once they left Philadelphia and arrived in New Orleans. On the field, Burks knows how good of a route-runner Travis Kelce is and how difficult the Chiefs will make things on the Eagles defense. And that Mahomes guy? “Don’t give him too much time at the end,” Burks said. “That’s one of the big things, a common theme. He’s a hell of a quarterback. He comes through in those clutch moments.”",

        "content": "Antonio Merlo previously worked at the University of Pennsylvania Drexel Universityhas tapped an Italian-born political economist who formerly worked at the University of Pennsylvania and currently serves as a dean at New York University as its next president. Antonio Merlo, 61, dean of the faculty of the College of Arts & Science, will replace interim president Denis P. O’Brien on July 1. O’Brien became leader of the 22,100-student West Philadelphia university in September afterJohn A. Fry, who led Drexel for 14 years, was named president ofTemple University. Merlo, who spent 14 years as a scholar and leader at Penn, where he also coachedmen’s water poloand led the team tothree championship titlesin the Mid Atlantic Division of the Collegiate Water Polo Association, was chosen following the work of a search committee including trustees, faculty members, students and administrators that lasted just under six months. » READ MORE:Drexel will trim senior leaders’ salaries, slash retirement benefits, and consider layoffs in the face of its $63 million operating loss “Dr. Merlo is the ideal leader to uphold Drexel’s values and guide the university into its next chapter,” Richard Greenawalt, outgoing chair of Drexel’s board of trustees said in a statement. “His commitment to academic entrepreneurship and his proven success in bringing together faculty, students, scholars, and practitioners to address critical societal challenges are particularly vital as we move forward with strategic institutional priorities, including an academic transformation already underway, and focus on building long-term financial resilience.” Merlo comes as Drexel, along with many other colleges, continues to cope with financial challenges as the college-going pool declines, faith in higher education wanes, and competition increases. In September, the schoolasked several deansto step down as part of consolidating two colleges and one of its schools into a new entity. It’s part of a larger academic restructuring, which also includes plans to move from a quarter system to a semester system over the next few years. Later that fall, college leaders announced the school had experienced a 15% decline in first-year students and a $63 million operating loss. In November, Drexellaid off 60 employees, and another 155, or 3.6% of the workforce, opted for a voluntary retirement incentive program. » READ MORE:Drexel lays off 60 employees The school at that time said it wasaiming to come upwith $150 million through cuts and revenue increases to regain a positive operating margin by 2027. It already had identified much of those cuts; some of the work may now fall to Merlo. “I am absolutely thrilled to be asked to lead this institution, which I have admired from a distance for some time,” Merlo said in a 20-minute interview, shortly after the board approved his hire. He cited the college’s co-op program that places students in paid work experiences as part of their core learning and the school’s willingness to adapt to changing conditions. “I consider myself an academic entrepreneur,” he said. “I see myself as such in every leadership role I’ve had. This just feels like such a fantastic fit.” At NYU,Merlo prioritized fundraisingand “right-sizing staff,” Drexel said, noting that NYU’s Arts & Science school raised its most amount of money ever in 2024. Right-sizing, Merlo said, means trying to allocate the right talent to the right task and re-targeting resources to where they are most needed. “I’m an economist,” he said, “so I understand very well that concept that we maximize our objective functions subject to the constraints we face.” Drexel, like most private colleges, declined to release Merlo’s salary, which will eventually become available through public tax forms. His predecessor, Fry, earned $2.2 million in total compensation in 2022, with a base salary of more than $886,000. Merlo’s initial focus will be making sure Drexel’s projects, including its academic structural changes, get completed and that “we land the plane in the best possible way,” he said. » READ MORE:Salus president was surprised by merger partner Drexel’s financial woes: ‘We’re not happy about it’ Merlo isn’t the first president born outside the U.S. to lead Drexel. The lateConstantine “Taki” Papadakis, who served as president from 1995 until his death in 2009, was born in Greece. Papadakis oversaw a major expansion of Drexel, transforming it from a struggling engineering school to a strong institution with a law school and medical school. Born in a small town outside of Milan, he grew up in a working-class family and was a first-generation college student whose father, now, 95, “still wonders when I’m going to get a real job,” Merlo said. He began playing water polo at age 12, and it grew into a passion, he said during a 2020 interview on a sports program. He got his undergraduate degree in economics and social sciences from Bocconi University in Italy in 1987, came to the United States in 1988, and earned his doctorate in economics from NYU. He started his career as an assistant professor at the University of Minnesota in 1992 and worked there for six years before returning to NYU as an associate professor of economics. In 2000, he joined Penn where he worked for 14 years, serving as an economics professor, chair of the department and director of the Penn Institute for Economic Research. In 2009, he received the Lindback Foundation Award for Distinguished Teaching. In hiring Merlo in 2000, a Penn deandescribed himas one of the leading experts in the nation on the political economy, according to The Daily Pennsylvanian. In a 2013 story by the student newspaper, he was described as “gregarious, articulate, passionate and intense,” in regard to his coaching. » READ MORE:As Drexel undergoes a presidential transition, its leaders outline plans and problems to overcome He joined Rice University in 2014 where he was an economics professor and chaired the department, later becoming dean of its school of social sciences. There, he also worked with government agencies and nonprofit groups to set up a public policy research institute, according to Drexel. Since 2019, he’s served as dean of NYU’s largest academic unit, overseeing three schools, as well as departments, research centers, institutes and language and cultural houses. During his tenure, five new centers fostering cross-disciplinary work have been started, as well as an office of research. His research has explored the economic impact of public policy and he has written about how the economy affects voting and crime and “the career decisions of politicians.” Merlo also coached water polo at Rice and NYU, in addition to Penn, and three times has been named coach of the year. Merlo said he learned important lessons from coaching that he has applied to every leadership he’s had: “Coaches don’t win championships. Teams win championships. The job of the coach is just to put together the best possible team and then guide them through and help them achieve their full potential. “And you need the right team. How do you motivate and inspire people in doing their particular role on a team? ...How do you make this a fulfilling and inspirational mission for each member of your team? That’s when magic happens.” In addition to water polo, Merlo said he also enjoys the opera and cooking: “Risotto is my absolute specialty.” Mike Lawrie, incoming board of trustees’ chair who led the search committee, called Merlo “a rising star in higher education. He has championed new initiatives and taken on leadership roles at every institution that he has served, while endearing himself to students, faculty and staff along the way.” Lawrie, who is founder and CEO of the Lawrie Group, a consulting and management firm, and founder, chair andCEO of TLG Acquisition One Corp., will replace Greenawalt as board chair, the school announced.

Bankrupt Prospect Medical Holdings announced Friday that it intends to sell bankrupt Crozer Health to a “not-for-profit consortium of health-care operators,” with state involvement in its plan,but state officials from the attorney general and the governor’s office monitoring the bankruptcy did not immediately confirm that a deal had been reached. The announcement did not name the health-care operators who would participate in the consortium. Prospect, which filed for bankruptcy Jan. 11, has been negotiating with representatives of Gov.Josh Shapiro’s administration and the state attorney general to transfer Crozer to a new nonprofit. State officials have been involved because the state has been working for more than a year keep the hospitals open. Prospect said in an emergency sale motion Friday that an agreement was reached “merely hours” before “the potentially unavoidable decision to shut hospital doors and begin turning away patients” would have been made. “The proposed sale remains subject to definitive documentation,” Prospect said. If an agreement is reached, a bankruptcy hearing would be held Thursday to seek emergency approval of the sale. At the opening bankruptcy hearing Jan. 14, Prospect’s lawyer made clear that one of the company’s top priorities in the bankruptcy was unloading Crozer, which has a $130 million operating last year, according to the lawyer. The lawyer, Thomas R. Calfano, of Sidley Austin, predicted that the company would soon be back with an emergency motion to sell Crozer — or close it. This is a developing story and will be updated.",

        "source": "https://6abc.com/",
        "content": "Tariffson goods fromMexicoand Canada that are set to take effect could hike the price of a gallon of gasoline for some drivers by as much as 70 cents and send grocery bills climbing, experts told ABC News. The Trump administration this week reiterated plans to slap 25% tariffs on all products from Canada and Mexico on Feb. 1. Those countries make up two of the three largest U.S. trading partners, government data shows. Tariffs of this magnitude would likely increase prices paid by U.S. shoppers, since importers typically pass along a share of the cost of those higher taxes to consumers, experts said. The policy could raise prices for an array of products ranging from tomatoes to tequila to auto parts. The scary thing is the list of products is very, very long, said Jason Miller, a professor of supply-chain management at Michigan State University. The price impact remains unclear, however, since businesses within the supply chain could opt to take on some or all of the tax burden, some experts added, noting the tariffs may not take effect at all since Trump has previously used them as a source of leverage in international negotiations. In response to ABC News' request for comment, a White House spokesperson touted Trump's previous economic policies, including tariffs. In his first administration, President Trump instituted an America First economic agenda of tariffs, tax cuts, deregulation, and an unleashing of American energy that resulted in historic job, wage, and investment growth with no inflation. In his second administration, President Trump will again use tariffs to level the playing field and usher in a new era of growth and prosperity for American industry and workers,\" White House spokesperson Kush Desai told ABC News. Here's what to know about which products could see price increases as result of the tariffs, according to experts: Mexico and Canada account for 70% of U.S. crude oil imports, which make up a key input for the nations gasoline supply, according to theU.S. Energy Information Administration, a government agency. Those imports come primarily from Canada, which sends crude oil to U.S. refineries built specifically to process the crude and redistribute it as car-ready gasoline, Timothy Fitzgerald, a professor of business economics at the University of Tennessee who studies the petroleum industry, told ABC News. Gasoline that originates as Canadian crude reaches customers in the upper Midwest as well as some along the East and West coasts, Fitzgerald said. For those drivers, he added, prices could rise between 40 and 70 cents per gallon of gasoline. You could definitely be looking at 50 cent-a-gallon increases in a lot of parts of the country, Fitzgerald added, noting that the effects would be limited to the regions that rely on imported crude. The tariff-related price increase may combine with a seasonal price hike set to take effect within weeks, since demand for gas typically grows as travel picks up in the warmer spring weather, experts said. That seasonal price impact could add another 30 cents per gallon, putting the total increase in gasoline prices at $1 per gallon if the tariffs remain in place at the onset of spring, Fitzgerald said. The U.S. imported $38.5 billion in agricultural goods from Mexico in 2023, making it the top recipient of such products,U.S Department of Agriculturedata showed. Those imports include more than $3 billion worth of fresh fruits and vegetables. Mexican imports account for a large share of some fruits and vegetables routinely eaten by Americans. Roughly 90% of avocados eaten in the U.S. last year originated in Mexico, USDA data showed. Other products with a high concentration of Mexican imports include tomatoes, cucumbers, bell peppers, jalapenos, limes and mangos, Miller said. It would be difficult for the U.S. to replace those goods with domestic production or an alternative supplier, making it likely that prices would rise significantly if the tariffs take effect, he added. Youd certainly expect to see an impact on prices, Miller said. The U.S. also imports large quantities of beer, tequila and other alcoholic beverages from Mexico, experts said. In 2022, the U.S. imported about $26 billion worth of alcoholic drinks from Mexico, according to theUSDA. Dont forget all that beer we import from Mexico, Miller said. Carmakers and consumers depend on the auto industrys deep ties to Canada and Mexico, making tariffs a threat to prices, experts said. Mexico and Canada make up the top two U.S. trading partners for both finished motor vehicles and car parts, according to aCato Instituteanalysis of data from the U.S. International Trade Commission. In 2023, Canada and Mexico accounted for nearly $120 billion worth of U.S. motor vehicle imports, which totaled about 47% of all such vehicles imported that year. Canada and Mexico made up nearly the same share of auto parts imports that year, the Cato Institute analysis showed. The operations of auto companies on both sides of the border will be hugely affected by these tariffs, Robert Lawrence, a professor of trade and investment at Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government, told ABC News.",

        "content": "Fifteen years ago, Miriam Helmick was sentenced to life without parole for the murder of her second husband, Colorado businessman Alan Helmick. She currently sits behind bars at the Colorado Womens Correctional Facility serving a prison sentence for a crime she says she did not commit. Now, Miriam Helmick is speaking publicly for the first time since her conviction, offering details about her relationship with Alan and the events of the fateful day when he died. It won't be over for anybody until it's over for me, and I do have hopes, Helmick said. I know that I didn't kill him. Helmick spoke with ABC News' John Quiñones in a prison interview for a new 20/20 airing Friday, January 31, at 9 p.m. ET on ABC, and streaming the next day on Hulu. The couple's story began on the dance floor. Miriam, a dance instructor, taught Alan ballroom dancing and their friendship blossomed into romance. Their nuptials were a second marriage for them both, and they had dreams of sharing a life together. Miriam describes Alan as a very kind, very sweet man. She said he was funny and well liked in the community. He always had your best interest at heart usually, Miriam Helmick said about Alan. Their dreams came to a sudden and tragic end on June 10, 2008. Miriam said she was running errands that morning and planned to meet Alan for lunch. When she couldnt reach him by phone, she told police she returned to their Whitewater, Colorado, home and found her husband lying in a pool of blood. The house appeared ransacked, and Miriam frantically called 911. Robin Martin, an investigator with the Mesa County Sheriffs Office who worked on the case, remembered how the first officers who arrived on the scene said they found Miriam distraught and kneeling over her husband. Alan was on the floor in the kitchen, Martin said. It looked like he had been shot in the head. We had a bullet casing next to his body. Police found no one else in the house. As they conducted a sweep of the home, they noticed drawers pulled out in the kitchen and a trash can tipped over in Alans office. Investigators followed routine protocol to thoroughly review the spouses whereabouts. They tested Miriam for gunshot residue and swabbed her clothes for blood. Those tests came back negative. She even showed police all the printed receipts from where she was shopping that day. \"She actually went from one end of the valley to the other end, Mesa County Prosecutor Rich Tuttle said. We were able to track her movements not only by her receipts, but by her cellphone interacting with cellphone towers. Miriam also told police about a shocking incident that happened just six weeks earlier. Miriam said that someone had attempted to blow up Alans car. The couple had been in nearby Delta, Colorado, when Miriam went to the restroom and came back to see Alans car on fire. A wick was found in the gas tank. He came in saying that his car was on fire, and he asked me to get water, and that's all I know about it from there, Miriam Helmick told 20/20. When investigators in Delta asked Alan if Miriam could have been the one to start the fire, Alan insisted she would not have done that and asked that police stop the investigation. Oh God. No, I don't think that, Alan Helmick is heard on a recording of the police interview about the fire incident in Delta, Colorado. Why would she do that? In her 20/20 interview, Miriam Helmick suggested that Alan might have started the fire himself. She said that he could have been trying to collect insurance money. The thing about Alan (was) if he had thought I had done it, he'd have helped me pack a bag, put me on I-70, Helmick said. According to Miriam, Alan told her the investigation was done and that was the last they spoke of it. As days passed with no suspects in custody for Alan's murder, Miriam Helmick said she became convinced she was being watched, reporting that weird things were happening around her house. Then weeks after Alans death, Miriam said she found a disturbing card on her doorstep with a message inside that said, Allen[sic]was first, your[sic]next. Run, run, run! It was a mysterious note that made Miriams friends worry for her safety and that she may be the next target. Miriam calls me and shes frantic, Jeri Yarbrough recalled of the incident with her friend. She goes, What should I do? And I said, Well, you need to hang up the phone and call the police and get out of there. I said, because somebody could be there trying to hurt you. When Martin investigated the card, she said she was shocked by what she tracked down. The surveillance video from the store where the card was purchased showed it was Miriam Helmick who bought that greeting card. It was her. She was wearing the same style of shirt that she had walked in with her[police]interview, Martin said. In her interview with ABC News Correspondent John Quiñones, Helmick claimed that she saw suspicious cars driving around her property in the time after Alans death and that she felt police were not taking it seriously. She said she wrote the card herself in the hopes that police would up their investigation. \"Maybe it was a really bad decision, Miriam said, but at the same time, I thought they would come out and actually look to see who this person was because it didn't seem to be care very much about my safety at that point, and they hadn't told me that I was a person of interest. Prosecutors said Miriam alone was responsible for Alans death. Six months after the murder, Miriam was charged with first-degree murder, attempted murder for the car fire incident and several counts of forgery. Prosecutors claimed Miriams motive for murder was money. There were suspicious bank account activity where it appeared that Miriam had forged multiple checks from Alan's account, Tuttle said. All told, she had taken about $40,000 out of his account through writing those checks. Miriam told Quiñones that Alan knew that she was writing those checks. She said that they owned a dance studio and a horse farm together and Miriam was responsible for payroll and other business expenses. In December 2009, a jury found Miriam Helmick guilty of first-degree murder in the death of Alan Helmick. She was also convicted of attempted first-degree murder for the car fire and multiple forgery counts. She was sentenced to life in prison plus 78 years. Tuttle told Quiñones he thinks the jury got it right. I think there's no way that Miriam Helmick should ever be free in society again. So, life in prison without the possibility of parole, it's the only sentence that serves justice, Tuttle said. From prison, Miriam said she is determined to clear her name and will not stop until she is successful. I know that I didn't kill him, Helmick said. I don't care about anybody else's opinion. What I want more than anything is to prove that. Miriam Helmick has filed numerous appeals with the courts. They have all been rejected. When it comes to Alans family and friends, there are some things that they would rather forget, they told \"20/20.\" I try not to think about the murder. I more like to think about the fun times that we had with Alan. Those are good memories, Ed Benson said of his friend. Alans friends prefer to remember him as someone who was a lot of fun. \"He was the kind of guy you could meet and have a drink with and have a good laugh, Alans friend, Bob Cucchetti, said.",

        "title": "FDA approves painkiller designed to eliminate the risk of addiction",
        "source": "https://6abc.com/",
        "content": "WASHINGTON --Federal officials on Thursday approved a new type of pain pill designed to eliminate the risks of addiction and overdose associated with opioid medications like Vicodin and OxyContin. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration said it approved Vertex Pharmaceuticals' Journavx for short-term pain that often follows surgery or injuries. It's the first new pharmaceutical approach to treating pain in more than 20 years, offering an alternative to both opioids and over-the-counter medications like ibuprofen and acetaminophen. But the medication's modest effectiveness and lengthy development process underscore the challenges of finding new ways to manage pain. Studies in more than 870 patients with acute pain due to foot and abdominal surgeries showed Vertex's drug provided more relief than a dummy pill but didn't outperform a common opioid-acetaminophen combination pill. \"It's not a slam dunk on effectiveness,\" said Michael Schuh of the Mayo Clinic, a pharmacist and pain medicine expert who was not involved in the research. \"But it is a slam dunk in that it's a very different pathway and mechanism of action. So, I think that shows a lot promise.\" The new drug will carry a list price of $15.50 per pill, making it many times more expensive than comparable opioids, which are often available as generics for $1 or less. Vertex began researching the drug in the 2000s, when overdoses were rocketing upward, principally driven by mass prescribing of opioid painkillers for common ailments like arthritis and back pain. Prescriptions have fallen sharply in the last decade and the current wave of the opioid epidemic is mainly due to illicit fentanyl, not pharmaceutical medicines. Opioids reduce pain by binding to receptors in the brain that receive nerve signals from different parts of the body. Those chemical interactions also give rise to opioids' addictive effects. Vertex's drug works differently, blocking proteins that trigger pain signals that are later sent to the brain. \"In trying to develop medicines that don't have the addictive risks of opioid medicines, a key factor is working to block pain signaling before it gets to the brain,\" Vertex's Dr. David Altshuler, told The Associated Press last year. Commonly reported side effects with the drug were nausea, constipation, itching, rash and headache. \"The new medication has side effect profiles that are inherently, not only different, but don't involve the risk of substance abuse and other key side effects associated with opioids,\" said Dr. Charles Argoff of the Albany Medical Center, who consulted for Vertex on the drug's development. The initial concept to focus on pain-signaling proteins came out of research involving people with a rare hereditary condition that causes insensitivity to pain. Vertex has attracted interest from Wall Street for its ambitious drug pipeline that involves winning FDA approval for multiple drugs across several forms of chronic pain, which generally represents a bigger financial opportunity than acute pain. But the Boston drugmaker's share price plummeted in December when Vertex reported disappointing mid-stage results in a study of patients with chronic nerve pain affecting the lower back and legs. The drug didn't perform significantly better than placebo, the research found. \"We believe the data reflect a near worst-case scenario for this key pipeline program,\" biotechnology analyst Brian Abrahams said in a research note to investors, adding that the results jeopardized estimates that Vertex's pipeline could be worth billions across multiple forms of pain. Still, Vertex executives said they plan to move forward with a new, late-stage study of the drug, theorizing that a different trial design could yield better results and pave the way for FDA approval in chronic pain.",

        "content": "An American Airlines regional jet went down in the Potomac River near Reagan National Airport. WASHINGTON --Recovery efforts were ongoing Friday morning following the nation's first major commercial airline crash since 2009. Crews are now awaiting heavy machinery, including cranes, from the Army Corps of Engineers, Coast Guard and private contractors before they can extract additional collision victims, sources familiar with the operation told ABC News. The hope is the equipment will be in position to begin raising pieces of the fuselage as soon as Friday but the operation is expected to last at least through the weekend. Dive teams ceased operations on the Potomac on Thursday after recovering all of the bodies they were able to without moving the fuselage, according to two sources familiar with the operations. On Wednesday night, a regional American Airlines passenger jet and a Black Hawk military helicopter collided over Washington, D.C. The flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorder -- known as black boxes -- from the American Airlines plane have been recovered and are at a National Transportation Safety Board lab. DC PLANE CRASH:A timeline of the deadly collision 41 bodies have been recovered and 28 of those victims have been positively identified, Washington, D.C., Fire and EMS Chief John Donnelly Sr. said at a news conference Friday. Next of kin notifications had been made to 18 families as of 6 a.m. Friday, he said. All 67 people on board the plane and the helicopter were killed in the Wednesday night crash. Donnelly said crews expect to recover all of the bodies. It appears crews will need to remove the plane fuselage from the river to recover the remaining victims, he said. Salvage work on removing aircraft from the water will start as early as Saturday, he said. Fire and EMS has received 911 calls from people who spotted debris in the water; body parts have not been recovered from those 911 calls, he added. Additional bodies and human remains will need to be extracted from the wreckage once it is lifted to the surface of the river. Crews are bracing for the possibility some of the victims will not be recovered because of the fireball that resulted from the collision, the sources said. The Federal Aviation Administration is not giving permission for low-altitude helicopter routes around Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport, the FAA told ABC News. It's unclear how long this will last. Helicopters can still fly into and out of the airport, but are restricted from flying specific river routes. PresidentDonald Trumpsaid there were no survivors from the crash in remarks Thursday morning, calling the crash a \"tragedy of terrible proportions.\" \"Our hearts are shattered,\" Trump said in a press briefing at the White House, after holding a moment of silence. \"Our prayers are with you now and in the days to come.\" \"We are all searching for answers,\" Trump said, adding, \"We do not know what led to this crash\" but have \"some pretty good ideas.\" The NTSB has said their preliminary report into what caused the crash will take approximately 30 days and that it will take \"a year or more\" to get a final probable cause. Todd Inman, a member of the National Transportation Safety Board, appeared on \"Good Morning America\" on Friday, saying that the NTSB \"will be on scene here doing all the recovery of the perishable evidence we need for as long as it takes.\" \"The preliminary report, we believe, will be out in 30 days but in case of these major investigations, it will take a year, if not more, for us to come to a final probable cause,\" Inman continued. \"The most important thing is, the work doesn't just end then. We make recommendations so that we don't have tragedies like this again in the future.\" Inman said the NTSB has started the process of extracting data from the voice recorder. \"The data recorder itself has thousands of data points and they all have to be synchronized against a lot of other things that happened in the plane,\" Inman said. \"The voice recorders have to be what is called 'auditioned' among a number of people so that there's complete agreement of how the transcript will come out. We also look for ancillary noises. Maybe a boom or thud or crack or something in the cockpit. Those things are going on concurrently, along with the fact we have several hundred people in the field looking at every other aspect of this investigation.\" Inman also said that it is way too early to make any conclusions about what exactly caused the crash. \"The only conclusion I know is last night we met with several hundred family members who lost their loved ones in the Potomac,\" he said. \"We don't need that to happen anymore. We're going to work. We're going to continue. We're going find out what happened and we're going try to stop it from happening again.\" DC PLANE CRASH VICTIMS:What we know about those on AA Flight 5342, Army Black Hawk American Airlines CEO Robert Isom remains in Washington, D.C., on Thursday to support the families and help authorities. \"Out of respect for the families, we are not sharing the names of the two pilots and two flight attendants at this time, but our thoughts and prayers go out to their loved ones,\" Isom said. The Black Hawk helicopter, which had three soldiers on board, carries a black box with a voice and flight data recorder. Authorities were still looking for the helicopter's black box recorder, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said Friday on Fox News Channel. Other factors in the crash, including the helicopter's altitude and whether the crew was using its night vision goggles, are still under investigation, Hegseth said. \"It was a fairly experienced crew that was doing a required annual night evaluation,\" Hegseth said Thursday. \"They did have night vision goggles.\" Jimmie Cummings, a spokesman for the Army's Combat Readiness Center at Fort Novosel, Alabama, said that just like all soldiers who must meet regular qualifications for their weapons, Army aviators have to meet annual qualifications, regardless of their flight experience. For aviators, that means flying under different conditions, which could mean flying in daytime or nighttime. It was based at Fort Belvoir, Virginia, according to an Army official. \"We are working with local officials and will provide additional information once it becomes available,\" the official said. On Wednesday at Reagan Airport, a supervisor made the decision to combine two controller positions into one position. This decision was made 40 minutes earlier than normal because the supervisor determined that the traffic was low enough to combine, according to a source with direct knowledge. This position handles local arrivals into Reagan and helicopter traffic when it's combined. This happens routinely when aircraft volume goes down. Reagan is not understaffed, the source added. The air traffic controllers' union said in a statement that it's working with all federal agencies and \"stands with the highly trained, highly skilled\" workforce that \"keeps the United States as the gold standard for aviation safety.\"",

He's seen a lot of metal coming through his scrap metal operation over the years. The Atco, New Jersey salvage operation has been in his family since World War II, operating mainly during the week as a scrap metal operation recycling center. In the 80s, his grandparents built up a wide collection of military surplus aircraft and parts. Piles and piles of metal, scrap, vintage cars, schools buses, and old military aircraft are precariously strewn about the yard making for a unique and foreboding backdrop. So much kept piling up, that when a production crew for Eddie and Cruiser's accidentally drove by the yard they immediately fell in love with the setting. They filmed most of the movie's climax there and cemented Wade's as a Hollywood destination for an awesome ready-made movie set. \"They got permission from my grandparents at the time to film here. They came back, built the set and were filming for a whole week. In the film, they're here for 10 minutes,\" Sharp remembers. The family kept their connections with the movie studios and since then they've played host to a variety of filming locations looking for the perfect post-apocalyptic setting. And they've provided movies with plenty of props and items too. \"We have a good relationship with set decorators. They're looking for this or that for their show, I'll look for it and we'll send it out.\" They've had many productions come out to shoot at the yard over the years such as Eddie and the Cruisers in 1983, Amazon's Fallout series released in 2024, and Apple Studio's Wolfs starring Brad Pitt and George Clooney coming out in 2024. And they've offered props to productions like Blacklist (2019-2023), The Walking Dead-Dead City (2023), Severance (2023, 2024) and Only Murders in the Building (2024). \"I watch TV with my wife, I can point out my props when I see them on the screen. I'll say that's mine, that's mine, that's ours! She hates watching TV with me,\" Sharp laughs. Sharp says they host photo shoots there too. Plenty of cosplayers and folks looking to spark their imagination with an unforgettable background love taking pictures amidst the towering piles of trash and metal relics.

        "source": "https://6abc.com/",
        "content": "The repealed regulation keeping teens from buying guns originated in 1968. A federal appeals court on Thursday struck down a longstanding federal ban that prevented the sale of handguns to Americans between the ages of 18 and 20 - a landmark gun control regulation in place since 1968. The conservative Fifth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals ruled that the federal law banning handgun sales to teens is inconsistent with the nation's historical tradition and violates the Second Amendment. The decision cited the Supreme Court's 2022 opinion by Clarence Thomas in New York State Rifle and Pistol Association v. Bruen, which significantly expanded gun rights and threatens to rollback other gun safety laws nationwide. \"Ultimately, the text of the Second Amendment includes eighteen-to-twenty-year-old individuals among 'the people' whose right to keep and bear arms is protected,\" the court wrote in its opinion statement. The statement went on, \"The federal government has presented scant evidence that eighteen-to-twenty-year-olds firearm rights during the founding-era were restricted in a similar manner to the contemporary federal handgun purchase ban, and its 19th century evidence 'cannot provide much insight into the meaning of the Second Amendment when it contradicts earlier evidence.'\" The immediate nationwide impact of the ruling is unclear. The case is almost certainly bound for the Supreme Court. Handguns have been the most commonly used weapons in murders and mass shootings for decades in the United States, according to government data analyzed by The Violence Project. Last term, the Supreme Court upheld a longstanding federal law prohibiting the possession of firearms by people under domestic violence restraining orders. In the next few weeks, it will consider whether gun manufacturers can be held liable for violent crimes perpetrated by criminals who easily get the weapons.",

He and his siblings had grown up working in theirfather'slandscape business.  Though Justin loved it, he he went to work in the restaurant industry as an adult, but soon found hemissedworking outdoors.  So he cashed out his retirement savings, bought some tools and hired some workers. He started out of his mother's garage in Lansdowne, mowing lawns for 8-10 customers. As business grew, his brother, Dylan, came on board, and so did Melissa Blake. She is his lead designer, business development officer and wife.  The two met working in that restaurant but she had a background in landscaping, with a degree from Penn State University and experience working at a tree care company. Justin's sister, Cailee works for the business too and so does Melissa's sister.

He produces all products from the hive, from an assortment of honeys to beeswax candles, including his most unusual offering from a hive that smelled like maple bacon.  Lab tests at Penn State University determined the honey was being made with the help of the spotted lantern flies which had attacked the trees giving the bees access to the sap.  He tested the honey out at a cheese and honey pairing at the Free Library and says it was the hit of the night. Don manages about 150 hives in neighborhoods around the city with the zip code on top of his jar indicating the bee's foraging grounds.

Flight 5342 and the U.S. Army Black Hawk helicoptercollided just before 9 p.m. Wednesday. Wreckage from the crash fell into the Potomac River where recovery operations continue. There were 60 passengers and four crew members on board the plane and three soldiers on the helicopter. No survivors are expected. Here's what we know about the connections to the Philadelphia region so far: The wife of skating coach Alexandr \"Sasha\" Kirsanov, 46, confirmed to ABC News her husband was on the plane. Natalya Gudin said Kirsanov was with two youth ice skaters on board the flight. \"I lost everything. I lost my husband. I lost my students. I lost my friends,\" Gudin said. Gudin, who also coaches students with her husband in Delaware, said she stayed home to be with their other skaters. \"We are husband and wife,\" Gudin said. \"We decided who's going, who's staying home,\" she said. \"We decided he would go to the development camp.\" Two young skaters, Sean Kay and Angela Yang, who had ties to the University of Delaware Figure Skating Club, were also among those killed, according to U.S. Senator Chris Coons. \"I'm devastated to hear the news that at least three Delawareans died during last night's air collision. Sasha Kirsanov, Sean Kay, and Angela Yang went to Wichita to pursue their passion for figure skating,\" Coons said in a statement. Last week, thethe club postedabout Kay and Yang before their trip to Wichita. \"It is a tragedy that none of them returned home to our state. Delaware is a state of neighbors, and tonight we hold all of our neighbors a little closer. My heart goes out to Sasha's wife Natalia, the University of Delaware Figure Skating Club, and every other Delawarean touched by the three of them,\" added Coons. RELATED:'Hearts are heavy': 14 figure skaters among victims of DC plane crash Gudin last spoke with her husband as he boarded the flight on Wednesday, she said. \"I need my husband back,\" Gudin said as she waited at a hotel for further information from authorities. \"I need his body back.\" University of Delaware President Dr. Dennis Assanis released a statement on the tragedy saying, \"The figure skating community is tight-knit, and many of our students and coaches have trained and competed alongside those who were lost.\" \"Our hearts go out to the families and friends of all of the victims of this horrific tragedy,\" he added. The Philadelphia Skating Clubposted a statement on social mediaThursday saying the victims include \"beloved members\" of the club. \"Everyone is trying to rally around each other, especially for those who were really close to the ones that were lost,\" said Regina Barr, the director and skating coach of the club, which is located in Ardmore. She said one of their newest members, who joined the club just a few weeks ago, was among those killed. Action News has confirmed that the skater was Alydia Livingston who had recently partnered with a local skater in our area. \"He's been a long-time skater here and we were very proud of the new ice dance team,\" Barr said. In a prepared statement, the Ice Works Skating Club in Aston, Pa. said some of the victims on the plane skated at the club. \"Even though many of these skaters were not club members at our rink, they all spent time training here and competing in our events,\" said Lisa Shaw, the skating director at IceWorks.",

Troopers surrounded Brian and Elizabeth DiBiasi's home in Hamilton Township, Mercer County before they were arrested on Wednesday. Attorney General Matthew Platkin said the husband and wife are charged in connection with creating, producing and distributing images of child sexual abuse. Records show Brian, 39, has worked with the Hamilton Township Police Department for 21 years and Elizabeth, 42, has been employed by the Mercer County Sheriff's Office for 18 years. On Tuesday, Platkin said investigators received a tip that Brian allegedly distributed multiple files online showing nude images of his wife in the presence of children. He's also accused of mentioning children being present while he and his wife had sex. \"Sexual offenses against children are among the most serious crimes we charge,\" said Platkin. \"It's especially disturbing when, as in this case, the accused are members of law enforcement.\" Some residents told us they were concerned because there are many children in the neighborhood. \"People look like normal people and sometimes they're monsters underneath and that's scary,\" said Hart. Mayor Jeff Martin and Chief of Police Ken DeBoskey said in a joint statement, \"Hamilton Township has zero tolerance for crimes of this nature. We remain fully committed to upholding the highest standards of integrity and accountability within our community and our police department.\" Mercer County Sheriff Jack Kemler said, \"As the Mercer County Sheriff and a community leader, know that I have zero tolerance for (alleged) immoral acts in our community and within our ranks. Like many employers, we cannot control how people behave outside of the workplace and at home.\" Both suspects are being held in Monmouth County Jail. The sheriff's office said Elizabeth DiBias is suspended without pay as police continue to investigate. The Hamilton Police Division said Brian DiBias is being suspended without pay and served with a notice of termination. Platkin said Brian is charged with causing or permitting a child to engage in a sexual act that may be photographed, filmed or reproduced (1st degree), engaging in sexual conduct that would debauch the morals of a child (2nd degree); possessing fewer than 1,000 images of child sexual abuse (3rd degree); distributing images of child sexual abuse (2nd degree); and possessing images of child sexual abuse with the intent to distribute (2nd degree). Elizabeth is charged with engaging in sexual conduct that would debauch the morals of a child (2nd degree).",

PHILADELPHIA-A national tragedy is hitting close to home for a local ice skating club as they mourn the devastating loss of fellow athletes, along with their own members, who were all on their way home from doing what they loved when the unthinkable happened. What we know: All 67 people aboard the American Airlines jet and Army helicopter are feared dead in what is likely the worst U.S. aviation disaster in almost 24 years, officials said Thursday. In a statement to FOX 29, the Philadelphia Ice Skating Club and Humane Society said that \"beloved\" members were among those killed when anAmerican Airlines plane collided with an Army helicopternear Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport Wednesday night: \"The Philadelphia Skating Club and Humane Society is devastated to learn of the crash in Washington D.C. that took the lives of several members of the figure skating community, including beloved members of our club. We feel immense grief at the loss of so many talented skaters, their coaches and families. Sadly, one of the families lost just became members of our club and another shared his talent with us at our recent 175th Anniversary Gala. We share this loss and grief with the entire USFS Community. Our thoughts and prayers are with everyone during this tragic time.\" Meanwhile, three other individuals in the Delaware figure skating community were named as victims of the doomed flight. Delaware Senator Chris Coons stated a former coach at the University of Delaware Figure Skating Club, Alexandr \"Sasha\" Kirsanov, a fixture at the High Performance Training Center on the university's campus was traveling with two young skaters, ice dance partners Angela Yang and Sean Kay. The local figure skating community is mourning the loss of a number of members of the US Figure Skating with local connections, including three from Delaware. What we don't know: The identities of those members lost by the Philadelphia Ice Skating Club and Humane Society have yet to be released. The club says they will not be releasing any additional information at this time as we await updates from US Figure Skating.

The backstory: There were60 passengers and four crew membersaboard the American Airlines flight and three people aboard the Black Hawk at the time of the crash.

In Aston, Delaware County, Lisa Shaw has 25 years of history at IceWorks. She's currently the Skating Director and President of the club. She read a brief statement to FOX 29, but would not comment further. \"The figure skating community is a small, tight-knit group, and even though many of these skaters were not club members at our rink, they all spent time training here and competing in our events,\" she said. Other ice skating clubs across the Delaware Valley have offered their condolences following the tragic loss felt by their entire community. \"This is a very difficult time for us right now since we have lost so many close friends in this tragedy… we do share our prayers for the families that have been affected,\" said Yulia, coach of Mt.

PHILADELPHIA-While admitting Philadelphia public schools have a long way to go, Superintendent Tony Watlington sees important improvements in student performance. He answered questions from FOX 29 in advance of his celebratory State of the Schools address. What they're saying: \"We are really excited. We think when all the data is verified across the country, we’ll be declared one of the fastest improving, large school districts in the country,\" said Watlington. That has been Tony Watlington’s goal since the day he took control of Philadelphia schools. In a State of the Schools message, Watlington said, \"more students are coming to school and staying. Reading and math scores are up in grades 3rd through 8th. And the dropout rate is down by 14 hundred.\" Watlington reports, \"the School District of Philadelphia, the nation’s 8th largest, has increased enrollment by 1,841 students. That says to me parents and the community have greater confidence in the school district.\" The superintendent believes challenges remain, including no improvements in algebra, a coming plan to close schools and grinding poverty. In his third year of a five-year contract, he said, \"I believe poverty provides a level of significant challenge. As a child of poverty myself, I know firsthand the power of a highly qualified, well-supported, stable teacher.\" The district’s four and a half billion-dollar budget will see an infusion of more than two hundred thirty million in new state money, the result of a successful lawsuit claiming unequal state funding and more city dollars as well. Watlington said with the increased funding he plans to, \"double down on what’s working. High impact, high dosage tutoring, doubling down on professional development supporting teachers.\" The superintendent has a challenging teachers’ union contract to help negotiate in the fall and plans to stay put. \"I intend to be here as long as the mayor and board will have me. I’m absolutely committed to Philadelphia, yes,\" said Watlington. The Source:The information in this story is from The School District of Philadelphia Superintendent Tony Watlington.

WASHINGTON-Afederal judge temporarily blockedPresident Donald Trump's attempt to pause funding for federal grants and loans while his administration conducts a review aimed at eliminating progressive initiatives. But are food stamps (SNAP), Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid safe? Here’s the latest on the funding freeze: The administrative stay, prompted by a lawsuit brought by nonprofit groups, lasts until Monday and applies only to existing programs. FILE - \"SNAP/EBT Food Stamp Benefits Accepted\" is displayed on a screen inside a Family Dollar Stores Inc. store in Chicago, Illinois, U.S., on March 3, 2020.

These include: Food Stamps (SNAP)Student LoansSocial SecurityMedicareMedicaidFunds for Small BusinessesFarmersPell GrantsHead StartRental Assistance A White House directive to pause federal grants and loans raised uncertainty and fears among many who depend on federal aid before a judge intervened Tuesday to temporarily block it from taking effect. Officials said new administrations must review federal programs \" to ensure that they are being executed in accordance with the law and the new President’s policies.\" Dig deeper: Here's more In implementing President Trump’s Executive Orders,OMB issued guidancerequesting that agencies temporarily pause, to the extent permitted by law, grant, loan or federal financial assistance programs that are implicated by the President’s Executive Orders. Any program not implicated by the President’s Executive Orders is not subject to the pause. The Executive Orders listed in the guidance are: Protecting the American People Against Invasion Reevaluating and Realigning United States Foreign Aid Putting America First in International Environmental Agreements Unleashing American Energy Ending Radical and Wasteful Government DEI Programs and Preferencing Defending Women from Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government Enforcing the Hyde Amendment Any program that provides direct benefits to individuals is not subject to the pause. The guidance establishes a process for agencies to work with OMB to determine quickly whether any program is inconsistent with the President’s Executive Orders. A pause could be as short as day. In fact, OMB has worked with agencies and has already approved many programs to continue even before the pause has gone into effect. Any payment required by law to be paid will be paid without interruption or delay. Q: Is this a freeze on all Federal financial assistance? A: No, the pause does not apply across-the-board. It is expressly limited to programs, projects, and activities implicated by the President’s Executive Orders, such as ending DEI, the green new deal, and funding nongovernmental organizations that undermine the national interest. Q: Is this a freeze on benefits to Americans like SNAP or student loans? A: No, any program that provides direct benefits to Americans is explicitly excluded from the pause and exempted from this review process. In addition to Social Security and Medicare, already explicitly excluded in the guidance, mandatory programs like Medicaid and SNAP will continue without pause. Funds for small businesses, farmers, Pell grants, Head Start, rental assistance, and other similar programs will not be paused. If agencies are concerned that these programs may implicate the President’s Executive Orders, they should consult OMB to begin to unwind these objectionable policies without a pause in the payments. Q: Is the pause of federal financial assistance an impoundment? A: No, it is not an impoundment under the Impoundment Control Act. It is a temporary pause to give agencies time to ensure that financial assistance conforms to the policies set out in the President’s Executive Orders, to the extent permitted by law. Temporary pauses are a necessary part of program implementation that have been ordered by past presidents to ensure that programs are being executed and funds spent in accordance with a new President’s policies and do not constitute impoundments. Q: Why was this pause necessary? A: To act as faithful stewards of taxpayer money, new administrations must review federal programs to ensure that they are being executed in accordance with the law and the new President’s policies.

LOS ANGELES-Dick Button, a two-time Olympic gold medalist and one of the most influential figures in figure skating history, has died at the age of 95. His son, Edward Button, confirmed his passing on Thursday but did not provide a cause. Button’s impact on the sport spanned decades, from his groundbreaking performances in the 1940s and 1950s to his later role as a commentator who helped shape figure skating’s popularity worldwide. The backstory: Button won back-to-back Olympic gold medals in 1948 and 1952, making history as the first U.S. figure skater to reach the top of the podium. He was a dominant force in men’s figure skating, capturing five consecutive world championships and revolutionizing the sport with technical innovations. He was the first skater to land a double axel in competition and the first to perform a triple jump—the triple loop—setting a new standard for athleticism on the ice. Following his competitive career, Button transitioned to broadcasting, where he became the most recognized and respected voice in figure skating commentary. His detailed analysis, knowledge of the sport, and signature style helped bring figure skating to a broader audience. Button’s legacy extends beyond competition and broadcasting—he was instrumental in shaping the modern landscape of figure skating. Fellow Olympic champion Scott Hamilton called him \"one of the most important figures in our sport.\" The Source:This report is based on an Associated Press article and confirmations from The New York Times and The Washington Post, citing Button’s son and daughter.

        "content": "Share Former NJ Sen. Bob Menendez has been sentenced to 11 years in prison after being convicted of abusing a Senate committee leadership position. FOX 5 NY’s Morgan McKay has the latest. NEW YORK-Former New Jersey SenatorBob Menendezhas been sentenced to 11 years in prison after being convicted last year of 16 counts of bribery, extortion, conspiracy and obstruction of justice charges. The sentence caps a remarkable downfall for Menendez, who was convicted last July of enriching himself through a variety of corrupt acts. Prosecutors said that in exchange for the gold, thousands of dollars in cash and a luxury car, the Democrat tried to protect associates from criminal investigations, met with Egyptian intelligence officials and took steps to help that country access to millions of dollars in U.S. military aid. Earlier Wednesday, Judge Sidney H. Stein also sentenced two New Jersey businessmen convicted of paying bribes. Menendez, 71, has promised to appeal. This is a breaking news update. Stay with FOX 5 NY as this story develops. Prosecutors had said thatMenendezshould have been imprisoned for 15 years, calling it an \"extraordinary attempt, at the highest levels of the Legislative Branch, to corrupt the nation’s core sovereign powers over foreign relations.\" Lawyers for the former Senator are urging the judge to be lenient, saying the ordeal has made him a \"national punchline\" despite a lifetime of good deeds that have saved lives. The backstory: Menendez wasconvicted in Julyon corruption charges after an FBI raid in 2022 uncovered $150,000 in gold bars and $480,000 in cash at his home. Prosecutors say the money came from bribes by three New Jersey businessmen seeking his influence to protect their interests and profit. A defense lawyer for Sen. Bob Menendez has tried to convince a New York jury that there's nothing to the federal government's bribery case against the Democrat. When he was charged in fall 2023, Menendez was chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. He was forced out of that position in 2023 and gave up his Senate seat in August. In arguments last week, defense lawyers called for Judge Sidney H. Stein to be lenient with Menendez, saying his conviction had \"rendered him a national punchline and stripped him of every conceivable personal, professional, and financial benefit.\" \"Bob is deserving of mercy because of the penalties already imposed, his age, and the lack of a compelling need to impose a custodial sentence,\" the lawyers said. Dig deeper: Two businessmen, Wael Hana and Fred Daibes, were convicted alongside Menendez, while a third pleaded guilty and testified at the trial in July. Prosecutors are seeking a prison sentence of at least 10 years for Hana and nine years for Daibes, saying the crimes took place between 2018 and 2022. \"The defendants’ crimes amount to an extraordinary attempt, at the highest levels of the Legislative Branch, to corrupt the nation’s core sovereign powers over foreign relations and law enforcement,\" prosecutors wrote.

        "content": "Authorities say that a person of interest in the deaths of a man and woman in Pennsylvania purchased a gun that was later used in a shooting that claimed the life of a border patrol agent. PHILADELPHIA-The case of a Delaware County couple killed in their home in late 2022 is now linked to the line-of-duty shooting death of a border patrol agent in Vermont, officials said. Pennsylvania State Police made the announcement Wednesday. What we know: Officials with Pennsylvania State Police said a United States Customs and Border Patrol Agent was killed in-the-line-duty on January 20th, 2025, in Vermont, near a Canadian border crossing in Coventry, about 20 miles from the border. The agent was attempting to conduct a vehicle stop with 21-year-old Washington state resident Teresa Youngblut and German citizen Felix Bauckholt in the car when the gunfire was exchanged. The two had been under surveillance several days. Bauckholt was killed in the gunfire, along with 44-year-old Border Patrol Agent David Maland. Related A United States Border Patrol agent was shot and killed in Vermont on Monday, according to The Department of Homeland Security. Youngblut is in custody facing weapons charges. The investigation of the murdered agent revealed the gun used was purchased by a person of interest in the double homicide of Rita and Richard Zajko. Authorities have since identified that person of interest as 32-year-old Michelle J. Zajko. Zajko allegedly bought two handguns in February 2024 that were used in the shooting that killedU.S. Border Patrol AgentDavid \"Chris\" Maland. The backstory: Pennsylvania State Police were called to a house on Highland Drive, in Chester Heights, on January 2, 2023, for a welfare check. When they arrived, they found 72-year-old Richard Zajko and his 69-year-old wife, Rita, dead, inside the home. During the investigation, it was determined the couple was killed in the home on December 31, 2022. The case has remained active with the PSP Media, Criminal Investigation Unit ever since. Related Weeks after the couple was found dead, Pennsylvania State Police troopers announced their beliefs that the double homicide was not a random act of violence. Dig deeper: In a motion filed Monday, U.S. Attorney Michael Drescher said Youngblut should be detained as the case proceeds due to the nature of the crime, the weight of evidence against her, her lack of ties to Vermont, and the danger she poses to the community. According to the motion, the gun used by Youngblut and one that Bauckholt was carrying were purchased by a third person in Vermont last February. The buyer is a person of interest in the double homicide of the Zajkos. And both Youngblut and the buyer \"are acquainted with and have been in frequent contact with\" someone who was detained during that investigation and who also is a person of interest in a homicide investigation in Vallejo, California, the motion said. What's next: The Pennsylvania State Police is requesting anyone with information regarding the investigations to contact PSP Tips at 1-800-4PA-TIPS (8477) oronline at their tip website, here. Individuals can also contact their local Pennsylvania State Police station, Criminal Investigation Unit.

        "content": "ARLINGTON, Va.-A midair collision between an Army helicopter and a passenger jet killed all 67 people aboard the two aircraft, officials said, as they search for answers in the nation's deadliest aviation disaster in nearly 25 years. At least 41 bodies have been recovered from the icy waters of the Potomac River after the helicopter reportedly crossed into the path of an American Airlines jet late Wednesday. The incident occurred as the jet was landing at Ronald Reagan National Airport, located just outside Washington, D.C. Federal investigators have cautioned that determining the cause of the crash could take months, and they refrained from speculating during a press briefing. Here is what we know about the collision: 2:30pm: Fire Chief John Donnelly and VP of Reagan National Airport Terry Liercke give an update on the DCA plane crash. D.C. Fire and EMS alongside the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority provided an update on the recovery efforts and progress two days after the deadly plane crash. Officials reported \"41 sets of remains have been recovered, and 28 victims have been positively identified.\" The recovery process continues. Officials mentioned the removal of the aircraft assisting in the recovery process and investigation. 12pm: Wednesday’s crash was similar to a deadly collision in 1949, when D.C.’s airspace was less crowded. A passenger plane on final approach to then Washington National Airport collided with a military plane, plunging both aircraft into the Potomac River, killing 55 people. At the time, it was the deadliest air crash in the U.S. 11:30am: Aviation experts have long worried that the airspace surrounding Washington, D.C. could lead to catastrophe. \"This was a disaster waiting to happen,\" said Ross Aimer, a retired United Airlines captain and chief executive officer of Aero Consulting Experts told the Associated Press. \"Those of us who have been around a long time have been yelling into a vacuum that something like this would happen because our systems are stretched to extremes.\" Officials said flight conditions were clear as the jet arrived from Wichita, Kansas. A Federal Aviation Administration report obtained by The Associated Press described staffing levels as \"not normal for the time of day and volume of traffic.\" 11:15am: Timothy Lilley, a former military helicopter pilot, confirmed that his28-year-old son, Sam Lilley, was one of the two pilots aboard the American Airlines flight. \"This is undoubtedly the worst day of my life,\" Timothy told FOX 5 Atlanta from Washington, D.C. Timothy, who was in New York for work, initially couldn't believe it was his son's flight. \"Last night when I saw on Fox News there was a crash in DC, I really didn't think there was any way that was my son,\" he said. However, after failing to hear from Sam, who always checked in, his worst fears were confirmed. The father and son shared a passion for flying, with Sam having started his flight training in 2019 and working with PSA Airlines, part of the American Airlines group, for two years. Sam was also engaged to be married. Sam Lilley 11:15am: Police boats were in the Potomac River on Friday as part of the recovery and investigation after a deadly midair collision killed 67 people Wednesday night. More than 40 bodies have been pulled from the river as the massive recovery effort continues. Crews worked in the rain Friday morning with wet conditions expected throughout the day. Planes continued to take off and land at Ronald Reagan National Airport next, with operations at the airfield gradually returning to normal after canceled and delayed flights following the crash. According to Reuters the FAA is restricting helicopter flights near DCA imposing significant limitations on Route 1 and Route 4 around the airport. 11am: The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration has restricted helicopter flights near Ronald Reagan National Airport indefinitely, according to the Associated Press. The news organization says the FAA is prohibiting most helicopters from portions of two helicopter routes near the airport. The report says only police and medical helicopters in the section between the airport and nearby bridges will be allowed at this time.

Recovery operations resumed on Friday morning amid rainy conditions. The plane carried  60 passengers and four crew members, and three soldiers were aboard the helicopter. Air crash investigations can take months, and federal investigators told reporters Thursday they would not speculate on the cause. 8:15am: President Donald Trump took to his social media platform, Truth Social, on Friday to post that the Black Hawk helicopter that collided with the American Airlines passenger jet near Ronald Reagan National Airport resulting in the deaths of everyone onboard \"was flying too high, by a lot.\" \"It was far above the 200-foot limit. That’s not really too complicated to understand, is it???\" Trump’s post continued. According toFOX Business, NTSB member Todd Inman, when asked by the news organization about whether the helicopter’s altitude played a role in the crash, said \"Right now, we've not ruled anything in or out.\" \"But I would be very careful to anyone who's listening to this to rely upon off the shelf software, speculation they're seeing online. Our job is to get the absolute facts as we get these [black] boxes in and get them analyzed and we look at more granular data, will be able to give a much better picture on that,\" he said.

The skies were clear at the time. The Federal Aviation Administration reported that moments before American Airlines Flight 5342 was to land, air traffic controllers requested the jet to land on a shorter runway, to which the pilots agreed. Flight tracking sites indicated the plane adjusted its approach accordingly. Less than 30 seconds before the crash, an air traffic controller asked the helicopter if it had visual contact with the jet, and the military pilot confirmed. A subsequent radio call from the controller directed the helicopter to \"pass behind the CRJ,\" apparently advising it to wait for the Bombardier CRJ-701 twin-engine jet to pass. The helicopter did not respond, and the aircraft collided seconds later.

Officials stated that the plane's body was discovered upside-down in three sections in waist-deep water. The helicopter's wreckage was also located in the river. National Transportation Safety Board investigators have recovered the cockpit voice recorder and flight data recorder from the plane, said agency spokesperson Peter Knudson. 5:30am: Among the passengers were members of the Skating Club of Boston, returning from a development camp that followed the 2025 U.S. Figure Skating Championships in Wichita. Club CEO Doug Zeghibe confirmed that 14 people from the skating community were on the plane, including teenage figure skaters Jinna Han and Spencer Lane, their mothers, and two Russian-born coaches, Evgenia Shishkova and Vadim Naumov, who won a world championship in pairs skating in 1994. The victims also included an Ohio college student returning from her grandfather's funeral and a group of hunters coming back from a guided trip in Kansas. Three students from Fairfax County, Virginia, and six parents from the district were also on board, according to Superintendent Michelle Reid. It was the deadliest U.S. air crash since 2001. At least 28 bodies have been pulled from the icy waters, including those of the three soldiers who were on the helicopter.

Jonathan Koziol, chief of staff for Army aviation, described the helicopter crew as \"very experienced\" and familiar with the congested flying conditions around Washington. While their identities have not been officially released, the wife of one of the helicopter pilots, Andrew Eaves of Noxubee County, Mississippi, announced on Facebook that her husband was among those killed.

WHITEHALL, Ohio-Two Ohio sanitation workers escaped serious injury from an explosion in the back of a garbage truck this week. The dramatic blast and its aftermath was caught on camera. Footage shows the two-man crew emptying blue waste bins into the back of their truck in Whitehall, outside Columbus. Just as one of the workers steps back, a large explosion rattles the truck and sends trash flying. The quick-thinking workers – their ears still ringing – grab a fire extinguisher and call 911 as startled residents come to see what had happened. \"It blew my headphones out of my [censored] ear,\" one of the workers can be heard saying. \"That scared the [censored] out of me,\" the other agrees.

Quigly's best friend and fellow Princeton football alumn, Tiger Bech, was killed in the terrorist attack. PHILADELPHIA-The Philadelphia Eagles gifted Super Bowl tickets to a local man who survived the New Year's Eve truck attack in New Orleans that killed 14, including his best friend. Ryan Quigly received the gift from Eagles defensive tackle and Super Bowl LII hero Brandon Graham during a recent trip to the NovaCare Center in South Philly. Quigley, still recovering from a broken leg, revealed that he previously told his slain friend, Tiger Bech, that he would take him to the Super Bowl if the Eagles made it. The backstory: Fourteen people were killed and dozens of others were injured when a man intentionally drove down Bourbon Street early New Year's morning, authorities said. \"He was hellbent on creating the carnage and the damage that he did,\" New Orleans Police Superintendent Anne Kirkpatrick said. The driver, later identified as 42-year-old Shamsud-Din Jabbar, crashed the truck and exchanged gunfire with police before he was shot and killed. Two New Orleans police officers suffered non-fatal gunshot wounds in the brief gunfight with Jabbar. Local perspective: Ryan Quigly, a former Lansdale Catholic High School and Princeton University grad, suffered a broken leg in the attack. His best friend and fellow Princeton University football teammate, Tiger Bech, was killed. Bech and Quigly worked and lived together in New York City. What they're saying: Quigly was emotional when Eagles star Brandon Graham gifted him tickets to the Super Bowl during a recent visit to the NovaCare Complex in South Philly. \"Tiger was the biggest fan,\" Quigly said of his slain friend. \"We went to every home game last year…after every win – which is obviously 15 of them – I told him if we make it, I promise I'm going to take you to the Super Bowl.\" What's next: The Eagles and Kansas City Chiefs will square off in Super Bowl LIX on Sunday, Feb. 9 on FOX 29!

        "title": "US tariffs on Canada and Mexico begin Saturday—what it means for gas prices",
        "source": "https://www.fox29.com/",
        "content": "President Donald Trump used an address Thursday to the World Economic Forum to promise lower taxes to global business leaders if they bring manufacturing to the United States. Trump also threatened to impose tariffs if they do not. LiveNOW's Austin Westfall breaks down Trump's message with Sandra Swirksi, founder and CEO of Interger. WASHINGTON-President Donald Trump announced that 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico will go into effect on Saturday, but he has not yet decided whether to include oil imports in the measure. Speaking from the Oval Office on Thursday, Trump said he would make the determination by the end of the night, basing his decision on whether he believes the two trading partners are charging the U.S. a \"fair\" price for oil. While the tariffs were framed as a response to illegal immigration and fentanyl-related concerns, extending them to oil could impact gas prices and inflation. The move comes despite Trump’s previous campaign promise to cut energy costs in half within a year of taking office. Trump’s threat to include oil in the new tariffs has raised concerns about rising gas prices, a key issue for voters. Canada and Mexico are major oil suppliers to the U.S., with Canada alone accounting for nearly 4.6 million barrels per day in October 2024, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. The potential tariffs could lead to increased costs for refineries that rely on Canadian and Mexican crude, possibly pushing gas prices higher. On Thursday, U.S. oil prices were trading at approximately $73 per barrel, well below the peak of over $120 per barrel in 2022, but industry experts warn that tariffs could drive prices up. What they're saying: Matthew Holmes, executive vice president at the Canadian Chamber of Commerce, criticized the move, warning that tariffs on Canadian oil would ultimately hurt American consumers. \"This is a lose-lose,\" Holmes told the Associated Press. \"We will keep working with partners to show President Trump and Americans that this doesn’t make life any more affordable. It makes life more expensive and sends our integrated businesses scrambling.\" Trump, however, dismissed concerns over price increases, insisting the U.S. does not rely on imports. The US and Canadian flags fly on the US side of the St. Clair River near the Bluewater Bridge border crossing between Sarnia, Ontario and Port Huron, Michigan on January 29, 2025.(Photo by GEOFF ROBINS/AFP via Getty Images) \"We don’t need the products that they have,\" Trump said. \"We have all the oil you need. We have all the trees you need, meaning the lumber.\" By the numbers: Why you should care: The new tariffs, particularly if extended to oil, could have a direct impact on everyday consumers. Increased costs for imported crude oil could lead to higher gasoline prices, despite Trump’s campaign promise to cut energy prices in half. Additionally, the move could strain relations with Canada and Mexico, two of the U.S.’s closest trading partners, and spark retaliatory trade measures that could affect other sectors beyond energy.

        "content": "Share Three of President Donald Trump’s cabinet picks finished their confirmation hearings on Thursday. Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Tulsi Gabbard and Kash Patel were questioned by Democratic senators. Republicans as well as Democrats criticized President Donald Trump’s pick for national intelligence director, condemning Tulsi Gabbard for previous comments sympathetic to Russia, for meeting with Syria’s now-deposed leader and for supporting government leaker Edward Snowden, the Associated Press reported. Gabbard said years of failures by America’s intelligence services require big changes. She said false or politicized intelligence has led to wars, foreign policy failures and the misuse of espionage. \"The bottom line is this must end,\" she said. Gabbard has won praise in Russian state-controlled media by echoing Russian propaganda justifying the Kremlin’s invasion of Ukraine. Republicans accused her of spreading Russian disinformation. Kansas Republican Jerry Moran wanted to know: Would Russia \"get a pass\" from her? Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s long record of questioning the safety of childhood vaccinations could jeopardize his confirmation for health secretary. If all the Democrats rejected Kennedy’s nomination, he could only afford to lose three Republicans. According to the Associated Press, when Kennedy refused Thursday to freject a long-discredited theory that vaccines cause autism, despite years of studies and research that have found they do not, it clearly troubled Health Committee chairman Bill Cassidy. Cassidy is a Louisiana Republican and liver doctor who has regularly encouraged his constituents to vaccinate against COVID-19 and other diseases. \"If there’s any false note, any undermining of a mama’s trust in vaccines, another person will die from a vaccine preventable disease,\" Cassidy said. Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s hearing ended following a heated exchange with Sen. Bernie Sanders. Sanders questioned Kennedy on his views on vaccines. Kennedy fired back saying that members of Congress, including Sanders, were receiving money from pharmaceutical companies, according to the Associated Press. The line drew cheers and applause from Kennedy’s supporters in the room. Sanders responded that he doesn’t take money from organizations or groups that represent the drug-making industry. What they're saying: Kash Patel said \"I’m going to let the cops be cops and put handcuffs on the bad guys and put child molesters in prison and put murderers in prison,\" Patel told lawmakers when asked what his plans for the bureau are. The Associated Press reported that Patel wrote in a Wall Street Journal op-ed published this week that \"violent crime is destroying families across the nation.\" There has been little discussion of national security issues throughout the hearing, which focused on Patel’s past comments. That’s despite a heightened threat of international terrorism and an FBI investigation into a massive breach by Chinese hackers of American telecommunications companies. Democratic Sen. Adam Schiff called on Kash Patel to turn around and face the Capitol police officers in the hearing room. It came as Schiff was criticizing Patel for producing a song featuring President Trump and a choir of jailed Jan. 6 defendants to help raise money for the families of those charged in the Capitol riot. \"If you have the courage to, look them in the eye, Mr. Patel. And tell them you’re proud of what you did. Tell them you’re proud that you raised money off of people that assaulted their colleagues, that pepper sprayed them, that beat them with poles,\" Schiff said the AP reported. Patel fired back: \"That’s an abject lie, you know it. I never, never, ever accepted violence against law enforcement.\" Robert F. Kennedy Jr. had his second of two confirmation hearings for his Health and Human Services Secretary nomination. He will appear before the Health Committee a day after his hearing before the Finance Committee. The Associated Press reported that at Wednesday’s Senate Finance Committee, it was Republican Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, who challenged Kennedy the most. RELATED:Who is RFK Jr.'s wife? Cheryl Hines seen at Senate confirmation hearing Tulsi Gabbard, former US Representative from Hawaii and President Donald Trump's nominee to be director of National Intelligence, during a Senate Intelligence Committee confirmation hearing in Washington, DC, US, on Thursday, Jan. 30, 2025. (Daniel H When asking him to detail his plans for Medicare and Medicaid, Kennedy responded with few answers and misstated some basic facts about how the federally funded programs work and how many people they serve. Cassidy’s vote is crucial for Kennedy since he also serves on the finance committee that will decide whether the health secretary nominee makes it to the Senate floor. Tulsi Gabbard, President Donald Trump’s pick to be director of national intelligence, is expected to face questions from the Senate Intelligence Committee over past comments about Russia and a 2017 visit with Syria’s now-deposed leader, the Associated Press reported. RELATED:Kristi Noem faces Senate confirmation hearing Gabbard unsuccessfully sought the 2020 presidential nomination and left the party in 2022. Gabbard endorsed Trump in August and campaigned often with him. She served in the Army National Guard for more than two decades and was deployed to Iraq and Kuwait. Kash Patel was selected by Trump to lead the FBI and may face questions from Democratic senators Thursday about his loyalty to Trump and stated desire to overhaul the bureau. The backstory: Once President Donald Trump nominates his picks for various positions, they are then presented to the appropriate Senate committee. The committee would then vote to recommend a candidate to the full Senate. The full Senate will debate. Trump's picks will either be confirmed or rejected by a simple majority. If they are approved, they are then sworn in. Republicans currently hold 53 seats in the Senate, which could suggest many of Trump's picks will be confirmed without issue.

Trump’s comments came during a press briefing on Thursday. \"For some jobs,\" Trump said, singling out air traffic controllers. \"They have to be at the highest level of genius.\" He also suggested that sweeping changes might be made at federal aviation agencies.

Flight tracking data showed the plane adjusting its approach to the new runway. Less than 30 seconds before the collision, an air traffic controller asked the helicopter if it had the jet in sight. Moments later, the controller radioed the helicopter again: \"PAT 25 pass behind the CRJ.\" Seconds later, the two aircraft collided.

        "content": " TRENTON-A New Jersey couple who are both police officers are facing disturbing allegations of creating child sexual abuse material and distributing the explicit images online. Prosecutors did not name the man and woman, who they say work as law enforcement officers in different police departments within Mercer County. Investigators say the husband allegedly uploaded over 30 explicit images of his wife in the presence of children, and made other disturbing claims in an online chat. What we know: Investigators in Mercer County on Tuesday acted on a tip from the National Center of Missing and Exploited Children that claimed an mobile messaging platform user uploaded and distributed possible child sexual abuse material. The Mercer County Prosecutor's Office said the user allegedly distributed over 30 media files that contained naked images of his wife in the presence of children. In an online chat exchange, the husband allegedly mentioned that children were present while he and his wife had sex. The husband and wife are both law enforcement officers in different departments in Mercer County, according to prosecutors. The husband has been charged with several crimes, including first degree causing or permitting a child to engage in a sexual act that may be photographed, videoed, or reproduced. The wife was charged with second degree engaging in sexual conduct that would debauch the morals of a child. What they're saying: New Jersey Attorney General Matthew Platkin called the allegations \"disturbing\" in a press release shared Thursday night. \"Sexual offenses against children are among the most serious crimes we charged,\" Platkin said. \"It's especially disturbing when, as in this case, the accused are members of law enforcement.\" Department of Criminal Justice Director Theresa L. Hilton said the allegations could cause \"immeasurable harm to the victims.\" The Hamilton Police Department said one of the officers in the ongoing investigation worked for the department, but did not identify if it was the husband or wife. The department said the officer is being suspended and served with a notice of termination. \"The off-duty allegations made against this officer do not reflect the values of this agency or of the dedicated and hard-working men and women who put their lives on the line every day for the citizens of Hamilton Township to keep you safe,\" a statement read. What's next: Prosecutors say the first-degree charges can carry a sentence of 10 to 20 years in state prison, and a fine up to $200K. Second and third degree charges can result in 3-10 years in state prison and fines up to $150K.

PHILADELPHIA-A Montgomery County inmate is accused of recruiting a man to help him use Instagram to find someone to kill the mother of his child, prosecutors said Thursday. Zunir Wilson-Walker, 22, and Jadan Uriah Jones, 20, were both charged with multiple crimes in the alleged murder-for-hire plot that prison officials caught wind of. Investigators believe in November Walker-Wilson offered $15,000, a Cartier watch, and a car as payment for carrying out the murder of his child's mother. What we know: Investigators suspected the murder-for-hire plot after reviewing a phone conversation that Wilson-Walker alleged used another inmates phone account to make. Wilson-Walker asked Jones to make a fake Instagram account and create a story that offered $15,000, a Cartier watch, and a vehicle for \"beating up and killing the mother of his child.\" It's alleged that Wilson-Walker instructed Jones to use the Instagram story function to avoid attracting attention from police and others. Investigators said Walker-Wilson had lost his phone privileges for verbally abusing and threatening the mother of his child. He also had his prison-issued tablet revoked after investigators say he sent eight harassing and threatening messages to the same woman, which violated a Protection From Abuse Order. Jones is accused of creating an Instagram account called \"walkdownmontt\" and posting a series of stories that investigators say included derogatory comments about the woman, as well as her location information. The posts offered $15K, jewelry, and a car to get Wilson-Walker's former girlfriend \"took off the map.\" What's next: Both men were charged with criminal solicitation of first-degree murder, conspiracy to murder, and criminal use of communication facility. Wilson-Walker was also charged with terroristic threats, stalking, simple assault, strangulation and other charges related to the victim. Wilson-Walker is being held on over $500K bail, and Jones had his bail set at $99K.

        "content": "LiveNOW's Austin Westfall discusses the deadly D.C. plane crash with former commercial pilot Byron Jaffe who spent much of his career flying in and out of Reagan National Airport in Washington D.C. WASHINGTON-Military helicopter flights forced at least two planes to abort landings atReagan National Airportin the week before a deadly collision presumably killed 67 people on Wednesday, according to a report. On Tuesday night, just one day before the collision between an American Airlines flight and an Army Black Hawk helicopter, a different plane alerted the air traffic control tower that it had to abort its landing to avoid collision with a helicopter,the Washington Post reported. Yet another plane arriving at DCA from Charlotte scrubbed its landing on Jan. 23, again because of a helicopter. \"They had to circle back around because there was a helicopter in the flight path,\" said Richard Hart, a passenger on the Jan. 23 flight who spoke to the Washington Post. \"At the time I found it odd. ... Now I find it disturbingly tragic.\" LIVE UPDATES: DC PLANE CRASH INVESTIGATORS RECOVER AMERICAN AIRLINES BLACK BOXES AFTER MIDAIR COLLISION Crews retrieve wreckage of American Airlines flight 5342 on the Potomac River, Washington, D.C., on Jan. 30, 2025. The plane was involved in a fatal collision with a U.S. Army Black Hawk helicopter the previous night. (Leigh Green for Fox News Digita The two close calls came within a week of Wednesday's horrifying collision, in which an inbound commercial flight from Wichita, Kansas, collided with a military helicopter over the Potomac River. A total of 64 people, including four crew members, were aboard passenger American Airlines Flight 5342, and three soldiers were on theArmy Sikorsky UH-60 Black Hawkthat came from Fort Belvoir in Virginia. All are presumed dead. The tragedy has raised concerns about frequent military training flights around Reagan National Airport, including a helicopter lane that intersects with the flight path of aircraft on the southeastern approach to Runway 33, where American Eagle Flight 5342 from Wichita attempted to land Wednesday, the Post reported. The Federal Aviation Administration has placed an air traffic controller dedicated to helicopters in the National Airport tower to manage the hazards, the report said, citing a source familiar with tower operations. However, an internal preliminary report from the FAA showed that the number of staff members working at the air control tower at DCA was \"not normal for the time of day and volume of traffic\" on Wednesday, the Associated Press reported. \"The position configuration was not normal for the time of day and volume of traffic,\" the report said. DC PLANE CRASH TIMELINE: MIDAIR COLLISION INVOLVES 67 PASSENGERS, CREW MEMBERS, SOLDIERS Graphic shows a timeline of the plane crash near Reagan National Airport near Washington, D.C. (Fox News) Despite the report saying the staffing was \"not normal,\" a person familiar with the matter told Fox News Digital that staffing in the control tower at DCA on Wednesday night was at a normal level. The person explained that the positions get combined regularly if air controllers have to step away from the console for breaks, or if they are involved in a shift change. Controllers may also have to step away when air traffic is slow, the person explained, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss internal procedures. Supervisors have the ability to combine roles, which was the case on Wednesday night, though the person familiar with the matter could not say why. When asked about the air traffic and previous reports of it being heavy on Wednesday night, the source said it was moderate. The Washington Post story cited a 2023 Government Accountability Office report to Congress that found 50 entities operated roughly 88,000 helicopter flights within 30 miles of DCA between 2017 and 2019, citing FAA data.

(ANDREW CABALLERO-REYNOLDS/AFP via Getty Images) Regulators have attempted to define safe paths for military helicopters to fly without interfering with commercial flights landing or taking off at the airport. A 2021 GAO report noted, \"in airspace near Reagan National and the Potomac River, FAA further limits the maximum altitudes for helicopters where helicopter routes overlap with commercial passenger airplane operations to ensure the safety of all aircraft.\" On Wednesday night, air traffic controllers had contacted the Black Hawk pilot and asked whether he could see the approaching commercial aircraft as Flight 5342 prepared to land on Runway 33. \"Do you have the CRJ in sight?\" the controller asked, and the helicopter pilot confirmed he saw the passenger plane. The pilot requested \"visual separation,\" meaning he was trying to get out of the flight's path, according to FlightRadar24 audio. The plane and helicopter collided moments later in a fiery explosion. DC PLANE CRASH LIKELY ‘COMBINATION’ OF FACTORS, ‘LUCKY’ THERE HAVEN'T BEEN MORE AIR ACCIDENTS: ATTORNEY A general view of Reagan National Airport in Arlington, Virginia on Thursday, January 30, 2025. An American Airlines flight from Wichita, Kansas collided with a Black Hawk helicopter while approaching the airport for landing the previous evening. (Le Jim Brauchle, a former U.S. Air Force navigator who is now an attorney representing families of victims in aviation disasters, previously told Fox News Digital that keeping a lookout for obstacles can be difficult. \"Having flown at night, having tried to look and see traffic, I think most people would say, ‘Oh, how hard is it to miss an airliner,’ right? You should be able to see that. But it's a lot more difficult than people would expect,\" he said. At night in an urban environment likeWashington, D.C.,or northern Virginia, pilots may not be able to see other aircraft and instead may rely on seeing anti-collision or landing lights, according to Brauchle. But different ambient lights from tall buildings and towers that are lit may make it difficult to distinguish which lights belong to other aircraft. \"What I've heard from the audio is that they called out to [air traffic control]. The helicopter said that he had the aircraft in sight,\" the attorney said. \"My guess is, and again, I'm just speculating, is they saw something that they thought was the airplane, whether it be a tower light, maybe it was another aircraft that was taking off. Whatever they thought they saw obviously wasn't the aircraft.\" Former Navy pilot Kegan Gill joined FOX 5's D.C. team to discuss the deadly collision. The cause of the collision is currently under investigation by the FAA and several other federal agencies. The close call on Tuesday, the evening before the deadly collision, involved Republic Airways Flight 4514 from Connecticut, the Washington Post reported. The pilot told air traffic controllers it had to divert because of an emergency alert about helicopter traffic below the aircraft. Flight tracker maps showed the plane was headed south along the Potomac River corridor towards Reagan National Airport but took a sharp turn to the west. It later landed safely at 8:16 p.m., the report said. LINK:GET MORE ON THIS STORY FROM FOX NEWS Fox News Digital's Audrey Conklin, Greg Wehner and Stephen Sorace contributed to this report.

WASHINGTON, D.C.-It is being reported that staffing was \"not normal\" in the air traffic control tower at Reagan National Airport during the time of the deadly plane crash on Wednesday night. What we know: In a recent report by the Federal Aviation Administration obtained by The Associated Press, one air traffic controller was working two positions at the time of the crash. \"The position configuration was not normal for the time of day and volume of traffic,\" the report says.

WASHINGTON, DC- JANUARY 30:  Emergency response units search the crash site of the American Airlines plane on the Potomac River after the plane crashed on approach to Reagan National Airport on January 30, 2025 in Washington, DC. The American Airlines flight from Wichita, Kansas collided in midair with a military helicopter while approaching the airport. According to reports, there were no survivors amongst the 67 people on board both aircraft. (Photo by Kayla Bartkowski/Getty Images) The backstory: The American Airlines jet had 60 passengers and four crew members on board. Three soldiers were aboard the helicopter. According to officials, the helicopter apparently flew into the flight path of the plane while it was landing at the airport on Wednesday evening around 9 p.m. The crash triggered a major search-and-rescue operation in the icy Potomac River. Dozens of bodies were recovered from the waters during the overnight hours. The plane's fuselage was found upside down and broken into three sections in waist-deep water. The wreckage of the helicopter was also located. If the casualty numbers hold, this incident could become the deadliest U.S. air crash in nearly 24 years. The National Transportation and Safety Board provide updates on their investigation into the DCA plane crash. What they're saying: NTSB officials stated during a press conference that their main focus is on recovering the bodies of the victims. NTSB board member Todd Inman also stated that a preliminary report on the crash will be released within 30 days. \"Our mission is to understand not just what happened but why it happened, and to recommend changes to prevent it from happening again,\" said Inman. President Donald Trump, Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, and Vice President JD Vance give updates on the deadly plane crash at DCA. What they're saying: During a press conference around 11: 21 a.m., President Trump entered the press room asking for a moment of silence for the victims. The president went on to provide updates on the search, switching to a recovery mission. \"There are no survivors,\" he said. \"As one nation, we grieve for every precious soul that has been taken from us so suddenly,\" Trump said. He also noted that other nations are also grieving for foreign nationals from those countries who were also on the plane. \"We are in mourning.\" He said the U.S. military and the National Transportation Safety Board is investigating. \"We’ll find out how this disaster occurred and will ensure that nothing like this ever happens again,\" he said. The president said he was naming Chris Rocheleau, a 22-year FAA veteran, as acting commissioner to the Federal Aviation Administration. \"The FAA is actively recruiting workers who suffer severe intellectual disabilities, psychiatric problems, and other mental and physical conditions under a diversity and inclusion hiring initiative spelled out on the agency’s website,\" said Trump, noting that the program allowed for the hiring of people with hearing and vision issues as well as paralysis, epilepsy and \"dwarfism.\" Trump said air traffic controllers need to be geniuses.

We have had a much higher standard than anybody else. And there are things that you have to go by brain power, you have to go by psychological quality, and psychological quality is a very important element of it. These are various very powerful tests that we put to use, and they were terminated by Biden, and Biden went by a standard that is the exact opposite.\" Trump went on to say that for an air traffic controller \"we want the brightest, the smartest, the sharpest, we want somebody that is psychologically superior, and that's what we are going to have.\" The Source:Information in this article comes from the Associated Press and FOX 5 reporting.

This week saw a number ofexecutive orders from President Donald Trump, fieryconfirmation hearingsfor his cabinet nominees, and of course thetragic midair collisioninvolving an Army helicopter and passenger jet. Friday, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt held her secondbriefingof the new administration at 1 p.m. ET. President Trump will then sign more executive orders at 3 p.m., according to the White House daily schedule. It’s not yet clear what the orders will be, though tariffs on Canada and Mexico have been a hot topic for the president this week. You can watch these events in the player above, and refresh this story for updates. U.S. President Donald Trump talks to reporters from the Resolute Desk after signing an executive order to appoint the deputy administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration in the Oval Office at the White House on January 30, 2025 in Washington, 3:30 p.m. ET:The remains of 41 people had been pulled from the river as of Friday afternoon, including 28 that had been positively identified, Washington, D.C., Fire Chief John Donnelly Sr. said at a news conference. He said next of kin notifications had been made to 18 families, and that he expects the remains of all 67 people who died to eventually be recovered. The wreckage of the plane's fuselage will probably have to be pulled from the water to get all the bodies, he said. \"This is heartbreaking work,\" Donnelly said, noting that more than 300 responders were taking part in the effort at any one time, including teams of divers and two U.S. Coast Guard cutters, at least one of which carries a crane. \"It’s been a tough response for a lot of our people.\" It was unclear how long the recovery operation would take. Although Ronald Reagan National Airport has reopened, two of its three runways remain closed to keep aircraft from flying over the crash scene while taking off or landing, said Terry Liercke, the airport's vice president and manager. Roughly 100 flights were canceled Friday. 3:20 p.m. ET:Trump administration officials are moving to fire FBI agents engaged ininvestigations involving President Donald Trump in the coming days, two people familiar with the plans said Friday. It was not clear how many agents might be affected, though scores of investigators were involved in various inquiries touching Trump. Officials acting at the direction of the administration have been working to identify individual employees who participated in politically sensitive investigations for possible termination, said the people who insisted on anonymity to discuss private conversations. 1:45 p.m. ET:Leavitt said the White House applauded the release of 8 additional hostages from Hamas captivity. \"Thanks to the ceasefire deal secured by President Trump, 3 Israeli and 5 Thai Nationals are being reunited with their families and their loved ones after being held in unspeakable conditions, for over 15 months, and the president remains committed to the release of all remaining hostages, and they should have never been taken by the brutal terrorist group Hamas in the first place,\" she stated. 1:40 p.m. ET:\"When you are flying on an airplane with your loved ones, which every one of us in this room has, do you pray that that your plane lands safely and gets you to your destination or do you pray that the pilot has a certain skin color? I think we all know the answer to that question, and as President Trump said yesterday, it's common sense,\" Leavitt said. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt addresses President Donald Trump and the administration's response to the deadly mid-air collision over the Potomac River outside of Reagan National Airport. Since taking office on Jan. 20, U.S., Trump has issued a series of executive orders aimed at dismantling diversity, equity and inclusion programs. Trump also began his White House briefing Thursday with a moment of silence and a prayer for victims ofWednesday’s crash at Reagan National Airport. But his remarks quickly became a diatribe against diversity hiring and that lowered standards may have been to blame for the crash. 1:30 p.m. ET:\"I can confirm that tomorrow, the February 1 deadline that President Trump put into place, that a statement several weeks ago continues, the president will be implementing tomorrow a 25% tariffs on Mexico, 25% tariffs on Canada and a 10% tariff on China,\" Leavitt said. She continued: \"At this point, the president has made it very clear those tariffs are going to be implemented. And in effect, if the president at any time decides to roll back those tariffs, I'll leave it to him to make that decision. But starting tomorrow, those tariffs will be in place.\" 1:14 p.m. ET:Leavitt said President Trump wants to increase Federal Aviation Administration standards following the tragic plane crash near Washington D.C. on Wednesday. She said that Trump said that the helicopter was flying higher than the plane should have been, but she noted that the investigation was still ongoing. 1:07 p.m. ET:At Friday's White House press briefing, press secretary Leavitt said the White House received more than 10,000 submissions for its open media seats. These seats were opened Friday for Ruthless Podcast, which covers political news and is hosted by Josh Holmes and Michael Duncan. 12:45 p.m. ET:Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth says investigators have not yet recovered a key recording device from the Army helicopter involved in Wednesday’s fatal collision at Ronald Reagan National Airport, AP says. Speaking on Fox News Channel on Friday, Hegseth noted authorities were still looking for the helicopter’s black box. Other factors in the crash, including the helicopter’s altitude and whether the crew was using its night vision goggles, are still under investigation, Hegseth said. 12:15 p.m. ET:President Donald Trump took to his social media platform, Truth Social, on Friday to post that the Black Hawk helicopter that collided with the American Airlines passenger jet near Ronald Reagan National Airport resulting in the deaths of everyone onboard \"was flying too high, by a lot.\" \"It was far above the 200-foot limit.

On every home game day this winning season, the bakers at Loretta’s, on 2nd Street, have been up long before anyone, baking some tasty treats and pastries just for the Philadelphia Eagles. The backstory: \"It’s a balance of numbers and time. You start a little earlier, so we have 2 a.m.  bake times now when we do the Eagles instead of maybe 4 a.m. because we have to get them there by a certain time,\" Loretta’s owner, Kelsey Bush explained. Calm, unassuming and clearly talented at her craft, Bush says she got a call from the Eagles food and beverage manager a couple of years ago. He tasted her pastries and wanted them for the team. She explained her response to the phone call this way, \"We were like, yeah, absolutely, we’ll do it!\" Big picture view: And, now, for the past several years, Loretta’s and their sister business, Bloomsday Restaurant, have supplied thousands of pastries, from almond croissants to cherry pop tarts and cinnamon rolls to the Birds when they play at the Linc. Kelsey and her family, from Pennsylvania, bleed green and she says her brother is convinced the team’s home turf success is connected to the morning pastries on game day. Kelsey explains, \"Whenever they win and they’ve lost at home very little under our pastry delivery, he is convinced it’s something to do with the pastry.\" Team gossip: So who eats the most pastry? \"The rumor has it Jordan Mailata has done the most of that.\" What's next: Kelsey is honored to provide sweet and savory pastries to the home team and wants, \"To make sure they win the Super Bowl.\" To that end, if they ask for their home turf treat to be delivered to New Orleans next week, she’d make it happen.

Kennedy Jr. is facing Senate committees this week for his confirmation hearing to be the next Heath and Human Services secretary. Kennedy appeared first on Wednesday before the Finance Committee, one of two committees with jurisdiction over HHS, and again on Thursday before the Health Committee. Kennedy's confirmation is far from certain in the Senate, where he is expected to face pointed questioning from both Republicans and Democrats on the chamber's health and finance committees. Kennedy’s nomination alarmed people who are concerned about his record of spreading unfounded fears about vaccines. He has long advanced the debunked idea that vaccines cause autism. Caroline Kennedy urged the U.S. Senate in a Tuesday letter to reject the nomination of her cousin to be President Donald Trump's health secretary,calling him a \"predator.\" Caroline Kennedy wrote a scathing letter Tuesday encouraging the U.S. Senate to deny the nomination of her cousin, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., to be President Donald Trump's health secretary. In the letter to senators obtained by the Associated Press, she called Robert F. Kennedy Jr. a \"predator\" who is addicted to power. Ms. Kennedy said in the letter that her cousin’s views on vaccines are disqualifying. She offered senators personal details from their lives growing up together that she said pose an even greater concern. Kennedy ran for president as a Democrat, then as an independent, before he dropped out and endorsed PresidentDonald Trump. The backstory: Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is the son of Democratic icon Robert F. Kennedy, who was assassinated in 1968 during his own presidential campaign. The 71-year-old, whose famous name and family tragedies have put him in the national spotlight since he was a child, has spent years airing his populist — and sometimes extreme — views in podcasts, TV interviews and speeches, building his own quixotic brand. PREVIOUS:Trump expected to nominate RFK Jr. for health secretary Kennedy's numerous remarks, anti-vaccine nonprofit and lawsuits against immunizations are likely to haunt him. RELATED:McConnell slams polio vaccine critics in apparent warning to RFK Jr. He's rejected the anti-vaccine label, instead casting himself as a crusader for \"medical freedom\" who wants more research. He and Trump have vowed not to \"take away\" vaccines. To defuse criticism, he resigned from the Children’s Health Defense, his nonprofit that has filed dozens of lawsuits against vaccines, including government authorizations of some of them. In his opening statement Wednesday, Kennedy rejected the ‘anti-vaccine’ label, telling senators he’s not anti-vaccine but has asked \"uncomfortable questions.\" While Kennedy has called vaccines unsafe, in his opening remarks he said all of his children are vaccinated. \"I believe that vaccines play a critical role in health care,\" Kennedy told the committee. Dig deeper: Other conservatives have questioned Kennedy's abortion views, after he said last year that it should be legal for full-term pregnancies. His campaign later clarified that he supports abortion rights until fetal viability, around 22 to 24 weeks. In meetings with some senators, he promised to follow Trump's directive on the issue. Republican Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri, for example, said he was convinced after talking to Kennedy that he would be a strong anti-abortion advocate. But skepticism remains, with Pence's advocacy group highlighting his abortion views in an ad campaign. \"RFK Jr. has made certain overtures to pro-life leaders that he would be mindful of their concerns at HHS, there is little reason for confidence at this time,\" his group said in a letter sent to senators last week. In Iowa, Kennedy's nomination both excites and worries corn and soybean farmer Brian Fyre. The sixth-generation farmer and Republican thinks Kennedy will offer a fresh perspective, but he also can't afford the ban on corn syrup or pesticides that Kennedy has promised. If confirmed, Kennedy would oversee the Food and Drug Administration, which has the power to enact restrictions. Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson, a Republican from a dairy farm state, sees it differently, telling a crowd at the Heritage Foundation last month that Kennedy's agriculture ideas are a promising part of a bigger goal: \"to Make America Healthy Again.\" Big picture view: Health and Human Services has a broad reach across the lives of Americans, including inspecting the nation’s food, regulating medicines and overseeing research of diseases and cures. It provides health insurance for nearly half of the country — poor, disabled and older Americans, including via Medicare. FROM THE ARCHIVES: LiveNOW from FOX host Christy Matino spoke to Dr. Richard Besser, president and CEO of Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and former acting director of the CDC, about RFK Jr.'s nomination. What's next: After Trump nominates his picks for various positions, they are then presented to the appropriate Senate committee. The committee then votes whether to recommend a candidate to the full Senate. The full Senate will debate. Trump's picks will either be confirmed or rejected by a simple majority. If they are approved, they are then sworn-in. Republicans currently hold 53 seats in the Senate, which could suggest many of Trump's picks will be confirmed without issue.
