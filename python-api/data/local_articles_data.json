        "content": "Lynn Hall, built by Walter J. Hall, is an example of organic modernism in Port Allegany in McKean County, Pa. Hall built Frank Lloyd Wright's Fallingwater house in southwestern Pa. Read more\n\nFallingwater, the Frank Lloyd Wright marvel that floats above a waterfall in Pennsylvania’s Laurel Highlands, might be the most iconic house in America.\n\nThe man who handcrafted Wright’s stone, glass, and concrete design in 1936 began building his own organic modernism gem — Lynn Hall — a year earlier, 200 miles north, in McKean County.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFallingwater, a national historic landmark and tourist attraction above the waters of Bear Run, only offers tours, but visitors can spend the night at Lynn Hall thanks to owners Rick Sparkes and Adam Grant. The determined dreamers from Florida found the abandoned and dilapidated building online, visited, and purchased the property in 2017 for $250,000.\n\nThey’ve since dropped over $1 million into its restoration.\n\n“It just had a magical feel to it,” Grant said. “We couldn’t believe no one was saving it.”\n\nAccording to author Ed Byers, who wrote about Lynn Hall for the Pennsylvania Wilds tourism website, Walter J. Hall was already building his project when Wright was asked to design a home for a Pittsburgh businessman. Hall, a fan of Wright’s work, envisioned Lynn Hall as a rest stop on scenic Route 6, featuring hotel rooms, a restaurant, a dance hall, a gas station, and housing and office space for his family.\n\nWright, according to Lynn Hall’s website, discovered Hall’s “innovative use of poured concrete and mosaic stonework” and asked him to join the Fallingwater team at Bear Run. According to Byers, Hall put a pause on Lynn Hall to help construct Fallingwater, and he and the famous architect often butted heads.\n\n“Walter’s penchant for ‘artistic license’ and making changes ‘on the fly’ in Wright’s absence drove Wright mad,” Byers wrote.\n\nWhile Byers wrote about a “controversy” between Fallingwater and Lynn Hall regarding which piece of organic modernism came first in Pennsylvania, Sparkes and Grant say the two properties get along just fine. The team at Fallingwater, Grant said, was instrumental in helping Lynn Hall land on the National Register of Historic Places.\n\n“The folks at Fallingwater very much understand the importance of Lynn Hall,” Grant said. “It’s all part of a movement beyond one or two examples.”\n\nSparkes and Grant, in researching Hall, found that his son, Raymond Viner Hall, helped usher in an era of “Allegheny Modernism,” designing and building approximately 120 Usonian homes, inspired by Wright, and 27 schools and public buildings in the region.\n\n“They’re little-known masterpieces,” Sparkes said.\n\nLynn Hall is on Airbnb, with two accommodations: the Usonian Cottage and the Architects Suite. It’s located in Port Allegany, approximately 290 miles northwest of Philadelphia.",

        "source": "https://www.inquirer.com/",
        "content": "Austin Contegiacomo and his dog, Koda, were playing on the beach when they discovered nearly century-old whiskey bottles buried in the sand. Read more\n\nAustin Contegiacomo was playing catch with his Sheepadoodle on the cold beach near Margate last month when his dog abandoned the game and began sniffing around.\n\nThere, lodged in the sand at the high tide line, were nearly a dozen sealed bottles of whiskey, embossed with “Lincoln Inn” and a detailed depiction of a man riding a horse.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nContegiacomo was intrigued. He’s not a drinker himself, but he looks out for the Shore.\n\n“At the time, I thought the minimum I’d be doing is cleaning up the beach,” Contegiacomo, 28, said. He lay his jacket down, piled it with the bottles, cinched the drawstring, and carted the bounty away on his back. Soon after, he posted on Reddit about his find, wondering if any bottle diggers or whiskey aficionados out there had any insight.\n\nIt turned out Contegiacomo — really his dog, Koda — had stumbled across a rare trove of whiskey with a fascinating history. (Koda got an extra large bone that day).\n\nThe company that would later become Seagram’s produced Lincoln Inn whiskey in Canada during Prohibition, said Clay Risen, a New York Times reporter and whiskey expert who has written multiple books about spirits. Though also sold in Canada, the brand was likely intended to be smuggled across the border at the time. The bottles that Contegiacomo found were particularly beautiful, a throwback to an earlier era when distilleries would create specialized bottles with heavy embossing to showcase different brands, Risen said.\n\nIn large-scale operations run by transnational mobs, bootleggers ferried bottles of whiskey from the Maritime Provinces of Canada down the Eastern Seaboard. New Jersey was a particularly appealing place to unload clandestine cargo — relatively unpopulated, with wide open beaches, close enough to big cities like New York and Philadelphia to get the product to large, thirsty populations.\n\nIn some of the most established enterprises, smugglers would even set up floating ships stocked with whiskey offshore. At night, when conditions were right, rumrunners would load up the goods, speed to shore, and then race back to the mother ship, Risen said.\n\nPerhaps that’s how these Lincoln Inn bottles ended up in the ocean, and nearly a century later, on the sand near the Margate Pier.\n\n“It would have to be an illegal operation where someone had to move really quickly,” Risen said. “When you’re moving whiskey in bulk packages like that, people tend to keep pretty good track of it.”\n\nContegiacomo, who works as a helicopter rescue swimmer for the Coast Guard, speculated that perhaps his Prohibition-era Coast Guard forefathers were trying to apprehend smugglers, who dropped the bottles as they rushed away.\n\nOnce he had washed off the sand on them, Contegiacomo distributed most of the bottles among his friends from work, many of whom have deep New Jersey roots and were enthralled by the history. Some people said he might be able to make money if he sold them off, but he didn’t care much about that.\n\n“I’d rather share them with those guys than keep 11 of them in my garage,” he said. (He did save one for himself and one for his dad).\n\nIt’s possible there are more to be found. The day Contegiacomo and Koda discovered them, the beach had just been dredged to refill the eroded sand, Contegiacomo said. There were construction vehicles and hundreds of conch shells and horseshoe crabs scattered across the sand — as well as the other, newly dredged treasures. The next day, Contegiacomo’s coworkers returned to the same spot and found another intact bottle, as well as some broken ones that they cleared away.\n\nSo far, no one has tasted the spirits inside, though Contegiacomo said he would if someone else popped a bottle open.\n\n“I wouldn’t have a lot of hope that particular set of bottles would taste very good. Those are not prime storage conditions, under sand,” said Risen. Then again, he added, “Maybe that turns out to be a great place to store whiskey.”",

        "source": "https://www.inquirer.com/",
        "content": "If you’ve found yourself struggling to find a primary care doctor, you’re not alone. While the U.S. has plenty of specialists and subspecialists, physicians who provide primary care (family medicine, internal medicine, pediatrics, and some OB/GYN) are in short supply. The reasons for this are complex but many of them boil down to simple economics.\n\nPrimary care physicians (PCPs) are on the front line of preventing disease; a big part of their job is educating patients on health and wellness and ordering testing to evaluate for potential problems (pap smears for cervical cancer screening, mammograms, blood tests for cholesterol and kidney function, etc.). The annual wellness visit often includes discussion of diet and exercise, vaccine counseling, reviewing substance use, teaching safe sex practices, and so on.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNo one doubts the importance of this work, but unfortunately health insurers don’t pay for all of it. Insurance coverage (private and government-funded) pays far more for procedures (colonoscopies, surgery, etc.) and specialized care than it does for preventive care done by PCPs. So physicians generally earn far more in specialties than working in primary care.\n\nIn addition, the cost of medical school has steadily risen and many doctors graduate with staggering amounts of student loan debt. Even those who love primary care may decide to pursue a more lucrative specialty, further decreasing the number of PCPs.\n\nOver the past few decades, the number of smaller, physician-owned primary care practices has declined as regional health systems have grown. Many PCPs who had their own practices closed due to shifting populations (from rural to suburban or urban), insurance hurdles, and the competition from larger health systems.\n\nThen there is the rapidly growing population of older adults; the baby boom generation has hit retirement age. We have nowhere near enough primary care doctors who specialize in care of the elderly, called geriatricians. This was compounded by many PCPs who retired during or immediately after the COVID pandemic. This has resulted in far fewer PCPs than even a decade ago. In an attempt to remedy this, many health systems employ advanced practice providers (APPs) like nurse practitioners and physician’s assistants. This doesn’t solve the issue if you are looking for a board-certified primary care physician. In fact in some cases it has made it harder for PCPs to find employment as they demand higher salaries given their additional training and expertise.\n\nUnfortunately, there are no easy solutions to these issues. If you’re in the market for a new PCP you may have to do some work to find one. Here are some tips for your search.\n\nWord of mouth. Ask your friends and family if they have a PCP they like. A personal recommendation can go a long way in motivating you to call and set up a visit.\n\nCheck your insurance website. While not always up to date, the site lists PCPs who accept your insurance. You can then filter by zip code and radius in which you want to travel to find your best options. The website should also tell you which offices are accepting new patients, but you will have to call the office to be sure the information is current.\n\nConsider a regional health system like Jefferson or Penn. Many PCPs now work under the umbrella of a larger health system, which may own dozens of offices. If you live in a place where one (or more) health systems exist, you’ll likely be able to find an affiliated practice accepting new patients.\n\nPay more out-of-pocket. Many PCPs are now offering new models of care called Direct Primary Care (DPC) and Concierge Medicine. These practices require patients to pay a monthly or yearly fee in exchange for increased access to the PCP. Not only does this include unlimited office visits, there may also be perks like guaranteed same-day visits, an option to call the PCP for after-hours advice, house calls, and more. The additional fees help the PCPs keep their practices relatively small, allowing them more time and attention for their patients. The fees also cover much of the time PCPs spend doing work that insurance companies don’t pay for, like answering questions by email or phone call, reviewing lab results, completing forms. The drawback: fees that patients pay to join this kind of practice are not covered by insurance, though labs, radiology, and visits to other specialists still are.\n\nAmanda Finegold Swain is a family medicine physician in the University of Pennsylvania Health System.",

        "content": "Philadelphia Flyers Jakob Pelletier, (22), looking for an open teammate during the second quarter of the game against Ottawa Senators at the Wells Fargo Center in Philadelphia, Pa., on Tuesday, March 11, 2025. Read more\n\nJakob Pelletier has been a member of the Flyers for 43 days ... technically.\n\nAcquired in the early hours of Jan. 31 from the Calgary Flames, the forward didn’t play his first game in orange and black until late February.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“Twenty-two days,” he said, cutting off a reporter asking about having to play catch-up.\n\nLike a convict checking off the days until their release, Pelletier counted off the days between his last game with the C of Red on Jan. 30 and his Flyers debut against the Edmonton Oilers.\n\n“Well, the first challenge was not getting the visa, that was the first thing,” he said with a laugh about some of the challenges with a new team. It took some time for the Canadian to get his work visa, and it wasn’t great timing since the NHL took a break for the 4 Nations Face-Off in mid-February.\n\nNow comfortably in Philly, Pelletier has played 10 games and registered two assists. His first assist came in his second game with the Flyers, when he tapped the puck to Bobby Brink, freezing the Pittsburgh Penguins defense and allowing Noah Cates to score. His second came on Tuesday against the Ottawa Senators when he switched with Cam York at the point, allowing the defenseman to set up Rodrigo Ābols.\n\n“I thought I played some good games,” Pelletier said on Saturday. “It’s tough when you change teams, like system-wise and everything. But I think so far, it’s been all right. Of course, as a player, you want to win more and play more, but I think it’s on me to show that I can do that.”\n\n» READ MORE: Flyers’ John Tortorella addresses Emil Andrae’s growing pains: ‘I want him to respect the league’\n\nPelletier has been planted on the fourth line with Ābols and Nick Deslauriers. He went from averaging almost 13 minutes a night under Flames coach Ryan Huska — he had 11 points in 27 games with a plus-minus of plus-10 — to under 9 minutes with coach John Tortorella.\n\n“He came in and met with me one-on-one,” Tortorella revealed before Tuesday’s game against the Senators. “Certainly not going to give the information, but he’s wondering [about his minutes]. And it’ll be unfair for me to, and I said it to him — I’ll tell you what I said to him — it’s unfair for me to make any type of assessment. I haven’t seen him play enough, and when he does play, he hasn’t played a lot of minutes.”\n\n“I was just trying to see, like, after seven games or eight games, what can I improve on, or what is the small stuff that I can do to help the team win more,” Pelletier said when retelling his version of the meeting. “We chatted for probably like 10 minutes. And, yeah, it’s been good. I think he’s the type of coach [who] likes when guys go see him. So, yeah, it was good. But now I think it’s on me to show what I can bring more of for our team.”\n\n» READ MORE: As Flyers try to turn their fortunes around, DJ Owen Tippett handles the pregame soundtrack\n\nNew run-walk event honors Gaudreau brothers\n\nThe Gaudreau Family has announced the inaugural Gaudreau Family 5K Run/Walk & Family Day, presented by Fanatics, will take place on May 31. In addition to the 3.1-mile run or walk, there will also be a one-mile run and a kids’ dash.\n\nHeld at Washington Lake Park in Sewell, N.J., the event will honor Johnny and Matthew Gaudreau and their commitment and dedication of giving back to the community. The brothers were killed by an alleged drunk driver while riding their bikes in Oldmans Township on Aug 29. Johnny was 31 years old, and Matthew was 29.\n\nThe money raised from the event will go towards creating an adaptive playground at Archbishop Damiano School in Westville, N.J. According to a release, the school provides services to over 135 students with multiple disabilities by offering individualized and inclusive special education programs and therapies for students ages 3 to 21. The programs work towards building independence through an engaging curriculum and fostering an environment where students feel valued, respected, and supported.\n\n“To know the Gaudreau family is to know that family comes before all else,” executive director and principal Michele McCloskey said in the press release. “The family’s long-standing dedication and history at Archbishop Damiano School have been a source of inspiration for us all. Their kindness and love continue to touch our hearts as they strive to live our mission and impact our students’ lives despite their loss.”\n\nBreakaways\n\nSam Ersson will start between the pipes on Saturday against the Carolina Hurricanes (7 p.m., NBCSP).",

        "content": "Owner Lester Katsanis pauses outside his Quebec Motel in Wildwood. Some at the Jersey Shore wonder if Canadians are canceling planned visits over tariffs and other anti-Canadian rhetoric. Read more\n\nCAPE MAY COURT HOUSE — During some weeks in August, the 80-acre Avalon Campground on Route 9 is about half French-speaking Canadians, says general manager Mike Slifer. It’s been that way for generations.\n\n“When you’re talking about working-class Canadian families that have enough of a budget to go on a nice vacation for the family, this is where they’re going to come,” Slifer says. He’s confident they’ll be back this summer.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut others have reasons to doubt, amid the noise from President Donald Trump over tariffs and trade wars, talk of travel boycotts, economic uncertainty, and the 51st state insult, not to mention the exchange rate (one Canadian dollar is currently worth 70 cents in the U.S.).\n\nDuane Watlington, who runs Vacation Rental Wildwoods, a rental reservation site, said search traffic from Canada was down 62% in January compared with 2024 and, in February, down more than 80% (from 772 families searching to 149).\n\n“There’s a lot of external factors,” he said. “I think it’s the strength of the dollar. Our vacations are more expensive this year. And there’s a little bit of a grudge.”\n\nMotel owners and others in Cape May County say the Canadians who have driven down from Quebec and Ontario provinces every summer, some families since the 1960s, driving 10 hours to the comfort of (relatively) warm ocean waters, have been like family. But, also like families, they’re currently miffed.\n\n“Some of them are pissed, pardon the expression,” said Lester Katsanis of the Quebec Motel on Atlantic Avenue in Wildwood. He said that overall bookings are a bit slower, and that it’s too early to draw conclusions. Business from Canada has dropped in general since before the pandemic. “It’s a hiccup,” he said of the current environment.\n\nGaby Ralph, of Ottawa, who is married to a Philly native, says her family has enjoyed years of travel down the Shore, to Philadelphia and to Florida, and, last year, to Rehoboth Beach.\n\nBut she’s skipping this year, and says many of her friends in Canada are as well.\n\n“Given the 51st state nonsense and the looming tariffs, we’ve decided to cancel and are looking at travel to Europe instead,” Ralph said. “It’s just the thing that’s really bothering a lot of people, the 51st state, that keeps getting repeated.\n\n“Last year we went to see the Phillies in Florida for spring training, but we decided not to this year,” she said by phone from Ottawa. “We’d planned to go back to Rehoboth this summer, but we were like hmm … no.”\n\nPrime Minister Justin Trudeau suggested in early February that Canadians consider changing any plans to vacation in the United States, and Canadian travel agencies are reporting as much as 40% drops in bookings.\n\n“We were sad to have to cancel,” Ralph added. “The politics definitely plays a role. The exchange rate, it is what it is.”\n\nVarious motel, campground, and independent landlords in Cape May County are also reporting sporadic cancellations.\n\nJohanna Zarroli of Island Realty in Wildwood said, “Most of our reservations are still in place for our Canadian clients.” But, “I’ve had one or two just say they’re not coming to the U.S. anymore.”\n\nMarilena Von Rohr rents four units in Wildwood as Mikayla’s Cove and said by email, “Yes, I have received communication from Canadians that they will not be returning to Wildwood this year.”\n\nLast month, tourism officials in the Wildwoods issued a news release welcoming “Our Canadian Neighbors with Affordable Travel Options.” It stressed the decades-long “deep and enduring connection” between Canadians and the Wildwoods, and, mindful of the exchange rate, pointed out the free things to be found in the Wildwoods (starting with its beaches).\n\nMike Snyder of Visit South Jersey attended the Outdoor Adventure and Travel Show in Toronto late last month, along with numerous other New Jersey and American destination representatives. (New Jersey’s slogan was “little state LOTTA WOW.”) He said the reception was positive.\n\n“If there was a concern, it was more about the currency exchange,” he said.\n\nBut John Donio, president of the Wildwood Business Improvement District, said his members have seen cancellations, and at his motel, the Daytona Inn, the usual reservation calls from Quebec and Ontario provinces have yet to materialize.\n\n“Of all people,” he said, he would have thought Trump, who famously was in the South Jersey hospitality business himself, would have been sensitive to the impact of his comments and policies.\n\n“The Canadian business right now is in a little bit of peril,” said Donio. “All around the tourism industry in New Jersey, we’re concerned with some of the federal government’s policies right now toward Canada, which is coming off as adversarial I feel toward a lot of Canadian tourists. It’s kind of turning them off toward visiting America.”\n\nBorder officials in Canada, meanwhile, report a decrease in Canadians returning from vacations by car in recent months, compared with a year ago (their statistics are recorded from the Canadian side). For instance, between Feb. 16 and 22 there were 431,489 returning Canadian cars from the United States, compared with 565,328 in 2024.\n\nEarlier this year, ski resorts in Vermont expressed concern that the visitors from Canada they rely on might stay away during the winter.\n\n“I respect the difficulty of reconciling your love of a place with any political motivations keeping you from even this, the most special of places,” wrote Steve Wright, general manager of Jay Peak Resort, in a post on Facebook that got thousands of thumbs-ups. “I wish I had more to offer than just empathy for difficult decisions but, for now, that will have to do.”\n\nBut Dehlia Wright, a spokesperson for Jay Peak, said last week that the concern had abated. “We’re sold out for Quebec and Ontario break week, and it appears there are lots of Canadians still willing to travel to us,” she said in an email.\n\nBack in Wildwood, Katsanis of the Quebec Motel said he would work to offset the exchange rate with returning customers from the North.\n\n“We’re wiling to work with the Canadians,” Katsanis said. “For repeat customers, we’ll give them 20% off to accommodate them. For all these years they came down and supported us, they deserve to get treated with respect.”\n\nA Trump supporter himself, as are many in Wildwood, Katsanis cites the flow of fentanyl into the United States, which Trump has used as justification for imposing tariffs, though nearly all fentanyl seized by the U.S. comes through the southern border, not the northern, according to Customs and Border Patrol data. He doesn’t think politics will keep Canadians away. “They enjoy coming down and staying with their American friends,” he said. “No matter what Trump says.”\n\nOver at the Nassau Inn, general manager Lisa Merritts-Boncoski said she hasn’t noticed any cancellations and was optimistic that all would be forgiven by summer.\n\nShe noted that the “construction week” holiday that brings Canadians often coincides with “Ukrainian Week” in Wildwood, potentially uniting a variety of global concerns in the Wildwoods this August, all in service of a kitschy throwback beach vacation.\n\n“We have a lot of Canadians,” she said, stroking the head of her yellow bearded dragon lizard, Pickett. “Our people rebook and rebook and rebook.”",

Commissioned as part of Harris’ three-year residency with Penn Live Arts, American Street Dancer is a complex and ambitious work.\n\nIn it, 20 exceptionally talented dancers and eight equally remarkable musicians focus on a trio of regional street-dance styles: jit from Detroit, footwork from Chicago, and Philadelphia’s own GQ.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn a preperformance chat, Harris stressed that street dance is not the same as hip-hop, which developed later and is danced exclusively to hip-hop music. In contrast, various communities have their own styles of street dance, each performed to a variety of musical genres. Harris added that he created this program to honor the pioneers of street dance, whose contributions have often been forgotten, and to demonstrate the mutual influences of various types of percussive dance (where feet and hands make the rhythm).\n\nTo further emphasize the concept of legacy, videographer/lighting designer Julie Ballard projects a series of vintage photos and film clips onto the rear wall of the stage.\n\nFor audience members unfamiliar with the distinctions among jit, footwork, and GQ, the printed program provides helpful explanations. But, even without prior knowledge of these forms, the short segments — each represented by local experts (Michael Manson’s House of Jit, Creation Global with footwork-style choreography by Eddie Martin, and Harris’s own troupe: Rennie Harris Puremovement) — are easy to appreciate.\n\nAnd the solo performed by tap-dance virtuoso Ayodele Casel is a master class in the myriad ways the human foot can move to create its own music. Whether Casel is executing graceful slides, emphatic jumps, or delicate toe-stutters, her command of rhythm — at all speeds — is mesmerizing.\n\nThe artist biographies reveal impressively varied backgrounds: The dancers tour and teach all over the world, studying dance and criminal justice, and collecting numerous awards, while using their skills to work toward social change. The dancers have top-notch technique, plus the ability to handle both challenging unison work and improvisational solos.\n\nWhile each dance style received an enthusiastic response, it was GQ — presented by Harris’ company — that brought the audience to its feet. Reportedly named after the men’s magazine, GQ has its roots in Philadelphia’s Black social clubs of the 1960s, where the cha-cha was a popular couple dance. For his version, Harris borrows the basic cha-cha rhythm, dresses his dancers in elegant black suits with white shirts and bowler hats (vs. the more casual, uncredited costumes worn in other numbers), and sometimes has them move in groups of two.\n\nHarris’ GQ is his own — full of exciting choreographic invention. Watching the members of RHPM, it was impossible to distinguish apprentices from principal dancers. It was also difficult to identify individuals, but Zakhele “Swazi” Grabowski stood out due to his acrobatic abilities.\n\nOf course, dance is just one element of this performance, complemented by the Rennie Harris Hip-Hop Orchestra. Master drummer Brytiece Wallace opens the show with a percussion-inspired solo, then joins the three bucket drummers (Tony Royster, Edward Smallwood, and Solomon Saunders) for several dramatic sequences. Beatboxers Akim Funk Buddha, also trained in Mongolian throat-singing; Alexander Sanchez; and the justly famous Kenny Muhammad (a.k.a. “The Human Orchestra”) are astonishing.\n\nHolding mics in one hand and gesturing with the other, they produce combinations of sounds that seem well beyond the range of the human vocal apparatus. A crowd favorite was turntablist DJ Razor Ramon. He began with standard DJ moves (e.g., “scratching” vinyl records) but segued to manipulating the discs with his head, or standing with his back to the turntables, and — in a final flourish — removing his T-shirt with one hand, all without missing a beat.\n\nNone of this would be possible without the wizardry of RHPM’s Bessie Award-winning composer, music editor, and live sound designer, Darrin M. Ross. It is Ross who ensures that the very different sounds produced by the dancers, drummers, beatboxers, and turntablist — plus occasional recordings of voices and flowing water — maintain the proper balance.\n\nThe evening ends quietly, with an African-inspired song, and a projected text: “In Memory of Dave the Renegade,” a member of the pioneering Philadelphia hip-hop dance group the Scanner Boys, with whom Harris performed during the 1980s.\n\nA few of the transitions between segments could have been crisper, and Harris’ prerecorded comments were sometimes difficult to understand. But American Street Dancer does what it set out to do: celebrate vibrant and varied traditions of community music and dance, while — not just incidentally — reminding viewers of the essential contributions made by female performers to this fast-paced, competitive art form.\n\nRennie Harris Puremovement in “American Street Dancer” at the Annenberg Center’s Zellerbach Theatre, 3680 Walnut St., through Saturday (2 p.m. and 8 p.m.) Tickets: $47 - $79; (215) 898-3900; annenbergcenter.org.",

        "content": "Franco Gomez made it home to his family by dinnertime on a misty Friday in late January. Another exhausting week of working as a carpet installer, earning $130 a day, had drawn to a close.\n\nTo escape a damp chill that had seeped into their Northeast Philadelphia rowhouse, Gomez and his wife, Carolina, cuddled in a queen-size bed with their two children in a second-floor bedroom, the warmest space in the house. The family started to watch a Netflix movie, The Princess Switch.\n\nMoments later, a thunderous explosion rattled their walls and shattered their windows, and their roof was cleaved open by something large and metallic: an 800-pound jet engine.\n\nA smoldering piece of the roof crumbled, and struck 4-year-old Rayan on the back of his neck. Gomez darted out of the room, cradling his boy in his arms, then tripped and tumbled down the stairs to the first floor.\n\nGomez — with his wife and their daughter, Valentina, at his heels — grabbed for the front door. It didn’t budge.\n\n“Our house is burning, Mami!” 9-year-old Valentina cried.\n\nA neighbor managed to break open the front door, and the Gomezes rushed across the street. They watched helplessly as plumes of dark smoke rose from their home. Flames devoured all of their belongings, including a mermaid-shaped piggy bank that held $15,000 — the family’s only savings, a decade’s worth.\n\nA Learjet medical transport had just crashed on nearby Cottman Avenue, leaving seven people dead and at least two dozen injured, plunging the neighborhood into chaos.\n\nMayor Cherelle L. Parker’s administration has spent much of the last 40 days trying to assess the extent of the damage — physical, material, and emotional — that homeowners and business owners have suffered in the wake of the Jan. 31 plane crash.\n\nBut the city’s efforts to help those affected were slow to reach the Spanish-speaking Gomezes, who struggled to find and pay for a new place to live, while encountering language barriers along the way.\n\nThey escaped the fire with just the clothes they were wearing, and were grateful to have suffered only minor cuts and bruises. Carolina Gomez has started a new nightly ritual: rewashing the few clothes that each family member has.\n\nThe Philadelphia Department of Licenses and Inspections has visited 366 properties near the crash site. Inspectors have determined that 14 homes were unsafe, due to fractured facades, loose bricks, and roofs that firefighters cut open for ventilation to help contain flames.\n\nTwo other properties were labeled imminently dangerous, including the Gomezes’ home; inspection records show that the building’s interior walls and joists were all damaged, and that the roof collapsed.\n\nEarlier this month, Parker’s administration sent caseworkers from the Philadelphia Office of Community Empowerment and Opportunity to knock on doors in the five blocks closest to the crash, and ask residents directly if they needed assistance.\n\nMore than half indicated that they did not require help, said Stephanie Reid, the city’s deputy chief administrative officer.\n\nCaseworkers have also been guiding some people affected by the crash through the process of filing claims with an insurance carrier that represents Jet Rescue Air Ambulance, the owner of the Learjet that nose-dived from the sky just moments after it took off from Northeast Philadelphia Airport.\n\nReid acknowledged that the city has not been able to reach every resident affected by the crash, particularly renters who have since relocated. The Inquirer found that several families have been displaced, at least temporarily.\n\n“This is going to be an ongoing process,” she said.\n\n“We’ve been working in this community since the crash on Jan. 31, and plan to continue outreach and support until those who need help have gotten the support they need. Some folks might not realize the needs they have for another month.”\n\nThe Gomezes, who were renters, face a more difficult path to recouping their losses. A relative helped the family set up a GoFundMe account. In five weeks, it raised only $1,313. (After this story was published Friday on The Inquirer’s website, donors boosted that total to more than $25,000.)\n\nThey lived for nearly a week at an American Red Cross shelter in a high school gymnasium. The nonprofit provided them with some food, medicine, and clothing.\n\n“There is nothing quite as awful as waking up in the middle of a gym with absolutely nothing,” Carolina Gomez, 38, said.\n\nFranco Gomez, 51, said the Red Cross had texted him a message in Spanish, informing him about a town-hall meeting the city planned to hold on Feb. 5. He hoped to obtain information about programs that might help his family.\n\nThe meeting, though, was held in English, and Franco Gomez was unable to find someone who could translate the discussion into Spanish.\n\n“No one asked if we needed help, and we didn’t know how to ask for it either,” he said. “It felt like we were less than, something that could simply be left on the sideline.”\n\n(Reid said four interpreters, who spoke Spanish, Brazilian-Portuguese, and Mandarin, were present at the meeting.)\n\nThe next day, the family learned the shelter would be closing.\n\nThey spent a few nights at a friend’s house and then moved into another rental property, but can barely afford the monthly $1,500.\n\n“We have never lived like this before,” Carolina Gomez said.\n\nCharred and crumbling homes\n\nA preliminary investigative report, released earlier this month by the National Transportation Safety Board, showed that the Learjet lifted off from a small runway at 6:06 p.m. and inexplicably rocketed back down to earth a minute later.\n\nBasil Merenda, L&I’s commissioner of inspections, safety, and compliance, was at home, watching the evening news, when another agency official called and told him that a plane had crashed in the Northeast.\n\nNTSB investigators determined that the plane struck a sidewalk near the Roosevelt Mall, creating a debris field that stretched 1,410 feet in length and 840 feet wide, and a crater that ran eight feet deep.\n\nThe plane’s six occupants — including 11-year-old Valentina Guzmán Murillo, who had spent four months undergoing treatment for a spinal condition at Shriners Children’s Philadelphia — were killed.\n\nWhile one of the plane’s engines barreled through the Gomezes’ roof, a wing slammed into the ground behind their house.\n\nPolice officers and firefighters — including some from nearby Engine 71 — found carnage everywhere they looked: homes and cars engulfed in flames; human remains visible on the ground.\n\nFour inspectors from L&I’s contractual services unit were dispatched to the neighborhood. Merenda describes the construction experts as “L&I’s version of the Marines” for their willingness to trek inside unstable buildings.\n\nThe inspectors visited homes on Rupert, Leonard, Hanford, and Calvert Streets. The agency continues to receive calls from residents who have discovered newfound cracks and loose bricks in their homes, Merenda said.\n\nViolation records show that the two properties that inspectors labeled imminently dangerous began to rack up fines in February, while the 14 unsafe properties would begin to be penalized in April if homeowners had not taken steps by then to secure the buildings.\n\nParker has instructed L&I to not pursue collecting those fines.\n\n“She wants us to show some compassion,” Merenda said. “These folks were innocent victims.”\n\nThe agency is considering expediting the permit review and inspection process for property owners who plan to rebuild. Merenda advised homeowners who are preparing to hire construction firms to first visit L&I’s website and check whether the companies are properly licensed by the city.\n\n“We want to make it as easy as possible for people,” he said.\n\nNo money for rent\n\nIn early February, Parker and other city officials assembled at S. Solis-Cohen Elementary School, about half a mile from the crash site, and acknowledged to local residents that the neighborhood’s recovery would be long and complex.\n\n“We are a resilient city,” Parker told the audience, “and we know how to take care of each other.”\n\nReid, the deputy chief administrative officer, said caseworkers with the community empowerment and opportunity office have been assessing residents’ needs and helping to connect them with available local and state assistance.\n\nSome have also visited a community center, at Edmund Street and Bleigh Avenue, for guidance, and more than 340 residents have signed up for updates managed by the Philadelphia Office of Emergency Management.\n\nThe One Philly Fund, a fundraiser for victims of the crash that is managed by the Parker administration, has collected $20,000, Reid said.\n\nThe city contacted the Gomez family this week and offered to help, Franco Gomez said.\n\nHao Chen, who owns the home that the Gomez family rented, plans to demolish and rebuild, depending on what his homeowner’s insurance will cover, his brother said.\n\nIn the days following the plane crash, Carolina Gomez met with a representative from Catholic Social Services and said she was told that the nonprofit would pay the Gomezes’ rent for several months, once they secured a new place to live.\n\nThe family found a new place to rent, but it carried a steep price: a $1,500 payment for the first month, another $1,500 for the last month, and a $2,000 security deposit.\n\nCarolina Gomez said Catholic Social Services did not deliver on the financial assistance it promised.\n\nDesperate, she called her brother in Latin America. He cobbled the $5,000 together through donations from relatives and neighbors and overnighted it.\n\nKathy Bevenour, a Catholic Social Services assistant director, told The Inquirer that “help was provided” to the Gomez family but declined to offer specific details.\n\nThe charity’s hotline for rental assistance now leads to a recorded message: “We have run out of money at this time.”\n\nThe family is already behind on rent for the month.\n\n“We don’t have any money, we have bills to pay,” Franco Gomez said. “We are really not making ends meet.”\n\nOn March 6, Valentina turned 10. She struggles with nightmares.\n\n“My mom needs a jacket and my dad also needs a jacket,” the girl told a reporter, “and my mom needs shoes and my dad needs shoes, and me and my brother need shoes.”\n\nAfter escaping the fire, Rayan remained mute for two weeks.\n\n“Rayan just stopped talking, like he was in shock, like he is on pause,” his father said.\n\nRecently, though, he has started to speak again.\n\nThe family has made one return trip to their former rowhouse.\n\nBroken glass and ashes littered the floor, while toys and couches sat melted and charred.\n\n“I tell my daughter that as long as we are all together, God will not abandon us,” Carolina Gomez said, “and little by little, we will get back on our feet.”",

It said Cigna’s rates have increased only by roughly 3% since 2020, while wages paid to health-care workers have increased by about 20% over the same time period. “Rising costs for labor, medical supplies, and operations make it unsustainable to continue at these below-market rates,” Jefferson said.\n\nCigna has 38,000 people in Medicare Advantage plans in the Philadelphia area, according to federal data. People in those plans who rely on Jefferson doctors are not affected by Saturday’s announcement.\n\nIt is not unusual for contract talks between insurers and health systems to go down to the wire. Last month, Main Line Health warned patients that it might go out-of-network with Cigna, but reached a last-minute deal on a new multiyear contract.\n\nSometimes health systems go out-of-network but subsequently reach a new contract. Tower Health hospitals and doctors were out-of-network for Cigna members for four months early last year until a new contract was reached.",

        "source": "https://www.inquirer.com/",
        "content": "Councilmember Kendra Brooks (left), then-Council President Darrell Clarke, and Councilmember Jamie Gauthier held a news conference in June 2023 to celebrate a successful campaign to protect nearly 100 community gardens from development at Iglesias Gardens. But due to problems at the Philadelphia Sheriff's Office, the city's Land Bank has been unable to acquire the land. Read more\n\nLast May, City Council passed a routine bill that amended the Philadelphia Code in order to preserve the Land Bank’s ability to acquire tax-delinquent lots at sheriff sales.\n\nThe bill was essentially a bit of legal housekeeping. It tightened up the city’s land-acquisition process in response to a recent U.S. Supreme Court case in Minnesota over a property forfeiture.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe goal was simple: Enable the city’s Land Bank, a quasi-governmental agency, to protect 90 or so parcels of community gardens from development and continue with its overall mission of repurposing vacant or blighted land into affordable housing and other projects that benefit the public.\n\nThe bill passed 17-0. Mayor Cherelle L. Parker — whose administration helped draft the legislation — promptly signed it into law in June 2024.\n\nYet, nine months later, the Land Bank has yet to acquire the garden parcels at sheriff sale.\n\nIn fact, it has been unable to purchase any properties through sheriff sale — for the last five years.\n\nThe reason: a problem in Sheriff Rochelle Bilal’s office. Again.\n\nCity Hall is losing patience.\n\n“It is beyond frustrating that these purchases still have not taken place, and that the gardeners — people who work so hard and care so deeply about their communities — are still in limbo after years of advocacy,” Councilmember Kendra Brooks, who introduced last year’s Land Bank legislation, said in a statement to The Inquirer last week.\n\nThe specific reason for the yearslong problem is not entirely clear, even to some Council members. But it appears to be related to Bid4Assets, an online auction house Bilal hired in 2021 during the pandemic to run sheriff sales.\n\nAngel Rodriguez, executive director of the Land Bank, told Council at an October hearing that his staff is “working out operational issues” with Bilal’s office for his agency to exercise its “priority bid” at sheriff sales.\n\nThat process is supposed to allow the Land Bank to buy properties at tax sales without getting into costly bidding wars with other interested parties, and to exempt it from other costs.\n\n“What we’re looking at is the agreement that the sheriff’s department has with Bid4Assets,” Rodriguez said.\n\nRodriguez said at the time he was hopeful the problem could be resolved by the end of 2024.\n\nThat didn’t happen.\n\nThe city now says it’s shooting for June.\n\nJamila Davis, a spokesperson for the Land Bank and the Philadelphia Department of Planning and Development, said: “The Land Bank and the Sheriff’s Office are working out operational details for the Land Bank to exercise its priority bid on the new online platform. We are optimistic that the Land Bank will be able to exercise its priority bid before the close of this fiscal year [in June].”\n\nDavis declined to elaborate.\n\nBilal and Bid4Assets did not respond last week to requests for comment. Bilal told WHYY last week that the Supreme Court decision in 2023 was to blame for the delay.\n\nYet Rodriguez told City Council last fall that the issue had already been resolved, and indicated the remaining obstacle was related to fees imposed by Bid4Assets. City Hall sources, who sought anonymity in order to speak freely about internal matters, say the company has either been unwilling or unable to waive these fees for the Land Bank as part of the priority bid mechanism.\n\n» READ MORE: ‘Disaster waiting to happen’: Courthouse security incidents, trial delays have soared under Sheriff Rochelle Bilal\n\nSheriff Bilal and delinquent sales\n\nUnder Bilal, who took office in January 2020, the sheriff’s office has repeatedly failed to perform even its most basic functions, from securing court buildings to transferring deeds of properties sold at sheriff’s sale.\n\nSales of most tax-delinquent properties had been on hold for more than three years after Bilal circumvented the city’s law department in April 2021 and steered a no-bid contract to Bid4Assets to move auctions online.\n\nThe contract maneuver alarmed City Council and led to a protracted standoff with City Hall that left an estimated $35 million in tax revenue uncollected and undermined anti-blight initiatives around the city. It created a backlog of more than 1,000 tax-delinquent properties that had previously been slated for sale.\n\nThe sales finally resumed in July 2024 after city lawyers helped draft a new contract with Bid4Assets.\n\nBut the Land Bank, which budgets for land acquisitions each year, says it remains effectively frozen out of sheriff sales. It has not been able to buy land since the COVID-19 shutdown in March 2020.\n\nThe issue has frustrated Brooks, who has been working for years to make sure that community gardens on longtime vacant land are not taken over by developers.\n\nIn 2023, the city set aside $1.2 million to purchase the tax liens to 91 parcels of community gardens from U.S. Bank. The bank owned the liens as a result of a failed city initiative in 1997 to raise money for the school district.\n\nOnce the city purchased the liens, the next steps would be for the Land Bank to exercise its priority bid at a sheriff sale and formally take ownership of the lots for a nominal fee, then transfer them to organizations like the Pennsylvania Horticultural Society.\n\n“In Mayor Parker’s first budget address, she raised hopes that her administration would work with the sheriff’s office to resume sales and get these lots into the hands of communities,” Brooks said. “But we haven’t seen that happen yet.”\n\nGardens may curb Philly gun violence\n\nSari Bernstein, a staff attorney at the Public Interest Law Center, said community gardens, in addition to providing a source of fresh produce, have been shown to reduce gun violence, improve air quality, and mitigate flooding.\n\n“Until the Land Bank is able to acquire the parcels, there is always going to be a degree of risk to the gardens,” Bernstein said. “It is really important for the functioning of the Land Bank and preservation of green space that the Land Bank be able to exercise its priority bid and acquire these parcels.”\n\nCity Councilmember Jamie Gauthier, who also has been active in the community gardens initiative, said stymieing the Land Bank’s ability to acquire and assemble lots jeopardized other projects as well. At October’s hearing, she floated the idea of “bringing in a third party to see what the problem is.”\n\n“City Council gave the Land Bank the power to cast priority bids, and a budget to buy land, because we understand how important it is to protect community spaces like urban farms, as well as create land assemblages for affordable housing,” Gauthier said last week. “I hope that the Land Bank, sheriff’s office, and Bid4Assets will figure out how to implement the Land Bank’s priority bid as soon as possible.”\n\n» READ MORE: ‘I feel like I’ve been robbed’: The sheriff’s office still has massive delays in processing deeds from auctions.\n\nMeanwhile, other sheriff sales have been beset with delays. Banks, real estate agents, construction financiers, and individual buyers say are still waiting eight months or longer to get copies of deeds after winning auctions. That process used to take six to eight weeks.\n\nDaniel Bernheim, a lawyer who represents an investor and lender to commercial developers. had to sue the sheriff’s office last year to obtain deeds for his client.\n\nBernheim, who also serves as a Lower Merion commissioner, said the sheriff’s office finally produced the deeds after he filed a notice to have Bilal deposed. He continues to get calls from other buyers who cannot access properties they purchased up to a year ago.\n\n“The sheriff has shown levels of incompetence which are really hard to classify with words,” Bernheim said. “It’s startling to me.”",

        "source": "https://www.inquirer.com/",
        "content": "In a recently published memoir, Havertown psychologist Deborah Derrickson Kossmann explores compulsive hoarding and its impact through what happened inside her own childhood home in Cherry Hill. The decline of her mother’s health marked the start of Kossmann’s journey through mounds of dry cleaning bags, garbage, books, and other accumulated items, piled so high she couldn’t tell where the dining room table was. Her mother had kept hidden the sad reality of how she was living, dealing with her mental health issues, and the shame of her hoarding.\n\nBelow is an excerpt from the first chapter of her book, “Lost Found Kept: A Memoir,” lightly edited for length:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt’s a hot and sticky day in early July 2016 when I pull up and park in front of the house in Cherry Hill, looking around to make sure my mother’s dinged-up Toyota isn’t parked in the crumbling driveway. Old mail, circulars, and some plastic bags seep out of the closed garage door. A waterlogged pile of newspapers is solidified near the empty trash can beside the house. The front door is covered with ivy, and I can barely see past the untrimmed arborvitae for a glimpse of the envelopes stuffed in the mailbox which hangs by one hook off the brick wall. All the window shades are closed. The living room windows are blocked by overgrown evergreen bushes that twist and turn against the house, hiding what’s inside.\n\nI’m feeling wilted from the humid New Jersey summer and tired after the 50-minute drive from Havertown, where I live. I’m glad my mother is not home, so I can get out of the car. Over the past 20 years or so, I would occasionally drive by the house on a stealth mission to see how it looked. I’d never linger, fearing she’d pop out and yell at me because I came by without her explicit permission. Nobody just “stops by” this house. My mother won’t let anyone come near the outside, much less invite them in. The day she had her first breast cancer surgery 17 years ago, she was waiting at the curb, bag packed, for me to take her to the hospital. Neither my younger sister, who lives nearby in Medford, nor I, have been allowed to have a key for years. I have not been inside my childhood home since 1987.\n\nI don’t want to be here now. Absentmindedly, I start my old habit of picking at the flesh on my thumb. I heard the question someone asks when I tell them about this. How is it possible you haven’t seen the inside of your mother’s house for almost 30 years?\n\n“Well, it’s complicated,” I’d always answer. “You don’t know my mother.” Until today, keeping my mother’s secret has been mostly convenient for my sister and me, even though it’s strange to other people.\n\nThrough the years, Melissa and I have talked about what we will find when we’re finally able to enter the house. The carcass of our old cat, Samantha? Hidden treasure like piles of crisp $100 bills pressed under her mattress? Our husbands, who have never been inside, tease us after a few beers that they are just going to take matters into their own hands and “burn it down” when the time comes. My sister and I joke that if my mother dies, we hope it will happen when she’s not at her house, so at least we’d be notified about it. There’s worry beneath our laughter. We’ve respected her autonomy. It’s her right to live as she chooses, including her decision to not allow anyone inside. But over the past year, there have been a series of incidents. First, there was her hospitalization for frostbitten diabetic feet after she shoveled the end of the driveway during a snowstorm. Then, there was the matter of her landline phone being turned off several times. Finally, she’s told my brother-in-law Ron that she’s running out of money. As I look at the filthy windows, I’m asking, were we wrong to let her live the way she wanted? Should we have done something sooner?\n\n» READ MORE: Hoarding is the only mental-health condition that becomes more common as people age.\n\nIt was never a bad house: three bedrooms, one and a half baths, an attic, kitchen, living room, dining room, and rec room downstairs next to a laundry room by the back door. A simple white split-level with some brick on the lower half, it had black shutters and a black front door. My mother placed a big brass knocker over a piece of wood 40 years ago to cover up the window and make the door more secure and private so you couldn’t see in.\n\nBack then she did projects. And the house looked like all the other ones in the development, freshly painted, with a well-groomed lawn. The attached garage was big enough for a car and a clothes dryer, with some room left over for our bikes. The front porch was decorated with a frog statue and a frog planter with a geranium in it. Today I can see the planter from my car window, above the broken steps, empty of flowers and shoved back in the corner of the landing.\n\nI walk up the driveway and around the side of the house. An unpruned tree leans over the chain-link fence that somehow has been bent downward so the gate to the backyard doesn’t work. I push back some big branches to squeeze myself through, trying not to tear my dress. A mosquito bites my bare calf, and I slap it, cursing.\n\nI was supposed to be at a party this afternoon with my husband, Marc, but when I called my mother this morning to wish her a happy 82nd birthday, I found her landline was disconnected for the fourth time in six months. My sister is out of town, so I have no way to tell my mother that our plans to celebrate her birthday tomorrow have changed except to drive 20 miles over here and leave her a handwritten message.\n\nI slap another mosquito and step over more and more of those lumpy piles of newspapers that obstruct the path and are moldering into cement against the back wall of the house. Where once there was a yard with my mother’s carefully planted flowers, now there is a jungle. I loved the pink, red, and yellow roses that separated our yard from the neighbor’s. It was my job to water those roses in the summer. I used to help weed around juniper shrubs on the little hill by the driveway, spread out in a pretty way so you wouldn’t have to mow there.\n\nI take a deep breath. Do I really want to go further? I don’t have another way of communicating with her, so I don’t feel like I have much choice. I’ve come this far today, so there’s no point in backing out. I’ll confess, I’m curious. What is it like here?\n\nNeither my younger sister, who lives nearby in Medford, nor I, have been allowed to have a key for years. I have not been inside my childhood home since 1987. Deborah Derrickson Kossmann, \"Lost Found Kept: A Memoir\"\n\nThere’s an empty blue recycling bin blocking the back door, and when I move it, I see most of the storm door’s glass is gone. I open it and notice the door to the inside has broken glass, too, as though someone has put a fist through it. My mother has stuffed this door with yellowing newspaper and heavy, shredded plastic sheets. Mosquitos are starting to swarm out of the bin which is full of stagnant water, and I’m sweating and slapping them away from my face.\n\nI’ve prepared a birthday card, which I’ve placed back into its plastic sleeve because it’s supposed to rain, and I’m planning to tape it to the back door. My message inside the card is gentle. “Happy Birthday. Your phone is out again. Please call me about the time we are meeting tomorrow.”\n\nWhat I really wanted to write is, Why did I have to give up my plans and drive all the way here to reach you, and why can’t you just pay your phone bill like a normal person, so I don’t have to do things like slink around my old house like a criminal? But as a private practice psychologist I know how to use words that don’t escalate situations.\n\nTwenty years ago, at a lunch, my mother turned to me and hissed, “I know you’ve been sneaking around the backyard trying to get in.” I was shocked at the time since nothing could have been further from my mind than going back to this house. It had taken years of my own therapy to be able to leave it behind. Her paranoia was something I learned to tiptoe away from slowly, the way you would avoid a grizzly bear standing up on its hind legs. I’d never been sure when it would chase me down and devour me. I denied I’d been back, and she looked at me with disbelief. She will know I’ve been here now. And she’ll know I’ve been “snooping” around because the last time my sister left her a note, she’d stuck it on the garage out front.\n\nI keep looking over my shoulder. It’s creepy behind the house under the gray sky, even though it’s mid-afternoon on a Saturday.\n\n“Who lives like this?” I say out loud.\n\n» READ MORE: What drives the need to keep stuff?\n\nI look at the wrecked door and start to tear up. Something is taking shape in the July humidity — a resolve, a rage, a sadness, a fear I don’t fully understand. It’s about what might be inside, but also what this house is telling me about my mother. I’ve seen pictures of houses like this. The dirty, covered windows, the tall weeds blooming all over the yard, the unopened mail — all signs of a life unraveling. I don’t know what I should do about the way my mother is living. But it’s clear to me that Melissa and I need to do something. My mother raised us. She was the parent who was there.\n\nDeborah Derrickson Kossmann is a psychologist in private practice in Havertown and the author of Lost Found Kept: A Memoir, published by Trio House Press in early 2025.

        "source": "https://www.inquirer.com/",
        "content": "Phillies pitcher Zack Wheeler throws the baseball in the first inning during a spring training game against Detroit Tigers at BayCare Ballpark in Clearwater, Fla., on Saturday, March 15, 2025. Read more\n\nCLEARWATER, Fla. — You wouldn’t have known it Saturday by watching Zack Wheeler and Tarik Skubal in a matchup that scintillates whether it’s March or September, but baseball has a starting pitching problem.\n\nAcross the sport, starters have never been asked to do less. They throw fewer pitches per start, make fewer starts per season, and, in a related trend, get injured more often. Even the champion Dodgers resorted to an opener in Game 4 of the World Series because they nearly ran out of healthy starters.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt has gotten so bad that Max Scherzer, among the best pitchers of this generation, recently proposed in separate interviews with The Athletic and Sports Illustrated a set of new rules designed to restore the value of the starter.\n\n» READ MORE: Do Phillies hitters have to change their approach? Here’s Kevin Long’s plan for each.\n\nAaron Nola has a better idea.\n\n“If we want starters to go deep in the games, we’ve got to teach it,” said Nola, the Phillies’ workhorse. “You’ve just got to do it, and it starts in the minor leagues. I think that [teams] baby some guys too much, and they just need to let them pitch and need monitor them so much. I’ve had talks with people, and a guy’s been in the major leagues three, four years starting and he hasn’t got to 200 innings. They say, ‘Oh well, he threw 150 innings last year.’ OK, well, when are you going to do it?”\n\nAs much as any organization, the Phillies prioritize volume from starters under pitching coach Caleb Cotham.\n\nSince 2020, the season before Cotham got hired, Nola has worked 850 innings, more than any pitcher in the majors. Wheeler ranks second at 829⅓. Last year, the Phillies pushed Cristopher Sánchez to a career-high 181⅔ innings. Their starters collectively logged 903 innings, fourth-most of any team, and accounted for five of the 28 complete games in the majors.\n\n“It’s a mindset thing,” Wheeler said after yielding two unearned runs in five innings of a 2-2 tie against the Skubal-led Tigers. “It’s seeing the guy the day before you compete and do well going deep into a game and wanting to kind of top that, or whatever it may be. It’s kind of just the standard over here that we go deep in the game.”\n\nNot every team applies that standard. Most clubs optimize for velocity over stamina. In 2014, there were 2,113 instances of a starter throwing at least 100 pitches in a game. Last season, there were 635.\n\nScherzer, a future Hall of Famer and influential voice within the players’ union, has come up with rules to incentivize teams to let their starters pitch. His plan: If a starter doesn’t meet any of three thresholds — six innings, 100 pitches, or four runs allowed — his team will lose the designated hitter.\n\n» READ MORE: These three Phillies face uncertain futures beyond 2025. Let’s examine the outlook for each to return.\n\nNola appreciates the change that Scherzer is trying to bring about. He just wishes it wasn’t necessary.\n\n“I get where that’s coming from. I understand that part of it,” Nola said. “But I feel like it should never get down to that, you know? I think they should go back to the old ways of teaching rather than having to implement rules to do it.\n\n“Because if I’m a fan and I don’t really get to go to many games and I want to go watch Kyle Schwarber hit, and he hits once because the pitcher didn’t do so-and-so … I don’t know. I don’t think that should be part of the game if we really care about fans.”\n\nNola, who turns 32 in June, is as old school as it comes. He hasn’t ever lit up the radar gun (he ranked in the 20th percentile in average fastball velocity last season) but rather has been both effective and durable by mixing pitches and locating them with precision.\n\nWheeler, who turns 35 in May, has more electric stuff. But he also uses spring training to develop new pitches. In 2023, he added a sweeper slider. Last year, it was a splitter. This spring, he has reincorporated a cutter as a potential weapon to throw down and in to left-handed hitters.\n\nAgainst the Tigers, Wheeler said he threw 10 or 11 cutters.\n\n“I still throw it in the bullpens and stuff like that, just trying to perfect it,” Wheeler said. “It’s been working, so now we’re trying to bring it back just to open up another pitch.”\n\nIf anything, it helps enable Wheeler to get through a batting order three, sometimes even four times, a foreign concept to most starters.\n\n» READ MORE: How important is batting order? As the Phillies experiment with their lineup, let’s look at the numbers.\n\n“It’s [a matter of] wanting to do it,” Nola said. “It’s how we were taught. It’s how we came up, what we were told we’re supposed to do. We all pitch. We all focus on the art of pitching. I’m not a guy that throws 95 to 100. I have to pitch. If I don’t pitch, I’m going to get shellacked. That’s why I’ve always tried to work on command. It all goes back to that, and it will always go back to that, in my opinion.”\n\nAnd if only teams would revert to that philosophy with their starters, there would be no need for Scherzer’s new rules.\n\nExtra bases\n\nRanger Suárez made his scheduled start in a back-field scrimmage rather than in a Grapefruit League game. He threw 60 pitches in four innings. … The Phillies reassigned reliever Koyo Aoyagi to minor league camp. He will open the season in triple A. Thomson said the Phillies convinced him to ditch a slower delivery from the windup and use only the quicker one that he typically goes to with runners on base. “Our hitters taking BP off him said they can’t time him up,” Thomson said. “So he’s going to use that a lot more.” … Utility infielder Rodolfo Castro, lefty Nick Vespi, and right-handers Jose Cuas, Joel Kuhnel, John McMillon, and Guillo Zuñiga also were reassigned. There are 41 players left in camp. … The Phillies honored former manager (and 1980 third base coach) Lee Elia in a pregame ceremony. Elia, 87, an Olney High graduate, attended with family, friends, and a guest list that included Lou Piniella and Pat Gillick.",

        "content": "In a plot fit for an Indiana Jones film, Nazi U-boats once ferried saboteurs to the United States, dropping them off in rubber dinghies along the East Coast under cover of darkness.\n\nTheir mission was dubbed “Operation Pastorius” and targets included factories, plants, and rail lines — namely Altoona’s famous “Horseshoe Curve,” a railroad engineering marvel built in 1854 vital to the U.S. shipments of steel, medicine, rations, and even troops.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe saboteurs, who landed in Long Island and Jacksonville, Fla., had also set their sights on Newark’s Penn Station and a cryolite metals plant in Philadelphia.\n\n“I figured they were spies when the first man said he didn’t want to kill me,” a Coast Guardsman who encountered some of the Germans in Long Island testified in 1942.\n\nIt’s unclear how close the eight Germans, who had all lived in the United States before, came to destroying Horseshoe Curve, a National Historic Landmark. According to a 2014 Inquirer article, the Nazis named “Operation Pastorius” after Francis Daniel Pastorius, the German-born Quaker lawyer and poet who founded the settlement of Germantown.\n\nInformants\n\nJared Frederick, a history professor at Penn State Altoona, said the FBI conducted a series of raids in the Blair County town in the summer of 1942, the same day President Franklin Delano Roosevelt issued a military tribunal for the saboteurs.\n\n“Based on the research I’ve done, I’m of the mind that these men had informants and contacts of some nature here,” he said.\n\nAccording to a 1942 Philadelphia Inquirer article, 100 people were taken into custody during the raids in Altoona and other cities in Pennsylvania and New Jersey for hearings before the “Enemy Alien Boards.” The majority of those rounded up, The Inquirer reported, were Germans.\n\n“There were 200 homes raided here as far as we can gather,” Frederick said. “One of the FBI agents told the New York Times Altoona was part of his investigation because there was a phone call or telegram from Altoona to the New York apartment where the ringleaders were staying.”\n\nOne of their main contacts in the U.S., according to the 2014 article, was the Rev. Carl Emil Ludwig Krepper, a Lutheran pastor who served in South Jersey and Philadelphia.\n\nKrepper had allowed “Nazi ideology to pervert his sense of calling,” according to a fellow pastor who wrote “The Nazi Spy Pastor: Carl Krepper and the War in America.”\n\n“My heart is still in Germany,” Krepper allegedly told an undercover FBI agent.\n\nCold feet and the FBI\n\nTwo of the eight saboteurs, according to Frederick, got cold feet and may not have been true believers in Hitler. One of them, George John Dasch, allegedly called the FBI to report the plot.\n\n“They didn’t believe him,” Frederick said.\n\nSix of the eight saboteurs were given the death penalty.\n\nDasch, according to a 1980 investigation by the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, expected a presidential pardon but went to federal prison instead. He died in Germany and some have suggested his actions were heroic, that turning in his coconspirators saved American lives.\n\nThe Horseshoe Curve\n\nAltoona’s Horseshoe Curve, still in use today, was built to get around the towering front of the Allegheny Mountains, which blocked the westward advance of the railroad. The mountains were too dense to tunnel through and too steep to go over. According to Altoona’s Railroaders Museum, engineers used “switchbacks, excavations, and pure innovation” along with Irish immigrant muscle, to build the unique, 220-degree arc.\n\nThe curve took three years to build and upon completion, the museum said it was considered one of the “eight engineering marvels of the world.”\n\n“It was known the world over,” Frederick said.\n\nFrederick figures the saboteurs would have utilized dynamite to destroy the rail lines or create massive rockslides from the mountains around it. He doubts either technique would have knocked the horseshoe out for good. While some believed destroying the curve could have tipped World War II to the Axis powers, Frederick thinks it would have mostly damaged America’s psyche.\n\n“It would have delayed troops supplies, medicine, and domestic goods. It really would have thrown a wrench in the works,” he said. “I think the damage was meant to be psychological, though, to create paranoia, and have people looking over their shoulders and question the ability of their government to protect them.”\n\nVisitors to the “Railroad City,” about 235 miles west of Philadelphia, can view the Horseshoe Curve from a visitors center and lookout. There’s also a minor-league baseball team called the “Curve” and some questionable pizza there.\n\nAmtrak’s Pennsylvanian line travels along the Horseshoe Curve once daily, with several stops between New York City and Pittsburgh, including Philadelphia.",

        "title": "Mehmet Oz testifies before Senate committee, won’t commit to opposing cuts to the Medicaid program he would run",
        "source": "https://www.inquirer.com/",
        "content": "Dr. Mehmet Oz, President Donald Trump's pick to lead the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, testifies at his confirmation hearing in Washington Friday. Read more\n\nCelebrity doctor and former Pennsylvania Senate candidate Mehmet Oz told senators he has the experience and reform ideas necessary to bring down the cost of health care and make Americans healthier in a hearing on Capitol Hill that showcased the former TV host’s penchant for charismatic salesmanship.\n\n“My TV audience has heard me say this many times, but many of you are too busy to watch television so I’ll repeat it,” Oz said in a hearing before the Senate Finance Committee on Friday. “I believe that a physician has the responsibility to tell patients what they need to know, even if the message is uncomfortable.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOz then ran down a list of woeful statistics, including the nation’s obesity rate and maternal mortality rate.\n\n“Those chronic diseases made it easy to be sick in America,” he said.\n\nOz’s testimony before a committee of senators was the first step in securing the votes to become head of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). The agency oversees the coordination and implementation of major health-care programs such as Medicare, Medicaid, the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP), and the Affordable Care Act. Taken together, CMS oversees health insurance coverage for nearly half of all Americans and a budget of about $1.5 trillion annually.\n\nPresident Donald Trump announced Oz as his pick for the position in November, but the Senate committees scheduled all cabinet-level position hearings first, completing the process with the confirmation of Labor Secretary Lori Chavez-DeRemer on Tuesday.\n\nThe two-hour hearing was largely cordial as Oz, who has spent most of his career in TV, gave calm, polished answers to how he’d run the agency and suggested new technologies, regulatory changes, and increased investments could bring down rising health-care costs and make the system more efficient and beneficial for patients that rely on it.\n\nQuestions over cuts to Medicaid\n\nThe most popular question from Democrats was whether Oz would protect Medicaid from cuts that they anticipate as Congress finds a way to meet a GOP-led resolution that requires $880 billion in slashes to the federal budget. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has said some of those cuts would inevitably have to come from Medicaid.\n\n“Would you agree this morning to oppose any cuts to the Medicaid program? Yes or no?” Sen. Ron Wyden (D., Ore.) asked at the start of the hearing.\n\n“I want to make sure patients today, and in the future, have resources to protect them. The way you protect Medicaid is by making sure that it’s viable at every level,” Oz said.\n\n» READ MORE: Trump’s nomination put Mehmet Oz back in the political spotlight — and on track to oversee health care for more than 160 million Americans\n\nLater, Sen. Maggie Hassan (D., N.H.) asked Oz: “How many children losing health insurance would be acceptable?”\n\n“I don’t want children losing health insurance,” Oz said.\n\n“Well then you’re going to need to reject the Republican budget plan,” Hassan said.\n\nOz, a Republican, and longtime television personality, made his foray into politics when he ran an unsuccessful campaign for Senate in 2022 against now-Sen. John Fetterman (D., Pa.). His residency became a major theme of the campaign then, given he relocated from New Jersey to run for the seat. Oz still owns a house in Bryn Athyn where his wife, Lisa Lemole Oz, has family and a mega-successful tree pruning company, Asplundh Tree Expert LLC.\n\nVoting records also show Oz voted in Montgomery County in the presidential election last year.\n\nTrump endorsed Oz in the 2022 GOP primary and this week nominated Oz’s son-in-law, John Jovanovic, to head the Export-Import Bank of the United States, the country’s official export credit agency. Jovanovic sat with his wife, TV host and food writer Daphne Oz, behind her father during the hearing.\n\nIn an introduction to the Senate committee, Oz touted his work as a cardiologist, developing medical devices, and his 11 Emmys on The Dr. Oz Show. He said he wanted to address rising health-care expenditures, and noted that Medicaid is the biggest expense for the federal government in most states.\n\n‘You’re a very nice person’\n\nDemocrats on the committee had sent several scathing letters to Oz ahead of the hearing, expressing concern that he wanted to replace traditional Medicare with the privatized Medicare Advantage program, calling out anti-abortion comments he’s made, and questioning whether he’d personally evaded paying Social Security and Medicare taxes.\n\nBut the hearing itself was rarely contentious and Oz was an affable witness, bringing up anecdotes about individual senators’ states or conversations he’d had with them.\n\n“Maybe you’ll invite me down to your church sometime,” Oz said to Georgia Sen. Raphael Warnock (D., Ga.) after a conversation about how burdensome getting reenrolled in Medicaid can be.\n\n“You’re invited any Sunday,” Warnock said. “You can’t preach, but you can come.”\n\nSen. Peter Welch, a Democrat from Vermont, told Oz he wants a CMS administrator who can stand up for patient needs. “You’re a very nice person,” Welch said. “I don’t want you to be nice when dealing with this stuff.”\n\nWhile Oz showed he knows the often complex world of insurance and health care, some of his proposed solutions to big problems were relatively simple.\n\nAsked about the nation’s nursing shortage, he mentioned the benefits of Telehealth. Asked about reforming payment programs and issues with prior authorization, he said he’d look to deal with the 12% of the CMS budget spent on “administrative costs.”\n\nThe graduate of the University of Pennsylvania’s business and medical schools, who went on to do a cardiothoracic surgery residency at Columbia, acquiesced that some of the products promoted on his TV show were falsely hyped. During a line of questioning from Hassan, he acknowledged that Green Coffee Extract had been falsely marketed as a “miracle weight loss drug.”\n\nIf confirmed, Oz would report to Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who Oz commended in his opening remarks. But frustration with Kennedy, who has cast doubt on the efficacy of childhood vaccines, was apparent among some Democrats. Sen. Ben Luján (D., N.M.) asked Oz if he believed the measles vaccine is safe and the most effective way to prevent against infection.\n\nOz answered in the affirmative, but acknowledged the limited power he’d have in the position over such matters.\n\n“It is but if I could mention ... CMS should not be opining its own opinion or thoughts on vaccines,” Oz said. “Our job is to follow the rules so if the CDC is making decisions about the use of a vaccine ... my job is to ensure we pay for those vaccines.”\n\nNow, Oz awaits further written questions from the committee and a vote in the coming weeks. Every one of Trump’s nominees that made it to a hearing has been confirmed in the Senate, which has a six-seat Republican majority. Oz is likely to clear the process as well.\n\nIf he does, he’ll likely be the most recognizable name ever to hold the position — and the only one with a square on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.\n\n“The experience you bring to this job is almost unprecedented,” Republican Sen. Steve Daines, of Montana, said. “You’re exactly the right person at the right time to take over this huge responsibility.”\n\nThis article was updated to accurately reflect Mehmet Oz’s medical schooling.",

        "title": "After firing Kyle Neptune, Villanova needs a dynamic leader",
        "source": "https://www.inquirer.com/",
        "content": "NEW YORK — At the moment that erased any doubt that his season and his career as Villanova’s head coach would soon be over, Kyle Neptune was hunched over with his hands on his knees near midcourt at Madison Square Garden, assuming a stance similar to someone exhausted from a race he couldn’t even finish.\n\nConnecticut’s Samson Johnson was twirling in an acrobatic and-one layup over Jhamir Brickus, the Huskies’ lead stretching to 11 points with less than three minutes left in regulation late Thursday night, and Neptune couldn’t have been better positioned for the bad news ahead of him. Not just a 73-56 loss, not just a third straight season that ended short of the Big East tournament semifinals and without an NCAA Tournament berth, but the bigger, broader ramifications.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere was Villanova, heading home early again. There was Neptune, bent at the waist and unable to stop another Wildcats collapse. There he was in a black shirt, a black suit, and black sneakers. He had dressed appropriately for his own coaching funeral.\n\n» READ MORE: Villanova fires its men’s basketball coach Kyle Neptune\n\nA lack of identity\n\nYou didn’t have to be a plugged-in newsbreaker to know that Saturday’s announcement that Villanova was firing Neptune was inevitable. Too many trends and tides were rolling in the same direction. Too many whispers were leaking from within the university community, from inside the program itself, to think Neptune’s tenure would last any longer. For now, assistant Mike Nardi will serve as interim head coach for the remainder of this season if Villanova accepts an invitation for postseason play, most notably the College Basketball Crown tournament later this month.\n\nVillanova recently hired a new athletic director, Eric Roedl, and athletic directors like to have a say in who gets hired to be in charge of a department’s flagship program. Whatever hope Neptune had of hanging on evaporated amid a series of squandered leads and excruciating, avoidable losses, and Thursday night’s was only the latest and last: a five-point lead at halftime, a tie game with eight minutes to go, a 17-point final score following a late-game fade.\n\nThe Wildcats had the talent to win 25 games this season, and they should have won 25 games this season. They went 19-14 instead, and no coach survives when his team falls so short of expectations. When asked about Neptune’s status immediately after Thursday’s game, Roedl said, “I don’t want to talk about it.” But in late November, on the day Villanova introduced him, he had laid out the criteria he would use to evaluate Neptune’s performance.\n\n“There are a number of things,” Roedl said then, “that go into evaluating programs and coaches: the academic performance of the student-athletes, the culture of the program, the trajectory in recruiting, obviously on-the-court results, community engagement. Are people engaged? Are people excited? Are we selling tickets? Are we raising money? Those are all things that go into evaluating a program.”\n\nBy those benchmarks, Villanova needs to improve and improve fast. Indifference hovers like a nimbus cloud over the program, and Neptune contributed to that atmosphere not merely through his 54-47 record and his inability to guide the Wildcats to the NCAAs but through how he carried himself publicly and privately.\n\nHis one year’s worth of head coaching experience, a .500 season at Fordham, and his eight years under Jay Wright provided no clues about how he’d fare once he took over at Villanova, and he and his teams mostly were a mystery. He seemed deathly afraid of saying anything interesting or revealing, let alone colorful or controversial, and that blandness bled onto the court.\n\nWas the task of melding the holdovers who remembered the Wright way — Eric Dixon and Jordan Longino — with the newcomers who had less invested in the program’s traditions too much for him? The laughing, smiling, and smartphone-checking in the Villanova locker room early Friday morning, immediately after the UConn loss, suggested it might have been.\n\nWhat were his coaching philosophies? The Wildcats were disjointed so often that he seemed not to have any — his decisions reactive, not proactive, and frequently a tick too late. Was there anything about his style or system that was his own, or was everything he did just derivative of some vague concept called Villanova basketball?\n\nNeptune was, in so many ways, a blank slate, and no college basketball program with aspirations of competing for championships in a major conference can have a coach who doesn’t have a strong identity — or, in Neptune’s case, barely had one at all. At no time did he project the image of a man who actually enjoyed his job. From the moment he was hired until he was fired, he coached the Wildcats as if, given a choice, he wouldn’t, as if he were doing so out of a sense of obligation — as if succeeding Wright were a penance of some kind.\n\nHe and the program certainly suffered. Maybe it was.\n\nBreaking from the past\n\nWhat Villanova should not do, cannot do, is hire another coach with direct ties to Wright, to fall back on someone who apprenticed under or learned from him. It will be a tempting move because it’s always tempting to assume that anyone who has come in contact with a great coach has been sprinkled with some of the magic dust that made that icon’s career so special.\n\nAt his best, though, Wright was college basketball’s answer to Bill Belichick. He was the nerve center of the entire program. He did everything, and that immersion made being on his staff a less-than-ideal training ground for becoming a head coach.\n\nNeptune, Billy Lange, Ashley Howard, Patrick Chambers, Joe Jones, Baker Dunleavy — the spotty results of Wright’s former assistants parallel those of Charlie Weis, Romeo Crennel, Matt Patricia, and other Belichick disciples who struggled once an NFL owner or NCAA athletic director handed them a measure of control they’d never had before.\n\nThere’s another reason, too, for Villanova to refrain from inspecting the branches of Wright’s coaching tree for the program’s next leader: Hiring a familiar name will be in line with the university’s culture of staid, incremental change, its hesitancy to deviate from the priorities of its past.\n\nVillanova has long been conservative in its thinking and actions. Even the slightest spark of flashiness or juice in a player’s game would be snuffed out like a flicker of fire. A 360-dunk in practice? Don’t you dare post that highlight on social media. That’s not what this program is about. That’s not Villanova basketball.\n\nBut that approach now risks turning the program from solid and stable to stodgy and old-fashioned, and this new and still-volatile era of college basketball demands boldness and beyond-the-baselines thinking from Villanova and schools like it.\n\nThe Wildcats have had four head coaches over the last 52 years, and those four form a smooth line of succession: Rollie Massimino gave way to Steve Lappas, who had been one of Massimino’s assistants. Lappas gave way to Wright, who worked under Massimino and with Lappas. Wright gave way to Neptune, who worked under Wright. That history is revealing for what Villanova — not its alumni and boosters and students and fans, but its decision-makers — wants from its men’s basketball program.\n\nWright’s four Final Fours and two national championships were blasts of brilliant sunshine for a university leadership that would be content with a slightly dimmer landscape. If the Wildcats won 20-25 games, threatened to break the NCAA Tournament bubble every year, and did little else that called attention to the program, president Rev. Peter Donohue and the rest of Villanova’s administration likely would be satisfied.\n\nThe problem is that in the world of name, image, and likeness of athletes having unfettered freedom, even that standard is harder to meet for a private Catholic university competing in the Big East. Kyle Neptune couldn’t meet it. Jay Wright saw what was coming and declined to try.\n\nStill, the course of action for the university, in a college athletics landscape that will soon stop shifting so much, is pretty clear: Pay for the players and find the right coach to teach and inspire them. This is the lowest Villanova basketball has been in at least a generation, and it will take a dynamic leader to get the program and everyone in it standing up straight and tall again.",

        "content": "Content creator and podcaster Brandon \"Bran Flakezz\" Edelman gets ready to record an episode of his \"Between Us Girlies\" podcast in Kensington. Read more\n\nIt’s clear from the videos of his wild nights at the Gayborhood’s U Bar, stories of his on-and-off-again situationships, and recaps of his impromptu trips to Napa Valley, Philly influencer Brandon Edelman has unleashed his “gay chaos” onto the world.\n\n“Gay chaos is being unapologetically you,” Edelman said. “Living life to the fullest without fear of judgment, and celebrating the little things that make you different. And doing it in a chaotic and gay way.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBetter known as Bran Flakezz on TikTok, Edelman is living the kind of untethered lifestyle he’s always wanted, and bringing his followers and fellow “Philly girlies” along for the ride.\n\nAlong with his best friends Lindsay Anderson, Casey Corradin, and Bailey Witherspoon, Edelman is the cohost of the hot-gossip podcast Between Us Girlies. Every Thursday, the four besties meet to share their most exhilarating (and messiest) highlights from the previous week, sparing little detail on their celebrity sightings, make-out sessions, or crazed party moments.\n\nThe podcast is one of Philly’s more popular lifestyle pods, with over 65,000 followers on TikTok. Among its most famous guests is Gov. Josh Shapiro, who the hosts have crowned the show’s “fifth honorary girlie.”\n\nEdelman, an Abington Township native, grew up idolizing the stars of MTV’s Jersey Shore, Big Brother, and The Real World and was determined to make it big as a reality star. The Philadelphia University (now Thomas Jefferson University) grad submitted audition videos and applications, only to realize that most of the people on the shows were already successful content creators.\n\nHe decided to turn his life into a reality show of his own. In January 2021, Edelman downloaded TikTok, and began ranking his late-night escapades.\n\n“I was 24 years old, living with my best friend. I am single, I have access to all of these bars, and I have enough money to pay bills. I went f— crazy,” Edelman said. “I was partying every weekend, and just living the life I always wanted to live. Then I was sharing it on [TikTok].”\n\nA year later, he gained over 200,000 followers and was able to quit his $20-an-hour job as a merchandise assistant at Anthropologie to live the life of a full-time creator.\n\nWhile he landed on the short-lived competition show Project Verified in 2023, Edelman was no longer interested in reality-show stardom. His focus was on building his own brand, on his terms, and bringing his friends along for the journey.\n\n“Working for myself has kind of surprised me,” he said. “I have to pinch myself like, ‘Brandon, this is your life, and you’ve created it.’ It’s a feeling that gives me warmth in my heart.”\n\nBut none of this has come easy. Anderson, who’s been friends with Edelman since the two cohosts were 5, said the detractors he faces online today are similar to the bullies he faced in middle and high school for being queer. But as he’s grown more comfortable in his skin, and learned to manage his anxiety-fueled panic attacks, he’s been able to fully bask in his identity. “He’s fearless,” Anderson said. “He’s not afraid to be who he is.”\n\nThat same fearless attitude drove him to the front door of Chubby Chicks, a brunch spot that recently expanded to a store at 11th and Walnut Streets. After hearing owner Shakeira Turner was facing harassment and discrimination from residents on the block, Edelman stopped by to support the newly opened eatery.\n\nHis video amassed more than 10 million views and support for Turner. “He was just so genuine,” Turner said. “He basically made Chubby Chicks what it is now. Just the overwhelming support, the overwhelming amount of guests and new customers, and made people who may not have cared see me.”\n\nDays later, Edelman made a video about Pure Green, a Black woman-operated juice bar in Center City that was on the verge of closing its doors. After donating $3,000 of his own, Edelman asked his followers to chip in. One million views later, the video helped exceed the shop’s $70,000 fundraising goal by over $20,000.\n\n“I’ve always wanted to highlight amazing small businesses, especially in Philly,” Edelman said. “Black women have always been a voice that has made me feel comfortable. … And it just broke my heart when I heard their stories.”\n\nPure Green Philly owner Tiara Council made several videos thanking Edelman for spearheading the fundraising effort, which helped her secure additional staff and kept her storefront lights running.\n\n“I woke up from a nightmare to a dream so fast,” Council said. “It’s the worst feeling to know something you’ve worked toward for years could be taken away in a matter of months. That was painful. But now, business has been wonderful. Community is protecting me right now.”\n\nFor Edelman, this fight to save local businesses is personal: his father owned a hoagie shop in Kensington for nearly 30 years, and his mom ran a small consignment store in the area.\n\nAs he continues to expand his following and reach as a content creator, Edelman hopes he can reward his parents with a beach house on the Jersey Shore. His local loyalty runs deep.\n\n“I always said I don’t want to be a Philly influencer. I want to be an influencer that lives in Philly.

        "content": "Will Vogler, an Ardmore resident, stands by a doorway to his unfinished Earthship in Tamaqua, Schuylkill County. Read more\n\nTAMAQUA, Pa. — At first glance, the long glass building on a sun-soaked hillside in this rural Schuylkill County town is obviously a greenhouse.\n\nIt’s a home too, though, in the vein of The Hobbit, or will be in a few more years, builder Will Vogler said. It’s also a natural heating and cooling system and a water filtration plant off the grid, in the woods. Vogler calls his 80-foot-by-50-foot building the “Tamaqua Sustainability Project,” inspired by a decades-old architecture developed in the high desert of New Mexico.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“When I look at it, I see an engine, ” the Ambler resident said beside his project.\n\nThat’s what Mike Reynolds, a 78-year-old architect, intended when he created the first “Earthship” with old beer cans and used tires in Taos in 1979.\n\nPeople made fun of his dream for decades.\n\n“I was the crazy hippie in the desert building houses out of garbage,” Reynolds told The Inquirer. “I was ridiculed and abused. I even lost my architecture license in one state.”\n\nA combination of climate change, catastrophic weather events, water scarcity, and power grid failures have cast the Earthship “biotecture” in a new light, however. Reynolds said there’s about 3,000 already built, globally, some as far as New Zealand and Australia. He’s still building more in a 630-acre subdivision in Taos and said they’re all sold before they’re finished.\n\n“The world went to hell in a handbag and people began to look to us for an alternative,” he said.\n\nToday, Reynolds thinks there’s no structure better designed to combat climate change and survive in it than the Earthship.\n\nBad weather and power outages compelled Vogler, a father of three who works in software, to delve into sustainable living.\n\n“Hurricane Sandy, in particular, was really eye-opening,” he said. “It seemed like there was quite a few storms for a time, one after another. We live in a wooded area and having our power going out all the time had me thinking there has to be a better way.”\n\nVogler, a Penn State graduate, dabbled in generators but was surprised at how little they could actually power. He hired organic farmers to turn his backyard into an edible landscape and, after learning about Earthship biotecture picked their brains about building a greenhouse in that style.\n\n“They had no clue what I was talking about,” he said.\n\nVogler kept researching and connected with seasoned Earthship builders who helped get his project off the ground, or rather, into it. Vogler, 47, and his father, Bill, purchased the 18 acres in Tamaqua about three years ago.\n\nThe permitting and code process has moved slowly, he said. Few officials have seen an Earthship, he said, or dealt with builders who don’t want to connect to the grid.\n\n“It’s just as much a learning process for them,” he said.\n\nVogler has spent about $100,000, recently installing a septic system. He also created a GoFundMe and urges volunteers to visit the property, both for the labor and to learn.\n\nOn this warm Sunday afternoon, a handful of people had traveled to Tamaqua to help Vogler build air intake tunnels with concrete and cans. The tunnels pull in cooler air, pushing the heat out of vents on the Earthship’s roof, making the interior much cooler than expected.\n\nMany of the volunteers were interested going off-grid for good, or having a getaway if needed.\n\n“There’s honestly not a lot of places in Pennsylvania where you can learn how to do this,” said Buddy Light, a Montgomery County native interested in building an Earthship.\n\nThe goal of any Earthship, Vogler said, is to be self-sustaining, with building materials that are recycled. If it’s an engine, it runs on the air, rain, wind, and dirt. He doesn’t consider his project an official Earthship because he isn’t using tires in his building. (The tires make great insulation.) He does have a plenty of cans, though, and walls made of old bottles and cement.\n\n“You’d be crazy to build an Earthship without a bottle wall,” he said.\n\nVogler is hoping to sell off some parcels to like-minded buyers interested in building Earthships too. Those funds would help him finish the project.\n\n“We want to create a community,” he said. “At least three to five other projects here.”\n\nReynolds doesn’t trademark his idea or even ask for licensing fees. He wants the information to spread, “like a virus.”\n\n“People are coming out here in droves from the cities,” he said. “It used to be young hipsters but now it’s conservatives, wealthy families too. Everybody is insecure about the state of things.”\n\nReynolds said the Earthships are too expensive right now, often selling for up to $800,000.\n\n“My whole financial model is treading water. I’m not trying to make a billion dollars,” he said. “I’ve got to have a fleet on the market for under $400,000 or $300,000. We’re going to get into a lease program too.”\n\nFor Vogler, the goal is to live in his Earthship with his family when it’s done.\n\n“It’s odd, really, that more people aren’t doing this,” he said. “This honestly feels like the most rebellious thing I could do.”",

Read more\n\nStart your day with the Philly news you need and the stories you want all in one easy-to-read newsletter\n\nWelcome to Saturday.\n\nIt’s drizzly and cloudy out, and some patchy fog is sticking around. We’ll hit a high of 63 degrees or so.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nToday, I’m talking about the baby chicks in New Jersey who captured the hearts of hundreds of thousands of people across the world. Plus, there’s news on a Montco commissioner asking a billionaire investor for financial assistance at SPS Technologies, what we know about the “box demon” in York County, and the temporary closure of an I-95 South on-ramp to be aware of.\n\n— Paola Pérez (morningnewsletter@inquirer.com)\n\nIf someone forwarded you this email, sign up for free here.\n\nWhat you should know today\n\nEagle cams are nothing new around here. But it’s not enough just to see the birds in action. We want to hear them, too. Thanks to a new audio system at Duke Farms in New Jersey, that is now a reality for the first time in 17 years.\n\nThe public can now watch a budding family of eagles and simultaneously listen to the unmistakable noises of nature from a nest in Somerset County. Over the past two decades, 32 eagle chicks have been raised in and taken flight from this nest. And right now, there are two devoted parents caring for their brood of three. People in and around Philly — and even as far away as Switzerland — are watching and listening to them eat, sleep, chirp, poop, and peck their early days away.\n\nSince reading about the little pip-squeaks through environmental reporter Frank Kummer’s story, I’ve kept a tab open to periodically check on them and it has become my go-to place for a pick-me-up. The livestream has been a nice reprieve from a cycle of happenings in the news and in life that can feel all-consuming. Beyond the soothing sounds of birdcalls in and around the nest, it’s been sweet to tune in to feedings and keep up with wildlife in real time. The more they “talk,” the more they find their voices, growing loud enough for my cat Bonito to perk up his ears toward my laptop screen. I caught one funny moment when a chick, restless below its parent, squirmed to get up and out. Then it turned, aimed, and shot its poop out of the nest. I could only laugh to myself, partially in disbelief. I’d say its guardian was also stunned by what just happened, but that’s probably just its resting eagle face.\n\nPeeping on the cam also took me back to the start of the coronavirus pandemic, which officially began for Americans five years ago this week. Living in Florida at the time, I saw a mourning dove build a nest in a hibiscus plant outside my bedroom window. Soon enough, two bewildered babies were burrowed in it, staring back at me. Checking on the little family became a part of my daily routine. I’d watch them cry out and tussle with their mom for food. With alligators nearby, she was vigilant for predators. I was shocked at how quickly they grew. It was a thrill to watch them set flight and then stumble back on the tree as if to practice, in both timid and courageous fashion. In the midst of the chaos, those little doves grounded me and made it easier to get through difficult days. So it’s no surprise why my colleague calls the audio-packed eagle cam “must-see TV this spring.” You’ll have to watch (and listen) for yourself. And one more thing: Go Birds.\n\nHoarding disorder is characterized by the accumulation of things in an excessive volume, like household goods, craft supplies, and even pets. In extreme cases, homes can become crammed and unsafe. These conditions can also put a strain on relationships.\n\nDeborah Derrickson Kossmann, a Havertown psychologist, recently published a book titled Lost Found Kept: A Memoir, a recount of what happened inside her own childhood home in Cherry Hill. As her mother’s health declined, Kossman was forced to confront the sad reality kept hidden within those walls, a place she had not been inside of since 1987.\n\n“My mother won’t let anyone come near the outside, much less invite them in,” Kossmann writes. “Neither my younger sister, who lives nearby in Medford, nor I, have been allowed to have a key for years.”\n\nRead more in this excerpt from Kossmann’s book.\n\n🧠 Trivia time\n\nWhat is the name of Hulu’s new Philly-inspired comedy show?\n\nA) ABC Deli\n\nB) Deli Boys\n\nC) The Deli Empire\n\nD) Raj and Mir\n\nThink you know?

        "source": "https://www.inquirer.com/",
        "content": "The iconic view of Frank Lloyd Wright's \"Fallingwater\" in Fayette County, Pennsylvania, has a different look these days. Read more\n\nWhen America’s most famous architect built one of the world’s most iconic homes atop a waterfall in Western Pennsylvania, he didn’t leave behind a repair manual.\n\nFrank Lloyd Wright’s 1936 masterpiece, Fallingwater, is a work of art after all, more sculpture than summer house, and it’s brought 6.3 million visitors to rural Fayette County, including Brad Pitt, Angelina Jolie, and Tom Hanks, since it opened for tours in 1964. The work was deemed the “best all-time work of American architecture” in a poll of members of the American Institute of Architects.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA home built atop a stream, that cascades down a mountainside, deep in the woods, at high elevation is bound to need some complicated TLC, though, and when that time arrives, custodians can’t just run to Home Depot.\n\n“Frank Lloyd Wright was pushing all conventional notions of building and living and stretching materials and technologies to their limits when Fallingwater was designed in the 1930s. It stretches every notion of what a house could be,” said Justin Gunther, Fallingwater’s director. “Almost 90 years later, that creates some preservation challenges.\n\nOn a recent, sunny Monday morning, the home was still impressive, even under a massive cocoon of scaffolding, wood framing, and plastic sheeting meant to keep construction workers warm in winter. The ubiquitous sounds of Fallingwater — the waterfalls of Bear Run — was accompanied by the sounds of generators and the beeping alarms of construction vehicles driving in reverse.\n\nFallingwater, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, never underwent a “makeover” but restoration and preservation initiatives are constant and, ideally, seamless with the original design. In 2019, Gunther said Fallingwater began fundraising for repairs to stone walls, flat roofs, flagstone terraces, steel window and door frames, and concrete. Many of those terraces are roofs for other levels of the house, Gunther said, so vigilance against water is ever-present.\n\n“Part of being listed on the UNESCO World Heritage list is that you’re held accountable to preserve at the highest standards,” Gunther said. “If you don’t, then you’re in danger of being removed from that list and losing that designation.”\n\nThe price tag for the multiyear project, Gunther said, is $7 million, a number that grew substantially after the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n“Considering the level of work being done, it’s reasonable,” he said.\n\nWhile many contractors are from the Pittsburgh area, others came in from Maryland and New York. Nick Rothmeyer, owner of Allegheny Roofing & Sheet Metal Co Inc in Pittsburgh, said it’s both “exciting and challenging” to work on Wright’s most recognizable home.\n\n“He was definitely ahead of this time,” Rothmeyer said. “There’s sections of this house that are cantilevered so far out, it wouldn’t seem possible. They’re actually part of a hillside. Nothing in this house was pre-manufcatured in a factory.”\n\nRothmeyer said original lumber from Wright’s era was replaced with pressure-treated wood and his work would advance on that.\n\n“We’ll use marine-grade wood,” he said.\n\nThe restoration will also include some newer technologies — liquid grout injection — that will be unseen to visitors. That grout will be injected into the walls, Gunther said, to fill up all the empty spaces between stones and, ideally, keep water out.\n\n“One way, water finds its way through those voids, down into the walls and into the house,” he said.\n\nThe Kauffman family, which operated a successful department store Pittsburgh, owned the land in Fayette County and used it as a summer getaway for family and employees. The waterfalls of Bear Run were a favorite vantage point for the Kauffmans and when they commissioned Wright to build a summer home on the property, they imagined scenic views of the falling stream, not being a part of it.\n\n“They did give Wright free rein, though, and he convinced them to trust his vision,” Clinton Piper, Fallingwater’s director of special projects, said at the site.\n\nIn an era when most new homes cost less than $5,000, Fallingwater’s final tally cost the Kauffmans a little over $150,000, which would equate to millions in today’s market. Gunther doubts it could be built today.\n\n“They were using local farmers that they trained on the job, and you just wouldn’t be able to do that and, plus, you’d probably never get the building permits anyway,” he said.\n\nFallingwater embraces the preservation as part of the experience, updating its blog frequently.\n\n“The scaffolding, which took nearly three weeks to complete, creates a safe, level area for the preservation crews to waterproof and reroof much of the Main House,” the team wrote in December.\n\nGunther said most of the restoration work at Fallingwater is done in the winter, and the scaffolding will remain for a few more weeks while the last seasonal work continues. That doesn’t mean you shouldn’t visit.\n\n“We’re calling them preservation-in-action tours,” Gunther said. “People will get to the house will have full access, but you know, there’ll still be some work going on, and it’ll be a great opportunity for our visitors to see preservation and progress and learn about what it takes to preserve a building like falling water. It’s a unique opportunity.”",

Read more\n\nIf I told you in August that the Eagles would win Super Bowl LIX but afterward they would lose Milton Williams, Josh Sweat, Kenneth Gainwell, Oren Burks, and Mekhi Becton, your response would have been a resounding:\n\n“Who cares?”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe performances of that quintet, as well as a few others, outpaced expectations, but none of them was the best player on the team. Despite their productive 2024 seasons, none of them was even the best player at his position, nor, in most cases, the second-best, despite their fine seasons.\n\nEven after the first week of free agency denuded the Birds roster to a degree, the reasons for optimism in 2024 are the same reasons for arrogance in 2025.\n\nNo matter how many players leave the Eagles for other teams, the Eagles still will be the best team in the NFL in 2025. They should win Super Bowl LX as easily as they won its predecessor.\n\n» READ MORE: Ball hawk C.J. Gardner-Johnson gave up too many TDs and tackled poorly, so Howie Roseman traded him\n\nThat’s because their cornerstones are players in their prime who’ve shown no indication of decline. Tackles Lane Johnson and Jordan Mailata and running back Saquon Barkley have no equals. The best receiver in Eagles history, A.J. Brown, is on his way to the Hall of Fame.\n\nFurther, and more importantly, the Eagles are loaded with even more players who haven’t sniffed their ceilings. The Eagles’ future isn’t just bright for next year. It’s bright for the next five years.\n\nThere is no general manager in the NFL who wouldn’t trade his roster for theirs.\n\nCertainly, there’s no guarantee that the older players will remain elite, but all of them treat their bodies like temples, so you’ll get their best.\n\nSimilarly, there’s no guarantee that the young players will get better, but there’s no logical reason to think they won’t.\n\nLet’s start at the top.\n\nQB1\n\nIn his fourth season as a starter, Jalen Hurts had a career-best 103.7 passer rating and a career-low five interceptions, tied his career high in adjusted average yards per attempt (8.42), and remained a standout runner who scored 14 touchdowns on the ground. When the games mattered more he got even better: 108.6 playoff passer rating, 10 total playoff touchdowns, and Super Bowl MVP.\n\nHurts’ passer rating in four playoff runs: 95.4.\n\nTom Brady’s passer rating through his first four playoff runs: 89.4. Brady worked hard and got better.\n\nHurts works even harder, so he will, too.\n\nDT1\n\nThe most impressive stat in Jalen Carter’s Pro Bowl sophomore season wasn’t his 4½ sacks, his 12 tackles for loss, or his two sacks in the postseason. It was his 84% usage rate. He took more snaps as a second-year player than the defensive tackle he replaced, Fletcher Cox, took in any of his 12 seasons. He took the second-most snaps per game of any defensive tackle who played at least 16 games. He was double-teamed constantly. And still, he got better. So did his former and current teammate.\n\n» READ MORE: Milton Williams, Josh Sweat told me before Eagles won Super Bowl LIX they expected hundreds of millions in free agency\n\nDT2\n\nJordan Davis followed a third straight so-so regular season with a spectacular playoff run, logging three of the five best performances of his career in the postseason in wins over the Packers, Commanders, and Chiefs. He had 3½ sacks in his career before he collected two sacks in the playoffs, which will give the Eagles every reason to exercise his fifth-year option in May to keep the Georgia Boys together.\n\nDE1\n\nThe best thing that could have happened for the Eagles’ near future was the exclusion of its recent past. Brandon Graham’s Week 12 injury meant more playing time for second-year defensive end Nolan Smith, who finished with 6½ sacks in the regular season and collected a league-high four sacks in the playoffs. He looked great in Weeks 15, 16, and 17, too, giving him a seven-game run of excellence that should continue into 2025.\n\nWR2\n\nThe Nick Sirianni era began, really, with the drafting of DeVonta Smith in 2021. With the ascent of Hurts and Brown, the arrival of Barkley, and the continued dominance of the offensive line, it’s easy to forget that Smith won the Heisman Trophy and broke DeSean Jackson’s record for receiving yards by a rookie. He’s gotten better every year. Barkley made the passing game the team’s second option, but Smith led the Eagles with a career-best eight touchdown catches in 2024 and added a backbreaker in the Super Bowl.\n\nCBs 1 and 1A\n\nRookie second-rounder Cooper DeJean ranked first in overall defense among cornerbacks who took at least 800 snaps, according to Pro Football Focus, and he had a pick-six in his first Super Bowl.\n\nRookie first-rounder Quinyon Mitchell ranked seventh, but he played almost 200 more snaps and generally faced much better receivers, considering he played outside and DeJean played nickel. Mitchell had an interception in the NFC championship game.\n\n» READ MORE: Top 5 Saquon Barkley moments from the Eagles’ Super Bowl season\n\nCenter of attention\n\nNo young player outperformed expectations like Cam Jurgens. After sitting as a rookie and playing guard in his second year, Jurgens replaced mentor Jason Kelce and rewarded Kelce’s investment in his education with a Pro Bowl berth, an honor Kelce didn’t receive until hs fourth season.\n\nKelce wound up with seven.\n\nExpect Jurgens to beat that number.\n\nNo team returns intact, especially a team that wins. They Eagles have lost their third-best defensive tackle, behind Carter and Davis; their third-best defensive end, behind Graham and Smith; their third-best linebacker behind Zack Baun, whom they re-signed, and Nakobe Dean; and their fifth-best offensive lineman, and maybe their sixth-best, considering Tyler Steen was playing ahead of Becton until Steen got hurt.\n\nThey replaced Gainwell with free-agent monster AJ Dillon, whose arrival made the Tush Push, already virtually unstoppable, completely unstoppable, and second-year back Will Shipley showed signs of Gainwell’s third-down proficiency. Third-year defensive tackle Moro Ojomo might not be Williams today, but Williams didn’t develop into an NFL force until his third season. Jalyx Hunt had two sacks in his first four playoffs games. Sweat had 1½.\n\nIt doesn’t matter as much that the Eagles need to replace lost talent with new talent.\n\nWhat matters is that the massive talent already in Philadelphia makes what should be natural strides of improvement.",

I was renting a trinity in Southwest Center City when the pandemic hit five years ago. (The “Mouse House,” for my longtime readers.)\n\nI have a friend with young kids who rents a single-family detached home in Burlington County while she and her husband save up to buy somewhere.\n\nBut build-to-rent communities are something different. These professionally managed neighborhoods of single-family homes come with dedicated maintenance staff and neighbors who are all also renting from the same landlord. Residents may have yards and garages. Depending on the place, sometimes there’s shared clubhouses, playgrounds, and other amenities.\n\nDemand for build-to-rent communities is growing nationwide, largely because homes have gotten less affordable to buy and maintain.\n\nThe people who live in communities of single-family homes built for rent span life stages and incomes.\n\nSome examples:\n\n🚚 Households that move every few years or want to live in an area before deciding whether to buy.\n\n🎒 Families who can’t afford to buy in their preferred school district.\n\n👧🏽 Divorced parents who want a home similar to what their children are used to.\n\n🔨 Older homeowners who can’t or don’t want to age in place but want space and less maintenance.\n\nSome build-to-rent residents want to buy eventually, and others just like renting.\n\nKeep reading to learn about the explosive national growth in communities of single-family homes built to rent and find out why we don’t see more of them in the Philadelphia area.\n\nThe mission of Philly’s Land Bank is to help turn vacant or blighted properties into affordable housing or other projects that will benefit the public. Part of that work is getting tax-delinquent lots at sheriff sales.\n\nBut since March 2020, the quasi-governmental agency has not been able to buy any properties through sheriff sale.\n\nThat’s because there’s a problem at the Philadelphia Sheriff’s Office. Again.\n\nCity lawmakers are getting frustrated. It’s not clear what’s going on. But the issue seems to be related to an online auction house that the sheriff hired to run sheriff sales.\n\nA process that’s meant to let the Land Bank buy properties more easily has hit a snag that officials said they’re trying to work out with the auction house.

Those 4,631 pending sales were the lowest February total in more than a decade.\n\n🔻New home listings were down 10.5%, too. The 5,335 homes that were added to the market last month represent the lowest number of February new listings in more than 20 years.\n\n🔺Active home listings were up almost 10% compared to the same time last year.\n\nIf you’re wondering how new listings went down but active listings went up, we’ve got an answer. More active listings don’t necessarily mean that more homeowners are putting their properties on the market. Across the Mid-Atlantic, there’s more supply “primarily because homes are remaining on the market longer,” said Lisa Sturtevant, chief economist at Bright MLS.\n\nBut housing supply in the Philly metro area is still low — just 44% of what it was in February 2019.\n\nThe traditionally busier spring housing market is now upon us, so check back next month to see whether we’re starting to see the expected rise in the number of owners listing their homes for sale.\n\n📷 Photo quiz\n\nDo you know the location this photo shows?\n\n📮 If you think you do, email me back.

Read more\n\nEven Ted Lasso is capitalizing on the growth of women’s sports.\n\nOn the New Heights podcast, Jason Sudeikis, who co-created and starred in the Apple TV series, confirmed the rumors that Ted Lasso will return for a fourth season, which is already in development.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“We’re writing Season 4 now,” Sudeikis said. “That’s the official word. Ted’s coaching a women’s team.”\n\nBoth Kelce brothers said they were huge fans of the show, which follows fictional Premier League club AFC Richmond after they hire an American football coach, the titular Ted Lasso. The cast of characters includes disgruntled veteran Roy Kent (played by Brett Goldstein), arrogant young star Jamie Tartt (Phil Dunster), and team owner Rebecca Welton (Hannah Waddingham).\n\n“I felt like Roy Kent at the end of my career,” Jason Kelce joked on the podcast. “I was feeling a lot of what this guy’s feeling right now.”\n\nThe series won 11 Emmy Awards and was Apple TV’s first major hit show.\n\nIn what was at the time the series finale, Lasso left AFC Richmond at the end of Season 3 to come back to the United States to coach his son’s soccer team. Sudeikis and the rest of the writers didn’t originally plan for the show to continue — and even said after the first season that they only planned for a three-season run — but the show’s enduring popularity motivated the team to write another season.\n\n“The universe just kept saying things, whether kind folks on the internet, or friends of my folks, or just other people in the industry, wherever, in any walk of life, and I was like, ‘Alright, we hear you,’” Sudeikis said. “More stories just kept popping up in our heads, so yeah, we’re exploring all that now. It’s daunting, because we told the story we wanted to tell, but there’s more there.”\n\nSudeikis did not confirm or deny whether Lasso would be set in London for season four or remain in Lasso’s hometown, Kansas City.\n\n“You’re asking too many questions, but it’s only because I don’t know,” Sudeikis joked.",

        "content": "Tell us how you really feel, DeMarcus.\n\nDeMarcus Lawrence, the ex-Cowboys star who spent 11 years in Dallas, isn’t holding back about his former team after signing a three-year deal with the Seattle Seahawks.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“Dallas is my home,” the four-time Pro Bowler told Brian Nemhauser of the Hawk Blogger Thursday, “Made my home there, my family lives there, I’m forever going to be there. But I know for sure I’m not going to win a Super Bowl there.”\n\nNot surprisingly, Lawrence’s comments struck a nerve with former teammate Micah Parsons, who included a clown emoji in his response on social media.\n\n“This what rejection and envy look like!” Parsons wrote.\n\n“Calling me a clown won’t change the fact that I told the truth,” Lawrence responded in his own social media post. “Maybe if you spent less time tweeting and more time winning, I wouldn’t have left.”\n\nEven Parson’s brother, Terrence Parsons Jr., got in on the drama, writing on his own social media post, “Lmfaoo and I know for sure you ain’t winning one in Seattle it’s okay to say you went where the bag was lol you wasn’t getting that in Dallas.”\n\nLawrence’s tune has changed in recent weeks. Ahead of free agency, Lawrence said he wanted to remain with the Cowboys, who drafted him in the second round of the 2014 NFL draft.\n\n“The ball is in their court. I’m not only going to play in Dallas,” Lawrence told the Fort Worth Star-Telegram. “I’m going to have other options, but I’d like to stay here. It would be a glorious thing.”\n\nDespite playing just four games last season due to a foot injury, Lawrence landed a three-year, $42 million deal to join the Seahawks. The move surprised many, including his former teammate CeeDee Lamb, who found out about the news while doing a livestream.\n\n“D-Law to the Seahawks. Woah,” Lamb said, pausing out of shock. “He’s gone.”\n\nAs for Lawrence’s argument, the Cowboys’ last Super Bowl appearance was in 1995. It’s also the last time Dallas has advanced to the NFC championship game. But Lawrence decided to sign with a Seahawks team in a rebuilding phase after trading away Pro Bowlers Geno Smith and DK Metcalf for draft picks, so it’s unclear where all the Super Bowl talk is coming from.\n\nThe Cowboys did make some non-Lawrence news Friday, signing former Eagles running back Miles Sanders to a one-year deal, according to ESPN’s Jeremy Fowler.\n\nSanders, 27, was drafted in the second round by the Eagles in 2019 and had his best season in 2022, rushing for 1,269 yards and scoring 11 touchdowns. He signed with the Carolina Panthers in 2023 but was released earlier this week just two years into a four-year, $25.7 million deal.\n\nNow Sanders will try to turn his career around alongside Javonte Williams, the former Denver Broncos running back who signed with the Cowboys earlier this week.",

        "content": "Phillies lefty Jose Alvarado struck out the side in the sixth inning Saturday, giving him 15 strikeouts in six scoreless innings so far this spring. Read more\n\nCLEARWATER, Fla. — The most significant Phillies bullpen news Saturday came when Matt Strahm resumed throwing for the first time in 10 days and reported no pain in his inflamed left shoulder.\n\nIs there time for him to be ready by opening day?\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“I think that there’s a chance,” manager Rob Thomson said after a 2-2 tie with the Tigers. “But we still have to lengthen him out, bullpen [session]. He’ll throw a [live batting practice] in there in between. So, those things take some time.”\n\n» READ MORE: Do Phillies hitters have to change their approach? Here’s Kevin Long’s plan for each.\n\nOK, we’ll check back. Meanwhile, get a load of the Phillies’ other high-leverage lefty reliever.\n\nJosé Alvarado continued his eye-popping spring in the sixth inning by striking out the heart of the Tigers’ order — Riley Greene, Gleyber Torres, and Kerry Carpenter — on 16 pitches, 11 of which were clocked at 100 mph or more. Alvarado has struck out 15 of 22 batters in six scoreless Grapefruit League outings.\n\n“It’s tough to see from the dugout, but seeing him throw, and highlights and stuff, it’s much [of] what you saw,” said Zack Wheeler, who allowed two unearned runs in five innings. “It’s really good.”\n\nAlvarado was always a pivotal piece of the Phillies’ bullpen. But Strahm’s potential absence for the first couple of weeks of the season amplifies the big lefty’s role.\n\nLast season, Alvarado posted a 4.09 ERA in 66 appearances and slid on Thomson’s list of trustworthy relievers. He also left the team for a week in late August for personal reasons. But he recommitted to getting in better shape in the offseason, switching to a high-protein diet that enabled him to lose weight and gain back velocity.\n\nAlvarado struck out Greene on a cutter, then whiffed Torres on a 101.8 mph sinker and outlasted Carpenter in a seven-pitch at-bat by getting him to swing through an elevated cutter.\n\n» READ MORE: Bryson Stott is healthy, but getting back to being a ‘reaction hitter’ is just as key to a resurgence in 2025\n\nWhat stood out: Lefties don’t get much tougher than Tarik Skubal, the reigning AL Cy Young Award winner. But the Phillies’ left-handed hitters held their own. It wasn’t only Bryce Harper, who tallied two hits. Bryson Stott punched a two-strike single up the middle in the fifth inning, while Brandon Marsh reached on two infield singles.\n\n“Marsh saw the ball really well,” Thomson said. “He didn’t get out of the zone. I thought they did fine. [Skubal] is tough, man. He’s got good stuff. And he comes right after you. It’s strike one, strike two. The changeup’s really good. It’s the reason why he’s won a Cy Young.”\n\nOn the mound: In addition to Alvarado, relievers Jordan Romano, Orion Kerkering, and Devin Sweet each pitched a scoreless inning out of the bullpen. Sweet is an option for the Phillies if Strahm opens on the injured list.\n\nHealth check: Alec Bohm fouled a pitch off his foot in the sixth inning and appeared to favor it while running out an infield single. But he reported no problems after the game. Bohm isn’t scheduled to play Sunday anyway, according to Thomson.\n\nQuotable: “It’s spring training. You have your good innings, bad innings, performance-wise and feel-wise. As long as you get through it healthy, that’s always the biggest thing in spring. I’ve been able to do that so far.” — Wheeler on getting ready for the season.\n\nOn deck: The Phillies will make the 62-mile drive to Sarasota to face the Orioles at 1:05 p.m. Sunday (94-WIP). Jesús Luzardo is scheduled to face former Phillies righty Zach Eflin.",

This has been quite a windy start to the year, and the gusts are due for a return performance Sunday. Read more\n\nPerhaps March was concerned about losing its reputation, but whatever the motive, the strong wind gusts that have characterized the first quarter of 2025 are due to return to the Philly region on Sunday.\n\nWind gusts in the afternoon could reach 40 mph, and gusts to 50 or better are not out of the question after sunset with the approach of a potent front that has resulted in at least 45 tornado reports in the Midwest and South, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Storm Prediction Center.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAround here, downpours are possible — and the region still very much needs rain, especially now — along with thunderstorm winds, said Dan Pydynowski, a lead forecaster with AccuWeather Inc.\n\nRegardless, said Mike Gorse, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service office in Mount Holly, “it’s going to be windy, with or without storms.”\n\nThis has been a particularly windy period in the Philly region\n\nOn average, for sustained winds March is the windiest month of the year, and this one has been having a howling good time.\n\nWhile the winds have been on a sort of spring break the last week, gusts of 40 mph or higher have been recorded at Philadelphia International Airport on five days so far, the most of any March through mid-month in at least the last five years. Since Jan. 1, gusts of 35 mph or higher have been measured on 24 days, and 40 mph more on 16, also the most since at least 2020.\n\nFortunately, the region has been spared widespread power outages, and that is likely related to the fact that trees are not leafed out, and thus winds can sail right through them.\n\nBut the winds also have exacerbated the stubborn dryness, said Dave Dombek, senior meteorologist with AccuWeather Inc.\n\nWith the winds, the longer days, and the growing power of the sun, he said, “Your evaporation rates go up exponentially.”\n\nThe soil in the Philly region is about as dry as it gets this time of year\n\nAccording to NOAA’s Climate Prediction Center, soil moisture is about as depleted as it gets around here this time of year — in the 95th to 100th percentile for dryness throughout the region.\n\nRain has been wanting. In the last 60 days, precipitation deficits are running at 35% in Philly and the neighboring Pennsylvania counties, and 30% in Burlington, Camden, and Gloucester Counties, based on data compiled by the Middle Atlantic River Forecast Center, which uses a sampling of stations.\n\nDrought advisories remain in effect across the region. The heavy rains of March 5, the most in Philly on any calendar day in eight months, did almost nothing to move the needle in the latest weekly drought map, posted Thursday by the U.S. Drought Monitor, an academic-government partnership.\n\nThis is a critical period for rainfall, given that the foliage is working up a mighty thirst. Some early spring flowers, including daffodils, are blooming, and the trees are bursting with buds, their presence evident in the sunset light.\n\nWhen are the winds and rains likely to arrive in Philly on Sunday?\n\nIt’s likely to be windy when you wake up, with breezes from the south ahead of the front. The gusts should intensify in midafternoon, Pydynowski said.\n\nAny thunderstorms likely would hold off until the evening, he said, and they are not a done deal. The air at night tends to be less volatile than during the day, when the atmosphere gets a charge from the sun.\n\nThe rains may “come in waves,” he said, and a widespread half inch to inch is likely, with more to the east.\n\nLooking ahead, the climate center sees the chances favoring above-normal rainfall in the March 23 to 29 period.\n\nIt mentioned nothing about wind, but March is only half over.",

Read more\n\nThree seasons as men’s basketball coach at Villanova yielded three consecutive missed NCAA Tournaments for Kyle Neptune, and on Saturday morning, school leadership decided to change course. Villanova fired Neptune less than 48 hours after the Wildcats were eliminated in the quarterfinals of the Big East tournament.\n\nNeptune went 54-47 overall and 31-29 in the Big East after taking over the program in 2022 following the retirement of Jay Wright, under whom Neptune coached at Villanova for eight seasons before leaving to become the head coach at Fordham for one season.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nVillanova lost Thursday night in the quarterfinals of the Big East tournament for the third consecutive season — it lost, 73-56, to Connecticut this time — and before a third consecutive Selection Sunday comes and goes without Villanova’s name called.\n\nAssistant coach Mike Nardi will serve as interim head coach for any potential postseason play. Villanova still could receive an invitation to play in the College Basketball Crown tournament later this month.\n\nVillanova had arguably its best roster under Neptune this season, but inconsistent results and too many late-game collapses left the Wildcats on the wrong side of the NCAA Tournament bubble. It left the Wildcats needing an improbable conference tournament run to avoid missing the tournament for three consecutive years for the first time since 2004, Wright’s third season at Villanova.\n\nWhy the 40-year-old Neptune wasn’t afforded the same level of patience speaks to the changing world of high-level college sports and Villanova’s place as a program in between two time periods.\n\nThe name, image, and likeness era doesn’t lend to maintaining the status quo. Coaches are judged on a different curve when long stretches of losing could mean fewer financial resources flowing to the program and, in turn, the roster.\n\nVillanova — despite the Big East having a down year and the power conferences getting bigger and stronger — still fancies itself as a program that wants to contend, and its list of candidates for Neptune’s replacement likely will be long and maybe even aspirational.\n\n» READ MORE: Kyle Neptune was overwhelmed as Villanova’s head coach. The Wildcats need a dynamic leader.\n\nWhoever gets the job will have a lot of work to do. The entire regular starting five from the 2024-25 season is out of eligibility, and there’s no telling how many players could hit the transfer portal. Villanova had its best transfer portal class under Neptune last offseason, but the results this season weren’t good enough.\n\nThe 2022-23 season, Neptune’s first, almost was a wash based partially on the timing of Wright’s surprising retirement following a Final Four run and top player Justin Moore missing the majority of the season. Villanova finished that campaign 17-17. But 2023-24, with a full transfer portal and recruiting cycle at the staff’s disposal, yielded similar results — this time 18-16 — and Neptune occasionally was booed during home games by an impatient fan base that was miffed by a team that produced inconsistent results.\n\nHow could the same team that ran the table against good competition at the Battle for Atlantis lose to Penn and St. Joseph’s?\n\nNeptune did himself no favors when the Wildcats lost at home in the second game of this season to a Columbia team that eventually won just one game in the Ivy League. Villanova again lost to St. Joe’s, dropping consecutive games in the rivalry for the first time in 20 years. The Wildcats were badly outplayed by a bad Virginia team and got swept by Georgetown, but they also won games against St. John’s, UConn, and Marquette.\n\nMore than sometimes playing down to competition, the late-game collapses kept with a trend of a team and a coach that too often made crushing mistakes in crunch time. Take Thursday night, for example. The Wildcats, playing for their tournament lives and their coach’s future, were outscored, 32-11, over the final 12-plus minutes. A four-point lead turned into a laugher, and new athletic director Eric Roedl, who started in January, and school president Rev. Peter Donohue did not let the loss linger before pulling the plug on Neptune’s tenure.\n\n“We just lost a game,” Neptune said when asked postgame if he was concerned about his job status. “I’m thinking about the guys in the locker room that just lost. I’m thinking about our staff that just lost. Just them, we just lost a game and put a lot into it. That’s all I’m thinking about right now.”\n\nVillanova’s season isn’t officially over. The top two Big East teams that miss out on the NCAA Tournament are slated to play in the new College Basketball Crown tournament during the last week of March in Las Vegas. But Roedl and Donohue could not afford to wait until then and allow potential coaching candidates to go elsewhere. Plus, the transfer portal opens before that tournament starts.\n\nWhether Villanova can field a team for that event remains to be seen. The obvious and immediate focus is on crowning a new coach.\n\nNeptune’s firing created the third men’s basketball coaching transition in the Big 5. Penn earlier this week fired Steve Donahue, and La Salle’s Fran Dunphy is retiring from coaching. The Explorers announced that Radford coach Darris Nichols will be their next coach following a search that lasted a few weeks after the school made Dunphy’s retirement public.\n\nFor Villanova, a critical search is only just beginning.",

        "content": "Homecoming 250 in October will be a week-long celebration of the 250th anniversaries of the Navy and Marine Corps, both founded in Philly in 1775. Ten Navy and Coast Guard vessels will dock along three historic Philly ships, including the Cruiser Olympia in Penn's Landing. Read more\n\nWhen George Leone began thinking about America’s 250th birthday in 2026, the retired New Jersey Superior Court judge and former Philadelphia assistant district attorney did not want to see Philly blow its chance in the spotlight.\n\nSo, the South Jersey native and son of a World War II Naval officer started planning a party of his own. One that could jump-start Philadelphia’s celebrations of the Semiquincentennial, as the national milestone is called, while honoring the service and sacrifice of veterans everywhere.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat weeklong bash, a commemoration of the 250th anniversary of the United States Navy and Marine Corps, both founded in Philly in 1775, is now a reality.\n\nKnown as Homecoming 250 — and running from Oct. 9, 2025 to Oct. 16, 2025 — the event will serve as a grand inaugural for Philadelphia’s 250th celebrations. Festivities will include a grand parade of ships on the Delaware River, ship tours, balls, concerts, commemorations, and family events. There will be historical symposium on Naval and Marine Corps’ history hosted by the University of Pennsylvania and a special preview screening of filmmaker Ken Burns’ forthcoming documentary, “The American Revolution.”\n\nAs of now, Leone anticipates eight visiting Navy vessels and two Coast Guard cutters, representing nearly every American war, to dock alongside the three historic ships anchored along the Philly and Camden waterfronts. Scores of military brass — including every living Secretary of the Navy dating back to President Lyndon Johnson — and as many as 300,000 people are expected to attend Homecoming 250.\n\nThe event that Leone, 67, of Haddonfield, and a dedicated band of dozens of veterans and volunteers began organizing from scratch five years ago, is planned as the largest Semiquincentennial event honoring the military and veterans in the nation.\n\n“It’s been a wonderful experience to see how people can come together for an event that reminds us what unites us,” Leone said.\n\nThe event\n\nAfter parading up the Delaware, the visiting Naval and Coast Guard some of the ships will moor alongside the Cruiser Olympia and Submarine Becuna in Penn’s Landing and the Battleship New Jersey in Camden. Other ships will berth at the Navy Yard and the Holt Logistics Corp shipyard in Gloucester City.\n\nThere will also be replicas of Revolutionary War ships, including the one General George Washington used to for his Delaware River Crossing. Leone is hoping to fund the construction of a temporary replica of a Civil War Naval ship.\n\n“It will be a tremendous display of Naval history,” he said.\n\nThe week will also feature flyovers by the U.S. Navy Blue Angels, an Independence Hall ceremony to commemorate the official founding of the Navy, a United States Navy Band concert, and Navy and Marine Corps’ galas.\n\nLeone, who also sits on the board of a nonprofit rebuilding the Tun Tavern, said the October events will be followed by a Nov. 10 celebration marking the official founding of the Marines. A portion of Second Street, near Market, will likely be closed for the party since the bar itself may not yet be completed, he said\n\nLeone said he hopes Homecoming 250 can seize the Semiquincentennial spotlight for Philadelphia.\n\n“So that when people think about the Semiquincentennial, they think of where the nation got started,” he said.\n\nBack to 1775\n\nThe Navy was founded twice — both times in Philly.\n\nThe Second Continental Congress, meeting at Independence Hall, founded a Continental Navy in October 1775. Deemed too expensive, it was disbanded after the Revolutionary War. The founders again formed a National Navy in 1794 to deal with Barbary Pirates.\n\nThe United States Marine Corps traces its roots to its first recruiting station: the Tun Tavern in Old City, where it was founded on Nov. 10, 1775.\n\nBy 2023, Leone had garnered the support of the Navy and Marine Corps’ leadership, the Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Delaware congressional delegations, and the state’s governors and state legislatures.\n\nEarlier this month, as part of a larger package supporting the Semiquincentennial, Philadelphia City Council approved $500,000 in funding for Homecoming 250. That money matched grant by the Philadelphia Funder Collaborative for the Semiquincentennial. The Homecoming 250 nonprofit raised another $4 million.\n\n“We have an opportunity to roll out the red carpet for veterans and military members and set the stage for America’s 250th,” said Michael Newmuis, Philadelphia’s 2026 director. “For a week in October, all eyes will be on us.”\n\nHow it came together\n\nLeone only embarked on his legal career after vision problems kept him from following in the service of his father, Joseph Leone, who hunted German submarines as a Naval flier in World War II.\n\nAfter graduating from the University of Chicago Law School in 1982, George Leon clerked for Judge James Hunter III, a WWII veteran, who sat on the Camden court of appeals.\n\n“It was clear that even though he was just below the Supreme Court, the most important thing he had ever done was be a Marine Corps’ officer,” said Leone.\n\nAfter retiring from the New Jersey Superior Court in Camden, Leone was teaching law at Rutgers University-Camden in 2020 when he and other volunteers began organizing Homecoming 250.\n\n“I have managed to create a full-time unpaid job for myself,” he joked.\n\nHe began by gathering calling past Secretaries of the Navy, including John Lehman Jr., a Philadelphia native who served in the post from 1981 to 1987, under President Ronald Reagan.\n\nLehman, who lives in Bucks County, quickly signed on.\n\n“It was time to remind people of the history of Philadelphia and the key role it played in the founding of our military,” said Lehman. “Both Naval and Marine Corps history is woven in Philadelphia.”",

It is a protected marsupial found only in Australia.\n\nMontana-based Jones claimed she became “extremely concerned” when she found the two wombats on a road not moving.\n\n“As wombats are so often hit on Australian roads, I stopped to ensure they got off the road safely and didn’t get hit,” Jones said.\n\n“However, as is seen from the video, when I walked up to them, the joey did not move or run off. I was concerned it may have been sick or injured, and made a snap judgement to pick up the joey and see if that was the case,” she added.\n\nAn unidentified man laughs as he films Jones saying: “I caught a baby wombat.” They both note the mother’s sounds of aggression.\n\nAnimal welfare experts said Jones could have harmed the joey by dangling it by its two forelegs.\n\nJones said she returned the joey to its mother and ensured they both left the road.\n\n“I have done a great deal of reflection on this situation and have realized that I did not handle this situation as best as I should have,” she said.\n\n“I have learned from this situation, and am truly sorry for the distress I have caused,” she added.\n\nJones did not immediately respond Saturday to The Associated Press’s questions, including where and when the baby wombat was captured.\n\nA wombat expert said the video revealed the joey had the skin disease mange and would die without treatment.\n\nJones declined to reveal her current whereabouts to the AP.",

        "content": "LATEST: Judge expands block on Trump's plan to use the Alien Enemies Act to deport suspected Venezuelan gang members\n\nA federal judge on Saturday blocked the Trump administration from using an 18th century law known as the Alien Enemies Act to deport five Venezuelans, kicking off a blizzard of litigation over the controversial move even before the president has announced it.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has widely signaled he would invoke the 1798 Act, last used to justify the internment of Japanese-American civilians during World War 2.\n\nOn Saturday, the American Civil Liberties Union and Democracy Forward filed an extraordinary lawsuit in federal court in Washington contending the order would identify a Venezuelan gang, Tren de Aragua, as a “predatory incursion” by a foreign government and seek to deport any Venezuelan in the country as a member of that gang, regardless of the facts.\n\nGet top local stories in Philly delivered to you every morning. Sign up for NBC Philadelphia's News Headlines newsletter.\n\nJames E. Boasberg, chief judge of the D.C. Circuit, agreed to implement a temporary restraining order preventing the deportation for 14 days under the act of the five Venezuelans who are already in immigration custody and believed they were being moved to be deported. Boasberg said his order was “to preserve the status quo.” Boasberg scheduled a hearing for later in the afternoon to see if his order should be expanded to protect all Venezuelans in the United States.\n\nHours later, the Trump administration appealed the initial restraining order, contending that halting a presidential act before it has been announced would cripple the executive branch.\n\nIf the order were allowed to stand, \"district courts would have license to enjoin virtually any urgent national-security action just upon receipt of a complaint,” the Justice Department wrote in its appeal.\n\nIt said district courts might then issue temporary restraining orders on actions such as drone strikes, sensitive intelligence operations, or terrorist captures or extraditions. The court “should halt that path in its tracks,” the department argued.\n\nThe unusual flurry of litigation highlights the controversy around the Alien Enemies Act, which could give Trump vast power to deport people in the country illegally. It could let him bypass some protections of normal criminal and immigration law. But it would face immediate challenges along the lines of Saturday's litigation because it has previously only been used during wartime.\n\nThe law requires a formal declaration of war before it can be used. But immigration lawyers were alarmed by a flurry of activity Friday night.\n\n“Last night, it appears the government was preparing to deport a number of Venezuelans they had no legal authority to deport,” said Ahilan Arulanantham, an immigration lawyer in Los Angeles who filed two petitions to block deportations that night.",

        "content": "President Donald Trump has signed into law legislation funding the government through the end of September, ending the threat of a partial government shutdown and capping off a struggle in Congress that deeply divided Democrats.\n\nHarrison Fields, White House principal deputy press secretary, said in a post on X that Trump signed the continuing resolution Saturday.\n\nThe bill largely keeps government funding at levels set during Joe Biden's presidency, though with changes. It trims non-defense spending by about $13 billion from the previous year and increases defense spending by about $6 billion, which are marginal changes when talking about a topline spending level of nearly $1.7 trillion.\n\nThe Senate cleared the legislation on Friday in a 54-46 party line vote, with 10 members of the Senate Democratic caucus helping the bill advance to passage despite opposition from within their party — most vocally from colleagues in the House, who exhorted them to reject the bill out of hand.\n\nGet top local stories in Philly delivered to you every morning. Sign up for NBC Philadelphia's News Headlines newsletter.\n\nSenate Democrats argued for days over whether to force a shutdown, livid that Republicans in the House had drafted and passed the spending measure without their input. Democrats said the legislation shortchanges health care, housing and other priorities and gives Trump wide leeway to redirect federal spending even as his administration and the Department of Government Efficiency rapidly dismantle congressionally approved agencies and programs.\n\nIn the end, enough of the Democratic senators decided a government shutdown would be even worse than letting the funding bill pass.\n\nSenate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said a shutdown would have given the Trump administration the ability to deem whole agencies, programs and personnel non-essential, furloughing staff with no promise they would ever be rehired.\n\n“A shutdown will allow DOGE to shift into overdrive,” Schumer said. “Donald Trump and Elon Musk would be free to destroy vital government services at a much faster rate.”\n\nPassage of the funding bill through the House earlier in the week was a victory for Trump and House Speaker Mike Johnson, who managed to hold Republicans together and muscle the bill to passage without support from Democrats — something they've rarely been able to achieve in the past.",

        "source": "https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/",
        "content": "A federal judge on Saturday expanded an order that temporarily blocks an effort by President Donald Trump to deport suspected members of a Venezuelan gang he's accused of \"unlawfully infiltrating\" the United States through the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, NBC News reported.\n\nTrump on Saturday invoked the rarely used wartime authority, accusing Venezuelan gang Tren De Aragua of “infiltrating” Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro’s regime, including its \"military and law enforcement apparatus\"; perpetuating “irregular warfare” within the United States and using drug trafficking as a weapon against American citizens.\n\nHours before the White House published Trump’s proclamation, the American Civil Liberties Union and Democracy Forward filed a lawsuit accusing the White House of preparing to imminently deport five Venezuelan men under the Alien Enemies Act.\n\nChief Judge of the D.C. District Court James E. Boasberg initially implemented a temporary restraining order preventing the Trump administration from deporting the five Venezuelans named in the lawsuit for at least 14 days.\n\nGet top local stories in Philly delivered to you every morning. Sign up for NBC Philadelphia's News Headlines newsletter.\n\nBoasberg has now expanded the decision to apply to \"all non-citizens in US custody\" who are subject to Trump's proclamation.\n\nThe ruling means all Venezuelan citizens 14 years or older who are members of Tren de Aragua, currently in the country and are not naturalized or lawful permanent residents of the United States, are to remain in the United States for 14 days or until further order of the court.\n\n“Any plane containing these folks that is going to take off, or is in the air, needs to be returned to the United States,” the judge said. “Those people need to be returned to the United States.”\n\nThe judge's ruling does not apply to individuals who have already been ordered to leave the country for reasons separate from Trump's invocation of the Alien Enemies Act, nor does it include individuals who have already landed and disembarked in a foreign country. The judge said they are no longer in the court's jurisdiction.\n\nThe Judge scheduled another hearing on Friday, March 21, when further arguments will be held.\n\n“Today was a horrific day in the history of the nation, when the President publicized that he was seeking to invoke extraordinary wartime powers in the absence of a war or invasion and claiming virtually unlimited authority to remove people from the country,” Skye Perryman, the president of Democracy Forward said in a statement. “But, tonight the rule of law prevailed. The government has been forced to turn planes around and our lawsuit — filed in the very early hours this morning — has resulted in broad relief.”\n\nTwenty states and the District of Columbia announced a lawsuit against the Trump administration Thursday over its mass firings at the Department of Education.\n\nDuring a hearing on Saturday afternoon, the judge was assured by Justice Department lawyers that the five Venezuelans ordered to remain in the country were not currently on deportation flights, though the government could not confirm if flights to Central America with other Venezuelans on board were actively taking place.\n\nAttorneys for the non-profit groups challenging Trump's order told the judge they were aware of flights that had taken off from Texas, with Venezuelans on board, heading to both Honduras and El Salvador.\n\nThe judge in response warned the government that it must comply with the court's order.\n\n“This is something you need to make sure is complied with immediately,” Boasberg said. “These folks are going to be sent to Salvadorian and Honduran prisons, which are not going to be terribly receptive to Venezuelans.\"\n\nThe Alien Enemies Act of 1798 enables the president to quickly detain and deport immigrants from a \"hostile\" nation, either during times of \"declared war\" or when a foreign government perpetuates an \"invasion\" or \"predatory incursion\" into the United States. Only Congress has the Constitutional power to declare war.\n\n\"Over the years, Venezuelan national and local authorities have ceded ever-greater control over their territories to transnational criminal organizations, including TdA [Tren De Aragua]. The result is a hybrid criminal state that is perpetrating an invasion of and predatory incursion into the United States, and which poses a substantial danger to the United States,\" Trump's proclamation reads.\n\nLegal experts have challenged Trump’s interpretation of the Alien Enemies Act, arguing that it was designed to only be used in times of war, and invoking it to deport immigrants could be unlawful.\n\nIlya Somin, a professor at George Mason University’s Antonin Scalia Law School, wrote earlier this year that “illegal migration and cross-border drug-smuggling do not qualify as ‘invasion’ and certainly not as an invasion by a 'hostile nation or government.'”\n\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio last month designated Tren De Aragua a foreign terrorist organization after Trump signed an executive order creating a process for him to do so.\n\nTrump in the order accused the group of engaging in a \"campaign of violence and terror\" and flooding \"the United States with deadly drugs, violent criminals, and vicious gangs.\" In the same order, Trump directed federal officials to \"make operational preparations\" for the \"implementation\" of the Alien Enemies Act.\n\nTrump's invocation of the Alien Enemies Act fulfills a pledge he made on the campaign trail to use the law to target suspected gang members, drug dealers and cartel members.\n\n“I’ll invoke immediately the Alien Enemies Act to remove all known or suspected gang members, the drug dealers, the cartel members from the United States, ending the scourge of illegal alien gang violence once and for all,” Trump said during a 2023 campaign speech in Dubuque, Iowa.\n\nTrump is the first president in nearly a century to invoke the Alien Enemies Act, and the first to do so outside of a major conflict. It was last invoked in 1941 by President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, who used the law to target Japanese, German and Italian migrants during World War II, an act that the United States has since apologized for.\n\nDemocratic lawmakers have tried for years to repeal the Alien Enemies Act, with Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., and Sen. Mazie Hirono, D-Hawaii, introducing legislation in January to do so.\n\n“We cannot allow antiquated laws to continue enabling discriminatory practices that harm immigrant communities,” Omar said in a January statement.\n\nSarah Dean and Lawrence Hurley contributed.\n\nThis article first appeared on NBCNews.com.

        "content": "The Eagles are bringing back edge rusher and special teams ace Patrick Johnson on a one-year deal, a league source confirmed to NBC Sports Philadelphia.\n\nThe Athletic’s Dianna Russini first reported the deal.\n\nJohnson, 27, was an Eagles’ seventh-round draft pick out of Tulane in 2021 and played a ton for the Eagles on special teams during his first stint in Philly. But when the Eagles released him in September, he was claimed by the division-rival Giants.\n\nAfter his release, Johnson played in 12 games for the Giants in 2024, totaling 46 defensive snaps and 263 special teams snaps.\n\nGet top local stories in Philly delivered to you every morning. Sign up for NBC Philadelphia's News Headlines newsletter.\n\nIn September, the Eagles released Johnson to create a roster spot they used on backup center Nick Gates because they needed three practice squad players for their Week 2 game but had just two elevations. The Eagles were hoping to get Johnson to their practice squad but the Giants claimed him instead.\n\nDuring his three full seasons with the Eagles, Johnson played more special teams snaps than anyone on the roster with 868. His contributions on defense were limited to just 362 snaps in three years and he played just 38 in 2023, but he was a core special teamer for Michael Clay’s unit.\n\nIn total, Johnson has played in 61 NFL games in his career with 2 starts — 49 of those games and both starts came as a member of the Eagles.\n\nWhile Johnson’s main role will continue to be special teams, he will compete as an edge rusher in camp at a position group that is a bit unsettled as we sit here in March.\n\nSubscribe to Eagle Eye anywhere you get your podcasts:\n\nApple Podcasts | YouTube Music | Spotify | Stitcher | Simplecast | RSS | Watch on YouTube",

        "content": "Nationwide protests are planned this weekend after Mahmoud Khalil, a former Columbia University student activist, was arrested by immigration authorities, fueling tensions between the Trump administration and student movements over immigration policy.\n\nKhalil, 30, was taken into custody by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents in the middle of the night last weekend, prompting outrage in recent days. Khalil, an Algerian citizen of Palestinian descent, helped lead pro-Palestinian demonstrations against the ongoing war between Israel and Hamas at Columbia University last spring.\n\nProtests calling for his release will be held in cities including New York City, Boston, Phoenix, Charlotte, Oklahoma City, Miami and Indianapolis on Saturday and Sunday.\n\nTo justify Khalil's arrest, the Trump administration cited an obscure foreign-policy clause that allows the federal government to deport foreign nationals who are deemed national security threats. The Department of Homeland Security alleges that Khalil “led activities aligned to Hamas, a designated terrorist organization.”\n\nGet top local stories in Philly delivered to you every morning. Sign up for NBC Philadelphia's News Headlines newsletter.\n\nMahmoud Khalil stands by the gates of Columbia University on April 30, 2024. (Olivia Falcigno / USA Today Network file)\n\nOn Monday, a federal judge temporarily blocked the Trump administration from expelling Khalil, a legal permanent resident, from the country as he challenges his deportation.\n\nKhalil filed an amended petition and complaint in federal District Court in Manhattan on Thursday, stating he was the target of \"retaliatory detention and attempted removal of a student protestor because of his constitutionally protected speech.” Khalil finished his classes at Columbia in December 2024 and was expected to graduate in the spring, according to the filing.\n\nImmigration authorities are holding the 30-year-old in Louisiana and his lawyers have petitioned for him to be returned to New York City. His wife, an American, is eight months pregnant.\n\n“I urge you to see Mahmoud through my eyes as a loving husband and the future father to our baby,” she said in a statement through Khalil's defense counsel on Monday. “I need your help to bring Mahmoud home, so he is here beside me, holding my hand in the delivery room as we welcome our first child into this world.”\n\nTrump administration targets campus protesters\n\nKhalil's arrest marks the first fulfilled promise of President Trump's campaign pledge to deport international student protestors who sided with Palestinians on campuses across the country last spring.\n\nOn Tuesday, a doctoral student from India who DHS accused of supporting Hamas, self-deported to Canada. And on Friday, another Palestinian student, identified by the Department of Homeland Security as Leqaa Kordia, who took part in Columbia’s protests last year was arrested for overstaying her student visa, according to DHS.\n\n“It is a privilege to be granted a visa to live and study in the United States of America,” DHS Secretary Kristi Noem said in a statement on Friday. “When you advocate for violence and terrorism that privilege should be revoked, and you should not be in this country.”\n\nDHS agents also raided two Columbia dormitories on Thursday evening, but made no arrests, according to a statement by the university. Commenting on the raids on Friday, Todd Blanche, U.S. deputy attorney general, said that the Justice Department was \"looking at whether Columbia’s handling of earlier incidents violated civil rights laws and included terrorism crimes.”\n\nCivil rights groups and protestors have denounced the federal government's actions at Columbia as an infringement on free speech. Protestors staged demonstrations this week at both the university and inside Trump Tower, located in Manhattan.\n\nColumbia's international students have expressed fear, with several telling NBC News on Friday that they are increasingly hesitant to criticize the Trump administration due to fears of repercussions.\n\nThe university's journalism school said its staff and students are \"witnessing and experiencing an alarming chill.\"\n\n\"One does not have to agree with the political opinions of any particular individual to understand that these threats cut to the core of what it means to live in a pluralistic democracy,\" the journalism school said in a statement issued Friday. \"The use of deportation to suppress foreign critics runs parallel to an aggressive campaign to use libel laws in novel — even outlandish ways — to silence or intimidate the independent press.\"\n\nColumbia University in the glaring spotlight\n\nThe arrests are part of the Trump administration's broader effort to \"root out anti-Semitic harassment in schools and on college campuses.\" And perhaps no other college campus in the country drew more attention for its pro-Palestinian demonstrations last year than Columbia.\n\nFor weeks last spring, student activists staged daily protests, occupied a university building and established an encampment of several dozen tents on university lawns, inspiring similar setups on college campuses across the country. Fueled by frustration over the violence in Gaza, students pushed for their universities to divest from companies linked to the Israeli government. The activism sparked intense debates on campuses, with some students expressing concern over antisemitism.\n\nIn the week before the arrests, the Trump administration singled out Columbia, announcing that it would cancel approximately $400 million in federal grants to the university. The administration cited \"the school's continued inaction in the face of persistent harassment of Jewish students.\"\n\nThe move marked an unprecedented intervention by the federal government into the affairs of a private university.\n\nColumbia responded by pledging to work with the federal government to restore its funding.\n\n\"We take Columbia’s legal obligations seriously and understand how serious this announcement is and are committed to combatting antisemitism and ensuring the safety and wellbeing of our students, faculty, and staff,” a university spokesperson told NBC News last week.\n\nOn Thursday, the university said that it suspended or expelled some of the students who participated and temporarily revoked diplomas of some graduates.\n\nThis article originally appeared on NBCNews.com.

        "content": "A group of House Republicans on Friday put forward legislation seeking to prevent Chinese students from studying in American schools, as some U.S. lawmakers are targeting China over national security concerns.\n\nRep. Riley Moore, R-W.Va., introduced the bill that could bar Chinese nationals from receiving visas that allow foreigners to travel to the U.S. to study or participate in exchange visitor programs. Five other Republicans co-sponsored the measure.\n\nBy granting Chinese nationals such visas, the U.S. has “invited” the Chinese Communist Party \"to spy on our military, steal our intellectual property, and threaten national security,” Moore said in a statement. “It’s time we turn off the spigot and immediately ban all student visas going to Chinese nationals.”\n\nThe measure is unlikely to pass, and it has drawn criticism from organizations and scholars over concerns that hostile policies and rhetoric toward Chinese students could hurt U.S. interests.\n\nGet top local stories in Philly delivered to you every morning. Sign up for NBC Philadelphia's News Headlines newsletter.\n\n“No policy should target individuals solely on the basis of their national origin,\" Fanta Aw, executive director and CEO of NAFSA, an association of international educators, said in a statement.\n\n\"Making international students — the most vetted and tracked nonimmigrants in the United States — a scapegoat for xenophobic and anti-Chinese sentiment is misguided and antithetical to our national interest,\" Aw said.\n\nLiu Pengyu, spokesman for the Chinese embassy in Washington, said China “expresses strong concern and firmly opposes such practices.\" He said education exchange and cooperation has long served as a pillar for the stable development of China-U.S. relations.\n\nThe Asian American Scholars Forum said such legislation would harm the talent pipeline of Asian American scientists, scholars and researchers, undermining U.S. leadership in science and innovation.\n\nDespite the bill's slim chance of getting approved, Yangyang Cheng, research scholar at Yale Law School’s Paul Tsai China Center, said the bill “should be seen as part of a broader effort to restrict academic freedom and hurt higher education in this country, to control what can be taught, which research projects can be pursued, and who have access to the classrooms and laboratories.”\n\nIn the 2023-24 school year, more than 277,000 Chinese students were studying in U.S. universities, or a quarter of the total number of international students, according to an annual report on international students from the Institute of International Education. The number of Chinese students in the U.S., however, has been declining for years. Last year, China lost its status to India as the top feeder country of international students.\n\nIn 2023, Florida passed a law prohibiting state universities from hiring students from China and six other countries for graduate assistant and postdoc positions., and it's been challenged in court. Several U.S. universities have ended academic partnerships with Chinese schools amid mounting pressure from Republican lawmakers over national security concerns.\n\nReactions on China’s social media to the new legislation were varied. Some who said they had recently received offers from American schools expressed concerns, some dismissed it as \"a political show,” and some called it “another Chinese Exclusion Act.”\n\n___\n\nAP writer Didi Tang in Washington contributed to the report.",

That includes players who were originally set to hit free agency and those who were recently cut, like quarterback Aaron Rodgers.\n\nGet top local stories in Philly delivered to you every morning. Sign up for NBC Philadelphia's News Headlines newsletter.\n\nHere's a full updated look at the best remaining NFL free agents (players listed alphabetically by last name):\n\nKeenan Allen, WR, Chicago Bears\n\nIn his first season with the Chicago Bears, Keenan Allen caught 70 of 121 targets for 744 yards and seven touchdowns over 15 games. The six-time Pro Bowler turns 33 in April.\n\nDavid Andrews, C, New England Patriots\n\nDavid Andrews is one of several veterans on this list who were released. After going undrafted in 2015, Andrews signed with the New England Patriots, made 121 starts over nine seasons and won two Super Bowls. Andrews, who turns 33 in July, was limited to four games last season due to a shoulder injury.\n\nJulian Blackmon, S, Indianapolis Colts\n\nJulian Blackmon, 26, made 62 starts with the Indianapolis Colts over his first five pro seasons. The former third-round pick tallied three interceptions, four passes defended and 86 total tackles in 16 games last season. Blackmon's PFF grade ranked 48th out of 170 safeties.\n\nNick Chubb, RB, Cleveland Browns\n\nNick Chubb, 29, made his return last season from a gruesome knee injury suffered early in the 2023 campaign, but didn't look back to his old self. The four-time Pro Bowler carried the ball 102 times for 332 yards (3.3 average) and three scores in eight games, adding five receptions for 31 yards and one score on a Cleveland Browns offense that ranked dead-last in scoring. In Chubb's last full season in 2022, he averaged 5.0 yards per carry while racking up 1,764 yards from scrimmage and 13 total touchdowns.\n\nAmari Cooper, WR, Buffalo Bills\n\nAmari Cooper saw his numbers dip in 2024 as he split time between the Browns and Buffalo Bills. Following a midseason trade to Buffalo, the five-time Pro Bowler caught 20 of 32 targets for 297 yards and two touchdowns over eight games, giving him 44 total receptions for 547 yards and four scores on the year. Cooper, who turns 31 in June, has tallied over 1,000 receiving yards in seven of his 10 pro seasons.\n\nStefon Diggs, WR, Houston Texans\n\nStefon Diggs' first season with the Houston Texans was cut short by a torn ACL suffered in Week 8. Prior to the injury, the four-time Pro Bowler caught 47 of 64 targets for 496 yards and three touchdowns. The 31-year-old had recorded over 1,000 receiving yards in his previous six seasons.\n\nJ.K. Dobbins, RB, Los Angeles Chargers\n\nJ.K. Dobbins, 26, got off to a blazing start last season in his return from an Achilles tear, tallying over 130 rushing yards in each of his first two games with the Los Angeles Chargers. But the former second-round pick didn't reach the 100-yard rushing mark for the rest of the year, finishing with 905 yards and nine touchdowns on 195 carries (4.6 average) over 13 games, and adding 32 receptions for 153 yards. The 13 games played were the most for Dobbins -- who has struggled with injuries -- since his 2020 rookie season.\n\nRasul Douglas, CB, Buffalo Bills\n\nRasual Douglas had a down year in his first full season with the Bills. The 29-year-old didn't record an interception over 15 games and allowed a career-worst 122.0 passer rating when targeted. His PFF grade ranked 132nd out of 223 cornerbacks. For comparison, Douglas had five picks with a 73.1 passer rating allowed in 2023, and four picks with a 88.5 passer rating allowed in 2022.\n\nMatthew Judon, OLB, Atlanta Falcons\n\nThe Patriots traded Matthew Judon to the Atlanta Falcons last August amid a contract dispute. But the 32-year-old pass rusher had one of his least productive seasons in 2024, tallying 5.5 sacks, seven tackles for loss, nine quarterback hits, 41 total tackles and one interception in 17 games. Judon, a four-time Pro Bowler who had 15.5 sacks in his last full season in 2022, had a PFF grade last season that ranked 194th out of 211 edge defenders.\n\nEric Kendricks, LB, Dallas Cowboys\n\nEric Kendricks, playing for his third team in as many seasons, was PFF's 27th-rated linebacker in 2024. The 33-year-old recorded 138 total tackles, two interceptions, three sacks and four tackles for loss in 15 games with the Dallas Cowboys.\n\nVon Miller, OLB, Buffalo Bills\n\nVon Miller's three-year run with the Bills came to an end after he was released in a cost-saving move. The eight-time Pro Bowler, who had zero sacks over 12 games in 2023, tallied six sacks, seven tackles for loss, eight QB hits and 17 total tackles in 13 games last season. While those may not be the gaudy numbers Miller posted in his prime, he was still graded 15th among all edge defenders by PFF. Miller, who turns 36 later this month, is eight sacks away from tying for 10th on the all-time NFL leaderboard.\n\nC.J. Mosley, LB, New York Jets\n\nC.J. Mosley was released by the New York Jets following a five-year tenure that was bookended by injury-shortened seasons. Mosley, who turns 33 in June, was limited to four games in 2024 due to multiple injuries, including a herniated disk in his neck. But the five-time Pro Bowler missed just one total game from 2021-23, ending that stretch with 152 tackles, two forced fumbles, one interception and seven passes defended in 2023.\n\nAzeez Ojulari, OLB, New York Giants\n\nAzeez Ojulari, a second-round pick of the New York Giants in 2021, recorded 22 sacks, 21 tackles for loss, 107 total tackles and 37 QB hits in 46 appearances over his first four pro seasons. In 11 games last season, the 24-year-old had six sacks, seven tackles for loss, 10 QB hits and 28 total tackles. His PFF grade ranked 137th among 211 edge defenders.\n\nCam Robinson, T, Minnesota Vikings\n\nCam Robinson, 29, was traded midseason to the Vikings in 2024 following seven-plus years in Jacksonville. The former second-round pick made 17 starts last season, giving him 101 for his career. He was graded by PFF as the 56th-best tackle out of 141 players, ranking 49th in pass-blocking and 75th in run-blocking.\n\nAaron Rodgers, QB, New York Jets\n\nAaron Rodgers' disastrous 2024 season with the Jets was capped by New York releasing the four-time NFL MVP. The 41-year-old's next destination appears to be down to the Pittsburgh Steelers, the Vikings and the team that shares MetLife Stadium with the Jets -- the Giants. In 17 games last season, Rodgers completed 63% of his passes for 3,897 yards, 28 touchdowns and 11 interceptions, as the Jets went 5-12.\n\nAsante Samuel Jr., CB, Los Angeles Chargers\n\nA shoulder injury limited Asante Samuel Jr. to four games last season. In 2023, the former second-round pick had two interceptions, 13 passes defended and 63 total tackles in 17 games, allowing a passer rating of 87.4 on 96 targets.\n\nBrandon Scherff, G, Jacksonville Jaguars\n\nBrandon Scherff, 33, is coming off three straight 17-game seasons with the Jacksonville Jaguars. The five-time Pro Bowler was graded by PFF as the 53rd-best guard among 135 players, and he ranked 19th in pass-blocking.\n\nTyron Smith, T, New York Jets\n\nTyron Smith was limited due to injury again last season, but the 34-year-old proved he still had it when he was on the field. In his first season away from Dallas, the eight-time Pro Bowler earned the 30th-best PFF grade among tackles while appearing in 10 games. Smith has struggled to stay on the field in recent seasons, missing 44 total games since 2020.\n\nJustin Simmons, S, Atlanta Falcons\n\nJustin Simmons signed a one-year, $7.5 million deal with Atlanta last offseason following eight years in Denver. The two-time Pro Bowler recorded two interceptions, seven passes defended and 62 total tackles over 16 games in 2024, with his PFF grade ranking 113th out of 170 safeties. Simmons, 31, has made 124 starts over his nine-year career.\n\nZa'Darius Smith, DE, Detroit Lions\n\nZa'Darius Smith, who split time between the Browns and Detroit Lions last season, tallied nine sacks, nine tackles for loss, 17 QB hits and 35 total tackles in 17 games. The 32-year-old three-time Pro Bowler was graded by PFF as the 33rd-best edge defender.\n\nKyzir White, LB, Arizona Cardinals\n\nKyzir White started all 17 games in his second season with the Arizona Cardinals, making 137 total tackles, one interception, 2.5 sacks, nine tackles for loss and eight QB hits. White, who turns 29 later this month, was ranked by PFF at 156th among 189 linebackers. He did, however, rank 50th against the run.\n\nRussell Wilson, QB, Pittsburgh Steelers\n\nAs the Steelers reportedly chase Rodgers, Russell Wilson reportedly has met with the Browns and Giants. In his first season with Pittsburgh, Wilson completed 63.7% of his passes for 2,482 yards, 16 touchdowns and five picks in 11 games. The Steelers went 6-5 with the 36-year-old under center before losing to the Baltimore Ravens in the Wild Card Round. If he doesn't return to Pittsburgh, Wilson will be playing for suiting up for his fourth different team in five seasons.\n\nThe 2025 NFL Draft order is officially set following the Philadelphia Eagles’ victory over the Kansas City Chiefs in Super Bowl LIX. Here’s where all 32 teams stand, with the Tennessee Titans securing the No. 1 overall pick.",

        "content": "President Donald Trump said he ordered a series of airstrikes on the Houthi-held areas in Yemen on Saturday, promising to use “overwhelming lethal force” until Iranian-backed Houthi rebels cease their attacks on shipping along a vital maritime corridor. The Houthis said 13 civilians were killed in the capital, Sanaa.\n\n“Our brave Warfighters are right now carrying out aerial attacks on the terrorists’ bases, leaders, and missile defenses to protect American shipping, air, and naval assets, and to restore Navigational Freedom,” Trump said in a social media post. “No terrorist force will stop American commercial and naval vessels from freely sailing the Waterways of the World.”\n\nHe also warned Iran to stop supporting the rebel group, promising to hold the country “fully accountable” for the actions of its proxy. It comes two weeks after the U.S. leader sent a letter to Iranian leaders offering a path to restarting bilateral talks between the countries on Iran’s advancing nuclear weapons program. Trump has said he will not allow it to become operational.\n\nThe Houthis reported explosions in their territory Saturday evening, in Sanaa and the northern province of Saada, the rebels’ stronghold on the border with Saudi Arabia. Images online showed plumes of black smoke over the area of the Sanaa airport complex, which includes a sprawling military facility.\n\nGet top local stories in Philly delivered to you every morning. Sign up for NBC Philadelphia's News Headlines newsletter.\n\nAt least 13 people were killed, said Anees al-Asbahi, spokesman for the Houthi-run health ministry. In a statement on social media, he said another nine were wounded.\n\nA U.S. official said this was the beginning of air strikes on Houthi targets that are expected to continue. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to talk to the press.\n\nNasruddin Amer, deputy head of the Houthi media office, said the airstrikes won’t deter them and they would retaliate against the U.S. “Sanaa will remain Gaza’s shield and support and will not abandon it no matter the challenges,” he added on social media.\n\nAnother spokesman, Mohamed Abdulsalam, on X, called Trump’s claims that the Houthis threaten international shipping routes “false and misleading.”\n\nThe airstrikes come a few days after the Houthis said they would resume attacks on Israeli vessels sailing off Yemen in response to Israel’s latest blockade on Gaza. They described the warning as affecting the Red Sea, the Gulf of Aden, the Bab el-Mandeb Strait and the Arabian Sea.\n\nThere have been no Houthi attacks reported since then.\n\nEarlier this month, Israel halted all aid coming into Gaza and warned of “additional consequences” for Hamas if their fragile ceasefire in the war isn’t extended as negotiations continue over starting a second phase.\n\nThe Houthis had targeted over 100 merchant vessels with missiles and drones, sinking two vessels and killing four sailors, during their campaign targeting military and civilian ships between the start of the war between Israel and Hamas in late 2023 and January of this year, when this ceasefire in Gaza took effect.\n\nNearly 100 protesters were arrested Thursday following a sit-in at Trump Tower in Manhattan to demand the release of Palestinian activist, Mahmoud Khalil.\n\nThe attacks raised the Houthis’ profile as they faced economic and other problems at home amid Yemen’s decade-long stalemated war that’s torn apart the Arab world’s poorest nation.\n\nThe Houthi media office said the U.S. strikes hit a residential neighborhood in Sanaa’s northern district of Shouab. Residents said at least four airstrikes rocked the Eastern Geraf neighborhood there, terrifying women and children.\n\n“The explosions were very strong,” said Abdallah al-Alffi. “It was like an earthquake.”\n\nThe Eastern Geraf is home to Houthi-held military facilities and a headquarters for the rebels' political bureau, located in a densely populated area.\n\nThe Houthis reported fresh strikes on the southwestern Dhamar province late Saturday. They said the strikes hit the outskirts of the provincial capital, also named Dhamar, and the district of Abs.\n\nThe United States, Israel and Britain have previously hit Houthi-held areas in Yemen. Israel’s military declined to comment.\n\nHowever, Saturday's operation was conducted solely by the U.S., according to a U.S. official. It was the first strike on the Yemen-based Houthis under the second Trump administration.\n\nSuch broad-based missile strikes against the Houthis were carried out multiple times by the Biden administration in response to frequent attacks by the Houthis against commercial and military vessels in the region.\n\nThe USS Harry S. Truman carrier strike group, which includes the carrier, three Navy destroyers and one cruiser, are in the Red Sea and were part of Saturday's mission. The USS Georgia cruise missile submarine has also been operating in the region.\n\nTrump announced the strikes as he spent the day at his Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach, Florida.\n\n“These relentless assaults have cost the U.S. and World Economy many BILLIONS of Dollars while, at the same time, putting innocent lives at risk,” Trump said.\n\n___\n\nBaldor reported from Washington and Magdy reported from Cairo.

Click here to learn more about Christian Heating, Cooling, Plumbing & Electrical.\n\nWhile Brita filters and the like have long been popular for drinking water, heightened concerns about what’s in our water have inspired design updates and renewed marketing efforts for products that protect your skin and health, like bathroom sink and shower filters. While there’s no need to run for the hills, these concerns are not unfounded, and regular water testing is essential for maintaining your home’s health and safety. By testing your water frequently, you can detect potential hazards such as contaminants or minerals that could be harmful for your health or lead to other issues in your home. This proactive approach ensures that the water you consume, bathe in, and use for cooking is free from harmful substances. It’s critical to understand the importance of conducting it annually and to understand what to look out for. Read on to learn more about some of the key water issues to watch for and how testing can help maintain a healthy and functional water system in your home.\n\nHard water\n\nGet top local stories in Philly delivered to you every morning. Sign up for NBC Philadelphia's News Headlines newsletter.\n\nHard water, which contains high levels of natural minerals like calcium and magnesium, is a common nuisance that can easily fly under the radar without attentive water testing and treatment. While thankfully these minerals are not harmful to your health, they do pose an inconvenience to several other daily and necessary uses of your water. Hard water can result in faded and stiff clothing due to the mineral buildup on fabric, cause spots and residue on your dishes, and create soap scum building in your shower, while additionally leaving your hair feeling rough and dull. The built-up minerals force your household appliances such as dishwashers to utilize more energy to work harder to filter out the minerals, resulting in a preventable increase in your water bill. Certain short-term solutions can be employed to clean hard water build-up like a vinegar rinse and specialized cleaners. For a more long-term solution, consider a professional water softener system of reverse osmosis system.\n\nMicroplastics\n\nMicroplastics, tiny plastic particles less than five millimeters in size, have become a growing concern in drinking water. These particles originate from plastic waste, synthetic fiers, and even some personal care products, making their way into water sources through runoff and improper disposal. While research is still ongoing, earlt studies suggest that consuming microplastics could have potential health risks, including imflammation, endocrine disruption, and chemical exposure. To reduce microplastic contamination, consider using high-quality filtration systems like activated carbon filters or reverse osmosis systems which are effective at removing small plastic particles. Additionally, reducing plastic waste by using reusable water bottles and avoiding single-use plastic whenever possible can help minimize microplastic pollution for all.\n\nIron\n\nIron is a mineral commonly found in water, but when present in high concentrations, it can lead to several noticeable problems in your home, including discolored water. A frequent result from high iron concentrated water is the staining it causes on sinks, bathtubs, and laundry, leaving unsightly rust-colored marks. While moderate amounts of iron is not harmful to your health, high levels cause an unpleasant and bitter taste in your water. Overtime, if left untreated, the iron buildup can clog your pipes, restricting water flow and potentially leading to costly plumbing repairs.\n\nChlorine\n\nAlthough a necessary component of chlorine is needed in drinking water for bacteria elimination, it must be present in specific and small qualities. According to the U.S Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), chlorine levels up to four milligrams per liter or four parts per million are considered safe in drinking water. These low levels kill germs to ensure suitable drinking conditions, however when chlorine levels rise beyond this, it can compromise the quality of your water. If you’re starting to notice discolored water— whether cloudy, yellow or brown—as well as a foul or strong chlorine taste, this may indicate elevated chlorine levels, affecting both the taste and safety of your water.\n\npH level\n\nThe pH level of your water plays a significant role in both its taste and its impact on your plumbing. Water with a pH lower than seven is too acidic, a level above seven is basic, and pure water is neutral with a pH of seven. Ideally drinking water should be around seven but slightly acidic or alkaline water can still be safe. Low pH can lead to corrosion in your pipes, causing damage overtime and can potentially cause the materials in pipes to break down and release metals such as lead or copper in your water. Testing your water’s pH regularly helps ensure that it stays within the appropriate range, preventing these issues and improving the overall quality of your water.\n\nPer- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS)\n\nPFA’s are long lasting chemicals that slowly break down over time, commonly used in clothing, cookware, and other products used daily by consumers. They can be found present in drinking water, and are notoriously known as “forever chemicals,” due to their persistence and harmful effects on various aspects of one’s health. According to the U.S Environmental Protection Agency, (EPA), exposure to PFA’s can pose risks to reproductive effects for women, development in children, hormones and an increased risk of cancers and cholesterol levels.\n\nAfter scheduling and conducting routine water testing, a proactive solution to maintaining purified water quality is installing a water filtration system. A Reverse Osmosis (RO) system, for example, utilizes semi-permeable water members that filter out contaminants, ensuring clean water conditions. This compact unit is suitable for homes of any size, including houses, apartments, and condos, providing high-quality filtered and disinfected water while occupying minimal space.\n\nConcerned about your water quality?

He averaged 10.9 yards on 58 punt returns and 22.4 yards on 54 kick returns.\n\nHis 10.9 career punt return average is 9th-highest among 24 punt returners with at least 50 returns since 2021 (Jalen Reagor is last on that list at 6.9).\n\nThe Williams signing seems to indicate two things:\n\nGet top local stories in Philly delivered to you every morning.

Obviously it didn’t bother him this year, but the last thing the Eagles need is for one of their top defensive players getting hurt on special teams. DeJean averaged 10.0 yards on 20 returns last year, 7th-highest in the NFL and highest ever by an Eagles rookie; and\n\n2) Britain Covey, who is an unrestricted free agent, probably isn’t coming back. Covey’s 11.3 average from 2022 through 2024 is 4th-highest in the NFL over the last three years and 4th-highest in Eagles history (behind Ernie Steele, who played in the 1940s as well as Brian Mitchell and Darren Sproles).\n\nCovey’s 14.4 average in 2023 was 2nd-highest in the NFL and 3rd-highest in Eagles history (behind Brian Westbrook in 2003 and DeSean Jackson in 2009.\n\nWilliams played cornerback at Boise State as a walk-on and had two career interceptions. The Falcons drafted him in the fifth round in 2021 as a corner, and he played 121 defensive snaps and 272 special teams snaps as a rookie. He was moved to running back before the 2022 season and averaged 5.0 yards on 22 carries in 2022 with 13 catches for 61 yards.\n\nBut he made his biggest impact as a punt returner and his NFL-best 16.2 average on 18 returns in 2022 is 14th-highest by a player averaging at least one return per game since 1975. He missed all of 2023 after suffering a torn ACL on a non-contact play during an open practice at Mercedes-Benz Stadium in June.\n\nHe returned last year and averaged 9.3 yards on 20 punt returns but only played 10 offensive snaps and had no carries or receptions.\n\nWilliams, 26, is the seventh free agent the Eagles have signed, joining tight end Harrison Bryant, edge rusher Josh Uche, cornerback Adoree’ Jackson, running back A.J. Dillon, long snapper Charley Hughlett and edge Patrick Johnson. They’ve also added quarterback Dorian Thompson-Robinson and guard Kenyon Green in trades.\n\nThey’ve lost Milton Williams, Josh Sweat, Isaiah Rodgers, Darius Slay and Oren Burks off the defense and Kenny Gainwell from the offense.\n\nSubscribe to Eagle Eye anywhere you get your podcasts:\n\nApple Podcasts | YouTube Music | Spotify | Stitcher | Simplecast | RSS | Watch on YouTube",

        "content": "An Idaho teacher is in a standoff with her own school district after officials ordered her to remove classroom signs, including one that reads, “Everyone is welcome here.”\n\nSarah Inama, a sixth-grade history teacher at Lewis and Clark Middle School in Meridian, Idaho, says she won't comply with the order, arguing that the message is a fundamental part to ensuring a positive learning environment for her students.\n\nInama, who has taught at the school for five years, says her commitment to inclusivity isn't about politics. It's about her passion for education and students.\n\n“I love the area that I teach,” she says in an interview with TODAY.com. “It’s really a valuable thing for people to know our human history, things that humans have accomplished, our time on this earth, things that they’ve overcome, patterns that exist.”\n\nGet top local stories in Philly delivered to you every morning. Sign up for NBC Philadelphia's News Headlines newsletter.\n\nFive years ago, when she first put up the two signs, it was to make sure students knew they were in an open and welcoming space. Now, she says she is risking her job in the name of those values.\n\nA notice from her school district to remove signs of inclusivity\n\nInama says the controversy began in January when her principal and vice principal came to her classroom to inform her that two posters on her walls were controversial and needed to be removed, a detail the district verified in an email to TODAY.com. Inama says other teachers were given similar instruction, but she was caught off guard by the directive.\n\nPhotos of the two posters show that one features the phrase “Everyone is welcome here,” with an illustration of hands in different skin tones. The other says that everyone in the classroom is \"welcome, important, accepted, respected, encouraged, valued\" and \"equal.\"\n\nOne of the signs being ordered to be taken down. (Courtesy Sarah Inama)\n\n“I was just so confused,” she recalls. “I still can’t even wrap my head around what they’re referring to as far as why it’s controversial.”\n\nInama says the principal cited district policy that classrooms must respect the rights of people to express differing opinions and that decorations are to be “content-neutral.”\n\n“There are only two opinions on this sign: Everyone is welcome here or not everyone is welcome here,\" she says. \"Since the sign is emphasizing that everyone, in regards to race or skin tone, is welcome here no matter what, immediately, I was like, the only other view of this is racist. And I said, ‘That sounds like racism to me.’”\n\nA change of heart\n\nFeeling pressured, Inama removed the signs, but reconsidered as the decision weighed on her into the following weekend.\n\nSarah Inama in her classroom. (Courtesy Sarah Inama)\n\n“I told my husband, ‘I have to put that sign back up,’\" she recalls.\n\nThat Saturday, she says her husband accompanied her back to the school where she re-hung the signs and emailed her principal to let him know.\n\n\"I just was not interested in taking it down,\" she says. \"I didn’t agree with why they were asking me to take it down. And for that reason, it was back up.”\n\nAccording to Inama, the principal warned her that her refusal constituted insubordination and could result in further action.\n\nTODAY.com has reached out to the principal for comment on Inama's allegations but did not receive a response.\n\nDistrict officials ask for a compromise\n\nA meeting was soon arranged with district personnel, including West Ada School District’s chief academic officer Marcus Myers and a West Ada Education Association representative.\n\nIn its email to TODAY.com, West Ada School District states that the meeting was arranged to \"provide further clarification and support\" to Inama and to \"discuss concerns about the poster and how it violates Policy 401.20.\" The policy says that banners in the classroom must be \"content-neutral and conducive to a positive learning enviornment.\"\n\nTODAY.com reached out to Myers for comment regarding the district’s decision and his role in the discussion with Inama but has not yet received a response.\n\nInama says the officials offered to purchase any alternative signs for her classroom during the meeting, just as long as they didn't have the same messages as her current posters. Challenging the request, Inama pointed out that district policy classifies motivational posters as learning aids, which she argued should be allowed under the current rules.\n\nInama says the conversation escalated when Myers attempted to justify the request to remove her posters saying that \"the political environment ebbs and flows, and what might be controversial now might not have been controversial three, six, nine months ago, and we have to follow that.”\n\nThe more the discussion continued, Inama says she became increasingly convinced that what the district was asking her to do was wrong.\n\n“The more that we talked about it, the more it just solidified,” she says. “It seems so gross what they’re asking me to compromise about. I mean, there’s no way you’ll convince me that the differing view they’re trying to protect of that sign is not racist.”\n\nShe says the meeting ended without resolution and another warning, this time that further action might be necessary if she did not comply.\n\nLegal counsel becomes involved\n\nAfter their meeting, Inama says the district offered to have legal counsel review her position, but that she would have to submit an email explaining why she believed the poster did not violate policy.\n\n\"I typed a big, long email and sent it off to them about why it was important for me to keep this poster up and why I don't find it to be in violation,\" Inama explains.\n\nA week later, the district responded, maintaining that the signs violated policy. Inama says she was told she has until the end of the school year to remove them.\n\nIn a statement issued to TODAY.com via email, Niki Scheppers, chief of staff for communications at West Ada School District, explains the district’s decision to enforce its policy.\n\n“West Ada School District has been and always will be committed to fostering a welcoming and supportive learning environment for all students while upholding district policies,” the statement reads.\n\n“Classrooms are places where students learn to read, write, think critically and build the skills needed for future success. While classroom decorations can contribute to the atmosphere, a truly welcoming and supportive environment is built through meaningful relationships and positive interactions between staff and students, not posters on the walls. Our focus is on fostering kindness, respect and academic achievement so that every student can thrive in a distraction-free learning environment.”\n\nAccording to the statement, approved classroom displays include the Idaho state flag, instructional materials like the periodic table or U.S. Constitution, student artwork, approved club information and school-sponsored achievements. Other permitted items include temporary displays of world flags for educational purposes, personal family photos of employees and promotional materials from colleges or professional sports teams.\n\n“This policy is designed to maintain consistency across all classrooms while ensuring that no one group is targeted or offended by the display of certain items.”\n\nThe district underlined that its policies are not intended to limit free speech but to ensure fairness in classroom materials.\n\n“While we respect individuals’ rights to express their perspectives, it is important to reaffirm that this situation is not about limiting speech or expression but about ensuring consistency in our classrooms and maintaining a learning environment free from distraction,” the statement said.\n\nThe district confirmed that legal counsel determined Inama’s poster must be removed and that she has until the end of the school year to find an alternative that complies with policy.\n\nFighting for her students, no matter the cost\n\nDespite the district’s ruling, Inama refuses to remove the signs, even if it means risking her job.\n\nSarah Inama says her students have shown support to her through friendship bracelets. (Courtesy Sarah Inama)\n\n“I would feel so sad to like leave my students before the end of the year, and financially, it would be difficult, but I just feel like your job, like your specific workplace, is not like your whole identity,\" she explains. \"There's no way I would be able to allow myself to just take it down and roll over to what I feel like they're asking me to do.\"\n\nInama says what helps her now is knowing that she is not alone in her resistance. She says hundreds of people — including teachers across the district — have reached out to extend their support since her story became public.\n\n“I'd say at least half of them are from other teachers in this district and in some of the other districts in Idaho and in other states,” she says.\n\nAbove all, Inama says she will prioritize the students seated in her classroom and stand by what she believes to be right.\n\nThis story first appeared on TODAY.com.

        "content": "Chuck E. Cheese wants you to stop by as frequently as you pick up groceries, and it’s selling subscription plans to sweeten the pitch.\n\nThe 47-year-old pizzeria and arcade chain has emerged from bankruptcy with renovated locations, a slew of digital upgrades and a membership program that it hopes will prove both affordable and habit-forming. The goal isn’t to be just someplace to take your kids once or twice a year for birthday parties. It’s to turn Chuck E. Cheese into a routine recreational option that can compete with Netflix and the neighborhood playground alike.\n\n“For us to win this game, we need to drive multi-visitation,” David McKillips, the president and CEO of Chuck E. Cheese’s parent company, told NBC News in January.\n\nGet top local stories in Philly delivered to you every morning. Sign up for NBC Philadelphia's News Headlines newsletter.\n\nThe chain launched a membership program in August 2024 and said Tuesday that it has sold 200,000 12-month subscriptions since then, with three tiers ranging from $7.99 to $29.99 a month. Annual “Fun Pass” holders get unlimited visits, discounts on food and attractions, and other perks to encourage what McKillips described as “active play” — a post-pandemic priority for customers.\n\nEven at the upper price point, he said, “it is very reasonable for parents and families to come out and have a reasonably priced pizza and gameplay every single day.”\n\nMaking memberships work will require Chuck E. Cheese to carve a place in consumers’ wallets alongside their other subscriptions — for everything from streaming services to wholesale clubs — at a time when many are looking to trim their spending.\n\nThe upgrades are designed to ensure visitors find something new every time they walk through the doors, McKillips said.\n\nIt is very reasonable for parents and families to come out and have a reasonably priced pizza and gameplay every single day. David McKillips, ceo of cec entertainment\n\nGone are most of the chain’s iconic animatronics, though the company agreed to hang on to more of them at select locations after a fan outcry. McKillips acknowledged that “Five Nights at Freddy’s,” a 2023 horror flick based on a video game series in which the robomascots of a defunct pizza chain are possessed by the spirits of dead children, “had some impact regarding the brand overall.”\n\nBut he added, “People were talking about Chuck E. Cheese, which is good for us.”\n\nNow there are far fewer life-size rodent musicians and more jumbotrons, a digital dance floor and other displays for digital media that can be refreshed continuously.\n\n“We just switched out of our holiday content,” McKillips said at the start of the year. “Then it goes into evergreen, and then we’ve got spring and a summer of fun and Halloween.”\n\nChuck E. Cheese is also revamping its play spaces to include trampolines and obstacle courses, part of an effort to “create an adventure zone in every single one of our locations,” McKillips said.\n\nThe brand recently invested $350 million to remodel its over 460 U.S. locations, launch a new slate of games and tweak its food offerings. The changes are part of a turnaround effort after the company filed for bankruptcy in 2020, when Covid-19 slammed into brick-and-mortar businesses of all kinds. The company avoided mass store closures, in part by using idled Chuck E. Cheese kitchens to prepare food for delivery under the name Pasqually’s Pizza & Wings. McKillips said that solution kept all the chain’s general managers employed.\n\nThe company is also refreshing its food menu with more “grown-up” options, including items that cater to “a little bit spicier palate.” And while Chuck E. Cheese has plenty of options to entertain 4- and 5-year-olds, “the teenagers come in, you know, older siblings — we’ve got games for them as well,” McKillips said.\n\nThe effort to appeal to the full range of family tastes is key to getting “parents and kids playing together,” he said. “That is the greatest driver of our guests and how we built the entire new Chuck E. Cheese.”\n\nAt the same time, the brand wants its upgraded experience to remain affordable, and it’s pitching its membership options as a way for families to blow off steam together on a budget.\n\n“There is no doubt that today’s young families are hurting,” McKillips said. “They’re strapped.”\n\nHouseholds have been tightening their belts lately, and major retailers are increasingly sounding alarms about a potentially rough year ahead. Consumers are growing more pessimistic about inflation and the state of the economy as the Trump administration’s expanding trade war rattles businesses and Wall Street alike.\n\nIt’s a challenge for any brand to turn occasional customers into regulars, especially in a climate like this, but subscriptions can do the trick if they’re designed well, said Ed Crouch, who analyzes loyalty programs as a managing director and senior partner at Boston Consulting Group.\n\nThe simplicity of a recurring charge has a certain appeal. “It’s easy, it feels low-cost,” he said, adding that people tend to sign up for economic reasons as much as emotional ones. “It feels like you know you’re going to get a somewhat more exclusive experience.”\n\nSuccessful subscription programs tend to be tiered, simple to understand and provide intangible value, Crouch said. But according to his research, consumers these days are juggling an average of 15 paid and free memberships at once, from streaming services to airline loyalty, delivery and gym memberships. Brands are constantly competing to offer the best benefits and maintain customer loyalty, which also declines with each added subscription, he said.\n\n“It is very saturated today, and we don’t think that’s going to change,” Crouch said.\n\nSometimes, a subscription program can work with even a fraction of customers enrolled, Crouch said, as long as they visit more often than they otherwise would and the business has other revenue streams. But with less than 10% of customers signed up, Crouch said, the costs of running a membership program often outweigh its benefits.\n\nChuck E. Cheese is also offering a two-month “Fun Pass” option, paid for upfront, but monthly rates for its full-year membership plans are lower. Those require committing to 12 monthly charges, after which passholders can cancel. McKillips is optimistic yearlong members will stick with it, adding that the chain will continue to update its games and food offerings so the experience evolves.\n\n“Our entertainment is different every time you come in, and that gives you a reason to come back,” he said.\n\nThis story first appeared on NBCNews.com.

Sign up for NBC Philadelphia's News Headlines newsletter.\n\n“Since coming to Villanova, I have been struck by Kyle’s tireless work ethic and his dedication to the student-athletes he served,” Roedl said. “We are grateful to Kyle for his long service to Villanova and his mentorship to the many outstanding young men he has coached.”\n\nNeptune replaced Jay Wright as head coach after his retirement in 2022.\n\n\"In three seasons, Neptune posted a 54-47 record (.535), including a 19-14 mark in 2024-25 (.576) that included victories over Top 25 opponents Connecticut, St. John’s and Marquette,\" a spokesperson with the school wrote in a statement.\n\nThis comes as the Wildcats — who won two national championships under Wright — lost to UConn on Thursday night in a Big East Conference Tournament quarterfinal at Madison Square Garden.\n\nThe 40-year-old Neptune served under Wright on the Villanova coaching staff before accepting the head coaching position at Fordham in 2021. Neptune went 16-16 in his lone season at Fordham.\n\nWright, who was inducted into the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame in 2021, guided Villanova to titles in 2016 and 2018 and led the Wildcats to two other Final Four appearances. He went 520-197 in 21 seasons at the school and has remained a steady presence at Villanova games. He now works for CBS.\n\nThe Wildcats will miss the NCAA Tournament for a third straight season for the first time since Wright’s first three seasons more than 20 years ago. Wright was given the grace period Neptune was not in large part because this was no rebuild on the Main Line — the program boasted healthy NIL coffers and had the nation’s leading scorer this season in Eric Dixon.\n\nVillanova could still play in the new College Basketball Crown tournament later this month in Las Vegas.",

She was last seen around 4:15 a.m. on March 6 after going to the beach with friends.\n\nSpeaking exclusively to NBC News briefly at the resort where Konanki had been staying before her disappearance, Riibe said, “I’m just trying to help them out,” adding: “The ocean is a dangerous place.”\n\nRiibe “has been confined to the hotel since the investigation began.

A wave crashed, taking them both \"out to sea.\"\n\n\"I kept trying to get her to breathe, but that didn't allow me to breathe all the time, and I swallowed a lot of water,\" he said, telling investigators that he used to work as a lifeguard.\n\nRiibe said he got Konanki back to shore before she went missing.\n\n\"The last time I saw her, I asked if she was OK.

And that was just day one at the New Colossus Festival, held last week.\n\nThe six-day event takes its name from the poem cast on the Statue of Liberty, viewed as a welcome message for new immigrants: “Give me your tired, your poor, Your huddled masses….”\n\nAlmost 200 artists were scheduled to perform, more than half from outside the United States. But New Colossus may be an exception, not the rule, for international artists hoping to perform in the U.S. In the last few years, the process has grown much more arduous and expensive.\n\nGet top local stories in Philly delivered to you every morning. Sign up for NBC Philadelphia's News Headlines newsletter.\n\n“It’s already at the maximum level of difficulty that we can rationalize,” said Mischa Dempsey, frontperson for the thrilling Montreal band Knitting, who performed at New Colossus and described the process as “labor intensive.”\n\n“I can’t even think about it getting worse.”\n\nHow did we get here?\n\nOn April 1, 2024, the USCIS introduced a visa fee increase, raising the cost from $460 to over $1,615 per musician application, the first bump since 2016. According to the USCIS website, the increase allows the organization to “recover our operating costs more fully and support timely processing of new applications.”\n\nNearly a year later, “we are seeing the opposite,” immigration attorney Gabriel Castro said. “We are seeing cases actually slow down.”\n\nThe USCIS did not respond to an email from the AP.\n\nVisa processing times slow\n\nChanges to the system have caused delays. According to Tamizdat, a nonprofit that advocates for international artist mobility, all visa petitions are now filed through a centralized service center in Texas and are randomly divvyed up to preexisting California and Vermont service centers.\n\nThe result has been slowed processing times. Matthew Covey, an immigration attorney and Tamizdat's executive director, says Vermont has gone from one month to three. In California, it previously took two to four months, but now, it's eight.\n\n“Nobody’s filing petitions long enough in advance to sustain an eight-month delay,” says Covey. “You got a 50/50 chance of it being done in a reasonable amount of time or having to pay an extra $2,800 to expedite it.”\n\nCastro says small and mid-tier artists don’t have the luxury of spending nearly $3,000 on expedited processing or booking tour dates eight months in advance. “And you have to have those tour dates before you apply for the visa,\" he adds.\n\n“It’s just more expensive than ever to try and do a tour in the U.S. And that’s a problem,” says Jen Jacobsen, executive director at The Artist Rights Alliance. “And I wouldn’t say the fee change by itself has had the impact — it’s a combination of inefficiencies and delays.”\n\nAre international artists avoiding the U.S.?\n\nThe headlines are frequent: The K-pop group KARD canceled its 2025 U.S. tour due to visa issues. So did the Canadian metal band Respire. The up-and-coming Swedish rapper Bladee delayed his 2024 tour for similar issues. In the film world, Iranian co-directors Hossein Molayemi and Shirin Sohani took home an Oscar for their animated short, “In the Shadow of the Cypress” — after arriving in Los Angeles just hours before, due to visa delays.\n\nAll international musicians require work authorization to perform in the U.S. There are scarce exemptions available to only a few, like the Visa Waiver Program, which is often used at South by Southwest.\n\n“The safest approach is always to get a ... visa,” says Castro.\n\nJacobsen says “there’s definitely a buzz about whether touring in the U.S. is still a good economic option” for these artists.\n\n“I’m hearing more and more frequently from artists who are just like, ‘I’m going to take a break from the U.S. for a while. It’s not a return on my investment. It’s not worth it,’” says Covey.\n\nWho is most affected?\n\nDelays and fee increases disproportionally affect “world music artists, jazz, indie bands who are developing,” says Covey, as well as “artists outside of Europe who have government support … if they come in from the Global South, they generally are not going to have a lot of government funding to cover these kinds of costs.”\n\nNew Colossus' lineups have benefited from governments who support local artists. “Countries like Germany, England,Canada, France, Ireland and Wales have funding bodies that the bands apply for,” says Steven Matrick, one of the New Colossus Festival founders. “They recognize our festival as a showcase festival. And the bands get funded to come here by those bodies.”\n\nBut still, that does not make them immune to last-minute cancellations. This year, artists from Ireland, Scotland and Italy canceled. A band from Paraguay was held up by visa delays; they arrived after their second scheduled performance straight from the airport. Hiçamahiç, a band from Istanbul, had to cancel entirely.\n\nIn a statement, Hiçamahiç explained that two band members couldn’t get visa appointments in time, despite working with an intermediary agency. “The U.S. is currently issuing standard visa interview dates for Turkish citizens nearly 1,000 days later, which feels like an elitist form of discrimination. We are deeply disappointed by this situation,” they wrote. “We don’t think we are any different from a citizen of the U.K. or Germany.”\n\nMatrick says, “We have probably 10 cancellations a year, with people that don’t get the funding to purchase visas,” or their visas are not processed in time.\n\nCastro reminds that the loss of international talent stateside is not just a cultural one, but economic. “It’s a loss for the venues ... the bars, the parking lots,” he lists.\n\nConcerns under a new presidency\n\n“Based on the last Trump administration, what we saw over the course of the four years were increasing problems with consular process,” Covey says. “The delay times increased. The number of errors increased. Obviously, the scrutiny ... increased.\"\n\n“We’re expecting that we will probably start seeing increased delays in the visa processing at U.S. embassies,\" he adds. And in a period of global conflict, “your indie rock band is really not priority.”\n\nCastro said it is early to make predictions “of what this is going to look like in the future ... But that doesn’t mean that changes in immigration, generally, can affect these visas tangentially. The slow-down in immigration processes is a slow down for everyone.”\n\n“Some of the policies about clamping down on illegal immigration sometimes flow into areas — unintended areas, perhaps — but areas that can impact legal immigration,” says Jacobsen. “If we want a rich palette of artistry to be here, we have to make it a welcoming environment for them.”\n\nThere are other potential impacts: At the end of last month, the U.S. government ordered a visa ban on transgender athletes looking to enter the U.S. for sports events. “They’re just talking about enforcing it on athletes, but it doesn’t take very much to imagine them enforcing that on anyone,” says Covey. \"I’m concerned that the political agendas of the current administration could impact which artists get visas and which don’t.”\n\nDempsey, of the band Knitting, said: “Three of us are gender nonconforming and I think more than anything, we're scared of what it’s going to be like in the States, what it’s going to be like to cross the border.\"",

That included the U.S. Agency for Global Media, which houses Voice of America, Radio Free Europe and Asia and Radio Marti, which beams Spanish-language news into Cuba.\n\nOn Saturday morning, Kari Lake, the failed Arizona gubernatorial and U.S. Senate candidate whom Trump named a senior advisor to the agency, posted on X that employees should check their email. That coincided with notices going out placing Voice of America staff on paid administrative leave.\n\nThe agency also sent notices terminating grants to Radio Free Asia and other programming run by the agency. Voice of America transmits United States domestic news into other countries, often translated into local languages. Radio Free Asia, Europe and Marti beam news into countries with authoritarian regimes in those regions like China, North Korea and Russia.\n\nGet top local stories in Philly delivered to you every morning.

They date back to the Cold War and are part of a network of government-funded organizations trying to extend U.S. power and combat authoritarianism that includes USAID, another agency targeted by Trump.\n\nThe latest reductions are especially provocative because the Agency for Global Media is an independent agency chartered by Congress, which passed a law in 2020 limiting the power of the agency's presidentially appointed executives. Trump has already taken several moves to gut congressionally-mandated programs, setting up a potential Supreme Court showdown over the limits of presidential power.\n\nTrump's order requiring reductions also includes several other, lesser-known government agencies such as the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, a nonpartisan think tank, the United States Interagency Council on Homelessness and the Community Development Financial Institutions Fund.\n\nThe Trump administration has already made several controversial moves regarding Voice of America, including suspending a respected journalist who noted criticism of Trump and canceling contracts that allowed VOA to use material from independent news organizations, such as the Associated Press.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Matthew Lee in Washington contributed to this report.",

        "content": "Wide receiver Parris Campbell, who bounced back and forth from the Eagles’ active roster to the practice squad this past season, has reached a contract agreement with the Cowboys, according to ESPN’s Adam Schefter.\n\n\n\nCampbell was an unrestricted free agent. The Cowboys will be his fourth team in four years.\n\n\n\nCampbell, the Colts’ 2nd-round pick in 2019, has 123 catches for 1,117 yards and six touchdowns in six NFL seasons. His 22.8 career yards per game is 18th-lowest in NFL history by a wide receiver drafted in the first two rounds who started at least 25 games.\n\n\n\nIn his one year with the Eagles, Campbell played 140 offensive snaps in five games and caught six passes for 30 yards. He caught a touchdown in the Week 4 loss to the Buccaneers in Tampa.\n\n\n\nCampbell hasn’t had 30 yards in a game since late in the 2022 season with the Colts. That was his best year, with 63 catches for 623 yards and three TDs. He spent 2023 with the Giants before signing with the Eagles.\n\n\n\nThe Eagles signed Campbell last March 21 with the hope that he could compete for the No. 3 wide receiver spot behind A.J. Brown and DeVonta Smith. But that didn't work out, and they instead traded for Jahan Dotson, a former 1st-round pick with the Commanders.\n\nCampbell was released at the end of training camp and signed with the Eagles' practice squad. After his three game-day elevations were used up he had three separate stints on the 53-man roster.\n\n\n\nHe played 24 offensive snaps in the postseason without a target. Eight of those snaps were in mop-up time vs. Washington and 16 in mop-up time during the Super Bowl.\n\n\n\nThe Cowboys are thin at wide receiver behind CeeDee Lamb, with Cowboys 2022 3rd-round pick Jalen Tolbert, former Panthers 2nd-round pick Jonathan Mingo and return specialist KaVontae Turpin in the mix going into the draft.\n\n\n\nCampbell played high school football at St. Vincent-St. Mary in Akron, also the alma mater of LeBron James.\n\nSubscribe to Eagle Eye anywhere you get your podcasts:\n\nApple Podcasts | YouTube Music | Spotify | Stitcher | Simplecast | RSS | Watch on YouTube",

The Wildcats - who won two national championships under Wright - lost to UConn on Thursday night in a Big East Conference Tournament quarterfinal at Madison Square Garden.\n\nIt was the first major decision made by Eric Roedl, a Villanova alumnus hired earlier this season as the athletic director.\n\nVillanova's Kyle Neptune coaches during an NCAA college basketball game, Wednesday, Feb. 12, 2025, in Villanova, Pa. (AP Photo/Matt Slocum)\n\n\"Since coming to Villanova, I have been struck by Kyle's tireless work ethic and his dedication to the student-athletes he served,\" Roedl said in a statement. \"We are grateful to Kyle for his long service to Villanova and his mentorship to the many outstanding young men he has coached.\"\n\nNeptune felt the heat this season as the Wildcats - once a perennial Big East winner and national title contender - slid into mediocrity and out of national prominence. Not even regular-season wins over St. John's and UConn could offset the overall lack of consistency in a season that also included losses to Columbia and Saint Joseph's.\n\nThe 40-year-old Neptune served under Wright on the Villanova coaching staff before accepting the head coaching position at Fordham in 2021. Neptune went 16-16 in his lone season at Fordham.\n\nWright, who was inducted into the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame in 2021, guided Villanova to titles in 2016 and 2018 and led the Wildcats to two other Final Four appearances. He went 520-197 in 21 seasons at the school and has remained a steady presence at Villanova games. He now works for CBS.\n\nThe Wildcats will miss the NCAA Tournament for a third straight season for the first time since Wright's first three seasons more than 20 years ago. Wright was given the grace period Neptune was not in large part because this was no rebuild on the Main Line - the program boasted healthy NIL coffers and had the nation's leading scorer this season in Eric Dixon.\n\nVillanova could still play in the new College Basketball Crown tournament later this month in Las Vegas.\n\nAssistant Mike Nardi will serve as interim head coach.\n\nThe program that once anchored its success on the Villanova Way - a mini-dynasty built on NBA-ready upperclassmen - has become discombobulated under the roster chaos born of NIL money and the transfer portal. The yearly roster turnover has done little to build the culture - where senior stars once taught the new kids the concept of Villanova basketball - that was once a championship hallmark under Wright.\n\nWell-liked and respected by all in the program, Neptune had downplayed criticism throughout his tenure, insisting over the last two seasons as fan unrest grew on the suburban campus that he didn't hear fans who booed him at times during pregame introductions or the horde that chanted \"Fire Neptune!\"\n\nWright floored Villanova when he retired at 60 years old just weeks after leading the Wildcats to a Final Four in 2022. Neptune was hired the same month. He first came to Villanova in 2008, serving two seasons as video coordinator. Neptune returned as an assistant coach in 2013 and worked under Wright as Villanova rose into a perennial Final Four contender.\n\nThat success as an assistant never carried over once Neptune got the top job. Villanova now will look to hire only its fifth coach since 1973.\n\nThe question is, will ties to Wright even matter as the search for a new coach ramps up or will Villanova look outside the program for a fresh start?",

What does this mean for borrowers?\n\nAccess to student loan repayment plans blocked. What does this mean for borrowers?\n\nPHILADELPHIA (WPVI) -- Recent changes to federal student loans have sparked chaos and confusion among borrowers.\n\nThe Trump Administration has blocked access to certain student loan repayment plans, while at the same time laying off the very people who can answer questions from borrowers.\n\nMillions now face financial uncertainty. To make matters worse, the agency that oversees the federal loan system is laying off half of its workforce. The wait time to talk to someone at the Department of Education is reportedly about four hours, and the government's loan assistance website suffered an outage this week.\n\nConsumers' anxiety was sparked by the government putting a pause on income-driven repayment plans, which take into account a borrower's finances and family size and have some forgiveness or loan cancellation built into them.\n\n\"The Trump Administration said, no, we are not going to continue to forgive loans through these programs. Let's put this on hold,\" said Sonia Lewis, the CEO of the Student Loan Doctor.\n\nNow the Education Department has taken down online and paper applications for those plans, which also means people can't manage or modify their accounts.\n\n\"Right now, if I was a borrower, I would log into StudentAid.gov and I would print out and literally take a look at all of my records,\" said Lewis.\n\nSo if your loans are transferred, you have a clear, accurate record of what you owe.\n\nAlso, confirm your recertification deadlines with your loan servicers.\n\n\"The second thing is, you can also make a complaint, a formal complaint through studentaid.gov if you find that once we go back into repayment that this is a hardship,\" said Lewis.\n\nYou can opt to pause payments now through deferment and forbearance, but beware.\n\n\"They can be costly for borrowers, and they will extend the time that borrowers pay on their loans. But if there is a choice between making a student loan payment or feeding your family. That is an option that is available to people,\" said Persis Yu of the Student Borrower Protection Plan.\n\nYu also advises borrowers who are struggling to reach out to their congressional representatives.\n\nMeantime, Lewis hosts a free online workshop every week. Anyone can log on and ask questions.",

And then she came into my kitchen and we took a picture, and I was like, 'Oh my God.' Because I just watched 'The Fall Guy,' and 'A Quiet Place,' and 'Devil Wears Prada' is one of my favorite movies. And she's just so really down to Earth,\" said Chiarella\n\nShe told Action News it's a night she won't soon forget.\n\nSEE ALSO: Steven Spielberg spotted on set of new film in Buena Vista Twp.\n\n\n\n\"And I hope she won't forget.

Five more people were hospitalized, for a total of 34. The outbreak has spread to two new counties: Cochran in West Texas with six and Lamar in the northeast part of the state with four.\n\nNew Mexico health officials announced two new cases Friday, bringing the state's total to 35. Most of the cases are in Lea County, where two people are hospitalized. Eddy County has two cases.\n\nOklahoma's state health department reported two probable cases of measles Tuesday, saying they are \"associated\" with the West Texas and New Mexico outbreaks.\n\nA school-age child died of measles in Texas last month, and New Mexico reported its first measles-related death in an adult last week.\n\nWhere else is measles showing up in the U.S.?\n\nMeasles cases have been reported in Alaska, California, Florida, Georgia, Kansas, Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington.\n\nThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention defines an outbreak as three or more related cases - and there have been three clusters that qualified as outbreaks in 2025.\n\nIn the U.S., cases and outbreaks are generally traced to someone who caught the disease abroad. It can then spread, especially in communities with low vaccination rates. In 2019, the U.S. saw 1,274 cases and almost lost its status of having eliminated measles.\n\nDo you need an MMR booster?\n\nThe best way to avoid measles is to get the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine. The first shot is recommended for children between 12 and 15 months old and the second between 4 and 6 years old.\n\nPeople at high risk for infection who got the shots many years ago may want to consider getting a booster if they live in an area with an outbreak, said Scott Weaver with the Global Virus Network, an international coalition. Those may include family members living with someone who has measles or those especially vulnerable to respiratory diseases because of underlying medical conditions.\n\nAdults with \"presumptive evidence of immunity\" generally don't need measles shots now, the CDC said. Criteria include written documentation of adequate vaccination earlier in life, lab confirmation of past infection or being born before 1957, when most people were likely to be infected naturally.\n\nA doctor can order a lab test called an MMR titer to check your levels of measles antibodies, but health experts don't always recommend this route and insurance coverage can vary.\n\nGetting another MMR shot is harmless if there are concerns about waning immunity, the CDC says.\n\nPeople who have documentation of receiving a live measles vaccine in the 1960s don't need to be revaccinated, but people who were immunized before 1968 with an ineffective measles vaccine made from \"killed\" virus should be revaccinated with at least one dose, the agency said. That also includes people who don't know which type they got.\n\nWhat are the symptoms of measles?\n\nMeasles first infects the respiratory tract, then spreads throughout the body, causing a high fever, runny nose, cough, red, watery eyes and a rash.\n\nThe rash generally appears three to five days after the first symptoms, beginning as flat red spots on the face and then spreading downward to the neck, trunk, arms, legs and feet. When the rash appears, the fever may spike over 104 degrees Fahrenheit, according to the CDC.\n\nMost kids will recover from measles, but infection can lead to dangerous complications such as pneumonia, blindness, brain swelling and death.\n\nHow can you treat measles?\n\nThere's no specific treatment for measles, so doctors generally try to alleviate symptoms, prevent complications and keep patients comfortable.\n\nWhy do vaccination rates matter?\n\nIn communities with high vaccination rates - above 95% - diseases like measles have a harder time spreading through communities. This is called \"herd immunity.\"\n\nBut childhood vaccination rates have declined nationwide since the pandemic and more parents are claiming religious or personal conscience waivers to exempt their kids from required shots.\n\nThe U.S. saw a rise in measles cases in 2024, including an outbreak in Chicago that sickened more than 60.",

        "content": "Trump invokes wartime Alien Enemies Act to speed up deportations, judge stalls it hours later\n\nPresident Donald Trump has invoked the wartime Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to declare invasion by gangs and speed up mass deportations.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has invoked the wartime Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to declare invasion by gangs and speed up mass deportations.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has invoked the wartime Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to declare invasion by gangs and speed up mass deportations.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has invoked the wartime Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to declare invasion by gangs and speed up mass deportations.\n\nWASHINGTON -- A federal judge on Saturday barred the administration of President Donald Trump from deportations under an 18th century law that Trump invoked just hours earlier asserting the United States was being invaded by a Venezuelan gang and that he had new powers to remove its members from the country.\n\nThe video in the player above is from a previous report.\n\nJames E. Boasberg, chief judge for the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, said he needed to issue his order immediately because the government was already flying migrants it claimed were newly deportable under Trump's proclamation to El Salvador and Honduras to be incarcerated there. El Salvador already agreed this week to take up to 300 migrants that the Trump administration designated as gang members.\n\n\"I do not believe I can wait any longer and am required to act,\" Boasberg said during a Saturday evening hearing in a lawsuit brought by the ACLU and Democracy Forward. \"A brief delay in their removal does not cause the government any harm,\" he added, noting they remain in government custody but ordering that any planes in the air be turned around.\n\nThe ruling came hours after Trump claimed the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua was invading the United States and invoked the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, a sweeping wartime authority that allows the president broader leeway on policy and executive action to speed up mass deportations.\n\nThe act has only been used three times before in U.S. history, all during wars. Its most recent application was during World War II, when it was used to incarcerate Germans and Italians as well as for the mass internment of Japanese-American civilians.\n\nIn a proclamation released just over an hour before Boasberg's hearing, Trump contended that Tren de Aragua was effectively at war with the United States.\n\n\"Over the years, Venezuelan national and local authorities have ceded ever-greater control over their territories to transnational criminal organizations, including TdA,\" Trump's statement reads. \"The result is a hybrid criminal state that is perpetrating an invasion of and predatory incursion into the United States, and which poses a substantial danger to the United States.\"\n\nThe order could let the administration deport any migrant it identifies as a member of the gang without going through regular immigration proceedings, and also could remove other protections under criminal law for people the government targeted.\n\nThe Tren de Aragua gang originated in a prison in the South American country and accompanied an exodus of millions of Venezuelans, the overwhelming majority of whom were seeking better living conditions after their nation's economy came undone last decade. Trump and his allies have turned the gang into the face of the alleged threat posed by immigrants living in the U.S. illegally and formally designated it a \"foreign terrorist organization\" last month.\n\nAuthorities in several countries have reported arrests of Tren de Aragua members, even as Venezuela's government claims to have eliminated the criminal organization.\n\nThe government said Trump actually signed the order Friday night. Immigration lawyers noticed the federal government suddenly moving to deport Venezuelans who they would not otherwise have the legal right to expel from the country, and scrambled to file lawsuits to block what they believed was a pending proclamation.\n\nBoasberg issued an initial order at 9:20 a.m. Saturday blocking the Trump administration from deporting five Venezuelans named as plaintiffs in the ACLU suit who were being detained by the government and believed they were about to be deported. The Trump administration appealed that order, contending that halting a presidential act before it has been announced would cripple the executive branch.\n\nIf the order were allowed to stand, \"district courts would have license to enjoin virtually any urgent national-security action just upon receipt of a complaint,\" the Justice Department wrote in its appeal.\n\nBoasberg then scheduled the afternoon hearing on whether to expand his order to all people who could be targeted under Trump's declaration.\n\nDeputy Assistant Attorney General Drew Ensign contended that the president had broad latitude to identify threats to the country and act under the 1798 law. He noted the U.S. Supreme Court allowed President Harry Truman to continue to hold a German citizen in 1948, three years after World War II ended, under the measure.\n\n\"This would cut very deeply into the prerogatives of the president,\" Ensign said of an injunction.\n\nBut Lee Gelernt of the ACLU noted the law has only been invoked three times before and contended that Trump didn't have the authority to use it against a criminal gang rather than a recognized state. Boasberg said that precedent on the question seemed tricky but that the ACLU had a reasonable chance of success on those arguments, and so the order was merited.\n\nBoasberg halted deportations for those in custody for up to 14 days, and scheduled a Friday hearing in the case.\n\nThe flurry of litigation shows the significance of Trump's declaration, the latest step by the administration to expand presidential power. Ensign argued that, as part of its reaction to the Sept. 11, 2001 attack, Congress had given the president power to delegate \"transnational\" organizations threats on the level of recognized states. And Gelernt warned that the Trump administration could simply issue a new proclamation to use the Alien Enemies Act against another migrant gang, like MS-13, which has long been one of Trump's favorite targets.\n\nAssociated Press writer Regina Garcia Cano in Caracas, Venezuela, contributed to this report.\n\n",

The lawsuit accused Starbucks of breaching its duty of care by failing to secure the lid.\n\nMichael Parker, Garcia's lawyer, said his client was picking up three beverages and one of the hot drinks wasn't fully pushed into the container. When the barista handed Garcia the order, a drink fell out of the container and onto Garcia, Parker said.\n\nGarcia's damages included physical pain, mental anguish, loss of enjoyment of life, humiliation, inconvenience, grief, disfigurement, physical impairment, anxiety and emotional distress, according to a recording of the verdict from Courtroom View Network.\n\nStarbucks said it plans to appeal the verdict.\n\n\"We sympathize with Mr. Garcia, but we disagree with the jury's decision that we were at fault for this incident and believe the damages awarded to be excessive,\" a company spokesperson said in a statement. \"We have always been committed to the highest safety standards in our stores, including the handling of hot drinks.\"\n\nThe lawsuit is reminiscent of a famous 1994 lawsuit against McDonald's in which a woman spilled hot coffee on her lap and suffered third-degree burns. The plaintiff in that case, Stella Liebeck, was originally awarded nearly $3 million.\n\n(The-CNN-Wire & 2025 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company. All rights reserved.)",

(WPVI) -- Wildwood police arrested five men in connection with the alleged unprovoked attack on an off-duty Stone Harbor police officer.\n\nIt happened around 11 p.m. on Wednesday while the victim was running on the boardwalk in Wildwood.\n\nAccording to charging documents, video shows five men following the victim on the boardwalk. At one point, one of the suspects, wearing a black hooded sweatshirt and red shorts, can reportedly be seen throwing an unidentified object toward the off-duty officer.\n\nThe video doesn't appear to capture the assault, but authorities say all five men were seen running from the last observed location of the victim.\n\nThe alleged attacker, Isaiah Ortiz, 19, is accused of beating the officer to the point where he was left unconscious.\n\nThe victim was beaten so badly that he suffered a concussion and facial fractures that required surgery, investigators said.

As in his other press conferences this season, the Union head coach is coming off another statement victory and has quickly moved on from that, as the team looks to extend its winning streak to four games on Sunday afternoon.\n\nWhile Subaru Park is gradually becoming a fortress that sends waves of anxiety down the spines of opponents, the Union team is largely beginning to look like the latest bullies in the MLS this season, whether home or away.\n\nImage Credit: Philadelphia Union\n\nCarnell reflects on Union’s last W and prepares for clash with Nashville\n\nA week ago, at Gillette Stadium, the Union bullied the New England Revolution to a 2-0 away win, with goals from Tai Baribo and Jovan Lukic. Despite this, Carnell has come off that victory with mainly lessons for the coming games.\n\n“… just keep on doing the good things and we’ll take the learnings and findings that we did in video and apply them, because some of the issues or some of the pictures we saw with their strike force: Campana, Carles Gil in transitions. They can be really dangerous.’\n\nThere is no doubt that Carnell is obsessed with his video analyses. They have become an important tool in assessing their team’s performance and peeping into the opposition’s style. This time, his analysis has brought deep insights into Nashville’s style of play.\n\n“That’s one of the things which moves ahead to Nashville with Mukhtar, Surridge, really dangerous players in and around there, on the transitions. So, really good breakaway players and they’ve been getting better with every game. I’ve been following their team for a while now and their new acquisitions have hit the ground running and they’re a real threat to be reckoned with.”\n\nAgain, he highlighted Nashville’s transitional threat as his biggest challenge and singled out Mukhtar as the centerpiece of their system, possessing a unique ability to dribble, shoot and make the final pass. He also acknowledged their lethality in set pieces.\n\n“There’s a growing hunger, growing hunger, growing ambition. This group’s got a level head about them, very business-minded attitude. It’s very positive around the camp and the boys are full of energy and full of fun right now. Now, the challenge for us is to keep on challenging each other every single day, to clean the slate every Monday and rinse and repeat.”\n\nImage Credit: Philadelphia Union\n\nOrganization and implementation have this Union side flying high\n\nManagement is also involved in the team’s success. To Canrell and the rest of the team, they’ve provided a solid foundation for the team’s successful transformation this season.\n\n“Regardless of the three points, I think that there’s a general consensus around the camp, around the organisation, that we’re moving in the right direction and three games is a small snapshot of what we can do.”\n\nThe Philadelphia Union team is currently free of new injuries. Markus Anderson and Ian Glavinovich, who have had spells on the sidelines this season, are well on their way back to recovery, as Bradley plans to manage their workload properly.\n\nCarnell admitted the challenges posed by Nashville SC and called the game a “chess match,” having noticed similar principles and setups between his team and the opposition. Regardless of how tough, the Union showed in their last game that they can always find the back of the net, even on not-so-good days.\n\nWell, it’s only their second home game, and if history is to repeat itself, like the first home game against Cincinnati, we expect nothing less than a three-goal lead on Sunday, seeing that the team has also won both away games by the same margin.\n\nImage Credit: Philadelphia Union\n\nBe sure to return to Philly Sports Network for more Philadelphia Union and other soccer content!\n\nFollow our Union team on Twitter:\n\nTim Lovenguth | Jimmy King | Paul Frenzel\n\nNate Tennesen | Eric Frysinger | Steve Beavon\n\nTomiwa Aderinoye | Christopher Babos | Liam Jenkins\n\nDoop on Union fans!\n\nFeatured Image Credit: Philadelphia Union",

In their Friday night matchup against the Indiana Pacers, the team had to sign veteran wing Oshae Brissett to a 10-day contract using a hardship exception simply to field eight players on the court.

As the Sixers continue to limp to the finish line this season, the team has brought him back amidst an increasing rash of injuries.\n\nAdem Bona is the latest Sixer to join the injury list, as he is now set to miss Sunday’s game due to an ankle sprain. Alongside Bona, Andre Drummond, Kelly Oubre, Tyrese Maxey, Paul George, Joel Embiid, Jared McCain, Eric Gordon, and Kyle Lowry are all OUT for the game.\n\nAn additional need for Chuma comes as word is soon expected to be announced of Paul George‘s season coming to an end. It has already been reported that George is consulting with doctors about the approach to his groin and lingering knee injuries, and a possible procedure is on the table as a solution. Prior to the Sixers’ game against Indiana, Head Coach Nick Nurse said that an update on George is expected to come early next week.\n\nSigning Okeke to this deal is likely related to Bona’s more than anything, but it will likely serve two purposes.\n\nOkeke, like Brissett, will provide Philadelphia with a body that can log minutes so that players like Guerschon Yabusele and others will not have to play extraordinary minutes down this season’s final stretch.",

So, this is my first time experiencing it. I’m going through the throes of it right now.”\n\nOne major help for him in his first season was Josh Sweat, whose guidance and influence will abide with him even after his departure to Arizona.\n\nWith Howie Roseman expecting a step up from Hunt and Moro Ojomo, Hunt hopes to keep finding inspiration from Sweat, watch his films to better his skills, follow his blueprints, and even compete against the veteran who led the Eagles with eight sacks in the regular season and racked up 2½ sacks at the Super Bowl.\n\n“That’s the OG, man,” Hunt said. “Josh Sweat, he’s out of here. I told him, ‘It’s up,’ though, because now we’re in direct competition. Because before, I’m learning from you, everything. But now I’ve got to outrush him and everything like that.”\n\nDec 22, 2024; Landover, Maryland, USA; Washington Commanders quarterback Jayden Daniels (5) runs the ball against Philadelphia Eagles linebacker Jalyx Hunt (58) during the second quarter at Northwest Stadium.

I feel as if I can ask better questions now that I know a little bit more about the position and I’ve played and I’ve got some experience at it. Just ask my butt off. Work my butt off.”\n\nIt will be a great sight to see and an exemplary move for the remaining teams in the NFL if the Eagles’ idea of trusting their youngsters yields results and leads them to another Super Bowl glory.\n\nREUTERS/Brian Snyder TPX IMAGES OF THE DAY",

        "source": "https://metrophiladelphia.com/",
        "content": "Sign up for our Gay City News email newsletter to get news, updates, and local insights delivered straight to your inbox!\n\n“Pet Shop Days,” the debut feature by director/co-writer Olmo Schnabel (son of painter/filmmaker Julian), is a wonderfully lurid little film. This intense drama immerses viewers in the offbeat romance that develops between Alejandro (Dario Yazbek Bernal) and Jack (co-writer Jack Irv), who meet in New York City, hang out, hook up, and eventually commit crimes together.\n\nThe vibe throughout is seedy as scenes unfold in dark drug dens and dimly lit strip clubs. But Schnabel also films scenes in tony apartment buildings, where some really fine art graces the walls. The filmmaker is more interested in atmosphere than plot, as his edgy filmmaking style attests. In the opening sequence, set in Mexico, he uses whip pans and Dutch angles to pull focus. Once the story shifts to New York, the film has a very urgent on-the-ground approach following the reckless Alejandro as he gets involved with the naive Jack. In addition, the editing is experimental, with some flashbacks intercut with action to fill in narrative details or provide some time jumps.\n\nThe guys first connect in earnest when Ale arrives shirtless but wearing a suit he was being fitted for (and stole) at the pet shop where Jack works. Jack’s curiosity is piqued when the attractive Ale suggests they might have fun together. When they head out to a drug den, Ale and Jack start having sex with a pair of women before kissing and coupling up with each other. Ale dismisses their night of passion, saying, “It’s OK. We had fun.” But Jack has a more complex response to the magnetic stranger who shakes up his life. (Both guys can be read as bisexual.)\n\nSchnabel and Irv might have told the story from Jack’s point of view, but it is better that Ale is the focus because he is such a loose cannon. Watching Bernal strut his way through “Pet Shop Days” without much concern for others is compelling. The actor serves up insouciance with sex appeal in every scene, and his cocky performance is riveting even though his character is often unlikable. Ale shamelessly tries to seduce a room service waiter who chastens him about keeping a credit card on file, and in one of the film’s most discussion-worthy sequences, Ale ends a planned threesome with Jack and Riley (Abella Danger) a sex worker, because she creates an unacceptable mess in the bathroom.\n\nIt is deliberately unclear if Ale has feelings for Jack or is just using him, and viewers can decide if their romance is real. Jack does confess to Ale — while naked in a sauna no less — “Ever since we met, I feel different about everything in my life.” To which Ale responds, “I’m not good for you.” Amusingly, just a few scenes earlier, Jack has come out to his family at a dinner by announcing he and Ale have had their cocks in each other’s mouths.\n\n“Pet Shop Days” revels in such “provocative” moments, but Jack is rebelling against his wealthy father, Francis (Willem Dafoe) — just as Ale is defying his rich dad, Castro (Jordi Mollà). One subplot has Castro sending Walker (Louis Cancelmi) to New York to bring Ale back home. Another subplot has Jack catching Francis cheating on his mother, Diana (Emmanuelle Seigner), with Andy (Camille Rowe), his sister Lucy’s (Grace Brennan) tutor.\n\nThese father/son subplots influence Ale and Jack, but in their efforts to strike out on their own, Ale devises a scheme to rob rich women who frequent the pet store. Ale poses as a delivery man while Jack, in drag, helps him steal cash and jewelry. A later scene has Ale in Jack’s home, putting on Diana’s clothes which leads to Jack being forbidden to see Ale. (The film revels in sexual fluidity.)\n\nSchnabel and Irv overstuff their film with ideas and characters, but they do not create much in the way of dramatic tension. There are a few suspenseful moments — one dangerous robbery, a car chase — but the lack of an overarching point to all that transpires can be frustrating. The film characters all behave selfishly, which does not give viewers much enough reason to invest in them or Jack and Ale’s relationship.\n\nWhile Bernal is fun to watch because Ale speaks and acts impetuously, Irv gives a more nuanced performance because Jack’s character develops over the course of the film. Jack just wants to be loved; his puppy-dog loyalty toward Ale — and bad decision making — turns into concern, but his relationship empowers Jack to take charge of his life. Irv plays his character’s naïveté well.\n\nThe gritty romance “Pet Shop Days” is uneven, and not for everyone, but the visuals and performances never make it uninteresting.\n\n“Pet Shop Days” | Directed by Olmo Schnabel | Opening March 15 at the Roxy Cinema | Distributed by Utopia",

        "source": "https://metrophiladelphia.com/",
        "content": "Sign up for our email newsletter to stay up-to-date on the latest local sports news throughout Philadelphia.\n\nThe Philadelphia Phillies brought back the majority of their roster from last season. By doing so, the Phillies did not have many storylines or position battles coming into their camp this spring. After two and a half weeks’ worth of Spring Training games under their belt and a few bumps and bruises, they find themselves with a few more decisions to make.\n\nUntil Weston Wilson suffered an injury on a swing back on February 24, he was most likely going to fill one of the final bench spots. Now, he is out six weeks and will certainly start the season on the 10-day injured list. Matt Strahm’s status is also uncertain after what was described as a “shoulder impingement” in his throwing arm. He underwent an MRI and, per MLB.com‘s Todd Zolecki, it revealed no structural damage. Still, another guaranteed spot opens itself.\n\nWhen figuring out how to fill the last few spots, there is plenty to consider. Performance, positional versatility, and keeping their depth available to them are all key factors. With those things in mind, let’s predict who will be 26 men to fill out the Opening Day roster.\n\nOffense\n\nThere are a few things guaranteed about the roster before we even get into the players themselves. 13 hitters – 9 starters, a backup catcher, and three others – and 13 pitchers, five of whom will be starters and the rest will be bullpen. The starting 9, barring further injuries is already known.\n\nOnly one new face in the bunch. The most these men have to worry about is where they are going to hit in the order. For the rest, let’s start with the backup catcher. Backing up Realmuto is not like backing up most catchers in the league. He plays so much, and when healthy he’s one of the best hitters at the position in the game.\n\nWith minimal playing time available, you have to show you can perform in short stints. The two options – Rafael Marchán and Garrett Stubbs – both have good arguments to be the man backing JT on opening day. Stubbs’ numbers stand out a bit more, hitting 385 (5-for-13) with two doubles, three RBIs, three walks, two strikeouts and a 1.067 OPS.\n\nFeb 19, 2025; Clearwater, FL, USA; Philadelphia Phillies catcher Garrett Stubbs (21) (left) shortstop Trea Turner (7) (left center) first base Bryce Harper (3) (left center) second base Bryson Stott (5) (right center) and designated hitter Kyle Schwarber (12) (right) participate in spring training workouts at BayCare Ballpark. Mandatory Credit: Nathan Ray Seebeck-Imagn Images\n\nHe’s also got an extended report with the pitching staff, as he’s held the backup job since 2022 and is famously the clubhouse DJ. However, he also has a minor league option – something Marchán doesn’t have. The former top prospect is hitting just .235 (4-for-17) with one extra-base hit entering Thursday. In a short stint on the major league roster last season, however, he impressed with the stick. Surprisingly, in a few limited runs at the top level, Marchán has slugged much better than he did in the minor leagues.\n\nPrediction: While Stubbs’ hot spring deserves attention, I think the Phillies will take advantage of the flexibility they have and start the season with Rafael Marchán in the majors. With not much high-level depth behind these two, they won’t want to take the risk that they lose him to waivers – a risk that doesn’t exist with the Chief Vibes Officer.\n\nNow the bench battle begins. Edmundo Sosa is a super utility guy who plays great defense across the infield, has started to play both center and left fields, and has performed well when called upon to start in the majors. With all this and the fact that he has no options remaining, he is a lock for Opening Day. With the two men just mentioned, that leaves just two bench spots.\n\nOnce assumed to be Wilson and Johan Rojas, it now needs a bit more thinking. Not only is Wilson not starting the season, but Rojas has been dealing with an injury of his own. The center fielder suffered a shoulder injury sliding into second base while playing in the Dominican Winter League playoffs.\n\n“We’re just being precautionary, really,” manager Rob Thomson told reporters in Port Charlotte on Tuesday, Feb. 25. “It’s probably going to be another close to a week before he throws, but it’ll be a quick ramp-up I would think. And he’s getting plenty of at-bats.”\n\nThose ABs have come exclusively at DH and he’s swung a hot bat, posting a .292 batting average with a .583 slugging percentage through nine games, but his value comes mostly from his glove work in center. Rojas is also a player with options remaining, meaning the Phillies can take their time while getting him more ABs in Triple-A to ensure he’s truly ready for the season instead of potentially rushing him. My guess? That’s exactly what the team does – take advantage of the versatility and get Rojas extra at-bats while you’re at it.\n\nThat leaves a few more options for the last few spots. Óscar Mercado, signed to a minor league deal, would be an option but he hasn’t lit the box score up in spring. He will probably require some time in the minors as well. Christian Arroyo, also on a minor league deal, has been impressive in spring at the plate while playing all over the infield and some outfield to boot. Despite that, his minor league contract status allows the Phillies to keep some depth without needing to change the 40-man roster and risk losing someone else.\n\nMy final Phillies bench predictions are two more utility guys that fans are familiar with – Buddy Kennedy and Kody Clemens. Both hitters can play corner outfield, if needed, but have much more experience in the infield. After getting time with the big league club last season, they both also are out of options so it goes back to the team’s desire to keep depth to help them survive the slog of the MLB season.\n\nKennedy has even gotten outfield workouts in with his neighbor, Mike Trout, in the off-season to prepare him for this possibility. Clemens has had clutch moments to help the team the last few seasons and they consider him a big-league talent – meaning they likely fear losing him on waivers.\n\nFeb 12, 2025; Clearwater, FL, USA; Philadelphia Phillies pitcher Aaron Nola (27) warms up during a spring training workout at Carpenter Complex. Mandatory Credit: Jonathan Dyer-Imagn Images\n\nPitching Staff\n\nThere are a few more guarantees in the pitching department. Everyone knows the six starting pitchers are likely to make the team, especially the way that Taijuan Walker has pitched in Spring Training:\n\nWhile Walker might end up in a long-man role, that wasn’t obvious coming into camp. With the signing of Joe Ross and the trade for Luzardo, there was a chance Walker might have been the odd man out. Now, after the injury to Strahm, some shifting is required.\n\nFor the bullpen, there are a few guarantees – whether they be from signings or past performance. Checking in on who should make it, barring any injury (minus Walker, as he is listed above):\n\nThat means there would be two left-handers vs. three right-handers. With two spots to fill and Strahm not facing a lengthy absence as of yet, I feel you can fill them with either hand and just choose top performers. José Ruiz probably has the leg up for one of those spots after posting a 1.99 ERA in 22.2 innings after the All-Star break. That leaves just one opening.\n\nFor the final spot, I am going to go with Kyle Tyler. A righty who was claimed off waivers from the Miami Marlins last season, he has thrown 6.2 innings across four games this spring to the tune of a 0.00 ERA. He has a few walks (4) and now a ton of strikeouts (4), but they seem to have enough faith in him to continue to give him looks out of the pen.\n\nPhillies Opening Day Roster\n\nHere are the official roundup predictions:\n\nOffense: Catchers – J.T Realmuto, Rafael Marchán; First base – Bryce Harper; Second base – Bryson Stott; Third base – Alec Bohm; Shortstop – Trea Turner; Outfielders – Nick Castellanos, Brandon Marsh, Max Kepler; Utility/Bench – Buddy Kennedy, Kody Clemens, Edmundo Sosa\n\nPitching: Starters – Zack Wheeler, Aaron Nola, Cristopher Sánchez, Ranger Suárez, Jesús Luzardo; Bullpen – Taijuan Walker, Kyle Tyler, José Ruiz, Tanner Banks, Joe Ross, Orion Kerkering, José Alvarado, Jordan Romano\n\nMandatory Credit: Nathan Ray Seebeck-Imagn Images",

Mandatory Credit: Ken Blaze-Imagn Images\n\nSign up for our email newsletter to stay up-to-date on the latest local sports news throughout Philadelphia.\n\nThe secret chess club at One NovaCare Way keeps getting bigger. The latest member arrives in Philadelphia following two years spent as mainly a pawn in Cleveland.\n\nDorian Thompson-Robinson was chosen by the Browns in the fifth round of the 2023 NFL Draft. The 25-year-old quarterback mostly backed up Deshaun Watson, starting five games over two seasons while struggling with his completion percentage.\n\nNow, after a surprise trade jettisoned Kenny Pickett to Cleveland, DTR will enter training camp as the Eagles’ third-stringer. Sitting behind Jalen Hurts and Tanner McKee on the early depth chart, under the tutelage of brand new quarterbacks coach Scot Loeffler, DTR is ready to make his mark.\n\n“Diving in with these new teammates. Diving in with this new playbook,” DTR said. “And, really, being a sponge to Jalen as well as Coach Loeffler in the quarterback room to make sure there is no stone unturned.”\n\nAnd not just on the football field. DTR is an accomplished chess player who started playing the game at UCLA, on the advice of former Eagles honcho Chip Kelly. He considers Los Angeles-based performance coach Seth Makowsky a mentor of sorts, something that he shares in common with Hurts.\n\nMakowsky is a chess guru with a cult following among NFL quarterbacks. He and his wife, Rebecca, run a company called Poison Pawn which he describes as a “mind-set training system that uses chess to achieve peak performance in every aspect of life,” according to the Los Angeles Times. Hurts is one of his clients.\n\n“I’ve crossed paths with Jalen a few times,” DTR said. “He’s worked with a chess mentor of mine, Seth Makowsky … so, we have a little bit of familiarity there. I’ll have to ask him about chess when I get into the room, and if he wants to play a few games or two.”\n\nNo, you didn’t misread it. DTR sent a direct challenge to Hurts or anyone else who wants to play chess in the locker room. It should be noted that Saquon Barkley is another member of the secret chess club at the NovaCare Complex.\n\nThompson-Robinson ended his introductory press conference by telling Eagles fans to look him up on chess.com and challenge him. He likened the game of chess to football, in that you are constantly making decisions and each one affects the outcome.\n\n“So much about this position [quarterback] is about decision-making, I think that’s really all chess is, it’s just a board to make decisions on, ” DTR said. “And every decision means something and you have to be consistent in that, and so I think that’s really how it helps playing quarterback.\n\n“And, really, all positions. It’s just being able to take that same mentality and mindset into the game and know that you got to be locked in for a full four quarters.”\n\nDorian Thompson-Robinson, talking about his relationship with Chip Kelly: “Chip’s one of my all-time favorite coaches … the first guy to really take a chance on me and help me build throughout my college career to get to this point in the pros, so I have nothing but good things to say about Coach Kelly.”\n\nDorian Thompson-Robinson, talking about his Top-30 visit to Philly in 2023: “This was one of my favorite teams coming out of the draft process. I loved everything about my visit here, just the way it was ran. They put me through a press conference-type situation when I was on the visit. It got me prepared for whatever team I was going to be on so I appreciated that. I’m just happy to be in this situation for sure.”\n\nKenyon Green Embracing ‘Change of Scenery’ with Eagles\n\nFeb 9, 2025; New Orleans, LA, USA; A detail view of a Philadelphia Eagles after they won Super Bowl LIX against the Kansas City Chiefs at Caesars Superdome. Mandatory Credit: Geoff Burke-Imagn Images\n\nThe Eagles shipped off C.J. Gardner-Johnson off to the Houston Texans in a trade no one saw coming. Unexpected would be the understatement of the year, wrapped up in the 6-foot-4, 324-pound offensive guard.\n\nKenyon Green was the prized jewel in the deal. The 15th overall pick from the 2022 draft will get a chance to resurrect himself, maybe even win a starting job depending on what happens to right guard Mekhi Becton. Green needed a change of scenery, badly.\n\n“Definitely. I feel like this breath of fresh air, new surroundings, new people to meet, different atmosphere,” Green said at his introductory press conference. “I’m extremely grateful for what the Texans done for me and everything. Unfortunately, it didn’t go the way that I wanted it to but I’m excited and I’m happy that I’m here with the Eagles.”\n\nGreen visited Philadelphia on a Top-30 visit prior to the 2022 draft and walked out with a great feeling about the organization, specifically that Super Bowl-winning culture. He called to mind the conversation he had with Coach Jeff Stoutland, inarguably the best offensive line coach in football.\n\n“Man, just great conversation, great man,” Green said of Stoutland. “I know that he loves his players. He loves to coach, and I’m going to give him everything I have.”\n\nWhen asked to describe the way he plays the game, Green didn’t hold back.\n\n“I’m a physical guy,” Green said. “I like trying to be a mauler, just moving people, and wherever I need to play, I’m going to do whatever I need to do to make sure that the Eagles are winning games.”\n\nKenyon Green, talking about the Eagles’ culture: “Just the culture, from the owner to the GM to the head coach, everybody is just unbelievable. I’m just excited in seeing that they are excited that I’m here, and it’s time to work. I really don’t have a lot to say, I’m blessed, I’m a grateful young man that I’m here right now and I have this opportunity.”\n\nMandatory Credit: Ken Blaze-Imagn Images",

Gaining possession at midfield, the Orlando striker managed to streak down the left wing, meander toward the center of the pitch with little resistance, and bean a right-footed effort into the top-right corner of the goal.\n\nThe Red Bulls found an equalizer via the penalty spot after Choupo-Moting was taken down in the box by Orlando defender Robin Jansson in the 25th, which was initially not called by referee Armando Villarreal.\n\nOne minute later — just seconds after New York midfielder Peter Stroud was taken down in the box for another penalty shout — play was stopped for a video-assisted review (VAR), which deemed Jansson’s takedown of Choupo-Moting was a penalty.\n\nThe Red Bulls’ big offseason signing slotted his chance from the spot in the bottom-left corner of the goal in the 29th minute, his first goal with the club and his first since Nov. 11, 2023 when he helped lead German giants Bayern Munich to a 4-2 victory over Heidenheim.\n\n“Choupo was great today,” Schwarz said. “How he worked for the team in holding the ball and keeping the ball in a lot of moments, it was a top performance.”\n\nJust 10 minutes later, though, the Red Bulls’ defense were caught snoozing again, specifically left-back Raheem Edwards, who kept Pasalic onside for a ball over the top that sent him in alone on Coronel, leading to the go-ahead goal just before the half.\n\n“We stayed too deep in this moment with our left-wing back,” Schwarz said. “We also had some moments in the first half with their attack, where they attacked on our left side… We had some moments where we were too deep in some situations.. It’s difficulty to make high pressure on the ball against an opponent.”\n\nGjengaar tied it up in the 47th minute when he kneed a left-wing Peter Stroud cross from point-blank range past the diving Orlando keeper, Pedro Gallese.\n\n“It was somewhere in between [my knee and thigh],” Gjengaar said of his goal. “You’re just trying to get something, some contact on the ball, and steer it in the right direction. And it worked.”\n\nEdwards had a pair of golden opportunities to put the Red Bulls in front in the 52nd minute when a Ivan Angulo was scuffed right into his path at the left post. His first touch sent the ball wide of the left post. A minute later, he could not wrangle in a rebound off a save by Gallese right in front of goal.\n\nGjengaar should have had a second, too, when he pounced on a turnover at midfield and had no one but Gallese in front of him in the 62nd minute. At first, it appeared as though he pulled his shot well wide of the left post, but Gallese got the slightest of touches of to keep the score level.\n\nHe came within inches of giving the Red Bulls the win in the 85th minute when his left-footed shot from the right of the box curled its way off the left post.\n\n“A lot of curse words [were going through my mind when I missed],” Gjengaar admitted.”\n\nCoronel saved the Red Bulls from defeat in the third minute of second-half stoppage time when he pushed away a Ramiro Enrique shot after the Orlando attacker was able to walk in alone from the right side of the box.\n\nOne minute later, he made a sprawling kick save to stop Rafael Santos. The rebound followed up on by Duncan McGuire was blocked.\n\n“This is what I didn’t like today,” Schwarz said. “You have to be lucky for this point because Carlos saved us. I don’t like to have this feeling.”\n\nFor more on the Red Bulls, visit AMNY.com",

Mekhi was easy to root for because of his passion.\n\nBecton was the only offensive starter not signed for the 2025 season, and it is no surprise the team wanted the offensive continuity. Those who saw and listened to Becton’s passion for the city hoped he would stay in Philadelphia, but reportedly, late Friday night, Mekhi Becton signed with the Los Angeles Chargers on a two-year deal.\n\nThe Chargers, under Head Coach Jim Harbaugh, love to run the ball. They are getting a former first-round pick with intimidating size and every trait one would want from an offensive lineman. He had his best season in the NFL, learning from Jeff Stoutland and playing with Lane Johnson and Jordan Mailata. He will now be alongside Joe Alt in Los Angeles, and he will bring everything he has learned with him.\n\nPHILADELPHIA, PA – DECEMBER 21: Philadelphia Eagles offensive line coach Jeff Stoutland prior to the National Football League game between the Washington Football Team and Philadelphia Eagles on Tuesday, December 21, 2021 at Lincoln Financial Field in Philadelphia, PA (Photo by John Jones/Icon Sportswire)\n\nThe Eagles will seemingly move on to Tyler Steen who played well in Becton’s absence in 2025. Philadelphia also acquired Kenyon Green and could draft someone to create competition for the RG position. But there’s one special reflection that may have gotten loss in the midst of this reported deal. While Mekhi Becton is a first-round talent that deserves the big pay day and praise, it’s an even bigger testament to what the Eagles have within the walls of the Novacare Complex.\n\nBecton struggled mightily during his time with the Jets and was seen as a reclamation project when the Eagles signed him to a one-year prove it deal. He went from struggling as a tackle to becoming one of the larger guards in the league and even one of the better players at his new position. The Eagles have always fancied themselves of being a factory of some sorts for different positions but the statement stands true for the offensive line. Jeff Stoutland’s ability to develop players and get the best out of them is second to none.\n\nFeb 9, 2025; New Orleans, LA, USA; Philadelphia Eagles offensive tackle Mekhi Becton (77) celebrates after winning Super Bowl LIX at Caesars Superdome. Mandatory Credit: Geoff Burke-Imagn Images\n\nThe proof is in the pudding for Stoutland and the Eagles. They once drafted a former rugby player who never played a down of American football and turned him into one of the better left tackles in the league. A franchise altering player that made it easy for the Eagles to move on from the legendary Jason Peters and former first-round pick, Andre Dillard.\n\nWhile losing Becton will sting for the moment, the Eagles are already at the drawing board and have ther eyes set on who their next guy in line is. I’m sure they will find success in him as well, whether it is Tyler Steen or Kenyon Green.\n\nAs always, thank you for reading!\n\nFollow me on X @PHLEagleNews\n\nMandatory Credit: Geoff Burke-Imagn Images",

(Photo by Andy Lewis/Icon Sportswire)\n\nSign up for our email newsletter to stay up-to-date on the latest local sports news throughout Philadelphia.\n\nAccording to an official announcement from the NFL, the Philadelphia Eagles are bolstering their secondary with the addition of Adoree Jackson. The move comes after a difficult few days that saw both Isaiah Rodgers and Darius Slay leave in free agency.\n\nEagles sign Adoree Jackson\n\nJackson will come into Philadelphia as a 29 year old cornerback who can mentor the younger guys. As a former first-round selection himself, he knows what it takes to sustain a career in this league and maintain a reputation as a starting cornerback.\n\nThe USC product started out his career with the Tennessee Titans before taking his talents to New York, where he would face off against the Eagles twice a season in the NFC East for the next four years.\n\nWhile he only started in 5 games last season, Jackson allowed 18 receptions on 33 targets for 206 yards and 2 touchdowns. Although it was a smaller sample size than years past, it was actually a career-low for the 5’11 DB in terms of opposing completion percentage when targeted (48%).\n\nFollowing in the footsteps of Saquon Barkley, who left the Giants to join their divisional rival last offseason, Jackson joins a team who have often been linked to his services. While it’s unclear whether or not he will be starting in 2025, the move at least provides some proven depth along with competition for Kelee Ringo when it comes to that #2 spot opposite rookie sensation, Quinyon Mitchell.\n\nPhoto by Andy Lewis/Icon Sportswire",

He was named a consensus All-American in 2020 with the Broncos. He started his pro career as the Falcons’ primary kickoff and punt returner in 2021 and played the vital role of gunner as well on special teams.\n\nIn the summer of 2023, Williams tore his ACL during OTAs and missed the entire season. This past season, Williams appeared in 17 games averaging 9.3 yards per punt return and 27.2 yards per kickoff return.\n\nAug 9, 2024; Baltimore, Maryland, USA; Philadelphia Eagles wide receiver Britain Covey (18) catches a quarterback Kenny Pickett (7) pass in front of Baltimore Ravens linebacker Joe Evans (48) during the second quarter of a preseason game at M&T Bank Stadium. Mandatory Credit: Tommy Gilligan-USA TODAY Sports\n\nWith the signing, it could indicate that Britain Covey’s tenure with the Eagles will come to an end. Covey signed as an undrafted free agent in 2022 and has played in 38 games with the team primarily as the team’s return specialist where he was one of the best returners in the NFL in 2023 when he led the league with 417 punt return yards, good for a 14.4-yard average per punt return.\n\nHe also averaged an impressive 30 yards per kick return that same season. The former Utah product was unfortunately injured in 2024 and saw Cooper DeJean take over the punt return role. A role that not many people were comfortable with DeJean taking due to the risk of injury. Eagles now take a chance on a new option for their special teams unit.\n\nWilliams is the sixth player GM Howie Roseman has signed so far since the start of free agency. The Eagles are quietly adding players with unique upsides to cheap deals as they prepare for some big extensions within the next two years.\n\nMandatory Credit: Geoff Burke-Imagn Images",

The contract breakdown is as follows: $467,500 guaranteed, $167,500 signing bonus, salary $1.255 million ($300,000 fully guaranteed) per Aaron Wilson.\n\nHughlett, 34 years old, has played for Cleveland since 2014 and was one of their longer-tenured players having played in 152 games. He was limited to 5 games last season due to a rib injury. The Eagles hope he will perform as well as he has over the previous decade.\n\nReliable Rick Lovato did not get extended, which was initially surprising, but as this lingered, it started to appear that he and the Eagles would be parting ways. Charley will have big shoes to fill. Lovato is a player who has never had his name called for any reason, and as a long snapper, that is a great thing. The Eagles have enjoyed over a decade of excellence from the position transitioning from Jon Dornebos to Rick.

        "content": "Sign up for our Daily Email newsletter to stay up-to-date on the latest local news throughout Philadelphia.\n\nMayor Cherelle Parker, in her second budget address, proposed borrowing $800 million for affordable housing programs and cutting the city’s business and wage taxes.\n\nThe $6.7 billion spending plan, unveiled Thursday, also invests in expanding many of Parker’s first-year priorities, including year-round, extended-day schooling, creating a municipal “wellness” ecosystem for homeless drug users and neighborhood cleaning.\n\nAffordable housing\n\nParker has pledged to create or preserve 30,000 units of affordable housing. To reach that goal, she is asking lawmakers to approve an $800 million loan, with half of the money to be bonded in the next fiscal year, beginning July 1.\n\nFew specifics have been released about the administration’s broader housing plan, but the mayor said details will be presented at a March 24 special City Council session.\n\n“This cannot wait. If you know anything about me, you know I understand the urgency in our communities,” she said. “We’re here to take action. Philadelphians need more housing, and they need it now. More housing now.”\n\nIn February, Parker signed an executive order creating the Housing Opportunities Made Easy, or H.O.M.E., initiative. As part of the strategy, stakeholders were given a month to produce recommendations to remove barriers and spur the construction of new homes.\n\nThe mayor’s proposed budget scraps a 1% construction impact tax, which city officials said generated about $3.5 million a year. Parker said the levy discourages builders.\n\nTax cuts\n\nThe administration is advocating for cuts to wage tax and both portions of the Business Income and Receipts Tax (BIRT). If passed, the measure would be the first to cut all three rates in 17 years, according to the Mayor’s Office.\n\nEchoing the city’s business community, Parker said Thursday that Philadelphia has “a tax structure that’s hindered growth and stunted the job creation that we so desperately need.”\n\nUnlike many jurisdictions, the city separately taxes a business’s overall revenue and profits, and more revenue is generated from the wage tax than any other levy.\n\nIn addition to year-by-year reductions, Parker wants to codify a plan to eliminate BIRT’s gross receipts portion and half the tax’s net income rate by the 2039 fiscal year. That’s seven years after Philadelphia’s long-troubled pension fund is expected to be fully funded, freeing up more than $430 million a year, according to administration officials.\n\nThe Tax Reform Commission, a body convened by Council President Kenyatta Johnson, recommended getting rid of both portions of BIRT over the next eight to 12 years in a report published last month.\n\n“Even before I could get in the building today, I started getting some messages from people saying, ‘This is not enough,’” Parker said. “This is what we can afford to do, and I shall not be moved on this delicate balance of enacting business tax reform while protecting (our) fiscal stability as a city.”\n\nJohnson, following Parker’s address, called the proposed reductions a “step in the right direction.” “You call it tax cuts; I call it tax investments,” he told reporters.\n\nThe Parker administration is reluctantly offering a repeal of a BIRT exemption that does not tax an enterprise’s first $100,000 in revenue, due to legal challenges alleging it violates the state’s uniformity clause, the Mayor’s Office said.\n\nA $30 million fund to help small businesses cope with the change is included in the budget. Some may be filing a BIRT return for the first time.\n\nResidents would pay more under the mayor’s plan in a few areas.\n\nParker’s team is advocating for an increase to the real estate transfer tax to help pay for her housing initiatives, and the administration wants to raise the document recording fee by $3 to pay for efforts to resolve tangled titles.\n\nIn Center City and the surrounding neighborhoods, drivers would pay $4 an hour to park, up from $3. Most of the additional revenue would flow to the School District of Philadelphia, which stands to gain an extra $4 million a year, officials said.\n\nTrump effect\n\nLooming over the City Hall budget talks this year is the potential for the Trump administration to severely curtail federal spending.\n\nRob Dubow, the city’s finance director, said Washington, D.C., has already canceled a couple of grants “in the sustainability area.” In the 2024 fiscal year, Philadelphia received $2.8 billion in federal grants.\n\n“Given the large amount of grants that we get, any reduction could have a really big impact on our budget,” Dubow said at a budget briefing.\n\nPhiladelphia’s economy – and the city’s tax revenues – relies on large educational and medical institutions, which could also be negatively impacted by slashes to federal funding.\n\nParker’s proposal sets aside $95 million to specifically account for fluctuations in federal spending.\n\n“I know there is uncertainty in the air right now,” she said in her address. “People don’t know what to expect from their government, and uncertainty can breed fear. I want the people of Philadelphia and our city employees to hear me, your city is here to keep you safe and to safeguard your basic rights.”\n\nCouncilmember Rue Landau, a Democrat often aligned with progressive lawmakers, praised several of the mayor’s priorities but questioned the tax proposals.\n\n“How is the city going to balance proposed revenue cuts at this time as we face down pending federal funding cuts that will lead to a loss of services?” she said Thursday in a statement.\n\nDubow told members of the media that the city anticipates losing out on a combined $17 million a year from the BIRT and wage tax cuts.\n\nWhat’s next\n\nCouncil will hold a series of hearings, expected to begin later this month, on aspects of Parker’s plan, analyzing specific allocations for major municipal departments.\n\nLawmakers are sure to advocate for some of their own priorities to be incorporated into the mayor’s proposal. Council and Parker must reach an agreement on a finalized budget before the end of June.",

This proved true for the Super Bowl LIX champion Philadelphia Eagles, who have lost edge rusher Josh Sweat, defensive tackle Milton Williams, and now, offensive lineman Mekhi Becton.\n\nAccording to ESPN reporter Tim McManus, Becton has agreed to a two-year deal with the Los Angeles Chargers after continued speculation of his return to Philadelphia, even after the team acquired Kenyon Green. Per McManus, Becton expects to play guard for the Chargers, just as he did for the Eagles.\n\nBecton signed with the Eagles shortly after the draft last offseason. For Becton, it was an opportunity to rehab his value and learn under the greatest offensive line coach the NFL offers. For the Eagles, it was a low-risk, high-reward play that paid off far better than anyone could have predicted.\n\nDec 1, 2024; Baltimore, Maryland, USA; Philadelphia Eagles running back Saquon Barkley (26) celebrates his fourth quarter touchdown with tackle Mekhi Becton (77) against the Baltimore Ravens at M&T Bank Stadium. Mandatory Credit: Mitch Stringer-Imagn Images\n\nThe former 11th overall pick would become the Eagles’ starting right guard, a major change from his days as a left tackle. Despite this change, Becton proved ready for the challenge, thriving in his new role, starting in 19 games for the Eagles between the regular and postseason.\n\nWithout Becton, the Eagles will likely turn toward former third-round pick Tyler Steen, with Kenyon Green as a potential alternative. Steen has, at times, performed unevenly. He was a relatively poor grade by PFF, ranking 130th out of 135 guards in the NFL, but allowed zero sacks last season in 315 offensive snaps. Perhaps a sign of hope moving forward.\n\nAug 17, 2023; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA; Philadelphia Eagles guard Tyler Steen (56) looks on in a game against the Cleveland Browns at Lincoln Financial Field.

Scripture calls on us to care for one another, to protect the vulnerable, and to be watchful against those who would do harm. That is why I feel compelled to speak out when some seem to have forgotten the threat of illegal gaming operations that prey upon our neighbors, our families, and the most vulnerable among us.\n\nLike it or not, gaming has become part of modern life. Some engage in it responsibly, finding entertainment and enjoyment. But for too many, particularly those struggling financially or emotionally, illegal and unregulated gaming becomes a trap. These operations are not run by people who care about our well-being. They are designed to take advantage of people’s hopes, exploiting them with false promises and leaving them in financial and emotional ruin.\n\nI have seen firsthand the harm these illicit enterprises cause in our communities. Families torn apart by gambling debts. People are lured into dangerous situations by criminals who have no regard for their well-being. And the most vulnerable—our children—are exposed to illegal gaming websites with no safeguards, no accountability, and no concern for the damage they inflict.\n\nIn contrast, legal gaming operators are regulated by the state and required to put protections in place. Sports Betting Alliance companies —whose members BetMGM, DraftKings, Fanatics, and FanDuel operate most sports betting in New York — have invested millions into responsible gaming initiatives. These efforts include educating players, implementing safeguards like spending limits and reality checks, and ensuring that help is readily available for those in need. They have also trained over 200 staff members to build and operate programs that prioritize responsible play.\n\nKeeping in mind that mobile gaming is inevitable, the difference between legal, regulated operators and the shadowy world of illegal overseas websites is stark. One prioritizes consumer protections, ethical accountability, and contributes significant tax revenue for our communities. The other operates without oversight, thriving on deception and greed. As a faith leader, I cannot stay silent while these unlawful enterprises threaten our community’s well-being.\n\nThis leaves us with a clear choice: do we allow illegal, unregulated operators to prey on our communities, or do we support the system that prioritizes consumer protection and public benefit? Regulated gaming not only has safeguards to protect our children from participating, it also generates over $1 billion annually towards the schools that educate them. I don’t think the choice is difficult.\n\nAs people of faith, as members of this community, and as moral stewards of our society, we have an obligation to prevent illegal gaming operations from regaining a foothold in New York. By standing with legal, regulated gaming, we protect our neighbors, uphold ethical standards, and invest in a safer, more responsible future.\n\nJames Neville is the Pastor at Holy Temple of Prayer in Brooklyn.",

Mandatory Credit: Dale Zanine-Imagn Images\n\nSign up for our email newsletter to stay up-to-date on the latest local sports news throughout Philadelphia.\n\nThe Scotiabank Arena gave off nothing like the nostalgic feeling Nick Nurse—their former coach—would have expected as he and his Sixers team suffered a second loss on the spin. It was another woeful display that extended their pathetic record to 22-43 as the curtains of the regular season slowly got drawn.\n\nIn a game between two injury-plagued teams, the Toronto Raptors proved to be more resolute, seeing off the visiting Sixers with a 118-105 victory. It was the third time the two sides had locked horns this season, and Nick Nurse recorded all losses in his clash against his former side.\n\nThe Sixers’ injury excuses were rendered unsubstantial as they failed to turn up against a Raptors team that was without Scottie Barnes, Immanuel Quickley, RJ Barett, Brandon Ingram, and a few others.\n\nNurse’s men were largely unproductive, as they could only make 20 points of the 22 turnovers they forced – an unfortunate sequence Nurse felt was the major difference between the two sides.\n\n“That really is the difference, considering that we did turn them over quite a bit, and I didn’t think our transition offense out of turnovers was near good enough tonight either,” Nurse said.\n\n“Only 20 points out of 22 turnovers, right? So I’d say those two things offensively were the big problems.”\n\nLike that wasn’t enough, the Sixers were only able to manage seven triples out of 35 attempts, while their opponent knocked down 16 out of 40 tries.\n\n“Again, I thought after the first quarter, I thought we were doing a decent job of getting the ball out to open shooters, and we went a long time without hitting any, and then we kind of hit three in a row there, but three in a row and ended with seven for the game is, there’s a lot of dry spells in there from 3.”\n\nMar 12, 2025; Toronto, Ontario, CAN; Philadelphia 76ers guard Quentin Grimes (5) shoots the ball as Toronto Raptors guard Jared Rhoden (8) tries to defend during the second quarter at the Scotiabank Arena.

Of course, these were not to be overlooked by the frustrated Nick Nurse.\n\n“Just again, at the half, I showed some clips, and they were just mistakes by our guys going under the wrong guys for one thing,” Nurse complained.\n\n“Just not keeping track of the wrong guys there for another, a couple out of offensive rebounding situations, kind of getting a little bit of everything, and that’s how it adds up to be a bad number.”\n\nNurse couldn’t help but affirm the unpredictability of his future when asked about how he felt about his visits to the Scotiabank Arena as an opposition manager,\n\nPHILADELPHIA, PENNSYLVANIA – DECEMBER 20: Philadelphia 76ers head coach Nick Nurse looks on during a game against the Charlotte Hornets at the Wells Fargo Center on December 20, 2024 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. (Photo by Emilee Chinn/Getty Images)\n\n“I guess I’m getting used to it. I’m done [coming to Toronto] for this year. We’ll see what happens next year,” Nurse said in a question asked by Offside. “\n\nNurse’s statement was ambiguous and touched on many spectrums. His current contract runs until 2027-2028, but even the least concerned Sixers fan knows Nurse is vulnerable to job insecurity after this season.\n\nNonetheless, the game didn’t lack its positives. With the loss, the Sixers now move ahead of the Raptors in the lottery standings and own the tiebreaker in terms of the reverse standings in the race to the bottom. Also, Jeff Dowtin Jr. was a standout performer, as he hit a career-high 20 points against the Raptors.\n\nIt was a long-coming performance for the point guard who had shown glimpses of his scoring potential in the G League. For Nick and the Sixers, all eyes are on next season. But while Nurse’s future remains uncertain, the Sixers hope to rewrite the narrative from the lackluster season they’re having to a more encouraging one next term.",

From Jalen Carter and Jordan Davis to Nakobe Dean and Kelee Ringo, the Eagles seem to really love what the Bulldogs are creating all over the field.\n\nThe Eagles have left no room for honeymoon following their Super Bowl LIX victory, as they’ve maintained a level of activity that’s akin to a team desperate for silverware after a long drought. Having added to their coaching staff former Georgia assistant quarterbacks coach, Montgomery Van Gorder, the Birds are looking to diversify their offensive attack in preparation for the coming season.\n\nJan 12, 2025; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA; Green Bay Packers running back Josh Jacobs (8) rushes the ball against Philadelphia Eagles defensive tackle Milton Williams (93) and linebacker Nakobe Dean (17) during the first half in an NFC wild card game at Lincoln Financial Field. Mandatory Credit: Eric Hartline-Imagn Images\n\nWho is Montgomery VanGorder\n\nThe assistant quarterbacks coach who was once a QB himself, worked at Georgia since 2019 and quickly became one of Smart’s top offensive assistants. He was instrumental in developing standout quarterbacks, like Stetson Bennett, Carson Beck and Gunner Stockton.\n\nHaving handled several responsibilities at different times, VanGorder is said to have been a huge asset to Georgia, moving from quality control to assistant quarterback coach at some point. In fact, over the last few years, he has played a very decisive role in Georgia’s recruitment at the quarterback position.\n\nBefore venturing into coaching, VanGorder played four years of college football at Notre Dame before moving to Youngstown State. While he was with the Penguins in 2018, he put up 1,929 passing yards, 14 touchdowns and 10 interceptions.\n\nWith this move, VanGorder becomes the latest addition to the Eagles’ 2025 coaching staff. The group had already lost offensive coordinator, Kellen Moore, after he became the head coach of New Orleans Saints in February. Sirianni replaced Moore by promoting passing game coordinator, Kevin Patullo, and hired Bowling Green head coach, Scott Loeffler, as his quarterbacks coach.\n\nEagles outlook\n\nThe many incomings and outgoings among the offensive coaches shouldn’t create any setback, seeing the team has retained a good number of their offensive players. Whether premeditated or accidental, the offense has an overhauled coaching staff, while retaining a slew of the offensive players. On the flip side, the defense has lost most of its key players, while maintaining almost the same lineup of coaches\n\nClearly, a rebuild is happening on both ends of the Eagles’ roster. But while the offense radiates with brilliant veterans, like Jalen Hurt, Saquon Barkley and DeVonta Smith; the defense is left to struggle with lusterless young guns, like Joshua Uche, Jalyx Hunt and Sydney Brown, having suffered the loss of Josh Sweat, C.J Gardner-Johnson, Milton Williams and Darius Slay.\n\nIt poses the question of if the Eagles are really looking to reinforce their offense at the expense of the defense. Well, the only relief lies in the fact that we are still early into the free agency window and with the possibilities of more additions to the team, the defense could wear a new look before the season begins.\n\nMandatory Credit: Bill Streicher-Imagn Images",

Yet, despite the injuries and mounting losses, the team has been able to uncover some gems in their lineup that could provide some real assistance for the team over the next few years.\n\nAfter a trade deadline deal with the Mavericks, Quentin Grimes has established himself in Philly as a young guard that the team could pair with Tyrese Maxey in the seasons to come. With the injuries accumulating for the team, Grimes has shown that he can play and be a valuable piece of the team moving forward. Over his last ten games, Grimes has averaged 21.1 points per game, along with 4.6 rebounds and 3.7 assists, while he has gotten 1.8 steals. Grimes has been an absolute steal for the Sixers at the deadline and has played himself into a contract for the future.\n\nMar 12, 2025; Toronto, Ontario, CAN; Philadelphia 76ers guard Quentin Grimes (5) shoots the ball as Toronto Raptors guard Jared Rhoden (8) tries to defend during the second quarter at the Scotiabank Arena.

Edwards has shown that he can be effective on both sides of the ball, along with Bona, who’s provided some athleticism, defense, and scoring in limited minutes. The injuries to Embiid, Maxey, and Paul George have given the Sixers depth players a chance to show what they’re capable of doing and develop a more well-rounded roster as they head into the future.\n\nLatest on the Pacers\n\nDespite going 2-3 over their last five games and 5-5 over their last ten, the Pacers are just a half-game behind the Bucks as they head into Philadelphia. A win tonight would tie them with the Bucks for fourth place in the Eastern Conference as they head into a huge matchup on Saturday in Milwaukee.\n\nThe Pacers are coming off a win Tuesday night over the Bucks. Seven players scored in double figures, led by Pascal Siakam, who had 25 points and 12 rebounds. Myles Turner had 13 points and six rebounds, while Tyrese Haliburton finished the game with 14 points and 10 assists. The team was able to take down the Bucks despite shooting just 33% on their three-point attempts, largely thanks to their perimeter defense, which caused the Bucks to shoot even worse.\n\nMar 11, 2025; Indianapolis, Indiana, USA; Indiana Pacers teammates swarm and celebrate the game-tying basket made by guard Tyrese Haliburton (0) in the second half against the Milwaukee Bucks at Gainbridge Fieldhouse.

That’s the question that has to be on everyone’s mind except for Quentin Grimes, who continues to become more lethal with each passing game. Head coach Nick Nurse would be wise to limit Grimes’s minutes if the Sixers want to keep themselves closer to the bottom and secure their protected first-round pick in the upcoming draft.\n\nMar 10, 2025; Atlanta, Georgia, USA; Philadelphia 76ers head coach Nick Nurse shown on the sidelines against the Atlanta Hawks during the first half at State Farm Arena.

The Pacers remain relatively healthy and should have all of their weapons available to them. One thing that the Sixers have learned, especially over the past several games, is that the young guys on the team aren’t quitters. The talent and pride that they’ve displayed while fighting an uphill battle is commendable and should be recognized as a positive move forward.\n\nSeeing what players like Bona, Council IV, Butler, and Dowtin can do as they battle one of the better teams in the conference will be exciting and will help this team in the long run. The game will be a learning tool, and while it may get out of hand, the team can hold their heads up as the season winds to a close.\n\nPrediction\n\nPacers 117 – Sixers 95",

The defending MLS Cup Champions haven’t been able to produce last year’s form, losing three straight matches. They became the first defending champions to start the next season winless.\n\nOn Wednesday night in the Concacaf Champions Cup, the Galaxy defeated Herediano 4-1 and advanced to the quarterfinals. The Galaxy lost their first match against the Costa Rican side 1-0 but stormed back in the second leg.\n\nCan the Galaxy find their form in league play against the Portland Timbers on Sunday afternoon? Only two clubs remain undefeated after Matchday 3.

He appeared in 83% of their special teams snaps, a career-high in that area, having clearly found his niche with a new team.\n\nBut with the season now over, Johnson, per DiCecco, wanted to come back to Philadelphia.\n\nThis is a solid move for the Eagles, who could always benefit from special teams depth. Johnson flashed for the Eagles on multiple occasions and notably enjoyed a strong preseason. He developed well during his initial stint with Philly, but constant changes of the guard at defensive coordinator might have hindered his progress and placing on the depth chart.\n\nHe’ll rejoin his former team with a chance to fight for some more special teams snaps and potentially an expanded role on defense if he can show the versatility and explosiveness to rush the passer as he’s flashed on occasion throughout both his college and NFL career.\n\nPhoto by Stacy Revere/Getty Images",

        "source": "https://www.fox29.com/",
        "content": "The Brief A federal judge blocked Trump's use of an 18th-century law to deport Venezuelan migrants, citing lack of wartime authorization. The ruling halted deportations already underway, with planes ordered to turn around mid-flight. Trump's move to invoke the Alien Enemies Act faces legal challenges, as it has only been used during wartime.\n\n\n\nA federal judge on Saturday barred the administration of President Donald Trump from deportations under an 18th century law that Trump invoked just hours earlier asserting the United States was being invaded by a Venezuelan gang and that he had new powers to remove its members from the country.\n\nJames E. Boasberg, chief judge for the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, said he needed to issue his order immediately because the government was already flying migrants it claimed were newly deportable under Trump’s proclamation to El Salvador and Honduras to be incarcerated there. El Salvador already agreed this week to take up to 300 migrants that the Trump administration designated as gang members.\n\n\"I do not believe I can wait any longer and am required to act,\" Boasberg said during a Saturday evening hearing in a lawsuit brought by the ACLU and Democracy Forward. \"A brief delay in their removal does not cause the government any harm,\" he added, noting they remain in government custody but ordering that any planes in the air be turned around.\n\nTrump had invoked the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 Saturday to target members of a Venezuelan gang for mass deportations, just hours after a federal judge in Washington ruled that Trump couldn’t use the law as a means to deport five Venezuelans.\n\nTrump claims the U.S. is being invaded by a Venezuelan gang – Tren de Aragua (TdA) – and the sweeping war time law will give the president broader leeway to deport what he says is a hostile force acting at the behest of Venezuela’s government.\n\nWhat they're saying:\n\n\"I find and declare that TdA is perpetrating, attempting, and threatening an invasion or predatory incursion against the territory of the United States,\" Trump wrote in the declaration. \"TdA is undertaking hostile actions and conducting irregular warfare against the territory of the United States both directly and at the direction, clandestine or otherwise, of the Maduro regime in Venezuela.\"\n\nUS President Donald Trump speaks to the press before boarding Air Force One at Andrews Air Force Base March 14, 2025, in Maryland. Trump is spending the weekend at his Florida Mar-a-Lago resort, where he invoked the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 (Photo b Expand\n\nTrump’s invocation of the law could allow for faster mass deportations of people in the country illegally – potentially pushing his promised crackdown on immigration into higher gear.\n\nWhat is the Alien Enemies Act of 1798?\n\nThe backstory:\n\nThe Alien Enemies Act allows the president to detain, relocate or deport non-citizens from a country that is considered an enemy of the United States during wartime.\n\nCongress passed the Alien Enemies Act as part of the four Alien and Sedition Acts of 1798 when the U.S. was about to go to war with France.\n\nThe law requires a formal declaration of war before it can be used, but Trump appears to have invoked the law without such declaration. The sweeping authority of the Alien Enemies Act may sidestep a law that bans the military from civilian law enforcement.\n\nWhy did Trump invoke the Alien Enemies Act of 1798?\n\nDig deeper:\n\nOn Saturday, the American Civil Liberties Union and Democracy Forward filed an extraordinary lawsuit in federal court in Washington – before Trump invoked the law – contending the order would identify a Venezuelan gang, Tren de Aragua, as a \"predatory incursion\" by a foreign government and seek to deport any Venezuelan in the country as a member of that gang, regardless of the facts.\n\nJames E. Boasberg, chief judge of the D.C. Circuit, agreed to implement a temporary restraining order preventing the deportation for 14 days under the act of the five Venezuelans who are already in immigration custody and believed they were being moved to be deported. Boasberg said his order was \"to preserve the status quo.\" Boasberg scheduled a hearing for later in the afternoon to see if his order should be expanded to protect all Venezuelans in the United States.\n\nHours later, the Trump administration appealed the initial restraining order, contending that halting a presidential act before it has been announced would cripple the executive branch.\n\nTrump had widely signaled he would invoke the 1798 Act.\n\nThe unusual flurry of litigation highlights the controversy around the Alien Enemies Act, which could give Trump vast power to deport people in the country illegally. It could let him bypass some protections of normal criminal and immigration law. But it will likely face immediate challenges along the lines of Saturday's litigation because it has previously only been used during wartime.\n\nThe other side:\n\n\"Last night, it appears the government was preparing to deport a number of Venezuelans they had no legal authority to deport,\" said Ahilan Arulanantham, an immigration lawyer in Los Angeles who filed two petitions to block deportations that night.\n\nWhen was the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 last used?\n\nThe controversial law was last used to justify the internment of Japanese-American civilians during World War 2.",

        "source": "https://www.fox29.com/",
        "content": "As Tax Day nears, fiscally conservative leaders in several states are pushing to abolish property taxes, with one Pennsylvania lawmaker arguing that homeowners shouldn’t have to \"pay rent\" to the government.\n\nThat lawmaker, state Rep. Russ Diamond, R-Lebanon, spoke to Fox News Digital on Thursday ahead of his latest effort to end the collection of such taxes in the Keystone State.\n\nDiamond will put forward a resolution — titled HB 900 — which Fox News Digital learned exclusively will be filed imminently. The document is a draft constitutional amendment he hopes will go to the voters on Election Day, and not a typical piece of legislation requiring gubernatorial approval.\n\nPennsylvania Republicans previously utilized the constitutional amendment process to accelerate the rollback of COVID-19 lockdowns imposed by then-Gov. Tom Wolf and then-health secretary Rachel Levine — by placing the amendment directly before voters on Election Day.\n\nPA REPUBLICANS SEEK TO LEVY ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT REMITTANCES TO FUND PROPERTY TAX RELIEF\n\n\"Property taxes are an issue that is not exactly partisan, because in some areas, it’s more of a big deal than in others,\" Diamond said, citing varying relationships between taxes and school district funding.\n\nLebanon, he said, is kind of \"middle-of-the-road,\" but that just to the east in Allentown and Mount Pocono, property taxes are a \"big deal.\"\n\n\"For me, the ‘big deal’ is that I want people to own their homes and not have to rent from the government, all across Pennsylvania,\" he said.\n\nIn a recent post on his Substack , Diamond quipped that every time the topic comes up, \"folks get all twisted into knots over how we’re going to pay for the things those taxes currently pay for — frankly, they’re missing the point.\"\n\n\"Boiled down to its very essence, fulfilling the promise of personal liberty is impossible if you can’t actually own a piece of real property,\" he said.\n\nDiamond noted to Fox News Digital how late Pennsylvania Supreme Court Justice Michael Musmanno called the ability to be \"master of [one’s] fate\" the \"greatest joy that can be experienced by mortal man.... None shines with greater luster and imparts more innate satisfaction and soulful contentment to the wearer than the golden, diamond-studded right to be let alone.\"\n\n\"Everything else in comparison is dross and sawdust,\" Musmanno said in 1966, a quote which Diamond repeated to emphasize his point.\n\nState Sen. Doug Mastriano , a Gettysburg lawmaker who has also long championed an end to property taxes, called them \"rent to the government for the land you own.\"\n\n\"It’s easy to see why this antiquated tax is so despised in all corners of the commonwealth. More than 10,000 homes are seized annually in Pennsylvania and auctioned off for failure to pay the tax,\" he warned in a statement.\n\nDESANTIS CITES ‘GULF OF AMERICA’ IN WINTER STORM ORDER, IN FIRST MAJOR REFERENCE TO TRUMP PLAN\n\nMastriano floated taxing Western Union-type remittances to foreign countries as well as endowments to already-wealthy colleges in Pennsylvania to fill the gap.\n\nFILE: Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis. (Credit: Getty Images)\n\nOn the other end of I-95, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis posed a similar question in his State of the State last week:\n\n\"Is the property yours or are you just renting from the government?\"\n\n\"You buy a home, pay off a mortgage — and yet you still have to write a check to the government every year just to live on your own property?\" DeSantis said , noting Florida home values have surged and escalating assessments created a \"gusher of revenue\" for municipalities.\n\n\"Taxpayers need relief,\" he said, adding that pending legislation seeking \"protections\" for homeowners will have his support.\n\nAccording to the Floridian Press , state Sen. Jonathan Martin of Fort Myers is one lawmaker heeding that call.\n\nMartin’s new legislation calls for a property tax elimination framework to be subject to a study. The process would include examining the impacts on public services, changes in appeals to businesses to move to Florida and other requirements.\n\nOn the second day of the legislative session last week, state Rep. Ryan Chamberlin announced \"the beginning of the end of property taxes in the Free State of Florida.\"\n\nINDIANA'S DEI DEPT NIXED AS NEW GOVERNOR'S FIRST MAJOR ACT\n\nProblem Solvers Caucus co-chair Rep. Josh Gottheimer, D-N.J., calls on airlines to stop hiding fees and disclose the full price of tickets upfront on 'The Big Money Show.'\n\nChamberlin, R-Silver Springs, released a statement highlighting legislation to enact a $100,000 tax exemption on residential properties.\n\nSome lawmakers were not on board, as state Sen. Lori Berman, D-Boca Raton, told WPTV that the revenue would have to be replaced — and likely with other \"very regressive\" taxation.\n\nMeanwhile, in New Jersey — the state with the highest property taxes — Republicans have long pushed for relief and now have a key Democratic ally backing their efforts.\n\nRep.

Video shows Konanki walking with friends and Riibe before she disappeared; authorities suspect she may have drowned. The FBI is leading the investigation, with Riibe cooperating.\n\n\n\nThe Loudoun County Sheriff's Office has named a \"person of interest\" as the search continues for a college student missing in the Dominican Republic. This development comes amid a new video being shared in the investigation.\n\nJoshua Riibe named 'person of interest' in disappearance case\n\nWhat we know:\n\nVideo obtained by the Dominican Republic news outlet \"Noticias SIN\" shows 20-year-old Sudiksha Konanki walking with friends and a young man at the RIU Republica Resort around 4:30 a.m. last Thursday, March 6.\n\nAuthorities say Konanki, her friends, and the young man walked toward the beach. While her friends returned later, Konanki and the young man remained behind.\n\nKonanki is a University of Pittsburgh student and a permanent resident of Virginia. She and her family live in the Chantilly area.\n\nLoudoun County Sheriff Michael Chapman told FOX 5 that Konanki went to Punta Cana with five University of Pittsburgh friends on a Spring Break vacation.\n\nThe Dominican Republic Civil Defense authorities investigating Konanki's disappearance told FOX 5's David Kaplan they are operating under the assumption that Konanki may have drowned based on the information they received. However, Sheriff Chapman stresses that there is still no evidence of this.\n\nREAD MORE: Police in the Dominican Republic say FBI joins search for missing Pennsylvania student\n\nAuthorities suspect drowning, FBI leads investigation\n\nWhat's next:\n\nChapman identified the young man seen on video as a person of interest, naming him 24-year-old Joshua Riibe.\n\nIt is important to note that Riibe is not a suspect. There are no charges at this time, and this is still considered a missing persons investigation, not a criminal one.\n\nThere are reports that Riibe is cooperating with law enforcement, but there have also been several reports that he has given conflicting accounts of what happened.\n\nThe Loudoun County Sheriff's Office told FOX 5 that there are questions regarding when Konanki was first reported missing.\n\nA spokesperson for the LCSO says they are in direct contact with the FBI on this case. The FBI is leading the investigation for the United States in this international matter.\n\nThe sheriff's office also confirmed to FOX 5 that it is their understanding that Konanki and the 24-year-old did not know each other prior to Konanki's visit to the Dominican Republic.\n\nImage 1 of 4 ▼ Video obtained by the Dominican Republic news outlet \"Noticias SIN\" shows 20-year-old Sudiksha Konanki walking with friends and a young man at the RIU Republica Resort around 4:30 a.m. last Thursday, March 6.",

        "content": "The Senate passed a Republican-led government funding bill on Friday, averting a midnight government shutdown.\n\nThe result was 54-46.\n\nThe bill, which some Democrats have said failed to implement any limits on President Donald Trump and Elon Musk’s efforts to gut federal operations, will now be sent to the president’s desk for his signature.\n\nBy the numbers:\n\nIn a vote to advance the bill earlier Friday, a 60-vote threshold was required. That meant seven Democrats or Independents were needed to cross the aisle and vote with the 53 Republicans in favor of passage. With the help of Sen. Chuck Schumer, Republicans got 10 extra votes, pushing them past the threshold. The bill easily passed its final vote – which required only a majority – later in the evening.\n\nThe US Capitol in Washington, DC, US, on Friday, March 14, 2025. ( Allison Robbert/Bloomberg via Getty Images)\n\nDemocrats left with no choice\n\nIn the days leading up to the final vote, Democrats were pushing for a stopgap 30-day funding bill as an alternative.\n\nBut in a Congress controlled by Republicans, those efforts were weak from the start.\n\nDig deeper:\n\nDebates over funding the federal government routinely erupt at deadline moments, but this year it’s showing the political leverage of Republicans, newly in majority control of the White House and Congress.\n\nDemocrats are finding themselves unable to stop the Trump administration’s march across federal operations.\n\nHouse Republicans stuck together to pass their bill, with many conservatives cheering the DOGE cuts, leaving Democrats sidelined as they stood opposed. The House then left town, sending it to the Senate for final action.\n\nOptions for Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer were limited, especially as the party was wary of fully withholding their votes and being blamed for a full shutdown of services.\n\nThe Democratic Party was fracturing Friday as a torrent of frustration and anger was unleashed at Senate Democrats, led by Schumer, who faced what they saw as an awful choice: shut the government down or consent to a Republican funding bill that allows Trump to continue slashing the federal government.\n\nAfter Schumer announced Thursday that he would reluctantly support the bill, he bore the brunt of that anger, including a protest at his office, calls from progressives that he be primaried in 2028 and suggestions that the Democratic Party would soon be looking for new leaders.\n\nWhat they're saying:\n\n\"Trump has taken a blowtorch to our country and wielded chaos like a weapon,\" Schumer said. \"For Donald Trump, a shutdown would be a gift. It would be the best distraction he could ask for from his awful agenda.\"\n\nWhat’s in the bill?\n\nDig deeper:\n\nLawmakers said the bill would trim $13 billion in non-defense spending from the levels in the 2024 budget year and increase defense spending by $6 billion.\n\nThese changes are rather flat for both categories when compared with an overall topline of nearly $1.7 trillion in discretionary spending.\n\nThe bill does not cover the majority of government spending, including Social Security and Medicare. Funding for those two programs is on autopilot and not regularly reviewed by Congress.\n\nWhat they're saying:\n\n\"We're providing the greatest package of benefits that this country has ever provided. The biggest part of that is going to be tax cuts for the middle class and for businesses, small businesses, employers, people that hire people, jobs,\" Trump said during his meeting with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte on Thursday.",

That continues a trend dating back over the past six months, with used EV prices falling 15% to 20%.\n\nAmong the various brands surveyed, used Tesla vehicles saw the largest average year-over-year price drop, falling $5,013, or 13.6%. That was several percentage points larger than the rest of the top five biggest price drops, surpassing Maserati (10.6%), Chrysler (7.6%), Chevrolet (6.5%) and Genesis (4.8%).\n\n\"Several mainstream and premium brands had big used car price drops over the past year, in terms of percentage,\" said iSeeCars executive analyst Karl Brauer. \"But only Tesla and Maserati lost more than $5,000 in dollar value.\"\n\nAmong the used EV models analyzed in the study, the Porsche Taycan saw prices decline the most, falling 26.5% to an average price of $73,976. Used Tesla models ranked second and third, with Model S prices down 16.2% to $49,366 and Model Y prices down 15.9% to $31,247.\n\nNew Tesla electric vehicles fill the car lot at the Tesla retail location on Route 347 in Smithtown, New York on July 5, 2023. (Photo by John Paraskevas/Newsday RM via Getty Images)\n\n\"Used electric vehicle shoppers seeking a car for under $25,000 now have several choices, including the Nissan Leaf with an average price below $17,000,\" Brauer said.\n\nOther used EVs that are under the $25,000 threshold on average include the Hyundai Kona at $20,329 after prices dropped 13.4% and the Kia Niro at $21,758 following a 12.3% decline. The Tesla Model 3 is near that level, coming in at an average price of $26,354 after a 13.5% drop.\n\nBoth gas-powered used cars and hybrid vehicles experienced far more price stability than used EVs over the past year, with very modest declines observed in the study.\n\nThe price of an average used hybrid vehicle is down just 0.5% from a year ago, with a $156 decline to an average price of $29,881. Used internal combustion engine vehicles also saw 0.5% price drop compared to last year, amounting to a $153 decline to $31,281.\n\n\"It's not easy to find a great deal in today's used car market,\" Brauer said. \"But if an electric vehicle can serve your personal transportation needs, most used models have dropped substantially in cost over the past year, especially compared to gas and hybrid models.\"\n\nGET UPDATES ON THIS STORY AT FOXBUSINESS.COM",

Final touches are happening leading up to the big production which involves 10,000 participants.\n\n\n\nOne of Philadelphia’s biggest traditions – the St. Patrick’s Day parade – takes place Sunday.\n\nA lot of people are coming into the city to celebrate which is good news for businesses. Meanwhile, preparations are underway.\n\nTradition:\n\nThe annual Philadelphia Saint Patrick’s Day Parade is this Sunday at 11 a.m. and this year’s parade route is back on the Benjamin Franklin Parkway.\n\nThe parade staging begins on JFK Boulevard and 20th street and will travel east on JFK Boulevard before heading north on 16th Street to the Parkway. The parade will end at the Philadelphia Museum of Art.\n\nParade Organizer Michael Bradley said anywhere along the Parkway will be a great vantage point to soak in the parade.\n\nThe backstory:\n\nThe parade has a storied history that started back in 1771, and now each year about 10,000 people participate from Irish Dancers and Pipe bands to the parade floats.\n\n\"They’re all really special, colorful, loud and it’s just a great day,\" said Bradley. \"This is a diverse city. Everyone is welcome that day and I think there’s always a saying everybody wants to be Irish on St. Patrick’s Day and I think it’s true.\"\n\nWe're all Irish:\n\nThis year’s theme is \"St. Patrick, bless those dedicated to serving others.\"\n\n\"It’s not the people who lead the benefit, it’s the people who contribute to them, show up and make them successful and I think serving others widely encompasses a lot of people in this parade, the community and our Philadelphia region,\" said Bradley.\n\nTom Smith built floats for the parade for 25 years, but now his sons have taken over the massive undertaking. Keeping this year’s theme of service in mind, they are putting finishing touches on a float that honors the Red Cross, the firefighter pilots of the Los Angeles Wildfires and the men and women who protect and serve Philadelphia.\n\n\"1980’s era style police car. They fashioned it after the old blue and white ones from Philadelphia. They’re going to have a banner around the whole perimeter,\" said Smith. \"They enjoy what they see and that makes you feel good after you put the time and effort into it and it looks good when you’re done.\"\n\nBusiness is good:\n\nBusinesses along the Parkway are preparing for the crowds with annual estimates of 10 to 25,000 expected to attend depending on the weather.\n\n\"Pints of Guinness and great beer and great food. We have a lot of Irish specials that we’ve added to the menu,\" said Ulana Chmara Kelly of Con Murphys. \"11 o’clock, we start with live music all day. So 11 will be Seamus McGroaru. At 4 p.m. we have a full band starting and then after that we have a DJ.\"",

        "content": "The Brief President Donald Trump has signed the bill funding the government for six months. Passage of the government funding bill is seen as a victory for President Trump and congressional Republicans, despite the Senate needing votes from Democrats to pass it.\n\n\n\nPresident Donald Trump on Saturday signed legislation funding the government through the end of September, an expected move to avoid a partial government shutdown.\n\nA White House spokesperson confirmed the news on social media.\n\nThe Senate cleared the legislation on Friday in a 54-46 party line vote, with 10 members of the Senate Democratic caucus helping the bill advance to passage despite opposition from within their party — most vocally from colleagues in the House, who exhorted them to reject the bill out of hand.\n\nUS President Donald Trump walks with Elon Musk's son X Æ A-12 before boarding Marine One at the South Lawn of the White House in Washington, DC on March 14, 2025. Trump is spending the weekend at his Florida Mar-a-Lago resort. (Photo by ROBERTO SCHMI Expand\n\nWhat does the funding bill do?\n\nWhat we don't know:\n\nThe bill largely keeps government funding at levels set during Joe Biden's presidency, though with changes. It trims non-defense spending by about $13 billion from the previous year and increases defense spending by about $6 billion, which are marginal changes when talking about a topline spending level of nearly $1.7 trillion.\n\nRELATED: Trump has said he'll use the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 for mass deportations: Here's what it is\n\nWhat we don't know:\n\nIt’s unclear how the $13 billion in non-defense spending cuts will impact local and state government programs, including Medicaid.\n\nRELATED: DOGE closures: List, timeline of government offices that may close this year\n\nBig picture view:\n\nPassage of the funding bill through the House earlier in the week was a victory for Trump and House Speaker Mike Johnson, who managed to hold Republicans together and muscle the bill to passage without support from Democrats — something they've rarely been able to achieve in the past.\n\nDemocrats divided\n\nThe backstory:\n\nSenate Democrats argued for days over whether to force a shutdown, livid that Republicans in the House had drafted and passed the spending measure without their input. Democrats said the legislation shortchanges health care, housing and other priorities and gives Trump wide leeway to redirect federal spending even as his administration and the Department of Government Efficiency rapidly dismantle congressionally approved agencies and programs.\n\nIn the end, enough of the Democratic senators decided a government shutdown would be even worse than letting the funding bill pass.\n\nWhat they're saying:\n\nSenate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said a shutdown would have given the Trump administration the ability to deem whole agencies, programs and personnel non-essential, furloughing staff with no promise they would ever be rehired.\n\n\"A shutdown will allow DOGE to shift into overdrive,\" Schumer said. \"Donald Trump and Elon Musk would be free to destroy vital government services at a much faster rate.\"",

Their return was delayed due to technical failures with Boeing’s Starliner and later setbacks with a SpaceX capsule. Despite political scrutiny, NASA prioritized safety, and the duo are eager to reunite with family and resume life on Earth.\n\n\n\nNASA and SpaceX successfully launched four Crew-10 astronauts from Florida on Friday evening. The crew is headed to the International Space Station (ISS) where they will rendezvous with NASA’s two stranded astronauts, Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams.\n\nCrew-10's arrival at ISS set for late Saturday night\n\nWhat we know:\n\nNASA’s two stranded astronauts, Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams, are finally set to return home after spending nine months aboard the International Space Station (ISS). Their replacements — NASA's Anne McClain and Nichole Ayers, Japan’s Takuya Onishi, and Russia’s Kirill Peskov — launched aboard a SpaceX capsule from Kennedy Space Center on Friday night and are expected to arrive late Saturday.\n\n(L/R) Crew-10 mission Roscosmos cosmonaut Kirill Peskov, NASA astronauts Nichole Ayers and Anne McClain and JAXA astronaut Takuya Onishi walk out of the Neil A. Armstrong Operations and Checkout Building en route to launch complex 39A at the Kennedy Expand\n\nNASA scheduled an overlap between the crews to ensure a smooth transition before Wilmore and Williams depart next week, weather permitting. They will return with the rescue mission crew that arrived last September, with two empty seats reserved for them on the SpaceX capsule.\n\nWhat we don't know:\n\nWhile NASA has planned for a mid-March return, it remains uncertain if weather conditions will allow for a timely splashdown off the Florida coast. It is also unclear if additional technical issues could arise, given the past delays in securing their return. Furthermore, the full extent of any long-term physical or psychological effects on Wilmore and Williams from their unexpectedly extended stay in space is unknown.\n\nThe backstory:\n\nWilmore and Williams launched aboard Boeing’s new Starliner capsule on June 5, expecting to stay for just a week. However, their mission took an unexpected turn when helium leaks and thruster failures made it unsafe for Starliner to return them to Earth. After months of investigation, NASA decided to send the capsule back empty and arranged for them to return on a SpaceX flight.\n\nTheir homecoming, initially planned for February, was postponed again due to battery issues on SpaceX’s new capsule. To expedite the process, NASA opted for a used SpaceX capsule, moving their return up to mid-March.\n\nNASA astronauts Butch Wilmore (L) and Suni Williams, wearing Boeing spacesuits, depart the Neil A. Armstrong Operations and Checkout Building at Kennedy Space Center for Launch Complex 41 at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida to board the Expand\n\nCrew-10 was expected to launch earlier this week, but Wednesday night's mission was scrubbed due to a hydraulic issue with a clamp arm attached to the transporter erector system, officials said.\n\nBig picture view:\n\nThe extended stay of Wilmore and Williams has highlighted the risks and challenges associated with space travel, particularly with new spacecraft like Boeing’s Starliner. Their situation has drawn political attention, with figures like President Donald Trump and SpaceX’s Elon Musk blaming delays on the previous administration.\n\nHowever, NASA has maintained that the decisions were made with safety as the top priority. Meanwhile, the incident underscores the ongoing rivalry between SpaceX and Boeing in the commercial spaceflight industry and the reliability concerns surrounding new spacecraft development.\n\nHow long have Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams been in space?\n\nTimeline:\n\nThe replacements for NASA's two stuck astronauts launched to the International Space Station on Friday night, paving the way for the pair's return after nine long months. Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams need SpaceX to get this relief team to the space station before they can check out. Below is their timeline of events:\n\nJune 2024: Wilmore and Williams launched aboard Boeing’s Starliner for what was supposed to be a week-long mission.\n\nOver the summer: Helium leaks and thruster failures prevented their return, prompting months of investigation.\n\nSeptember: NASA ruled Starliner unsafe for crewed return and arranged for Wilmore and Williams to fly home on a SpaceX mission.\n\nFebruary 2025: Their scheduled return was delayed again due to battery issues with SpaceX’s new capsule.\n\nMarch: NASA switched to a used SpaceX capsule to expedite their homecoming, with launch occurring Friday night and arrival at the ISS expected late Saturday.\n\nNext week, Wilmore and Williams are set to undock and return to Earth, weather permitting. The earliest day would be Wednesday.\n\nWhen will Crew-10 arrive at the International Space Station? How long does it take to reach the ISS?\n\nTimeline:\n\nAfter lifting off from Launch Complex 39A at NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida, Crew-10 will fly through space until it reaches the International Space Station.\n\n7:03 p.m., March 14 - Crew-10 lifts off from Kennedy Space Center\n\n11:30 p.m. March 15 - Crew-10 will reach ISS and will dock with the Harmony module\n\n1:05 a.m., March 16 - Crew-10 astronauts will be allowed to board ISS.\n\n1:40 a.m. - March 16 - Crew-9 will deliver farewell remarks, as Crew-10 delivers welcome remarks\n\nCrew-10 is expected to reach the ISS at 11:30 p.m. on Saturday, March 15. It takes a little more than 26 hours to reach the space station.\n\nWhat they're saying:\n\nThis launch paves the way for Crew-9, including the Starliner astronauts, to come back home.\n\n\"Get the crew up to the space station and get Sunni and Butch home for sure,\" said David Denault, a Central Florida space expert and who created the About Space Today podcast.\n\nCrew-10’s arrival on station will send Crew-9, including Williams, Wilmore and Nick Hague, back home.\n\n\"It’s just something as astronauts we know we always have to be ready for. You always have to be flexible, you know that there’s a plan for your mission — that plan can always change,\" said NASA astronaut Jessica Meir.\n\nThose changes could have long-term effects on Sunni and Butch, according to Denault.\n\n\"They will take months, I believe, sitting down, being debriefed and going through those psychological periods that they had at the space station,\" said the space expert.\n\nOn board the space station, Crew-10’s goals are science and maintenance of the football-field-sized floating lab.\n\nMaterial flammability tests, lunar navigation and medical studies on themselves will take up their time on the four-month mission.\n\n\"We’re doing a series of tests both physiological and psychological that will help us on our trips to lunar adventures and future trips to Mars,\" said Dina Contella, deputy manager for the International Space Station program.\n\nDig deeper:\n\nDuring their time in the orbiting laboratory, SpaceX said the crew will conduct new research to prepare for human exploration beyond low-Earth orbit and to benefit humanity on Earth.\n\nThey will test spacecraft materials, engage with students via ham radio, test a lunar navigation system, and study how space affects the body.\n\nMeet the members of the Crew-10 mission\n\nThe four new astronauts heading to space on the Crew-10 mission are Kirill Peskov, Nichole Ayers, Anne McClain and Takuya Onishi.\n\nThe SpaceX Crew-10 members are Kirill Peskov, left, Nichole Ayers, Anne McClain and Takuya Onishi.

Three Hondas were stolen in Royersford overnight Wednesday. Police are even telling car owners to take some extraordinary precautions.\n\n\n\nUpper Providence Police say three Hondas were stolen from one Royersford neighborhood overnight.\n\nAll the cars were locked and the key fobs were inside the homes.\n\nWhat we know:\n\nInvestigators say the most disturbing part is that crooks are using new technology to clone victims' key fobs to steal their cars.\n\nPolice released video Thursday of a trio they believe were involved in the thefts.\n\nIn the video, one of the suspects is seen carrying a dark-colored backpack.\n\nDetectives say the crooks used wireless key-cloning scanners to steal the key codes to steal the cars. Kind of like a high-tech hot wire.\n\n\"They’re key is right inside their front door. There are technologies if the device they are using are close enough to the key fob they can clone the key fob\" said Det. Sgt. Patrick Haines of the Upper Providence Township Police Department.\n\nMost newer model cars have keyless or smart remote entry, which allows the owner to enter or start their vehicle just by having the key fob close by.\n\nAccording to police, thieves are apparently taking advantage of this newer technology by using aftermarket devices to remotely scan for a key fob signal and quickly create a cloned key.\n\nPolice said thieves can place similar devices underneath the dashboard and download the vehicle’s information, which they can then program into a blank key fob.\n\nAll three late model Hondas were stolen outside of homes off Roboda Boulevard and Vaughn Road and they all had remote keyless fobs.\n\nPolice say that makes a total of six so far this year.\n\nIt’s believed that the crooks scanned and captured key fob codes while walking past homes.\n\nWhat they're saying:\n\n\"This morning we heard they are getting stolen so if you think you lock your door you are safe but apparently they are one step ahead\" said Micheal Indeglio of Royersford.\n\n\n\n\"It’s shocking. It’s not a norm in our neighborhood. I mean we did hear about someone going though cars in the winter but to have cars stolen is pretty shocking,\" added resident Greg.\n\n\n\nPolice are actually recommending car owners use what’s called a faraday pouch for their key fobs. The pouches are designed to protect, block your electronics from wireless hackers.\n\n\n\nUpper Providence Police say it’s a sign of the times.\n\n\"It’s extremely frustrating. We all are working to support our families and trying to secure our property as best we can. It’s very frustrating,\" said Sgt. Haines.\n\nWhat you can do:\n\nOne way to help prevent car theft is very low-tech—a steering wheel lock.\n\nPolice say they can work wonders because once thieves see one, many times, they keep going.\n\nUpper Providence police are also asking those who live in the area to review their home surveillance cameras for anything suspicious.",

        "source": "https://www.fox29.com/",
        "content": "A federal appeals court on Friday handed the Trump administration a legal victory, allowing the enforcement of executive orders restricting diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs.\n\nThe decision lifts a nationwide injunction issued by U.S. District Judge Adam Abelson, who previously ruled that Trump’s orders were likely unconstitutional. While the appeals court judges noted potential First Amendment concerns, they found that blocking the orders entirely went too far.\n\nThe lawsuit, filed by Baltimore city officials and advocacy groups, challenges Trump’s efforts to eliminate federal DEI funding. The case is expected to continue in the courts.\n\nWhat did Trump’s executive orders change?\n\nThe backstory:\n\nTrump signed his first executive order on DEI on his first day back in office, directing federal agencies to terminate equity-related grants and contracts. A follow-up order required federal contractors to certify that they do not promote DEI programs.\n\nThe city of Baltimore, diversity officers, professors, and restaurant worker groups sued the administration, arguing the orders unconstitutionally limit speech and overstep presidential authority. Judge Abelson, a Biden nominee, ruled that the orders lacked a clear definition of DEI and would have a chilling effect on speech.\n\nThe Trump administration defended the orders, saying they only target DEI initiatives that violate civil rights laws and align federal spending with Trump’s policy priorities.\n\nWhat did the court decide?\n\nThe other side:\n\nA three-judge panel from the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals lifted the injunction, allowing Trump’s orders to be enforced while the case moves forward.\n\nUS President Donald Trump steps off Air Force One as he arrives at Palm Beach International Airport in West Palm Beach, Florida, on March 14, 2025. (Photo by BRENDAN SMIALOWSKI/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nJudge Pamela Harris, an Obama appointee, wrote that while the orders could raise concerns over free speech, the lower court’s nationwide block was too broad. The panel included two Obama appointees and one Trump appointee.\n\nWhat’s next for DEI programs?\n\nBig picture view:\n\nThe ruling marks a significant legal victory for Trump, who has faced multiple lawsuits challenging his executive orders since returning to office. However, the case is still active, meaning further legal challenges could alter enforcement.\n\nTrump’s push to eliminate federal support for DEI programs is part of a broader Republican movement that argues these initiatives undermine merit-based hiring and education. Supporters of DEI policies counter that they help institutions serve diverse populations and address systemic inequality.\n\nWith legal battles ongoing, the future of DEI policies under federal funding remains uncertain.",

They are my family and they all said welcome home and it touched my heart!\"\n\nCustomer Steve Barton said, \"You see it on the news, but you don’t think it could happen in somewhere where you live. You don’t think that you’d be impacted by it, but I’m so proud of this community.\"\n\nSystem is broken:\n\nEver since they were detained, friends and customers of Jersey Kabob wrote letters on behalf of Celal and Emine to help keep them in this country.\n\nThey’ve been waiting for word on their green card application for years, in a system that state and local officials say is broken.\n\n\"There is a very real difference of a broken immigration system. The border issues we’ve seen down to the south and what we see behind us today – a huge difference,\" New Jersey Representative Donald Norcross stated.\n\nMayor Randall Teague said, \"I hope there is and there should be a path to citizenship for them. These are the types of people that we want to have in our country and we should be able to have them legally in our country.\"\n\nRelated article\n\nDig deeper:\n\nThe couple’s 25-year-old son, Muhammed has been shouldering most of the weight of the stressful situation and admits it hasn’t been easy, \"It hasn’t been, I mean, to be honest, until you asked me, I don’t really think about how I feel. But, then you know, somebody asks you, like, ‘How are you doing?’ You just keep moving, day by day.\"\n\nAnd, Emine couldn’t be more proud and then spoke a phrase in Turkish, to which Muhammed translated, loosely, saying, \"She said as she was my age, she was always outgoing, very outspoken and not afraid to say anything and always being an independent young woman, so she’s like, ‘I see my genetics in him.’\"\n\nWhat's next:\n\nEmine was supposed to be in court next week, but her husband’s case isn’t set for another month. Their attorney is trying to have both of them appear together so they can know their fate at the same time.",

        "content": "The Brief A big surprise was in store for some youth football and flag football players from Chester County. It was not their typical day out for lunch at a local restaurant. It was the thrill of a lifetime for a group of 20 kids.\n\n\n\nIt was a day a group of Chester Community Charter School students will never forget. They thought they were being treated to a special lunch at Applebee’s in Bensalem, but that was just the appetizer.\n\nThe main course – Saquon Barkley.\n\nThrill of a lifetime:\n\nTa’Jir Foster could barely get the words out, he was so excited, \"My heart stopped. I don’t know!\"\n\nThe star-struck kids were over the top excited as the Eagles star running back served up burgers and fun, as part of Applebee’s \"Doing Good in the Neighborhood\" initiative.\n\nWhat Saquon had to say:\n\n\"I’m all about spending time with kids. I feel like if you are able to impact youth, the future is going to be so much brighter,\" Barkley explained.\n\nHe opened up his time with the kids, saying, \"Ask me anything, really. I’m easy.\"\n\nOne boy asked, \"How did you feel when you won the Super Bowl?\"\n\nSaquon responded, saying, \"That’s a good question. I’ve been dreaming about it since I was your guys age. Of how it would feel in that moment and when it actually comes to life, it means everything.\"\n\nImage 1 of 7 ▼\n\nBig picture view:\n\nSaquon signed autographs on napkins, shirts, you name it. He took pictures and joked with the group, but passed on words of wisdom, too.\n\n\"It was the message that was given to me. You can do whatever you want in this world as long as you put your mind to it. Surround yourself with the right people and have the right mindset.\"\n\nWhat the kids said:\n\nThe kids soaked up Saquon’s advice. Youssuf Bility said, \"He showed me everyone can be what you want to be when you grow up. It was great, and it was a special moment for me.\"\n\nShawn Allen said, \"He said we had to do 10 pushups every day so you get stronger, run laps every day to get faster, eat right, so you can get stronger. Amazing. Amazing. I can't even explain it.\"\n\nRace challenge:\n\nOf course, there’s always one in the crowd. 5th grader George Benson challenged Saquon to a race. George was right out the door and everyone went for the magical moment.\n\nSaquon told the kids he wasn’t going to cut them a break and he didn’t, so it was pushups for them and then back inside to get their very own autographed footballs.\n\nHe spent almost two hours with his young fans and seemed to be having just as much fun as the kids.",

        "content": "The Brief President Donald Trump said he was visiting the Justice Department to \"set out my vision\" for a tough-on-crime agenda. The one-time defendant vowed to expel \"the rogue actors.\" Trump's budget appeared likely to pass the Senate with the help of 10 Democrats who voted in favor of it.\n\n\n\nPresident Donald Trump made what the White House is calling a \"historic\" visit to the Justice Department Friday to deliver remarks and rally support for his agenda.\n\nThe visit, the first by Trump and the first by any president in a decade, took him into the belly of an institution he has disparaged in searing terms for years but one that he has sought to reshape by installing loyalists and members of his personal defense team in top leadership positions.\n\nTrump was also scheduled to sign executive orders at 12 p.m. ET, but it’s unclear which orders that included, or if that was still happening. The event was to be closed to the press.\n\nFollow below for live updates.\n\nSenate passes Trump's budget bill, averting government shutdown\n\n6:46 p.m. ET: The Senate passed a six-month spending bill on Friday, averting a government shutdown.\n\nThe vote was 54-46.\n\nDemocrats voiced frustration that Republicans went ahead with a measure they said included little input from them, and one they viewed as shortchanging key priorities such as health care and housing assistance. But in the end, some of them viewed a shutdown as a worse outcome and supported Democratic leader Chuck Schumer's effort to allow the bill to come to a final vote.\n\nSenate appears likely to pass Trump budget\n\n5:07 p.m. ET: The Senate is taking a key vote that needs 60 votes to push the Republican-backed government funding bill forward in the chamber.\n\nWhile it’s not a vote for final passage, which only requires a simple majority, this vote is a larger hurdle because it requires 60 votes to overcome the Senate’s filibuster rules.\n\nThe vote ended 62-38, with 10 Democrats voting in favor to break the filibuster. The final vote is scheduled for later in the evening.\n\nTrump vows to ‘expel the rogue actors’\n\n4:30 p.m. ET: \"We will expel the rogue actors and corrupt forces from our government. We will expose, very much expose their egregious crimes and severe misconduct of which was levels never seen anything like it,\" Trump said in a wide-ranging speech that touched on everything from Russia's war against Ukraine to the price of eggs.\n\n\"It’s going to be legendary. And going to also be legendary for the people that are able to seek it out and bring justice. We will restore the scales of justice in America, and we will ensure that such abuses never happen again in our country.\"\n\nTrump starts speaking at Justice Department\n\n3:40 p.m. ET: President Trump has begun speaking at the Justice Department, 40 minutes later than planned.\n\nVance says US manufacturing can rebound\n\n2 p.m. ET: Vice President JD Vance toured a Michigan plastics manufacturing facility on Friday, promoting a promised Trump administration industrial renaissance nationwide even as jitters about rising tariffs and steep drops in consumer confidence and financial markets point to the opposite.\n\nVance was in Bay City, which was known in the 1800s for thriving sawmills and shipbuilding concerns that have long since closed. Speaking at Vantage Plastics, he vowed, \"We started a great American comeback,\" and said the Trump administration will \"make it easier and more affordable to make things again in the United States.\"\n\nBut he also repeatedly urged patience before the Trump White House's economic policies take hold, noting, \"This is not always easy, and it doesn’t happen overnight.\"\n\n– Associated Press\n\nTrump to speak at Justice Department\n\nWhat we know:\n\nTrump is scheduled to speak at the Justice Department at 3 p.m. ET.\n\nRELATED: Trump has said he'll use the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 for mass deportations: Here's what it is\n\nWhat we don't know:\n\nIt’s unclear whether it will air live or as a taped playback. You can watch his speech on LiveNow from FOX in the video player above as soon as it’s available.\n\nWhat they're saying:\n\n\"I’m going to set out my vision,\" Trump said Thursday about the purpose for a visit to the Justice Department.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump speaks during a meeting with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte in the Oval Office of the White House on March 13, 2025 in Washington, DC. (Photo by Andrew Harnik/Getty Images) Expand\n\n\"President Trump will visit the Department of Justice to give remarks on restoring law and order, removing violent criminals from our communities, and ending the weaponization of justice against Americans for their political leanings,\" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement.\n\nHave other presidents spoken at the Justice Department?\n\nThe backstory:\n\nAlthough there's some precedent for presidents to speak to the Justice Department workforce, Trump's trip two months into his second term is particularly striking because of his unique status as a onetime criminal defendant indicted by the agency he is now poised to address. His remarks are also likely to feature an airing of grievances over his exposure to the criminal justice system — including an FBI search in 2022 of his Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Florida, for classified documents.\n\nRELATED: Trump asks Supreme Court to allow birthright citizenship restrictions\n\nThe relationship between presidents and Justice Department leaders has waxed and waned over the decades depending on the personalities of the officeholders and the sensitivity of the investigations that have dominated the day. The dynamic between President Joe Biden, a Democrat, and his attorney general, Merrick Garland, was known to be fraught in part because of special counsel investigations that Garland oversaw into Biden's mishandling of classified information and into the firearms and tax affairs of his son Hunter.\n\nHow Trump upended Justice Department norms\n\nDig deeper:\n\nAttorney General Pam Bondi has asserted that the department needs to be depoliticized even as critics assert agency leadership is injecting politics into the decision-making process.\n\nWhen it comes to setting its agenda, the Justice Department historically takes a cue from the White House but looks to maintain its independence on individual criminal investigations. Trump has upended such norms. Bondi was part of Trump’s defense team at his first impeachment trial, and Kash Patel, another close ally, serves as his FBI director.\n\nRELATED: Judge orders Trump administration to reinstate thousands of fired workers\n\nBondi regularly praises Trump in Fox News Channel appearances and proudly noted that she had removed portraits of Biden, Garland and Vice President Kamala Harris from a Justice Department wall upon arriving.\n\n\"We all adore Donald Trump, and we want to protect him and fight for his agenda. And the people of America overwhelmingly elected him for his agenda,\" Bondi said in a recent Fox interview with Trump's daughter-in-law Lara Trump.\n\nRELATED: Trump's trade war 2.0: Timeline of tariffs, retaliation, and global fallout\n\nEven before Bondi was confirmed, the Justice Department fired department employees who served on special counsel Jack Smith's team, which charged Trump with plotting to overturn the 2020 election and with hoarding classified documents at Mar-a-Lago. Both cases were dismissed last November in line with longstanding Justice Department policy against indicting sitting presidents.\n\nRELATED: Department of Education employees sent home, nearly half of staff to be eliminated: report\n\nOfficials also demanded from the FBI lists of thousands of employees who worked on investigations into the Jan 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol, when a mob of Trump's supporters stormed the building in an effort to halt the certification of the electoral vote, and fired prosecutors who had participated in the cases. And they've ordered the dismissal of a criminal case against New York Mayor Eric Adams by saying the charges had handicapped the Democrat’s ability to partner in the Republican administration’s fight against illegal immigration.\n\nWhat's next:\n\nLeavitt, Trump’s press secretary, is one of three administration officials who face a lawsuit from The Associated Press on First and Fifth Amendment grounds. The AP says the three are punishing the news agency for editorial decisions they oppose. The White House says the AP is not following an executive order to refer to the Gulf of Mexico as the Gulf of America.",

Montgomery County officials are asking for financial help rebuilding the facility.\n\n\n\nAfter the devastating fire that burned through the SPS building in Montgomery County, the company is reportedly going to be laying off 250 employees and the county says they want to do everything in their power to stop that from happening.\n\nWhat we know:\n\nAbout one month ago, a massive fire destroyed the SPS Technologies building. County officials called it the worst fire in their known history.\n\nMontgomery County Chair Neil Makhija explained, \"It’s devastating for people who have worked here, in many cases, for decades. This company has been here for 120 years in the community.\"\n\nHe continued, \"I am here today because, unfortunately, SPS has sent letters to approximately 250 employees, one half of the workers, letting them know that they will be laid off.\"\n\nRelated article\n\nWhat they're saying:\n\nSPS reportedly intends to conduct a massive layoff, something the county says could be devastating to the local community.\n\n\"The residents of Jenkintown, Abington, Cheltenham care deeply about seeing these jobs remain in the community and that their families have the chance to remain and be provided for,\" Makhija said. \"An unplanned event where you are immediately out of work, it’s much harder to pivot, especially after working here for decade.\"\n\nChairman Makhija is now asking Warren Buffett for help, \"This company is owned by Berkshire Hathaway, which is, right now, actually one of the only companies in the stock market that is going up, so they have more value than ever and we hope they will invest that right here, in Montgomery County.\"\n\nRelated article\n\nLocal perspective:\n\nLocal businesses agree that long-term, without hundreds of local patrons, could be damaging and residents think so, as well.\n\nDebbi Hopkins said, \"Those people use some of the establishments around the area, so it will affect it to some degree.\"\n\nWhat's next:\n\nThat is why the county says they are willing to do whatever they can to help. Chairman Makhija added, \"If they want to make the decision to stay here, I am confident we can find a way to make that happen.\"\n\nThe county has their eye on multiple sites that could be suitable for a rebuild. They also say workers have reached out to them already, so a job fair is being planned.",

        "source": "https://www.cbsnews.com/philadelphia/",
        "content": "Villanova fired Kyle Neptune on Saturday after a three-year run where he succeeded Hall of Fame coach Jay Wright and failed to ever make the NCAA Tournament.\n\nNeptune went 54-47 overall and 31-29 in the Big East in three seasons with the Wildcats, including a 19-14 record this season. The Wildcats — who won two national championships under Wright — lost to UConn on Thursday night in a Big East Conference Tournament quarterfinal at Madison Square Garden.\n\nIt was the first major decision made by Eric Roedl, a Villanova alumnus hired earlier this season as the athletic director.\n\n\"Since coming to Villanova, I have been struck by Kyle's tireless work ethic and his dedication to the student-athletes he served,\" Roedl said in a statement. \"We are grateful to Kyle for his long service to Villanova and his mentorship to the many outstanding young men he has coached.\"\n\nNeptune felt the heat this season as the Wildcats — once a perennial Big East winner and national title contender — slid into mediocrity and out of national prominence. Not even regular-season wins over St. John's and UConn could offset the overall lack of consistency in a season that also included losses to Columbia and Saint Joseph's.\n\nThe 40-year-old Neptune served under Wright on the Villanova coaching staff before accepting the head coaching position at Fordham in 2021. Neptune went 16-16 in his lone season at Fordham.\n\nWright, who was inducted into the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame in 2021, guided Villanova to titles in 2016 and 2018 and led the Wildcats to two other Final Four appearances. He went 520-197 in 21 seasons at the school and has remained a steady presence at Villanova games. He now works for CBS.\n\nThe Wildcats will miss the NCAA Tournament for a third straight season and for the first time since Wright's first three seasons more than 20 years ago. Wright was given the grace period Neptune was not in large part because this was no rebuild on the Main Line — the program boasted healthy NIL coffers and had the nation's leading scorer this season in Eric Dixon.\n\nVillanova could still play in the new College Basketball Crown tournament later this month in Las Vegas.\n\nAssistant Mike Nardi will serve as interim head coach.\n\nThe program that once anchored its success on the Villanova Way — a mini-dynasty built on NBA-ready upperclassmen — has become discombobulated under the roster chaos born of NIL money and the transfer portal. The yearly roster turnover has done little to build the culture — where senior stars once taught the new kids the concept of Villanova basketball — that was once a championship hallmark under Wright.\n\nWell-liked and respected by all in the program, Neptune had downplayed criticism throughout his tenure, insisting over the last two seasons as fan unrest grew on the suburban campus that he didn't hear fans who booed him at times during pregame introductions or the horde that chanted \"Fire Neptune!\"\n\nWright floored Villanova when he retired at 60 years old just weeks after leading the Wildcats to a Final Four in 2022. Neptune was hired the same month. He first came to Villanova in 2008, serving two seasons as video coordinator. Neptune returned as an assistant coach in 2013 and worked under Wright as Villanova rose into a perennial Final Four contender.\n\nThat success as an assistant never carried over once Neptune got the top job. Villanova now will look to hire only its fifth coach since 1973.\n\nThe question is, will ties to Wright even matter as the search for a new coach ramps up, or will Villanova look outside the program for a fresh start?",

But Buck, who started her career as a nurse, has broken the glass ceiling.\n\n\"I've experienced some challenges that you normally wouldn't have in your career,\" Buck said. \"It's been interesting to say the least.\"\n\nRight after Buck assumed the position, the COVID-19 pandemic shut down the world.\n\nShe managed Riddle's pandemic response while also overseeing a major expansion of Riddle, part of Main Line Health. The once sleepy little hospital has grown into a thriving medical campus in Media.\n\n\"The best reward has been seeing the transformation of Riddle Hospital without losing its core,\" Buck said. \"The values, the commitment to the community, the support of the community, the employees here.\"\n\nCBS News Philadelphia\n\nA grand mosaic in the lobby shows the Delaware County community around the hospital, with thousands of tiles decorated with pictures and words like hope, unity and excellence.\n\n\"This mosaic is a reflection of the hospital, also the community that we serve,\" Buck said.\n\nBuck started her professional life as a nurse and says service is in her blood.\n\n\"The fact that I'm a registered nurse, I think I bring a little bit of a different perspective to the role,\" she added. \"I can tell you it wasn't a straight shot [to get here], that's for sure. I tell people I serpentined to get here. ... When I first started out as nursing, I didn't aspire to be, you know, the president of a hospital or CEO or anything like that. That was not my dream. I just knew that I wanted to provide good quality care to every person that I touched. And the opportunities just kind of came my way.\"\n\nNow Buck is committed to making more opportunities for others, especially women.\n\n\"We need more women, more nurses, I would say even, in health care, in leadership positions as presidents, as CEO. ... I just get so much joy in doing this work, because I know it's bigger than me. It's not just about me, it's about those lives that are entrusted in our hands.\"",

        "content": "The road to return to the mound has been a long one for Andrew Painter, and it's still being traveled.\n\nSidelined for nearly two years due to Tommy John surgery on his right elbow, the Philadelphia Phillies' top prospect took a major step in his rehab. Painter threw live batting practice to major league hitters for the first time in two years, throwing to Alec Bohm, Bryson Stott and Brandon Marsh in the session with encouraging results.\n\n\"I felt the stuff was coming out pretty good,\" Painter said before the Phillies' Spring Breakout game at BayCare Ballpark Friday. \"The hitters were saying the same. Health is the biggest thing, and I'd just like to build off of it.\"\n\nAndrew Painter of the Philadelphia Phillies poses for a photo during the Philadelphia Phillies Photo Day at BayCare Ballpark on Thursday, February 20, 2025, in Clearwater, Florida. Mike Carlson/MLB Photos via Getty Images\n\nFor the first time in a long time, Painter is starting to get a sense of normalcy. This has been the biggest step in his recovery from Tommy John surgery, after blowing past hitters with a fastball two years ago that put everyone in Major League Baseball on notice.\n\n\"Just kind of getting back in the routine,\" Painter said. \"Rehab is so fixated, you know what you have every day. You know you have this many throws at this distance and this many throws here. So now, it's kind of like on your own, where you're at and figuring out what works for me.\"\n\nWhen Painter was last throwing to live hitters, the hype train was at an all-time high. He already was impressing the Phillies in his quest to be in the starting rotation at the age of 19, easily getting hitters out with fastballs in the upper 90s. Then, the elbow wasn't feeling right, which eventually led to Tommy John surgery in July 2023.\n\nPainter was sidelined throughout the 2024 season and didn't throw to live hitters again until the Arizona Fall League. He doesn't turn 22 until April.\n\nAndrew Painter of the Glendale Desert Dogs celebrates during the game between the Glendale Desert Dogs and the Surprise Saguaros at Surprise Stadium on Tuesday, November 12, 2024 in Surprise, Arizona. Norm Hall/MLB Photos via Getty Images\n\n\"Still easing in. First one,\" Painter said. \"Two years ago, first one felt really good, and that led to some problems. I got to take it nice and easy. You got to monitor it. When your body feels good, you can push a little bit. But you got to know. You got to take it week by week and know what the future looks like.\"\n\nThe Phillies don't plan to have Painter with the big club until midsummer. When he eventually pitches in live games, he's expected to start at either Double-A Reading or Triple-A Lehigh Valley. He could also stay in Clearwater until the weather gets warmer up north and the innings build up.\n\nPainter is so close to getting back, but patience is a virtue. He's not ready to showcase his skills yet, even though he'll be there to support his future teammates in the Spring Breakout game.\n\n\"I'd take any game action,\" Painter said. \"But I'll take what I can get.\"",

        "content": "Doctors are warning about a painful and viral mix-up on social media: People accidentally get glue in their eyes instead of eye drops. While the mishap sounds alarming, doctors say it doesn't cause permanent damage.\n\nA viral TikTok video that has been shared more than 41,000 times has become a cautionary tale. It's one of many that often go viral in hopes of warning people about a dangerous trend.\n\nCBS Philadelphia\n\n\"It can be quite serious depending on the volume of the glue that gets into the eye,\" Dr. Julia Haller, ophthalmologist-in-chief at Wills Eye Hospital, said. \"These glues unfortunately harden in a matter of seconds.\"\n\nHaller says it's a common problem that is treated in the emergency department.\n\n\"What we're seeing is that the lids are stuck together. So we have to very gently break down that adhesion, pry the lids apart and piece by piece very meticulously take out tiny little pieces of that solid adhesion,\" Haller said.\n\nHaller says eye drops are often in bottles similar in size to other products dangerous to the eye.\n\nCBS Philadelphia\n\n\"It can cause a chemical burn in addition to the adhesions. And so in addition to chipping away those adhesions where there's some loss of lash and skin, there can be a chemical burn to the surface of the eye and damage to the cornea,\" Haller said.\n\nThis mistake often happens when people are distracted or unable to see well. They may confuse eye drops with eyelash glue, nail glue, or even ear drops.\n\n\"What we are seeing in the emergency room is unfortunately even parents who mistakenly put the wrong drop in their children's eyes,\" Haller said.\n\nTo avoid this, people are encouraged to read the labels out loud before using them and to store the bottles in different locations.\n\n\"In some way labeling it so that even in a rush, it's easier to identify what drop you're putting in,\" Haller said.\n\nDoctors say that if this happens, people should immediately use water to flush out the glue. They also say to get it out of your eye as fast as possible, check with their doctor, or go to an urgent care center.",

        "source": "https://www.cbsnews.com/philadelphia/",
        "content": "Philadelphia Phillies pitching prospect Moisés Chace described starting in the Spring Breakout Game as a \"beautiful experience.\"\n\nJust a year ago, Chace was a 20-year-old middling prospect in the Baltimore Orioles system. A lot has changed in a year, as Chace has risen up the prospect rankings since getting traded to the Phillies -- and is certainly on the radar as a potential part of this team's major league rotation in the future.\n\nThe Spring Breakout Game was Chace's opportunity to back up what the Phillies have seen in him.\n\n\"It's a new experience for sure,\" Chace said through a translator at BayCare BallPark Friday. \"I'm just staying true to myself and embracing my surroundings. I enjoyed being around the best of the best.\"\n\nChace showed why the Phillies believe in his upside, pitching a 1-2-3 first inning in starting the Spring Breakout Game Friday as the Phillies won 5-3 over the Pittsburgh Pirates. He threw two strikeouts in one inning of work, in large part due to a cutter that has favored him well since arriving in the Phillies organization.\n\nHe used the cutter on one of those two first-inning strikeouts.\n\n\"I like the speed and deceptiveness of the pitch,\" Chace said. \"They've really been emphasizing the fastballs high in the zone, the sliders, the velocity of that pitch, and the other pitches I'm mixing in as well.\"\n\nChace's career certainly turned for the better since being traded to the Phillies as part of the Gregory Soto deal last July. In Baltimore's minor league system, he started nine of 17 games pitched for High-A Aberdeen, throwing 53 innings while holding opposing hitters to a .201 batting average. Chace struck out 76 and walked 30 while having a 3.46 ERA.\n\nThe Phillies started Chace in High-A Jersey Shore, but it only took him two starts to get called up to Double-A Reading. Chase went 2-1 with a 3.66 ERA in his four starts, holding opponents to a .200 average while striking out 35 and walking seven. He's elevated to the No. 5 overall prospect in the Phillies system (per MLB.com) and the No. 2 pitching prospect behind Andrew Painter.\n\nThe change of scenery has benefitted Chace, as 2025 will be a huge year for his development. A good start in Double-A Reading and Chace could be on the fast track to the major leagues as soon as next year.\n\nThe Phillies are banking on that being the case.\n\n\"I really enjoy the way they manage the pitchers, the way they manage the workload,\" Chace said. \"I've enjoyed their approach to managing my workload...I'm feeling great and working on building (my game) up.\"",

She sounded very upset while saying, \"Something happened in our house.\"\n\nShe broke down crying while giving the address. At that point another woman took the phone.\n\n\"One of the roommates who's passed out and she was drunk last night and she's not waking up,\" the second woman told a dispatcher. \"Oh, and they saw some man in their house last night.\"\n\nThe initial caller came back on the line, asking if she could tell the dispatcher what happened and saying, \"At 4 a.m...\" The dispatcher cut her off, saying she needed to know what was going on at that time and if someone was passed out.\n\nThe woman said they would go check and then said the student was still passed out and not waking up. The dispatcher told them help was on the way. The caller or callers at that point sounded like they may have been crying and breathing heavily while telling the dispatcher that the person who was not breathing was 20 years old.\n\nA male voice was then heard on the line saying hello and the dispatcher asked them to stop passing the phone around. The male also told the dispatcher that the woman was not breathing. The call ended shortly afterward when police arrived.\n\nFour University of Idaho students were found murdered at this home in Moscow, Idaho, on Sunday, Nov. 13, 2022.

The students were killed in the early morning at a rental home near their campus in Moscow, Idaho.\n\nA judge previously entered a not-guilty plea on Kohberger's behalf. Prosecutors have said they will seek the death penalty if he is convicted.\n\nKohberger's trial is scheduled to begin Aug. 11 and expected to last more than three months.",

Here’s other scams to look out for.\n\nHow scammers use AI to clone fake IRS Website. Here’s other scams to look out for.\n\nCybersecurity experts expect a significant surge in tax-related scams in the final month before Tax Day.\n\nSecurity software company DNSFilter found that traffic to malicious domains with \"tax\" in the name peaked 30 days before Tax Day in 2024.\n\nPhishing and smishing remain the most common forms of tax-related scams, according to DNSFilter, where attackers impersonate legitimate entities like the IRS through email, text, or phone calls to steal personal information.\n\nThe IRS warns it will never threaten legal action, promise a refund, demand payment through text or email, or call and ask for your credit or debit card information over the phone.\n\nYet scammers still manage to prey on thousands of taxpayers each year. The average tax scam victim last year lost an average of $8,199, according to McAfee.\n\nCybersecurity firm Guardio has tracked a 77% increase in tax-related phishing scams in 2025.\n\nAI-generated imposter websites, emails\n\nGuardio's Karin Zilberstein said scammers are increasingly using artificial intelligence to create realistic imposter websites and emails.\n\n\"It's increased the quality of scams,\" she said. \"So scams just look so much more real, their language is more eloquent, the links are more realistic, the visuals on the fake website imitate precisely the imitated brand.\"\n\nAn official government website like IRS will always end in .gov. A site purporting to be the IRS ending in .org, .com, or anything else should be a red flag.\n\nPhishing texts\n\nA common imposter IRS text currently circulating asks for your personal information in order to receive your economic impact payment.\n\nThe texts include a link to click to \"provide you accurate personal information.\"\n\nIgnore it. The IRS says those who qualify for this legitimate credit because they didn't claim it on their 2021 returns don't have to do anything in order to get it.\n\n\"No action is needed for eligible taxpayers to receive these payments,\" it reads on the IRS website.\n\n\"Ghost preparers\"\n\nThe IRS also warns to be wary of who you hire to prepare your taxes.\n\nScam preparers set up fake websites to steal your information. In other cases, the agency says so-called \"ghost preparers\" refuse to sign or include their IRS Preparer Tax Identification Number (PTIN) as required by law. These fake preparers will often collect a fee and then leave you on the hook for fraudulent or incorrect returns.\n\nYou should always ask for a preparer's PTIN up front and use the IRS.gov website to find preparers in your area who currently hold professional credentials recognized by the IRS.\n\nBad social media advice\n\nThe IRS, again, cautioned against taking tax advice from TikTok or other social media platforms.\n\nAs CBS News Philadelphia previously reported, inaccurate and misleading advice has led to an uptick in wrongful claims in recent years, according to the agency.\n\n\"Social media platforms routinely circulate inaccurate or misleading tax information, including on TikTok where people share wildly inaccurate tax advice,\" the IRS stated.\n\nClaiming ineligible credits could lead to fines and delay legitimately owed refunds.\n\nOne piece of advice that continues to circulate is about a non-existent \"Self-Employment Tax Credit\" that's misleading taxpayers into filing false claims, according to the IRS.\n\nPromoters market it as a way for self-employed people and gig workers to get big payments for the COVID-19 pandemic period when in reality, the underlying credit being referred to is a much more limited and technical credit called the Credits for Sick Leave and Family Leave.\n\nDo you have a money question, a consumer issue, or a scam story you want to share?

        "source": "https://www.cbsnews.com/philadelphia/",
        "content": "Health officials in Philadelphia are warning residents about potential exposures to the highly infectious measles virus at multiple health facilities in the city over the past week.\n\nThe child who has the virus was at the following locations in the city at these times, according to the Philadelphia Department of Public Health:\n\nThe South Philadelphia Health and Literacy Center, 1700 South Broad Street. The building includes the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia's Pediatric Primary Care unit in South Philadelphia, the health department's Health Center No. 2 and the South Philadelphia library, but no one in the library is at risk.\n\nThe person was in that building on Friday, March 7, between 10:45 a.m. and 2:40 p.m. The next day on March 8, the person was there between 9:05 a.m. and 1:20 p.m.\n\nThe CHOP emergency room at 3401 Civic Center Boulevard on Monday, March 10 between 7:55 a.m. and 10:15 a.m.\n\nThe person was exposed to measles while traveling abroad, and officials do not believe the case is connected to a recent one that occurred in Montgomery County.\n\nThe patient who has measles is an 11-month-old who was too young to be vaccinated. The baby was first seen at CHOP's South Philadelphia Center. The child didn't have obvious signs of measles until later going to the main emergency department.\n\n\"After this child developed that measles rash, which is much more indicative of it being measles, ended up going to the emergency department and that's where that child got diagnosed,\" Gayle Mendoza with the city's health department said.\n\nMendoza said the health department is now doing contact tracing.\n\n\"Measles is incredibly contagious and really does linger in the air,\" Mendoza said. \"So, after somebody leaves a room, that virus stays there for another two hours afterward. So that exposure time isn't just when that child is in space, it also accounts for two hours afterwards.\"\n\nMendoza said the child is being treated with vitamin A.\n\n\"It's only given to kids who are severely ill, which means they're hospitalized, in order to prevent them from dying ultimately,\" Mendoza said. \"That's what the vitamin A has been shown to be helpful for, and that this child is receiving.\"\n\nMendoza emphasized that vitamin A is only a treatment and does not prevent measles.\n\nPhiladelphia Health Commissioner Dr. Palak Raval-Nelson said she is not concerned about a threat to the general public. Still, the spread of measles is a concern for people who are not protected against the virus or cannot be.\n\n\"As vaccination rates across the country continue to drop, there are more and more opportunities for people who cannot be vaccinated to be exposed to this deadly disease. That's why it is critical for everyone who needs to be protected from measles to get vaccinated as soon as possible,\" Raval-Nelson said in a news release.\n\nMeasles is an easily transmitted virus that can spread through respiratory droplets. Symptoms include a fever, runny nose, cough and puffy eyes. A rash usually develops a few days after symptoms start, according to the CDC.\n\n\"People who are not protected from measles but are exposed should quarantine, or stay at home away from others, for 21 days after the exposure. If someone who is quarantining due to measles must go out, they should wear a mask the entire time they are out. Wearing a mask won't completely prevent spread, but it will help lower the chances of them spreading measles to others,\" Raval-Nelson said.\n\n\"If you are protected from measles, you do not have to do anything. Measles vaccine is extremely effective at preventing measles,\" her department said in the release.\n\nDr. Paul Offit, CHOP's director of vaccine education, expects measles cases to continue to increase because of to vaccine skepticism.\n\n\"This is a highly contagious virus, and I don't think people realize how sick it can make you,\" Offit said.\n\nPeople who aren't vaccinated against measles and may have been exposed are advised to call their health care provider. Doctors say that while the first dose of the vaccine isn't usually given until babies are 12 months old, it can be done earlier if they are traveling internationally or to locations where there is an outbreak.",

        "source": "https://www.cbsnews.com/philadelphia/",
        "content": "New England Patriots make some big splashes on Day 1 of NFL free agency, but needs remain New England Patriots make some big splashes on Day 1 of NFL free agency, but needs remain 10:46\n\nMilton Williams is a big man with a big contract, and he has big plans for the New England Patriots defense.\n\nThe Patriots introduced the defensive lineman to New England on Thursday, as the team welcomed in four of its signings from the first week of NFL free agency. Williams was the biggest splash of them all, after the team gave him to a massive $104 million contract on Monday.\n\nFresh off a Super Bowl title with the Philadelphia Eagles, Williams is now looking to anchor a New England defensive line that needed to bulk up this offseason. The 6-foot-3, 290-pound defensive tackle should shore up a the Patriots leaky run defense and will also get after opposing quarterbacks.\n\n\"I just want to be known for doing it all, versatile, a Swiss Army knife,\" Williams told reporters inside Gillette Stadium on Thursday. \"Line up anywhere and be productive from any spot, run, pass. If I've got to drop in coverage, I feel like I can do that. Wherever they need me to be, whatever they need me to do, I'm ready for the challenge.\"\n\nWilliams was a monster for the Philadelphia defense last season, recording 40 total pressures and five sacks in his limited role. He was a wrecking ball on the biggest stage too, when the Eagles sacked Patrick Mahomes six times in the team's Super Bowl LIX victory. Williams was responsible for two of those sacks, and also had a strip-sack of Mahomes early in the fourth quarter.\n\nHe sees the banners hanging at Gillette Stadium and is eager to relive that same glory during his time in New England. The pressure of living up to that big contract only adds to his desire to turn up the heat on opposing quarterbacks.\n\nWhy did Milton Williams pick the Patriots?\n\nBefore news broke that Williams was signing with the Patriots, it was reported he was close to a deal with the Carolina Panthers. Either team is a bit of a downgrade from the Super Bowl champs, as the Patriots won just four games last season and the Panthers only five.\n\nThe massive contract the Patriots offered Williams certainly helped him make his decision. In terms of average annual value, he's now the highest-paid Patriot ever.\n\nBut that big payday showed Williams how much the Patriots wanted to bring him aboard, and Williams is determined to live up to his contract.\n\n\"That's a blessing, man. I just won the Super Bowl a couple weeks ago, so I thought that was the biggest day of my life, but this is probably going to jump that for sure,\" he said of being the highest-paid Patriots player. \"That's big, man. They believed in me. Obviously they studied me as a player and as a person. They know what I bring to the table, physicality, toughness, determination, and I thrive on people telling me I can't do something. Bring it on.\"\n\nPatriots head coach Mike Vrabel can't wait to let Williams loose in the New England defense.\n\n\"When you look at compensation, it's the body of work, it's what they're going to do for us. We always want to be able to not rely on past performances, but that was something -- there was a high ceiling and a great vision about the person, the effort, the skill set, the speed in which he plays. There's a power,\" Vrabel said of Williams' skillset on Thursday. \"Certainly there's an aggressiveness, and being able to add him to our defensive line was something that was really exciting.\"\n\nDuring his time at the podium, Vrabel turned to Williams and said the Patriots plan to play him a lot more than he did in Philadelphia, when he played just 48 percent of the Eagles defensive snaps last season. That low percentage was the product of Williams being in a defensive line rotation with the Eagles.\n\nWilliams confidently said he's up to Vrabel's challenge on Thursday.\n\n\"Definitely. The more you're out there, the more opportunity you've got to make plays. I pride myself on being productive on wherever I line up on the defensive line, and I'm going to bring that here,\" he said.\n\nWilliams isn't worried about a bigger workload. He said his work ethic will help him handle the increase in snaps.\n\n\"Putting in work. Plain and simple. Extra work. Asking the coaches whatever I need to do to make sure I'm available for every game, like you said, Sunday, Monday, Thursday. I want to be out there.

The system includes Crozer-Chester Medical Center, Taylor Hospital and other facilities.\n\nAttorneys for Prospect appeared in bankruptcy court in Texas last week and warned that the entire system could be shut down. Then, on Sunday, Attorney General Dave Sunday and The Foundation for Delaware County announced a commitment of \"essential funding\" that would keep Crozer afloat.\n\nCBS News Philadelphia virtually attended another bankruptcy hearing on Tuesday.\n\nProspect's attorney and one from Sunday's office discussed the several hours of work to reach the essential funding deal.\n\nThe Prospect attorney said \"everyone in the room on Sunday was overwhelmingly committed to continue doing health care in Delaware County.\"\n\nThe judge said she breathed a sigh of relief, but she had questions about the possibility of getting a long-term deal done. Every attorney answered that hard work is happening behind the scenes.\n\n\"We were all looking for a hero in this, sounds like we have a few heroes,\" Chief Judge Stacey Jernigan said. \"Thanks and kudos to everyone who is working hard to find a long-term solution to avoid an abrupt closure.\"\n\nBut now the question: what happens after two weeks?\n\nPennsylvania government sources say the amount of money put up by the foundation covers a single payroll cycle. A foundation attorney says his side is committed to a long-term fix as well.\n\n\"We would not have been part of a short-term solution if there wasn't a prospect of a long-term solution ... our purpose is to serve health care in Delaware County. We are engaged,\" an attorney for the foundation told the judge.\n\nLawmakers say negotiations have been underway with other regional health care providers to come in and rescue the Crozer Health system. But sources say the system's financial condition makes that idea unattractive for the other health care entities in the region.\n\n\"All of the hospitals around us will feel the pain if Crozer closes, especially if it's a disorderly closure, which is what we've been trying to prevent,\" said state Rep. Leanne Krueger, whose district includes Crozer-Chester. \"So in the meantime, we've been expecting this could happen for quite a while because this isn't the first time Prospect has threatened a closure, they have been doing this for months.\"\n\nWorkers rallied outside Crozer-Chester Medical Center Tuesday afternoon, calling for a long-term plan to keep the hospital open. More than 3,000 jobs hang in the balance.\n\nLast month, the system was removed from Prospect Medical Holdings and placed into receivership. Delaware County and Pennsylvania provided $20 million at that time to keep the system running. Most of that money is gone.\n\nAnother hearing in Texas bankruptcy court is scheduled for March 26.\n\nA spokesperson for Main Line Health, which operates hospitals and and other health facilities around the region, said patients are coming to its locations \"in increasing numbers\" because of the instability in the Crozer system.",

Through their motion, attorneys argued that continued operations of the Crozer system beyond March 14 would create \"overarching risk\" for Prospect hospitals in other states.\n\nThe judge has not ruled on the motion.\n\nThe Sunday meeting of parties in Harrisburg has been ordered by the court in an attempt to rescue the health system. Sources on Saturday said logistical details of the meeting were still being finalized. Numerous spokespersons for various government agencies expected at the table declined to say where the meeting might be held.\n\nOn Friday, first responders were still wheeling patients into Crozer Chester Medical Center. At one point, the ambulance bay was nearly full.\n\nCBS News Philadelphia\n\nAnna Velardi, who lives in Prospect Park, was picking up her daughter.\n\n\"I'm concerned,\" she said. \"Because I've been here for many of my operations. It's been nothing but great care for us.\"\n\nAttorneys for the Crozer Health system dropped a bombshell Thursday morning, informing the bankruptcy judge overseeing the case that there was no other option but to shut down facilities across Delaware County because they're nearly out of money. The shutdown would include Crozer's remaining hospitals and other clinical locations in Broomall, Media, Glen Mills and Haverford. The final say rests with the bankruptcy court judge.\n\nEmergency Department Doctor Max Cooper invited CBS News Philadelphia into his office at Crozer Chester on Friday. He said he and his colleagues are trying to stay strong.\n\n\"So everyone's blood is absolutely boiling for this catastrophe,\" Cooper said. \"I would do anything to keep this hospital open. I want to spend my entire career here and I just feel like it's being ripped away from us.\"\n\nAttorneys for Prospect Medical Holdings are asking the bankruptcy judge to authorize an \"expedited\" closure. Four days before such a closure, the proposed plan shows the emergency department would shut down, EMS services and elective surgeries would stop, and all patients would be discharged or transferred.\n\nMeanwhile, Cooper is holding out hope and reflecting on his time at Crozer Chester.\n\n\"This is the uniform of medicine,\" he said while looking at his white coat. \"And the house of medicine really wants to be here and we really want to care for this community.\"\n\nCBS News Philadelphia\n\nA spokesperson local to Crozer Health did not return messages seeking comment.

        "source": "https://www.cbsnews.com/philadelphia/",
        "content": "Former heart surgeon and television host Dr. Mehmet Oz testified Friday before the Senate Finance Committee over his nomination to head the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services under President Trump.\n\nThe GOP-led committee will next schedule a vote on whether to send Oz's nomination to the full Senate, where he is likely to be approved given the Republican majority.\n\nIf confirmed, Oz would be the administrator charged with overseeing the nearly $1.5 trillion spent by the federal government on Medicare and Medicaid. The two health insurance programs for seniors and poor Americans make up more than a third of the budget.\n\nMedicare covers around 65 million people, through programs run directly by the federal government or contracted out to private insurers. Medicaid supports around 85 million, through programs administered primarily by state governments overseen by CMS.\n\nCMS also sets rules that affect private health insurance, including overseeing the Affordable Care Act's health insurance marketplaces.\n\nOz previously worked as a professor of cardiac surgery at Columbia University and host of \"The Dr. Oz Show\" until 2022, when he stopped taping new television episodes to run for a Senate seat in Pennsylvania. He lost that Senate race to Democrat John Fetterman, in a narrow contest where abortion had ranked as a top issue for voters.\n\nOz's priorities for Medicare and Medicaid\n\nOz outlined a vision for the agency focused in large part on modernizing its systems and tools, addressing waste and fraud and incentivizing Americans to make healthier lifestyle choices.\n\n\"Some of these decisions are not difficult. Some of them need to be simplified. And some of them need to be reminded frequently,\" Oz told senators of the healthier lifestyle choices he wants to encourage, adding later that \"the idea of giving incentives to patients is an idea that I think is a worthy one, especially for Medicaid beneficiaries.\"\n\nIt will be up to Oz to finalize or abandon some major changes to Medicare and Medicaid sought by the Biden administration, like a pricey proposal in November to expand coverage to drugs used for weight loss like Wegovy and Ozempic.\n\nOz did not directly address the proposal during the hearing. But he did promise to continue the Medicare drug price negotiation program launched by the Biden administration, from the Inflation Reduction Act.\n\n\"It's the law. I'm going to defend it and use it,\" Oz told senators.\n\nHe also voiced support for allowing states to add work requirements in Medicaid. Oz also said he wants work requirements to be defined broadly, to include activities like going to school or volunteering at a church.\n\n\"I don't think you need to use paperwork to prove a work requirement. And I don't think that should be used as an obstacle, a disingenuous effort to block people from getting on Medicaid,\" he said.\n\nOz criticizes Medicare Advantage\n\nDuring Friday's hearing, Oz singled out Medicare Advantage as one of the biggest sources of waste and abuse within the insurance industry.\n\nJust over half of seniors have opted for these plans offered by private insurers but paid for by taxpayers, according to the latest federal data, instead of \"original Medicare\" coverage.\n\nHe cited reports showing spending on the private alternatives outpacing traditional Medicare coverage as \"upside down\" what it should be, questioning spending by plans and efforts by brokers to persuade seniors to sign up.\n\nHe also criticized the practice of \"upcoding\" within Medicare Advantage, where providers or plans bill for treating patients as sicker than they actually are.\n\n\"A part of this is just recognizing there's a new sheriff in town. We actually have to go after places and areas where we're not managing the American people's money well,\" Oz said.\n\nOz calls for limiting prior authorization\n\nOz also faced questions over the significant authority he would wield over private health insurance.\n\nOn Monday, CMS proposed making several moves to reverse Biden administration expansions to the insurance marketplace created by the Affordable Care Act, like shortening the open enrollment period and excluding DACA recipients from coverage. In 2022, Oz said that the law \"caused havoc on our health care system\" and that he \"wouldn't have voted for it.\"\n\nDuring the hearing, Oz criticized health insurance companies misusing prior authorization - sometimes delaying treatment until doctors and patients can persuade insurers that it is necessary - as \"a pox on the system.\"\n\n\"We're spending money, wasting money, trying to do a process that should be automated. I would argue we could limit the number of preauthorized procedures to a thousand,\" he told senators.\n\nRepublicans optimistic Oz will be confirmed\n\nIn social media posts last month, Oz has touted \"great conversations\" with key Republicans he would need to win over for his nomination. Multiple Republicans at Friday's hearing said they were optimistic Oz would be confirmed.\n\nSen. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, the Republican chair of the Senate's health committee, was among those to sit down with Oz last month. Cassidy is one of four medical doctors in the Senate.\n\n\"Great meeting with Dr. Mehmet Oz, President Trump's nominee to lead the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. It will be great to have a doctor in charge,\" Cassidy posted on Feb. 5.\n\nOz was the fourth of Trump's health official picks to face questioning from senators. It comes a day after a hearing for Dr. David Weldon was abruptly canceled, after the White House withdrew his nomination to head the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nA majority of senators on the Senate's health committee advanced Dr. Jay Bhattacharya, the president's nominee to head the National Institutes of Health, and Dr. Marty Makary, the pick to head the Food and Drug Administration, on Thursday.\n\nOz's potential new supervisor, Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr., was narrowly confirmed by the Senate a month ago.\n\nDemocrats criticized Oz's past\n\nSen. Ron Wyden of Oregon, the top Democrat on committee, during the hearing accused Oz of \"dodging Medicare and Social Security taxes.\" Wyden said a tax loophole has \"benefited Dr. Oz by $440,000 in the last three years.\"\n\nDuring the hearing, Oz did not respond to the allegation. A memo from the committee's Democratic staff had concluded that Oz may have underpaid his taxes based on a questionairre he submitted, his tax returns and financial disclosures.\n\n\"Now, the doctor will testify about his concern for Medicare's well being, yet he is unwilling to pay the same taxes that millions of Americans pay out of every paycheck,\" Wyden said.\n\nThe president's pick to head CMS has earned criticism from some Senate Democrats for months, who have cited Oz's past embrace of \"alarming pseudoscience,\" record of anti-abortion statements and worries over conflicts of interest.\n\nAs part of an ethics agreement published last month, Oz said he will resign from positions at several companies, including the nutritional supplement company iHerb and the drugmaker Housey Pharma. He also pledged to divest from several healthcare companies, including insurance giant UnitedHealth Group.\n\nAfter the Senate race, Oz had been advertised as iHerb's global advisor. He continued to promote iHerb's supplements on social media after his nomination.\n\nHe has also continued to republish past excerpts from his show in recent years after the Senate race, like a clip he shared on Sept. 4 from a sponsored interview about Medicare Advantage coverage.
