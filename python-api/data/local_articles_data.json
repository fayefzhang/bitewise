        "fullContent": "“Captain America: Brave New World” infused some blockbuster cash into the North American box office, bringing in $88.5 million in ticket sales over the weekend, according to studio estimates Sunday. The Walt Disney Co. release is by far the biggest opener of 2025 and the company predicts it will hit $100 million domestically and $192.4 globally by the end of Monday's Presidents' Day holiday.\n\nIt’s Marvel's first major release since “Deadpool & Wolverine” broke records last summer and re-energized a Marvel fanbase that some worried was weakening after the poor showing for “The Marvels.”\n\nPlaying in 4,105 locations in the U.S. and Canada, “Brave New World” is also a major transition for the “Captain America” brand: Anointing Anthony Mackie’s Sam Wilson as the new Cap, officially taking over from Chris Evans, who played the character for almost a decade. Harrison Ford co-stars as the U.S. President who transforms into the Red Hulk.\n\nBut “Brave New World,” directed by Julius Onah, had a bit of a handicap going into the weekend: Poor reviews, though superhero movies can soar without the stamp of approval from critics. The film is currently sitting at 51% “rotten” on Rotten Tomatoes. It's not the worst in the Marvel Cinematic Universe — “Eternals” has a 47% rating and “Ant-Man and The Wasp: Quantumania” has a 46% — but the latest film is definitely on the very low end of the spectrum.\n\nGet top local stories in Philly delivered to you every morning. Sign up for NBC Philadelphia's News Headlines newsletter.\n\nIn his review for The Associated Press, Mark Kennedy wrote that it is, “a highly processed, empty calorie, regret-later candy of a movie.”\n\nAudiences were more generous in their opinions. The “verified audience score” from Rotten Tomatoes was 80% and its CinemaScore was a B-. Exit polls showed that men made up 63% of the opening weekend audience.\n\nThe bar for biggest opening of the year wasn’t terribly high: “Dog Man” held the title for two weeks with its $36 million launch.\n\nAnd “Brave New World's” showing is the middle range for an MCU film. Not accounting for inflation, it sits between “Guardians of the Galaxy” and “Thor: The Dark World.”\n\nIt also cost significantly less than many of the big budget Marvel movies, with a reported production price tag of $180 million, excluding the millions spent on marketing and promotion.\n\nAfter only one Marvel movie in 2024, “Brave New World” is the first of three major theatrical releases set for 2025. It is to be followed by “Thunderbolts(asterisk)” in May and “The Fantastic Four: First Steps” in July.\n\n“The superhero genre has taken a hit over the past few years, but audiences still have a huge interest in seeing them on the big screen,” said Paul Dergarabedian, the senior media analyst for Comscore.\n\nSecond place at this week's box office went to “Paddington in Peru,” the third installment in the beloved franchise, which finally opened in North America this weekend. Released by Sony, it earned an estimated $13 million and should hit $16 million by Monday. The StudioCanal film opened in the United Kingdom in early November 2024 and went into the weekend with $104 million from its international run.\n\nDougal Wilson took over directing duties for Paul King for this film, which also recast Emily Mortimer as Mrs. Brown, originally played by Sally Hawkins. The other main cast, including Ben Whishaw as Paddinton's voice, remained intact.\n\nSony and Screen Gems' slasher “Heart Eyes” landed in third place with $10 million, up 20% from its opening last weekend. Fourth place went to “Dog Man\" with $9.7 million.\n\nThe Chinese blockbuster “Ne Zha 2\" rounded out the top five. It opened on 660 screens in North America and made $7.2 million. Overall, the box office is up 20% from last year.\n\nThis weekend also saw the release of a new “Bridget Jones\" movie, subtitled “Mad About the Boy,” which went straight to Universal’s streaming service Peacock, forgoing theaters in the U.S. In the U.K. and Ireland it made an estimated $14.9 million, outgrossing “Captain America: Brave New World.\" Universal Pictures International reported $32.3 million in grosses from all 70 territories.\n\nFinal domestic figures will be released Tuesday. Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Comscore:\n\n1. “Captain America: Brave New World,” $88.5 million.\n\n2. “Paddington in Peru,” $13 million.\n\n3. “Heart Eyes,” $10 million.\n\n4. “Dog Man,” $9.7 million.\n\n5. “Ne Zha 2,” $7.2 million.\n\n6. “Love Hurts,” $4.4 million.\n\n7. “Mufasa: The Lion King,” $4.2 million.\n\n8. “One of Them Days,” $3 million.\n\n9. “Companion,” $1.9 million.\n\n10. “Becoming Led Zeppelin,” $1.8 million.",

        "source": "https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/",
        "fullContent": "White House border czar Tom Homan on Sunday denied allegations of a quid pro quo between the Trump administration and New York Mayor Eric Adams, calling the notion that the Justice Department moved to dismiss criminal charges against Adams in exchange for the mayor’s cooperation on immigration “ridiculous.”\n\nCNN anchor Dana Bash asked Homan, “It sounds like the DOJ dropped the case against Adams and, in exchange, he let you into Rikers,” referring to the New York City jail. “Is that what happened?”\n\n“No, I think that’s ridiculous,” Homan replied, saying the two have been discussing access to the Rikers Island jail for months.\n\nDuring a closed-door meeting with Homan on Thursday, Adams agreed to allow U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents to operate at Rikers.\n\nGet top local stories in Philly delivered to you every morning. Sign up for NBC Philadelphia's News Headlines newsletter.\n\nThe two men then sat for an interview with “Fox & Friends” on Friday, during which Homan said, “I came to New York City and I wasn’t going to leave with nothing,” adding he would be on Adams’ case and “be in his office, up his butt,” if the mayor did not follow through with his commitment.\n\nHoman, who served as acting ICE director in President Donald Trump’s first administration, said Sunday that the conversation between him and Adams — a former New York City police captain — was “cop to cop.”\n\n“I just think people are making a lot about nothing,” Homan said. “I mean, again, I went up there as the ICE director, now the border czar, and we collaborated on how to move illegal alien crime, decrease it down in New York City, and find the worst of the worst. And that’s what we talked about. It was cop to cop, not border czar to mayor, cop to cop.”\n\nThe Justice Department moved to dismiss corruption charges against Adams on Friday, following an internal mutiny that included a wave of resignations over the department’s handling of Adams’ case.\n\nAt least seven DOJ officials have resigned as part of the fallout of Adams’ legal saga, including Danielle R. Sassoon, who was the top federal prosecutor in Manhattan. Acting Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove ordered U.S. prosecutors in New York to dismiss the charges against Adams, arguing in part that the case was interfering with Adams’ ability to help the administration tackle illegal immigration.\n\nSassoon, a conservative who clerked for the late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, resigned in a sharply worded memo to Attorney General Pam Bondi, which said that during a Jan. 31 meeting with Bove and Adams’ lawyers, “Adams’s attorneys repeatedly urged what amounted to a quid pro quo, indicating that Adams would be in a position to assist with Department’s enforcement priorities only if the indictment were dismissed.”\n\nAdams, who was elected mayor in 2021 and is up for re-election in November, was indicted last year on bribery and fraud charges and had been facing trial in April.\n\nAdams has pleaded not guilty and has insisted he is innocent and the charges are politically motivated. Adams and his lawyer, Alex Spiro, vehemently denied any quid pro quo offered in the Jan. 31 meeting.\n\nThis article originally appeared on NBCNews.com. Read more from NBC News:",

        "fullContent": "Secretary of State Marco Rubio, national security adviser Mike Waltz and special envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoff are headed to Saudi Arabia to initiate negotiations toward peace between Russia and Ukraine, two sources familiar with the matter told NBC News.\n\nThe timing of the travel was not specified, and it is unclear whether the trio have already departed.\n\nThe move comes just days after President Donald Trump said he spoke by phone with Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy about the prospect of beginning negotiations to end the war.\n\n“We agreed to work together, very closely, including visiting each other’s Nations,” Trump wrote in a Truth Social post Wednesday after the call. “We have also agreed to have our respective teams start negotiations immediately.”\n\nGet top local stories in Philly delivered to you every morning. Sign up for NBC Philadelphia's News Headlines newsletter.\n\nSenior Trump administration officials, including Vice President JD Vance, Rubio and U.S. special envoy to Ukraine Keith Kellogg, have been huddling in Germany this weekend for the Munich Security Conference, a forum for international security policy where the Russia-Ukraine war remains a critical topic of discussion.\n\nRubio spoke by phone with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov on Saturday. Their discussion included the war in Ukraine and other topics, according to readouts of the call from both countries.\n\nDuring a speech at the security conference Saturday, Zelenskyy said Ukraine must be involved with any negotiations to end the war.\n\n\"Ukraine will never accept deals made behind our backs,\" he said. \"No decisions about Ukraine without Ukraine, no decisions about Europe without Europe.\"\n\nDuring a panel discussion Saturday on the sidelines of the conference, Kellogg said that “of course” Ukrainians would be at the table in discussions to end the war. However, he said “the answer is no” when asked whether he could assure Europeans that they too would have a seat at the table.\n\n“When you sit at the table, there’s really, there’s two protagonists when you look at it, and there’s one, hopefully it’ll be an intermediary,” Kellogg added. When the moderator asked for clarification, he indicated that Ukrainians, Russians and Americans would be “at the table talking.”\n\nHe later said that a group not being at the table “doesn’t mean the interests are not taking a part of, they’re not considered, they’re not used, they’re not developed.”\n\nKellogg on Saturday defended the prospect of engaging with Putin in an effort to achieve peace between Russia and Ukraine, saying in Munich, “Whether you like it or not, you have to talk to adversaries.”\n\n“As a great secretary of defense, Gen. Mattis, once said: I may not like this son of a b----, but I got to talk to him,” he added.\n\nKellogg also said that Western leaders need to do more to enforce sanctions against Russia, adding that negotiations about ending the war could focus on Russia’s willingness to cede territory and targeting Putin’s oil revenue.\n\nBut some members of the administration have seemed reluctant in recent days to specify any particular concessions from Russia ahead of potential negotiations.\n\nAsked Thursday what Russia should give up in order to reach a deal with Ukraine, Trump declined to name specifics.\n\n“As far as the negotiation, it’s too early to say what’s going to happen. Maybe Russia will give up a lot, maybe they won’t, and it’s all dependent on what is going to happen,” Trump said during a news conference alongside Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.\n\nDefense Secretary Pete Hegseth, who has signaled the U.S. would be opposed to Ukraine joining NATO as part of a negotiated peace, indicated that the U.S. is likely to support negotiations in which Ukraine cedes territory that’s already been seized by the Kremlin.\n\n“We want, like you, a sovereign and prosperous Ukraine. But we must start by recognizing that returning to Ukraine’s pre-2014 borders is an unrealistic objective,” Hegseth said in a speech during a trip to NATO’s headquarters in Brussels on Wednesday.\n\nAbigail Williams, Nnamdi Egwuonwu and Megan Lebowitz contributed.\n\nThis article first appeared on NBCNews.com.

        "fullContent": "The mineral ilmenite is extracted from mounds of sand deep in the earth and refined using a method that summons the force of gravity, resulting in a substance that glimmers like a moonlit sky.\n\nUkraine boasts vast reserves of ilmenite — a key element used to produce titanium — in the heavy mineral sands that stretch for miles along the country’s embattled east.\n\nMuch of it, as with all of Ukraine’s critical minerals industry, is underdeveloped because of war as well as onerous state policies.\n\nThat is poised to change if U.S. President Donald Trump's administration agrees to a deal with Ukraine to exchange critical minerals for continued American military aid.\n\nGet top local stories in Philly delivered to you every morning. Sign up for NBC Philadelphia's News Headlines newsletter.\n\nIn the central region of Kirovohrad, the ilmenite open-pit mine is a canyon of precious deposits that its owner is keen to develop with U.S. companies. But many unknowns stand in the way of turning these riches into profit: cost, licensing terms and whether such a deal will be underpinned by security guarantees.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Saturday at the Munich Security Conference that he did not permit his ministers to sign a mineral resource agreement with the U.S. because the current version is not “ready to protect us, our interests.\"\n\nUkrainian businessmen with knowledge of the minerals industry also privately expressed skepticism about whether a deal is viable. The capital-intensive industry is unlikely to yield results in years, if not decades, as geological data is either limited or classified. Many question what conditions American companies are willing to risk to build up the industry and whether existing Ukrainian policies that have so far deterred local businessmen will accommodate foreign investors.\n\n“The main thing we can gain is certain security guarantees obtained through economic means, so that someone stronger than us has an interest in protecting us,” said Andriy Brodsky, CEO of Velta, a leading titanium mining company in Ukraine.\n\nThe question of security guarantees\n\nA deal, which would essentially barter one resource for another, could help strengthen Kyiv’s relationship with the Trump administration.\n\nThe United States is a major consumer of critical raw earth minerals such as lithium and gallium, two elements that Ukraine has in proven reserves. Trump has specifically mentioned rare earth elements, but these are not well researched, industry experts told The Associated Press.\n\nTitanium, used in aerospace, defense and industry, is also high in demand and the U.S. is a leading importer of ilmenite. Sourcing the minerals from Ukraine would reduce future reliance on Russia and China.\n\nIn exchange, Kyiv would continue to receive a steady stream of American weaponry that offers leverage against Moscow and without which Ukraine cannot ward off future Russian aggression in the event of a ceasefire.\n\nThe question of security guarantees is a sticking point for companies, Ukrainian businessmen and analysts said. A senior Ukrainian official, speaking anonymously to describe private conversations, told the AP that U.S. companies expressed interest in investing but needed to ensure their billions will be safeguarded in the event of renewed conflict. But once invested in Ukraine, the presence of American business interests alone might act as a guarantee, Brodsky said.\n\n“If this process starts, it will continue,” Brodsky said. “Once the investment figures exceed hundreds of billions, the Americans, a highly pragmatic people, will protect their profits earned on Ukrainian soil. They will defend their interests against Russia, China, Korea, Iran and anyone else. They will protect what they consider theirs.”\n\nGrowing American interest\n\nBrodsky, who just returned from a trip to Washington and New York, said the conversation among U.S. businesses is changing in Kyiv’s favor.\n\n“A lot of people in very serious and wealthy offices are saying that now, we — our country and my company — are in the right place and doing exactly what needs to be done at this moment,” he said.\n\nVelta has worked with American partners for many years. Brodsky has begun negotiating with companies he believes could be a partner in the event of a deal.\n\nUkraine has never been attractive to foreign investors because of prohibitive government policies — not offering incentives to attract foreigners, for instance. Brodsky believes that international companies will need to pair up with local partners to flourish.\n\nAmerican companies have several ways to enter the market, explained Ksenia Orynchak, director of the National Association of Extractive Industries of Ukraine, but would require traversing “certain circles of hell” in Ukraine's bureaucracy. Teaming up with an existing Ukrainian license owner is possibly the most straightforward.\n\nU.S. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth told the Ukraine Defense Contact Group that the Russia-Ukraine war \"must end\" but said that returning Ukraine to its pre-2014 borders was an \"unrealistic objective.\"\n\nShe said more exploration is needed in the field and hinted existing data may have been acquired through ulterior motives. Under the Soviet system, geologists stood to gain if they claimed to have found large reserves.\n\n“Someone did it so that Moscow would praise Ukrainian geologists or Soviet geologists,” she said.\n\nShe advises American investors to lower existing thresholds for exploration because bidding can take place in areas where reserves are only presumed, not proven.\n\n“I believe, and so does the expert community, that this is not right. In fact, we are selling a pig in a poke,” she said.\n\nA historically untapped sector\n\nAt the extraction site, the air is dense with ilmenite dust. When the afternoon sun’s rays pierce the darkened space, they sparkle and dance in the air. The soot covers the faces of workers who spend hours inside every day extracting the precious material from sand.\n\nThe gravity separation method removes unwanted elements in the ore and water separated from the mineral rains down through metal-lined floors. Workers are used to getting wet and don’t bat an eye. Titanium is developed from the purified ilmenite at a different facility.\n\nVelta began in the form of an expired license for geological exploration and a business plan for $7 million when Brodsky acquired the company. It would be eight years and many millions more invested before he could even think about production capacity.\n\nThe deal also does not factor in a crucial element that could prove challenging later: The position of Ukrainian people themselves. According to the Constitution, the subsoil where extraction would take place belongs to Ukraine.\n\n“I am very afraid that they (Ukrainian people) already had disapproving reviews, that everything is being given away. Who allowed him? He had no right? And so on,” Orynchak said.\n\nThose sensitivities were echoed among workers at the Velta mine. Speaking anonymously to voice his true thoughts, one said: “If you have a vegetable garden in your home, do you invite a foreigner to take it?”\n\nThe high risk often is a key reason that some Ukrainian businessmen privately express skepticism about the deal.\n\nWhen one businessman of a major group of companies heard about the arms-for-minerals deal, his first impression was: “This is just hot air,” he said, speaking on condition of anonymity to speak freely about his thoughts. “This is a very capital intensive industry. Just to take ground from an open pit will cost you billions. Not millions, billions.”\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press journalists Kwiyeon Ha in London and Volodymyr Yurchuk contributed.

        "fullContent": "The DEI practices of corporations are already facing intense scrutiny from the Trump administration, from minority hiring to supplier diversity goals.\n\nMany major companies have abandoned or at least scaled back DEI programs, from Amazon to McDonald's, Alphabet, Target, Ford, Lowe's and Walmart.\n\nCorporate charity arms will be scrutinized, too, such as big pledges made by big firms to invest in themes including racial equity, and possibly even at the level of employee charitable donation matching programs.\n\nAs more companies scrap or pare back DEI pledges and goals related to hiring and supplier diversity, from Amazon to Target and Meta, corporate philanthropic activities are also ripe for review.\n\nCompanies routinely support DEI initiatives through foundations or other corporate giving programs. According to a new survey by The Conference Board, changes among corporate philanthropy leaders are already underway to reflect the new political reality and intense focus from the Trump administration on DEI practices within both the government and business world.\n\nMore corporate charity arms plan to ramp up company efforts around economic opportunity and education. Simultaneously, they foresee scaling back initiatives around racial and gender equality, which became a larger focus in recent years and in particular after the murder of George Floyd. JPMorgan Chase, for example, launched a $30 billion racial equity program that involved its charitable giving programs, among many other parts of the bank.\n\nGet top local stories in Philly delivered to you every morning. Sign up for NBC Philadelphia's News Headlines newsletter.\n\nCorporates are free to fund who they want, as long as it's not illegal, but they are under pressure, said Andrew Jones, author of the report and senior ESG researcher at The Conference Board. \"None of them wants to be the one attacked by the federal government\" or activists or others, he said. \"That's a major source of reputational risk to companies.\"\n\nThere are many ways that companies' philanthropic efforts could be impacted by recent political and legal developments, and the conversations are starting to take place, even though companies' philanthropic practices haven't been the main area of focus in the wake of President Trump's executive orders relating to the private sector's DEI initiatives.\n\n\"Companies are still, by and large, playing catch up and getting their arms around\" how the orders apply to their core business, and \"the steps they need to take, if any, to modify historical business practices,\" said Michael R. Littenberg, a partner at law firm Ropes & Gray, and global head of the firm's ESG, corporate social responsibility and business and human rights compliance practice.\n\nHowever, companies have started to expand their thinking into the potential impacts on corporate giving and philanthropic efforts. Companies are asking, \"how can we succeed without being sued?\" said Christen Graham, founder and president of Giving Strong, a consulting firm that advises corporations, foundations and nonprofits on corporate social responsibility and philanthropy.\n\nCompanies need to tread carefully. Many legal challenges to DEI-related policies have been brought in the wake of the U.S. Supreme Court's landmark ruling in 2023 that affirmative action in college admissions is unconstitutional, and the scrutiny is intensifying with executive orders from the new Trump administration targeting DEI.\n\nLast year, the American Alliance for Equal Rights, headed by conservative activist Edward Blum, sued Fearless Fund, which invests in under-resourced entrepreneurs including women of color-led businesses. At issue was a particular grant contest that awarded grants to Black women-owned small businesses, which American Alliance claimed was a violation of federal civil rights law. The parties settled the case in September with Fearless agreeing to permanently close the grant program.\n\nIn January, American Alliance sued McDonald's, alleging that its HACER National Scholarship Program unlawfully excluded non-Hispanic applicants because of a requirement that applicants for the scholarship have at least one parent of Hispanic/Latino heritage.\n\nMcDonald's disagreed, but said settling was in the best interest of scholarship applicants. The company said it would remove the offending criteria and instead ask applicants to demonstrate their impact and contribution to the Hispanic/Latino community through their activities, leadership and service.\n\nMcDonald's is among the many corporations to have significantly scaled back major DEI program goals.\n\nWhere corporate giving may go\n\nQuestions about future policies abound. \"You've got a lot of companies and non-profit organizations and universities who are worried about their commitments to diversity and what that commitment can look like in this new world,\" said Danielle Conley, who leads the anti-discrimination and civil rights practice group at law firm Latham & Watkins.\n\nIf a foundation has a grant application process that is racially exclusive, it's ripe for challenge, she said. This may be different from corporate gifts made to organizations, depending on the circumstances, but there are a lot of uncertainties that will likely be fleshed out in the coming years. \"Each company or organization has to do an in-depth evaluation\" of its policies, practices and programs, she said.\n\nCompanies also need to assess their risk tolerance. More risk-averse companies may decide to pull back on certain giving activities in light of the uncertainty, including some things that are legal under today's standards, she said.\n\nMany companies remain committed to DEI initiatives.\n\nA January survey by The Association of Corporate Citizenship Professionals found that 89% of respondents plan to stay on track or increase their corporate social responsibility commitments, said Andrea Wood, chief executive of the membership organization focused on advancing corporate social impact.\n\nA majority of social impact work focuses on low-income communities and companies understand there's a strong business imperative to do so, Wood said. \"Companies are not going to walk away from that.\"\n\nJamie Dimon, chairman and chief executive of JPMorgan Chase recently reiterated the firm's commitment to DEI in an interview with CNBC from Davos. \"We are going to continue to reach out to the Black community, Hispanic community, the LGBT community, the veterans community…\" he said in the interview, noting that if the company was told it was doing something wrong it would \"make modifications\" to its policies. He noted that the company is \"very proud\" of the work it has done to \"lift up cities, schools, states, hospitals, countries, companies, and we're going to do more of the same.\"\n\nCompanies that firmly believe in DEI will find ways, if necessary, to reshape their philanthropic goals such that their objectives are met without running into legal trouble, said F. Warren McFarlan, Albert H. Gordon Professor of Business Administration Emeritus at Harvard Business School. Nobody's talking about not giving charity to the poor, he said. But targeting efforts to certain zip codes, instead of explicitly focusing on race or ethnicity can accomplish a company's goals without causing legal concerns, he said.\n\nOrganizations have to walk a fine line because research suggests that younger talent cares deeply about working for companies that care about environmental and socio-economic issues. \"Companies have to attract the next generation coming in, and if you're seen as out of line [with their values] you don't necessarily attract the kind of people you want,\" McFarlan said.\n\nRevising the language companies use to describe philanthropic efforts, as has been done with DEI — there is much more talk about inclusion now than diversity — may occur within companies that remain committed to their non-profit partners, with tweaks to how they describe their efforts. Over one-third (37%) of executives say they are revising the language and terminology used to describe their initiatives, both internally and externally, according to The Conference Board data.\n\nInstead of phrases related to racial, social or environmental justice, there is more likely to be language on environmental or community resilience, as well as belonging and inclusion and economic opportunity. \"It's trying to be a bit less controversial. Still doing the same work, but doing it in a less polarizing way,\" Jones said.\n\nCompanies said they are making these changes primarily in response to political, social and legal developments and to minimize backlash, according to The Conference Board.\n\nFor employees at big companies, a lot of this work will go on behind the scenes and remain invisible to the rank-and-file. However, one way in which all employees may experience these changes is through corporate charitable donation matching programs. The chilling effect of the government's pushback on DEI could also start to impact on companies' that currently match employee donations to charities, some industry participants said.\n\nCompanies have varying approaches, with some more restrictive on what's an acceptable match. Graham of Giving Strong said she expects some companies will change their matching policies, or, at the very least review them, in the wake of greater scrutiny. \"Everything is under review right now when it comes to discretionary funds,\" she said.",

        "fullContent": "As President Donald Trump approaches the first-month mark in his second term, he has moved with dizzying speed and blunt force to reorder American social and political norms and the economy while redefining the U.S. role in the world.\n\nAt the same time, he has empowered Elon Musk, an unelected, South African-born billionaire, to help engineer the firing of thousands of federal employees and potentially shutter entire agencies created by Congress.\n\nThose efforts have largely overshadowed Trump's crackdowns on immigration and the U.S.-Mexico border, and his efforts to remake social policy by wiping out diversity, equity and inclusion programs and rolling back transgender rights.\n\nThe president has also imposed scores of new tariffs against U.S. trade partners and threatened more, even as economists warn that will pass costs on to U.S. consumers and feed inflation.\n\nGet top local stories in Philly delivered to you every morning. Sign up for NBC Philadelphia's News Headlines newsletter.\n\nHere's a look at the first four weeks:\n\nMass federal firings begin\n\nNews4's Dominique Moody had new reaction from a federal worker affected by recent mass layoffs.\n\nThe Trump administration fired thousands of workers who were still in probationary periods common among new hires. Some had less than an hour to leave their offices.\n\nThose potentially losing jobs include medical scientists, energy infrastructure specialists, foreign service employees, FBI agents, prosecutors, educational and farming data experts, overseas aid workers and even human resources personnel who would otherwise have to manage the dismissals.\n\nAt the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which was created to protect the public after the 2008 financial crisis, employees say the administration not only wants to cut nearly the entire workforce but also erase all its data from the past 12 years. The administration agreed to pause any further dismantling of the agency until March 3, under a judge's order.\n\nWhile Trump promised to turn Washington upside down, his moves could have far-reaching implications for thousands of federal employees around the country and drive up the unemployment rate if large numbers of layoffs happen at once.\n\nLegal challenges mount\n\nCourt challenges to Trump’s policies started on Inauguration Day and have continued at a furious pace since Jan. 20. The administration is facing some 70 lawsuits nationwide challenging his executive orders and moves to downsize the federal government.\n\nThe Republican-controlled Congress is putting up little resistance, so the court system is ground zero for pushback. Judges have issued more than a dozen orders at least temporarily blocking aspects of Trump's agenda, ranging from an executive order to end U.S. citizenship extended automatically to people born in this country to giving Musk's team access to sensitive federal data.\n\nWhile many of those judges were nominated by Democratic presidents, Trump has gotten unfavorable rulings from judges picked by Republican presidents, too. Trump suggested he could target the judiciary, saying, “Maybe we have to look at the judges.\" The administration has said in the meantime that it will appeal, while White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt railed against the orders slowing the president's agenda, calling each “an abuse of the rule of law.”\n\nThe administration has notched a few wins, too, most significantly when a judge allowed it to move forward with a deferred resignation program spearheaded by Musk.\n\nThe economic outlook worsens\n\nAmid the policy upheaval, the latest economic data could prompt some White House worries.\n\nInflation rose at a monthly rate of 0.5% in January, according to the Labor Department. Over the past three months, the consumer price index has increased at an annual rate of 4.5% -- a sign that inflation is heating up again after having cooled for much of 2024.\n\nTrump told voters he could lower inflation, and do so almost immediately after taking office. But Leavitt, while blaming Trump's predecessor, Democrat Joe Biden, acknowledged the latest inflation indicators were \"worse than expected.”\n\nMore trouble signs came when the Commerce Department reported that retail sales slumped 0.9% on a monthly basis in January. A drop that large could signal a weakening in consumer confidence and economic growth.\n\nThe Federal Reserve’s report on industrial production also found that factory output slipped 0.1% in January, largely due to a 5.2% drop in the making of motor vehicles and parts.\n\nThese could all be blips, which means the monthly data in February will really matter.\n\nThe ‘fair trade’ Trump wants isn't necessarily fair\n\nPresident Donald Trump signed a memorandum Thursday which seeks to impose \"fair and reciprocal\" trade tariffs on all major U.S. trading partners, including longtime allies.\n\nAfter previously imposing tariffs on China and readying import taxes on Canada and Mexico, Trump rolled out what he called the “big one.” He said his administration would put together new tariffs in the coming weeks and months to match what other countries charge.\n\nOther nations hardly find Trump’s approach fair.\n\nFrom their vantage point, he is including items other than tariffs such as value added taxes, which are akin to sales taxes. That means the rates could be much higher than a standard tariff in Europe.\n\nOn top of that, Trump plans separate additional tariffs on autos, computer chips and pharmaceuticals, in addition to the 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum that he announced on Monday.\n\nIt is not clear whether these trade penalties are mainly negotiating tools or ways for Trump to raise revenues. So far, he has suggested that they are both.\n\nCongress watches its authority erode. But there are signs of pushback\n\nCongress finds itself confounded by the onslaught as its institutional power — as the Constitution’s first branch of government with its unmatched authority over federal spending — is being eroded in real time.\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., said he finds the work of Musk's team “very exciting.” Johnson said Trump is “taking legitimate executive action.\"\n\nBut even among congressional Republicans there were small signs of protest emerging — letters being written and phone calls being made — to protect their home-state interests and constituents as funding for programs, services and government contracts is being dismantled.\n\nRep. Carlos Gimenez, R-Fla., urged the Homeland Security Department not to issue blanket deportations for Venezuelan migrants who fled their country and now call the Miami-area home. “I’m not powerless. I’m a member of Congress,” he said.\n\nDemocratic lawmakers have joined protesters outside shuttered federal offices, arguing Trump and Musk had gone too far. Democrats suggested legislation to protect various programs, and even filed articles of impeachment against the president over his plans to bulldoze and redevelop Gaza.\n\nTrump wants a new world order\n\nWith his phone call to Russian President Vladimir Putin this past week, Trump is hoping he initiated the beginning of the end of the Kremlin's war on Ukraine.\n\nThe leaders agreed to have their teams “start negotiations immediately.” After getting off the phone with Putin, Trump called Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to discuss getting both sides to the negotiating table.\n\nThe Putin call is a monumental development in a war that has left hundreds of thousands dead or seriously wounded.\n\nBut the way ahead remains complicated.\n\nZelenskyy said he will not meet with Putin until a plan for peace is hammered out by Trump. Trump has gotten blowback when European leaders sharply criticized him and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth for suggesting that NATO membership was not in the cards for Ukraine.\n\nThe White House faces a further quandary with Zelenskyy wanting the U.S. and other countries to provide security guarantees for Ukraine, and Zelenskyy insisting that he and Trump iron out an agreement on the contours of any peace deal.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Aamer Madhani in Munich and AP Congressional Correspondent Lisa Mascaro contributed to this report.",

Sign up for NBC Philadelphia's News Headlines newsletter.\n\nNussmeier seems like an obvious choice for Moore. Nussmeier and Moore have bene together with the Cowboys, Chargers and now Eagles. In fact, Nussmeier was the only coach that Moore brought with him to Philly when he became the offensive coordinator last offseason.\n\nEagles passing game coordinator Kevin Patullo has been linked to the Saints’ OC opening, as well as being listed as a potential replacement for Moore in Philly.\n\nWhile the Eagles had a run-heavy offense in 2024, Nussmeier seemed to forge a strong connection with Jalen Hurts, who won Super Bowl MVP.\n\nAt the defensive coordinator spot, the Saints have already interviewed Vikings DBs coach Daronte Jones and are also going to interview 49ers assistant HC Brandon Staley for the opening. While Staley might be the favorite, Parker is an attractive candidate.\n\nIn his first year with the Eagles under Vic Fangio, Parker’s defensive backs had a tremendous season. The Eagles had the No. 1 pass defense in the NFL on their way to a Super Bowl win. The Eagles got high-level play from two rookies in Quinyon Mitchell and Cooper DeJean. And the entire secondary worked in harmony this season.\n\nParker, 33, coached under Fangio in Denver in 2021 and stayed there from 2021-23 as their defensive backs coach. He previously worked for the Packers from 2019-20 as a defensive quality control coach.\n\nSubscribe to Eagle Eye anywhere you get your podcasts:\n\nApple Podcasts | YouTube Music | Spotify | Stitcher | Simplecast | RSS | Watch on YouTube",

        "fullContent": "Letters went out to dozens of probationary employees in at least one section of the Department of Transportation that said part of the reason they were being fired was for poor performance, according to a copy of the letter obtained by NBC News.\n\nBut as a source familiar and a secondary document viewed by NBC News laid out, most of those employees were rated as being “exceptional” performers by their supervisors.\n\nWe’re looking to hear from federal government workers. If you’re willing to talk with us, please email us at tips@nbcuni.com or contact us through one of these methods.\n\n“Employee has demonstrated exceptional performance and has no conduct issues,” supervisor reviews read for many of the laid-off workers.\n\nGet top local stories in Philly delivered to you every morning. Sign up for NBC Philadelphia's News Headlines newsletter.\n\n“These letters that we’re sending these employees, I feel so bad because they’re lying,” the person familiar said. “All of them, pretty much, were exceptional performers. It’s just crazy to me.”\n\nThe firings come as the Trump administration steps up its purge of the federal workforce. But they’re being done so quickly, and are often directed by people with no government experience, that agencies are having to contend with the messy fallout — which has included trying to un-fire people.\n\nOn Thursday, Office of Personnel Management officials notified agencies that they should cut loose their probationary employees, which could affect hundreds of thousands of people, according to OPM data, though the exact number of those who will be let go was not immediately clear.\n\nProbationary status has nothing to do with performance; it typically indicates someone who has been working in the federal government for less than two years — before full civil service protections kick in. It can also apply to longtime civil service workers who move to a different agency or job.\n\nRobert F. Kennedy Jr. was confirmed by the Senate as the Secretary of Health and Human Services on Thursday.\n\n“The U.S. Department of Transportation finds, that based on your performance you have not demonstrated that your further employment at the Department of Transportation would be in the public interest,” the letter to fired staffers read. “For this reason, the Department of Transportation is removing you from your position with the Department of Transportation and the federal civil service effective today.”\n\nFederal regulations state that probationary employees “shall” be terminated during the probationary period “if the employee fails to demonstrate fully his or her qualifications for continued employment.” Moreover, regulations state that “information in the notice as to why the employee is being terminated shall, as a minimum, consist of the agency’s conclusions as to the inadequacies of his performance or conduct.”\n\nA Department of Transportation spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment, nor did the White House. McLaurine Pinover, an OPM spokesperson, deferred to the Department of Transportation and said the administration would not be able to provide full details on how many probationary employees were cut across the government until Tuesday.\n\n“The probationary period is a continuation of the job application process, not an entitlement for permanent employment,” an OPM spokesperson said in an earlier statement. “Agencies are taking independent action in light of the recent hiring freeze and in support of the President’s broader efforts to restructure and streamline the federal government to better serve the American people at the highest possible standard.”\n\nWith the Trump administration seeking to cut up to 10% of the federal workforce, mass firings have at times been done in a haphazard manner. One employee at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau who was told they were fired provided NBC News with a copy of a letter informing them of their termination that did not even include their name. Instead, it was addressed to “[EmployeeFirstName] [EmployeeLastName]” and was filled with other placeholder text including “[JobTitle],” “[Division]” and “[AppointmentDate].”\n\nAnd on Friday, National Nuclear Security Administration officials sought to notify some employees who were fired the day before that they are now due to be reinstated — but struggled to find them because they didn’t have their new contact information.\n\n“The termination letters for some NNSA probationary employees are being rescinded, but we do not have a good way to get in touch with those personnel,” read an email sent to NNSA employees and obtained by NBC News.\n\nIn addition to the potential for hundreds of thousands of probationary employees to be let go, the White House has said about 75,000 people have accepted their offer of “deferred resignation” as of Wednesday, though NBC News cannot independently verify that total. The federal government employs more than 2 million workers, and their total compensation makes up about 6.6% of the overall budget.\n\nAttorney General Pam Bondi announced the Trump administration sued the state of New York due to policies that are blocking federal authorities from enforcing immigration laws.\n\nJudges have halted some of this wide-ranging effort to rapidly upend the government, though a federal judge did allow the deferred resignation program to move forward.\n\nCommenting on the legality of his administration’s actions on Saturday, President Donald Trump posted a remark on social media that has generally been attributed to the French leader Napoleon Bonaparte.\n\n“He who saves his Country does not violate any Law,” Trump wrote.\n\nThis article first appeared on NBCNews.com.

Despite having opposing extroverted and introverted personalities, he believes their relationship has struck the perfect balance.\n\n\"It’s so good because I get her out, and she calms me down when I need it,\" the \"Wide Open\" cookbook author explained in a joint interview for Interview published Feb. 14. \"She's the first person that I’ve been with where I’m like, ‘I don’t even give a f--- what’s going on. I could sit in this bed with you for 72 hours and feel like I didn’t miss anything.’”\n\nIn fact, he likened their chemistry to \"heroin and Xanax combined.\"\n\n\"Whenever I’m feeling anything but perfect, she knows the exact thing to say,\" continued Blanco, who's been dating Gomez since 2023. \"I’m so pissed that it took this long.

The program deadline was Feb. 6, and administration officials said employees who accept will be able to stop working while still collecting a paycheck until Sept. 30.\n\nGet top local stories in Philly delivered to you every morning. Sign up for NBC Philadelphia's News Headlines newsletter.\n\nHowever, IRS employees involved in the 2025 tax season were told they will not be allowed to accept a buyout offer from the Trump administration until after the taxpayer filing deadline, according to a letter sent recently to IRS employees.\n\nIt is unclear how many workers will be impacted by the layoff announcement plan. Representatives from the U.S. Treasury and IRS did not respond to Associated Press requests for comment.\n\nJan. 27 was the official start date of the 2025 tax season, and the IRS expects more than 140 million tax returns to be filed by the April 15 deadline. The Biden administration invested heavily in the IRS through an $80 billion infusion of funds in Democrats' Inflation Reduction Act, which included plans to hire tens of thousands of new employees to help with customer service and enforcement as well as new technology to update the tax collection agency.\n\nRepublicans have been successful at clawing back that money, and billionaire Elon Musk and his Department of Government Efficiency have called for the U.S. to “delete entire agencies” from the federal government as part of his to radically cut spending and restructure its priorities.\n\nElected officials are trying to fight against DOGE plans. Attorneys general from 14 states challenged the authority of to access sensitive government data and exercise “virtually unchecked power” in a lawsuit filed Thursday.\n\nThe lawsuit, filed in federal court in Washington, says the actions taken by Musk at the helm of DOGE can only be taken by a nominated and Senate-confirmed official. It cites constitutional provisions that delineate the powers of Congress and the president.\n\nPresident Trump announced Sunday night on his Truth Social site that the government would stop minting the one-cent coin to cut costs.",

Brady Tkachuk fought Sam Bennett immediately off the ensuing faceoff. And J.T. Miller and Colton Parayko went at it after some pushing and shoving around Canada goaltender Jordan Binnington after he covered the puck.\n\nCanada got a power play out of the third fight, with Miller penalized for cross-checking as well as fighting.\n\nIt all happened after a large percentage of the sellout crowd at Bell Centre loudly booed the U.S. anthem. Fans lined up by the hundreds to get into the arena more than 90 minutes before start time and also booed every time a U.S. player was shown on video screens during pregame warmups.",

        "fullContent": "Best gaming laptops from MSI, Acer and more\n\nAs a participant in multiple affiliate marketing programs, Localish will earn a commission for certain purchases. See full disclaimer below*\n\nIf you're a casual gamer you might not think you need a gaming laptop, but having one can be great for competitive gamers, streamers or anyone who spends time playing cooperatively with their friends daily. Below, you'll find the best gaming laptops at every price point, plus the features you might want to keep in mind before shopping for one.\n\nGaming laptops buying guide:\n\nScreen size and resolution: You might want a larger screen size on your gaming laptop if you're dealing with games with a lot of moving parts. That said, a larger screen size usually commands a higher price point. Below, we've highlighted gaming laptops with screen sizes of 14 and 16-inch. The resolution states how clear your picture will be. A higher resolution is preferred for competitive gamers. The below laptops have at least a Full HD resolution, but we've also included options for 4K (four times the clarity of a physical HD laptop).\n\nOperating System: An OS usually handles all the application programs on your computer, including how the RAM is managed. Windows OS 11 is the best for gaming, but you can also use Atlast OS which optimizes system performance and lowers latency.\n\nRAM: You'll want at least 16 GB of RAM on your gaming laptop. This is required to run any AAA titles (games produced by major publishers) at their native resolutions and without lags. If you're looking to stream while gaming, go higher with a 32 GB laptop.\n\nStorage: Ideally you'll want a laptop with at least 512 GB of storage. This sounds like a lot, but games are usually at least 100 GB, so with a 512 GB laptop you'll be able to store 4-5 games at a time. You can also purchase additional SSDs if you need a higher amount of storage in the short term.\n\nBest gaming laptops\n\nAmazon MSI Cyborg 14 $1099 Shop now\n\nI tested this laptop for about a month and was impressed by both its performance and design. It's surprisingly lightweight, stays cool to the touch while gaming, and has a tactile, responsive keyboard for quick feedback. There is also up to 1 TB of storage available, and the 14-inch display FHD+ display is just big and bright enough to keep track of all your in-game characters. Its fan and in-built cooling system is not that noisy either and the backlit keyboard is great for gaming after hours. I honestly love this piece of gaming equipment and think it's a great laptop for beginner and seasoned gamers alike.\n\nBest Buy ASUS - ROG Zephyrus G14 $1599 Shop now\n\nThis is a great laptop for beginners and expert gamers alike. It comes with 16 GB of RAM, a Full HD resolution, and a Windows 11 operating system for quick gameplay with no lag time. It also boasts rapid response times (the lower the response time, the quicker your laptop is) and has 1TB of in-built storage which means it's able to store a decent amount of games. It offers intelligent cooling which should also keep this pick from quickly heating up, and six speakers equipped with Domby Atmos, allowing you to use it without a pair of good-quality gaming headphones. You'll also get three months of Xbox game pass included which will give you access to 100s of free games - including new titles.\n\nAmazon Razer Blade 14 (2024) $2699.99 Shop now\n\nRazer just announced the new and thinner Razer Blade 16 at CES, but you'll have to wait for a little before you can shop that pick. In fact, most Razer laptops are currently out of stock at major retailers. That said, you can currently purchase the Razer Blade 14 - last year's release. It has 32 GB of RAM making it a strong pick, and it also carries a whole 1TB of storage. Plus, it has a Windows 11 operating system similar to some of the other picks on this list. Battery life lasts eight hours (but keep in mind that gaming laptops are notorious for fast-depleting batteries due to how heavy-duty most AAA titles are). It is also one of the lightest Razer laptops around, making it a great buy for those always on the go.\n\nAmazon HP Omen 16 $1199 Shop now\n\nHP's 2023 Omen is still a top contender. For starters, it has a wide, 16.1-inch Full HD display with an anti-glare screen so you can game wherever you are. This option also has 1 TB of storage (but the brand offers options up to 4 TB if you need it) and like the other picks on our list, a fully customizable RGB backlit keyboard and built-in speakers. It weighs around five pounds and also comes with multiple USB port options. Plus, since it has 32GB of RAM it can handle most games with ease - you can also customize it to up to 64 GB of RAM.\n\n* By clicking on the featured links, visitors will leave this site and be directed to third-party e-commerce sites that operate under different terms and privacy policies.

I couldn't imagine playing anywhere else,\" said DeJean.\n\nHe says he's still from the Super Bowl win.\n\n\"Me getting my first pick, Super Bowl on my Birthday and then winning the game, best part about it. Getting to hold that Lombardi trophy,\" said DeJean.\n\nCooper DeJean wasn't the only Eagles player spending time with fans, cornerback Darius Slay stopped by Dick's Sporting Goods in King of Prussia.\n\nThe line also wrapped around the building for Slay where he was signing autographs and taking pictures.\n\n\"I feel like I'm very much loved here,\" said Slay. \"It feels good man, show you the fans appreciate us as players and I'm thankful for the fan base. I'm loving it.\"\n\nSlay says he's embracing all the love, and he tells Action News' Sharifa Jackson he plans to relax this off-season.\n\n\"I'm going to take some time to relax, play my video game, golf a little bit and attend some of my kids football games and special events,\" said Slay.",

We can't be great without the greatness of others and that certainly applies to our fans,\" said head coach Nick Sirianni.\n\nEagles general manager Howie Roseman, his forehead cut from a beer can thrown his way, took the podium with the Lombardi Trophy in hand and proclaimed, \"I bleed for this city!\"\n\nEagles executive VP and general manager Howie Roseman enjoys a cigar during the team's NFL football Super Bowl 59 parade and celebration, Friday, Feb. 14, 2025, in Philadelphia. AP Photo/Chris Szagola\n\nEagles wide receiver A.J. Brown also took the stage, and at the conclusion of his speech recited the criticism that was leveled at him throughout the season.\n\n\"They said I was a diva, they said all I care about was stats,\" Brown said. \"You gonna get all those things wrong about me, but one thing you get right: \"I'm a f---ing champion!\"\n\nBarkley, along with many other players, hopped off the open-air buses to walk along the parade route and exchanged high-fives with fans who pressed against teetering barricades.\n\nEagles RB Saquon Barkley hopped off the bus and greeted fans along the route during the Super Bowl Championship Parade!\n\nJordan Jaindl, who couldn't make it to the 2018 parade after the Eagles won their first Super Bowl, wasn't going to miss this one, bringing his wife and three daughters from Binghamton, New York. This team, he said, was the embodiment of the city.\n\n\"Their work ethic,\" he said. \"How they have to grind for each win. We have to grind here in Philly.\"\n\nFans showed up with grocery carts stocked with food and booze while some stayed warm in a hotel, sipping champagne. One group roasted a pig with the number \"15\" carved into the side -- a final shot at Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes.\n\nAn Eagles fan roasted a pig for the Super Bowl celebrations and dubbed it \"Patty the Pig.\"\n\nThe Eagles, despite being underdogs, dominated the Chiefs on Sunday, shutting them out in the first half before finishing with a 40-22 victory.\n\n\"I'm so happy you didn't have to go through a nail-biter game,\" said veteran defensive end Brandon Graham. \"It's about us being gritty. We're going to stay gritty.\"\n\nFULL SPEECH: Brandon Graham wraps up Super Bowl victory parade celebrations.\n\nGraham, 11 weeks after tearing his triceps and declaring that he was out for the rest of the season, returned to play 13 snaps in the Super Bowl. Prior to the season, he had announced his intention to retire after his 15th year in the league, but left his future plans more open-ended during his parade speech Friday.\n\n\"I'm so thankful for my kids, my family. So thankful to be a part of this organization. You guys made me what I am today,\" said Graham, who was the last Eagles player to speak. \"Only problem I have with this season is that it's over. We getting ready for next year.\"\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.",

(Photo by TIMOTHY A. CLARY / AFP) (Photo by TIMOTHY A. CLARY/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nSign up for our email newsletter to stay up-to-date on the latest local sports news throughout Philadelphia.\n\nThe NBA All-Star break could not have come sooner for the Philadelphia 76ers and their fans. Given how poorly this season has gone, it would be welcomed if the Sixers could just stay on break.\n\nA season from Hell does not even begin to describe the bad vibes that have permeated through this team since training camp. It is now mid-February, with the playoffs starting in two months, and the Sixers are somehow in a worse spot than they were when their record was 3-14 through 17 games.\n\nEvery single main character for the Sixers has played a leading role in this debacle. It starts at the top with Daryl Morey and Nick Nurse — a fish rots from the head down.\n\nTyrese Maxey got off to a rough individual start this season and, for the first time in his career, showed cracks in the armor of his effervescent personality.\n\nPaul George was supposed to be the team’s missing connector, but he has instead brought his lackadaisical “California cool” to South Philadelphia, admittedly the worst place in the country to play and act careless.\n\nAnd, of course, there is the man in the center of it all: Joel Embiid. Whether it be his own ego, organizational malpractice, or (most likely) both, he is the reason this team has no direction today, and he is the reason why it is hard to see the team have a direction in the near future.\n\nDaryl Morey\n\nDaryl Morey has always had a very specific philosophy of team building, dating back to his original trade for James Harden over a decade ago with the Houston Rockets. The greatest collection of talent often does win out in the NBA, but Morey’s hyper-fixation on acquiring superstars has left any roster he has overseen with too many holes to hoist the Larry O’Brien trophy.\n\nThis is not meant to be a referendum on Morey’s efforts. The most success of Joel Embiid’s career came with Morey building the team around him. Morey is not afraid to admit his mistakes on a transactional basis, but at some point, he has to evolve his entire line of thinking instead of throwing the same thing at the wall and hoping it sticks.\n\nPHILADELPHIA, PENNSYLVANIA – DECEMBER 15: President of basketball operations Daryl Morey participates in a press conference before a game between the Philadelphia Flyers and the Washington Capitals at the Wells Fargo Center on December 15, 2023 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. (Photo by Tim Nwachukwu/Getty Images)\n\nMorey has been here long enough to understand that Embiid is not like other superstars in the NBA. He is going to miss more time than anyone else and is a far greater injury risk than most others, as well. What Daryl Morey has done is continue to build the team as if he is on the floor every night, still dominating the league, instead of building out a roster that can stay afloat and even succeed when he is not there. For a team that has Tyrese Maxey and Paul George signed to $200-plus million contracts, that is unacceptable.\n\nNick Nurse\n\nJoel Embiid was at the peak of his basketball powers playing under Nick Nurse until he tore his meniscus last season. Nick Nurse is also, clearly, not the right coach moving forward for the Sixers. Both things can be true.\n\nNick Nurse won a championship as head coach of the Toronto Raptors behind an all-time great playoff run by Kawhi Leonard and going through a Golden State Warriors team that saw both Kevin Durant tear his Achilles tendon and Klay Thompson tear his ACL in the Finals. Kawhi Leonard then left for the Clippers, and the Raptors never found a semblance of that success again.\n\nThat is not all on Nurse, of course. Kawhi had an argument at the time for being the single most effective player in the sport on a game-to-game basis when he played. Kyle Lowry was not getting any younger either (and still is not, as Sixers fans know). The roster was incredibly clunky. However, Nick Nurse showed his hand as a coach during the Raptors’ descent, and it was overlooked for the most part when he came to Philadelphia for those aforementioned reasons.\n\nJan 4, 2025; Brooklyn, New York, USA; Philadelphia 76ers head coach Nick Nurse looks back during the first half against the Brooklyn Nets at Barclays Center. Mandatory Credit: Vincent Carchietta-Imagn Images\n\nNick Nurse needs a dominant offensive force on his roster to make up for his lack of innovation on that end of the floor. When that force leaves like Leonard or rarely suits up like Embiid, he has not shown the ability to adjust- and he has had years to figure something out. Defense is Nurse’s specialty, and even that has not been consistently good enough. His players in Toronto were tuning him out as his tenure was coming to an end, and it sure seems like that is the case here, too.\n\nTyrese Maxey\n\nIt has been a tough year for Tyrese Maxey, even as he has started to pick up his level of play these past couple of months. He was very poor offensively by his standards to start the season. He put on a lot of muscle over the summer to play more physically, and there’s been a lot of speculation that it affected his shooting stroke for a while before his body adjusted. The weight of expectations that come from signing a massive contract extension did not help either.\n\nFeb 11, 2025; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA; Philadelphia 76ers guard Tyrese Maxey (0) controls the ball against the Toronto Raptors in the first quarter at Wells Fargo Center. Mandatory Credit: Kyle Ross-Imagn Images\n\nWith Joel Embiid and Paul George both out when the season started, Maxey was not capable of carrying the team to victories on his own. As the losses piled up, so did his visible, outward frustration. That was something he had never really shown before, and it continued for the first three months of the season. To his credit, he has pulled himself out of the funk he was in, but now we know somewhere in that blinding smile is a man who is not happy with the state of affairs right now.\n\nPaul George\n\nThe larger the sample we see from Paul George, the more obvious his intentions in a Sixers uniform become. It does not matter that he has not gotten nearly as much playing time with Joel Embiid and Tyrese Maxey as he and everyone would like. It does not matter that he has been banged up a few times—including currently with a tendon issue in his finger—because everyone on the team has. What matters are his actions on the court.\n\nFeb 11, 2025; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA; Philadelphia 76ers forward Paul George (8) drives with the ball against the Toronto Raptors in the first quarter at Wells Fargo Center. Mandatory Credit: Kyle Ross-Imagn Images\n\nPaul George made it clear that he wanted to stay and end his career in his home state of California. Still, when he signed with a team as far away from California as possible for as much money as possible, he said all the right things. He had a preexisting friendship with Embiid and quickly looked to develop one with Maxey. It felt like the Sixers finally had the core in place that they wanted.\n\nAs the season has gone on, however, George has become less and less engaged. He has been bad offensively all year- sometimes that happens. But as the Sixers have continued to plummet, so have his efforts everywhere else on the court. It is reasonable to think he did not expect the vibes to be this awful, and he is also 34 years old, but it is becoming increasingly evident that he has no heart in this. Kelly Oubre and Guerschon Yabusele might not make nearly as much money, but they give a damn. Tyrese Maxey also makes significantly less money than George, and he gives a damn too.\n\nJoel Embiid\n\nWhere to even start…\n\nJoel Embiid tore his meniscus in Jan. 2024. He rushed back for the playoffs, but the Sixers were dispatched in the first round while he played physically compromised. He then played in the Olympics and won a Gold Medal. By the time training camp and the start of the NBA season roll around, he is nowhere to be found.\n\nFeb 11, 2025; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA; Philadelphia 76ers center Joel Embiid (21) reacts against the Toronto Raptors in the second quarter at Wells Fargo Center. Mandatory Credit: Kyle Ross-Imagn Images\n\nTo make matters worse, any time someone was asked about his health or his absence, nobody gave a real answer. That trend has continued literally to this day. Joel Embiid has played a total of 17 games this season. The Sixers are 8-9 in those games. Last year, in Embiid’s 39 games played, the Sixers were 31-8. Tyrese Maxey called him out in a closed-door meeting that someone decided needed to be open-door.\n\nThen Lisa Salters of ESPN reported that Embiid himself stated that he would “likely require” another surgery and an extended recovery time after the season.\n\nIf that is the case, why is Embiid playing at all? It is completely nonsensical that a player who needs knee surgery announces the need while the team does not mention the idea once and for the player to be currently suited up in an NBA basketball game the moment the public is told of this.\n\nThis is truly infuriating stuff that does not happen to any normal franchise in the NBA. These persisting issues are as much, if not more, on Joel than on the Sixers organization. Shut it all down. Destination nowhere.",

And just like I was like, ‘That’s enough, [I] can’t take any more.’ The whole album was written while I lived in LA, and song-wise, I would say there’s a bit of everything. There’s a lot of reflection and a lot of looking back. But, honestly, [when] writing songs, your entire experience kind of comes out in a song. If you’re writing in a proper way, which is just like digging until you find something, you bring it to the surface, and it starts to become something.\n\nThe first song is me looking back to Glasgow, waiting on a bus, and then this metaphor of a bus being like life, your kind of mortality. It’s a bit deep, but I’m thinking about it. I’m 51, I’m a father. So I’m thinking about stuff like that. Song two is called ‘Raze The Bar,’ which is about this brilliant bar in New York. It’s got nothing to do with LA, but I think living in LA has made me really long for everything outside of LA. So I’m thinking about New York and the third song, it’s a breakup song, looking at my relationship with my ex, looking at my relationship with my son.\n\nAnd then the fourth song is ‘Gaslight,’ which is just a song about being gaslit for quite a while and getting emancipation, that sort of thing, fighting back against those a–holes. I think there’s been a lot of the tectonic movement in my life, emotional plates moving big, big, big things happening, people dying, people leaving, weeding the garden, so to speak, and then coming out the other side of it and this record sort of chronicles all of that sort of movement.\n\nYou’ve said that for you, the process is not to write songs for charts but to write based on life. Can you delve into that a bit?\n\nEvery song [I’ve ever written] is about something. There’s about 5% of our business that, I would say, innovates. And I think a lot of music, that 95% of music in the charts, is that other type of music. When Travis got massive, like no one even knew we existed, and then suddenly, the next year, we were so different than everything else that everything else had to change to fit in with us. So you find all these bands suddenly sounding like you. We were part of the 5% that just does its thing and, just by chance, became popular, and then the whole business then goes, Oh, we gotta sound like this because this is popular.\n\nSo they all follow; it’s like the flock follows whatever it is. And so I’ve never stopped writing like that. So when we’re suddenly very popular, then suddenly The Strokes come along, I’m not going to suddenly sound like The Strokes just to be popular. That just so goes against the grain of what I’m about. We’re not that kind of band. But again, bands that I love are bands like us that are the 5% bands that just cut their own; they cut their own [teeth]. And I think it’s maybe a little bit more interesting than someone who or a writer who is constantly just trying to stay in fashion…\n\nAuthenticity is one big thing for us. Just be who you are, no matter what that is. Two, art because we all went to art school. We’re an art school band. And three mischief. I’m not so cheeky in real life. I can be, but I’m much more so on the stage… And so we decided that everything we put out has to have those three things in it. And there’s a fourth thing, which is storytelling. It’s a big part of what we do. And the live shows really encapsulated all of those elements together.\n\nThis seems to parallel a lyric by My Morning Jacket from the song ‘Wordless Chorus,’ which says “We are the innovators, they are the imitators. ” Does it seem to be that same type of idea?\n\nThat’s the perfect comparison, yeah, Jim [James] is amazing.\n\nWhat can fans coming to see Travis expect, and why should they be excited?\n\nLet’s talk about My Morning Jacket for a second and not talk about Travis as an example. You listen to ‘Z’ (the album that features ‘Wordless Chorus’), if you listen to it, and that’s the band in a studio playing as much live, hopefully as possible, and then you turn it up on your stereo, and to get the heavy guitars louder, to get the experience that’s like 1% of of the band you’re getting.\n\nIn order to completely get that band, you have to go and see them live. You have to go and stand at the feet of Jim James and hear his roar, watch the guitar, just see the way the guitarist runs across the stage. And that’s where music really resides. I mean, it really is. Seeing a band live is, that’s it. You get the whole DNA of everything and albums, not to knock albums, because albums are art pieces in themselves, but if you really want to get into a band or understand the band.\n\n[Travis is] very artistic. We’re very silly up front, not silly, but entertaining on stage and we’re serious as well. And have quite a lot to say. But it’s cool, it’s just real. And it’s, there’s no backing tracks or anything, and it’s like four guys just f–king hitting their s–t out their instruments and making something out of it.\n\nCatch ‘Travis’ at the Keswick Theater on Tuesday, Feb. 18, for more information, visit keswicktheatre.com",

They had the number-one defense in the league and the number-one rushing attack, thanks to Saquon Barkley. While Saquon Barkley was the final piece to the puzzle for the Eagles offense, the picture that the puzzle made has yet to truly be admired.\n\nYes, you have a stout defense taking up one side with photos of Jalen Carter, Zack Baun, Brandon Graham, Darius Slay, and others but at the very center of the photo is one player who has been often overlooked this year. The franchise QB, the leader, the glue that held it all together since 2022, Jalen Hurts.\n\nBut who is Jalen Hurts? Why do the National Media and even local media continue to struggle with giving him his credit?\n\nFeb 9, 2025; New Orleans, LA, USA; Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Jalen Hurts (1) celebrates after winning against Kansas City Chiefs in Super Bowl LIX at Caesars Superdome. Mandatory Credit: Geoff Burke-Imagn Images\n\nIn an era where stats reign supreme and wins are second nature, Jalen Hurts finds himself to be the outcast, the sore thumb, the stepchild to a generation of football where analytics reign supreme. He isn’t your modern-day football version of LeBron James, that just isn’t him. There’s no ego in Jalen’s approach to the game which makes him “unlikable” in the eyes of the media and fans alike.\n\nHe’s not chasing the ultimate records for quarterbacks, that’s not what he’s after. He doesn’t care about the spotlight, instead, he would rather just continue to work until you have no choice but to acknowledge him. To Hurts, the main thing has always been the main thing and that’s winning. In five years as the Eagles’ starting quarterback, Jalen Hurts has a record of 46-20.\n\nHe started only four games in his rookie season as he pushed Carson Wentz out of the role and ultimately out of Philadelphia. That year he went 1-3 and the team missed the playoffs which led to the firing of Doug Pederson and the introduction of Nick Sirianni.\n\nSince playing under Nick Sirianni, Hurts has made the playoffs in each of the last four seasons with winning records. The Eagles have won two NFC East division titles, two NFC Championships, and now, one Super Bowl. That’s all Hurts does. He’s a winner. He was bred to win and to the disappointment of all his critics, that’s all he cares about.\n\nFeb 9, 2025; New Orleans, LA, USA; Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Jalen Hurts (1) drops back to pass against the Kansas City Chiefs during the second quarter in Super Bowl LIX at Caesars Superdome. Mandatory Credit: Kirby Lee-Imagn Images\n\nHe’s an intelligent player who operates at the line of scrimmage similarly to Tom Brady and Peyton Manning once did. He puts his weapons in a position to succeed every time. From a 60-yard touchdown run by Saquon Barkley to a 46-yard touchdown pass to DeVonta Smith, Jalen Hurts operates in a way that many other quarterbacks can’t.\n\nBut unless you dive into the film and dissect his every move at the line of scrimmage, you won’t see the engineering he does on every drive. You probably can’t see it because you’re looking for the wrong thing. Which is fine but it also means that people need to take a step back and come back to his film with an open mind and fresh eyes.\n\nThe big question around the league is where Jalen Hurts ranks among the great young QBs of the game today. While I will agree with many that Patrick Mahomes is in a class of his own, I will disagree with even more folks on the fact that Jalen Hurts is a top-5 quarterback in the NFL. Yes, I said it and I will go a step further and tell you that he is an elite QB as well.\n\nWhat separates other QBs from Jalen Hurts? Is it Lamar Jackson’s flashy elusiveness in the middle of the field? Josh Allen’s rocket launcher of an arm? Joe Burrow’s accuracy? Or are the over-inflated stats that each of these quarterbacks put up week in and week out as their teams struggle to make it to the ultimate stage that Jalen Hurts has been to twice?\n\nHe doesn’t put up the sexy numbers that you want to see every week but that doesn’t mean that he can’t. But what he does do is put his team in a position to win. Even against those quarterbacks that I mentioned above. Jalen Hurts is 15-7 against AFC opponents in his career.\n\nHe recently defeated Joe Burrow, Josh Allen, Patrick Mahomes (twice), and Lamar Jackson over the last two seasons. Of that elite group, Jalen Hurts is the only one to outperform and defeat Patrick Mahomes in the Super Bowl. He’s one of two players, Joe Burrow being the other, to defeat Patrick Mahomes in the playoffs.\n\nIn his last four seasons as the unquestioned starter of the Eagles, Jalen Hurts has a record of 45-17 which is a better record than Joe Burrow, Lamar Jackson, and Josh Allen have during the same period. In comparison to those three quarterbacks, he has the second most passing yards in the last four seasons, the most rushing touchdowns, the third most passing touchdowns, and is tied for the second-highest completion percentage.\n\nJan 19, 2025; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA; Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Jalen Hurts (1) runs with the ball to score a touchdown against the Los Angeles Rams during the first half in a 2025 NFC divisional round game at Lincoln Financial Field. Mandatory Credit: Bill Streicher-Imagn Images\n\nSo what is the question when it comes to Jalen Hurts? The answers are all in the stats, they’re on the field and now, they’re in the record books for all eternity. You may be able to throw dirt on his name but you have to acknowledge the fact that he’s the Super Bowl MVP of the Super Bowl LIX champions. The same team that dismantled the darling sweethearts of the NFL.\n\nHe may not be the LeBron James of his era, but he mirrors several other greats that did what LeBron has struggled to consistently do and that’s win. Michael Jordan won. Derek Jeter won. Kobe Bryant won. Tom Brady won. Jalen Hurts wins.\n\nREUTERS/Mike Segar TPX IMAGES OF THE DAY",

        "fullContent": "A missing poster is displayed on a telephone pole along a closed section of Kensington Avenue as police begin clearing a homeless encampment on May 8, 2024 in Philadelphia.\n\nSign up for our Daily Email newsletter to stay up-to-date on the latest local news throughout Philadelphia.\n\nAfter nearly a decade of almost year-over-year increases in overdose deaths, the tide may finally be turning in Philadelphia.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced in May 2024 an estimated 3% decrease in overdose deaths in the U.S. in 2023 compared with 2022. Shortly after, data from the Philadelphia Department of Public Health showed a similar trend: Fatal overdoses across the city decreased 7% in 2023, from 1,207 to 1,122. The city is expected to release its 2024 data in the spring of 2025.\n\nWhile these declines are notable, the city’s 2023 fatal overdose numbers are three times higher than they were in 2013.\n\nStill, if 2024 numbers confirm the downward trend, it allows a little hope into an otherwise bleak epidemic that is killing more Philadelphians than homicides, car accidents and diabetes combined.\n\nSomething may finally be working. But what?\n\nIf over a decade spent treating and researching substance use disorders has taught me anything, it’s that the overdose epidemic is what researchers and policymakers refer to as a wicked problem. Wicked problems are constantly changing, complex, interconnected knots of other problems with no clear solution.\n\nBut let’s look at what we do know about how overdose deaths in Philadelphia spiked in the first place – and why they may finally be decreasing.\n\nWhy overdose deaths spiked\n\nThe first wave of the overdose epidemic began in the late 1990s and is attributed to overprescription of opioid pain medicines. But the largest acceleration in deaths didn’t occur until after the government and health insurers implemented prescribing controls in the early 2010s. These controls led many people who were no longer able to get prescribed opioids to turn to illicit heroin.\n\nIn a phenomenon known as the “iron law of prohibition,” stricter drug law enforcement led drug-trafficking organizations to shift from heroin toward more powerful synthetic opioids that are easier to produce, conceal and distribute. Gram for gram, pure fentanyl is over 50 times stronger than pure heroin.\n\nBut street-obtained fentanyl has proven to be anything but pure.\n\nLocal drug-testing efforts found as much as a fiftyfold difference in potency between bags of fentanyl that appear identical.\n\nThis unpredictable potency is considered to be the chief contributor to the deadliness of street fentanyl. It’s like cracking a beer and not knowing whether drinking it will get you mildly buzzed or send you to the graveyard.\n\nResearch suggests drug busts, though touted as improving public safety, can lead to more inconsistency and unpredictability in the potency of illicit opioids. An analysis of 14 studies conducted in the U.S. demonstrated a marked increase in fatal overdoses following the supply disruptions that result from drug seizures.\n\nThere’s also some evidence that the heightened economic insecurity and despair caused by the COVID-19 pandemic may have intensified the fatal overdose epidemic.\n\nPotential reasons for decline\n\nJust as economic insecurity was associated with rising deaths, the subsequent economic recovery as the U.S. emerged from the pandemic may have contributed to the 2023 drop in overdose fatalities nationwide.\n\nHowever, the unequal distribution of that recovery seems to track with worsening racial disparities in overdose rates in the late 2010s to early 2020s.\n\nAnother possible explanation for the reduction in overdose deaths is the increasing availability of buprenorphine.\n\nBuprenorphine, an FDA-approved medication for opioid use disorder, reduces withdrawal and cravings for fentanyl. What’s more, it decreases overdose risk by more than 50%.\n\nHowever, efforts to increase access to this medication have stagnated. National prescribing rates for buprenorphine were relatively stable from 2019 to 2023, and the CDC estimates that only a quarter of those who need treatment are getting it. Efforts to make buprenorphine available without a prescription have not yet gained traction.\n\nAccess to and education around naloxone, a lifesaving drug used to reverse opioid overdoses, has also increased, and the drug is increasingly being administered by bystanders. Over 1.3 million doses were distributed in Pennsylvania since 2017. National research suggests these distribution efforts, often spearheaded by local harm-reduction organizations, have led to quicker administration of naloxone. This saves lives while also decreasing reliance on emergency medical services.\n\nFinally, the consequences of a seemingly minor characteristic of fentanyl’s pharmacology might also be reducing the overdose death rate in Philadelphia.\n\nFentanyl’s effects last only a third as long as heroin. This shorter duration led drug traffickers to add the animal tranquilizer xylazine – also called “tranq” – and the veterinary anesthetic medetomidine into Philadelphia’s street drug supply. In 2019, two-thirds of heroin or fentanyl sampled in Philadelphia had xylazine in it. By 2021 all of it did.\n\nThese additives lengthen the duration of the effect, mitigate withdrawal symptoms and possibly reduce the amount of fentanyl needed per dose. Some evidence from animal studies shows that xylazine reduces fentanyl intake by suppressing fentanyl withdrawal, thereby lengthening the time before a person uses again.\n\nWhat’s more, the skin wounds and sedative effects that are associated with xylazine may be motivating some people to avoid using street fentanyl.\n\nWhat’s next for Philadelphia\n\nThe opioid settlement, a multibillion-dollar payment from the pharmaceutical industry to resolve legal actions against them, has led to increased funding in Philadelphia for naloxone and medications such as buprenorphine to treat opioid use disorder.\n\nHowever, in the past year the city eliminated funding for needle exchanges and implemented compulsory treatment strategies, which research suggests often do not reduce drug use or criminal recidividism.\n\nMeanwhile, at the federal level, Republican members of Congress have proposed cuts to Medicaid, the health insurance program for low-income Americans.\n\nWhether new data, when it’s released, will show overdose deaths in Philly have continued to decline or are back on the rise is anybody’s guess. But I do know that harm-reduction advocates, medical providers and communities of people who use drugs will continue to fight this epidemic as if their lives depend on it. For many, it does.\n\nBen Cocchiaro is an Assistant Clinical Professor of Family Medicine and Community Health at Drexel University.",

        "fullContent": "President Donald Trump listens to Robert F. Kennedy Jr. in the Oval Office of the White House, on the day Kennedy is sworn in as secretary of Health and Human Service in Washington, D.C., U.S., February 13, 2025.\n\nSign up for our Daily Email newsletter to stay up-to-date on the latest local news throughout Philadelphia.\n\nRobert F. Kennedy Jr. has been confirmed as the secretary of the US Health and Human Services Department. Put simply, this makes him the most influential figure in overseeing the health and wellbeing of more than 330 million Americans.\n\nAs health secretary, Kennedy will be involved in overseeing federal health agencies that regulate medical research, disease prevention, drug approvals and health-care programs.\n\nThis includes oversight of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the Food and Drug Administration and the National Institutes of Health, which are among the most crucial public health agencies in the country.\n\nReports suggest he’ll oversee a budget in the order of $1.8 trillion annually.\n\nIn the era of Trump 2.0, there’s little that shocks me anymore. But Kennedy would have to be the most unqualified person ever to hold this crucial role of protecting the health of the American people.\n\nA history of discounting science\n\nThe absolute minimum requirement for someone occupying such as role should be an understanding of science and respect for scientific evidence and expertise. Yet, Kennedy fails spectacularly in this regard.\n\nHere are just some of the false claims he has made over the years:\n\nKennedy has suggested Lyme disease is likely to be an engineered bioweapon\n\nHe reportedly said 99% of COVID deaths occurred in people with vitamin D deficiencies\n\nHe has questioned the role of HIV in causing AIDS.\n\nNone of these positions has even the smallest amount of scientific support.\n\nIt’s hard to predict what Kennedy will do as health secretary, especially given his confirmation hearings looked to be an exercise in being vague, evasive and denying or downplaying his prior controversial statements to secure support.\n\nBut there are three areas where his views are fairly clear and his appointment could be expected to have a significant impact. These are water fluoridation, infectious diseases research and vaccines.\n\nFluoridation of water\n\nKennedy has been a long-term opponent of water fluoridation, despite its proven benefits in preventing tooth decay. He has consistently questioned its safety and claimed it’s linked to a range of illnesses such as arthritis, bone cancer, IQ loss and neurodevelopmental disorders.\n\nWhile a recent review suggested a link between water fluoridation and lower IQ in children, the levels of fluoride in the water in countries included in this review were generally several times higher than the levels in public water fluoridation programs in countries such as the US and Australia. There were also other limitations that make interpreting these findings challenging.\n\nThe CDC has identified community water fluoridation as as one of the ten great public health achievements of the 20th century. And it continues to benefit dental health today, without any convincing evidence of possible harms.\n\nNonetheless, it seems likely that in keeping with his longstanding views one of Kennedy’s first priorities will be to try to halt water fluoridation in the US.\n\nInfectious diseases\n\nAlongside his confirmation as health secretary, US President Donald Trump signed an executive order establishing “The President’s Commission to Make America Healthy Again”, with Kennedy as the chair.\n\nThe Make America Healthy Again movement (MAHA) is an initiative driven by Kennedy focusing on improving nutrition, increasing transparency in medical practices and reducing the corporate influence in health.\n\nThough premised primarily on combating chronic diseases, the movement also embraces skepticism of established medical practices, unproven alternative therapies and a general mistrust of institutions.\n\nWhat’s more, Kennedy’s focus on chronic diseases seems to be coming at the expense of continued work on infectious diseases.\n\nHe has proposed directing the National Institutes of Health to pause infectious disease research for eight years to prioritize research into chronic diseases and alternative treatments.\n\nAs health secretary, Kennedy has the power to shift research priorities. If he were to effectively halt infectious diseases research – in the wake of COVID and with a looming threat of future pandemics – this would be catastrophic for the US and global health.\n\nVaccine scepticism\n\nRelated to infectious diseases, there’s little doubt the area in which Kennedy has done the most damage relates to vaccines.\n\nHe has dedicated a large part of his life to undermining public confidence in vaccines. This is despite overwhelming scientific evidence demonstrating their safety and effectiveness, and the millions of lives they’ve saved.\n\nAlthough he has subsequently denied it, Kennedy is on record as falsely stating there is no such thing as a safe and effective vaccine. Notably, he has continued to push the debunked claim that the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine is linked to autism, despite the single study finding this having been widely discredited.\n\nKennedy’s frequent assertion that he’s not anti-vaccine, but “pro-safety”, is also deeply disingenuous. Being “pro-safety” is a deliberately vague notion designed to appear reasonable while at the same time undermining the scientific evidence.\n\nThe impact of Kennedy’s appointment as health secretary on vaccine confidence will not just be limited to the US. Vaccine hesitancy has been recognized as one of the greatest threats to public health. Having a vaccine sceptic leading the US health agencies has the potential to harm vaccine uptake worldwide.\n\nAs we’ve seen during the COVID pandemic, producing a vaccine is only half the battle. Convincing people to take it is just as important. There’s no doubt Kennedy’s influence on public health messaging could further erode vaccine confidence at a time when vaccine messaging must be clear.\n\nBad news for the US and the world\n\nOne of the reasons Kennedy poses such a threat to public health in the US and globally is his lack of trust in science. He believes a narrative can be crafted by picking and choosing any study that fits with his world view, regardless of its quality.\n\nIn addition, he personifies the bad-faith tactics of conspiracy theorists globally, “selling” the flawed premise that any assertion is valid until others prove it false.\n\nWhat the world needs now is a safe pair of hands leading public health in the US. Someone who is guided by evidence – not someone who promotes anti-science propaganda and conspiracy theories.\n\nHassan Vally is an Associate Professor of Epidemiology at Deakin University.",

        "fullContent": "Sign up for our email newsletter to stay up-to-date on the latest local sports news throughout Philadelphia.\n\nPitchers and catchers have all made their way down to beautiful Clearwooder for their spring training preparation. We are that much closer to baseball season, meaning we’re so close to hearing “BEER, BEER, BEER, BEER, BEEEEEEER” on our televisions for a month.\n\nThe Phillies were relatively quiet this offseason and lost pitchers Jeff Hoffman (Blue Jays) and Carlos Estévez (Royals) to free agency. Fans have questions about the roster, and we have answers! I teamed up with fellow Philadelphia Sports Network writer Shaun Nestor to answer some of those questions.\n\nWhich Phillies reliever will lead the team in saves at the end of the year?\n\nKylee: I’ll have to go with Orion Kerkering. Before I go into this, I want to make it clear I have a ton of faith in Jordan Romano. I just believe Kerkering will take that big of a leap forward and be the backbone that the Phillies need following Jeff Hoffman’s departure to Toronto.\n\nShaun: This may not be the popular answer, but I think Jordan Romano does the job there. Especially in Rob Thomson’s system of “bullpen by committee,” Romano’s experience will get him the bulk of the action while Jose Alvarado, Orion Kerkering, Matt Strahm, and others get their time in the 9th as well.\n\nPredict a Phillies trade deadline addition\n\nKylee: I think the Phillies will go after a relief pitcher. I don’t think it’ll be a high-end reliever because I believe Romano and Kerkering will take over, but more options in relief can’t possibly do any harm.\n\nShaun: You know, nothing stands out as a huge need to be filled at the trade deadline yet to me. But I’m going to go out on a limb here: a package likely involving one of Miller, Crawford, or Tait to the Brewers for Devin Williams and Rhys Hoskins. Spicy enough for you?\n\nAug 15, 2024; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA; Philadelphia Phillies outfielder Johan Rojas (18) hits an RBI single during the fourth inning against the Washington Nationals at Citizens Bank Park. Mandatory Credit: Bill Streicher-USA TODAY Sports\n\nAre there any position battles in camp?\n\nKylee: The obvious one is centerfield with Brandon Marsh and Johan Rojas, but you could argue the closer role has a position battle. As it stands, Jordan Romano is expected to have the Jeff Hoffman/main closer role, but I wouldn’t be surprised to see Orion Kerkering have a shot at the spot if Romano starts slow.\n\nShaun: If anything, Brandon Marsh and Johan Rojas will battle for the center field job, but I fully expect that to remain at the status quo with a platoon.\n\nWhat prospects not named Andrew Painter can you see getting called up this season?\n\nKylee: I would be very shocked to see Justin Crawford and Aidan Miller up this season. Dave Dombrowski already said he sees Miller as a 2026 at-best guy. With that in mind, I would expect to see Mick Abel up at some point. I don’t think he’ll make it right out of camp, but I see it happening by the trade deadline.\n\nShaun: Technically I expect Mick Abel will make the Phillies bullpen out of camp, but that’s not really what this question is asking. If anything, I would expect Jean Cabrera, Seth Johnson, or Griff McGarry to come up at some point to fill in for an injury here or there, but I wouldn’t get my hopes up for Aidan Miller or Justin Crawford just yet.\n\nMandatory Credit: Jonathan Dyer-Imagn Images",

        "fullContent": "A view of the Stonewall Inn from Christopher Park, which is also the home of the Stonewall National Monument.\n\nSign up for our Gay City News email newsletter to get news, updates, and local insights delivered straight to your inbox!\n\nCommunity members protested at Christopher Park on Feb. 14 after the National Park Service removed references to transgender individuals from its online website, representing just the latest example of the Trump administration’s overwhelming quest to erase transgender individuals from American life.\n\n“Before the 1960s, almost everything about living openly as a lesbian, gay, bisexual (LGB) person was illegal,” the National Park Service’s website says, as of the morning of Feb. 14. “The Stonewall Uprising on June 28, 1969 is a milestone in the quest for LGB civil rights and provided momentum for a movement.”\n\nThe move, which involved deleting TQ+ from LGBTQ+, appeared to align the National Park Service with President Donald Trump’s blatantly transphobic executive order recognizing only male and female genders according to an individual’s gender assigned at birth.\n\nThe Stonewall National Monument is located within Christopher Park and was designated in 2016 by former President Barack Obama as the first federal monument dedicated to the LGBTQ community.\n\nThe updates to the National Park Service’s website immediately prompted widespread anger from community members and elected officials, leading to the Christopher Park demonstration.\n\n“I’m not going to allow any government, any organization, any person to take away the joy that I feel as a trans person,” Berne Wagenblast, who is one of the voices of the New York City subway system. Wagenblast delighted the crowd by repeating one of her most-heard lines: “Please stand away from the platform edge.”\n\nOut gay State Senator Brad Hoylman-Sigal, who represents the area encompassing the Stonewall Inn, said the decision to remove trans references from the website amounts to “one of the darkest moments in American history.”\n\nHoylman-Sigal said the Trump administration is seeking to rewrite history and discriminate against an entire population of Americans.\n\n“This decision cannot stand,” Hoylman-Sigal stated, adding: “I pledge to continue to work harder than ever to further enshrine the rights of transgender New Yorkers in state and city law.”\n\nAnother out gay lawmaker, Councilmember Erik Bottcher, who also represents the area around the Stonewall Inn, similarly blasted the move.\n\n“Trump is trying to erase the very existence of transgender people,” Bottcher wrote on X. “He’s trying to cleave our community apart and divide us. He’s not going to succeed. Lesbians and gays are not going to abandon our transgender siblings. We are one community.”\n\nNew York Gov. Kathy Hochul also criticized the change, describing it as “cruel and petty.”\n\n“Transgender people play a critical role in the fight for LGBTQ+ rights — and New York will never allow their contributions to be erased,” Hochul wrote on X.\n\nSenator Chuck Schumer of New York, the minority leader, said, “This move to try to erase transgender people from the Stonewall National Monument is cruel, pathetic, and historically inaccurate. Transgender New Yorkers played a critical role in the events at Stonewall and in the movement for equality that it inspired. The Park Service should reverse themselves immediately.”\n\nStacy Lentz, a co-owner of the Stonewall Inn, told Gay City News on Feb. 14 that although the move wasn’t necessarily surprising given who occupies the White House, it still hits the community hard.\n\n“It’s painful and it’s unacceptable that they want to erase an entire part of the community,” Lentz said, acknowledging the participation of transgender individuals in the Stonewall Uprising. “To have them come into our house — it’s alarming. This should be alarming to everyone, not just the LGBTQ community.”\n\nAngelica Christina, an out trans board member of the Stonewall Inn Gives Back Initiative, which is the charitable arm of the Stonewall Inn, told Gay City News she is “entirely offended” and “disgusted” by the federal government’s erasure of the trans community.\n\n“What we’re seeing right now is the erasure of LGBTQIA+ history, and American history,” Christina said. “What we’re witnessing right now is an attempted gendercide of trans folks.”\n\nThe Office of Mayor Eric Adams, who has developed close ties with President Trump, offered an indirect answer when asked by Gay City News to comment on the National Park Service’s transphobic move.\n\n“We remain steadfast in our commitment to fostering a safe, inclusive, and affirming environment where every person can thrive,” a spokesperson for Adams told Gay City News. “Here in New York City, our policies have not changed at our schools or at our hospitals and we will continue to provide care for all, regardless of race, gender, religion or sexual orientation.”\n\nMark Segal, a Stonewall veteran who is the founder and publisher of the Philadelphia Gay News, called on community members to remember this moment as the beginning of the second Stonewall Rebellion.\n\n“The spirit of Stonewall means to be visible and fight back against oppression,” Segal said in a written statement. “You cannot erase the history of Stonewall by erasing a letter. You cannot erase trans people by erasing a letter. This petty, vindictive action is an attempt to not only erase trans people from public view, but also the entire LGBT community. Stonewall, including all of us in the LGBT community who fought back that historic night and have continued to fight for 55 years, cannot and will not be erased. We will continue to fight, we will continue to be visible and persevere…”\n\nLentz, who said the federal government had not communicated anything to her, is calling on members of the public to visit the National Park Service’s website and navigate to a page where folks can voice their concerns.\n\nFor now, though, she wants folks to step up and join in.\n\n“I think we’re seeing a lot of complacency, especially a lot of leadership in the Democratic Party,” Lentz said. “Pride started as a protest. We want to make sure our voices are being heard.”\n\nThe National Park Service did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nBelow are some more photos from the Feb. 14 demonstration at Stonewall:",

REUTERS/Rachel Wisniewski\n\nSign up for our email newsletter to stay up-to-date on the latest local sports news throughout Philadelphia.\n\nIn case you were unable to head to today’s Philadelphia Eagles Super Bowl parade, or just want to relive some of the incredible highs and chaotic events from Friday’s celebration, we’ve created your ultimate guide to the teams’ remarkable gathering in the heart of the City.\n\nFans poured onto the streets in the early hours of Friday morning, lining the roads in anticipation of their beloved Birds parading the Lombardi Trophy once again. It didn’t take long for the fun to begin. From police officers running their own iteration of the ‘Tush Push’, to fans cheering busses filled with other random fans, it was certainly a day to remember.\n\nHowie Roseman stole the show before even getting to the stage. The esteemed GM sported a cut at the top of his head after what many assume to be a clash with a beer can. After smoking a cigar in what might go down as one of the coldest pictures of the entire day, Roseman took to the stage outside the Art Museum to tell fans he ‘BLEEDS for this city’, and he meant it quite literally.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/sportscenter/status/1890498731453083708?s=61&t=7BbLnpr1DB45SPN7vMZwFQ\n\nThe Eagles soar down Broad Street\n\nThe players had their fair share of wholesome moments. Zack Baun signed someone’s baby, while Nolan Smith lifted a small child atop his shoulders while walking down and greeting ecstatic fans.\n\nSaquon Barkley found one of the teams’ ball boys in the crowd, lifting him over the barrier and inviting him into the parade with the rest of the team. As soon as you think you can’t love that man any more, he finds yet another new way to make you smile from ear to ear.\n\nDallas Goedert shotgunned a beer in front of the fans, which became a common theme for the day.\n\nQuinyon Mitchell was particularly excitable, screaming ‘GO EAGLES’ into the microphone of a Fox 29 reporter. James Bradberry played a great veteran role in running over to keep things moderately tame, but there was no stopping Landon Dickerson’s passion…\n\nhttps://twitter.com/brendendeeg_/status/1890448027501875316?s=61&t=7BbLnpr1DB45SPN7vMZwFQ\n\nThe dominant lineman would go on to drop the speech of the day, stating how he’s ‘never played an away game in his whole career’, attesting to the passion of the travelling Eagles fans.\n\nFeb 14, 2025; Philadelphia, PA, USA; Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Jalen Hurts holds the Vince Lombardi Trophy during the Super Bowl LIX championship parade and rally. Mandatory Credit: Kirby Lee-Imagn Images\n\nOther notable quotes\n\nA.J Brown’s speech to the City of Philadelphia was a sensational one. He gave the World a ‘mic drop’ moment, reminding everyone about the criticisms he’s faced since signing with the team.\n\n‘They said I was a diva. They said all I care about was stats. Well, if you’re gonna say all those things, get one thing right… I’m a f**king champion!’\n\nThe ‘Exciting Whites’ took to the stage with hefty applause and to the backdrop of ‘dreams and nightmares’. I don’t think the Eagles can ever break that tandem up now…\n\nJalen Hurts was the man of the moment and who a lot fans couldn’t wait to hear from. After returning from his Disney World trip and seeing the iconic ‘LOVE’ statue be upgraded with a ‘,Hurts’ feature, the Super Bowl MVP greeted fans warmly before stating how he promised himself he wouldn’t visit the Rocky steps until he won a championship. He can safely tick that one off the bucket list.\n\nThe Super Bowl parade wouldn’t be complete without a little chaos from CJGJ!\n\nhttps://twitter.com/sluggahjells/status/1890493030043398646?s=61&t=7BbLnpr1DB45SPN7vMZwFQ\n\nAnd of course, the iconic Eagles fanbase was out in full force, draping the streets in kelly green and showing their passion for the team in some brilliant ways:\n\nBeating the shit out of Kermit on Broad Street #EaglesParade pic.twitter.com/zjSm9WyOdw — Dalai Loml (@thealexbasso) February 14, 2025\n\nWe also want to send our thoughts to those impacted by the shootings at today’s Super Bowl parade. It’s absolutely heartbreaking that this took place on such a magical day. According to USA Today, both women were taken to the hospital and were described as stable.\n\nREUTERS/Rachel Wisniewski",

        "source": "https://metrophiladelphia.com/",
        "fullContent": "Nov 16, 2024; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA; Philadelphia Flyers defenseman Emil Andrae (36) reaches for the puck against the Buffalo Sabres in the second period at Wells Fargo Center. Mandatory Credit: Kyle Ross-Imagn Images\n\nSign up for our email newsletter to stay up-to-date on the latest local sports news throughout Philadelphia.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Philadelphia Flyers’ forwards were given player grades as the 4 Nations Face-Off break arrived. Now, it’s time to take a look at how the defensemen and goaltenders have fared, as we are just crossing over the halfway point of the 2024-25 season.\n\nThe Flyers’ defense has been quite stable so far. Travis Sanheim, who is representing Team Canada at the 4 Nations Face-Off, has solidified himself as the Flyers’ No. 1 defenseman. Cam York continues to make positive strides and is preparing himself for a payday this summer, and Rasmus Ristolainen has mightily improved on the defensive side of the puck. Ristolainen did make Team Finland for the 4 Nations Face-Off, but he won’t play due to injury.\n\nLooking at the goaltending, it’s certainly been tough sledding. Samuel Ersson, representing Team Sweden at the 4 Nations Face-Off, has had his ups and downs this year but has provided stability between the pipes since the Christmas break. Ivan Fedotov and Aleksei Kolosov have struggled more than succeeded, but that was to be expected in their first full seasons in North America.\n\nHere are player grades for the Flyers’ defensemen and goaltenders thus far in 2024-25:\n\nFlyers defensemen\n\nTravis Sanheim: A\n\nSanheim has proved he’s the Flyers’ top defenseman and is also proving that his long-term extension signed by former general manager Chuck Fletcher was worth the price.\n\nSanheim ranks first in points by Flyers defensemen with 27 (6G, 21A) and first overall in ice-time, averaging 24:34 per game. He scored 44 points during 2023-24 and is on pace to meet similar numbers this year. On a true contending team, Sanheim would probably be the #2 or #3 defenseman, but on the Flyers, he’s the top guy and has been solid all around this year.\n\nJamie Drysdale: B\n\nJamie Drysdale was going to be one of the main players to watch this season regarding development. He played injured throughout most of his first Flyers season in 2023-24 and underwent surgery in the offseason.\n\nHe started this season a bit slow and suffered an upper-body injury that saw him miss 12 games. But since returning from injury, he’s been one of the team’s best defensemen. He’s showing his offensive capabilities and has thrived since facing his former team, the Anaheim Ducks, on Jan. 11 at the Wells Fargo Center.\n\nDrysdale has the opportunity to play a pivotal role in the Flyers’ future, and he’s starting to put all of the pieces in the right places.\n\nFeb 8, 2025; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA; Philadelphia Flyers defenseman Jamie Drysdale (9) grabs Pittsburgh Penguins left wing Danton Heinen (43) during a shot in the third period at Wells Fargo Center. Mandatory Credit: Kyle Ross-Imagn Images\n\nRasmus Ristolainen: B-\n\nEven if Ristolainen doesn’t return to the offensive producer he was in his junior career and Buffalo, he’s stepped up his defensive game massively since being a member of the Flyers. All credit for his improved defense goes to associate coach Brad Shaw.\n\nRistolainen has 15 points (2G, 13A) in 54 games this year and is on pace to set a career-high in points in his Flyers career. He registered 20 points (3G, 17A) during 2022-23. He’s been placed in every situation over the last few months, ranging from powerplay time to seeing the ice in overtime.\n\nHis name has been brought up in trade rumors as the trade deadline approaches, so we’ll see what his future looks like. If he stays or goes, he’s become a sound defensive player in Philadelphia.\n\nNick Seeler makes a visible difference when he’s in the lineup compared to being out. He has 13 points (3G, 10A) in 52 games played and is one point shy of tying a career high that he set with the Flyers in 2022-23.\n\nHe gives his all every game and is never afraid to step up and defend his teammates physically. Seeler plays a solid and tough defensive game and has revived his career since joining Philadelphia.\n\nJan 2, 2025; Las Vegas, Nevada, USA; Vegas Golden Knights defenseman Nicolas Hague (14) banks a shot off the stick of Philadelphia Flyers defenseman Nick Seeler (24) to score a goal against goaltender Aleksei Kolosov (35) during the second period at T-Mobile Arena. Mandatory Credit: Stephen R. Sylvanie-Imagn Images\n\nCam York: C+\n\nYork is due for a contract extension this summer. His two-year, $3.2 million deal that he signed on July 10, 2023, will expire.\n\nYork ranks second overall in ice-time on the roster, averaging 21:14 per game. He has turned into a player willing to put his body on the line, having blocked 84 shots this year. He does experience some inconsistencies at times, but when his game is on, watch out.\n\nHe was scratched by John Tortorella against the Los Angeles Kings on Dec. 19, showing that nobody is safe from watching a game in the press box on occasion. It will be interesting to see what numbers Daniel Briere presents York in the off-season regarding a new contract.\n\nEmil Andrae has suited up in 24 games this year, scoring six points (1G, 5A). He’s mostly stepped in for injured defensemen, being recalled from the Lehigh Valley Phantoms, and has been one of the better defensemen at times.\n\nYou can make the argument that he’s also outshined York at times. Both players are left-handed defensemen. Andrae appears to have a permanent spot on the Flyers’ blue line in the future, and he’s turned some heads multiple times this season.\n\nErik Johnson: D\n\nErik Johnson mostly steps in when an injury occurs. He signed a one-year extension with the Flyers last summer and will most likely be gone at the end of the season.\n\nHe plays a large mentorship role in the locker room with the younger players. His veteran presence and Stanley Cup-winning mentality doesn’t go unnoticed.\n\nEgor Zamula: D\n\nEgor Zamula has had a rough season. He’s struggled both on offense and defense and is prone to making many mistakes. He has 11 points (3G, 8A) in 39 games.\n\nIt’s unclear what Zamula’s future looks like in Philadelphia, especially with the emergence of Andrae. He was placed on the injured reserve on Jan. 31.\n\nFlyers goalies\n\nSamuel Ersson: B\n\nIn 31 games played, Ersson is 16-10-3. He holds a 2.82 GAA and a .890SV%. He’s easily been the best out of the bunch this year and will be the Flyers’ No. 1 goalie moving forward.\n\nSince returning from the Christmas break, Ersson is 9-4-1 with a 2.26 GAA and a .920SV%. He’s been dominant even in recent losses to the Colorado Avalanche and Utah Hockey Club.\n\nErsson will serve as the third goaltender for Sweden in the 4 Nations Face-Off.\n\nJan 23, 2025; New York, New York, USA; New York Rangers center Filip Chytil (72) (not pictured) scores a goal past Philadelphia Flyers goaltender Samuel Ersson (33) during the third period at Madison Square Garden. Mandatory Credit: Dennis Schneidler-Imagn Images\n\nIvan Fedotov: C-\n\nIn 17 games played, Fedotov is 4-8-1, carrying a 3.26 GAA and .877SV%. It’s been a rocky year for Fedotov, and he has cost the Flyers at times in games. He has made some slick saves but has been underwhelming.\n\nAleksei Kolosov: C-\n\nSimilar to Fedotov, Kolosov was also underwhelming in his stint with the team this year. It’s still his first year playing hockey in North America, like Fedotov, so there are adjustments still being learned.\n\nIn 15 games played, Kolosov is 4-8-1 with a 3.45 GAA and .870SV%. He’s also seen some struggles with the Phantoms, so development is the #1 priority for him.\n\nMandatory Credit: Kyle Ross-Imagn Images",

Philly is ramping up its rebuilding year with a new coach and a host of new and hungry players. Can this Union team compete with the rest of MLS after missing the playoffs for the first time in years last year? If so, it’ll need its attack to be on point.\n\nIf it’s one area that Philadelphia has struggled in in their 16 years worth of existence, it’s been getting consistent attacking play. There have always been great players in their attack, but consistency has been the difference between success and failure. Look at the 2022 season as an example; that team scored 79 goals, which was Philly’s best attacking year statistically. As the club moves into 2025, there is uncertainty about what this attack can produce; there is talent, but will it be enough to make this team a contender?\n\nMandatory Credit: Philadelphia Union\n\nPhiladelphia Union Strikers\n\nOver the last few seasons, we have seen Philly bolster its strikers with its patented type of signings. They have found diamonds in the rough with the potential to ball out. Think Julian Carranza, Mikael Uhre, and Tai Baribo. All three of those players were crucial to Philly’s success. Now, Carranza is gone, and Baribo and Uhre are the big guns. The Union is hoping they don’t show a decline in 2025. Here’s a look at them and the other strikers on the roster.\n\nMarkus Anderson\n\nTai Baribo\n\n*Bruno Damiani*\n\nEddy Davis\n\nChris Donovan\n\nNelson Pierre\n\nMikael Uhre\n\nAside from Mikael Uhre and Tai Baribo, the rest of the striker core features some homegrown (Eddy Davis and Nelson Pierre) and young strikers not ready to take the mantle of starter (Chris Donovan and Markus Anderson.) The only other name on the list is Bruno Damiani. He is not yet a Union player, but the 22-year-old Uruguayan is said to be finalizing a move to Philly; he’d be the club’s record signing with a few of over $3 million for his services. Will his addition help the Union’s attack go from good to great?\n\nMandatory Credit: Philadelphia Union\n\nWhat can this Union attack be?\n\nIf the rumors are true and Damiani comes in as a DP-level striker, then he will join Uhre and Gazdag as Philadelphia’s Designated players. That could be a fierce attack, and when you factor in Baribo’s form last year (and his 16 goals from 26 matches), this Philly attack could be a strength of the team.\n\nYet again, it will come down to the team’s ability to execute. Can they be ruthless in attack using a counter-attacking system, or will it take time for the attack to start firing? We have seen Philly be hot-and-cold to start seasons before. What can they conjure up for 2025? I guess we will have to wait and see when the first ball is kicked on February 22nd!\n\nSep 18, 2024; New York, New York, USA; Philadelphia Union midfielder Daniel Gazdag (10) celebrates after scoring a goal against New York City FC with forward Tai Baribo (28) during the first half at Yankee Stadium.

        "source": "https://metrophiladelphia.com/",
        "fullContent": "Sign up for our email newsletter to stay up-to-date on the latest local sports news throughout Philadelphia.\n\nEagles’ star running back, Saquon Barkley got caught up in the moment. Blame it on the alcohol.\n\nSitting at the post-game podium, with his Super Bowl champions shirt on and hat flipped to the side — along with his two beautiful kids on his lap — daughter, Jada; son, Saquon Jr. — the NFL Offensive Player of the Year contemplated the future of the Eagles’ franchise, specifically saying: “Why not start our dynasty now?”\n\nBarkley uttered it twice, in two different settings. And why not? The Eagles are young. They are motivated. They own the most talented roster in football. They are humble yet hungry. Most importantly, they are the reigning world champions.\n\nBut, speaking dynasties into existence doesn’t necessarily make them true. Winning one Lombardi Trophy is the toughest row to hoe in sports, something that Barkley understands better than anyone and went on record to clear up.\n\n“I said after the game, why can’t our dynasty start now … I probably had a little bit of champagne and some other stuff in my system at the time but you really can’t focus on that,” Barkley said during a press conference at Raising Cane’s in Trevose, PA. “You gotta enjoy the moment, it’s hard to win one … you take it in, you enjoy the moment, and you start over … and it kind of starts over after Friday.”\n\nFriday is the Eagles’ Championship Parade, a joyous jaunt down Broad Street on what is sure to be the greenest Valentine’s Day in city history. A million fans are expected to turn out for the second parade in seven years.\n\n“There’s been a lot of adversity, a lot of ups and downs,” Barkley said, “but it is the perfect timing to do it here, to do it as a part of this city, and with these fans, it’s truly amazing.”\n\nJudging by the crowd at Raising Cane’s — approximately 1,000 people showed up on a random Thursday to cheer on Barkley as he worked the drive-thru line and served up chicken fingers at the counter — it’s going to be a mess. A beautiful, verdurous, unapologetically awesome mess of humanity.\n\nBarkley is ready for it. All of it.\n\n“I don’t know what to expect,” Barkley said. “The Philly fans have been amazing all year round, just the love and support that they have for this team. This city truly buys into this team, you could see it there [as he pointed to the parking lot at Raising Cane’s], look how many people showed up. I’m expecting it to be a blast, a party.”\n\nThe last time the masses hijacked Broad Street, Jason Kelce took center stage in that obnoxious Mummers costume and morphed into Maximus. His speech was the stuff of legend. So, which Eagles player will provide the encore?\n\n“It won’t be me, I can guarantee you that,” Barkley said. “That’s not my thing. If I had to pick one I would say either Lane Johnson or BG [Brandon Graham]. And I think they are the two longest-tenured Eagles right now … so, I think it would just be perfect for one of those two to do that, especially if it is BG. Last game with us and last year, for him to go out with a bang, I think that would be pretty cool.”\n\nDream Starts Over: After the Eagles’ Ring Ceremony\n\nFootball – NFL – Super Bowl LIX – Philadelphia Eagles v Kansas City Chiefs – Caesars Superdome, New Orleans, Louisiana, United States – February 9, 2025 Philadelphia Eagles’ Saquon Barkley celebrates with the Vince Lombardi Trophy after winning Super Bowl LIX REUTERS/Mike Segar\n\nA.J. Brown said the euphoria from winning Super Bowl 59 lasted two days, then it was “back to work.” DeVonta Smith has echoed that sentiment in recent interviews, with Jalen Hurts saying the same thing in private conversations.\n\nSaquon Barkley said he’ll enjoy the championship parade — “shoot for the stars and land on the moon,” is his favorite saying — but then it’s back to the drawing board. The Eagles are starting from scratch. The Super Bowl ring ceremony is the only thing left to celebrate on the offseason calendar.\n\n“Whenever the ring ceremony is, that’s probably the last day we truly celebrate being a Super Bowl champion and then it’s back to work,” Barkley said. “Two nights ago I had a hard time sleeping because I’m thinking about how I’m going to attack the offseason because you kind of get — greedy’s not the word — but addicted to it. You want to find a way how you can hold that Lombardi up again and do it all over again.”\n\n(The Eagles were fitted for their Super Bowl rings later in the day. The ceremony will probably be in June sometime, at least that’s when they did it in 2018).\n\n“So, you take it in, you cherish it,” Barkley continued. “You enjoy it, you appreciate the fans but the dynasty thing … you can’t really get caught up in that, and the way you do that is by putting the work in. There’s a reason why we won, it’s not by accident, so we gotta try and do it all over again next year.”\n\nThere’s that dynasty thing again. It’s not a bad word. It’s not overconfidence or cockiness. It’s just the reality of the thing.\n\n“Dream starts over,” Barkley said.\n\nPartnering Up with Todd Graves at Raising Cane’s\n\nFeb 9, 2025; New Orleans, LA, USA; Philadelphia Eagles wide receiver DeVonta Smith (6) celebrates with running back Saquon Barkley (26) after scoring a touchdown against the Kansas City Chiefs during the second half of Super Bowl LIX at Caesars Superdome. Mandatory Credit: Geoff Burke-Imagn Images\n\nBarkley’s appearance at Raising Cane’s in Trevose, PA on Thursday (February 13) wasn’t by accident. The superstar running back struck up a friendship with owner Todd Graves at a Formula One racing event in Miami earlier this year. Then, Graves traveled to the Super Bowl in New Orleans to cheer on Barkley and the Eagles from a suite.\n\n“It was amazing watching Saquon, Jalen and the team win the Super Bowl on Sunday night,” Graves said. “It was a great game and seeing Saquon hold the Lombardi Trophy and be named Offensive Player of the Year all within his first season with Philly was great.”\n\nThat bond turned into a partnership. Barkley didn’t just show up to Raising Cane’s for a quick photo opportunity. No, the 28-year-old took orders at the counter and handed out chicken fingers at the drive-thru. He also participated in a lengthy commercial shoot for the fast-food chain, delivering scripted lines like: “You know the secret to winning rings? Good fingers. Like Raising Cane’s chicken fingers. Tastes like victory!”\n\nBarkley also poured out samples of a new green lemonade that Raising Cane’s concocted to honor the Eagles’ Super Bowl win. The refreshing drink is a limited-time offering at area restaurants.\n\n“I loved working the drive-thru with Todd,” said Barkley. “The first time I came to Cane’s was in Charlotte with my teammates. My favorite thing to eat is the Box Combo – you can never go wrong with chicken fingers and fries.”\n\nREUTERS/Mike Segar",

Mandatory Credit: Gregory Fisher-Imagn Images\n\nSign up for our email newsletter to stay up-to-date on the latest local sports news throughout Philadelphia.\n\nEverybody loves a good story, and every story needs a beginning. Spring training is just that: the beginning. Everything we love about baseball starts as soon as pitchers and catchers report.\n\nSo in 2025, what stories should we be watching as the spring unfolds in central Florida?\n\nPhillies Injury Report\n\nWhen players return from injury, there’s only one thing on everyone’s mind. Will they come back to the top of their game? The Phillies have a handful of players reportedly on the mend, looking for a rebound.\n\nMost of their offseason acquisitions fit into this category. New left fielder Max Kepler reportedly had a core injury that hampered his 2024 campaign. Potential closer Jordan Romano had arthroscopic surgery on his right elbow last summer. Presumed 5th starter Jesús Luzardo started just 12 games in 2024, dealing with a back injury.\n\nAll of them will be under close observation as February leaks into March.\n\nOn top of the new additions, Bryson Stott will also be under inspection. The young second baseman reportedly dealt with an elbow injury for most of 2024. Whether the injury affected him or not, Stott saw a .035 dip in his batting average from 2023 to 2024. It’ll be a pivotal year for Stott’s career.\n\nOct 6, 2024; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA; Philadelphia Phillies second base Bryson Stott (5) hits a triple in the eighth inning against the New York Mets during game two of the NLDS for the 2024 MLB Playoffs at Citizens Bank Park. Mandatory Credit: Bill Streicher-Imagn Images\n\nWrapping up offseason drama\n\nAn Alec Bohm trade almost felt inevitable with all the noise emanating from multiple media outlets. We’re now in the middle of February, and the Phillies’ 3rd baseman is still here.\n\nAwkward.\n\nEveryone wants to hear Bohm’s side of the story. Will he follow the path of the disgruntled Scott Rolen, or will he continue like nothing happened? The public cannot wait to hear from the 2024 All-Star with amazing hair.\n\nA Japanese Import?\n\nOne of the most under-the-radar Phillies moves of the offseason has to be the minor league deal struck with veteran Japanese pitcher Koyo Aoyagi. The deal had some history to it as Aoyagi became the first major player the Phillies have signed directly from Japan.\n\nAoyagi, a 31-year-old with sidearm action, was fairly accomplished in Japan. He had an even 3 ERA pitching in Japan with a 3 ERA in 2024. Koyo is currently dealing with Visa issues as he tries to get to Clearwater to start camp. The expectation is that he will arrive by the end of the week if all documentation issues are resolved.\n\nWhile he isn’t expected to be a major contributor for the Phillies, if Koyo finds success, it could lead to more doors opening in the Land of the Rising Sun.\n\nMandatory Credit: Gregory Fisher-Imagn Images",

As a release notes, the evening will be a collaboration of Gullah Geechee cuisine infused with Ember & Ash’s live-fire cooking techniques, including ingredients grown at Gilliard Farms—the 50-acre homestead was purchased by Matthew’s great-great-great-grandfather and freed slave Jupiter Gilliard in 1874 for $9.\n\nWhile there, diners will be able to indulge in dishes like shrimp toast with saffron coconut rice and pickled okra; head hash terrine with fennel and citrus; smoked grouper with middlin risotto and hoja santa; sweet potato olive oil cake; and more. Seating times are 5, 6 and 7 p.m., and the dinner comes out to be $95 per person (plus tax and gratuity). Reservations are available now via Resy.\n\n“We’ve wanted to do a collaboration with longtime friends Scott and Lulu Calhoun of Ember & Ash for a while, as my ties to Philly run deep,” explained Tia in a statement. Both Scott and Tia worked with chef Marc Vetri at Lo Spiedo, and Tia was the culinary director for his nonprofit, Vetri Community Partnership from 2012 to 2014.\n\nThe Raifords, who were Culinary Institute of America grads, decided to switch gears to take their culinary skills to their historic farm in rural Georgia with a mission in mind: To “engage the world with African American foodways, revive the holistic practices of their ancestors, and help to feed their diverse community high-quality, locally-grown organic produce that are sustainably farmed.”\n\nAs a release notes, the couple believes in cultivating the land and pioneering a return to the regenerative practices of their forefathers — the Freshwater Gullah Geechee, who were direct descendants of West Africans brought to the U.S. as slaves for their expertise in rice and indigo cultivation.\n\nThis Black History Month celebration will continue with the Bookers event on the 26. Titled “A Great Migration Dinner,” Matthew will be using his skills as a historian and climate change activist to lead guests through a multi-course dinner and discussion recounting the history of the movement to the urban North by six million southern Blacks between 1910 and 1970. The James Beard semi-finalist and author of ‘Bress ‘n’ Nyam’ will also delve into how they brought their rich culinary traditions to a new life in the Northeast, Midwest, and West.\n\nHighlighted dishes span a pickled vegetable plate with Jamaican-style spinach patties, De Wata (salmon croquettes with red rice and herb salad),Win’ – Poulet Yassa (Senegalese style lemon pepper chicken with vegan teff stew), sweet potato pone with toasted walnut semifreddo and more. There will also be two De Spirits (complimentary cocktails) — a Gullah Geechie Gin Rickey or an alcohol-free hibiscus and lime spritzer.\n\n“Many African Americans’ roots can be traced to the Great Migration, including our own families,” said Cheri and Tracey Syphax from Booker’s restaurant in a statement. “We thought it would be a no-brainer to have Matthew join us for this special event, especially during Black History Month, given the fact that the namesake of our restaurant Booker Wright, is a famous waiter who worked in a whites-only restaurant in the 1960s Mississippi while also running his restaurant that catered to black customers.”\n\nThe dinner starts at 6 p.m. and costs $75 per person (plus tax and gratuity).\n\nTo find out more information on “From Georgia with Love”, visit emberandashphilly.com and bookersrestaurantandbar.com",

        "fullContent": "Sign up for our email newsletter to stay up-to-date on the latest local sports news throughout Philadelphia.\n\nThe Philadelphia 76ers are set to convert recently acquired guard Jared Butler to a standard NBA contract, according to ESPN’s Shams Charania. The former second-round pick started this season on a two-way deal with the Washington Wizards before being traded to the Sixers, along with four second-round picks, in exchange for Reggie Jackson and an extremely unfavorable 2026 first-round pick.\n\nSince joining the Sixers, Butler has averaged 10.0 points and 4.7 assists a night, quickly establishing himself as another piece of the Sixers’ potential young core. Given Jared McCain‘s season-ending injury and the new knee injury that kept star guard Tyrese Maxey from playing against the Brooklyn Nets, converting Butler to a standard deal will provide some more stability in head coach Nick Nurse’s guard rotation.\n\nFeb 9, 2025; Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA; Philadelphia 76ers guard Jared Butler (12) drives for the basket against Milwaukee Bucks forward Bobby Portis (9) during the second quarter at Fiserv Forum. Mandatory Credit: Jeff Hanisch-Imagn Images\n\nButler has spent time with the Utah Jazz, the Oklahoma City Thunder, and the aforementioned Washington Wizards before finally landing this contract with the Sixers. The former Baylor guard got his start in the NBA after being selected at pick 40 in the 2021 NBA draft but has not been able to find a steady place to call home.\n\nThe search for that home may be over as the Sixers’s dismal season and proven track record at developing young, overlooked players provide the most stable breeding ground for Butler’s success. The Sixers will need to clear a roster spot before officially converting Butler. Given that both Chuma Okeke and David Roddy are on 10-day deals, it’s likely the Sixers will simply allow one or both to return to free agency after their ten days are up.\n\nButler’s future with the Sixers\n\nThis deal does not necessarily impact the Sixers’s offseason hopes of retaining Kelly Oubre Jr., Guerschon Yabusele, and Quenton Grimes. While Butler’s deal is not just a one-year contract, the second year is a team option that gives the Sixers flexibility come the offseason. This means that the Sixers’s plan of retaining Yabusele and the others is still very much alive and just as possible as it was before the very deserving contract was handed out.\n\nFeb 9, 2025; Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA; Philadelphia 76ers guard Jared Butler (12) passes the ball around dMilwaukee Bucks guard Gary Trent Jr. (5) during the fourth quarter at Fiserv Forum. Mandatory Credit: Jeff Hanisch-Imagn Images\n\nPhiladelphia may still look to keep Butler in the long term. Should the 24-year-old guard continue to show his outstanding playmaking skills and lay claim to the backup point guard role once everyone is healthy, the Sixers could pick up his team option and secure his services for another year or decline it in search of a longer team-friendly deal. If Butler fails to stick in the rotation as players become healthy, the Sixers can decline the second year and send him into free agency with no effect on their cap sheet.\n\nWhile Butler isn’t a generational player by any means, he has shown that he has the skills to make a difference. When he was with the Wizards, Butler scored a career-high 26 points against Philadelphia just last month. If anyone has the right situation to help Butler become a consistent contributor in this league, it’s the Sixers.\n\nPhiladelphia has been one of the best in the NBA when it comes to developing young, overlooked players these past two years, with both Ricky Council IV and Justin Edwards proving that they belong. With Butler’s playmaking and ball-handling skills being desperate needs for the Sixers, he could soon join the list as another piece of a sneaky young core in Philadelphia.",

        "source": "https://metrophiladelphia.com/",
        "fullContent": "Sign up for our Daily Email newsletter to stay up-to-date on the latest local news throughout Philadelphia.\n\nAfter earning a 2022 Oscar for Best Documentary Film with his directorial debut, ‘Summer of Soul (…Or, When the Revolution Could Not Be Televised)’, Philadelphia native Ahmir “Questlove” Thompson—co-founder of The Roots and drummer for The Tonight Show band—was undoubtedly ready for an encore.\n\nInstead of one encore, Questlove gave us two.\n\nFirst is the freshly-released film, the NBC documentary ‘Ladies & Gentlemen… 50 Years of SNL Music‘, to coincide with the 50th anniversary celebration of ‘Saturday Night Live‘, and secondly, this week’s ‘Sly Lives! (aka the Burden of Black Genius),’ is a study of Sly & Family Stone and Black music innovators such as Andre 3000 and D’Angelo.\n\nQuestlove’s ‘Ladies & Gentlemen… 50 Years of SNL Music’ doc features footage of the program’s storied live performances, from the Rolling Stones, David Bowie, Run DMC and more, and can currently be streamed on Peacock. ‘Sly Lives!’ is available for streaming on Hulu.\n\n“When we did ‘Summer of Soul‘, Ahmir and I came from the same starting point — we both knew and loved most of its artists,” says Questlove’s filmmaking partner, Oscar-winning producer Joseph Patel, talking about that 2021 documentary’s list of stars such as Stevie Wonder, Nina Simone, Gladys Knight & the Pips and more.\n\n“With ‘Sly Lives!’, it was Quest who held great importance for Sly Stone,” notes Patel. “That was one of Ahmir’s longtime favorites and one of his most influential artists.”\n\nSly Stone (born Stewart) is a San Francisco psychedelic-era radio DJ turned composer, singer, and musician who revolutionized music with Sly & the Family Stone — a multi-racial, genre-blending band that shattered boundaries between Black and White audiences. With soul-rock-funk-pop crossover hits like ‘Stand!’, ‘Everyday People’, ‘Hot Fun in the Summertime’, and ‘Thank You’, the group left an indelible mark on music history. The latter track, in particular, became a widely sampled staple of 1980s and ‘90s hip-hop, as highlighted in a fast-cut segment of ‘Sly Lives!’ where producers Terry Lewis and Jimmy Jam discuss its influence on Janet Jackson’s ‘Rhythm Nation.’ That same quick-cutting, DJ-like pacing can be found in the first few minutes of ‘Ladies & Gentlemen… 50 Years of SNL Music‘ as Questlove splices and dices what seems like hundreds of live segments — from the B-52s to Olivia Rodriguez — rhythmically, in the blink of an eye.\n\nQuestlove told Billboard magazine that Sly Stone was “essentially” the first Black megastar. “Sly is basically the he embodiment of what Martin Luther King’s ‘I Have a Dream’ speech was about, like this utopian multiracial mix of Black and whites, men and women together.”\n\nPatel goes on to say that he, however, didn’t know Sly’s discography in order, but did know those Family Stone hits, as well as the decline of Sly Stone that followed – the drug addiction, the arrests, the manner in which he missed live concerts and recording dates, and allowed his career to slip away.\n\n“I knew how he tried to win back his fame, that he was a junkie and lived in a camper,” says Patel. “The challenge for me was to become fluent so as to best tell his story and use his life and work as an avatar for this larger idea: the burden of Black genius.”\n\nQuestlove told Deadline that Sly’s undoing at his own hands was “the point of this whole film about self-sabotage. But he wrote the alphabet, and we’re still writing books from that alphabet to this day.”\n\nWhen it comes to the present day, and the ‘Sly’ documentary’s take on the idea of Black genius, Questlove spoke to Black music innovators Vernon Reid, Q-Tip, Chaka Khan, André 3000, and, most particularly D’Angelo — artists whose earliest works broke down barriers of what it means to make Black music, and had issues with how to move forward with the weight of expectation put upon them.\n\n“Can you imagine Sly after having just headlined Woodstock, being on the cover of Rolling Stone, having Black and White America are both looking to you as if you just solved race relations through your music—what pressure that must have been for him?,” asks Patel. “Connecting the stories of Sly and everyone else in the film came down to Ahmir’s own experiences with fame.”",

        "fullContent": "Sign up for our email newsletter to stay up-to-date on the latest local sports news throughout Philadelphia.\n\nThe Philadelphia Phillies roaming BayCare Ballpark’s outfield grass at Phillies Spring Training should look familiar. The existing crew of Nick Castellanos (157 starts), Kyle Schwarber (5 starts), Brandon Marsh (115), Johan Rojas (103), Weston Wilson (15), and Kody Clemens (1) returns to the outfield grass in Clearwater, Florida. One new face has been added to the mix as Philly turns to Max Kepler, a 31-year-old free-agent addition from Minnesota, who spent a decade with the Twins organization. Last season, the Phillies were a top-10 outfield unit in the MLB on the way to their first N.L. East Division title since 2011.\n\nSchwarber, Marsh, and Wilson split the left-field duties at Citizens Bank Park last season. With the addition of Kepler to the mix, Phillies manager Rob Thompson has more options to mix and match the position as needed entering this season.\n\nLeft Field Platoon\n\nDespite his 1.000% fielding percentage in 41 outfield innings last year, Kyle Schwarber should focus on saving energy to demolish baseballs towards City Hall this summer. The 31-year-old slugger placed inside the top 10 in HR (38), RBIs (104), and runs scored (110). Schwarber’s 106 walks were the best in the National League, with Los Angeles Dodgers superstar Shohei Ohtani’s 81 free passes in second place.\n\nBrandon Marsh, 27, played most of last season as part of a left-field platoon. He logged 684 innings over 97 games in this position and had a .978 fielding percentage. The five errors Marsh committed in the outfield last season were tied for second-worst in the MLB. It would not be shocking to see the Phillies’ addition of Kepler to the outfield, reducing Marsh’s role slightly. Marsh must rebound from a disastrous playoff appearance with one hit in 13 plate appearances for a .077 average in the 2024 postseason.\n\nMax Kepler, 31, should see his playing time in left field, given Nick Castellanos’s stranglehold on the starting spot in right field. The MLB veteran should not be a liability risk in the outfield, bringing a .993% fielding percentage in over 1,000 MLB appearances in a decade-long career. The 6-foot-4 outfielder is a .237 career hitter with 161 HRs and 508 RBIs on 1,034 games with Minnesota. Last season, Kepler played 105 games for the Twins with a .253 batting average, 8 HRs, and 42 RBIs, featuring injury concerns down the stretch run.\n\nWeston Wilson, 30, appeared at seven of the nine positions on the baseball diamond last season, including pitcher. Left field was the preferred starting destination last season, with Wilson logging 125 error-free innings in front of Harry The K’s outdoor bar. The Milwaukee Brewers draft pick from 2016 has a .288 batting average in 104 plate appearances in the MLB.\n\nFeb 12, 2025; Clearwater, FL, USA; Members of the Philadelphia Phillies prepare to workout during spring training at Carpenter Complex. Mandatory Credit: Jonathan Dyer-Imagn Images\n\nCenterfield Duo\n\nJohan Rojas, 24, received the majority of action in centerfield for Rob Thompson last season. Over 903 innings, Rojas was excellent defensively, finishing with a 991% fielding percentage, the fifth-best among centerfielders in the National League. The 5-foot-11 speedster features a .261 batting average over two MLB seasons, proving reliable in generating sacrifice hits for the Phillies. Rojas finished third in the N.L. with eight sacrifice hits in 2024 and fourth in 2023 after six successful sacrifice attempts. The MLB postseason has been unkind to Rojas, who has a .104 batting average with 16 strikeouts over 51 plate appearances.\n\nThe combination of Marsh and Kepler will likely sub for Rojas when he needs a break. Marsh has 248 starts in center field in his MLB career, including 35 last season for Philly. Those 30+ games represent a substantial 20% of the MLB campaign. Kepler brings 127 games worth of centerfield experience to Rob Thompson’s lineup but has not had meaningful action in centerfield since 2021.\n\nRight Field Ironman\n\nNick Castellanos, 32, led the National League with 157 starts in right field last season on his way to playing every game of the MLB season last year. Castellanos has earned his everyday status from Rob Thompson by not making mistakes in the field despite a grueling workload. The 2010 Detroit Tigers draft pick finished first in RF fielding percentage in the N.L. for the third season since joining Philadelphia in 2022.\n\nIn three seasons in Philadelphia, Castellanos has a .263 batting average, 65 HRs, and 254 RBIs. Castellanos has appeared in 319 of 324 games, or 98%, for the Phillies over the last two seasons, with only five absences from the lineup. He has also been one of the more reliable run producers in the Phillies lineup in the postseason, with 6 HRs and 17 RBIs during three playoff runs in Philly.\n\nPhillies Bench Options\n\nMarsh and Wilson should find opportunities to play but are expected to spend most afternoons watching from the Citizens Bank Park dugout. Kody Clemens, 28, could also find a small role as a replacement player in the Phillies outfield during the season. Primarily an infielder, Clemens started one game in left field last season and has 72 innings of experience over three MLB seasons between Detroit and Philadelphia. Schwarber is excluded from bench options as he will find his way into the starting designated hitter spot in Thompson’s lineup card, as he did more often than not last season.\n\nMandatory Credit: Bill Streicher-USA TODAY Sports",

Managers make their decisions based on the numbers.” What better way to start a brand new Phillies season than with a new piece looking at the numbers behind Philadelphia baseball?\n\nAs Philly’s baseball team trickles into Clearwater, Florida, over the next week for the start of baseball activities, let’s take our first look at some relevant numbers that will allow you to drop some knowledge on your baseball-loving buddies this spring.\n\nPhillies By Numbers\n\n0- Days remaining until Phillies Spring Training arrives in 2025. Seriously! Despite the winter weather swirling around Philadelphia, the trucks have already arrived, and Phillies GM Dave Dombrowski has held a press conference to provide some new nuggets of information. For those who don’t have time to watch it, PSN’s Cory Nidoh broke it all down for you!\n\n1- Phillies rookies to hit for the cycle: Weston Wilson last August against Washington. It was the 10th cycle in Phillies history. Wilson smacked a triple off the wall in right in the 4th before a pop-up single landed him on first base later in that same inning. The cycle watch was on after Wilson blasted a 7th-inning home run. Wilson’s name was etched in the history books in the 8th inning as he connected with a double, sending the home crowd into a frenzy as he strolled into second base.\n\n2- Games Against the N.L. East during Grapefruit League action—both are against Atlanta. The Phillies were 6-7 last season against the Atlanta Braves, with a 4-3 home record in Philadelphia and a 2-4 visiting record in Georgia.\n\n4- Number of Phillies to claim MLB’s National League Rookie-of-the-Year Award. Jack Sanford claimed the first one in franchise history in 1957, followed by Richie “Dick” Allen a few seasons later in 1964. Three more decades passed before Scott Rolen’s award-winning campaign in 1997. Ryan Howard’s 22 HR and 63 RBI during the 2005 season claimed the franchise’s most recent breakout rookie trophy.\n\nFeb 12, 2025; Clearwater, FL, USA; Philadelphia Phillies special instructor Cole Hamels looks on during a spring training workout at Carpenter Complex Mandatory Credit: Jonathan Dyer-Imagn Images\n\n15- Number worn by new Hall of Famer Dick Allen over his 9-year Phillies career. Allen played 1,070 games in a Phillies uniform with a .290 batting average, 204 HRs, and 655 RBIs. In his 1964 rookie campaign, he led the National League in runs scored (125) and total bases (352) for the season. Despite a batting average above .300, Allen unceremoniously led the N.L. in strikeouts during his first two seasons in the majors—138 in 1964 and 150 in 1965.\n\n31- The number of games the Phillies play during spring training. The Toronto Blue Jays and the New York Yankees are tied for most games against Philadelphia at five games each. The Boston Red Sox and the Braves have two scheduled appearances against the Phillies this spring.\n\n79- Number of times Philadelphia’s MLB club has held spring training in Clearwater. According to MLB’s Todd Zolecki, the Phillies trained in ten different states between 1900 and 1946 before settling in South Florida. Philadelphia first appeared in Clearwater in 1947 when it signed a 10-year contract and promised to add an expensive sprinkler system at Athletic Field. The city would pay the team back for most of the purchase price over the next decade.\n\n95- Total wins for the Phillies last season. Philly was 95-67, including a 54-27 home record at Citizens Bank Park. As a road squad last season, the Phillies played one game over .500 baseball with a 41-40 record. Of course, we all know what happened in the postseason, so no need to go any further there.\n\n224- Number of MLB strikeout victims by Zach Wheeler in 2024. He was tied for second overall in the National League with San Deigo’s Dylan Cease (224). Both pitchers finished behind Atlanta’s Chris Sale (225) in the N.L. punchout competition. Detroit Tigers All-Star Tarik Skubal led the MLB with 228 strikeouts in 2024.\n\nFeb 12, 2025; Clearwater, FL, USA; Philadelphia Phillies pitcher Aaron Nola (27) warms up during a spring training workout at Carpenter Complex. Mandatory Credit: Jonathan Dyer-Imagn Images\n\n800- Approximate weight (in pounds) of the 2,400 baseballs that traveled to spring training with the Phillies. The weight is equivalent to that of a grown grizzly bear. While it seems silly to suggest every one of the spherical objects will see game day action, that math works out to 150 baseballs per game for each of the 16 home dates at BayCare Park this spring.\n\n1,058- Miles (approximately) between Citizens Bank Park in Pennsylvania and BayCare Park in Florida. According to Google’s highly scientific calculations, it takes between 15-16 hours to drive from Philadelphia, PA, to Clearwater, FL. While it is possible to take a train ride down the East Coast, be prepared to book almost a full day in your travel itinerary for the ride. Of course, air travel provides the quickest path to Florida, with a flight time of between two to three hours.\n\n10,000- Number of paper cups the Phillies loaded onto trucks for spring training. Spring Training is scheduled to last for 31 days, which gives the Phillies equipment staff an average of 322 paper cups per day before they begin to worry about a Spring Training shortage, not accounting for scheduled off days.\n\nMandatory Credit: Jonathan Dyer-Imagn Images",

During this fan event, Smith briefly addressed the media, reflecting on the Eagles‘ recent victory in Super Bowl LIX, the many fans in attendance to see him, and more.\n\nOne thing you quickly learn about Smith when speaking with him is that he is a man of few words who prefers to let his actions speak for him.

For the Amite City native, it was a homecoming of sorts.\n\n“I think it was just being back at home,” Smith reflected. “[I’m] very familiar with that building, played two state championships in it, being home in front of the family, I think that was it more so that than anything.”\n\nFeb 9, 2025; New Orleans, LA, USA; Philadelphia Eagles wide receiver DeVonta Smith (6) makes a catch for a touchdown against Kansas City Chiefs cornerback Jaylen Watson (35) during the second half of Super Bowl LIX at Caesars Superdome.

Smith added a Super Bowl to his resume, which already included a state championship appearance, two college football championships at Alabama, a Heisman trophy, and much more. Among Smith’s many accolades is his record of the most playoff receiving yards in Philadelphia Eagles history (595 yards).\n\nWhen asked by Philly Sports Network what the future held for Smith and his Eagles, he simply replied with a single, powerful statement: “Try to repeat it.”\n\nIt’s clear that while Smith had plans to enjoy this victory, next season is already on his mind.\n\nFootball – NFL – Super Bowl LIX – Philadelphia Eagles v Kansas City Chiefs – Caesars Superdome, New Orleans, Louisiana, United States – February 9, 2025 Philadelphia Eagles’ A.J.

        "source": "https://metrophiladelphia.com/",
        "fullContent": "New Yorkers called on Gov. Kathy Hochul to remove Mayor Eric Adams from office at a rally in Lower Manhattan on Feb. 16, 2025.\n\nOn the same day Mayor Eric Adams insisted he isn’t going anywhere, scores of protesters marched in Lower Manhattan Sunday demanding that Gov. Kathy Hochul use her executive power to remove the embattled mayor from power.\n\nSome 200 demonstrators from a coalition of activist groups — including Food & Water Watch, New York Communities for Change, Make the Road New York, Rise and Resist, and Jews For Racial and Economic Justice — gathered for the rally on a rainy Feb. 16 under the arch next to the David N. Dinkins Manhattan Municipal Building. They joined the calls of a growing number of Democratic political leaders who have been pressuring Hochul to give Adams the boot after President Trump’s Justice Department filed a motion to dismiss the five-count criminal indictment against Hizzoner “without prejudice,” fearing that he would do Trump’s bidding in exchange for dropping the charges.\n\nThe cooperation, Democratic leaders and activists fear, will result in the mass deportation of New Yorkers and their families. Alícia Nascimento, political director for New York Communities for Change, explained to the press that the organization held the emergency rally because they believed Adams was being “held hostage” by President Trump.\n\n“The Mayor essentially has a quid pro quo with the President that if he were able to dismiss the corruption charges, which he never went to trial [for],” Nascimento said, “then ICE would have reign over our city, and the federal government would be able to do whatever it wanted in a sanctuary city.”\n\nProtesters questioned Mayor Adams’ ability to lead the largest city in the country, especially after U.S. Attorney Danielle Sassoon of the Southern District of New York (SDNY) resigned and, in an eight-page letter, accused the mayor’s attorney’s of offering a “quid pro quo” to the Trump Justice Department, promising cooperation on the immigration crackdown in exchange for dropping the charges.\n\nWhile Adams insists he did nothing wrong and denies cutting a deal with the White House to have the case dropped, just last Friday, Adams appeared alongside Tom Homan, Trump’s border czar, in a live interview on FOX & Friends. Homan warned that he would be “up [Adams] butt” if he didn’t comply with Trump’s immigration crackdown.\n\nAt a meeting between the pair a day prior, Adams promised Homan he would allow Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents to operate on Rikers Island. Two weeks ago, Mayor Adams issued a memo to migrant shelter contractors, schools, and hospitals, stating that if employees felt threatened, they could allow agents of the U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement to enter migrant shelters without a judicial warrant — which would amount to a violation of New York City’s Sanctuary Laws.\n\nBefore the crowd of about 200 marched to the United States Federal Court House on Sunday, Assemblymember Harvey Epstein (D-Manhattan) pointed out that New York City immigrants are afraid to send their children to school or go to the hospital because of the memo the Mayor issued a few weeks ago.\n\n“That is not the New York we believe in. The mayor has to leave, and if he doesn’t decide to resign, he must be removed from office. That is our message, loud and clear,” Epstein declared.\n\nQueens Assembly member and Democratic socialist candidate for mayor Zohran Mamdani said that Adams was a “walking emergency.”\n\n“That is why I am calling on Governor Hochul to remove Mayor Adams from office immediately. Every single day that we let Mayor Adams sit in City Hall is another day that he could give up New York City to Donald Trump,” Mamdani said.\n\nAlong with ousting Adams, demonstrators further demanded that Hochul sign The New York for All Act, introduced by Brooklyn state Sen. Andrew Gounardes and Bronx Assembly Member Karines Reyes. The legislation, S.2235/A3506, would prohibit New York’s state and local government agencies, including police and sheriffs, from colluding with ICE, disclosing sensitive information, and diverting personnel or other resources to further federal immigration.\n\nCurrently, only New York City and Westchester County have sanctuary laws within the Empire State.",

        "fullContent": "article\n\nThe Brief States that implemented abortion bans had higher infant mortality rates. A new study finds that the infant mortality rate for births connected to the abortion ban were higher than expected. Rates of births and deaths were evaluated using data between 2012 and 2013 before abortion restrictions took effect.\n\n\n\nA new study reveals that states with abortion bans experienced an increase in infant mortality rates.\n\nThe study published in the medical journal JAMA noted that in 14 states that implemented complete or 6-week abortion bans after the Supreme Court Dobbs decision revoked the federal right to abortion, the fertility rate increased 1.7%, leading to roughly 1 additional birth for every 1,000 women of reproductive age.\n\nRELATED: Abortion laws by state\n\nBy the numbers:\n\nThe study also found that with roughly 500 deaths than expected among nearly 22,000 additional births, the infant mortality rate for births linked to abortion bans – 24 deaths for every 1,000 births – was approximately four times higher than projected.\n\nThe estimated increases in infant mortality were larger for deaths based on congenital causes and among groups that had higher than average infant mortality rates at baseline, including Black infants and those in southern states.\n\nHow was data gathered for the study?\n\nResearchers used study data that included biannual counts of neonatal and infant deaths, and the corresponding total number of live births, from birth and death certificate data compiled by the National Center for Health Statistics for all 50 US states and the District of Columbia from January 2012 through December 2023.\n\nThe study noted that biannual counts of infant deaths and live births were separately pulled for four racial and ethnic groups (racial and ethnic data were acquired from the death certificate, which is identified by the next of kin, coroner, or other person who certified the death) for each state over the same period.\n\nRELATED: Survey: 3 in 4 reproductive age women in the US think abortion should be legal\n\nThe primary outcome was the infant mortality rate, calculated as the number of infant deaths per 1000 live births in each biannual period for each state over 12 years. Mortality rates were calculated overall and by race and ethnicity, timing of death and cause of death.\n\nThis study found that states that banned abortion had infant mortality rates higher than would have been expected without such bans. The largest estimated changes were observed among southern states and Black infants.\n\nWhat did researchers conclude in the study?\n\nResearchers noted that their analysis found an estimated increase of 0.33 infant deaths per 1000 live births above expected in states that banned abortion.\n\nWhat they're saying:\n\nThe team shared that the results are consistent with clinician and media reports documenting denial of terminations for nonviable pregnancies, forcing pregnant women to overcome significant barriers to receive timely abortion care out of state or carry the pregnancy to term.\n\n\n\nAccording to the study, the increase in infant mortality rate due to noncongenital causes is less straightforward and needs more investigation.\n\nMoreover, researchers explained that the study provides new evidence that infant deaths were higher than expected in states that enforced abortion bans after the bans were implemented.",

While the order is unlikely to have a significant national effect, as most schools and colleges have already dropped their vaccine requirements, it threatens to withhold federal funding from institutions still enforcing COVID-19 vaccine mandates.\n\n\n\nPresident Donald Trump signed an executive order on Friday which directs the Education Department and Health and Human Services to create a plan to end vaccine mandates for COVID-19.\n\nThe order aims to fulfill a campaign promise from Trump, who often said he would \"not give one penny to any school that has a vaccine mandate.\"\n\nTrump says COVID-19 mandates in school infrige on ‘personal freedom’\n\nWhat they're saying:\n\n\"Given the incredibly low risk of serious COVID-19 illness for children and young adults, threatening to shut them out of an education is an intolerable infringement on personal freedom,\" the order said.\n\nDig deeper:\n\nThe order is expected to have little national impact because COVID-19 vaccine mandates have mostly been dropped at schools and colleges across the United States, and many states have passed legislation forbidding such mandates.\n\nFILE: Doctor with COVID-19 vaccine. (Credit: Jeff J Mitchell - Pool /Getty Images)\n\nThe order applies only to COVID-19 vaccines.

Most also allow exemptions for religious or other nonmedical reasons.\n\nSome colleges started requiring students to be immunized against COVID-19 during the pandemic, but most have dropped the requirements. A few continue to require vaccines at least for students living on campus, including Swarthmore and Oberlin colleges. Most of those colleges allow medical or religious exemptions.\n\nSchools requiring vaccine at risk of losing federal funding\n\nThe order also said schools, colleges and states that require students to be immunized against COVID-19 may be at risk of losing federal funding.\n\nThe order didn't identify specific sources of money that could be at risk.

CEO Steve Huffman said paid subreddits are \"coming\" and currently \"in the works.\" Reddit has had trouble generating profit and went public last March.\n\n\n\nA new feature is expected to roll out on Reddit later this year that could put some content behind a paywall.\n\nReddit’s co-founder and CEO Steve Huffman spoke more on the idea of paid subreddits in a recent company Ask Me Anything (AMA).\n\nHere’s what to know:\n\nWhat is Reddit?\n\nThe backstory:\n\nReddit is a technology and social network company that was founded more than 20 years ago. It is a sought-after space for internet discussions of any topic within communities, also known as subreddits.\n\nReddit has more than 100 million daily active users, Huffman said last week , who visit the site to discuss a range of topics from silly memes to existential worries, as well as to get recommendations from like-minded people.\n\nDespite its popularity, Reddit has had trouble turning profit since it was founded in 2005. It’s been looking for ways to boost revenue, and went public in March of last year.\n\nBy the numbers:\n\nBy tech industry’s standards though, Reddit remains small for a company that has been around since 2005.\n\nLast year, Reddit’s annual revenue generation was just below $1 billion. For comparison, Meta boasts an annual revenue of $135 billion.\n\nMeta had a market value of more than $1.2 trillion in 2024. Reddit’s market value was priced at $6.4 billion when it went public last March.\n\nRELATED: TikTok returns to Apple, Google app stores after temporary removal\n\nPaid subreddits\n\nWhat we know:\n\nHuffman has talked about the idea of paid subreddits before, and mentioned that when asked about it again in a recent AMA alongside Chief Operating Officer Jen Wong and Chief Financial Officer Drew Volleror.\n\n\"That one’s coming. We’re working on it as we speak,\" Hoffman said.\n\nA paid subreddit would put a paywall, of sorts, around designated content, meaning that only members who pay could access that subreddit, or \"community,\" and see its content.\n\nWhat we don't know:\n\nHoffman didn’t elaborate on the timeline users can expect for the paid subreddits.\n\nHe also didn’t indicate how much users could expect to pay for some content, or if the amount would be fixed by Reddit or perhaps set by the creator.\n\nRELATED: Facebook fact-checking to be replaced with X-style community notes\n\nWhat's next:\n\nHoffman spoke on some other new key features that Reddit users can expect for 2025:\n\nPaid subreddits\n\nImproved search results\n\nReddit Answers, which uses AI to summarize search results from Reddit’s user base\n\nLaying the foundation for an eventual marketplace",

Like that is unheard of sometimes in these massive crowds. So, we would repeat it again, for sure!\"\n\nA family from Wyoming had zero complaints getting to and from the city.\n\nRelated article\n\n\"We thought it was smooth, really. I mean of course, the amount of people, yes there was waiting coming back, but that’s nothing. It’s really not that all,\" Brian Belmont stated, followed by Brady Belmonte, who added, \"Oh I thought it went pretty well. It was pretty organized. Not too bad, definitely a change from what we deal with every day.\"\n\nDig deeper:\n\nThe lines were long, unless you found a loophole.\n\nMelissa Guillen, from Berwyn, explained, \"You would turn a corner and you’re like no way could it keep going further and it kept going further.

But, they passed the time by making new friends and lifelong memories.\n\n\"It was like a good hour, or two, for us, but if you just sit there, it was probably like a five, four hour wait,\" Maui Morris said.\n\n\"But was it worth it?\" Kolodziej asked.\n\n\"It was, it really was. You say Go Birds! I’ll do anything for my city. I’d do it again in a heartbeat!\"\n\nThe overall theme:\n\nSo, that was the main theme – people had to wait to get on the train or the El or the bus, but they would do it again.

Two sources familiar with the plans told The Associated Press that cuts could come as soon as this week. IRS employees are reportedly not eligible for the buyouts offered by the Trump administration until the end of tax season.\n\n\n\nThe Internal Revenue Service (IRS) is reportedly cutting thousands of probationary workers as tax season ramps up.\n\nTwo sources familiar with the plans told The Associated Press that cuts could come as soon as this week.\n\nTrump federal employee buyout\n\nThe backstory:\n\nSince President Donald Trump began his second term last month, he has focused on dramatically reducing the federal workforce.\n\nTrump ordered agencies to lay off nearly all probationary employees who had not yet gained civil service protection.\n\nAdditionally, the Trump administration previously announced a plan spearheaded by Elon Musk to offer buyouts to almost all federal employees through a \"deferred resignation program.\" Musk is serving as Trump’s top adviser for reducing federal spending. The program deadline was Feb. 6, and administration officials said employees who accept will be able to stop working while still collecting a paycheck until Sept. 30.\n\nRELATED: Federal worker buyout deadline: What we know about the deferred resignation program\n\nFILE - The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) building in Washington, DC, US, on Tuesday, Dec. 31, 2024. Photographer: Samuel Corum/Bloomberg via Getty Images\n\nWhat we know:\n\nThe Associated Press reported that IRS employees involved in the 2025 tax season were told they will not be allowed to accept a buyout offer from the Trump administration until after the taxpayer filing deadline, according to a letter sent recently to IRS employees.\n\nWhat we don't know:\n\nIt is unclear how many IRS workers will be impacted by the layoff announcement plan.\n\nIt’s also unclear how the layoffs would affect IRS processings, such as the disbursement of tax refunds.\n\nBig picture view:\n\nJan. 27 was the official start date of the 2025 tax season, and the IRS expects more than 140 million tax returns to be filed by the April 15 deadline.\n\nRELATED: Where's my refund? How to track your IRS tax return\n\nIRS funding\n\nThe other side:\n\nThe Biden administration invested heavily - $80 billion - in the IRS, which included plans to hire tens of thousands of new employees to help with customer service and enforcement as well as new technology to update the tax collection agency.\n\nRepublicans have been successful at clawing back that money.\n\nFederal government employees\n\nBy the numbers:\n\nThe civilian federal workforce, not including military personnel and postal workers, comprises about 2.4 million people.\n\nWhile a chunk of federal workers, about 20%, are in Washington, D.C., and the neighboring states of Maryland and Virginia, more than 80% are distributed outside the region.\n\nTrump’s buyout offer has already been accepted by about 65,000 employees, FOX News reported .",

Troopers were able to apprehend the suspect a short distance from the crash site.\n\nAccording to NY State Police, the suspect provided false identification and was found in possession of multiple fraudulent forms of identification at the time of the arrest.\n\nHe was taken to Westchester Medical Center for treatment of minor injuries from the crash.\n\nAfter analyzing his fingerprints, the suspect was identified as Geovanni Otero, the man wanted by the Philadelphia Police Department and the United States Marshals Service for the death of Melody Rivera and other offenses.\n\nWhat's next:\n\nOtero is awaiting arraignment Monday for Criminal Possession of Stolen Property 4th degree, Obstructing Governmental Administration, False Impersonation, Unlawful Fleeing, and Reckless Driving.\n\nHe will remain in custody pending extradition proceedings.",

Some activists and BOP employees don't think its right to hold immigrants who haven't been convicted of crimes in a prison. President Trump has vowed to deport the 11.7 immigrants in the U.S. who are here illegally.\n\n\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security and the Bureau of Prisons signed a contract to turn five federal prisons into ICE detention centers, a leaked memo obtained by KTVU shows.\n\nThe memo, signed on Feb. 6, shows that two units at the Federal Detention Center in Atlanta, up to 1 unit at the Federal Correctional Institute Leavenworth in Kansas, up to 1 unit at FDC Philadelphia and up to four units at FCI Berlin in New Hampshire and up to four units at FCI Miami will be used to house ICE detainees.\n\nThe memo has a caveat that FCI Berlin is not currently available because there is not enough staffing, food, clothing and training at this site.\n\nThe memo also states that because there isn't enough space, only men will be housed at these sites.\n\nFCI Dublin in California – which is currently empty after it was closed in April 2024 after a high-profile sex abuse scandal – was not mentioned in this memo, but a source told KTVU that this was the first round of memos and more will likely be coming.\n\nHowever, ICE officials visited FCI Dublin on Thursday and Friday, according to John Kostelnik, the Western region vice president of the American Federation of Government Employees Council of Prison Locals No. 33, which represents federal prison workers.\n\n\"We don't know the questions that are being asked,\" he said on Friday. \"We don't know the exact specifics, but they're most certainly touring as an assessment to potentially utilizing this facility.\"\n\nThe memo was signed by Kenneth Genalo, acting deputy director of ICE and William Lothrop, who was named head of the BOP after Colette Peters left on the day Donald Trump was sworn in as president.\n\nBut Lothrop announced his resignation on Friday, according to an internal staff statement, also obtained by KTVU.\n\nLothrop said that he finds himself in \"unprecedented times as an agency, and thus, it is with mixed emotions\" that he is retiring Feb. 28 after 33 years with the BOP. He also named five other members of the BOP team who are leaving office.\n\nTrump has vowed to deport millions of the estimated 11.7 million people in the U.S. illegally. ICE currently has the budget to detain only about 41,000 people and the administration has not said how many detention beds it needs to achieve its goals.\n\nOne source told KTVU that many BOP employees are upset about the change.\n\nThe source said that it's not fair to put immigrants in federal prisons because they have not been charged or convicted of crimes. The conditions of confinement in prison are much different than in an ICE detention center, the source said.\n\nThe last time federal prisons were turned into ICE detention centers occurred during Trump's first administration in 2018.\n\nThe BOP reached an agreement with ICE and Customs and Border Protection back then to detain up to 1,600 immigrants at federal prison facilities in Arizona, California, Oregon, Washington and Texas.\n\nThe source said that in some cases, staff assaulted detainees, and some detainees also died by suicide.\n\nKendra Drysdale, who was once incarcerated at FCI Dublin, doesn't think immigrants should be housed in a federal prison.\n\n\"To put people who are not even criminals into a prison environment is absolutely horrific and a huge violation of human rights.\"",

A similar share say spending is too low for Medicare, the national health care insurance program for seniors, and most also say Medicaid is under-funded by the federal government.\n\nRELATED: 75,000 federal workers take buyout after judge approves Trump’s downsizing plan\n\nAbout one-third of U.S. adults say the federal government is spending \"too much\" on the military. About one-third say the military is getting \"too little\" funding, and another one-third say it takes in \"about the right amount.\" But most Republicans say the military is underfunded, while slightly less than half of Democrats say it's getting too much money.\n\nFILE - The US Capitol is seen at sunrise on September 30, 2023 in Washington, DC. (Photo by Nathan Howard/Getty Images) Expand\n\nForeign aid is one area where there is broad consensus that the U.S. is overspending. The 2023 AP-NORC polling suggests that Americans tend to believe too much money is going to other countries.\n\nRoughly 7 in 10 U.S. adults said the government was putting too much money toward \"assistance to other countries.\" About 9 in 10 Republicans and just over half of Democrats agreed that the country was overspending on foreign aid at the time. But polling has also shown that U.S. adults tend to overestimate the share of the federal budget that is spent on foreign aid.\n\nWhat is the government actually spending?\n\nForeign aid spending\n\nBy the numbers:\n\nSurveys from KFF have found that, on average, Americans say spending on foreign aid makes up 31% of the federal budget rather than the actual answer: closer to 1% or less.\n\nSocial Security spending\n\nAccording to the nonpartisan Center on Budget Policies and Priorities (CBPP), in 2024, 21% of the budget, or $1.5 trillion, was spent on Social Security, providing monthly retirement benefits averaging $1,922 to 51.5 million retired workers. Social Security also paid benefits to 2.6 million spouses and children of retired workers, 5.8 million surviving children and spouses of deceased workers, and 8.4 million disabled workers and their eligible dependents.\n\nMedicare, Medicaid, CHIP and ACA spending\n\nFour health insurance programs — Medicare, Medicaid, the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP), and Affordable Care Act (ACA) marketplace health insurance subsidies — comprised a combined 24% of the 2024 federal budget, or $1.7 trillion. More than half – or $912 billion – went to Medicare, which provided health coverage to around 67 million people who are 65 or older or have disabilities.\n\nThe rest was spent on Medicaid and CHIP ($626 billion) and ACA subsidy and marketplace costs ($125 billion). Both Medicaid and CHIP require states to pay some of their total costs, according to the CBPP.\n\nDefense spending\n\nNational defense made up 13 percent of the budget, or $872 billion.\n\nRELATED: Coast Guard Commandant terminated over border lapses, recruitment, DEI focus: official\n\n\"About 95 percent of the spending in this category reflects the underlying costs of the Defense Department, largely for operations and maintenance; military personnel; procurement of weapons; and research, development, testing, and evaluation,\" the CBPP says.\n\nEducation spending\n\nIn 2024, the federal government spent about 5% of its total budget on education. This includes elementary, secondary, and vocational education; higher education; and research and general educational aids",

The Super Bowl parade may have hurt a little, but many establishments made adjustments to accommodate for the occasion. Lovebirds said there’s nothing like celebrating the Birds and Valentine’s Day in the city.\n\n\n\nAre you feeling the love?\n\nThis weekend, many couples are celebrating a belated Valentine’s Day since the holiday fell on the same day as the Eagles Super Bowl parade. Businesses and restaurants took that into consideration and extended the love to patrons, by extending their holiday specials past Friday.\n\nWhat we know:\n\nReesa Tellez and her boyfriend of seven years, Jimmy, celebrated Valentine’s Day at Mamajuana Café in Fishtown, albeit a day after the actual holiday.\n\n\"Our reservation was for yesterday here, and they were so nice. I explained we’re going to the parade can we come tomorrow? They’re like absolutely. So, understanding, so cool. So yeah, we’re here today after some good night sleep,\" said Tellez. \"Excited to get the Latin vibe. Mofongo, sushi, nice little drink. Definitely excited.\"\n\nGeneral Manager David Alvarez, of the Dominican Caribbean restaurant, said this was a common occurrence Friday night, but they decided to extend their hours and the holiday the rest of the weekend and made up for rescheduled reservations.\n\n\"Our kitchen closes at midnight so we extended an hour more to try to accommodate as many customers as we could, since we were so grateful to have so many people picking us to come out and celebrate this special day with their significant others,\" said Alvarez.\n\nAlvarez said when all was said and done, about 600 to 700 people dined and wined at Mamajuana Café Friday evening. The Valentine’s Day special cocktails are available through Sunday, including a drink called \"Secret of Love\" that provides customers with an interactive experience when it’s served.\n\nThe other side:\n\nAn alternative intimate experience in Manayunk invited couples to \"Love at First Fright\" at Lincoln Mill Haunted House.\n\n\"Come on, what’s more romantic than going to a haunted house for Valentine’ s Day where you’re forced to get all close to your date or loved one,\" asked Jared Bilsak, Co-founder and Architect of Lincoln Mill Haunted House.\n\nBilsak suspects the parade may have hurt turnout a little, but the event still saw droves of crowds with final numbers nearing 1,000 attendees.\n\n\"We pretty much turned out all the lights inside and we gave couples a little battery powered candle so they have to navigate through the darkness and it’s very dark in there,\" said Bilsak. \"This was their first date – their first date was through a haunted house and all three couples were like, ‘It won’t be our last date.’\"\n\nWhat's next:\n\nAlvarez said Mamajuana Café is extending Valentine’s Day into their Sunday brunch and dinner service.\n\n\"Being here with the people you love and making good memories, that’s what it’s all about, and seeing other people do the same,\" said Tellez.",

His presence highlights NASCAR's conservative-leaning fan base and his broader effort to align with American sports culture. Drivers, including Chase Elliott, acknowledge the significance of a president attending the event: \"It certainly brings a lot of eyes.\"\n\n\n\nPresident Donald Trump attended the Daytona 500 on Sunday, marking his second appearance at NASCAR’s most prestigious race as president.\n\nSpirit of NASCAR will 'fuel America's Golden Age'\n\nWhat we know:\n\nPresident Trump is back in Daytona Beach for The Great American Race. It's the second appearance at the race as president. His first visit was in 2020 while running for reelection. That year, he served as grand marshal, delivering the command for drivers to start their engines and making a dramatic entrance with an Air Force One flyover.\n\nFor this trip, Air Force One departed from Palm Beach International Airport shortly after noon, carrying Trump, his son Eric, grandson Luke, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy, Interior Secretary Doug Burgum and his wife, Kathryn. Several members of Congress were also accompanying him, according to the White House.\n\nTrump also thrilled NASCAR fans in the stands with another Air Force One flyover before he rode in the presidential limousine onto the Daytona International Speedway.\n\nTrump has made a point of attending major sporting events, having recently become the first sitting president to attend a Super Bowl. His presence at college football games and UFC fights, along with his well-documented passion for golf, further underscores his efforts to align himself with sports culture.\n\nWhat we don't know:\n\nIt remained unclear whether Trump had any official role at the Daytona 500 this year, as he did in 2020 when he was grand marshal. The extent of his involvement in pre-race ceremonies or interactions with drivers has not been disclosed.\n\nThe backstory:\n\nTrump’s relationship with NASCAR extends beyond his appearances at the Daytona 500. In 2018, while in the White House, he honored NASCAR Cup Series champion Martin Truex Jr. and Furniture Row Racing. More recently, in May of last year, he attended the Coca-Cola 600 at Charlotte Motor Speedway, a major race in the swing state of North Carolina, as a former president and reelection candidate.\n\nTrump has often spoken about his admiration for the sport and its fans, praising the courage of drivers and the patriotic spirit of NASCAR events. His presence at Daytona aligns with his broader strategy of cultivating support among sports audiences.\n\nBig picture view:\n\nTrump’s appearance at the Daytona 500 reinforces his ongoing effort to maintain visibility among sports fans, particularly those in key political battlegrounds. With NASCAR’s fan base traditionally seen as conservative-leaning, his presence at the event could bolster his appeal among a segment of voters who value his brand of patriotism and showmanship.\n\nHis attendance follows a recent pattern of high-profile sports event visits, including last weekend’s Super Bowl. These appearances, coupled with his history of engaging with NASCAR and other sports leagues, reflect a continued strategy of associating himself with American sports culture.\n\nImage 1 of 9 ▼ DAYTONA BEACH, FLORIDA - FEBRUARY 16: Air Force One is seen for U.S. President Donald Trump's visit to the NASCAR Cup Series Daytona 500 at Daytona International Speedway on February 16, 2025 in Daytona Beach, Florida. (Photo by Mike Ehrmann/Getty Images)\n\nWhat they're saying:\n\nDuring a 2020 interview with Fox News, Trump spoke about his admiration for NASCAR and the Daytona 500, calling it a \"legendary display of roaring engines, soaring spirits and the American skill, speed and power that we’ve been hearing about for so many years.\"\n\n\"The tens of thousands of patriots here today have come for the fast cars and the world-class motorsports,\" Trump said at the time. \"But NASCAR fans never forget that no matter who wins the race, what matters most is God, family and country.\"\n\nChase Elliott, a NASCAR driver, acknowledged the significance of having a sitting president attend the Daytona 500. \"One of our biggest days of the year is special,\" he said. \"It certainly brings a lot of eyes and a different perspective to what we do down here for this race.\"\n\nDaytona 500: What to know:\n\nThe Daytona 500 race is held on Sunday, Feb. 16, at Daytona International Speedway in Daytona Beach, Florida. The race started at 1:30 p.m. (It was moved up an hour due to the potential for weather on Sunday afternoon).\n\nHow can I watch the Daytona 500?\n\nThe Daytona 500 airs on FOX and FOX 35 Orlando.

        "source": "https://www.fox29.com/",
        "fullContent": "The Brief A Gallup poll found that 45% of Democrats want their party to be more moderate, an 11-point increase since 2021. Meanwhile, 43% of Republicans prefer their party's current ideology, with fewer calling for a more conservative shift. The results come after Donald Trump’s inauguration for his second term as president and Republican control of Congress.\n\n\n\nAfter losing the presidency and Senate in the 2024 election, an increasing number of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents say they want their party to become more moderate rather than maintain its current liberal stance.\n\nA Gallup poll, published last month, found that 45% of Democrats now favor a moderate shift, up from 34% in 2021. Meanwhile, 29% of Democrats still want their party to move in a more liberal direction, a five-point drop from 2021.\n\nAt the same time, Republicans are largely satisfied with their party's ideology under Trump, with 43% of GOP voters saying the party should stay the same. Only 28% want the party to become more conservative, a significant drop from 40% in 2021.\n\nWhat’s behind the shift?\n\nThe backstory:\n\nOne factor that may be influencing Democrats' preference for moderation is the party’s recent electoral losses. Following the 2024 election, Republicans took control of both the presidency and Senate, while maintaining a slim majority in the House of Representatives.\n\nFILE - Democratic leaders, including Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer, gather for a press conference at the U.S. Capitol. (Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)\n\nIn contrast, Republican satisfaction with their party's ideology may be a reflection of their support for Trump and the conservative policies his administration has begun enacting.\n\nHow views differ within each party\n\nBy the numbers:\n\nGallup's findings also reveal ideological divisions within both parties:\n\nLiberal Democrats (49% of Democrats overall) mostly want the party to be more liberal (45%) or remain the same (22%).\n\nModerate Democrats (43% of Democrats) overwhelmingly prefer a shift to the center (62%).\n\nConservative Republicans (two-thirds of GOP voters) are split: 45% favor the status quo, while 38% want a more conservative GOP.\n\nModerate Republicans are more likely to favor a centrist shift (50%), rather than staying the same (36%).\n\nThese divisions suggest that while moderate Democrats increasingly want their party to move to the center, moderate Republicans are somewhat less eager for change.\n\nWhat this means for the future\n\nThe Democratic Party's shift toward moderation could influence its strategy heading into the 2026 midterms. The party may seek to regain voter support by focusing on more centrist policies and appealing to swing voters.\n\nMeanwhile, the Republican Party appears to be more united in its current direction, with Trump maintaining strong support among GOP voters.\n\nAs both parties look ahead to future elections, their ideological shifts could play a key role in shaping the political landscape for years to come.",

The pursuit was said to have started with New Castle County Police who attempted to pull him over, due to him driving a car with a bare rim. After driving at least an hour, he crashed into a utility pole in a southern Delaware town, and attempted to run, but was caught by troopers.\n\n\n\nA West Chester man led Delaware State Police on a pursuit that stretched across a majority of the state, crossing through many jurisdictions, covering at least 45 miles, before crashing, attempting to run, but ultimately caught by troopers.\n\nThe chase began after New Castle County Police tried to pull him over due to a bare rim on the car he was driving.\n\nWhat we know:\n\nFriday afternoon, about 12:45, officials with Delaware State Police said troopers were contacted, saying New Castle County Police were pursuing a man driving a BMW with a Pennsylvania tag and driving on a bare rim.\n\nTroopers joined the pursuit after the driver, later identified as 22-year-old West Chester resident Thomas Casey, was seen heading south into Middletown, Delaware, on State Route 1.\n\nTimeline:\n\nAs the chase continued, parts of the BMW began to disengage from the vehicle, hurtling into the air. An unidentified metal object struck the hood of a DSP vehicle, tearing into the hood.\n\nNext, the metal brake caliper separated from the car and crashed into the windshield of a different DSP vehicle, almost hitting the trooper inside.\n\nAs they approached Dover, officials say Casey began to speed up. About 12 miles south of Dover, a trooper tried to lay down traffic spikes, Casey saw them in enough time to swerve, nearly hitting the trooper standing there. The trooper ran out of the way of the vehicle to avoid being hit.\n\nAnother attempt at traffic spikes was made a short time later, but with the same results, as Casey swerved towards the trooper, who also had to jump out of the way to avoid being hit.\n\nDig deeper:\n\nCasey then merged onto Exit 86 toward Frederica, and as he did so, he hit a traffic sign and crashed into a utility pole in front of a local store.\n\nHe jumped out of the disabled vehicle and tried to make a run for it, but troopers grabbed him before he could elude them.\n\nHe then resisted, officials said, causing minor injuries to the troopers.\n\nBig picture view:\n\nOfficials said the troopers noticed Casey showed continued signs of impairment.\n\nHe was taken to a nearby barracks and a legal blood test was performed.\n\nCasey was then charged with assault, reckless endanger, resisting arrest with force, driving under the influence of a drug and other related offenses.\n\nHe is being held at the Sussex Correctional Institution on a $50,877 cash bond.",

        "fullContent": "“Captain America: Brave New World” infused some blockbuster cash into the North American box office, bringing in $88.5 million in ticket sales over the weekend, according to studio estimates Sunday. The Walt Disney Co. release is by far the biggest opener of 2025 and the company predicts it will hit $100 million domestically and $192.4 globally by the end of Monday's Presidents' Day holiday.\n\nIt’s Marvel's first major release since “Deadpool & Wolverine” broke records last summer and re-energized a Marvel fanbase that some worried was weakening after the poor showing for “The Marvels.”\n\nPlaying in 4,105 locations in the U.S. and Canada, “Brave New World” is also a major transition for the “Captain America” brand: Anointing Anthony Mackie’s Sam Wilson as the new Cap, officially taking over from Chris Evans, who played the character for almost a decade. Harrison Ford co-stars as the U.S. President who transforms into the Red Hulk.\n\nBut “Brave New World,” directed by Julius Onah, had a bit of a handicap going into the weekend: Poor reviews, though superhero movies can soar without the stamp of approval from critics. The film is currently sitting at 51% “rotten” on Rotten Tomatoes. It's not the worst in the Marvel Cinematic Universe — “Eternals” has a 47% rating and “Ant-Man and The Wasp: Quantumania” has a 46% — but the latest film is definitely on the very low end of the spectrum.\n\nGet top local stories in Philly delivered to you every morning. Sign up for NBC Philadelphia's News Headlines newsletter.\n\nIn his review for The Associated Press, Mark Kennedy wrote that it is, “a highly processed, empty calorie, regret-later candy of a movie.”\n\nAudiences were more generous in their opinions. The “verified audience score” from Rotten Tomatoes was 80% and its CinemaScore was a B-. Exit polls showed that men made up 63% of the opening weekend audience.\n\nThe bar for biggest opening of the year wasn’t terribly high: “Dog Man” held the title for two weeks with its $36 million launch.\n\nAnd “Brave New World's” showing is the middle range for an MCU film. Not accounting for inflation, it sits between “Guardians of the Galaxy” and “Thor: The Dark World.”\n\nIt also cost significantly less than many of the big budget Marvel movies, with a reported production price tag of $180 million, excluding the millions spent on marketing and promotion.\n\nAfter only one Marvel movie in 2024, “Brave New World” is the first of three major theatrical releases set for 2025. It is to be followed by “Thunderbolts(asterisk)” in May and “The Fantastic Four: First Steps” in July.\n\n“The superhero genre has taken a hit over the past few years, but audiences still have a huge interest in seeing them on the big screen,” said Paul Dergarabedian, the senior media analyst for Comscore.\n\nSecond place at this week's box office went to “Paddington in Peru,” the third installment in the beloved franchise, which finally opened in North America this weekend. Released by Sony, it earned an estimated $13 million and should hit $16 million by Monday. The StudioCanal film opened in the United Kingdom in early November 2024 and went into the weekend with $104 million from its international run.\n\nDougal Wilson took over directing duties for Paul King for this film, which also recast Emily Mortimer as Mrs. Brown, originally played by Sally Hawkins. The other main cast, including Ben Whishaw as Paddinton's voice, remained intact.\n\nSony and Screen Gems' slasher “Heart Eyes” landed in third place with $10 million, up 20% from its opening last weekend. Fourth place went to “Dog Man\" with $9.7 million.\n\nThe Chinese blockbuster “Ne Zha 2\" rounded out the top five. It opened on 660 screens in North America and made $7.2 million. Overall, the box office is up 20% from last year.\n\nThis weekend also saw the release of a new “Bridget Jones\" movie, subtitled “Mad About the Boy,” which went straight to Universal’s streaming service Peacock, forgoing theaters in the U.S. In the U.K. and Ireland it made an estimated $14.9 million, outgrossing “Captain America: Brave New World.\" Universal Pictures International reported $32.3 million in grosses from all 70 territories.\n\nFinal domestic figures will be released Tuesday. Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Comscore:\n\n1. “Captain America: Brave New World,” $88.5 million.\n\n2. “Paddington in Peru,” $13 million.\n\n3. “Heart Eyes,” $10 million.\n\n4. “Dog Man,” $9.7 million.\n\n5. “Ne Zha 2,” $7.2 million.\n\n6. “Love Hurts,” $4.4 million.\n\n7. “Mufasa: The Lion King,” $4.2 million.\n\n8. “One of Them Days,” $3 million.\n\n9. “Companion,” $1.9 million.\n\n10. “Becoming Led Zeppelin,” $1.8 million.",

        "fullContent": "White House border czar Tom Homan on Sunday denied allegations of a quid pro quo between the Trump administration and New York Mayor Eric Adams, calling the notion that the Justice Department moved to dismiss criminal charges against Adams in exchange for the mayor’s cooperation on immigration “ridiculous.”\n\nCNN anchor Dana Bash asked Homan, “It sounds like the DOJ dropped the case against Adams and, in exchange, he let you into Rikers,” referring to the New York City jail. “Is that what happened?”\n\n“No, I think that’s ridiculous,” Homan replied, saying the two have been discussing access to the Rikers Island jail for months.\n\nDuring a closed-door meeting with Homan on Thursday, Adams agreed to allow U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents to operate at Rikers.\n\nGet top local stories in Philly delivered to you every morning. Sign up for NBC Philadelphia's News Headlines newsletter.\n\nThe two men then sat for an interview with “Fox & Friends” on Friday, during which Homan said, “I came to New York City and I wasn’t going to leave with nothing,” adding he would be on Adams’ case and “be in his office, up his butt,” if the mayor did not follow through with his commitment.\n\nHoman, who served as acting ICE director in President Donald Trump’s first administration, said Sunday that the conversation between him and Adams — a former New York City police captain — was “cop to cop.”\n\n“I just think people are making a lot about nothing,” Homan said. “I mean, again, I went up there as the ICE director, now the border czar, and we collaborated on how to move illegal alien crime, decrease it down in New York City, and find the worst of the worst. And that’s what we talked about. It was cop to cop, not border czar to mayor, cop to cop.”\n\nThe Justice Department moved to dismiss corruption charges against Adams on Friday, following an internal mutiny that included a wave of resignations over the department’s handling of Adams’ case.\n\nAt least seven DOJ officials have resigned as part of the fallout of Adams’ legal saga, including Danielle R. Sassoon, who was the top federal prosecutor in Manhattan. Acting Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove ordered U.S. prosecutors in New York to dismiss the charges against Adams, arguing in part that the case was interfering with Adams’ ability to help the administration tackle illegal immigration.\n\nSassoon, a conservative who clerked for the late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, resigned in a sharply worded memo to Attorney General Pam Bondi, which said that during a Jan. 31 meeting with Bove and Adams’ lawyers, “Adams’s attorneys repeatedly urged what amounted to a quid pro quo, indicating that Adams would be in a position to assist with Department’s enforcement priorities only if the indictment were dismissed.”\n\nAdams, who was elected mayor in 2021 and is up for re-election in November, was indicted last year on bribery and fraud charges and had been facing trial in April.\n\nAdams has pleaded not guilty and has insisted he is innocent and the charges are politically motivated. Adams and his lawyer, Alex Spiro, vehemently denied any quid pro quo offered in the Jan. 31 meeting.\n\nThis article originally appeared on NBCNews.com. Read more from NBC News:",

They were involved in an avalanche off Cannon Cliffs in Franconia State Park.\n\nThe male and female climbers had planned to ice climb the famous Black Dike climbing route and began to hike in at 8 a.m. from the Lafayette Campground parking lot. Once they reached the base of the climbing route the snow gave away underneath them, causing an avalanche. The male slid about 300 feet before coming to a stop and was partially buried.\n\nThe female, who was uninjured, was able to call 911.

        "fullContent": "Secretary of State Marco Rubio, national security adviser Mike Waltz and special envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoff are headed to Saudi Arabia to initiate negotiations toward peace between Russia and Ukraine, two sources familiar with the matter told NBC News.\n\nThe timing of the travel was not specified, and it is unclear whether the trio have already departed.\n\nThe move comes just days after President Donald Trump said he spoke by phone with Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy about the prospect of beginning negotiations to end the war.\n\n“We agreed to work together, very closely, including visiting each other’s Nations,” Trump wrote in a Truth Social post Wednesday after the call. “We have also agreed to have our respective teams start negotiations immediately.”\n\nGet top local stories in Philly delivered to you every morning. Sign up for NBC Philadelphia's News Headlines newsletter.\n\nSenior Trump administration officials, including Vice President JD Vance, Rubio and U.S. special envoy to Ukraine Keith Kellogg, have been huddling in Germany this weekend for the Munich Security Conference, a forum for international security policy where the Russia-Ukraine war remains a critical topic of discussion.\n\nRubio spoke by phone with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov on Saturday. Their discussion included the war in Ukraine and other topics, according to readouts of the call from both countries.\n\nDuring a speech at the security conference Saturday, Zelenskyy said Ukraine must be involved with any negotiations to end the war.\n\n\"Ukraine will never accept deals made behind our backs,\" he said. \"No decisions about Ukraine without Ukraine, no decisions about Europe without Europe.\"\n\nDuring a panel discussion Saturday on the sidelines of the conference, Kellogg said that “of course” Ukrainians would be at the table in discussions to end the war. However, he said “the answer is no” when asked whether he could assure Europeans that they too would have a seat at the table.\n\n“When you sit at the table, there’s really, there’s two protagonists when you look at it, and there’s one, hopefully it’ll be an intermediary,” Kellogg added. When the moderator asked for clarification, he indicated that Ukrainians, Russians and Americans would be “at the table talking.”\n\nHe later said that a group not being at the table “doesn’t mean the interests are not taking a part of, they’re not considered, they’re not used, they’re not developed.”\n\nKellogg on Saturday defended the prospect of engaging with Putin in an effort to achieve peace between Russia and Ukraine, saying in Munich, “Whether you like it or not, you have to talk to adversaries.”\n\n“As a great secretary of defense, Gen. Mattis, once said: I may not like this son of a b----, but I got to talk to him,” he added.\n\nKellogg also said that Western leaders need to do more to enforce sanctions against Russia, adding that negotiations about ending the war could focus on Russia’s willingness to cede territory and targeting Putin’s oil revenue.\n\nBut some members of the administration have seemed reluctant in recent days to specify any particular concessions from Russia ahead of potential negotiations.\n\nAsked Thursday what Russia should give up in order to reach a deal with Ukraine, Trump declined to name specifics.\n\n“As far as the negotiation, it’s too early to say what’s going to happen. Maybe Russia will give up a lot, maybe they won’t, and it’s all dependent on what is going to happen,” Trump said during a news conference alongside Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.\n\nDefense Secretary Pete Hegseth, who has signaled the U.S. would be opposed to Ukraine joining NATO as part of a negotiated peace, indicated that the U.S. is likely to support negotiations in which Ukraine cedes territory that’s already been seized by the Kremlin.\n\n“We want, like you, a sovereign and prosperous Ukraine. But we must start by recognizing that returning to Ukraine’s pre-2014 borders is an unrealistic objective,” Hegseth said in a speech during a trip to NATO’s headquarters in Brussels on Wednesday.\n\nAbigail Williams, Nnamdi Egwuonwu and Megan Lebowitz contributed.\n\nThis article first appeared on NBCNews.com.

        "fullContent": "The mineral ilmenite is extracted from mounds of sand deep in the earth and refined using a method that summons the force of gravity, resulting in a substance that glimmers like a moonlit sky.\n\nUkraine boasts vast reserves of ilmenite — a key element used to produce titanium — in the heavy mineral sands that stretch for miles along the country’s embattled east.\n\nMuch of it, as with all of Ukraine’s critical minerals industry, is underdeveloped because of war as well as onerous state policies.\n\nThat is poised to change if U.S. President Donald Trump's administration agrees to a deal with Ukraine to exchange critical minerals for continued American military aid.\n\nGet top local stories in Philly delivered to you every morning. Sign up for NBC Philadelphia's News Headlines newsletter.\n\nIn the central region of Kirovohrad, the ilmenite open-pit mine is a canyon of precious deposits that its owner is keen to develop with U.S. companies. But many unknowns stand in the way of turning these riches into profit: cost, licensing terms and whether such a deal will be underpinned by security guarantees.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Saturday at the Munich Security Conference that he did not permit his ministers to sign a mineral resource agreement with the U.S. because the current version is not “ready to protect us, our interests.\"\n\nUkrainian businessmen with knowledge of the minerals industry also privately expressed skepticism about whether a deal is viable. The capital-intensive industry is unlikely to yield results in years, if not decades, as geological data is either limited or classified. Many question what conditions American companies are willing to risk to build up the industry and whether existing Ukrainian policies that have so far deterred local businessmen will accommodate foreign investors.\n\n“The main thing we can gain is certain security guarantees obtained through economic means, so that someone stronger than us has an interest in protecting us,” said Andriy Brodsky, CEO of Velta, a leading titanium mining company in Ukraine.\n\nThe question of security guarantees\n\nA deal, which would essentially barter one resource for another, could help strengthen Kyiv’s relationship with the Trump administration.\n\nThe United States is a major consumer of critical raw earth minerals such as lithium and gallium, two elements that Ukraine has in proven reserves. Trump has specifically mentioned rare earth elements, but these are not well researched, industry experts told The Associated Press.\n\nTitanium, used in aerospace, defense and industry, is also high in demand and the U.S. is a leading importer of ilmenite. Sourcing the minerals from Ukraine would reduce future reliance on Russia and China.\n\nIn exchange, Kyiv would continue to receive a steady stream of American weaponry that offers leverage against Moscow and without which Ukraine cannot ward off future Russian aggression in the event of a ceasefire.\n\nThe question of security guarantees is a sticking point for companies, Ukrainian businessmen and analysts said. A senior Ukrainian official, speaking anonymously to describe private conversations, told the AP that U.S. companies expressed interest in investing but needed to ensure their billions will be safeguarded in the event of renewed conflict. But once invested in Ukraine, the presence of American business interests alone might act as a guarantee, Brodsky said.\n\n“If this process starts, it will continue,” Brodsky said. “Once the investment figures exceed hundreds of billions, the Americans, a highly pragmatic people, will protect their profits earned on Ukrainian soil. They will defend their interests against Russia, China, Korea, Iran and anyone else. They will protect what they consider theirs.”\n\nGrowing American interest\n\nBrodsky, who just returned from a trip to Washington and New York, said the conversation among U.S. businesses is changing in Kyiv’s favor.\n\n“A lot of people in very serious and wealthy offices are saying that now, we — our country and my company — are in the right place and doing exactly what needs to be done at this moment,” he said.\n\nVelta has worked with American partners for many years. Brodsky has begun negotiating with companies he believes could be a partner in the event of a deal.\n\nUkraine has never been attractive to foreign investors because of prohibitive government policies — not offering incentives to attract foreigners, for instance. Brodsky believes that international companies will need to pair up with local partners to flourish.\n\nAmerican companies have several ways to enter the market, explained Ksenia Orynchak, director of the National Association of Extractive Industries of Ukraine, but would require traversing “certain circles of hell” in Ukraine's bureaucracy. Teaming up with an existing Ukrainian license owner is possibly the most straightforward.\n\nU.S. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth told the Ukraine Defense Contact Group that the Russia-Ukraine war \"must end\" but said that returning Ukraine to its pre-2014 borders was an \"unrealistic objective.\"\n\nShe said more exploration is needed in the field and hinted existing data may have been acquired through ulterior motives. Under the Soviet system, geologists stood to gain if they claimed to have found large reserves.\n\n“Someone did it so that Moscow would praise Ukrainian geologists or Soviet geologists,” she said.\n\nShe advises American investors to lower existing thresholds for exploration because bidding can take place in areas where reserves are only presumed, not proven.\n\n“I believe, and so does the expert community, that this is not right. In fact, we are selling a pig in a poke,” she said.\n\nA historically untapped sector\n\nAt the extraction site, the air is dense with ilmenite dust. When the afternoon sun’s rays pierce the darkened space, they sparkle and dance in the air. The soot covers the faces of workers who spend hours inside every day extracting the precious material from sand.\n\nThe gravity separation method removes unwanted elements in the ore and water separated from the mineral rains down through metal-lined floors. Workers are used to getting wet and don’t bat an eye. Titanium is developed from the purified ilmenite at a different facility.\n\nVelta began in the form of an expired license for geological exploration and a business plan for $7 million when Brodsky acquired the company. It would be eight years and many millions more invested before he could even think about production capacity.\n\nThe deal also does not factor in a crucial element that could prove challenging later: The position of Ukrainian people themselves. According to the Constitution, the subsoil where extraction would take place belongs to Ukraine.\n\n“I am very afraid that they (Ukrainian people) already had disapproving reviews, that everything is being given away. Who allowed him? He had no right? And so on,” Orynchak said.\n\nThose sensitivities were echoed among workers at the Velta mine. Speaking anonymously to voice his true thoughts, one said: “If you have a vegetable garden in your home, do you invite a foreigner to take it?”\n\nThe high risk often is a key reason that some Ukrainian businessmen privately express skepticism about the deal.\n\nWhen one businessman of a major group of companies heard about the arms-for-minerals deal, his first impression was: “This is just hot air,” he said, speaking on condition of anonymity to speak freely about his thoughts. “This is a very capital intensive industry. Just to take ground from an open pit will cost you billions. Not millions, billions.”\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press journalists Kwiyeon Ha in London and Volodymyr Yurchuk contributed.

        "fullContent": "The DEI practices of corporations are already facing intense scrutiny from the Trump administration, from minority hiring to supplier diversity goals.\n\nMany major companies have abandoned or at least scaled back DEI programs, from Amazon to McDonald's, Alphabet, Target, Ford, Lowe's and Walmart.\n\nCorporate charity arms will be scrutinized, too, such as big pledges made by big firms to invest in themes including racial equity, and possibly even at the level of employee charitable donation matching programs.\n\nAs more companies scrap or pare back DEI pledges and goals related to hiring and supplier diversity, from Amazon to Target and Meta, corporate philanthropic activities are also ripe for review.\n\nCompanies routinely support DEI initiatives through foundations or other corporate giving programs. According to a new survey by The Conference Board, changes among corporate philanthropy leaders are already underway to reflect the new political reality and intense focus from the Trump administration on DEI practices within both the government and business world.\n\nMore corporate charity arms plan to ramp up company efforts around economic opportunity and education. Simultaneously, they foresee scaling back initiatives around racial and gender equality, which became a larger focus in recent years and in particular after the murder of George Floyd. JPMorgan Chase, for example, launched a $30 billion racial equity program that involved its charitable giving programs, among many other parts of the bank.\n\nGet top local stories in Philly delivered to you every morning. Sign up for NBC Philadelphia's News Headlines newsletter.\n\nCorporates are free to fund who they want, as long as it's not illegal, but they are under pressure, said Andrew Jones, author of the report and senior ESG researcher at The Conference Board. \"None of them wants to be the one attacked by the federal government\" or activists or others, he said. \"That's a major source of reputational risk to companies.\"\n\nThere are many ways that companies' philanthropic efforts could be impacted by recent political and legal developments, and the conversations are starting to take place, even though companies' philanthropic practices haven't been the main area of focus in the wake of President Trump's executive orders relating to the private sector's DEI initiatives.\n\n\"Companies are still, by and large, playing catch up and getting their arms around\" how the orders apply to their core business, and \"the steps they need to take, if any, to modify historical business practices,\" said Michael R. Littenberg, a partner at law firm Ropes & Gray, and global head of the firm's ESG, corporate social responsibility and business and human rights compliance practice.\n\nHowever, companies have started to expand their thinking into the potential impacts on corporate giving and philanthropic efforts. Companies are asking, \"how can we succeed without being sued?\" said Christen Graham, founder and president of Giving Strong, a consulting firm that advises corporations, foundations and nonprofits on corporate social responsibility and philanthropy.\n\nCompanies need to tread carefully. Many legal challenges to DEI-related policies have been brought in the wake of the U.S. Supreme Court's landmark ruling in 2023 that affirmative action in college admissions is unconstitutional, and the scrutiny is intensifying with executive orders from the new Trump administration targeting DEI.\n\nLast year, the American Alliance for Equal Rights, headed by conservative activist Edward Blum, sued Fearless Fund, which invests in under-resourced entrepreneurs including women of color-led businesses. At issue was a particular grant contest that awarded grants to Black women-owned small businesses, which American Alliance claimed was a violation of federal civil rights law. The parties settled the case in September with Fearless agreeing to permanently close the grant program.\n\nIn January, American Alliance sued McDonald's, alleging that its HACER National Scholarship Program unlawfully excluded non-Hispanic applicants because of a requirement that applicants for the scholarship have at least one parent of Hispanic/Latino heritage.\n\nMcDonald's disagreed, but said settling was in the best interest of scholarship applicants. The company said it would remove the offending criteria and instead ask applicants to demonstrate their impact and contribution to the Hispanic/Latino community through their activities, leadership and service.\n\nMcDonald's is among the many corporations to have significantly scaled back major DEI program goals.\n\nWhere corporate giving may go\n\nQuestions about future policies abound. \"You've got a lot of companies and non-profit organizations and universities who are worried about their commitments to diversity and what that commitment can look like in this new world,\" said Danielle Conley, who leads the anti-discrimination and civil rights practice group at law firm Latham & Watkins.\n\nIf a foundation has a grant application process that is racially exclusive, it's ripe for challenge, she said. This may be different from corporate gifts made to organizations, depending on the circumstances, but there are a lot of uncertainties that will likely be fleshed out in the coming years. \"Each company or organization has to do an in-depth evaluation\" of its policies, practices and programs, she said.\n\nCompanies also need to assess their risk tolerance. More risk-averse companies may decide to pull back on certain giving activities in light of the uncertainty, including some things that are legal under today's standards, she said.\n\nMany companies remain committed to DEI initiatives.\n\nA January survey by The Association of Corporate Citizenship Professionals found that 89% of respondents plan to stay on track or increase their corporate social responsibility commitments, said Andrea Wood, chief executive of the membership organization focused on advancing corporate social impact.\n\nA majority of social impact work focuses on low-income communities and companies understand there's a strong business imperative to do so, Wood said. \"Companies are not going to walk away from that.\"\n\nJamie Dimon, chairman and chief executive of JPMorgan Chase recently reiterated the firm's commitment to DEI in an interview with CNBC from Davos. \"We are going to continue to reach out to the Black community, Hispanic community, the LGBT community, the veterans community…\" he said in the interview, noting that if the company was told it was doing something wrong it would \"make modifications\" to its policies. He noted that the company is \"very proud\" of the work it has done to \"lift up cities, schools, states, hospitals, countries, companies, and we're going to do more of the same.\"\n\nCompanies that firmly believe in DEI will find ways, if necessary, to reshape their philanthropic goals such that their objectives are met without running into legal trouble, said F. Warren McFarlan, Albert H. Gordon Professor of Business Administration Emeritus at Harvard Business School. Nobody's talking about not giving charity to the poor, he said. But targeting efforts to certain zip codes, instead of explicitly focusing on race or ethnicity can accomplish a company's goals without causing legal concerns, he said.\n\nOrganizations have to walk a fine line because research suggests that younger talent cares deeply about working for companies that care about environmental and socio-economic issues. \"Companies have to attract the next generation coming in, and if you're seen as out of line [with their values] you don't necessarily attract the kind of people you want,\" McFarlan said.\n\nRevising the language companies use to describe philanthropic efforts, as has been done with DEI — there is much more talk about inclusion now than diversity — may occur within companies that remain committed to their non-profit partners, with tweaks to how they describe their efforts. Over one-third (37%) of executives say they are revising the language and terminology used to describe their initiatives, both internally and externally, according to The Conference Board data.\n\nInstead of phrases related to racial, social or environmental justice, there is more likely to be language on environmental or community resilience, as well as belonging and inclusion and economic opportunity. \"It's trying to be a bit less controversial. Still doing the same work, but doing it in a less polarizing way,\" Jones said.\n\nCompanies said they are making these changes primarily in response to political, social and legal developments and to minimize backlash, according to The Conference Board.\n\nFor employees at big companies, a lot of this work will go on behind the scenes and remain invisible to the rank-and-file. However, one way in which all employees may experience these changes is through corporate charitable donation matching programs. The chilling effect of the government's pushback on DEI could also start to impact on companies' that currently match employee donations to charities, some industry participants said.\n\nCompanies have varying approaches, with some more restrictive on what's an acceptable match. Graham of Giving Strong said she expects some companies will change their matching policies, or, at the very least review them, in the wake of greater scrutiny. \"Everything is under review right now when it comes to discretionary funds,\" she said.",

Sign up for NBC Philadelphia's News Headlines newsletter.\n\nIt’s become appointment television over the years as the show has skewered presidents, politics and pop culture and been a platform for the biggest musical stars of the moment. As streaming has altered television viewing, “SNL” sketches, host monologues and short comedy films remain popular on social media and routinely rack up millions of views on YouTube.\n\nEach “SNL” episode holds at least some surprises, and Sunday’s special is no different. While NBC has revealed some of the stars who are expected to appear, many of the special's moments, cameos and music performances remain a surprise.\n\nHere’s what to know ahead of “SNL50: The Anniversary Celebration.”\n\nWhen does the ‘SNL’ 50th anniversary tribute show start?\n\nNBC will air “SNL50: The Anniversary Celebration” on Sunday beginning at 8 p.m. Eastern and 5 p.m. Pacific. The anniversary show will also stream on Peacock.\n\nA red carpet show hosted by “SNL” alumna Leslie Jones and NBC News' Willie Geist will precede the special, beginning at 7 p.m. Eastern on NBC and Peacock.\n\nWhich ‘SNL’ alums are slated to appear?\n\nPrepare for generations of “SNL” stars to return for Sunday’s special. NBC says in addition to Murphy and Fey, you can expect: Adam Sandler, Amy Poehler, Andy Samberg, Chris Rock, Fred Armisen, Jason Sudeikis, Jimmy Fallon, Kate McKinnon, Kristen Wiig, Maya Rudolph, Molly Shannon, Pete Davidson, Seth Meyers, Tracy Morgan, Will Ferrell and Will Forte. Current cast member Kenan Thompson’s appearance was also touted.\n\nSome members of the first “Saturday Night Live” cast, known as the Not Ready for Prime Time Players, will appear, including Chase, Laraine Newman, Garrett Morris and Jane Curtin. A publicist for Dan Aykroyd, the lone remaining surviving member, did not respond to a request for comment on whether he would attend.\n\nWhich former hosts will appear on ‘SNL50’?\n\nSteve Martin, who has left an indelible comedic mark on “SNL” over the years, will be among the many successful hosts returning for the show’s 50th celebration.\n\nOther prolific and returning hosts range from actors like Tom Hanks, Martin Short and Scarlett Johansson (who is married to current “SNL” cast member Colin Jost) to athletes like Peyton Manning. Former “SNL” writer John Mulaney will appear, as will Adam Driver, Ayo Edebiri, Kim Kardashian, Paul Simon, Pedro Pascal, Quinta Brunson, Robert De Niro and Woody Harrelson.\n\nHow will ‘SNL’ honor its musical legacy?\n\nIn some ways, it already has. Radio City Music Hall on Friday hosted the star-packed “SNL50: The Homecoming Concert” with a lineup that included Cher, Miley Cyrus, Arcade Fire, David Byrne, Post Malone and Nirvana.\n\nSunday’s special will include appearances by Paul McCartney, Sabrina Carpenter, Bad Bunny, Cyrus and other music stars, though the show hasn’t said whether all will perform. McCartney has used New York’s Bowery Ballroom as a warm-up spot, hosting three surprise shows this week.\n\nThe musical legacy of “SNL” is also explored in the documentary “Ladies and Gentlemen ... 50 Years of SNL Music,” from the Oscar-winning Questlove. It’s currently streaming on Peacock.\n\n\"Saturday Night Live\" is celebrating its 50th season on air, and Peacock just dropped a brand-new, four-part docuseries that looks back on the show. So many stories are told, including how cast members felt auditioning for Lorne Michaels. \"SNL50: Beyond Saturday Night\" is streaming now on Peacock.",

        "fullContent": "As President Donald Trump approaches the first-month mark in his second term, he has moved with dizzying speed and blunt force to reorder American social and political norms and the economy while redefining the U.S. role in the world.\n\nAt the same time, he has empowered Elon Musk, an unelected, South African-born billionaire, to help engineer the firing of thousands of federal employees and potentially shutter entire agencies created by Congress.\n\nThose efforts have largely overshadowed Trump's crackdowns on immigration and the U.S.-Mexico border, and his efforts to remake social policy by wiping out diversity, equity and inclusion programs and rolling back transgender rights.\n\nThe president has also imposed scores of new tariffs against U.S. trade partners and threatened more, even as economists warn that will pass costs on to U.S. consumers and feed inflation.\n\nGet top local stories in Philly delivered to you every morning. Sign up for NBC Philadelphia's News Headlines newsletter.\n\nHere's a look at the first four weeks:\n\nMass federal firings begin\n\nNews4's Dominique Moody had new reaction from a federal worker affected by recent mass layoffs.\n\nThe Trump administration fired thousands of workers who were still in probationary periods common among new hires. Some had less than an hour to leave their offices.\n\nThose potentially losing jobs include medical scientists, energy infrastructure specialists, foreign service employees, FBI agents, prosecutors, educational and farming data experts, overseas aid workers and even human resources personnel who would otherwise have to manage the dismissals.\n\nAt the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which was created to protect the public after the 2008 financial crisis, employees say the administration not only wants to cut nearly the entire workforce but also erase all its data from the past 12 years. The administration agreed to pause any further dismantling of the agency until March 3, under a judge's order.\n\nWhile Trump promised to turn Washington upside down, his moves could have far-reaching implications for thousands of federal employees around the country and drive up the unemployment rate if large numbers of layoffs happen at once.\n\nLegal challenges mount\n\nCourt challenges to Trump’s policies started on Inauguration Day and have continued at a furious pace since Jan. 20. The administration is facing some 70 lawsuits nationwide challenging his executive orders and moves to downsize the federal government.\n\nThe Republican-controlled Congress is putting up little resistance, so the court system is ground zero for pushback. Judges have issued more than a dozen orders at least temporarily blocking aspects of Trump's agenda, ranging from an executive order to end U.S. citizenship extended automatically to people born in this country to giving Musk's team access to sensitive federal data.\n\nWhile many of those judges were nominated by Democratic presidents, Trump has gotten unfavorable rulings from judges picked by Republican presidents, too. Trump suggested he could target the judiciary, saying, “Maybe we have to look at the judges.\" The administration has said in the meantime that it will appeal, while White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt railed against the orders slowing the president's agenda, calling each “an abuse of the rule of law.”\n\nThe administration has notched a few wins, too, most significantly when a judge allowed it to move forward with a deferred resignation program spearheaded by Musk.\n\nThe economic outlook worsens\n\nAmid the policy upheaval, the latest economic data could prompt some White House worries.\n\nInflation rose at a monthly rate of 0.5% in January, according to the Labor Department. Over the past three months, the consumer price index has increased at an annual rate of 4.5% -- a sign that inflation is heating up again after having cooled for much of 2024.\n\nTrump told voters he could lower inflation, and do so almost immediately after taking office. But Leavitt, while blaming Trump's predecessor, Democrat Joe Biden, acknowledged the latest inflation indicators were \"worse than expected.”\n\nMore trouble signs came when the Commerce Department reported that retail sales slumped 0.9% on a monthly basis in January. A drop that large could signal a weakening in consumer confidence and economic growth.\n\nThe Federal Reserve’s report on industrial production also found that factory output slipped 0.1% in January, largely due to a 5.2% drop in the making of motor vehicles and parts.\n\nThese could all be blips, which means the monthly data in February will really matter.\n\nThe ‘fair trade’ Trump wants isn't necessarily fair\n\nPresident Donald Trump signed a memorandum Thursday which seeks to impose \"fair and reciprocal\" trade tariffs on all major U.S. trading partners, including longtime allies.\n\nAfter previously imposing tariffs on China and readying import taxes on Canada and Mexico, Trump rolled out what he called the “big one.” He said his administration would put together new tariffs in the coming weeks and months to match what other countries charge.\n\nOther nations hardly find Trump’s approach fair.\n\nFrom their vantage point, he is including items other than tariffs such as value added taxes, which are akin to sales taxes. That means the rates could be much higher than a standard tariff in Europe.\n\nOn top of that, Trump plans separate additional tariffs on autos, computer chips and pharmaceuticals, in addition to the 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum that he announced on Monday.\n\nIt is not clear whether these trade penalties are mainly negotiating tools or ways for Trump to raise revenues. So far, he has suggested that they are both.\n\nCongress watches its authority erode. But there are signs of pushback\n\nCongress finds itself confounded by the onslaught as its institutional power — as the Constitution’s first branch of government with its unmatched authority over federal spending — is being eroded in real time.\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., said he finds the work of Musk's team “very exciting.” Johnson said Trump is “taking legitimate executive action.\"\n\nBut even among congressional Republicans there were small signs of protest emerging — letters being written and phone calls being made — to protect their home-state interests and constituents as funding for programs, services and government contracts is being dismantled.\n\nRep. Carlos Gimenez, R-Fla., urged the Homeland Security Department not to issue blanket deportations for Venezuelan migrants who fled their country and now call the Miami-area home. “I’m not powerless. I’m a member of Congress,” he said.\n\nDemocratic lawmakers have joined protesters outside shuttered federal offices, arguing Trump and Musk had gone too far. Democrats suggested legislation to protect various programs, and even filed articles of impeachment against the president over his plans to bulldoze and redevelop Gaza.\n\nTrump wants a new world order\n\nWith his phone call to Russian President Vladimir Putin this past week, Trump is hoping he initiated the beginning of the end of the Kremlin's war on Ukraine.\n\nThe leaders agreed to have their teams “start negotiations immediately.” After getting off the phone with Putin, Trump called Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to discuss getting both sides to the negotiating table.\n\nThe Putin call is a monumental development in a war that has left hundreds of thousands dead or seriously wounded.\n\nBut the way ahead remains complicated.\n\nZelenskyy said he will not meet with Putin until a plan for peace is hammered out by Trump. Trump has gotten blowback when European leaders sharply criticized him and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth for suggesting that NATO membership was not in the cards for Ukraine.\n\nThe White House faces a further quandary with Zelenskyy wanting the U.S. and other countries to provide security guarantees for Ukraine, and Zelenskyy insisting that he and Trump iron out an agreement on the contours of any peace deal.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Aamer Madhani in Munich and AP Congressional Correspondent Lisa Mascaro contributed to this report.",

And they are going to interview Eagles quarterbacks coach Doug Nussmeier for their offensive coordinator vacancy, NFL Network’s Ian Rapoport reported.\n\nWhile Eagles head coach Nick Sirianni definitely doesn’t like the idea of his staff getting poached, there’s nothing he can do about a position coach taking a coordinator role.

Sign up for NBC Philadelphia's News Headlines newsletter.\n\nNussmeier seems like an obvious choice for Moore. Nussmeier and Moore have bene together with the Cowboys, Chargers and now Eagles. In fact, Nussmeier was the only coach that Moore brought with him to Philly when he became the offensive coordinator last offseason.\n\nEagles passing game coordinator Kevin Patullo has been linked to the Saints’ OC opening, as well as being listed as a potential replacement for Moore in Philly.\n\nWhile the Eagles had a run-heavy offense in 2024, Nussmeier seemed to forge a strong connection with Jalen Hurts, who won Super Bowl MVP.\n\nAt the defensive coordinator spot, the Saints have already interviewed Vikings DBs coach Daronte Jones and are also going to interview 49ers assistant HC Brandon Staley for the opening. While Staley might be the favorite, Parker is an attractive candidate.\n\nIn his first year with the Eagles under Vic Fangio, Parker’s defensive backs had a tremendous season. The Eagles had the No. 1 pass defense in the NFL on their way to a Super Bowl win. The Eagles got high-level play from two rookies in Quinyon Mitchell and Cooper DeJean. And the entire secondary worked in harmony this season.\n\nParker, 33, coached under Fangio in Denver in 2021 and stayed there from 2021-23 as their defensive backs coach. He previously worked for the Packers from 2019-20 as a defensive quality control coach.\n\nSubscribe to Eagle Eye anywhere you get your podcasts:\n\nApple Podcasts | YouTube Music | Spotify | Stitcher | Simplecast | RSS | Watch on YouTube",

The vehicle had been reported stolen out of Virginia, officials said.\n\nThe driver, later identified as 29-year-old Geovanni Otero, initially complied with the troopers before fleeing at a high speed, according to officials. Otero led the troopers on a mile-long chase that lasted about a minute before he crashed the vehicle and fled on foot, state police said.\n\nThe troopers then captured Otero a short distance from the scene of the crash.\n\nGet top local stories in Philly delivered to you every morning.

He was taken to the hospital where he was treated for minor injuries.

Rivera’s body was found buried in a shallow grave near Champion Park Playground on the 900 block of Tustin Avenue in Northeast Philadelphia back on Nov. 7, 2024. Police sources told NBC10 Otero was the last person she was seen with before her death.

        "fullContent": "Letters went out to dozens of probationary employees in at least one section of the Department of Transportation that said part of the reason they were being fired was for poor performance, according to a copy of the letter obtained by NBC News.\n\nBut as a source familiar and a secondary document viewed by NBC News laid out, most of those employees were rated as being “exceptional” performers by their supervisors.\n\nWe’re looking to hear from federal government workers. If you’re willing to talk with us, please email us at tips@nbcuni.com or contact us through one of these methods.\n\n“Employee has demonstrated exceptional performance and has no conduct issues,” supervisor reviews read for many of the laid-off workers.\n\nGet top local stories in Philly delivered to you every morning. Sign up for NBC Philadelphia's News Headlines newsletter.\n\n“These letters that we’re sending these employees, I feel so bad because they’re lying,” the person familiar said. “All of them, pretty much, were exceptional performers. It’s just crazy to me.”\n\nThe firings come as the Trump administration steps up its purge of the federal workforce. But they’re being done so quickly, and are often directed by people with no government experience, that agencies are having to contend with the messy fallout — which has included trying to un-fire people.\n\nOn Thursday, Office of Personnel Management officials notified agencies that they should cut loose their probationary employees, which could affect hundreds of thousands of people, according to OPM data, though the exact number of those who will be let go was not immediately clear.\n\nProbationary status has nothing to do with performance; it typically indicates someone who has been working in the federal government for less than two years — before full civil service protections kick in. It can also apply to longtime civil service workers who move to a different agency or job.\n\nRobert F. Kennedy Jr. was confirmed by the Senate as the Secretary of Health and Human Services on Thursday.\n\n“The U.S. Department of Transportation finds, that based on your performance you have not demonstrated that your further employment at the Department of Transportation would be in the public interest,” the letter to fired staffers read. “For this reason, the Department of Transportation is removing you from your position with the Department of Transportation and the federal civil service effective today.”\n\nFederal regulations state that probationary employees “shall” be terminated during the probationary period “if the employee fails to demonstrate fully his or her qualifications for continued employment.” Moreover, regulations state that “information in the notice as to why the employee is being terminated shall, as a minimum, consist of the agency’s conclusions as to the inadequacies of his performance or conduct.”\n\nA Department of Transportation spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment, nor did the White House. McLaurine Pinover, an OPM spokesperson, deferred to the Department of Transportation and said the administration would not be able to provide full details on how many probationary employees were cut across the government until Tuesday.\n\n“The probationary period is a continuation of the job application process, not an entitlement for permanent employment,” an OPM spokesperson said in an earlier statement. “Agencies are taking independent action in light of the recent hiring freeze and in support of the President’s broader efforts to restructure and streamline the federal government to better serve the American people at the highest possible standard.”\n\nWith the Trump administration seeking to cut up to 10% of the federal workforce, mass firings have at times been done in a haphazard manner. One employee at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau who was told they were fired provided NBC News with a copy of a letter informing them of their termination that did not even include their name. Instead, it was addressed to “[EmployeeFirstName] [EmployeeLastName]” and was filled with other placeholder text including “[JobTitle],” “[Division]” and “[AppointmentDate].”\n\nAnd on Friday, National Nuclear Security Administration officials sought to notify some employees who were fired the day before that they are now due to be reinstated — but struggled to find them because they didn’t have their new contact information.\n\n“The termination letters for some NNSA probationary employees are being rescinded, but we do not have a good way to get in touch with those personnel,” read an email sent to NNSA employees and obtained by NBC News.\n\nIn addition to the potential for hundreds of thousands of probationary employees to be let go, the White House has said about 75,000 people have accepted their offer of “deferred resignation” as of Wednesday, though NBC News cannot independently verify that total. The federal government employs more than 2 million workers, and their total compensation makes up about 6.6% of the overall budget.\n\nAttorney General Pam Bondi announced the Trump administration sued the state of New York due to policies that are blocking federal authorities from enforcing immigration laws.\n\nJudges have halted some of this wide-ranging effort to rapidly upend the government, though a federal judge did allow the deferred resignation program to move forward.\n\nCommenting on the legality of his administration’s actions on Saturday, President Donald Trump posted a remark on social media that has generally been attributed to the French leader Napoleon Bonaparte.\n\n“He who saves his Country does not violate any Law,” Trump wrote.\n\nThis article first appeared on NBCNews.com.

        "fullContent": "The IRS will lay off thousands of probationary workers in the middle of tax season, according to two sources familiar with the agency's plans, and cuts could happen as soon as next week.\n\nThis comes as the Trump administration intensified sweeping efforts to shrink the size of the federal workforce, by ordering agencies to lay off nearly all probationary employees who had not yet gained civil service protection.\n\nIt's unclear how many IRS workers will be affected.\n\nPreviously, the administration announced a plan to offer buyouts to almost all federal employees through a “deferred resignation program” to quickly reduce the government workforce. The program deadline was Feb. 6, and administration officials said employees who accept will be able to stop working while still collecting a paycheck until Sept. 30.\n\nGet top local stories in Philly delivered to you every morning. Sign up for NBC Philadelphia's News Headlines newsletter.\n\nHowever, IRS employees involved in the 2025 tax season were told they will not be allowed to accept a buyout offer from the Trump administration until after the taxpayer filing deadline, according to a letter sent recently to IRS employees.\n\nIt is unclear how many workers will be impacted by the layoff announcement plan. Representatives from the U.S. Treasury and IRS did not respond to Associated Press requests for comment.\n\nJan. 27 was the official start date of the 2025 tax season, and the IRS expects more than 140 million tax returns to be filed by the April 15 deadline. The Biden administration invested heavily in the IRS through an $80 billion infusion of funds in Democrats' Inflation Reduction Act, which included plans to hire tens of thousands of new employees to help with customer service and enforcement as well as new technology to update the tax collection agency.\n\nRepublicans have been successful at clawing back that money, and billionaire Elon Musk and his Department of Government Efficiency have called for the U.S. to “delete entire agencies” from the federal government as part of his to radically cut spending and restructure its priorities.\n\nElected officials are trying to fight against DOGE plans. Attorneys general from 14 states challenged the authority of to access sensitive government data and exercise “virtually unchecked power” in a lawsuit filed Thursday.\n\nThe lawsuit, filed in federal court in Washington, says the actions taken by Musk at the helm of DOGE can only be taken by a nominated and Senate-confirmed official. It cites constitutional provisions that delineate the powers of Congress and the president.\n\nPresident Trump announced Sunday night on his Truth Social site that the government would stop minting the one-cent coin to cut costs.",

He produces all products from the hive, from an assortment of honeys to beeswax candles, including his most unusual offering from a hive that smelled like maple bacon. Lab tests at Penn State University determined the honey was being made with the help of the spotted lantern flies which had attacked the trees giving the bees access to the sap. He tested the honey out at a cheese and honey pairing at the Free Library and says it was the hit of the night.\n\nDon manages about 150 hives in neighborhoods around the city with the zip code on top of his jar indicating the bee's foraging grounds.

        "fullContent": "Best gaming laptops from MSI, Acer and more\n\nAs a participant in multiple affiliate marketing programs, Localish will earn a commission for certain purchases. See full disclaimer below*\n\nIf you're a casual gamer you might not think you need a gaming laptop, but having one can be great for competitive gamers, streamers or anyone who spends time playing cooperatively with their friends daily. Below, you'll find the best gaming laptops at every price point, plus the features you might want to keep in mind before shopping for one.\n\nGaming laptops buying guide:\n\nScreen size and resolution: You might want a larger screen size on your gaming laptop if you're dealing with games with a lot of moving parts. That said, a larger screen size usually commands a higher price point. Below, we've highlighted gaming laptops with screen sizes of 14 and 16-inch. The resolution states how clear your picture will be. A higher resolution is preferred for competitive gamers. The below laptops have at least a Full HD resolution, but we've also included options for 4K (four times the clarity of a physical HD laptop).\n\nOperating System: An OS usually handles all the application programs on your computer, including how the RAM is managed. Windows OS 11 is the best for gaming, but you can also use Atlast OS which optimizes system performance and lowers latency.\n\nRAM: You'll want at least 16 GB of RAM on your gaming laptop. This is required to run any AAA titles (games produced by major publishers) at their native resolutions and without lags. If you're looking to stream while gaming, go higher with a 32 GB laptop.\n\nStorage: Ideally you'll want a laptop with at least 512 GB of storage. This sounds like a lot, but games are usually at least 100 GB, so with a 512 GB laptop you'll be able to store 4-5 games at a time. You can also purchase additional SSDs if you need a higher amount of storage in the short term.\n\nBest gaming laptops\n\nAmazon MSI Cyborg 14 $1099 Shop now\n\nI tested this laptop for about a month and was impressed by both its performance and design. It's surprisingly lightweight, stays cool to the touch while gaming, and has a tactile, responsive keyboard for quick feedback. There is also up to 1 TB of storage available, and the 14-inch display FHD+ display is just big and bright enough to keep track of all your in-game characters. Its fan and in-built cooling system is not that noisy either and the backlit keyboard is great for gaming after hours. I honestly love this piece of gaming equipment and think it's a great laptop for beginner and seasoned gamers alike.\n\nBest Buy ASUS - ROG Zephyrus G14 $1599 Shop now\n\nThis is a great laptop for beginners and expert gamers alike. It comes with 16 GB of RAM, a Full HD resolution, and a Windows 11 operating system for quick gameplay with no lag time. It also boasts rapid response times (the lower the response time, the quicker your laptop is) and has 1TB of in-built storage which means it's able to store a decent amount of games. It offers intelligent cooling which should also keep this pick from quickly heating up, and six speakers equipped with Domby Atmos, allowing you to use it without a pair of good-quality gaming headphones. You'll also get three months of Xbox game pass included which will give you access to 100s of free games - including new titles.\n\nAmazon Razer Blade 14 (2024) $2699.99 Shop now\n\nRazer just announced the new and thinner Razer Blade 16 at CES, but you'll have to wait for a little before you can shop that pick. In fact, most Razer laptops are currently out of stock at major retailers. That said, you can currently purchase the Razer Blade 14 - last year's release. It has 32 GB of RAM making it a strong pick, and it also carries a whole 1TB of storage. Plus, it has a Windows 11 operating system similar to some of the other picks on this list. Battery life lasts eight hours (but keep in mind that gaming laptops are notorious for fast-depleting batteries due to how heavy-duty most AAA titles are). It is also one of the lightest Razer laptops around, making it a great buy for those always on the go.\n\nAmazon HP Omen 16 $1199 Shop now\n\nHP's 2023 Omen is still a top contender. For starters, it has a wide, 16.1-inch Full HD display with an anti-glare screen so you can game wherever you are. This option also has 1 TB of storage (but the brand offers options up to 4 TB if you need it) and like the other picks on our list, a fully customizable RGB backlit keyboard and built-in speakers. It weighs around five pounds and also comes with multiple USB port options. Plus, since it has 32GB of RAM it can handle most games with ease - you can also customize it to up to 64 GB of RAM.\n\n* By clicking on the featured links, visitors will leave this site and be directed to third-party e-commerce sites that operate under different terms and privacy policies.

I couldn't imagine playing anywhere else,\" said DeJean.\n\nHe says he's still from the Super Bowl win.\n\n\"Me getting my first pick, Super Bowl on my Birthday and then winning the game, best part about it. Getting to hold that Lombardi trophy,\" said DeJean.\n\nCooper DeJean wasn't the only Eagles player spending time with fans, cornerback Darius Slay stopped by Dick's Sporting Goods in King of Prussia.\n\nThe line also wrapped around the building for Slay where he was signing autographs and taking pictures.\n\n\"I feel like I'm very much loved here,\" said Slay. \"It feels good man, show you the fans appreciate us as players and I'm thankful for the fan base. I'm loving it.\"\n\nSlay says he's embracing all the love, and he tells Action News' Sharifa Jackson he plans to relax this off-season.\n\n\"I'm going to take some time to relax, play my video game, golf a little bit and attend some of my kids football games and special events,\" said Slay.",

We can't be great without the greatness of others and that certainly applies to our fans,\" said head coach Nick Sirianni.\n\nEagles general manager Howie Roseman, his forehead cut from a beer can thrown his way, took the podium with the Lombardi Trophy in hand and proclaimed, \"I bleed for this city!\"\n\nEagles executive VP and general manager Howie Roseman enjoys a cigar during the team's NFL football Super Bowl 59 parade and celebration, Friday, Feb. 14, 2025, in Philadelphia.

Brown also took the stage, and at the conclusion of his speech recited the criticism that was leveled at him throughout the season.\n\n\"They said I was a diva, they said all I care about was stats,\" Brown said. \"You gonna get all those things wrong about me, but one thing you get right: \"I'm a f---ing champion!\"\n\nBarkley, along with many other players, hopped off the open-air buses to walk along the parade route and exchanged high-fives with fans who pressed against teetering barricades.\n\nEagles RB Saquon Barkley hopped off the bus and greeted fans along the route during the Super Bowl Championship Parade!\n\nJordan Jaindl, who couldn't make it to the 2018 parade after the Eagles won their first Super Bowl, wasn't going to miss this one, bringing his wife and three daughters from Binghamton, New York.

We're going to stay gritty.\"\n\nFULL SPEECH: Brandon Graham wraps up Super Bowl victory parade celebrations.\n\nGraham, 11 weeks after tearing his triceps and declaring that he was out for the rest of the season, returned to play 13 snaps in the Super Bowl. Prior to the season, he had announced his intention to retire after his 15th year in the league, but left his future plans more open-ended during his parade speech Friday.\n\n\"I'm so thankful for my kids, my family. So thankful to be a part of this organization. You guys made me what I am today,\" said Graham, who was the last Eagles player to speak. \"Only problem I have with this season is that it's over. We getting ready for next year.\"\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.",

CLARY/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nSign up for our email newsletter to stay up-to-date on the latest local sports news throughout Philadelphia.\n\nThe NBA All-Star break could not have come sooner for the Philadelphia 76ers and their fans. Given how poorly this season has gone, it would be welcomed if the Sixers could just stay on break.\n\nA season from Hell does not even begin to describe the bad vibes that have permeated through this team since training camp. It is now mid-February, with the playoffs starting in two months, and the Sixers are somehow in a worse spot than they were when their record was 3-14 through 17 games.\n\nEvery single main character for the Sixers has played a leading role in this debacle. It starts at the top with Daryl Morey and Nick Nurse — a fish rots from the head down.\n\nTyrese Maxey got off to a rough individual start this season and, for the first time in his career, showed cracks in the armor of his effervescent personality.\n\nPaul George was supposed to be the team’s missing connector, but he has instead brought his lackadaisical “California cool” to South Philadelphia, admittedly the worst place in the country to play and act careless.\n\nAnd, of course, there is the man in the center of it all: Joel Embiid. Whether it be his own ego, organizational malpractice, or (most likely) both, he is the reason this team has no direction today, and he is the reason why it is hard to see the team have a direction in the near future.\n\nDaryl Morey\n\nDaryl Morey has always had a very specific philosophy of team building, dating back to his original trade for James Harden over a decade ago with the Houston Rockets. The greatest collection of talent often does win out in the NBA, but Morey’s hyper-fixation on acquiring superstars has left any roster he has overseen with too many holes to hoist the Larry O’Brien trophy.\n\nThis is not meant to be a referendum on Morey’s efforts. The most success of Joel Embiid’s career came with Morey building the team around him. Morey is not afraid to admit his mistakes on a transactional basis, but at some point, he has to evolve his entire line of thinking instead of throwing the same thing at the wall and hoping it sticks.\n\nPHILADELPHIA, PENNSYLVANIA – DECEMBER 15: President of basketball operations Daryl Morey participates in a press conference before a game between the Philadelphia Flyers and the Washington Capitals at the Wells Fargo Center on December 15, 2023 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. (Photo by Tim Nwachukwu/Getty Images)\n\nMorey has been here long enough to understand that Embiid is not like other superstars in the NBA. He is going to miss more time than anyone else and is a far greater injury risk than most others, as well. What Daryl Morey has done is continue to build the team as if he is on the floor every night, still dominating the league, instead of building out a roster that can stay afloat and even succeed when he is not there. For a team that has Tyrese Maxey and Paul George signed to $200-plus million contracts, that is unacceptable.\n\nNick Nurse\n\nJoel Embiid was at the peak of his basketball powers playing under Nick Nurse until he tore his meniscus last season. Nick Nurse is also, clearly, not the right coach moving forward for the Sixers. Both things can be true.\n\nNick Nurse won a championship as head coach of the Toronto Raptors behind an all-time great playoff run by Kawhi Leonard and going through a Golden State Warriors team that saw both Kevin Durant tear his Achilles tendon and Klay Thompson tear his ACL in the Finals. Kawhi Leonard then left for the Clippers, and the Raptors never found a semblance of that success again.\n\nThat is not all on Nurse, of course. Kawhi had an argument at the time for being the single most effective player in the sport on a game-to-game basis when he played. Kyle Lowry was not getting any younger either (and still is not, as Sixers fans know). The roster was incredibly clunky. However, Nick Nurse showed his hand as a coach during the Raptors’ descent, and it was overlooked for the most part when he came to Philadelphia for those aforementioned reasons.\n\nJan 4, 2025; Brooklyn, New York, USA; Philadelphia 76ers head coach Nick Nurse looks back during the first half against the Brooklyn Nets at Barclays Center. Mandatory Credit: Vincent Carchietta-Imagn Images\n\nNick Nurse needs a dominant offensive force on his roster to make up for his lack of innovation on that end of the floor. When that force leaves like Leonard or rarely suits up like Embiid, he has not shown the ability to adjust- and he has had years to figure something out. Defense is Nurse’s specialty, and even that has not been consistently good enough. His players in Toronto were tuning him out as his tenure was coming to an end, and it sure seems like that is the case here, too.\n\nTyrese Maxey\n\nIt has been a tough year for Tyrese Maxey, even as he has started to pick up his level of play these past couple of months. He was very poor offensively by his standards to start the season. He put on a lot of muscle over the summer to play more physically, and there’s been a lot of speculation that it affected his shooting stroke for a while before his body adjusted. The weight of expectations that come from signing a massive contract extension did not help either.\n\nFeb 11, 2025; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA; Philadelphia 76ers guard Tyrese Maxey (0) controls the ball against the Toronto Raptors in the first quarter at Wells Fargo Center. Mandatory Credit: Kyle Ross-Imagn Images\n\nWith Joel Embiid and Paul George both out when the season started, Maxey was not capable of carrying the team to victories on his own. As the losses piled up, so did his visible, outward frustration. That was something he had never really shown before, and it continued for the first three months of the season. To his credit, he has pulled himself out of the funk he was in, but now we know somewhere in that blinding smile is a man who is not happy with the state of affairs right now.\n\nPaul George\n\nThe larger the sample we see from Paul George, the more obvious his intentions in a Sixers uniform become. It does not matter that he has not gotten nearly as much playing time with Joel Embiid and Tyrese Maxey as he and everyone would like. It does not matter that he has been banged up a few times—including currently with a tendon issue in his finger—because everyone on the team has. What matters are his actions on the court.\n\nFeb 11, 2025; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA; Philadelphia 76ers forward Paul George (8) drives with the ball against the Toronto Raptors in the first quarter at Wells Fargo Center. Mandatory Credit: Kyle Ross-Imagn Images\n\nPaul George made it clear that he wanted to stay and end his career in his home state of California. Still, when he signed with a team as far away from California as possible for as much money as possible, he said all the right things. He had a preexisting friendship with Embiid and quickly looked to develop one with Maxey. It felt like the Sixers finally had the core in place that they wanted.\n\nAs the season has gone on, however, George has become less and less engaged. He has been bad offensively all year- sometimes that happens. But as the Sixers have continued to plummet, so have his efforts everywhere else on the court. It is reasonable to think he did not expect the vibes to be this awful, and he is also 34 years old, but it is becoming increasingly evident that he has no heart in this. Kelly Oubre and Guerschon Yabusele might not make nearly as much money, but they give a damn. Tyrese Maxey also makes significantly less money than George, and he gives a damn too.\n\nJoel Embiid\n\nWhere to even start…\n\nJoel Embiid tore his meniscus in Jan. 2024. He rushed back for the playoffs, but the Sixers were dispatched in the first round while he played physically compromised. He then played in the Olympics and won a Gold Medal. By the time training camp and the start of the NBA season roll around, he is nowhere to be found.\n\nFeb 11, 2025; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA; Philadelphia 76ers center Joel Embiid (21) reacts against the Toronto Raptors in the second quarter at Wells Fargo Center. Mandatory Credit: Kyle Ross-Imagn Images\n\nTo make matters worse, any time someone was asked about his health or his absence, nobody gave a real answer. That trend has continued literally to this day. Joel Embiid has played a total of 17 games this season. The Sixers are 8-9 in those games. Last year, in Embiid’s 39 games played, the Sixers were 31-8. Tyrese Maxey called him out in a closed-door meeting that someone decided needed to be open-door.\n\nThen Lisa Salters of ESPN reported that Embiid himself stated that he would “likely require” another surgery and an extended recovery time after the season.\n\nIf that is the case, why is Embiid playing at all? It is completely nonsensical that a player who needs knee surgery announces the need while the team does not mention the idea once and for the player to be currently suited up in an NBA basketball game the moment the public is told of this.\n\nThis is truly infuriating stuff that does not happen to any normal franchise in the NBA. These persisting issues are as much, if not more, on Joel than on the Sixers organization. Shut it all down. Destination nowhere.",

        "fullContent": "Sign up for our Daily Email newsletter to stay up-to-date on the latest local news throughout Philadelphia.\n\nAhead of the band’s upcoming performance at the Keswick Theater, Travis frontman Fran Healy sat down with Metro to discuss the band’s most recent album, ‘L.A. Times’, their creative process as innovators, and the experience of live music.\n\nYour latest album, ‘L.A. Times’ — can you break down its inspiration?\n\nIt was me venting about LA and having lived there for eight years. And just like I was like, ‘That’s enough, [I] can’t take any more.’ The whole album was written while I lived in LA, and song-wise, I would say there’s a bit of everything. There’s a lot of reflection and a lot of looking back. But, honestly, [when] writing songs, your entire experience kind of comes out in a song. If you’re writing in a proper way, which is just like digging until you find something, you bring it to the surface, and it starts to become something.\n\nThe first song is me looking back to Glasgow, waiting on a bus, and then this metaphor of a bus being like life, your kind of mortality. It’s a bit deep, but I’m thinking about it. I’m 51, I’m a father. So I’m thinking about stuff like that. Song two is called ‘Raze The Bar,’ which is about this brilliant bar in New York. It’s got nothing to do with LA, but I think living in LA has made me really long for everything outside of LA. So I’m thinking about New York and the third song, it’s a breakup song, looking at my relationship with my ex, looking at my relationship with my son.\n\nAnd then the fourth song is ‘Gaslight,’ which is just a song about being gaslit for quite a while and getting emancipation, that sort of thing, fighting back against those a–holes. I think there’s been a lot of the tectonic movement in my life, emotional plates moving big, big, big things happening, people dying, people leaving, weeding the garden, so to speak, and then coming out the other side of it and this record sort of chronicles all of that sort of movement.\n\nYou’ve said that for you, the process is not to write songs for charts but to write based on life. Can you delve into that a bit?\n\nEvery song [I’ve ever written] is about something. There’s about 5% of our business that, I would say, innovates. And I think a lot of music, that 95% of music in the charts, is that other type of music. When Travis got massive, like no one even knew we existed, and then suddenly, the next year, we were so different than everything else that everything else had to change to fit in with us. So you find all these bands suddenly sounding like you. We were part of the 5% that just does its thing and, just by chance, became popular, and then the whole business then goes, Oh, we gotta sound like this because this is popular.\n\nSo they all follow; it’s like the flock follows whatever it is. And so I’ve never stopped writing like that. So when we’re suddenly very popular, then suddenly The Strokes come along, I’m not going to suddenly sound like The Strokes just to be popular. That just so goes against the grain of what I’m about. We’re not that kind of band. But again, bands that I love are bands like us that are the 5% bands that just cut their own; they cut their own [teeth]. And I think it’s maybe a little bit more interesting than someone who or a writer who is constantly just trying to stay in fashion…\n\nAuthenticity is one big thing for us. Just be who you are, no matter what that is. Two, art because we all went to art school. We’re an art school band. And three mischief. I’m not so cheeky in real life. I can be, but I’m much more so on the stage… And so we decided that everything we put out has to have those three things in it. And there’s a fourth thing, which is storytelling. It’s a big part of what we do. And the live shows really encapsulated all of those elements together.\n\nThis seems to parallel a lyric by My Morning Jacket from the song ‘Wordless Chorus,’ which says “We are the innovators, they are the imitators. ” Does it seem to be that same type of idea?\n\nThat’s the perfect comparison, yeah, Jim [James] is amazing.\n\nWhat can fans coming to see Travis expect, and why should they be excited?\n\nLet’s talk about My Morning Jacket for a second and not talk about Travis as an example. You listen to ‘Z’ (the album that features ‘Wordless Chorus’), if you listen to it, and that’s the band in a studio playing as much live, hopefully as possible, and then you turn it up on your stereo, and to get the heavy guitars louder, to get the experience that’s like 1% of of the band you’re getting.\n\nIn order to completely get that band, you have to go and see them live. You have to go and stand at the feet of Jim James and hear his roar, watch the guitar, just see the way the guitarist runs across the stage. And that’s where music really resides. I mean, it really is. Seeing a band live is, that’s it. You get the whole DNA of everything and albums, not to knock albums, because albums are art pieces in themselves, but if you really want to get into a band or understand the band.\n\n[Travis is] very artistic. We’re very silly up front, not silly, but entertaining on stage and we’re serious as well. And have quite a lot to say. But it’s cool, it’s just real. And it’s, there’s no backing tracks or anything, and it’s like four guys just f–king hitting their s–t out their instruments and making something out of it.\n\nCatch ‘Travis’ at the Keswick Theater on Tuesday, Feb. 18, for more information, visit keswicktheatre.com",

They had the number-one defense in the league and the number-one rushing attack, thanks to Saquon Barkley. While Saquon Barkley was the final piece to the puzzle for the Eagles offense, the picture that the puzzle made has yet to truly be admired.\n\nYes, you have a stout defense taking up one side with photos of Jalen Carter, Zack Baun, Brandon Graham, Darius Slay, and others but at the very center of the photo is one player who has been often overlooked this year. The franchise QB, the leader, the glue that held it all together since 2022, Jalen Hurts.\n\nBut who is Jalen Hurts? Why do the National Media and even local media continue to struggle with giving him his credit?\n\nFeb 9, 2025; New Orleans, LA, USA; Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Jalen Hurts (1) celebrates after winning against Kansas City Chiefs in Super Bowl LIX at Caesars Superdome. Mandatory Credit: Geoff Burke-Imagn Images\n\nIn an era where stats reign supreme and wins are second nature, Jalen Hurts finds himself to be the outcast, the sore thumb, the stepchild to a generation of football where analytics reign supreme. He isn’t your modern-day football version of LeBron James, that just isn’t him. There’s no ego in Jalen’s approach to the game which makes him “unlikable” in the eyes of the media and fans alike.\n\nHe’s not chasing the ultimate records for quarterbacks, that’s not what he’s after. He doesn’t care about the spotlight, instead, he would rather just continue to work until you have no choice but to acknowledge him. To Hurts, the main thing has always been the main thing and that’s winning. In five years as the Eagles’ starting quarterback, Jalen Hurts has a record of 46-20.\n\nHe started only four games in his rookie season as he pushed Carson Wentz out of the role and ultimately out of Philadelphia. That year he went 1-3 and the team missed the playoffs which led to the firing of Doug Pederson and the introduction of Nick Sirianni.\n\nSince playing under Nick Sirianni, Hurts has made the playoffs in each of the last four seasons with winning records. The Eagles have won two NFC East division titles, two NFC Championships, and now, one Super Bowl. That’s all Hurts does. He’s a winner. He was bred to win and to the disappointment of all his critics, that’s all he cares about.\n\nFeb 9, 2025; New Orleans, LA, USA; Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Jalen Hurts (1) drops back to pass against the Kansas City Chiefs during the second quarter in Super Bowl LIX at Caesars Superdome. Mandatory Credit: Kirby Lee-Imagn Images\n\nHe’s an intelligent player who operates at the line of scrimmage similarly to Tom Brady and Peyton Manning once did. He puts his weapons in a position to succeed every time. From a 60-yard touchdown run by Saquon Barkley to a 46-yard touchdown pass to DeVonta Smith, Jalen Hurts operates in a way that many other quarterbacks can’t.\n\nBut unless you dive into the film and dissect his every move at the line of scrimmage, you won’t see the engineering he does on every drive. You probably can’t see it because you’re looking for the wrong thing. Which is fine but it also means that people need to take a step back and come back to his film with an open mind and fresh eyes.\n\nThe big question around the league is where Jalen Hurts ranks among the great young QBs of the game today. While I will agree with many that Patrick Mahomes is in a class of his own, I will disagree with even more folks on the fact that Jalen Hurts is a top-5 quarterback in the NFL. Yes, I said it and I will go a step further and tell you that he is an elite QB as well.\n\nWhat separates other QBs from Jalen Hurts? Is it Lamar Jackson’s flashy elusiveness in the middle of the field? Josh Allen’s rocket launcher of an arm? Joe Burrow’s accuracy? Or are the over-inflated stats that each of these quarterbacks put up week in and week out as their teams struggle to make it to the ultimate stage that Jalen Hurts has been to twice?\n\nHe doesn’t put up the sexy numbers that you want to see every week but that doesn’t mean that he can’t. But what he does do is put his team in a position to win. Even against those quarterbacks that I mentioned above. Jalen Hurts is 15-7 against AFC opponents in his career.\n\nHe recently defeated Joe Burrow, Josh Allen, Patrick Mahomes (twice), and Lamar Jackson over the last two seasons. Of that elite group, Jalen Hurts is the only one to outperform and defeat Patrick Mahomes in the Super Bowl. He’s one of two players, Joe Burrow being the other, to defeat Patrick Mahomes in the playoffs.\n\nIn his last four seasons as the unquestioned starter of the Eagles, Jalen Hurts has a record of 45-17 which is a better record than Joe Burrow, Lamar Jackson, and Josh Allen have during the same period. In comparison to those three quarterbacks, he has the second most passing yards in the last four seasons, the most rushing touchdowns, the third most passing touchdowns, and is tied for the second-highest completion percentage.\n\nJan 19, 2025; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA; Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Jalen Hurts (1) runs with the ball to score a touchdown against the Los Angeles Rams during the first half in a 2025 NFC divisional round game at Lincoln Financial Field. Mandatory Credit: Bill Streicher-Imagn Images\n\nSo what is the question when it comes to Jalen Hurts? The answers are all in the stats, they’re on the field and now, they’re in the record books for all eternity. You may be able to throw dirt on his name but you have to acknowledge the fact that he’s the Super Bowl MVP of the Super Bowl LIX champions. The same team that dismantled the darling sweethearts of the NFL.\n\nHe may not be the LeBron James of his era, but he mirrors several other greats that did what LeBron has struggled to consistently do and that’s win. Michael Jordan won. Derek Jeter won. Kobe Bryant won. Tom Brady won. Jalen Hurts wins.\n\nREUTERS/Mike Segar TPX IMAGES OF THE DAY",

        "fullContent": "A missing poster is displayed on a telephone pole along a closed section of Kensington Avenue as police begin clearing a homeless encampment on May 8, 2024 in Philadelphia.\n\nSign up for our Daily Email newsletter to stay up-to-date on the latest local news throughout Philadelphia.\n\nAfter nearly a decade of almost year-over-year increases in overdose deaths, the tide may finally be turning in Philadelphia.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced in May 2024 an estimated 3% decrease in overdose deaths in the U.S. in 2023 compared with 2022. Shortly after, data from the Philadelphia Department of Public Health showed a similar trend: Fatal overdoses across the city decreased 7% in 2023, from 1,207 to 1,122. The city is expected to release its 2024 data in the spring of 2025.\n\nWhile these declines are notable, the city’s 2023 fatal overdose numbers are three times higher than they were in 2013.\n\nStill, if 2024 numbers confirm the downward trend, it allows a little hope into an otherwise bleak epidemic that is killing more Philadelphians than homicides, car accidents and diabetes combined.\n\nSomething may finally be working. But what?\n\nIf over a decade spent treating and researching substance use disorders has taught me anything, it’s that the overdose epidemic is what researchers and policymakers refer to as a wicked problem. Wicked problems are constantly changing, complex, interconnected knots of other problems with no clear solution.\n\nBut let’s look at what we do know about how overdose deaths in Philadelphia spiked in the first place – and why they may finally be decreasing.\n\nWhy overdose deaths spiked\n\nThe first wave of the overdose epidemic began in the late 1990s and is attributed to overprescription of opioid pain medicines. But the largest acceleration in deaths didn’t occur until after the government and health insurers implemented prescribing controls in the early 2010s. These controls led many people who were no longer able to get prescribed opioids to turn to illicit heroin.\n\nIn a phenomenon known as the “iron law of prohibition,” stricter drug law enforcement led drug-trafficking organizations to shift from heroin toward more powerful synthetic opioids that are easier to produce, conceal and distribute. Gram for gram, pure fentanyl is over 50 times stronger than pure heroin.\n\nBut street-obtained fentanyl has proven to be anything but pure.\n\nLocal drug-testing efforts found as much as a fiftyfold difference in potency between bags of fentanyl that appear identical.\n\nThis unpredictable potency is considered to be the chief contributor to the deadliness of street fentanyl. It’s like cracking a beer and not knowing whether drinking it will get you mildly buzzed or send you to the graveyard.\n\nResearch suggests drug busts, though touted as improving public safety, can lead to more inconsistency and unpredictability in the potency of illicit opioids. An analysis of 14 studies conducted in the U.S. demonstrated a marked increase in fatal overdoses following the supply disruptions that result from drug seizures.\n\nThere’s also some evidence that the heightened economic insecurity and despair caused by the COVID-19 pandemic may have intensified the fatal overdose epidemic.\n\nPotential reasons for decline\n\nJust as economic insecurity was associated with rising deaths, the subsequent economic recovery as the U.S. emerged from the pandemic may have contributed to the 2023 drop in overdose fatalities nationwide.\n\nHowever, the unequal distribution of that recovery seems to track with worsening racial disparities in overdose rates in the late 2010s to early 2020s.\n\nAnother possible explanation for the reduction in overdose deaths is the increasing availability of buprenorphine.\n\nBuprenorphine, an FDA-approved medication for opioid use disorder, reduces withdrawal and cravings for fentanyl. What’s more, it decreases overdose risk by more than 50%.\n\nHowever, efforts to increase access to this medication have stagnated. National prescribing rates for buprenorphine were relatively stable from 2019 to 2023, and the CDC estimates that only a quarter of those who need treatment are getting it. Efforts to make buprenorphine available without a prescription have not yet gained traction.\n\nAccess to and education around naloxone, a lifesaving drug used to reverse opioid overdoses, has also increased, and the drug is increasingly being administered by bystanders. Over 1.3 million doses were distributed in Pennsylvania since 2017. National research suggests these distribution efforts, often spearheaded by local harm-reduction organizations, have led to quicker administration of naloxone. This saves lives while also decreasing reliance on emergency medical services.\n\nFinally, the consequences of a seemingly minor characteristic of fentanyl’s pharmacology might also be reducing the overdose death rate in Philadelphia.\n\nFentanyl’s effects last only a third as long as heroin. This shorter duration led drug traffickers to add the animal tranquilizer xylazine – also called “tranq” – and the veterinary anesthetic medetomidine into Philadelphia’s street drug supply. In 2019, two-thirds of heroin or fentanyl sampled in Philadelphia had xylazine in it. By 2021 all of it did.\n\nThese additives lengthen the duration of the effect, mitigate withdrawal symptoms and possibly reduce the amount of fentanyl needed per dose. Some evidence from animal studies shows that xylazine reduces fentanyl intake by suppressing fentanyl withdrawal, thereby lengthening the time before a person uses again.\n\nWhat’s more, the skin wounds and sedative effects that are associated with xylazine may be motivating some people to avoid using street fentanyl.\n\nWhat’s next for Philadelphia\n\nThe opioid settlement, a multibillion-dollar payment from the pharmaceutical industry to resolve legal actions against them, has led to increased funding in Philadelphia for naloxone and medications such as buprenorphine to treat opioid use disorder.\n\nHowever, in the past year the city eliminated funding for needle exchanges and implemented compulsory treatment strategies, which research suggests often do not reduce drug use or criminal recidividism.\n\nMeanwhile, at the federal level, Republican members of Congress have proposed cuts to Medicaid, the health insurance program for low-income Americans.\n\nWhether new data, when it’s released, will show overdose deaths in Philly have continued to decline or are back on the rise is anybody’s guess. But I do know that harm-reduction advocates, medical providers and communities of people who use drugs will continue to fight this epidemic as if their lives depend on it. For many, it does.\n\nBen Cocchiaro is an Assistant Clinical Professor of Family Medicine and Community Health at Drexel University.",

        "source": "https://metrophiladelphia.com/",
        "fullContent": "President Donald Trump listens to Robert F. Kennedy Jr. in the Oval Office of the White House, on the day Kennedy is sworn in as secretary of Health and Human Service in Washington, D.C., U.S., February 13, 2025.\n\nSign up for our Daily Email newsletter to stay up-to-date on the latest local news throughout Philadelphia.\n\nRobert F. Kennedy Jr. has been confirmed as the secretary of the US Health and Human Services Department. Put simply, this makes him the most influential figure in overseeing the health and wellbeing of more than 330 million Americans.\n\nAs health secretary, Kennedy will be involved in overseeing federal health agencies that regulate medical research, disease prevention, drug approvals and health-care programs.\n\nThis includes oversight of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the Food and Drug Administration and the National Institutes of Health, which are among the most crucial public health agencies in the country.\n\nReports suggest he’ll oversee a budget in the order of $1.8 trillion annually.\n\nIn the era of Trump 2.0, there’s little that shocks me anymore. But Kennedy would have to be the most unqualified person ever to hold this crucial role of protecting the health of the American people.\n\nA history of discounting science\n\nThe absolute minimum requirement for someone occupying such as role should be an understanding of science and respect for scientific evidence and expertise. Yet, Kennedy fails spectacularly in this regard.\n\nHere are just some of the false claims he has made over the years:\n\nKennedy has suggested Lyme disease is likely to be an engineered bioweapon\n\nHe reportedly said 99% of COVID deaths occurred in people with vitamin D deficiencies\n\nHe has questioned the role of HIV in causing AIDS.\n\nNone of these positions has even the smallest amount of scientific support.\n\nIt’s hard to predict what Kennedy will do as health secretary, especially given his confirmation hearings looked to be an exercise in being vague, evasive and denying or downplaying his prior controversial statements to secure support.\n\nBut there are three areas where his views are fairly clear and his appointment could be expected to have a significant impact. These are water fluoridation, infectious diseases research and vaccines.\n\nFluoridation of water\n\nKennedy has been a long-term opponent of water fluoridation, despite its proven benefits in preventing tooth decay. He has consistently questioned its safety and claimed it’s linked to a range of illnesses such as arthritis, bone cancer, IQ loss and neurodevelopmental disorders.\n\nWhile a recent review suggested a link between water fluoridation and lower IQ in children, the levels of fluoride in the water in countries included in this review were generally several times higher than the levels in public water fluoridation programs in countries such as the US and Australia. There were also other limitations that make interpreting these findings challenging.\n\nThe CDC has identified community water fluoridation as as one of the ten great public health achievements of the 20th century. And it continues to benefit dental health today, without any convincing evidence of possible harms.\n\nNonetheless, it seems likely that in keeping with his longstanding views one of Kennedy’s first priorities will be to try to halt water fluoridation in the US.\n\nInfectious diseases\n\nAlongside his confirmation as health secretary, US President Donald Trump signed an executive order establishing “The President’s Commission to Make America Healthy Again”, with Kennedy as the chair.\n\nThe Make America Healthy Again movement (MAHA) is an initiative driven by Kennedy focusing on improving nutrition, increasing transparency in medical practices and reducing the corporate influence in health.\n\nThough premised primarily on combating chronic diseases, the movement also embraces skepticism of established medical practices, unproven alternative therapies and a general mistrust of institutions.\n\nWhat’s more, Kennedy’s focus on chronic diseases seems to be coming at the expense of continued work on infectious diseases.\n\nHe has proposed directing the National Institutes of Health to pause infectious disease research for eight years to prioritize research into chronic diseases and alternative treatments.\n\nAs health secretary, Kennedy has the power to shift research priorities. If he were to effectively halt infectious diseases research – in the wake of COVID and with a looming threat of future pandemics – this would be catastrophic for the US and global health.\n\nVaccine scepticism\n\nRelated to infectious diseases, there’s little doubt the area in which Kennedy has done the most damage relates to vaccines.\n\nHe has dedicated a large part of his life to undermining public confidence in vaccines. This is despite overwhelming scientific evidence demonstrating their safety and effectiveness, and the millions of lives they’ve saved.\n\nAlthough he has subsequently denied it, Kennedy is on record as falsely stating there is no such thing as a safe and effective vaccine. Notably, he has continued to push the debunked claim that the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine is linked to autism, despite the single study finding this having been widely discredited.\n\nKennedy’s frequent assertion that he’s not anti-vaccine, but “pro-safety”, is also deeply disingenuous. Being “pro-safety” is a deliberately vague notion designed to appear reasonable while at the same time undermining the scientific evidence.\n\nThe impact of Kennedy’s appointment as health secretary on vaccine confidence will not just be limited to the US. Vaccine hesitancy has been recognized as one of the greatest threats to public health. Having a vaccine sceptic leading the US health agencies has the potential to harm vaccine uptake worldwide.\n\nAs we’ve seen during the COVID pandemic, producing a vaccine is only half the battle. Convincing people to take it is just as important. There’s no doubt Kennedy’s influence on public health messaging could further erode vaccine confidence at a time when vaccine messaging must be clear.\n\nBad news for the US and the world\n\nOne of the reasons Kennedy poses such a threat to public health in the US and globally is his lack of trust in science. He believes a narrative can be crafted by picking and choosing any study that fits with his world view, regardless of its quality.\n\nIn addition, he personifies the bad-faith tactics of conspiracy theorists globally, “selling” the flawed premise that any assertion is valid until others prove it false.\n\nWhat the world needs now is a safe pair of hands leading public health in the US. Someone who is guided by evidence – not someone who promotes anti-science propaganda and conspiracy theories.\n\nHassan Vally is an Associate Professor of Epidemiology at Deakin University.",

        "fullContent": "Sign up for our email newsletter to stay up-to-date on the latest local sports news throughout Philadelphia.\n\nPitchers and catchers have all made their way down to beautiful Clearwooder for their spring training preparation. We are that much closer to baseball season, meaning we’re so close to hearing “BEER, BEER, BEER, BEER, BEEEEEEER” on our televisions for a month.\n\nThe Phillies were relatively quiet this offseason and lost pitchers Jeff Hoffman (Blue Jays) and Carlos Estévez (Royals) to free agency. Fans have questions about the roster, and we have answers! I teamed up with fellow Philadelphia Sports Network writer Shaun Nestor to answer some of those questions.\n\nWhich Phillies reliever will lead the team in saves at the end of the year?\n\nKylee: I’ll have to go with Orion Kerkering. Before I go into this, I want to make it clear I have a ton of faith in Jordan Romano. I just believe Kerkering will take that big of a leap forward and be the backbone that the Phillies need following Jeff Hoffman’s departure to Toronto.\n\nShaun: This may not be the popular answer, but I think Jordan Romano does the job there. Especially in Rob Thomson’s system of “bullpen by committee,” Romano’s experience will get him the bulk of the action while Jose Alvarado, Orion Kerkering, Matt Strahm, and others get their time in the 9th as well.\n\nPredict a Phillies trade deadline addition\n\nKylee: I think the Phillies will go after a relief pitcher. I don’t think it’ll be a high-end reliever because I believe Romano and Kerkering will take over, but more options in relief can’t possibly do any harm.\n\nShaun: You know, nothing stands out as a huge need to be filled at the trade deadline yet to me. But I’m going to go out on a limb here: a package likely involving one of Miller, Crawford, or Tait to the Brewers for Devin Williams and Rhys Hoskins. Spicy enough for you?\n\nAug 15, 2024; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA; Philadelphia Phillies outfielder Johan Rojas (18) hits an RBI single during the fourth inning against the Washington Nationals at Citizens Bank Park. Mandatory Credit: Bill Streicher-USA TODAY Sports\n\nAre there any position battles in camp?\n\nKylee: The obvious one is centerfield with Brandon Marsh and Johan Rojas, but you could argue the closer role has a position battle. As it stands, Jordan Romano is expected to have the Jeff Hoffman/main closer role, but I wouldn’t be surprised to see Orion Kerkering have a shot at the spot if Romano starts slow.\n\nShaun: If anything, Brandon Marsh and Johan Rojas will battle for the center field job, but I fully expect that to remain at the status quo with a platoon.\n\nWhat prospects not named Andrew Painter can you see getting called up this season?\n\nKylee: I would be very shocked to see Justin Crawford and Aidan Miller up this season. Dave Dombrowski already said he sees Miller as a 2026 at-best guy. With that in mind, I would expect to see Mick Abel up at some point. I don’t think he’ll make it right out of camp, but I see it happening by the trade deadline.\n\nShaun: Technically I expect Mick Abel will make the Phillies bullpen out of camp, but that’s not really what this question is asking. If anything, I would expect Jean Cabrera, Seth Johnson, or Griff McGarry to come up at some point to fill in for an injury here or there, but I wouldn’t get my hopes up for Aidan Miller or Justin Crawford just yet.\n\nMandatory Credit: Jonathan Dyer-Imagn Images",

        "fullContent": "A view of the Stonewall Inn from Christopher Park, which is also the home of the Stonewall National Monument.\n\nSign up for our Gay City News email newsletter to get news, updates, and local insights delivered straight to your inbox!\n\nCommunity members protested at Christopher Park on Feb. 14 after the National Park Service removed references to transgender individuals from its online website, representing just the latest example of the Trump administration’s overwhelming quest to erase transgender individuals from American life.\n\n“Before the 1960s, almost everything about living openly as a lesbian, gay, bisexual (LGB) person was illegal,” the National Park Service’s website says, as of the morning of Feb. 14. “The Stonewall Uprising on June 28, 1969 is a milestone in the quest for LGB civil rights and provided momentum for a movement.”\n\nThe move, which involved deleting TQ+ from LGBTQ+, appeared to align the National Park Service with President Donald Trump’s blatantly transphobic executive order recognizing only male and female genders according to an individual’s gender assigned at birth.\n\nThe Stonewall National Monument is located within Christopher Park and was designated in 2016 by former President Barack Obama as the first federal monument dedicated to the LGBTQ community.\n\nThe updates to the National Park Service’s website immediately prompted widespread anger from community members and elected officials, leading to the Christopher Park demonstration.\n\n“I’m not going to allow any government, any organization, any person to take away the joy that I feel as a trans person,” Berne Wagenblast, who is one of the voices of the New York City subway system. Wagenblast delighted the crowd by repeating one of her most-heard lines: “Please stand away from the platform edge.”\n\nOut gay State Senator Brad Hoylman-Sigal, who represents the area encompassing the Stonewall Inn, said the decision to remove trans references from the website amounts to “one of the darkest moments in American history.”\n\nHoylman-Sigal said the Trump administration is seeking to rewrite history and discriminate against an entire population of Americans.\n\n“This decision cannot stand,” Hoylman-Sigal stated, adding: “I pledge to continue to work harder than ever to further enshrine the rights of transgender New Yorkers in state and city law.”\n\nAnother out gay lawmaker, Councilmember Erik Bottcher, who also represents the area around the Stonewall Inn, similarly blasted the move.\n\n“Trump is trying to erase the very existence of transgender people,” Bottcher wrote on X. “He’s trying to cleave our community apart and divide us. He’s not going to succeed. Lesbians and gays are not going to abandon our transgender siblings. We are one community.”\n\nNew York Gov. Kathy Hochul also criticized the change, describing it as “cruel and petty.”\n\n“Transgender people play a critical role in the fight for LGBTQ+ rights — and New York will never allow their contributions to be erased,” Hochul wrote on X.\n\nSenator Chuck Schumer of New York, the minority leader, said, “This move to try to erase transgender people from the Stonewall National Monument is cruel, pathetic, and historically inaccurate. Transgender New Yorkers played a critical role in the events at Stonewall and in the movement for equality that it inspired. The Park Service should reverse themselves immediately.”\n\nStacy Lentz, a co-owner of the Stonewall Inn, told Gay City News on Feb. 14 that although the move wasn’t necessarily surprising given who occupies the White House, it still hits the community hard.\n\n“It’s painful and it’s unacceptable that they want to erase an entire part of the community,” Lentz said, acknowledging the participation of transgender individuals in the Stonewall Uprising. “To have them come into our house — it’s alarming. This should be alarming to everyone, not just the LGBTQ community.”\n\nAngelica Christina, an out trans board member of the Stonewall Inn Gives Back Initiative, which is the charitable arm of the Stonewall Inn, told Gay City News she is “entirely offended” and “disgusted” by the federal government’s erasure of the trans community.\n\n“What we’re seeing right now is the erasure of LGBTQIA+ history, and American history,” Christina said. “What we’re witnessing right now is an attempted gendercide of trans folks.”\n\nThe Office of Mayor Eric Adams, who has developed close ties with President Trump, offered an indirect answer when asked by Gay City News to comment on the National Park Service’s transphobic move.\n\n“We remain steadfast in our commitment to fostering a safe, inclusive, and affirming environment where every person can thrive,” a spokesperson for Adams told Gay City News. “Here in New York City, our policies have not changed at our schools or at our hospitals and we will continue to provide care for all, regardless of race, gender, religion or sexual orientation.”\n\nMark Segal, a Stonewall veteran who is the founder and publisher of the Philadelphia Gay News, called on community members to remember this moment as the beginning of the second Stonewall Rebellion.\n\n“The spirit of Stonewall means to be visible and fight back against oppression,” Segal said in a written statement. “You cannot erase the history of Stonewall by erasing a letter. You cannot erase trans people by erasing a letter. This petty, vindictive action is an attempt to not only erase trans people from public view, but also the entire LGBT community. Stonewall, including all of us in the LGBT community who fought back that historic night and have continued to fight for 55 years, cannot and will not be erased. We will continue to fight, we will continue to be visible and persevere…”\n\nLentz, who said the federal government had not communicated anything to her, is calling on members of the public to visit the National Park Service’s website and navigate to a page where folks can voice their concerns.\n\nFor now, though, she wants folks to step up and join in.\n\n“I think we’re seeing a lot of complacency, especially a lot of leadership in the Democratic Party,” Lentz said. “Pride started as a protest. We want to make sure our voices are being heard.”\n\nThe National Park Service did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nBelow are some more photos from the Feb. 14 demonstration at Stonewall:",

It didn’t take long for the fun to begin. From police officers running their own iteration of the ‘Tush Push’, to fans cheering busses filled with other random fans, it was certainly a day to remember.\n\nHowie Roseman stole the show before even getting to the stage. The esteemed GM sported a cut at the top of his head after what many assume to be a clash with a beer can. After smoking a cigar in what might go down as one of the coldest pictures of the entire day, Roseman took to the stage outside the Art Museum to tell fans he ‘BLEEDS for this city’, and he meant it quite literally.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/sportscenter/status/1890498731453083708?s=61&t=7BbLnpr1DB45SPN7vMZwFQ\n\nThe Eagles soar down Broad Street\n\nThe players had their fair share of wholesome moments. Zack Baun signed someone’s baby, while Nolan Smith lifted a small child atop his shoulders while walking down and greeting ecstatic fans.\n\nSaquon Barkley found one of the teams’ ball boys in the crowd, lifting him over the barrier and inviting him into the parade with the rest of the team. As soon as you think you can’t love that man any more, he finds yet another new way to make you smile from ear to ear.\n\nDallas Goedert shotgunned a beer in front of the fans, which became a common theme for the day.\n\nQuinyon Mitchell was particularly excitable, screaming ‘GO EAGLES’ into the microphone of a Fox 29 reporter. James Bradberry played a great veteran role in running over to keep things moderately tame, but there was no stopping Landon Dickerson’s passion…\n\nhttps://twitter.com/brendendeeg_/status/1890448027501875316?s=61&t=7BbLnpr1DB45SPN7vMZwFQ\n\nThe dominant lineman would go on to drop the speech of the day, stating how he’s ‘never played an away game in his whole career’, attesting to the passion of the travelling Eagles fans.\n\nFeb 14, 2025; Philadelphia, PA, USA; Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Jalen Hurts holds the Vince Lombardi Trophy during the Super Bowl LIX championship parade and rally.

He gave the World a ‘mic drop’ moment, reminding everyone about the criticisms he’s faced since signing with the team.\n\n‘They said I was a diva. They said all I care about was stats. Well, if you’re gonna say all those things, get one thing right… I’m a f**king champion!’\n\nThe ‘Exciting Whites’ took to the stage with hefty applause and to the backdrop of ‘dreams and nightmares’. I don’t think the Eagles can ever break that tandem up now…\n\nJalen Hurts was the man of the moment and who a lot fans couldn’t wait to hear from. After returning from his Disney World trip and seeing the iconic ‘LOVE’ statue be upgraded with a ‘,Hurts’ feature, the Super Bowl MVP greeted fans warmly before stating how he promised himself he wouldn’t visit the Rocky steps until he won a championship. He can safely tick that one off the bucket list.\n\nThe Super Bowl parade wouldn’t be complete without a little chaos from CJGJ!\n\nhttps://twitter.com/sluggahjells/status/1890493030043398646?s=61&t=7BbLnpr1DB45SPN7vMZwFQ\n\nAnd of course, the iconic Eagles fanbase was out in full force, draping the streets in kelly green and showing their passion for the team in some brilliant ways:\n\nBeating the shit out of Kermit on Broad Street #EaglesParade pic.twitter.com/zjSm9WyOdw — Dalai Loml (@thealexbasso) February 14, 2025\n\nWe also want to send our thoughts to those impacted by the shootings at today’s Super Bowl parade.

Mandatory Credit: Kyle Ross-Imagn Images\n\nSign up for our email newsletter to stay up-to-date on the latest local sports news throughout Philadelphia.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Philadelphia Flyers’ forwards were given player grades as the 4 Nations Face-Off break arrived. Now, it’s time to take a look at how the defensemen and goaltenders have fared, as we are just crossing over the halfway point of the 2024-25 season.\n\nThe Flyers’ defense has been quite stable so far. Travis Sanheim, who is representing Team Canada at the 4 Nations Face-Off, has solidified himself as the Flyers’ No. 1 defenseman. Cam York continues to make positive strides and is preparing himself for a payday this summer, and Rasmus Ristolainen has mightily improved on the defensive side of the puck. Ristolainen did make Team Finland for the 4 Nations Face-Off, but he won’t play due to injury.\n\nLooking at the goaltending, it’s certainly been tough sledding. Samuel Ersson, representing Team Sweden at the 4 Nations Face-Off, has had his ups and downs this year but has provided stability between the pipes since the Christmas break. Ivan Fedotov and Aleksei Kolosov have struggled more than succeeded, but that was to be expected in their first full seasons in North America.\n\nHere are player grades for the Flyers’ defensemen and goaltenders thus far in 2024-25:\n\nFlyers defensemen\n\nTravis Sanheim: A\n\nSanheim has proved he’s the Flyers’ top defenseman and is also proving that his long-term extension signed by former general manager Chuck Fletcher was worth the price.\n\nSanheim ranks first in points by Flyers defensemen with 27 (6G, 21A) and first overall in ice-time, averaging 24:34 per game. He scored 44 points during 2023-24 and is on pace to meet similar numbers this year. On a true contending team, Sanheim would probably be the #2 or #3 defenseman, but on the Flyers, he’s the top guy and has been solid all around this year.\n\nJamie Drysdale: B\n\nJamie Drysdale was going to be one of the main players to watch this season regarding development. He played injured throughout most of his first Flyers season in 2023-24 and underwent surgery in the offseason.\n\nHe started this season a bit slow and suffered an upper-body injury that saw him miss 12 games. But since returning from injury, he’s been one of the team’s best defensemen. He’s showing his offensive capabilities and has thrived since facing his former team, the Anaheim Ducks, on Jan. 11 at the Wells Fargo Center.\n\nDrysdale has the opportunity to play a pivotal role in the Flyers’ future, and he’s starting to put all of the pieces in the right places.\n\nFeb 8, 2025; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA; Philadelphia Flyers defenseman Jamie Drysdale (9) grabs Pittsburgh Penguins left wing Danton Heinen (43) during a shot in the third period at Wells Fargo Center. Mandatory Credit: Kyle Ross-Imagn Images\n\nRasmus Ristolainen: B-\n\nEven if Ristolainen doesn’t return to the offensive producer he was in his junior career and Buffalo, he’s stepped up his defensive game massively since being a member of the Flyers. All credit for his improved defense goes to associate coach Brad Shaw.\n\nRistolainen has 15 points (2G, 13A) in 54 games this year and is on pace to set a career-high in points in his Flyers career. He registered 20 points (3G, 17A) during 2022-23. He’s been placed in every situation over the last few months, ranging from powerplay time to seeing the ice in overtime.\n\nHis name has been brought up in trade rumors as the trade deadline approaches, so we’ll see what his future looks like. If he stays or goes, he’s become a sound defensive player in Philadelphia.\n\nNick Seeler makes a visible difference when he’s in the lineup compared to being out. He has 13 points (3G, 10A) in 52 games played and is one point shy of tying a career high that he set with the Flyers in 2022-23.\n\nHe gives his all every game and is never afraid to step up and defend his teammates physically. Seeler plays a solid and tough defensive game and has revived his career since joining Philadelphia.\n\nJan 2, 2025; Las Vegas, Nevada, USA; Vegas Golden Knights defenseman Nicolas Hague (14) banks a shot off the stick of Philadelphia Flyers defenseman Nick Seeler (24) to score a goal against goaltender Aleksei Kolosov (35) during the second period at T-Mobile Arena. Mandatory Credit: Stephen R. Sylvanie-Imagn Images\n\nCam York: C+\n\nYork is due for a contract extension this summer. His two-year, $3.2 million deal that he signed on July 10, 2023, will expire.\n\nYork ranks second overall in ice-time on the roster, averaging 21:14 per game. He has turned into a player willing to put his body on the line, having blocked 84 shots this year. He does experience some inconsistencies at times, but when his game is on, watch out.\n\nHe was scratched by John Tortorella against the Los Angeles Kings on Dec. 19, showing that nobody is safe from watching a game in the press box on occasion. It will be interesting to see what numbers Daniel Briere presents York in the off-season regarding a new contract.\n\nEmil Andrae has suited up in 24 games this year, scoring six points (1G, 5A). He’s mostly stepped in for injured defensemen, being recalled from the Lehigh Valley Phantoms, and has been one of the better defensemen at times.\n\nYou can make the argument that he’s also outshined York at times. Both players are left-handed defensemen. Andrae appears to have a permanent spot on the Flyers’ blue line in the future, and he’s turned some heads multiple times this season.\n\nErik Johnson: D\n\nErik Johnson mostly steps in when an injury occurs. He signed a one-year extension with the Flyers last summer and will most likely be gone at the end of the season.\n\nHe plays a large mentorship role in the locker room with the younger players. His veteran presence and Stanley Cup-winning mentality doesn’t go unnoticed.\n\nEgor Zamula: D\n\nEgor Zamula has had a rough season. He’s struggled both on offense and defense and is prone to making many mistakes. He has 11 points (3G, 8A) in 39 games.\n\nIt’s unclear what Zamula’s future looks like in Philadelphia, especially with the emergence of Andrae. He was placed on the injured reserve on Jan. 31.\n\nFlyers goalies\n\nSamuel Ersson: B\n\nIn 31 games played, Ersson is 16-10-3. He holds a 2.82 GAA and a .890SV%. He’s easily been the best out of the bunch this year and will be the Flyers’ No. 1 goalie moving forward.\n\nSince returning from the Christmas break, Ersson is 9-4-1 with a 2.26 GAA and a .920SV%. He’s been dominant even in recent losses to the Colorado Avalanche and Utah Hockey Club.\n\nErsson will serve as the third goaltender for Sweden in the 4 Nations Face-Off.\n\nJan 23, 2025; New York, New York, USA; New York Rangers center Filip Chytil (72) (not pictured) scores a goal past Philadelphia Flyers goaltender Samuel Ersson (33) during the third period at Madison Square Garden. Mandatory Credit: Dennis Schneidler-Imagn Images\n\nIvan Fedotov: C-\n\nIn 17 games played, Fedotov is 4-8-1, carrying a 3.26 GAA and .877SV%. It’s been a rocky year for Fedotov, and he has cost the Flyers at times in games. He has made some slick saves but has been underwhelming.\n\nAleksei Kolosov: C-\n\nSimilar to Fedotov, Kolosov was also underwhelming in his stint with the team this year. It’s still his first year playing hockey in North America, like Fedotov, so there are adjustments still being learned.\n\nIn 15 games played, Kolosov is 4-8-1 with a 3.45 GAA and .870SV%. He’s also seen some struggles with the Phantoms, so development is the #1 priority for him.\n\nMandatory Credit: Kyle Ross-Imagn Images",

Philly is ramping up its rebuilding year with a new coach and a host of new and hungry players. Can this Union team compete with the rest of MLS after missing the playoffs for the first time in years last year? If so, it’ll need its attack to be on point.\n\nIf it’s one area that Philadelphia has struggled in in their 16 years worth of existence, it’s been getting consistent attacking play. There have always been great players in their attack, but consistency has been the difference between success and failure. Look at the 2022 season as an example; that team scored 79 goals, which was Philly’s best attacking year statistically. As the club moves into 2025, there is uncertainty about what this attack can produce; there is talent, but will it be enough to make this team a contender?\n\nMandatory Credit: Philadelphia Union\n\nPhiladelphia Union Strikers\n\nOver the last few seasons, we have seen Philly bolster its strikers with its patented type of signings. They have found diamonds in the rough with the potential to ball out. Think Julian Carranza, Mikael Uhre, and Tai Baribo. All three of those players were crucial to Philly’s success. Now, Carranza is gone, and Baribo and Uhre are the big guns. The Union is hoping they don’t show a decline in 2025. Here’s a look at them and the other strikers on the roster.\n\nMarkus Anderson\n\nTai Baribo\n\n*Bruno Damiani*\n\nEddy Davis\n\nChris Donovan\n\nNelson Pierre\n\nMikael Uhre\n\nAside from Mikael Uhre and Tai Baribo, the rest of the striker core features some homegrown (Eddy Davis and Nelson Pierre) and young strikers not ready to take the mantle of starter (Chris Donovan and Markus Anderson.) The only other name on the list is Bruno Damiani. He is not yet a Union player, but the 22-year-old Uruguayan is said to be finalizing a move to Philly; he’d be the club’s record signing with a few of over $3 million for his services. Will his addition help the Union’s attack go from good to great?\n\nMandatory Credit: Philadelphia Union\n\nWhat can this Union attack be?\n\nIf the rumors are true and Damiani comes in as a DP-level striker, then he will join Uhre and Gazdag as Philadelphia’s Designated players. That could be a fierce attack, and when you factor in Baribo’s form last year (and his 16 goals from 26 matches), this Philly attack could be a strength of the team.\n\nYet again, it will come down to the team’s ability to execute. Can they be ruthless in attack using a counter-attacking system, or will it take time for the attack to start firing? We have seen Philly be hot-and-cold to start seasons before. What can they conjure up for 2025? I guess we will have to wait and see when the first ball is kicked on February 22nd!\n\nSep 18, 2024; New York, New York, USA; Philadelphia Union midfielder Daniel Gazdag (10) celebrates after scoring a goal against New York City FC with forward Tai Baribo (28) during the first half at Yankee Stadium.

        "source": "https://metrophiladelphia.com/",
        "fullContent": "Sign up for our email newsletter to stay up-to-date on the latest local sports news throughout Philadelphia.\n\nEagles’ star running back, Saquon Barkley got caught up in the moment. Blame it on the alcohol.\n\nSitting at the post-game podium, with his Super Bowl champions shirt on and hat flipped to the side — along with his two beautiful kids on his lap — daughter, Jada; son, Saquon Jr. — the NFL Offensive Player of the Year contemplated the future of the Eagles’ franchise, specifically saying: “Why not start our dynasty now?”\n\nBarkley uttered it twice, in two different settings. And why not? The Eagles are young. They are motivated. They own the most talented roster in football. They are humble yet hungry. Most importantly, they are the reigning world champions.\n\nBut, speaking dynasties into existence doesn’t necessarily make them true. Winning one Lombardi Trophy is the toughest row to hoe in sports, something that Barkley understands better than anyone and went on record to clear up.\n\n“I said after the game, why can’t our dynasty start now … I probably had a little bit of champagne and some other stuff in my system at the time but you really can’t focus on that,” Barkley said during a press conference at Raising Cane’s in Trevose, PA. “You gotta enjoy the moment, it’s hard to win one … you take it in, you enjoy the moment, and you start over … and it kind of starts over after Friday.”\n\nFriday is the Eagles’ Championship Parade, a joyous jaunt down Broad Street on what is sure to be the greenest Valentine’s Day in city history. A million fans are expected to turn out for the second parade in seven years.\n\n“There’s been a lot of adversity, a lot of ups and downs,” Barkley said, “but it is the perfect timing to do it here, to do it as a part of this city, and with these fans, it’s truly amazing.”\n\nJudging by the crowd at Raising Cane’s — approximately 1,000 people showed up on a random Thursday to cheer on Barkley as he worked the drive-thru line and served up chicken fingers at the counter — it’s going to be a mess. A beautiful, verdurous, unapologetically awesome mess of humanity.\n\nBarkley is ready for it. All of it.\n\n“I don’t know what to expect,” Barkley said. “The Philly fans have been amazing all year round, just the love and support that they have for this team. This city truly buys into this team, you could see it there [as he pointed to the parking lot at Raising Cane’s], look how many people showed up. I’m expecting it to be a blast, a party.”\n\nThe last time the masses hijacked Broad Street, Jason Kelce took center stage in that obnoxious Mummers costume and morphed into Maximus. His speech was the stuff of legend. So, which Eagles player will provide the encore?\n\n“It won’t be me, I can guarantee you that,” Barkley said. “That’s not my thing. If I had to pick one I would say either Lane Johnson or BG [Brandon Graham]. And I think they are the two longest-tenured Eagles right now … so, I think it would just be perfect for one of those two to do that, especially if it is BG. Last game with us and last year, for him to go out with a bang, I think that would be pretty cool.”\n\nDream Starts Over: After the Eagles’ Ring Ceremony\n\nFootball – NFL – Super Bowl LIX – Philadelphia Eagles v Kansas City Chiefs – Caesars Superdome, New Orleans, Louisiana, United States – February 9, 2025 Philadelphia Eagles’ Saquon Barkley celebrates with the Vince Lombardi Trophy after winning Super Bowl LIX REUTERS/Mike Segar\n\nA.J. Brown said the euphoria from winning Super Bowl 59 lasted two days, then it was “back to work.” DeVonta Smith has echoed that sentiment in recent interviews, with Jalen Hurts saying the same thing in private conversations.\n\nSaquon Barkley said he’ll enjoy the championship parade — “shoot for the stars and land on the moon,” is his favorite saying — but then it’s back to the drawing board. The Eagles are starting from scratch. The Super Bowl ring ceremony is the only thing left to celebrate on the offseason calendar.\n\n“Whenever the ring ceremony is, that’s probably the last day we truly celebrate being a Super Bowl champion and then it’s back to work,” Barkley said. “Two nights ago I had a hard time sleeping because I’m thinking about how I’m going to attack the offseason because you kind of get — greedy’s not the word — but addicted to it. You want to find a way how you can hold that Lombardi up again and do it all over again.”\n\n(The Eagles were fitted for their Super Bowl rings later in the day. The ceremony will probably be in June sometime, at least that’s when they did it in 2018).\n\n“So, you take it in, you cherish it,” Barkley continued. “You enjoy it, you appreciate the fans but the dynasty thing … you can’t really get caught up in that, and the way you do that is by putting the work in. There’s a reason why we won, it’s not by accident, so we gotta try and do it all over again next year.”\n\nThere’s that dynasty thing again. It’s not a bad word. It’s not overconfidence or cockiness. It’s just the reality of the thing.\n\n“Dream starts over,” Barkley said.\n\nPartnering Up with Todd Graves at Raising Cane’s\n\nFeb 9, 2025; New Orleans, LA, USA; Philadelphia Eagles wide receiver DeVonta Smith (6) celebrates with running back Saquon Barkley (26) after scoring a touchdown against the Kansas City Chiefs during the second half of Super Bowl LIX at Caesars Superdome. Mandatory Credit: Geoff Burke-Imagn Images\n\nBarkley’s appearance at Raising Cane’s in Trevose, PA on Thursday (February 13) wasn’t by accident. The superstar running back struck up a friendship with owner Todd Graves at a Formula One racing event in Miami earlier this year. Then, Graves traveled to the Super Bowl in New Orleans to cheer on Barkley and the Eagles from a suite.\n\n“It was amazing watching Saquon, Jalen and the team win the Super Bowl on Sunday night,” Graves said. “It was a great game and seeing Saquon hold the Lombardi Trophy and be named Offensive Player of the Year all within his first season with Philly was great.”\n\nThat bond turned into a partnership. Barkley didn’t just show up to Raising Cane’s for a quick photo opportunity. No, the 28-year-old took orders at the counter and handed out chicken fingers at the drive-thru. He also participated in a lengthy commercial shoot for the fast-food chain, delivering scripted lines like: “You know the secret to winning rings? Good fingers. Like Raising Cane’s chicken fingers. Tastes like victory!”\n\nBarkley also poured out samples of a new green lemonade that Raising Cane’s concocted to honor the Eagles’ Super Bowl win. The refreshing drink is a limited-time offering at area restaurants.\n\n“I loved working the drive-thru with Todd,” said Barkley. “The first time I came to Cane’s was in Charlotte with my teammates. My favorite thing to eat is the Box Combo – you can never go wrong with chicken fingers and fries.”\n\nREUTERS/Mike Segar",

Spring training is just that: the beginning. Everything we love about baseball starts as soon as pitchers and catchers report.\n\nSo in 2025, what stories should we be watching as the spring unfolds in central Florida?\n\nPhillies Injury Report\n\nWhen players return from injury, there’s only one thing on everyone’s mind. Will they come back to the top of their game? The Phillies have a handful of players reportedly on the mend, looking for a rebound.\n\nMost of their offseason acquisitions fit into this category. New left fielder Max Kepler reportedly had a core injury that hampered his 2024 campaign. Potential closer Jordan Romano had arthroscopic surgery on his right elbow last summer. Presumed 5th starter Jesús Luzardo started just 12 games in 2024, dealing with a back injury.\n\nAll of them will be under close observation as February leaks into March.\n\nOn top of the new additions, Bryson Stott will also be under inspection. The young second baseman reportedly dealt with an elbow injury for most of 2024. Whether the injury affected him or not, Stott saw a .035 dip in his batting average from 2023 to 2024. It’ll be a pivotal year for Stott’s career.\n\nOct 6, 2024; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA; Philadelphia Phillies second base Bryson Stott (5) hits a triple in the eighth inning against the New York Mets during game two of the NLDS for the 2024 MLB Playoffs at Citizens Bank Park.

We’re now in the middle of February, and the Phillies’ 3rd baseman is still here.\n\nAwkward.\n\nEveryone wants to hear Bohm’s side of the story. Will he follow the path of the disgruntled Scott Rolen, or will he continue like nothing happened? The public cannot wait to hear from the 2024 All-Star with amazing hair.\n\nA Japanese Import?\n\nOne of the most under-the-radar Phillies moves of the offseason has to be the minor league deal struck with veteran Japanese pitcher Koyo Aoyagi. The deal had some history to it as Aoyagi became the first major player the Phillies have signed directly from Japan.\n\nAoyagi, a 31-year-old with sidearm action, was fairly accomplished in Japan. He had an even 3 ERA pitching in Japan with a 3 ERA in 2024. Koyo is currently dealing with Visa issues as he tries to get to Clearwater to start camp. The expectation is that he will arrive by the end of the week if all documentation issues are resolved.\n\nWhile he isn’t expected to be a major contributor for the Phillies, if Koyo finds success, it could lead to more doors opening in the Land of the Rising Sun.\n\nMandatory Credit: Gregory Fisher-Imagn Images",

As a release notes, the evening will be a collaboration of Gullah Geechee cuisine infused with Ember & Ash’s live-fire cooking techniques, including ingredients grown at Gilliard Farms—the 50-acre homestead was purchased by Matthew’s great-great-great-grandfather and freed slave Jupiter Gilliard in 1874 for $9.\n\nWhile there, diners will be able to indulge in dishes like shrimp toast with saffron coconut rice and pickled okra; head hash terrine with fennel and citrus; smoked grouper with middlin risotto and hoja santa; sweet potato olive oil cake; and more. Seating times are 5, 6 and 7 p.m., and the dinner comes out to be $95 per person (plus tax and gratuity). Reservations are available now via Resy.\n\n“We’ve wanted to do a collaboration with longtime friends Scott and Lulu Calhoun of Ember & Ash for a while, as my ties to Philly run deep,” explained Tia in a statement. Both Scott and Tia worked with chef Marc Vetri at Lo Spiedo, and Tia was the culinary director for his nonprofit, Vetri Community Partnership from 2012 to 2014.\n\nThe Raifords, who were Culinary Institute of America grads, decided to switch gears to take their culinary skills to their historic farm in rural Georgia with a mission in mind: To “engage the world with African American foodways, revive the holistic practices of their ancestors, and help to feed their diverse community high-quality, locally-grown organic produce that are sustainably farmed.”\n\nAs a release notes, the couple believes in cultivating the land and pioneering a return to the regenerative practices of their forefathers — the Freshwater Gullah Geechee, who were direct descendants of West Africans brought to the U.S. as slaves for their expertise in rice and indigo cultivation.\n\nThis Black History Month celebration will continue with the Bookers event on the 26. Titled “A Great Migration Dinner,” Matthew will be using his skills as a historian and climate change activist to lead guests through a multi-course dinner and discussion recounting the history of the movement to the urban North by six million southern Blacks between 1910 and 1970. The James Beard semi-finalist and author of ‘Bress ‘n’ Nyam’ will also delve into how they brought their rich culinary traditions to a new life in the Northeast, Midwest, and West.\n\nHighlighted dishes span a pickled vegetable plate with Jamaican-style spinach patties, De Wata (salmon croquettes with red rice and herb salad),Win’ – Poulet Yassa (Senegalese style lemon pepper chicken with vegan teff stew), sweet potato pone with toasted walnut semifreddo and more. There will also be two De Spirits (complimentary cocktails) — a Gullah Geechie Gin Rickey or an alcohol-free hibiscus and lime spritzer.\n\n“Many African Americans’ roots can be traced to the Great Migration, including our own families,” said Cheri and Tracey Syphax from Booker’s restaurant in a statement. “We thought it would be a no-brainer to have Matthew join us for this special event, especially during Black History Month, given the fact that the namesake of our restaurant Booker Wright, is a famous waiter who worked in a whites-only restaurant in the 1960s Mississippi while also running his restaurant that catered to black customers.”\n\nThe dinner starts at 6 p.m. and costs $75 per person (plus tax and gratuity).\n\nTo find out more information on “From Georgia with Love”, visit emberandashphilly.com and bookersrestaurantandbar.com",

        "fullContent": "Sign up for our email newsletter to stay up-to-date on the latest local sports news throughout Philadelphia.\n\nThe Philadelphia 76ers are set to convert recently acquired guard Jared Butler to a standard NBA contract, according to ESPN’s Shams Charania. The former second-round pick started this season on a two-way deal with the Washington Wizards before being traded to the Sixers, along with four second-round picks, in exchange for Reggie Jackson and an extremely unfavorable 2026 first-round pick.\n\nSince joining the Sixers, Butler has averaged 10.0 points and 4.7 assists a night, quickly establishing himself as another piece of the Sixers’ potential young core. Given Jared McCain‘s season-ending injury and the new knee injury that kept star guard Tyrese Maxey from playing against the Brooklyn Nets, converting Butler to a standard deal will provide some more stability in head coach Nick Nurse’s guard rotation.\n\nFeb 9, 2025; Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA; Philadelphia 76ers guard Jared Butler (12) drives for the basket against Milwaukee Bucks forward Bobby Portis (9) during the second quarter at Fiserv Forum. Mandatory Credit: Jeff Hanisch-Imagn Images\n\nButler has spent time with the Utah Jazz, the Oklahoma City Thunder, and the aforementioned Washington Wizards before finally landing this contract with the Sixers. The former Baylor guard got his start in the NBA after being selected at pick 40 in the 2021 NBA draft but has not been able to find a steady place to call home.\n\nThe search for that home may be over as the Sixers’s dismal season and proven track record at developing young, overlooked players provide the most stable breeding ground for Butler’s success. The Sixers will need to clear a roster spot before officially converting Butler. Given that both Chuma Okeke and David Roddy are on 10-day deals, it’s likely the Sixers will simply allow one or both to return to free agency after their ten days are up.\n\nButler’s future with the Sixers\n\nThis deal does not necessarily impact the Sixers’s offseason hopes of retaining Kelly Oubre Jr., Guerschon Yabusele, and Quenton Grimes. While Butler’s deal is not just a one-year contract, the second year is a team option that gives the Sixers flexibility come the offseason. This means that the Sixers’s plan of retaining Yabusele and the others is still very much alive and just as possible as it was before the very deserving contract was handed out.\n\nFeb 9, 2025; Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA; Philadelphia 76ers guard Jared Butler (12) passes the ball around dMilwaukee Bucks guard Gary Trent Jr. (5) during the fourth quarter at Fiserv Forum. Mandatory Credit: Jeff Hanisch-Imagn Images\n\nPhiladelphia may still look to keep Butler in the long term. Should the 24-year-old guard continue to show his outstanding playmaking skills and lay claim to the backup point guard role once everyone is healthy, the Sixers could pick up his team option and secure his services for another year or decline it in search of a longer team-friendly deal. If Butler fails to stick in the rotation as players become healthy, the Sixers can decline the second year and send him into free agency with no effect on their cap sheet.\n\nWhile Butler isn’t a generational player by any means, he has shown that he has the skills to make a difference. When he was with the Wizards, Butler scored a career-high 26 points against Philadelphia just last month. If anyone has the right situation to help Butler become a consistent contributor in this league, it’s the Sixers.\n\nPhiladelphia has been one of the best in the NBA when it comes to developing young, overlooked players these past two years, with both Ricky Council IV and Justin Edwards proving that they belong. With Butler’s playmaking and ball-handling skills being desperate needs for the Sixers, he could soon join the list as another piece of a sneaky young core in Philadelphia.",

        "source": "https://metrophiladelphia.com/",
        "fullContent": "Sign up for our Daily Email newsletter to stay up-to-date on the latest local news throughout Philadelphia.\n\nAfter earning a 2022 Oscar for Best Documentary Film with his directorial debut, ‘Summer of Soul (…Or, When the Revolution Could Not Be Televised)’, Philadelphia native Ahmir “Questlove” Thompson—co-founder of The Roots and drummer for The Tonight Show band—was undoubtedly ready for an encore.\n\nInstead of one encore, Questlove gave us two.\n\nFirst is the freshly-released film, the NBC documentary ‘Ladies & Gentlemen… 50 Years of SNL Music‘, to coincide with the 50th anniversary celebration of ‘Saturday Night Live‘, and secondly, this week’s ‘Sly Lives! (aka the Burden of Black Genius),’ is a study of Sly & Family Stone and Black music innovators such as Andre 3000 and D’Angelo.\n\nQuestlove’s ‘Ladies & Gentlemen… 50 Years of SNL Music’ doc features footage of the program’s storied live performances, from the Rolling Stones, David Bowie, Run DMC and more, and can currently be streamed on Peacock. ‘Sly Lives!’ is available for streaming on Hulu.\n\n“When we did ‘Summer of Soul‘, Ahmir and I came from the same starting point — we both knew and loved most of its artists,” says Questlove’s filmmaking partner, Oscar-winning producer Joseph Patel, talking about that 2021 documentary’s list of stars such as Stevie Wonder, Nina Simone, Gladys Knight & the Pips and more.\n\n“With ‘Sly Lives!’, it was Quest who held great importance for Sly Stone,” notes Patel. “That was one of Ahmir’s longtime favorites and one of his most influential artists.”\n\nSly Stone (born Stewart) is a San Francisco psychedelic-era radio DJ turned composer, singer, and musician who revolutionized music with Sly & the Family Stone — a multi-racial, genre-blending band that shattered boundaries between Black and White audiences. With soul-rock-funk-pop crossover hits like ‘Stand!’, ‘Everyday People’, ‘Hot Fun in the Summertime’, and ‘Thank You’, the group left an indelible mark on music history. The latter track, in particular, became a widely sampled staple of 1980s and ‘90s hip-hop, as highlighted in a fast-cut segment of ‘Sly Lives!’ where producers Terry Lewis and Jimmy Jam discuss its influence on Janet Jackson’s ‘Rhythm Nation.’ That same quick-cutting, DJ-like pacing can be found in the first few minutes of ‘Ladies & Gentlemen… 50 Years of SNL Music‘ as Questlove splices and dices what seems like hundreds of live segments — from the B-52s to Olivia Rodriguez — rhythmically, in the blink of an eye.\n\nQuestlove told Billboard magazine that Sly Stone was “essentially” the first Black megastar. “Sly is basically the he embodiment of what Martin Luther King’s ‘I Have a Dream’ speech was about, like this utopian multiracial mix of Black and whites, men and women together.”\n\nPatel goes on to say that he, however, didn’t know Sly’s discography in order, but did know those Family Stone hits, as well as the decline of Sly Stone that followed – the drug addiction, the arrests, the manner in which he missed live concerts and recording dates, and allowed his career to slip away.\n\n“I knew how he tried to win back his fame, that he was a junkie and lived in a camper,” says Patel. “The challenge for me was to become fluent so as to best tell his story and use his life and work as an avatar for this larger idea: the burden of Black genius.”\n\nQuestlove told Deadline that Sly’s undoing at his own hands was “the point of this whole film about self-sabotage. But he wrote the alphabet, and we’re still writing books from that alphabet to this day.”\n\nWhen it comes to the present day, and the ‘Sly’ documentary’s take on the idea of Black genius, Questlove spoke to Black music innovators Vernon Reid, Q-Tip, Chaka Khan, André 3000, and, most particularly D’Angelo — artists whose earliest works broke down barriers of what it means to make Black music, and had issues with how to move forward with the weight of expectation put upon them.\n\n“Can you imagine Sly after having just headlined Woodstock, being on the cover of Rolling Stone, having Black and White America are both looking to you as if you just solved race relations through your music—what pressure that must have been for him?,” asks Patel. “Connecting the stories of Sly and everyone else in the film came down to Ahmir’s own experiences with fame.”",

        "fullContent": "Sign up for our email newsletter to stay up-to-date on the latest local sports news throughout Philadelphia.\n\nThe Philadelphia Phillies roaming BayCare Ballpark’s outfield grass at Phillies Spring Training should look familiar. The existing crew of Nick Castellanos (157 starts), Kyle Schwarber (5 starts), Brandon Marsh (115), Johan Rojas (103), Weston Wilson (15), and Kody Clemens (1) returns to the outfield grass in Clearwater, Florida. One new face has been added to the mix as Philly turns to Max Kepler, a 31-year-old free-agent addition from Minnesota, who spent a decade with the Twins organization. Last season, the Phillies were a top-10 outfield unit in the MLB on the way to their first N.L. East Division title since 2011.\n\nSchwarber, Marsh, and Wilson split the left-field duties at Citizens Bank Park last season. With the addition of Kepler to the mix, Phillies manager Rob Thompson has more options to mix and match the position as needed entering this season.\n\nLeft Field Platoon\n\nDespite his 1.000% fielding percentage in 41 outfield innings last year, Kyle Schwarber should focus on saving energy to demolish baseballs towards City Hall this summer. The 31-year-old slugger placed inside the top 10 in HR (38), RBIs (104), and runs scored (110). Schwarber’s 106 walks were the best in the National League, with Los Angeles Dodgers superstar Shohei Ohtani’s 81 free passes in second place.\n\nBrandon Marsh, 27, played most of last season as part of a left-field platoon. He logged 684 innings over 97 games in this position and had a .978 fielding percentage. The five errors Marsh committed in the outfield last season were tied for second-worst in the MLB. It would not be shocking to see the Phillies’ addition of Kepler to the outfield, reducing Marsh’s role slightly. Marsh must rebound from a disastrous playoff appearance with one hit in 13 plate appearances for a .077 average in the 2024 postseason.\n\nMax Kepler, 31, should see his playing time in left field, given Nick Castellanos’s stranglehold on the starting spot in right field. The MLB veteran should not be a liability risk in the outfield, bringing a .993% fielding percentage in over 1,000 MLB appearances in a decade-long career. The 6-foot-4 outfielder is a .237 career hitter with 161 HRs and 508 RBIs on 1,034 games with Minnesota. Last season, Kepler played 105 games for the Twins with a .253 batting average, 8 HRs, and 42 RBIs, featuring injury concerns down the stretch run.\n\nWeston Wilson, 30, appeared at seven of the nine positions on the baseball diamond last season, including pitcher. Left field was the preferred starting destination last season, with Wilson logging 125 error-free innings in front of Harry The K’s outdoor bar. The Milwaukee Brewers draft pick from 2016 has a .288 batting average in 104 plate appearances in the MLB.\n\nFeb 12, 2025; Clearwater, FL, USA; Members of the Philadelphia Phillies prepare to workout during spring training at Carpenter Complex. Mandatory Credit: Jonathan Dyer-Imagn Images\n\nCenterfield Duo\n\nJohan Rojas, 24, received the majority of action in centerfield for Rob Thompson last season. Over 903 innings, Rojas was excellent defensively, finishing with a 991% fielding percentage, the fifth-best among centerfielders in the National League. The 5-foot-11 speedster features a .261 batting average over two MLB seasons, proving reliable in generating sacrifice hits for the Phillies. Rojas finished third in the N.L. with eight sacrifice hits in 2024 and fourth in 2023 after six successful sacrifice attempts. The MLB postseason has been unkind to Rojas, who has a .104 batting average with 16 strikeouts over 51 plate appearances.\n\nThe combination of Marsh and Kepler will likely sub for Rojas when he needs a break. Marsh has 248 starts in center field in his MLB career, including 35 last season for Philly. Those 30+ games represent a substantial 20% of the MLB campaign. Kepler brings 127 games worth of centerfield experience to Rob Thompson’s lineup but has not had meaningful action in centerfield since 2021.\n\nRight Field Ironman\n\nNick Castellanos, 32, led the National League with 157 starts in right field last season on his way to playing every game of the MLB season last year. Castellanos has earned his everyday status from Rob Thompson by not making mistakes in the field despite a grueling workload. The 2010 Detroit Tigers draft pick finished first in RF fielding percentage in the N.L. for the third season since joining Philadelphia in 2022.\n\nIn three seasons in Philadelphia, Castellanos has a .263 batting average, 65 HRs, and 254 RBIs. Castellanos has appeared in 319 of 324 games, or 98%, for the Phillies over the last two seasons, with only five absences from the lineup. He has also been one of the more reliable run producers in the Phillies lineup in the postseason, with 6 HRs and 17 RBIs during three playoff runs in Philly.\n\nPhillies Bench Options\n\nMarsh and Wilson should find opportunities to play but are expected to spend most afternoons watching from the Citizens Bank Park dugout. Kody Clemens, 28, could also find a small role as a replacement player in the Phillies outfield during the season. Primarily an infielder, Clemens started one game in left field last season and has 72 innings of experience over three MLB seasons between Detroit and Philadelphia. Schwarber is excluded from bench options as he will find his way into the starting designated hitter spot in Thompson’s lineup card, as he did more often than not last season.\n\nMandatory Credit: Bill Streicher-USA TODAY Sports",

Managers make their decisions based on the numbers.” What better way to start a brand new Phillies season than with a new piece looking at the numbers behind Philadelphia baseball?\n\nAs Philly’s baseball team trickles into Clearwater, Florida, over the next week for the start of baseball activities, let’s take our first look at some relevant numbers that will allow you to drop some knowledge on your baseball-loving buddies this spring.\n\nPhillies By Numbers\n\n0- Days remaining until Phillies Spring Training arrives in 2025. Seriously! Despite the winter weather swirling around Philadelphia, the trucks have already arrived, and Phillies GM Dave Dombrowski has held a press conference to provide some new nuggets of information. For those who don’t have time to watch it, PSN’s Cory Nidoh broke it all down for you!\n\n1- Phillies rookies to hit for the cycle: Weston Wilson last August against Washington. It was the 10th cycle in Phillies history. Wilson smacked a triple off the wall in right in the 4th before a pop-up single landed him on first base later in that same inning. The cycle watch was on after Wilson blasted a 7th-inning home run. Wilson’s name was etched in the history books in the 8th inning as he connected with a double, sending the home crowd into a frenzy as he strolled into second base.\n\n2- Games Against the N.L. East during Grapefruit League action—both are against Atlanta. The Phillies were 6-7 last season against the Atlanta Braves, with a 4-3 home record in Philadelphia and a 2-4 visiting record in Georgia.\n\n4- Number of Phillies to claim MLB’s National League Rookie-of-the-Year Award. Jack Sanford claimed the first one in franchise history in 1957, followed by Richie “Dick” Allen a few seasons later in 1964. Three more decades passed before Scott Rolen’s award-winning campaign in 1997. Ryan Howard’s 22 HR and 63 RBI during the 2005 season claimed the franchise’s most recent breakout rookie trophy.\n\nFeb 12, 2025; Clearwater, FL, USA; Philadelphia Phillies special instructor Cole Hamels looks on during a spring training workout at Carpenter Complex Mandatory Credit: Jonathan Dyer-Imagn Images\n\n15- Number worn by new Hall of Famer Dick Allen over his 9-year Phillies career. Allen played 1,070 games in a Phillies uniform with a .290 batting average, 204 HRs, and 655 RBIs. In his 1964 rookie campaign, he led the National League in runs scored (125) and total bases (352) for the season. Despite a batting average above .300, Allen unceremoniously led the N.L. in strikeouts during his first two seasons in the majors—138 in 1964 and 150 in 1965.\n\n31- The number of games the Phillies play during spring training. The Toronto Blue Jays and the New York Yankees are tied for most games against Philadelphia at five games each. The Boston Red Sox and the Braves have two scheduled appearances against the Phillies this spring.\n\n79- Number of times Philadelphia’s MLB club has held spring training in Clearwater. According to MLB’s Todd Zolecki, the Phillies trained in ten different states between 1900 and 1946 before settling in South Florida. Philadelphia first appeared in Clearwater in 1947 when it signed a 10-year contract and promised to add an expensive sprinkler system at Athletic Field. The city would pay the team back for most of the purchase price over the next decade.\n\n95- Total wins for the Phillies last season. Philly was 95-67, including a 54-27 home record at Citizens Bank Park. As a road squad last season, the Phillies played one game over .500 baseball with a 41-40 record. Of course, we all know what happened in the postseason, so no need to go any further there.\n\n224- Number of MLB strikeout victims by Zach Wheeler in 2024. He was tied for second overall in the National League with San Deigo’s Dylan Cease (224). Both pitchers finished behind Atlanta’s Chris Sale (225) in the N.L. punchout competition. Detroit Tigers All-Star Tarik Skubal led the MLB with 228 strikeouts in 2024.\n\nFeb 12, 2025; Clearwater, FL, USA; Philadelphia Phillies pitcher Aaron Nola (27) warms up during a spring training workout at Carpenter Complex. Mandatory Credit: Jonathan Dyer-Imagn Images\n\n800- Approximate weight (in pounds) of the 2,400 baseballs that traveled to spring training with the Phillies. The weight is equivalent to that of a grown grizzly bear. While it seems silly to suggest every one of the spherical objects will see game day action, that math works out to 150 baseballs per game for each of the 16 home dates at BayCare Park this spring.\n\n1,058- Miles (approximately) between Citizens Bank Park in Pennsylvania and BayCare Park in Florida. According to Google’s highly scientific calculations, it takes between 15-16 hours to drive from Philadelphia, PA, to Clearwater, FL. While it is possible to take a train ride down the East Coast, be prepared to book almost a full day in your travel itinerary for the ride. Of course, air travel provides the quickest path to Florida, with a flight time of between two to three hours.\n\n10,000- Number of paper cups the Phillies loaded onto trucks for spring training.

During this fan event, Smith briefly addressed the media, reflecting on the Eagles‘ recent victory in Super Bowl LIX, the many fans in attendance to see him, and more.\n\nOne thing you quickly learn about Smith when speaking with him is that he is a man of few words who prefers to let his actions speak for him. While Smith isn’t your typical boisterous star wide receiver, he let some media members in on his thoughts since the Super Bowl.\n\nFootball – NFL – Super Bowl LIX – Philadelphia Eagles v Kansas City Chiefs – Caesars Superdome, New Orleans, Louisiana, United States – February 9, 2025 Philadelphia Eagles’ DeVonta Smith celebrates scoring a touchdown with teammates REUTERS/Brian Snyder\n\nWhen asked about his expectations for the parade, which was set to begin in less than 24 hours, Smith expressed that he was “worried about the cold more than anything,” with a joking but sincere grin.\n\nFlashing back to the game, Smith was asked about his emotions and state of mind during the game in New Orleans. For the Amite City native, it was a homecoming of sorts.\n\n“I think it was just being back at home,” Smith reflected. “[I’m] very familiar with that building, played two state championships in it, being home in front of the family, I think that was it more so that than anything.”\n\nFeb 9, 2025; New Orleans, LA, USA; Philadelphia Eagles wide receiver DeVonta Smith (6) makes a catch for a touchdown against Kansas City Chiefs cornerback Jaylen Watson (35) during the second half of Super Bowl LIX at Caesars Superdome.

Smith added a Super Bowl to his resume, which already included a state championship appearance, two college football championships at Alabama, a Heisman trophy, and much more. Among Smith’s many accolades is his record of the most playoff receiving yards in Philadelphia Eagles history (595 yards).\n\nWhen asked by Philly Sports Network what the future held for Smith and his Eagles, he simply replied with a single, powerful statement: “Try to repeat it.”\n\nIt’s clear that while Smith had plans to enjoy this victory, next season is already on his mind.\n\nFootball – NFL – Super Bowl LIX – Philadelphia Eagles v Kansas City Chiefs – Caesars Superdome, New Orleans, Louisiana, United States – February 9, 2025 Philadelphia Eagles’ A.J.

However, on the biggest stage, Smith continued to prove his doubters wrong, coming up large in the biggest moments on the biggest stage.\n\nIn parting, Smith addressed the next generation, specifically those who, like him, have been doubted because of their size.\n\nPhiladelphia Eagles’ star wide receiver DeVonta Smith takes a photo with a fan at an autograph signing at the Dick’s Sporting Goods in Deptford, New Jersey.\n\n“Trust your training.

        "fullContent": "New Yorkers called on Gov. Kathy Hochul to remove Mayor Eric Adams from office at a rally in Lower Manhattan on Feb. 16, 2025.\n\nOn the same day Mayor Eric Adams insisted he isn’t going anywhere, scores of protesters marched in Lower Manhattan Sunday demanding that Gov. Kathy Hochul use her executive power to remove the embattled mayor from power.\n\nSome 200 demonstrators from a coalition of activist groups — including Food & Water Watch, New York Communities for Change, Make the Road New York, Rise and Resist, and Jews For Racial and Economic Justice — gathered for the rally on a rainy Feb. 16 under the arch next to the David N. Dinkins Manhattan Municipal Building. They joined the calls of a growing number of Democratic political leaders who have been pressuring Hochul to give Adams the boot after President Trump’s Justice Department filed a motion to dismiss the five-count criminal indictment against Hizzoner “without prejudice,” fearing that he would do Trump’s bidding in exchange for dropping the charges.\n\nThe cooperation, Democratic leaders and activists fear, will result in the mass deportation of New Yorkers and their families. Alícia Nascimento, political director for New York Communities for Change, explained to the press that the organization held the emergency rally because they believed Adams was being “held hostage” by President Trump.\n\n“The Mayor essentially has a quid pro quo with the President that if he were able to dismiss the corruption charges, which he never went to trial [for],” Nascimento said, “then ICE would have reign over our city, and the federal government would be able to do whatever it wanted in a sanctuary city.”\n\nProtesters questioned Mayor Adams’ ability to lead the largest city in the country, especially after U.S. Attorney Danielle Sassoon of the Southern District of New York (SDNY) resigned and, in an eight-page letter, accused the mayor’s attorney’s of offering a “quid pro quo” to the Trump Justice Department, promising cooperation on the immigration crackdown in exchange for dropping the charges.\n\nWhile Adams insists he did nothing wrong and denies cutting a deal with the White House to have the case dropped, just last Friday, Adams appeared alongside Tom Homan, Trump’s border czar, in a live interview on FOX & Friends. Homan warned that he would be “up [Adams] butt” if he didn’t comply with Trump’s immigration crackdown.\n\nAt a meeting between the pair a day prior, Adams promised Homan he would allow Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents to operate on Rikers Island. Two weeks ago, Mayor Adams issued a memo to migrant shelter contractors, schools, and hospitals, stating that if employees felt threatened, they could allow agents of the U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement to enter migrant shelters without a judicial warrant — which would amount to a violation of New York City’s Sanctuary Laws.\n\nBefore the crowd of about 200 marched to the United States Federal Court House on Sunday, Assemblymember Harvey Epstein (D-Manhattan) pointed out that New York City immigrants are afraid to send their children to school or go to the hospital because of the memo the Mayor issued a few weeks ago.\n\n“That is not the New York we believe in. The mayor has to leave, and if he doesn’t decide to resign, he must be removed from office. That is our message, loud and clear,” Epstein declared.\n\nQueens Assembly member and Democratic socialist candidate for mayor Zohran Mamdani said that Adams was a “walking emergency.”\n\n“That is why I am calling on Governor Hochul to remove Mayor Adams from office immediately. Every single day that we let Mayor Adams sit in City Hall is another day that he could give up New York City to Donald Trump,” Mamdani said.\n\nAlong with ousting Adams, demonstrators further demanded that Hochul sign The New York for All Act, introduced by Brooklyn state Sen. Andrew Gounardes and Bronx Assembly Member Karines Reyes. The legislation, S.2235/A3506, would prohibit New York’s state and local government agencies, including police and sheriffs, from colluding with ICE, disclosing sensitive information, and diverting personnel or other resources to further federal immigration.\n\nCurrently, only New York City and Westchester County have sanctuary laws within the Empire State.",

        "fullContent": "article\n\nThe Brief States that implemented abortion bans had higher infant mortality rates. A new study finds that the infant mortality rate for births connected to the abortion ban were higher than expected. Rates of births and deaths were evaluated using data between 2012 and 2013 before abortion restrictions took effect.\n\n\n\nA new study reveals that states with abortion bans experienced an increase in infant mortality rates.\n\nThe study published in the medical journal JAMA noted that in 14 states that implemented complete or 6-week abortion bans after the Supreme Court Dobbs decision revoked the federal right to abortion, the fertility rate increased 1.7%, leading to roughly 1 additional birth for every 1,000 women of reproductive age.\n\nRELATED: Abortion laws by state\n\nBy the numbers:\n\nThe study also found that with roughly 500 deaths than expected among nearly 22,000 additional births, the infant mortality rate for births linked to abortion bans – 24 deaths for every 1,000 births – was approximately four times higher than projected.\n\nThe estimated increases in infant mortality were larger for deaths based on congenital causes and among groups that had higher than average infant mortality rates at baseline, including Black infants and those in southern states.\n\nHow was data gathered for the study?\n\nResearchers used study data that included biannual counts of neonatal and infant deaths, and the corresponding total number of live births, from birth and death certificate data compiled by the National Center for Health Statistics for all 50 US states and the District of Columbia from January 2012 through December 2023.\n\nThe study noted that biannual counts of infant deaths and live births were separately pulled for four racial and ethnic groups (racial and ethnic data were acquired from the death certificate, which is identified by the next of kin, coroner, or other person who certified the death) for each state over the same period.\n\nRELATED: Survey: 3 in 4 reproductive age women in the US think abortion should be legal\n\nThe primary outcome was the infant mortality rate, calculated as the number of infant deaths per 1000 live births in each biannual period for each state over 12 years. Mortality rates were calculated overall and by race and ethnicity, timing of death and cause of death.\n\nThis study found that states that banned abortion had infant mortality rates higher than would have been expected without such bans. The largest estimated changes were observed among southern states and Black infants.\n\nWhat did researchers conclude in the study?\n\nResearchers noted that their analysis found an estimated increase of 0.33 infant deaths per 1000 live births above expected in states that banned abortion.\n\nWhat they're saying:\n\nThe team shared that the results are consistent with clinician and media reports documenting denial of terminations for nonviable pregnancies, forcing pregnant women to overcome significant barriers to receive timely abortion care out of state or carry the pregnancy to term.\n\n\n\nAccording to the study, the increase in infant mortality rate due to noncongenital causes is less straightforward and needs more investigation.\n\nMoreover, researchers explained that the study provides new evidence that infant deaths were higher than expected in states that enforced abortion bans after the bans were implemented.",

While the order is unlikely to have a significant national effect, as most schools and colleges have already dropped their vaccine requirements, it threatens to withhold federal funding from institutions still enforcing COVID-19 vaccine mandates.\n\n\n\nPresident Donald Trump signed an executive order on Friday which directs the Education Department and Health and Human Services to create a plan to end vaccine mandates for COVID-19.\n\nThe order aims to fulfill a campaign promise from Trump, who often said he would \"not give one penny to any school that has a vaccine mandate.\"\n\nTrump says COVID-19 mandates in school infrige on ‘personal freedom’\n\nWhat they're saying:\n\n\"Given the incredibly low risk of serious COVID-19 illness for children and young adults, threatening to shut them out of an education is an intolerable infringement on personal freedom,\" the order said.\n\nDig deeper:\n\nThe order is expected to have little national impact because COVID-19 vaccine mandates have mostly been dropped at schools and colleges across the United States, and many states have passed legislation forbidding such mandates.\n\nFILE: Doctor with COVID-19 vaccine.

A few continue to require vaccines at least for students living on campus, including Swarthmore and Oberlin colleges. Most of those colleges allow medical or religious exemptions.\n\nSchools requiring vaccine at risk of losing federal funding\n\nThe order also said schools, colleges and states that require students to be immunized against COVID-19 may be at risk of losing federal funding.\n\nThe order didn't identify specific sources of money that could be at risk.

CEO Steve Huffman said paid subreddits are \"coming\" and currently \"in the works.\" Reddit has had trouble generating profit and went public last March.\n\n\n\nA new feature is expected to roll out on Reddit later this year that could put some content behind a paywall.\n\nReddit’s co-founder and CEO Steve Huffman spoke more on the idea of paid subreddits in a recent company Ask Me Anything (AMA).\n\nHere’s what to know:\n\nWhat is Reddit?\n\nThe backstory:\n\nReddit is a technology and social network company that was founded more than 20 years ago. It is a sought-after space for internet discussions of any topic within communities, also known as subreddits.\n\nReddit has more than 100 million daily active users, Huffman said last week , who visit the site to discuss a range of topics from silly memes to existential worries, as well as to get recommendations from like-minded people.\n\nDespite its popularity, Reddit has had trouble turning profit since it was founded in 2005. It’s been looking for ways to boost revenue, and went public in March of last year.\n\nBy the numbers:\n\nBy tech industry’s standards though, Reddit remains small for a company that has been around since 2005.\n\nLast year, Reddit’s annual revenue generation was just below $1 billion. For comparison, Meta boasts an annual revenue of $135 billion.\n\nMeta had a market value of more than $1.2 trillion in 2024. Reddit’s market value was priced at $6.4 billion when it went public last March.\n\nRELATED: TikTok returns to Apple, Google app stores after temporary removal\n\nPaid subreddits\n\nWhat we know:\n\nHuffman has talked about the idea of paid subreddits before, and mentioned that when asked about it again in a recent AMA alongside Chief Operating Officer Jen Wong and Chief Financial Officer Drew Volleror.\n\n\"That one’s coming. We’re working on it as we speak,\" Hoffman said.\n\nA paid subreddit would put a paywall, of sorts, around designated content, meaning that only members who pay could access that subreddit, or \"community,\" and see its content.\n\nWhat we don't know:\n\nHoffman didn’t elaborate on the timeline users can expect for the paid subreddits.\n\nHe also didn’t indicate how much users could expect to pay for some content, or if the amount would be fixed by Reddit or perhaps set by the creator.\n\nRELATED: Facebook fact-checking to be replaced with X-style community notes\n\nWhat's next:\n\nHoffman spoke on some other new key features that Reddit users can expect for 2025:\n\nPaid subreddits\n\nImproved search results\n\nReddit Answers, which uses AI to summarize search results from Reddit’s user base\n\nLaying the foundation for an eventual marketplace",

Like that is unheard of sometimes in these massive crowds. So, we would repeat it again, for sure!\"\n\nA family from Wyoming had zero complaints getting to and from the city.\n\nRelated article\n\n\"We thought it was smooth, really. I mean of course, the amount of people, yes there was waiting coming back, but that’s nothing. It’s really not that all,\" Brian Belmont stated, followed by Brady Belmonte, who added, \"Oh I thought it went pretty well. It was pretty organized. Not too bad, definitely a change from what we deal with every day.\"\n\nDig deeper:\n\nThe lines were long, unless you found a loophole.\n\nMelissa Guillen, from Berwyn, explained, \"You would turn a corner and you’re like no way could it keep going further and it kept going further.

But, they passed the time by making new friends and lifelong memories.\n\n\"It was like a good hour, or two, for us, but if you just sit there, it was probably like a five, four hour wait,\" Maui Morris said.\n\n\"But was it worth it?\" Kolodziej asked.\n\n\"It was, it really was. You say Go Birds! I’ll do anything for my city. I’d do it again in a heartbeat!\"\n\nThe overall theme:\n\nSo, that was the main theme – people had to wait to get on the train or the El or the bus, but they would do it again. Kudos to SEPTA and Amtrak for making it a smooth ride for most people to and from the parade.",

The program deadline was Feb. 6, and administration officials said employees who accept will be able to stop working while still collecting a paycheck until Sept. 30.\n\nRELATED: Federal worker buyout deadline: What we know about the deferred resignation program\n\nFILE - The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) building in Washington, DC, US, on Tuesday, Dec. 31, 2024.

Pearl Milling was originally branded as Aunt Jemima before 2021.\n\nOn Thursday, the FDA updated the recall category to Class I, which pertains to \"situation[s] in which there is a reasonable probability that the use of, or exposure to, a violative product will cause serious adverse health consequences or death.\"\n\nIn a January press release, the company noted that certain two-pound boxes of the product contained \"undeclared milk.\"\n\nTUNA CANS SOLD AT TRADER JOE'S, WALMART AND OTHER SUPERMARKETS RECALLED OVER 'POTENTIALLY FATAL' FLAW\n\n\"[The recall was announced] after being alerted by a retail partner,\" the statement noted. \"Those with an allergy or severe sensitivity to milk run the risk of a serious or life-threatening allergic reaction if they consume the recalled product.\"\n\nThe mixes were distributed to retailers in 11 states: Arkansas, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Minnesota, Mississippi, Nebraska, Utah and Wisconsin. Consumers could have bought the recalled products as early as Nov. 18 of last year.\n\nNo other Pearl Milling pancake and waffle mixes have been recalled, and the recall strictly pertains to products with a UPC code of 30000 65040 and a best-by date of Sept. 12, 2025.\n\nPOPULAR BRAND OF PET FOOD RECALLED DUE TO SALMONELLA CONCERNS: 'CONTACT YOUR VETERINARIAN'\n\nAunt Jemima logo updated to Pearl Milling Company, Quaker Oats stated old logo was based on a racial stereotype.

In December 2023, Quaker Oats recalled over two dozen types of granola bars and cereals due to a salmonella contamination risk.\n\nIn March 2021, the company recalled thousands of bags of its Quaker Rice Crisps Sweet Barbecue Flavor over the possibility of undeclared soy.\n\nFOX Business reached out to Quaker Oats for additional comment.\n\nRead more from FOX Business",

Otero awaits arraignment and extradition proceedings.\n\n\n\nAfter three months on the run, New York State Troopers have captured a man wanted for the murder of his ex-girlfriend in Philadelphia.\n\nThe ‘lifelong criminal,’ as described by U.S. Marshal Supervisory Deputy Robert Clark, now awaits extradition.\n\nThe backstory:\n\nOn November 8, 2024, the body of 29-year-old Melody Rivera was found buried in a shallow grave on the 900 block of Tustin Road in Philadelphia's Fox Chase neighborhood.\n\nAt the time, sources say they looked into the alleged boyfriend of the victim, identified as Geovanni Otero, 29, and found he had a criminal history involving a gun case.\n\nOtero was on parole for that case and had a GPS-tracking ankle monitor which sources say helped detectives narrow him down as a person of interest.\n\nBased on the GPS tracker and more developing evidence, sources say police believe Otero killed the woman and brought her a few miles away to the scene in Fox Chase and buried her body.\n\nOtero was at-large and federal agents joined the search to find him.\n\nU.S. Marshals added $5,000 to the Philadelphia Police Department's $20,000 reward for information leading to Otero's arrest.\n\nAt the time, Rivera’s family said she left behind an 11-year-old daughter and described her as ‘kind, funny and loving.’\n\nWhat we know:\n\nOn Saturday, February 15, 2025, New York State Troopers Charko and Pelaez attempted to stop a vehicle reported stolen from Virginia.\n\nThey say the driver initially complied before fleeing the scene a high rate of speed, prompting a brief pursuit lasting approximately one minute and covering one mile.\n\nOfficials say the pursuit ended when the suspect crashed the stolen vehicle.\n\nThen he fled on foot..

Some activists and BOP employees don't think its right to hold immigrants who haven't been convicted of crimes in a prison. President Trump has vowed to deport the 11.7 immigrants in the U.S. who are here illegally.\n\n\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security and the Bureau of Prisons signed a contract to turn five federal prisons into ICE detention centers, a leaked memo obtained by KTVU shows.\n\nThe memo, signed on Feb. 6, shows that two units at the Federal Detention Center in Atlanta, up to 1 unit at the Federal Correctional Institute Leavenworth in Kansas, up to 1 unit at FDC Philadelphia and up to four units at FCI Berlin in New Hampshire and up to four units at FCI Miami will be used to house ICE detainees.\n\nThe memo has a caveat that FCI Berlin is not currently available because there is not enough staffing, food, clothing and training at this site.\n\nThe memo also states that because there isn't enough space, only men will be housed at these sites.\n\nFCI Dublin in California – which is currently empty after it was closed in April 2024 after a high-profile sex abuse scandal – was not mentioned in this memo, but a source told KTVU that this was the first round of memos and more will likely be coming.\n\nHowever, ICE officials visited FCI Dublin on Thursday and Friday, according to John Kostelnik, the Western region vice president of the American Federation of Government Employees Council of Prison Locals No. 33, which represents federal prison workers.\n\n\"We don't know the questions that are being asked,\" he said on Friday. \"We don't know the exact specifics, but they're most certainly touring as an assessment to potentially utilizing this facility.\"\n\nThe memo was signed by Kenneth Genalo, acting deputy director of ICE and William Lothrop, who was named head of the BOP after Colette Peters left on the day Donald Trump was sworn in as president.\n\nBut Lothrop announced his resignation on Friday, according to an internal staff statement, also obtained by KTVU.\n\nLothrop said that he finds himself in \"unprecedented times as an agency, and thus, it is with mixed emotions\" that he is retiring Feb. 28 after 33 years with the BOP. He also named five other members of the BOP team who are leaving office.\n\nTrump has vowed to deport millions of the estimated 11.7 million people in the U.S. illegally. ICE currently has the budget to detain only about 41,000 people and the administration has not said how many detention beds it needs to achieve its goals.\n\nOne source told KTVU that many BOP employees are upset about the change.\n\nThe source said that it's not fair to put immigrants in federal prisons because they have not been charged or convicted of crimes. The conditions of confinement in prison are much different than in an ICE detention center, the source said.\n\nThe last time federal prisons were turned into ICE detention centers occurred during Trump's first administration in 2018.\n\nThe BOP reached an agreement with ICE and Customs and Border Protection back then to detain up to 1,600 immigrants at federal prison facilities in Arizona, California, Oregon, Washington and Texas.\n\nThe source said that in some cases, staff assaulted detainees, and some detainees also died by suicide.\n\nKendra Drysdale, who was once incarcerated at FCI Dublin, doesn't think immigrants should be housed in a federal prison.\n\n\"To put people who are not even criminals into a prison environment is absolutely horrific and a huge violation of human rights.\"",

Streets, sanitation and other crews began clearing an enormous amount of trash. They expect to work until early morning.\n\nRelated article\n\nWhat they're saying:\n\nWith everything from blowers to brush trucks to trash trucks and hand-held trash pickers, the people who know how to get Philly back in physical shape got to work and fast.\n\n\"Shout out to the sanitation, shout out to the highway, shout out to the Philadelphia Water Department and shout out to all the essential workers,\" said a sanitation worker who goes by the name North Philly Meech.

        "fullContent": "The Brief Recent polling shows that Americans are largely contradictory when it comes to the federal budget. They think the government should spend more on key issues and programs – but less overall.\n\n\n\nAs President Donald Trump and Elon Musk push for extensive cuts to the federal budget, recent polling suggests Americans may not be on board with slashing education and humanitarian aid spending.\n\nAccording to polls from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research, U.S adults mostly think the government isn't spending enough on key issues and programs. But conversely – and the biggest challenge for lawmakers – Americans are broadly in favor of cuts to the federal budget.\n\nRELATED: DOGE subcommittee meeting holds 1st hearing focusing on 'war on waste'\n\nWhat do Americans think about government spending?\n\nWhat they're saying:\n\nAbout two-thirds of Americans say the U.S. government is spending \"too little\" on Social Security and education, according to a January AP-NORC poll. Another 6 in 10, roughly, say too little money is going to assistance to the poor. A similar share say spending is too low for Medicare, the national health care insurance program for seniors, and most also say Medicaid is under-funded by the federal government.\n\nRELATED: 75,000 federal workers take buyout after judge approves Trump’s downsizing plan\n\nAbout one-third of U.S. adults say the federal government is spending \"too much\" on the military. About one-third say the military is getting \"too little\" funding, and another one-third say it takes in \"about the right amount.\" But most Republicans say the military is underfunded, while slightly less than half of Democrats say it's getting too much money.\n\nFILE - The US Capitol is seen at sunrise on September 30, 2023 in Washington, DC. (Photo by Nathan Howard/Getty Images) Expand\n\nForeign aid is one area where there is broad consensus that the U.S. is overspending. The 2023 AP-NORC polling suggests that Americans tend to believe too much money is going to other countries.\n\nRoughly 7 in 10 U.S. adults said the government was putting too much money toward \"assistance to other countries.\" About 9 in 10 Republicans and just over half of Democrats agreed that the country was overspending on foreign aid at the time. But polling has also shown that U.S. adults tend to overestimate the share of the federal budget that is spent on foreign aid.\n\nWhat is the government actually spending?\n\nForeign aid spending\n\nBy the numbers:\n\nSurveys from KFF have found that, on average, Americans say spending on foreign aid makes up 31% of the federal budget rather than the actual answer: closer to 1% or less.\n\nSocial Security spending\n\nAccording to the nonpartisan Center on Budget Policies and Priorities (CBPP), in 2024, 21% of the budget, or $1.5 trillion, was spent on Social Security, providing monthly retirement benefits averaging $1,922 to 51.5 million retired workers. Social Security also paid benefits to 2.6 million spouses and children of retired workers, 5.8 million surviving children and spouses of deceased workers, and 8.4 million disabled workers and their eligible dependents.\n\nMedicare, Medicaid, CHIP and ACA spending\n\nFour health insurance programs — Medicare, Medicaid, the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP), and Affordable Care Act (ACA) marketplace health insurance subsidies — comprised a combined 24% of the 2024 federal budget, or $1.7 trillion. More than half – or $912 billion – went to Medicare, which provided health coverage to around 67 million people who are 65 or older or have disabilities.\n\nThe rest was spent on Medicaid and CHIP ($626 billion) and ACA subsidy and marketplace costs ($125 billion). Both Medicaid and CHIP require states to pay some of their total costs, according to the CBPP.\n\nDefense spending\n\nNational defense made up 13 percent of the budget, or $872 billion.\n\nRELATED: Coast Guard Commandant terminated over border lapses, recruitment, DEI focus: official\n\n\"About 95 percent of the spending in this category reflects the underlying costs of the Defense Department, largely for operations and maintenance; military personnel; procurement of weapons; and research, development, testing, and evaluation,\" the CBPP says.\n\nEducation spending\n\nIn 2024, the federal government spent about 5% of its total budget on education. This includes elementary, secondary, and vocational education; higher education; and research and general educational aids",

Lovebirds said there’s nothing like celebrating the Birds and Valentine’s Day in the city.\n\n\n\nAre you feeling the love?\n\nThis weekend, many couples are celebrating a belated Valentine’s Day since the holiday fell on the same day as the Eagles Super Bowl parade. Businesses and restaurants took that into consideration and extended the love to patrons, by extending their holiday specials past Friday.\n\nWhat we know:\n\nReesa Tellez and her boyfriend of seven years, Jimmy, celebrated Valentine’s Day at Mamajuana Café in Fishtown, albeit a day after the actual holiday.\n\n\"Our reservation was for yesterday here, and they were so nice. I explained we’re going to the parade can we come tomorrow? They’re like absolutely. So, understanding, so cool. So yeah, we’re here today after some good night sleep,\" said Tellez. \"Excited to get the Latin vibe. Mofongo, sushi, nice little drink. Definitely excited.\"\n\nGeneral Manager David Alvarez, of the Dominican Caribbean restaurant, said this was a common occurrence Friday night, but they decided to extend their hours and the holiday the rest of the weekend and made up for rescheduled reservations.\n\n\"Our kitchen closes at midnight so we extended an hour more to try to accommodate as many customers as we could, since we were so grateful to have so many people picking us to come out and celebrate this special day with their significant others,\" said Alvarez.\n\nAlvarez said when all was said and done, about 600 to 700 people dined and wined at Mamajuana Café Friday evening. The Valentine’s Day special cocktails are available through Sunday, including a drink called \"Secret of Love\" that provides customers with an interactive experience when it’s served.\n\nThe other side:\n\nAn alternative intimate experience in Manayunk invited couples to \"Love at First Fright\" at Lincoln Mill Haunted House.\n\n\"Come on, what’s more romantic than going to a haunted house for Valentine’ s Day where you’re forced to get all close to your date or loved one,\" asked Jared Bilsak, Co-founder and Architect of Lincoln Mill Haunted House.\n\nBilsak suspects the parade may have hurt turnout a little, but the event still saw droves of crowds with final numbers nearing 1,000 attendees.\n\n\"We pretty much turned out all the lights inside and we gave couples a little battery powered candle so they have to navigate through the darkness and it’s very dark in there,\" said Bilsak. \"This was their first date – their first date was through a haunted house and all three couples were like, ‘It won’t be our last date.’\"\n\nWhat's next:\n\nAlvarez said Mamajuana Café is extending Valentine’s Day into their Sunday brunch and dinner service.\n\n\"Being here with the people you love and making good memories, that’s what it’s all about, and seeing other people do the same,\" said Tellez.",

        "fullContent": "The Brief Donald Trump attended the Daytona 500 for the second time as president, continuing his tradition of engaging with sports audiences. His presence highlights NASCAR's conservative-leaning fan base and his broader effort to align with American sports culture. Drivers, including Chase Elliott, acknowledge the significance of a president attending the event: \"It certainly brings a lot of eyes.\"\n\n\n\nPresident Donald Trump attended the Daytona 500 on Sunday, marking his second appearance at NASCAR’s most prestigious race as president.\n\nSpirit of NASCAR will 'fuel America's Golden Age'\n\nWhat we know:\n\nPresident Trump is back in Daytona Beach for The Great American Race. It's the second appearance at the race as president. His first visit was in 2020 while running for reelection. That year, he served as grand marshal, delivering the command for drivers to start their engines and making a dramatic entrance with an Air Force One flyover.\n\nFor this trip, Air Force One departed from Palm Beach International Airport shortly after noon, carrying Trump, his son Eric, grandson Luke, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy, Interior Secretary Doug Burgum and his wife, Kathryn. Several members of Congress were also accompanying him, according to the White House.\n\nTrump also thrilled NASCAR fans in the stands with another Air Force One flyover before he rode in the presidential limousine onto the Daytona International Speedway.\n\nTrump has made a point of attending major sporting events, having recently become the first sitting president to attend a Super Bowl. His presence at college football games and UFC fights, along with his well-documented passion for golf, further underscores his efforts to align himself with sports culture.\n\nWhat we don't know:\n\nIt remained unclear whether Trump had any official role at the Daytona 500 this year, as he did in 2020 when he was grand marshal. The extent of his involvement in pre-race ceremonies or interactions with drivers has not been disclosed.\n\nThe backstory:\n\nTrump’s relationship with NASCAR extends beyond his appearances at the Daytona 500. In 2018, while in the White House, he honored NASCAR Cup Series champion Martin Truex Jr. and Furniture Row Racing. More recently, in May of last year, he attended the Coca-Cola 600 at Charlotte Motor Speedway, a major race in the swing state of North Carolina, as a former president and reelection candidate.\n\nTrump has often spoken about his admiration for the sport and its fans, praising the courage of drivers and the patriotic spirit of NASCAR events. His presence at Daytona aligns with his broader strategy of cultivating support among sports audiences.\n\nBig picture view:\n\nTrump’s appearance at the Daytona 500 reinforces his ongoing effort to maintain visibility among sports fans, particularly those in key political battlegrounds. With NASCAR’s fan base traditionally seen as conservative-leaning, his presence at the event could bolster his appeal among a segment of voters who value his brand of patriotism and showmanship.\n\nHis attendance follows a recent pattern of high-profile sports event visits, including last weekend’s Super Bowl. These appearances, coupled with his history of engaging with NASCAR and other sports leagues, reflect a continued strategy of associating himself with American sports culture.\n\nImage 1 of 9 ▼ DAYTONA BEACH, FLORIDA - FEBRUARY 16: Air Force One is seen for U.S. President Donald Trump's visit to the NASCAR Cup Series Daytona 500 at Daytona International Speedway on February 16, 2025 in Daytona Beach, Florida.

        "source": "https://www.fox29.com/",
        "fullContent": "The Brief A Gallup poll found that 45% of Democrats want their party to be more moderate, an 11-point increase since 2021. Meanwhile, 43% of Republicans prefer their party's current ideology, with fewer calling for a more conservative shift. The results come after Donald Trump’s inauguration for his second term as president and Republican control of Congress.\n\n\n\nAfter losing the presidency and Senate in the 2024 election, an increasing number of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents say they want their party to become more moderate rather than maintain its current liberal stance.\n\nA Gallup poll, published last month, found that 45% of Democrats now favor a moderate shift, up from 34% in 2021. Meanwhile, 29% of Democrats still want their party to move in a more liberal direction, a five-point drop from 2021.\n\nAt the same time, Republicans are largely satisfied with their party's ideology under Trump, with 43% of GOP voters saying the party should stay the same. Only 28% want the party to become more conservative, a significant drop from 40% in 2021.\n\nWhat’s behind the shift?\n\nThe backstory:\n\nOne factor that may be influencing Democrats' preference for moderation is the party’s recent electoral losses. Following the 2024 election, Republicans took control of both the presidency and Senate, while maintaining a slim majority in the House of Representatives.\n\nFILE - Democratic leaders, including Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer, gather for a press conference at the U.S. Capitol. (Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)\n\nIn contrast, Republican satisfaction with their party's ideology may be a reflection of their support for Trump and the conservative policies his administration has begun enacting.\n\nHow views differ within each party\n\nBy the numbers:\n\nGallup's findings also reveal ideological divisions within both parties:\n\nLiberal Democrats (49% of Democrats overall) mostly want the party to be more liberal (45%) or remain the same (22%).\n\nModerate Democrats (43% of Democrats) overwhelmingly prefer a shift to the center (62%).\n\nConservative Republicans (two-thirds of GOP voters) are split: 45% favor the status quo, while 38% want a more conservative GOP.\n\nModerate Republicans are more likely to favor a centrist shift (50%), rather than staying the same (36%).\n\nThese divisions suggest that while moderate Democrats increasingly want their party to move to the center, moderate Republicans are somewhat less eager for change.\n\nWhat this means for the future\n\nThe Democratic Party's shift toward moderation could influence its strategy heading into the 2026 midterms. The party may seek to regain voter support by focusing on more centrist policies and appealing to swing voters.\n\nMeanwhile, the Republican Party appears to be more united in its current direction, with Trump maintaining strong support among GOP voters.\n\nAs both parties look ahead to future elections, their ideological shifts could play a key role in shaping the political landscape for years to come.",

After driving at least an hour, he crashed into a utility pole in a southern Delaware town, and attempted to run, but was caught by troopers.\n\n\n\nA West Chester man led Delaware State Police on a pursuit that stretched across a majority of the state, crossing through many jurisdictions, covering at least 45 miles, before crashing, attempting to run, but ultimately caught by troopers.\n\nThe chase began after New Castle County Police tried to pull him over due to a bare rim on the car he was driving.\n\nWhat we know:\n\nFriday afternoon, about 12:45, officials with Delaware State Police said troopers were contacted, saying New Castle County Police were pursuing a man driving a BMW with a Pennsylvania tag and driving on a bare rim.\n\nTroopers joined the pursuit after the driver, later identified as 22-year-old West Chester resident Thomas Casey, was seen heading south into Middletown, Delaware, on State Route 1.\n\nTimeline:\n\nAs the chase continued, parts of the BMW began to disengage from the vehicle, hurtling into the air. An unidentified metal object struck the hood of a DSP vehicle, tearing into the hood.\n\nNext, the metal brake caliper separated from the car and crashed into the windshield of a different DSP vehicle, almost hitting the trooper inside.\n\nAs they approached Dover, officials say Casey began to speed up. About 12 miles south of Dover, a trooper tried to lay down traffic spikes, Casey saw them in enough time to swerve, nearly hitting the trooper standing there. The trooper ran out of the way of the vehicle to avoid being hit.\n\nAnother attempt at traffic spikes was made a short time later, but with the same results, as Casey swerved towards the trooper, who also had to jump out of the way to avoid being hit.\n\nDig deeper:\n\nCasey then merged onto Exit 86 toward Frederica, and as he did so, he hit a traffic sign and crashed into a utility pole in front of a local store.\n\nHe jumped out of the disabled vehicle and tried to make a run for it, but troopers grabbed him before he could elude them.\n\nHe then resisted, officials said, causing minor injuries to the troopers.\n\nBig picture view:\n\nOfficials said the troopers noticed Casey showed continued signs of impairment.\n\nHe was taken to a nearby barracks and a legal blood test was performed.\n\nCasey was then charged with assault, reckless endanger, resisting arrest with force, driving under the influence of a drug and other related offenses.\n\nHe is being held at the Sussex Correctional Institution on a $50,877 cash bond.",
