        "content": "Moving to fulfill a campaign promise, President Donald Trump is set to sign an executive order Thursday calling for the shutdown of the Education Department, an agency Republicans have talked about closing for decades.\n\nThe White House says Education Secretary Linda McMahon will be directed to facilitate the department's closure while \"continuing to ensure the effective and uninterrupted delivery of services, programs, and benefits on which Americans rely.”\n\nEliminating the department altogether would be a cumbersome task, which likely would require an act of Congress.\n\nIn the weeks since he took office, the Trump administration already has cut the department's staff in half and overhauled much of the department’s work. Trump adviser Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency has cut dozens of contracts it dismissed as “woke” and wasteful. It gutted the Institute of Education Sciences, which gathers data on the nation’s academic progress.\n\nGet top local stories in Philly delivered to you every morning. Sign up for NBC Philadelphia's News Headlines newsletter.\n\nThe agency's main role is financial. Annually, it distributes billions in federal money to colleges and schools and manages the federal student loan portfolio. Closing the department would mean redistributing each of those duties to another agency. The Education Department also plays an important regulatory role in services for students, ranging from those with disabilities to low-income and homeless kids.\n\nIndeed, federal education money is central to Trump's plans for colleges and schools. Trump has vowed to cut off federal money for schools and colleges that push \"critical race theory, transgender insanity, and other inappropriate racial, sexual or political content\" and to reward states and schools that end teacher tenure and support universal school choice programs.\n\nFederal funding makes up a relatively small portion of public school budgets — roughly 14%. Colleges and universities are more reliant on it, through research grants along with federal financial aid that helps students pay their tuition.\n\nHere is a look at some of the department's key functions, and how Trump has said he might approach them.\n\nStudent loans and financial aid\n\nThe Education Department manages approximately $1.5 trillion in student loan debt for over 40 million borrowers. It also oversees the Pell Grant, which provides aid to students below a certain income threshold, and administers the Free Application for Federal Student Aid ( FAFSA ), which universities use to allocate financial aid.\n\nPresident Joe Biden's administration made cancellation of student loans a signature effort of the department's work. Even though Biden’s initial attempt to cancel student loans was overturned by the Supreme Court, the administration forgave over $175 billion for more than 4.8 million borrowers through a range of changes to programs it administers, such as Public Service Loan Forgiveness.\n\nThe loan forgiveness efforts have faced Republican pushback, including litigation from several GOP-led states.\n\nTrump has criticized Biden's efforts to cancel debt as illegal and unfair, calling it a “total catastrophe” that “taunted young people.” Trump's plan for student debt is uncertain: He has not put out detailed plans.\n\nCivil rights enforcement\n\nThrough its Office for Civil Rights, the Education Department conducts investigations and issues guidance on how civil rights laws should be applied, such as for LGBTQ+ students and students of color. The office also oversees a large data collection project that tracks disparities in resources, course access and discipline for students of different racial and socioeconomic groups.\n\nTrump has suggested a different interpretation of the office's civil rights role. Under his administration, the department has instructed the office to prioritize complaints of antisemitism above all else and has opened investigations into colleges and school sports leagues for allowing transgender athletes to compete on women’s teams.\n\nIn his campaign platform, Trump said he would pursue civil rights cases to “stop schools from discriminating on the basis of race.” He has described diversity and equity policies in education as “explicit unlawful discrimination.” His administration has launched investigations of dozens of colleges for alleged racial discrimination.\n\nTrump also has pledged to exclude transgender students from Title IX protections, which affect school policies on students’ use of pronouns, bathrooms and locker rooms. Originally passed in 1972, Title IX was first used as a women’s rights law. Last year, Biden’s administration said the law forbids discrimination based on gender identity and sexual orientation, but a federal judge undid those protections.\n\nCollege accreditation\n\nWhile the Education Department does not directly accredit colleges and universities, it oversees the system by reviewing all federally recognized accrediting agencies. Institutions of higher education must be accredited to gain access to federal money for student financial aid.\n\nAccreditation came under scrutiny from conservatives in 2022, when the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools questioned political interference at Florida public colleges and universities. Trump has said he would fire “radical left accreditors” and take applications for new accreditors that would uphold standards including “defending the American tradition” and removing “Marxist” diversity administrators.\n\nAlthough the education secretary has the authority to terminate its relationship with individual accrediting agencies, it is an arduous process that has rarely been pursued. Under President Barack Obama, the department took steps to cancel accreditors for a now-defunct for-profit college chain, but the Trump administration blocked the move. The group, the Accrediting Council for Independent Colleges and Schools, was terminated by the Biden administration in 2022.\n\nMoney for schools\n\nMuch of the Education Department's money for K-12 schools goes through large federal programs, such as Title I for low-income schools and the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. Those programs support services for students with disabilities, lower class sizes with additional teaching positions, and pay for social workers and other non-teaching roles in schools.\n\nDuring his campaign, Trump called for shifting those functions to the states. He has not offered details on how the agency's core functions of sending federal money to local districts and schools would be handled.\n\nThe Heritage Foundation's Project 2025, a sweeping proposal outlining a far-right vision for the country, offered a blueprint. It suggested sending oversight of programs for kids with disabilities and low-income children first to the Department of Health and Human Services, before eventually phasing out the funding and converting it to no-strings-attached grants to states.\n\n___\n\nThe Associated Press’ education coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

        "content": "Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis’ political operation is making calls to state lobbyists, urging them not to support Rep. Byron Donalds, R-Fla., whose 2026 bid for governor has already socked away more than $3 million — much of which has come from President Donald Trump’s donors.\n\nThe calls, according to seven people familiar with the effort who requested anonymity to speak freely, are attempts to curb any potential contributions from mostly Tallahassee-based lobbyists to Donalds’ campaign.\n\nThe southwest Florida congressman announced his Trump-backed bid for governor last month, but there remains the prospect that DeSantis’ wife, Casey, also jumps in the race, which would set up a heavyweight GOP primary and continue the long-running political proxy war between Trump and DeSantis.\n\n“They are becoming a lot more aggressive as this thing progresses,” a veteran Republican lobbyist who received one of the calls said. “There are no threats or anything direct like that, but come on. When you get a call from the governor, or anyone around them, in this sort of context, it’s a message-sender.”\n\nGet top local stories in Philly delivered to you every morning. Sign up for NBC Philadelphia's News Headlines newsletter.\n\nThe calls come as Florida is three weeks into its state legislative session, a time when the same lobbyists DeSantis is urging to not support Donalds need the governor to sign bills into law for their clients.\n\n“There is a tension among many as they try to toe the line — signaling they are with Donalds, as many will, without incurring DeSantis’ wrath,” another longtime Republican Florida lobbyist said.\n\n“A term we keep hearing is ‘keep your powder dry,” the person said of how the request to not donate to Donalds is being framed.\n\nBoth DeSantis and Taryn Fenske, one of his top political staffers, have made some of the calls, according to one of the sources familiar. Fenske did not return a request seeking comment.\n\nCasey DeSantis has not yet said if she plans to formally run for governor in 2026, but her husband has increasingly hyped her as a key part of his administration’s success, and she has done nothing to publicly swat down the idea of a campaign when asked about it by reporters.\n\n“When you come to a fork in the road, take it,” she said last month, borrowing a cryptic turn of phrase from baseball legend Yogi Berra.\n\nNBC News reported last month that Casey was seriously considering a run to replace her husband. A spokeswoman for DeSantis’ political operation did not return a request seeking comment.\n\nDeSantis in the past has relied on a pressure campaign of Tallahassee lobbyists to help fund his political ambitions. During the 2024 presidential contest, his former chief of staff James Uthmeier _ who is now the state's attorney general — organized government staffers to solicit contributions for DeSantis’ campaign from lobbyists, a highly unusual arrangement.\n\nThis time, there are no taxpayer-funded staff involved in the efforts.\n\nThough supporters of both sides of the potential GOP primary have aggressively attacked the other candidate on social media, outside of some early tension, neither side has really addressed the other. When asked, Donalds has praised the job DeSantis has done as governor.\n\nDonalds has quickly amassed a $3.1 million state-level war chest, bolstered by $1.2 million in transfers from his federal congressional account and some notable donors from Trump’s fundraising network, according to public records. Illinois billionaire Richard Uihlein has contributed $1 million; Clive Fields, a Texas-based health care executive who was a DeSantis donor in the 2024 presidential primary before supporting Trump, donated $500,000; and Deborah Magowan, the widow of former San Francisco Giants owner Peter Magowan, kicked in $150,000.\n\nIn addition, Donalds continues to have a separate federal super PAC called Sunshine State Future Fund, which has been relatively dormant, according to campaign finance records, but it has not had to disclose any contributions yet this year.\n\nFlorida election law generally allows federal super PACs to transfer money to benefit state candidate-aligned political committees, meaning it can offer a more covert way for donors to give to Donalds without the contribution immediately becoming public. The next quarterly super PAC filing deadline is not until April 15.\n\nMeanwhile, a state-level political committee associated with DeSantis’ political operation has $2.1 million cash on hand, according to state campaign finance records.\n\nDonalds and DeSantis were once close political allies, but they had a falling-out when Donalds endorsed Trump in the 2024 Republican presidential primary.\n\nDeSantis has so far publicly framed his wife’s potential bid to replace him as a way to maintain and build on their family legacy in the state’s governor mansion.\n\n“She’s somebody that has, I think, the intestinal fortitude and the dedication to conservative principles,” DeSantis told reporters last month of his wife. “Anything we have accomplished, she’d be able to take to the next level.”\n\nThis story first appeared on NBCNews.com.

Sign up for NBC Philadelphia's News Headlines newsletter.\n\nNBC News spoke to six Tesla owners or their representatives who confirmed that at least some information on the website was accurate, though other owners said that in some cases phone numbers or addresses were out of date.\n\nOn Tuesday, someone armed with a gun and Molotov cocktails attacked a Tesla service center in Las Vegas, spray-painting “resist,” firing several shots and torching multiple cars, authorities said. It’s not clear whether the map was tied to the incident.\n\nThe website is causing concern among some Tesla owners who fear they or their vehicles could be attacked.\n\n“Having our personal addresses out there is not something that I think is cool,” said a San Diego Tesla owner named Scott. His family owns two Teslas, and he asked that his name be withheld to prevent harassment. He said they bought the vehicles years ago, before Musk’s alliance with President Donald Trump, and that it didn’t make financial sense to sell them now.\n\n“I think there’s much more effective ways to protest than attacking individuals’ property,” he said.\n\nSome other Tesla owners said they weren’t particularly concerned about the site. One said the information listed about them was out of date, and another said personal information had become ubiquitous online anyway.\n\nThe site pushes Tesla owners to join the trend of people selling their vehicles so they can disassociate from Musk. The site says it will take down owners’ personal information if they provide “proof that you’ve sold your Tesla.”\n\nTesla didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment Wednesday.In a post on X, it advised owners to turn on “sentry mode,” which allows owners to see and record live video from their vehicles’ cameras.\n\nThe site, called “Dogequest,” refers to Musk’s work for Trump as head of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Musk has used the position to try to slash federal spending and reorganize whole federal agencies, leading to repeated clashes not only in the federal courts and with Congress but also within the Trump Cabinet. On Tuesday, a federal judge ruled that Musk’s shutdown of the U.S. Agency for International Development “likely violated the United States Constitution in multiple ways,” a decision that Musk attacked as wrong.\n\nThe Department of Government Efficiency, commonly known as DOGE, is an initiative led by Elon Musk with a goal to ”maximize governmental efficiency and productivity.”\n\nThe map included only a small fraction of all Tesla owners, listing only a handful in some cities where Teslas are relatively common, such as San Francisco.\n\nIt’s not clear who is behind the online map or where they obtained the data they posted. The creators didn’t respond to an email sent to an address listed on the website requesting further information or comment.\n\nDomain registration records for the website indicated it was registered via an anonymous domain hosting platform called Njalla Okta LLC.\n\nThe map was released following a rise in vandalism against Tesla. Aside from the Las Vegas incident, other reported attacks have involved charging stations in the Boston area and more Molotov cocktails thrown at a dealership in Colorado. On Monday, the San Diego County Sheriff’s Office reported that swastikas were painted on multiple Teslas at a dealership.\n\nAttorney General Pam Bondi has said the attacks on Tesla property are “nothing short of domestic terrorism” and pledged federal investigations.\n\nThe Justice Department and the FBI didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment about the map.\n\nHere are five things to know about Elon Musk.\n\nThis story first appeared on NBCNews.com.

        "content": "The Trump administration and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Wednesday that Ukraine has agreed to move forward with a partial ceasefire with Russia, which President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin had discussed a day earlier.\n\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio and Trump national security adviser Mike Waltz said that after Trump spoke to Zelenskyy by phone Wednesday morning, the two leaders agreed \"on a partial ceasefire against energy,\" according to a joint statement released by the White House.\n\nZelenskyy wrote in a lengthy post on X, \"One of the first steps toward fully ending the war could be ending strikes on energy and other civilian infrastructure. I supported this step, and Ukraine confirmed that we are ready to implement it.\"\n\nRubio and Waltz's statement, however, did not mention that the ceasefire would apply to civilian infrastructure as Zelenskyy suggested, and White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt refused to answer questions at an afternoon White House news briefing asking for clarification about the discrepancy in details.\n\nGet top local stories in Philly delivered to you every morning. Sign up for NBC Philadelphia's News Headlines newsletter.\n\nLeavitt also dodged a question about whether Trump is still considering ramping up U.S. sanctions on Russia.\n\nAsked whether the possible minerals deal between the U.S. and Ukraine was still on the table, Leavitt suggested that both sides have moved on from it because now the conflict is advancing toward a potential longer-term peace agreement.\n\nThe White House also rejected Kremlin demands that the U.S. stop sending intelligence and weapons to Ukraine. Leavitt said Wednesday said all intelligence sharing between the U.S. and Ukraine will continue.\n\nThese developments came after Moscow and Kyiv accused each other of air attacks on civilian targets and infrastructure overnight, less than 24 hours after Putin told Trump that he would halt attacks on Ukraine's energy system for 30 days.\n\nZelenskyy said in his statement that he and Trump have instructed their teams \"to resolve technical issues related to implementing and expanding the partial ceasefire\" and will meet in the coming days in Saudi Arabia to \"continue coordinating steps toward peace.\"\n\nAccording to Rubio and Waltz, Zelenskyy asked Trump for the U.S. to provide additional air defense systems to protect civilians in Ukraine, including Patriot missile systems.\n\n\"President Trump agreed to work with him to find what was available, particularly in Europe,\" the two officials said in their statement.\n\nRubio and Waltz said Trump and Zelenskyy also discussed Ukraine's electrical supply and nuclear power plants. Trump said \"the United States could be very helpful in running those plants with its electricity and utility expertise. American ownership of those plants would be the best protection for that infrastructure and support for Ukrainian energy infrastructure,\" the secretary of state and national security adviser said.\n\nSearchlights in the sky over Kyiv as Russian drones strike Tuesday. (Gleb Garanich / Reuters)\n\nTheir statement also said Trump fully briefed Zelenskyy on his call with Putin on Tuesday, and he and Zelenskyy \"reviewed the situation in Kursk and agreed to share information closely between their defense staff as the battlefield situation evolved.\"\n\nThe statement noted several times that Zelenskyy thanked Trump for his leadership and expressed gratitude for the administration's support provided to Ukraine. Zelenskyy clashed with Trump and Vice President JD Vance during a meeting in the Oval Office late last month, in which the president and vice president chastised Zelenskyy for not doing enough to thank the U.S.\n\nWednesday morning, Trump said in a post on Truth Social that he and Zelenskyy had a “very good telephone call,” which lasted about an hour. Trump said much of their discussion was “based on the call made yesterday with President Putin in order to align both Russia and Ukraine in terms of their requests and needs.”\n\n“We are very much on track, and I will ask Secretary of State Marco Rubio, and National Security Advisor Michael Waltz, to give an accurate description of the points discussed,” Trump wrote.\n\nIn a long phone call with Trump on Tuesday, Putin declined to endorse a 30-day ceasefire endorsed by Trump and accepted by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. But, according to a Kremlin readout of their conversation Tuesday, Putin did agree “to mutually refrain from strikes on energy infrastructure for 30 days.”\n\nThis differed slightly from Trump's post on Truth Social and a White House readout which said Russia had agreed to an “energy and infrastructure” ceasefire.\n\nWatch the heated exchange between Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, U.S. President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance in the Oval Office.\n\nAt a news conference on Wednesday, Zelenskyy said, “Putin’s words are very, very different from reality,” adding that around 120 strike drones and six missiles struck Ukraine, including its energy facilities, overnight. These came, he said, after Putin “gave the order” to stop attacking Ukraine’s “energy sector.”\n\nIn earlier comments late Tuesday, Zelenskyy said Russia fired dozens of Iranian-made Shahed drones at “civilian infrastructure” in several regions across Ukraine and that one had hit a hospital in the city of Sumy, in the country’s northeast.\n\n“It is precisely such night attacks by Russia that destroy our energy, our infrastructure, the normal life of Ukrainians,” Zelenskyy said. “And the fact that this night was no exception shows that we must continue to put pressure on Russia for the sake of peace.”\n\nUkrZaliznytsia, Ukraine’s national railway company, said Wednesday that Russia “struck the railway power system” in the eastern Dnipropetrovsk region with drones.\n\nUkraine's air force said that it shot down 72 drones overnight and that Russia had also launched at least two ballistic missiles.\n\nRussian authorities accused Ukraine of launching drones and said an oil depot had caught fire because of crashed debris in the southwestern city of Krasnodar.\n\n“The pipeline between the tanks was damaged,” the region’s emergency headquarters said in a statement early Wednesday. “The automatic fire extinguishing and cooling system was engaged,” the statement read, adding there were no casualties.\n\nLater, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov accused Ukraine of trying to sabotage the agreements made by Trump and Putin with the attacks on Krasnodar. He added that the leaders understood each other.\n\nIt is unclear if both Kyiv and Moscow intended to strike energy targets.\n\nStill, despite the verbal agreement on the limited ceasefire by Putin, Ukrainians near the front line appear to have no faith in his word.\n\nOutside of Kharkiv in eastern Ukraine, in a mobile command center that his team built, Ivan Kravchenko, a sergeant in the Reconnaissance Battalion of the 92nd Assault Brigade, told NBC News that “Russia wants to play its game and they are interested in the truce only in order to increase their military power.”\n\nHis unit commander, Leonid Maslov, who worked as a tax lawyer before the war, agreed.\n\n“Putin is trying to deceive everybody because he thinks he is a master of spy games and deceit,” Maslov said, as he sat in front of a monitor a nearby safehouse, showing their operation in real time with a Russian mortar position being attacked by Ukrainian bombs.\n\n\"Nobody can trust him,\" Maslov said of Putin.\n\nRichard Engel and Gabe Joselow reported from Kharkiv.

        "content": "Change is (potentially) on the horizon.\n\nNFL teams have made their pitches for new rules for the upcoming season, with three proposals set to be voted on at the annual league meeting from March 30 to April 2.\n\nProposals need approval by 24 of the 32 owners to pass, and we should know the results of the vote by the end of the meetings in Palm Beach, Florida.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the three new rule proposals:\n\nGet top local stories in Philly delivered to you every morning. Sign up for NBC Philadelphia's News Headlines newsletter.\n\n1. Banning the tush push\n\nThe Green Bay Packers proposed banning the play that the Philadelphia Eagles have perfected.\n\nHere's how the Packers intend to outlaw the famous \"Brotherly Shove\" that the Eagles rode to a Super Bowl win:\n\n\"To prohibit an offensive player from pushing a teammate who was lined up directly behind the snapper and receives the snap, immediately at the snap,\" the proposal says.\n\n2. Penalty change for defensive holding and illegal contact\n\nThe Detroit Lions proposed a less harsh penalty for defensive holding and illegal contact.\n\nBoth penalties are currently five yards and an automatic first down. Under the proposal, it would still be five yards but not an automatic first down.\n\nSo, for example, if there's a defensive holding on a third-and-10, the teams would replay the down as a third-and-5 rather than a first-and-10.\n\n3. Regular season overtime rules\n\nThe Eagles proposed changing the regular season overtime rules.\n\nUnder the change, both teams would be guaranteed a possession on offense -- the same rules that are used in overtime for the postseason.\n\nThis would make overtime rules similar for both regular season and playoff games, with both teams possessing the ball in a 15-minute period. This wouldn't eliminate ties, though -- games that are still knotted after 15 minutes would end in the regular season. In the playoffs, teams play further overtime periods until a tie is broken.",

The music was stored on password-protected hard drives kept in a safe at Eminem's studio in Ferndale, a Detroit suburb, according to an FBI affidavit.\n\nJoseph Strange, 46, of Holly, Michigan, was charged via a criminal complaint with copyright infringement and interstate transportation of stolen goods, Acting U.S. Attorney Julie Beck in Detroit said. Strange, who lost his job at Eminem's studio in 2021, could face up to 15 years in prison if convicted of both counts.\n\nStrange's attorney, Wade Fink, said in a text to The Associated Press that Strange is a married father of two “with decades of dedication to the music industry.″ He called the charges “untested allegations” that haven't been vetted by a grand jury or a judge.\n\nGet top local stories in Philly delivered to you every morning.

He said he raised the money from a group of fans of Eminem, whose real name is Marshall Mathers III.\n\nStrange also was trying to sell some of Eminem's handwritten lyric sheets, Doja Rat said.\n\nAnother group of fans organized by someone in Connecticut using the screen name ATL also purchased a “couple” of songs from Strange for about $1,000, according to the affidavit.\n\nAn FBI search of Strange's home in January turned up numerous handwritten Eminem lyric sheets and notes; a VHS tape of an unreleased Eminem video; and hard drives with 12,000 audio files. Some of the files contained music in various stages of development by Eminem and unidentified artists working with him, according to the affidavit.\n\nEminem won for best hip-hop act at the 2024 MTV EMAs and was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in 2022.\n\nThe affidavit notes that Strange signed an agreement as part of his severance package that specifically prohibited him from electronically circulating Eminem's work.\n\n“Protecting intellectual property from thieves is critical in safeguarding the exclusive rights of creators and protecting their original work from reproduction and distribution by individuals who seek to profit from the creative output of others,” Beck said in a news release.",

        "content": "President Donald Trump plans to sign an executive order Thursday calling for the shutdown of the U.S. Education Department, according to a White House official, advancing a campaign promise to eliminate an agency that's been a longtime target of conservatives.\n\nThe official spoke on the condition of anonymity before an announcement.\n\nTrump has derided the Department of Education as wasteful and polluted by liberal ideology. However, finalizing its dismantling is likely impossible without an act of Congress, which created the department in 1979.\n\nA White House fact sheet said the order would direct Secretary Linda McMahon “to take all necessary steps to facilitate the closure (of) the Department of Education and return education authority to the States, while continuing to ensure the effective and uninterrupted delivery of services, programs, and benefits on which Americans rely.”\n\nGet top local stories in Philly delivered to you every morning. Sign up for NBC Philadelphia's News Headlines newsletter.\n\nHere are five things to know about former wrestling executive Linda McMahon.\n\nThe Trump administration has already been gutting the agency. Its workforce is being slashed in half and there have been deep cuts to the Office for Civil Rights and the Institute of Education Sciences, which gathers data on the nation’s academic progress.\n\nAdvocates for public schools said eliminating the department would leave children behind in an American education system that is fundamentally unequal.\n\n“This isn’t fixing education. It’s making sure millions of children never get a fair shot. And we’re not about to let that happen without a fight,” the National Parents Union said in a statement.\n\nThe White House has not spelled out formally which department functions could be handed off to other departments, or eliminated altogether. At her confirmation hearing, McMahon said she would preserve core initiatives, including Title I money for low-income schools and Pell grants for low-income college students. The goal of the administration, she said, would be \"a better functioning Department of Education.”\n\nThe department sends billions of dollars a year to schools and oversees $1.6 trillion in federal student loans.\n\nCurrently, much of the agency’s work revolves around managing money — both its extensive student loan portfolio and a range of aid programs for colleges and school districts, from school meals to support for homeless students. The agency also plays a significant role in overseeing civil rights enforcement.\n\nFederal funding makes up a relatively small portion of public school budgets — roughly 14%. The money often supports supplemental programs for vulnerable students, such as the McKinney-Vento program for homeless students or Title I for low-income schools.\n\nColleges and universities are more reliant on money from Washington, through research grants along with federal financial aid that helps students pay their tuition.\n\nRepublicans have talked about closing the Education Department for decades, saying it wastes taxpayer money and inserts the federal government into decisions that should fall to states and schools. The idea has gained popularity recently as conservative parents’ groups demand more authority over their children’s schooling.\n\nIn his platform, Trump promised to close the department “and send it back to the states, where it belongs.” Trump has cast the department as a hotbed of “radicals, zealots and Marxists” who overextend their reach through guidance and regulation.\n\nAt the same time, Trump has leaned on the Education Department to promote elements of his agenda. He has used investigative powers of the Office for Civil Rights and the threat of withdrawing federal education funding to target schools and colleges that run afoul of his orders on transgender athletes participating in women's sports, pro-Palestinian activism and diversity programs.\n\nEven some of Trump’s allies have questioned his power to close the agency without action from Congress, and there are doubts about its political popularity. The House considered an amendment to close the agency in 2023, but 60 Republicans joined Democrats in opposing it.\n\nDuring Trump’s first term, former Education Secretary Betsy DeVos sought to dramatically reduce the agency’s budget and asked Congress to bundle all K-12 funding into block grants that give states more flexibility in how they spend federal money. It was rejected, with pushback from some Republicans.\n\nTwenty states and the District of Columbia announced a lawsuit against the Trump administration Thursday over its mass firings at the Department of Education.\n\nThe Associated Press’ education coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

They say their family members have been falsely accused and targeted because of their tattoos.\n\nThe families also said they never expected their loved ones to be sent to a massive prison in El Salvador instead of their home country, Venezuela.\n\nThe White House said in a statement Tuesday that it was “confident in DHS intelligence assessments on these gang affiliations and criminality,” adding that the Venezuelan immigrants who were removed from the United States had final orders of deportation.\n\nGet top local stories in Philly delivered to you every morning. Sign up for NBC Philadelphia's News Headlines newsletter.\n\n“This administration is not going to ignore the rule of law,” the statement said.\n\nRelatives of Mervin Yamarte, 29, said they were horrified to see him in a social media video showing men shackled as authorities dragged them from planes and shaved their heads in preparation to take them to prison.\n\nThe men were sent to the Terrorism Confinement Center, a lockup known for allegations of human rights abuses. Human rights organizations such as Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International have documented issues including extreme overcrowding and torture at the prison.\n\nThe video, released by Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele, claims the men were Venezuelan gang members deported from the United States.\n\nAnayel Miquelina, a relative of Yamarte’s, told Telemundo that Yamarte’s mother and wife were distraught when they saw him in the video with his shirt ripped and head shaved.\n\n“They fainted. They started screaming,” she said.\n\nThe Trump administration announced the deportations this weekend of hundreds of immigrants it alleged were members of the gang to El Salvador under the Alien Enemies Act, which allows the president to deport noncitizens during wartime.\n\nThe Alien Enemies Act is a rarely used 1798 law which allows the president to imprison and deport non-citizens in time of war. Here’s what you need to know.\n\nIn court documents, an official with Immigration and Customs Enforcement said Monday that many of those who were removed from the United States under the Alien Enemies Act “do not have criminal records in the United States.”\n\nThe official said that “the lack of specific information about each individual actually highlights the risk they pose” and that the government does not have a “complete profile” of alleged gang members who were deported to El Salvador.\n\nYamarte’s family said that he had an open asylum case with a hearing set for July and that he does not have a criminal record and was not connected to Tren de Aragua.\n\nA check of criminal records in the city of Irving, Dallas County and the state of Texas, as well as federal court records, by NBC News did not find any charges or convictions for Yamarte. The Department of Homeland Security did not respond to a request for more information on whether he had a criminal background.\n\n“We didn’t come to do harm to anybody. It’s not fair that because of a tattoo they involve us with a very crooked criminal gang,” said Juan Yamarte, his brother.\n\nJuan Yamarte said his brother has the same tattoo as a soccer player he admires and the number 99 — the number he has used as a member of a recreational soccer team. He also has tattoos of his mother’s and daughter’s names, as well as the date he and his partner began dating, another brother told Telemundo. None of his tattoos are gang-related, the family said.\n\nJuan Yamarte said his brother had been in the United States for more than a year before immigration officials took him last week at a home he shared with several other people.\n\n“They grabbed him. They cuffed him all at once when he said, ‘Why are you taking me, too, if I haven’t done anything?’” he said.\n\nOn Monday, Yamarte’s family and others in his hometown, Maracaibo, Venezuela, held a protest and a prayer vigil.\n\nSeveral other families told NBC News they believe they saw their relatives in the video released by El Salvador. They claim their loved ones have been falsely accused of having gang connections.\n\n“He is a good kid. He has never committed a crime; he doesn’t have a criminal record,” the sister of Fritzgeralth De Jesus, one of the Venezuelans she says was deported to El Salvador, said as she cried uncontrollably. “He is young, hard-working and an athlete.”\n\nDe Jesus’ sister, who asked not to be identified because of fear of deportation, said she received a call from her brother, who had been detained by ICE officials, on Saturday “to say goodbye” because he was going to be deported to Venezuela.\n\nShe grew increasingly worried when she did not hear from him, and she began to scour the internet hoping to find a clue to where he could be. She said she spotted him in Bukele’s video, which had gone viral on social media.\n\nDe Jesus, 25, entered the United States through the CBP One app in June, along with three other relatives, his sister said. The three family members were released into the United States right away, but De Jesus was sent to an immigration detention center in New Orleans, where he remained until he was deported, she said. It is unclear why De Jesus was detained; his family believes it may have been because of his tattoos.\n\n“They detained him just because he has tattoos,” De Jesus’ sister said. “From the beginning, they asked constantly about his tattoos. They would ask him if he was a member of the criminal gang, Tren de Aragua, and he always said no.”\n\nShe said none of her brother's tattoos are gang-affiliated. Some of the more prominent ones include rose art on his neck and arm, an angel on his chest and a tattoo that says “mom” on his chest.\n\nDe Jesus had left Venezuela because “colectivos,” armed paramilitary groups that support President Nicolás Maduro, were harassing and extorting him, his sister said.\n\nJoseph Giardina, an attorney based in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, who is representing De Jesus in his asylum case, was stunned to learn his client had been deported to El Salvador. The final hearing in his asylum case was scheduled for April 10.\n\nWhen Giardina heard De Jesus had been deported, he checked online and saw that his asylum hearing was still pending. He thought there must have been a mix-up.\n\n“With a pending asylum application and a trial, that would make absolutely no sense,” Giardina said. “I’ve been doing this for years. That’s not how it works.”\n\n“He has been in proceedings for months. The government has never filed an I-213, which would indicate any criminal background. They have never filed any evidence of any kind of criminal history,” Giardina said.\n\nMirelys Casique told Telemundo her family recognized her son, Francisco García Casique, in a photo released by the government of El Salvador. She said that while the man in the image was looking down, the family was able to identify him because of his tattoos.\n\n“He’s not a criminal. He has no criminal record,” she said, adding that if the government was going to deport her son, “they should send him back to his country of origin.”\n\nTrump invoked the Alien Enemies Act this weekend, and on Saturday, a federal judge issued a restraining order blocking him from using it to justify the deportations and ordered any planes that were already in the air to turn around.\n\nIn court documents, officials said three planes left the United States after Trump issued his proclamation, raising questions about the timing of the flights and the custody handover.\n\nA federal judge reviewing the case Tuesday asked the administration for further details about the flights and which immigrants were deported solely based on the Alien Enemies Act.\n\nThe Venezuelan government has since publicly condemned the detention of its citizens in El Salvador and issued a travel warning to those in the United States and those planning to travel abroad.\n\n“We are calling on the international community to stay alert against these practices that serve against human dignity and the principles of international rights,” Venezuela’s Foreign Affairs Ministry said in a statement Monday.\n\nThis story first appeared on NBCNews.com.

Sign up for NBC Philadelphia's News Headlines newsletter.\n\n“I probably wouldn't be up here right now,” B.G. said. “I promise you, I'd be begging to come on back one more (season). But I was happy to be able to make it back to play with my guys, to put that uniform on one last time in a big moment, big stage. To where we went out there and performed.”\n\nAfter missing the last six games of the regular season and the first three playoff games with that torn triceps, suffering against the Rams in L.A. in late November, Graham made it back on the field for the Super Bowl and played 13 snaps – 13 productive snaps – in the Eagles’ 40-22 win over the Chiefs.\n\nHe also tore his triceps again, although he’ll tell you it was well worth it to be part of the second championship of his career.\n\n“I felt like me being able to be a part of that, that was all I needed to know (to retire),” he said. “I felt like my prayers was answered being able to come back and be with them boys one last time.\n\n\"And I didn't know how it was gonna be, for real. I mean, we won and of course the competitor in me wanted to come back. But I know this, I couldn't ask for nothing sweeter than this. And I’m thankful to have come back and to be able to play my last game like my coach said with some integrity and play good, at that.\n\n“So I can always hang my hat on that where I played good in my last game, went out on my own terms and went out a champion.\"\n\nOne thing Graham is sure about is that even though his playing days are over, he’s not leaving football.\n\nHe doesn’t know exactly what his future will look like, but he does know he’ll be around the NovaCare Complex.\n\nDoing something.\n\nThe Eagles have a long history of hiring their former players in various roles working in the front office or scouting department, helping out the coaching staff or in a support role for players.\n\nAfter 15 years and two Lombardi trophies with the Eagles, Graham has a ton to offer.\n\n“I want to sit down and talk to Mr. (Jeff) Lurie, have some dinner with him and so we’re going to do that and figure out what I could do to be a part of what's going on,” he said. “Because I feel like we’ve got some good stuff brewing right now and I want to make sure that I can be a help in whatever it is that I do. And then, of course, I want to be creative on, I ain't got to be all in one basket, have everything all in one, but just kind of move around.\n\n“I don't want to just cold turkey leave the game, because I love it. I love just the intensity of it.”\n\nDoes the end of his playing career mean the end of his legendary track talking? No way.\n\n“Now I can send my goons out (to do it),” he said with a laugh. “I got a little different lingo I'm going to say to these guys on the field because of course I got to talk my stuff. I can't do nothing about it but I can send Nolan (Smith) out there to go do it.\n\n“I'm going to do it in practice, too. I'm going to be a part of something that they got going on where I can come in and even if I'm just coming to practice, I can always tell the offensive line what I would have done if I was still out there.”\n\nSubscribe to Eagle Eye anywhere you get your podcasts:\n\nApple Podcasts | YouTube Music | Spotify | Stitcher | Simplecast | RSS | Watch on YouTube",

It would take 24 of 32 votes to change the rule. pic.twitter.com/jlfFXlhINd — Dave Zangaro (@DZangaroNBCS) March 19, 2025\n\nGet top local stories in Philly delivered to you every morning. Sign up for NBC Philadelphia's News Headlines newsletter.\n\nNFL owners will vote on rule change proposals later this month in Palm Beach, Florida, at the annual league meetings. It would take 24 of 32 votes to change any rule. Last month at the NFL Combine, the sense was that this particular proposal wouldn’t have enough support, but we’ll see.\n\nThe proposal from Green Bay cites “player safety” and “pace of play.” But the NFL has released its data from the 2024 season, saying zero players were injured from the play in the last season. And without a legitimate player safety concern, it’s difficult to imagine the play in this form being banned.\n\nLast month, Eagles head coach Nick Sirianni spoke strongly about the Brotherly Shove.\n\n“I think when you look at that, because we've looked into that too, there weren’t a lot of injuries there,” Sirianni said. “I think that's a little made up, to be honest. Now the numbers will tell the truth, but I don't think there were many injuries with it this year.\n\n“I mean, I can't remember one injury we had on that play, and we ran it more than everybody else. And so, yeah, the injury numbers, the league will have that, and the injury numbers will come out on that, and I'm all for player safety, but I don't think that that play (is dangerous). I think that's just something that was said.”\n\nSirianni also said it’s insulting to hear the Tush Push called an “automatic play” because of how hard they have worked to perfect it. Other teams have not been nearly as successful with it.\n\nEagles propose a change\n\nThe Eagles have also proposed a rule change for the 2025 season that would extend the NFL’s overtime rules in the playoffs to the regular season, “by granting both teams an opportunity to possess the ball regardless of the outcome of the first possession, subject to a 15-minute overtime period in the regular season.”\n\nBasically, this rule would create a 15-minute overtime in the regular season with both teams given the chance to possess the ball even if the first team scores a touchdown.\n\nThis proposal has a chance to pass as NFL executive VP of football operations Troy Vincent has said the NFL’s competition committee agrees that OT rules need to be revamped.\n\nOther proposals\n\n• The Detroit Lions proposed a rule change that would eliminate automatic first downs for defensive holding or illegal contact, saying the current penalty enforcement is “too punitive for the defense.”\n\n• The Lions also proposed a bylaw change that would change the playoff seeding format to allow Wild Card teams to be seeded higher than division winners. For example, both NFC Wild Card teams in 2024 (Vikings, Commanders) had better records than the winners of the NFC South and NFC West.\n\n• The Lions were busy. They also proposed a bylaw change that would exclude players put on IR before or on the day of roster reduction to 53 from the 90-man roster unless the player is designated for return.\n\nSubscribe to Eagle Eye anywhere you get your podcasts:\n\nApple Podcasts | YouTube Music | Spotify | Stitcher | Simplecast | RSS | Watch on YouTube",

The San Jose State student has never publicly commented on the controversy or confirmed that she is transgender.\n\nA senior White House official told NBC News that the Trump administration paused the funds due to Thomas' participation, referring to Thomas as male and condemning her access to the locker room. However, the official said the federal funding pause is not the result of the Title IX investigation launched by the Education Department and that the funds were paused by the departments of Defense and Health and Human Services.\n\nThe official described the funding pause as an \"immediate proactive action to review discretionary funding streams to those universities.\" The official did not clarify what the discretionary funding is for or why it was being paused if not due to an alleged Title IX violation.\n\nTrump's executive order barring trans girls and women from participating in women's sports rolled back Biden administration guidance that required schools to allow trans students to access school sports teams and sex-segregated facilities that align with their gender identities. The order tasked the Education Department with investigating potential violations.\n\nWhite House officials told reporters at the time that the administration also planned to work with sports governing bodies, including the International Olympic Committee, to ensure the guidance is followed in noneducational settings.\n\nLast month, a judge allowed two trans students who filed a lawsuit against New Hampshire's law prohibiting trans girls from playing on female sports teams to expand their challenge to also include Trump's executive order.\n\nIn a speech on Wednesday, President Trump said his administration was putting every school receiving federal funding on notice that if they “let men take over women’s sports teams” they would “be investigated for violations of Title IX.”\n\nA federal judge in New Hampshire ruled last fall that the two girls could try out for their high school soccer and tennis teams while their lawsuit proceeds.\n\n“I love playing soccer and we had a great season last fall,” one of the plaintiffs, Parker Tirrell, who is in 10th grade, said in a statement last month. “I just want to go to school like other kids and keep playing the game I love.”\n\nChris Erchull, a senior staff attorney at GLBTQ Legal Advocates & Defenders, one of the groups representing the teens, said the Trump administration's executive orders targeting trans people \"amount to a coordinated campaign to prevent transgender people from functioning in society.\"\n\n“The systematic targeting of transgender people across American institutions is chilling, but targeting young people in schools, denying them support and essential opportunities during their most vulnerable years, is especially cruel,” Erchull said in a statement last month. “School sports are an important part of education—something no child should be denied simply because of who they are. Our clients Parker and Iris simply want to go to school, learn, and play on teams with their peers.”\n\nIn addition to his order pertaining to trans student athletes, Trump signed an order proclaiming that the government will recognize only two unchangeable sexes. He also signed orders barring trans people from serving openly in the military and restricting access to gender-affirming care for trans people younger than 19 nationwide. The last two orders have been temporarily blocked by courts.\n\nThis story first appeared on NBCNews.com. More from NBC News:",

        "content": "Workers at the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration this week experienced a kind of whiplash as the federal government tried to reinstate probationary employees who had been fired.\n\nMore than 600 NOAA workers were laid off more than two weeks ago, including some in public safety roles, such as scientists who issue tsunami alerts, hurricane-hunting flight directors and meteorologists in local forecast offices.\n\nBut Thursday, a U.S. district judge in Maryland issued a temporary restraining order, blocking (at least temporarily) the terminations of tens of thousands of workers across agencies and ordering them to be reinstated. The Trump administration said in court Monday that it had moved to reinstate about 24,000 workers affected by the widespread cuts to the federal government’s probationary workforce. (Probationary workers are typically in their first or second years of federal service, but the status also applies to some employees who were recently promoted or hired full-time after working as contractors.)\n\nIn a court filing, the Commerce Department confirmed that it had reinstated 791 workers, in total, across its agencies, including NOAA.\n\nGet top local stories in Philly delivered to you every morning. Sign up for NBC Philadelphia's News Headlines newsletter.\n\nThe reinstatements have added a new layer of confusion at NOAA, which had already halted several services because of staffing issues following the cuts. They included weather balloon launches in Albany, New York; Gray, Maine; and Kotzebue, Alaska, that are critical to support accurate forecasting. The agency also closed several offices.\n\nThe cuts came just weeks before a severe storm raced across the country, spawning tornadoes and killing at least 42 people. The National Weather Service, a division of NOAA, forecast the storm, issuing public alerts that it would be a “particularly dangerous event.”\n\nAlthough the probationary workers at NOAA have technically been reinstated, they were placed on administrative leave and have not been asked to return to work. So it is not immediately clear whether the services they previously contributed to would be restored.\n\nThe NOAA press office directed questions to the Commerce Department, which did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nAndy Hazelton, a hurricane modeling specialist with a doctorate who was laid off late last month, said he received an email Monday with a memorandum confirming he had been reinstated following the court action.\n\n“You will be reinstated to the Federal service and your previous position of record, retroactive to the effective date of your termination, and placed in a paid, non-duty status,” the memo said, adding that the situation would remain that way until the court case concludes or the department takes further action.\n\nIt offered few additional details, except that the Commerce Department “may revert your prior termination action to its original effective date” if a higher court invalidates the restraining order or if the department ultimately wins in court.\n\nHazelton said that as of Monday, he had received no additional communication and remained unsure whether he would receive back pay or eventually return to his duties.\n\nThe email brought temporary relief, he said, but confusion remains because he has also heard rumors that there may be additional cuts to the NOAA workforce through a reduction in force, or RIF.\n\n“I’m glad it might be a step toward getting our jobs back, but it’s still not clear it’s going to be permanent, and there’s still rumors about RIFs,” Hazelton said. “There’s a lot of uncertainty and more questions than answers.”\n\nIndeed, rumors have circulated widely about possible layoffs at NOAA. At a news conference last week held by Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., a member of the Appropriations subcommittee on Commerce and other programs, Rick Spinrad, the NOAA administrator during President Joe Biden’s administration, made some details of those rumors public.\n\n“NOAA was forced to identify an additional 1,029 positions” for potential termination, Spinrad said, adding that he had been told about the potential cuts by former colleagues still at the agency.\n\nDennis Jaszka, who worked as an investigative support technician for NOAA’s office of law enforcement before he was laid off, said he received an identical email to Hazelton’s.\n\nJaszka, 49, said he now feels “in complete limbo.”\n\nHe resents the implication that government workers are a drain on taxpayer resources and the statements President Donald Trump has made suggesting that they do not do good work, or any work at all.\n\n“It took me a lot of time to get this job, and then I finally get it, and then this administration comes in and says, basically, ‘You government workers are cockroaches.’ That’s not what they said, but it’s kind of the idea: ‘You just steal our tax money and you don’t do anything,’” Jaszka said.\n\nNow, after the court order, Jaszka pointed out, the government has instructed him outright not to report to duty.\n\n“‘We’re also willing to pay you not to come to work at all.’ It’s ridiculous,” he said. “Me and a lot of other people love our jobs. We came in believing in the mission of NOAA.”\n\nIn a court filing, the Commerce Department said it did not ask employees to return to full duty because that would be a burden on the agency and cause turmoil for terminated employees.\n\n“All employees offered reinstatement into full duty status would have to be onboarded again, including going through any applicable training, filling out human resources paperwork, obtaining new security badges, re-enrolling in benefits programs and payroll, reinstituting applicable security clearance actions, receiving government furnished equipment, and other requisite administrative actions,” Jessica Palatka, the department’s chief human capital officer, wrote in a court filing.\n\nShe added that an appellate court could also reverse the decision and leave employees “subjected to multiple changes in their employment status in a matter of weeks.”\n\nThis story first appeared on NBCNews.com.

        "content": "A Hollywood writer-director was arrested Tuesday on charges that he swindled $11 million from Netflix for a sci-fi show that never aired, instead steering the cash toward cryptocurrency investments and a series of lavish purchases that included a fleet of Rolls-Royces and a Ferrari.\n\nCarl Erik Rinsch — perhaps best known for directing the film “47 Ronin\" — has been charged with wire fraud and money laundering over what federal prosecutors allege was a scheme to defraud the streaming giant.\n\nProsecutors said Netflix had initially paid about $44 million to purchase an unfinished show called “White Horse\" from Rinsch, but eventually doled out another $11 million after he said he needed the additional cash to complete the show.\n\nRather than using the extra money to wrap up production, Rinsch quietly transferred the money to a personal brokerage account, where he made a series of failed investments that lost about half of the $11 million in two months, according to prosecutors.\n\nGet top local stories in Philly delivered to you every morning. Sign up for NBC Philadelphia's News Headlines newsletter.\n\nThe filmmaker then dumped the rest of the money into the cryptocurrency market, which proved to be a profitable move, with Rinsch eventually transferring the earnings into a personal bank account, according to an indictment.\n\nFrom there, Rinsch spent about $10 million on personal expenses and luxury items in a spending spree that, according to prosecutors, included about $1.8 million on credit card bills; $1 million on lawyers to sue Netflix for more money; $3.8 million on furniture and antiques; $2.4 million for five Rolls-Royces and one Ferrari; and $652,000 on watches and clothes.\n\nRinsch, 47, was arrested in West Hollywood, California, and had an initial court hearing on Tuesday.\n\nHe appeared in a federal courtroom in Los Angeles in a turtleneck sweater and jeans with shackles on his arms and legs. He did not enter a plea and spoke only to answer a judge’s questions. When asked if he’d read the indictment against him, he said “not cover to cover” but told the judge he understood the charges.\n\nU.S. Magistrate Judge Pedro V. Castillo ordered that he be released later Tuesday after he agreed to post a $100,000 bond to assure he’ll appear in court in New York, where his indictment was filed.\n\nHis newly appointed attorney, Annie Carney, declined to comment outside court. She said during the hearing that she had not yet seen the prosecution’s evidence against Rinsch. When discussing the terms of his release, she said, “the allegations in this case are purely financial.”\n\nRinsch's New York court date had not yet been set.\n\nNetflix declined to comment.",

        "content": "Jason Kelce and Fletcher Cox said good-bye a year ago and Brandon Graham said good-bye on Tuesday.\n\nLane Johnson is the last man standing from that group of Eagles legends who were all drafted between 2010 and 2013, but rest assured he has no plans to walk away from football any time soon.\n\nJohnson signed a one-year extension earlier this week, and he’s now under contract through 2027. If he plays through that deal, he'd match Graham’s franchise-record 15 seasons with the Eagles, and he’d be 37, which would make him the 2nd-oldest position player in franchise history, behind his mentor, Jason Peters.\n\nIs three more years possible?\n\nGet top local stories in Philly delivered to you every morning. Sign up for NBC Philadelphia's News Headlines newsletter.\n\n“Yeah, I mean it's very possible,” Johnson said Wednesday. “I think when you get to this stage of your career, you take it year by year, but physically I feel really good.\n\n“You know, a few years ago when I was coming back from all these (ankle) surgeries, I thought my body was going to start failing or going downhill. But I just think with the strength and conditioning program we have here and the stuff we do in the offseason, I feel really good.\n\n“So, yeah, as long as I'm feeling good and I feel like I can contribute, I think I'll continue to play. It's all I've really known. I just love my football family. I'm an only child, so my brothers are here and have always been in the locker room, and that's how I feel.”\n\nThis, of course, is incredible news.\n\nJohnson is the best right tackle in the NFL and while the Eagles had Cam Jurgens ready to take over for Kelce, Nolan Smith ready to take over for Graham and Jalen Carter ready to take over for Cox, it’s hard to imagine replacing Johnson.\n\nHe's one of only six offensive tackles in NFL history to make six Pro Bowls along with all-pro twice.\n\nAccording to Pro Football Focus data, Johnson has played over 3,000 regular-season pass-block snaps since 2019 and allowed five sacks and 10 quarterback hits.\n\nHis six Pro Bowls are 3rd-most by an Eagles offensive lineman – one fewer than Kelce and Peters – and along with Graham he’s one of only two position players in franchise history to win two Super Bowls.\n\nAnd he was as good this past season in his 12th season as he’s ever been.\n\n“As a younger player, I think I had to get stronger to deal with some of these bull rushes, especially from Ryan Kerrigan, after that I just really focused on what I need to attack each offseason as far as becoming a better player,” he said. “So year after year, I feel like I've progressed, but for me it's about being strong and then a lot of it's about being flexible, being able to bend. A lot of players as they age, they lose that ability to explode and to burst.\n\n“So when I look at athletes, you see what LeBron's doing, I've seen what some Olympic athletes have done. You know there's a guy out of Cuba, Mijaín López, that won his fifth gold medal at 41. So there are people that are able to go past the barriers or perceived barriers and I look to guys and athletes like that you know as inspiration and just to know that it's possible.”\n\nJohnson has started 158 regular-season games as an Eagle, so if he plays out this contract and stays healthy he could get to 200 starts. Only nine offensive linemen in history have started 200 games and only played for one team. Only one of them – Hall of Famer Gene Upshaw with the Raiders – won two Super Bowls.\n\nSo Johnson has a real opportunity to continue to etch his name into the record books and build on an already-formidable Hall of Fame resume.\n\n“Signed to play three more years and barring injuries or any of that, as long as my body's feeling good and I feel like I'm not regressing or becoming a shell of my former self, I could very well play three more years,” he said. “I love doing this.\n\n“But I think at every stage, especially when you get past 10, I think everybody looks and goes, ‘OK, where are we at?’ after each season. And then, if any decision is going to be made, it's definitely going to be a few months into the offseason. It's not this one.”\n\nWhen Johnson starts the 2025 season at right tackle, he’ll become the eighth player in franchise history to play 13 seasons in an Eagles uniform, joining B.G. (15 seasons), Chuck Bednarik (14) and Kelce, Brian Dawkins, Harold Carmichael, Bucko Kilroy and Vic Sears (13 each).\n\nHe's never been a free agent. The Eagles have always extended him before he got close.\n\n“I never wanted to go to another team,” he said. “The Eagles have always been here for me, good or bad. And so they've been pivotal in my development as a player and as a person off the field. And so, yeah, I couldn't be more excited about staying here.\n\n“It's very rare that a person can stay with one team 10-plus years. And my goal is to play well throughout my middle to late 30s, which I'm looking forward to.\n\n“I love the challenge of being an older player and the routine you've got to keep up with. I think that's what I love most about football, just the conflict and the constant trying to improve. I think the people that I'm in the building with have a similar type of mindset.\n\n“When you combine all these things, I think that's why we've had success here the past 10 years and I think why they're going to have success long after I'm gone. It's just the way they've done things here year after year.”\n\nSubscribe to Eagle Eye anywhere you get your podcasts:\n\nApple Podcasts | YouTube Music | Spotify | Stitcher | Simplecast | RSS | Watch on YouTube",

        "content": "PHILADELPHIA (WPVI) -- A Horsham, Pennsylvania, native is making hockey more accessible for the visually impaired.\n\nIn 2022, Kelsey McGuire founded Philadelphia Blind Hockey, the first and only blind hockey team in Philadelphia.\n\nCombining her background as a teacher of the visually impaired with her favorite sport, hockey became accessible to everyone. She trains all the coaches to understand each child's needs so they have the tools to make their experience seamless.\n\n\"This is how we accommodate this. This is how you're going to describe this skill, this drill,\" McGuire explains. \"So then they have a better idea of how to picture what they need to be doing, what their feet should feel like, where their body, where their head, where their shoulders need to be to be able to get them all up and moving.\"\n\nMissy Jones' son, Isaac, is a hockey player in the program. She feels so much joy when Isaac takes the ice.\n\n\"His coaches understand how to direct him based on things he'll understand,\" Jones said. \"It's been really great to see that he can excel at something, and feel good about himself, and build that confidence.\"\n\nMcGuire has built this program from the ground level. It's been a labor of love as she watches these athletes grow and evolve.\n\n\"It's a cool experience because all these kids have never skated before a day in their life,\" McGuire reflected. \"So to see them be so scared and wobbling all over the place, now they're doing drills, practicing. It's so cool to see in a short three years that huge change and difference.\"\n\nPhiladelphia Blind Hockey has become a community where kids and their families feel embraced.\n\n\"It's so nice because everyone has the same kind of baseline of understanding,\" Jones said. \"Our kids have some challenges, but we all want our kids to try, and do their best, and they don't have to be held back because of their challenges.\"\n\nThe program is set to compete for the first time this week at the Canadian National Blind Hockey Tournament. It's a milestone for Philadelphia Blind Hockey.",

That inquiry was announced last month immediately after President Donald Trump signed an executive order intended to ban transgender athletes from competing in girls and women's sports.\n\nBut the federal money was suspended in a separate review of discretionary federal money going to universities, the White House said. The money that was paused came from the Defense Department and the Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nRELATED: 'I am a woman': Transgender Penn swimmer Lia Thomas shares story in Sports Illustrated interview\n\n\"I'm a woman, so I belong on the women's team. Trans people deserve that same respect every other athlete gets,\" Thomas said.\n\nA Penn spokesperson said the school had not received any notification or details of the action.\n\n\"It is important to note, however, that Penn has always followed NCAA and Ivy League policies regarding student participation on athletic teams,\" spokesperson Ron Ozio said. \"We have been in the past, and remain today, in full compliance with the regulations that apply to not only Penn, but all of our NCAA and Ivy League peer institutions.\"\n\nThe investigation opened by the Education Department's Office for Civil Rights at Penn focuses on Lia Thomas, who swam on the school's women's team and was the first openly transgender athlete to win a Division I title in 2022.\n\nAt the time, the NCAA used a sport-by-sport approach to allowing transgender athletes to participate, deferring to an individual sport's national governing organization, international federation or prior established International Olympic Committee criteria.\n\nThomas competed under those guidelines, which allowed female transgender swimmers who had completed one year of hormone replacement therapy to compete.\n\nTrump's executive order on transgender athletes allows federal agencies to withhold funding if an entity does not follow the administration's interpretation of Title IX, which outlaws sex-based discrimination in schools and colleges. The order interprets \"sex\" as the gender someone was assigned at birth.\n\nThe NCAA changed its policy the day after the order was signed, ending its sport-by-sport practice in favor of a blanket policy that only allows athletes assigned female at birth to participate in women's sports.\n\nThe Education Department also opened reviews of San Jose State University volleyball and the Massachusetts Interscholastic Athletic Association.",

        "content": "Norristown middle school teacher accused of asking to kiss student on upcoming field trip\n\nNORRISTOWN, Pa. (WPVI) -- A middle school science teacher in Norristown, Pennsylvania, is facing charges after he allegedly requested to kiss an 8th-grade student during an upcoming field trip.\n\nJohn Richards, 57, of Newtown Square, turned himself in to police on Wednesday. He's facing charges of attempted institutional sexual assault, unlawful contact with a minor and other related offenses.\n\nAuthorities say they responded to Blockson Middle School on Monday after the 13-year-old student told her father about her interaction with her teacher.\n\nAccording to investigators, Richards called the victim to his desk at the back of the classroom to show her a typed message on his phone. The message reportedly indicated he wanted to kiss her two times during a trip Richards was chaperoning on Tuesday.\n\n\"I'm very nervous. If you say yes, I would like to kiss you at least 2 times in Washington. If you say no, that is ok, you're not any less beautiful. It is your decision and you can change your opinion when you want. You don't need to tell me now unless you know the answer,\" read a portion of the message, which was revealed in a criminal complaint.\n\nThe student immediately returned to her desk and called her father.\n\nDetective Stephen Sowell investigated the case and reviewed Richards' cellphone. According to the complaint, a second message was found to the girl, saying Richards wondered what her lips tasted like.\n\n\"Teachers are supposed to be trusted people, parents send their kids to school every day. You send your child there to be better, come back as a better person. You don't send your child there to be victimized,\" said Sowell.\n\nIn an interview with police, the victim revealed Richards had been looking at her and her friends \"strange\" and intimidating\" several days ago, the complaint alleges. Due to this behavior, other students reportedly encouraged the victim to record her interaction with Richards while at his desk.\n\nThe district notified parents about the teacher's arrest and said there are sufficient grounds to have him terminated.\n\nRichards is being held on $10,000 cash bail.\n\nA preliminary hearing is set for 10 a.m. on March 27.",

(WPVI) -- A controversial bill in Delaware on end-of-life options is moving forward in the state's legislature.\n\nIt allows some terminally ill residents the right to have a final say on their final moments.\n\nFor Wilmington resident Lynn Knothe, this is personal. Her father died from esophageal cancer.\n\n\"As he became ill, he really wanted to not put my mother, brother and myself through any suffering, and he didn't want to suffer,\" said Knothe.\n\nHer father's dying wish was to urge then-Governor John Carney to sign the legislation that passed both chambers last year.\n\nCarney vetoed it four days after Lynn's father's death last September.\n\nNow, for the 10th time, Delaware lawmakers are trying once again to get the bill passed. It would allow those who have a terminal illness and a prognosis of six months or less to live the option of a dignified death.\n\nThe person must have decision-making capacity and self-administer the medication once it's prescribed by a medical professional. It's something Lynn says her father would have used, had it been a legal option.\n\nGovernor Matt Meyer has signaled his support if the bill passes the Senate, saying in part, \"The option to choose that path should also be left up to doctors, patients, and their families, free from government interference.\"\n\nDelaware would become the 11th state in the nation with a so-called \"right to die bill.\"\n\nNew Jersey implemented its law in 2019, and in the first four years, 287 people opted for a dignified death.",

But the judge did not give Riibe his passport back, because he said it was not in his jurisdiction to hand over the passport. The judge did not specify whose jurisdiction it is to give the passport back.\n\n\"I can't go anywhere. And I really want to be able to go home, talk to my family, give them hugs, tell them I miss them,\" Riibe said in court on Tuesday. \"I understand I'm here to help, but it's been 10 days and I can't leave.\"\n\nA spokesperson at the State Department said on Wednesday the agency is \"aware of the situation\" and takes \"seriously our commitment to assist U.S. citizens abroad.\"\n\n\"There is no higher priority than the safety and security of U.S. citizens who are overseas. That matters to us,\" spokesperson Tammy Bruce said. \" [ Riibe's case ] is a situation where I can't discuss certainly specifics, but we know that the U.S. Embassy is in communication with him and his family and his lawyer, and we are providing consular assistance as well.\"\n\nRiibe said in court on Tuesday that he is \"ready to go home and go back to my life.\"\n\nAuthorities have said they believe Konanki died by drowning in Punta Cana early on March 6, officials told ABC News.\n\nRiibe, who met Konanki that night, told prosecutors the two went swimming and kissed in the ocean. The two were then hit by a wave and pulled into the ocean by the tide, according to a transcript provided to ABC News from two Dominican Republic sources.\n\nRiibe said he held Konanki and tried to get them out of the water. He said he tried to \"make sure she could breathe the entire time,\" which prevented Riibe from getting in enough air and he \"took in a lot of water.\"\n\nOnce they touched the sand, Riibe told prosecutors Konanki got up to get her belongings, but \"she was not out of the water since it was up to her knee\" and was \"walking at an angle in the water.\"\n\n\"The last time I saw her, I asked her if she was OK,\" he told prosecutors. \"I didn't hear her response because I began to vomit with all the water I had swallowed. After vomiting, I looked around and I didn't see anything. I thought she had taken her things and left.\"\n\nRiibe said he then passed out on a beach chair, woke up several hours later and returned to his hotel room.\n\nKonanki's family sent a formal request on Monday to Dominican police requesting they declare their daughter dead, according to two sources with knowledge of the investigation.\n\nOn Tuesday evening, Dominican Republic's Civil Defense said they are significantly scaling back the search-and-rescue efforts.\n\nThe judge will decide if Riibe will be charged with anything in a full ruling on March 28.\n\nABC News' Shannon Kingston contributed to this report.",

It would take 60 \"yes\" votes in the Senate to overcome the filibuster and dismantle the agency that Congress created.\n\nCritics argue the department is needed for vital financial assistance and grant programs. Education experts suggested that shuttering the Department of Education could gut public education funding and disproportionately affect high-need students across the country who rely on statutorily authorized programs, such as the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act and Title 1, which provides funding for low-income families.\n\nMcMahon said the agency will still administer those statutory programs that students from disadvantaged backgrounds rely on. In an interview on Fox News' \"The Ingraham Angle,\" McMahon suggested the \"good\" employees who administer the statutorily mandated functions will not be harmed in staff reductions.\n\nA statement from the department said it will \"continue to deliver on all statutory programs that fall under the agency's purview, including formula funding, student loans, Pell Grants, funding for special needs students, and competitive grantmaking.\"\n\nIn its more than four decades, Trump and Department of Education skeptics believe the agency has had too much spending power without achievement results.\n\nAfter McMahon was sworn in, she underscored that abolishing the agency is rooted in allowing families the right to choose a \"quality education\" so America's students aren't \"stuck in failing schools.\"",

        "source": "https://metrophiladelphia.com/",
        "content": "Young people hold up signs advocating for more action to address youth homelessness during a City Council hearing Wednesday, July 31, 2024.\n\nSign up for our Daily Email newsletter to stay up-to-date on the latest local news throughout Philadelphia.\n\nMere days after Mayor Cherelle Parker presented her budget proposal, nonprofit providers and young people involved in a School District of Philadelphia homelessness initiative gathered across the street from City Hall to advocate for funding.\n\nMoney for the initiative – a partnership between the district and Valley Youth House, Eddie’s House and HopePHL – runs out in June. The organizations are asking for $1.5 million annually over three years to continue identifying and assisting housing insecure students at dozens of schools.\n\n“We shouldn’t have to be here today,” said David Fair, co-chair of the Philly Homes 4 Youth Coalition, which has been pushing lawmakers to provide a permanent funding source for the partnership for years.\n\nThe program began at the beginning of the 2023-24 academic year, when district leaders contracted with the three nonprofits using $3 million in American Rescue Plan Act dollars specifically earmarked for homeless young people.\n\nAfter that funding was exhausted, and following a similar advocacy campaign, the Board of Education approved $2.3 million in one-time spending to keep the initiative going through the end of the current school year.\n\nDuring a panel discussion Tuesday, Diego, 21, said Valley Youth House helped him find a place to live and enroll in the Job Corps. Program participants requested that their last names not be published.\n\n“I thought I could never achieve anything because I was going through that homelessness,” he said. “I feel better about myself achieving certain goals.”\n\nJada, a 24-year-old mom, recounted how she faced homelessness due to a domestic violence situation. Eddie’s House guided her through enrolling in school – she never received a diploma – and covered the security deposit for her new home.\n\n“I don’t have no family,” Jada added. “So when I’m going through stuff, I call the Eddie’s House staff.”\n\nStaff from City Council and the Mayor’s Office attended Tuesday’s event, which was billed as a housing symposium and held at the Philadelphia Health Management Corporation’s Centre Square conference room.\n\n“Every year, we’re in constant negotiations as it relates to city budgets, school district budgets, state budgets, federal budgets, and far too often, issues related to young people are brushed under the rug,” Councilmember Isaiah Thomas told the crowd. “It’s not just homelessness; it’s young people in general.”\n\nEach of the three agencies operates their program slightly differently, although all provide a suite of on-site services, including case management, housing assistance, counseling, eviction prevention and help with uniforms and transportation.\n\nProviders described the work as a mix of intervention and prevention. Unlike most homeless services programs, the partnership also serves young people who are “doubled up” or “couch surfing.”\n\nWhile the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development does not define those types of arrangements as being homeless, the McKinney–Vento Homeless Assistance Act does count students in those situations.\n\nMcKinney-Vento requires school districts nationwide to identify and remove barriers facing homeless young people through age 21. The nonprofits say the partnership has helped the district fulfill those obligations.\n\nCombined, the three programs have served a total of 2,000 students and helped 200 households resolve their housing crises since launching less than two years ago, representatives from the organizations said.\n\nMore than 10,000 students were identified through the district’s homelessness office in 2023, the most recent year for which finalized data is available. That represented a 19% increase from the year prior. About 80% of the young people were classified as being doubled-up.\n\nAn analysis published by Valley Youth House found that its version of the program – Synergy in Schools – saved the city $2.68 for every dollar spent, through money that did not have to be appropriated through the shelter, child welfare and criminal justice systems.\n\n“This is not the solution to our housing crisis in Philadelphia, but it’s a piece of it,” Alyssa Weinfurtner, the organization’s director of emergency services, said during Tuesday’s discussion.",

If that sounds like a good time, then you want to celebrate the age-old Finnish tradition known as Kalsarikännit, and The Finnish Long Drink wants to help you.\n\nKalsarikännit is a Finnish word that literally translates as “pantsdrunk,” and honors the longstanding tradition of drinking at home in the comfort of only your underwear. The Finnish Long Drink, inspired by Finland’s national drink, “lonkero,” or “long drink,” is looking to support college basketball fans who are celebrating Kalsarikännit by supplying them with a six-pack of their award-winning cocktail for only $0.01.\n\n“While college basketball is one of the most exciting times of the year, bars can sometimes be a less than ideal place to watch with crowds and distractions,” said Sakari Manninen, The Finnish Long Drink co-founder. “This felt like the perfect time to tap into the Long Drink’s Finnish roots and give drinkers another option – enjoying the games, pants-free or otherwise, in the comfort of their own home. Of course, for those who prefer to watch in the bar, we would strongly recommend wearing pants.”\n\nNow through April 7, fans can avoid the chaotic hustle and bustle of the local bar scene and instead relax in the tranquility of their own home, where the only craze comes in the form of March Madness, and enjoy sparkling refreshment and ultimate relaxation. To be well on your way to celebrating March Madness Kalsarikännit-style, all one needs to do is buy a six-pack of The Finnish Long Drink, text them your receipt, and then Long Drink will Venmo or PayPal you directly for the difference within 24-48 hours.\n\nThe Finnish Long Drink was co-founded by Finns Sakari Manninen, Mikael Taipale, and Ere Manner, alongside American entrepreneur Evan Burns, and initially made its debut in 2018. The next year, Downington, PA native and critically acclaimed actor Miles Teller discovered the drink in 2019 while living in Manhattan. Teller was so fond of the drink that he became a co-owner shortly thereafter and helped oversee the brand’s impressive growth, including the debut of the cocktail in Teller’s home state late last year.\n\nFor more details and to learn how to text your receipt to Long Drink, visit thelongdrink.com/kalsarikannit.

Graham leaves the field pitch with the loudest ovation after winning the Super Bowl in his final appearance. Having spent almost half of his entire career in Philadelphia, the defensive end isn’t ready for life without the Eagles, indicating his willingness to return in some other capacity.\n\nBrandon Graham bids goodbye to Philadelphia\n\nGraham’s 15-year career remains a typical hero’s journey, where the protagonist embarks on a mission, faces and overcomes challenges and returns home transformed by his experiences.\n\nThe 36-year-old was a first round pick out of Michigan, who suffered criticisms and was mainly a backup in his first five seasons as a Pro, managing only 17 sacks during the time. He soon turned his fortunes around and became an important figure in the Eagles’ roster, with his strip-sack of Tom Brady in Super Bowl LII being the major highlight of his turnaround.\n\nWith his effort, he thwarted a comeback attempt and helped the Eagles clinch its first Vice Lombardi Trophy. And when it was time for the second, Brandon Graham returned from a torn triceps just in time to play against Chiefs at Super Bowl LIX, where he got 13 snaps and made one tackle in Eagles’ 40-22 win over Kansas City Chiefs.\n\nOct 27, 2024; Cincinnati, Ohio, USA; Cincinnati Bengals quarterback Joe Burrow (9) is sacked by Philadelphia Eagles linebacker Nolan Smith Jr. (3) and defensive end Brandon Graham (55) during the first quarter at Paycor Stadium. Mandatory Credit: Joseph Maiorana-Imagn Images\n\nSadly, he re-tore his triceps in the game, but that was only after he had written his Philadelphia fairytale in the most memorable way with the happiest of endings.\n\nWhile he finished his injury-plagued 2024 with 13 tackles, 2.5 sacks, one forced fumble, 13 QB hurries and 19 QB pressures, he retires as the all-time leader in games played for the Eagles with 206 games, and ranks third with 76.5 sacks.\n\nDuring his stay, he became more than a fan favorite,earning two Super Bowl rings and becoming a team captain and Pro Bowl performer.\n\n“We didn’t start so tight, as you know,” Brandon Graham told the fans.\n\n“You made me work for this and I appreciate you for that. Through the struggles, the injuries and the moments where I had to prove myself over and over again, you never let me feel comfortable. You held me accountable. You kept that chip on my shoulder. You pushed me to be better, and when the time came, we celebrated together — two times.” (Via ABC)\n\nWhat’s next for Brandon Graham?\n\nHaving decided to take a permanent walk off the field, Graham has expressed a strong desire to remain with the Eagles, albeit in a different role. He mentioned his plans to discuss with the team’s owner on his willingness to contribute to the team’s future success. His experience and passion for the game will surely come in handy for the Eagles in some other creative capacity.\n\n“I said I want to sit down and talk with Mr. Lurie and have some dinner with them,” Brandon Graham said. “So, we’re going to do that and figure out what I can do to be a part of what’s going on. Because I feel like, as you know, we’ve got some good stuff brewing right now.\n\n“And I want to make sure that I can be a help in whatever it is that I do. Of course, I want to be creative. I don’t have to be all in one basket, have everything all in one but just kind of move around. I don’t want to just cold turkey leave that game because I love it.” (Via AtoZ Sports)\n\nIt will be interesting to see if Brandon Graham does return to the Eagles in some capacity over the coming months, but for now, we’re left with nothing but love and gratitude for all he’s given over his remarkable career.\n\nMandatory Credit: Bill Streicher-Imagn Images",

        "source": "https://metrophiladelphia.com/",
        "content": "Sign up for our email newsletter to stay up-to-date on the latest local sports news throughout Philadelphia.\n\nThe Union’s perfect start to the 2025 MLS season ended abruptly after Nashville SC handed them a 3-1 defeat at Subaru Park. That lone defeat was enough to terminate their dreams for the Supporters’ Shield and make them surrender to defending champions Inter Miami. But on the flip side, the season is only four games old, and as such, a return to the top of the league remains a possibility.\n\nImage Credit: Philadelphia Union\n\nThree Ways the Union Can Improve\n\nThe game against Nashville was an eye-opener, and after the unexpected loss, here are three ways the Union could turn their fortunes around and return to winning ways.\n\nImage Credit: Philadelphia Union\n\nImprovement on the Second Ball\n\nThe Union’s poor management of second-ball situations received a special mention during Bradley Carnell’s post-fight presser, highlighting the importance of such plays in determining game outcomes.\n\nWhile a team’s quality on long balls may be dependent on their aerial strength, second balls can be properly managed through strategic positioning and an ability to read the game\n\nAgainst Nashville, the Union lacked technicality in managing second and loose ball situations. The reading of the game was sluggish, and such sins are hardly forgiven when committed against a brutal offense like Nashville’s.\n\nThe lethargy that characterized the Union defense in second-ball situations was heavily exploited by Sam Sturridge and his team of attackers, giving them an early lead and numerous goal-scoring chances at Subaru Park.\n\nImproving on the second ball would improve the Union’s setup whenever they face oppositions that try to implement their counterattacking system against them. Aside from helping them retain possession, it also comes in handy when creating goal-scoring opportunities.\n\nImage Credit: Philadelphia Union\n\nDefending and the Offside Trap\n\nWhile the team’s aggressiveness in pressing is commendable, their eagerness to attack and gain the ball in the final third often leaves them with few numbers at the back. Nashville exploited this weakness, whose physical forward was a menace to Philly’s defense.\n\nAs Surridge ran towards the Union goal to put his team ahead, only one defender was present to pressure him. And while he held on to the ball, he was quickly assisted by two other Nashville players in the box, creating a 3-against-2 situation that gave him more options and more room to move the ball and score.\n\nAnother Surridge chance came while he was deep in his own half. Shockingly, the closest Union defender was over ten meters into the opponent’s half, creating a one-on-one opportunity for Surridge right from his defensive third.\n\nPhiladelphia seems to always keep a high defensive line, which isn’t an entirely bad idea. However, their inability to leverage on the offside trap makes them more vulnerable defensively.\n\nBarring the opportunity where Surridge got the ball in his own half, many of Nashville’s clear chances could have been avoided if the Union were better at using the offside trap.\n\nCarnell needs to manage his team’s pressing to ensure they have enough bodies at the back should they be hit by a counterattack. Similarly, the defenders need to leverage the offside trap better to ensure they don’t aren’t victims of their Highline all the time.\n\nImage Credit: Philadelphia Union\n\nDo what Works\n\nSince his days at St. Louis, Bradley Carnell’s coaching philosophy has been clear, and it has also accompanied him to the Philadelphia Union. As a result, he needed certain players to better implement his style, and he did get a good number of them before the season kicked off.\n\n”I believe in the 60/30/10, right? 60% of all our transition goals or moments come from transition, right? So, the 30% set pieces, 10% from possession. I’m not a 75% possession guy, and I believe in being [on the] front foot, proactive in your face, aggressive and very counterattacking.”\n\nIt’s only essential that the team sticks with its identity, whether it’s home or away. The Union’s 57% possession against Nashville was their highest this season, and it handed them their first loss. Any team built on the bedrock of counterattacking and transitional plays has little business with possession.\n\nAs Nashville showed, even when the opposition tries to implement the counter-attacking style, the team could address that by using long balls and being more direct in approaching the opposition’s goal.\n\nIf they must bounce back from the hits of this defeat, the Union must exhibit a winning mentality, a resolve to get going regardless of the adversities. This is just one of the many setbacks they will encounter this season, and how they recover from this will have a large impact on where they rank on the table when the season is over. Their reaction will show if they’re any different from the Union that finished 12th last season or if their winning streak was all a fluke. In a season as young as this, there’s so much to play for. Hence, anything is possible.\n\nImage Credit: Philadelphia Union\n\nBe sure to return to Philly Sports Network for more Philadelphia Union and other soccer content!\n\nFollow our Union team on Twitter:\n\nTim Lovenguth | Jimmy King | Paul Frenzel\n\nNate Tennesen | Eric Frysinger | Steve Beavon\n\nTomiwa Aderinoye | Christopher Babos | Liam Jenkins\n\nDoop on Union fans!\n\nFeatured Image Credit: Philadelphia Union",

        "content": "Sign up for our email newsletter to stay up-to-date on the latest local sports news throughout Philadelphia.\n\nAfter throwing 60 pitches during an intrasquad game on Saturday down in Florida, Phillies starting pitcher Ranger Suárez was lined up to start this coming Friday in what would likely be his final appearance of the spring. Just a day later, however, Suárez reported some back stiffness that could put the start of his season in jeopardy.\n\nRanger Suárez dealing with back tightness\n\nThe Phillies sent the left-hander for imaging on Monday, and it revealed no structural issues – but back issues forced Suárez to miss a month in 2024. He even had to back out of the All-Star game as a result, his first time getting the nod to appear in the summer classic.\n\nAccording to Matt Gelb of The Athletic, Manager Rob Thomson indicated today (Wednesday, March 19) that the club should know more in the next 24-48 hours. As a result, Suárez will not pitch Friday as scheduled. He was penciled in to start the fifth game of the season, April 3 against the Colorado Rockies, so the Phillies have time before making a decision that might impact the 26-man roster on Opening Day.\n\nOct 9, 2024; New York, New York, USA; Philadelphia Phillies manager Rob Thomson relieves pitcher Ranger Suarez (55) against the New York Mets in the fifth inning in game four of the NLDS for the 2024 MLB Playoffs at Citi Field. Mandatory Credit: Wendell Cruz-Imagn Images\n\nWhile Ranger’s stuff had looked less-than-stellar in spring, the team wasn’t worried – he’s known to be a slower starter and a slight down-tick in velocity didn’t set off any alarms. Suárez hasn’t complained until this weekend, so there was nothing of concern from their point of view. Now, they have an important decision to make – who steps into the rotation if Ranger needs some time to rest and ramp back up.\n\nAn opportunity for Taijuan Walker\n\nTaijuan Walker seemed like a shoe-in to break camp on the roster before you remind yourself of his contract. His velocity had increased from last season, his Splitter seemingly returned to it’s former glory, and he limited damage to the tune of a 3.86 ERA. Walker was solid – until Wednesday. Yankee hitters thumped the ball against Walker, putting up six runs in 3.2 innings, blasting three home runs in the process. Nine batted balls were rocketed with 100-plus MPH exit velocity – it wasn’t pretty.\n\nWalker may now be forced into the rotation, and the Phillies will hope they see what he did in his first 9.1 innings, and not the last 3.2. He will have one more opportunity to redeem himself on Monday, the final game of Spring Training. They could also opt to leave him in the bullpen as they originally envisioned and opt to wait for Ranger, or keep someone like Kyle Tyler or Tyler Phillips in for a spot start or two, playing it safe with Suárez and allowing him to start the season on the injured list for some extra recovery time.\n\n“I don’t know,” Thomson told reporters Wednesday. “We’ll know more in the next couple of days.”\n\nThis is a crucial season for Ranger. The 29-year-old lefty is entering the final season of his contract and would be a free agent at season’s end. Suárez was an All-Star in 2024 after going 10-4 with a 2.76 ERA and 112 strikeouts to just 26 walks in the first half. He struggled in the second half (5.65 ERA after the All-Star break) while dealing with a different back injury, and finished the year at 12-8 with a 3.46 ERA in 27 starts.\n\nMandatory Credit: Nathan Ray Seebeck-Imagn Images",

        "content": "Sign up for our Daily Email newsletter to stay up-to-date on the latest local news throughout Philadelphia.\n\nPlaywright Lauren Yee’s ‘Young Americans: A Play in Two Road Trips‘ is a humorous tale with heart and smarts.\n\nHere, Yee follows the path of newly-engaged immigrants who barely know each other traveling together during two seminal periods of their lives, with both of its female characters entertaining goals of defining themselves without connection to the man at the steering wheel.\n\nA cast of familiar Philadelphia actors and creatives such as Bi Jean Ngo, Merri Rashoyan, Hansel Tan and director Cat Ramirez take ‘Young Americans’ for a ride to the stages of Norristown’s Theatre Horizon, now through April 6.\n\nDespite the differences in mission statements between husband and father Joe, his wife Jenny, and their daughter Lucy, their intergenerational immigrant tale unites their family through notions of heritage, legacy and the manner in which these three people connect as “others” in a United States that isn’t always friendly, empathetic, understanding or compassionate. It is important, too, to know that Yee’s script stipulates that her characters are immigrants – without stating their country of origin – and how all of ‘Young Americans’ actors cast should be non-white.\n\n“Lauren Yee writes characters who speak from the heart,” says Bi Jean Ngo, who plays Jenny in ‘Young Americans’. “It is immensely satisfying to look at a script and see people who are fighting to be seen, heard, and understood by each other. I identify so deeply with these characters, as a child of immigrants myself, who has spent my entire life examining what it means to be American and even now, what it means to belong somewhere.”\n\nAsking Ngo about the inspirations that guided her acting through Yee’s poignantly intelligent and provocative comedy that touches on families in forward motion, and she points to her own family’s travels.\n\n“We had an Oldsmobile Cutlass Cruiser station wagon,” she says. “My dad drove, my mom was the passenger princess, and my brothers and I sat in the back with all the luggage. Sometimes, we didn’t have a plan, my dad just drove, and it was always an adventure, and my parents also had great taste in music.\n\n“When I think about my character learning about herself, her new partner, and America through this epic road trip, I think about my family and our epic road trips,” Ngo continues. “If you want to talk road trip film references…my fiancé loves ‘Planes, Trains, and Automobiles’. It’s incredibly endearing. John Candy and Steve Martin are an odd pairing who become best friends. That’s also my character, Jenny, and Hansel Tan’s Joe.”\n\nNgo is quick to add Tan, Rashoyan, and Ramirez to the list of reasons ‘Young Americans’ is a worthwhile trip.\n\n“Merri and Hansel are incredible scene partners,” says the actress. “They’re funny and generous. And Cat is incredibly generous and supportive, and I love how they created a playful, collaborative space where we really feel empowered to propose ideas for our characters. The world that Cat and the team of designers have created for this production of ‘Young Americans’ is beautiful, and I can’t wait to share it with everyone.”\n\nDirector Cat Ramirez acknowledges how the cast of ‘Young Americans’ came into this process with a sense of play and curiosity.\n\n“We’ve really dug into the twists and turns of the script at every point in the process to make sure that the story we’re telling is aligned with the text,” says the director. “I love the arcs everyone has built for their characters.”\n\nRamirez looks at Yee’s work and how the playwright “weaves magic into the world” as a way of highlighting the story.\n\n“We leaned into that with our staging,” adds the director. “It was important to me to create a world replicating the feeling of a road trip — feeling like you’re trapped in the car, or those times you feel like you’re being embraced by the openness and possibility of the road. Sometimes we take the setting literally, but other times, we utilize unexpected elements of the set — beautifully designed by Chris Haig — to highlight that experience.”\n\nIn Ramirez and Haig’s initial meetings, talk illuminated the experience of a road trip’s beautiful vistas often obscured by highway signs, fast food chains, “the detritus of American capitalism. That view feels like a metaphor for ‘Young Americans.’ These characters are working to find where they belong, but often generational trauma, racism, misogyny, and other societal factors make it difficult for them to truly see what they want.”\n\nThinking of their own inspiration regarding ‘Young Americans’, Ramirez’ says that the beauty and specificity, of Yee’s script, didn’t take much work to personalize.\n\n“I was struck by how many moments in the show reminded me of moments with my own family and how Lauren allows her characters to say so many things that I wish I could share with those closest to me,” says Ramirez. “Creating a piece that replicates that initial feeling is important to me.\n\n“Our production is zany and heartfelt,” Ramirez adds. “It stresses how hard it can be to step into uncertainty, and the conflicts that happen when we either hold too tightly to controlling our futures or make the difficult choice to do something that prioritizes ourselves, and I think that’s an experience that resonates with a lot of people.”\n\n\n\n‘Young Americans‘ is on stage at Theatre Horizon, 401 DeKalb Street in Norristown, now through April 6.

José Alvardo has been untouchable throughout the Phillies‘ Spring Training. In seven innings pitched, Alvarado has struck out 16/27 of opposing batters.\n\nThat’s SIXTEEN strikeouts in just SEVEN innings.\n\nJosé Alvarado is reportedly in the best shape of his career. If fastball velocity is any indication of his physical shape, he must be at the top of his game. Alvarado’s sinker averaged 97.8 MPH in 2024. On March 15, he hit 102.4 MPH: a career high.\n\nIt wasn’t an outlier either. Two other of his pitches reached the 102 MPH mark. His 11 sinkers averaged 101.5 MPH. A few days later, on Tuesday, Alvarado again averaged over 100 MPH on his sinker, hitting over 101 thrice.\n\nA Rollercoaster of Trust\n\nIn 2022, José Alvarado’s struggles peaked. On June 12, he allowed two runs, and his ERA spiked to 8.36. He was sent to Triple-A Lehigh Valley to get himself right. When he returned, Alvarado looked like a new pitcher.\n\nHis contributions down the stretch helped the Phillies reach the playoffs for the first time since 2011. In his last 37 innings pitched in the 2022 regular season, Alvarado allowed just five earned runs. He gave up just a singular home run while striking out 64. His sinker was electric, averaging 99.6 MPH.\n\nThat performance made Alvarado Rob Thomson’s most-trusted arm in the bullpen in the postseason. Between his first and last appearances of the 2022 playoffs, he allowed three earned runs in 10.1 IP while striking out 13. His last appearance ended a magical run for the Phillies, allowing a massive home run to Yordan Alvarez.\n\nEven with an imperfect ending, Alvarado had become a made man in the Phillies bullpen, and in 2023, he cemented that. He allowed eight earned runs in the 2023 regular season. He was a menace on the mound, recording a 13.9 K/9 and a 249 ERA+.\n\nIn the playoffs, he was somehow better. He allowed just one run in the entire 2023 postseason.\n\nIn 2024, the rollercoaster came back down. Despite recording a career-high 13 saves, Alvarado had a 4.09 ERA. His strikeout rate fell significantly, and his sinker averaged only 97.8 MPH. He fell out of favor with manager Rob Thomson as he started to lean on Matt Strahm and Jeff Hoffman.\n\nWith Jeff Hoffman gone from the mix and his stuff on the rise, José Alvarado could re-claim his elite reliever status in 2025. If he continues his Spring Training performance into the regular season, Alvarado could be among the top relievers in all of baseball.",

They will have options and the draft capital to move up if they desire or patiently wait for their target. Adding a tight end will be one of the more intriguing positions to watch when the Eagles draft next month.\n\nFirst round Picks\n\nTyler Warren, Penn St, and the Best TE in class. He is a lethal weapon with the ball and has a high football IQ. A High School QB who I saw play many times at Atlee HS in Virginia, he is a pariah in the red zone who uses his body and height to bully defenders. Tyler has great hands, dominates over the middle, and the seam, and stacks defenders vertically. TE1.\n\nColston Loveland, Michigan, has the best hands in class, looks & plays like a receiver. Loveland is fluid, twitchy for size, & criminally abuses LBs with his route-running prowess. He fights for yards and uses his basketball background to block defenders and win contested catches. If you want a tight end to be a high-volume receiver, Colston is the TE for you.\n\nDay Two Options\n\nFeb 27, 2025; Indianapolis, IN, USA; Louisiana St tight end Mason Taylor (TE20) during the 2025 NFL Combine at Lucas Oil Stadium. Mandatory Credit: Tanner Pearson-Imagn Images\n\nMason Taylor, LSU, makes tough receptions, moves the chains, and easily gets open. Tayor moves around the line to create mismatches and, in the right scheme, will flourish. Mason displayed a more advanced route tree at the Senior Bowl than at LSU. He has good hands, a 1.8% drop rate, adds YAC, and wins contested catches. He is one of my two favorite targets for the Eagles at the position.\n\nGunnar Helm, Texas, has the frame, hands, and body control to be an effective weapon in the NFL. Gunnar has proven to be an above-average route runner, breaks tackles, YAC, and loves learning. Helm is a film rat. He can thrive in 12 Personnel and is the best run blocker in class. He always finds the soft spot in coverage and uses his body well to shield. Gunnar excels in space and can play in week one. Helm is the other TE I regularly mock Philly drafting.\n\nElijah Arroyo, Miami, is a fantastic route runner. He uses his spidey senses and elite awareness on the field to create space and find the soft coverage. Arroyo is another tight end who creates YAC by attacking defenders for extra yards. Elijah has a wide catch radius that he utilizes to haul in difficult passes on the field and as a weapon in the red zone. Arroyo also stretches the field with his speed and is a willing blocker who does not mind mixing it up.\n\nHarold Fannin Jr, Bowling Green, has obvious ties to the Eagles via their new QB coach and former Bowling Green Head Coach, Scot Loeffler. Per PFF: Harold had the highest overall grade at 95.7 and was first in their pass route grading with 96.1 among all receivers nationally. Fanning is dangerous with the ball in his hands and was first in broken tackles.\n\nHis sticky hands and ability to play all along the line make him a valuable chess piece in an offense willing to utilize his skill set. Harold is also a willing blocker who excels at pushing defenders back by utilizing solid pad level to frame up defenders and get them off their blocks by churning his strong legs to misdirect.\n\nDay Three\n\nFeb 28, 2025; Indianapolis, IN, USA; Clemson tight end Jake Briningstool (TE03) runs in the 40 yard dash during the 2025 NFL Combine at Lucas Oil Stadium. Mandatory Credit: Kirby Lee-Imagn Images\n\nJake Briningstool, Clemson, is a vertical threat who abuses LBs and Safeties over the top. Jake is a fighter for the ball and wins contested catches versus defenders with his strong hands and high-pointing the football. He displays an above-average burst and runs crips routes making him hard to defend. Briningstool is a good run blocker and he will only improve once he gets into a system in the NFL and starts refining all of his traits.\n\nOronde Gadsden II, Syracuse, did not run at the combine but reportedly ran a 4.55 forty at his pro day (not official), which would have been the fastest time of any tight end. Either way, Gadsden is fast! Oronde has an elite burst, an advanced route tree, amazing body control, and speed! He dominates from the slot and shows off WR ability on the outside.\n\nGadsden has good hands, creates space, is explosive after the catch, and regularly wins 50/50 balls. I went to watch him twice and left impressed both times. Oronde has elite ball skills and will be a weapon in week one. He is an intriguing option for the Eagles if they still need a tight end later in the draft.\n\nTerrance Ferguson, Oregon, is a grinder, and his production improved year over year. He has good hands, is versatile, and can play outside or in the slot. Terrance is a dynamic red zone threat and a QB best friend. Ferguson is a reliable, easy target that will be looked to on the field when plays break down and to move the chains. Once he has the ball in his hands, he follows blocks well, creates YAC, and comes up big, in big moments. he is also a threat in the screen game.\n\nLuke Lachey, Iowa, has great size with mobility rare from that stature. He is a relentless worker and boasts NFL BLoodlines. Luke has a wide catch radius, great body control, good hands, a low drop rate, and runs consistently sharp routes. He is a reliable target who gets and stays open for his QB. Lachey is a savvy player who can contribute from day one in a pro-style offense.\n\nWhich tight end should the Eagles target in the 2025 NFL Draft?\n\nAs always, thank you for reading!\n\nFollow me on X @PHLEagleNews\n\nMandatory Credit: Kirby Lee-Imagn Images",

        "source": "https://metrophiladelphia.com/",
        "content": "Sign up for our email newsletter to stay up-to-date on the latest local sports news throughout Philadelphia.\n\nSettling in at the press conference table, flanked by two Lombardi Trophies — sheened and shimmering, likely polished that morning — sat a true Philadelphia Eagles’ legend named Brandon Graham.\n\nThe 36-year-old was trying to read a prepared statement announcing his retirement from football, fighting back the shiny tears as they streaked down his face, and threatened to outdazzle the championship hardware next to him.\n\nGraham — the 13th overall pick of the Eagles in the 2010 NFL Draft — surrendered to emotion and coughed up a fitting farewell one month after winning his second Super Bowl. He said: “No regrets. That’s the one thing I tell them young boys, I don’t have no regrets.”\n\nHe officially retired as one of the most prolific pass rushers in Eagles’ history, with 76.5 sacks, and only two names ahead of him on the team’s all-time list. Graham left on his own terms, going out on top following a dominant 40-20 revenge rout in Super Bowl 59.\n\nHis 15 NFL seasons, all with the Eagles, are tied for the most in franchise history. And his 206 regular-season games (plus 20 playoff contests), all played in the same uniform, rank first in franchise history, probably etched in stone for eternity.\n\n“Fifteen years ago, I walked into this city as a young boy with dreams, big dreams, a little bit of nervousness and a whole lot of fire in my heart,” Graham told reporters. “I had no idea back then what this journey would bring. I didn’t know how many times I would be tested. I didn’t know how much I would grow. And I surely didn’t know how deeply I would fall in love with these fans and the team in this city.”\n\nIt wasn’t always easy for the Detroit native with the mega-watt smile. He was tested in his first few years in Philly, labeled a bust and an injury risk. The Eagles nearly let him walk in free agency in 2015, eventually, the two sides agreed on a four-year, $26 million deal. John Stockton would have a hard time finding an easier steal than the Eagles did.\n\n“When they put that bust label on me, that was tough,” Graham said. ” I didn’t want to go outside. I didn’t want to do nothing.”\n\nGraham was still trying to find his footing in 2010 as one of the first tweeners, stuck somewhere between defensive end and linebacker, with sacks coming in short supply (17). He thanked Andy Reid for drafting him and looking him in the eye, man to man. Big Red told him he belonged in the NFL, then the next regime — head coach Doug Pederson and defensive coordinator Jim Schwartz — showed him where he fit on the chess board.\n\n“Shout out to Schwartz,” Graham said. “That opportunity came, and I didn’t look back.”\n\nSuper Bowl Champion: From Battered Bust to Brady Beater\n\nFootball – NFL – Super Bowl LIX – Philadelphia Eagles v Kansas City Chiefs – Caesars Superdome, New Orleans, Louisiana, United States – February 9, 2025 Philadelphia Eagles’ Brandon Graham celebrates with family after winning Super Bowl LIX REUTERS/Mike Segar\n\nTwo Super Bowl rings later, the one-time Pro Bowler has a strong case to be on the Eagles’ Mount Rushmore. His strip-sack on Tom Brady in Super Bowl 52 has a permanent place on the walls at the NovaCare Complex as artwork, never to be forgotten or plastered over.\n\n“That’s always going to be a good one because a Michigan guy against another Michigan guy,” Graham said of the Brady sack. “I just happened to be there but that was all of us. The person who took away his first read, that’s the guy I need to thank because all that stuff worked together.”\n\nThat one play — Graham still has it set it as his background on Twitter — erased years and years of hurt for a city starved for a championship. And it softened up a fan base which once hurled criticism at him for not living up to the hardened expectations of a first-round pick.\n\n“We didn’t start so tight, you made me work for this, and I appreciate you for that,” Graham said of Philadelphia. “Through the struggles, the injuries, and the moments when I had to prove myself over and over again, you never let me get comfortable. You held me accountable. You kept that chip on my shoulder.\n\n“You pushed me to be better and when the time came, we celebrated together, two times. This city is built on hard work, resilience, and unmatched passion. And you bring the same energy to every game, every moment, every season. Your loyalty, your fire, and your unwavering support means everything to me.”\n\nGraham will go down as one of the best trash talkers in Philly sports history, a spittle-flecked reputation he wore proudly at all times. After their latest NFC Championship Game win, Graham was giddily chiding reporters for counting the Eagles out when they were sitting on a 2-2 record.\n\n“I am happy to not have the stresses of y’all no more,” Graham said, laughing, and pointing at reporters. “The ups and downs of me saying some stuff, and then the next thing I know I got to live through the week.”\n\nThe affable edge rusher often exchanged smack with his teammates at practice, too, specifically Lane Johnson and Fletcher Cox. Both those guys loved giving it back to him. But, expectedly and on brand, the most vitriol came in those Dallas matchups.\n\n“Anything with Dallas, man,” Graham said. “I’m always talking stuff to Dak [Prescott]. Dak be cool out there when we have our back and forth.”\n\nWhat’s Next for Brandon Graham?\n\nFeb 5, 2025; New Orleans, LA, USA; Philadelphia Eagles defensive end Brandon Graham speaks with the media during a press conference at Hilton New Orleans Riverside. Mandatory Credit: Bill Streicher-Imagn Images\n\nUnsurprisingly, Graham has no plans to retire the trash talking or lose the camaraderie of the locker room. While his playing days are 100% over — “I’m ending on my terms and I’m thankful for this moment,” he said — the two-time Super Bowl champion plans to continue to rehab his retorn triceps at the Eagles’ practice facility. He also has a dinner date with owner Jeffrey Lurie on the calendar to discuss his future with the only franchise he’s ever known.\n\n“I want to make sure that I can be a help,” Graham said. “I don’t want to go cold turkey, just leaving the game. I love football too much.”\n\nWhatever that is, stay tuned. If Graham’s 100-miles-per-hour career was any indication, he’s going to do it with the same force he used when he sacked Tom Brady in the fourth quarter of Super Bowl 52.\n\nOther nuggets from Brandon Graham’s nearly 40-minute Eagles’ retirement ceremony…\n\nDec 25, 2023; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA; Philadelphia Eagles defensive end Brandon Graham (55) runs off the field after win against the New York Giants at Lincoln Financial Field. Mandatory Credit: Eric Hartline-USA TODAY Sports\n\nGraham thought long and hard about returning for one more season. In fact, he was leaning toward coming back after the triceps injury ended his 2024 season early.\n\n“If I don’t make it back to the Super Bowl I probably wouldn’t be up here right now, I promise you. I’d be begging to come back for one more. I was happy to make it back and be able to play with my guys and put that uniform on one more time in a big moment on the big stage.”\n\nGraham admitted that the Eagles took the Super Bowl loss to Kansas City really hard in 2023. They were determined to get back and avenge that defeat.\n\n“We owed them from the first one and we didn’t forget it. That one stung. And we didn’t run from that moment either. In that moment, when … I wanted to run. I wanted to go straight to that locker room, but I went out there and I faced it and that’s what we all did. We all faced it.”\n\nOn winning two Super Bowl championships for the Philadelphia Eagles:\n\n“We made something that can never be taken away, two championships, two of them. We made history together and while the trophies and rings are incredible, what I’ll cherish most are the moments, the locker room laughs. I mean … Lane [Johnson], Fletch [Cox], J Hurts, all of them boys know I feel about them. Them on-field battles we went through — it was a chemistry like none other and I’m going to always remember that because that’s what helped me in those moments when they called me a bust. JP [Jason Peters], Trent Cole … lifelong friendships that I’ll cherish forever.”\n\nGraham passes the torch over to 24-year-old Nolan Smith:\n\n“I just told Nolan, now this is your room. Now you’re the guy. Now you’re the oldest guy in that room.”\n\nLIX REUTERS/Mike Segar",

Titled ‘White With Fear’, the feature comes from Area 23a Films, and is described as an “explosive deep dive into the decades-long quest by America’s conservative political machine to amass power by exploiting racial fault lines and stoking narratives of White victimization.”\n\nThe film features first-person access to figures like Hillary Clinton, Steve Bannon, Rep. Jamie Raskin, former Fox News reporter Carl Cameron, The Lincoln Project co-founder Stuart Stevens, and others.

Primarily made of wood, paper, bone and metal, the items all date back from the early 19th century to the late 20th century.\n\nMost of the models in the Independence Seaport Museum’s collection are “scratch built,” which as they say, means the craftsmen had to shape each piece from raw or lightly prepared materials rather than using premade parts.\n\nAnd as a release notes, while perusing through the exhibit, you’ll see ship models that were used for various purposes: Some were design sources, known as half hulls, used in building larger vessels, while others were used for sport, known as pond models. Model ships were made as toys for children, and highly crafted, expensive models on the other hand were intended as toys for adults.\n\n211 S.

Visitors might recognize the name, as the show is an adaptation of Norwegian playwright Henrik Ibsen’s ‘A Doll’s House’. This version breaks the story into three different time periods: 1920, 1973 and 2018.\n\nHenrik Ibsen’s ‘A Doll House’ holds the distinction of being the world’s most-performed play as of 2006, a release notes. The three-act play originally debuted in 1879, and global controversy followed for Ibsen’s “daring depiction of the inequities men and women faced in traditional, 19th-century marriages.”\n\nTickets (various prices) are available online or by calling the box office at 610-565-4211 or e-mailing company@hedgerowtheatre.org.\n\n64 Rose Valley Road, Media, hedgerowtheatre.org",

        "source": "https://metrophiladelphia.com/",
        "content": "Sign up for our email newsletter to stay up-to-date on the latest local sports news throughout Philadelphia.\n\nAs the Los Angeles Dodgers and the Chicago Cubs duke it out thousands of miles away in Japan, the Philadelphia Phillies are in their final week of Spring Training action before Opening Day. While many spots on the Opening Day 26-man roster are essentially locked, the backup catcher position is still wide open.\n\nRafael Marchan, a former top-five prospect for the Phillies, is vying to earn the roster spot from the incumbent Garrett Stubbs. Stubbs, 31, has been the backup for catcher J.T. Realmuto since joining the Phillies in 2022.\n\nComparing the Phillies Catchers\n\nGarrett Stubbs’ biggest weakness as a catcher thus far in his career has been his offense. With a career .215 average, Stubbs averaged just over 100 at-bats per season as the backup catcher in Philadelphia. That changed in 2024 as Realmuto struggled with injuries, resulting in Stubbs accruing 164 at-bats while batting .207. That means that, for those additional 60 at-bats, the Phillies had a nearly 60-point deficit from Realmuto’s .266 average.\n\nIn other words, the more Stubbs has to be relied on, the more prominent his offensive struggles become. With Realmuto coming off a season plagued by injury, that does not put the Phillies in a good position should Realmuto go down and Stubbs needs to fill in long-term.\n\nEnter Rafael Marchan.\n\nFeb 19, 2025; Clearwater, FL, USA; Philadelphia Phillies catcher Garrett Stubbs (21) (left) shortstop Trea Turner (7) (left center) first base Bryce Harper (3) (left center) second base Bryson Stott (5) (right center) and designated hitter Kyle Schwarber (12) (right) participate in spring training workouts at BayCare Ballpark. Mandatory Credit: Nathan Ray Seebeck-Imagn Images\n\nMarchan is a career .279 hitter in only 121 plate appearances. Most recently, in 2024, Marchan batted .294 in a very limited 56 plate appearances. While limited, the signs seem to indicate that Marchan is at the very least moderately better at the plate than Stubbs.\n\nThis Spring Training, however, the two have performed nearly identically. They have notched six hits while walking three times and striking out four times in the Spring. The only difference offensively is that Marchan has had two additional at-bats while Stubbs has recorded two doubles to Marchan’s one.\n\nBut this is the backup catcher, does offense matter? What matters is how good of a catcher they are. In this case, the offense does matter because both Stubbs and Marchan are solid catchers in their own right. Between Realmuto, Stubbs, and Marchan, the Phillies had three of the top-10 best pop times in 2024 from their catcher core. Marchan might have an edge overall on Stubbs defensively, but it is close.\n\nSo Who Is the Backup Catcher To Start the Year?\n\nThere are a lot of factors that play into who gets the job this season. Both sides of the ball are predominant factors but not the only ones. Stubbs is a “clubhouse guy” and has in many ways become a part of the DNA of the current Phillies team. It’s unknown if anyone else in the clubhouse even knows how to use the sound system or even make a playlist after all.\n\nBut then there is also the fiscal side of baseball. Marchan is out of options. If the Phillies decide to go with Stubbs, Marchan will have to be designated for assignment and go through waivers, likely being picked up by another team. Stubbs, meanwhile, has one option left and can be sent down at any time.\n\nThere also lies the factor that Marchan, if he stays on the roster, will remain a Phillie until he reaches free agency in 2029. Realmuto and Stubbs are both free agents at the end of the season. With Realmuto getting up there in age, the Phillies just might be grooming Marchan to take over in the starting catcher capacity should they opt not to re-sign Realmuto.\n\nAs of now, it seems like the job might be Marchan’s, but no official word has been said at the time of publication.\n\nMandatory Credit: Mike Watters-Imagn Images",

So why not have a blast? Why not get the most out of it? Why not laugh?\n\n“Have fun, get great experiences because the early years weren’t like that. You’re trying to move up the ladder; you’re trying to accomplish certain things for the collective — for the team, yourself. I don’t have to move up the ladder. I don’t have to look for another job. I don’t have any dreams of coaching elsewhere, so it’s just fun. You have fun with your guys. It’s laughter, it’s all the great things. But I do know it’s coming to an end.”\n\nPitino is in just the second year of a six-year contract he signed with St. John’s, and he has already taken the Queens school’s program to heights unforeseen in 40 years. With a 30-4 record (18-2 Big East), Pitino steered the Red Storm to its first conference regular-season title since 1985 and its first Big East Tournament triumph in 25 years.\n\nWith it, St. John’s ended a six-year hiatus from the NCAA Tournament with a season that hearkened back to the golden age of the mid-1980s, when the program was graced by the legends of Carnesecca, Mullin, Berry, and Jackson.\n\nIt is a triumphant return to a power conference and the national stage for Pitino, a two-time national champion who was exiled from Louisville for cause after he was implicated in an FBI investigation that involved bribing recruits. He was later exonerated, but his national championship from 2013 was vacated.\n\nHe resurfaced in Greece, coaching Panathinaikos in the EuroLeague for three seasons (he won two Greek League titles and one Greek Cup) before returning to Iona of the mid-major Metro-Atlantic Athletic Conference. There, he led the Gaels to a pair of NCAA Tournaments.\n\n“When I went away to Greece after getting fired — any time you’re fired, it’s a traumatic experience, but even more so what I went through — I felt a little betrayed in a lot of different areas,” Pitino said. “Then I took off for Greece by myself… I stopped hanging my head that night… and then I had the most wonderful two years from a learning experience of my life at 65… I look back on it and say, ‘There’s always a silver lining in every cloud.’ It rejuvenated me. It stopped me from being bitter. I said, let’s get on with it. It’s just adversity, and adversity; you can look square in the eye and piss all over it if you’re smart.\n\n“Don’t hang your head. Pick yourself up, get on, and become the best EuroLeague coach you can possibly be; then, I came back and tried to be the best coach in the MAAC conference I could possibly be. It’s been fun. it’s been a blast.”\n\nAll of it has contributed to the gratitude Pitino exuded leading up to what will be his 24th NCAA Tournament appearance with his sixth-different program (Boston University, Providence, Kentucky, Louisville, Iona).\n\n“I just revel in every single day of all of it,” Pitino said. “Being a part of the NCAA Tournament is what college basketball is all about…This is our month. This is what college basketball lives for: March.”\n\nOmaha, or any other potential opponent in the next few weeks, should not expect a softer version of Pitino or St. John’s once the ball is tipped, though. This is a team that has one of the best defenses in the nation, ranks sixth in Division I in rebounding, and will take a fervent style of play to a completely new level.\n\n“The intensity definitely has taken a jump,” star forward Kadary Richmond said of his head coach’s preparation tactics since winning the Big East Tournament on Saturday. “There’s no margin for error. We’ve been sharp with everything we’ve done this week.”\n\nIt is imperative to do so, considering St. John’s achieved a major goal in cutting down the nets at Madison Square Garden less than a week before their NCAA Tournament opener. But it is not a potential let-down that is worrying Pitino. It’s Omaha.\n\nHe was adamant in saying that their point guard, JJ White, who averaged 13.7 points and four assists per game this season, would be “a top-four point guard in the Big East,” and that power forward and Summit League Player of the Year Marquel Sutton was “a hell of a basketball player.’\n\n“Our respect for Omaha is off the charts,” Pitino said. “They can really, really play. There were certain teams I’ve seen sometimes that I’ve seen in scouting that have a lot of weaknesses and that you could exploit. I don’t see that with this basketball team.”\n\nAnd just like that, the thankful Pitino was stowed away for the next break in the action, whenever that might come. The St. John’s faithful will hope that will not be for a while.\n\n“In order to get where we’d like to go, we have to improve,” Pitino said. “There’s a lot of great teams out there. In order to beat Omaha and to keep on moving on, we’re going to have to improve.”\n\nFor more on Rick Pitino and St. John’s, visit AMNY.com",

        "content": "Sign up for our email newsletter to stay up-to-date on the latest local sports news throughout Philadelphia.\n\nThe men’s NCAA Tournament is finally here, and just in time. The Philadelphia 76ers have limped to a 23-45 record, and most fans are focused on the team retaining their top-six protected pick in the 2025 NBA Draft. As is the case every year, the NCAA Tournament is an opportunity for prospects to make their claim to climb draft boards, as it is for Sixers fans to get a bit more familiar with some of the names to watch.\n\nThis year’s draft class is, to this point, controlled by three players, two of whom will not be discussed here. Dylan Harper and Ace Bailey, the consensus second and third top prospects in this year’s draft, did not make the tournament, unfortunately, as their season with Rutgers came to an end in the first round of the Big 10 tournament.\n\nCooper Flagg\n\nMar 8, 2025; Chapel Hill, North Carolina, USA; Duke Blue Devils forward Cooper Flagg (2) blocks the shot of North Carolina Tar Heels guard Seth Trimble (7) in the second half at Dean E. Smith Center. Mandatory Credit: Bob Donnan-Imagn Images\n\nDiscussion of the 2025 NBA Draft’s top selection starts and ends with Duke’s Cooper Flagg. The consensus top pick is the projected star of the tournament for a reason. While currently nursing a sprained ankle, Flagg is expected to be ready for the first round of the tournament.\n\nFew players are as well-rounded as Flagg, especially at this point in their careers. A true two-way threat, Flagg is a high-quality scorer, defender, rebounder, and facilitator. Looking at how he projects at the NBA level, Flag has received multiple comparisons to Scottie Pippen and Kevin Garnett if he is able to continue to develop as an offensive engine.\n\nThere is some discussion over how great Flagg can truly become due to concerns around his ball-handling skills and isolation-scoring ability, but there’s enough potential to predict a future multi-time All-Star with enough of a floor to expect a well-rounded starter who can thrive in any environment.\n\nVJ Edgecombe\n\nMar 8, 2025; Waco, Texas, USA; Baylor Bears guard VJ Edgecombe (7) reacts after a play against the Houston Cougars during the second half at Paul and Alejandra Foster Pavilion. Mandatory Credit: Chris Jones-Imagn Images\n\nMuch has been made of the potential of both Dylan Harper and Ace Bailey, but Baylor’s CJ Edgecombe may have the most realistic pathway to realizing his potential. A 6’5″ freak athlete with a feel for the game on both sides that reminds many of Victor Oladipo, Edgecombe has the opportunity to make a name for himself and potentially overtake one or both of Rutgers’ star prospects with a quality tournament performance.\n\nPlaying nearly strictly off-ball, there are concerns about Edgecombe’s ceiling. He’ll need to drastically improve his ball-handling but has already shown signs of improvement as the season has gone on.\n\nWhile the Sixers would love to land a bonafide superstar, a quality two-way, off-ball threat would be a fantastic complement to all of Tyrese Maxey, Joel Embiid, Paul George, Jared McCain, and Quentin Grimes. Whatever combination of those players is still in Philadelphia come next season.\n\nKon Knueppel\n\nMar 15, 2025; Charlotte, NC, USA; Duke Blue Devils guard Kon Knueppel (7) drives against Louisville Cardinals forward Noah Waterman (93) in the second half of the 2025 ACC Conference Championship game at Spectrum Center. Mandatory Credit: Jim Dedmon-Imagn Images\n\nDuke’s 2024-2025 recruiting class was absolutely stacked. Kon Knueppel was one of three recruits in the top 20 and one of five in the top 31, ranking behind only Cooper Flagg and Isaiah Evans. It didn’t take long for Knueppel to overtake Evans in the Blue Devil hierarchy, doing so by showcasing his premier skills as a support wing.\n\nA stellar shooter and capable defender, Knueppel draws comparisons to Kevin Huerter and Corey Kispert, long sharpshooters who can hold their own defensively, at least in Kispert’s case. This is where the Knueppel comparison is more accurate. While his lateral quickness will leave some with concerns, his strong lower body and capable footwork will make him a serviceable defender, even at the next level.\n\nTre Johnson\n\nMar 4, 2025; Starkville, Mississippi, USA; Texas Longhorns guard Tre Johnson (20) reacts after basket during the second half against the Mississippi State Bulldogs at Humphrey Coliseum. Mandatory Credit: Petre Thomas-Imagn Images\n\nAn electric scorer with incredible shotmaking ability and impressive footwork, Tre Johnson is a certified bucket, and there are no questions that will translate to the next level. The questions surrounding Johnson are more about his struggles to generate pressure at the rim.\n\nJohnson has a pathway to becoming an impressive offensive weapon, but there is also an equal, if not a much greater, chance that he will become a Tim Hardaway Jr. or Cam Thomas bench microwave scorer.\n\nPhiladelphia needs young athletic shooters, which certainly describes Johnson. However, they also need players capable of working within a system as opposed to simply finding their own shot, which is where they may deem Johnson unfit.\n\nKhaman Maluach\n\nMar 15, 2025; Charlotte, NC, USA; Duke Blue Devils center Khaman Maluach (9) reacts after a play in the first half of the 2025 ACC Conference Championship game against the Louisville Cardinals at Spectrum Center. Mandatory Credit: Bob Donnan-Imagn Images\n\nCooper Flagg is the top prospect in the 2025 NBA Draft, but if the Sixers are not selecting atop the draft, or if they remain uncertain about Joel Embiid‘s future—or worse, negatively certain—then Flagg’s teammate Khaman Maluach could become Philadelphia’s top target.\n\nStanding at 7’2″ with a 7’6″ wingspan and an incredible 9’8″ standing reach, Maluach boasts near Victor Wembayama-level measurables. He’s not just a tall drink of water, though. Maluach is also a stellar and versatile defender, especially considering he began playing in 2019.\n\nAn intimidating shot blocker, Maluach is also an impressive perimeter defender who overcomes his shortcomings in lateral quickness and processing time with impressive footwork and ridiculous measurables.\n\nDepending on the level of clarity or lack thereof around Joel Embiid’s future, landing a player with multi-time Defensive Player of the Year upside in his place could prove the wisest route.",

        "content": "Sign up for our email newsletter to stay up-to-date on the latest local sports news throughout Philadelphia.\n\nUnion’s 3-1 loss to Nashville SC on Sunday afternoon was the first for this group under Bradley Carnell. Though a few controversial calls impacted how the game played out, the team is focusing on what they need to do better if they want to send the Subaru Park crowd home smiling next weekend against St Louis, Bradley Carnell’s former club.\n\nImage Credit: Philadelphia Union\n\nUnion quotes after their 1st loss of the season\n\n“It’s our responsibility, our blame, we didn’t play like we should play and we want to just keep growing. The next game, we want to play better like we played before, this is not the way we want to play and I think we have to fix some things, but it’s football, you can’t play at the same level every game and I hope next game that we will get back to how we played before.” – Jovan Lukić\n\nImage Credit: Philadelphia Union\n\nFor the first time this season, even though they’ve been very transparent in their approach and style of play, Philly was outmatched by an opponent who was willing to do what the Union wanted to do but better, and that was different from Andre Blake’s perspective.\n\n“They played the same way we did, I think they scouted us really well, they knew what we were gonna do, they were also very physical. The referee didn’t help, I don’t want to talk too much about the referee because then I’ll get in trouble, but they had a game plan, they were very physical, and tonight we just weren’t able to match their physicality and they got the better of us.” – Andre Blake on the matchup with Nashville SC\n\nImage Credit: Philadelphia Union\n\nAll in all, even with Sunday’s loss, I think most fans would be ecstatic if you told them in January that the team would start 3-0-1 and with 9 points in the opening four games of the Bradley Carnell era. But as the new manager has said, starting the season so well sets the standard, and Philadelphia now has to figure out how to meet those standards moving forward with a target on their back, even when some games don’t go to plan.\n\n“Our boys have invested so much over the last couple of weeks, its just unfortunate that we lose at home and disappoint the crowd and disappoint the fans, you can hear a pin drop in the locker room, the players are really upset about the proceedings today and rightly so. We’ve created a high bar, we’ve set a high standard, and not everyday is going to go our way and today was one of those days”. – Bradley Carnell\n\nImage Credit: Philadelphia Union\n\nOne of the biggest questions for the Union moving forward is how they find ways to win against teams that don’t allow them to play the way they want to play, just like Nashville did on Sunday. That will be put to the test next weekend against a stingy St. Louis team, which has yet to concede a goal this season, with Union missing a number of important players.\n\n“Once you start doing something really well, there’s other teams that are going to watch and try to stop you, so now we’re going to have to figure out different ways to win games and if teams want to come and try to be physical, we have to be more physical.” – Andre Blake\n\nImage Credit: Philadelphia Union\n\nGoing into the next game set to miss 6 first-team players due to international duty, Union will need to carry a “Next Man Up” mentality similar to the one exuded with the kickoff of the 2025 season and need to start Makhanya and Westfield in the backline. To Jakob Glesnes, the opportunity to start and show why you should play every game is the type of competition Union needs within their squad to keep everyone sharp across a long season.\n\n“It’s not just Tai that will be out, or Olwethu that will be out; we will miss a lot of guys for the International team, but it’s then another player getting a chance to show that they should start, and that’s what we’re fighting for every day, everyone wants to play. So now a couple of guys will get the chance to show they should be starters”. – Jakob Glesnes on Union being shorthanded against St Louis next weekend\n\nImage Credit: Philadelphia Union\n\nUnion can’t sulk on this loss, but from Jakob Glesnes’s perspective, Philly should feel their anger for a few hours, learn from their first loss, and get ready to go next weekend in a big test against Carnell’s former team, with a short-handed squad.\n\n“Everybody should be angry, nobody should like to lose, so now we’re allowed to be angry today, and then we start with a new day tomorrow and we’ll be ready for the weekend” – Jakob Glesnes on Union’s 3-1 loss to Nashville SC\n\nImage Credit: Philadelphia Union\n\nBe sure to return to Philly Sports Network for more Philadelphia Union and other soccer content!\n\nFollow our Union team on Twitter:\n\nTim Lovenguth | Jimmy King | Paul Frenzel\n\nNate Tennesen | Eric Frysinger | Steve Beavon\n\nTomiwa Aderinoye | Christopher Babos | Liam Jenkins\n\nDoop on Union fans!\n\nFeatured Image Credit: Philadelphia Union",

        "content": "Sign up for our email newsletter to stay up-to-date on the latest local sports news throughout Philadelphia.\n\nThe Philadelphia 76ers are in Oklahoma City to take on the Thunder in a matchup of two different processes. The Sixers have seen everything that could go wrong with the team, go wrong this year, while the Thunder are tied with the Cavaliers for the best record in the league.\n\nArmed with draft picks and young talent, the Thunder represent everything that the Sixers were supposed to be and this game could have major implications on the Thunder being able to take the Sixers first-round pick in the upcoming draft.\n\nSixers vs Thunder game information\n\nWho: Philadelphia 76ers (23-45) at Oklahoma City Thunder (56-12)\n\nWhen: 8:00 pm EST\n\nWhere: Paycom Center, Oklahoma City OK\n\nHow to watch: NBC Sports Philadelphia\n\nLatest on the Sixers\n\nThe Sixers are coming off an overtime loss to the Rockets on Monday where, for a large part of the game, it looked like they were going to steal a win. In the end, the Rockets outscored them 13-6 in the overtime period to secure victory, but it was a positive game for the Sixers depleted squad. As has been the case of late, Quentin Grimes just couldn’t be stopped and the other young players all were chipping in throughout the night.\n\nMar 16, 2025; Dallas, Texas, USA; Philadelphia 76ers guard Quentin Grimes (5) looks to score as Dallas Mavericks forward P.J. Washington (25) defends during the first half at American Airlines Center. Mandatory Credit: Kevin Jairaj-Imagn Images\n\nGrimes has played himself into a very strong spot in terms of his future contract. Over his last ten games, Grimes is averaging 28.6 points, 5.6 rebounds and 4.6 assists to go along with 2.1 steals per game, all while shooting 53.7% from the floor and 41.3% on his three-point attempts. What he’s shown is that he can be a huge piece to a team that would use him properly. Sadly, for the Sixers, with Joel Embiid, Paul George and Tyrese Maxey on the roster, Grimes wouldn’t get the freedom nor the shots that he’s getting now yet he could still be a huge part of the puzzle moving forward.\n\nEveryone who played on Monday night contributed with Jared Butler getting 21 points, Justin Edwards having 18, Jalen Hood-Schifino having 12 and even Oshae Brissett having 11 points and five rebounds. A big issue is that Brissett, standing at 6’7″, was the center for the team and the Sixers were outrebounded 58-35 with their offensive rebounding just miserable. With Drummond, Yabusele and Embiid all out against the Thunder it may be more of the same.\n\nLatest on the Thunder\n\nComing into their contest against the Sixers, the Thunder are tied with the Cavaliers for the best record in the league, and with games against the Hornets, Kings and Clippers on the horizon, they should be at 60 wins for the season by the middle of next week. The team is everything that the Sixers had once aspired to be as they have a bunch of young talented players, a good amount of cap space and still hold quite a few draft picks.\n\nThe Thunder will be missing MVP candidate and leading scorer, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander as he’s “resting” for tonight’s game. Along with SGA, the team will be missing their second-leading scorer, Jalen Williams who’s listed as “out” with a hip injury. SGA and Williams combine for 54.3 points, 10.5 rebounds and 11.5 assists to go along with 3.5 steals per game, so the team will have some issues against a Sixers team that looks to be coming together despite their injuries.\n\nMar 16, 2025; Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA; Oklahoma City Thunder guard Shai Gilgeous-Alexander (2) celebrates with guard Isaiah Joe (11) after score in the fourth quarter against the Milwaukee Bucks at Fiserv Forum. Mandatory Credit: Benny Sieu-Imagn Images\n\nThe Thunder do have Chet Holmgren available, who’s averaging 15.0 points and 8,3 rebounds to go along with 1.7 blocks per game in just over 28 minutes per game. Holmgren, with the Sixers featuring the smallest of lineups, could have himself a 40-point game and not break a sweat tonight. Despite the number of people missing for the Thunder tonight, they’ll also have Aaron Wiggins, old friend Isaiah Joe and Alex Caruso on the floor and that should be enough to get a win while resting some of their big names.\n\nWhat to watch for tonight\n\nWith the this version of the Sixers, anyones guess is as good as mine. You can expect another huge game from Quentin Grimes, who will not stop competing and trying to get some wins. The youngsters, again, like Edwards, Ricky Council IV, Jared Butler, Brissett and Hood-Schifino will all look to build on their recent successes, but the Thunder are a very different beast.\n\nWith one of the top offenses in the league and the best defense, the 76ers will have a huge mountain to overcome if they want to get a win. Even without SGA and Williams, the Thunder can put up points and prevent most teams from getting theirs. Despite the congestion in the Western Conference and the Sixers’ performance against the Rockets, there are quite a few reasons why the Thunder are 12.5 games up on the second-closest team in the West, they’re just that good.\n\nFor the fans hoping that the Sixers can move up in their quest for the fifth-worst record in the league and increased chances of keeping the Thunder from taking their first-round pick, they may have a tough time watching Grimes go to work without restrictions. He’s been on fire of late and doesn’t seem to be cooling off any time soon. If Grimes gets hot and can stay that way throughout the game and the Sixers can shoot like they did against the Rockets, the team could upset the Thunder but it’s not that likely.\n\nPrediction\n\nSixers 109 – Thunder 117\n\nMandatory Credit: Kevin Jairaj-Imagn Images",

        "source": "https://www.fox29.com/",
        "content": "The Brief Trump is set to sign an executive order Thursday to close the U.S. Education Department, a key campaign promise. Congress created the agency in 1979, making full elimination unlikely without legislative approval. The department manages billions in funding for schools and federal student loans, raising questions about the impact of its closure.\n\n\n\nPresident Donald Trump is set to sign an executive order Thursday aimed at dismantling the U.S. Department of Education and shifting control back to the states, a White House official told the Associated Press on Wednesday.\n\nThe plan aligns with a longstanding conservative push to eliminate the department, which critics say wastes taxpayer money and injects federal oversight into state-controlled education. However, Congress would ultimately need to approve the department’s full closure, raising uncertainty about how far Trump’s order can go.\n\nWhat Trump’s order aims to do\n\nThe backstory:\n\nTrump’s executive order directs Education Secretary Linda McMahon to begin phasing out the department’s responsibilities while ensuring the continuation of critical services.\n\nA White House fact sheet states that McMahon must take \"all necessary steps\" to close the department while maintaining programs Americans rely on, though specifics remain unclear.\n\nThe Trump administration has already been reducing the department’s workforce, cutting the Office for Civil Rights and Institute of Education Sciences, which tracks national academic progress.\n\nHow would education funding be affected?\n\nBy the numbers:\n\nThat federal funding plays a crucial role in supporting vulnerable students, from low-income families to those experiencing homelessness. If the Education Department is dismantled, it remains unclear how—or if—these essential programs will be maintained.\n\nThe Department of Education oversees $1.6 trillion in federal student loans.\n\nOnly 14% of public school funding comes from the federal government, but much of it supports programs for low-income and vulnerable students.\n\nCollege funding would face greater disruption, as many universities depend on federal grants and financial aid programs.\n\nWhile Trump has called the department a wasteful bureaucracy, critics argue its closure could leave millions of students without essential support, including Title I aid for low-income schools and the McKinney-Vento program for homeless students.\n\nWhy conservatives want to eliminate the Education Department\n\nThe other side:\n\nRepublicans have long pushed to eliminate the agency, arguing that states should control education without federal interference.\n\nTrump’s 2024 platform promised to \"send the department back to the states, where it belongs.\" He has repeatedly criticized the agency as being run by \"radicals, zealots, and Marxists\" imposing progressive policies.\n\nPresident Donald J. Trump speaks during a Cabinet meeting at the White House, seated next to Linda McMahon, then-administrator of the Small Business Administration, on Oct. 17, 2018, in Washington, D.C. (Photo by Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post via Getty Images)\n\nAt the same time, Trump has relied on the Education Department to push his agenda, threatening to pull federal funding from schools and universities over:\n\nTransgender athletes in women’s sports\n\nPro-Palestinian activism on campuses\n\nDiversity, equity, and inclusion programs\n\nCould Trump actually shut down the Education Department?\n\nBig picture view:\n\nDespite Trump’s order, fully dismantling the Education Department requires Congress, which created the agency in 1979.\n\nEven some of Trump’s allies have questioned his authority to close the department unilaterally. A 2023 House vote to eliminate the agency failed when 60 Republicans joined Democrats to oppose it.\n\nTrump’s former Education Secretary Betsy DeVos attempted to cut the department’s budget and restructure K-12 funding, but Congress rejected the plan, including opposition from some Republicans.\n\nWhat's next:\n\nTrump’s order sets up a political fight over the future of the Education Department. While its elimination remains unlikely without legislative approval, the administration is already shrinking its workforce and shifting responsibilities.\n\nThe move could become a major issue in upcoming elections, as both conservative parents’ groups and public school advocates weigh in on the debate.",

        "content": "The Trump administration paused $175 million in federal funding to the University of Pennsylvania over its inclusion of transgender athletes in women’s sports, FOX Business exclusively reported on Wednesday morning.\n\nThe Ivy League university now stands to risk losing all of its federal funding amid an investigation into potential Title IX violations .\n\nWhat we know:\n\nA senior administration official told FOX Business that the administration has paused $175 million in federal funding. This did not account for UPenn’s total federal funding, which the university previously reported last year was around $1 billion.\n\nThe pause is not a direct result of the investigation into UPenn, which the Department of Education announced a day after the president signed the \"Keeping Men Out of Women’s Sports\" executive order on Feb. 5.\n\nFeatured article\n\nActing Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights Craig Trainor said in a statement provided by the department last month that three institutions would be investigated for suspected Title IX violations.\n\nIn addition to UPenn, San Jose State University, which made headlines in the fall after several schools refused to play the women’s volleyball team because of a trans athlete on the roster, and the Massachusetts Interscholastic Athletic Association are also being investigated for suspected violations.\n\nThe other side:\n\nIn a statement to FOX 29, a Penn spokesperson released the following response:\n\n\"We are aware of media reports suggesting a suspension of $175 million in federal funding to Penn, but have not yet received any official notification or any details. It is important to note, however, that Penn has always followed NCAA and Ivy League policies regarding student participation on athletic teams. We have been in the past, and remain today, in full compliance with the regulations that apply to not only Penn, but all of our NCAA and Ivy League peer institutions.\"\n\nThe backstory:\n\nUPenn first made headlines during the 2022 season when Lia Thomas, a transgender student athlete, was put on the women’s team and would eventually go on to win a national championship title in the women’s 500-yard freestyle.\n\nThomas would also tie with former Kentucky swimmer Riley Gaines for fifth place in the 200-yard freestyle that year, although it would be Thomas that solely received the trophy during the awards ceremony.\n\nThomas’ participation sparked a national debate surrounding girls’ and women’s sports, which, under the Trump administration, has seen several states at odds with federal law.\n\nDig deeper:\n\nLast week, the U.S. Department of Agriculture paused funding to the University of Maine System, a network of eight public colleges in the state, but days later, U.S. Sen. Susan Collins' office said the funding freeze had been reversed.\n\nAdditionally, this week, Rep. Mary Miller, R-Ill., called on the Trump administration to pull federal funding from an Illinois school district after one mother accused her 13-year-old daughter’s school of forcing girls to change in front of another trans student in the girl’s locker room.\n\nUPenn has posted several statements online as the university braced for cuts in federal funding.",

        "content": "The Brief Voters in a western Pennsylvania state House district will decide which party will hold the speakership. The race pits McKeesport Police Officer Dan Goughnour against longtime volunteer firefighter and current White Oak Borough Council President Chuck Davis. Democrats hope to keep the seat and maintain Democratic Speaker Joanna McClinton as the chamber's presiding officer.\n\n\n\nPennsylvania's special election next week will determine whether Democrats or Republicans will control the state House, a glimpse of voter sentiment in the swing state that helped return President Donald Trump to the White House.\n\nThe backstory:\n\nThe death of Democratic state Rep. Matt Gergely has left the House deadlocked at 101-101 since January. A Democratic win on Tuesday would keep Speaker Joanna McClinton of Philadelphia as the chamber’s presiding officer, while a Republican flip would enable the GOP to pick a different speaker, control the voting schedule and install their own members as committee chairs.\n\nThe race pits Democrat Dan Goughnour, 39, a police officer who supervises detectives and serves on the school board in McKeesport, against Republican Chuck Davis, 66, a fire chief who also serves as president of the White Oak Borough Council. Libertarian Adam Kitta is also on the ballot.\n\nSteelmaking towns once thrived in the district southeast of Pittsburgh at the confluence of the Monongahela and Youghiogheny rivers, but the the area known as the Mon Valley is now economically challenged.\n\nIn a visit to the district last month, Democratic National Committee Chairman Ken Martin said a win will show that Democrats are willing to fight for their values. Pennsylvania Democrats lost a U.S. Senate seat and all three row offices — treasurer, attorney general and auditor general — in the November election, along with giving Trump a slim majority of the state’s votes.\n\nDig deeper:\n\nIt would be a seismic upset for Republicans to flip it after the district went for Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris over Trump in November, 58% to 42%. Gergely won it with 75% of the vote in a special election in 2023, and Republicans did not field a candidate against him last fall. In the 2022 gubernatorial race, Democrat Josh Shapiro also won three-quarters of the district's vote, swamping Republican state Sen. Doug Mastriano of Franklin County.\n\nHouse Democratic Campaign Committee executive director Madeline Zann said she senses some increased enthusiasm among volunteers and small-dollar donors that may be prompted by concerns about the Trump administration. She said the candidates will have to focus on issues closer to home and getting core supporters to vote, since many people ignore special elections.\n\n\"It’s a turnout election in many ways,\" Zann said.\n\nRep. Jamie Barton of Schuylkill County, who leads campaigns for the Republican caucus in the state House, said Davis is in an uphill fight in the 35th, calling it a \"strong-leaning Democratic district.\" But he said new local GOP leadership has energized Republican voters.\n\n\"No matter who looks good on paper you’ve got to have the election,\" Barton said. \"We’re not taking anything for granted.\"\n\nAnother special election on Tuesday will determine who fills the state Senate seat that Ryan Aument, R-Lancaster, relinquished to work for Republican U.S. Sen. Dave McCormick. Republican Lancaster County Commissioner Josh Parsons is running against Democrat James Andrew Malone, the mayor of East Petersburg. A win by Malone in the Republican-leaning district would not threaten the GOP state Senate majority. The third candidate is Libertarian Zachary Moore.",

The Philadelphia Parking Authority said the digital parking reservation platform is convenient and easy to use.\n\n\n\nThe Philadelphia Parking Authority (PPA) is now partnering with SpotHero to offer advanced booking for parking at six city-owned garages through the digital parking reservation platform.\n\n\"People have angst when they come to an area where they know there’s going to be some traffic. It’s going to be hard to park so I think to be able to do that ahead of time. They can go right to the location, go right to the spot, and it takes the angst out of it, and I think that’s the goal. Make things convenient and that’s why we want to do it,\" said Richard Lazer, Executive Director of PPA.\n\nThe PPA garages that can be booked in advance through SpotHero include:\n\n125 South 2nd Street - Autopark @ Olde City\n\n41 N. 6th Street - Autopark @ Independence Mall\n\n740 Arch St. (801 Filbert St.) - Parkade on 8th Garage\n\n45 N. 10th Street - Autopark @ Fashion District\n\n14 S 10th Street - Autopark @ Jefferson Garage\n\n124 N. 15th St (1503 Arch St.) - Family Courthouse Garage\n\n\"Driving and looking for parking in the city can be very treacherous and it could be like hours sometimes looking for parking, so knowing they have an app where you have parking reserved for you is pretty awesome,\" said David Bullard of West Oak Lane.\n\n\"I have used SpotHero to reserve spots in New York when we were going to see a show. It was very convenient, and it worked well,\" said Stephanie Gonzalez Ferrandez of Ben Salem. \"You get a much better rate and you get it in advance. You lock it in.\"\n\nLazer believes SpotHero has the potential to introduce new drivers to its garages, and said PPA is already seeing new parking trends through the app.\n\n\"We’re tapping into folks that maybe are doing these pre-orders before they get here and not just somebody pulling in to park for the day,\" said Lazer. \"We’re getting longer stays of people who maybe are coming in for a few days, so they’re booking their whole time and you get feedback also from the customer on what worked and what didn’t.\"\n\nAccording to the PPA, the revenue generated at the six city-owned garages are comparable between this year and last year through the period of January 1 and March 17 at more than $1.6 million.\n\nHowever, online bookings increased this year compared to last year during this period. The city estimates about $2,000 in parking booked through the PPA run app \"JPass\" in January-March of 2024. Whereas this year, online bookings have already generated $62,117.60. SpotHero accounts for $46,860.50 of that total.\n\nPPA believes the partnership with SpotHero will help the city manage the garages better since they’ll receive additional driver feedback through the service and additional parking data.",

It’s not the first time Ben & Jerry’s has sued its parent company for interfering with the brand’s progressive political statements.\n\n\n\nBen & Jerry’s, the popular Vermont-based ice cream brand known for its progressive politics, is suing its parent company Unilever over the firing of Ben & Jerry’s CEO.\n\nA lawsuit filed by Ben & Jerry’s this week says London-based Unilever informed its board on March 3 that it is removing and replacing Ben & Jerry’s CEO David Stever. According to Ben & Jerry’s, Stever’s removal violates its merger agreement with Unilever, which stipulates that a CEO’s removal can only happen after consulting with an advisory committee from Ben & Jerry’s board.\n\nWhy is Ben & Jerry’s suing Unilever?\n\nThe backstory:\n\nUnilever bought Ben & Jerry’s 25 years ago for $326 million. At the time, Ben & Jerry’s said the partnership would help the progressive Vermont-based ice cream company expand its social mission.\n\nBut in recent years, the merger has become fractured. In 2021, Ben & Jerry’s announced it would stop serving Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank and contested east Jerusalem. The following year, Unilever sold its Israeli business to a local company that said it would sell Ben & Jerry’s under its Hebrew and Arabic name throughout Israel and the West Bank.\n\nIn November, Ben & Jerry’s sued Unilever in federal court in New York, accusing it of silencing Ben & Jerry’s statements in support of Palestinians in the Gaza war.\n\nRELATED: Israel strikes Gaza: What happened to the ceasefire?\n\nIn that lawsuit, Ben & Jerry’s said Unilever also refused to let the company release a social media post that identified issues it believed would be challenged during President Donald Trump’s second term, including minimum wages, universal health care, abortion and climate change.\n\nTuesday’s filing was an amendment to that lawsuit.\n\nWhat’s next for Unilever and Ben & Jerry’s?\n\nWhat's next:\n\nUnilever says it’s planning to spin off its ice cream business — including Ben & Jerry’s — by the end of 2025 as part of a larger restructuring. Unilever also owns personal hygiene brands like Dove soap and food brands like Hellmann’s mayonnaise.\n\nWhen Ben & Jerry's first filed the lawsuit against Unilever in November, Unilever said at the time that it rejected the claims and planned to \"defend our case very strongly.\" LiveNow from FOX has reached out to Unilever for comment on the CEO accusations.",

        "source": "https://www.fox29.com/",
        "content": "The Brief Throughout history, states have used five different execution methods: lethal injection, electrocution, lethal gas, firing squad and hanging. Lethal injection is the preferred method, but it is not without problems or controversies. The method of using lethal gas to carry out an execution has recently shifted from cyanide to nitrogen.\n\n\n\nThroughout history, the states have used five different execution methods: lethal injection, electrocution, lethal gas, firing squad and hanging.\n\nHere’s a look at how the U.S. has executed people throughout history:\n\nExecutions in the U.S.\n\nThe backstory:\n\nExecutions were effectively halted nationwide in 1972 under the landmark Supreme Court ruling in Furman v. Georgia, which ruled the death penalty cruel and unusual punishment and therefore unconstitutional. But the Supreme Court lifted its ban on capital punishment in 1976.\n\nBy the numbers:\n\n1,614 men and women have been executed in the U.S. since 1976, as of March 19, 2025.\n\nThirteen more deaths are scheduled for 2025, according to Death Penalty Information Center, a Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit center.\n\nExecutions reached the highest level in American history in the 1930s, when an average of 167 people were executed per year.\n\nNow, the average has been less than 30 executions for several years in a row.\n\nBig picture view:\n\nOver recent decades, the number of executions nationally has declined sharply amid legal battles, a shortage of lethal injection drugs and waning public support. That has led a majority of states to either abolish or pause carrying out the death penalty.\n\nHanging\n\nBig picture view:\n\nHanging was once the primary execution method until about the 1890s, and has only been carried out a handful of times in the modern era - in 1993, 1994 and 1996.\n\nA person was blindfolded and their hands and legs were secured before a noose was placed around their neck and they fell through a trap door.\n\nFiring squad execution\n\nBig picture view:\n\nFiring squads are rarely used in the modern era.\n\nFor this method, an inmate is usually bound to a chair and is shot through the heart by a group of prison staffers standing 20 to 25 feet away.\n\nBy the numbers:\n\nSince 1977, only four inmates have been executed by firing squad.\n\nOn March 7, Brad Sigmon became the first person executed by firing squad in the U.S. in 15 years when he was put to death in South Carolina. The other three executions by firing squad took place in Utah.\n\nRELATED: Executions by firing squad resume: A brief history\n\nWhat is electrocution?\n\nAn electrocution execution is carried out by strapping a person to a chair and placing electrodes on their head and leg, through which a jolt of between 500 and 2,000 volts is pulsed through their body.\n\nBig picture view:\n\nUse of electrocution has been down since 2000. Nine states authorize the use of electrocution, including Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Oklahoma, South Carolina and Tennessee.\n\nWhat is lethal injection?\n\nFILE - Walls Unit in Huntsville prison is where lethal injections are carried out on inmates. (Photo by Jerry Cabluck/Sygma via Getty Images)\n\nBig picture view:\n\nLethal injection is carried out by strapping an inmate to a gurney and injecting his or her body with a deadly mixture of drugs.\n\nDig deeper:\n\nEven though it is the preferred method of execution in the modern era, it is not without problems or controversies.\n\nCommon problems include delays in finding suitable veins, needles becoming clogged or disengaged and problems with securing enough of the required drugs from pharmaceutical companies.\n\nThe backstory:\n\nIt was first adopted in 1977 in Oklahoma as a means of execution, and the first person to die by lethal injection was Charles Brooks Jr. in Texas in 1982.\n\nBy the numbers:\n\n1,428 lethal injections have been carried out since capital punishment was reinstated in 1976.\n\nGas chamber\n\nThe backstory:\n\nFrom 1979 - 1999, 11 inmates were executed using this method, in which a prisoner would be strapped to a chair in an airtight chamber before it was filled with cyanide gas.\n\nNitrogen gas\n\nMost recently, methods of using lethal gas to carry out an execution have shifted.\n\nBig picture view:\n\nAlabama first used nitrogen gas in 2024 to carry out an execution, marking the first time a new method was used in the U.S. since lethal injection was introduced in 1982.\n\nIt is carried out by placing a mask over a prisoner’s face and pumping in the nitrogen gas, which deprives a person of oxygen.\n\nBy the numbers:\n\nFive executions have taken place in the U.S. by way of nitrogen gas as of March 19, 2025, in Alabama and Louisiana.",

The changes are aimed at limiting fraudulent claims. The requirements will apply to new Social Security applicants and existing recipients who want to change their direct deposit information.\n\n\n\nNew rules are coming to the Social Security Administration aimed at limiting fraudulent claims, which will require millions of recipients to visit local agency offices in person rather than over the phone.\n\nThe agency on Tuesday announced the new requirements , describing them as \"stronger identity verification procedures\" to further safeguard records and benefits against fraud.\n\nHere’s what recipients and applicants should know:\n\nNew Social Security rules to require in-person office visits\n\nWhat we know:\n\nPeople will no longer be able to verify their identity with the SSA over the phone. And those who cannot properly verify their identity through the agency's \"my Social Security\" online service will be required to visit an agency field office in person to complete the verification process, the agency said.\n\nTimeline:\n\nThese new SSA requirements will take effect on March 31, 2025.\n\nWho this applies to:\n\nThe change will apply to new Social Security applicants and existing recipients who want to change their direct deposit information.\n\nDig deeper:\n\nThe new changes come as the agency plans to shutter dozens of Social Security offices throughout the country and has already laid out plans to lay off thousands of workers.\n\nIn addition to the identity verification change, the agency announced that it plans to expedite processing of recipients’ direct deposit change requests – both in person and online – to one business day. Previously, online direct deposit changes were held for 30 days.\n\nEarlier this month, the agency said it would also change how it will recoup overpayments – returning to a previous policy under the Obama administration that withheld 100% of people’s benefits if they were accidentally overpaid. In 2024, under the Biden administration, Social Security announced it was decreasing the default overpayment withholding rate to just 10% from 100%, to help reduce financial hardship on people with overpayments.\n\nBy the numbers:\n\nMore than 72.5 million people, including retirees and children, receive retirement and disability benefits through the Social Security Administration.\n\nWhat they're saying:\n\n\"The Social Security Administration is losing over $100 million a year in direct deposit fraud,\" Leland Dudek, the agency’s acting commissioner, said on a Tuesday evening call with reporters. \"Social Security can better protect Americans while expediting service.\"\n\nHe said a problem with eliminating fraudulent claims is that \"the information that we use through knowledge-based authentication is already in the public domain.\"\n\n\"This is a common sense measure,\" Dudek added.\n\nThe other side:\n\nMany Americans have been concerned that SSA office closures and massive layoffs of federal workers — part of an effort by President Donald Trump and Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) to shrink the size of the federal government — will make getting benefits even more difficult.\n\nSpecific to the new requirements, retiree advocates warned that the change will negatively impact older Americans in rural areas, including those with disabilities, mobility limitations, those who live far from SSA offices and have limited internet access.\n\nConnecticut Rep. John Larson, the top Democrat on the House Ways and Means Social Security Subcommittee, said in a statement that \"by requiring seniors and disabled Americans to enroll online or in person at the same field offices they are trying to close, rather than over the phone, Trump and Musk are trying to create chaos and inefficiencies at SSA so they can privatize the system.\"\n\nDOGE cuts on Social Security Administration\n\nThe backstory:\n\nThe DOGE website says that leases for 47 Social Security field offices across the country, including in Arkansas, Texas, Louisiana, Florida, Kentucky and North Carolina, have been or will be ended. However, Dudek downplayed the impact of its offices shuttering, saying many were small remote hearing sites that served few members of the public.\n\nMusk has pushed debunked theories about Social Security and described the federal benefit programs as rife with fraud, and called it a \"Ponzi scheme,\" suggesting the program will be a primary target in his goal to cut government spending.\n\nMeanwhile, a group of labor unions last week sued and asked a federal court for an emergency order to stop DOGE from accessing the sensitive Social Security data of millions of Americans.",

Eichorn texted an undercover officer on March 11, March 12, March 13 and March 17, discussing the age of consent, and asking for pictures to make him more comfortable. He is accused of trying to solicit sex from a 17-year-old girl, and now faces a felony charge of prostitution with someone \"reasonably believed under 18 but at least 16\".\n\n\n\nMinnesota Sen. Justin Eichorn (R-Grand Rapids) faces a felony charge of prostitution after allegedly soliciting a minor for sex during a prostitution sting in Bloomington.\n\nREAD MORE: Sen. Eichorn charged in federal court, accused of soliciting minor for sex\n\nSen. Eichorn prostitution charges\n\nWhat we know:\n\nCharges filed in Hennepin County on Wednesday detail an undercover prostitution sting involving Sen. Eichorn that took place in Bloomington that targeted those seeking minors for sex.\n\nAccording to the charges, several agencies working with Bloomington police placed ads on multiple websites offering prostitution services.\n\nAt which point, Sen. Eichorn allegedly responded to one of them and began engaging in a text conversation with an undercover officer posing as a 17-year-old girl.\n\nAt around 9:04 p.m. on March 11, Sen. Eichorn allegedly texted the officer if she was \"available tonight\". When he did not receive a response, he texted again on March 12, according to the charges.\n\nAfter receiving a response on March 12, charges say that Sen. Eichorn asked the undercover officer about her location and the rates for a \"quick visit.\"\n\nSen. Eichorn again reached out asking about rates and availability on March 13 and 17, at which point he asked for pictures of the officer \"to make him feel more comfortable,\" according to the charges. He also asked how much it would cost for \"bare,\" which police believe refers to sexual conduct without a condom.\n\nWhen Sen. Eichorn arrived for a planned meetup, he was placed under arrest. Charges say at that point officers located and seized two cell phones, a box of condoms and $129 cash from his vehicle.\n\nEichorn was also charged in federal court on Wednesday.\n\nIt’s common practice for state cases to be dismissed when federal charges are filed, and the Hennepin County Attorney’s Office says will dismiss the state case as a result.\n\nWhat's next:\n\nSen. Eichorn is currently in custody, with a bail set at $75,000.\n\nHis next court appearance is scheduled for March 20.\n\nSenate GOP to file motion to expel Eichorn\n\nSenate Republicans announced they will make a motion Thursday morning to expel Eichorn from the Senate.\n\nMinnesota Senate Republicans released a statement Thursday night.\n\n\"There is no question that these charges merit expulsion,\" Senate Republican Leader Mark Johnson (R-East Grand Forks) said. \"We owe it to the public to hold our members to the highest standards, and this violation of the public trust is so severe we must act. It is my hope that this quick resolution gives Senator Eichorn time to focus on his family.\"\n\nFederal charges against Eichorn\n\nWhat the charges say:\n\nAccording to the federal criminal complaint, Bloomington police began an undercover operation to target commercial sex involving juveniles. They placed an online ad offering commercial sex. Anyone who reached out would be connected to an undercover officer but would think it was a minor.\n\nPolice began receiving messages on March 11 from Eichorn, who said: \"I saw your post and [sic] chance you are still available tonight?\" and then later, \"What’s a guy gota do to get with the hottest girl online tonight.\"\n\nOver the course of messaging over several days, the undercover officer repeatedly said that she was not 18 but was, in fact, 17 years old, charges state. Eichorn proceeded to ask the undercover officer about pricing for various sex acts she might perform, and then Eichorn arranged an in-person meeting to pay for sex.\n\nHe also requested that the undercover officer (who he thought was a 17-year-old girl) send him \"a naught[y] pic\" including one \"with lot less clothes,\" charges state.\n\nEichorn agreed to meet, but were met by police and arrested. In his vehicle, police found cash and a condom, charges allege.\n\nWho is Sen. Eichorn?\n\nLocal perspective:\n\nMinnesota records show Sen. Eichorn was first elected in 2016 and is currently representing Minnesota Senate District 6, which includes Cass, Crow Wing and Itasca counties, with his term ending in 2027.\n\nHe serves on the Environment, Climate and Legacy Committee, in addition to the Finance Committee and the State and Local Government Committee.\n\nEichorn is a Republican who made headlines earlier this week for being a sponsor of a bill that would declare \"Trump derangement syndrome\" a mental illness. He introduced that bill the same day he was arrested, records show.\n\nHis state senate bio says he is married with four children.\n\nAccording to Eichorn's senate campaign site, which is currently down, he is part of the third generation to work at his family's outdoor store and now runs his own small business in Grand Rapids. He also proclaims himself as being pro-life, pro-Second Amendment, and in favor of a fiscally conservative government.\n\nMinnesota legislative records also show he unsuccessfully ran for District 5B of the Minnesota House of Representatives in 2014.\n\nMinnesota lawmakers respond to Sen. Eichorn's arrest\n\nWhat they're saying:\n\nFollowing the arrest, lawmakers from both sides of the aisle have released statements both distancing themselves from the senator and calling on his resignation.\n\nOn Tuesday, Minnesota Senate Republican leadership released a statement saying, \"We are shocked by these reports and this alleged conduct demands an immediate resignation. Justin has a difficult road ahead, and he needs to focus on his family.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Minnesota House Speaker Rep. Lisa Demuth (R-Cold Spring) and leader Rep. Harry Niska (R-Ramsey), released a statement saying, \"Given the seriousness of the charges, Senator Eichorn should resign. While he is entitled to due process, we must hold legislators to a higher standard.\"\n\nOn the other side of the aisle, Minnesota DFL Executive Director Heidi Kraus Kaplan released a statement saying, \"No one who solicits children belongs anywhere near public office or the State Capitol. The facts presented by the Bloomington Police Department make it clear that Senator Eichorn is an immediate danger to the public and must resign immediately.\"\n\nSpeaking on Wednesday afternoon, Gov. Walz also said Eichorn should resign when asked by reporters.\n\nMinnesota Senate power balance\n\nDig deeper:\n\nWith Minnesota Senate seats currently 34-33 in favor of DFL members, a resignation by Sen. Eichorn would further tip the scales of power in favor of Minnesota's Democratic lawmakers.\n\nMeanwhile, a trial for Minnesota DFL State Senator Nicole Mitchell stemming from an April 2024 burglary in Detroit Lakes, Minnesota, is currently on pause until after the end of the legislative session is completed.\n\n\"The Senate has a responsibility to hold itself to the highest standards,\" said Minnesota Senator Republican Leader Mark Johnson in a previous statement referring to her motion to delay any decision until after the session.",

But there are some concerns. Our health and safety committee has laid that out today with a brief conversation on the injury report. There's some challenges, some concerns that they'll share with the broader group tomorrow.

Interest rates have remained historically elevated post-pandemic.\n\nBig picture view:\n\nUncertainty is widespread among global markets about what President Donald Trump’s trade war will do to the American economy and economies around the world.

In two states, nearly half of their imports are from EU countries.\n\n\n\nAs President Donald Trump continues on his dizzying tariff spree, an analysis by LendingTree shows just how much states depend on the European Union for trade.\n\nThe EU’s 27 countries have announced retaliatory tariffs on a wide variety of U.S. goods in response to Trump’s increased tariffs on aluminum and steel imports. There are two states in the U.S. that get nearly half of their imports from EU countries, while six other states send at least a quarter of their exports to the EU, according to U.S. Census Data analyzed by LendingTree.\n\nThe data collected is separate from how much states depend on trade with Mexico, Canada and China, which are also under increased tariffs from Trump. According to LendingTree, most states do more business with those three countries than with the European Union.\n\nWhat is the latest with U.S. and EU tariffs?\n\nWhat we know:\n\nIn response to Trump’s increased tariffs on aluminum and steel imports, the European Union’s 27 countries will raise tariffs on American beef, poultry, bourbon and motorcycles, bourbon, peanut butter and jeans.\n\nThe EU action will involve two steps. First on April 1, the commission will reimpose taxes that were in effect from 2018 and 2020, but were suspended under the Biden administration. Then on April 13 come the additional duties targeting $19.6 billion in U.S. exports to the EU. In all, the EU says it will raise its levies on up to $28 billion worth of US goods.\n\nRELATED: Trump's tariffs on Mexico, Canada and China could hit these states the hardest, analysis shows\n\nTrump has since threatened a 200% tariff on European wine, Champagne and spirits if the European Union goes forward with a planned tariff on American whiskey.\n\nIn an aerial view, container ships sit docked at the Port of Oakland on December 09, 2024 in Oakland, California.

It’s still unclear whether they’ll reach an agreement that would lower or eliminate the tariffs and avoid a costly trade war.\n\nWhich states get the most imports from the EU?\n\nAccording to LendingTree, the following states are most vulnerable to Trump’s tariffs on EU imports:\n\nIndiana: 46.2% of imports from EU\n\nNorth Carolina: 45.2% of imports from EU\n\nRhode Island: 38.7% of imports from EU\n\nNew Hampshire: 34.3% of imports from EU\n\nMaryland: 33.4% of imports from EU\n\nSouth Carolina: 32.5% of imports from EU\n\nKentucky: 31.5% of imports from EU\n\nPennsylvania: 29.9% of imports from EU\n\nArkansas: 29.3% of imports from EU\n\nNew Jersey: 26.7% of imports from EU\n\nWhich states receive the fewest imports from the EU?\n\nThe following states receive the fewest imports from the EU, according to LendingTree:\n\nMontana: 2.8% of imports from EU\n\nIdaho: 5% of imports from EU\n\nWhich states export the most to the EU?\n\nLending Tree says the following states are most vulnerable to EU tariffs on the U.S.:\n\nNew Hampshire: 38.5% of exports to EU\n\nRhode Island: 35.2% of exports to EU\n\nMaryland: 33.2% of exports to EU\n\nConnecticut: 29.8% of exports to EU\n\nIndiana: 28.6% of exports to EU\n\nMassachusetts: 27.4% of exports to EU\n\nWashington, DC: 24.7% of exports to EU\n\nAlabama: 24.2% of exports to EU\n\nSouth Carolina: 24.2% of exports to EU\n\nLouisiana: 23.9% of exports to EU\n\nWhich states export the least to the EU?\n\nRELATED: Tariffs will increase car insurance costs faster, analysis finds\n\nThe following states send the fewest exports to the EU:\n\nWyoming: 2.1%\n\nNew Mexico: 2.3%\n\nNorth Dakota: 4.6%\n\nOther findings\n\nKentucky and Indiana are the two states where trade with the EU makes up the highest percentage of the state’s gross domestic product.

The proposal is unlikely to be approved due to Minnesota's split legislature.\n\n\n\nRepublican lawmakers in Minnesota want the state to add \"Trump derangement syndrome\" to its definition of mental illness.\n\nTrump Derangement Syndrome bill in MN\n\nWhat we know:\n\nThe bill is set to be introduced on Monday by five Republican lawmakers in the Minnesota Senate. The bill proposes changing the state's definition of mental illness to include specifically \"Trump derangement syndrome\".\n\nThe bill defines the syndrome as \"acute onset of paranoia in otherwise normal persons that is in reaction to the policies and presidencies of President Donald J. Trump. Symptoms may include Trump-induced general hysteria, which produces an inability to distinguish between legitimate policy differences and signs of psychic pathology in President Donald J. Trump's behavior.\"\n\nWhat they're saying:\n\nThe Minnesota DFL issued a statement on Monday, responding to the statement. It reads:\n\n\"This is why Minnesota Republicans have lost every statewide election in recent memory – every time they get an opportunity to try to improve Minnesotans’ lives, they instead double down on an agenda that caters to their party’s most extreme right-wing activists.\"\n\nWhat's next:\n\nThe proposal is unlikely to be approved in the split legislature. The bill is set to be introduced on Monday and referred to the Health and Human Services committee, according to online records.\n\nThe origin of Trump derangement syndrome\n\nDig deeper:\n\nCurrently, mental illness is defined as a disorder or other brain issue that is included in a diagnostic codes list.\n\nWhile frequently used by supporters of President Donald Trump – and the president himself – in reference to perceived political opponents who they feel have a biased preoccupation with the president, Trump derangement syndrome is not a recognized mental diagnosis.\n\nThe \"derangement syndrome\" political phrase was actually coined in 2003 during the Bush administration by political commentator Charles Krauthammer about critics of President George W. Bush. The Minnesota bill borrows the exact phrasing Krauthammer used to describe \"Bush derangement syndrome,\" which reads: \"the acute onset of paranoia in otherwise normal people in reaction to the policies, the presidency—nay—the very existence of George W. Bush.\"",

This will be the second one.\"\n\nSo how exactly did Cobbs Creek get Woods to expand his TGR Foundation to Philadelphia?\n\n\"There was a very special golfer who got his start here and he was the first Black PGA winner named Charlie Sifford,\" Meredith Foote, the executive director of the TGR Learning Lab, said. \"Charlie Sifford was friends with Tiger Woods' father, Earl, and mentored him and became a father to him in his adulthood. And when Tiger had his second child, he named him Charlie after Charlie Sifford.\"\n\nOnce it opens, the TGR Learning Lab will focus on STEAM, educational enrichment, career and college readiness, and health and well-being. But it'll be open, for free, to the community for so much more.\n\n\"After school, summer, weekends, at night to explore an array of things ranging from podcasting, how to fly a drone,\" she said. \"You name it, we have it here. And we want kids to feel like this is a home away from home.\"\n\nAnd to the people working at TGR and living in the West Philly community it will serve, it means everything.\n\n\"I want be a doctor when I grow up,\" Fatima Choudhry, a TGR Learning Lab intern, said. \"It's really, really awesome how there's courses here specifically tailored to science and engineering and math and arts and technology and all that, and it's just really cool to get that hands-on experience.\"",

The road hasn't been as easy for Miller, but he's been able to adjust and move up levels in the organization due to Crawford's tutelage.\n\nThe two have risen through the organization together, and Crawford has helped Miller throughout his journey.\n\n\"Ever since I signed here, every little question I have or concern, he's answered it and helped me out,\" Miller said. \"Even when I was struggling up in Jersey (High-A Jersey Shore), he was the first guy to really try and help me out. He eased my mind a little bit. I owe a lot to him for that.\"\n\nLAKELAND, FLORIDA - MARCH 16, 2024: Aidan Miller #21 of the Philadelphia Phillies bats during the first inning of a spring training Spring Breakout game against the Detroit Tigers at Publix Field at Joker Marchant Stadium on March 16, 2024 in Lakeland, Florida. George Kubas/Diamond Images via Getty Images\n\nMiller was promoted to Jersey Shore last June, but the 2023 first-round pick wasn't hitting like a player of that pedigree. Miller was struggling to hit above .200, even having an average of .189 after August 1. He wasn't being written off, but there were questions about whether Miller would get out of his slump.\n\nIf it wasn't for Crawford, who knows how his 2024 season would fare?\n\n\"The biggest thing he's helped me with is the mental side of the game,\" Miller said. \"He was kind of there for the whole thing and the whole process. You just ask him questions on how to get through it and things I could do to improve my game, he was always there.\"\n\nWhile Crawford was changing the season for Double-A Reading with his bat, he was helping Miller through his struggles 120 miles up the road. Since that low point of .189 for Miller, he hit .299 in August with three home runs and 16 RBI. Miller also had an OPS of .906, which he carried over into September with a five-hit performance.\n\nThat led to a call-up to Double-A Reading for the final week of the season, where Miller and Crawford were reunited once again. Both Miller and Crawford are expected to begin the season in Double-A Reading, hitting 1-2 in the Fightin Phils' lineup.\n\nCrawford leadoff and Miller second.\n\nSEATTLE, WA - JULY 08: Justin Crawford #13 of the Philadelphia Phillies looks on during batting practice prior to the SiriusXM All-Star Futures Game at T-Mobile Park on Saturday, July 8, 2023 in Seattle, Washington.

He's fun to just go to work with every day,\" Crawford said. \"It's been really cool just to have the opportunity to go through the minors with him. He's someone that works extremely hard and brings a good attitude every day.\"\n\n\"It's definitely a lot of fun having him hit behind me and being able to hit behind him and see him at short.\"\n\nThe top two hitting prospects in the Phillies system, Miller and Crawford are rising through the ranks together. Crawford the big bro and Miller the little bro.\n\nBoth could be in the Phillies lineup by 2026 at the rate they are hitting.\n\n\"It's so cool to have another guy you're moving up with,\" Miller said. It's a lot of fun....It's been really cool to enjoy this experience with him.\"",

The win was No. 800 for coach Bill Fennelly, third-most in women's basketball among active coaches.\n\nCrooks, named to The Associated Press All-America third team released Wednesday, dominated the paint where the Cyclones outscored the Tigers 46-28, making 12 of 21 shots. Brown was 9 of 16 with eight assists and seven rebounds.

When Belker's 3-point try spun out of the basket with about nine seconds left, Crooks secured the rebound and the win.\n\nPrinceton hit the first basket of the second half for its largest lead of 15 then went the next eight minutes without a field goal. The Cyclones shot 58% and outscored the Tigers 27-9 in the third quarter to lead 52-47 with Brown scoring 11 points.\n\nAfter making only 1 of 10 shots to end the first quarter and trailing by seven, Princeton used a 9-0 run to wipe out the deficit then closed the half with 14 straight points for a 38-25 lead, outscoring Iowa State 27-7.",

While the mishap sounds alarming, doctors say it doesn't cause permanent damage.\n\nA viral TikTok video that has been shared more than 41,000 times has become a cautionary tale. It's one of many that often go viral in hopes of warning people about a dangerous trend.\n\nCBS Philadelphia\n\n\"It can be quite serious depending on the volume of the glue that gets into the eye,\" Dr. Julia Haller, ophthalmologist-in-chief at Wills Eye Hospital, said. \"These glues unfortunately harden in a matter of seconds.\"\n\nHaller says it's a common problem that is treated in the emergency department.\n\n\"What we're seeing is that the lids are stuck together. So we have to very gently break down that adhesion, pry the lids apart and piece by piece very meticulously take out tiny little pieces of that solid adhesion,\" Haller said.\n\nHaller says eye drops are often in bottles similar in size to other products dangerous to the eye.\n\nCBS Philadelphia\n\n\"It can cause a chemical burn in addition to the adhesions. And so in addition to chipping away those adhesions where there's some loss of lash and skin, there can be a chemical burn to the surface of the eye and damage to the cornea,\" Haller said.\n\nThis mistake often happens when people are distracted or unable to see well. They may confuse eye drops with eyelash glue, nail glue, or even ear drops.\n\n\"What we are seeing in the emergency room is unfortunately even parents who mistakenly put the wrong drop in their children's eyes,\" Haller said.\n\nTo avoid this, people are encouraged to read the labels out loud before using them and to store the bottles in different locations.\n\n\"In some way labeling it so that even in a rush, it's easier to identify what drop you're putting in,\" Haller said.\n\nDoctors say that if this happens, people should immediately use water to flush out the glue. They also say to get it out of your eye as fast as possible, check with their doctor, or go to an urgent care center.",

While it won't offer the full services of a traditional hospital, officials say it will offer primary care, dietary, bariatric and other services.\n\n\"ChristianaCare is actively exploring site locations for our second neighborhood hospital in Delaware County, Pennsylvania,\" ChristianaCare Spokesperson William Schmitt said. \"Springfield is among the locations we are considering.\"\n\nSpringfield Township Solicitor Jim Byrne said the plans have drawn opposition from some residents.\n\n\"We had the planning commission hearing which was well attended,'\" Byrne said. \"There are people on both sides of the issue. Some people like the idea of the hospital, some people hate it.\"\n\nSome people in Springfield Township are worried the project is being built too close to homes and could create ambulance noise. Others complained that a micro-hospital could worsen traffic and stormwater runoff.\n\nThis comes at a time when Crozer Chester Medical Center in Chester and Taylor Hospital in Ridley Park are at risk of shutting down because of financial problems.\n\nKaren Keyser, who grew up and lives in Aston, said she is on board with ChristianaCare's project.\n\n\"I think it's a great idea,\" Keyser said. \"We need something here. If Crozer and Taylor are going to close in the future, we need something close, especially an emergency department.\"\n\nBut DeFeo said if Crozer's health system shuts down, the micro-hospital in Aston won't be able to fill the gap.\n\n\"The new micro-hospital that Christiana's is going to provide is going to be a 20-bed hospital, as compared to maybe 180-bed hospital, similar to what Riddle Hospital does and what Crozer Hospital does,\" DeFeo said.\n\nConstruction of the Aston medical campus is expected to be completed in 18 months to two years.",

The system includes Crozer-Chester Medical Center, Taylor Hospital and other facilities.\n\nAttorneys for Prospect appeared in bankruptcy court in Texas last week and warned that the entire system could be shut down. Then, on Sunday, Attorney General Dave Sunday and The Foundation for Delaware County announced a commitment of \"essential funding\" that would keep Crozer afloat.\n\nCBS News Philadelphia virtually attended another bankruptcy hearing on Tuesday.\n\nProspect's attorney and one from Sunday's office discussed the several hours of work to reach the essential funding deal.\n\nThe Prospect attorney said \"everyone in the room on Sunday was overwhelmingly committed to continue doing health care in Delaware County.\"\n\nThe judge said she breathed a sigh of relief, but she had questions about the possibility of getting a long-term deal done. Every attorney answered that hard work is happening behind the scenes.\n\n\"We were all looking for a hero in this, sounds like we have a few heroes,\" Chief Judge Stacey Jernigan said. \"Thanks and kudos to everyone who is working hard to find a long-term solution to avoid an abrupt closure.\"\n\nBut now the question: what happens after two weeks?\n\nPennsylvania government sources say the amount of money put up by the foundation covers a single payroll cycle. A foundation attorney says his side is committed to a long-term fix as well.\n\n\"We would not have been part of a short-term solution if there wasn't a prospect of a long-term solution ... our purpose is to serve health care in Delaware County. We are engaged,\" an attorney for the foundation told the judge.\n\nLawmakers say negotiations have been underway with other regional health care providers to come in and rescue the Crozer Health system. But sources say the system's financial condition makes that idea unattractive for the other health care entities in the region.\n\n\"All of the hospitals around us will feel the pain if Crozer closes, especially if it's a disorderly closure, which is what we've been trying to prevent,\" said state Rep. Leanne Krueger, whose district includes Crozer-Chester. \"So in the meantime, we've been expecting this could happen for quite a while because this isn't the first time Prospect has threatened a closure, they have been doing this for months.\"\n\nWorkers rallied outside Crozer-Chester Medical Center Tuesday afternoon, calling for a long-term plan to keep the hospital open. More than 3,000 jobs hang in the balance.\n\nLast month, the system was removed from Prospect Medical Holdings and placed into receivership. Delaware County and Pennsylvania provided $20 million at that time to keep the system running. Most of that money is gone.\n\nAnother hearing in Texas bankruptcy court is scheduled for March 26.\n\nA spokesperson for Main Line Health, which operates hospitals and and other health facilities around the region, said patients are coming to its locations \"in increasing numbers\" because of the instability in the Crozer system.",

        "source": "https://www.cbsnews.com/philadelphia/",
        "content": "Health officials in Philadelphia are warning residents about potential exposures to the highly infectious measles virus at multiple health facilities in the city over the past week.\n\nThe child who has the virus was at the following locations in the city at these times, according to the Philadelphia Department of Public Health:\n\nThe South Philadelphia Health and Literacy Center, 1700 South Broad Street. The building includes the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia's Pediatric Primary Care unit in South Philadelphia, the health department's Health Center No. 2 and the South Philadelphia library, but no one in the library is at risk.\n\nThe person was in that building on Friday, March 7, between 10:45 a.m. and 2:40 p.m. The next day on March 8, the person was there between 9:05 a.m. and 1:20 p.m.\n\nThe CHOP emergency room at 3401 Civic Center Boulevard on Monday, March 10 between 7:55 a.m. and 10:15 a.m.\n\nThe person was exposed to measles while traveling abroad, and officials do not believe the case is connected to a recent one that occurred in Montgomery County.\n\nThe patient who has measles is an 11-month-old who was too young to be vaccinated. The baby was first seen at CHOP's South Philadelphia Center. The child didn't have obvious signs of measles until later going to the main emergency department.\n\n\"After this child developed that measles rash, which is much more indicative of it being measles, ended up going to the emergency department and that's where that child got diagnosed,\" Gayle Mendoza with the city's health department said.\n\nMendoza said the health department is now doing contact tracing.\n\n\"Measles is incredibly contagious and really does linger in the air,\" Mendoza said. \"So, after somebody leaves a room, that virus stays there for another two hours afterward. So that exposure time isn't just when that child is in space, it also accounts for two hours afterwards.\"\n\nMendoza said the child is being treated with vitamin A.\n\n\"It's only given to kids who are severely ill, which means they're hospitalized, in order to prevent them from dying ultimately,\" Mendoza said. \"That's what the vitamin A has been shown to be helpful for, and that this child is receiving.\"\n\nMendoza emphasized that vitamin A is only a treatment and does not prevent measles.\n\nPhiladelphia Health Commissioner Dr. Palak Raval-Nelson said she is not concerned about a threat to the general public. Still, the spread of measles is a concern for people who are not protected against the virus or cannot be.\n\n\"As vaccination rates across the country continue to drop, there are more and more opportunities for people who cannot be vaccinated to be exposed to this deadly disease. That's why it is critical for everyone who needs to be protected from measles to get vaccinated as soon as possible,\" Raval-Nelson said in a news release.\n\nMeasles is an easily transmitted virus that can spread through respiratory droplets. Symptoms include a fever, runny nose, cough and puffy eyes. A rash usually develops a few days after symptoms start, according to the CDC.\n\n\"People who are not protected from measles but are exposed should quarantine, or stay at home away from others, for 21 days after the exposure. If someone who is quarantining due to measles must go out, they should wear a mask the entire time they are out. Wearing a mask won't completely prevent spread, but it will help lower the chances of them spreading measles to others,\" Raval-Nelson said.\n\n\"If you are protected from measles, you do not have to do anything. Measles vaccine is extremely effective at preventing measles,\" her department said in the release.\n\nDr. Paul Offit, CHOP's director of vaccine education, expects measles cases to continue to increase because of to vaccine skepticism.\n\n\"This is a highly contagious virus, and I don't think people realize how sick it can make you,\" Offit said.\n\nPeople who aren't vaccinated against measles and may have been exposed are advised to call their health care provider. Doctors say that while the first dose of the vaccine isn't usually given until babies are 12 months old, it can be done earlier if they are traveling internationally or to locations where there is an outbreak.",

        "title": "Dr. Oz pledges in confirmation hearing to continue Medicare drug price talks started by Biden",
        "source": "https://www.cbsnews.com/philadelphia/",
        "content": "Former heart surgeon and television host Dr. Mehmet Oz testified Friday before the Senate Finance Committee over his nomination to head the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services under President Trump.\n\nThe GOP-led committee will next schedule a vote on whether to send Oz's nomination to the full Senate, where he is likely to be approved given the Republican majority.\n\nIf confirmed, Oz would be the administrator charged with overseeing the nearly $1.5 trillion spent by the federal government on Medicare and Medicaid. The two health insurance programs for seniors and poor Americans make up more than a third of the budget.\n\nMedicare covers around 65 million people, through programs run directly by the federal government or contracted out to private insurers. Medicaid supports around 85 million, through programs administered primarily by state governments overseen by CMS.\n\nCMS also sets rules that affect private health insurance, including overseeing the Affordable Care Act's health insurance marketplaces.\n\nOz previously worked as a professor of cardiac surgery at Columbia University and host of \"The Dr. Oz Show\" until 2022, when he stopped taping new television episodes to run for a Senate seat in Pennsylvania. He lost that Senate race to Democrat John Fetterman, in a narrow contest where abortion had ranked as a top issue for voters.\n\nOz's priorities for Medicare and Medicaid\n\nOz outlined a vision for the agency focused in large part on modernizing its systems and tools, addressing waste and fraud and incentivizing Americans to make healthier lifestyle choices.\n\n\"Some of these decisions are not difficult. Some of them need to be simplified. And some of them need to be reminded frequently,\" Oz told senators of the healthier lifestyle choices he wants to encourage, adding later that \"the idea of giving incentives to patients is an idea that I think is a worthy one, especially for Medicaid beneficiaries.\"\n\nIt will be up to Oz to finalize or abandon some major changes to Medicare and Medicaid sought by the Biden administration, like a pricey proposal in November to expand coverage to drugs used for weight loss like Wegovy and Ozempic.\n\nOz did not directly address the proposal during the hearing. But he did promise to continue the Medicare drug price negotiation program launched by the Biden administration, from the Inflation Reduction Act.\n\n\"It's the law. I'm going to defend it and use it,\" Oz told senators.\n\nHe also voiced support for allowing states to add work requirements in Medicaid. Oz also said he wants work requirements to be defined broadly, to include activities like going to school or volunteering at a church.\n\n\"I don't think you need to use paperwork to prove a work requirement. And I don't think that should be used as an obstacle, a disingenuous effort to block people from getting on Medicaid,\" he said.\n\nOz criticizes Medicare Advantage\n\nDuring Friday's hearing, Oz singled out Medicare Advantage as one of the biggest sources of waste and abuse within the insurance industry.\n\nJust over half of seniors have opted for these plans offered by private insurers but paid for by taxpayers, according to the latest federal data, instead of \"original Medicare\" coverage.\n\nHe cited reports showing spending on the private alternatives outpacing traditional Medicare coverage as \"upside down\" what it should be, questioning spending by plans and efforts by brokers to persuade seniors to sign up.\n\nHe also criticized the practice of \"upcoding\" within Medicare Advantage, where providers or plans bill for treating patients as sicker than they actually are.\n\n\"A part of this is just recognizing there's a new sheriff in town. We actually have to go after places and areas where we're not managing the American people's money well,\" Oz said.\n\nOz calls for limiting prior authorization\n\nOz also faced questions over the significant authority he would wield over private health insurance.\n\nOn Monday, CMS proposed making several moves to reverse Biden administration expansions to the insurance marketplace created by the Affordable Care Act, like shortening the open enrollment period and excluding DACA recipients from coverage. In 2022, Oz said that the law \"caused havoc on our health care system\" and that he \"wouldn't have voted for it.\"\n\nDuring the hearing, Oz criticized health insurance companies misusing prior authorization - sometimes delaying treatment until doctors and patients can persuade insurers that it is necessary - as \"a pox on the system.\"\n\n\"We're spending money, wasting money, trying to do a process that should be automated. I would argue we could limit the number of preauthorized procedures to a thousand,\" he told senators.\n\nRepublicans optimistic Oz will be confirmed\n\nIn social media posts last month, Oz has touted \"great conversations\" with key Republicans he would need to win over for his nomination. Multiple Republicans at Friday's hearing said they were optimistic Oz would be confirmed.\n\nSen. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, the Republican chair of the Senate's health committee, was among those to sit down with Oz last month. Cassidy is one of four medical doctors in the Senate.\n\n\"Great meeting with Dr. Mehmet Oz, President Trump's nominee to lead the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. It will be great to have a doctor in charge,\" Cassidy posted on Feb. 5.\n\nOz was the fourth of Trump's health official picks to face questioning from senators. It comes a day after a hearing for Dr. David Weldon was abruptly canceled, after the White House withdrew his nomination to head the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nA majority of senators on the Senate's health committee advanced Dr. Jay Bhattacharya, the president's nominee to head the National Institutes of Health, and Dr. Marty Makary, the pick to head the Food and Drug Administration, on Thursday.\n\nOz's potential new supervisor, Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr., was narrowly confirmed by the Senate a month ago.\n\nDemocrats criticized Oz's past\n\nSen. Ron Wyden of Oregon, the top Democrat on committee, during the hearing accused Oz of \"dodging Medicare and Social Security taxes.\" Wyden said a tax loophole has \"benefited Dr. Oz by $440,000 in the last three years.\"\n\nDuring the hearing, Oz did not respond to the allegation. A memo from the committee's Democratic staff had concluded that Oz may have underpaid his taxes based on a questionairre he submitted, his tax returns and financial disclosures.\n\n\"Now, the doctor will testify about his concern for Medicare's well being, yet he is unwilling to pay the same taxes that millions of Americans pay out of every paycheck,\" Wyden said.\n\nThe president's pick to head CMS has earned criticism from some Senate Democrats for months, who have cited Oz's past embrace of \"alarming pseudoscience,\" record of anti-abortion statements and worries over conflicts of interest.\n\nAs part of an ethics agreement published last month, Oz said he will resign from positions at several companies, including the nutritional supplement company iHerb and the drugmaker Housey Pharma. He also pledged to divest from several healthcare companies, including insurance giant UnitedHealth Group.\n\nAfter the Senate race, Oz had been advertised as iHerb's global advisor. He continued to promote iHerb's supplements on social media after his nomination.\n\nHe has also continued to republish past excerpts from his show in recent years after the Senate race, like a clip he shared on Sept. 4 from a sponsored interview about Medicare Advantage coverage. In 2020, Oz would later propose that Medicare Advantage should be expanded to all Americans.\n\nIn the clip, Oz said that enrollment in Medicare Advantage had grown 70% since he started his show.\n\n\"I want to nudge you. I don't want to shove you. But think about this, because a 70% increase since I started the show means a lot to me,\" he said.\n\nand contributed to this report.",

        "content": "Lawyers with the Pennsylvania Attorney General's Office signaled positive momentum for a long-term plan to save Delaware County's Crozer Health system on Wednesday during a bankruptcy hearing with Prospect Medical Holdings.\n\nAt a lengthy hearing Wednesday, a deputy attorney general told the court: \"This is a very complex dance, and are cautiously optimistic we will have a long-term plan.\"\n\nAttorneys said they are looking at Friday as a possible deadline to have a deal in the works.\n\nThe long-term plan aims to place the financially distressed Crozer system in the hands of a nonprofit to take over and run its two hospitals and other medical campuses in Delaware County. Crozer's parent company, Prospect Medical Holdings, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on Jan. 11.\n\nThe state and county have already shelled out $20 million to keep the lights in the bankrupt facilities.\n\nThe health network was bailed out in February with a cash infusion from the state and Delaware County for a combined $20 million, but that money ran out in March.\n\nLast week, the Foundation for Delaware County provided $7 million for an additional round of payroll, leaving the hospitals with an operational deadline of next Wednesday.\n\nPeggy Malone, the president of the Crozer-Chester Nurses Association, said it's been rough working within the health network amid the potential shutdown.\n\n\"So it just continued the roller-coaster that we've been on,\" she said. \"But again, anything that sheds a little bit of optimism and hope is what we're looking for — we're not leaving.\"\n\nFor Claudia Northfleet, who was just discharged from the hospital, the news of a possible long-term deal was well-received.\n\nJeanette Winston said Crozer-Chester Medical Center is vital to the community.\n\n\"I've got daughters that are asthmatic, I've got daughters allergic to peanuts and shellfish,\" she said. \"My husband actually works at this hospital doing the housekeeping — it means a lot. I had my babies at this hospital. To shut this hospital down, with a big community — we need this hospital.\"\n\nWinston is hoping that deal comes to fruition on Friday.\n\n\"I believe there's a way,\" she said. \"I believe.\"",

        "content": "White House says it's cutting millions in funds for University of Pennsylvania\n\nWhite House says it's cutting millions in funds for University of Pennsylvania\n\nWhite House says it's cutting millions in funds for University of Pennsylvania\n\nThe Trump administration says it's cutting $175 million in funding to the University of Pennsylvania over policies allowing transgender women to compete in women's sports.\n\nWhite House officials wrote in an email to CBS Philadelphia that the funding cut is connected to Lia Thomas, a transgender woman and former Penn swimmer who made headlines and drew backlash when she competed for the women's swimming team.\n\n\"UPenn infamously permitted a male to compete on its women's swimming team, overturning multiple records hard-earned by women, and granting the fully intact male access to the locker room. This is NOT the result of the Title IX investigation launched by the Department of Education,\" a senior White House official wrote in the email.\n\nThomas came in first in the 500-meter freestyle at the 2022 NCAA Swimming and Diving Championships and had other top finishes in events at the Ivy League Championships that year.\n\nSome women swimmers disputed those wins. A lawsuit filed in a Massachusetts federal court seeks to have her records removed from the record books. Separately, the Education Department launched a Title IX investigation into Penn allowing Thomas to compete on the women's swimming team.\n\nAt the time, NCAA regulations allowed for trans women to compete on teams that aligned with their gender identity. President Trump undid those protections in an executive order signed in February.\n\nA senior White House official said in an email that the funding is an \"immediate proactive action to review discretionary funding streams to those universities.\" The funding that was paused came from the Department of Defense and the Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nA Penn spokesperson said the Philadelphia-based university is aware of media reports and social media posts about the funding being pulled, but has received no formal notice from the White House.\n\n\"We are aware of media reports suggesting a suspension of $175 million in federal funding to Penn, but have not yet received any official notification or any details,\" the spokesperson said in an email. \"It is important to note, however, that Penn has always followed NCAA and Ivy League policies regarding student participation on athletic teams. We have been in the past, and remain today, in full compliance with the regulations that apply to not only Penn, but all of our NCAA and Ivy League peer institutions.\"\n\nWednesday morning, the White House's @RapidResponse47 account shared a clip from Fox Business on X on the news.\n\nThe White House official said Wednesday's action is separate from an Education Department investigation into Penn over alleged violations of Title IX, a 1972 law barring sex discrimination in education.\n\nCity Councilmember Jamie Gauthier, whose district includes Penn's campus, denounced the decision in a statement.\n\n\"These funds have nothing to do with transgender student athletes — this is nothing more than a hollow pretext to target our community,\" Gauthier's statement said in part. \"What Trump is really doing is threatening tens of thousands of jobs, our hospitals, lifesaving research projects, educational programs for underserved youth, and so much more.\"\n\nGauthier added that some prior actions from the Trump administration have not held up to lawsuits and that she is proud that many transgender Philadelphians call her district home.\n\n\"They make our community stronger and a better place to live. I will always stand with them,\" Gauthier said.\n\nGauthier also said the move is not about athletics but about attacking Philadelphia.\n\n\"I believe this is about President Trump trying to attack Democratic cities like Philadelphia. He understands we are an 'eds and meds' economy and he's trying to take aim at the city. This is meant to divide us,\" she said.\n\nMr. Trump graduated from The Wharton School at Penn in 1968, according to the Daily Pennsylvanian student newspaper.",

        "content": "The PSSAs fall on Take Your Child to Work Day this year The PSSAs fall on Take Your Child to Work Day this year 02:36\n\nThe annual Pennsylvania System of School Assessment, or PSSA, tests will be given statewide on the same day as Take Your Child to Work Day. And that is not going over well with some parents.\n\nPSSAs are very important to school districts because they determine things like funding, school rankings and other things. But Take Your Child to Work Day is equally important to parents.\n\nThe PSSA, statewide testing days, which are mandatory for every Pennsylvania student, overlap with this year's Take Your Child to Work Day, which always falls on the fourth Thursday in April every year.\n\n\"Well, it's two separate days no matter how you look at it. If you're gonna Take Your Child to Work Day, that should be one day, and then testing is another day,\" said Terry Lippert, who has grandkids in the South Park School District.\n\nThe problem: neither wants to change their days. The state decides PSSA days. The districts have no say and must comply.\n\nTake Your Child to Work Day is not only important to parents, but many companies go all out for that day with special programs for the kids. The organization that heads up the national day doesn't believe it should have to change its traditional day.\n\nSome parents don't want to make that choice: work day or testing day. However, many parents don't realize their child can usually make up that testing day.\n\nAt South Park schools, for example, the parent just fills out a permission form found on their website. The district will then retest the students on different days.\n\nThe superintendent of South Park Schools told KDKA-TV: \"Take Your Child to Work Day offers students a unique opportunity to gain real-world experience, but its annual scheduling within the testing window can create challenges for both students and educators. While make-up opportunities are available, students perform best when testing in their originally scheduled environment.\"",
