        "fullContent": "South Korean actor Kim Sae-ron’s death this week has triggered an outpouring of grief and calls for changes to the way the country’s celebrities are treated in the public arena and on social media, which critics say can foster a culture of harassment.\n\nThe 24-year-old, who began her career as a child actor and earned acclaim for her roles in several domestic films, including the 2010 crime noir “The Man from Nowhere,” was found dead by a friend at her home in the country’s capital, Seoul, on Sunday. The National Police Agency has said that officers are not suspecting foul play and that Kim left no note.\n\nOnce among the brightest stars on South Korea’s vibrant movie and television scene, Kim struggled to find work after a 2022 drunk driving incident, for which she was later fined in court.\n\nOnline posts in South Korea are notoriously harsh toward celebrities who make missteps, especially women, and Kim faced constant negative coverage from news organizations that capitalized on public sentiment.\n\nGet top local stories in Philly delivered to you every morning. Sign up for NBC Philadelphia's News Headlines newsletter.\n\nNewspapers and websites criticized her whenever she was seen partying with friends, or when she complained about her lack of work and nasty comments on social media. She was even criticized for smiling while filming an independent movie last year.\n\nFollowing Kim’s death, several of the country’s major newspapers on Tuesday published editorials and opinion pieces lambasting the toxic online comments about the actor. Some invoked the 2019 deaths of K-Pop singers Seol-li and Goo Hara and the 2023 death of “Squid Games” actor Lee Sun-kyun while calling for a change in the “harsh, zero-tolerance” culture toward celebrities.\n\nThe Hankook Ilbo newspaper said the country's media outlets were part of the problem, lamenting that some outlets continued to exploit Kim for clicks even after her death, using provocative headlines that highlighted her past struggles.\n\nThe watchdog Citizens’ Coalition for Democratic Media on Tuesday criticized news organizations for blaming social media without considering their own “sensational and provocative reporting.\"\n\nBorn in 2000, Kim began her acting career at age 9, with the 2009 film “A Brand New Life,” portraying a girl’s struggles to adjust to a new life after being left at an orphanage by her father. She rose to stardom with “The Man from Nowhere,” which was one of the biggest hits in the South Korean movie scene that year and won her a domestic acting award.\n\nShe starred in various movies and TV shows before the 2022 drunk driving incident.\n\nGold Medalist, Kim's former management agency, did not immediately answer calls for comment.",

        "fullContent": "A Michigan man drove over 730 miles and set fire to the Pennsylvania home of a man that his ex-girlfriend had communicated with online, leaving six people inside the house hospitalized and two dogs dead, investigators said.\n\nOn Feb. 10, at 5:22 a.m., police and volunteer firefighters responded to the 5200 block of Merganser Way in Bensalem, Pennsylvania, for a reported house fire. When they arrived, they found six people outside the house. All six were taken to the hospital and treated for smoke inhalation. They were later released. Two dogs who were inside the home also died during the fire.\n\nThe homeowner told NBC10 she was sleeping earlier that morning when she heard strange noises. The woman went to investigate and saw a man who she believed was her son inside the home. She then went back to her room but the strange noises continued.\n\nAt 5:17 a.m., the woman walked downstairs and found her kitchen and living room on fire. She then alerted the five other residents inside the home and they all evacuated. One of the residents jumped from the second-floor window of the house to escape.\n\nGet top local stories in Philly delivered to you every morning. Sign up for NBC Philadelphia's News Headlines newsletter.\n\n“It’s a miracle they all survived,” Bensalem Public Safety Director William McVey said during a Monday morning press conference. “And we credit the mother of that house for taking the actions she did to protect her family and ensure that they all lived.”\n\nInvestigators determined the cause of the fire was arson. They obtained surveillance video showing a Volkswagen Passat pulling up to the home around 5 a.m. that morning. A man then exits the vehicle and goes to the back of the home, staying in the area for about four minutes before returning to the car. The man then grabs something from the car and goes back to the rear of the house where he stays for about 12 minutes.\n\nThen, at 5:18 a.m., the man is seen running from the back of the home and fleeing in the Volkswagen. About 30 seconds later, smoke and an explosion are seen from the home.\n\nInvestigators determined the Volkswagen exited I-95 at Street Road around 1:24 a.m. that morning and drove directly to the home on Merganser Way. The vehicle then remained there for a few hours before the home was set on fire. Investigators said the Volkswagen then got back on I-95 South at 5:24 a.m. that morning.\n\nInvestigators traced the license plate of the Volkswagen to a home in Kent County, Michigan. Bensalem Police and the Kent County Sheriff’s Department later identified the driver as 21-year-old Harrison Jones, the son of the vehicle’s owner and a resident of Rockford, Michigan. Police said Jones was the ex-boyfriend of a 21-year-old Michigan woman who had been communicating online with a 22-year-old man who lived at the Merganser Way home that had been set on fire.\n\nInvestigators said Jones' ex-girlfriend had never met the 22-year-old man in person but was planning on meeting him in Pennsylvania.\n\nOn Feb. 12, 2025, members of the Kent County Sheriff’s Department executed a search warrant at the Michigan home where they recovered Lidocaine burn cream, gauze wrappings, a locking pick and the Volkswagen Passat that had been spotted on surveillance video, investigators said.\n\nPolice interviewed Jones who denied being in Pennsylvania at the time of the fire, according to officials. Police said they obtained surveillance video showing Jones was at a Wawa about an hour away from Bensalem the morning of the fire, however. Jones' father also told police a phone app tracked his son to Pennsylvania around the time the fire started, according to court documents.\n\nJones was then arrested and charged with attempted homicide, arson and other related offenses.\n\nIf you or someone you know is experiencing domestic violence, contact the National Domestic Violence Hotline by calling 1-800-799-SAFE (7233), visiting www.thehotline.org or texting LOVEIS to 22522.\n\n“It is clear to us that Mr. Jones had murderous intentions that evening,” McVey said. “He drove over 730 miles, 11 hours, to do what he did and then drove directly back home.”\n\nThe Bucks County District Attorney’s Office approved the charges against Jones. He is currently in custody in Michigan and will be extradited to Pennsylvania where he’ll be arraigned.\n\n\"This defendant faces 13 felony counts and nine misdemeanor counts where the total penalty exceeds more than his lifespan,\" Bucks County District Attorney Jennifer Schorn said.\n\nA GoFundMe was created in support of the family. The Philadelphia Animal Welfare Society also created a fundraiser in honor of the two dogs that were killed in the fire.",

State Department Spokesperson Tammy Bruce told reporters on Monday that the Riyadh meeting was designed to \"determine if the Russians perhaps are serious, and if they're on the same page.\"\n\nKremlin Spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Monday that the meeting was to discuss restoring bilateral relations and \"preparations for potential Ukraine peace talks\" as well as a forthcoming meeting between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin, according to comments translated by NBC News.\n\nAnadolu | Anadolu | Getty Images\n\nKirill Dmitriev, the head of Russia's sovereign wealth fund, is also a part of the Russian delegation in Riyadh with his presence signalling that Moscow is keen to emphasize the economic benefits of restoring ties.\n\nSpeaking to Russian media outlets Tuesday, Dmitriev estimates that \"U.S. businesses lost around $300 billion from leaving Russia. So there is huge economic toll on many countries from you know what's happening right now, and we believe as a way forward is through solutions,\" he said, according to a news agency Interfax report.\n\nUkraine and Europe frozen out\n\nOfficials from Ukraine will not be present at the talks in Riyadh, Kyiv said, and European allies also remain frozen out of the discussions for now.\n\nKyiv's leadership has warned that it will not agree to any peace deal that goes against its interests, while European leaders warned at the Munich Security Conference last weekend that any agreement made without its involvement would not work.\n\nEuropean leaders held an emergency meeting in Paris on Monday where they agreed on the need to sharply increase defense spending but could not agree on whether to send peacekeeping troops to Ukraine as part of a post-war plan.\n\nThe U.K. has said it is willing to send peacekeeping troops to Ukraine but said the U.S. would need to provide a \"backstop\" to support the deployment, while Denmark and France signaled a willingness to consider sending troops to the country.\n\nTom Nicholson | Getty Images\n\nOther nations, including some of Ukraine's biggest backers, Poland and Germany, are wary, however. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz was openly critical of the idea, calling it \"completely premature\" and \"highly inappropriate\" while the leaders of Italy, Spain and Norway appeared to be more cynical about the idea.\n\nAnxious to remain close to President Trump, U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer is due to meet the president next week, while French President Emmanuel Macron said he'd spoken to Trump and Zelenskyy after the emergency summit.\n\n\"We seek a strong and lasting peace in Ukraine. To achieve this, Russia must end its aggression, and this must be accompanied by strong and credible security guarantees for the Ukrainians. Otherwise, there is a risk that this ceasefire will end up like the Minsk agreements. We will work on this together with all Europeans, Americans, and Ukrainians. This is the key,\" Macron said on social media platform X.",

The spokesperson said the Feb. 18 date was rescheduled to Feb. 19 also because of the high wind conditions.\n\n“After careful consideration and out of an abundance of caution, the departure of the SS United States from Philadelphia has been rescheduled for Wednesday, Feb. 19, 2025 due to persisting high wind conditions. She will begin moving south down the Delaware River at low tide at 12:51 p.m. Tug boats will begin to position her off of pier 80 two to three hours before low tide,” the spokesperson wrote. “Once she departs, you can track her progress to Mobile, Alabama at https://www.destinfwb.com/explore/eco-tourism/ssus/.”\n\nGet top local stories in Philly delivered to you every morning.

On its maiden voyage in 1952, it shattered the transatlantic speed record in both directions, when it reached an average speed of 36 knots, or just over 41 mph (66 kph), The Associated Press reported from aboard the ship.\n\nOn that voyage, the ship crossed the Atlantic in three days, 10 hours and 40 minutes, besting the RMS Queen Mary’s time by 10 hours.\n\nTo this day, the SS United States holds the transatlantic speed record for an ocean liner.\n\n\n\nIt became a reserve ship in 1969 and later bounced to various private owners who hoped to redevelop it but eventually found their plans to be too expensive or poorly timed.\n\nIt has loomed for years on South Philadelphia’s Delaware waterfront. During that time, there was an ongoing rent dispute between the ship’s conservancy and its landlord, Penn Warehousing. The dispute stemmed from an August 2021 decision by Penn Warehousing to double the ship’s daily dockage to $1,700, an increase the conservancy refused to accept. When the conservancy continued to pay its previous rate, set in 2011, Penn Warehousing terminated the lease in March 2022.\n\nThe ship was then purchased by Okaloosa County, Florida, for $10 million in October 2024.\n\nOnce the ship is actually moved, it will travel via multiple tugboats to Mobile, Alabama, where it will begin a year-long transformation into an artificial reef, with workers removing any non-metal parts and fuel that could be hazardous to sea life.\n\nThe exact location in the Gulf of Mexico for the ship’s deployment has not yet been determined but it’s expected to be about 20 miles south of the Florida Panhandle region in the Destin-Forth Walton Beach area.\n\n\n\nFor more information about the history of the SS United States, visit www.ssusc.org.",

        "fullContent": "The Eagles had a parade on Broad Street on Friday but they also took care of some business.\n\nThey signed 13 players to futures contracts on Friday. Futures contracts are for players who were not on a 53-man roster at the conclusion of the regular season. These contracts will count toward the 90-man roster when the new league year begins in March.\n\nOf these 13 players, 12 were on the Eagles practice squad in the lead up to the Super Bowl. The only one that wasn’t (WR Elijah Cooks) was on the practice squad for a week in January.\n\nLet’s take a closer look:\n\nGet top local stories in Philly delivered to you every morning. Sign up for NBC Philadelphia's News Headlines newsletter.\n\nDB Tariq Castro-Fields: Castro-Fields (6-1, 197) spent a lot of the 2024 season on the Eagles’ practice squad. He was a 6th-round pick out of Penn State in 2022, taken by the 49ers. Castro-Fields actually played in 10 games with 1 start for the Commanders in 2022 and 2023 and in 2024 played in 2 games with the Carolina Panthers. In his NFL career, Castro-Fields has played 27 snaps on defense and 109 on special teams. He has not appeared in a game for the Eagles.\n\nWR Elijah Cooks: Cooks (6-4, 215) went undrafted out of San Jose State in 2023. He was with the Jaguars and played in 11 games over two seasons. He had 3 catches for 38 yards in those games. Cooks began his college career at Nevada but in his one year at San Jose State had 69 catches for 1,076 yards and 10 touchdowns. Cooks was with the Eagles’ practice squad for a week in January.\n\nRB Tyrion Davis-Price: After being taken in the 3rd round of the 2022 draft out of LSU, Davis-Price played in just 7 games in 2022 and 2023 with the 49ers before getting cut. He spent this past season on the Eagles’ practice squad and played in one game. He had 3 carries for 7 yards on Dec. 29 against the Cowboys. In the preseason, Davis-Price had 22 carries for 118 yards.\n\nLB Dallas Gant: Gant (6-2, 224) went undrafted out of Toledo in 2024 after previously playing at Ohio State. He was with the Vikings in training camp and spent the first couple months on their practice squad before getting released and joining the Eagles’ practice squad. Gant was elevated for two games — the final two of the regular season. He played 26 snaps on special teams.\n\nWR Danny Gray: Another former 49ers pick, Gray was selected in the 3rd round out of SMU in 2022. Gray (6-0, 200) played in 13 games as a rookie and had 1 catch for 10 yards. Gray had a productive couple seasons at SMU as a receiver and return man. Gray has track speed; he ran a 4.33 at the combine.\n\nDT Gabe Hall: The Eagles signed Hall (6-6, 295) as an undrafted free agent out of Baylor this season. He spent the entire year on the Eagles’ practice squad. Hall made some plays in training camp as a rookie and is worth taking a look at in Year 2.\n\nDE K.J. Henry: The Commanders drafted Henry (6-4, 255) in the 5th round out of Clemson in the 2023 draft. In the last two years (with the Commanders, Bengals and Cowboys) Henry has played in 14 games with 3 starts and has 2 1/2 sacks. He has also played 144 special teams snaps. Henry has not played in a game for the Eagles.\n\nLB Ochaun Mathis: The Rams drafted Mathis (6-5, 260) in the 6th round out of Nebraska in the 2023 draft. Mathis played in the Baltimore game in 2024 and had 9 special teams snaps. In his NFL career, Mathis has played in 14 games.\n\nTE Nick Muse: The Eagles didn’t sign Muse (6-5, 252) to their practice squad until January. The Vikings selected him in the 7th round out of South Carolina in 2022. He played in 16 games over three seasons with the Vikings and had 1 catch for 22 yards.\n\nDB Parry Nickerson: The Eagles kept the 30-year-old veteran around all season after a strong training camp. Nickerson has played in 30 games with 3 starts in his NFL career and was with Vic Fangio in Miami in 2023, playing five games for the Dolphins.\n\nDB Andre’ Sam: Everyone knew it was Saquon Barkley and Cooper DeJean’s birthday on Super Bowl Sunday but it was also Sam’s birthday! Sam turned 26 as the Eagles beat the Chiefs. Sam played in one game this season against the Panthers; 12 special teams snaps.\n\nOT Laekin Vakalahi: The Eagles had an international exemption for Vakalahi, who is from Australia. He was the 17th member of the practice squad all season and will have another exemption spot in 2025.\n\nDB A.J. Woods: Woods (5-9, 186) went undrafted out of Pitt in 2024. He initially signed with the Commanders and signed with the Eagles’ practice squad in early September. He didn’t see any game action in 2024.\n\nSubscribe to Eagle Eye anywhere you get your podcasts:\n\nApple Podcasts | YouTube Music | Spotify | Stitcher | Simplecast | RSS | Watch on YouTube",

Those firings were the latest in a governmentwide effort to reduce the federal workforce.\n\nGet top local stories in Philly delivered to you every morning. Sign up for NBC Philadelphia's News Headlines newsletter.\n\nThis week, the three sources told NBC News, career employees at high managerial levels, namely Senior Executive Service and General Schedule 15 employees, may be removed from agencies across DHS — not to reduce the size of the workforce but to remove employees whom the administration sees as potentially standing in the way of goals the Trump administration has for the agency.\n\nDHS, which includes Customs and Border Protection and Immigration and Customs Enforcement, is the primary agency tasked with enforcing U.S. immigration law. Trump has relied heavily on CBP to secure the southwest border and on ICE to ramp up arrests and deportations of undocumented immigrants living in the United States.\n\nThe employees at those high levels “are career people who have an influence on policy and strategy in those positions,” said a former senior Biden administration official, responding to news of the plan.\n\nPresident Donald Trump signed a memorandum Thursday which seeks to impose \"fair and reciprocal\" trade tariffs on all major U.S. trading partners, including longtime allies.\n\nA Trump administration official defended the plan. Asked whether reducing the positions would make it harder for DHS to make good on Trump’s immigration goals, the administration official said the administration is removing people who it believes “willfully grind things to a halt.”\n\n“These people put themselves in a terrible position, and they need to be removed,” the Trump administration official said.\n\nSpokespeople for DHS and the White House did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nYamiche Alcindor contributed.\n\nThis article first appeared on NBCNews.com.

        "fullContent": "Michelle King, the top official at the Social Security Administration, left her position this weekend after she refused a request from Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency to access sensitive government records at the agency, according to two sources familiar with the situation who spoke to NBC News.\n\nWhite House spokesperson Harrison Fields confirmed that King was no longer the head of the agency in a statement.\n\n“President Trump has nominated the highly qualified and talented Frank Bisignano to lead the Social Security Administration, and we expect him to be swiftly confirmed in the coming weeks. In the meantime, the agency will be led by a career Social Security anti-fraud expert as the acting commissioner. President Trump is committed to appointing the best and most qualified individuals who are dedicated to working on behalf of the American people, not to appease the bureaucracy that has failed them for far too long,” Fields said.\n\nThe Washington Post was first to report King’s departure.\n\nGet top local stories in Philly delivered to you every morning. Sign up for NBC Philadelphia's News Headlines newsletter.\n\nOne of the sources familiar with the situation, Nancy Altman, president of Social Security Works, a left-leaning group focused on protecting and expanding Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, told NBC News she learned of the situation after speaking with several current officials at the agency.\n\nAltman said some of the information involved in the dispute included Americans’ bank information, social security numbers, earnings records, marital statuses, dates of birth and in some cases medical records if a person has applied for disability benefits.\n\n“She was replaced as acting commissioner because she would not give access to the sensitive information,” Altman said of King. “So, she was replaced with someone who presumably will. But she was not forced to leave the agency. That was her choice. It was the White House’s choice to not let her be head of the agency anymore.”\n\nPresident Donald Trump has appointed Leland Dudek, a manager in charge of Social Security’s anti-fraud office, as acting commissioner of the Social Security Administration now that King is out.\n\nAltman slammed DOGE’s request of King and the Social Security Administration.\n\n“I don’t think you can overstate how serious this breach is,” Altman said. “The information that the Social Security Administration has is a lot of personal data that most people would like to keep private and they entrusted to the government through tax returns and through their employers sending in earning statements. The assumption is that the government will be very careful with it.”\n\nKing, who has worked at the Social Security Administration for decades, has chosen to retire, Altman said.\n\nThe SSA did not immediately return a request for comment.\n\nKing’s departure is the latest in a wave of exits from senior officials whose agencies have come into DOGE’s crosshairs.\n\nThe agency is in charge of managing payments for more than 70 million Americans. Trump has vowed not to enact cuts to retirement benefits.\n\nIn an interview with Fox News, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt confirmed that the president \"has directed Elon Musk and the DOGE team to identify fraud at the Social Security Administration.\" She said that while the team hadn't \"dug into the books,\" they suspected that widespread fraud was occurring.\n\nThe SSA's inspector general released a report in July that found between 2015 and 2022, only .84% of benefits payments were improper.\n\nThis is not the first time DOGE has drawn scrutiny over attempts to access sensitive information. A DOGE-affiliated employee at the Internal Revenue Service is expected to seek access to an IRS system housing sensitive taxpayer information, an administration official told NBC News on Sunday.\n\nDOGE additionally accessed the Treasury Department’s payment system earlier this month, which stores Social Security numbers and other confidential financial information. Several lawsuits were then filed claiming that DOGE’s access to this data violated federal privacy laws. Justice Department attorneys subsequently agreed to temporarily restrict DOGE’s access to the Treasury Department’s systems, save for two employees given “read only” access “as needed.”\n\nA judge later temporarily blocked political appointees and special government employees — including those who work at DOGE — from accessing sensitive and confidential information stored within the treasury.\n\nHomeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem also said this month that Trump authorized Musk to access disaster data housed within FEMA.\n\nThis article first appeared on NBCNews.com.

        "fullContent": "Egypt is developing a plan to rebuild Gaza without forcing Palestinians out of the strip in a counter to President Donald Trump’s proposal to depopulate the territory so the U.S. can take it over.\n\nEgypt’s state-run Al-Ahram newspaper said the proposal calls for establishing “secure areas” within Gaza where Palestinians can live initially while Egyptian and international construction firms remove and rehabilitate the strip’s infrastructure.\n\nEgyptian officials have been discussing the plan with European diplomats as well as with Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates, according to two Egyptian officials and Arab and Western diplomats. They are also discussing ways to fund the reconstruction, including an international conference on Gaza reconstruction, said one of the Egyptian officials and an Arab diplomat.\n\nThe officials and diplomats spoke on condition of anonymity because the proposal is still being negotiated.\n\nGet top local stories in Philly delivered to you every morning. Sign up for NBC Philadelphia's News Headlines newsletter.\n\nThe proposal comes after an international uproar over Trump’s call for the removal of Gaza’s population of some 2 million Palestinians. Trump said the United States would take over the Gaza Strip and rebuild it into a “Riviera of the Middle East,” though Palestinians would not be allowed back.\n\nPalestinians have widely said they will not leave their homeland, while Egypt, Jordan – backed by Saudi Arabia – have refused Trump’s calls for them to take in Gaza’s population. Rights groups have widely said the plan amounts to forced expulsion, a potential war crime. European countries have also largely denounced Trump’s plan. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has praised the idea and says Israel is preparing to implement it.\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who was in Saudi Arabia on Monday in a tour of the region, has said the United States was up to hearing alternative proposals. “If the Arab countries have a better plan, then that’s great,” Rubio said Thursday on the U.S. radio program “Clay and Buck Show.”\n\nEgypt’s Al-Ahram newspaper said the proposal is designed to “refute American President Trump’s logic” and counter “any other visions or plans that aim to change the geographic and demographic structure of Gaza Strip.”\n\nGaza is nearing a critical juncture with the first phase of a ceasefire due to run out in early March. Israel and Hamas must still negotiate a second phase meant to bring a release of all remaining hostages held by the militants, a full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and a long-term halt to the war.\n\nAny reconstruction plan will be impossible to implement without a deal on the second phase, including an agreement on who will govern Gaza in the long term. Israel demands the elimination of Hamas as a political or military force in the territory, and international donors are unlikely to contribute to any rebuilding if Hamas is in charge.\n\nCentral in Egypt’s proposal is the establishment of a Palestinian administration that is not aligned with either Hamas or the Palestinian Authority to run the strip and oversee the reconstruction efforts, according to the two Egyptian officials involved in the efforts.\n\nIt also calls for a Palestinian police force mainly made up of former Palestinian Authority policemen who remained in Gaza after Hamas took over the enclave in 2007, with reinforcement from Egyptian- and Western-trained forces.\n\nPresident Donald Trump said at an Oval Office meeting Tuesday with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that the U.S. should take control of the Gaza Strip.\n\nAsked about the possibility of deploying an Arab force in Gaza one Egyptian official and the Arab diplomat said Arab countries would only agree if there were a “clear path” for the establishment of an independent Palestinian state. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has rejected any Palestinian state as well as any role for Hamas or the Western-backed Palestinian Authority in governing Gaza, though he has not put forward any clear alternative.\n\nHamas has said it is willing to give up power in Gaza. Hamas spokesman Abdul Latif al-Qanou told The Associated Press on Sunday that the group has accepted either a Palestinian unity government without Hamas’ participation or a committee of technocrats to run the territory. The Palestinian Authority, which governs pockets of the West Bank, has so far opposed any plans for Gaza that exclude it.\n\nThe Western diplomat said France and Germany have backed the idea of Arab countries developing a counterproposal to Trump’s plan, and that Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi discussed his government's efforts with the French president in a phone call earlier this month.\n\nEgyptian Foreign Minister Badr Abdelatty also briefed the German foreign minister and other EU officials on the sidelines of last week’s Munich security conference, one of the Egyptian officials said.\n\nOfficials from Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates and Jordan will discuss Egypt’s proposal at a gathering in Riyadh this week, before introducing it to the Arab summit later this month, according to the two Egyptian officials and the Arab diplomat.\n\nIsarel’s 16-month campaign in Gaza, triggered by Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023 attack, devastated the territory. Around a quarter million housing units have been destroyed or damaged, according to U.N. estimates. More than 90% of the roads and more than 80% of health facilities have been damaged or destroyed. Damage to infrastructure has been estimated at some $30 billion, along with an estimated $16 billion in damaged to housing.\n\nEgypt’s plan calls for a three-phase reconstruction process that will take up to five years without removing Palestinians from Gaza, the Egyptian officials said.\n\nIt designates three “safe zones” within Gaza to relocate Palestinians during an initial six-month “early recovery period.” The zones will be equipped with mobile houses and shelters, with humanitarian aid streaming in.\n\nMore than two dozen Egyptian and international firms would take part in removing the rubble and rebuilding the strip’s infrastructure. The reconstruction would provide tens of thousands of jobs to Gaza’s population, the officials said.",

        "fullContent": "As work crews race to clear debris from thousands of homes and businesses destroyed in last month’s wildfires in Los Angeles, residents are grappling with whether they can afford to stay in a region where real estate prices were already out of reach for many people.\n\nDisplaced homeowners and renters are facing an economic landscape rife with long-standing affordability and equity concerns, illuminating the gulf between those who can afford to start over from scratch and those who cannot.\n\n“It’s intimidating,” said Kaitlyn Little, who grew up in Pacific Palisades, one of hundreds of distinct neighborhoods that make up the city of Los Angeles. “It just reinforces the feelings of uncertainty and uneasiness about what the future of that town really does look like.”\n\nThe last photo taken of Kaitlyn Little and her 2-year-old son before their condo burned down last month.

Sign up for NBC Philadelphia's News Headlines newsletter.\n\nLittle lost the Palisades condominium she shared with her husband and their 2-year-old child in the Jan. 7 fires that razed entire communities. At least 29 people were killed in the multiday siege, and more than 16,000 structures, the majority residences, were destroyed.\n\nNow, Little finds herself in a market where the average home price in Los Angeles County is just shy of $1 million and the average rent is nearly $3,000, according to Zillow. State and local leaders have warned against price gouging, but displaced families said they are already feeling the pinch.\n\nAt this point, Little said, she cannot afford to rebuild, much less buy a home.\n\n“Our renters insurance doesn’t begin to cover the cost of what was lost,” she said.\n\nAmid the devastating wildfires ravaging Southern California, Angelenos have found an important lifeline in the nonprofit app Watch Duty. Founder John Mills dials-in and explains how banding together information from radio operators who listen to firefighters talking on the ground has helped millions of Los Angeles residents stay up to date on evacuation orders, fire updates and more.\n\nLike many survivors, Little did not have time to pack before evacuating. She ran out of the condominium she rented with the clothes on her back and three diapers. She thought she would return home in a few hours.\n\nAfter completing seemingly endless paperwork, Little received a $16,000 payout. She is attempting to stretch that out to cover moving into a new apartment and buying new clothes and essentials for her family of three.\n\nShe yearns to return to the Palisades after it is rebuilt, but worries that rising rents could force her and her family to relocate permanently.\n\n“Going back is the dream, but there are so many factors at play,” she said. “What does it look like a year from now and how are the schools going to be?”\n\nEconomic losses reach $250 billion\n\nEarly estimates of the total economic loss from the fires have soared to $250 billion. According to a recent economic impact study by the University of California, Los Angeles, areas near the burn zones could suffer wage losses of nearly $300 million because so many businesses were destroyed and few customers are around to patronize those that survived.\n\nThe study also confirmed what most people already knew: The housing market will become more unaffordable in coming years, and rentals, already in short supply before the fires, will become even pricier.\n\n“The reduction in the supply of housing is going to raise prices,” said Adam Rose, senior research fellow and director emeritus of the Center for Risk and Economic Analysis of Threats and Emergencies at the University of Southern California. “The only thing that’s going to offset that is if people move elsewhere.”\n\nState and local leaders have expedited recovery efforts by waiving permits and lifting some environmental regulations. But the rush to rebuild is already leaving some survivors in the dust.\n\nThe Sayegh family lost seven properties when the Eaton Fire ripped through Altadena. \"Almost everyone here lost their home or business,\" Freddy Sayegh said. (Courtesy Freddy Sayegh)\n\n“This is gonna be a long, tough, difficult road,” said Altadena resident Freddy Sayegh, whose extended family lost a total of seven properties in the Eaton Fire.\n\n“What we don’t want is unscrupulous developers coming in here trying to build and make a profit and increase the home prices, decreasing the ability to have affordable housing.”\n\nIn the weeks since the fire, Sayegh, his wife and two children have bounced from one short-term rental to the next. He now drives more than an hour to drop his kids off at school and continues to look for a house or apartment to rent that he can afford. His law office was badly smoke damaged and several businesses owned by his family, including an auto parts store and a gas station, were destroyed, he said.\n\nHis homeowners insurance payout will cover smoke remediation, a timely and painstaking process to remove toxic particles and soot from his ranch-style home. But his commercial properties near north Lake Avenue, a busy thoroughfare consumed by the fire, were underinsured and Sayegh anticipates his payout will not be enough to rebuild.\n\nWhile he waits to meet with adjusters to determine how much he will receive, Sayegh is helping to organize a coalition of Altadena residents and businesses that will work to make the rebuilding effort affordable and attainable for longtime community members. The group will operate like a labor union, negotiating with builders and architects for the best prices on large-scale construction projects, he said.\n\nAlthough wildfires occur naturally, climate change amplifies their intensity and how quickly they can spread. Meteorologist Chase Cain explains two of the strongest links between climate change and the wildfire emergency in Southern California.\n\nAltadena resident Maria Shufeldt said the homeowner-focused effort may not do much to help her. The building where she rented an apartment for 13 years withstood the flames but was badly damaged by smoke. She shuffled through three different hotels as she hunted for a rental.\n\nShe spent much of Thursday afternoon speaking with the Red Cross and the Federal Emergency Management Agency in hopes of extending her hotel stay until her new apartment is ready. The whole recovery experience has left her numb and exhausted.\n\n“It completely makes you almost not able to function in real life, because you’re constantly dealing with what’s next,” she said.\n\n'Death of the American dream'\n\nEven homeowners in tony Pacific Palisades face displacement. Blake Mallen, an entrepreneur, lived in a home valued at more than $3 million near the trailhead where the Palisades Fire was first reported. The five-bedroom, five-bathroom home was paid off in full, but Mallen was one of some 1,600 Palisades residents dropped by their homeowners insurance companies last year amid soaring costs and an increasing risk of wildfires.\n\nHe attempted to supplement his homeowners insurance through California’s FAIR Plan, the state’s insurer of last resort, but was told he did not qualify because his home value was too high.\n\nWithout insurance, Mallen has been unable to recoup losses.\n\n“This is the death of the American dream,” he said. “We’re seeing the core of our community fragment.”\n\nMallen has spent much of the past five weeks on the phone with lawyers, hoping to find a loophole that will make him eligible for some kind of payout. For now, he is facing a total financial loss, he said. His home of seven years was not just where he and his wife raised their two children, it was their entire nest egg.\n\n“Right now, we couldn’t even rebuild if we wanted to,” he said, speaking from his rental house in L.A.’s Venice neighborhood. “Do I even want to rebuild a house that can’t get insurance?”\n\nResidents who can afford to rebuild also face uncertainty as tariffs and inflation threaten to increase the price of materials.\n\nIn Sunset Mesa, near Pacific Palisades, longtime resident Tom Reed said he plans to start construction to replace his destroyed home as soon as possible and is already negotiating the cost of an architect. Reed has carefully mapped out rental costs for the next three years to help stay within the budget dictated by his insurance payout. He and his wife are even renting furniture for their temporary apartment, instead of buying.\n\nWhile forging ahead, he said he knows some items lost in the fire can never be replaced. The amateur photographer estimates he lost some 100,000 negatives and photos when the Palisades Fire tore through his oceanside community.\n\n“As I tell people, you can’t look back. Let’s just look forward and keep going forward,” he said. “That’s all you can do.”\n\nThis story first appeared on NBCNews.com. More from NBC News:",

Sign up for NBC Philadelphia's News Headlines newsletter.\n\nA spokeswoman for the mayor, Kayla Mamelak, said Sunday that no deputy mayors have submitted resignations. However, on Monday City Hall issued a statement confirming the resignations.\n\n“Maria Torres-Springer, Anne Williams-Isom, Meera Joshi, and Chauncey Parker are extraordinary public servants who have been vital to our work reshaping New York City,\" the mayor's office said in a statement Monday. \"Together, we’ve broken housing records, created the most jobs in the city’s history, provided for hundreds of thousands of longtime New Yorkers and migrants, built unprecedented public spaces, and made our city safer at every level. New Yorkers owe them an enormous debt of gratitude for their service to our city.\"\n\nThe statement goes on to say: “I am disappointed to see them go, but given the current challenges, I understand their decision and wish them nothing but success in the future.\n\n“But let me be crystal clear: New York City will keep moving forward, just as it does every day. All deputy mayors will remain in their roles for the time being to ensure a seamless transition. The people of New York City remain, without question, our top priority.\n\n“I am solely beholden to the 8.3 million New Yorkers I represent, and I will always put this city first — as I always have.”\n\nInitially, the two sources who attended the Sunday meeting said that three deputy mayors -- First Deputy Mayor Maria Torres Springer, Deputy Mayor for Operations Meera Joshi, and Deputy Mayor for Health and Human Services Anne Williams Isom -- had already told the mayor of their intention to step down during an in-person meeting at Gracie Mansion on Friday, according to a source with knowledge.\n\nThe senior aides expressed concerns about their ability to serve in the mayor’s administration after a controversial move by the Trump Justice Department to temporarily set aside criminal charges against Adams.\n\nNew York Gov. Kathy Hochul released a statement Monday night expressing concern the deputy mayors felt they could not remain with the administration.\n\n\"If they feel unable to serve in City Hall at this time, that raises serious questions about the long-term future of this Mayoral administration,\" Hochul said. The governor has the constitutional ability to remove the mayor, though it has never happened in the city's history.\n\nA fourth deputy mayor - Chauncey Parker - who oversees public safety had told the mayor’s office of his desire to leave and was also on the call Sunday, according to a source familiar.\n\nDue to the extraordinary events of the last few weeks and to stay faithful to the oaths we swore to New Yorkers and our families, we have come to the difficult decision to step down from our roles. Maria Torres-Springer, Anne Williams-Isom, and Meera Joshi\n\nAnother source familiar with the deputy mayors' conversations, however, said the three deputy mayors who told Adams Friday of their intention to resign made it clear again on the Sunday call that it was still their intention to depart in late March.\n\nOn Monday, Torres-Springer, Williams-Isom and Joshi put out a joint statement in which they described serving as deputy mayors as \"the greatest honor and privilege of our lives.\"\n\n\"We have worked each day with the singular mission of improving the lives of New Yorkers and strengthening the physical foundation of the city we love,\" their joint statement reads. \"Due to the extraordinary events of the last few weeks and to stay faithful to the oaths we swore to New Yorkers and our families, we have come to the difficult decision to step down from our roles. While our time in this administration will come to a close, our support for the incredible public servants across the administration with whom we have stood shoulder to shoulder and our championing of this great city and all it stands for will never cease. We sincerely thank the mayor for giving us the opportunity to serve New Yorkers in these roles, stand ready to ensure a smooth transition of our duties, and wish Mayor Adams and all of our colleagues much strength and courage in the work ahead.”\n\nMeanwhile, in a separate statement, Parker said: \"Serving as deputy mayor for public safety under Mayor Adams has been an honor of a lifetime. Together, we have made our streets safer, more just, and have improved quality of life for all New Yorkers. I am confident that the administration will continue on our mission to deliver for the people of this city.”\n\nProtesters amassed in Lower Manhattan Sunday urging Gov. Kathy Hochul to step in and remove Adams as mayor of New York City, alleging he's being held hostage by a quid pro quo deal with the Trump administration in an effort to have his criminal corruption case dismissed, as a top federal prosecutor alleged before they resigned in protest.\n\nDozens of people braved the cold once more Monday to protest for the second day in a row and ask Hochul to remove Adams.\n\nNew York City Council Speaker Adrienne Adams (who is not related to the mayor) called on the mayor to resign Monday following news of the deputy mayors' departure.\n\n“With the resignation of deputy mayors, it has become clear that Mayor Adams has now lost the confidence and trust of his own staff, his colleagues in government, and New Yorkers. He now must prioritize New York City and New Yorkers, step aside and resign,\" speaker Adams said in a statement. \"This administration no longer has the ability to effectively govern with Eric Adams as mayor. These resignations are the culmination of the mayor’s actions and decisions that have led to months of instability and now compromise the City’s sovereignty, threaten chaos, and risk harm to our families. There is too much at stake for our city and New Yorkers to allow this to continue. We have endured enough scandal, selfishness and embarrassment, all of which distract from the leadership that New Yorkers deserve. This is the opposite of public service. Our city needs a leader totally committed to protecting New Yorkers and improving their lives.”\n\nHochul said she plans to meet with \"key leaders\" in her Manhattan office on Tuesday to discuss the next steps for the city.\n\n\"The alleged conduct at City Hall that has been reported over the past two weeks is troubling and cannot be ignored. Tomorrow, I have asked key leaders to meet me at my Manhattan office for a conversation about the path forward, with the goal of ensuring stability for the City of New York,\" Hochul said.\n\nMeanwhile, also on Monday, community and clergy leaders, along with supporters of Adams, gathered at Rehoboth Cathedral in Brooklyn to show solidarity for Adams. The mayor spoke at this event, defending himself, while saying that those who are calling for him to resign are mistaken because he is not stepping down.\n\n\"I ignore the noise, because I know what we have accomplished,\" he said.\n\nThe mayor went on to say that there is \"inconsistency\" in what his opponents are saying.\n\n\"They are trying to rewrite my entire history with their own agenda,\" he said.\n\nRead Gov. Kathy Hochul's full Monday night statement\n\nNew York Gov. Kathy Hochul released a statement Monday night:\n\n“Since taking office in 2021, I’ve done everything possible to partner with the City of New York under the leadership of two different mayors. We’ve worked together to fight crime on the streets and subways, close illegal cannabis shops and build more housing through ‘City of Yes’. Bickering between State and City officials is a waste of time and I refuse to go back to the days where our constituents are caught in the crossfire of political turf wars.\n\n“Earlier today I spoke with First Deputy Mayor Maria Torres-Springer to express my gratitude for her years of service to New York City. She, along with Deputy Mayors Anne Williams-Isom, Meera Joshi and Chauncey Parker, have been strong partners with my Administration across dozens of key issues. If they feel unable to serve in City Hall at this time, that raises serious questions about the long-term future of this Mayoral administration.\n\n“I recognize the immense responsibility I hold as governor and the constitutional powers granted to this office. In the 235 years of New York State history, these powers have never been utilized to remove a duly-elected mayor; overturning the will of the voters is a serious step that should not be taken lightly. That said, the alleged conduct at City Hall that has been reported over the past two weeks is troubling and cannot be ignored. Tomorrow, I have asked key leaders to meet me at my Manhattan office for a conversation about the path forward, with the goal of ensuring stability for the City of New York.\n\n“Let me be clear: my most urgent concern is the well-being of my 8.3 million constituents who live in New York City. I will be monitoring this situation extraordinarily closely to ensure that New Yorkers are not being shortchanged by the current crisis in City government.”",

        "fullContent": "The greatest pass of Jalen Hurts’ life, the first parade in Philadelphia history and a look at Josh Sweat’s future.\n\nRoob’s 10 Random Eagles Observations have now morphed into Roob’s 10 Random Eagles Offseason Observations, and that’s what they’ll remain until training camp starts in a little over five months.\n\nWow, that’s soon.\n\n1A. That dagger 46-yard touchdown to DeVonta Smith may have been Jalen Hurts’ greatest pass ever and certainly one of the greatest Super Bowl touchdowns ever. I’ve watched this one more than any play since 4th and 26, easily over 100 times, and it never ceases to astonish me. The Eagles already led 27-0 and had a 1st-and-10 on the Chiefs’ 46-yard-line after Avonte Maddox’s 4th-down pass breakup early in the third round quarter. Start with DeVonta, who separates from Chiefs corner Jaylen Watson right off the line of scrimmage. Watson tries to get a jam on Smith but can’t, and Smith just runs unimpeded at full speed down the field toward the end zone. Hurts has incredible protection on the play from his o-line and also Saquon Barkley and backup tight end Grant Calcaterra, who both pick up blitzes. He play-fakes to Barkley and when he unloads, there isn’t a Chief within five feet of him. He’s got a clean pocket to work in, and he takes time to get his feet under him, set and fire. Smith first turns around to look for the ball at the 30-yard-line, which is a split second before Hurts releases it. Smith never breaks stride. Never slows down. Their timing is perfect. And Smith doesn’t do anything to let Watson know the ball is on the way. Watson never turns around and never makes up that step that DeVonta has on him. Smith doesn’t have to move his hands until just before the ball arrives because the ball is heading precisely into his grasp. Smith jumps just a bit as he crosses the plane of the end zone and catches the ball a little off the ground. Watson immediately tackles Smith and tries to pry the ball away, but Smith wasn’t about to let go as he tumbles to the ground. Touchdown Eagles and a 34-0 lead. Smith and Hurts have known each other since Smith was in high school and Hurts was his host during his visit to Alabama. They’ve both talked often about how instead of partying they went to the football facility and threw and studied film. They’ve taken countless reps together since then, spent innumerable hours studying, thrown with each other every offseason. They’ve both put an insane amount of time together working toward this one moment, and on the biggest stage they showed what football perfection looks like.\n\nGet top local stories in Philly delivered to you every morning.

If you don’t think Sirianni has anything to do with the offense, that’s a must-see video. Sirianni kicked himself after Super Bowl LVII for not being aggressive enough, and he just wasn’t going to let it happen again. Brilliant.\n\n1C. The other unbelievable thing about that play — and you can see this in the end zone copy — is how quickly Saquon Barkley raises his fist. The ball is still on its upward trajectory and Saquon is already celebrating.\n\n2A. Nick Sirianni is only the second coach in NFL history to win six playoff games in his first four seasons. Joe Gibbs won six with Washington from 1981 through 1984. Tom Flores, John Fox, Mike Tomlin, Paul Brown, George Seifert and Bill Parcells each won five.\n\n2B. The Eagles won six playoff games from 1961 through 1999. They’ve won six playoff games since 2022.\n\n3. An underrated facet of the Eagles’ monster defensive performance last Sunday was the way they shut down the Chiefs’ running game while Kansas City was still trying to run the ball. The Chiefs were 3-for-3 rushing in the first half and they were 6-for-17 at the point the Eagles went up 34-0. They didn’t have a run from scrimmage longer than eight yards and Patrick Mahomes had a couple scrambles late, but the Chiefs’ running backs netted 24 total yards, 4th-fewest in Super Bowl history behind the 1985 Broncos (8), 2002 Raiders (16) and 1974 Vikings (17). The Chiefs realized early they couldn’t run against the Eagles, and Andy Reid stopped even trying while the game was still somewhat close. That let the Eagles’ defensive front tee off on the Chiefs’ hapless offensive line. Isiah Pacheco, who gashed the Eagles for 76 yards on 15 carries in Super Bowl LVII two years ago, ran three times for seven yards, and Kareem Hunt, who had a bounce-back season with 728 yards and seven TDs, managed nine yards on three carries. This defensive front is dangerous enough against a balanced offense. When it knows the other team is going to throw? Forget it. You have no shot.\n\n4. The first championship parade in Philadelphia history took place on Nov. 5, 1910, two weeks after the Athletics finished off the Cubs with a 7-2 win in Game 5 of the World Series at Chicago’s West Side Grounds. The parade route went south on Broad Street, starting at Montgomery, around the west side of City Hall, then south to Wolf Street. This was an evening parade, starting at 8 p.m. According to the Nov. 7, 1910, Inquirer “nearly a million” people watched, although according to the Delaware County Times, “The spectacle was witnessed by 100,000 persons.” I’m guessing the Inquirer’s estimate was closer to the actual attendance. A non-bylined columnist wrote: “The tribe of (Connie) Mack had brought distinction to the good, old town and everyone seemed imbued with the desire to give some expression of their appreciation. Everybody was there and everybody was happy.” Some things never change.\n\n5. Quarterbacks who’ve put up at least 33 points in multiple Super Bowls: Bart Starr, Joe Montana, Tom Brady, Jalen Hurts.\n\n6. Jake Elliott’s revival is one of the coolest stories of the 2024 postseason. He was so unreliable during the regular season, missing eight field goal attempts and going 1-for-7 from 50 yards and out (the rest of the league made 71 percent) and then he missed three PATs the first two weeks of the postseason, the second kicker in NFL history to miss three PATs in a single postseason, and then missed a 54-yarder in the NFC Championship Game. Not a chip shot but a 73 percent kick league-wide this year. So it wasn’t easy to be super confident in Elliott heading into the Super Bowl, although he was money in his first two. As a rookie, he made incredibly high-pressure kicks from 42 and 46 yards in the fourth quarter of Super Bowl LII in Minneapolis and then two years ago he was 2-for-2 in Glendale in Super Bowl LVII. So what does he do Sunday? After going 3-for-9 from 48 yards and out during the regular season, he matches his entire season total of 48-yard kicks with field goals from 48, 48 and 50 yards. He became the first kicker ever with three field goals of at least 48 yards in the same Super Bowl and only the second with three career 48-yarders in a Super Bowl. Elliott is now responsible for three of the 14-longest Super Bowl field goals ever and his 9-for-9 in Super Bowls is the best ever. Overall, Elliott was 10-for-11 this postseason, and he’s now 26-for-27 in his career in the postseason for 96.3 percent, 2nd-highest ever (minimum 20 attempts) behind Robbie Gould’s 29-for-29. Who he can’t catch. Elliott is one of only seven kickers to play in three Super Bowls and along with Lane Johnson, Brandon Graham and Rick Lovato, he’s one of four Eagles to win two Super Bowls. A month ago, what to do with Elliott seemed like it would be a huge question this offseason. But he proved he’s still got it, and he did it in some high-leverage situations. After that performance? He’s not going anywhere.\n\n7. Somebody needs to explain Josh Sweat’s last couple years to me. Coming off his 11-sack 2022 season, he opens 2023 with a dominating 6 ½ sacks in his first nine games, then goes 12 straight games over the 2023 and 2024 seasons without a sack. Starting in Week 4 this year, he picks up seven sacks in eight games and looks unstoppable again, then gets one sack in his next eight games. Going into the Super Bowl you know Brandon Graham isn’t going to play much, Bryce Huff will be inactive and Sweat is in another lengthy slump, and you’re thinking Nolan Smith is the only edge guy who’s going to be able to generate pressure. Then all Sweat does in Super Bowl LIX is record a career-high 2 ½ sacks – 5th-most in Super Bowl history – along with two QB hits and two tackles for loss. He picked the biggest game of his life for the best game of his life. Remember how Derrick Burgess parlayed a huge NFC Championship Game in 2004 against Michael Vick and the Falcons into a huge (at the time) five-year, $17.5 million contract with the Raiders? Burgess only had 2 ½ sacks during the 2004 regular season but had 3.0 in the playoffs. Obviously, Sweat’s production is beyond Burgess’s, but the dynamic is similar. An edge rusher who made himself a ton of money with a huge postseason. Everybody is looking for edge rushers, and with Smith having a breakthrough season and Jalyx Hunt popping late in the season – 1 ½ sacks , three QB hits and one tackle for loss in the regular season, 1 ½ sacks, three QB hits and one tackle for loss in the playoffs – I could see the Eagles going with those two plus a high draft pick in their edge rotation and not over-paying to keep Sweat. And because of his contract, Huff will still be here and get an opportunity to find a spot in the rotation as well. Sweat’s been a very good if inconsistent player during his seven years here. He’s 8th in Eagles history with 48 sacks, and he’s still only 27. Sweat says he wants to be here and expects to get something done, and I’m sure Howie Roseman would love to keep him. I’m just not sure the numbers will agree. If he hits the open market, he’s going to get offers the Eagles may not be able to match.\n\n8A. The last two Super Bowl-winning quarterbacks drafted outside the first round are Nick Foles and Jalen Hurts.\n\n8B. The Eagles are the only team in NFL history to draft two Super Bowl-winning quarterbacks outside the first round.\n\n8C. The only other teams that have drafted two QBs who’ve each won a Super Bowl for the team that drafted them are the Cowboys (Roger Staubach, Troy Aikman), Packers (Bart Starr, Aaron Rodgers), Giants (Phil Simms, Jeff Hostetler) and Steelers (Terry Bradshaw, Ben Roethlisberger).\n\n8D. Remember, the Falcons drafted Brett Favre, the Patriots drafted Jim Plunkett, the Steelers drafted Len Dawson, the Chargers drafted Eli Manning and the Buccaneers drafted Steve Young and Doug Williams.\n\n9A. Four interior linemen in Eagles history have had 2.0 or more sacks in a single postseason. One is Darwin Walker in 2006. The others are Jalen Carter, Milton Williams and Jordan Davis this year.\n\n9B. The Eagles are the first team in NFL history to have three interior linemen record multiple sacks in the same postseason. Only two teams – the 1992 and 1995 Cowboys – also had more than one – Tony Casillas and Russell Maryland in 1992 and Chad Hennings and Leon Lett in 1995. Both those Cowboys teams beat the Eagles in the conference semifinals.\n\n9C. Eagles interior defensive linemen had 13 ½ postseason sacks from 1982 – when sacks became an official NFL stat – through 2023. Eagles interior defensive linemen had 7.0 sacks this year. So 34 percent of the postseason sacks interior linemen have ever recorded for the Eagles came this year.\n\n10. Jalen Hurts had one passing touchdown and three rushing touchdowns in his first Super Bowl and two passing TDs and one rushing TD this time. His seven total touchdowns are most ever by a quarterback in his first two Super Bowls. Joe Montana previously had the most with five TDs in his first two Super Bowls. Only five quarterbacks have more career Super Bowl touchdowns than Hurts: Tom Brady (21), Montana (13), Patrick Mahomes (11), Terry Bradshaw (9) and Roger Staubach (8).\n\nSubscribe to Eagle Eye anywhere you get your podcasts:\n\nApple Podcasts | YouTube Music | Spotify | Stitcher | Simplecast | RSS | Watch on YouTube",

        "fullContent": "The Vatican on Tuesday canceled papal audiences through the weekend and delegated others to cover for Pope Francis as the 88-year-old pope remained hospitalized with a multi-pronged respiratory infection.\n\nThe cancellations put a damper on upcoming events of the Vatican’s big Holy Year, the once-every-quarter-century celebration of Catholicism that is aimed at encouraging pilgrims to come to Rome to participate in special Jubilee activities. Expected to draw some 30 million people to Rome, the Holy Year is packed with special papal audiences and Masses throughout 2025, some of which have now been put into question given Francis’ illness.\n\nFrancis was admitted to Rome’s Gemelli hospital in a “fair” condition on Friday after a weeklong bout of bronchitis worsened. On Monday, medical personnel determined that he was suffering from a polymicrobial respiratory tract infection, meaning a mix of viruses, bacteria and possibly other organisms had colonized in his respiratory tract. The Vatican has given no indication of how long he might remain hospitalized, only saying that the treatment of such a “complex clinical picture” would require an “adequate” stay.\n\nGet top local stories in Philly delivered to you every morning. Sign up for NBC Philadelphia's News Headlines newsletter.\n\nFrancis once again had a peaceful night, ate breakfast and read the newspapers Tuesday morning, Vatican spokesman Matteo Bruni said. A more detailed medical update was expected later.\n\nOn Monday, Francis resumed doing some work and made his daily call to a Gaza City parish to check in on the Catholic community there.\n\nThis Holy Year weekend was dedicated to deacons, the ministry that is a necessary step for men who are preparing to become priests. Francis had an unrelated audience Saturday and was supposed to have ordained the deacons during a Mass on Sunday. The Vatican on Tuesday announced his audience was canceled and that the archbishop who is organizing the Jubilee would celebrate the Mass. It’s a similar arrangement that the Vatican announced last weekend when artists in town had to settle for a cardinal presiding over their special Mass.\n\nThe next Jubilee events on the calendar that would typically involve the pope are the March 8-9 weekend dedicated to volunteers.\n\nFrancis had part of one lung removed after a pulmonary infection as a young man and is prone to bouts of bronchitis in winter. He has admitted in the past that he is a non-compliant patient, and even his close Vatican aides have said he pushed himself too far even once his bronchitis was diagnosed.\n\nHe refused to let up on his busy schedule and ignored medical advice to stay indoors during Rome’s chilly winter, insisting on sitting through an outdoor Jubilee Mass for the armed forces on Feb. 9 even though he was having trouble breathing.\n\nFrancis’ hospital admission this year has already sidelined him for longer than a 2023 hospitalization for pneumonia.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press religion coverage receives support through the AP’s collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

Zajko was charged with trespassing, obstructing and hindering, resisting arrest and handgun on person. Blank was charged with trespassing, obstructing and hindering.

Sign up for NBC Philadelphia's News Headlines newsletter.\n\nL to R: Michelle Zajko, Jack Lasota\n\nThe murder of David Maland\n\nLasota is the apparent leader of the cultlike group known as the Zizians while Zajko is a member, according to investigators. The Zizians have been tied to the killing of U.S. Border Patrol Agent David Maland near the Canadian border in January 2025.\n\nMaland, 44, was killed in a Jan. 20 shootout following a traffic stop in Coventry, Vermont, a small town about 20 miles (32 kilometers) from the Canadian border. Teresa Youngblut, 21, was arrested and charged in Maland’s murder. She had been traveling with Felix Bauckholt, a German citizen who also was killed, and the pair had been under surveillance for several days.\n\nAccording to an FBI affidavit, Maland pulled over Youngblut and Bauckholt on Interstate 91 to conduct an immigration inspection. At the time, Bauckholt appeared to have an expired visa, according to a Department of Homeland Security database, but investigators later confirmed that his visa was current, the FBI said.\n\nYoungblut, who had been driving Bauckholt’s car, got out and opened fire on Maland and other officers without warning, the FBI alleges. Bauckholt tried to draw a gun but was shot, the affidavit states.\n\nAt least one border agent fired on Youngblut and Bauckholt, but authorities haven’t specified whose bullets hit whom.\n\nIn this undated and unknown location photo released by the Department of Homeland Security shows Border Patrol Agent David Maland posing with a service dog. (Department of Homeland Security via AP)\n\nThe murders of Richard Zajko and Rita Zajko\n\nAccording to a motion filed in January, the gun used by Youngblut and the one that Bauckholt was carrying were purchased by a third person in Vermont in February 2024. That buyer was a person of interest in the 2022 murders of 71-year-old Richard Zajko and his wife, 68-year-old Rita Zajko, in Delaware County, Pennsylvania, state police confirmed.\n\nThe two victims were shot to death inside their home on Highland Drive in Chester Heights back on Dec. 31, 2022.\n\nPolice later identified the person of interest in their deaths as their daughter, Michelle Zajko, according to NBC News. Zajko, Lasota and Blank were all initially taken into custody in connection to Richard and Rita Zajko’s deaths back in 2023 but were not charged with their murders at the time, NBC News reported.\n\nL to R: Rita Zajko, Richard Zajko\n\nThe Zizians\n\nInvestigators ultimately linked Lasota and Zajko to the cultlike group known as the Zizians. In addition to the murders of Maland and Zajko’s parents, the group was also allegedly involved in four other homicides in Vermont and California, according to investigators.\n\nThe Associated Press described the Zizians as a group of young, highly intelligent computer scientists, most of them in their 20s and 30s, who met online, shared anarchist beliefs, and became increasingly violent.\n\nTheir goals aren’t clear, but online writings span topics from radical veganism and gender identity to artificial intelligence.\n\nAt the middle of it all is “Ziz,” who appears to be the leader of the group. She has been seen near multiple crime scenes and has connections to various suspects.\n\nLaSota published a dark and sometimes violent blog under the name Ziz and, in one section, described her theory that the two hemispheres of the brain could hold separate values and genders and “often desire to kill each other.”\n\nLaSota, who used she/her pronouns, and in her writings says she is a transgender woman, railed against perceived enemies, including so-called rationalist groups, which operate mostly online and seek to understand human cognition through reason and knowledge. Some are concerned with the potential dangers of artificial intelligence.\n\nLaSota has not responded to multiple Associated Press emails in recent weeks, and her attorney Daniel McGarrigle declined to comment when asked whether she is connected to any of the deaths. Before her weekend arrest, she missed court appearances in two states, and bench warrants have been issued for her arrest.\n\nReached on Monday, McGarrigle would only confirm that he has represented LaSota and wouldn’t confirm her arrest or any details of the latest case.",

One of the documentary's directors, Julia Willoughby Nason, told TODAY.com in an interview about the series that her team reached out to the Laundries.\n\n\"They didn't want to participate,\" she explained, \"and we respect that. This is a very difficult story.\"\n\nGet top local stories in Philly delivered to you every morning. Sign up for NBC Philadelphia's News Headlines newsletter.\n\nPetito's sunny #vanlife Instagram posts from her cross-country travels in a Ford Transit van with fiancé Brian Laundrie were contrasted by a stormy off-camera relationship between the couple.\n\nPetito's disappearance during their trip in August 2021 made national headlines and led to a widespread search that ended when her body was found in a national forest in Wyoming.\n\nHere's what to know about the story.\n\nWho was Gabby Petito?\n\nBorn in 1999, the New York native became a vlogger documenting road trips across the western part of the country. In 2020, she called driving cross-country to Oregon and California \"an absolute dream\" in an Instagram post.\n\n“She wanted to cross the country in the camper van and live the van life and live free. This was her dream,” her mother, Nichole Schmidt, told NBC affiliate KSL in 2021.\n\nGabby Petito, a travel vlogger who was killed by her fiancé during a cross-country trip in 2021, is the subject of the new Netflix docuseries \"American Murder: Gabby Petito.\" Netflix\n\nIn May 2020, she shared her wish on Instagram to get back to traveling the world with Laundrie. The two left her hometown of Blue Point, New York, in July 2021 to embark on a cross-country trip, according to her Instagram posts and comments her mother shared with KSL.\n\nPetito and Laundrie chronicled their journey on a YouTube channel they created called Nomadic Statik. They wrote in the description of a video posted on their channel Aug. 19, 2021, that they had previously traveled across the country together in a Nissan Sentra, but were making the journey this time in a white 2012 Ford Transit van.\n\nWho was Brian Laundrie?\n\nLaundrie first met Petito at Bayport-Blue Point High School in Bayport, New York, Petito's stepfather told The New York Times in 2021. Petito marked her first anniversary with Laundrie in a March 2020 Instagram post.\n\nIn another Instagram post Petito shared a few months later in July, she announced she and Laundrie were engaged. Petito moved from New York to live with Laundrie in Florida, Petito's stepfather previously told The New York Times.\n\nBrian Laundrie, whom the FBI said took responsibility in his writings for the death of fiancée Gabby Petito, was found dead in a Florida preserve in 2021 after Petito's body had been found in Wyoming. @gabspetito / Instagram\n\nLaundrie and Petito were on their cross-country road trip together in the Ford Transit van when she was reported missing. \"The circumstances are odd,\" police said in a statement in September 2021 after recovering the van in North Port, Florida, NBC News reported.\n\nInstagram posts by Petito documented them visiting Monument Rocks in Kansas and Zion National Park and Bryce Canyon National Park in Utah in July 2021.\n\nWhen did Gabby Petito disappear?\n\nPetito's family reported her missing to the Suffolk County Police Department on Sept. 11, 2021, KSL reported at the time.\n\nAround Aug. 24, 2021, Petito and Laundrie left Salt Lake City for Grand Teton National Park, and this was also the last time Schmidt spoke to her daughter on FaceTime, her parents told KSL.\n\nSchmidt said she received the last text from her daughter Aug. 30, 2021.\n\n\"I don’t know, again, if that was her texting me or not,\" Schmidt said to KSL.\n\nPetito’s last post on Instagram was shared Aug. 25, 2021, and no location was specified.\n\nWhat happened at the police stop in Moab?\n\nPolice responded to a physical altercation between Petito and Laundrie on Aug. 12, 2021, according to a report by the Moab City Police Department that was released Sept. 15, 2021, NBC News reported at the time. The couple and a witness spoke to an officer responding to the domestic violence call near a grocery store in Moab, Utah, police said.\n\nIn September 2021, Utah's Grand County Sheriff’s Office \"released 911 audio from a witness who said he saw a man slap a female and then saw a white Ford Transit van bearing a Florida license plate drive away,\" NBC News reported, adding that \"the 911 call led Moab police to stop the van.\"\n\nPolice released bodycam footage from a police stop involving Petito and Laundrie in Moab, Utah, that occurred just weeks before her disappearance. TODAY\n\nA second officer wrote that the couple's van swerved and hit a curb before stopping after the officer turned on the police lights to pull them over, according to the police report obtained by NBC News.\n\nThe report also stated the responding officer wrote that Petito slapped Laundrie after an argument, NBC News reported.\n\n“The male tried to create distance by telling Gabbie to take a walk to calm down, she didn’t want to be separated from the male, and began slapping him,\" the responding officer wrote in the report, according to NBC News. \"He grabbed her face and pushed her back as she pressed upon him and the van.”\n\nThe couple then asked for no charges to be filed, according to the report obtained by NBC News.\n\n“No one reported that the male struck the female, both the male and the female reported they are in love and engaged and to be married and desperately didn’t wish to see anyone charged with a crime,” according to the report NBC News obtained. “There were no significant injures reported and both agreed that Gabbie suffers from serious anxiety.”\n\nThe four or five months that Petito and Laundrie spent traveling together had sparked tension, the police report said.\n\n“The time spent created emotional strain between them and increased the number of arguments,” the report said, according to NBC News.\n\nIn lieu of police making a case against Petito for domestic assault, the couple separated for a night, the report said, NBC News reported. Petito was given the van, while Laundrie was taken to a hotel, police said in the report, according to NBC News. No charges were filed.\n\nAn independent review released in January 2022 that was conducted by Capt. Brandon Ratcliffe of Utah's Price City Police Department found that the officers who responded in Moab misclassified the incident and lacked details, NBC News reported.\n\nAn officer for the Moab police wrote in the report that the incident was “more accurately categorized as a mental/emotional health ‘break’ than a domestic assault.” However, the independent review states that “officers failed to cite Ms. Petito for domestic violence.”\n\nPolice did not get a statement from the 911 caller who reported “the gentleman slapping the girl,” the independent report said.\n\nThe city of Moab said in a statement that the officers \"made several unintentional mistakes\" and that it intended to follow the report’s recommendations, which included improved trainings and reviews of overall policy and software.\n\nThe police report of the incident was made public weeks after Petito had last been seen and days after Petito's mother reported her missing.\n\nPolice then released bodycam footage on Sept. 16, 2021, that showed Laundrie and Petito talking to an officer after getting pulled over in Moab, NBC News reported after obtaining the footage. Petito could be seen wiping away tears.\n\n“We’ve just been fighting this morning,” Petito said to the officer. “Some personal issues.”\n\n“It was a long day. We were camping yesterday,\" Laundrie said.\n\nIn August 2022, Petito's family announced a wrongful death lawsuit against police in Moab seeking $50 million in damages, NBC News reported. The family's lawyers said the Moab police weren't properly trained to detect signs of domestic abuse or they would have known “Gabby was a victim of intimate partner violence” and needed “immediate protection,” NBC News reported. At the time, the Moab City Police Department did not immediately respond to NBC's request for comment, and a Moab representative said it does not comment on pending litigation, according to NBC News.\n\nThe lawsuit was dismissed by a Utah judge in November 2024, according to The Associated Press.\n\nWhat happened to Gabby Petito?\n\nA body that was later determined to be Petito was found in the Spread Creek Dispersed Camping Area in Bridger-Teton National Forest in Wyoming on Sept. 19, 2021, NBC News confirmed with authorities at the time.\n\nA Wyoming coroner ruled her death to be a homicide by strangulation, according to his comments in a video shared by NBC affiliate WNBC in October 2021.\n\nGabby Petito and Brian Laundrie in \"American Murder: Gabby Petito.\" Netflix\n\nWhat happened to Brian Laundrie?\n\nPolice said Laundrie returned to North Port, Florida, on Sept. 1, 2021, without Petito, NBC News reported that same month. The van the two had been driving across the country was recovered at Petito's Florida home and processed for evidence with help from the FBI, the North Port Police Department said in a statement, according to NBC News.\n\nOn Sept. 15, 2021, North Port, Florida, police confirmed Laundrie was a person of interest after Petito's family reported her missing, according to NBC News. Laundrie's family attorney acknowledged Laundrie had been named as a person of interest by police in a statement obtained by NBC News and that Laundrie would \"continue to remain silent on the advice of counsel.\"\n\nLaundrie's family attorney then told NBC affiliate WFLA via text message that the Laundries believed their son left home Sept. 13 to go hiking, after previously telling police he left home Sept. 14 when they reported him missing.\n\nAuthorities repeatedly searched the 25,000-acre Carlton Reserve near Sarasota, Florida, trying to find Laundrie, according to the North Port Police Department, NBC News reported.\n\nHuman remains were found in the Carlton Reserve along with a backpack and notebook belonging to Laundrie, an FBI official told reporters Oct. 20, 2021, according to NBC News. A day later, the FBI confirmed the remains were Laundrie's after a review of dental records, WNBC reported.\n\nLaundrie died by suicide from a gunshot wound to the head, an attorney for Laundrie’s family said in November 2021, according to NBC News.\n\nHe also left behind writings showing his “responsibility” for Petito's death, the FBI announced in January 2022, NBC News reported.\n\n“A review of the notebook revealed written statements by Mr. Laundrie claiming responsibility for Ms. Petito’s death,” an FBI statement said, according to NBC News.\n\nWhy did Petito’s parents sue Laundrie’s parents?\n\nPetito's family filed a civil lawsuit against Laundrie's parents in March 2022 that accused Christopher and Roberta Laundrie of interfering with the search for their murdered daughter, according to the lawsuit, which NBC News reported on at the time.\n\nAttorneys for the family argued that Laundrie's parents issued a statement on Sept. 14, 2021, supporting a search for Petito \"with full knowledge that Gabrielle Petito had been murdered by their son,” the complaint said, according to NBC News.\n\nLaundrie's parents “knew of the mental suffering and anguish” Petito's family was experiencing but refused to disclose information about her whereabouts. In doing so, they allegedly “acted with malice or great indifference,” the lawsuit said, NBC News reported.\n\nThe lawyer for the Laundries denied the allegations in the lawsuit filed in Florida's Sarasota County, which sought at least $30,000 in damages, according to NBC News.\n\nJim Schmidt and Petito's mother, Nichole Schmidt, are interviewed in \"American Murder: Gabby Petito.\" Netflix\n\nPetito's parents, Laundrie's parents, and attorney Steven Bertolino, who represented the Laundrie family, reached a \"confidential resolution\" in the case in February 2024 to which \"all parties reluctantly agreed in order to avoid further legal expenses and prolonged personal conflict,\" according to a joint statement by Petito's parents that was shared with NBC News.\n\nPetito's family also filed a separate wrongful death lawsuit in Florida against the estate of Brian Laundrie. The lawsuit was resolved when the judge ruled for Petito's mother, the administrator of her daughter's estate, to receive $3 million in November 2022, according to court documents obtained by NBC News.\n\n“The Petito family lost their daughter, and they were also denied the opportunity to confront her killer. No amount of money is sufficient to compensate the Petito family for the loss of their daughter, Gabby, at the hands of Brian Laundrie,” Patrick Reilly, an attorney for Petito’s family, said in a statement obtained by NBC News.\n\nReilly said any money from the $3 million settlement would be going to the Gabby Petito Foundation, which supports organizations that help victims of domestic violence and assist in locating missing persons.\n\nThis story first appeared on TODAY.com.

        "fullContent": "Jacqueline Romero ended her tenure as the United States Attorney for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania (EDPA).\n\nRomero made her announcement on Monday, Feb. 17, 2025.\n\nRomero was sworn in as the chief federal law enforcement officer for the EDPA on June 21, 2022, after being nominated by President Joe Biden and confirmed by the U.S. Senate. She was the first woman appointed and confirmed to the position by a president and the Senate, respectively. She was also the first woman of color and first member of the LGBTQIA+ community to hold the position.\n\nRomero served as an Assistant United States Attorney in the EDPA for 16 years prior to her appointment.\n\nGet top local stories in Philly delivered to you every morning. Sign up for NBC Philadelphia's News Headlines newsletter.\n\n“When I came here, almost 20 years ago now, it was to do the job, to be a prosecutor. I didn’t come here for a title,” Romero said. “But it has been the absolute honor of my life to hold this title of U.S. Attorney. The work we’ve done these last years — scores of violent offenders and child predators taken off the street, fraudsters who preyed on investors and the elderly locked up, drug dealers and dirty doctors who poisoned our communities brought to justice, civil rights violations brought to light, and much more — all of it has made the Eastern District of Pennsylvania safer, stronger, and more just.”\n\nDuring her time as U.S. Attorney, Romero doubled the size of the EDPA’s Violent Crime Unit and focused on taking illegal guns off the street and dismantling gangs and drug trafficking organizations. Her office also prosecuted financial fraud and public corruption cases.\n\n“I’m extraordinarily proud, too, of our outreach efforts,” Romero said. “My team and I have gone out and met the people of this District where they are. It’s helped build trust in the community and that isn’t just something, it’s everything. I know that all of my colleagues here, no matter their role, will carry on this Office’s important work, on behalf of the people of southeastern Pennsylvania.”\n\nRomero did not reveal the reason for ending her tenure. Her announcement comes amid news that the Trump administration is preparing to fire hundreds of high-level Department of Homeland Security employees this week as part of a move to rid the agency of people deemed to be misaligned with the administration’s goals, according to sources with NBC News. The administration also made hundreds of cuts targeting the Federal Emergency Management Agency, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency as part of an effort to reduce the federal workforce.\n\nBloomberg Law also reported that Trump intended to fire around 20 chief prosecutors across the country, including in Philadelphia.",

        "source": "https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/",
        "fullContent": "Donald Trump is the president, but billionaire Elon Musk is the focus for thousands of Democratic activists launching a protest campaign this week to fight the Trump administration's push to gut federal health, education and human services agencies.\n\nHundreds of protests are scheduled outside congressional offices and Tesla dealerships, with organizers hoping to send a pointed message to members of Congress who are on recess this week.\n\nThe backlash still hasn't approached the intensity of protests during and after Trump's first inauguration eight years ago. But a loose coalition of Democrats and progressives is coalescing around Musk's rise as Trump's top lieutenant and his purge of the federal bureaucracy.\n\n“He’s a major weak link in the MAGA coalition,” Ezra Levin, co-founder of the progressive group Indivisible, said of Musk. “I can’t think of something that polls worse than the richest man in the world is coming after your Social Security check or your Meals on Wheels or your Head Start.”\n\nGet top local stories in Philly delivered to you every morning. Sign up for NBC Philadelphia's News Headlines newsletter.\n\nIndivisible, which claims more than 1,300 local chapters nationwide, is encouraging members to protest at the offices of their members of Congress, regardless of political party. The group also offered a step-by-step guide for protesting at dealerships for Tesla, Musk's electric vehicle company.\n\nThe memo encourages protesters to stay on sidewalks and public spaces and to avoid any actions that might directly interfere with business operations, such as blocking entrances or trespassing on private property. It also calls for Tesla protesters to stay on message: “This is about Musk’s political takeover, not Tesla, SpaceX, or X as companies.”\n\nVermont Sen. Bernie Sanders is launching what he’s calling “a national tour to fight oligarchy” with stops in working-class districts of Iowa and Nebraska this week.\n\nDemocratic National Committee Chair Ken Martin will hit the road for the first time as party leader as well. The newly elected DNC chair will travel to Pennsylvania, Texas, Illinois, Wisconsin and Missouri in the coming days to meet with local Democratic officials and labor leaders, spokesperson Hannah Muldavin said.\n\nLike the protesters, Martin is expected to seize on Musk’s role. During a meeting with labor leaders in Pittsburgh, for example, he plans to highlight Musk’s recent focus on the Department of Labor, which could put “the integrity of data like the unemployment rate and inflation rate at risk, which is important for a stable U.S. economy and, by extension, working people,” Muldavin said.\n\nAware of the intense displeasure from their party’s base, many House Democrats plan to be proactive.\n\nThe House Democratic Policy and Communications Committee issued a memo ahead of the recess instructing Democrats to embrace “nine days of visibility” and said it was essential for members to host one town hall, in-person or via telephone, and at least one community event that highlights the \"devastating impacts” of Trump and Musk’s actions.\n\nThe wave of protests comes at a critical moment as fractured Democrats struggle to stop the Republican president’s purge of the federal bureaucracy, which features thousands of layoffs inside departments focused on public health, education, veterans affairs and human services, among others.\n\nFirings in recent days at the Department of Veterans Affairs include researchers working on cancer treatment, opioid addiction, prosthetics and burn pit exposure, according to U.S. Sen. Patty Murray, a Democrat from Washington state. The cuts also include more than 5,000 employees at the Department of Health and Human Services and roughly one-tenth of the workforce at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nIn some cases, Musk’s team is trying — with Trump's blessing but without congressional approval — to shutter entire agencies, including the U.S. Agency for International Development, the Department of Education and the U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.\n\nTrump has defended the cuts as necessary to eliminate waste and fraud. And he has praised Musk’s work with his Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, saying it has found “shocking” evidence of wasteful spending. He signed an executive order expanding Musk’s influence.\n\nMusk, meanwhile, has defended the swift and extensive cuts he’s pushing across the federal government while acknowledging there have been mistakes.\n\nDemocrats in Congress condemn the moves as dangerous, but without control of either chamber of Congress, there is little they can do to stop the Trump administration aside from turning to the courts. Still, three of the nation's largest progressive groups — Indivisible, MoveOn and the Working Families Party — are coordinating this week's protests to send a clear message to elected officials in both major political parties that they must do more.\n\nStill, Democratic members of Congress may face their own voters' fury.\n\nMoveOn, which boasts a membership of nearly 10 million, is hosting dozens of rallies outside town halls and congressional offices for those members who do not host public events. The group will focus on “persuadable House Republicans whose votes will be crucial to opposing the Trump-Musk agenda,” according to a preview of its recess week plan. But there will also be rallies targeting House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries and Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer, both of New York, among other Democrats.\n\n“We are seeing a true resurgence in energy opposing what Trump, Musk and Republicans are doing to our country,” MoveOn executive director Rahna Epting said, adding that “people are mad as hell.”\n\nThe Working Families Party is focusing protests in the districts of vulnerable Republicans in states such as California, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. The actions will feature people directly impacted by the Trump administration's cuts, including special education teachers, nurses and Head Start workers, according to Working Families spokesman Ravi Mangla.\n\n“A lot of Republicans,\" Mangla said, “have not have had their feet held to the fire.”",

        "source": "https://6abc.com/",
        "fullContent": "Daughter of slain Delco couple arrested in Maryland; allegedly connected to cultlike group: police\n\nPHILADELPHIA (WPVI) -- The daughter of a slain Delaware County couple was arrested in Maryland over the weekend on trespassing and weapon charges, according to state police.\n\nMichelle Zajko, 33, of Media, Pennsylvania, and Jack Lasota, 34, of Berkeley, Calif., and Daniel Arthur Blank, 26, of Sacramento, Calif., were arrested on Sunday in Frostburg, Maryland.\n\nPolice say Lasota was arrested and charged with trespassing, obstructing & hindering, firearm in vehicle. Zajko was arrested and charged with trespassing, obstructing & hindering, resisting arrest, handgun on person; and Blank was arrested and charged with trespassing, obstructing & hindering.\n\nFurther details on what led to the arrests were not immediately released.\n\nA bail hearing is scheduled for 11 a.m. Tuesday at Allegany District Court.\n\nWho is Ziz?\n\nLasota is the apparent leader of a cultlike group known as the Zizians, according to the Associated Press. Zajko is also reportedly a member of the group.\n\nLaSota moved to the San Francisco Bay area after earning a computer science degree from the University of Alaska Fairbanks in 2013 and interning at NASA, according to a profile on a hiring site for programmers, coders and other freelance workers. NASA officials did not respond to a request to confirm LaSota's internship, but a Jack LaSota is listed on a website about past interns.\n\nIn 2016, she began publishing a dark and rambling blog under the name Ziz, describing her theory that the two hemispheres of the brain could hold separate values and genders and \"often desire to kill each other.\"\n\nLaSota used she/her pronouns, and in her writings says she is a transgender woman. She railed against perceived enemies, including so-called rationalist groups, which operate mostly online and seek to understand human cognition through reason and knowledge. Some are concerned with the potential dangers of artificial intelligence.\n\nThe Zizians have been tied to the killing of U.S. Border Patrol Agent David Maland near the Canadian border in January and five other homicides in Vermont, Pennsylvania and California.\n\nRELATED: A timeline of activities of cultlike group tied to the killing of a Border Patrol agent\n\nJack LaSota, Alexander Leatham, Emma Borhanian, Gwen Danielson, Maximilian Snyder and Teresa Youngblut. They are associates of LaSota, also known as \"Ziz.\" AP Photo\n\nMaland, 44, was killed in a Jan. 20 shootout following a traffic stop in Coventry, Vermont, a small town about 20 miles from the Canadian border. Teresa Youngblut, 21, is accused of opening fire on agents during the traffic stop.\n\nIn this undated and unknown location photo released by the Department of Homeland Security shows Border Patrol Agent David Maland posing with a service dog. Department of Homeland Security via AP\n\nOfficials have offered few details of the cross-country investigation, which broke open after the Jan. 20 shooting death of Maland. Associated Press interviews and a review of court records and online postings tell the story of how a group of young, highly intelligent computer scientists, most of them in their 20s and 30s, met online, shared anarchist beliefs, and became increasingly violent.\n\nMurders in Delaware County\n\nBack on December 31, 2022, Michelle Zajko's parents, Richard and Rita, were both shot in the head inside their Chester Heights home.\n\nNo arrests have been made in the case, but Pennsylvania State Police recently announced the gun used to kill Agent Maland was purchased by a person of interest in the murders of Richard and Rita Zajko.\n\nRichard Zajko and Rita Zajko\n\nPolice identified Michelle Zajko as the couple's daughter after her license was found in the home, officials said. It was revealed in court documents that troopers searched a Vermont home tied to Michelle nearly a week after her parents were killed.\n\nPolice question the Zajkos' daughter at her home in Vermont. A few weeks later, officers briefly take her into custody at a Pennsylvania hotel, but release her without charges. LaSota, staying at the same hotel, is arrested and charged with obstructing the homicide investigation and disorderly conduct, according to the Associated Press.\n\nREAD MORE: Troopers searched Vermont home in connection with Delco murders: Court docs\n\nDuring a \"voluntary interview,\" authorities say Michelle Zajko admitted to owning a firearm -- a Smith and Wesson \"M &P\" model.\n\nAccording to sale records, the gun was purchased on February 3, 2022, at Green Mountain Sporting Goods in Vermont by Michelle Zajko. Authorities allege the ammo allegedly purchased by Michelle Zajko is the same manufacture and type as the spent casings that were recovered at the scene of the Delaware County murders.\n\nThe search warrant was for the Smith and Wesson handgun and ammunition, but the court filings only state three cartridges of 9mm ammo were recovered.\n\nTies to California\n\nThe shootings in Delaware County and Vermont seem to have growing connections to another killing in California.\n\nU.S. Attorney Michael Drescher previously said in a court filing the Border Patrol shooting is also linked to a murder in California but she hasn't provided further details.\n\nLaSota is also facing charges of obstructing law enforcement and disorderly conduct in Pennsylvania. Authorities won't say whether those charges are related to the Zajko deaths, but court records show that police were searching for a gun used in two killings when they arrested LaSota 12 days later at a hotel about 10 miles from the scene of the killings.\n\nThough authorities have not publicly identified the person who bought the gun used in the Vermont murder, the VTDigger news investigative online site reported that federal authorities issued an alert to firearms dealers seeking information about purchases made by Michelle Zajko and described her as a person of interest in the Vermont shooting.\n\nAccording to a public records database, a Michelle Zajko was registered to vote in 2016 at the same home address in Pennsylvania as Richard and Rita Zajko. In 2021, a Michelle Zajko bought a half-acre piece of property in Derby, Vermont, a few miles from the Canadian border. According to town records, the land is undeveloped.\n\nMichelle Zajko has not been charged with either of the shooting incidents.\n\nTies to North Carolina\n\nMembers of the group allegedly live in North Carolina which brought the investigation to the Tar Heel state. Dozens of FBI agents searched a wooded area off 150501 near Chapel Hill on Wednesday, Feb. 5. Our sister staton WTVD reached out the agency about the search but got little information.\n\nThe FBI, however, did say they were conducting \"court-authorized investigative activity in connection with an ongoing federal law enforcement investigation.\" They declined to comment further when asked if the loud sounds neighbors heard were related to the investigation.\n\nOne homeowner told WTVD she woke up to the sound of a bang followed by a large federal presence in the neighborhood.\n\n\"Woke me up out of my sleep,\" said Candice Welch. \"It was a real loud bang, about 30 minutes apart. I thought it was just a transformer (blowing), it was loud.\"\n\nShe said they were told the agents were looking for a \"missing item.\"\n\n\"They were looking for a missing item, that's all they told us. We knew it had to be something important, something very serious because of the fact that it was the FBI, along with the sheriff's deputies, and unmarked cars.

It is based on Associated Press interviews and a review of police reports, court records and online postings:\n\nJack LaSota, Alexander Leatham, Emma Borhanian, Gwen Danielson, Maximilian Snyder and Teresa Youngblut. They are associates of LaSota, also known as \"Ziz.\" AP Photo\n\n2016\n\nJack LaSota, who uses feminine pronouns, a computer programmer and transgender woman living in the San Francisco Bay area, starts writing a blog under the online persona \"Ziz\" with complex and sometimes rambling theories about technology, gender identity and human cognition. She gets involved in the rationalist movement, a community that seeks to understand human cognition and is concerned with the potential dangers of artificial intelligence.\n\n2018\n\nLaSota attends programs organized by rationalist groups but splits from them after they reject her theory that the two hemispheres of the brain can hold separate values and genders.\n\nNovember 2019\n\nLaSota and three others - Emma Borhanian, Gwen Danielson and Alexander Leatham - are arrested during what they called a protest against sexual misconduct within rationalist organizations.\n\nAugust 2022\n\nThe U.S. Coast Guard responds to a report that LaSota had fallen out of a boat in San Francisco Bay. No body is found. An obituary is published.\n\nNovember 2022\n\nCurtis Lind goes to court seeking to evict LaSota, Borhanian, Leatham and others who have been living in vans and box trucks on his property in Vallejo, California, for nonpayment of rent. On Nov. 15, two days before the eviction deadline, Lind is impaled with a sword and partially blinded in an attack during which he shoots and kills Borhanian.\n\nConcluding that Lind acted in self-defense, officials charge Leatham and Suri Dao with murder. LaSota is not charged but police report having contact with her at the scene.\n\nDecember 2022\n\nRita and Richard Zajko are shot and killed in their home in Chester Heights, Pennsylvania, on New Year's Eve. A neighbor's doorbell camera captures audio and video of a car pulling up to their home, a voice shouting \"Mom!\" and another voice exclaiming, \"Oh my God! Oh, God, God!\"\n\nRichard Zajko and Rita Zajko\n\nJanuary 2023\n\nPolice question the Zajkos' daughter, Michelle, at her home in Vermont. A few weeks later, officers briefly take her into custody at a Pennsylvania hotel, but release her without charges. LaSota, staying at the same hotel, is arrested and charged with obstructing the homicide investigation and disorderly conduct.\n\nJuly 2023\n\nFelix Bauckholt, also referred to in court documents as Ophelia, begins renting half a duplex in Chapel Hill, North Carolina.\n\nMay 2024\n\nTeresa Youngblut's parents report her missing in Seattle after she sends her mother emails saying she has moved in with a friend and changed her number.\n\nNovember 2024\n\nYoungblut and Maximilian Snyder apply for a marriage license in Washington state. Also this month, Youngblut begins renting a condo near Bauckholt's in North Carolina.\n\nJanuary 2025\n\nYoungblut and Bauckholt check into a hotel in Lyndonville, Vermont, on Jan. 14. Investigators put the pair under surveillance after a hotel worker reports concerns about their all-black tactical clothing and the gun Youngblut was carrying.\n\nOn Jan. 17, Lind, the landlord in California is killed. Snyder is charged with murder, and prosecutors allege he was trying to prevent Lind from testifying against his earlier attackers.\n\nOn Jan. 20, U.S. Border Patrol officers pull Youngblut and Bauckholt over on Interstate 91 in Coventry, Vermont. Agent David Maland and Bauckholt are killed in a shootout. Youngblut, who is wounded, is charged with firearms charges.\n\nFebruary 2025\n\nThe FBI searches the Chapel Hill property where a landlord says Youngblut, Bauckholt and LaSota had been living earlier this winter.\n\nOn Feb 16. Lasota was arrested Sunday along with Michelle Zajko, 33, of Media, Pennsylvania. They face multiple charges including trespassing, obstructing and hindering and possession of a handgun in the vehicle.\n\n",

        "fullContent": "Independence Mall Park Rangers among federal jobs cut by Trump administration\n\nPHILADELPHIA (WPVI) -- The sweeping layoffs of thousands of federal employees ordered by the Trump administration have made their way to Pennsylvania.\n\nOn Friday, some employees at one of the nation's most historic sites found out they're losing their jobs.\n\nIt leaves some to wonder what the impact will be as unions speaking out against the firings say they're being done without just cause.\n\nRELATED: Fired federal workers speak out on recent terminations: 'we're under attack by billionaires'\n\nUnions representing National Park employees also say the layoffs will make things even worse at parks that are already understaffed.\n\nOn Friday afternoon, two Park Rangers along Independence Mall received a letter stating they were being terminated.\n\n\"They had no notice. They had no warning,\" said Mark Cochran, president of the American Federation of Government Employees Council 270, which is the council of unions representing National Parks employees along the East Coast.\n\nCochran says employees at several parks received identical letters. They were all directed to people in their first year of employment, which is known as the \"probationary\" period.\n\nSEE ALSO: IRS will lay off thousands of probationary workers in the middle of tax season\n\n\n\n\"They claim employees' job performance didn't meet the standard that was required for their job description, and that excuse is absolutely ridiculous,\" he said.\n\n\"Oh, that makes me extremely sad. A lot of the stuff that's going on right now makes me extremely angry and sad,\" said Kathy Wilson, of Warrington, as she toured Independence Mall with her family.\n\nThere's now a federal complaint on behalf of civil servants across nine agencies. The group representing the terminated employees released a statement that said in part, \"The Trump administration is seeking to undermine that value by purging non-partisan career civil servants and prioritizing partisan loyalists.\"\n\n\"Clearly this is all about partisan politics,\" said Cochran.\n\nAt Independence Mall, the layoffs mean an already short-staffed operation will get even shorter.\n\n\"Their programs for educational groups are going to be limited,\" said Cochran of parks like Independence Mall and Gettysburg National Park where he works. \"Trash won't be collected as thoroughly as usual.\"\n\n\"I think the layoffs are crazy. It's a little bit ridiculous,\" said Paul Suh of New York City as he toured Independence Mall with his family.\n\nVisitors and National Park employees are both worried about the impact of cutbacks at some of the nation's most treasured sites.\n\nOn Monday morning, we learned that a federal judge seems unlikely to block the layoffs already ordered by Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency. The judge's final decision should come within a day.\n\nMeantime, unions representing National Park Workers are considering legal action.",

        "fullContent": "Best gaming laptops from MSI, Acer and more\n\nAs a participant in multiple affiliate marketing programs, Localish will earn a commission for certain purchases. See full disclaimer below*\n\nIf you're a casual gamer you might not think you need a gaming laptop, but having one can be great for competitive gamers, streamers or anyone who spends time playing cooperatively with their friends daily. Below, you'll find the best gaming laptops at every price point, plus the features you might want to keep in mind before shopping for one.\n\nGaming laptops buying guide:\n\nScreen size and resolution: You might want a larger screen size on your gaming laptop if you're dealing with games with a lot of moving parts. That said, a larger screen size usually commands a higher price point. Below, we've highlighted gaming laptops with screen sizes of 14 and 16-inch. The resolution states how clear your picture will be. A higher resolution is preferred for competitive gamers. The below laptops have at least a Full HD resolution, but we've also included options for 4K (four times the clarity of a physical HD laptop).\n\nOperating System: An OS usually handles all the application programs on your computer, including how the RAM is managed. Windows OS 11 is the best for gaming, but you can also use Atlast OS which optimizes system performance and lowers latency.\n\nRAM: You'll want at least 16 GB of RAM on your gaming laptop. This is required to run any AAA titles (games produced by major publishers) at their native resolutions and without lags. If you're looking to stream while gaming, go higher with a 32 GB laptop.\n\nStorage: Ideally you'll want a laptop with at least 512 GB of storage. This sounds like a lot, but games are usually at least 100 GB, so with a 512 GB laptop you'll be able to store 4-5 games at a time. You can also purchase additional SSDs if you need a higher amount of storage in the short term.\n\nBest gaming laptops\n\nAmazon MSI Cyborg 14 $1099 Shop now\n\nI tested this laptop for about a month and was impressed by both its performance and design. It's surprisingly lightweight, stays cool to the touch while gaming, and has a tactile, responsive keyboard for quick feedback. There is also up to 1 TB of storage available, and the 14-inch display FHD+ display is just big and bright enough to keep track of all your in-game characters. Its fan and in-built cooling system is not that noisy either and the backlit keyboard is great for gaming after hours. I honestly love this piece of gaming equipment and think it's a great laptop for beginner and seasoned gamers alike.\n\nBest Buy ASUS - ROG Zephyrus G14 $1599 Shop now\n\nThis is a great laptop for beginners and expert gamers alike. It comes with 16 GB of RAM, a Full HD resolution, and a Windows 11 operating system for quick gameplay with no lag time. It also boasts rapid response times (the lower the response time, the quicker your laptop is) and has 1TB of in-built storage which means it's able to store a decent amount of games. It offers intelligent cooling which should also keep this pick from quickly heating up, and six speakers equipped with Domby Atmos, allowing you to use it without a pair of good-quality gaming headphones. You'll also get three months of Xbox game pass included which will give you access to 100s of free games - including new titles.\n\nAmazon Razer Blade 14 (2024) $2699.99 Shop now\n\nRazer just announced the new and thinner Razer Blade 16 at CES, but you'll have to wait for a little before you can shop that pick. In fact, most Razer laptops are currently out of stock at major retailers. That said, you can currently purchase the Razer Blade 14 - last year's release. It has 32 GB of RAM making it a strong pick, and it also carries a whole 1TB of storage. Plus, it has a Windows 11 operating system similar to some of the other picks on this list. Battery life lasts eight hours (but keep in mind that gaming laptops are notorious for fast-depleting batteries due to how heavy-duty most AAA titles are). It is also one of the lightest Razer laptops around, making it a great buy for those always on the go.\n\nAmazon HP Omen 16 $1199 Shop now\n\nHP's 2023 Omen is still a top contender. For starters, it has a wide, 16.1-inch Full HD display with an anti-glare screen so you can game wherever you are. This option also has 1 TB of storage (but the brand offers options up to 4 TB if you need it) and like the other picks on our list, a fully customizable RGB backlit keyboard and built-in speakers. It weighs around five pounds and also comes with multiple USB port options. Plus, since it has 32GB of RAM it can handle most games with ease - you can also customize it to up to 64 GB of RAM.\n\n* By clicking on the featured links, visitors will leave this site and be directed to third-party e-commerce sites that operate under different terms and privacy policies.

        "fullContent": "Police arrest apparent leader of cultlike 'Zizian' group linked to multiple killings in the US\n\nThe apparent leader of a cultlike group known as the Zizians has been arrested in Maryland along with another member of the group, Maryland State Police said Monday.\n\nJack Lasota, 34, was arrested Sunday along with Michelle Zajko, 33, of Media, Pennsylvania. They face multiple charges including trespassing, obstructing and hindering and possession of a handgun in the vehicle.\n\nThe video featured is from a related report.\n\nFurther details on what led to the arrests were not immediately released.\n\nA bail hearing for the two is scheduled for 11 a.m. Tuesday at Allegany District Court.\n\nThe Zizians have been tied to the killing of U.S. Border Patrol Agent David Maland near the Canadian border in January and five other homicides in Vermont, Pennsylvania and California.\n\nIn this undated and unknown location photo released by the Department of Homeland Security shows Border Patrol Agent David Maland posing with a service dog. Department of Homeland Security via AP\n\nMaland, 44, was killed in a Jan. 20 shootout following a traffic stop in Coventry, Vermont, a small town about 20 miles (32 kilometers) from the Canadian border.\n\nBack on December 31, 2022, Zajko's parents, Richard and Rita, were both shot in the head inside their Chester Heights, Pennsylvania, home.\n\nRichard Zajko and Rita Zajko\n\nPolice question the Zajkos' daughter at her home in Vermont in January 2023. A few weeks later, officers briefly take her into custody at a Pennsylvania hotel, but release her without charges. LaSota, staying at the same hotel, is arrested and charged with obstructing the homicide investigation and disorderly conduct, according to the Associated Press.\n\nNo arrests have been made in the case, but Pennsylvania State Police recently announced the gun used to kill Agent Maland was purchased by a person of interest in the murders of Richard and Rita Zajko.\n\nThe shootings in Delaware County and Vermont seem to have growing connections to another killing in California.\n\nOfficials have offered few details of the cross-country investigation, which broke open after the Jan. 20 shooting death of Maland. Associated Press interviews and a review of court records and online postings tell the story of how a group of young, highly intelligent computer scientists, most of them in their 20s and 30s, met online, shared anarchist beliefs, and became increasingly violent.\n\nTheir goals aren't clear, but online writings span topics from radical veganism and gender identity to artificial intelligence.\n\nWho is Ziz?\n\nAt the middle of it all is \"Ziz,\" who appears to be the leader of the strange group members who called themselves \"Zizians.\" She has been seen near multiple crime scenes and has connections to various suspects.\n\nJack LaSota, Alexander Leatham, Emma Borhanian, Gwen Danielson, Maximilian Snyder and Teresa Youngblut. They are associates of LaSota, also known as \"Ziz.\" AP Photo\n\nin 2016, LaSota began publishing a dark and sometimes violent blog under the name Ziz and, in one section, described her theory that the two hemispheres of the brain could hold separate values and genders and \"often desire to kill each other.\"\n\nJack LaSota moved to the San Francisco Bay area after earning a computer science degree from the University of Alaska Fairbanks in 2013 and interning at NASA, according to a profile on a hiring site for programmers, coders and other freelance workers. NASA officials did not respond to a request to confirm LaSota's internship, but a Jack LaSota is listed on a website about past interns.\n\nLaSota, who used she/her pronouns, and in her writings says she is a transgender woman, railed against perceived enemies, including so-called rationalist groups, which operate mostly online and seek to understand human cognition through reason and knowledge. Some are concerned with the potential dangers of artificial intelligence.\n\nLaSota, 34, has not responded to multiple Associated Press emails in recent weeks, and her attorney Daniel McGarrigle declined to comment when asked whether she is connected to any of the deaths. Before her weekend arrest, she missed court appearances in two states, and bench warrants have been issued for her arrest.\n\nReached on Monday, McGarrigle would only confirm that he has represented LaSota and wouldn't confirm her arrest or any details of the latest case.\n\nWPVI and The Associated Press contributed to this report.",

The Delaware River Port Authority (DRPA) will be coordinating bridge closures.\n\nThe ship's new owners say they have completed the necessary safety requirements to move the SS United States.\n\nOnce it leaves Philadelphia, it will head toward Mobile, Alabama, where it will prepped to be sunk off Florida's panhandle.\n\nThe journey along the eastern seaboard is expected to take roughly two weeks.\n\nYou will be able to track the ship's journey on the Destin-Fort Walton Beach website, once it starts moving.\n\nIn fall 2024, Florida's Okaloosa County bought the derelict ship after approving a $10.1 million plan to relocate the ocean liner, sink it and build a $1 million seaside museum chronicling the cruise liner's history.\n\nRELATED: Here's what is delaying the SS United States from leaving Philadelphia\n\nOkaloosa County\n\nThe ship was originally supposed to leave Philadelphia in November but was delayed due to \"logistical details.\" There was also a tropical disturbance in the Gulf.\n\nThen, earlier this month, plans were in place again to move the ship, but that was halted due to a pier transition delay.\n\nRELATED: Ship sinking expert explains how the SS United States will be prepped for its underwater grave\n\nThe interior of \"America's Flagship\" will need to be scrapped and rid of any toxins or asbestos before it can be sent to its underwater grave.\n\nPreparing the vessel for deployment is expected to take about a year.\n\nWATCH: Action News archive - Inside the SS United States\n\nAction News takes a walk through the stripped-down SS United States\n\nOnce the clean-up is finished, the vessel will then be towed back out to the gulf, where it will travel about 20 miles southeast to just off the shores of Destin-Fort Walton for it to be sunk.\n\nThe ship's final home will be under about 180 feet (55 meters) of water 20 miles (32 kilometers) off the coast of Destin, Florida.\n\nOkaloosa County hopes the ship will become a destination for scuba divers and attract fish and other wildlife as a reef. It won't be the only shipwreck habitat they have.\n\nThe ship found its home on Pier 82 in South Philadelphia in 1996 after a nonprofit called the SS United States Conservancy saved it from the scrapyard in 2011. However, its plans to rehabilitate the ship never came to fruition.\n\nRELATED: Action News archives: We take a look back at when the SS United States arrived in Philadelphia\n\nIn the mid-90s, the fastest ship in the world parked at a Philadelphia pier at rate of $1,000 a week.\n\nFlorida officials say they intend to \"preserve the SS Unites States' storied history and the memories she has created for so many people over the years.\"\n\nChristened in 1952, the SS United States was once considered a beacon of American engineering, doubling as a military vessel that could carry thousands of troops. On its maiden voyage in 1952, it shattered the transatlantic speed record in both directions, when it reached an average speed of 36 knots, or just over 41 mph (66 kph).\n\nOn that voyage, the ship crossed the Atlantic in three days, 10 hours and 40 minutes, besting the RMS Queen Mary's time by 10 hours. To this day, the SS United States holds the transatlantic speed record for an ocean liner.\n\nIt became a reserve ship in 1969 and later bounced to various private owners who hoped to redevelop it but eventually found their plans to be too expensive or poorly timed.",

        "fullContent": "The William Kenzo Nakamura United States Courthouse is seen during a hearing in the multi-state lawsuit over President Trump’s order ending all federal funding or support for gender-affirming care for people younger than 19, outside a courthouse in Seattle, Washington, U.S., February 14, 2025.\n\nSign up for our Gay City News email newsletter to get news, updates, and local insights delivered straight to your inbox!\n\nFederal district judges on the east and west coasts presiding over simultaneous litigation brought by different parties have issued temporary restraining orders blocking enforcement of President Trump’s executive orders that sought to coerce healthcare providers from performing gender-affirming care for minors.\n\nJudge Lauren King of the US District Court in Seattle and Judge Brendan Hurson of the US District Court in Baltimore came to the same conclusion: The plaintiffs in both cases are likely to be able to prove that President Trump does not have the authority to unilaterally change federal law by imposing new restrictions on the grants and other federal money that health care institutions rely upon for their operations, which is Trump’s method for making gender-affirming care unavailable.\n\nThe East Coast case, PFLAG v. Trump, was brought by that organization and six transgender youths, all of whom are at some stage of accessing gender-affirming care but were notified by their provider that the care would be discontinued because of Trump’s executive order, since their provider was threatened with a cut-off of federal funds.\n\nThe West Coat case, State of Washington v. Trump, was brought jointly by the states of Washington, Minnesota, Oregon and Alabama and three physicians who perform gender affirming care. In each of the states there are public health care institutions that are threatened with loss of federal grants if gender-affirming care is provided in their facilities.\n\nThe central theme of both cases is that the president does not have the authority to place new conditions on the receipt of federal funding that were not legislated by Congress. Under the separation of powers set up in the Constitution, Congress makes the laws by passing statutes, the president swears to see that they are faithfully executed, and it is up to the courts to interpret and apply the laws in actual cases. Some borderlines between making laws, interpreting them, and enforcing them have become blurred by the emergence of administrative agencies and executive branch departments that are authorized to issue rules, guidelines, and regulations, but both Judge King and Judge Hurson show in their opinions that the president’s role remains limited under the separation of powers.\n\nThe president does not have the power to dictate healthcare policy to the states, and Congress’s own authority regarding healthcare is also limited because the regulation of healthcare is among the police powers generally reserved to the states under the 10th Amendment of the Constitution, which states: “The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.” This provision was particularly important for the west coast case, where four states are plaintiffs.\n\nIn both of these cases, the Justice Department, representing Trump and the various federal departments who are sued because they have grants and contracts with health care institutions, argued that the lawsuits are premature, that no action has been taken yet to suspend federal payments, and that a memo sent out by the Health Resources & Services Administration of the Department of Health and Human Services directing healthcare institutions that no federal money can be used to “promote gender ideology” (which is Trump’s term, borrowed from his good buddy Vladimir Putin) by providing gender-affirming care to minors, and that any institution providing such care stands to lose their grants or federal contracts, was revoked about a week after it was sent out. But the executive order has not been revoked by Trump and can be activated at any time in the absence of these court orders.\n\nThe judges noted that the revocation of that memo did not make the situation any less urgent, since the executive order specifies the cut-off of federal funding for gender-affirming care is “immediate,” and both judges concluded that the plaintiffs would suffer irreparable injuries if all federal money was withdrawn.\n\nJudge King in Seattle wrote the longer and more detailed opinion. In addition to violating the separation of powers, part of the basic structure of the Constitution, Trump’s order cited 18 U.S.C. Section 116, a criminal statute, as a source of authority. This is a statute that was enacted to deal with the issue of genital mutilation of women and imposes criminal penalties. The judge wrote that “to the extent the executive order purports to expand the scope of criminalized conduct in another federal statute – 18 U.S.C. section 116 – this, too, trespasses beyond the president’s powers under the Constitution.”\n\nShe also found a potential violation of the Fifth Amendment’s equal protection requirement by treating people differently “based on sex or transgender status,” which she opined could only be done “if the differential treatment (1) serves important governmental objectives and (2) is substantially related to the achievement of those objectives,” the “heightened scrutiny” standard of judicial review. The district court in Seattle is bound by rulings of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, which has held in past cases that discrimination based on transgender status is subject to the heightened scrutiny test, and she pointed out various ways that Trump’s announced directives are likely to be struck down under this test.\n\n“The record indicates that none of the funds received by the plaintiff states’ medical institutions have a congressionally authorized condition requiring them to refrain from the provision of gender-affirming care,” wrote Judge King. “And defendants have not shown that Congress has delegated authority to the president to condition federal research grants on compliance with his policy agenda. The president’s power is thus ‘at its lowest ebb.’ Despite this, President Trump’s executive order purports to do something not even Congress is permitted to do: ‘surprise states with post acceptance . . . conditions’ on federal funds, and ‘impose conditions on federal grants that are unrelated to the federal interest in particular national projects and programs.’”\n\nShe characterized the order as “an end-run around the separation of powers,” and, quoting from a Supreme Court decision, wrote that “to hold that the president has ‘the power to switch the Constitution on or off at will’ would ‘permit a striking anomaly in our tripartite system of government,’ but ‘our basic charter cannot be contracted away like this.’”\n\nJudge King agreed with the plaintiffs’ argument that Trump’s order “appears to serve no interest at all save to communicate official, presidentially directed animus against transgender and gender-diverse people, their medical providers, and their families,” finding not credible that the order is intended to protect children from “regret” about being subjected to gender transition by their parents and doctors.\n\nShe also found that the plaintiff states would likely succeed in their argument that under the 10th Amendment, Trump’s directive to the Attorney General to “review Department of Justice enforcement of Section 116 of title 18, U.S. Code, and prioritize enforcement of protections against female genital mutilation” as part of his campaign against gender-affirming care, is an inappropriate attempt to amend a federal statute to a purpose not authorized by Congress. “The Plaintiff States’ legislatures have the exclusive power under the 10th Amendment to criminalize acts committed within those states that lack a federal nexus,” she wrote. “Plaintiff states have not passed any laws criminalizing Listed Services” in Trump’s Order. Although some other states have imposed criminal penalties on health care providers who provide gender-affirming care to minors, the four states who brought his law suit have not done so, and Trump’s attempt to stretch a federal statute to make this a federal crime violates the rights of those states.\n\nAlthough her opinion ends with a grant of a temporary restraining order, Judge King comments that “the balance of equities and the public interest strongly weigh in favor of entering a preliminary injunction,” and “The Rule of law is secured by a strong public interest that the laws ‘enacted by their representatives are not imperiled by executive fiat.”\n\nNormally, temporary restraining orders have only brief duration while the court determines whether to issue a preliminary injunction, which would block enforcement of the order until the court issues a final decision after a trial or in deciding a motion for summary judgment, but it seems likely, given Trump’s usual approach to adverse judicial rulings, that the government may attempt to appeal these temporary orders. If not, preliminary injunctions are likely to follow shortly.\n\nBoth Judge King and Judge Hurson were appointed by President Joe Biden.",

Howie Roseman was working the day of the parade and signed 13 players to reserves/futures deals. The NFL combine is at the end of this month, and Free Agency is shortly after that. The Eagles are playing catch-up after working into February and need to determine which players they will be keeping or letting go. The stay-o-meter has arrived to help decide!\n\nEagles Offense\n\nFeb 9, 2025; New Orleans, LA, USA; Philadelphia Eagles offensive tackle Mekhi Becton (77) celebrates after winning Super Bowl LIX at Caesars Superdome. Mandatory Credit: Geoff Burke-Imagn Images\n\nMekhi Becton is the only offensive starter not signed for next season, and the front office’s faith in Tyler Steen, coupled with what Becton commands on the open market, will likely determine his stay. The rest of the players listed below are not starters, but they are valuable pieces to the Super Bowl team, and the Eagles could have interest retaining all of them.\n\nMekhi Becton (OL) had a career resurrection in Philadelphia. He can play inside or outside and will garner interest in free agency. He has earned every dollar and deserves to see what he can get, but he also loved his time with the Eagles and could take less to stay. Look at his joy.\n\nStay-o-meter coin toss 50%\n\nhttps://twitter.com/PHLEagleNews/status/1889500722623885730\n\nFred Johnson (OL)has stepped up when needed, and it would be a surprise to see him leave the building. He started six games in 2024 and is a valuable OL on the roster. His future could be tied to what happens with Becton, but they should pay him to return either way. He is a great locker room guy, continues to develop, and is reliable.\n\nStay-o-meter 70%\n\nKenny Gainwell (RB) will see his value to another team but could decide that the grass is not ‘greener’ and return on a 1 year contract. He is a perfect fit as the backup and accepts his role. Think Boston Scott.\n\nStay-o-meter 51%\n\nBen VanSumeren (FB LB) is a core special teamer, and he made an impact as a fullback. His development has been impressive. BVS is an exclusive right FA, it would be surprising to see them move away from him.\n\nStay-o-meter 90%\n\nBritain Covey (PR WR) is well-liked and has proven to be a good return man in the punt game. Covey was also showing off his talent as a receiver before being injured.\n\nStay-o-meter 55%\n\nEagles Defense\n\nFootball – NFL – Super Bowl LIX – Philadelphia Eagles v Kansas City Chiefs – Caesars Superdome, New Orleans, Louisiana, United States – February 9, 2025 Philadelphia Eagles’ Zack Baun celebrates with Josh Sweat after intercepting the ball REUTERS/Mike Segar TPX IMAGES OF THE DAY\n\nEight of the Eagles’ eleven defensive starters are under contract for the 2025 season, and those three have been major contributors to the team; two were drafted and developed in Philadelphia, while the other might be one of the greatest free-agent signings in NFL history. (Z. Baun, J. Sweat, & M. Williams)\n\nZack Baun (LB), priority number one, hand selected by Fangio, and seems to believe the Eagles got the best of his abilities\n\n“I’m curious,” he said. “I don’t know what it’s going to look like, honestly. My goal every time is to play the best football that I can. Hopefully it’s here. I love this place, and I really appreciate what they’ve done for my career and my family, and just everything. I got a lot of options to weigh, and a lot of stuff to think about.”\n\nHis meteoric rise to an All-Pro at age 28 is an incredible story, and it appears that both the franchise and Baun know this is a perfect marriage.\n\n“I guess you could say I’ve never felt that sort of stardom. I don’t like the attention, so it’s very different for me. But it’s going to take some adjusting and getting used to because when you bring a Super Bowl to Philly, you’re a legend for life. And it’s just so freaking cool.”\n\nIndeed you are.\n\nStay-o-meter 75%\n\nJosh Sweat (EDGE) didn’t take anything from his locker and indicated that he and the Eagles would like to stay together. I also sense that he was looking forward to seeing what he could make as a free agent. He has hired Drew Rosenhaus as his agent.\n\nStay-o-meter 45%\n\nMilton Williams (DL) wore his agency team hoodie to locker cleanout day, and DTs of his caliber are making 16–20M on the open market, so he is likely gone. The Eagles also have to prepare for Jalen Carter’s extension, which they can do at the end of the 2025 season. Williams made one of the more memorable plays in the Super Bowl with a strip sack of Patrick Mahomes and will be forever a legend in Philadelphia.\n\nStay-o-meter 5%\n\nOren Burks (LB) was a valuable signing as an insurance policy at the linebacker position. He played well late in the season and stepped up just as much after the team lost Nakobe Dean to injury during the wild card round vs the Packers. He should not break the back to return and has proven his worth. I expect him to remain an Eagle and sign a one or two-year contract.\n\nStay-o-meter 75%\n\nIsaiah Rodgers (CB) will be one of the more fascinating scenarios to watch unfold. He played well and could get a nice contract to match. His tenure in Philly could be determined by what the Eagles decide to do with BP Slay. Slay mentioned he would like to play one more season but does not know if the Eagles will be the team to pay him. If he leaves, Rodgers is someone they would likely bring back.\n\nStay-o-meter coin toss 50%\n\nBrandon Graham (DL) will decide to continue playing or sail off into the sunset after his second Lombardi trophy. He has earned the right and trust to make the correct decision. I believe he wants to play and knows he has some juice left in the tank. It would be surprising if he doesn’t ultimately choose to hang them up.\n\nStay-o-meter 10%, likely retires\n\nAvonte Maddox (DB) made a nice PBU in the Super Bowl, and I was happy to see a long-time Eagles player who has had his career derailed by injuries contribute on the biggest stage. He could come back on a minimum deal, but it would be surprising if another team doesn’t offer more this offseason.\n\nStay-o-meter 20%\n\nSpecial Teams:\n\nRick Lovato (LS) should get extended. I never hear his name called for any reason, and as a long snapper, that is a great thing. The Eagles have enjoyed over a decade of excellence from the position transitioning from Jon Dornebos to Rick, and there is no need to stop that now.\n\nStay-o-meter 85%\n\nThe Rest\n\nAug 9, 2024; Baltimore, Maryland, USA; Philadelphia Eagles running back Will Shipley (39) celebrates his first quarter touchdown with tight end C.J.

        "source": "https://metrophiladelphia.com/",
        "fullContent": "Sign up for our Daily Email newsletter to stay up-to-date on the latest local news throughout Philadelphia.\n\nAfter earning a 2022 Oscar for Best Documentary Film with his directorial debut, ‘Summer of Soul (…Or, When the Revolution Could Not Be Televised)’, Philadelphia native Ahmir “Questlove” Thompson—co-founder of The Roots and drummer for The Tonight Show band—was undoubtedly ready for an encore.\n\nInstead of one encore, Questlove gave us two.\n\nFirst is the freshly-released film, the NBC documentary ‘Ladies & Gentlemen… 50 Years of SNL Music‘, to coincide with the 50th anniversary celebration of ‘Saturday Night Live‘, and secondly, this week’s ‘Sly Lives! (aka the Burden of Black Genius),’ is a study of Sly & Family Stone and Black music innovators such as Andre 3000 and D’Angelo.\n\nQuestlove’s ‘Ladies & Gentlemen… 50 Years of SNL Music’ doc features footage of the program’s storied live performances, from the Rolling Stones, David Bowie, Run DMC and more, and can currently be streamed on Peacock. ‘Sly Lives!’ is available for streaming on Hulu.\n\n“When we did ‘Summer of Soul‘, Ahmir and I came from the same starting point — we both knew and loved most of its artists,” says Questlove’s filmmaking partner, Oscar-winning producer Joseph Patel, talking about that 2021 documentary’s list of stars such as Stevie Wonder, Nina Simone, Gladys Knight & the Pips and more.\n\n“With ‘Sly Lives!’, it was Quest who held great importance for Sly Stone,” notes Patel. “That was one of Ahmir’s longtime favorites and one of his most influential artists.”\n\nSly Stone (born Stewart) is a San Francisco psychedelic-era radio DJ turned composer, singer, and musician who revolutionized music with Sly & the Family Stone — a multi-racial, genre-blending band that shattered boundaries between Black and White audiences. With soul-rock-funk-pop crossover hits like ‘Stand!’, ‘Everyday People’, ‘Hot Fun in the Summertime’, and ‘Thank You’, the group left an indelible mark on music history. The latter track, in particular, became a widely sampled staple of 1980s and ‘90s hip-hop, as highlighted in a fast-cut segment of ‘Sly Lives!’ where producers Terry Lewis and Jimmy Jam discuss its influence on Janet Jackson’s ‘Rhythm Nation.’ That same quick-cutting, DJ-like pacing can be found in the first few minutes of ‘Ladies & Gentlemen… 50 Years of SNL Music‘ as Questlove splices and dices what seems like hundreds of live segments — from the B-52s to Olivia Rodriguez — rhythmically, in the blink of an eye.\n\nQuestlove told Billboard magazine that Sly Stone was “essentially” the first Black megastar. “Sly is basically the he embodiment of what Martin Luther King’s ‘I Have a Dream’ speech was about, like this utopian multiracial mix of Black and whites, men and women together.”\n\nPatel goes on to say that he, however, didn’t know Sly’s discography in order, but did know those Family Stone hits, as well as the decline of Sly Stone that followed – the drug addiction, the arrests, the manner in which he missed live concerts and recording dates, and allowed his career to slip away.\n\n“I knew how he tried to win back his fame, that he was a junkie and lived in a camper,” says Patel. “The challenge for me was to become fluent so as to best tell his story and use his life and work as an avatar for this larger idea: the burden of Black genius.”\n\nQuestlove told Deadline that Sly’s undoing at his own hands was “the point of this whole film about self-sabotage. But he wrote the alphabet, and we’re still writing books from that alphabet to this day.”\n\nWhen it comes to the present day, and the ‘Sly’ documentary’s take on the idea of Black genius, Questlove spoke to Black music innovators Vernon Reid, Q-Tip, Chaka Khan, André 3000, and, most particularly D’Angelo — artists whose earliest works broke down barriers of what it means to make Black music, and had issues with how to move forward with the weight of expectation put upon them.\n\n“Can you imagine Sly after having just headlined Woodstock, being on the cover of Rolling Stone, having Black and White America are both looking to you as if you just solved race relations through your music—what pressure that must have been for him?,” asks Patel. “Connecting the stories of Sly and everyone else in the film came down to Ahmir’s own experiences with fame.”",

Ersson got the call-up after being healthy and scratched for the two previous games. Linus Ullmark was not feeling well, which led to Ersson getting his chance to perform on a big platform.\n\nSam Ersson stands out for Team Sweden\n\nErsson made an impressive 32 saves against a strong USA team. The game didn’t start on the right note as Chris Kreider scored for Team USA early on. Luckily for Team Sweden, Gustav Nyquist was able to tie up the game with six minutes remaining in the first frame. The scoring wasn’t done yet as Jesper Bratt was able to give Sweden the lead, which ended up being the final score, 2-1, during the last minute of play in the first.\n\nThis was some of the best hockey Ersson’s played between the pipes. Despite Team USA losing a few players throughout the game, it was a loaded roster, which caused Ersson to shut down. Before the tournament, when speaking with Ersson, he explained the amount of pride he has in being able to represent his country. He took full advantage of the opportunity given to him. On Team USA’s bench, Flyers head coach John Tortorella was serving as an assistant coach.\n\nThe young goalie is finally getting the praise he deserves. He was the Flyers’ backup goalie before taking over the starting goalie role and has faced a lot of criticism not only from fans but also from the national media. It’s been a constant headline that the Flyers have a goalie problem. Despite the never-ending criticism of the netminder job, the Swede stayed mentally strong. When given the opportunity, he flourished. While the Flyers could use a better backup goalie, there is a reason why he does have the job for the orange and black.\n\nThe Flyers return to work on Saturday as they host the Edmonton Oilers, and after Ersson’s outstanding performance, this will give him a confidence boost.\n\nMandatory Credit: John Jones-Imagn Images",

Shortly after, data from the Philadelphia Department of Public Health showed a similar trend: Fatal overdoses across the city decreased 7% in 2023, from 1,207 to 1,122. The city is expected to release its 2024 data in the spring of 2025.\n\nWhile these declines are notable, the city’s 2023 fatal overdose numbers are three times higher than they were in 2013.\n\nStill, if 2024 numbers confirm the downward trend, it allows a little hope into an otherwise bleak epidemic that is killing more Philadelphians than homicides, car accidents and diabetes combined.\n\nSomething may finally be working. But what?\n\nIf over a decade spent treating and researching substance use disorders has taught me anything, it’s that the overdose epidemic is what researchers and policymakers refer to as a wicked problem. Wicked problems are constantly changing, complex, interconnected knots of other problems with no clear solution.\n\nBut let’s look at what we do know about how overdose deaths in Philadelphia spiked in the first place – and why they may finally be decreasing.\n\nWhy overdose deaths spiked\n\nThe first wave of the overdose epidemic began in the late 1990s and is attributed to overprescription of opioid pain medicines. But the largest acceleration in deaths didn’t occur until after the government and health insurers implemented prescribing controls in the early 2010s. These controls led many people who were no longer able to get prescribed opioids to turn to illicit heroin.\n\nIn a phenomenon known as the “iron law of prohibition,” stricter drug law enforcement led drug-trafficking organizations to shift from heroin toward more powerful synthetic opioids that are easier to produce, conceal and distribute. Gram for gram, pure fentanyl is over 50 times stronger than pure heroin.\n\nBut street-obtained fentanyl has proven to be anything but pure.\n\nLocal drug-testing efforts found as much as a fiftyfold difference in potency between bags of fentanyl that appear identical.\n\nThis unpredictable potency is considered to be the chief contributor to the deadliness of street fentanyl. It’s like cracking a beer and not knowing whether drinking it will get you mildly buzzed or send you to the graveyard.\n\nResearch suggests drug busts, though touted as improving public safety, can lead to more inconsistency and unpredictability in the potency of illicit opioids. An analysis of 14 studies conducted in the U.S. demonstrated a marked increase in fatal overdoses following the supply disruptions that result from drug seizures.\n\nThere’s also some evidence that the heightened economic insecurity and despair caused by the COVID-19 pandemic may have intensified the fatal overdose epidemic.\n\nPotential reasons for decline\n\nJust as economic insecurity was associated with rising deaths, the subsequent economic recovery as the U.S. emerged from the pandemic may have contributed to the 2023 drop in overdose fatalities nationwide.\n\nHowever, the unequal distribution of that recovery seems to track with worsening racial disparities in overdose rates in the late 2010s to early 2020s.\n\nAnother possible explanation for the reduction in overdose deaths is the increasing availability of buprenorphine.\n\nBuprenorphine, an FDA-approved medication for opioid use disorder, reduces withdrawal and cravings for fentanyl. What’s more, it decreases overdose risk by more than 50%.\n\nHowever, efforts to increase access to this medication have stagnated. National prescribing rates for buprenorphine were relatively stable from 2019 to 2023, and the CDC estimates that only a quarter of those who need treatment are getting it. Efforts to make buprenorphine available without a prescription have not yet gained traction.\n\nAccess to and education around naloxone, a lifesaving drug used to reverse opioid overdoses, has also increased, and the drug is increasingly being administered by bystanders. Over 1.3 million doses were distributed in Pennsylvania since 2017. National research suggests these distribution efforts, often spearheaded by local harm-reduction organizations, have led to quicker administration of naloxone. This saves lives while also decreasing reliance on emergency medical services.\n\nFinally, the consequences of a seemingly minor characteristic of fentanyl’s pharmacology might also be reducing the overdose death rate in Philadelphia.\n\nFentanyl’s effects last only a third as long as heroin. This shorter duration led drug traffickers to add the animal tranquilizer xylazine – also called “tranq” – and the veterinary anesthetic medetomidine into Philadelphia’s street drug supply. In 2019, two-thirds of heroin or fentanyl sampled in Philadelphia had xylazine in it. By 2021 all of it did.\n\nThese additives lengthen the duration of the effect, mitigate withdrawal symptoms and possibly reduce the amount of fentanyl needed per dose. Some evidence from animal studies shows that xylazine reduces fentanyl intake by suppressing fentanyl withdrawal, thereby lengthening the time before a person uses again.\n\nWhat’s more, the skin wounds and sedative effects that are associated with xylazine may be motivating some people to avoid using street fentanyl.\n\nWhat’s next for Philadelphia\n\nThe opioid settlement, a multibillion-dollar payment from the pharmaceutical industry to resolve legal actions against them, has led to increased funding in Philadelphia for naloxone and medications such as buprenorphine to treat opioid use disorder.\n\nHowever, in the past year the city eliminated funding for needle exchanges and implemented compulsory treatment strategies, which research suggests often do not reduce drug use or criminal recidividism.\n\nMeanwhile, at the federal level, Republican members of Congress have proposed cuts to Medicaid, the health insurance program for low-income Americans.\n\nWhether new data, when it’s released, will show overdose deaths in Philly have continued to decline or are back on the rise is anybody’s guess. But I do know that harm-reduction advocates, medical providers and communities of people who use drugs will continue to fight this epidemic as if their lives depend on it. For many, it does.\n\nBen Cocchiaro is an Assistant Clinical Professor of Family Medicine and Community Health at Drexel University.",

        "fullContent": "Sign up for our Daily Email newsletter to stay up-to-date on the latest local news throughout Philadelphia.\n\nAhead of the band’s upcoming performance at the Keswick Theater, Travis frontman Fran Healy sat down with Metro to discuss the band’s most recent album, ‘L.A. Times’, their creative process as innovators, and the experience of live music.\n\nYour latest album, ‘L.A. Times’ — can you break down its inspiration?\n\nIt was me venting about LA and having lived there for eight years. And just like I was like, ‘That’s enough, [I] can’t take any more.’ The whole album was written while I lived in LA, and song-wise, I would say there’s a bit of everything. There’s a lot of reflection and a lot of looking back. But, honestly, [when] writing songs, your entire experience kind of comes out in a song. If you’re writing in a proper way, which is just like digging until you find something, you bring it to the surface, and it starts to become something.\n\nThe first song is me looking back to Glasgow, waiting on a bus, and then this metaphor of a bus being like life, your kind of mortality. It’s a bit deep, but I’m thinking about it. I’m 51, I’m a father. So I’m thinking about stuff like that. Song two is called ‘Raze The Bar,’ which is about this brilliant bar in New York. It’s got nothing to do with LA, but I think living in LA has made me really long for everything outside of LA. So I’m thinking about New York and the third song, it’s a breakup song, looking at my relationship with my ex, looking at my relationship with my son.\n\nAnd then the fourth song is ‘Gaslight,’ which is just a song about being gaslit for quite a while and getting emancipation, that sort of thing, fighting back against those a–holes. I think there’s been a lot of the tectonic movement in my life, emotional plates moving big, big, big things happening, people dying, people leaving, weeding the garden, so to speak, and then coming out the other side of it and this record sort of chronicles all of that sort of movement.\n\nYou’ve said that for you, the process is not to write songs for charts but to write based on life. Can you delve into that a bit?\n\nEvery song [I’ve ever written] is about something. There’s about 5% of our business that, I would say, innovates. And I think a lot of music, that 95% of music in the charts, is that other type of music. When Travis got massive, like no one even knew we existed, and then suddenly, the next year, we were so different than everything else that everything else had to change to fit in with us. So you find all these bands suddenly sounding like you. We were part of the 5% that just does its thing and, just by chance, became popular, and then the whole business then goes, Oh, we gotta sound like this because this is popular.\n\nSo they all follow; it’s like the flock follows whatever it is. And so I’ve never stopped writing like that. So when we’re suddenly very popular, then suddenly The Strokes come along, I’m not going to suddenly sound like The Strokes just to be popular. That just so goes against the grain of what I’m about. We’re not that kind of band. But again, bands that I love are bands like us that are the 5% bands that just cut their own; they cut their own [teeth]. And I think it’s maybe a little bit more interesting than someone who or a writer who is constantly just trying to stay in fashion…\n\nAuthenticity is one big thing for us. Just be who you are, no matter what that is. Two, art because we all went to art school. We’re an art school band. And three mischief. I’m not so cheeky in real life. I can be, but I’m much more so on the stage… And so we decided that everything we put out has to have those three things in it. And there’s a fourth thing, which is storytelling. It’s a big part of what we do. And the live shows really encapsulated all of those elements together.\n\nThis seems to parallel a lyric by My Morning Jacket from the song ‘Wordless Chorus,’ which says “We are the innovators, they are the imitators. ” Does it seem to be that same type of idea?\n\nThat’s the perfect comparison, yeah, Jim [James] is amazing.\n\nWhat can fans coming to see Travis expect, and why should they be excited?\n\nLet’s talk about My Morning Jacket for a second and not talk about Travis as an example. You listen to ‘Z’ (the album that features ‘Wordless Chorus’), if you listen to it, and that’s the band in a studio playing as much live, hopefully as possible, and then you turn it up on your stereo, and to get the heavy guitars louder, to get the experience that’s like 1% of of the band you’re getting.\n\nIn order to completely get that band, you have to go and see them live. You have to go and stand at the feet of Jim James and hear his roar, watch the guitar, just see the way the guitarist runs across the stage. And that’s where music really resides. I mean, it really is. Seeing a band live is, that’s it. You get the whole DNA of everything and albums, not to knock albums, because albums are art pieces in themselves, but if you really want to get into a band or understand the band.\n\n[Travis is] very artistic. We’re very silly up front, not silly, but entertaining on stage and we’re serious as well. And have quite a lot to say. But it’s cool, it’s just real. And it’s, there’s no backing tracks or anything, and it’s like four guys just f–king hitting their s–t out their instruments and making something out of it.\n\nCatch ‘Travis’ at the Keswick Theater on Tuesday, Feb. 18, for more information, visit keswicktheatre.com",

For the Amite City native, it was a homecoming of sorts.\n\n“I think it was just being back at home,” Smith reflected. “[I’m] very familiar with that building, played two state championships in it, being home in front of the family, I think that was it more so that than anything.”\n\nFeb 9, 2025; New Orleans, LA, USA; Philadelphia Eagles wide receiver DeVonta Smith (6) makes a catch for a touchdown against Kansas City Chiefs cornerback Jaylen Watson (35) during the second half of Super Bowl LIX at Caesars Superdome.

Smith added a Super Bowl to his resume, which already included a state championship appearance, two college football championships at Alabama, a Heisman trophy, and much more. Among Smith’s many accolades is his record of the most playoff receiving yards in Philadelphia Eagles history (595 yards).\n\nWhen asked by Philly Sports Network what the future held for Smith and his Eagles, he simply replied with a single, powerful statement: “Try to repeat it.”\n\nIt’s clear that while Smith had plans to enjoy this victory, next season is already on his mind.\n\nFootball – NFL – Super Bowl LIX – Philadelphia Eagles v Kansas City Chiefs – Caesars Superdome, New Orleans, Louisiana, United States – February 9, 2025 Philadelphia Eagles’ A.J.

However, on the biggest stage, Smith continued to prove his doubters wrong, coming up large in the biggest moments on the biggest stage.\n\nIn parting, Smith addressed the next generation, specifically those who, like him, have been doubted because of their size.\n\nPhiladelphia Eagles’ star wide receiver DeVonta Smith takes a photo with a fan at an autograph signing at the Dick’s Sporting Goods in Deptford, New Jersey.\n\n“Trust your training.

        "fullContent": "Sign up for our Daily Email newsletter to stay up-to-date on the latest local news throughout Philadelphia.\n\nAn action film where half of it takes place on the side of a building—it sounds like a tall order, but director Martin Campbell’s ‘Cleaner’ is here to serve this high-octane feature on a platter. Starring Daisy Ridley, Clive Owen and Taz Skylar, the film centers on Joey (Ridley), a high-rise window cleaner who finds herself involved in a hostage situation with radical activists. Joey has a unique set of skills that lends to her having to save the building and its inhabitants, including her brother.\n\nTo talk about the sky-high role and filming, Ridley sat down with Metro, delving into her character and the training that went in to creating ‘Cleaner.’\n\nWhat made you want to sign on with this film?\n\nFirst and foremost, it was Martin Campbell’s name written there. I thought, wow I love his movies—that was really exciting. And then I found the script very propulsive… you always hope that there’s going to be a happy ending, but for so long it feels so rocky that I remember thinking, how is this going to be figured out?\n\nThen getting to balance all of that with the relationship I have with my brother [played by Matthew Tuck] in the movie, and the complicated nature of that dynamic. Plus the fact that Joey has made a lot of mistakes but spends most of the film trying to make up for them, she’s trying to take accountability for what she’s done. I just thought it was a really beautiful emotional throughline amongst all of the fun action-packed stuff.\n\nMartin Campbell definitely knows how to build action films around characters that you root for. With your character, Joey, what do you like about her and what can you tease about her emotional journey in the film?\n\nI really like that she’s upfront. It’s very clear from early on that she has made some real missteps and that she’s pretty selfish in the way that she lives. And of course, you learn over time that she and her brother had a really difficult time growing up. Her brother has autism and has lived in a place that means he does not have the freedom that she does. So the balance of that is honestly very relatable and probably very understandable to a lot of people.\n\nBut I like that she’s scrappy and I like that she owns up to what she does, and I like that it gets to a point where she says: It literally does not matter what happens to me, everything is in service of my brother. I think it’s a good fable. [With] us all, we assume there will be time to make the right choice next week or see the friend you haven’t seen for a year next week— you just don’t know what’s going to happen. And for the most part, this won’t happen because it’s heightened, but I like that feeling…the immediacy of what is the right thing to do right now?\n\nWhat went into your preparation for filming? I know part of the time was spent on the side of a building in Canada.\n\nWe filmed some of it there, and for the most part, it was done in a studio. But I did have window cleaning lessons, and honestly, it’s so hard to do it without leaving a streak. And so that in and of itself is tricky. Then there were two ways you could do it: You’re either in the harness or you’re in the cradle, and even in the harness, it’s so tricky figuring out how you can get close enough to do what you need to do.\n\nHonestly, whenever I see people up there, I think [they] are amazing because the thought of it actually turns my stomach. And of course, people get so comfortable with that height. But it’s also quite meditative in a lovely way. And it’s funny that she then has her boss in her ear who is so annoying while she’s just trying to get her day done.\n\nAnd how about prepping for some of the action scenes that Joey is involved in?\n\nI had maybe six weeks of training beforehand. A lot of it was getting the physicality and the understanding of how Joey moves. There were two big fights at the end of the movie, and I wanted those to feel really aggressive and gnarly and realistic for the situation that she’s in. A lot of that was feeling very comfortable with the person that you’re fighting with on screen. Then you really know each other and it’s like a dance of proximity.\n\nIt must have been interesting for you with filming—for half of the film, you’re acting on your own in scenes, and then the other half you’re fighting.\n\nYeah, it was. I had my hair, makeup and costume team who were amazing, [but] for the most part, I was alone. I always was talking to someone, so I could hear, and I always knew the performance on the other side. So, I weirdly didn’t really feel alone. But then when I was with people, I thought, oh, this is so strange.\n\nSince Martin Campbell was a big factor in your signing on, how was it working with him?\n\nI was in an interesting position—we would sometimes be filming scene 12 and then we’d be going to film scene 98 because of where the cradle was that I stand on for a lot of it. And of course, I knew what was going on in every scene, but I was looking to Martin to help guide me emotionally in those moments. He had written every single scene, what was happening, what had just happened before, what had just happened after this whole page.\n\nSo if we were going on to scene 50, he would have it written, which was amazing. It’s just that extra layer of knowing and trusting Martin. It’s tricky with such high-octane emotions and making sure to maintain that level of adrenaline. So having him there was so wonderful, I just think he’s an amazing, amazing director.\n\nIn terms of an action film, what stands out to you about ‘Cleaner’?\n\nI feel like it’s a great British action movie, which I haven’t seen too recently. So that’s really nice. But I think with all of the films that we love, we watch for the action—but you have to root for who you’re watching and you have to understand why the people are doing what they’re doing. So I hope that this does that in that it’s a great action movie, but at the center of it, there’s a relationship between a brother and sister who love each other and are just trying to do their best for each other.\n\n‘Cleaner’ will release in theaters Feb. 21. Tickets are now available on Fandango",

        "fullContent": "Sign up for our email newsletter to stay up-to-date on the latest local sports news throughout Philadelphia.\n\nComing off of an incredible rookie year that saw him become a Super Bowl champion, Philadelphia Eagles‘ cornerback Cooper DeJean held an autograph signing on Saturday, Feb. 15, at a Dick’s Sporting Goods store located in Wilmington, Delaware. In between the hordes of fans who came to see him, DeJean briefly addressed the media, reflecting on his unforgettable pick-six, the recent victory in Super Bowl LIX, and the support he’s felt from Philly fans.\n\nLess than 24 hours after a parade celebrating a Super Bowl victory, there are certain — we’ll call them — logistical challenges that could temp one to avoid spending hours with hundreds, potentially a thousand-plus screaming fans under fluorescent lights while Scatman John inexplicably blarred throughout the store. Full credit to DeJean for not canceling or changing the details of his previously agreed appearance in any way and supporting the fans who have supported him throughout the season.\n\nPhiladelphia Eagles’ star cornerback Cooper DeJean poses with a family of fans.\n\nMeeting, greeting, and shaking hands with the masses, Cooper’s victory tour since coming back to Greater Philadelphia continued to be a roaring success.\n\nLooking back on the year, DeJean began 2024 coming off a fractured fibula, which prematurely ended his final season in Iowa. From the lows of a season cut short to being drafted in the second round by the Philadelphia Eagles, becoming their starting slot corner, and playing a crucial role on the NFL’s top defense in his rookie season, it was quite the roller coaster of a year for the young defensive back but it all culminated on Sunday, Feb. 9.\n\nFeb 9, 2025; New Orleans, LA, USA; Philadelphia Eagles cornerback Cooper DeJean (33) scores a touchdown after making an interception against the Kansas City Chiefs during the first half of Super Bowl LIX at Caesars Superdome. Mandatory Credit: Bill Streicher-Imagn Images\n\nNotable as both the day Super Bowl LIX would take place and Cooper DeJean’s 22nd birthday, the evening of Feb. 9 brought plenty of excitement for Philadelphia’s youngest Eagle. As if the appearance alone were not thrilling enough, DeJean made a landmark play in his career, his first interception, but this was no ordinary interception.\n\nFew could construct a moment more exciting than picking off arguably the greatest player in NFL history and returning it for a touchdown en route to winning the Super Bowl on your birthday. Life is full of amazements that defy the odds, from the miracle of birth to the complexities of the human eye, and yet, what Cooper DeJean accomplished, considering the factors that played into the moment, is similarly awe-inspiring.\n\nThe Kansas City Chiefs were the favorites coming into the game and seemed to many to be only a few hours away from the first team to win three straight Super Bowls. Patrick Mahomes had never thrown a pick-six in any of his previous playoff appearances. The idea was completely alien, and yet, as they say, there’s a first time for everything.\n\nFeb 9, 2025; New Orleans, LA, USA; Philadelphia Eagles cornerback Cooper DeJean (33) celebrates with teammates after returning an interception for a touchdown against the Kansas City Chiefs during the first half of Super Bowl LIX at Caesars Superdome. Mandatory Credit: Geoff Burke-Imagn Images\n\nLaying down the details around the moment, from the play to the opponent, the stage, and so on, Cooper DeJean discussed with Philly Sports Network the moment, how it ranked in his career, and how, as incredible it was, another moment that same night outshone it.\n\n“Yeah, it’s up there, right? It was pretty awesome, a pretty awesome moment for me, for my team really. In that moment, me getting my first pick, in the Super Bowl, on my birthday. But then, winning the game as well. That was the best part about it, getting that Lombardi trophy.”\n\nSince that moment, holding the Lombardi in his rookie season, life has moved quickly for DeJean. He returned to Philadelphia, took part in Philadelphia’s ultimate celebration, and then found himself the man of the hour as swarms of Eagles fans surrounded a sporting goods store just to meet him. It’s a lot of love DeJean has felt from the Philly Phaithful since his arrival, and not a moment of it has been lost on him.\n\nPhiladelphia Eagles’ star cornerback Cooper DeJean poses with a fan at a Dick’s Sporting Goods store located in Wilmington, DE.\n\n“I felt welcomed ever since I got here. I love everybody in the city. I love how supportive they are, how much they care. I couldn’t imagine they’ll play getting play anywhere else.”",

We are that much closer to baseball season, meaning we’re so close to hearing “BEER, BEER, BEER, BEER, BEEEEEEER” on our televisions for a month.\n\nThe Phillies were relatively quiet this offseason and lost pitchers Jeff Hoffman (Blue Jays) and Carlos Estévez (Royals) to free agency. Fans have questions about the roster, and we have answers! I teamed up with fellow Philadelphia Sports Network writer Shaun Nestor to answer some of those questions.\n\nWhich Phillies reliever will lead the team in saves at the end of the year?\n\nKylee: I’ll have to go with Orion Kerkering. Before I go into this, I want to make it clear I have a ton of faith in Jordan Romano. I just believe Kerkering will take that big of a leap forward and be the backbone that the Phillies need following Jeff Hoffman’s departure to Toronto.\n\nShaun: This may not be the popular answer, but I think Jordan Romano does the job there. Especially in Rob Thomson’s system of “bullpen by committee,” Romano’s experience will get him the bulk of the action while Jose Alvarado, Orion Kerkering, Matt Strahm, and others get their time in the 9th as well.\n\nPredict a Phillies trade deadline addition\n\nKylee: I think the Phillies will go after a relief pitcher. I don’t think it’ll be a high-end reliever because I believe Romano and Kerkering will take over, but more options in relief can’t possibly do any harm.\n\nShaun: You know, nothing stands out as a huge need to be filled at the trade deadline yet to me. But I’m going to go out on a limb here: a package likely involving one of Miller, Crawford, or Tait to the Brewers for Devin Williams and Rhys Hoskins. Spicy enough for you?\n\nAug 15, 2024; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA; Philadelphia Phillies outfielder Johan Rojas (18) hits an RBI single during the fourth inning against the Washington Nationals at Citizens Bank Park. Mandatory Credit: Bill Streicher-USA TODAY Sports\n\nAre there any position battles in camp?\n\nKylee: The obvious one is centerfield with Brandon Marsh and Johan Rojas, but you could argue the closer role has a position battle. As it stands, Jordan Romano is expected to have the Jeff Hoffman/main closer role, but I wouldn’t be surprised to see Orion Kerkering have a shot at the spot if Romano starts slow.\n\nShaun: If anything, Brandon Marsh and Johan Rojas will battle for the center field job, but I fully expect that to remain at the status quo with a platoon.\n\nWhat prospects not named Andrew Painter can you see getting called up this season?\n\nKylee: I would be very shocked to see Justin Crawford and Aidan Miller up this season. Dave Dombrowski already said he sees Miller as a 2026 at-best guy. With that in mind, I would expect to see Mick Abel up at some point. I don’t think he’ll make it right out of camp, but I see it happening by the trade deadline.\n\nShaun: Technically I expect Mick Abel will make the Phillies bullpen out of camp, but that’s not really what this question is asking. If anything, I would expect Jean Cabrera, Seth Johnson, or Griff McGarry to come up at some point to fill in for an injury here or there, but I wouldn’t get my hopes up for Aidan Miller or Justin Crawford just yet.\n\nMandatory Credit: Jonathan Dyer-Imagn Images",

        "fullContent": "Sign up for our email newsletter to stay up-to-date on the latest local sports news throughout Philadelphia.\n\nThe 2025 MLS season starts this week, and it’s time to start thinking about the expectations a new season brings. For the Philadelphia Union, The past few seasons have been about punching above their weight to try to win the League. Just two seasons ago, they were minutes away from doing that before falling in penalty kicks against LAFC. Since then, Philly decided to run it back two years in a row. This led to falling short of their own expectation; they missed the playoffs for the first time in years last season, leading to the firing of longtime coach Jim Curtin and the beginning of a roster rebuild.\n\nNow, expectations are different. Bradley Carnell is readying this team to take on Orlando to open the MLS season this coming weekend. However, the landscape of the club is different. They aren’t in as many competitions as they were when they were more successful. They aren’t in the Concacaf Champions Cup or Leagues Cup in 2025. This year, it’s just MLS and the historic US Open Cup. There’s much less competition and money up for the taking this year, which means the expectations have changed. As we look at expectations ahead of the season, there are five areas in which the Union can be assessed.\n\nThe MLS Campaign\n\nThe US Open Cup\n\nPlayer Development\n\nCoaching Tactics/Adaptability\n\nThe overall club culture/vibes\n\nFor now, we’ll focus on the Union’s MLS expectations for 2025. We’ll discuss the other aspects in the days before the start of the season.\n\nSep 18, 2024; New York, New York, USA; Philadelphia Union midfielder Jesus Bueno (20) reacts after a play against New York City FC at Yankee Stadium. Mandatory Credit: Mark Smith-Imagn Images\n\nPhiladelphia Union’s MLS Expectations\n\nThe MLS season is the Union’s main focus, and we know that Philadelphia likes to keep the main focus the same right now. The Union is rebuilding, so what are its expectations for 2025?\n\nFor any expectation, there is a baseline success, an unmitigated failure, and an overachieving success. These are the three outcomes for an expectation. Let’s examine how the Union could actualize these expectations in its 2025 MLS campaign.\n\nSep 18, 2024; New York, New York, USA; Philadelphia Union midfielder Daniel Gazdag (10) celebrates after scoring a goal against New York City FC with forward Tai Baribo (28) during the first half at Yankee Stadium. Mandatory Credit: Mark Smith-Imagn Images\n\nBaseline Success: Make Playoffs\n\nIt’s pretty evident right now that the baseline expectation for this Philadelphia Union side is to make it to the playoffs. They failed to do so last year, and all of their efforts in MLS this season should be to make it back. The idea of winning trophies is likely not in question this year, but being able to play in the playoffs again and possibly go on a “magical run” is not out of the question.\n\n10 teams out of the 15 in MLS’s Eastern Conference make the playoffs, so this is not shooting for the moon here. It should be expected that Philly could be one of the top 10 teams in their conference. However, if they aren’t, it may be time for changes not on the roster or in the coaching staff…\n\nMandatory Credit: Philadelphia Union\n\nUnmitigated Failure: Miss playoffs for a 2nd season in a row\n\nThis season, the biggest failure for Philadelphia would be missing out on the MLS Cup playoffs. As mentioned, only five teams out of 15 don’t make the playoffs from the Eastern Conference. Should Philly fall anywhere between 11th and 15th place, there will be hell to pay.\n\nWe all know that the Union isn’t like other MLS teams. They tend to take a frugal approach to their team building. They don’t spend a lot on players. They like to utilize promoting players from their second team or academy to become difference makers and find diamonds in the rough to come in and be the “stars.” If this doesn’t work again, the 2025 season will be nothing but a failure.\n\nSep 28, 2024; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA; Philadelphia Union midfielder Alejandro Bedoya (11) reacts against Atlanta United in the second half at Subaru Park.

What if Philly can overachieve so much that they finish at the top of the Eastern Conference? A top-four finish would mean hosting the opening playoff series and a better chance at having home-field advantage throughout an improbable playoff run.\n\nFor this to happen, all of Philly’s new diamond-in-the-rough signings will have to hit, and young players like Cavan Sullivan and the rest of the homegrown will have to ball out. You can never say never in MLS, but this would be a massive overachievement for a new coach and a rebuilt roster. It would be the most “That’s So Union” thing ever if the 2025 Union were able to finish in the top four of the East when no one was expecting that type of finish from them.\n\nSep 28, 2024; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA; Philadelphia Union defender Nathan Harriel (26) celebrates with teammates after scoring a goal against Atlanta United in the second half at Subaru Park.

After a lengthy and grueling season, Philadelphia heads into the offseason with a few questions to answer.\n\nIn the latest edition of my Eagles mailbag, I’ll discuss Philadelphia’s next offensive coordinator, biggest offseason needs and much more regarding the team moving forward.\n\n@laAJbrownance asked, “Who is your personal favorite for the OC job?”\n\nNov 24, 2024; Inglewood, California, USA; Philadelphia Eagles head coach Nick Sirianni watches game action against the Los Angeles Rams during the second half at SoFi Stadium. Mandatory Credit: Gary A. Vasquez-Imagn Images\n\nNathan Scheelhaase is a potential offensive coordinator candidate that I have previously mentioned. Scheelhaase reportedly withdrew from the running for the Jacksonville Jaguars’ offensive coordinator opening to remain with the Los Angeles Rams earlier in February. Yet he has previously interviewed with the Eagles prior to the team promoting Brian Johnson in 2023.\n\nScheelhaase worked under Iowa State head coach Matt Campbell for several years, who is a close friend and former college teammate of Eagles head coach Nick Sirianni. Last season, Scheelhaase serves as the Rams pass game specialist and “play drawer” for Sean McVay.\n\nGiven his potential, Scheelhaase is certainly my personal favorite candidate for Philadelphia’s offensive coordinator opening. Although, the early indications are that Kevin Patullo will be promoted to fill that role for the Eagles in 2025.\n\n@BrentleyDOliver asked, “What is the biggest need for the Eagles for next season?”\n\nFeb 9, 2025; New Orleans, LA, USA; Philadelphia Eagles defensive tackle Milton Williams (93) celebrates on the podium after defeating the Kansas City Chiefs in Super Bowl LIX at Ceasars Superdome. Mandatory Credit: Mark J. Rebilas-Imagn Images\n\nFour of Philadelphia’s starters from their Super Bowl winning roster are set to hit free agency: Mekhi Becton, Josh Sweat, Milton Williams and Zack Baun. There’s also a chance that Nakobe Dean could miss a significant amount of time due to his knee injury next season as well.\n\nYet Eagles general manager Howie Roseman has strategically built this roster to have in-house replacements at several positions of potential weakness in 2025. Therefore, Philadelphia’s biggest positions of need are more long-term.\n\nHere’s how I would rank the top five needs for the Eagles this offseason:\n\nDefensive Tackle: Milton Williams will likely command a massive contract in free agency and the Eagles need to keep the potential fifth-year option for Jordan Davis and contract extension for Jalen Carter in mind. Offensive Tackle: Lane Johnson isn’t getting any younger and both of Philadelphia’s offensive tackles missed time this past season. Fred Johnson filled in admirably off the bench but he’ll be a free agent. Tight End: Dallas Goedert is essentially guaranteed to miss multiple games each season and Grant Calcaterra was far too inconsistent to be a reliable replacement for the 30-year-old tight end moving forward. Edge Defender: While both Josh Sweat and Brandon Graham could be done in Philadelphia, the Eagles still have a ton of potential on the edge in Nolan Smith and Jalyx Hunt. Cornerback: Quinyon Mitchell and Cooper DeJean are absolute studs. Yet Darius Slay’s future in Philadelphia is murky due to his contract situation and Isaiah Rodgers is set to become a free agent this offseason.\n\n@VladdyMuse asked, “Do you expect any contract restructure(s)? If so, who?”\n\nDec 31, 2023; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA; Philadelphia Eagles general manager Howie Roseman (middle) and head coach Nick Sirianni (L) walk from the tunnel before a game against the Arizona Cardinals at Lincoln Financial Field. Mandatory Credit: Bill Streicher-USA TODAY Sports\n\nRoseman has shown over the years that he is willing to get creative with contract structure to create additional cap space. One potential option would be to restructure Saquon Barkley’s current contract, converting a portion of his base salary into a signing bonus to free up around $1.3 million in 2025.\n\nLane Johnson has talked about playing for a few more years as well. Therefore, he could help the Eagles out by restructuring his current contract and freeing up nearly $3 million in 2025 as well.\n\nPhiladelphia could also create nearly $4 million in cap space in 2025 by restructuring Dallas Goedert’s contract. Yet given his lengthy injury history, he could actually be a sneaky cut or trade candidate this offseason as well.\n\n@Michael93826345 asked, “Who are some edge free agents that intrigue you?”\n\nSep 22, 2024; Cleveland, Ohio, USA; New York Giants linebacker Bobby Okereke (58) and New York Giants linebacker Azeez Ojulari (51) celebrate after a sack during the first quarter against the Cleveland Browns at Huntington Bank Field. Mandatory Credit: Ken Blaze-Imagn Images\n\nFangio has earned the right to have his finger prints all over the construction of Philadelphia’s defense moving forward. It’s clear that the Bryce Huff project didn’t work as planned, which is why Fangio could look to reunite with two of his former players in 2025.\n\nKhalil Mack is a decorated veteran that has essentially done it all except win a Super Bowl in the NFL. Fangio and Mack spent once season together in 2018 and Philadelphia’s defensive coordinator still praises the 33-year-old veteran today. If Mack wants to chase a Super Bowl ring, he could sign with the Eagles in free agency.\n\nBaron Browning was a third-round pick by the Denver Broncos in Fangio’s final season as the team’s head coach. Browning has been inconsistent in the NFL thus far and could reunite with Fangio to revitalize his career in 2025.\n\nAzeez Ojulari is just 24-years-old and showed a ton of promise with the New York Giants at times. While the Giants confusingly refused to trade Ojulari in a contract year, he would thrive as a rotational pass rusher in Philadelphia. Especially given the chance to reunite with several of his former teammates from the University of Georgia.\n\nMandatory Credit: Stephen Lew-Imagn Images",

        "fullContent": "Sign up for our email newsletter to stay up-to-date on the latest local sports news throughout Philadelphia.\n\nBuckle up, Union fans. Today is the last Monday without Philadelphia Union soccer until at least mid-October, and I’m happy to announce that I’ll be back covering the team’s journey through the MLS season for the 3rd consecutive year – for better or for worse.\n\n2025 marks the first season with new Head Coach Bradley Carnell at the helm, and there are still a few questions that need answering heading into a season that could have big implications for the club’s future direction. Let’s take a look at a few of those before Union’s first match of the 2025 season on Saturday night in Orlando.\n\nImage Credit: Philadelphia Union\n\n1) Carnell’s preferred starting XI and formation\n\nCarnell used several main formations during his time with St. Louis – 4-2-3-1, 4-2-2-2, and a 4-4-2 diamond, to name a few. Given the personnel and the fact that these players were familiar with a 4-4-2 diamond formation under the previous manager, Jim Curtin, I would favor Carnell rolling out the team in that type of setup, though I wouldn’t be entirely shocked by a 4-2-2-2.\n\nI’m taking a stab at it, but here’s my best guess as to how things would be lined up in a 4-4-2 diamond on Saturday night – given everyone is healthy and ready to go\n\nGK: Andre Blake\n\nRB: Nate Harriel, CB:Jakob Glesnes, CB: Ian Glavinovich, LB: Kai Wagner\n\nCDM: Jovan Lukić\n\nRCM: Quinn Sullivan, LCM: Danley Jean-Jacques\n\nCAM: Daniel Gazdag\n\nST: Mikael Uhre, Tai Baribo\n\nImage Credit: Philadelphia Union\n\n2) Will Carnell be able to make adjustments?\n\nFrom the small bits of pre-season action we’ve had access to, it’s clear Carnell is going to play Ernst Tanner’s desired style of Red-Bull-inspired soccer, which implements an over-the-top intense high-press that Carnell hopes will result in a 60-30-10 split on the attacking end – 60% of goals scored coming from transition, 30% from set pieces, and just 10% from possession.\n\nBut what happens when the Union plays a well-organized, low-block defensive team that forces them to play with the ball and create opportunities? What happens when Union goes down 1-0 early in the game, and the other team parks the bus? Will Carnell be able to adjust and tweak the squad to bring a different look to the pitch to try and change the game? Or will this Union team struggle to adjust and play with flexibility like they did under Jim Curtin at times?\n\nNov 2, 2024; Chester, Pennsylvania, USA; General view of Subaru Park before the game between Philadelphia Union II and Columbus Crew 2. Mandatory Credit: Caean Couto-Imagn Images\n\n3) Who’s the first player off the bench?\n\nIt’s been an issue each of the last two seasons – who do Union turn to on the bench to change the game when it’s not going the way they want?\n\n37-year-old veteran Midfielder Ale Bedoya will likely be one of the first players Bradley Carnell turns to on the bench this season. Bedoya registered 2 goals and 4 assists in just under 1,500 MLS minutes last season and showed he still had it in him to impact games both in the starting XI and off the bench, but I don’t think he should be depended on as the main guy to come off the bench and get you a goal when it’s needed most.\n\nAlternatively to Bedoya’s veteran presence, 2025 will be the season of introducing Union’s youth to the big stage. Players like Cavan Sullivan, Jeremy Rafanello, CJ Olney, and David Vazquez will likely get opportunities to make an impact off the bench as well in 2025.\n\nAnd, of course, once the signing of Bruno Damiani is finalized, which seems to be all but official at this point, the Union will have 3 MLS-ready strikers in their arsenal. I’d expect Damiani to start on the bench while he gets acclimated, but I wouldn’t be surprised to see him eventually take one of the starting spots, moving either Mikael Uhre or Tai Baribo to the bench and giving Union more solid options to bring on late in the game.\n\nImage Credit: Philadelphia Union\n\n4) Can the new boys hit the ground running?\n\nOne factor in Union’s success this season is how quickly the new signings can transition into the group and start making an impact on the field. Centerback Ian Glavinovich and Midfielder Jovan Lukić are two names that look set to claim spots in the starting XI right off the bat, with rumored striker signing Bruno Damiani hoping to do the same upon his arrival and acclimation.\n\nIn positive news for Union, Ian Glavinovich has gotten to attend a majority of pre-season training with his new club and head coach, with Jovan Lukić joining the team in the later portion of pre-season. That’s on top of Danley Jean-Jacques, who made his Union debut in the middle of the 2024 season, getting his first full pre-season with Union and a new manager under his belt. Those 3 having a smooth pre-season will be a huge factor in how quickly Union starts the season.\n\nAug 28, 2024; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA; Columbus Crew midfielder Alexandru Matan (20) plays the ball defended by Philadelphia Union midfielder Danley Jean Jacques (21) in the first half at Subaru Park. Mandatory Credit: Eric Hartline-USA TODAY Sports\n\n5) What exactly are the expectations for this team in 2025?\n\n2025 will be the Union’s first season with a new manager in charge in almost a decade, and it comes after missing the playoffs for the first time since 2017. So the big question is, what are the expectations surrounding this team in 2025, and how short is Bradley Carnell’s leash?\n\nI don’t think silverware is realistically on the mind of many Union fans heading into 2025, but surely, getting back into a playoff spot will be one of the main goals for the Blue and Gold this season. With 62% of the league able to qualify for postseason play, it has to be. But what if they don’t?\n\nI think it would be harsh to move on from Carnell after one season unless things go horribly, horribly wrong. But at the same time, Carnell is hand-picked by Ernst Tanner for Ernst Tanner’s style of soccer. The players brought in during the last 2 windows are players that fit Ernst Tanner’s style of play. The team will undoubtedly, and maybe even to a fault at times, play the style of soccer that Ernst Tanner has spent time and money building the entire organization around over the last few years.\n\nIf things start to head in the right direction and eventually it all works out, Union fans will all be singing praises about Ernst Tanner and the vision he’s brought to the club, and they should. But if it doesn’t work out, and the Union fails to make the playoffs again, who falls on the sword this time?\n\nSep 28, 2024; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA; Philadelphia Union defender Nathan Harriel (26) celebrates with teammates after scoring a goal against Atlanta United in the second half at Subaru Park.

        "source": "https://metrophiladelphia.com/",
        "fullContent": "President Donald Trump listens to Robert F. Kennedy Jr. in the Oval Office of the White House, on the day Kennedy is sworn in as secretary of Health and Human Service in Washington, D.C., U.S., February 13, 2025.\n\nSign up for our Daily Email newsletter to stay up-to-date on the latest local news throughout Philadelphia.\n\nRobert F. Kennedy Jr. has been confirmed as the secretary of the US Health and Human Services Department. Put simply, this makes him the most influential figure in overseeing the health and wellbeing of more than 330 million Americans.\n\nAs health secretary, Kennedy will be involved in overseeing federal health agencies that regulate medical research, disease prevention, drug approvals and health-care programs.\n\nThis includes oversight of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the Food and Drug Administration and the National Institutes of Health, which are among the most crucial public health agencies in the country.\n\nReports suggest he’ll oversee a budget in the order of $1.8 trillion annually.\n\nIn the era of Trump 2.0, there’s little that shocks me anymore. But Kennedy would have to be the most unqualified person ever to hold this crucial role of protecting the health of the American people.\n\nA history of discounting science\n\nThe absolute minimum requirement for someone occupying such as role should be an understanding of science and respect for scientific evidence and expertise. Yet, Kennedy fails spectacularly in this regard.\n\nHere are just some of the false claims he has made over the years:\n\nKennedy has suggested Lyme disease is likely to be an engineered bioweapon\n\nHe reportedly said 99% of COVID deaths occurred in people with vitamin D deficiencies\n\nHe has questioned the role of HIV in causing AIDS.\n\nNone of these positions has even the smallest amount of scientific support.\n\nIt’s hard to predict what Kennedy will do as health secretary, especially given his confirmation hearings looked to be an exercise in being vague, evasive and denying or downplaying his prior controversial statements to secure support.\n\nBut there are three areas where his views are fairly clear and his appointment could be expected to have a significant impact. These are water fluoridation, infectious diseases research and vaccines.\n\nFluoridation of water\n\nKennedy has been a long-term opponent of water fluoridation, despite its proven benefits in preventing tooth decay. He has consistently questioned its safety and claimed it’s linked to a range of illnesses such as arthritis, bone cancer, IQ loss and neurodevelopmental disorders.\n\nWhile a recent review suggested a link between water fluoridation and lower IQ in children, the levels of fluoride in the water in countries included in this review were generally several times higher than the levels in public water fluoridation programs in countries such as the US and Australia. There were also other limitations that make interpreting these findings challenging.\n\nThe CDC has identified community water fluoridation as as one of the ten great public health achievements of the 20th century. And it continues to benefit dental health today, without any convincing evidence of possible harms.\n\nNonetheless, it seems likely that in keeping with his longstanding views one of Kennedy’s first priorities will be to try to halt water fluoridation in the US.\n\nInfectious diseases\n\nAlongside his confirmation as health secretary, US President Donald Trump signed an executive order establishing “The President’s Commission to Make America Healthy Again”, with Kennedy as the chair.\n\nThe Make America Healthy Again movement (MAHA) is an initiative driven by Kennedy focusing on improving nutrition, increasing transparency in medical practices and reducing the corporate influence in health.\n\nThough premised primarily on combating chronic diseases, the movement also embraces skepticism of established medical practices, unproven alternative therapies and a general mistrust of institutions.\n\nWhat’s more, Kennedy’s focus on chronic diseases seems to be coming at the expense of continued work on infectious diseases.\n\nHe has proposed directing the National Institutes of Health to pause infectious disease research for eight years to prioritize research into chronic diseases and alternative treatments.\n\nAs health secretary, Kennedy has the power to shift research priorities. If he were to effectively halt infectious diseases research – in the wake of COVID and with a looming threat of future pandemics – this would be catastrophic for the US and global health.\n\nVaccine scepticism\n\nRelated to infectious diseases, there’s little doubt the area in which Kennedy has done the most damage relates to vaccines.\n\nHe has dedicated a large part of his life to undermining public confidence in vaccines. This is despite overwhelming scientific evidence demonstrating their safety and effectiveness, and the millions of lives they’ve saved.\n\nAlthough he has subsequently denied it, Kennedy is on record as falsely stating there is no such thing as a safe and effective vaccine. Notably, he has continued to push the debunked claim that the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine is linked to autism, despite the single study finding this having been widely discredited.\n\nKennedy’s frequent assertion that he’s not anti-vaccine, but “pro-safety”, is also deeply disingenuous. Being “pro-safety” is a deliberately vague notion designed to appear reasonable while at the same time undermining the scientific evidence.\n\nThe impact of Kennedy’s appointment as health secretary on vaccine confidence will not just be limited to the US. Vaccine hesitancy has been recognized as one of the greatest threats to public health. Having a vaccine sceptic leading the US health agencies has the potential to harm vaccine uptake worldwide.\n\nAs we’ve seen during the COVID pandemic, producing a vaccine is only half the battle. Convincing people to take it is just as important. There’s no doubt Kennedy’s influence on public health messaging could further erode vaccine confidence at a time when vaccine messaging must be clear.\n\nBad news for the US and the world\n\nOne of the reasons Kennedy poses such a threat to public health in the US and globally is his lack of trust in science.

Mandatory Credit: Brad Penner-Imagn Images\n\nSign up for our email newsletter to stay up-to-date on the latest local sports news throughout Philadelphia.\n\nFour months ago, the Phillies limped to an unsatisfactory conclusion to the 2024 season. After winning 95 games and earning a bye in the National League playoffs, they were clipped in the NLDS against a red-hot New York Mets team. Losing to a rival in the postseason is tough enough—but to watch them sign the biggest free agent in recent memory after the season only adds to the pressure Philadelphia’s franchise is feeling.\n\nAfter a surprising run to the World Series in 2022, followed by big spending and big expectations, they have fallen one round earlier each season since losing to the Astros 3 years ago. As the top of the National League continues to grow stronger through big spending, Philadelphia already did their spending over the last few offseasons. With a core getting closer to their mid-30s and a few key players nearing free agency, the club’s championship window is getting smaller.\n\nPhiladelphia’s infield was seemingly set before the offseason even began. While there were rumblings of potential trades involving third baseman Alec Bohm, none of those rumors turned into truth, and the Phillies will rely on their homegrown third baseman to find some consistency in his last year of team control.\n\nPSN is breaking down each position group for you to get ready for Spring Training, and today we bring you our thoughts on Philadelphia’s infield. Starters, depth options, and what they need to do to reach the promised land.\n\nPhillies Starters\n\nBarring a significant injury or a last-minute, unexpected trade, Philly’s starting infield is locked up. Bryce Harper will enter his second season as a first baseman, Bryson Stott will once again man the keystone, Trea Turner will take his place back at shortstop, and Bohm will be the everyday third baseman.\n\nHarper is the de facto captain of the offense. The two-time MVP is the best hitter in Philadelphia’s lineup and one of the best of his generation. After a few injury-marred seasons, Harper played in 145 contests during the regular season—the most since his first season donning the red pinstripes. For the first time in a long time, Bryce will have nothing major to deal with coming into a season.\n\nHe’s healthy, he isn’t learning a new position like last year, and there’s no questioning those two things in the media—it is obvious he is ready for the season and has certainly found his place on defense. After a midsummer downswing, Harper finished 2024 strong, and that carried into the playoffs. Harper will be ready to show that he’s still one of the best hitters in all of baseball.\n\nBryson Stott is entrenched as the Phillies second baseman. In his age-26 season, Stott was a finalist for the National League Gold Glove after amassing 7 Defensive Runs Saved—good for fourth among NL second basemen. After taking a big step forward offensively in 2023, Stott got off to a slow start in 2024 and never really found the rhythm he had just the year prior. His average and slugging were both down in all scenarios, but most concerning was his success against left-handed pitching all but vanished. The fourth-year player was stuck between two approaches last season, so he will focus on finding consistency during Spring Training.\n\nAug 15, 2024; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA; Philadelphia Phillies shortstop Trea Turner (7) hits a single during the first inning against the Washington Nationals at Citizens Bank Park. Mandatory Credit: Bill Streicher-USA TODAY Sports\n\nTrea Turner was signed as a superstar shortstop, and he can find himself there once again, despite his struggles defensively. Not known as a Gold Glove-caliber fielder, the Phillies likely still expected more than what the 31-year-old has given them in the field. At the end of last season, Tim Kelly from On Pattison broke down some of the $300 million man’s struggles in the field. Since joining the Phillies, Turner has -26 defensive runs saved (DRS) and -8 outs above average at shortstop. Over that two-year period, Turner has rough defensive marks no matter how you look at it:\n\nHis -26 DRS is tied for the worst mark among defenders at any position (per FanGraphs)\n\nHe’s had -8 outs above average (OAA), which is 5th worst among SS\n\nHis .960 fielding percentage ranks him the 2nd worst SS\n\n3rd in throwing errors (18)\n\n2nd in fielding errors (22)\n\n2nd in total errors (40)\n\nThe coaching staff will work with Turner on improving his defense to the levels he reached prior to joining Philadelphia. While his position isn’t changing in the field, he may find himself moving in the batting order. Manager Rob Thomson recently confirmed during an appearance on The Phillies Show podcast that changes are being discussed. When asked about switching the lineup around and possibly finding a new lead-off hitter, Thomson came up with just one name:\n\n“I think you’re probably talking about Trea [Turner],” said Thomson.\n\nMy prediction is that Turner finds himself moving to the top of the order, while Kyle Schwarber moves down to bat cleanup. In order to keep the right-left-right-left pattern, this would put Harper in the No. 2 slot in the lineup. That would likely lead to Bohm batting 3rd.\n\nSpeaking of Bohm, the aforementioned trade rumors turned out to be just that—rumors. Rob Thomson has publicly said any time he’s been asked that he spoke with his third baseman and made clear that they were not actively shopping him, but that the Phillies owed it to themselves to hear out anyone who called about him.\n\nAlec Bohm talks to @TimKellySports about his positive mindset in Spring Training. pic.twitter.com/A18Y93MZ8z — On Pattison (@OnPattison) February 13, 2025\n\nBohm was an All-Star for the first time last season. The first half of his year was great, but he struggled in the second half while dealing with a hand injury. Despite that, he led the Phillies in doubles with 44—good for 5th in the majors—and had the 2nd most RBIs on the team. Tim Kelly had the opportunity to speak to Bohm now that players have begun reporting for Spring Training. He spoke about how the injury may have lingered more than he initially thought.\n\n“When I started hitting again in the offseason, I realized that it hurt worse than I thought it had hurt,” Bohm admitted. “But I was out there playing, so I feel like if I’m out there playing, it’s not like I can’t do anything. But at the same time, I’m sure a stronger left hand would have helped somewhere, maybe.\n\nEntering his last year under Phillies team control, he will need to have a season similar to his 2024 first half for the entire season if he wants a major payday in his first crack at free agency.\n\nSep 27, 2024; Washington, District of Columbia, USA; Philadelphia Phillies shortstop Edmundo Sosa (33) turns a double play during the seventh inning against the Washington Nationals at Nationals Park. Mandatory Credit: James A. Pittman-Imagn Images\n\nPhillies Reserves\n\nThere are 2 spots that an infielder could occupy on Philly’s bench. One will most definitely be occupied by Edmundo Sosa. The utility infielder came up big for the Phillies in 2024. In early May, he filled in admirably for Turner while he dealt with an injury. Sosa had a .972 OPS in May, one of the best numbers in all of baseball that month. He will be the primary option off the bench in the infield and when needing a pinch hitter.\n\nFrom there, you have to still account for the backup catcher and Johan Rojas being an extra outfielder off the bench. That leaves one additional bench spot. Weston Wilson, Kody Clemens, Buddy Kennedy, and newly signed Christian Arroyo will compete for that final spot. The front office has expressed wanting someone who can play both infield and outfield in that position, if possible. Wilson shows the most potential with slugging ability and speed. He does, however, have minor league options remaining, which is a disadvantage for him in the race for the final bench spot. Clemens has shown over the last few seasons that he is a major-league talent.\n\nHe has options left; he would almost certainly be claimed off waivers if the Phillies decided he was not the right guy to break camp with. Kennedy is a longer shot and is a nice depth piece, but he also has no options. He would likely pass through waivers, giving the Phillies a chance to keep him around. Arroyo is a former first-round draft pick, and while he was primarily an infielder, he does have some experience in the outfield corners at the major league level. He signed a minor league deal, so unless he significantly stands out, he will likely remain as a depth option and start the year in Triple-A Lehigh Valley.\n\nMy prediction is that Kody Clemens makes the roster out of spring. He has positional flexibility and allows extra depth to be kept in the organization without risk. Regardless of who the last man is, one thing is for sure—the infield is the strength of the offense. If Bohm can find consistency, Stott can hit closer to how he did in 2023, and the depth continues to do what they’ve done the last three seasons—they will be one of, if not the best, infields in baseball.\n\nMandatory Credit: Brad Penner-Imagn Images",

As a release notes, the evening will be a collaboration of Gullah Geechee cuisine infused with Ember & Ash’s live-fire cooking techniques, including ingredients grown at Gilliard Farms—the 50-acre homestead was purchased by Matthew’s great-great-great-grandfather and freed slave Jupiter Gilliard in 1874 for $9.\n\nWhile there, diners will be able to indulge in dishes like shrimp toast with saffron coconut rice and pickled okra; head hash terrine with fennel and citrus; smoked grouper with middlin risotto and hoja santa; sweet potato olive oil cake; and more. Seating times are 5, 6 and 7 p.m., and the dinner comes out to be $95 per person (plus tax and gratuity). Reservations are available now via Resy.\n\n“We’ve wanted to do a collaboration with longtime friends Scott and Lulu Calhoun of Ember & Ash for a while, as my ties to Philly run deep,” explained Tia in a statement. Both Scott and Tia worked with chef Marc Vetri at Lo Spiedo, and Tia was the culinary director for his nonprofit, Vetri Community Partnership from 2012 to 2014.\n\nThe Raifords, who were Culinary Institute of America grads, decided to switch gears to take their culinary skills to their historic farm in rural Georgia with a mission in mind: To “engage the world with African American foodways, revive the holistic practices of their ancestors, and help to feed their diverse community high-quality, locally-grown organic produce that are sustainably farmed.”\n\nAs a release notes, the couple believes in cultivating the land and pioneering a return to the regenerative practices of their forefathers — the Freshwater Gullah Geechee, who were direct descendants of West Africans brought to the U.S. as slaves for their expertise in rice and indigo cultivation.\n\nThis Black History Month celebration will continue with the Bookers event on the 26. Titled “A Great Migration Dinner,” Matthew will be using his skills as a historian and climate change activist to lead guests through a multi-course dinner and discussion recounting the history of the movement to the urban North by six million southern Blacks between 1910 and 1970. The James Beard semi-finalist and author of ‘Bress ‘n’ Nyam’ will also delve into how they brought their rich culinary traditions to a new life in the Northeast, Midwest, and West.\n\nHighlighted dishes span a pickled vegetable plate with Jamaican-style spinach patties, De Wata (salmon croquettes with red rice and herb salad),Win’ – Poulet Yassa (Senegalese style lemon pepper chicken with vegan teff stew), sweet potato pone with toasted walnut semifreddo and more. There will also be two De Spirits (complimentary cocktails) — a Gullah Geechie Gin Rickey or an alcohol-free hibiscus and lime spritzer.\n\n“Many African Americans’ roots can be traced to the Great Migration, including our own families,” said Cheri and Tracey Syphax from Booker’s restaurant in a statement. “We thought it would be a no-brainer to have Matthew join us for this special event, especially during Black History Month, given the fact that the namesake of our restaurant Booker Wright, is a famous waiter who worked in a whites-only restaurant in the 1960s Mississippi while also running his restaurant that catered to black customers.”\n\nThe dinner starts at 6 p.m. and costs $75 per person (plus tax and gratuity).\n\nTo find out more information on “From Georgia with Love”, visit emberandashphilly.com and bookersrestaurantandbar.com",

Sadly, when falling for friends it doesn’t always work in your favor, especially ‘after a night of Captain and Coke”.\n\nAs a group, Valendina has many influences that have impacted everything from their lyrics to their sound. Just as those influences are not tied down to a singular genre or voice, so is the case for Valendina, who has created their own unique sound. Regarding the inspiration for the sound of their latest single, one such source is a notable Philly-born band that, while no longer active, has continued to inspire musicians across the states.\n\n“For me, especially with the Philly music scene, I grew up following Modern Baseball around,” guitarist and vocalist Chase Sakers said.\n\n“Especially our earlier stuff, and definitely Ricky Bobby is very inspired by that kind of Philly basement rock. That’s kind of like my lifeblood, what I live and breathe. Everyone’s favorite aspects of that, just like grimy Philly punk. Ricky Bobby smells like stale PBR,” Chase and Karina joked.\n\nValendina will take the stage at Moonrose Vintage in Center City (1112 Pine St.) on Saturday, Feb. 22.

Otero awaits arraignment and extradition proceedings.\n\n\n\nAfter three months on the run, New York State Troopers have captured a man wanted for the murder of his ex-girlfriend in Philadelphia.\n\nThe ‘lifelong criminal,’ as described by U.S. Marshal Supervisory Deputy Robert Clark, now awaits extradition.\n\nThe backstory:\n\nOn November 8, 2024, the body of 29-year-old Melody Rivera was found buried in a shallow grave on the 900 block of Tustin Road in Philadelphia's Fox Chase neighborhood.\n\nAt the time, sources say they looked into the alleged boyfriend of the victim, identified as Geovanni Otero, 29, and found he had a criminal history involving a gun case.\n\nOtero was on parole for that case and had a GPS-tracking ankle monitor which sources say helped detectives narrow him down as a person of interest.\n\nBased on the GPS tracker and more developing evidence, sources say police believe Otero killed the woman and brought her a few miles away to the scene in Fox Chase and buried her body.\n\nOtero was at-large and federal agents joined the search to find him.\n\nU.S. Marshals added $5,000 to the Philadelphia Police Department's $20,000 reward for information leading to Otero's arrest.\n\nAt the time, Rivera’s family said she left behind an 11-year-old daughter and described her as ‘kind, funny and loving.’\n\nWhat we know:\n\nOn Saturday, February 15, 2025, New York State Troopers Charko and Pelaez attempted to stop a vehicle reported stolen from Virginia.\n\nThey say the driver initially complied before fleeing the scene a high rate of speed, prompting a brief pursuit lasting approximately one minute and covering one mile.\n\nOfficials say the pursuit ended when the suspect crashed the stolen vehicle.\n\nThen he fled on foot.. Troopers were able to apprehend the suspect a short distance from the crash site.\n\nAccording to NY State Police, the suspect provided false identification and was found in possession of multiple fraudulent forms of identification at the time of the arrest.\n\nHe was taken to Westchester Medical Center for treatment of minor injuries from the crash.\n\nAfter analyzing his fingerprints, the suspect was identified as Geovanni Otero, the man wanted by the Philadelphia Police Department and the United States Marshals Service for the death of Melody Rivera and other offenses.\n\nWhat's next:\n\nOtero is awaiting arraignment Monday for Criminal Possession of Stolen Property 4th degree, Obstructing Governmental Administration, False Impersonation, Unlawful Fleeing, and Reckless Driving.\n\nHe will remain in custody pending extradition proceedings.",

At least 17 of the 80 people aboard were injured, and airport operations are currently shut down. The cause of the crash is unknown, and emergency teams are on the scene.\n\n\n\nA Delta Air Lines plane was involved in a crash at Toronto Pearson International Airport in Canada on Monday around 3:30 p.m. Eastern Time.\n\nFootage shared by Canada's CTV television network showed the plane upside-down with first responders spraying water on the aircraft.\n\n\"Toronto Pearson is aware of an incident upon landing involving a Delta Airlines plane arriving from Minneapolis,\" the airport said in a tweet. \"Emergency teams are responding. All passengers and crew are accounted for.\"\n\nToronto plane crash\n\nWhat we know:\n\nThe airline said Delta Connection flight 4819 was involved in the crash.\n\nThe crash involved a Delta Air Lines CRJ-900. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) released a statement on Monday stating that the crash took place while the aircraft was landing.\n\nEighty people were on board at the time, and all were immediately evacuated. At least 17 people were injured, according to paramedics.\n\nIn a news conference, airport authorities said 22 of the passengers were Canadian with the remaining from different nationalities.\n\nThe FAA also said that the flight was operated by Endeavor Air.\n\n\"Initial reports were that there are no fatalities,\" the airline said in a statement to FOX Television Stations. \"Several customers with injuries were transported to area hospitals. Our primary focus is taking care of those impacted.\"\n\nTower controllers were heard speaking with the crew of a medical helicopter that had just left Pearson and was returning to help with the crash. The plane came to a rest at the intersection of Runways 23 and 15L, the controller said. That’s not far from the start of the runway.\n\n\"Just so you’re aware, there’s people outside walking around the aircraft there,\" a tower controller said.\n\n\"Yeah, we’ve got it. The aircraft is upside down and burning,\" the medical helicopter pilot responded.\n\nWhat we don't know:\n\nIt's not yet clear how badly hurt the passengers and crew might be.\n\nAnd while it is not yet known if weather played a role in the crash, the incident happened as extreme cold and wintry conditions unfolded across the northern tier of the U.S. and in Canada. Winds were gusting to about 40 mph at the time of the crash, FOX Weather reported.\n\nNo snow was falling at the time, but the gusty winds were blowing around the more than 8 inches of snow that fell at the airport over the weekend.\n\nA Delta Air Lines flight arriving from Minneapolis crashed and flipped over upon landing at Toronto Pearson International Airport in Canada on Monday, February 17 (Credit: Mark Fitzpatrick via Storyful)\n\nWhat they're saying:\n\n\"Delta is aware of reports of Endeavor Flight 4819 operating from Minneapolis/St. Paul to Toronto-Pearson International Airport as involved in an incident,\" Delta said in a statement. \"We are working to confirm any details and will share the most current information on news.delta.com as soon as it becomes available.\"\n\nDig deeper:\n\nMonday's incident is just the latest in a string of aviation incidents that has gripped the U.S. over the past several weeks.\n\nLast month, an American Airlines jet with 60 passengers and four crew members aboard collided with an Army helicopter while coming in for a landing at Ronald Reagan National Airport near Washington, D.C. There were no survivors.\n\nA few days later, a medical transport jet with a child patient, her mother and four others aboard crashed into a Philadelphia neighborhood shortly after takeoff, exploding in a fireball that engulfed several homes.\n\nLast week, two crew members ejected from a Navy jet before it crashed off the San Diego coast and were quickly rescued by a sportfishing boat.\n\nTwo people were killed when a single-engine plane crashed shortly after takeoff late over the weekend from a small airport east of Atlanta.\n\nThe backstory:\n\nEndeavor Air, based in Minneapolis, is a subsidiary of Delta Air Lines and the world’s largest operator of CRJ-900 aircraft. The airline operates 130 regional jets on 700 daily flights to over 126 cities in the U.S., Canada and the Caribbean, according to the company’s website.\n\nThe CRJ900, a popular regional jet, was developed by Canadian aerospace company Bombardier. It’s in the same family of aircraft as the CRJ700, the type of plane involved in the midair collision near Reagan National Airport on Jan. 29.",

His parents are speaking out in hopes of finding the owner of the dog and seek justice. The family says Philly police will investigate.\n\n\n\nA seven-year-old boy is recovering from more than 1o0 stitches after he was attacked by a dog.\n\nHis parents are still searching for the animal's owner, who they want to be held accountable.\n\nThey spoke to FOX 29's Steve Keeley.\n\nWhat we know:\n\nHendrix Brown is a tough Philly seven-year-old talking about the dog that bit his face and hands, where now a hundred stitches help heal those awful bite wounds.\n\nThe dog was running around unleashed near his home in the Rushwood Apartments in Northeast Philadelphia.\n\n\"He was just so scared. Screaming, screaming, screaming. He thought he was gonna die. He was screaming, 'I think I'm gonna die,'\" said Joslyn Gutierrez, Hendrix's mother.\n\nThis happened Thursday at around 5 p.m.\n\nThe child was outside with friends, neighborhood kids, and his brothers.\n\n\"The kid from the neighborhood ran in and said Hendrix was getting attacked by a dog, so I instantly ran out,\" Gutierrez said.\n\n\"The dog had first come up to the boys, sniffed them, then started to walk away, right? Then came back at you? And then just started to attack him,\" she added.\n\nA neighbor's surveillance camera captured the dog running around without a leash, with its owner following behind, and has not been seen or come forward since.\n\n\"I'm just shocked that there are human beings out there that would just leave a seven-year-old child there bleeding and not want to do what's right. I'm just disgusted, but I'm also very happy with the people who've shown support for Hendrix and had his back through everything, which is huge and makes us feel great,\" said Jordan Brown, Hendrix's father.\n\n\"I just saw blood everywhere, cuts all over his face. I see the owner, who I believe was hugging the dog on the ground, and that's all I personally remember. I was just really making sure he was okay. All the adults that were around were getting towels and making sure we were stopping the bleeding,\" said the mom.\n\n\"He has over 50 stitches in his face right now. He has bite marks next to the cheek, the lips, next to the ears right here. His lip was split open and some bite marks here. His left hand was completely exposed on the top, so you could see all the bite marks up and down the hand,\" Gutierrez explained.\n\nWhat's next:\n\nHendrix goes back for his next evaluation Tuesday to see how badly damaged his hands are and hopefully, how well they're healing.\n\nFOX 29 left a phone message with the apartment complex office where Philadelphia police plan to visit Tuesday to investigate.\n\nThe parents want the owners and dog found to prevent another attack.\n\n\"We do not want to see this happen to another child. That would be devastating, so who knows, next time they might not make it through. So definitely don't want to see this happen again,\" said the dad.",

        "source": "https://www.fox29.com/",
        "fullContent": "The Brief A Gallup poll found that 45% of Democrats want their party to be more moderate, an 11-point increase since 2021. Meanwhile, 43% of Republicans prefer their party's current ideology, with fewer calling for a more conservative shift. The results come after Donald Trump’s inauguration for his second term as president and Republican control of Congress.\n\n\n\nAfter losing the presidency and Senate in the 2024 election, an increasing number of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents say they want their party to become more moderate rather than maintain its current liberal stance.\n\nA Gallup poll, published last month, found that 45% of Democrats now favor a moderate shift, up from 34% in 2021. Meanwhile, 29% of Democrats still want their party to move in a more liberal direction, a five-point drop from 2021.\n\nAt the same time, Republicans are largely satisfied with their party's ideology under Trump, with 43% of GOP voters saying the party should stay the same. Only 28% want the party to become more conservative, a significant drop from 40% in 2021.\n\nWhat’s behind the shift?\n\nThe backstory:\n\nOne factor that may be influencing Democrats' preference for moderation is the party’s recent electoral losses. Following the 2024 election, Republicans took control of both the presidency and Senate, while maintaining a slim majority in the House of Representatives.\n\nFILE - Democratic leaders, including Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer, gather for a press conference at the U.S. Capitol. (Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)\n\nIn contrast, Republican satisfaction with their party's ideology may be a reflection of their support for Trump and the conservative policies his administration has begun enacting.\n\nHow views differ within each party\n\nBy the numbers:\n\nGallup's findings also reveal ideological divisions within both parties:\n\nLiberal Democrats (49% of Democrats overall) mostly want the party to be more liberal (45%) or remain the same (22%).\n\nModerate Democrats (43% of Democrats) overwhelmingly prefer a shift to the center (62%).\n\nConservative Republicans (two-thirds of GOP voters) are split: 45% favor the status quo, while 38% want a more conservative GOP.\n\nModerate Republicans are more likely to favor a centrist shift (50%), rather than staying the same (36%).\n\nThese divisions suggest that while moderate Democrats increasingly want their party to move to the center, moderate Republicans are somewhat less eager for change.\n\nWhat this means for the future\n\nThe Democratic Party's shift toward moderation could influence its strategy heading into the 2026 midterms. The party may seek to regain voter support by focusing on more centrist policies and appealing to swing voters.\n\nMeanwhile, the Republican Party appears to be more united in its current direction, with Trump maintaining strong support among GOP voters.\n\nAs both parties look ahead to future elections, their ideological shifts could play a key role in shaping the political landscape for years to come.",

The girl's mother, grandfather, and another man were found shot and killed in two homes in Tamarac, Florida, deputies said.\n\n\n\nFlorida authorities are investigating the deaths of three people in Broward County, which prompted a statewide AMBER Alert for a 4-year-old girl on Sunday morning. The 4-year-old girl was found safe and unharmed hours later, officials said.\n\nOfficials said the girl's grandfather and mother were found dead, as well as another man between two homes in Tamarac, Florida. The girl's father, Nathan Gingle, has been arrested and booked into jail under suspicion of murder, violation of a domestic violence injunction, and interference with custody.\n\nHe is being held on no bond, according to jail records.\n\nDeputies: From shooting call to AMBER Alert to triple homicide investigation\n\nTimeline:\n\nAround 6 a.m. on Sunday, 911 calls reported a shooting on North Grand Duke Circle in Tamarac, Florida, which is northwest of Fort Lauderdale, the Broward County Sheriff's Office said.\n\nDeputies responded and found David Pozner, the young girl's grandfather, dead on the back patio of the home, a news release said. He had been shot.\n\nDuring that investigation, deputies learned that the girl had been taken from the home, likely by her dad, Nathan, which prompted an Amber Alert to be issued after 10 a.m. Less than an hour later, the Broward Sheriff's Office found Nathan and the girl in a Walmart parking lot in North Lauderdale.\n\nDeputies were also looking for Mary Gingles, the girl's mother. She was found dead inside another home on North Plum Bay Parkway. She had also been shot, officials said. In that same home, a man named Andrew Ferrin, was also found dead. The relationship between Ferrin and the others is not immediately clear.\n\nThe sheriff's office said a gun was found in a nearby canal and is believed to be the weapon used in the alleged crimes.\n\nSTAY CONNECTED WITH FOX 35 ORLANDO:",

A male resident in the Bensalem house was in an online relationship with the suspect's ex-girlfriend, according to officials.\n\n\n\nA Pennsylvania family awoke to a house of horror when officials say a stranger traveled from states away to commit a chilling crime of arson.\n\nWhat we know:\n\nCrews arrived to find six people outside a house engulfed in flames on the 5200 block of Merganser Way last week.\n\nOfficials say they were able to escape thanks to the mom, who heard suspicious noises, before finding the fire and evacuating her family.\n\nAll six family members survived, and were treated for smoke inhalation. However, both of the family's dogs perished in the fire.\n\nVideo captured a vehicle pulling up to the house as a suspect got out, walked towards the rear, then drove off.\n\nAbout 30 seconds later, an explosion erupted, and the house went up in flames.\n\nDig deeper:\n\nThe cause of the fire was determined to be arson, sparking an investigation that led police to a house in Rockford, Michigan, less than two days later.\n\nAn arrest warrant was obtained for 21-year-old Harrison Jones, who was taken into custody with apparent burns on his arm.\n\nOfficials say Jones is the ex-boyfriend of a woman from Michigan who had been in an online relationship with a male resident in the Bensalem house since 2023. However, they say a motive is still being investigated.\n\nCourt documents say Jones was supposed to drive his ex-girlfriend to meet the man. Instead, investigators say he drove to Bensalem on his own with \"murderous intentions.\"\n\n\"He drove over 730 miles, 11 hours, to do what he did and then drove directly back home,\" said William McVey, Director of Public Safety for the Bensalem Township Police Department.\n\nWhat's next:\n\nJones is charged with six counts of attempted homicide, arson and related offenses. He is currently awaiting extradition back to Pennsylvania.\n\nA GoFundMe for the family says it was their two dogs, Trey and Jett, that alerted the mom, who is also battling cancer, that something was wrong. Investigators say both dogs died in the fire.\n\nA family member also started a fundraiser with the Philadelphia Animal Welfare Society to honor their memory. A PAWS spokesperson tells FOX 29 they plan to create a plaque to dedicate one of their kennels to Trey and Jett for their heroism.\n\nWhat they're saying:\n\n\"This is a family’s worst nightmare to be asleep in their home, not knowing that a stranger broke into their home, and attempted to take their lives by setting their home on fire,\" said Bucks County District Attorney Jennifer Schorn. \"This family suffered such inconceivable loss. This defendant’s actions are incomprehensible, and he will be held accountable.\"\n\nThe Zalenski Family sent the following statement to FOX 29:\n\n\"From the entire Zalenski Family, we want to express our deepest gratitude to the incredible first responders, law enforcement officials, and emergency personnel who came to our aid last Monday. It is by the grace of God and the help of all those individuals that we made it out of our home safely and survived. While we lost everything, including our beloved pets Trey and Jett, we're forever grateful for the swift and courageous response from the Bensalem Police Department, Firefighters, EMS, medical professionals, and of course the Bucks County Detectives, all who cared for us in the aftermath and since this tragedy. Their dedication and bravery helped save our lives, and we will never forget what they did for our family.\n\nWe are overwhelmed at the outpouring of love and support from our family, community, friends, and even strangers. This has been one of the darkest and most difficult times in our lives, however, the kindness and love we've received from so many around us has given us so much hope and inspiration. The messages, donations, and pure kindness have lifted us up when we've needed it most. We are also thankful for the generous support we've received through the GoFundMe campaign launched by our family which will help us begin rebuilding our lives. For those who wish to contribute, you can find the fundraiser at this link: https://www.gofundme.com/f/aid-the-zalenski-family-in-overcoming-horrible-tragedy .\n\nTrey and Jett were our two-family dogs, who will forever be missed. They both acted quickly and fearlessly by notifying Stacy that danger was present and alerting us of the fire, ultimately saving our lives. It's because of them that we were all able to mobilize and get out of our house. Here is a link to a fundraiser for them:\n\nTrey and Jett's fundraising page for Philadelphia Animal Welfare Society (PAWS)\n\nAs we continue to heal and piece our lives back together, we remain eager to learn more about the motive and intent behind this tragic event. We trust in the ongoing efforts of the Bucks County authorities and are confident that the investigation will provide the answers we seek. Our family is so grateful to have what feels like the entire community standing behind us. As we begin rebuilding our lives, we kindly ask for space, time, and your patience.\n\nThank you so much for standing with us and for having our back.\"",

        "fullContent": "article\n\nThe Brief Reddit is set to roll out some new features this year, which could include paid subreddits. CEO Steve Huffman said paid subreddits are \"coming\" and currently \"in the works.\" Reddit has had trouble generating profit and went public last March.\n\n\n\nA new feature is expected to roll out on Reddit later this year that could put some content behind a paywall.\n\nReddit’s co-founder and CEO Steve Huffman spoke more on the idea of paid subreddits in a recent company Ask Me Anything (AMA).\n\nHere’s what to know:\n\nWhat is Reddit?\n\nThe backstory:\n\nReddit is a technology and social network company that was founded more than 20 years ago. It is a sought-after space for internet discussions of any topic within communities, also known as subreddits.\n\nReddit has more than 100 million daily active users, Huffman said last week , who visit the site to discuss a range of topics from silly memes to existential worries, as well as to get recommendations from like-minded people.\n\nDespite its popularity, Reddit has had trouble turning profit since it was founded in 2005. It’s been looking for ways to boost revenue, and went public in March of last year.\n\nBy the numbers:\n\nBy tech industry’s standards though, Reddit remains small for a company that has been around since 2005.\n\nLast year, Reddit’s annual revenue generation was just below $1 billion. For comparison, Meta boasts an annual revenue of $135 billion.\n\nMeta had a market value of more than $1.2 trillion in 2024. Reddit’s market value was priced at $6.4 billion when it went public last March.\n\nRELATED: TikTok returns to Apple, Google app stores after temporary removal\n\nPaid subreddits\n\nWhat we know:\n\nHuffman has talked about the idea of paid subreddits before, and mentioned that when asked about it again in a recent AMA alongside Chief Operating Officer Jen Wong and Chief Financial Officer Drew Volleror.\n\n\"That one’s coming. We’re working on it as we speak,\" Hoffman said.\n\nA paid subreddit would put a paywall, of sorts, around designated content, meaning that only members who pay could access that subreddit, or \"community,\" and see its content.\n\nWhat we don't know:\n\nHoffman didn’t elaborate on the timeline users can expect for the paid subreddits.\n\nHe also didn’t indicate how much users could expect to pay for some content, or if the amount would be fixed by Reddit or perhaps set by the creator.\n\nRELATED: Facebook fact-checking to be replaced with X-style community notes\n\nWhat's next:\n\nHoffman spoke on some other new key features that Reddit users can expect for 2025:\n\nPaid subreddits\n\nImproved search results\n\nReddit Answers, which uses AI to summarize search results from Reddit’s user base\n\nLaying the foundation for an eventual marketplace",

Fans have the option of securing a $500 deposit and will be able to purchase their package before the general public.\n\nThe second option is to join a waitlist and an NBA Experiences representative will notify fans once packages go on sale.\n\nThe NBA Experience Package includes:\n\nA Ticket for Saturday night’s events\n\nA game ticket to the 75th NBA All-Star Game\n\nNBA Exp Lounge\n\nNBA Legend Meet & Greets\n\nTickets for individual events are expected to be released at a later date.\n\nClick here for more information.\n\nWhat they're saying:\n\n\"Clipper Nation, we ready.

I’m excited for the world to get an opportunity to see how beautiful that establishment is,\" said 11-time NBA All-Star, James Harden, in a press release. \"We’re a year out—we’re ready now—but we’ve got a year to prepare, and make sure it’s flawless for everybody to see.\"\n\n\"We want this to be the penultimate basketball experience,\" Clippers owner Steve Ballmer said when the event was announced last year.\n\nPREVIOUS COVERAGE: Los Angeles to host 2026 NBA All-Star weekend at Clippers' new arena in Inglewood\n\nWhy you should care:\n\nNBA All-Star Weekend 2026 is just one of the many sporting events that will allow Los Angeles to showcase itself as a host city ahead of the 2028 Olympics.\n\nSUGGESTED COVERAGE:\n\nThe mid-season showcase reaches fans in more than 200 countries and territories in more than 50 languages.\n\nThe other side:\n\nThe NBA All-Star Game has been heavily criticized in recent years as it fights for relevancy.\n\nWith a new format and Kevin Hart taking on a hosting role, the 2025 event in San Francisco was no exception.\n\n\"By the end of the night, the basketball was an afterthought, with an uncompetitive championship final secondary in the minds of viewers to everything that was going wrong on their TVs,\" wrote Jason Owens with Yahoo! Sports.\n\n\"I think maybe we should focus on some other things than All-Star,\" Denver Nuggets center Nikola Jokic said, as reported by ESPN. \"I think it's always going to be like this so we should accept it.\"\n\nDig deeper:\n\nNext season marks the seventh time NBA All-Star Weekend will be hosted in Los Angeles. It was last held in the LA area in 2018, and the City of Angels has also hosted the event in 2011, 2004, 1983, 1972 and 1963.\n\nIt’s also worth noting every All-Star MVP during the LA games was named to the NBA 75th Anniversary Team. Those elite players were:\n\nLeBron James (2018)\n\nKobe Bryant (2011)\n\nShaquille O’Neal (2004)\n\nJulius Erving (1983)\n\nJerry West (1972)\n\nBill Russell (1963)\n\nBy the numbers:\n\nNBA All-Star Weekend is expected to have a massive impact on LA's economy. While numbers from last weekend aren't available, the 2024 event in Indianapolis generated over $403 million, the NBA confirmed.",

The owner, Shakeira Turner, is speaking out about being bullied by unhappy neighbors.\n\n\n\nTrouble has arisen for a newly opened Center City restaurant, with the business owner claiming she is being bullied by neighbors who simply aren't happy her business is there.\n\nFOX 29's Alex George spoke with the owner about what has been happening.\n\nWhat we know:\n\nChubby Chicks restaurant on Walnut Street just opened up two months ago, and in that time, they say they have found dead rodents left at their door, received complaints to their landlord, and heard comments that the business doesn’t belong in the \"prestigious\" neighborhood.\n\nWhat they're saying:\n\n\"My life savings, my home, all of that is wrapped up into this business, so it's not just, 'Oh, if I have to go,' no, it would be devastating,\" said Shakeira Turner, the owner.\n\nChubby Chicks just opened at 1111 Walnut Street two months ago. It's a place where people come to eat brunch and celebrate.\n\n\"We do karaoke on the weekends on Saturdays and Sundays. It is so much fun. It is inclusive. You come here and be yourself, and that is what everything is about here,\" Turner said.\n\nBut since opening, Turner says things haven’t been great.\n\n\"We are basically not too welcomed here. I thought that we would be, and I thought maybe this would be a good addition to the street,\" she said.\n\nShe says the neighbors have made several complaints to the landlord, requiring her lawyer to get involved.\n\n\"They are saying that we are playing unusual music and that we are playing riffraff coming out of here, and that is just not true,\" Turner explained. \"We are open from 8 a.m. to 3 p.m. during the week, and they were saying that we are playing music until 2 a.m. We are not even here. Even going as far as saying that one of us was on the roof of their building at 2 a.m., just putting in false claims to my landlord, which really stirred up some issues.\"\n\nShe says she has even had one-on-one confrontations.\n\n\"I even had someone tell me to my face, 'How did I get here? Did I use my drug dealer baby daddy money?' So it's hurtful.

        "fullContent": "The Brief Donald Trump attended the Daytona 500 for the second time as president, continuing his tradition of engaging with sports audiences. His presence highlights NASCAR's conservative-leaning fan base and his broader effort to align with American sports culture. Drivers, including Chase Elliott, acknowledge the significance of a president attending the event: \"It certainly brings a lot of eyes.\"\n\n\n\nPresident Donald Trump attended the Daytona 500 on Sunday, marking his second appearance at NASCAR’s most prestigious race as president.\n\nSpirit of NASCAR will 'fuel America's Golden Age'\n\nWhat we know:\n\nPresident Trump is back in Daytona Beach for The Great American Race. It's the second appearance at the race as president. His first visit was in 2020 while running for reelection. That year, he served as grand marshal, delivering the command for drivers to start their engines and making a dramatic entrance with an Air Force One flyover.\n\nFor this trip, Air Force One departed from Palm Beach International Airport shortly after noon, carrying Trump, his son Eric, grandson Luke, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy, Interior Secretary Doug Burgum and his wife, Kathryn. Several members of Congress were also accompanying him, according to the White House.\n\nTrump also thrilled NASCAR fans in the stands with another Air Force One flyover before he rode in the presidential limousine onto the Daytona International Speedway.\n\nTrump has made a point of attending major sporting events, having recently become the first sitting president to attend a Super Bowl. His presence at college football games and UFC fights, along with his well-documented passion for golf, further underscores his efforts to align himself with sports culture.\n\nWhat we don't know:\n\nIt remained unclear whether Trump had any official role at the Daytona 500 this year, as he did in 2020 when he was grand marshal. The extent of his involvement in pre-race ceremonies or interactions with drivers has not been disclosed.\n\nThe backstory:\n\nTrump’s relationship with NASCAR extends beyond his appearances at the Daytona 500. In 2018, while in the White House, he honored NASCAR Cup Series champion Martin Truex Jr. and Furniture Row Racing. More recently, in May of last year, he attended the Coca-Cola 600 at Charlotte Motor Speedway, a major race in the swing state of North Carolina, as a former president and reelection candidate.\n\nTrump has often spoken about his admiration for the sport and its fans, praising the courage of drivers and the patriotic spirit of NASCAR events. His presence at Daytona aligns with his broader strategy of cultivating support among sports audiences.\n\nBig picture view:\n\nTrump’s appearance at the Daytona 500 reinforces his ongoing effort to maintain visibility among sports fans, particularly those in key political battlegrounds. With NASCAR’s fan base traditionally seen as conservative-leaning, his presence at the event could bolster his appeal among a segment of voters who value his brand of patriotism and showmanship.\n\nHis attendance follows a recent pattern of high-profile sports event visits, including last weekend’s Super Bowl. These appearances, coupled with his history of engaging with NASCAR and other sports leagues, reflect a continued strategy of associating himself with American sports culture.\n\nImage 1 of 9 ▼ DAYTONA BEACH, FLORIDA - FEBRUARY 16: Air Force One is seen for U.S. President Donald Trump's visit to the NASCAR Cup Series Daytona 500 at Daytona International Speedway on February 16, 2025 in Daytona Beach, Florida. (Photo by Mike Ehrmann/Getty Images)\n\nWhat they're saying:\n\nDuring a 2020 interview with Fox News, Trump spoke about his admiration for NASCAR and the Daytona 500, calling it a \"legendary display of roaring engines, soaring spirits and the American skill, speed and power that we’ve been hearing about for so many years.\"\n\n\"The tens of thousands of patriots here today have come for the fast cars and the world-class motorsports,\" Trump said at the time. \"But NASCAR fans never forget that no matter who wins the race, what matters most is God, family and country.\"\n\nChase Elliott, a NASCAR driver, acknowledged the significance of having a sitting president attend the Daytona 500. \"One of our biggest days of the year is special,\" he said. \"It certainly brings a lot of eyes and a different perspective to what we do down here for this race.\"\n\nDaytona 500: What to know:\n\nThe Daytona 500 race is held on Sunday, Feb. 16, at Daytona International Speedway in Daytona Beach, Florida. The race started at 1:30 p.m. (It was moved up an hour due to the potential for weather on Sunday afternoon).\n\nHow can I watch the Daytona 500?\n\nThe Daytona 500 airs on FOX and FOX 35 Orlando. The race started at 1:30 p.m. (It was moved up an hour due to the potential for weather on Sunday afternoon).\n\nWatch on TV or stream on FOX Local. FOX will then jump in with pre-race coverage of its own on TV.\n\nHow long is the race?\n\nThe Daytona 500 is a 500-mile race. Daytona International Speedway is a 2.5-mile track, which means it takes 200 laps to hit the 500-mile milestone.\n\nDaytona 500 Forecast: Is it going to rain?\n\nIt will be a warm and windy day in Central Florida, especially up the Interstate 4 corridor. Wind gusts are expected to be between 35-40 mph. Temperatures will be in the 80s.\n\nA cold front is expected to move through Daytona Beach in the afternoon and early evening hours, which would be during the Daytona 500 race.

The National Police Agency has said that officers are not suspecting foul play and that Kim left no note.\n\nOnce among the brightest stars on South Korea’s vibrant movie and television scene, Kim struggled to find work after a 2022 drunk driving incident, for which she was later fined in court.\n\nOnline posts in South Korea are notoriously harsh toward celebrities who make missteps, especially women, and Kim faced constant negative coverage from news organizations that capitalized on public sentiment.\n\nGet top local stories in Philly delivered to you every morning.

Some invoked the 2019 deaths of K-Pop singers Seol-li and Goo Hara and the 2023 death of “Squid Games” actor Lee Sun-kyun while calling for a change in the “harsh, zero-tolerance” culture toward celebrities.\n\nThe Hankook Ilbo newspaper said the country's media outlets were part of the problem, lamenting that some outlets continued to exploit Kim for clicks even after her death, using provocative headlines that highlighted her past struggles.\n\nThe watchdog Citizens’ Coalition for Democratic Media on Tuesday criticized news organizations for blaming social media without considering their own “sensational and provocative reporting.\"\n\nBorn in 2000, Kim began her acting career at age 9, with the 2009 film “A Brand New Life,” portraying a girl’s struggles to adjust to a new life after being left at an orphanage by her father.

        "fullContent": "A Michigan man drove over 730 miles and set fire to the Pennsylvania home of a man that his ex-girlfriend had communicated with online, leaving six people inside the house hospitalized and two dogs dead, investigators said.\n\nOn Feb. 10, at 5:22 a.m., police and volunteer firefighters responded to the 5200 block of Merganser Way in Bensalem, Pennsylvania, for a reported house fire. When they arrived, they found six people outside the house. All six were taken to the hospital and treated for smoke inhalation. They were later released. Two dogs who were inside the home also died during the fire.\n\nThe homeowner told NBC10 she was sleeping earlier that morning when she heard strange noises. The woman went to investigate and saw a man who she believed was her son inside the home. She then went back to her room but the strange noises continued.\n\nAt 5:17 a.m., the woman walked downstairs and found her kitchen and living room on fire. She then alerted the five other residents inside the home and they all evacuated. One of the residents jumped from the second-floor window of the house to escape.\n\nGet top local stories in Philly delivered to you every morning. Sign up for NBC Philadelphia's News Headlines newsletter.\n\n“It’s a miracle they all survived,” Bensalem Public Safety Director William McVey said during a Monday morning press conference. “And we credit the mother of that house for taking the actions she did to protect her family and ensure that they all lived.”\n\nInvestigators determined the cause of the fire was arson. They obtained surveillance video showing a Volkswagen Passat pulling up to the home around 5 a.m. that morning. A man then exits the vehicle and goes to the back of the home, staying in the area for about four minutes before returning to the car. The man then grabs something from the car and goes back to the rear of the house where he stays for about 12 minutes.\n\nThen, at 5:18 a.m., the man is seen running from the back of the home and fleeing in the Volkswagen. About 30 seconds later, smoke and an explosion are seen from the home.\n\nInvestigators determined the Volkswagen exited I-95 at Street Road around 1:24 a.m. that morning and drove directly to the home on Merganser Way. The vehicle then remained there for a few hours before the home was set on fire. Investigators said the Volkswagen then got back on I-95 South at 5:24 a.m. that morning.\n\nInvestigators traced the license plate of the Volkswagen to a home in Kent County, Michigan. Bensalem Police and the Kent County Sheriff’s Department later identified the driver as 21-year-old Harrison Jones, the son of the vehicle’s owner and a resident of Rockford, Michigan. Police said Jones was the ex-boyfriend of a 21-year-old Michigan woman who had been communicating online with a 22-year-old man who lived at the Merganser Way home that had been set on fire.\n\nInvestigators said Jones' ex-girlfriend had never met the 22-year-old man in person but was planning on meeting him in Pennsylvania.\n\nOn Feb. 12, 2025, members of the Kent County Sheriff’s Department executed a search warrant at the Michigan home where they recovered Lidocaine burn cream, gauze wrappings, a locking pick and the Volkswagen Passat that had been spotted on surveillance video, investigators said.\n\nPolice interviewed Jones who denied being in Pennsylvania at the time of the fire, according to officials. Police said they obtained surveillance video showing Jones was at a Wawa about an hour away from Bensalem the morning of the fire, however. Jones' father also told police a phone app tracked his son to Pennsylvania around the time the fire started, according to court documents.\n\nJones was then arrested and charged with attempted homicide, arson and other related offenses.\n\nIf you or someone you know is experiencing domestic violence, contact the National Domestic Violence Hotline by calling 1-800-799-SAFE (7233), visiting www.thehotline.org or texting LOVEIS to 22522.\n\n“It is clear to us that Mr. Jones had murderous intentions that evening,” McVey said. “He drove over 730 miles, 11 hours, to do what he did and then drove directly back home.”\n\nThe Bucks County District Attorney’s Office approved the charges against Jones. He is currently in custody in Michigan and will be extradited to Pennsylvania where he’ll be arraigned.\n\n\"This defendant faces 13 felony counts and nine misdemeanor counts where the total penalty exceeds more than his lifespan,\" Bucks County District Attorney Jennifer Schorn said.\n\nA GoFundMe was created in support of the family. The Philadelphia Animal Welfare Society also created a fundraiser in honor of the two dogs that were killed in the fire.",

State Department Spokesperson Tammy Bruce told reporters on Monday that the Riyadh meeting was designed to \"determine if the Russians perhaps are serious, and if they're on the same page.\"\n\nKremlin Spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Monday that the meeting was to discuss restoring bilateral relations and \"preparations for potential Ukraine peace talks\" as well as a forthcoming meeting between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin, according to comments translated by NBC News.\n\nAnadolu | Anadolu | Getty Images\n\nKirill Dmitriev, the head of Russia's sovereign wealth fund, is also a part of the Russian delegation in Riyadh with his presence signalling that Moscow is keen to emphasize the economic benefits of restoring ties.\n\nSpeaking to Russian media outlets Tuesday, Dmitriev estimates that \"U.S. businesses lost around $300 billion from leaving Russia. So there is huge economic toll on many countries from you know what's happening right now, and we believe as a way forward is through solutions,\" he said, according to a news agency Interfax report.\n\nUkraine and Europe frozen out\n\nOfficials from Ukraine will not be present at the talks in Riyadh, Kyiv said, and European allies also remain frozen out of the discussions for now.\n\nKyiv's leadership has warned that it will not agree to any peace deal that goes against its interests, while European leaders warned at the Munich Security Conference last weekend that any agreement made without its involvement would not work.\n\nEuropean leaders held an emergency meeting in Paris on Monday where they agreed on the need to sharply increase defense spending but could not agree on whether to send peacekeeping troops to Ukraine as part of a post-war plan.\n\nThe U.K. has said it is willing to send peacekeeping troops to Ukraine but said the U.S. would need to provide a \"backstop\" to support the deployment, while Denmark and France signaled a willingness to consider sending troops to the country.\n\nTom Nicholson | Getty Images\n\nOther nations, including some of Ukraine's biggest backers, Poland and Germany, are wary, however. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz was openly critical of the idea, calling it \"completely premature\" and \"highly inappropriate\" while the leaders of Italy, Spain and Norway appeared to be more cynical about the idea.\n\nAnxious to remain close to President Trump, U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer is due to meet the president next week, while French President Emmanuel Macron said he'd spoken to Trump and Zelenskyy after the emergency summit.\n\n\"We seek a strong and lasting peace in Ukraine. To achieve this, Russia must end its aggression, and this must be accompanied by strong and credible security guarantees for the Ukrainians. Otherwise, there is a risk that this ceasefire will end up like the Minsk agreements. We will work on this together with all Europeans, Americans, and Ukrainians. This is the key,\" Macron said on social media platform X.",

On its maiden voyage in 1952, it shattered the transatlantic speed record in both directions, when it reached an average speed of 36 knots, or just over 41 mph (66 kph), The Associated Press reported from aboard the ship.\n\nOn that voyage, the ship crossed the Atlantic in three days, 10 hours and 40 minutes, besting the RMS Queen Mary’s time by 10 hours.\n\nTo this day, the SS United States holds the transatlantic speed record for an ocean liner.\n\n\n\nIt became a reserve ship in 1969 and later bounced to various private owners who hoped to redevelop it but eventually found their plans to be too expensive or poorly timed.\n\nIt has loomed for years on South Philadelphia’s Delaware waterfront. During that time, there was an ongoing rent dispute between the ship’s conservancy and its landlord, Penn Warehousing. The dispute stemmed from an August 2021 decision by Penn Warehousing to double the ship’s daily dockage to $1,700, an increase the conservancy refused to accept. When the conservancy continued to pay its previous rate, set in 2011, Penn Warehousing terminated the lease in March 2022.\n\nThe ship was then purchased by Okaloosa County, Florida, for $10 million in October 2024.\n\nOnce the ship is actually moved, it will travel via multiple tugboats to Mobile, Alabama, where it will begin a year-long transformation into an artificial reef, with workers removing any non-metal parts and fuel that could be hazardous to sea life.\n\nThe exact location in the Gulf of Mexico for the ship’s deployment has not yet been determined but it’s expected to be about 20 miles south of the Florida Panhandle region in the Destin-Forth Walton Beach area.\n\n\n\nFor more information about the history of the SS United States, visit www.ssusc.org.",

Futures contracts are for players who were not on a 53-man roster at the conclusion of the regular season. These contracts will count toward the 90-man roster when the new league year begins in March.\n\nOf these 13 players, 12 were on the Eagles practice squad in the lead up to the Super Bowl. The only one that wasn’t (WR Elijah Cooks) was on the practice squad for a week in January.\n\nLet’s take a closer look:\n\nGet top local stories in Philly delivered to you every morning. Sign up for NBC Philadelphia's News Headlines newsletter.\n\nDB Tariq Castro-Fields: Castro-Fields (6-1, 197) spent a lot of the 2024 season on the Eagles’ practice squad. He was a 6th-round pick out of Penn State in 2022, taken by the 49ers. Castro-Fields actually played in 10 games with 1 start for the Commanders in 2022 and 2023 and in 2024 played in 2 games with the Carolina Panthers. In his NFL career, Castro-Fields has played 27 snaps on defense and 109 on special teams. He has not appeared in a game for the Eagles.\n\nWR Elijah Cooks: Cooks (6-4, 215) went undrafted out of San Jose State in 2023. He was with the Jaguars and played in 11 games over two seasons. He had 3 catches for 38 yards in those games. Cooks began his college career at Nevada but in his one year at San Jose State had 69 catches for 1,076 yards and 10 touchdowns. Cooks was with the Eagles’ practice squad for a week in January.\n\nRB Tyrion Davis-Price: After being taken in the 3rd round of the 2022 draft out of LSU, Davis-Price played in just 7 games in 2022 and 2023 with the 49ers before getting cut. He spent this past season on the Eagles’ practice squad and played in one game. He had 3 carries for 7 yards on Dec. 29 against the Cowboys. In the preseason, Davis-Price had 22 carries for 118 yards.\n\nLB Dallas Gant: Gant (6-2, 224) went undrafted out of Toledo in 2024 after previously playing at Ohio State. He was with the Vikings in training camp and spent the first couple months on their practice squad before getting released and joining the Eagles’ practice squad. Gant was elevated for two games — the final two of the regular season. He played 26 snaps on special teams.\n\nWR Danny Gray: Another former 49ers pick, Gray was selected in the 3rd round out of SMU in 2022. Gray (6-0, 200) played in 13 games as a rookie and had 1 catch for 10 yards. Gray had a productive couple seasons at SMU as a receiver and return man. Gray has track speed; he ran a 4.33 at the combine.\n\nDT Gabe Hall: The Eagles signed Hall (6-6, 295) as an undrafted free agent out of Baylor this season. He spent the entire year on the Eagles’ practice squad. Hall made some plays in training camp as a rookie and is worth taking a look at in Year 2.\n\nDE K.J. Henry: The Commanders drafted Henry (6-4, 255) in the 5th round out of Clemson in the 2023 draft. In the last two years (with the Commanders, Bengals and Cowboys) Henry has played in 14 games with 3 starts and has 2 1/2 sacks. He has also played 144 special teams snaps. Henry has not played in a game for the Eagles.\n\nLB Ochaun Mathis: The Rams drafted Mathis (6-5, 260) in the 6th round out of Nebraska in the 2023 draft. Mathis played in the Baltimore game in 2024 and had 9 special teams snaps. In his NFL career, Mathis has played in 14 games.\n\nTE Nick Muse: The Eagles didn’t sign Muse (6-5, 252) to their practice squad until January. The Vikings selected him in the 7th round out of South Carolina in 2022. He played in 16 games over three seasons with the Vikings and had 1 catch for 22 yards.\n\nDB Parry Nickerson: The Eagles kept the 30-year-old veteran around all season after a strong training camp. Nickerson has played in 30 games with 3 starts in his NFL career and was with Vic Fangio in Miami in 2023, playing five games for the Dolphins.\n\nDB Andre’ Sam: Everyone knew it was Saquon Barkley and Cooper DeJean’s birthday on Super Bowl Sunday but it was also Sam’s birthday! Sam turned 26 as the Eagles beat the Chiefs. Sam played in one game this season against the Panthers; 12 special teams snaps.\n\nOT Laekin Vakalahi: The Eagles had an international exemption for Vakalahi, who is from Australia. He was the 17th member of the practice squad all season and will have another exemption spot in 2025.\n\nDB A.J. Woods: Woods (5-9, 186) went undrafted out of Pitt in 2024. He initially signed with the Commanders and signed with the Eagles’ practice squad in early September. He didn’t see any game action in 2024.\n\nSubscribe to Eagle Eye anywhere you get your podcasts:\n\nApple Podcasts | YouTube Music | Spotify | Stitcher | Simplecast | RSS | Watch on YouTube",

Those firings were the latest in a governmentwide effort to reduce the federal workforce.\n\nGet top local stories in Philly delivered to you every morning. Sign up for NBC Philadelphia's News Headlines newsletter.\n\nThis week, the three sources told NBC News, career employees at high managerial levels, namely Senior Executive Service and General Schedule 15 employees, may be removed from agencies across DHS — not to reduce the size of the workforce but to remove employees whom the administration sees as potentially standing in the way of goals the Trump administration has for the agency.\n\nDHS, which includes Customs and Border Protection and Immigration and Customs Enforcement, is the primary agency tasked with enforcing U.S. immigration law. Trump has relied heavily on CBP to secure the southwest border and on ICE to ramp up arrests and deportations of undocumented immigrants living in the United States.\n\nThe employees at those high levels “are career people who have an influence on policy and strategy in those positions,” said a former senior Biden administration official, responding to news of the plan.\n\nPresident Donald Trump signed a memorandum Thursday which seeks to impose \"fair and reciprocal\" trade tariffs on all major U.S. trading partners, including longtime allies.\n\nA Trump administration official defended the plan. Asked whether reducing the positions would make it harder for DHS to make good on Trump’s immigration goals, the administration official said the administration is removing people who it believes “willfully grind things to a halt.”\n\n“These people put themselves in a terrible position, and they need to be removed,” the Trump administration official said.\n\nSpokespeople for DHS and the White House did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nYamiche Alcindor contributed.\n\nThis article first appeared on NBCNews.com.

        "fullContent": "Michelle King, the top official at the Social Security Administration, left her position this weekend after she refused a request from Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency to access sensitive government records at the agency, according to two sources familiar with the situation who spoke to NBC News.\n\nWhite House spokesperson Harrison Fields confirmed that King was no longer the head of the agency in a statement.\n\n“President Trump has nominated the highly qualified and talented Frank Bisignano to lead the Social Security Administration, and we expect him to be swiftly confirmed in the coming weeks. In the meantime, the agency will be led by a career Social Security anti-fraud expert as the acting commissioner. President Trump is committed to appointing the best and most qualified individuals who are dedicated to working on behalf of the American people, not to appease the bureaucracy that has failed them for far too long,” Fields said.\n\nThe Washington Post was first to report King’s departure.\n\nGet top local stories in Philly delivered to you every morning. Sign up for NBC Philadelphia's News Headlines newsletter.\n\nOne of the sources familiar with the situation, Nancy Altman, president of Social Security Works, a left-leaning group focused on protecting and expanding Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, told NBC News she learned of the situation after speaking with several current officials at the agency.\n\nAltman said some of the information involved in the dispute included Americans’ bank information, social security numbers, earnings records, marital statuses, dates of birth and in some cases medical records if a person has applied for disability benefits.\n\n“She was replaced as acting commissioner because she would not give access to the sensitive information,” Altman said of King. “So, she was replaced with someone who presumably will. But she was not forced to leave the agency. That was her choice. It was the White House’s choice to not let her be head of the agency anymore.”\n\nPresident Donald Trump has appointed Leland Dudek, a manager in charge of Social Security’s anti-fraud office, as acting commissioner of the Social Security Administration now that King is out.\n\nAltman slammed DOGE’s request of King and the Social Security Administration.\n\n“I don’t think you can overstate how serious this breach is,” Altman said. “The information that the Social Security Administration has is a lot of personal data that most people would like to keep private and they entrusted to the government through tax returns and through their employers sending in earning statements. The assumption is that the government will be very careful with it.”\n\nKing, who has worked at the Social Security Administration for decades, has chosen to retire, Altman said.\n\nThe SSA did not immediately return a request for comment.\n\nKing’s departure is the latest in a wave of exits from senior officials whose agencies have come into DOGE’s crosshairs.\n\nThe agency is in charge of managing payments for more than 70 million Americans. Trump has vowed not to enact cuts to retirement benefits.\n\nIn an interview with Fox News, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt confirmed that the president \"has directed Elon Musk and the DOGE team to identify fraud at the Social Security Administration.\" She said that while the team hadn't \"dug into the books,\" they suspected that widespread fraud was occurring.\n\nThe SSA's inspector general released a report in July that found between 2015 and 2022, only .84% of benefits payments were improper.\n\nThis is not the first time DOGE has drawn scrutiny over attempts to access sensitive information. A DOGE-affiliated employee at the Internal Revenue Service is expected to seek access to an IRS system housing sensitive taxpayer information, an administration official told NBC News on Sunday.\n\nDOGE additionally accessed the Treasury Department’s payment system earlier this month, which stores Social Security numbers and other confidential financial information. Several lawsuits were then filed claiming that DOGE’s access to this data violated federal privacy laws. Justice Department attorneys subsequently agreed to temporarily restrict DOGE’s access to the Treasury Department’s systems, save for two employees given “read only” access “as needed.”\n\nA judge later temporarily blocked political appointees and special government employees — including those who work at DOGE — from accessing sensitive and confidential information stored within the treasury.\n\nHomeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem also said this month that Trump authorized Musk to access disaster data housed within FEMA.\n\nThis article first appeared on NBCNews.com.

        "fullContent": "Egypt is developing a plan to rebuild Gaza without forcing Palestinians out of the strip in a counter to President Donald Trump’s proposal to depopulate the territory so the U.S. can take it over.\n\nEgypt’s state-run Al-Ahram newspaper said the proposal calls for establishing “secure areas” within Gaza where Palestinians can live initially while Egyptian and international construction firms remove and rehabilitate the strip’s infrastructure.\n\nEgyptian officials have been discussing the plan with European diplomats as well as with Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates, according to two Egyptian officials and Arab and Western diplomats. They are also discussing ways to fund the reconstruction, including an international conference on Gaza reconstruction, said one of the Egyptian officials and an Arab diplomat.\n\nThe officials and diplomats spoke on condition of anonymity because the proposal is still being negotiated.\n\nGet top local stories in Philly delivered to you every morning. Sign up for NBC Philadelphia's News Headlines newsletter.\n\nThe proposal comes after an international uproar over Trump’s call for the removal of Gaza’s population of some 2 million Palestinians. Trump said the United States would take over the Gaza Strip and rebuild it into a “Riviera of the Middle East,” though Palestinians would not be allowed back.\n\nPalestinians have widely said they will not leave their homeland, while Egypt, Jordan – backed by Saudi Arabia – have refused Trump’s calls for them to take in Gaza’s population. Rights groups have widely said the plan amounts to forced expulsion, a potential war crime. European countries have also largely denounced Trump’s plan. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has praised the idea and says Israel is preparing to implement it.\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who was in Saudi Arabia on Monday in a tour of the region, has said the United States was up to hearing alternative proposals. “If the Arab countries have a better plan, then that’s great,” Rubio said Thursday on the U.S. radio program “Clay and Buck Show.”\n\nEgypt’s Al-Ahram newspaper said the proposal is designed to “refute American President Trump’s logic” and counter “any other visions or plans that aim to change the geographic and demographic structure of Gaza Strip.”\n\nGaza is nearing a critical juncture with the first phase of a ceasefire due to run out in early March. Israel and Hamas must still negotiate a second phase meant to bring a release of all remaining hostages held by the militants, a full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and a long-term halt to the war.\n\nAny reconstruction plan will be impossible to implement without a deal on the second phase, including an agreement on who will govern Gaza in the long term. Israel demands the elimination of Hamas as a political or military force in the territory, and international donors are unlikely to contribute to any rebuilding if Hamas is in charge.\n\nCentral in Egypt’s proposal is the establishment of a Palestinian administration that is not aligned with either Hamas or the Palestinian Authority to run the strip and oversee the reconstruction efforts, according to the two Egyptian officials involved in the efforts.\n\nIt also calls for a Palestinian police force mainly made up of former Palestinian Authority policemen who remained in Gaza after Hamas took over the enclave in 2007, with reinforcement from Egyptian- and Western-trained forces.\n\nPresident Donald Trump said at an Oval Office meeting Tuesday with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that the U.S. should take control of the Gaza Strip.\n\nAsked about the possibility of deploying an Arab force in Gaza one Egyptian official and the Arab diplomat said Arab countries would only agree if there were a “clear path” for the establishment of an independent Palestinian state. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has rejected any Palestinian state as well as any role for Hamas or the Western-backed Palestinian Authority in governing Gaza, though he has not put forward any clear alternative.\n\nHamas has said it is willing to give up power in Gaza. Hamas spokesman Abdul Latif al-Qanou told The Associated Press on Sunday that the group has accepted either a Palestinian unity government without Hamas’ participation or a committee of technocrats to run the territory. The Palestinian Authority, which governs pockets of the West Bank, has so far opposed any plans for Gaza that exclude it.\n\nThe Western diplomat said France and Germany have backed the idea of Arab countries developing a counterproposal to Trump’s plan, and that Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi discussed his government's efforts with the French president in a phone call earlier this month.\n\nEgyptian Foreign Minister Badr Abdelatty also briefed the German foreign minister and other EU officials on the sidelines of last week’s Munich security conference, one of the Egyptian officials said.\n\nOfficials from Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates and Jordan will discuss Egypt’s proposal at a gathering in Riyadh this week, before introducing it to the Arab summit later this month, according to the two Egyptian officials and the Arab diplomat.\n\nIsarel’s 16-month campaign in Gaza, triggered by Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023 attack, devastated the territory. Around a quarter million housing units have been destroyed or damaged, according to U.N. estimates. More than 90% of the roads and more than 80% of health facilities have been damaged or destroyed. Damage to infrastructure has been estimated at some $30 billion, along with an estimated $16 billion in damaged to housing.\n\nEgypt’s plan calls for a three-phase reconstruction process that will take up to five years without removing Palestinians from Gaza, the Egyptian officials said.\n\nIt designates three “safe zones” within Gaza to relocate Palestinians during an initial six-month “early recovery period.” The zones will be equipped with mobile houses and shelters, with humanitarian aid streaming in.\n\nMore than two dozen Egyptian and international firms would take part in removing the rubble and rebuilding the strip’s infrastructure. The reconstruction would provide tens of thousands of jobs to Gaza’s population, the officials said.",

        "fullContent": "As work crews race to clear debris from thousands of homes and businesses destroyed in last month’s wildfires in Los Angeles, residents are grappling with whether they can afford to stay in a region where real estate prices were already out of reach for many people.\n\nDisplaced homeowners and renters are facing an economic landscape rife with long-standing affordability and equity concerns, illuminating the gulf between those who can afford to start over from scratch and those who cannot.\n\n“It’s intimidating,” said Kaitlyn Little, who grew up in Pacific Palisades, one of hundreds of distinct neighborhoods that make up the city of Los Angeles. “It just reinforces the feelings of uncertainty and uneasiness about what the future of that town really does look like.”\n\nThe last photo taken of Kaitlyn Little and her 2-year-old son before their condo burned down last month. (Courtesy Kaitlyn Little)\n\nGet top local stories in Philly delivered to you every morning. Sign up for NBC Philadelphia's News Headlines newsletter.\n\nLittle lost the Palisades condominium she shared with her husband and their 2-year-old child in the Jan. 7 fires that razed entire communities. At least 29 people were killed in the multiday siege, and more than 16,000 structures, the majority residences, were destroyed.\n\nNow, Little finds herself in a market where the average home price in Los Angeles County is just shy of $1 million and the average rent is nearly $3,000, according to Zillow. State and local leaders have warned against price gouging, but displaced families said they are already feeling the pinch.\n\nAt this point, Little said, she cannot afford to rebuild, much less buy a home.\n\n“Our renters insurance doesn’t begin to cover the cost of what was lost,” she said.\n\nAmid the devastating wildfires ravaging Southern California, Angelenos have found an important lifeline in the nonprofit app Watch Duty. Founder John Mills dials-in and explains how banding together information from radio operators who listen to firefighters talking on the ground has helped millions of Los Angeles residents stay up to date on evacuation orders, fire updates and more.\n\nLike many survivors, Little did not have time to pack before evacuating. She ran out of the condominium she rented with the clothes on her back and three diapers. She thought she would return home in a few hours.\n\nAfter completing seemingly endless paperwork, Little received a $16,000 payout. She is attempting to stretch that out to cover moving into a new apartment and buying new clothes and essentials for her family of three.\n\nShe yearns to return to the Palisades after it is rebuilt, but worries that rising rents could force her and her family to relocate permanently.\n\n“Going back is the dream, but there are so many factors at play,” she said. “What does it look like a year from now and how are the schools going to be?”\n\nEconomic losses reach $250 billion\n\nEarly estimates of the total economic loss from the fires have soared to $250 billion. According to a recent economic impact study by the University of California, Los Angeles, areas near the burn zones could suffer wage losses of nearly $300 million because so many businesses were destroyed and few customers are around to patronize those that survived.\n\nThe study also confirmed what most people already knew: The housing market will become more unaffordable in coming years, and rentals, already in short supply before the fires, will become even pricier.\n\n“The reduction in the supply of housing is going to raise prices,” said Adam Rose, senior research fellow and director emeritus of the Center for Risk and Economic Analysis of Threats and Emergencies at the University of Southern California. “The only thing that’s going to offset that is if people move elsewhere.”\n\nState and local leaders have expedited recovery efforts by waiving permits and lifting some environmental regulations. But the rush to rebuild is already leaving some survivors in the dust.\n\nThe Sayegh family lost seven properties when the Eaton Fire ripped through Altadena. \"Almost everyone here lost their home or business,\" Freddy Sayegh said. (Courtesy Freddy Sayegh)\n\n“This is gonna be a long, tough, difficult road,” said Altadena resident Freddy Sayegh, whose extended family lost a total of seven properties in the Eaton Fire.\n\n“What we don’t want is unscrupulous developers coming in here trying to build and make a profit and increase the home prices, decreasing the ability to have affordable housing.”\n\nIn the weeks since the fire, Sayegh, his wife and two children have bounced from one short-term rental to the next. He now drives more than an hour to drop his kids off at school and continues to look for a house or apartment to rent that he can afford. His law office was badly smoke damaged and several businesses owned by his family, including an auto parts store and a gas station, were destroyed, he said.\n\nHis homeowners insurance payout will cover smoke remediation, a timely and painstaking process to remove toxic particles and soot from his ranch-style home. But his commercial properties near north Lake Avenue, a busy thoroughfare consumed by the fire, were underinsured and Sayegh anticipates his payout will not be enough to rebuild.\n\nWhile he waits to meet with adjusters to determine how much he will receive, Sayegh is helping to organize a coalition of Altadena residents and businesses that will work to make the rebuilding effort affordable and attainable for longtime community members. The group will operate like a labor union, negotiating with builders and architects for the best prices on large-scale construction projects, he said.\n\nAlthough wildfires occur naturally, climate change amplifies their intensity and how quickly they can spread. Meteorologist Chase Cain explains two of the strongest links between climate change and the wildfire emergency in Southern California.\n\nAltadena resident Maria Shufeldt said the homeowner-focused effort may not do much to help her. The building where she rented an apartment for 13 years withstood the flames but was badly damaged by smoke. She shuffled through three different hotels as she hunted for a rental.\n\nShe spent much of Thursday afternoon speaking with the Red Cross and the Federal Emergency Management Agency in hopes of extending her hotel stay until her new apartment is ready. The whole recovery experience has left her numb and exhausted.\n\n“It completely makes you almost not able to function in real life, because you’re constantly dealing with what’s next,” she said.\n\n'Death of the American dream'\n\nEven homeowners in tony Pacific Palisades face displacement. Blake Mallen, an entrepreneur, lived in a home valued at more than $3 million near the trailhead where the Palisades Fire was first reported. The five-bedroom, five-bathroom home was paid off in full, but Mallen was one of some 1,600 Palisades residents dropped by their homeowners insurance companies last year amid soaring costs and an increasing risk of wildfires.\n\nHe attempted to supplement his homeowners insurance through California’s FAIR Plan, the state’s insurer of last resort, but was told he did not qualify because his home value was too high.\n\nWithout insurance, Mallen has been unable to recoup losses.\n\n“This is the death of the American dream,” he said. “We’re seeing the core of our community fragment.”\n\nMallen has spent much of the past five weeks on the phone with lawyers, hoping to find a loophole that will make him eligible for some kind of payout. For now, he is facing a total financial loss, he said. His home of seven years was not just where he and his wife raised their two children, it was their entire nest egg.\n\n“Right now, we couldn’t even rebuild if we wanted to,” he said, speaking from his rental house in L.A.’s Venice neighborhood. “Do I even want to rebuild a house that can’t get insurance?”\n\nResidents who can afford to rebuild also face uncertainty as tariffs and inflation threaten to increase the price of materials.\n\nIn Sunset Mesa, near Pacific Palisades, longtime resident Tom Reed said he plans to start construction to replace his destroyed home as soon as possible and is already negotiating the cost of an architect. Reed has carefully mapped out rental costs for the next three years to help stay within the budget dictated by his insurance payout. He and his wife are even renting furniture for their temporary apartment, instead of buying.\n\nWhile forging ahead, he said he knows some items lost in the fire can never be replaced. The amateur photographer estimates he lost some 100,000 negatives and photos when the Palisades Fire tore through his oceanside community.\n\n“As I tell people, you can’t look back. Let’s just look forward and keep going forward,” he said. “That’s all you can do.”\n\nThis story first appeared on NBCNews.com. More from NBC News:",

Sign up for NBC Philadelphia's News Headlines newsletter.\n\nA spokeswoman for the mayor, Kayla Mamelak, said Sunday that no deputy mayors have submitted resignations. However, on Monday City Hall issued a statement confirming the resignations.\n\n“Maria Torres-Springer, Anne Williams-Isom, Meera Joshi, and Chauncey Parker are extraordinary public servants who have been vital to our work reshaping New York City,\" the mayor's office said in a statement Monday. \"Together, we’ve broken housing records, created the most jobs in the city’s history, provided for hundreds of thousands of longtime New Yorkers and migrants, built unprecedented public spaces, and made our city safer at every level. New Yorkers owe them an enormous debt of gratitude for their service to our city.\"\n\nThe statement goes on to say: “I am disappointed to see them go, but given the current challenges, I understand their decision and wish them nothing but success in the future.\n\n“But let me be crystal clear: New York City will keep moving forward, just as it does every day. All deputy mayors will remain in their roles for the time being to ensure a seamless transition. The people of New York City remain, without question, our top priority.\n\n“I am solely beholden to the 8.3 million New Yorkers I represent, and I will always put this city first — as I always have.”\n\nInitially, the two sources who attended the Sunday meeting said that three deputy mayors -- First Deputy Mayor Maria Torres Springer, Deputy Mayor for Operations Meera Joshi, and Deputy Mayor for Health and Human Services Anne Williams Isom -- had already told the mayor of their intention to step down during an in-person meeting at Gracie Mansion on Friday, according to a source with knowledge.\n\nThe senior aides expressed concerns about their ability to serve in the mayor’s administration after a controversial move by the Trump Justice Department to temporarily set aside criminal charges against Adams.\n\nNew York Gov. Kathy Hochul released a statement Monday night expressing concern the deputy mayors felt they could not remain with the administration.\n\n\"If they feel unable to serve in City Hall at this time, that raises serious questions about the long-term future of this Mayoral administration,\" Hochul said. The governor has the constitutional ability to remove the mayor, though it has never happened in the city's history.\n\nA fourth deputy mayor - Chauncey Parker - who oversees public safety had told the mayor’s office of his desire to leave and was also on the call Sunday, according to a source familiar.\n\nDue to the extraordinary events of the last few weeks and to stay faithful to the oaths we swore to New Yorkers and our families, we have come to the difficult decision to step down from our roles. Maria Torres-Springer, Anne Williams-Isom, and Meera Joshi\n\nAnother source familiar with the deputy mayors' conversations, however, said the three deputy mayors who told Adams Friday of their intention to resign made it clear again on the Sunday call that it was still their intention to depart in late March.\n\nOn Monday, Torres-Springer, Williams-Isom and Joshi put out a joint statement in which they described serving as deputy mayors as \"the greatest honor and privilege of our lives.\"\n\n\"We have worked each day with the singular mission of improving the lives of New Yorkers and strengthening the physical foundation of the city we love,\" their joint statement reads. \"Due to the extraordinary events of the last few weeks and to stay faithful to the oaths we swore to New Yorkers and our families, we have come to the difficult decision to step down from our roles. While our time in this administration will come to a close, our support for the incredible public servants across the administration with whom we have stood shoulder to shoulder and our championing of this great city and all it stands for will never cease. We sincerely thank the mayor for giving us the opportunity to serve New Yorkers in these roles, stand ready to ensure a smooth transition of our duties, and wish Mayor Adams and all of our colleagues much strength and courage in the work ahead.”\n\nMeanwhile, in a separate statement, Parker said: \"Serving as deputy mayor for public safety under Mayor Adams has been an honor of a lifetime. Together, we have made our streets safer, more just, and have improved quality of life for all New Yorkers. I am confident that the administration will continue on our mission to deliver for the people of this city.”\n\nProtesters amassed in Lower Manhattan Sunday urging Gov. Kathy Hochul to step in and remove Adams as mayor of New York City, alleging he's being held hostage by a quid pro quo deal with the Trump administration in an effort to have his criminal corruption case dismissed, as a top federal prosecutor alleged before they resigned in protest.\n\nDozens of people braved the cold once more Monday to protest for the second day in a row and ask Hochul to remove Adams.\n\nNew York City Council Speaker Adrienne Adams (who is not related to the mayor) called on the mayor to resign Monday following news of the deputy mayors' departure.\n\n“With the resignation of deputy mayors, it has become clear that Mayor Adams has now lost the confidence and trust of his own staff, his colleagues in government, and New Yorkers. He now must prioritize New York City and New Yorkers, step aside and resign,\" speaker Adams said in a statement. \"This administration no longer has the ability to effectively govern with Eric Adams as mayor. These resignations are the culmination of the mayor’s actions and decisions that have led to months of instability and now compromise the City’s sovereignty, threaten chaos, and risk harm to our families. There is too much at stake for our city and New Yorkers to allow this to continue. We have endured enough scandal, selfishness and embarrassment, all of which distract from the leadership that New Yorkers deserve. This is the opposite of public service. Our city needs a leader totally committed to protecting New Yorkers and improving their lives.”\n\nHochul said she plans to meet with \"key leaders\" in her Manhattan office on Tuesday to discuss the next steps for the city.\n\n\"The alleged conduct at City Hall that has been reported over the past two weeks is troubling and cannot be ignored. Tomorrow, I have asked key leaders to meet me at my Manhattan office for a conversation about the path forward, with the goal of ensuring stability for the City of New York,\" Hochul said.\n\nMeanwhile, also on Monday, community and clergy leaders, along with supporters of Adams, gathered at Rehoboth Cathedral in Brooklyn to show solidarity for Adams. The mayor spoke at this event, defending himself, while saying that those who are calling for him to resign are mistaken because he is not stepping down.\n\n\"I ignore the noise, because I know what we have accomplished,\" he said.\n\nThe mayor went on to say that there is \"inconsistency\" in what his opponents are saying.\n\n\"They are trying to rewrite my entire history with their own agenda,\" he said.\n\nRead Gov. Kathy Hochul's full Monday night statement\n\nNew York Gov. Kathy Hochul released a statement Monday night:\n\n“Since taking office in 2021, I’ve done everything possible to partner with the City of New York under the leadership of two different mayors. We’ve worked together to fight crime on the streets and subways, close illegal cannabis shops and build more housing through ‘City of Yes’. Bickering between State and City officials is a waste of time and I refuse to go back to the days where our constituents are caught in the crossfire of political turf wars.\n\n“Earlier today I spoke with First Deputy Mayor Maria Torres-Springer to express my gratitude for her years of service to New York City. She, along with Deputy Mayors Anne Williams-Isom, Meera Joshi and Chauncey Parker, have been strong partners with my Administration across dozens of key issues. If they feel unable to serve in City Hall at this time, that raises serious questions about the long-term future of this Mayoral administration.\n\n“I recognize the immense responsibility I hold as governor and the constitutional powers granted to this office. In the 235 years of New York State history, these powers have never been utilized to remove a duly-elected mayor; overturning the will of the voters is a serious step that should not be taken lightly. That said, the alleged conduct at City Hall that has been reported over the past two weeks is troubling and cannot be ignored. Tomorrow, I have asked key leaders to meet me at my Manhattan office for a conversation about the path forward, with the goal of ensuring stability for the City of New York.\n\n“Let me be clear: my most urgent concern is the well-being of my 8.3 million constituents who live in New York City. I will be monitoring this situation extraordinarily closely to ensure that New Yorkers are not being shortchanged by the current crisis in City government.”",

        "fullContent": "The greatest pass of Jalen Hurts’ life, the first parade in Philadelphia history and a look at Josh Sweat’s future.\n\nRoob’s 10 Random Eagles Observations have now morphed into Roob’s 10 Random Eagles Offseason Observations, and that’s what they’ll remain until training camp starts in a little over five months.\n\nWow, that’s soon.\n\n1A. That dagger 46-yard touchdown to DeVonta Smith may have been Jalen Hurts’ greatest pass ever and certainly one of the greatest Super Bowl touchdowns ever. I’ve watched this one more than any play since 4th and 26, easily over 100 times, and it never ceases to astonish me. The Eagles already led 27-0 and had a 1st-and-10 on the Chiefs’ 46-yard-line after Avonte Maddox’s 4th-down pass breakup early in the third round quarter. Start with DeVonta, who separates from Chiefs corner Jaylen Watson right off the line of scrimmage. Watson tries to get a jam on Smith but can’t, and Smith just runs unimpeded at full speed down the field toward the end zone. Hurts has incredible protection on the play from his o-line and also Saquon Barkley and backup tight end Grant Calcaterra, who both pick up blitzes. He play-fakes to Barkley and when he unloads, there isn’t a Chief within five feet of him. He’s got a clean pocket to work in, and he takes time to get his feet under him, set and fire. Smith first turns around to look for the ball at the 30-yard-line, which is a split second before Hurts releases it. Smith never breaks stride. Never slows down. Their timing is perfect. And Smith doesn’t do anything to let Watson know the ball is on the way. Watson never turns around and never makes up that step that DeVonta has on him. Smith doesn’t have to move his hands until just before the ball arrives because the ball is heading precisely into his grasp. Smith jumps just a bit as he crosses the plane of the end zone and catches the ball a little off the ground. Watson immediately tackles Smith and tries to pry the ball away, but Smith wasn’t about to let go as he tumbles to the ground. Touchdown Eagles and a 34-0 lead. Smith and Hurts have known each other since Smith was in high school and Hurts was his host during his visit to Alabama. They’ve both talked often about how instead of partying they went to the football facility and threw and studied film. They’ve taken countless reps together since then, spent innumerable hours studying, thrown with each other every offseason. They’ve both put an insane amount of time together working toward this one moment, and on the biggest stage they showed what football perfection looks like.\n\nGet top local stories in Philly delivered to you every morning.

If you don’t think Sirianni has anything to do with the offense, that’s a must-see video. Sirianni kicked himself after Super Bowl LVII for not being aggressive enough, and he just wasn’t going to let it happen again. Brilliant.\n\n1C. The other unbelievable thing about that play — and you can see this in the end zone copy — is how quickly Saquon Barkley raises his fist. The ball is still on its upward trajectory and Saquon is already celebrating.\n\n2A. Nick Sirianni is only the second coach in NFL history to win six playoff games in his first four seasons. Joe Gibbs won six with Washington from 1981 through 1984. Tom Flores, John Fox, Mike Tomlin, Paul Brown, George Seifert and Bill Parcells each won five.\n\n2B. The Eagles won six playoff games from 1961 through 1999. They’ve won six playoff games since 2022.\n\n3. An underrated facet of the Eagles’ monster defensive performance last Sunday was the way they shut down the Chiefs’ running game while Kansas City was still trying to run the ball. The Chiefs were 3-for-3 rushing in the first half and they were 6-for-17 at the point the Eagles went up 34-0. They didn’t have a run from scrimmage longer than eight yards and Patrick Mahomes had a couple scrambles late, but the Chiefs’ running backs netted 24 total yards, 4th-fewest in Super Bowl history behind the 1985 Broncos (8), 2002 Raiders (16) and 1974 Vikings (17). The Chiefs realized early they couldn’t run against the Eagles, and Andy Reid stopped even trying while the game was still somewhat close. That let the Eagles’ defensive front tee off on the Chiefs’ hapless offensive line. Isiah Pacheco, who gashed the Eagles for 76 yards on 15 carries in Super Bowl LVII two years ago, ran three times for seven yards, and Kareem Hunt, who had a bounce-back season with 728 yards and seven TDs, managed nine yards on three carries. This defensive front is dangerous enough against a balanced offense. When it knows the other team is going to throw? Forget it. You have no shot.\n\n4. The first championship parade in Philadelphia history took place on Nov. 5, 1910, two weeks after the Athletics finished off the Cubs with a 7-2 win in Game 5 of the World Series at Chicago’s West Side Grounds. The parade route went south on Broad Street, starting at Montgomery, around the west side of City Hall, then south to Wolf Street. This was an evening parade, starting at 8 p.m. According to the Nov. 7, 1910, Inquirer “nearly a million” people watched, although according to the Delaware County Times, “The spectacle was witnessed by 100,000 persons.” I’m guessing the Inquirer’s estimate was closer to the actual attendance. A non-bylined columnist wrote: “The tribe of (Connie) Mack had brought distinction to the good, old town and everyone seemed imbued with the desire to give some expression of their appreciation. Everybody was there and everybody was happy.” Some things never change.\n\n5. Quarterbacks who’ve put up at least 33 points in multiple Super Bowls: Bart Starr, Joe Montana, Tom Brady, Jalen Hurts.\n\n6. Jake Elliott’s revival is one of the coolest stories of the 2024 postseason. He was so unreliable during the regular season, missing eight field goal attempts and going 1-for-7 from 50 yards and out (the rest of the league made 71 percent) and then he missed three PATs the first two weeks of the postseason, the second kicker in NFL history to miss three PATs in a single postseason, and then missed a 54-yarder in the NFC Championship Game. Not a chip shot but a 73 percent kick league-wide this year. So it wasn’t easy to be super confident in Elliott heading into the Super Bowl, although he was money in his first two. As a rookie, he made incredibly high-pressure kicks from 42 and 46 yards in the fourth quarter of Super Bowl LII in Minneapolis and then two years ago he was 2-for-2 in Glendale in Super Bowl LVII. So what does he do Sunday? After going 3-for-9 from 48 yards and out during the regular season, he matches his entire season total of 48-yard kicks with field goals from 48, 48 and 50 yards. He became the first kicker ever with three field goals of at least 48 yards in the same Super Bowl and only the second with three career 48-yarders in a Super Bowl. Elliott is now responsible for three of the 14-longest Super Bowl field goals ever and his 9-for-9 in Super Bowls is the best ever. Overall, Elliott was 10-for-11 this postseason, and he’s now 26-for-27 in his career in the postseason for 96.3 percent, 2nd-highest ever (minimum 20 attempts) behind Robbie Gould’s 29-for-29. Who he can’t catch. Elliott is one of only seven kickers to play in three Super Bowls and along with Lane Johnson, Brandon Graham and Rick Lovato, he’s one of four Eagles to win two Super Bowls. A month ago, what to do with Elliott seemed like it would be a huge question this offseason. But he proved he’s still got it, and he did it in some high-leverage situations. After that performance? He’s not going anywhere.\n\n7. Somebody needs to explain Josh Sweat’s last couple years to me. Coming off his 11-sack 2022 season, he opens 2023 with a dominating 6 ½ sacks in his first nine games, then goes 12 straight games over the 2023 and 2024 seasons without a sack. Starting in Week 4 this year, he picks up seven sacks in eight games and looks unstoppable again, then gets one sack in his next eight games. Going into the Super Bowl you know Brandon Graham isn’t going to play much, Bryce Huff will be inactive and Sweat is in another lengthy slump, and you’re thinking Nolan Smith is the only edge guy who’s going to be able to generate pressure. Then all Sweat does in Super Bowl LIX is record a career-high 2 ½ sacks – 5th-most in Super Bowl history – along with two QB hits and two tackles for loss. He picked the biggest game of his life for the best game of his life. Remember how Derrick Burgess parlayed a huge NFC Championship Game in 2004 against Michael Vick and the Falcons into a huge (at the time) five-year, $17.5 million contract with the Raiders? Burgess only had 2 ½ sacks during the 2004 regular season but had 3.0 in the playoffs. Obviously, Sweat’s production is beyond Burgess’s, but the dynamic is similar. An edge rusher who made himself a ton of money with a huge postseason. Everybody is looking for edge rushers, and with Smith having a breakthrough season and Jalyx Hunt popping late in the season – 1 ½ sacks , three QB hits and one tackle for loss in the regular season, 1 ½ sacks, three QB hits and one tackle for loss in the playoffs – I could see the Eagles going with those two plus a high draft pick in their edge rotation and not over-paying to keep Sweat. And because of his contract, Huff will still be here and get an opportunity to find a spot in the rotation as well. Sweat’s been a very good if inconsistent player during his seven years here. He’s 8th in Eagles history with 48 sacks, and he’s still only 27. Sweat says he wants to be here and expects to get something done, and I’m sure Howie Roseman would love to keep him. I’m just not sure the numbers will agree. If he hits the open market, he’s going to get offers the Eagles may not be able to match.\n\n8A. The last two Super Bowl-winning quarterbacks drafted outside the first round are Nick Foles and Jalen Hurts.\n\n8B. The Eagles are the only team in NFL history to draft two Super Bowl-winning quarterbacks outside the first round.\n\n8C. The only other teams that have drafted two QBs who’ve each won a Super Bowl for the team that drafted them are the Cowboys (Roger Staubach, Troy Aikman), Packers (Bart Starr, Aaron Rodgers), Giants (Phil Simms, Jeff Hostetler) and Steelers (Terry Bradshaw, Ben Roethlisberger).\n\n8D. Remember, the Falcons drafted Brett Favre, the Patriots drafted Jim Plunkett, the Steelers drafted Len Dawson, the Chargers drafted Eli Manning and the Buccaneers drafted Steve Young and Doug Williams.\n\n9A. Four interior linemen in Eagles history have had 2.0 or more sacks in a single postseason. One is Darwin Walker in 2006. The others are Jalen Carter, Milton Williams and Jordan Davis this year.\n\n9B. The Eagles are the first team in NFL history to have three interior linemen record multiple sacks in the same postseason. Only two teams – the 1992 and 1995 Cowboys – also had more than one – Tony Casillas and Russell Maryland in 1992 and Chad Hennings and Leon Lett in 1995. Both those Cowboys teams beat the Eagles in the conference semifinals.\n\n9C. Eagles interior defensive linemen had 13 ½ postseason sacks from 1982 – when sacks became an official NFL stat – through 2023. Eagles interior defensive linemen had 7.0 sacks this year. So 34 percent of the postseason sacks interior linemen have ever recorded for the Eagles came this year.\n\n10. Jalen Hurts had one passing touchdown and three rushing touchdowns in his first Super Bowl and two passing TDs and one rushing TD this time. His seven total touchdowns are most ever by a quarterback in his first two Super Bowls. Joe Montana previously had the most with five TDs in his first two Super Bowls. Only five quarterbacks have more career Super Bowl touchdowns than Hurts: Tom Brady (21), Montana (13), Patrick Mahomes (11), Terry Bradshaw (9) and Roger Staubach (8).\n\nSubscribe to Eagle Eye anywhere you get your podcasts:\n\nApple Podcasts | YouTube Music | Spotify | Stitcher | Simplecast | RSS | Watch on YouTube",

        "fullContent": "The Vatican on Tuesday canceled papal audiences through the weekend and delegated others to cover for Pope Francis as the 88-year-old pope remained hospitalized with a multi-pronged respiratory infection.\n\nThe cancellations put a damper on upcoming events of the Vatican’s big Holy Year, the once-every-quarter-century celebration of Catholicism that is aimed at encouraging pilgrims to come to Rome to participate in special Jubilee activities. Expected to draw some 30 million people to Rome, the Holy Year is packed with special papal audiences and Masses throughout 2025, some of which have now been put into question given Francis’ illness.\n\nFrancis was admitted to Rome’s Gemelli hospital in a “fair” condition on Friday after a weeklong bout of bronchitis worsened. On Monday, medical personnel determined that he was suffering from a polymicrobial respiratory tract infection, meaning a mix of viruses, bacteria and possibly other organisms had colonized in his respiratory tract. The Vatican has given no indication of how long he might remain hospitalized, only saying that the treatment of such a “complex clinical picture” would require an “adequate” stay.\n\nGet top local stories in Philly delivered to you every morning. Sign up for NBC Philadelphia's News Headlines newsletter.\n\nFrancis once again had a peaceful night, ate breakfast and read the newspapers Tuesday morning, Vatican spokesman Matteo Bruni said. A more detailed medical update was expected later.\n\nOn Monday, Francis resumed doing some work and made his daily call to a Gaza City parish to check in on the Catholic community there.\n\nThis Holy Year weekend was dedicated to deacons, the ministry that is a necessary step for men who are preparing to become priests. Francis had an unrelated audience Saturday and was supposed to have ordained the deacons during a Mass on Sunday. The Vatican on Tuesday announced his audience was canceled and that the archbishop who is organizing the Jubilee would celebrate the Mass. It’s a similar arrangement that the Vatican announced last weekend when artists in town had to settle for a cardinal presiding over their special Mass.\n\nThe next Jubilee events on the calendar that would typically involve the pope are the March 8-9 weekend dedicated to volunteers.\n\nFrancis had part of one lung removed after a pulmonary infection as a young man and is prone to bouts of bronchitis in winter. He has admitted in the past that he is a non-compliant patient, and even his close Vatican aides have said he pushed himself too far even once his bronchitis was diagnosed.\n\nHe refused to let up on his busy schedule and ignored medical advice to stay indoors during Rome’s chilly winter, insisting on sitting through an outdoor Jubilee Mass for the armed forces on Feb. 9 even though he was having trouble breathing.\n\nFrancis’ hospital admission this year has already sidelined him for longer than a 2023 hospitalization for pneumonia.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press religion coverage receives support through the AP’s collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

Zajko was charged with trespassing, obstructing and hindering, resisting arrest and handgun on person. Blank was charged with trespassing, obstructing and hindering.

The Zizians have been tied to the killing of U.S. Border Patrol Agent David Maland near the Canadian border in January 2025.\n\nMaland, 44, was killed in a Jan. 20 shootout following a traffic stop in Coventry, Vermont, a small town about 20 miles (32 kilometers) from the Canadian border. Teresa Youngblut, 21, was arrested and charged in Maland’s murder. She had been traveling with Felix Bauckholt, a German citizen who also was killed, and the pair had been under surveillance for several days.\n\nAccording to an FBI affidavit, Maland pulled over Youngblut and Bauckholt on Interstate 91 to conduct an immigration inspection. At the time, Bauckholt appeared to have an expired visa, according to a Department of Homeland Security database, but investigators later confirmed that his visa was current, the FBI said.\n\nYoungblut, who had been driving Bauckholt’s car, got out and opened fire on Maland and other officers without warning, the FBI alleges. Bauckholt tried to draw a gun but was shot, the affidavit states.\n\nAt least one border agent fired on Youngblut and Bauckholt, but authorities haven’t specified whose bullets hit whom.\n\nIn this undated and unknown location photo released by the Department of Homeland Security shows Border Patrol Agent David Maland posing with a service dog. (Department of Homeland Security via AP)\n\nThe murders of Richard Zajko and Rita Zajko\n\nAccording to a motion filed in January, the gun used by Youngblut and the one that Bauckholt was carrying were purchased by a third person in Vermont in February 2024. That buyer was a person of interest in the 2022 murders of 71-year-old Richard Zajko and his wife, 68-year-old Rita Zajko, in Delaware County, Pennsylvania, state police confirmed.\n\nThe two victims were shot to death inside their home on Highland Drive in Chester Heights back on Dec. 31, 2022.\n\nPolice later identified the person of interest in their deaths as their daughter, Michelle Zajko, according to NBC News. Zajko, Lasota and Blank were all initially taken into custody in connection to Richard and Rita Zajko’s deaths back in 2023 but were not charged with their murders at the time, NBC News reported.\n\nL to R: Rita Zajko, Richard Zajko\n\nThe Zizians\n\nInvestigators ultimately linked Lasota and Zajko to the cultlike group known as the Zizians. In addition to the murders of Maland and Zajko’s parents, the group was also allegedly involved in four other homicides in Vermont and California, according to investigators.\n\nThe Associated Press described the Zizians as a group of young, highly intelligent computer scientists, most of them in their 20s and 30s, who met online, shared anarchist beliefs, and became increasingly violent.\n\nTheir goals aren’t clear, but online writings span topics from radical veganism and gender identity to artificial intelligence.\n\nAt the middle of it all is “Ziz,” who appears to be the leader of the group. She has been seen near multiple crime scenes and has connections to various suspects.\n\nLaSota published a dark and sometimes violent blog under the name Ziz and, in one section, described her theory that the two hemispheres of the brain could hold separate values and genders and “often desire to kill each other.”\n\nLaSota, who used she/her pronouns, and in her writings says she is a transgender woman, railed against perceived enemies, including so-called rationalist groups, which operate mostly online and seek to understand human cognition through reason and knowledge. Some are concerned with the potential dangers of artificial intelligence.\n\nLaSota has not responded to multiple Associated Press emails in recent weeks, and her attorney Daniel McGarrigle declined to comment when asked whether she is connected to any of the deaths. Before her weekend arrest, she missed court appearances in two states, and bench warrants have been issued for her arrest.\n\nReached on Monday, McGarrigle would only confirm that he has represented LaSota and wouldn’t confirm her arrest or any details of the latest case.",

One of the documentary's directors, Julia Willoughby Nason, told TODAY.com in an interview about the series that her team reached out to the Laundries.\n\n\"They didn't want to participate,\" she explained, \"and we respect that. This is a very difficult story.\"\n\nGet top local stories in Philly delivered to you every morning. Sign up for NBC Philadelphia's News Headlines newsletter.\n\nPetito's sunny #vanlife Instagram posts from her cross-country travels in a Ford Transit van with fiancé Brian Laundrie were contrasted by a stormy off-camera relationship between the couple.\n\nPetito's disappearance during their trip in August 2021 made national headlines and led to a widespread search that ended when her body was found in a national forest in Wyoming.\n\nHere's what to know about the story.\n\nWho was Gabby Petito?\n\nBorn in 1999, the New York native became a vlogger documenting road trips across the western part of the country. In 2020, she called driving cross-country to Oregon and California \"an absolute dream\" in an Instagram post.\n\n“She wanted to cross the country in the camper van and live the van life and live free. This was her dream,” her mother, Nichole Schmidt, told NBC affiliate KSL in 2021.\n\nGabby Petito, a travel vlogger who was killed by her fiancé during a cross-country trip in 2021, is the subject of the new Netflix docuseries \"American Murder: Gabby Petito.\" Netflix\n\nIn May 2020, she shared her wish on Instagram to get back to traveling the world with Laundrie. The two left her hometown of Blue Point, New York, in July 2021 to embark on a cross-country trip, according to her Instagram posts and comments her mother shared with KSL.\n\nPetito and Laundrie chronicled their journey on a YouTube channel they created called Nomadic Statik. They wrote in the description of a video posted on their channel Aug. 19, 2021, that they had previously traveled across the country together in a Nissan Sentra, but were making the journey this time in a white 2012 Ford Transit van.\n\nWho was Brian Laundrie?\n\nLaundrie first met Petito at Bayport-Blue Point High School in Bayport, New York, Petito's stepfather told The New York Times in 2021. Petito marked her first anniversary with Laundrie in a March 2020 Instagram post.\n\nIn another Instagram post Petito shared a few months later in July, she announced she and Laundrie were engaged. Petito moved from New York to live with Laundrie in Florida, Petito's stepfather previously told The New York Times.\n\nBrian Laundrie, whom the FBI said took responsibility in his writings for the death of fiancée Gabby Petito, was found dead in a Florida preserve in 2021 after Petito's body had been found in Wyoming. @gabspetito / Instagram\n\nLaundrie and Petito were on their cross-country road trip together in the Ford Transit van when she was reported missing. \"The circumstances are odd,\" police said in a statement in September 2021 after recovering the van in North Port, Florida, NBC News reported.\n\nInstagram posts by Petito documented them visiting Monument Rocks in Kansas and Zion National Park and Bryce Canyon National Park in Utah in July 2021.\n\nWhen did Gabby Petito disappear?\n\nPetito's family reported her missing to the Suffolk County Police Department on Sept. 11, 2021, KSL reported at the time.\n\nAround Aug. 24, 2021, Petito and Laundrie left Salt Lake City for Grand Teton National Park, and this was also the last time Schmidt spoke to her daughter on FaceTime, her parents told KSL.\n\nSchmidt said she received the last text from her daughter Aug. 30, 2021.\n\n\"I don’t know, again, if that was her texting me or not,\" Schmidt said to KSL.\n\nPetito’s last post on Instagram was shared Aug. 25, 2021, and no location was specified.\n\nWhat happened at the police stop in Moab?\n\nPolice responded to a physical altercation between Petito and Laundrie on Aug. 12, 2021, according to a report by the Moab City Police Department that was released Sept. 15, 2021, NBC News reported at the time. The couple and a witness spoke to an officer responding to the domestic violence call near a grocery store in Moab, Utah, police said.\n\nIn September 2021, Utah's Grand County Sheriff’s Office \"released 911 audio from a witness who said he saw a man slap a female and then saw a white Ford Transit van bearing a Florida license plate drive away,\" NBC News reported, adding that \"the 911 call led Moab police to stop the van.\"\n\nPolice released bodycam footage from a police stop involving Petito and Laundrie in Moab, Utah, that occurred just weeks before her disappearance. TODAY\n\nA second officer wrote that the couple's van swerved and hit a curb before stopping after the officer turned on the police lights to pull them over, according to the police report obtained by NBC News.\n\nThe report also stated the responding officer wrote that Petito slapped Laundrie after an argument, NBC News reported.\n\n“The male tried to create distance by telling Gabbie to take a walk to calm down, she didn’t want to be separated from the male, and began slapping him,\" the responding officer wrote in the report, according to NBC News. \"He grabbed her face and pushed her back as she pressed upon him and the van.”\n\nThe couple then asked for no charges to be filed, according to the report obtained by NBC News.\n\n“No one reported that the male struck the female, both the male and the female reported they are in love and engaged and to be married and desperately didn’t wish to see anyone charged with a crime,” according to the report NBC News obtained. “There were no significant injures reported and both agreed that Gabbie suffers from serious anxiety.”\n\nThe four or five months that Petito and Laundrie spent traveling together had sparked tension, the police report said.\n\n“The time spent created emotional strain between them and increased the number of arguments,” the report said, according to NBC News.\n\nIn lieu of police making a case against Petito for domestic assault, the couple separated for a night, the report said, NBC News reported. Petito was given the van, while Laundrie was taken to a hotel, police said in the report, according to NBC News. No charges were filed.\n\nAn independent review released in January 2022 that was conducted by Capt. Brandon Ratcliffe of Utah's Price City Police Department found that the officers who responded in Moab misclassified the incident and lacked details, NBC News reported.\n\nAn officer for the Moab police wrote in the report that the incident was “more accurately categorized as a mental/emotional health ‘break’ than a domestic assault.” However, the independent review states that “officers failed to cite Ms. Petito for domestic violence.”\n\nPolice did not get a statement from the 911 caller who reported “the gentleman slapping the girl,” the independent report said.\n\nThe city of Moab said in a statement that the officers \"made several unintentional mistakes\" and that it intended to follow the report’s recommendations, which included improved trainings and reviews of overall policy and software.\n\nThe police report of the incident was made public weeks after Petito had last been seen and days after Petito's mother reported her missing.\n\nPolice then released bodycam footage on Sept. 16, 2021, that showed Laundrie and Petito talking to an officer after getting pulled over in Moab, NBC News reported after obtaining the footage. Petito could be seen wiping away tears.\n\n“We’ve just been fighting this morning,” Petito said to the officer. “Some personal issues.”\n\n“It was a long day. We were camping yesterday,\" Laundrie said.\n\nIn August 2022, Petito's family announced a wrongful death lawsuit against police in Moab seeking $50 million in damages, NBC News reported. The family's lawyers said the Moab police weren't properly trained to detect signs of domestic abuse or they would have known “Gabby was a victim of intimate partner violence” and needed “immediate protection,” NBC News reported. At the time, the Moab City Police Department did not immediately respond to NBC's request for comment, and a Moab representative said it does not comment on pending litigation, according to NBC News.\n\nThe lawsuit was dismissed by a Utah judge in November 2024, according to The Associated Press.\n\nWhat happened to Gabby Petito?\n\nA body that was later determined to be Petito was found in the Spread Creek Dispersed Camping Area in Bridger-Teton National Forest in Wyoming on Sept. 19, 2021, NBC News confirmed with authorities at the time.\n\nA Wyoming coroner ruled her death to be a homicide by strangulation, according to his comments in a video shared by NBC affiliate WNBC in October 2021.\n\nGabby Petito and Brian Laundrie in \"American Murder: Gabby Petito.\" Netflix\n\nWhat happened to Brian Laundrie?\n\nPolice said Laundrie returned to North Port, Florida, on Sept. 1, 2021, without Petito, NBC News reported that same month. The van the two had been driving across the country was recovered at Petito's Florida home and processed for evidence with help from the FBI, the North Port Police Department said in a statement, according to NBC News.\n\nOn Sept. 15, 2021, North Port, Florida, police confirmed Laundrie was a person of interest after Petito's family reported her missing, according to NBC News. Laundrie's family attorney acknowledged Laundrie had been named as a person of interest by police in a statement obtained by NBC News and that Laundrie would \"continue to remain silent on the advice of counsel.\"\n\nLaundrie's family attorney then told NBC affiliate WFLA via text message that the Laundries believed their son left home Sept. 13 to go hiking, after previously telling police he left home Sept. 14 when they reported him missing.\n\nAuthorities repeatedly searched the 25,000-acre Carlton Reserve near Sarasota, Florida, trying to find Laundrie, according to the North Port Police Department, NBC News reported.\n\nHuman remains were found in the Carlton Reserve along with a backpack and notebook belonging to Laundrie, an FBI official told reporters Oct. 20, 2021, according to NBC News. A day later, the FBI confirmed the remains were Laundrie's after a review of dental records, WNBC reported.\n\nLaundrie died by suicide from a gunshot wound to the head, an attorney for Laundrie’s family said in November 2021, according to NBC News.\n\nHe also left behind writings showing his “responsibility” for Petito's death, the FBI announced in January 2022, NBC News reported.\n\n“A review of the notebook revealed written statements by Mr. Laundrie claiming responsibility for Ms. Petito’s death,” an FBI statement said, according to NBC News.\n\nWhy did Petito’s parents sue Laundrie’s parents?\n\nPetito's family filed a civil lawsuit against Laundrie's parents in March 2022 that accused Christopher and Roberta Laundrie of interfering with the search for their murdered daughter, according to the lawsuit, which NBC News reported on at the time.\n\nAttorneys for the family argued that Laundrie's parents issued a statement on Sept. 14, 2021, supporting a search for Petito \"with full knowledge that Gabrielle Petito had been murdered by their son,” the complaint said, according to NBC News.\n\nLaundrie's parents “knew of the mental suffering and anguish” Petito's family was experiencing but refused to disclose information about her whereabouts. In doing so, they allegedly “acted with malice or great indifference,” the lawsuit said, NBC News reported.\n\nThe lawyer for the Laundries denied the allegations in the lawsuit filed in Florida's Sarasota County, which sought at least $30,000 in damages, according to NBC News.\n\nJim Schmidt and Petito's mother, Nichole Schmidt, are interviewed in \"American Murder: Gabby Petito.\" Netflix\n\nPetito's parents, Laundrie's parents, and attorney Steven Bertolino, who represented the Laundrie family, reached a \"confidential resolution\" in the case in February 2024 to which \"all parties reluctantly agreed in order to avoid further legal expenses and prolonged personal conflict,\" according to a joint statement by Petito's parents that was shared with NBC News.\n\nPetito's family also filed a separate wrongful death lawsuit in Florida against the estate of Brian Laundrie. The lawsuit was resolved when the judge ruled for Petito's mother, the administrator of her daughter's estate, to receive $3 million in November 2022, according to court documents obtained by NBC News.\n\n“The Petito family lost their daughter, and they were also denied the opportunity to confront her killer. No amount of money is sufficient to compensate the Petito family for the loss of their daughter, Gabby, at the hands of Brian Laundrie,” Patrick Reilly, an attorney for Petito’s family, said in a statement obtained by NBC News.\n\nReilly said any money from the $3 million settlement would be going to the Gabby Petito Foundation, which supports organizations that help victims of domestic violence and assist in locating missing persons.\n\nThis story first appeared on TODAY.com.

I didn’t come here for a title,” Romero said. “But it has been the absolute honor of my life to hold this title of U.S. Attorney. The work we’ve done these last years — scores of violent offenders and child predators taken off the street, fraudsters who preyed on investors and the elderly locked up, drug dealers and dirty doctors who poisoned our communities brought to justice, civil rights violations brought to light, and much more — all of it has made the Eastern District of Pennsylvania safer, stronger, and more just.”\n\nDuring her time as U.S. Attorney, Romero doubled the size of the EDPA’s Violent Crime Unit and focused on taking illegal guns off the street and dismantling gangs and drug trafficking organizations. Her office also prosecuted financial fraud and public corruption cases.\n\n“I’m extraordinarily proud, too, of our outreach efforts,” Romero said. “My team and I have gone out and met the people of this District where they are. It’s helped build trust in the community and that isn’t just something, it’s everything. I know that all of my colleagues here, no matter their role, will carry on this Office’s important work, on behalf of the people of southeastern Pennsylvania.”\n\nRomero did not reveal the reason for ending her tenure. Her announcement comes amid news that the Trump administration is preparing to fire hundreds of high-level Department of Homeland Security employees this week as part of a move to rid the agency of people deemed to be misaligned with the administration’s goals, according to sources with NBC News. The administration also made hundreds of cuts targeting the Federal Emergency Management Agency, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency as part of an effort to reduce the federal workforce.\n\nBloomberg Law also reported that Trump intended to fire around 20 chief prosecutors across the country, including in Philadelphia.",

        "fullContent": "Donald Trump is the president, but billionaire Elon Musk is the focus for thousands of Democratic activists launching a protest campaign this week to fight the Trump administration's push to gut federal health, education and human services agencies.\n\nHundreds of protests are scheduled outside congressional offices and Tesla dealerships, with organizers hoping to send a pointed message to members of Congress who are on recess this week.\n\nThe backlash still hasn't approached the intensity of protests during and after Trump's first inauguration eight years ago. But a loose coalition of Democrats and progressives is coalescing around Musk's rise as Trump's top lieutenant and his purge of the federal bureaucracy.\n\n“He’s a major weak link in the MAGA coalition,” Ezra Levin, co-founder of the progressive group Indivisible, said of Musk. “I can’t think of something that polls worse than the richest man in the world is coming after your Social Security check or your Meals on Wheels or your Head Start.”\n\nGet top local stories in Philly delivered to you every morning. Sign up for NBC Philadelphia's News Headlines newsletter.\n\nIndivisible, which claims more than 1,300 local chapters nationwide, is encouraging members to protest at the offices of their members of Congress, regardless of political party. The group also offered a step-by-step guide for protesting at dealerships for Tesla, Musk's electric vehicle company.\n\nThe memo encourages protesters to stay on sidewalks and public spaces and to avoid any actions that might directly interfere with business operations, such as blocking entrances or trespassing on private property. It also calls for Tesla protesters to stay on message: “This is about Musk’s political takeover, not Tesla, SpaceX, or X as companies.”\n\nVermont Sen. Bernie Sanders is launching what he’s calling “a national tour to fight oligarchy” with stops in working-class districts of Iowa and Nebraska this week.\n\nDemocratic National Committee Chair Ken Martin will hit the road for the first time as party leader as well. The newly elected DNC chair will travel to Pennsylvania, Texas, Illinois, Wisconsin and Missouri in the coming days to meet with local Democratic officials and labor leaders, spokesperson Hannah Muldavin said.\n\nLike the protesters, Martin is expected to seize on Musk’s role. During a meeting with labor leaders in Pittsburgh, for example, he plans to highlight Musk’s recent focus on the Department of Labor, which could put “the integrity of data like the unemployment rate and inflation rate at risk, which is important for a stable U.S. economy and, by extension, working people,” Muldavin said.\n\nAware of the intense displeasure from their party’s base, many House Democrats plan to be proactive.\n\nThe House Democratic Policy and Communications Committee issued a memo ahead of the recess instructing Democrats to embrace “nine days of visibility” and said it was essential for members to host one town hall, in-person or via telephone, and at least one community event that highlights the \"devastating impacts” of Trump and Musk’s actions.\n\nThe wave of protests comes at a critical moment as fractured Democrats struggle to stop the Republican president’s purge of the federal bureaucracy, which features thousands of layoffs inside departments focused on public health, education, veterans affairs and human services, among others.\n\nFirings in recent days at the Department of Veterans Affairs include researchers working on cancer treatment, opioid addiction, prosthetics and burn pit exposure, according to U.S. Sen. Patty Murray, a Democrat from Washington state. The cuts also include more than 5,000 employees at the Department of Health and Human Services and roughly one-tenth of the workforce at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nIn some cases, Musk’s team is trying — with Trump's blessing but without congressional approval — to shutter entire agencies, including the U.S. Agency for International Development, the Department of Education and the U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.\n\nTrump has defended the cuts as necessary to eliminate waste and fraud. And he has praised Musk’s work with his Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, saying it has found “shocking” evidence of wasteful spending. He signed an executive order expanding Musk’s influence.\n\nMusk, meanwhile, has defended the swift and extensive cuts he’s pushing across the federal government while acknowledging there have been mistakes.\n\nDemocrats in Congress condemn the moves as dangerous, but without control of either chamber of Congress, there is little they can do to stop the Trump administration aside from turning to the courts. Still, three of the nation's largest progressive groups — Indivisible, MoveOn and the Working Families Party — are coordinating this week's protests to send a clear message to elected officials in both major political parties that they must do more.\n\nStill, Democratic members of Congress may face their own voters' fury.\n\nMoveOn, which boasts a membership of nearly 10 million, is hosting dozens of rallies outside town halls and congressional offices for those members who do not host public events. The group will focus on “persuadable House Republicans whose votes will be crucial to opposing the Trump-Musk agenda,” according to a preview of its recess week plan. But there will also be rallies targeting House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries and Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer, both of New York, among other Democrats.\n\n“We are seeing a true resurgence in energy opposing what Trump, Musk and Republicans are doing to our country,” MoveOn executive director Rahna Epting said, adding that “people are mad as hell.”\n\nThe Working Families Party is focusing protests in the districts of vulnerable Republicans in states such as California, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. The actions will feature people directly impacted by the Trump administration's cuts, including special education teachers, nurses and Head Start workers, according to Working Families spokesman Ravi Mangla.\n\n“A lot of Republicans,\" Mangla said, “have not have had their feet held to the fire.”",

        "fullContent": "Daughter of slain Delco couple arrested in Maryland; allegedly connected to cultlike group: police\n\nPHILADELPHIA (WPVI) -- The daughter of a slain Delaware County couple was arrested in Maryland over the weekend on trespassing and weapon charges, according to state police.\n\nMichelle Zajko, 33, of Media, Pennsylvania, and Jack Lasota, 34, of Berkeley, Calif., and Daniel Arthur Blank, 26, of Sacramento, Calif., were arrested on Sunday in Frostburg, Maryland.\n\nPolice say Lasota was arrested and charged with trespassing, obstructing & hindering, firearm in vehicle. Zajko was arrested and charged with trespassing, obstructing & hindering, resisting arrest, handgun on person; and Blank was arrested and charged with trespassing, obstructing & hindering.\n\nFurther details on what led to the arrests were not immediately released.\n\nA bail hearing is scheduled for 11 a.m. Tuesday at Allegany District Court.\n\nWho is Ziz?\n\nLasota is the apparent leader of a cultlike group known as the Zizians, according to the Associated Press. Zajko is also reportedly a member of the group.\n\nLaSota moved to the San Francisco Bay area after earning a computer science degree from the University of Alaska Fairbanks in 2013 and interning at NASA, according to a profile on a hiring site for programmers, coders and other freelance workers. NASA officials did not respond to a request to confirm LaSota's internship, but a Jack LaSota is listed on a website about past interns.\n\nIn 2016, she began publishing a dark and rambling blog under the name Ziz, describing her theory that the two hemispheres of the brain could hold separate values and genders and \"often desire to kill each other.\"\n\nLaSota used she/her pronouns, and in her writings says she is a transgender woman. She railed against perceived enemies, including so-called rationalist groups, which operate mostly online and seek to understand human cognition through reason and knowledge. Some are concerned with the potential dangers of artificial intelligence.\n\nThe Zizians have been tied to the killing of U.S. Border Patrol Agent David Maland near the Canadian border in January and five other homicides in Vermont, Pennsylvania and California.\n\nRELATED: A timeline of activities of cultlike group tied to the killing of a Border Patrol agent\n\nJack LaSota, Alexander Leatham, Emma Borhanian, Gwen Danielson, Maximilian Snyder and Teresa Youngblut. They are associates of LaSota, also known as \"Ziz.\" AP Photo\n\nMaland, 44, was killed in a Jan. 20 shootout following a traffic stop in Coventry, Vermont, a small town about 20 miles from the Canadian border. Teresa Youngblut, 21, is accused of opening fire on agents during the traffic stop.\n\nIn this undated and unknown location photo released by the Department of Homeland Security shows Border Patrol Agent David Maland posing with a service dog. Department of Homeland Security via AP\n\nOfficials have offered few details of the cross-country investigation, which broke open after the Jan. 20 shooting death of Maland. Associated Press interviews and a review of court records and online postings tell the story of how a group of young, highly intelligent computer scientists, most of them in their 20s and 30s, met online, shared anarchist beliefs, and became increasingly violent.\n\nMurders in Delaware County\n\nBack on December 31, 2022, Michelle Zajko's parents, Richard and Rita, were both shot in the head inside their Chester Heights home.\n\nNo arrests have been made in the case, but Pennsylvania State Police recently announced the gun used to kill Agent Maland was purchased by a person of interest in the murders of Richard and Rita Zajko.\n\nRichard Zajko and Rita Zajko\n\nPolice identified Michelle Zajko as the couple's daughter after her license was found in the home, officials said. It was revealed in court documents that troopers searched a Vermont home tied to Michelle nearly a week after her parents were killed.\n\nPolice question the Zajkos' daughter at her home in Vermont. A few weeks later, officers briefly take her into custody at a Pennsylvania hotel, but release her without charges. LaSota, staying at the same hotel, is arrested and charged with obstructing the homicide investigation and disorderly conduct, according to the Associated Press.\n\nREAD MORE: Troopers searched Vermont home in connection with Delco murders: Court docs\n\nDuring a \"voluntary interview,\" authorities say Michelle Zajko admitted to owning a firearm -- a Smith and Wesson \"M &P\" model.\n\nAccording to sale records, the gun was purchased on February 3, 2022, at Green Mountain Sporting Goods in Vermont by Michelle Zajko. Authorities allege the ammo allegedly purchased by Michelle Zajko is the same manufacture and type as the spent casings that were recovered at the scene of the Delaware County murders.\n\nThe search warrant was for the Smith and Wesson handgun and ammunition, but the court filings only state three cartridges of 9mm ammo were recovered.\n\nTies to California\n\nThe shootings in Delaware County and Vermont seem to have growing connections to another killing in California.\n\nU.S. Attorney Michael Drescher previously said in a court filing the Border Patrol shooting is also linked to a murder in California but she hasn't provided further details.\n\nLaSota is also facing charges of obstructing law enforcement and disorderly conduct in Pennsylvania. Authorities won't say whether those charges are related to the Zajko deaths, but court records show that police were searching for a gun used in two killings when they arrested LaSota 12 days later at a hotel about 10 miles from the scene of the killings.\n\nThough authorities have not publicly identified the person who bought the gun used in the Vermont murder, the VTDigger news investigative online site reported that federal authorities issued an alert to firearms dealers seeking information about purchases made by Michelle Zajko and described her as a person of interest in the Vermont shooting.\n\nAccording to a public records database, a Michelle Zajko was registered to vote in 2016 at the same home address in Pennsylvania as Richard and Rita Zajko. In 2021, a Michelle Zajko bought a half-acre piece of property in Derby, Vermont, a few miles from the Canadian border. According to town records, the land is undeveloped.\n\nMichelle Zajko has not been charged with either of the shooting incidents.\n\nTies to North Carolina\n\nMembers of the group allegedly live in North Carolina which brought the investigation to the Tar Heel state. Dozens of FBI agents searched a wooded area off 150501 near Chapel Hill on Wednesday, Feb. 5. Our sister staton WTVD reached out the agency about the search but got little information.\n\nThe FBI, however, did say they were conducting \"court-authorized investigative activity in connection with an ongoing federal law enforcement investigation.\" They declined to comment further when asked if the loud sounds neighbors heard were related to the investigation.\n\nOne homeowner told WTVD she woke up to the sound of a bang followed by a large federal presence in the neighborhood.\n\n\"Woke me up out of my sleep,\" said Candice Welch. \"It was a real loud bang, about 30 minutes apart. I thought it was just a transformer (blowing), it was loud.\"\n\nShe said they were told the agents were looking for a \"missing item.\"\n\n\"They were looking for a missing item, that's all they told us. We knew it had to be something important, something very serious because of the fact that it was the FBI, along with the sheriff's deputies, and unmarked cars. There was a little bit of everything out here.\"\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.\n\n",

They had no warning,\" said Mark Cochran, president of the American Federation of Government Employees Council 270, which is the council of unions representing National Parks employees along the East Coast.\n\nCochran says employees at several parks received identical letters. They were all directed to people in their first year of employment, which is known as the \"probationary\" period.\n\nSEE ALSO: IRS will lay off thousands of probationary workers in the middle of tax season\n\n\n\n\"They claim employees' job performance didn't meet the standard that was required for their job description, and that excuse is absolutely ridiculous,\" he said.\n\n\"Oh, that makes me extremely sad. A lot of the stuff that's going on right now makes me extremely angry and sad,\" said Kathy Wilson, of Warrington, as she toured Independence Mall with her family.\n\nThere's now a federal complaint on behalf of civil servants across nine agencies. The group representing the terminated employees released a statement that said in part, \"The Trump administration is seeking to undermine that value by purging non-partisan career civil servants and prioritizing partisan loyalists.\"\n\n\"Clearly this is all about partisan politics,\" said Cochran.\n\nAt Independence Mall, the layoffs mean an already short-staffed operation will get even shorter.\n\n\"Their programs for educational groups are going to be limited,\" said Cochran of parks like Independence Mall and Gettysburg National Park where he works. \"Trash won't be collected as thoroughly as usual.\"\n\n\"I think the layoffs are crazy. It's a little bit ridiculous,\" said Paul Suh of New York City as he toured Independence Mall with his family.\n\nVisitors and National Park employees are both worried about the impact of cutbacks at some of the nation's most treasured sites.\n\nOn Monday morning, we learned that a federal judge seems unlikely to block the layoffs already ordered by Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency. The judge's final decision should come within a day.\n\nMeantime, unions representing National Park Workers are considering legal action.",

        "fullContent": "Best gaming laptops from MSI, Acer and more\n\nAs a participant in multiple affiliate marketing programs, Localish will earn a commission for certain purchases. See full disclaimer below*\n\nIf you're a casual gamer you might not think you need a gaming laptop, but having one can be great for competitive gamers, streamers or anyone who spends time playing cooperatively with their friends daily. Below, you'll find the best gaming laptops at every price point, plus the features you might want to keep in mind before shopping for one.\n\nGaming laptops buying guide:\n\nScreen size and resolution: You might want a larger screen size on your gaming laptop if you're dealing with games with a lot of moving parts. That said, a larger screen size usually commands a higher price point. Below, we've highlighted gaming laptops with screen sizes of 14 and 16-inch. The resolution states how clear your picture will be. A higher resolution is preferred for competitive gamers. The below laptops have at least a Full HD resolution, but we've also included options for 4K (four times the clarity of a physical HD laptop).\n\nOperating System: An OS usually handles all the application programs on your computer, including how the RAM is managed. Windows OS 11 is the best for gaming, but you can also use Atlast OS which optimizes system performance and lowers latency.\n\nRAM: You'll want at least 16 GB of RAM on your gaming laptop. This is required to run any AAA titles (games produced by major publishers) at their native resolutions and without lags. If you're looking to stream while gaming, go higher with a 32 GB laptop.\n\nStorage: Ideally you'll want a laptop with at least 512 GB of storage. This sounds like a lot, but games are usually at least 100 GB, so with a 512 GB laptop you'll be able to store 4-5 games at a time. You can also purchase additional SSDs if you need a higher amount of storage in the short term.\n\nBest gaming laptops\n\nAmazon MSI Cyborg 14 $1099 Shop now\n\nI tested this laptop for about a month and was impressed by both its performance and design. It's surprisingly lightweight, stays cool to the touch while gaming, and has a tactile, responsive keyboard for quick feedback. There is also up to 1 TB of storage available, and the 14-inch display FHD+ display is just big and bright enough to keep track of all your in-game characters. Its fan and in-built cooling system is not that noisy either and the backlit keyboard is great for gaming after hours. I honestly love this piece of gaming equipment and think it's a great laptop for beginner and seasoned gamers alike.\n\nBest Buy ASUS - ROG Zephyrus G14 $1599 Shop now\n\nThis is a great laptop for beginners and expert gamers alike. It comes with 16 GB of RAM, a Full HD resolution, and a Windows 11 operating system for quick gameplay with no lag time. It also boasts rapid response times (the lower the response time, the quicker your laptop is) and has 1TB of in-built storage which means it's able to store a decent amount of games. It offers intelligent cooling which should also keep this pick from quickly heating up, and six speakers equipped with Domby Atmos, allowing you to use it without a pair of good-quality gaming headphones. You'll also get three months of Xbox game pass included which will give you access to 100s of free games - including new titles.\n\nAmazon Razer Blade 14 (2024) $2699.99 Shop now\n\nRazer just announced the new and thinner Razer Blade 16 at CES, but you'll have to wait for a little before you can shop that pick. In fact, most Razer laptops are currently out of stock at major retailers. That said, you can currently purchase the Razer Blade 14 - last year's release. It has 32 GB of RAM making it a strong pick, and it also carries a whole 1TB of storage. Plus, it has a Windows 11 operating system similar to some of the other picks on this list. Battery life lasts eight hours (but keep in mind that gaming laptops are notorious for fast-depleting batteries due to how heavy-duty most AAA titles are). It is also one of the lightest Razer laptops around, making it a great buy for those always on the go.\n\nAmazon HP Omen 16 $1199 Shop now\n\nHP's 2023 Omen is still a top contender. For starters, it has a wide, 16.1-inch Full HD display with an anti-glare screen so you can game wherever you are. This option also has 1 TB of storage (but the brand offers options up to 4 TB if you need it) and like the other picks on our list, a fully customizable RGB backlit keyboard and built-in speakers. It weighs around five pounds and also comes with multiple USB port options. Plus, since it has 32GB of RAM it can handle most games with ease - you can also customize it to up to 64 GB of RAM.\n\n* By clicking on the featured links, visitors will leave this site and be directed to third-party e-commerce sites that operate under different terms and privacy policies.

        "fullContent": "Police arrest apparent leader of cultlike 'Zizian' group linked to multiple killings in the US\n\nThe apparent leader of a cultlike group known as the Zizians has been arrested in Maryland along with another member of the group, Maryland State Police said Monday.\n\nJack Lasota, 34, was arrested Sunday along with Michelle Zajko, 33, of Media, Pennsylvania. They face multiple charges including trespassing, obstructing and hindering and possession of a handgun in the vehicle.\n\nThe video featured is from a related report.\n\nFurther details on what led to the arrests were not immediately released.\n\nA bail hearing for the two is scheduled for 11 a.m. Tuesday at Allegany District Court.\n\nThe Zizians have been tied to the killing of U.S. Border Patrol Agent David Maland near the Canadian border in January and five other homicides in Vermont, Pennsylvania and California.\n\nIn this undated and unknown location photo released by the Department of Homeland Security shows Border Patrol Agent David Maland posing with a service dog. Department of Homeland Security via AP\n\nMaland, 44, was killed in a Jan. 20 shootout following a traffic stop in Coventry, Vermont, a small town about 20 miles (32 kilometers) from the Canadian border.\n\nBack on December 31, 2022, Zajko's parents, Richard and Rita, were both shot in the head inside their Chester Heights, Pennsylvania, home.\n\nRichard Zajko and Rita Zajko\n\nPolice question the Zajkos' daughter at her home in Vermont in January 2023. A few weeks later, officers briefly take her into custody at a Pennsylvania hotel, but release her without charges. LaSota, staying at the same hotel, is arrested and charged with obstructing the homicide investigation and disorderly conduct, according to the Associated Press.\n\nNo arrests have been made in the case, but Pennsylvania State Police recently announced the gun used to kill Agent Maland was purchased by a person of interest in the murders of Richard and Rita Zajko.\n\nThe shootings in Delaware County and Vermont seem to have growing connections to another killing in California.\n\nOfficials have offered few details of the cross-country investigation, which broke open after the Jan. 20 shooting death of Maland. Associated Press interviews and a review of court records and online postings tell the story of how a group of young, highly intelligent computer scientists, most of them in their 20s and 30s, met online, shared anarchist beliefs, and became increasingly violent.\n\nTheir goals aren't clear, but online writings span topics from radical veganism and gender identity to artificial intelligence.\n\nWho is Ziz?\n\nAt the middle of it all is \"Ziz,\" who appears to be the leader of the strange group members who called themselves \"Zizians.\" She has been seen near multiple crime scenes and has connections to various suspects.\n\nJack LaSota, Alexander Leatham, Emma Borhanian, Gwen Danielson, Maximilian Snyder and Teresa Youngblut. They are associates of LaSota, also known as \"Ziz.\" AP Photo\n\nin 2016, LaSota began publishing a dark and sometimes violent blog under the name Ziz and, in one section, described her theory that the two hemispheres of the brain could hold separate values and genders and \"often desire to kill each other.\"\n\nJack LaSota moved to the San Francisco Bay area after earning a computer science degree from the University of Alaska Fairbanks in 2013 and interning at NASA, according to a profile on a hiring site for programmers, coders and other freelance workers. NASA officials did not respond to a request to confirm LaSota's internship, but a Jack LaSota is listed on a website about past interns.\n\nLaSota, who used she/her pronouns, and in her writings says she is a transgender woman, railed against perceived enemies, including so-called rationalist groups, which operate mostly online and seek to understand human cognition through reason and knowledge. Some are concerned with the potential dangers of artificial intelligence.\n\nLaSota, 34, has not responded to multiple Associated Press emails in recent weeks, and her attorney Daniel McGarrigle declined to comment when asked whether she is connected to any of the deaths. Before her weekend arrest, she missed court appearances in two states, and bench warrants have been issued for her arrest.\n\nReached on Monday, McGarrigle would only confirm that he has represented LaSota and wouldn't confirm her arrest or any details of the latest case.\n\nWPVI and The Associated Press contributed to this report.",

The Delaware River Port Authority (DRPA) will be coordinating bridge closures.\n\nThe ship's new owners say they have completed the necessary safety requirements to move the SS United States.\n\nOnce it leaves Philadelphia, it will head toward Mobile, Alabama, where it will prepped to be sunk off Florida's panhandle.\n\nThe journey along the eastern seaboard is expected to take roughly two weeks.\n\nYou will be able to track the ship's journey on the Destin-Fort Walton Beach website, once it starts moving.\n\nIn fall 2024, Florida's Okaloosa County bought the derelict ship after approving a $10.1 million plan to relocate the ocean liner, sink it and build a $1 million seaside museum chronicling the cruise liner's history.\n\nRELATED: Here's what is delaying the SS United States from leaving Philadelphia\n\nOkaloosa County\n\nThe ship was originally supposed to leave Philadelphia in November but was delayed due to \"logistical details.\" There was also a tropical disturbance in the Gulf.\n\nThen, earlier this month, plans were in place again to move the ship, but that was halted due to a pier transition delay.\n\nRELATED: Ship sinking expert explains how the SS United States will be prepped for its underwater grave\n\nThe interior of \"America's Flagship\" will need to be scrapped and rid of any toxins or asbestos before it can be sent to its underwater grave.\n\nPreparing the vessel for deployment is expected to take about a year.\n\nWATCH: Action News archive - Inside the SS United States\n\nAction News takes a walk through the stripped-down SS United States\n\nOnce the clean-up is finished, the vessel will then be towed back out to the gulf, where it will travel about 20 miles southeast to just off the shores of Destin-Fort Walton for it to be sunk.\n\nThe ship's final home will be under about 180 feet (55 meters) of water 20 miles (32 kilometers) off the coast of Destin, Florida.\n\nOkaloosa County hopes the ship will become a destination for scuba divers and attract fish and other wildlife as a reef. It won't be the only shipwreck habitat they have.\n\nThe ship found its home on Pier 82 in South Philadelphia in 1996 after a nonprofit called the SS United States Conservancy saved it from the scrapyard in 2011. However, its plans to rehabilitate the ship never came to fruition.\n\nRELATED: Action News archives: We take a look back at when the SS United States arrived in Philadelphia\n\nIn the mid-90s, the fastest ship in the world parked at a Philadelphia pier at rate of $1,000 a week.\n\nFlorida officials say they intend to \"preserve the SS Unites States' storied history and the memories she has created for so many people over the years.\"\n\nChristened in 1952, the SS United States was once considered a beacon of American engineering, doubling as a military vessel that could carry thousands of troops. On its maiden voyage in 1952, it shattered the transatlantic speed record in both directions, when it reached an average speed of 36 knots, or just over 41 mph (66 kph).\n\nOn that voyage, the ship crossed the Atlantic in three days, 10 hours and 40 minutes, besting the RMS Queen Mary's time by 10 hours. To this day, the SS United States holds the transatlantic speed record for an ocean liner.\n\nIt became a reserve ship in 1969 and later bounced to various private owners who hoped to redevelop it but eventually found their plans to be too expensive or poorly timed.",

Instead, it went viral.\n\n\"I was getting messages like, 'Hey, you've reached France, Germany, Brazil, Africa, Canada - everywhere!\" he said.\n\nHe's already received thousands of direct messages, some sending words of encouragement and praising him for putting himself out there, and others asking him out on a date.\n\nHe spent over $1,000 to put up the billboard for one month, which turned into two due to the billboard's lackluster location.\n\nWhile Dave is still single, he says he hasn't given up hope and is still working on finding love.\n\nHis main takeaway from this experience? Just be yourself.\n\n\"I just kind of decided to stay true to myself, and that's what people really latched on to,\" he says. \"It was a good confidence boost.\"\n\nMostly, he just liked the idea of being on a billboard and thought it would be funny.

The plane was upside down, obviously, some people were kind of hanging and needed some help being helped down.\"\n\nThe flight crew can be seen standing on the ceiling helping passengers scramble to escape in the video.\n\n\"The one minute you're landing and kind of waiting to see your friends and your people and the next minute you're physically upside down and just really turned around,\" Pete Carlson, a passenger on the plane, told ABC News. \"It sounded, I mean, it was just cement and metal, you know.\"\n\nThe Delta regional jet, a CRJ 900 aircraft operated by Endeavor Air, departed from Minneapolis on Monday afternoon, heading to Toronto with 76 passengers and four crew landing just after 2 p.m. local time.\n\n\"All of a sudden the fire trucks and helicopters, you know, pushed out on a trolley and thought there was something wrong,\" said Ron James, an eyewitness who saw the smoke right before he was supposed to board his flight at a nearby terminal. \"Then we were going to get on the plane and they said no youre not going anywhere.\"\n\nAt least 18 passengers were taken to hospitals, airport officials said in an update Monday evening.\n\nPeel Regional Paramedic Services said none of the injuries were considered to be life-threatening.\n\nThree people suffered critical injuries -- one child, a man in his 60s and a woman in her 40s -- according to Ornge, which provides medical transport.

It's very early on,\" said Todd Aitken, fire chief at Toronto Pearson International Airport. \"It's really important that we do not speculate. What we can say is the runway was dry and there was no crosswind conditions.\"",

        "fullContent": "The William Kenzo Nakamura United States Courthouse is seen during a hearing in the multi-state lawsuit over President Trump’s order ending all federal funding or support for gender-affirming care for people younger than 19, outside a courthouse in Seattle, Washington, U.S., February 14, 2025.\n\nSign up for our Gay City News email newsletter to get news, updates, and local insights delivered straight to your inbox!\n\nFederal district judges on the east and west coasts presiding over simultaneous litigation brought by different parties have issued temporary restraining orders blocking enforcement of President Trump’s executive orders that sought to coerce healthcare providers from performing gender-affirming care for minors.\n\nJudge Lauren King of the US District Court in Seattle and Judge Brendan Hurson of the US District Court in Baltimore came to the same conclusion: The plaintiffs in both cases are likely to be able to prove that President Trump does not have the authority to unilaterally change federal law by imposing new restrictions on the grants and other federal money that health care institutions rely upon for their operations, which is Trump’s method for making gender-affirming care unavailable.\n\nThe East Coast case, PFLAG v. Trump, was brought by that organization and six transgender youths, all of whom are at some stage of accessing gender-affirming care but were notified by their provider that the care would be discontinued because of Trump’s executive order, since their provider was threatened with a cut-off of federal funds.\n\nThe West Coat case, State of Washington v. Trump, was brought jointly by the states of Washington, Minnesota, Oregon and Alabama and three physicians who perform gender affirming care. In each of the states there are public health care institutions that are threatened with loss of federal grants if gender-affirming care is provided in their facilities.\n\nThe central theme of both cases is that the president does not have the authority to place new conditions on the receipt of federal funding that were not legislated by Congress. Under the separation of powers set up in the Constitution, Congress makes the laws by passing statutes, the president swears to see that they are faithfully executed, and it is up to the courts to interpret and apply the laws in actual cases. Some borderlines between making laws, interpreting them, and enforcing them have become blurred by the emergence of administrative agencies and executive branch departments that are authorized to issue rules, guidelines, and regulations, but both Judge King and Judge Hurson show in their opinions that the president’s role remains limited under the separation of powers.\n\nThe president does not have the power to dictate healthcare policy to the states, and Congress’s own authority regarding healthcare is also limited because the regulation of healthcare is among the police powers generally reserved to the states under the 10th Amendment of the Constitution, which states: “The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.” This provision was particularly important for the west coast case, where four states are plaintiffs.\n\nIn both of these cases, the Justice Department, representing Trump and the various federal departments who are sued because they have grants and contracts with health care institutions, argued that the lawsuits are premature, that no action has been taken yet to suspend federal payments, and that a memo sent out by the Health Resources & Services Administration of the Department of Health and Human Services directing healthcare institutions that no federal money can be used to “promote gender ideology” (which is Trump’s term, borrowed from his good buddy Vladimir Putin) by providing gender-affirming care to minors, and that any institution providing such care stands to lose their grants or federal contracts, was revoked about a week after it was sent out. But the executive order has not been revoked by Trump and can be activated at any time in the absence of these court orders.\n\nThe judges noted that the revocation of that memo did not make the situation any less urgent, since the executive order specifies the cut-off of federal funding for gender-affirming care is “immediate,” and both judges concluded that the plaintiffs would suffer irreparable injuries if all federal money was withdrawn.\n\nJudge King in Seattle wrote the longer and more detailed opinion. In addition to violating the separation of powers, part of the basic structure of the Constitution, Trump’s order cited 18 U.S.C. Section 116, a criminal statute, as a source of authority. This is a statute that was enacted to deal with the issue of genital mutilation of women and imposes criminal penalties. The judge wrote that “to the extent the executive order purports to expand the scope of criminalized conduct in another federal statute – 18 U.S.C. section 116 – this, too, trespasses beyond the president’s powers under the Constitution.”\n\nShe also found a potential violation of the Fifth Amendment’s equal protection requirement by treating people differently “based on sex or transgender status,” which she opined could only be done “if the differential treatment (1) serves important governmental objectives and (2) is substantially related to the achievement of those objectives,” the “heightened scrutiny” standard of judicial review. The district court in Seattle is bound by rulings of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, which has held in past cases that discrimination based on transgender status is subject to the heightened scrutiny test, and she pointed out various ways that Trump’s announced directives are likely to be struck down under this test.\n\n“The record indicates that none of the funds received by the plaintiff states’ medical institutions have a congressionally authorized condition requiring them to refrain from the provision of gender-affirming care,” wrote Judge King. “And defendants have not shown that Congress has delegated authority to the president to condition federal research grants on compliance with his policy agenda. The president’s power is thus ‘at its lowest ebb.’ Despite this, President Trump’s executive order purports to do something not even Congress is permitted to do: ‘surprise states with post acceptance . . . conditions’ on federal funds, and ‘impose conditions on federal grants that are unrelated to the federal interest in particular national projects and programs.’”\n\nShe characterized the order as “an end-run around the separation of powers,” and, quoting from a Supreme Court decision, wrote that “to hold that the president has ‘the power to switch the Constitution on or off at will’ would ‘permit a striking anomaly in our tripartite system of government,’ but ‘our basic charter cannot be contracted away like this.’”\n\nJudge King agreed with the plaintiffs’ argument that Trump’s order “appears to serve no interest at all save to communicate official, presidentially directed animus against transgender and gender-diverse people, their medical providers, and their families,” finding not credible that the order is intended to protect children from “regret” about being subjected to gender transition by their parents and doctors.\n\nShe also found that the plaintiff states would likely succeed in their argument that under the 10th Amendment, Trump’s directive to the Attorney General to “review Department of Justice enforcement of Section 116 of title 18, U.S. Code, and prioritize enforcement of protections against female genital mutilation” as part of his campaign against gender-affirming care, is an inappropriate attempt to amend a federal statute to a purpose not authorized by Congress. “The Plaintiff States’ legislatures have the exclusive power under the 10th Amendment to criminalize acts committed within those states that lack a federal nexus,” she wrote. “Plaintiff states have not passed any laws criminalizing Listed Services” in Trump’s Order. Although some other states have imposed criminal penalties on health care providers who provide gender-affirming care to minors, the four states who brought his law suit have not done so, and Trump’s attempt to stretch a federal statute to make this a federal crime violates the rights of those states.\n\nAlthough her opinion ends with a grant of a temporary restraining order, Judge King comments that “the balance of equities and the public interest strongly weigh in favor of entering a preliminary injunction,” and “The Rule of law is secured by a strong public interest that the laws ‘enacted by their representatives are not imperiled by executive fiat.”\n\nNormally, temporary restraining orders have only brief duration while the court determines whether to issue a preliminary injunction, which would block enforcement of the order until the court issues a final decision after a trial or in deciding a motion for summary judgment, but it seems likely, given Trump’s usual approach to adverse judicial rulings, that the government may attempt to appeal these temporary orders. If not, preliminary injunctions are likely to follow shortly.\n\nBoth Judge King and Judge Hurson were appointed by President Joe Biden.",

Howie Roseman was working the day of the parade and signed 13 players to reserves/futures deals. The NFL combine is at the end of this month, and Free Agency is shortly after that. The Eagles are playing catch-up after working into February and need to determine which players they will be keeping or letting go. The stay-o-meter has arrived to help decide!\n\nEagles Offense\n\nFeb 9, 2025; New Orleans, LA, USA; Philadelphia Eagles offensive tackle Mekhi Becton (77) celebrates after winning Super Bowl LIX at Caesars Superdome. Mandatory Credit: Geoff Burke-Imagn Images\n\nMekhi Becton is the only offensive starter not signed for next season, and the front office’s faith in Tyler Steen, coupled with what Becton commands on the open market, will likely determine his stay. The rest of the players listed below are not starters, but they are valuable pieces to the Super Bowl team, and the Eagles could have interest retaining all of them.\n\nMekhi Becton (OL) had a career resurrection in Philadelphia. He can play inside or outside and will garner interest in free agency. He has earned every dollar and deserves to see what he can get, but he also loved his time with the Eagles and could take less to stay. Look at his joy.\n\nStay-o-meter coin toss 50%\n\nhttps://twitter.com/PHLEagleNews/status/1889500722623885730\n\nFred Johnson (OL)has stepped up when needed, and it would be a surprise to see him leave the building. He started six games in 2024 and is a valuable OL on the roster. His future could be tied to what happens with Becton, but they should pay him to return either way. He is a great locker room guy, continues to develop, and is reliable.\n\nStay-o-meter 70%\n\nKenny Gainwell (RB) will see his value to another team but could decide that the grass is not ‘greener’ and return on a 1 year contract. He is a perfect fit as the backup and accepts his role. Think Boston Scott.\n\nStay-o-meter 51%\n\nBen VanSumeren (FB LB) is a core special teamer, and he made an impact as a fullback. His development has been impressive. BVS is an exclusive right FA, it would be surprising to see them move away from him.\n\nStay-o-meter 90%\n\nBritain Covey (PR WR) is well-liked and has proven to be a good return man in the punt game. Covey was also showing off his talent as a receiver before being injured.\n\nStay-o-meter 55%\n\nEagles Defense\n\nFootball – NFL – Super Bowl LIX – Philadelphia Eagles v Kansas City Chiefs – Caesars Superdome, New Orleans, Louisiana, United States – February 9, 2025 Philadelphia Eagles’ Zack Baun celebrates with Josh Sweat after intercepting the ball REUTERS/Mike Segar TPX IMAGES OF THE DAY\n\nEight of the Eagles’ eleven defensive starters are under contract for the 2025 season, and those three have been major contributors to the team; two were drafted and developed in Philadelphia, while the other might be one of the greatest free-agent signings in NFL history. (Z. Baun, J. Sweat, & M. Williams)\n\nZack Baun (LB), priority number one, hand selected by Fangio, and seems to believe the Eagles got the best of his abilities\n\n“I’m curious,” he said. “I don’t know what it’s going to look like, honestly. My goal every time is to play the best football that I can. Hopefully it’s here. I love this place, and I really appreciate what they’ve done for my career and my family, and just everything. I got a lot of options to weigh, and a lot of stuff to think about.”\n\nHis meteoric rise to an All-Pro at age 28 is an incredible story, and it appears that both the franchise and Baun know this is a perfect marriage.\n\n“I guess you could say I’ve never felt that sort of stardom. I don’t like the attention, so it’s very different for me. But it’s going to take some adjusting and getting used to because when you bring a Super Bowl to Philly, you’re a legend for life. And it’s just so freaking cool.”\n\nIndeed you are.\n\nStay-o-meter 75%\n\nJosh Sweat (EDGE) didn’t take anything from his locker and indicated that he and the Eagles would like to stay together. I also sense that he was looking forward to seeing what he could make as a free agent. He has hired Drew Rosenhaus as his agent.\n\nStay-o-meter 45%\n\nMilton Williams (DL) wore his agency team hoodie to locker cleanout day, and DTs of his caliber are making 16–20M on the open market, so he is likely gone. The Eagles also have to prepare for Jalen Carter’s extension, which they can do at the end of the 2025 season. Williams made one of the more memorable plays in the Super Bowl with a strip sack of Patrick Mahomes and will be forever a legend in Philadelphia.\n\nStay-o-meter 5%\n\nOren Burks (LB) was a valuable signing as an insurance policy at the linebacker position. He played well late in the season and stepped up just as much after the team lost Nakobe Dean to injury during the wild card round vs the Packers. He should not break the back to return and has proven his worth. I expect him to remain an Eagle and sign a one or two-year contract.\n\nStay-o-meter 75%\n\nIsaiah Rodgers (CB) will be one of the more fascinating scenarios to watch unfold. He played well and could get a nice contract to match. His tenure in Philly could be determined by what the Eagles decide to do with BP Slay. Slay mentioned he would like to play one more season but does not know if the Eagles will be the team to pay him. If he leaves, Rodgers is someone they would likely bring back.\n\nStay-o-meter coin toss 50%\n\nBrandon Graham (DL) will decide to continue playing or sail off into the sunset after his second Lombardi trophy. He has earned the right and trust to make the correct decision. I believe he wants to play and knows he has some juice left in the tank. It would be surprising if he doesn’t ultimately choose to hang them up.\n\nStay-o-meter 10%, likely retires\n\nAvonte Maddox (DB) made a nice PBU in the Super Bowl, and I was happy to see a long-time Eagles player who has had his career derailed by injuries contribute on the biggest stage. He could come back on a minimum deal, but it would be surprising if another team doesn’t offer more this offseason.\n\nStay-o-meter 20%\n\nSpecial Teams:\n\nRick Lovato (LS) should get extended. I never hear his name called for any reason, and as a long snapper, that is a great thing. The Eagles have enjoyed over a decade of excellence from the position transitioning from Jon Dornebos to Rick, and there is no need to stop that now.\n\nStay-o-meter 85%\n\nThe Rest\n\nAug 9, 2024; Baltimore, Maryland, USA; Philadelphia Eagles running back Will Shipley (39) celebrates his first quarter touchdown with tight end C.J.

(aka the Burden of Black Genius),’ is a study of Sly & Family Stone and Black music innovators such as Andre 3000 and D’Angelo.\n\nQuestlove’s ‘Ladies & Gentlemen… 50 Years of SNL Music’ doc features footage of the program’s storied live performances, from the Rolling Stones, David Bowie, Run DMC and more, and can currently be streamed on Peacock. ‘Sly Lives!’ is available for streaming on Hulu.\n\n“When we did ‘Summer of Soul‘, Ahmir and I came from the same starting point — we both knew and loved most of its artists,” says Questlove’s filmmaking partner, Oscar-winning producer Joseph Patel, talking about that 2021 documentary’s list of stars such as Stevie Wonder, Nina Simone, Gladys Knight & the Pips and more.\n\n“With ‘Sly Lives!’, it was Quest who held great importance for Sly Stone,” notes Patel. “That was one of Ahmir’s longtime favorites and one of his most influential artists.”\n\nSly Stone (born Stewart) is a San Francisco psychedelic-era radio DJ turned composer, singer, and musician who revolutionized music with Sly & the Family Stone — a multi-racial, genre-blending band that shattered boundaries between Black and White audiences. With soul-rock-funk-pop crossover hits like ‘Stand!’, ‘Everyday People’, ‘Hot Fun in the Summertime’, and ‘Thank You’, the group left an indelible mark on music history. The latter track, in particular, became a widely sampled staple of 1980s and ‘90s hip-hop, as highlighted in a fast-cut segment of ‘Sly Lives!’ where producers Terry Lewis and Jimmy Jam discuss its influence on Janet Jackson’s ‘Rhythm Nation.’ That same quick-cutting, DJ-like pacing can be found in the first few minutes of ‘Ladies & Gentlemen… 50 Years of SNL Music‘ as Questlove splices and dices what seems like hundreds of live segments — from the B-52s to Olivia Rodriguez — rhythmically, in the blink of an eye.\n\nQuestlove told Billboard magazine that Sly Stone was “essentially” the first Black megastar. “Sly is basically the he embodiment of what Martin Luther King’s ‘I Have a Dream’ speech was about, like this utopian multiracial mix of Black and whites, men and women together.”\n\nPatel goes on to say that he, however, didn’t know Sly’s discography in order, but did know those Family Stone hits, as well as the decline of Sly Stone that followed – the drug addiction, the arrests, the manner in which he missed live concerts and recording dates, and allowed his career to slip away.\n\n“I knew how he tried to win back his fame, that he was a junkie and lived in a camper,” says Patel. “The challenge for me was to become fluent so as to best tell his story and use his life and work as an avatar for this larger idea: the burden of Black genius.”\n\nQuestlove told Deadline that Sly’s undoing at his own hands was “the point of this whole film about self-sabotage. But he wrote the alphabet, and we’re still writing books from that alphabet to this day.”\n\nWhen it comes to the present day, and the ‘Sly’ documentary’s take on the idea of Black genius, Questlove spoke to Black music innovators Vernon Reid, Q-Tip, Chaka Khan, André 3000, and, most particularly D’Angelo — artists whose earliest works broke down barriers of what it means to make Black music, and had issues with how to move forward with the weight of expectation put upon them.\n\n“Can you imagine Sly after having just headlined Woodstock, being on the cover of Rolling Stone, having Black and White America are both looking to you as if you just solved race relations through your music—what pressure that must have been for him?,” asks Patel. “Connecting the stories of Sly and everyone else in the film came down to Ahmir’s own experiences with fame.”",

Ersson got the call-up after being healthy and scratched for the two previous games. Linus Ullmark was not feeling well, which led to Ersson getting his chance to perform on a big platform.\n\nSam Ersson stands out for Team Sweden\n\nErsson made an impressive 32 saves against a strong USA team. The game didn’t start on the right note as Chris Kreider scored for Team USA early on. Luckily for Team Sweden, Gustav Nyquist was able to tie up the game with six minutes remaining in the first frame. The scoring wasn’t done yet as Jesper Bratt was able to give Sweden the lead, which ended up being the final score, 2-1, during the last minute of play in the first.\n\nThis was some of the best hockey Ersson’s played between the pipes. Despite Team USA losing a few players throughout the game, it was a loaded roster, which caused Ersson to shut down. Before the tournament, when speaking with Ersson, he explained the amount of pride he has in being able to represent his country. He took full advantage of the opportunity given to him. On Team USA’s bench, Flyers head coach John Tortorella was serving as an assistant coach.\n\nThe young goalie is finally getting the praise he deserves. He was the Flyers’ backup goalie before taking over the starting goalie role and has faced a lot of criticism not only from fans but also from the national media. It’s been a constant headline that the Flyers have a goalie problem. Despite the never-ending criticism of the netminder job, the Swede stayed mentally strong. When given the opportunity, he flourished. While the Flyers could use a better backup goalie, there is a reason why he does have the job for the orange and black.\n\nThe Flyers return to work on Saturday as they host the Edmonton Oilers, and after Ersson’s outstanding performance, this will give him a confidence boost.\n\nMandatory Credit: John Jones-Imagn Images",

        "fullContent": "A missing poster is displayed on a telephone pole along a closed section of Kensington Avenue as police begin clearing a homeless encampment on May 8, 2024 in Philadelphia.\n\nSign up for our Daily Email newsletter to stay up-to-date on the latest local news throughout Philadelphia.\n\nAfter nearly a decade of almost year-over-year increases in overdose deaths, the tide may finally be turning in Philadelphia.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced in May 2024 an estimated 3% decrease in overdose deaths in the U.S. in 2023 compared with 2022. Shortly after, data from the Philadelphia Department of Public Health showed a similar trend: Fatal overdoses across the city decreased 7% in 2023, from 1,207 to 1,122. The city is expected to release its 2024 data in the spring of 2025.\n\nWhile these declines are notable, the city’s 2023 fatal overdose numbers are three times higher than they were in 2013.\n\nStill, if 2024 numbers confirm the downward trend, it allows a little hope into an otherwise bleak epidemic that is killing more Philadelphians than homicides, car accidents and diabetes combined.\n\nSomething may finally be working. But what?\n\nIf over a decade spent treating and researching substance use disorders has taught me anything, it’s that the overdose epidemic is what researchers and policymakers refer to as a wicked problem. Wicked problems are constantly changing, complex, interconnected knots of other problems with no clear solution.\n\nBut let’s look at what we do know about how overdose deaths in Philadelphia spiked in the first place – and why they may finally be decreasing.\n\nWhy overdose deaths spiked\n\nThe first wave of the overdose epidemic began in the late 1990s and is attributed to overprescription of opioid pain medicines. But the largest acceleration in deaths didn’t occur until after the government and health insurers implemented prescribing controls in the early 2010s. These controls led many people who were no longer able to get prescribed opioids to turn to illicit heroin.\n\nIn a phenomenon known as the “iron law of prohibition,” stricter drug law enforcement led drug-trafficking organizations to shift from heroin toward more powerful synthetic opioids that are easier to produce, conceal and distribute. Gram for gram, pure fentanyl is over 50 times stronger than pure heroin.\n\nBut street-obtained fentanyl has proven to be anything but pure.\n\nLocal drug-testing efforts found as much as a fiftyfold difference in potency between bags of fentanyl that appear identical.\n\nThis unpredictable potency is considered to be the chief contributor to the deadliness of street fentanyl. It’s like cracking a beer and not knowing whether drinking it will get you mildly buzzed or send you to the graveyard.\n\nResearch suggests drug busts, though touted as improving public safety, can lead to more inconsistency and unpredictability in the potency of illicit opioids. An analysis of 14 studies conducted in the U.S. demonstrated a marked increase in fatal overdoses following the supply disruptions that result from drug seizures.\n\nThere’s also some evidence that the heightened economic insecurity and despair caused by the COVID-19 pandemic may have intensified the fatal overdose epidemic.\n\nPotential reasons for decline\n\nJust as economic insecurity was associated with rising deaths, the subsequent economic recovery as the U.S. emerged from the pandemic may have contributed to the 2023 drop in overdose fatalities nationwide.\n\nHowever, the unequal distribution of that recovery seems to track with worsening racial disparities in overdose rates in the late 2010s to early 2020s.\n\nAnother possible explanation for the reduction in overdose deaths is the increasing availability of buprenorphine.\n\nBuprenorphine, an FDA-approved medication for opioid use disorder, reduces withdrawal and cravings for fentanyl. What’s more, it decreases overdose risk by more than 50%.\n\nHowever, efforts to increase access to this medication have stagnated. National prescribing rates for buprenorphine were relatively stable from 2019 to 2023, and the CDC estimates that only a quarter of those who need treatment are getting it. Efforts to make buprenorphine available without a prescription have not yet gained traction.\n\nAccess to and education around naloxone, a lifesaving drug used to reverse opioid overdoses, has also increased, and the drug is increasingly being administered by bystanders. Over 1.3 million doses were distributed in Pennsylvania since 2017. National research suggests these distribution efforts, often spearheaded by local harm-reduction organizations, have led to quicker administration of naloxone. This saves lives while also decreasing reliance on emergency medical services.\n\nFinally, the consequences of a seemingly minor characteristic of fentanyl’s pharmacology might also be reducing the overdose death rate in Philadelphia.\n\nFentanyl’s effects last only a third as long as heroin. This shorter duration led drug traffickers to add the animal tranquilizer xylazine – also called “tranq” – and the veterinary anesthetic medetomidine into Philadelphia’s street drug supply. In 2019, two-thirds of heroin or fentanyl sampled in Philadelphia had xylazine in it. By 2021 all of it did.\n\nThese additives lengthen the duration of the effect, mitigate withdrawal symptoms and possibly reduce the amount of fentanyl needed per dose. Some evidence from animal studies shows that xylazine reduces fentanyl intake by suppressing fentanyl withdrawal, thereby lengthening the time before a person uses again.\n\nWhat’s more, the skin wounds and sedative effects that are associated with xylazine may be motivating some people to avoid using street fentanyl.\n\nWhat’s next for Philadelphia\n\nThe opioid settlement, a multibillion-dollar payment from the pharmaceutical industry to resolve legal actions against them, has led to increased funding in Philadelphia for naloxone and medications such as buprenorphine to treat opioid use disorder.\n\nHowever, in the past year the city eliminated funding for needle exchanges and implemented compulsory treatment strategies, which research suggests often do not reduce drug use or criminal recidividism.\n\nMeanwhile, at the federal level, Republican members of Congress have proposed cuts to Medicaid, the health insurance program for low-income Americans.\n\nWhether new data, when it’s released, will show overdose deaths in Philly have continued to decline or are back on the rise is anybody’s guess. But I do know that harm-reduction advocates, medical providers and communities of people who use drugs will continue to fight this epidemic as if their lives depend on it. For many, it does.\n\nBen Cocchiaro is an Assistant Clinical Professor of Family Medicine and Community Health at Drexel University.",

        "source": "https://metrophiladelphia.com/",
        "fullContent": "Sign up for our Daily Email newsletter to stay up-to-date on the latest local news throughout Philadelphia.\n\nAhead of the band’s upcoming performance at the Keswick Theater, Travis frontman Fran Healy sat down with Metro to discuss the band’s most recent album, ‘L.A. Times’, their creative process as innovators, and the experience of live music.\n\nYour latest album, ‘L.A. Times’ — can you break down its inspiration?\n\nIt was me venting about LA and having lived there for eight years. And just like I was like, ‘That’s enough, [I] can’t take any more.’ The whole album was written while I lived in LA, and song-wise, I would say there’s a bit of everything. There’s a lot of reflection and a lot of looking back. But, honestly, [when] writing songs, your entire experience kind of comes out in a song. If you’re writing in a proper way, which is just like digging until you find something, you bring it to the surface, and it starts to become something.\n\nThe first song is me looking back to Glasgow, waiting on a bus, and then this metaphor of a bus being like life, your kind of mortality. It’s a bit deep, but I’m thinking about it. I’m 51, I’m a father. So I’m thinking about stuff like that. Song two is called ‘Raze The Bar,’ which is about this brilliant bar in New York. It’s got nothing to do with LA, but I think living in LA has made me really long for everything outside of LA. So I’m thinking about New York and the third song, it’s a breakup song, looking at my relationship with my ex, looking at my relationship with my son.\n\nAnd then the fourth song is ‘Gaslight,’ which is just a song about being gaslit for quite a while and getting emancipation, that sort of thing, fighting back against those a–holes. I think there’s been a lot of the tectonic movement in my life, emotional plates moving big, big, big things happening, people dying, people leaving, weeding the garden, so to speak, and then coming out the other side of it and this record sort of chronicles all of that sort of movement.\n\nYou’ve said that for you, the process is not to write songs for charts but to write based on life. Can you delve into that a bit?\n\nEvery song [I’ve ever written] is about something. There’s about 5% of our business that, I would say, innovates. And I think a lot of music, that 95% of music in the charts, is that other type of music. When Travis got massive, like no one even knew we existed, and then suddenly, the next year, we were so different than everything else that everything else had to change to fit in with us. So you find all these bands suddenly sounding like you. We were part of the 5% that just does its thing and, just by chance, became popular, and then the whole business then goes, Oh, we gotta sound like this because this is popular.\n\nSo they all follow; it’s like the flock follows whatever it is. And so I’ve never stopped writing like that. So when we’re suddenly very popular, then suddenly The Strokes come along, I’m not going to suddenly sound like The Strokes just to be popular. That just so goes against the grain of what I’m about. We’re not that kind of band. But again, bands that I love are bands like us that are the 5% bands that just cut their own; they cut their own [teeth]. And I think it’s maybe a little bit more interesting than someone who or a writer who is constantly just trying to stay in fashion…\n\nAuthenticity is one big thing for us. Just be who you are, no matter what that is. Two, art because we all went to art school. We’re an art school band. And three mischief. I’m not so cheeky in real life. I can be, but I’m much more so on the stage… And so we decided that everything we put out has to have those three things in it. And there’s a fourth thing, which is storytelling. It’s a big part of what we do. And the live shows really encapsulated all of those elements together.\n\nThis seems to parallel a lyric by My Morning Jacket from the song ‘Wordless Chorus,’ which says “We are the innovators, they are the imitators. ” Does it seem to be that same type of idea?\n\nThat’s the perfect comparison, yeah, Jim [James] is amazing.\n\nWhat can fans coming to see Travis expect, and why should they be excited?\n\nLet’s talk about My Morning Jacket for a second and not talk about Travis as an example. You listen to ‘Z’ (the album that features ‘Wordless Chorus’), if you listen to it, and that’s the band in a studio playing as much live, hopefully as possible, and then you turn it up on your stereo, and to get the heavy guitars louder, to get the experience that’s like 1% of of the band you’re getting.\n\nIn order to completely get that band, you have to go and see them live. You have to go and stand at the feet of Jim James and hear his roar, watch the guitar, just see the way the guitarist runs across the stage. And that’s where music really resides. I mean, it really is. Seeing a band live is, that’s it. You get the whole DNA of everything and albums, not to knock albums, because albums are art pieces in themselves, but if you really want to get into a band or understand the band.\n\n[Travis is] very artistic. We’re very silly up front, not silly, but entertaining on stage and we’re serious as well. And have quite a lot to say. But it’s cool, it’s just real. And it’s, there’s no backing tracks or anything, and it’s like four guys just f–king hitting their s–t out their instruments and making something out of it.\n\nCatch ‘Travis’ at the Keswick Theater on Tuesday, Feb. 18, for more information, visit keswicktheatre.com",

        "source": "https://metrophiladelphia.com/",
        "fullContent": "Sign up for our Daily Email newsletter to stay up-to-date on the latest local news throughout Philadelphia.\n\nAn action film where half of it takes place on the side of a building—it sounds like a tall order, but director Martin Campbell’s ‘Cleaner’ is here to serve this high-octane feature on a platter. Starring Daisy Ridley, Clive Owen and Taz Skylar, the film centers on Joey (Ridley), a high-rise window cleaner who finds herself involved in a hostage situation with radical activists. Joey has a unique set of skills that lends to her having to save the building and its inhabitants, including her brother.\n\nTo talk about the sky-high role and filming, Ridley sat down with Metro, delving into her character and the training that went in to creating ‘Cleaner.’\n\nWhat made you want to sign on with this film?\n\nFirst and foremost, it was Martin Campbell’s name written there. I thought, wow I love his movies—that was really exciting. And then I found the script very propulsive… you always hope that there’s going to be a happy ending, but for so long it feels so rocky that I remember thinking, how is this going to be figured out?\n\nThen getting to balance all of that with the relationship I have with my brother [played by Matthew Tuck] in the movie, and the complicated nature of that dynamic. Plus the fact that Joey has made a lot of mistakes but spends most of the film trying to make up for them, she’s trying to take accountability for what she’s done. I just thought it was a really beautiful emotional throughline amongst all of the fun action-packed stuff.\n\nMartin Campbell definitely knows how to build action films around characters that you root for. With your character, Joey, what do you like about her and what can you tease about her emotional journey in the film?\n\nI really like that she’s upfront. It’s very clear from early on that she has made some real missteps and that she’s pretty selfish in the way that she lives. And of course, you learn over time that she and her brother had a really difficult time growing up. Her brother has autism and has lived in a place that means he does not have the freedom that she does. So the balance of that is honestly very relatable and probably very understandable to a lot of people.\n\nBut I like that she’s scrappy and I like that she owns up to what she does, and I like that it gets to a point where she says: It literally does not matter what happens to me, everything is in service of my brother. I think it’s a good fable. [With] us all, we assume there will be time to make the right choice next week or see the friend you haven’t seen for a year next week— you just don’t know what’s going to happen. And for the most part, this won’t happen because it’s heightened, but I like that feeling…the immediacy of what is the right thing to do right now?\n\nWhat went into your preparation for filming? I know part of the time was spent on the side of a building in Canada.\n\nWe filmed some of it there, and for the most part, it was done in a studio. But I did have window cleaning lessons, and honestly, it’s so hard to do it without leaving a streak. And so that in and of itself is tricky. Then there were two ways you could do it: You’re either in the harness or you’re in the cradle, and even in the harness, it’s so tricky figuring out how you can get close enough to do what you need to do.\n\nHonestly, whenever I see people up there, I think [they] are amazing because the thought of it actually turns my stomach. And of course, people get so comfortable with that height. But it’s also quite meditative in a lovely way. And it’s funny that she then has her boss in her ear who is so annoying while she’s just trying to get her day done.\n\nAnd how about prepping for some of the action scenes that Joey is involved in?\n\nI had maybe six weeks of training beforehand. A lot of it was getting the physicality and the understanding of how Joey moves. There were two big fights at the end of the movie, and I wanted those to feel really aggressive and gnarly and realistic for the situation that she’s in. A lot of that was feeling very comfortable with the person that you’re fighting with on screen. Then you really know each other and it’s like a dance of proximity.\n\nIt must have been interesting for you with filming—for half of the film, you’re acting on your own in scenes, and then the other half you’re fighting.\n\nYeah, it was. I had my hair, makeup and costume team who were amazing, [but] for the most part, I was alone. I always was talking to someone, so I could hear, and I always knew the performance on the other side. So, I weirdly didn’t really feel alone. But then when I was with people, I thought, oh, this is so strange.\n\nSince Martin Campbell was a big factor in your signing on, how was it working with him?\n\nI was in an interesting position—we would sometimes be filming scene 12 and then we’d be going to film scene 98 because of where the cradle was that I stand on for a lot of it. And of course, I knew what was going on in every scene, but I was looking to Martin to help guide me emotionally in those moments. He had written every single scene, what was happening, what had just happened before, what had just happened after this whole page.\n\nSo if we were going on to scene 50, he would have it written, which was amazing. It’s just that extra layer of knowing and trusting Martin. It’s tricky with such high-octane emotions and making sure to maintain that level of adrenaline. So having him there was so wonderful, I just think he’s an amazing, amazing director.\n\nIn terms of an action film, what stands out to you about ‘Cleaner’?\n\nI feel like it’s a great British action movie, which I haven’t seen too recently. So that’s really nice. But I think with all of the films that we love, we watch for the action—but you have to root for who you’re watching and you have to understand why the people are doing what they’re doing. So I hope that this does that in that it’s a great action movie, but at the center of it, there’s a relationship between a brother and sister who love each other and are just trying to do their best for each other.\n\n‘Cleaner’ will release in theaters Feb. 21. Tickets are now available on Fandango",

        "fullContent": "Sign up for our email newsletter to stay up-to-date on the latest local sports news throughout Philadelphia.\n\nComing off of an incredible rookie year that saw him become a Super Bowl champion, Philadelphia Eagles‘ cornerback Cooper DeJean held an autograph signing on Saturday, Feb. 15, at a Dick’s Sporting Goods store located in Wilmington, Delaware. In between the hordes of fans who came to see him, DeJean briefly addressed the media, reflecting on his unforgettable pick-six, the recent victory in Super Bowl LIX, and the support he’s felt from Philly fans.\n\nLess than 24 hours after a parade celebrating a Super Bowl victory, there are certain — we’ll call them — logistical challenges that could temp one to avoid spending hours with hundreds, potentially a thousand-plus screaming fans under fluorescent lights while Scatman John inexplicably blarred throughout the store. Full credit to DeJean for not canceling or changing the details of his previously agreed appearance in any way and supporting the fans who have supported him throughout the season.\n\nPhiladelphia Eagles’ star cornerback Cooper DeJean poses with a family of fans.\n\nMeeting, greeting, and shaking hands with the masses, Cooper’s victory tour since coming back to Greater Philadelphia continued to be a roaring success.\n\nLooking back on the year, DeJean began 2024 coming off a fractured fibula, which prematurely ended his final season in Iowa. From the lows of a season cut short to being drafted in the second round by the Philadelphia Eagles, becoming their starting slot corner, and playing a crucial role on the NFL’s top defense in his rookie season, it was quite the roller coaster of a year for the young defensive back but it all culminated on Sunday, Feb. 9.\n\nFeb 9, 2025; New Orleans, LA, USA; Philadelphia Eagles cornerback Cooper DeJean (33) scores a touchdown after making an interception against the Kansas City Chiefs during the first half of Super Bowl LIX at Caesars Superdome. Mandatory Credit: Bill Streicher-Imagn Images\n\nNotable as both the day Super Bowl LIX would take place and Cooper DeJean’s 22nd birthday, the evening of Feb. 9 brought plenty of excitement for Philadelphia’s youngest Eagle. As if the appearance alone were not thrilling enough, DeJean made a landmark play in his career, his first interception, but this was no ordinary interception.\n\nFew could construct a moment more exciting than picking off arguably the greatest player in NFL history and returning it for a touchdown en route to winning the Super Bowl on your birthday. Life is full of amazements that defy the odds, from the miracle of birth to the complexities of the human eye, and yet, what Cooper DeJean accomplished, considering the factors that played into the moment, is similarly awe-inspiring.\n\nThe Kansas City Chiefs were the favorites coming into the game and seemed to many to be only a few hours away from the first team to win three straight Super Bowls. Patrick Mahomes had never thrown a pick-six in any of his previous playoff appearances. The idea was completely alien, and yet, as they say, there’s a first time for everything.\n\nFeb 9, 2025; New Orleans, LA, USA; Philadelphia Eagles cornerback Cooper DeJean (33) celebrates with teammates after returning an interception for a touchdown against the Kansas City Chiefs during the first half of Super Bowl LIX at Caesars Superdome. Mandatory Credit: Geoff Burke-Imagn Images\n\nLaying down the details around the moment, from the play to the opponent, the stage, and so on, Cooper DeJean discussed with Philly Sports Network the moment, how it ranked in his career, and how, as incredible it was, another moment that same night outshone it.\n\n“Yeah, it’s up there, right? It was pretty awesome, a pretty awesome moment for me, for my team really. In that moment, me getting my first pick, in the Super Bowl, on my birthday. But then, winning the game as well. That was the best part about it, getting that Lombardi trophy.”\n\nSince that moment, holding the Lombardi in his rookie season, life has moved quickly for DeJean. He returned to Philadelphia, took part in Philadelphia’s ultimate celebration, and then found himself the man of the hour as swarms of Eagles fans surrounded a sporting goods store just to meet him. It’s a lot of love DeJean has felt from the Philly Phaithful since his arrival, and not a moment of it has been lost on him.\n\nPhiladelphia Eagles’ star cornerback Cooper DeJean poses with a fan at a Dick’s Sporting Goods store located in Wilmington, DE.\n\n“I felt welcomed ever since I got here. I love everybody in the city. I love how supportive they are, how much they care. I couldn’t imagine they’ll play getting play anywhere else.”",

The city’s new, free initiative equips businesses with the knowledge and best practices to increase the nighttime safety of both their patrons and employees.\n\nThe businesses participating will learn prevention and intervention techniques that will help them solve some of the most pressing challenges when it comes to maintaining public safety, the kinds of challenges that nighttime businesses often face.\n\n“Since declaring a public safety emergency on my first day in office, we have made significant strides in making Philadelphia safer and violent crime is decreasing across the board,” said Mayor Cherelle L. Parker. “We are deeply committed to investing in public safety and strengthening collaboration across the city to ensure these improvements continue. The Liberty Bell Safe Certification Program is providing businesses with essential safety practices, skills, and training. We are working to make the city’s nighttime economy safer for both patrons and employees.

As we prepare to welcome hundreds of thousands of visitors from around the world, these businesses will play a pivotal role in growing a thriving, welcoming, vibrant, and safer nighttime economy.”\n\nThe selected businesses will also attend six training sessions in partnership with the Department of Public Health, Philadelphia Police Department, Department of Licenses & Inspections and WOAR Philadelphia Center Against Sexual Violence in order to be designated as Liberty Bell Safe certified businesses in Philadelphia.\n\nThe topics of those training sessions include: harm reduction, sexual harassment prevention, conflict resolution, diversity, equity, and inclusion training, active shooter awareness, and human trafficking prevention and awareness.\n\n“Since stepping into this role, I have been actively engaging with and providing one-on-one support to businesses that operate at night,” said Raheem Manning, Director, Nighttime Economy, Philadelphia’s Department of Commerce. “In partnership with our Nighttime Advisory Council, we are proud to have overseen the successful launch of the Liberty Bell Safe Certification program, which aligns with Mayor Parker’s vision of a safer Philadelphia, where economic opportunities are accessible to all.”\n\n“Each business that completes the program receives a $500 marketing grant to promote their certification demonstrating their readiness with prevention and intervention skills to help address the unique challenges faced by their nighttime establishments. The continued growth of our nighttime economy is built on strong collaboration between government agencies, businesses, creatives, and community stakeholders for all.”\n\nTo learn more about eligibility criteria and updated cohort training schedule for additional businesses to apply, visit phila.gov.",

We are that much closer to baseball season, meaning we’re so close to hearing “BEER, BEER, BEER, BEER, BEEEEEEER” on our televisions for a month.\n\nThe Phillies were relatively quiet this offseason and lost pitchers Jeff Hoffman (Blue Jays) and Carlos Estévez (Royals) to free agency. Fans have questions about the roster, and we have answers! I teamed up with fellow Philadelphia Sports Network writer Shaun Nestor to answer some of those questions.\n\nWhich Phillies reliever will lead the team in saves at the end of the year?\n\nKylee: I’ll have to go with Orion Kerkering. Before I go into this, I want to make it clear I have a ton of faith in Jordan Romano. I just believe Kerkering will take that big of a leap forward and be the backbone that the Phillies need following Jeff Hoffman’s departure to Toronto.\n\nShaun: This may not be the popular answer, but I think Jordan Romano does the job there. Especially in Rob Thomson’s system of “bullpen by committee,” Romano’s experience will get him the bulk of the action while Jose Alvarado, Orion Kerkering, Matt Strahm, and others get their time in the 9th as well.\n\nPredict a Phillies trade deadline addition\n\nKylee: I think the Phillies will go after a relief pitcher. I don’t think it’ll be a high-end reliever because I believe Romano and Kerkering will take over, but more options in relief can’t possibly do any harm.\n\nShaun: You know, nothing stands out as a huge need to be filled at the trade deadline yet to me. But I’m going to go out on a limb here: a package likely involving one of Miller, Crawford, or Tait to the Brewers for Devin Williams and Rhys Hoskins. Spicy enough for you?\n\nAug 15, 2024; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA; Philadelphia Phillies outfielder Johan Rojas (18) hits an RBI single during the fourth inning against the Washington Nationals at Citizens Bank Park. Mandatory Credit: Bill Streicher-USA TODAY Sports\n\nAre there any position battles in camp?\n\nKylee: The obvious one is centerfield with Brandon Marsh and Johan Rojas, but you could argue the closer role has a position battle. As it stands, Jordan Romano is expected to have the Jeff Hoffman/main closer role, but I wouldn’t be surprised to see Orion Kerkering have a shot at the spot if Romano starts slow.\n\nShaun: If anything, Brandon Marsh and Johan Rojas will battle for the center field job, but I fully expect that to remain at the status quo with a platoon.\n\nWhat prospects not named Andrew Painter can you see getting called up this season?\n\nKylee: I would be very shocked to see Justin Crawford and Aidan Miller up this season. Dave Dombrowski already said he sees Miller as a 2026 at-best guy. With that in mind, I would expect to see Mick Abel up at some point. I don’t think he’ll make it right out of camp, but I see it happening by the trade deadline.\n\nShaun: Technically I expect Mick Abel will make the Phillies bullpen out of camp, but that’s not really what this question is asking. If anything, I would expect Jean Cabrera, Seth Johnson, or Griff McGarry to come up at some point to fill in for an injury here or there, but I wouldn’t get my hopes up for Aidan Miller or Justin Crawford just yet.\n\nMandatory Credit: Jonathan Dyer-Imagn Images",

        "fullContent": "Sign up for our email newsletter to stay up-to-date on the latest local sports news throughout Philadelphia.\n\nThe 2025 MLS season starts this week, and it’s time to start thinking about the expectations a new season brings. For the Philadelphia Union, The past few seasons have been about punching above their weight to try to win the League. Just two seasons ago, they were minutes away from doing that before falling in penalty kicks against LAFC. Since then, Philly decided to run it back two years in a row. This led to falling short of their own expectation; they missed the playoffs for the first time in years last season, leading to the firing of longtime coach Jim Curtin and the beginning of a roster rebuild.\n\nNow, expectations are different. Bradley Carnell is readying this team to take on Orlando to open the MLS season this coming weekend. However, the landscape of the club is different. They aren’t in as many competitions as they were when they were more successful. They aren’t in the Concacaf Champions Cup or Leagues Cup in 2025. This year, it’s just MLS and the historic US Open Cup. There’s much less competition and money up for the taking this year, which means the expectations have changed. As we look at expectations ahead of the season, there are five areas in which the Union can be assessed.\n\nThe MLS Campaign\n\nThe US Open Cup\n\nPlayer Development\n\nCoaching Tactics/Adaptability\n\nThe overall club culture/vibes\n\nFor now, we’ll focus on the Union’s MLS expectations for 2025. We’ll discuss the other aspects in the days before the start of the season.\n\nSep 18, 2024; New York, New York, USA; Philadelphia Union midfielder Jesus Bueno (20) reacts after a play against New York City FC at Yankee Stadium. Mandatory Credit: Mark Smith-Imagn Images\n\nPhiladelphia Union’s MLS Expectations\n\nThe MLS season is the Union’s main focus, and we know that Philadelphia likes to keep the main focus the same right now. The Union is rebuilding, so what are its expectations for 2025?\n\nFor any expectation, there is a baseline success, an unmitigated failure, and an overachieving success. These are the three outcomes for an expectation. Let’s examine how the Union could actualize these expectations in its 2025 MLS campaign.\n\nSep 18, 2024; New York, New York, USA; Philadelphia Union midfielder Daniel Gazdag (10) celebrates after scoring a goal against New York City FC with forward Tai Baribo (28) during the first half at Yankee Stadium. Mandatory Credit: Mark Smith-Imagn Images\n\nBaseline Success: Make Playoffs\n\nIt’s pretty evident right now that the baseline expectation for this Philadelphia Union side is to make it to the playoffs. They failed to do so last year, and all of their efforts in MLS this season should be to make it back. The idea of winning trophies is likely not in question this year, but being able to play in the playoffs again and possibly go on a “magical run” is not out of the question.\n\n10 teams out of the 15 in MLS’s Eastern Conference make the playoffs, so this is not shooting for the moon here. It should be expected that Philly could be one of the top 10 teams in their conference. However, if they aren’t, it may be time for changes not on the roster or in the coaching staff…\n\nMandatory Credit: Philadelphia Union\n\nUnmitigated Failure: Miss playoffs for a 2nd season in a row\n\nThis season, the biggest failure for Philadelphia would be missing out on the MLS Cup playoffs. As mentioned, only five teams out of 15 don’t make the playoffs from the Eastern Conference. Should Philly fall anywhere between 11th and 15th place, there will be hell to pay.\n\nWe all know that the Union isn’t like other MLS teams. They tend to take a frugal approach to their team building. They don’t spend a lot on players. They like to utilize promoting players from their second team or academy to become difference makers and find diamonds in the rough to come in and be the “stars.” If this doesn’t work again, the 2025 season will be nothing but a failure.\n\nSep 28, 2024; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA; Philadelphia Union midfielder Alejandro Bedoya (11) reacts against Atlanta United in the second half at Subaru Park. Mandatory Credit: Kyle Ross-Imagn Images\n\nOverachieving Success: Finish top four in the East\n\nOn the flip side, what if the 2025 Union team can do what the teams in 2020 and 2022 did? What if Philly can overachieve so much that they finish at the top of the Eastern Conference? A top-four finish would mean hosting the opening playoff series and a better chance at having home-field advantage throughout an improbable playoff run.\n\nFor this to happen, all of Philly’s new diamond-in-the-rough signings will have to hit, and young players like Cavan Sullivan and the rest of the homegrown will have to ball out. You can never say never in MLS, but this would be a massive overachievement for a new coach and a rebuilt roster. It would be the most “That’s So Union” thing ever if the 2025 Union were able to finish in the top four of the East when no one was expecting that type of finish from them.\n\nSep 28, 2024; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA; Philadelphia Union defender Nathan Harriel (26) celebrates with teammates after scoring a goal against Atlanta United in the second half at Subaru Park.

After a lengthy and grueling season, Philadelphia heads into the offseason with a few questions to answer.\n\nIn the latest edition of my Eagles mailbag, I’ll discuss Philadelphia’s next offensive coordinator, biggest offseason needs and much more regarding the team moving forward.\n\n@laAJbrownance asked, “Who is your personal favorite for the OC job?”\n\nNov 24, 2024; Inglewood, California, USA; Philadelphia Eagles head coach Nick Sirianni watches game action against the Los Angeles Rams during the second half at SoFi Stadium. Mandatory Credit: Gary A. Vasquez-Imagn Images\n\nNathan Scheelhaase is a potential offensive coordinator candidate that I have previously mentioned. Scheelhaase reportedly withdrew from the running for the Jacksonville Jaguars’ offensive coordinator opening to remain with the Los Angeles Rams earlier in February. Yet he has previously interviewed with the Eagles prior to the team promoting Brian Johnson in 2023.\n\nScheelhaase worked under Iowa State head coach Matt Campbell for several years, who is a close friend and former college teammate of Eagles head coach Nick Sirianni. Last season, Scheelhaase serves as the Rams pass game specialist and “play drawer” for Sean McVay.\n\nGiven his potential, Scheelhaase is certainly my personal favorite candidate for Philadelphia’s offensive coordinator opening. Although, the early indications are that Kevin Patullo will be promoted to fill that role for the Eagles in 2025.\n\n@BrentleyDOliver asked, “What is the biggest need for the Eagles for next season?”\n\nFeb 9, 2025; New Orleans, LA, USA; Philadelphia Eagles defensive tackle Milton Williams (93) celebrates on the podium after defeating the Kansas City Chiefs in Super Bowl LIX at Ceasars Superdome. Mandatory Credit: Mark J. Rebilas-Imagn Images\n\nFour of Philadelphia’s starters from their Super Bowl winning roster are set to hit free agency: Mekhi Becton, Josh Sweat, Milton Williams and Zack Baun. There’s also a chance that Nakobe Dean could miss a significant amount of time due to his knee injury next season as well.\n\nYet Eagles general manager Howie Roseman has strategically built this roster to have in-house replacements at several positions of potential weakness in 2025. Therefore, Philadelphia’s biggest positions of need are more long-term.\n\nHere’s how I would rank the top five needs for the Eagles this offseason:\n\nDefensive Tackle: Milton Williams will likely command a massive contract in free agency and the Eagles need to keep the potential fifth-year option for Jordan Davis and contract extension for Jalen Carter in mind. Offensive Tackle: Lane Johnson isn’t getting any younger and both of Philadelphia’s offensive tackles missed time this past season. Fred Johnson filled in admirably off the bench but he’ll be a free agent. Tight End: Dallas Goedert is essentially guaranteed to miss multiple games each season and Grant Calcaterra was far too inconsistent to be a reliable replacement for the 30-year-old tight end moving forward. Edge Defender: While both Josh Sweat and Brandon Graham could be done in Philadelphia, the Eagles still have a ton of potential on the edge in Nolan Smith and Jalyx Hunt. Cornerback: Quinyon Mitchell and Cooper DeJean are absolute studs. Yet Darius Slay’s future in Philadelphia is murky due to his contract situation and Isaiah Rodgers is set to become a free agent this offseason.\n\n@VladdyMuse asked, “Do you expect any contract restructure(s)? If so, who?”\n\nDec 31, 2023; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA; Philadelphia Eagles general manager Howie Roseman (middle) and head coach Nick Sirianni (L) walk from the tunnel before a game against the Arizona Cardinals at Lincoln Financial Field. Mandatory Credit: Bill Streicher-USA TODAY Sports\n\nRoseman has shown over the years that he is willing to get creative with contract structure to create additional cap space. One potential option would be to restructure Saquon Barkley’s current contract, converting a portion of his base salary into a signing bonus to free up around $1.3 million in 2025.\n\nLane Johnson has talked about playing for a few more years as well. Therefore, he could help the Eagles out by restructuring his current contract and freeing up nearly $3 million in 2025 as well.\n\nPhiladelphia could also create nearly $4 million in cap space in 2025 by restructuring Dallas Goedert’s contract. Yet given his lengthy injury history, he could actually be a sneaky cut or trade candidate this offseason as well.\n\n@Michael93826345 asked, “Who are some edge free agents that intrigue you?”\n\nSep 22, 2024; Cleveland, Ohio, USA; New York Giants linebacker Bobby Okereke (58) and New York Giants linebacker Azeez Ojulari (51) celebrate after a sack during the first quarter against the Cleveland Browns at Huntington Bank Field. Mandatory Credit: Ken Blaze-Imagn Images\n\nFangio has earned the right to have his finger prints all over the construction of Philadelphia’s defense moving forward. It’s clear that the Bryce Huff project didn’t work as planned, which is why Fangio could look to reunite with two of his former players in 2025.\n\nKhalil Mack is a decorated veteran that has essentially done it all except win a Super Bowl in the NFL. Fangio and Mack spent once season together in 2018 and Philadelphia’s defensive coordinator still praises the 33-year-old veteran today. If Mack wants to chase a Super Bowl ring, he could sign with the Eagles in free agency.\n\nBaron Browning was a third-round pick by the Denver Broncos in Fangio’s final season as the team’s head coach. Browning has been inconsistent in the NFL thus far and could reunite with Fangio to revitalize his career in 2025.\n\nAzeez Ojulari is just 24-years-old and showed a ton of promise with the New York Giants at times.

        "fullContent": "Sign up for our email newsletter to stay up-to-date on the latest local sports news throughout Philadelphia.\n\nBuckle up, Union fans. Today is the last Monday without Philadelphia Union soccer until at least mid-October, and I’m happy to announce that I’ll be back covering the team’s journey through the MLS season for the 3rd consecutive year – for better or for worse.\n\n2025 marks the first season with new Head Coach Bradley Carnell at the helm, and there are still a few questions that need answering heading into a season that could have big implications for the club’s future direction. Let’s take a look at a few of those before Union’s first match of the 2025 season on Saturday night in Orlando.\n\nImage Credit: Philadelphia Union\n\n1) Carnell’s preferred starting XI and formation\n\nCarnell used several main formations during his time with St. Louis – 4-2-3-1, 4-2-2-2, and a 4-4-2 diamond, to name a few. Given the personnel and the fact that these players were familiar with a 4-4-2 diamond formation under the previous manager, Jim Curtin, I would favor Carnell rolling out the team in that type of setup, though I wouldn’t be entirely shocked by a 4-2-2-2.\n\nI’m taking a stab at it, but here’s my best guess as to how things would be lined up in a 4-4-2 diamond on Saturday night – given everyone is healthy and ready to go\n\nGK: Andre Blake\n\nRB: Nate Harriel, CB:Jakob Glesnes, CB: Ian Glavinovich, LB: Kai Wagner\n\nCDM: Jovan Lukić\n\nRCM: Quinn Sullivan, LCM: Danley Jean-Jacques\n\nCAM: Daniel Gazdag\n\nST: Mikael Uhre, Tai Baribo\n\nImage Credit: Philadelphia Union\n\n2) Will Carnell be able to make adjustments?\n\nFrom the small bits of pre-season action we’ve had access to, it’s clear Carnell is going to play Ernst Tanner’s desired style of Red-Bull-inspired soccer, which implements an over-the-top intense high-press that Carnell hopes will result in a 60-30-10 split on the attacking end – 60% of goals scored coming from transition, 30% from set pieces, and just 10% from possession.\n\nBut what happens when the Union plays a well-organized, low-block defensive team that forces them to play with the ball and create opportunities? What happens when Union goes down 1-0 early in the game, and the other team parks the bus? Will Carnell be able to adjust and tweak the squad to bring a different look to the pitch to try and change the game? Or will this Union team struggle to adjust and play with flexibility like they did under Jim Curtin at times?\n\nNov 2, 2024; Chester, Pennsylvania, USA; General view of Subaru Park before the game between Philadelphia Union II and Columbus Crew 2. Mandatory Credit: Caean Couto-Imagn Images\n\n3) Who’s the first player off the bench?\n\nIt’s been an issue each of the last two seasons – who do Union turn to on the bench to change the game when it’s not going the way they want?\n\n37-year-old veteran Midfielder Ale Bedoya will likely be one of the first players Bradley Carnell turns to on the bench this season. Bedoya registered 2 goals and 4 assists in just under 1,500 MLS minutes last season and showed he still had it in him to impact games both in the starting XI and off the bench, but I don’t think he should be depended on as the main guy to come off the bench and get you a goal when it’s needed most.\n\nAlternatively to Bedoya’s veteran presence, 2025 will be the season of introducing Union’s youth to the big stage. Players like Cavan Sullivan, Jeremy Rafanello, CJ Olney, and David Vazquez will likely get opportunities to make an impact off the bench as well in 2025.\n\nAnd, of course, once the signing of Bruno Damiani is finalized, which seems to be all but official at this point, the Union will have 3 MLS-ready strikers in their arsenal. I’d expect Damiani to start on the bench while he gets acclimated, but I wouldn’t be surprised to see him eventually take one of the starting spots, moving either Mikael Uhre or Tai Baribo to the bench and giving Union more solid options to bring on late in the game.\n\nImage Credit: Philadelphia Union\n\n4) Can the new boys hit the ground running?\n\nOne factor in Union’s success this season is how quickly the new signings can transition into the group and start making an impact on the field. Centerback Ian Glavinovich and Midfielder Jovan Lukić are two names that look set to claim spots in the starting XI right off the bat, with rumored striker signing Bruno Damiani hoping to do the same upon his arrival and acclimation.\n\nIn positive news for Union, Ian Glavinovich has gotten to attend a majority of pre-season training with his new club and head coach, with Jovan Lukić joining the team in the later portion of pre-season. That’s on top of Danley Jean-Jacques, who made his Union debut in the middle of the 2024 season, getting his first full pre-season with Union and a new manager under his belt. Those 3 having a smooth pre-season will be a huge factor in how quickly Union starts the season.\n\nAug 28, 2024; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA; Columbus Crew midfielder Alexandru Matan (20) plays the ball defended by Philadelphia Union midfielder Danley Jean Jacques (21) in the first half at Subaru Park. Mandatory Credit: Eric Hartline-USA TODAY Sports\n\n5) What exactly are the expectations for this team in 2025?\n\n2025 will be the Union’s first season with a new manager in charge in almost a decade, and it comes after missing the playoffs for the first time since 2017. So the big question is, what are the expectations surrounding this team in 2025, and how short is Bradley Carnell’s leash?\n\nI don’t think silverware is realistically on the mind of many Union fans heading into 2025, but surely, getting back into a playoff spot will be one of the main goals for the Blue and Gold this season. With 62% of the league able to qualify for postseason play, it has to be. But what if they don’t?\n\nI think it would be harsh to move on from Carnell after one season unless things go horribly, horribly wrong. But at the same time, Carnell is hand-picked by Ernst Tanner for Ernst Tanner’s style of soccer. The players brought in during the last 2 windows are players that fit Ernst Tanner’s style of play. The team will undoubtedly, and maybe even to a fault at times, play the style of soccer that Ernst Tanner has spent time and money building the entire organization around over the last few years.\n\nIf things start to head in the right direction and eventually it all works out, Union fans will all be singing praises about Ernst Tanner and the vision he’s brought to the club, and they should. But if it doesn’t work out, and the Union fails to make the playoffs again, who falls on the sword this time?\n\nSep 28, 2024; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA; Philadelphia Union defender Nathan Harriel (26) celebrates with teammates after scoring a goal against Atlanta United in the second half at Subaru Park.

        "fullContent": "President Donald Trump listens to Robert F. Kennedy Jr. in the Oval Office of the White House, on the day Kennedy is sworn in as secretary of Health and Human Service in Washington, D.C., U.S., February 13, 2025.\n\nSign up for our Daily Email newsletter to stay up-to-date on the latest local news throughout Philadelphia.\n\nRobert F. Kennedy Jr. has been confirmed as the secretary of the US Health and Human Services Department. Put simply, this makes him the most influential figure in overseeing the health and wellbeing of more than 330 million Americans.\n\nAs health secretary, Kennedy will be involved in overseeing federal health agencies that regulate medical research, disease prevention, drug approvals and health-care programs.\n\nThis includes oversight of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the Food and Drug Administration and the National Institutes of Health, which are among the most crucial public health agencies in the country.\n\nReports suggest he’ll oversee a budget in the order of $1.8 trillion annually.\n\nIn the era of Trump 2.0, there’s little that shocks me anymore. But Kennedy would have to be the most unqualified person ever to hold this crucial role of protecting the health of the American people.\n\nA history of discounting science\n\nThe absolute minimum requirement for someone occupying such as role should be an understanding of science and respect for scientific evidence and expertise. Yet, Kennedy fails spectacularly in this regard.\n\nHere are just some of the false claims he has made over the years:\n\nKennedy has suggested Lyme disease is likely to be an engineered bioweapon\n\nHe reportedly said 99% of COVID deaths occurred in people with vitamin D deficiencies\n\nHe has questioned the role of HIV in causing AIDS.\n\nNone of these positions has even the smallest amount of scientific support.\n\nIt’s hard to predict what Kennedy will do as health secretary, especially given his confirmation hearings looked to be an exercise in being vague, evasive and denying or downplaying his prior controversial statements to secure support.\n\nBut there are three areas where his views are fairly clear and his appointment could be expected to have a significant impact. These are water fluoridation, infectious diseases research and vaccines.\n\nFluoridation of water\n\nKennedy has been a long-term opponent of water fluoridation, despite its proven benefits in preventing tooth decay. He has consistently questioned its safety and claimed it’s linked to a range of illnesses such as arthritis, bone cancer, IQ loss and neurodevelopmental disorders.\n\nWhile a recent review suggested a link between water fluoridation and lower IQ in children, the levels of fluoride in the water in countries included in this review were generally several times higher than the levels in public water fluoridation programs in countries such as the US and Australia. There were also other limitations that make interpreting these findings challenging.\n\nThe CDC has identified community water fluoridation as as one of the ten great public health achievements of the 20th century. And it continues to benefit dental health today, without any convincing evidence of possible harms.\n\nNonetheless, it seems likely that in keeping with his longstanding views one of Kennedy’s first priorities will be to try to halt water fluoridation in the US.\n\nInfectious diseases\n\nAlongside his confirmation as health secretary, US President Donald Trump signed an executive order establishing “The President’s Commission to Make America Healthy Again”, with Kennedy as the chair.\n\nThe Make America Healthy Again movement (MAHA) is an initiative driven by Kennedy focusing on improving nutrition, increasing transparency in medical practices and reducing the corporate influence in health.\n\nThough premised primarily on combating chronic diseases, the movement also embraces skepticism of established medical practices, unproven alternative therapies and a general mistrust of institutions.\n\nWhat’s more, Kennedy’s focus on chronic diseases seems to be coming at the expense of continued work on infectious diseases.\n\nHe has proposed directing the National Institutes of Health to pause infectious disease research for eight years to prioritize research into chronic diseases and alternative treatments.\n\nAs health secretary, Kennedy has the power to shift research priorities. If he were to effectively halt infectious diseases research – in the wake of COVID and with a looming threat of future pandemics – this would be catastrophic for the US and global health.\n\nVaccine scepticism\n\nRelated to infectious diseases, there’s little doubt the area in which Kennedy has done the most damage relates to vaccines.\n\nHe has dedicated a large part of his life to undermining public confidence in vaccines. This is despite overwhelming scientific evidence demonstrating their safety and effectiveness, and the millions of lives they’ve saved.\n\nAlthough he has subsequently denied it, Kennedy is on record as falsely stating there is no such thing as a safe and effective vaccine. Notably, he has continued to push the debunked claim that the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine is linked to autism, despite the single study finding this having been widely discredited.\n\nKennedy’s frequent assertion that he’s not anti-vaccine, but “pro-safety”, is also deeply disingenuous. Being “pro-safety” is a deliberately vague notion designed to appear reasonable while at the same time undermining the scientific evidence.\n\nThe impact of Kennedy’s appointment as health secretary on vaccine confidence will not just be limited to the US. Vaccine hesitancy has been recognized as one of the greatest threats to public health. Having a vaccine sceptic leading the US health agencies has the potential to harm vaccine uptake worldwide.\n\nAs we’ve seen during the COVID pandemic, producing a vaccine is only half the battle. Convincing people to take it is just as important. There’s no doubt Kennedy’s influence on public health messaging could further erode vaccine confidence at a time when vaccine messaging must be clear.\n\nBad news for the US and the world\n\nOne of the reasons Kennedy poses such a threat to public health in the US and globally is his lack of trust in science. He believes a narrative can be crafted by picking and choosing any study that fits with his world view, regardless of its quality.\n\nIn addition, he personifies the bad-faith tactics of conspiracy theorists globally, “selling” the flawed premise that any assertion is valid until others prove it false.\n\nWhat the world needs now is a safe pair of hands leading public health in the US. Someone who is guided by evidence – not someone who promotes anti-science propaganda and conspiracy theories.\n\nHassan Vally is an Associate Professor of Epidemiology at Deakin University.",

        "fullContent": "Oct 8, 2024; New York City, New York, USA; Philadelphia Phillies first baseman Bryce Harper (3) hits an RBI single in the eighth inning against the New York Mets during game three of the NLDS for the 2024 MLB Playoffs at Citi Field. Mandatory Credit: Brad Penner-Imagn Images\n\nSign up for our email newsletter to stay up-to-date on the latest local sports news throughout Philadelphia.\n\nFour months ago, the Phillies limped to an unsatisfactory conclusion to the 2024 season. After winning 95 games and earning a bye in the National League playoffs, they were clipped in the NLDS against a red-hot New York Mets team. Losing to a rival in the postseason is tough enough—but to watch them sign the biggest free agent in recent memory after the season only adds to the pressure Philadelphia’s franchise is feeling.\n\nAfter a surprising run to the World Series in 2022, followed by big spending and big expectations, they have fallen one round earlier each season since losing to the Astros 3 years ago. As the top of the National League continues to grow stronger through big spending, Philadelphia already did their spending over the last few offseasons. With a core getting closer to their mid-30s and a few key players nearing free agency, the club’s championship window is getting smaller.\n\nPhiladelphia’s infield was seemingly set before the offseason even began. While there were rumblings of potential trades involving third baseman Alec Bohm, none of those rumors turned into truth, and the Phillies will rely on their homegrown third baseman to find some consistency in his last year of team control.\n\nPSN is breaking down each position group for you to get ready for Spring Training, and today we bring you our thoughts on Philadelphia’s infield. Starters, depth options, and what they need to do to reach the promised land.\n\nPhillies Starters\n\nBarring a significant injury or a last-minute, unexpected trade, Philly’s starting infield is locked up. Bryce Harper will enter his second season as a first baseman, Bryson Stott will once again man the keystone, Trea Turner will take his place back at shortstop, and Bohm will be the everyday third baseman.\n\nHarper is the de facto captain of the offense. The two-time MVP is the best hitter in Philadelphia’s lineup and one of the best of his generation. After a few injury-marred seasons, Harper played in 145 contests during the regular season—the most since his first season donning the red pinstripes. For the first time in a long time, Bryce will have nothing major to deal with coming into a season.\n\nHe’s healthy, he isn’t learning a new position like last year, and there’s no questioning those two things in the media—it is obvious he is ready for the season and has certainly found his place on defense. After a midsummer downswing, Harper finished 2024 strong, and that carried into the playoffs. Harper will be ready to show that he’s still one of the best hitters in all of baseball.\n\nBryson Stott is entrenched as the Phillies second baseman. In his age-26 season, Stott was a finalist for the National League Gold Glove after amassing 7 Defensive Runs Saved—good for fourth among NL second basemen. After taking a big step forward offensively in 2023, Stott got off to a slow start in 2024 and never really found the rhythm he had just the year prior. His average and slugging were both down in all scenarios, but most concerning was his success against left-handed pitching all but vanished. The fourth-year player was stuck between two approaches last season, so he will focus on finding consistency during Spring Training.\n\nAug 15, 2024; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA; Philadelphia Phillies shortstop Trea Turner (7) hits a single during the first inning against the Washington Nationals at Citizens Bank Park. Mandatory Credit: Bill Streicher-USA TODAY Sports\n\nTrea Turner was signed as a superstar shortstop, and he can find himself there once again, despite his struggles defensively. Not known as a Gold Glove-caliber fielder, the Phillies likely still expected more than what the 31-year-old has given them in the field. At the end of last season, Tim Kelly from On Pattison broke down some of the $300 million man’s struggles in the field. Since joining the Phillies, Turner has -26 defensive runs saved (DRS) and -8 outs above average at shortstop. Over that two-year period, Turner has rough defensive marks no matter how you look at it:\n\nHis -26 DRS is tied for the worst mark among defenders at any position (per FanGraphs)\n\nHe’s had -8 outs above average (OAA), which is 5th worst among SS\n\nHis .960 fielding percentage ranks him the 2nd worst SS\n\n3rd in throwing errors (18)\n\n2nd in fielding errors (22)\n\n2nd in total errors (40)\n\nThe coaching staff will work with Turner on improving his defense to the levels he reached prior to joining Philadelphia. While his position isn’t changing in the field, he may find himself moving in the batting order. Manager Rob Thomson recently confirmed during an appearance on The Phillies Show podcast that changes are being discussed. When asked about switching the lineup around and possibly finding a new lead-off hitter, Thomson came up with just one name:\n\n“I think you’re probably talking about Trea [Turner],” said Thomson.\n\nMy prediction is that Turner finds himself moving to the top of the order, while Kyle Schwarber moves down to bat cleanup. In order to keep the right-left-right-left pattern, this would put Harper in the No. 2 slot in the lineup. That would likely lead to Bohm batting 3rd.\n\nSpeaking of Bohm, the aforementioned trade rumors turned out to be just that—rumors. Rob Thomson has publicly said any time he’s been asked that he spoke with his third baseman and made clear that they were not actively shopping him, but that the Phillies owed it to themselves to hear out anyone who called about him.\n\nAlec Bohm talks to @TimKellySports about his positive mindset in Spring Training. pic.twitter.com/A18Y93MZ8z — On Pattison (@OnPattison) February 13, 2025\n\nBohm was an All-Star for the first time last season. The first half of his year was great, but he struggled in the second half while dealing with a hand injury. Despite that, he led the Phillies in doubles with 44—good for 5th in the majors—and had the 2nd most RBIs on the team. Tim Kelly had the opportunity to speak to Bohm now that players have begun reporting for Spring Training. He spoke about how the injury may have lingered more than he initially thought.\n\n“When I started hitting again in the offseason, I realized that it hurt worse than I thought it had hurt,” Bohm admitted. “But I was out there playing, so I feel like if I’m out there playing, it’s not like I can’t do anything. But at the same time, I’m sure a stronger left hand would have helped somewhere, maybe.\n\nEntering his last year under Phillies team control, he will need to have a season similar to his 2024 first half for the entire season if he wants a major payday in his first crack at free agency.\n\nSep 27, 2024; Washington, District of Columbia, USA; Philadelphia Phillies shortstop Edmundo Sosa (33) turns a double play during the seventh inning against the Washington Nationals at Nationals Park. Mandatory Credit: James A. Pittman-Imagn Images\n\nPhillies Reserves\n\nThere are 2 spots that an infielder could occupy on Philly’s bench. One will most definitely be occupied by Edmundo Sosa. The utility infielder came up big for the Phillies in 2024. In early May, he filled in admirably for Turner while he dealt with an injury. Sosa had a .972 OPS in May, one of the best numbers in all of baseball that month. He will be the primary option off the bench in the infield and when needing a pinch hitter.\n\nFrom there, you have to still account for the backup catcher and Johan Rojas being an extra outfielder off the bench. That leaves one additional bench spot. Weston Wilson, Kody Clemens, Buddy Kennedy, and newly signed Christian Arroyo will compete for that final spot. The front office has expressed wanting someone who can play both infield and outfield in that position, if possible. Wilson shows the most potential with slugging ability and speed. He does, however, have minor league options remaining, which is a disadvantage for him in the race for the final bench spot. Clemens has shown over the last few seasons that he is a major-league talent.\n\nHe has options left; he would almost certainly be claimed off waivers if the Phillies decided he was not the right guy to break camp with. Kennedy is a longer shot and is a nice depth piece, but he also has no options. He would likely pass through waivers, giving the Phillies a chance to keep him around. Arroyo is a former first-round draft pick, and while he was primarily an infielder, he does have some experience in the outfield corners at the major league level. He signed a minor league deal, so unless he significantly stands out, he will likely remain as a depth option and start the year in Triple-A Lehigh Valley.\n\nMy prediction is that Kody Clemens makes the roster out of spring. He has positional flexibility and allows extra depth to be kept in the organization without risk. Regardless of who the last man is, one thing is for sure—the infield is the strength of the offense. If Bohm can find consistency, Stott can hit closer to how he did in 2023, and the depth continues to do what they’ve done the last three seasons—they will be one of, if not the best, infields in baseball.\n\nMandatory Credit: Brad Penner-Imagn Images",

As a release notes, the evening will be a collaboration of Gullah Geechee cuisine infused with Ember & Ash’s live-fire cooking techniques, including ingredients grown at Gilliard Farms—the 50-acre homestead was purchased by Matthew’s great-great-great-grandfather and freed slave Jupiter Gilliard in 1874 for $9.\n\nWhile there, diners will be able to indulge in dishes like shrimp toast with saffron coconut rice and pickled okra; head hash terrine with fennel and citrus; smoked grouper with middlin risotto and hoja santa; sweet potato olive oil cake; and more. Seating times are 5, 6 and 7 p.m., and the dinner comes out to be $95 per person (plus tax and gratuity). Reservations are available now via Resy.\n\n“We’ve wanted to do a collaboration with longtime friends Scott and Lulu Calhoun of Ember & Ash for a while, as my ties to Philly run deep,” explained Tia in a statement. Both Scott and Tia worked with chef Marc Vetri at Lo Spiedo, and Tia was the culinary director for his nonprofit, Vetri Community Partnership from 2012 to 2014.\n\nThe Raifords, who were Culinary Institute of America grads, decided to switch gears to take their culinary skills to their historic farm in rural Georgia with a mission in mind: To “engage the world with African American foodways, revive the holistic practices of their ancestors, and help to feed their diverse community high-quality, locally-grown organic produce that are sustainably farmed.”\n\nAs a release notes, the couple believes in cultivating the land and pioneering a return to the regenerative practices of their forefathers — the Freshwater Gullah Geechee, who were direct descendants of West Africans brought to the U.S. as slaves for their expertise in rice and indigo cultivation.\n\nThis Black History Month celebration will continue with the Bookers event on the 26. Titled “A Great Migration Dinner,” Matthew will be using his skills as a historian and climate change activist to lead guests through a multi-course dinner and discussion recounting the history of the movement to the urban North by six million southern Blacks between 1910 and 1970. The James Beard semi-finalist and author of ‘Bress ‘n’ Nyam’ will also delve into how they brought their rich culinary traditions to a new life in the Northeast, Midwest, and West.\n\nHighlighted dishes span a pickled vegetable plate with Jamaican-style spinach patties, De Wata (salmon croquettes with red rice and herb salad),Win’ – Poulet Yassa (Senegalese style lemon pepper chicken with vegan teff stew), sweet potato pone with toasted walnut semifreddo and more. There will also be two De Spirits (complimentary cocktails) — a Gullah Geechie Gin Rickey or an alcohol-free hibiscus and lime spritzer.\n\n“Many African Americans’ roots can be traced to the Great Migration, including our own families,” said Cheri and Tracey Syphax from Booker’s restaurant in a statement. “We thought it would be a no-brainer to have Matthew join us for this special event, especially during Black History Month, given the fact that the namesake of our restaurant Booker Wright, is a famous waiter who worked in a whites-only restaurant in the 1960s Mississippi while also running his restaurant that catered to black customers.”\n\nThe dinner starts at 6 p.m. and costs $75 per person (plus tax and gratuity).\n\nTo find out more information on “From Georgia with Love”, visit emberandashphilly.com and bookersrestaurantandbar.com",

Sadly, when falling for friends it doesn’t always work in your favor, especially ‘after a night of Captain and Coke”.\n\nAs a group, Valendina has many influences that have impacted everything from their lyrics to their sound. Just as those influences are not tied down to a singular genre or voice, so is the case for Valendina, who has created their own unique sound. Regarding the inspiration for the sound of their latest single, one such source is a notable Philly-born band that, while no longer active, has continued to inspire musicians across the states.\n\n“For me, especially with the Philly music scene, I grew up following Modern Baseball around,” guitarist and vocalist Chase Sakers said.\n\n“Especially our earlier stuff, and definitely Ricky Bobby is very inspired by that kind of Philly basement rock. That’s kind of like my lifeblood, what I live and breathe. Everyone’s favorite aspects of that, just like grimy Philly punk. Ricky Bobby smells like stale PBR,” Chase and Karina joked.\n\nValendina will take the stage at Moonrose Vintage in Center City (1112 Pine St.) on Saturday, Feb. 22.

The plane came to a rest at the intersection of Runways 23 and 15L, the controller said. That’s not far from the start of the runway.\n\n\"Just so you’re aware, there’s people outside walking around the aircraft there,\" a tower controller said.\n\n\"Yeah, we’ve got it. The aircraft is upside down and burning,\" the medical helicopter pilot responded.\n\nWhat we don't know:\n\nIt's not yet clear how badly hurt the passengers and crew might be.\n\nAnd while it is not yet known if weather played a role in the crash, the incident happened as extreme cold and wintry conditions unfolded across the northern tier of the U.S. and in Canada. Winds were gusting to about 40 mph at the time of the crash, FOX Weather reported.\n\nNo snow was falling at the time, but the gusty winds were blowing around the more than 8 inches of snow that fell at the airport over the weekend.\n\nA Delta Air Lines flight arriving from Minneapolis crashed and flipped over upon landing at Toronto Pearson International Airport in Canada on Monday, February 17 (Credit: Mark Fitzpatrick via Storyful)\n\nWhat they're saying:\n\n\"Delta is aware of reports of Endeavor Flight 4819 operating from Minneapolis/St. Paul to Toronto-Pearson International Airport as involved in an incident,\" Delta said in a statement. \"We are working to confirm any details and will share the most current information on news.delta.com as soon as it becomes available.\"\n\nDig deeper:\n\nMonday's incident is just the latest in a string of aviation incidents that has gripped the U.S. over the past several weeks.\n\nLast month, an American Airlines jet with 60 passengers and four crew members aboard collided with an Army helicopter while coming in for a landing at Ronald Reagan National Airport near Washington, D.C. There were no survivors.\n\nA few days later, a medical transport jet with a child patient, her mother and four others aboard crashed into a Philadelphia neighborhood shortly after takeoff, exploding in a fireball that engulfed several homes.\n\nLast week, two crew members ejected from a Navy jet before it crashed off the San Diego coast and were quickly rescued by a sportfishing boat.\n\nTwo people were killed when a single-engine plane crashed shortly after takeoff late over the weekend from a small airport east of Atlanta.\n\nThe backstory:\n\nEndeavor Air, based in Minneapolis, is a subsidiary of Delta Air Lines and the world’s largest operator of CRJ-900 aircraft. The airline operates 130 regional jets on 700 daily flights to over 126 cities in the U.S., Canada and the Caribbean, according to the company’s website.\n\nThe CRJ900, a popular regional jet, was developed by Canadian aerospace company Bombardier. It’s in the same family of aircraft as the CRJ700, the type of plane involved in the midair collision near Reagan National Airport on Jan. 29.",

His parents are speaking out in hopes of finding the owner of the dog and seek justice. The family says Philly police will investigate.\n\n\n\nA seven-year-old boy is recovering from more than 1o0 stitches after he was attacked by a dog.\n\nHis parents are still searching for the animal's owner, who they want to be held accountable.\n\nThey spoke to FOX 29's Steve Keeley.\n\nWhat we know:\n\nHendrix Brown is a tough Philly seven-year-old talking about the dog that bit his face and hands, where now a hundred stitches help heal those awful bite wounds.\n\nThe dog was running around unleashed near his home in the Rushwood Apartments in Northeast Philadelphia.\n\n\"He was just so scared. Screaming, screaming, screaming. He thought he was gonna die. He was screaming, 'I think I'm gonna die,'\" said Joslyn Gutierrez, Hendrix's mother.\n\nThis happened Thursday at around 5 p.m.\n\nThe child was outside with friends, neighborhood kids, and his brothers.\n\n\"The kid from the neighborhood ran in and said Hendrix was getting attacked by a dog, so I instantly ran out,\" Gutierrez said.\n\n\"The dog had first come up to the boys, sniffed them, then started to walk away, right? Then came back at you? And then just started to attack him,\" she added.\n\nA neighbor's surveillance camera captured the dog running around without a leash, with its owner following behind, and has not been seen or come forward since.\n\n\"I'm just shocked that there are human beings out there that would just leave a seven-year-old child there bleeding and not want to do what's right. I'm just disgusted, but I'm also very happy with the people who've shown support for Hendrix and had his back through everything, which is huge and makes us feel great,\" said Jordan Brown, Hendrix's father.\n\n\"I just saw blood everywhere, cuts all over his face. I see the owner, who I believe was hugging the dog on the ground, and that's all I personally remember. I was just really making sure he was okay. All the adults that were around were getting towels and making sure we were stopping the bleeding,\" said the mom.\n\n\"He has over 50 stitches in his face right now. He has bite marks next to the cheek, the lips, next to the ears right here. His lip was split open and some bite marks here. His left hand was completely exposed on the top, so you could see all the bite marks up and down the hand,\" Gutierrez explained.\n\nWhat's next:\n\nHendrix goes back for his next evaluation Tuesday to see how badly damaged his hands are and hopefully, how well they're healing.\n\nFOX 29 left a phone message with the apartment complex office where Philadelphia police plan to visit Tuesday to investigate.\n\nThe parents want the owners and dog found to prevent another attack.\n\n\"We do not want to see this happen to another child. That would be devastating, so who knows, next time they might not make it through. So definitely don't want to see this happen again,\" said the dad.",

        "source": "https://www.fox29.com/",
        "fullContent": "The Brief A Gallup poll found that 45% of Democrats want their party to be more moderate, an 11-point increase since 2021. Meanwhile, 43% of Republicans prefer their party's current ideology, with fewer calling for a more conservative shift. The results come after Donald Trump’s inauguration for his second term as president and Republican control of Congress.\n\n\n\nAfter losing the presidency and Senate in the 2024 election, an increasing number of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents say they want their party to become more moderate rather than maintain its current liberal stance.\n\nA Gallup poll, published last month, found that 45% of Democrats now favor a moderate shift, up from 34% in 2021. Meanwhile, 29% of Democrats still want their party to move in a more liberal direction, a five-point drop from 2021.\n\nAt the same time, Republicans are largely satisfied with their party's ideology under Trump, with 43% of GOP voters saying the party should stay the same. Only 28% want the party to become more conservative, a significant drop from 40% in 2021.\n\nWhat’s behind the shift?\n\nThe backstory:\n\nOne factor that may be influencing Democrats' preference for moderation is the party’s recent electoral losses. Following the 2024 election, Republicans took control of both the presidency and Senate, while maintaining a slim majority in the House of Representatives.\n\nFILE - Democratic leaders, including Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer, gather for a press conference at the U.S. Capitol. (Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)\n\nIn contrast, Republican satisfaction with their party's ideology may be a reflection of their support for Trump and the conservative policies his administration has begun enacting.\n\nHow views differ within each party\n\nBy the numbers:\n\nGallup's findings also reveal ideological divisions within both parties:\n\nLiberal Democrats (49% of Democrats overall) mostly want the party to be more liberal (45%) or remain the same (22%).\n\nModerate Democrats (43% of Democrats) overwhelmingly prefer a shift to the center (62%).\n\nConservative Republicans (two-thirds of GOP voters) are split: 45% favor the status quo, while 38% want a more conservative GOP.\n\nModerate Republicans are more likely to favor a centrist shift (50%), rather than staying the same (36%).\n\nThese divisions suggest that while moderate Democrats increasingly want their party to move to the center, moderate Republicans are somewhat less eager for change.\n\nWhat this means for the future\n\nThe Democratic Party's shift toward moderation could influence its strategy heading into the 2026 midterms. The party may seek to regain voter support by focusing on more centrist policies and appealing to swing voters.\n\nMeanwhile, the Republican Party appears to be more united in its current direction, with Trump maintaining strong support among GOP voters.\n\nAs both parties look ahead to future elections, their ideological shifts could play a key role in shaping the political landscape for years to come.",

However, both of the family's dogs perished in the fire.\n\nVideo captured a vehicle pulling up to the house as a suspect got out, walked towards the rear, then drove off.\n\nAbout 30 seconds later, an explosion erupted, and the house went up in flames.\n\nDig deeper:\n\nThe cause of the fire was determined to be arson, sparking an investigation that led police to a house in Rockford, Michigan, less than two days later.\n\nAn arrest warrant was obtained for 21-year-old Harrison Jones, who was taken into custody with apparent burns on his arm.\n\nOfficials say Jones is the ex-boyfriend of a woman from Michigan who had been in an online relationship with a male resident in the Bensalem house since 2023. However, they say a motive is still being investigated.\n\nCourt documents say Jones was supposed to drive his ex-girlfriend to meet the man.

It is by the grace of God and the help of all those individuals that we made it out of our home safely and survived. While we lost everything, including our beloved pets Trey and Jett, we're forever grateful for the swift and courageous response from the Bensalem Police Department, Firefighters, EMS, medical professionals, and of course the Bucks County Detectives, all who cared for us in the aftermath and since this tragedy.

This has been one of the darkest and most difficult times in our lives, however, the kindness and love we've received from so many around us has given us so much hope and inspiration. The messages, donations, and pure kindness have lifted us up when we've needed it most.

CEO Steve Huffman said paid subreddits are \"coming\" and currently \"in the works.\" Reddit has had trouble generating profit and went public last March.\n\n\n\nA new feature is expected to roll out on Reddit later this year that could put some content behind a paywall.\n\nReddit’s co-founder and CEO Steve Huffman spoke more on the idea of paid subreddits in a recent company Ask Me Anything (AMA).\n\nHere’s what to know:\n\nWhat is Reddit?\n\nThe backstory:\n\nReddit is a technology and social network company that was founded more than 20 years ago. It is a sought-after space for internet discussions of any topic within communities, also known as subreddits.\n\nReddit has more than 100 million daily active users, Huffman said last week , who visit the site to discuss a range of topics from silly memes to existential worries, as well as to get recommendations from like-minded people.\n\nDespite its popularity, Reddit has had trouble turning profit since it was founded in 2005. It’s been looking for ways to boost revenue, and went public in March of last year.\n\nBy the numbers:\n\nBy tech industry’s standards though, Reddit remains small for a company that has been around since 2005.\n\nLast year, Reddit’s annual revenue generation was just below $1 billion. For comparison, Meta boasts an annual revenue of $135 billion.\n\nMeta had a market value of more than $1.2 trillion in 2024. Reddit’s market value was priced at $6.4 billion when it went public last March.\n\nRELATED: TikTok returns to Apple, Google app stores after temporary removal\n\nPaid subreddits\n\nWhat we know:\n\nHuffman has talked about the idea of paid subreddits before, and mentioned that when asked about it again in a recent AMA alongside Chief Operating Officer Jen Wong and Chief Financial Officer Drew Volleror.\n\n\"That one’s coming. We’re working on it as we speak,\" Hoffman said.\n\nA paid subreddit would put a paywall, of sorts, around designated content, meaning that only members who pay could access that subreddit, or \"community,\" and see its content.\n\nWhat we don't know:\n\nHoffman didn’t elaborate on the timeline users can expect for the paid subreddits.\n\nHe also didn’t indicate how much users could expect to pay for some content, or if the amount would be fixed by Reddit or perhaps set by the creator.\n\nRELATED: Facebook fact-checking to be replaced with X-style community notes\n\nWhat's next:\n\nHoffman spoke on some other new key features that Reddit users can expect for 2025:\n\nPaid subreddits\n\nImproved search results\n\nReddit Answers, which uses AI to summarize search results from Reddit’s user base\n\nLaying the foundation for an eventual marketplace",

        "fullContent": "NBA All-Star weekend returns to Los Angeles beginning February 13, 2026, for its 75th anniversary.\n\nThe star-studded main event will be held on Sunday, Feb. 15, 2026 at the Intuit Dome, home of the Los Angeles Clippers, for the first time.\n\nIn addition, the NBA will host fan events at other venues, including the Kia Forum in Inglewood and the Los Angeles Convention Center in downtown LA.\n\nTicket Information:\n\nThere are currently two options available for those interested in purchasing NBA Experiences Packages. Fans have the option of securing a $500 deposit and will be able to purchase their package before the general public.\n\nThe second option is to join a waitlist and an NBA Experiences representative will notify fans once packages go on sale.\n\nThe NBA Experience Package includes:\n\nA Ticket for Saturday night’s events\n\nA game ticket to the 75th NBA All-Star Game\n\nNBA Exp Lounge\n\nNBA Legend Meet & Greets\n\nTickets for individual events are expected to be released at a later date.\n\nClick here for more information.\n\nWhat they're saying:\n\n\"Clipper Nation, we ready. Intuit Dome—it’s gonna be live in there. I’m excited for the world to get an opportunity to see how beautiful that establishment is,\" said 11-time NBA All-Star, James Harden, in a press release. \"We’re a year out—we’re ready now—but we’ve got a year to prepare, and make sure it’s flawless for everybody to see.\"\n\n\"We want this to be the penultimate basketball experience,\" Clippers owner Steve Ballmer said when the event was announced last year.\n\nPREVIOUS COVERAGE: Los Angeles to host 2026 NBA All-Star weekend at Clippers' new arena in Inglewood\n\nWhy you should care:\n\nNBA All-Star Weekend 2026 is just one of the many sporting events that will allow Los Angeles to showcase itself as a host city ahead of the 2028 Olympics.\n\nSUGGESTED COVERAGE:\n\nThe mid-season showcase reaches fans in more than 200 countries and territories in more than 50 languages.\n\nThe other side:\n\nThe NBA All-Star Game has been heavily criticized in recent years as it fights for relevancy.\n\nWith a new format and Kevin Hart taking on a hosting role, the 2025 event in San Francisco was no exception.\n\n\"By the end of the night, the basketball was an afterthought, with an uncompetitive championship final secondary in the minds of viewers to everything that was going wrong on their TVs,\" wrote Jason Owens with Yahoo! Sports.\n\n\"I think maybe we should focus on some other things than All-Star,\" Denver Nuggets center Nikola Jokic said, as reported by ESPN. \"I think it's always going to be like this so we should accept it.\"\n\nDig deeper:\n\nNext season marks the seventh time NBA All-Star Weekend will be hosted in Los Angeles. It was last held in the LA area in 2018, and the City of Angels has also hosted the event in 2011, 2004, 1983, 1972 and 1963.\n\nIt’s also worth noting every All-Star MVP during the LA games was named to the NBA 75th Anniversary Team. Those elite players were:\n\nLeBron James (2018)\n\nKobe Bryant (2011)\n\nShaquille O’Neal (2004)\n\nJulius Erving (1983)\n\nJerry West (1972)\n\nBill Russell (1963)\n\nBy the numbers:\n\nNBA All-Star Weekend is expected to have a massive impact on LA's economy. While numbers from last weekend aren't available, the 2024 event in Indianapolis generated over $403 million, the NBA confirmed.",

The two had been under surveillance several days.\n\nBauckholt was killed in the gunfire, along with 44-year-old Border Patrol Agent David Maland.\n\nYoungblut was taken into custody and faced weapons charges.\n\nThe investigation of the murdered agent revealed the gun used was purchased by a person of interest in the double homicide of Rita and Richard Zajko.\n\nAuthorities identified that person of interest as Michelle J.

The owner, Shakeira Turner, is speaking out about being bullied by unhappy neighbors.\n\n\n\nTrouble has arisen for a newly opened Center City restaurant, with the business owner claiming she is being bullied by neighbors who simply aren't happy her business is there.\n\nFOX 29's Alex George spoke with the owner about what has been happening.\n\nWhat we know:\n\nChubby Chicks restaurant on Walnut Street just opened up two months ago, and in that time, they say they have found dead rodents left at their door, received complaints to their landlord, and heard comments that the business doesn’t belong in the \"prestigious\" neighborhood.\n\nWhat they're saying:\n\n\"My life savings, my home, all of that is wrapped up into this business, so it's not just, 'Oh, if I have to go,' no, it would be devastating,\" said Shakeira Turner, the owner.\n\nChubby Chicks just opened at 1111 Walnut Street two months ago. It's a place where people come to eat brunch and celebrate.\n\n\"We do karaoke on the weekends on Saturdays and Sundays. It is so much fun. It is inclusive. You come here and be yourself, and that is what everything is about here,\" Turner said.\n\nBut since opening, Turner says things haven’t been great.\n\n\"We are basically not too welcomed here. I thought that we would be, and I thought maybe this would be a good addition to the street,\" she said.\n\nShe says the neighbors have made several complaints to the landlord, requiring her lawyer to get involved.\n\n\"They are saying that we are playing unusual music and that we are playing riffraff coming out of here, and that is just not true,\" Turner explained. \"We are open from 8 a.m. to 3 p.m. during the week, and they were saying that we are playing music until 2 a.m. We are not even here. Even going as far as saying that one of us was on the roof of their building at 2 a.m., just putting in false claims to my landlord, which really stirred up some issues.\"\n\nShe says she has even had one-on-one confrontations.\n\n\"I even had someone tell me to my face, 'How did I get here? Did I use my drug dealer baby daddy money?' So it's hurtful. It's extremely hurtful,\" Turner said.\n\nSince then, she says issues have continued, including stolen signs, food left at her back door, someone entering and flooding the basement multiple times, and leaving dead rodents at the storefront.\n\n\"Someone has left a rat three times in front of our building. After us getting them up, cleaning them up, thinking it was a fluke, it was every single day,\" she said.\n\nA video detailing the situation at Chubby Chicks is gaining traction on social media, asking for the community to come and support the business.\n\n\"It’s unfortunate and it’s disheartening in the time we live in, so I just wanted to hold her close and show her that the community is here to support her,\" said Dr. Afia, a content creator.\n\nWhat's next:\n\nFOX 29 has reached out to the property manager and have not yet received a response.",

        "fullContent": "The Brief Donald Trump attended the Daytona 500 for the second time as president, continuing his tradition of engaging with sports audiences. His presence highlights NASCAR's conservative-leaning fan base and his broader effort to align with American sports culture. Drivers, including Chase Elliott, acknowledge the significance of a president attending the event: \"It certainly brings a lot of eyes.\"\n\n\n\nPresident Donald Trump attended the Daytona 500 on Sunday, marking his second appearance at NASCAR’s most prestigious race as president.\n\nSpirit of NASCAR will 'fuel America's Golden Age'\n\nWhat we know:\n\nPresident Trump is back in Daytona Beach for The Great American Race. It's the second appearance at the race as president. His first visit was in 2020 while running for reelection. That year, he served as grand marshal, delivering the command for drivers to start their engines and making a dramatic entrance with an Air Force One flyover.\n\nFor this trip, Air Force One departed from Palm Beach International Airport shortly after noon, carrying Trump, his son Eric, grandson Luke, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy, Interior Secretary Doug Burgum and his wife, Kathryn. Several members of Congress were also accompanying him, according to the White House.\n\nTrump also thrilled NASCAR fans in the stands with another Air Force One flyover before he rode in the presidential limousine onto the Daytona International Speedway.\n\nTrump has made a point of attending major sporting events, having recently become the first sitting president to attend a Super Bowl. His presence at college football games and UFC fights, along with his well-documented passion for golf, further underscores his efforts to align himself with sports culture.\n\nWhat we don't know:\n\nIt remained unclear whether Trump had any official role at the Daytona 500 this year, as he did in 2020 when he was grand marshal. The extent of his involvement in pre-race ceremonies or interactions with drivers has not been disclosed.\n\nThe backstory:\n\nTrump’s relationship with NASCAR extends beyond his appearances at the Daytona 500. In 2018, while in the White House, he honored NASCAR Cup Series champion Martin Truex Jr. and Furniture Row Racing. More recently, in May of last year, he attended the Coca-Cola 600 at Charlotte Motor Speedway, a major race in the swing state of North Carolina, as a former president and reelection candidate.\n\nTrump has often spoken about his admiration for the sport and its fans, praising the courage of drivers and the patriotic spirit of NASCAR events. His presence at Daytona aligns with his broader strategy of cultivating support among sports audiences.\n\nBig picture view:\n\nTrump’s appearance at the Daytona 500 reinforces his ongoing effort to maintain visibility among sports fans, particularly those in key political battlegrounds. With NASCAR’s fan base traditionally seen as conservative-leaning, his presence at the event could bolster his appeal among a segment of voters who value his brand of patriotism and showmanship.\n\nHis attendance follows a recent pattern of high-profile sports event visits, including last weekend’s Super Bowl. These appearances, coupled with his history of engaging with NASCAR and other sports leagues, reflect a continued strategy of associating himself with American sports culture.\n\nImage 1 of 9 ▼ DAYTONA BEACH, FLORIDA - FEBRUARY 16: Air Force One is seen for U.S. President Donald Trump's visit to the NASCAR Cup Series Daytona 500 at Daytona International Speedway on February 16, 2025 in Daytona Beach, Florida. (Photo by Mike Ehrmann/Getty Images)\n\nWhat they're saying:\n\nDuring a 2020 interview with Fox News, Trump spoke about his admiration for NASCAR and the Daytona 500, calling it a \"legendary display of roaring engines, soaring spirits and the American skill, speed and power that we’ve been hearing about for so many years.\"\n\n\"The tens of thousands of patriots here today have come for the fast cars and the world-class motorsports,\" Trump said at the time. \"But NASCAR fans never forget that no matter who wins the race, what matters most is God, family and country.\"\n\nChase Elliott, a NASCAR driver, acknowledged the significance of having a sitting president attend the Daytona 500. \"One of our biggest days of the year is special,\" he said. \"It certainly brings a lot of eyes and a different perspective to what we do down here for this race.\"\n\nDaytona 500: What to know:\n\nThe Daytona 500 race is held on Sunday, Feb. 16, at Daytona International Speedway in Daytona Beach, Florida. The race started at 1:30 p.m. (It was moved up an hour due to the potential for weather on Sunday afternoon).\n\nHow can I watch the Daytona 500?\n\nThe Daytona 500 airs on FOX and FOX 35 Orlando. The race started at 1:30 p.m. (It was moved up an hour due to the potential for weather on Sunday afternoon).\n\nWatch on TV or stream on FOX Local. FOX will then jump in with pre-race coverage of its own on TV.\n\nHow long is the race?\n\nThe Daytona 500 is a 500-mile race. Daytona International Speedway is a 2.5-mile track, which means it takes 200 laps to hit the 500-mile milestone.\n\nDaytona 500 Forecast: Is it going to rain?\n\nIt will be a warm and windy day in Central Florida, especially up the Interstate 4 corridor. Wind gusts are expected to be between 35-40 mph. Temperatures will be in the 80s.\n\nA cold front is expected to move through Daytona Beach in the afternoon and early evening hours, which would be during the Daytona 500 race.
