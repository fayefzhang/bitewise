        "content": "Phillies center fielder Johan Rojas has not played defense yet in spring training games because he's dealing with a sore right shoulder. Read more\n\nDisclaimer: What you are about to read isn’t clickbait.\n\nSorry, but if you’re scrolling for sensational headlines or stop-the-presses stories, Phillies camp isn’t the place for you. Trust us, we’ve looked under every palm tree. But the lineup is set and the rotation is full, so nobody’s throwing elbows for an everyday job. Everyone’s (mostly) healthy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat passes for news, then, is high jinks between ex-teammates over robot umpires, technology that is being tested in spring training but won’t be deployed in games that count until 2026, at the earliest. Otherwise, it’s a drama-free zone.\n\n» READ MORE: How important is batting order? As the Phillies experiment with their lineup, let’s look at the numbers.\n\nWell, mostly. There are baseball decisions pending, even if they don’t qualify as attention-grabbers. From a wide-open competition for the final bench spot (or two) to a backup catcher duel to the eighth seat in the bullpen, back-of-the-roster questions abound.\n\nThe Phillies didn’t play Monday, one of only two days off before camp breaks on March 24, which gave us a chance to take a breath and consider what we’ve already seen and what we’re looking forward to over the next three weeks.\n\nA few questions to ponder:\n\nWho are the righty-hitting outfield options?\n\nFor three years, the Phillies have spent spring training debating whether Brandon Marsh can hit lefties well enough to play every day.\n\nThis year, they might have no choice but to find out.\n\nBecause Johan Rojas, who could share center field with Marsh, tweaked his right shoulder in winter ball, according to manager Rob Thomson, and has been limited to hitting. The Phillies insist they’re unconcerned. Rojas is expected to resume throwing this week and has made 13 plate appearances in five games as a DH.\n\n» READ MORE: The Phillies hope to see more production from Brandon Marsh against lefties. But will he get enough chances?\n\nBut what if Rojas needs more time to get ready? Or what if the Phillies prefer that he get everyday at-bats in triple A rather than facing only lefties in the majors?\n\nBehold the outfield experiment with Edmundo Sosa.\n\nSosa, a utility infielder, is getting time in left field and center field, an idea that the Phillies flirted with last year but didn’t follow through on after Sosa reached base at a .336 clip with four homers and an .841 OPS in 32 games while filling in at shortstop for injured Trea Turner.\n\n» READ MORE: Justin Crawford is a polarizing prospect. But it’s set up for him to get a chance with the Phillies soon.\n\n“I feel much better. I’m seeing the ball much better,” Sosa told reporters after playing center field Saturday against the Tigers. “I’m seeing the angles much better. My reactions are quicker.”\n\nMaybe Sosa is a righty-hitting option in the outfield. Maybe not. Weston Wilson had the inside track on a bench spot, but a strained muscle in his side will land him on the opening-day injured list. Cal Stevenson is on the 40-man roster, and prospect Gabriel Rincones Jr. has three homers in 12 at-bats. But like Marsh and Max Kepler, they bat from the left side.\n\nIt’s possible the Phillies could make a move for a righty-hitting outfielder before camp ends, á la two years ago when they acquired Cristian Pache on the eve of opening day. Even so, there aren’t many out-of-options outfielders who bat from the right side.\n\nMaybe, then, this is the year that Marsh finally gets a run of playing time against lefties. He batted .192 with a .552 OPS in 90 plate appearances against lefties last season.\n\nHow does Taijuan Walker fit on the pitching staff?\n\nFor weeks, Phillies officials gushed over how well Walker threw the ball in bullpen sessions and live batting practice.\n\nIn his first spring-training start, he backed it up.\n\nWalker’s fastball velocity averaged 92.9 mph — and topped out at 93.9 — Sunday against the Blue Jays, a notable jump from his first start last spring when he barely cracked 90 mph on only three pitches. He had more life on his signature splitter and looked athletic on the mound.\n\nThe whole thing was … well … encouraging.\n\n» READ MORE: What do the Phillies do with Taijuan Walker? Here are the three likeliest outcomes.\n\nIt’s a long way from here to March 24, so the Phillies will keep Walker stretched out as a starter and their fingers crossed that he keeps pitching well and that they don’t need him. Because barring injury, Zack Wheeler, Aaron Nola, Cristopher Sánchez, Ranger Suárez, and Jesús Luzardo have rotation spots locked up.\n\nIn that case, where does Walker fit?\n\nTalk about first-world baseball problems.\n\nNo team ever complained about having too much pitching. If Walker continues his encouraging spring, the Phillies might find a match in a trade before the end of spring training. But the veteran righty is coming off a humiliating season in which he posted a 7.10 ERA. And he’s owed $18 million in each of the next two seasons.\n\n» READ MORE: Bryce Harper, TikTok sensation, knows the clock is ticking on the Phillies to win a World Series\n\nThe Phillies do have a vacancy in the bullpen. None of the top holdover contenders on the 40-man roster — Tyler Phillips, Max Lazar, and Michael Mercado — has made a strong first impression. Devin Sweet, acquired in the offseason from the Tigers, is intriguing. Nonroster righty John McMillon popped triple digits on the radar gun.\n\nBut the Phillies could use Walker as a multi-inning swingman and move righty Joe Ross, signed in December to fill that position, into more of a leverage role.\n\nStranger things have happened.\n\n“Who knows? Jobs are up for grabs, so the best guy’s going to get it,” Thomson told reporters. “If somebody else doesn’t throw well, and [Walker’s] throwing great, who knows what’s going to happen? We’ve got a ways to go here. And usually it works itself out.”",

        "content": "Saagar Shaikh and Asif Ali play the owners of a deli in Philadelphia in Hulu's new comedy series 'Deli Boys' Read more\n\nOn a quiet street in Grays Ferry, a half-naked man with a paper bag over his head and blood dripping down his chest runs out of a deli, trailed by two frantic men in aprons.\n\nRaj and Mir, who have just inherited ABC Deli after their father’s sudden death, must track down the half-dead man — armed only with a box of Philly pretzels — in their first challenge as new business owners.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile the opening scene of Hulu’s latest TV series, Deli Boys, is fictional, the deli at the center of the show is inspired by a real one on 3rd and Poplar Streets in Northern Liberties.\n\nThe 10-episode comedy set in Philadelphia, premieres on Hulu on March 6. It follows the antics of Raj and Mir, a pair of spoiled Pakistani American brothers (Saagar Shaikh play Raj and Asif Ali plays Mir), as they navigate taking over their late father’s (Iqbal Theba) deli empire — a front for trafficking cocaine, among other criminal activities.\n\nThe show is an homage to creator Abdullah Saeed’s and executive producer Michelle Nader’s Philly roots.\n\nSaeed’s formative years were spent studying at Temple University and working as a journalist at Philadelphia Weekly. “I used to live [near the deli] — they had a $3 hoagie, which is suspicious — but that’s the place I would think of [for ABC Deli].” And his script revolving around this deli spoke to Nader, who was born and raised in South Philly.\n\n“I think Philly is a magical place,” she said. “It’s a crazy place, and I think this show captures the eccentricity of Philadelphia in a way that a lot of shows don’t — I mean It’s Always Sunny does — but this is a very particular lens into it.”\n\nThe show looks into the lives of a very Philly, very Pakistani family — one that just happens to stuff bags of cocaine into achar (pickled veggies) containers at a convenience store named ABC Deli (ABCD is an informal term for American-born confused desi used to refer to South Asian Americans).\n\n“They sent me this show and I was so proud of it,” said Queer Eye star Tan France, who plays Zubair, a British Pakistani gang leader named Zubair. “Someone’s giving us a show that’s so specific — it represents us [South Asians] so beautifully. It gives us a chance to be real, fully formed humans.”\n\n“I had to audition four times for this role, and I would’ve auditioned 40 times [because] I was part of a show that was life-changing,” he added.\n\nThat excitement to represent the City of Brotherly Love is evident in the characters of Raj and Mir, a “Philly 10″ and a Drexel University alumnus in the show.\n\nA Philly 10, Shaikh and Ali explained, is all about knowing good food, lining up your beard, having a “fresh-ish” cut, being confident with multiple chain necklaces — maybe one with an Allah pendant — and nice kicks, and a real — or honorary — business degree from Drexel University.\n\n“What really makes a Philly 10 is a ride-or-die with the city — people who are unabashedly like ‘I know my city has faults like every city does but I love it and I’m ride-or-die for these people whether the team does well or the city does well — I believe in these people,” Ali added. “And I think people who don’t, those are the Philly fives (and if they eat cheesesteaks with mushrooms). Clog your arteries like the rest of us.”\n\nDespite the show being filmed in Chicago, each half-hour episode packs a lot of well-timed Philly references. There’s a joke about SEPTA, a box of pretzels, and an expired Tastykake that tips off a determined FBI agent to the deli’s illegal activities.\n\nBut the showrunners’ favorite nod to the city is in episode five at Philly gangster Chickie Lasagna’s (Kevin Corrigan) Eagles Super Bowl watch party in West Philly.\n\nAt the party, Raj and Mir break into the gangster’s collection of keepsakes — or as his daughter calls it “Philadelphia’s museum of contemporary [BS]” — featuring the very putrefied first cheesesteak, Black Thought’s original lunchbox, Vince Papale’s bar rag, Kevin Bacon’s baby tooth, M. Night Shyamalan’s original iPhone, and a gold statue of Frank Rizzo’s head.\n\n“Our favorite is the one about Rizzo — it’s the Super Bowl and we obviously conjured the Eagles winning from that episode,” Nader said. “With the Rizzo of it all and the Tastykakes, even though we were in Chicago, this is still a love letter to Philly.”\n\n‘Deli Boys’ streams on Hulu starting March 6.",

        "source": "https://www.inquirer.com/",
        "content": "Once named Montgomery County's best dive bar by Yelp, Buckets is now smoke-free. The owners put in a new ceiling to help clear the air. Read more\n\nWhen a massive fire at Abington’s SPS Technologies sent smoke billowing over the township last month, several bars and restaurants in the shelter-in-place radius closed, but one stalwart remained open: Buckets Tavern, Jenkintown’s long-standing dive bar, where last call is at 1:45 a.m. seven nights a week, and Miller High Life is $3 all day, every day.\n\nAnyone familiar with Buckets probably didn’t bat an eye at the bar’s decision to stay open; it’s one of the area’s few remaining smoking bars, so its regulars are accustomed to some haze.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs of this weekend, that’s no longer the case. For the first time in its 54-year tenure and 17 years after the institution of Pennsylvania’s Clean Indoor Air Act, Buckets has gone smoke-free. The West Avenue bar closed last week to install a new ceiling and spruce up the place with fresh paint, tables, and chairs. It reopened March 1.\n\n“It’s just that time,” owner Joe Braman said. “We have people come in to our bar, turn right around, and walk out.”\n\nBuckets’ managing partner, Matthew Martin, said that while the tavern’s employees were excited for the switch, they approached the move pragmatically with their most loyal customers. “We care about our regulars, and we discussed it with them. But we let them know, it’s time for us to make the change,” Martin said. “We feel that they’ll be back. They’ll just go outside and smoke, like they do everywhere else.”\n\nIt’s ultimately a business decision. “There’s more nonsmokers than smokers. It’s a percentage,” Braman said. “Kids today, they didn’t grow up with smoke. Their parents didn’t even smoke.” (As of last year, just 11% of U.S. adults smoke, according to a Gallup poll, the lowest since the firm began surveying cigarette use in 1944. For adults 18 to 29, that number drops to 6%.)\n\nA cash-only bar, Buckets stands out among the more polished newcomers that have sprung up in Jenkintown. There’s the Keep Easy, specializing in craft cocktails and mead; Human Robot, serving up some of the city’s best IPAs and lagers along with excellent Mexican food from James Beard-nominated chef Dionicio Jimenez; and , pairing pizza with classic cocktails, craft beer, and affordably priced wine. Compared to low-key local watering holes like the Drake Tavern and King’s Corner, Buckets feels more weathered, its food and drink menu slimmer. (Indeed, Buckets was able to remain a smoking bar for so long because food accounted for less than 20% of its sales.)\n\nBecause of Buckets' late hours — the kitchen’s open till midnight, 12:30 a.m. on weekends — it has a following among hospitality workers who want to get a drink after their shifts, but some fellow bartenders’ business had started to taper off. They cited the lingering smoke, which was pervasive even if no one in the bar was lighting up. “As they get older, they said they can’t tolerate it as much,” Martin said.\n\nBuckets was the first place Braman, 73, had a drink when he turned 21 — “or 18, whatever it was back then,” he said. Back then, the bar at 810 West Ave. was the Yorkshire House. “They had the best roast beef sandwiches in Montgomery County. They had ham and beef they sliced right behind the bar. People would come in for the ham and the beef sandwiches, couple beers, and off they go,” he remembered.\n\n“Back to work in those days,” Martin laughed.\n\nJohnny Martin (no relation to Matthew) bought the bar and renamed it Buckets in 1971, and as Braman recalls, it was an immediate success. “Johnny Martin, on a weekly basis, he’d pump more draft beer out than any bar in Montgomery County,” Braman said. “People were hanging out the door.” Buckets attracted a student crowd from nearby colleges like Penn State Ogontz, Beaver College (now Arcadia University), and Temple Ambler.\n\nBuckets was briefly featured in an episode of The Goldbergs, whose creator, Adam F. Goldberg, grew up in Jenkintown (like Braman and Martin). “He was gonna do a whole episode about when they tried to sneak into Buckets when they were 18,” Braman said.\n\nBraman and Matthew Martin took over the bar in 2004. Braman also owned Hollywood Tavern, near Rockledge, until last year. (Smoking is still permitted there.)\n\nMartin, 55, started working at Buckets in the ’90s, back when the premium cable channel PRISM still had a lock on broadcasting many area sports games. “There was no cable in the city — Comcast wasn’t there. So it was busy almost every night because everybody would come up to the suburbs to watch the Phillies, Flyers, and Sixers games,” Martin remembers. “Every night was a good night.”\n\nBut that’s long since been the case, and it’s weighed on Braman at times. “This is my parking lot out back, and it’s packed on Friday and Saturday night. And Buckets is empty. They’re at a movie, they’re at 211, they’re at Drake. They’re every place but Buckets,” he said, referring to the Hiway Theater and the former 211 York (now Newbolds).\n\nGoing nonsmoking is the first step toward amending that. The small crowd at Buckets on Sunday afternoon seemed to be enjoying the freshly painted digs. They nursed beers and mixed drinks as they gathered around the L-shaped bar to watch spring training; everyone cheered and the bartender rang a bell suspended above the bar when the Phils scored. The air was clear. Mini tacos made a wonderful midafternoon snack.\n\nMartin reported a steady turnout throughout reopening day. “Only two people walked in and walked out because they forgot the rules,” he laughed. “Everybody was happy there was no smell and complimented how well the place looked. People stayed longer.”\n\nMartin is planning to let the cook experiment with different food specials for a more diverse crowd, even if he suspects the bar’s wings (10 for $12.95) and cheesesteak ($10.50) will still rule the day. He’s hopeful more folks will walk into Buckets and stay put. (It’s not the type of dive bar where a stranger turns heads, I can attest.)\n\n“Hopefully now community people will come in, you know. Don’t be scared now to come in!” Martin said, laughing. “There’s no more excuses.”\n\nBuckets Tavern at 810 West Ave., Jenkintown, is open 11 a.m. to 2 a.m. Monday through Saturday, noon to 2 a.m. Sunday.",

It’s a bit of a funny place to be. Where there once were crowds, there is only me and my neighbor talking to one another while parked in the middle of the street. Who will notice, or care?\n\nI’d be lying if I didn’t point out that until maybe this week, the weather has been challenging. The wind! Day after day of a chilling ocean or bay wind, oof. But also, this winter has produced lovely snow down the Shore, a magnificent and soothing site on the beach, maybe one of the most beautifully surprising sights there is. There were snowboarders on the dunes, cross-country skiers on the beach, kids using boardwalk ramps as sledding hills. Nor’Easter Nick Pittman says Cape May got 18 inches this winter and Atlantic City got 13. Plus, people were seeing snowy owls, long-tail ducks, and bald eagles.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUnexpectedly, I got a funny thing this winter at the Shore: visitors! Two sets of relatives who would typically come in summer found their way to me during winter (thank you, in one case, to Atlantic City for hosting this month’s massive U.S. Futsal Northeast Regional Championship youth indoor soccer tournament). Guess what, the Shore is a great place to visit no matter the season (whether the heat in my house is, say, sub-optimal is another question). My little relatives and I climbed Lucy the Elephant, made cold-weather sand castles, gathered and painted shells, inspected horseshoe crabs on the beach, even finished a game of Monopoly, in which I landed in jail seven times and went bankrupt on a hotel-lined Boardwalk. Sounds familiar, eh? Imagine the astonishment of my 7- and 4-year-old grandnephews when they learned the Monopoly board is based on the streets of … Atlantic City!\n\nMassive shoutout to Trish at Hannah G’s and Sally at Tony’s Baltimore Grill for treating my peeps like they were cherished locals, and, now that they’re on an offseason first-name basis with waitresses at two iconic Shore restaurants, I guess they are.

Keep those pineapple martinis flowing.\n\nAnd keep scrolling for offseason news, an interview with AC Leef’s Miguel Lugo, reader thoughts on Ocean City, and the saga of the Cape May County toll bridges, which are going all E-ZPass on April 1.

Product manager Miguel Lugo, 38, a native of the Bronx and former chef at Borgata, cited Anthony Bourdain’s loving view of A.C. (”...the bones, the skeleton of this city are beautiful,” Bourdain said) and said the city felt like family after his brother died. He gave us his best recommendations.\n\nFavorite beach: Atlantic City. Chicken Bone Beach.\n\nFavorite summer breakfast: DeMarco’s. Turkey bacon, egg and cheese on a croissant, a little cream cheese spread on the croissant.\n\nPerfect beach day: Usually Sundays, we go on the beach. Some people go to church. I go to the beach on Sundays with the family. We’ll have lunch packed, hit the beach.\n\nPerfect night: Walking the Boardwalk, hitting casinos up. Life in A.C. is pretty cool, do a couple concerts, get a nice cheesesteak at Pizza King.\n\nBest sandwich: Spanky’s. I’m getting Italian, regular with everything. It’s a staple in Chelsea Heights.\n\nWhen summer approaches: … I feel like the grand opening of AC Leef on Valentine’s Day. A lot of people are coming in, and they’re proud of us. We’re on the verge of breaking even. People thought all dispensaries will lose a lot of money. That’s a dogfight on Atlantic and Pacific Avenues. This summer, spring, 4/20, we’re really gonna rock out.\n\nIt wouldn’t be the Jersey Shore without: The Steel Pier.\n\nBest things for kids: The Showboat: the indoor waterpark, the Lucky Snake.\n\nSurfing or fishing? I’m actually a skateboarder. Skate AC is right around the corner at Sovereign Avenue on the inlet side.\n\nSunrise or sunset? Sunset. There’s a great sunset in Chelsea Heights going toward Ventnor. Purple in the sky.\n\nShore pet peeves: My pet peeve is there’s a stigma around A.C. This is nowhere near Vegas. It’s its own town, has its own culture, 50 races within 48 blocks. People outside of Atlantic City have so much to say about Atlantic City. Coming from the Bronx, the concrete jungle, now I’ve got a beach, the longest Boardwalk in the world. The salt air helped me with my asthma. There’s something about this place if you look at it.\n\nYour Shore memory\n\nDecember’s newsletter about changing Ocean City brought many responses, some nostalgic, many clear-eyed. (Note: Eustace Mita is said to be “tweaking” his plans for Icona in Wonderland.)\n\nRandi Hand wrote: My family has owned a South end beach house since 1954. Ocean City retained its charm for many years but now feels like an overpriced, overcrowded tourist trap. What makes a “family“ resort? I think it is one that is friendly and affordable. It is certainly not the mobbed boardwalk and beaches, obscenely high rental prices and overabundance of wealthy snobs and vendors who cater to them.\n\nLes 1414 wrote a poem: Goodbye Ocean City/It is such a pity/No longer can we stay/It’s become too much to pay/We will vaca in another city.\n\nSend us your Shore memory!

        "content": "Eagles cornerback Darius Slay celebrates the victory over the Kansas City Chiefs in Super Bowl LIX. Read more\n\nLess than a month removed from their Super Bowl victory, the Eagles are releasing one of the starters from the rout of the Chiefs.\n\nCornerback Darius Slay might return at a reduced salary, of course, but two NFL sources confirmed Monday that the team is cutting him loose. Slay, 34, hopes to play another year after making the Pro Bowl in six of his 12 NFL seasons. He would prefer to play here or in Detroit, where he spent the first seven years of his career.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBig Play Slay made an impact here as an anchor at cornerback, breaking up 56 passes and posting nine interceptions in five seasons. The Eagles appear to have options at the position with Quinyon Mitchell on one side, Kelee Ringo waiting in the wings, and Cooper DeJean in the slot.\n\nAnd Slay could still be back. In the meantime, Howie Roseman is clearing out some salary-cap space and moving on.\n\n— Jim Swan, @phillysport, sports.daily@inquirer.com.\n\nIf someone forwarded you this email, sign up for free here.\n\n❓ Where does Darius Slay rank among the Eagles’ all-time great cornerbacks? Email us back for a chance to be featured in the newsletter.\n\nThe starting lineup is mostly set and so is the starting pitching, so this spring training has been mostly drama-free for the Phillies. There are still questions to ponder in Clearwater, though. The Phillies are short on right-handed-hitting outfielders. Could this be the year that Brandon Marsh finally gets a run of playing time against lefties? And is Taijuan Walker’s resurgence for real?\n\nLarry Bowa answered a few questions himself in a sit-down with Scott Lauber. Bowa is already a fan of Phillies prospect Aidan Miller.\n\nIt’s the busiest week of the year to be an NHL general manager’s phone, and Danny Brière’s cell figures to be among the busiest.\n\nWith coveted veterans like Scott Laughton and Rasmus Ristolainen, Brière has some tough decisions to make. Will he stick or twist with two pillars of the team’s culture? Jackie Spiegel sat down with the Flyers GM last week to discuss all things trade deadline.\n\nSpeaking of Ristolainen, the rugged Finn isn’t paying much attention to the rumors linking his name with a move.\n\n“It’s one of those things I can’t really control,” Ristolainen says. “So I don’t really bother my mind with it. I just come in every day and work hard.”\n\nTyrese Maxey has been playing with a sprained finger on his right hand, and it has shown on the score sheet. Maxey made only two of 14 shots Saturday in a win against the Warriors, but he’ll keep on plugging away.\n\n“He came out for walk-through with no tape on it,” coach Nick Nurse said. “I said, ‘Where’s the tape?’ And he said, ‘Forget that tape, man.’ I said, ‘Feeling better?’ He said, ‘Nope.’”\n\nMaxey’s suffered a back contusion in the third quarter and never returned in the Sixers’ 119-102 loss to the Portland Trail Blazers.\n\nJalen Milroe and Jalen Hurts have a lot in common beyond sharing a first name.\n\nBoth starred at the University of Alabama, both are dual-threat quarterbacks, and both entered their respective draft processes with question marks about their ability as passers.\n\nHurts, the recently crowned Super Bowl MVP, has answered those questions and then some. Now can Milroe prove the doubters wrong? Milroe, who has long looked up to Hurts, is using him as inspiration as he prepares for the NFL draft.\n\nWorth a look\n\n🧠 Trivia time\n\nWho was the last Eagles cornerback to be named a first-team All-Pro? First with the correct answer here will be featured in the newsletter.\n\nA) Eric Allen\n\nB) Troy Vincent\n\nC) Lito Sheppard\n\nD) Asante Samuel\n\nWhat a Run! traces the remarkable journey that was the 2024 campaign, from Saquon Barkley’s 2,000-yard breakout season in his first year in Philly to Vic Fangio’s formidable defense to the exhilarating playoff wins against the Packers, Rams, and Commanders that paved the way for revenge against the Chiefs in the Super Bowl.\n\nFeaturing electrifying stories and photos from The Inquirer, this commemorative book takes fans from Week 1 in São Paulo, all the way to hoisting the Lombardi Trophy in New Orleans. What a Run! is available at Barnes & Noble, on Amazon, and at other retail outlets. Or you can order your copy here.\n\nWhat you’re saying about the Phillies\n\nWe asked you: Who will be the most valuable Phillie this season and why? Among your responses:\n\nI think it will be between Harper and Turner. Barring injuries I am expecting good years from both of them. — Jack H.\n\nMy money is always on Harper. Extremely talented player who is clutch in the big moments and is the heart and soul of the team. — Kathy T.\n\nI think the 2025 MVP will either be Wheeler, Harper, or Turner. I think Zack will have another outstanding year especially if one of the potential 5th starters really comes through and takes some of the workload off him and the other three. I think both Bryce and Turner were not 100% pleased with 2024 and are ready to really turn it on this season barring injuries. It will be Turner’s 11th and Bryce’s 14th seasons so they both know the clock is ticking for them personally as well as for this current group of Phillies. Long shots are Nola and Bohm. If you named a MVP at AS time last year it would have been Bohm. This will be my 77th season with the Phils so time is running out for me as well. — Everett S.\n\nHot on the heels of the Eagles’ Super Bowl LIX championship, The Inquirer’s hit podcast, unCovering the Birds with Jeff McLane, announces another live taping — and you’re invited.

Read more\n\nFour law firms want to merge their class-action lawsuits against SPS Technologies over last month’s four-alarm factory fire in Montgomery County that led to school closures, halted SEPTA trains, triggered evacuations, and prompted Abington officials to declare a disaster emergency.\n\nThe lawsuits were brought on behalf of a school bus driver for Abington School District, co-owners of an auto service business that is less than a mile from the SPS facility, and a resident in neighboring Jenkintown whose apartment was engulfed in smoke and has experienced coughing and chest pain.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe firms asked a Philadelphia Court of Common Pleas judge to consolidate the three lawsuits against the aerospace parts manufacturer because they “arise from the same transaction or occurrence, involve common questions of law and fact, and concern substantially the same set of parties, witnesses, and documents,” according to a court filing.\n\nMerging the lawsuits would reduce the costs of litigation, prevent duplicative efforts, and prevent inconsistent verdicts, the court filing said.\n\nThe complaints accuse SPS of “failures to inspect, properly maintain, and/or operate its facility” and say the company failed to “uphold industry standards,” causing damage to “hundreds if not thousands of persons.”\n\nSPS did not respond to a request for comment.\n\n» READ MORE: Inside volunteer firefighters’ grueling effort to battle the SPS Technologies factory blaze\n\nAttorneys from Philadelphia-based firms Saltz Mongeluzzi Bendesky and Levin Sedran & Berman would litigate the case with lawyers from Tennessee-based Stranch and Jennings & Garvey and New York-based Coleman Bryson Phillips Grossman.\n\nThe firms’ attorneys designated to lead the case did not respond to requests for comment.\n\n“I think there are legitimate concerns that people’s health and safety may have been impacted,” Patrick Howard, the Saltz Mongeluzzi Bendesky attorney on the case, told The Inquirer last month.\n\nAt least one other class action that is not part of the consolidated cases is pending in the Philadelphia Court of Common Pleas. It’s not clear whether that class action will also be consolidated.\n\nA webpage is dedicated to the class-action lawsuit on the website Saltz Mongeluzzi Bendesky, which represented victims of high-profile cases, including the 2013 Salvation Army Building collapse and the 2023 Port Richmond explosion on New Year’s Day. The webpage provides information to people who are potentially impacted and looking to be part of the litigation.\n\n”If the Court formally decides the case can proceed as a class action, you will get a notice advising you of your rights,” the webpage says.\n\nSPS is owned by the Precision Castparts unit of Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Corp.

        "source": "https://www.inquirer.com/",
        "content": "Josh Verne at the James A. Byrne United States Courthouse In August. At the time he was fighting charges of lying about investments to his wealthy Main Line friends and neighbors. On Monday, he pleaded guilty to fraud charges. Read more\n\nStart-up founder Josh S. Verne pleaded guilty Monday to federal fraud charges for diverting millions that he raised from his Main Line friends and neighbors to support his expensive lifestyle, instead of investing the money in his former smartphone- and laptop-leasing site, Ownable.\n\nVerne, 47, was charged with fraud in a multi-count grand jury indictment unsealed last summer. He pleaded guilty to all three counts of securities fraud, 10 of the 22 original counts of wire fraud, and a charge of aggravated ID fraud. He had initially pleaded not guilty. The government dropped other wire fraud charges and charges of witness intimidation and retaliation, as part of the plea agreement.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nVerne, who formerly owned homes in Gladwyne and Ventnor, was represented by federal public defenders. He faces a minimum of two years in federal prison for the ID fraud and a maximum of 242 years for all the charges under federal guidelines.\n\nDespite the lengthy terms laid out in guidelines by Congress, white-collar fraudsters are seldom sentenced to more than a few years. Verne’s sentencing was tentatively scheduled in June before District Judge John Frank Murphy.\n\n“No one can guarantee what sentence I will impose,” Murphy warned Verne before accepting his guilty plea and a pledge not to appeal.\n\nReciting the charges to which Verne had pleaded, Assistant U.S. Attorney Jerome Maiatico told the court that “to finance a lifestyle he could not afford,” Verne in 2016 made an initial presentation at the Main Line home of an investor whom people familiar with the case identified as David Adelman, owner of Campus Apartments, co-owner of FS Investments, and the leader of the Sixers’ recent attempt to build a new arena.\n\nAccording to the government, Verne at that time and later lied about raising tens of millions by selling his previous companies, including Home Line Furniture Industries (Chuck’s Bargain House). That business, based in Northeast Philadelphia, was run by Verne’s family and his cousins. After a failed attempt to pivot to online distribution, Home Line ceased operations in 2011.\n\nVerne also forged and presented Adelman and other investors with a phony Goldman Sachs statement purporting to show he had more $50 million in assets at that Wall Street investment bank, prosecutors said.\n\nAdelman, identified in the federal indictment as “Investor A,” was fooled by the presentation and eventually invested or lent a total of more than $2 million to Verne, according to prosecutors. His interest gave Verne “instant credibility” and helped convince others to invest, they said.\n\n“I appreciate the work that the U.S. Attorney’s Office and FBI have done on behalf of myself and other victims to make sure Mr. Verne is held accountable for his conduct,” Adelman said in a statement after Verne’s guilty plea.\n\nThe indictment, as well as an earlier Securities and Exchange Commission civil complaint that remains pending, had also accused Verne of exaggerating the value of his college content-sharing site FlockU and installment-payment service Workpays.me in memos to investors seeking funds for Ownable, an online rent-to-own business that was to lease laptops and smartphones to people who couldn’t afford to buy them.\n\nVerne also lied about putting a few million dollars of his own money into the business, according to prosecutors. In fact, he borrowed cash from his employees and forged one of their names to sell shares without the employee’s permission, keeping the cash.\n\nIn a statement read by assistant federal public defender Michael McCrossen, Verne, while admitting to the charges for which he pleaded guilty, added that FlockU was not “a scam.” According to Verne, FlockU was a college student-oriented business that he and his partner, Adelman, started in good faith, but it failed to thrive.\n\nAlso, “for a period of time, Ownable was a viable business,” McCrossen said, acknowledging that Verne concealed the extent of the company’s later financial troubles. He said Verne had agreed to step down as Ownable’s chief executive when confronted by its independent directors. Verne also maintained that he did “make a personal investment into Ownable but agrees he exaggerated the extent.”\n\nInstead of using all the investors’ money to build Ownable into a viable business, prosecutors say Verne used investors’ funds to pay for decorators at his “showcase” Ventnor home, private jet rides, political and charitable contributions, his daughter’s bat mitzvah party, country club payments, and his other investments.\n\nIn its separate complaint, the SEC said Verne spent more than $9 million of the $31 million “to buy a vacation home, pay for private travel, and pay his children’s private tuition,” and otherwise fund an expensive lifestyle, while also diverting more than $5 million in later investors’ funds to “Ponzi-like payments” to some of his early investors to fool them into thinking the business was profitable.\n\nInvestor lists obtained by The Inquirer identified the state-funded Ben Franklin Technology Partnership of Southeastern Pennsylvania, developer Bart Blatstein, Fanatics owner Michael Rubin, investor and restaurateur David Magerman, lawyers William Harvey and Roger Braunfeld, and other prominent Main Line and Philadelphia residents among the investors Verne duped.\n\nAlso roped in were Florida-based subprime-mortgage lender Jay N. Levine, Crestar private-investments owner William S. Green, and Ohio-based advertising business owner Kimberly Blackwell, among others outside the region.\n\nVerne had been out on bail pending trial on condition he stay around Fort Lauderdale, where he had been living, and in the Philadelphia area, home to his extended family and former wife and their children.\n\nIn January, he persuaded Judge Murphy to release him from wearing an ankle monitor, so he could get physical therapy in advance of a hip replacement. Prosecutors agreed Monday to leave Verne free on those terms until his sentencing.",

        "source": "https://www.inquirer.com/",
        "content": "The Flyers GM also revealed that the team hasn’t gotten too far with any of the team’s key restricted free agents — Cam York , Noah Cates, Tyson Foerster, etc. — and that those talks will ramp up after Friday’s deadline.\n\nBrière again hesitated to label any Flyers “untouchable,” before adding the caveats that some players would be largely unattainable due to asking price and others due to no-trade clauses.\n\nWhile Brière says the Flyers aren’t shopping Laughton, he says he has received plenty of interest in the versatile forward.\n\nWill Brière and the Flyers’ brass stick or twist? The Inquirer caught up with the Flyers GM late last week in Pittsburgh for a wide-ranging interview. Part 1 will focus on the upcoming trade deadline while Part 2 will get into some bigger-picture topics like the team’s future, the idea of “big-game hunting,” and updates on prospects like Aleksei Kolosov.\n\nAs the clock ticks closer and closer to 3 p.m. on Friday, Flyers general manager Danny Brière is racking up the Comcast phone bill ahead of the NHL’s trade deadline. The Flyers, who have consistently said they are prioritizing the future, sit in a rather interesting position among the league’s 32 teams, as they remain in playoff contention — four points out of the second wild-card spot — but also have veteran players like Scott Laughton who are in-demand around the league.\n\nA: That has not changed from Day 1 since this new management came in. We’ve been very open, our door’s open. We have to listen. It’s our duty to listen. We would not be doing this organization a service if we closed doors. As I said earlier, everything has a price but obviously there’s players that probably have more value and they’re much more unattainable than others. But there’s not enough value elsewhere sometimes that makes sense to trade. And then there are a few guys that have a no-trade clauses, so those are usually off the market as well.\n\nQ: Are you open to trading anyone on the roster at this point — outside of one or two untouchables — to move this team forward and to get better?\n\nA: It’s very quiet at this time. There’s not much going on there. There’s just been a lot going on with the 4 Nations tournament and now the trade deadline. And you try to be careful, too, in season, to not mess too much with the guys. So it’s been quiet. We’ll probably start opening discussions some time after the trade deadline has passed.\n\nA: Yeah, absolutely. Both of these guys, it worries you to remove them from this roster for what they bring. They’re a big part of our identity, the way they play, the way they carry themselves. So yeah, it’s fair to say they’re in a similar position.\n\nIt’s still a little too early to tell. Nobody’s under pressure at this time; I expect that to start happening probably Tuesday or Wednesday, when things will start heating up on that front, as far as the pressures around the league. And a lot will depend, too, on which players other teams are willing to put on the market and who decides to be sellers and buyers. So I’m not quite sure yet where the market is going.\n\nA: Well, I can’t give you much one week to the trade deadline. What I can tell you is, we’re not actively shopping him. But there’s teams that would love to have a Scott Laughton on their roster come playoff time. But on our end, we also feel he’s an important part of our team. So we’re trying to figure out — you know everything has a price in life — what’s the price that we feel we can’t turn down.\n\nQ: Once again there’s been a lot of talk about Scott Laughton. Where do things stand with him? Are you getting phone calls?\n\nA: Not just my vision. I don’t work alone. I don’t have all the answers, and I don’t pretend to. I have a lot of good people around me that I trust, that I rely on, and it’s done as a team. But definitely, I think it’s slowly the vision that we see for the future, that it is starting to take shape more and more. The patience is the toughest part — even for me — the patience to do it the right way, and we all try to keep each other in check.\n\nQ: You already traded Morgan Frost and Joel Farabee. Are you starting to see the roster take the shape of your vision?\n\nSo I think the biggest difference is the experience that I’ve acquired in the past year, building relationships, and understanding the other GMs a little better and the way they do business because everybody’s different.\n\nA: I’ve been around the trade deadline my whole life, not in this position, but as a fan, then as a player — my name had been in the mix — and then again as a fan and then in the front office in different roles. Now, in this role, I think one of the biggest differences is you’re really controlling everything that’s going on.\n\nQ: This is now your second trade deadline as GM. What did you learn from the first one that could help you this year?\n\nWill Brière and the Flyers’ brass stick or twist with veterans like Scott Laughton and Rasmus Ristolainen? The Inquirer caught up with the Flyers GM late last week in Pittsburgh to talk all things trade deadline.\n\nAs the clock ticks closer and closer to 3 p.m. on Friday, Flyers general manager Danny Brière is racking up the Comcast phone bill ahead of the NHL’s trade deadline.\n\nTo trade or not to trade, that is the question.\n\nAs the clock ticks closer and closer to 3 p.m. on Friday, Flyers general manager Danny Brière is racking up the Comcast phone bill ahead of the NHL’s trade deadline. The Flyers, who have consistently said they are prioritizing the future, sit in a rather interesting position among the league’s 32 teams, as they remain in playoff contention — four points out of the second wild-card spot — but also have veteran players like Scott Laughton who are in-demand around the league.\n\nWill Brière and the Flyers’ brass stick or twist? The Inquirer caught up with the Flyers GM late last week in Pittsburgh for a wide-ranging interview. Part 1 will focus on the upcoming trade deadline while Part 2 will get into some bigger-picture topics like the team’s future, the idea of “big-game hunting,” and updates on prospects like Aleksei Kolosov.\n\n» READ MORE: What will the Flyers do ahead of the trade deadline? Here’s where Scott Laughton, Ramus Ristolainen, and others stand.\n\nQ: This is now your second trade deadline as GM. What did you learn from the first one that could help you this year?\n\nA: I’ve been around the trade deadline my whole life, not in this position, but as a fan, then as a player — my name had been in the mix — and then again as a fan and then in the front office in different roles. Now, in this role, I think one of the biggest differences is you’re really controlling everything that’s going on.\n\nIn the past, you make suggestions like when Chuck [Fletcher] was the GM, but you don’t know what the discussions are about. So last year was my first time in those discussions. It’s like anything else, you acquire experience along the way. Like when another GM tells you, ‘Well, I’m not there yet,’ you know what that means or ‘We need an extra couple days’ or it could be for cap situations, roster situations. There’s so much to inquire and go through.\n\nI think having been through it last year, I feel much more comfortable in it and not chasing the deals quite as much. You kind of know the ebbs and flows of certain parts of the season. ... I feel we’re just starting to ramp up again.\n\nSo I think the biggest difference is the experience that I’ve acquired in the past year, building relationships, and understanding the other GMs a little better and the way they do business because everybody’s different.\n\nQ: So what does it mean when a GM says to you, ‘I’m not there yet?’\n\nA: It could be many reasons. It could be because their cap doesn’t allow it, or their roster doesn’t allow it, or they have an injured player that’s about to come back. Sometimes it means that they are checking elsewhere, basically, to see where the price is at elsewhere. So those are the things that I think I probably understand a little better now than I did a year ago.\n\nQ: You already traded Morgan Frost and Joel Farabee. Are you starting to see the roster take the shape of your vision?\n\nA: Not just my vision. I don’t work alone. I don’t have all the answers, and I don’t pretend to. I have a lot of good people around me that I trust, that I rely on, and it’s done as a team. But definitely, I think it’s slowly the vision that we see for the future, that it is starting to take shape more and more. The patience is the toughest part — even for me — the patience to do it the right way, and we all try to keep each other in check.\n\nQ: John Tortorella said the other day he’s still trying to figure out who’s going to be on the bus and who is here for the long haul. What does that mean to you? You probably have a different perspective, correct?\n\nA: Yeah, we all do. And for me, too, the journey there is also important. For example, Sean Walker last year, he was on the bus. He was part of what we were establishing as a culture, and he had a big say in it. Erik Johnson is a big part of it now. In four or five years from now, when hopefully we’re contenders every year, Erik is probably not going to be here. But he’s an important piece at this moment.\n\n» READ MORE: Flyers mailbag: Will the Orange and Black make moves as the trade deadline approaches?\n\nI understand what John is also saying, and I agree with him, but there’s guys that are [meant] to help us get there and there’s guys that will be there for the long haul and the long future, hopefully. We’re figuring out along the way. And there’s probably going to be some guys that we think will be on the bus in three, four, or five years from now, and we’ll get there, and things can change. So there could be some changes along the way as well.\n\nQ: Tortorella has one more year in his contract and has said himself he’s “on the back nine” of his career. So how do you determine who is on the bus when it will probably be a different coach who could have a different style of play down the road?\n\nA: And you don’t know who is going to be that player down the road or that coach. And it’s the same thing that applies here. All I can tell you at this time is we feel Torts is the right person to lead us and lead these guys toward what we’re trying to establish here. Time will tell. I really don’t know.\n\nQ: Do you look far down the road?\n\nA: Everybody has bumps and bruises along the way and some ups and downs in their career. We’re trying to figure out who will be able to lead us down the road. There’s going to be a few players that are going to be probably different than what we feel today. But we can’t really control that, like if a guy gets an injury or is not able to play at the same level down the road. So we’ll have to adjust along the way. It’s like anything else in life. Nothing’s perfect, nothing’s a straight line. We know we’ll have to adjust along the way.\n\nQ: Once again there’s been a lot of talk about Scott Laughton. Where do things stand with him? Are you getting phone calls?\n\nA: Well, I can’t give you much one week to the trade deadline. What I can tell you is, we’re not actively shopping him. But there’s teams that would love to have a Scott Laughton on their roster come playoff time. But on our end, we also feel he’s an important part of our team. So we’re trying to figure out — you know everything has a price in life — what’s the price that we feel we can’t turn down.\n\nIt’s still a little too early to tell. Nobody’s under pressure at this time; I expect that to start happening probably Tuesday or Wednesday, when things will start heating up on that front, as far as the pressures around the league. And a lot will depend, too, on which players other teams are willing to put on the market and who decides to be sellers and buyers. So I’m not quite sure yet where the market is going.\n\nQ: Is it the same for Rasmus Ristolainen?\n\nA: Yeah, absolutely. Both of these guys, it worries you to remove them from this roster for what they bring. They’re a big part of our identity, the way they play, the way they carry themselves. So yeah, it’s fair to say they’re in a similar position.\n\nQ: Where do things stand with contract negotiations with the restricted free agents: Cam York, Noah Cates, Tyson Foerster, and Jakob Pelletier?\n\nA: It’s very quiet at this time. There’s not much going on there. There’s just been a lot going on with the 4 Nations tournament and now the trade deadline. And you try to be careful too in season, to not mess too much with the guys. So it’s been quiet. We’ll probably start opening discussions some time after the trade deadline has passed.\n\n» READ MORE: Flyers forward Scott Laughton is having some fun with being the center of trade rumor attention\n\nQ: Are you open to trading anyone on the roster at this point — outside of one or two untouchables — to move this team forward and to get better?\n\nA: That has not changed from Day 1 since this new management came in. We’ve been very open, our door’s open. We have to listen. It’s our duty to listen. We would not be doing this organization a service if we closed doors. As I said earlier, everything has a price but obviously there’s players that probably have more value and they’re much more unattainable than others. But there’s not enough value elsewhere sometimes that makes sense to trade. And then there are a few guys that have a no-trade clauses, so those are usually off the market as well.",

        "content": "Retired federal worker Roseanne Sarkissian of Philadelphia (right) came to show support during the Save Our Services day of action event, at Independence Mall in Philadelphia, on Wednesday, February 19, 2025. Federal workers and everyday Americans came together to protest Elon Musk's push to gut federal services and impose mass layoffs. Read more\n\nThree weeks ago Jessica Fair was walking the grounds of Valley Forge Historical Park as the park’s architect, planning how to protect the more-than 250-year-old buildings on site.\n\nTuesday night she’ll sit in the gallery of the U.S. House of Representatives alongside dozens of fellow terminated federal employees when President Donald J. Trump gives an address to both chambers of Congress in a quasi-State of the Union, just six weeks since taking office.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“I’m the daughter of a public school teacher and a coal miner from Western Pennsylvania,” said Fair, U.S. Rep. Chrissy Houlahan’s guest and a mother of three from Chester County. “Never in a million years did I imagine I’d be joining my congresswoman in D.C., but I’m doing my best to step outside of my comfort zone to tell my story to try to humanize what’s happening.”\n\nDemocrats, with little ammunition to fight against the president’s agenda and the rapid cuts he has made to the federal government, have been trying to show the harm caused to laid-off employees and their families and to Americans who could be impacted by cuts to services.\n\nThe Tuesday night address will feature that strategy on its biggest stage yet as Democrats try to turn public opinion against Trump and the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE.\n\nPresidential speeches have long provided an opportunity for members of Congress to make political statements — either in favor of the government in power or against it.\n\nTuesday’s speech will add a layer of intensity as people watch a speech given by the leader of the government that just laid them off.\n\n“Awkward,” is how Jay “Smitty” Smith, who was fired last month from the Taxpayer Advocate Service, an independent organization within the IRS, predicted that Tuesday night would feel watching Trump’s speech but being unable to speak about what happened to him.\n\n“My wife will attest I sometimes have a problem keeping my mouth shut when I feel like I’m in the right and the other person is wrong,” said Smith, 50, of Havertown. “It’s human nature to want to say, ‘You messed up.’”\n\nSmith retired from the Navy after 20 years and struggled to find a job that he enjoyed until the IRS position came along about nine months ago. A disabled veteran who said he has a bad back, bad knees, and PTSD, Smith enjoyed working with his coworkers to help people experiencing financial hardship or who were improperly charged by the government.\n\nHe worked across three teams and did the job of several people only to get an email telling him that his employment “wasn’t in the best interest of the public.”\n\n“No one had a negative thing to say about me. Everybody loved me there. How am I not in the best interest of the public?” said Smith, who will attend the speech as a guest of U.S. Rep. Mary Gay Scanlon.\n\nMeanwhile, expect several Pennsylvania Republicans to bring constituents who have benefited from Trump’s executive orders or early policy moves.\n\nAnd Trump, who has made sweeping changes in just a month on the job, will likely tout the savings those cuts have generated alongside other policies like tariffs and border-security measures.\n\nIn a possible preview of what is to come in Trump’s speech, the White House on Monday announced that several major manufacturing projects would come to the U.S., including Honda’s decision to produce its next-generation Civic hybrid model in Indiana rather than Mexico and Apple’s announcement of a historic $500 billion investment that will create 20,000 new U.S.-based jobs.\n\nThe administration also announced that border crossings are down substantially.\n\n‘These cuts are impacting real people’\n\nIn addition to the IRS, there will be former employees from the Department of Education and the Department of Agriculture.\n\nSen. Chris Coons (D., Del.) is bringing Rory Badger, a veteran who served in Iraq and a USDA staffer who was fired by the Trump administration in February as part of their mass layoffs.\n\nSen. Lisa Blunt Rochester (D., Del.) invited Laura Wallace, a laid-off probationary data and research analyst with the U.S. Office of Early Childhood Development. Her husband is a disabled veteran and a probationary employee at the Veterans Administration hospital in Philadelphia, which has the couple worried that his employment could also be at risk.\n\n“We’re really nervous, right? That he could also be terminated, so he’s having to look for another job. And so the panic of, like ‘OK, we have two young kids, we have these bills, like, who’s going to carry the health insurance? What happens next?’” Wallace said.\n\nWallace, 37, was fired from her position at the Administration for Children and Families in the same month that she debuted a new system for states to report that they are using federal dollars to improve access to child care. She hopes that the presence of laid-off federal workers at Trump’s speech will humanize the impact of DOGE’s cuts.\n\n“I never met anyone who joined the federal government because they wanted to get rich, right? No, they join, they take a federal job, because they’re so passionate about the work that they do,” Wallace said. “And so I hope they can see that these cuts are impacting real people and real families, and then the downward spiral of how it’s going to impact services in all aspects of everyone’s life in this country.”\n\nHow effective the Democrats have been at growing opposition to Trump’s reductions is difficult to ascertain. Overall, Musk’s DOGE efforts to slash the size of the federal government were supported by 59% in a Reuters/Ipsos poll in February, including a third of Democratic Party voters.\n\nBut the same survey found that 58% of respondents were concerned about cuts impacting government programs like Social Security payments and college financial aid.\n\nSome Democrats are focusing on program cuts to try to put a spotlight on concerns beyond employee layoffs. Sen. Andy Kim (D., N.J.) is bringing a disability-rights activist and longtime Medicaid recipient, Kevin Nuñez, a New Jersey-based author and podcaster.\n\n“Trump and Musk have shown they have no problem cutting vital funding that helps our most vulnerable succeed; with these cuts, the disabled community will be losing access to critical programs and lifelines,” Kim said in a release.\n\nFor U.S. Rep. Dwight Evans, who represents Philadelphia, boycotting the speech is his way of making a statement.\n\n“Congressman Evans feels that Trump hasn’t earned the honor of his presence, due to things like the illegal or legally questionable actions like mass firings and refusing to deliver federal funding already appropriated by law,” spokesperson Ben Turner said.\n\nWho are Pa. Republicans bringing?\n\nU.S. Rep. Rob Bresnahan, a freshman Republican from Pennsylvania, is bringing Don Williams, the father of Officer Eric Williams, who was murdered by an inmate at USP Canaan, a high security U.S. penitentiary in Northeastern Pennsylvania.\n\nBresnahan is one of two Republicans who flipped House districts in Pennsylvania in November. The other, U.S. Rep. Ryan Mackenzie, who represents the Lehigh Valley, is bringing Michael Wargo.\n\nWargo and his wife, Sarah, are Gold Star parents from Carbon County whose son took his life after a long struggle with PTSD. The couple has worked to increase awareness of mental health and support needed for veterans in Carbon County, which has the highest rate of veteran suicide of any county in Pennsylvania.\n\nU.S. Rep. Dan Meuser, whose districts begins east of Harrisburg and extends north to the New York border, is bringing Brian Kilmeade, a cohost of the Fox & Friends morning TV show on the Fox News cable channel, which has frequently featured Trump as a guest.",

        "content": "Mimi Gravley, a community relations liaison at Strawberry Mansion High, talks to Amaya Estevez, a senior at Strawberry Mansion High School. Gravley is earning her bachelor's degree through College Unbound, a program with Philly ties that helps adult learners from underserved communities get through college. Read more\n\nMiMi Gravley works full-time, as a community relations liaison at Strawberry Mansion High. She’s also a full-time college student and juggles raising her own kids and making ends meet.\n\nGravley is smart and motivated; she wanted to earn a college degree, but life and bills got in the way. She left college once because the price tag was too high.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“You want the degree, but if you don’t have the money, you don’t have the money,” said Gravley, who grew up in Philadelphia and attended culinary school after graduating from Central High. She earned an associate’s degree at Community College of Philadelphia during the pandemic, then enrolled in a bachelor’s degree program at Eastern University before halting classes because of the expense.\n\nThis time, Gravley, 36, is on a surer route to her bachelor’s degree.\n\nShe’s enrolled at College Unbound, a college with local ties that gives adult learners from underserved communities affordable paths to graduation, with low tuition, strong supports baked in, credit for relevant life experience, a cohort model that helps keep students engaged, and impressive early results.\n\n‘Democratize access to credits’\n\nCollege Unbound began in 2009 in Rhode Island, when Dennis Littky, a founder of the educational nonprofit Big Picture Learning, joined with Adam Bush, a jazz historian with experience in higher education.\n\nThe idea, said Bush, was to “democratize access to credits. Learning isn’t something that’s only happening when you’re in a classroom, when you’re paying for it.”\n\nBush sees College Unbound as a “degree completion” school — most of its students have some college under their belt, though that’s not a requirement for enrollment. Its average student is 38; most are women of color. Many are caregivers and many have experience with the prison system, either themselves or via a family member.\n\nCollege Unbound costs about $11,000 per year, and most of its students qualify for Pell grants, which pay $7,395 of that bill. About 80% of local students attend at no cost to them, officials said.\n\nThe college owns no buildings; all classes are online or held in spaces owned by other organizations, typically with supports like food and babysitting provided. All faculty are adjunct. Students earn a bachelor’s degree in organizational leadership and change, most in under 2 1/2 years.\n\nAt first, College Unbound operated with partner institutions; in 2015, it became accredited to grant its own degrees. It currently has 500 students enrolled in Rhode Island, Philadelphia, Camden, Wilmington, Del., and Washington state, and has graduated about 500 students.\n\nMillions of possible students\n\nCollege Unbound’s Philadelphia roots date back more than a decade. David Bromley, then the director of Big Picture Philadelphia, had a conversation with Wendell Pritchett, then a member of the School Reform Commission, about Big Picture’s concept — personalized learning, real-world experiences — and what that might look like at the college level. (Pritchett is a professor at the University of Pennsylvania’s law school, and Penn’s former provost and interim president.)\n\nThe idea fascinated Pritchett, who’s now chair of College Unbound’s board.\n\n“There are 50 million people who started college and didn’t finish,” said Pritchett. “We in higher ed should be embarrassed by that and we’re not. I call it reparations — to repair a lot of the damage that higher ed has caused.”\n\nIn the Philadelphia area, 157,055 adults have some college courses under their belt, but have not earned a degree, according to U.S. Census data. Most of them are Black or Hispanic.\n\nBromley left Big Picture Philadelphia in 2021 to bring College Unbound to the area. To date, it’s had 153 students enroll through partnerships with the Philadelphia School District, ASPIRA, Philadelphia Housing Authority, and Public Health Management Corporation.\n\n“We’re really trying to find our space in the Delaware Valley, not to compete with 73 institutions of higher education. It’s to serve this niche group, this population in a super supportive flexible way that also benefits the partner,” said Bromley. More partnerships are forthcoming, he said.\n\n‘It built my resilience’\n\nA group of College Unbound students gathered digitally on a winter weeknight. It was a big day — final presentations.\n\nCollege Unbound structures its curriculum around student interests and the work they are doing in real life. The students, all paraprofessionals in the Philadelphia school system enrolled in College Unbound through its “Para Pathways” program that seeks to build the teaching pipeline by helping paraprofessionals earn credentials, talked about projects they had undertaken at their schools.\n\nDanette Swindle, who works at Sullivan Elementary in Frankford, created an after-school basketball program. Her why, she said, was the death of her cousin, killed walking to a corner store in 2021. More resources are needed for youth, she said. It wasn’t easy, but Swindle learned a lot, she said.\n\n“While I was building my after-school program, it built my resilience,” said Swindle. “I wanted to give people resources and help them navigate their daily challenges.”\n\nCollege Unbound students move through their classes in small cohorts, and those groups provide built-in supports. Classes run on eight or 16 week cycles, might run synchronously or asynchronously, and every class begins with a one-on-one meeting with a student and professor.\n\nMichael Atwell, a paraprofessional at Hancock Elementary in the Northeast, asked Swindle about lessons she learned, challenges she faced during her project.\n\n“The message is don’t give up,” Atwell said. “A denial is a delay. Revisit it.”\n\nGravley, the Strawberry Mansion paraprofessional, said College Unbound professors appreciate the layered responsibilities their students have, and know their students’ — and their stories — well.\n\n“There might be an assignment that’s late, but everybody understands that life happens, and they won’t give you a zero for no reason,” said Gravley.\n\nBut when Gravley sets a goal, she “can get tunnel vision,” she said — she has all As in College Unbound, and though the program set a graduation date of 2026 for her, she’s hopeful she can finish sooner.\n\nHer path feels like lesson for her students, and for her own kids, she said.\n\n“I told them, ‘You have to have your piece of paper, and it’s no shame getting it done in your 30s. Kudos to those who can get it earlier, but I couldn’t do it,” she said.\n\nCollege Unbound Delaware Valley is “still a baby,” Bromley said, but has a retention rate of about 95%. Nationally, students report an average salary increase of about $15,000 within three years of earning College Unbound degrees, but more importantly to Bush, 84% of alumni say they are better advocates for others and 90% believe in themselves more.\n\nHearing from students is a revelation, said Pritchett.\n\n“They’ll say, ‘I thought I was bad at college, but I realize that I wasn’t bad at college, I just didn’t have the supports I needed to be successful,’” he said.\n\nGraphics editor John Duchneskie contributed to this report.",

The victory earned the Owls the inaugural women’s Big 5 Classic title.\n\nNearly three months later, Big 5 schools are angling to secure a spot in the NCAA Tournament.

She scored 21 points in Temple’s 91-79 defeat of Memphis on Feb. 25.\n\nTristen Taylor, Temple\n\nThe sophomore point guard’s 109 assists this season make her a key player for Temple to create scoring opportunities.\n\nTaylor is one of the most productive starters on the court for the Owls. She has the highest assist/turnover ratio in the AAC, conceding just 45 turnovers this season. She averages 6.9 points.\n\nJasmine Bascoe, Villanova\n\nOn a Villanova team that brought in seven new players this season, its undeniable star is Bascoe, a freshman guard.\n\nThe 5-foot-7 native of Canada is leading Villanova (17-13, 11-7 Big East) with 16.2 points per game. Her 118 assists this season rank second in the Big East, behind UConn’s Paige Bueckers with 130. Bascoe also has a team-high 57 steals.\n\nBascoe scored a career-high 27 points Sunday in Villanova’s 70-55 loss to Creighton.\n\nMaddie Webber, Villanova\n\nAs Villanova’s top returner, the sophomore guard is playing some of her best basketball late in the season. Webber recorded a career-high 30 points at DePaul on Feb. 12. She averages 13.4 points and 2.9 rebounds.\n\nDenae Carter, Villanova\n\nA senior forward, Carter came back from an ACL injury that cost her all of last season to become an integral part of Villanova’s defense.\n\nShe is Villanova’s top rebounder at 6.6 per game. She also leads the team with 33 blocks. The Philadelphia native played her first two seasons at Mississippi State before transferring to Villanova in 2023.\n\nAshleigh Connor, La Salle\n\nWhile La Salle (9-22, 3-15 Atlantic 10) closes out a disappointing season, one bright spot for the team has been Connor, a redshirt sophomore guard.\n\nConnor joined the Explorers this season after playing her first two seasons at St. Louis. She leads La Salle with 11.3 points per game and is averaging 5.0 rebounds.\n\nAmaris Baker, Drexel\n\nBaker, a senior guard, is one reason for Drexel’s dominant 12-4 record in the Coastal Athletic Association this season. With the conference’s leading scorer on the court, the Dragons (16-10) aim to defend the CAA championship for another NCAA Tournament bid.\n\nBaker, who previously played at Kennesaw State and Harcum before transferring to Drexel last season, averages 17.2 points and 3.9 rebounds.\n\nStina Almqvist, Penn\n\nThe senior guard is completing her illustrious career at Penn (15-11, 6-7 Ivy League) as the Quakers’ leading scorer for the last two seasons. A 6-1 native of Sweden, Almqvist is averaging 17.7 points and 7.7 rebounds. She ranks third in scoring and second in rebounding in the Ivy.\n\nLaura Ziegler, St. Joseph’s\n\nZiegler, a junior forward, is averaging 18.1 points for the Hawks (21-8, 12-6) as the top scorer among Big 5 schools. The native of Denmark was a first-team All-Big 5 selection last year. Ziegler is averaging 10.8 rebounds with a team-high 120 assists and 28 blocks.\n\nMackenzie Smith, St. Joseph’s\n\nThe senior guard’s shooting from beyond the arc has been one important component of a successful season so far for St. Joe’s. She is shooting 47.2% from the field and 43.4% from three this season.\n\nSmith, a native of Nova Scotia, is the team’s second-leading scorer with 14.4 points per game. She made 5 of 7 three-pointers in a 59-50 loss to conference leader Richmond on Feb. 13.",

        "source": "https://www.inquirer.com/",
        "content": "INDIANAPOLIS — Jalen Milroe hasn’t been shy in talking about who his “true inspiration” has been in chasing a pro football career, and he took time to show love to another former Alabama quarterback during the NFL scouting combine.\n\nThe dual-threat quarterback, who finished with over 3,500 yards of offense and 36 total touchdowns (16 passing, 20 rushing) last season, is a polarizing prospect in this draft class. Milroe, a two-year starter with the Crimson Tide, struggled at times as a passer in 2024, increasing his interception percentage from 2.1% in 2023 to 3.4% last season, while his completion percentage dropped from 65.8% to 64.3%.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStill, his arm talent is undeniable and he’s an outstanding athlete and runner. Milroe ran for 32 touchdowns over the last two seasons and several scouts believe he has a chance to be the third quarterback taken in the draft behind Miami’s Cam Ward and Colorado’s Shedeur Sanders.\n\n» READ MORE: Defensive line talent will be available for Eagles, Jihaad Campbell’s big week, and other scouting combine takeaways\n\nMilroe was asked Friday at his podium session about what he can learn from Eagles quarterback and Super Bowl LIX MVP Jalen Hurts, whom he called his “big brother,” ahead of the Alabama-Michigan College Football Playoff matchup in 2023. Milroe says he frequently has phone calls with Hurts.\n\n“I think the biggest thing I learned from J-Hurts is how he kept his head down, always continuing to work. He always elevated his game, never got complacent, and all you do is see great strides from him,” Milroe said. “And I’ve got to applaud him as a person, him as a human being, because he’s definitely inspiring for a lot of quarterbacks of my image and also a lot of quarterbacks around the country. So he’s leading the way for all of us and it’s definitely a path that we’re trying to pursue as quarterbacks and that’s the best thing that I love about him.”\n\nAn added layer to Milroe and Hurts’ relationship is sharing the same agency. Hurts’ agent, Nicole Lynn, works for Klutch Sports, and shortly after Milroe declared for the draft in January, he signed with the agency. Milroe hails from Katy, Texas, while Hurts is from Houston. In 2023, Hurts, who played three seasons at Alabama before transferring to Oklahoma for his senior year in 2019, called Milroe “a very special player” before adding: “He’s a Texas kid. And he’s just continued to grow and grow and grow and it’s been really, really nice to watch.”\n\nAfter a shaky Senior Bowl week, Milroe bounced back in a big way during Saturday’s combine session that featured quarterbacks, running backs, and wide receivers, showing off his big arm and improved footwork. Milroe has been training with Jordan Palmer of QB Summit, who has tutored stars like Patrick Mahomes, Josh Allen, and Joe Burrow.\n\nIn addition to Hurts, Milroe was asked about Baltimore Ravens quarterback Lamar Jackson, whom he’s drawn several comparisons to with his explosive running ability.\n\n» READ MORE: Alabama quarterback Jalen Milroe raves about Jalen Hurts, his ‘true inspiration’\n\n“A lot of people can throw the ball, a lot of people can run, but not a lot of people can do both and that’s hard for a defense,” Milroe said.\n\n“When it comes to game planning, you’re going to keep a defensive coordinator up at night. It’s all about not being one dimensional and it’s a lot of things that other people possess, but a lot of things that I can’t do as a player. … I’m excited for what’s ahead. Lamar Jackson, definitely a quarterback I like a lot and so I just know [my ability] is definitely a threat when it comes to playing against other people.”",

        "title": "Philly probation check-ins go virtual, urine tests suspended, as Sheriff’s Office grapples with deputy shortage",
        "source": "https://www.inquirer.com/",
        "content": "Sheriff Rochelle Bilal, seen here in City Council chambers, has been shifting deputies' responsibilities after the courts in December gave her a 90-day deadline to secure the city courthouses. She had initially downplayed the severity of the crisis. Read more\n\nAt a probation hearing last Friday at Philadelphia’s Criminal Justice Center, Common Pleas Court Judge Roxanne Covington ordered a defendant to report to the city’s probation offices at Seventh and Market this week for a drug screening.\n\nThat, a probation officer responded, would not be possible.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“We won’t have any sheriffs,” the officer, John Masterson, told the judge.\n\nCovington was perplexed.\n\n“You’re saying probation doesn’t have any security?” she asked.\n\nMasterson confirmed that was the case, at least for the next week.\n\nThe reason: The Adult Probation and Parole Department, which also houses the Sheriff’s Office’s warrant unit, had been secured for years by deputies, who essentially did double duty.\n\nBut the Sheriff’s Office on Friday abruptly moved the unit and its officers to Family Court at 15th and Arch Streets to help safeguard its courtrooms.\n\nAs a result, probation officers have been forced to indefinitely replace in-person visits with virtual ones. And drug tests that took place inside the Market Street building have also been temporarily suspended.\n\nThe sudden redeployment comes as Sheriff Rochelle Bilal addresses major security lapses inside city courthouses by shuffling deputies from one unit to another.\n\nThe Inquirer reported in September that security-related incidents at the CJC and four other court buildings had skyrocketed under Bilal, who took office in 2020. The deputy shortage had left some courtrooms unsecured and caused delays in criminal trials and hearings as prisoners waited for deputies to escort them from jail cells to court.\n\nLast year, the incidents — which include violent acts, vandalism, and threats — were occurring at a rate of six every month, or a roughly threefold increase from 2019, under the previous sheriff, Jewell Williams.\n\nIn December, a panel of judges that oversees Philadelphia court operations filed a court order demanding that Bilal staff up the city’s main courthouses within 90 days.\n\nThat deadline is next week, which one courthouse official said prompted the sudden shift of deputies out of the probation department to add more security to Family Court.\n\nSecurity has improved in recent months, judges say, now that more deputies are being sent to the city’s main courthouses. But critics warn that could also lead to shortfalls elsewhere in the sheriff’s office, which has struggled to perform some of its core functions, like holding tax sales.\n\nBilal and her spokespeople did not respond to a request for comment for this article, and have not responded to any questions from The Inquirer since last summer.\n\nTens of thousands impacted\n\nLast Thursday, the First Judicial District informed probation and court officials that — effective the following day — access to the main probation office on Market Street would be restricted to employees only, due to the reassignment of the sheriff’s security detail there to Family Court.\n\n“As an interim and temporary security measure, access to 714 Market St. will be limited only to [Adult Probation and Parole Department] and Pretrial employees,” the memo reads. “As a result, all client contact with APPD and Pretrial that was previously conducted in-person at 714 Market will be conducted remotely or in the field.”\n\nIn the meantime, probationers will be expected to report to their probation officers by video call. If they don’t have video access, they can use booths at a Neighborhood Resource Center, a satellite facility that offers services to formerly incarcerated men and women. Defendants with ankle monitors will have them removed at their homes, rather than at the Market Street office.\n\nThe move, which will affect tens of thousands of people under court-ordered supervision, follows a recent violent incident at the Family Court building that saw at least one deputy injured, according to two court officials. The officials declined to be named in order to discuss matters of security frankly.\n\nLast year, in the same building, a video shared online by a Fox29 reporter showed an unconscious man lying facedown in the hallway while two other men continued to fight and a lone sheriff’s deputy struggled to break it up.\n\nBilal has repeatedly downplayed the severity of the security crisis, describing The Inquirer’s September report as akin to yelling “fire in a non-burning building.”\n\n“This pattern of fearmongering not only distorts the truth but also jeopardizes the safety and well-being of the citizens we are sworn to protect,” her office said in a statement at the time.\n\nJudges, however, had described the deputy shortage as a “disaster waiting to happen” and an “emergency situation,” while prosecutors and defense attorneys complained about cases being delayed because deputies were not available to transport jailed defendants to courtrooms from the basement of the CJC.\n\nIn December, the Administrative Governing Board of the First Judicial District filed a court order stating that the sheriff’s office’s “systemic failures” to properly staff court buildings pose an “imminent threat to the safety and health of all persons present in the courthouses.”\n\nThe panel of judges wrote that it had repeatedly tried to resolve the crisis with Bilal and her staff “to no avail.”\n\nAfter the order, courthouse security appears to have improved, judges say — at least in the city’s main criminal courthouse.\n\nStill a ‘serious shortage’\n\nRichard T. McSorley, a court administrator for the city’s First Judicial District, acknowledged last week that the sheriff had promptly responded to the court order, submitting a draft plan to the courts to “address the shortcomings of their duties.”\n\nHe said in a statement that a “reallocation of resources” within the Sheriff’s Office had led to more deputies being present at CJC.\n\n“[T]he Sheriff has made progress in providing timely prisoner transportation and increased security in our courtrooms,” McSorely said.\n\nBut Bilal has been forced to resort to reshuffling deputies from other buildings to achieve these gains because of ongoing issues with recruitment.\n\nMcSorely acknowledged that only “minor increases” had been made to Bilal’s complement of deputies.\n\n“While the FJD appreciates the progress made, both sides are well aware that there is still a serious shortage of Sheriff Deputies,” he wrote. “The Sheriff Department has provided increased security in our main courthouses, but security in other FJD or Court facilities must still be addressed.”\n\nBenjamin Lerner, a retired Common Pleas judge, questioned whether shifting deputies around would weaken the city’s probation system.\n\nHe said the overnight change to probation operations appeared to be rushed.\n\n“Subbing in-person probation officer meetings with virtual meetings is definitely not going to increase the effectiveness of probation supervision,” Lerner said. “You had all this time, and this is all you could come up with? It’s a last-minute solution.”\n\nSome court officials acknowledged that aspects of Bilal’s plan had come together haphazardly as judges ratcheted up the pressure to get more deputies into courtrooms.\n\n“We’re building the plane as we’re flying it,” said one court source with knowledge of the changes but not authorized to speak publicly. “But the plane will be flying. It’s not going to crash and burn.”\n\nStruggling to perform\n\nCourt administrators declined to comment in detail on Bilal’s other staffing changes, but court sources and observations by Inquirer reporters confirmed that deputies from other sheriff’s office units have been increasingly visible in court, apparently to beef up security.\n\nAbout one fifth of the sheriff’s 274 deputies are assigned to specialized details, like internal affairs, civil-enforcement, and warrant service, which pursues criminal fugitives and enforces protection-from-abuse orders.\n\nOn a recent weekday morning, members of some of those units were instead visible performing guard duties at city courthouses.\n\nSome departments were already struggling to perform their duties.\n\nThe sheriff’s warrant unit, for example, has lagged behind on enforcement of protection-from-abuse orders. A 2023 Inquirer report found that only 13% of PFA orders filed between 2020 and 2023 were marked as “complete” and that firearm relinquishment occurred in 16% of cases.\n\nThe sheriff’s civil-enforcement unit has also seen a major increase in its workload, following the implosion of Philadelphia’s landlord-tenant officer system. A private attorney who had been charged by the courts with enforcing most evictions bowed out last summer amid a string of high-profile shooting incidents, and those functions defaulted to Bilal’s civil-enforcement unit.\n\nWhile some judges have welcomed the increased deputy presence in courthouses, those changes are only a short-term fix.\n\nRecruiting new sheriff deputies has been difficult in recent years, as the Philadelphia police department and other law enforcement agencies boost their own hiring efforts following officer shortages brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic and social-justice protests of 2020.\n\nIn addition to increased competition for new recruits, Bilal has blamed the deputy shortage on a small annual hiring window and a lengthy training process that requires recruits to stay overnight at a facility near State College, Pa., hours from the city.\n\n“Considering these challenges, we are in the process of making it a more seamless process which will be announced,” Bilal’s office said in September.\n\nBilal did not respond to questions about whether any such changes have been made.",

        "source": "https://www.inquirer.com/",
        "content": "The Eagles’ decision to release Darius Slay on Monday should be neither surprising nor alarming. Slay’s career arc and contract suggested that this move was likely, even a formality, and no one should panic about it.\n\nThose circumstances have nothing to do with the quality of his performance over his five years with the Eagles and, in particular, his performance this past season. For a guy who could come off as a scatterbrained big mouth sometimes, who didn’t like people referring to him by his first name in part because he thought his last name sounded better, who passed out cups of his wife’s banana pudding to teammates, Slay was well respected, a leader within the locker room and especially among the defensive backs. The Eagles will miss him. The question is how much.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n» READ MORE: The NFL should tell all the crybabies complaining about the Eagles’ Tush Push to pipe down\n\nSlay was scheduled to have a salary-cap hit this year of $13.8 million, according to online database Over The Cap. By releasing him (and by designating him as a post-June 1 release), the Eagles will instead absorb a cap hit of $9.4 million. So assuming they don’t re-sign him, they’ll save a little more than $4 million against the cap. Will they re-sign him? Anything is possible, and Slay said on a podcast last month that he would be open to returning to either the Eagles or his other former team, the Detroit Lions, for one more year.\n\nBringing Slay back, even in a reduced role for reduced money, would not be without risk for the Eagles. He turned 34 on Jan. 1, and though he was excellent in 2024 — opposing quarterbacks completed fewer than 50% of their passes to receivers he was covering — a cornerback’s decline from age can be quick and steep. The Eagles were damaged by a similar development in 2023. After James Bradberry had a terrific 2022 season for them, they signed him to a three-year extension that would have been worth as much as $38 million, only to have Bradberry’s play fall off badly.\n\nSlay’s play hasn’t fallen off yet, but under Jeffrey Lurie’s ownership and Howie Roseman’s oversight of the roster, the Eagles aren’t in the habit of being reactive. Their philosophy of proaction — of calibrating which players are improving, which players are regressing or are likely to, and what the NFL’s economic situation will look like — has helped them win two Super Bowls and three NFC championships over the last eight years. In this case, they can afford to keep their options open when it comes to Slay and the entire cornerback position for a simple reason: Roseman and his talent-evaluation staff, through their decisions in the last two NFL drafts, have made defensive back one of the Eagles’ greatest strengths.\n\nIt wasn’t always this way. For a long time, the notion that the Eagles could bid farewell to a veteran cornerback such as Slay and feel confident that they could draft his replacement or might already have his replacement on the roster would have been a dicey proposition.\n\n» READ MORE: Defensive back Quinyon Mitchell can be the Eagles’ version of Darrelle Revis\n\nAfter drafting Lito Sheppard and Sheldon Brown in 2002, the Eagles were often forced to spend significant free-agent dollars or trade resources to make sure they had at least decent corners and safeties, and sometimes their choices turned out to be not so decent. Asante Samuel and Slay were terrific. Byron Maxwell and Bradley Fletcher, as just two examples, were not. Sidney Jones and Rasul Douglas were better after they left Philadelphia than they were while they were here, and the Eagles’ struggles in drafting corners who had any staying power at all perpetuated the cycle.\n\nThat cycle spun until 2023. Roseman and his scouts got Sydney Brown in the third round and Kelee Ringo in the fourth, then hit the mother lode last year with Quinyon Mitchell in the first round and Cooper DeJean in the second. A month ago, a few days before the Eagles’ victory in Super Bowl LIX, Christian Parker, their defensive backs coach, said that Mitchell has the talent and makeup to reach the same level of play as Hall of Fame corner Darrelle Revis.\n\n“He’s a very intelligent guy, and he’s very aware of himself and the things around him,” Parker said. “He really absorbed what we were trying to get done pretty quickly when he walked into the building. That was the first step. The second is he’s insulated with veterans around him, so he has the confidence to put those things into practice, whether it’s technical leverage or eye-placement progression or whatever it might be. Some young guys don’t understand how important those small things are.”\n\nMitchell does. Darius Slay helped him understand them. Three Pro Bowls with the team, a Super Bowl ring, a mentor to a budding star: The Eagles got everything they could have asked for from a man with one name. They should be able to take it from here.",

A media day was held at Lincoln Financial Field on Monday. Read more\n\nLincoln Financial Field has hosted many historical events, but on Monday, it made history as the venue for a landmark moment in women’s flag football.\n\nThe Atlantic East Conference hosted a media day for the inaugural season of women’s flag football, becoming the first conference to recognize women’s flag football as an NCAA sport.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJulie Hirshey, the vice president of community relations for the Eagles, called the players and coaches “trailblazers” for being part of “a historic moment here in Philadelphia.”\n\n“You are setting a foundation for women and what women’s collegiate flag football will become in the future,” Hirshey said. “That’s starting with you guys here today, you’re proving that football is for everyone.”\n\n» READ MORE: How girls’ flag football became a sanctioned sport in the state and what it means\n\nIn its inaugural season, the conference will field teams from Centenary, Eastern, Holy Family, Immaculata, Marymount, Neumann, and Penn State Schuylkill. In 2026, Chestnut Hill College and Marywood will join the conference.\n\nLast season, there was a one-day tournament with semifinal and championship games. Marymount won, with Immaculata hosting and Neumann and Centenary participating. This year will be the sport’s first full season.\n\n“We came up with a win last year, and that was sort of something that we prepped for a couple weeks, and then we came and we didn’t really know what to expect,” said Mia Clevano, a sophomore at Marymount. “This year, we’re trying to be more intentional. Everything we do at practice, we’re intentionally training this certain way. We’re intentionally trying to portray ourselves in this way, and I think that all goes down to what we’re trying to do, as Marymount and also as a flag football team.”\n\nNatalie Dodd, a sophomore at Immaculata, which lost to Marymount in the championship game last year, said last year’s tournament was a great experience, but there’s a lot of excitement in the growth of the conference and the sport.\n\n“Now that it’s up and running, and there’s so many more teams and [we’re] really excited [that there’s] a lot more competition,” Dodd said. “You get to meet a lot more people and learn a lot more.”\n\nBut it’s not just the growth of the conference that has Dodd and other players excited. It’s also the possibility of growth for the sport in the future.\n\n“Flag football is the future,” said Haley Price, a junior from Neumann. “You can look at the NFL trying so hard to put it out, and we’re starting this as girls and coming forward as a women-led sport, and I think that’s just super important. Try hard, and then you can inspire the next generation to take it up after us.”\n\n» READ MORE: Neumann University showcases its growth in women’s flag football with homecoming game\n\nFor Price, this next generation includes her 6-year-old niece, who said she wanted to play flag football after learning her aunt would be joining the Knights’ team.\n\n“Being able to be there and have her be able to watch this as a sport grow is just insane,” Price said. “It’s just going to continue to inspire people and inspire women to try everything.”\n\nHer coach, Nellie Mixon, a 2006 Neumann graduate, says actions like this begin to change the conversations surrounding women’s sports.\n\n“I feel like it’s a long time coming. Women should have been able to play flag football a long time ago,” Mixon said. “The rhetoric of men just believing that it’s a man’s sport kind of pushed everybody to like, ‘Nah. Women could do just as much as y’all can do,’ and in some ways, we could do it better.”\n\nWhile the introduction of varsity flag football is expected to expedite the growth of the sport, it’s also bringing a number of interests to the colleges as well.\n\nDuring a coaches and administrators panel, it was noted that recruitment has been what Holy Family coach Charles Hopkins called “surprisingly overwhelming.”\n\n“I’ve been getting waves of emails from all over the country. And I’m like, ‘How do you even know who I am? How do you even know who we are? We just got started,’” Hopkins said. “I’ve talked to parents and athletes in Alabama, in Tennessee and Colorado, in Arizona. This is really, really, huge.”\n\n» READ MORE: Girls' flag football is on the rise in Pennsylvania — with some help from the Eagles\n\nThere’s still work to be done as the inaugural season kicks off on Friday. But Hopkins took a minute to remind the athletes of all they’ve accomplished so far.\n\n“Don’t measure what you accomplish in the numbers. You’re here, you’ve already won,” Hopkins said. “This is greatness. We cannot be great without the greatness of others. You are all great. Therefore you will achieve greatness, and your greatness will waterfall down to the next set of ladies who are coming to sit in these seats, coming to wear your jersey numbers, coming to your schools.”",

        "content": "White House Staff Secretary Will Scharf stands beside the Resolute Desk as Trump signs orders on Jan. 20. Read more\n\nSince taking office in late January, President Donald Trump has issued more than 70 executive orders (EOs) But which will have the most impact on American small businesses?\n\nThree stand out, and it’s important for business owners to understand the implications.\n\nFederal spending and DOGE\n\nUsing an EO, Trump created the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, with the stated intent of rooting out waste and fraud in federal spending. Another EO has temporarily frozen all government spending while programs are being evaluated.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThese orders have created a significant amount of disruption, particularly for businesses and organizations that rely on federal funding.\n\nEmily Dowdall, president of policy solutions at the Reinvestment Fund in Philadelphia, warns that because the federal government has long been one of Philadelphia’s largest employers, there will “absolutely be ripple effects” from job losses. Fired federal workers will have less money to spend in their communities. Philadelphia had roughly 25,000 federal workers before Trump took office.\n\n» READ MORE: How Philadelphia’s probationary federal employees are coping with mass government layoffs\n\nDella Clark, the president and CEO of the Enterprise Center in Philadelphia, a nonprofit organization that provides assistance to helps minority-owned businesses and communities, also said federal spending cuts could cause businesses to lose revenues, cut back employees, and raise prices in an already competitive environment. She encourages CEOs to evaluate their customer lists and do a risk analysis of how much potential revenue they could lose.\n\n“For example, a food service vendor who contracts with university customers could be negatively impacted if their customers are no longer able to access federal funds and are forced to decrease vendor spend,” she said. “Business owners who work with large institutions should pursue contracts that are not as dependent on federal dollars.”\n\nClark is strongly encouraging her small business clients who are heavily reliant on federal contract dollars to diversify their revenue streams if they haven’t already.\n\n“Even if a small business owner isn’t directly contracting with the federal government, they should be monitoring how eliminating these agencies will affect the economy in their business sector as a whole,” she said.\n\n“There is the potential” that these cuts could result in lower taxes, Clark said, which businesses and consumers could recirculate back into the economy. But that prospect is less certain than the almost immediate local, regional, and national impacts of decreased federal funding, she said.\n\nImmigration\n\nThe president has also issued EOs on immigration.\n\nThese have called for “advanced vetting” of applicants, an end to birthright citizenship (a federal judge quickly blocked this), the use of armed forces to keep undocumented immigrants from crossing the southern U.S. border, and authorizing state and local law enforcement officials to act as immigration officers.\n\nThe loss of these undocumented workers in an already tight labor market, could make it harder for businesses to find and retain good employees, Dowdall said. She noted that many small businesses in Philadelphia are operated by immigrants or employ immigrants.\n\n» READ MORE: Neighbors angry as ICE arrests owners of popular Jersey Kebab restaurant in South Jersey\n\n“Regardless of the actual immigration status of any individual business owner or employee, targeting immigrants as a group has the potential to put a real chill on economic activity,” Dowdall said. “People are understandably concerned about being caught up in broad sweeps or simply facing heightened discrimination and violent rhetoric associated with these executive orders.”\n\nArt Gimenez, director of lending and programs at the Impact Loan Fund, which provides financing for neighborhood revitalization in Philadelphia, said many of the businesses he serves are in Kensington and are owned by immigrants.\n\n“A lot of clients aren’t aware of the laws and their rights so they’re just flat-out hiding,” Gimenez said. “They’re very afraid.”\n\nTariffs\n\nThe president has issued a number of EOs proposing tariffs on Canada, Mexico, China and other countries that would impact the cost of goods from lumber to avocadoes.\n\nClark, of the Enterprise Center, said tariffs present both a challenge and opportunity to small businesses.\n\n“Domestic producers who are currently not competitive on price due to cheaper imports have the potential to grow their customer bases and revenue,” she said, explaining that tariffs will change the cost-benefit equation of importing versus buying local.\n\n» READ MORE: How to delay, or even avoid, tariffs on a small business\n\n“CEOs of companies that are importing directly will have to evaluate how much of that cost their customers can absorb in the form of increased prices,” she said. “They would be wise to scenario plan how tariffs might impact the costs of goods and supplies moving forward as well as potentially evaluate the feasibility of switching to domestic alternatives.”\n\nNow is the time for business owners to examine their messaging and marketing materials, Clark added, to communicate “unique selling advantages such as offering higher quality goods, faster production times and local customer service availability,” she said.",

        "content": "New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection firefighters respond to a forest fire in November in Evesham Township, Burlington County. Read more\n\nNew Jersey’s wildfire season is off to an ominous start — and it hasn’t truly begun.\n\nAlready this year, the state has recorded 215 wildfires that have scorched 514 acres. That contrasts to 69 wildfires and 22 acres consumed over the same period in 2024. But wildfire season typically doesn’t start until spring, when March winds whip up fires without green vegetation to slow flames.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“That’s pretty significant,” Bill Donnelly, chief of the New Jersey Forest Fire Service, said Monday. “If things continue the way they are, we’re going to have quite a fire season on our hands.”\n\nThat comes on the heels of last year, which had extreme drought conditions that contributed to one of the worst seasons for fall wildfires many can remember. Those conditions have continued, with the fire danger listed by the Forest Fire Service as high across much of New Jersey the past week through Tuesday, although heavy rain expected Wednesday should change that.\n\nMost of the southern half the state is in either a severe or extreme drought. The counties along the Shore, and the Delaware Bayshore, have fared the worst. Cape May County has endured a rain deficit of more than eight inches over the past year and three inches over the past 90 days.\n\nSurrounding counties are in similar deficits, making conditions more vulnerable to fire when combined with the low humidity and high winds that have dominated in recent weeks.\n\n“Jan. 1 we started off busy again,” Donnelly said. “And here we are, just finishing our second month and our numbers are astronomical for the amount of fires we’ve had and the amount of acreage that’s burned.”\n\nSouth Jersey’s weekend blazes\n\nIndeed, last weekend fires broke out in Burlington and Gloucester Counties.\n\n» READ MORE: Gusts up to 50 mph in the Philly region knocked out power to more than 16,000\n\nIn Salem County, officials say a fire torched about 50 acres in Pennsville. The cause is suspicious and remains under investigation.\n\nIn Camden County, firefighters from Gloucester Township and elsewhere contained a 40-acre brush fire that ignited around 9:30 p.m. Saturday near Primrose Lane. More than 100 firefighters and first responders from over 20 state, county, and local agencies were involved. Two homes were evacuated, but none were damaged, and no injuries were reported, police said.\n\nThe largest fire, in Hopewell Township, Mercer County, ravaged nearly 300 acres off Poor Farm Road, threatening 30 homes and four businesses before being contained on Sunday. The fire originated from a downed electrical line and rapidly climbed a grass embankment and hill, continuing to spread.\n\n“Typically, 10 miles outside of Trenton you don’t see these type of wildfires,” Donnelly said. “But when you start to get these temperatures around 60 degrees, and the lower humidity, and wind-driven fires, this is what happens. That was definitely unusual for this time of year.”\n\n‘All hands on deck’\n\nGreg McLaughlin, the state’s administrator for forest and natural lands, said resources are being reallocated from various departments to address fire response needs. The Forest Fire Service operates on an $8 million budget. Gov. Phil Murphy has proposed an additional $1 million for the 2026 fiscal year budget.\n\nMcLaughlin emphasized the severity of the situation, stating, with “this excessive and incessant fire frequency and intensity, it’s all hands on deck.”\n\nIn November, Murphy declared a statewide drought warning as rainfall diminished, leading to the eruption of more than 500 wildfires that started in October into November. Water supplies from streams and reservoirs had dramatically declined, and Murphy described conditions at the time as “unprecedented,” marking the first drought warning since 2016.\n\nThe state remains under a drought warning, prompting the Department of Environmental Protection to urge the public to voluntarily conserve water.\n\n» READ MORE: How you can conserve water as Pa. and N.J. drought drags on\n\nOfficials report that the lack of rainfall has severely reduced stream flows throughout the region. Firefighters rely on streams to create fire breaks, particularly within state forests.\n\n“We anticipate staying in a … drought warning, for the next several weeks,” McLaughlin said.",

        "source": "https://www.inquirer.com/",
        "content": "File art from June 2023 when Showboat Resort Atlantic City owner and Tower Investments CEO Bart Blatstein spoke at the Atlantic City resort's Island Water Park. Read more\n\nAt the end of last month, Bart Blatstein, one of Philadelphia’s most well known private developers, was staring down a potential $25 million court judgment after he’d defaulted on a mortgage.\n\nIt was his second time in court over a default in under a year as the developer known for launching projects like the Piazza in Northern Liberties and the redevelopment of the Showboat Casino in Atlantic City has shown signs of financial strain.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile Blatstein says he secured a new loan late last month that warded off the $25 million judgment, he is still facing a million dollar property tax bill from the city. Just last year, he faced similar troubles in AC , where unpaid contractors have pursued him in court.\n\nBlatstein has downplayed the turmoil as an inevitable cost of being a high-flying developer during a downturn in the real estate cycle.\n\nHe said he was unaware of the outstanding property taxes in Philly until The Inquirer asked him about them — even though some date to early 2023.\n\n“We pay millions and millions of dollars a year in taxes, and it slipped until you brought it to my attention,” Blatstein said by phone last week. “We are doing half a billion in development right now. I’m not happy it slipped through the cracks, but it did. It’ll be resolved shortly. ”\n\nThe most recent private debts are linked to Blatstein’s acquisition and struggles to redevelop land around the former Inquirer building at 400 N. Broad St. in Center City.\n\nBlatstein acquired and then sold the historic newspaper tower to the city for the new police headquarters in 2017. Two years later, he took out a $25 million mortgage from Webster Bank against two neighboring properties that had been part of the Inquirer complex. He describes the site as the largest undeveloped property left in Center City.\n\nBlatstein says he borrowed funds to prepare a proposal to develop the garage and parking lot neighboring the new police HQ as a forensics lab — a bid he lost amid a fierce, and politicized, competition .\n\n“You hear there is going to be an RFP [Request for Proposals] for this, you assemble a team, you go through countless meetings, planning a very sophisticated state of the art forensic lab,” Blatstein said. “Isn’t it logical that the new forensic lab should be attached to the police headquarters?”\n\nBut today those lots remain empty.\n\nSome of the money from Webster was also used to acquire undeveloped land in Atlantic City, where Blatstein’s interests have grown over the last decade to include both the shuttered Showboat casino and an adjacent water park.\n\nBlatstein says that his troubles around these North Broad properties are now resolved. He and Webster Bank reached a financing deal last week, and the bank on Thursday withdrew its claim in court.\n\nThey are not signs of larger financial pressures, he says, although like the rest of the real estate industry he has found it difficult to maneuver as interest rates soared after 2022 and construction costs never fell much from pandemic era highs.\n\nA new plan for the North Broad lots will be coming this summer, he said. He would not provide details beyond saying that it will not be a high-rise, multifamily building due to the current apartment glut.\n\nMeanwhile, Blatstein says that the water park in Atlantic City is performing well, and the huge new Post Brothers apartment project at Broad and Washington — built on his land — is leasing briskly.\n\nThe developer promised an announcement about the Showboat’s future in a matter of weeks, and his plans for a new movie theater at the Riverview Plaza on Christopher Columbus Boulevard are still on track.\n\n“Sometimes timing doesn’t coincide with your plans,” Blatstein said. But “this stuff is minor and in the scope of my world, it’s tiny.”\n\n“Different machinations, different projects”\n\nBlatstein closed on the former newspaper headquarters and several adjacent parking areas in 2011 for $22.7 million. The office portion of the property was subsequently resold to the city for the police headquarters. But a parking lot and garage — 1540 Hamilton St. and 1527 Callowhill St. — were parceled off and remain under the control of Blatstein’s companies.\n\nAt the time, the nearby Community College of Philadelphia had eyed the lot as part of a residential expansion project, but like the pitch for a forensics lab, those plans never materialized.\n\nAccording to court filings, Blatstein requested and received several forbearance agreements after missing a $1 million repayment in April 2023.\n\nIn October 2024, Webster Bank bank gave a final notice of default and later filed a complaint against Blatstein to collect on some $26.2 million in principal, interest and fees.\n\nEarlier in 2024, S&T Bank sought a separate judgment against Blatstein and his company, Dickinson Square Associates, for $3.4 million after they defaulted on another loan tied to another property, at 1500 S. Christopher Columbus Blvd., which hosts a Magee medical rehab facility.\n\nThat claim was similarly withdrawn last summer.\n\nBlatstein’s companies started missing tax payments to the city on the former Inquirer parcels around the same time his lenders say they started falling behind on mortgage payments.\n\nAccording to city property tax records, he now owes more than $1 million — including back sums and taxes due at the end of March — for both properties.\n\nLast April, the city placed $309,000 in liens against Blatstein’s companies over unpaid taxes dating from 2023 on the two lots. Last month, the city issued another $339,000 in liens for 2024.\n\nBlatstein will owe another $356,000 on the land at the end of this month.\n\nHis company’s tax debts are somewhat unusual for large, high-profile Philadelphia developers. For example, his partners at Post Brothers Development had no delinquent taxes across a portfolio of more than a half dozen large commercial buildings.\n\nIn Atlantic City, Blatstein has fought to win tax exempt status — which was granted this month — after dealing with separate tax delinquency issues on the Showboat Casino properties. A string of former contractors on that project also filed suit against him last year seeking some $7 million in unpaid costs linked to the construction of a waterpark inside the gambling hall.\n\nIn Blatstein’s telling, such financial complications are just part of the real estate industry — especially in a period where Federal Reserve policy has scrambled pre-2023 plans .\n\n“In the normal course of business there are timing items, but they get resolved,” Blatstein said. “Don’t forget, my company does a lot of business. Everybody in my world, in any company, there’s always different machinations, different projects.”",

But he immediately recognized a “series of unfortunate events” that plagued the Sixers in a similar way to last season’s Memphis Grizzlies, where he was on the roster until the trade deadline.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“We went through a ton of stuff [in Memphis],” Roddy told The Inquirer from the Sixers’ locker room last week “ … [The coaches] did a great job of just keeping us day-to-day and keeping us present.”\n\nWith the Sixers coming down the stretch of a miserable lost season — and with former MVP Joel Embiid’s ongoing knee issue presenting an uncertain long-term picture — it is reasonable to wonder if this era of the franchise is effectively cooked. Yet there are some recent examples of successful teams that slogged through what turned out to be disastrous one-year hiccups — while snagging a top-10 draft pick in the process — before righting themselves relatively quickly.\n\n» READ MORE: Four ripple-effect questions after the Sixers shut down Joel Embiid for the rest of the season\n\nThe Grizzles’ 27-55 record last season sandwiched a 2022-23 when they were the Western Conference’s No. 2 seed as one of the league’s exciting up-and-coming teams, then this season shot back up into a top-4 spot entering Monday. The Golden State Warriors provide an even starker example, going from winning three NBA titles from 2015-2018, to holding a league-worst 15-50 record in the league in the COVID-shortened 2019-20 season, to building back up to a 2022 championship.\n\nThough Warriors coach Steve Kerr and veteran big man Kevon Looney were blunt about the challenges when asked Saturday to reflect about that season, they also recognized the ways they squeezed value out of the experience.\n\n“The whole time, it [stinks],” Looney told The Inquirer following Saturday’s shootaround at the Wells Fargo Center. “Losing [stinks], especially when you know you have the talent to be something good. You have an expectation coming into the season, and it goes completely the opposite way.\n\n“You’ve got to start focusing on small things, and getting the smaller wins. And, in turn, you start getting wins here and there that kind of help you keep pushing forward — that all the stuff that we’re practicing on are actually paying off.”\n\nThose Warriors and Grizzlies made their pivots much earlier in the season, compared to this Sixers team that continues to publicly maintain that it is vying for the East’s final play-in spot — even after officially announcing Friday that Embiid would miss the rest of the season.\n\nMemphis star point guard Ja Morant was suspended for the first 25 games of 2023-24, after multiple instances of flashing a gun on social media, and then sustained a shoulder injury in mid-January that sidelined him for the rest of the season. Standout guard Desmond Bane, along with new acquisition Marcus Smart, also missed significant time. By the end of the season, the Grizzlies had set NBA records for players used (33), starting lineups (51), and total games lost due to injuries (578) in one season.\n\nThe 2019-20 Warriors, meanwhile, had already lost superstar Kevin Durant in 2019 free agency, had traded crucial role player Andre Igoudola to (coincidentally) the Grizzlies, and knew they would be without All-Star sharpshooter Klay Thompson, who suffered a torn anterior cruciate ligament during that summer’s NBA Finals. Then, in the fourth game of the regular season, future Hall of Famer Stephen Curry broke his hand.\n\n» READ MORE: Paul George, Tyrese Maxey have no plans to shut down their Sixers season\n\n“We didn’t have a choice,” Kerr recalled during Saturday’s pregame news conference. “There was no switch [to flip].”\n\nTactically, Kerr shifted to focusing on player development. That meant youngsters such as Jordan Poole received more playing time, but were still held accountable for blunders such as a missed defensive rotation. The Warriors traded at the deadline for Andrew Wiggins, who used that initial time to get acclimated to the Warriors’ motion offense before becoming an All-Star and crucial part of the 2022 title team. Even Looney said he utilized that season to work on his jumper, switching out to guard smaller players, and other elements that “when you’re chasing a championship, you might not have time for error.”\n\n“It wasn’t like, ‘Oh, the season’s a waste. Just go out there and do what you want,’” Looney said. “We still had to play in our concepts. We still [were] playing the right way.”\n\nPerhaps more important for both teams was maintaining the daily culture inside the facility and locker room, which Grizzlies coach Taylor Jenkins said was “never a defeated mentality. It’s never a woe-is-me mentality.” Looney added that the Warriors’ joy — the intangible hallmark of their dynasty — continued trickling down from Kerr and Curry.\n\n“Even though [Curry] wasn’t playing, he still was around rehabbing [and] he was still carrying himself with that joy,” Looney said. “And when someone’s setting that standard of excellence, you kind of have to follow it.”\n\nAdded Kerr: “It’s probably more important when you’re losing than when you’re winning, when you’re really beaten down like you were that year. … You want to keep energized, and then you lose six in a row and it’s miserable. So that’s the biggest challenge as a coaching staff [and] organization: How do you maintain a really strong culture in the midst of disappointment night after night?”\n\nA high draft pick was the “prize” for those woeful records — with vastly different results.\n\nThe Grizzlies last summer used the ninth overall selection on Zach Edey, the two-time national college Player of the Year who has been one of the stronger rookie performers this season. Golden State, meanwhile, used the 2020 second overall pick on James Wiseman, a big man who was selected in between now-league faces Anthony Edwards and LaMelo Ball and also ahead of future All-Stars Tyrese Haliburton and Tyrese Maxey. That illustrates the risk and uncertainty of the draft, which Chicago Bulls coach Billy Donovan highlighted last week when asked about the outside belief that his team should transition into full “tank” mode after trading star Zach LaVine at the February deadline.\n\n(And don’t forget: the Sixers’ 2025 first-round draft pick will go to the Oklahoma City Thunder if it lands below sixth in the lottery, thanks to the 2020 Al Horford trade.)\n\n» READ MORE: Joel Embiid receives well wishes from Sixers teammates after shutting down for rest of season: ‘I want him to get back to dominating’\n\nKey differences also exist between the Sixers’ current conundrum and the Warriors’ or Grizzlies’ past situations.\n\nThe Warriors had long established their championship pedigree, while the Sixers have not advanced past the playoffs’ second round since 2001. Curry’s broken hand also did not come with the longer-term concerns of Embiid’s knee, which has undergone multiple surgeries and continued to swell up this season before he opted to shut down and determine the best treatment and rehab path forward.\n\nThe Grizzlies, meanwhile, boast a much younger core of Morant, Bane, and Jaren Jackson, compared to the Sixers having Embiid, who turns 31 later this month, and Paul George, who turns 35 in May, on max contracts.\n\nStill, those teams are examples that it is possible to turn a disastrous season into a temporary glitch. Looking back, Kerr said he was “actually proud” of the way his Warriors handled that season — and then clawed out of it.\n\n“It wasn’t easy. It wasn’t fun,” Looney added. “But we just tried to carry ourselves, and tried to find the joy.”",

        "content": "The Sixers' Tyrese Maxey lies on the court after suffering a back contusion during the third quarter. He never returned to the game. Read more\n\nIt’s always something holding back the 76ers.\n\nThey woke up Monday with a goal of building off Saturday’s unexpected victory over the Golden State Warriors. Instead, they went backward in a 119-102 loss to the Portland Trail Blazers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe loss at the Wells Fargo Center dropped the Sixers to 21-39 and in an 11th-place tie with the Brooklyn Nets. It was their 10th loss in 11 games. They are 2½ games behind the 10th-place Chicago Bulls for the final NBA Play-In Tournament spot with 22 games remaining.\n\nBut this loss became less surprising as the day wore on.\n\n» READ MORE: Tyrese Maxey’s injured shooting hand isn’t getting any better, but he plans to play through the pain\n\nPaul George (left groin tightness) and Kelly Oubre Jr. (illness) were both scratched from the game after being listed before the game as questionable. Then Tyrese Maxey suffered a lower-back contusion midway through the third quarter. The point guard laid on his back grimacing in pain underneath the basket after taking a hard fall on a missed layup. After getting up, Maxey headed straight to the locker room area to be evaluated. He did not return.\n\n“Had a couple doctors check him out,” coach Nick Nurse said. “At this point, nothing too serious. They did say that could change in the morning, but hopefully not. He is going to travel [to Minneapolis with the team]. They, as of now, list him day-to-day.”\n\nAnd with a little over a minute left, Sixers rookie Justin Edwards left after re-spraining his left ankle.\n\n“I’m good,” Edwards said. “I just tweaked it again, but I’m good, though.”\n\nThe former Imhotep Charter standout was able to walk on his ankle at the end of his evaluation. Like Maxey, Edwards, George, and Oubre were expected to travel with the team for Tuesday’s game against the Minnesota Timberwolves at the Target Center. They’re all listed as day-to-day.\n\nThe Sixers are already without Kyle Lowry (right hip injury management) and three other players — Joel Embiid (left knee swelling), Eric Gordon (right wrist surgery) and Jared McCain (left knee surgery) — who are out for the season.\n\nOn this night, the Sixers played valiantly but couldn’t overcome the missing bodies.\n\n“It’s tough when you have three starters go down like that that we kind of thought we were going to have,” Quentin Grimes said of losing Maxey, George, and Oubre. “But I felt like for the majority of the game, we played with energy. We kind of got a little tired, a little gassed at the end. And they kind of got a little spark, went on a little run.”\n\nThe Blazers turned an 11-point first-quarter deficit into a 15-point lead in the fourth quarter. Even when the Sixers had the lead, the result never appeared to be in doubt for Portland. And it became obvious that any hope Philly had was lost when Maxey left the game with 6 minutes, 42 seconds left in the third quarter. At that time, Portland had a 74-68 lead.\n\nThe Blazers’ Anfernee Simons finished with a game-high 34 points. Shaedon Sharpe added 20 points, a career-high 11 rebounds, and five assists. And Donovan Clingan had 13 points, 13 rebounds, and three blocks.\n\nAndre Drummond had his best game as a Sixer this season. The center finished with season highs of 25 points and 18 rebounds. Edwards had 16 points, while Quentin Grimes added 14 points and nine assists after scoring a career-high 44 on Saturday vs. the Warriors.\n\n» READ MORE: Sixers’ Paul George knows ‘window is closing’ on his NBA title hopes but vows to press on\n\nMaxey had a tough shooting night before exiting with his back injury. The point guard had five points on 2-for-13 shooting. He totaled 10 points on 4-for-27 in the last two games after scoring 30 points on 12-for-32 shooting against the New York Knicks last week.\n\nDrummond kept the Sixers competitive for a while. He secured his second straight and fifth overall double-double of the season on a seven-foot hook shot with 2:38 remaining in the first half. Drummond scored 10 second-quarter points and had 16 points and 11 rebounds at intermission.\n\nIn the first half, the 31-year-old scored on three alley-oops, a three-pointer, a hook shot, a cutting dunk, and a floater.\n\nBut the Blazers outscored the Sixers, 35-20, in the third quarter to take a 91-81 advantage and never looked back.\n\nUp Next\n\nTuesday’s matchup (8 p.m., NBCSP) will mark the Sixers’ first meeting with the Timberwolves (33-29) this season.",

        "content": "The chamber of the House of Representatives, where President Donald Trump will address Congress and the nation Tuesday night. Read more\n\nPresident Donald Trump will address a joint session of Congress Tuesday, his first major address since having clashed with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky at the White House Friday.\n\nIt’s unclear how much the president will mention Ukraine in his speech. On Monday, Trump ordered a pause on military assistance to Ukraine the U.S. had been providing since Russia’s invasion in 2022, the Associated Press reported. Trump has pushed for a peace deal between Ukraine and Russia, but has repeatedly criticized Zelensky and increasingly aligned himself with the Kremlin and Russian president Vladimir Putin.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe speech also comes as a government shutdown looms in Washington, D.C. Republicans control the House and Senate, but don’t appear close to a deal ahead of a March 14 deadline. Trump has complicated negotiations by freezing spending previously approved by Congress. Just one example is in Montgomery County, where officials say they have yet to receive millions of dollars in assistance to keep residents in their homes and off the streets.\n\nIt’s likely Trump will tout his moves to dramatically overhaul the size of the federal government, having turned to billionaire Elon Musk and the so-called Department of Government Efficiency to layoff tens of thousands of federal workers — many of whom work in Philadelphia.\n\nIn some cases, Musk and his team have been too aggressive in cutting jobs — the Tesla and SpaceX CEO admitted accidentally ending Ebola protection, had to bring back fired nuclear weapons workers, and called for retired air traffic controllers to return to the Federal Aviation Administration.\n\nThere’s also the question of Trump’s tariffs, which are taxes on imported goods. Tariffs on Mexico and Canada were set to go into effect Tuesday, and Trump announced Monday plans to impose new tariffs on agricultural imports beginning April 2.\n\nThe address will air on all major broadcast networks and cable news channels to an expected audience of 30 million to 35 million viewers. It will also be streamed live online. Here’s what you need to know:\n\nWhat time does Trump’s address to a joint session of Congress start and end?\n\nTrump is expected to begin his address live from the Capitol shortly after 9 p.m. It will air live on all broadcast networks and cable news channels, and is available to stream here on Inquirer.com, courtesy of PBS:\n\nOver the past 20 years, State of the Union-style speeches have averaged about one hour and three minutes, but Trump’s speeches during his first term ran longer, averaging about an hour and 15 minutes.\n\nUsing both as benchmarks, expect Trump’s address to end sometime around 10:10 p.m. Eastern.\n\nWhy Trump’s speech isn’t a State of the Union address\n\nTrump’s speech will have blanket television coverage and all the pomp and circumstance of previous speeches, but it isn’t technically a State of the Union address.\n\nThe president delivers remarks at the invitation of the speaker of the House. Speaker of the House Mike Johnson’s invitation welcomed Trump to deliver an “address,” a recognition the president needs to be in office a full year before giving an official State of the Union.\n\nEvery president since Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1953 has addressed a joint session of Congress shortly after their inauguration. That includes Trump, whose first speech took place on Feb. 28, 2017.\n\nAs for the annual speech itself, the Constitution states the president “shall from time to time give to the Congress information of the State of the Union, and recommend to their consideration such measures as he shall judge necessary and expedient.”\n\nGeorge Washington, in 1790, was the first to deliver a regular address to Congress. The address has transformed over the years, shifting from a speech to a written statement, and back to a speech with the advent of radio and later television. Since 1947, it has officially been known as the State of the Union.\n\nWho is delivering the Democratic response?\n\nFollowing Trump’s address, Democrats will offer their own message about the direction of the country in a rebuttal delivered by Sen. Elissa Slotkin (D., Mich.).\n\nSlotkin was elected to Michigan’s open Senate seat during the 2024 election, despite Trump winning the state. She is a former CIA analyst and Department of Defense official who served during the administrations of George W. Bush and Barack Obama.\n\n“The public expects leaders to level with them on what’s actually happening in our country,” Slotkin said in a statement. “From our economic security to our national security, we’ve got to chart a way forward that actually improves people’s lives in the country we all love, and I’m looking forward to laying that out.”\n\nRep. Adriano Espaillat (D., N.Y.) will deliver the Spanish-language response just three days after Trump signed an executive order making English the official language of the United States, a first in the nation’s 248-year history.\n\nU.S. Rep. Lateefah Simon (D., Calif.) of the progressive Working Families Party will deliver a separate rebuttal to Trump’s speech.\n\nHow are the networks covering the speech?\n\nABC\n\nStart time: 9 p.m. Anchor: World News Tonight anchor David Muir Streaming: Live coverage on ABC News Live and ABCNews.com Local affiliate: 6abc (Channel 6)\n\nCBS\n\nStart time: 9 p.m. Anchors: CBS Evening News co-anchors John Dickerson and Maurice DuBois and Face the Nation moderator Margaret Brennan Streaming: Live coverage on CBS News 24/7 and CBSNews.com Local affiliate: CBS3 (Channel 3)\n\nFox\n\nStart time: 9 p.m. Anchor: Fox News Sunday anchor Shannon Bream Streaming: Live coverage on Fox29.com at 9 p.m. Local affiliate: FOX 29 (Channel 29)\n\nNBC\n\nStart time: 9 p.m. Anchor: NBC Nightly News anchor Lester Holt and TODAY coanchor Savannah Guthrie Streaming: Live coverage NBC News NOW at 8 p.m. and NBCNews.com at 9 p.m. Local affiliate: NBC10 (Channel 10)\n\nPBS\n\nStart time: 9 p.m. Anchor: PBS News co-anchors Amna Nawaz and Geoff Bennett Streaming: Live coverage on PBS’ YouTube account Local affiliate: WHYY-TV (Channel 12)\n\nHow are the cable networks covering the speech?\n\nC-SPAN\n\nStart time: 8 p.m. Anchor: C-SPAN host Peter Slen Streaming: Live coverage on C-SPAN.org\n\nCNN\n\nStart time: 8 p.m. Anchors: The Lead anchor Jake Tapper and OutFront anchor Erin Burnett Streaming: Live coverage on CNN.com and across mobile devices through the CNN app\n\nFox News\n\nStart time: 9 p.m. Anchors: Special Report anchor Bret Baier and The Story anchor Martha MacCallum Streaming: Live coverage on FoxNews.com and Fox Nation at 9 p.m.\n\nMSNBC",

Trying to guess the whims of the Academy voters isn’t my favorite part of the process, but watching the chaos unfold online and IRL as results are announced is where I find true entertainment value. Still, I predict the Doylestown-set epic The Brutalist will bring home multiple trophies, and I’m also on the lookout for other nominees with Philly ties, like Colman Domingo (up for best actor for Sing Sing).

Read more\n\nChef Carlos Aparicio, a two-time James Beard Award semifinalist, plans to open a Fishtown branch of El Chingón, the South Philadelphia restaurant that Inquirer critic Craig LaBan calls “Philly’s most exhilarating Mexican kitchen,” in early April.\n\nUnlike the original location, cocktails will be available at El Chingón Fishtown. It will replace the recently shuttered Heffe, a taqueria at the corner of Frankford Avenue and Marlborough Street. The outdoor-only setup, beneath a “Welcome to Fishtown” mural, is a service window with picnic tables, partly beneath an awning. Delivery through apps will also be offered.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAparicio told The Inquirer that he is turning a yard on the Marlborough Street side into a flower-festooned outdoor dining area that he calls a margarita garden, open seasonally on weekends for brunch through dinnertime. Cocktails and beer will be available through a pop-up with Bluebird Distilling of Phoenixville.\n\nThe margarita garden’s start date has not been determined. It will serve only on select days.\n\n“We have something very unique and special, and we want to share it with Fishtown,” Aparicio said. “I think Fishtown is waiting for us.” Aside from the fancier LMNO at Front and Palmer Streets, the neighborhood has no other outdoor Mexican scenes.\n\nMost of the changes from Heffe, which chef Peter McAndrews opened in 2015 on the former site of a grocery store, are cosmetic.\n\nAparicio said about 60% of the South Philadelphia menu will be offered in Fishtown, including tacos, aguachiles, guacamole, and cemitas — the Pueblan tortas that helped put El Chingón on the map when it opened in November 2022.\n\nLaBan described the clásica cemita as “a towering masterpiece of contrasts on a bun: freshly breaded chicken milanesa layered atop creamy green wedges of avocado, citrusy pápalo leaves (and pápalo aioli), topped with spice bursts of smoky whole chipotles, and a fistful of cool, shredded quesillo that cascades over those warm cutlets in milky white threads of tangy cheese.”\n\nBrunch specials will be offered on the weekends.",

        "content": "An exterior of the Veterans Village building in the Frankford section of Philadelphia. Read more\n\nThe troubles at a 47-unit affordable-housing complex serving veterans began with a nuisance tenant and peaked in late December when two women broke into the complex and one of them set a small trash can full of clothes on fire in front of his unit.\n\nAs the suspects fled, sprinklers went off throughout the Frankford building. The fire was quickly contained but not before gallons of water poured through the building, causing extensive damage.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMonths later, residents continue to live with the fallout of the traumatic arson incident as the nonprofit behind the building navigates the slow insurance process and seeks philanthropic help to make repairs.\n\n“The hallways are still in a renovation state where there’s some rugs torn up,” said U.S. Navy veteran Rubin Rios, 68. “Every floor has repair needs.”\n\nVeterans Village is a $6.5 million complex that opened in 2023. It serves veterans who have experienced housing insecurity, need affordable housing, and live with PTSD or other health issues.\n\nOn rare occasion, a tenant will struggle to adjust to the community — the target of the arson incident was evicted in February after a yearlong legal battle. Still, much of the appeal of Veterans Village lies in the camaraderie among residents, said Rios, who was quick to host one of his neighbors for a night as loud dehumidifiers ran in his apartment after it was drenched in water that December afternoon.\n\nBuilding management said the sprinkler system worked as designed by going off across the building. But by the time firefighters shut off the system, which only they can do, approximately 23 units of the building, common areas, and hallways sustained water damage.\n\nDana Spain, founder of the nonprofit behind Veterans Village, said water-remediation workers had to act quickly to prevent mold. Workers had to cut out baseboards and flooring, and some tenants have “big square pieces missing from their drywall.”\n\n“So people are living in, unfortunately, in sort of a quasi-demolition zone,” Spain said.\n\n» READ MORE: Veterans Village offers affordable apartments and a sense of community to military families in Philly\n\nSpain is eager to begin renovations and is asking for support from philanthropists and volunteers. The Veterans Villages nonprofit has been working with insurers to assess the extent of the damage. Spain said the two bids submitted by general contractors exceeded the cost estimate provided by insurers. She expects that the nonprofit will be on the hook for at least $25,000.\n\nSpain hopes that Good Samaritans can help close the gap by donating either money or materials.\n\n“All of our paint is Sherwin-Williams,” Spain said. “So if somebody said, ‘We own a Sherwin-Williams franchise, we’ll give you $1,000 worth of paint and supplies,’ whatever that might be, that would be helpful.”\n\nSpain said though residents aren’t uncomfortable, the trauma of the incident itself and delays in repairs prompted at least three veterans to move out and prospective residents to withdraw their applications. The Philadelphia Housing Authority won’t give the green light to the now-available units until the holes in the drywall are fixed, Spain said.\n\nRios said the immediate weeks after the fire were the most taxing for residents. He took in, overnight, one of his neighbors who returned to soaked floors and a closet full of wet clothes.\n\nIn the days after, residents had to run dehumidifiers in their apartments and Rios said they were surprised to see how much energy they had used when electric bills came — many residents are low-income and had to seek financial assistance.\n\nThen there was the resentment that tenants felt toward the neighbor who was the target of the arson incident and whom the nonprofit had been trying to evict for close to a year for violating his lease.\n\nBut Rios said it feels like the building is “on the other side of the stress.”\n\nThe targeted tenant was finally evicted and banned from the building in February. Veterans Villages — the nonprofit’s name is plural, though the complex’s name is singular — added full-time security guards.\n\nThe suspect who set the fire in a trash can remains in custody at the Philadelphia Industrial Correctional Center. She faces charges including criminal trespassing, arson, and making terroristic threats.\n\nMeanwhile, Veterans Villages plans to begin repairs once it can choose from three competitive bids.\n\nThough Rios laments having to go through the stress of the fire evacuation and dealing with the subsequent damage, he hopes the tenants can come out better for it.\n\n“Most of us are single folks, a couple of ladies veterans as well, looking for a place to be safe and comfortable,” he said. “We obviously want a place where we could be OK with fellow comrades. Unfortunately, sometimes you need a purge to get things a little better.”",

        "source": "https://www.inquirer.com/",
        "content": "Larry Bowa is the easiest person to find in Phillies camp.\n\nJust head to the half-field adjacent to the home clubhouse at BayCare Ballpark, and there’s a good chance Bowa will be there, fungo bat in hand, at infield coach Bobby Dickerson’s side, hitting grounders to any players who want them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBowa, 79, is in the middle of his 60th spring training, 41 of which have come with the Phillies. As a player, he was a Gold Glove shortstop and World Series champion. He was a coach for the pennant-winning 1993 team and managed the Phillies from 2001 to 2004.\n\nWho better, then, to ask for his impressions on camp so far? The team’s senior adviser joined Phillies Extra, The Inquirer’s weekly baseball show. Here is an excerpt from our conversation, which has been edited for clarity and brevity.\n\nWatch the entire interview below.\n\nQ: Since camp started, I’ve been eager to ask you about Aidan Miller. He’s the youngest player in camp. He’s 21 years old. Two years ago, he was in high school. He’s a first-round pick. He’s in big league camp for the first time, and you’ve been around him now for a few weeks. What’s been your impression of Aidan just from working with him?\n\nA: First of all, he’s been very impressive, very intelligent for a young kid. I’m sure he’s a little bit in awe in the locker room, but he doesn’t show it. He’s here to learn, and if you talk to him, you’d say, man, this guy’s been playing baseball or being invited to big camps for the last five or six years. This is his first big league camp, and he’s handling himself unbelievable.\n\n» READ MORE: Murphy: Phillies know they can’t afford to play it safe with Aidan Miller. Don’t rule out a 2025 debut.\n\nHe’s got great tools. You know, people ask me, do I think he can play short? I watched him last year. I watched him this spring. I definitely think he can play short, and I don’t know what the plans are down the road. I do think that this year he will be playing short. I think he’s starting out in [double-A] Reading. And if things progress like I think they’re going to progress, there’s a good chance he could be in triple A before the end of the season. But for a kid to come out of high school and be as mature as this kid, he’s been very impressive. His work ethic is off the chart. He’s got good arms. He’s got good hands. I’m very impressed with the way he swings the bat, uses all fields. Big-time pickup for us to draft this individual, and I think he’s going to have a great career, whether it be at short, whether it be at third. He’s going to be in the big leagues playing somewhere, and it’s just a matter of where they want to put him. But I think this year they’re going to definitely start him out at shortstop in Reading.\n\nQ: Dave Dombrowski has said that he’s going to stay at short. But after the draft in 2023, you talk to some scouts from other teams who wondered whether his future will be at third base. You think he can stay at short. Why do you say that?\n\nA: Just the athleticism out there. I see that, I see the range, I see the arm, I see his intelligence. He’s got a good baseball mind, he’s got good hands, he swings the bat exceptionally well. And again, we got Trea Turner, who’s here for a long time, so I have no idea what the plans are in the future, barring any injuries. Hopefully Trea stays healthy because Trea’s an outstanding player. I’ve had a philosophy that if a guy’s good enough he’s going to find his way into the lineup whether it be the position he wants to play or another position. When you have this kind of talent, it’s just a matter of time before he’s in the big leagues, in my opinion.\n\nQ: When the Phillies signed Trea Turner a couple of years ago, you and I talked and I’d done a little bit of research about the aging curve of shortstops. Everyone knows the older you get, the harder it is to continue to play 100 or more games a year. I went back to 1972 and there were less than 50 shortstops who had played 100 or more games in a season at age 32. Trea’s going to be 32 this year. You were a guy who played 100-plus games every year until your age-38 season. We all know what kind of an athlete Trea is. In your mind, does he have the makeup, the athleticism to beat that aging curve? What’s going to be the most challenging thing for him to stay at shortstop as he gets into his middle 30s?\n\n» READ MORE: The Phillies want Trea Turner to be himself in 2025. And that means creating ‘havoc’ on the bases.\n\nA: Yeah, I think he can beat that as far as games played. He’s got a great body. He’s got tremendous speed. He’s got a good arm. Each guy’s different. You might have another guy that you’re saying, ‘Oh, this is his last year.’ I don’t see that with Trea. I see Trea playing a long time here. He takes care of himself. I think the biggest thing with playing every day now is they have workloads, not just the Phillies, everybody in baseball. And they make a note if a guy’s playing a lot of games in a row, they sit him down. I’m not all-in on that, but obviously they’re doing it for injuries and to prevent injuries. I like guys to play every day. I watched the Atlanta Braves up until last year. Their lineup goes out there every single day. Every now and then they’ll give a guy a rest. If you’ve got a good, solid lineup, which I think our lineup is that solid, I’m playing these guys. And I know the dog days get here in August, and you need a blow. It’s 100 degrees. The humidity’s high. But I think Trea’s the kind of guy who’s in great shape. I think he can play for a long time. And again, is he going to play short the whole time under his contract? I don’t know. But I don’t see him moving anytime soon. I really don’t.\n\nQ: The batting order is a topic of conversation, as usual. And my contention is at the end of the day it doesn’t matter a whole heck of a lot. Because for as much as people talk about who should lead off and where should Bryce Harper bat, I’ve always thought that if you have your best hitters coming up as often as possible, you’re going to score around the same number of runs. When you were a manager, how much time did you spend on the batting order in general on thinking about those spots individually or more as a grouping?\n\n» READ MORE: How important is batting order? As the Phillies experiment with their lineup, let’s look at the numbers.\n\nA: It’s a puzzle and you want to make sure you have the right guys hitting before and after one another in different areas of the lineup. I think that’s important. I think guys like to know who’s hitting in front of them, who’s in behind them. And of course you’re going to have some games where you face a guy like [Chris] Sale for Atlanta and he’s very difficult to hit from the left side. So you might switch that lineup a little bit. But for the most part, I think these guys like to know where they’re hitting, who’s hitting behind them. Does that mean it’s etched in stone? No. I mean, if your team goes cold for a week and [you] don’t score runs, obviously the manager tries to shake things up and move a guy here or move a guy there.\n\nBut for the most part, if you ask these guys, they want to bat in the same order. They want to know who’s pitching. They want to know who’s hitting in front of them, what the guy throws to certain hitters. But analytics have taken over baseball. Not just with the Phillies, all over. And sometimes they’ll put in the lineup and they’ll say, ‘Hey, this lineup looks like it matches up better.’ I didn’t have to deal with that. I basically looked at individuals and I could tell when a guy needed a day off or maybe a guy was struggling. I said, ‘Hey, look, come in tomorrow. Just relax. Don’t even hit. Don’t take ground balls. Just rest. And then you get back in there the next day.’ But because the analytics have taken over and teams are paying analytic people a lot of money, they rely on those a lot.\n\nPersonally, I like gut feeling. I like what my eyes tell me. I think Rob Thomson can do the same thing. Rob’s the kind of guy that takes the information and they basically say, if you want to use it, fine. If you don’t, and I think that’s how Rob does it. But you get guys that, hey, they get a little sensitive when you start. If a guy goes 0-for-8, now all of a sudden you’re moving from the three-hole to the seven-hole. You know, they’re saying, ‘Well, I guess he doesn’t believe I can hit there.’ So you’ve got to be careful. I think it’s a tenuous situation. You’ve got to believe in your players. And I like the set lineup. Every now and then you might platoon or give a guy a blow and let your extra man play, get some at-bats. Because over the course of 162 games, you’re going to need your extra man. You’re going to need those guys to play. …\n\nBut it’s a different generation now. I know when I played, [Mike Schmidt] hit third, [Greg Luzinski] hit fourth. We very seldom deviated from that. Sometimes I would hit second. Sometimes I would hit eighth. That didn’t bother me. I think it bothers guys in the middle of the lineup more so than a guy that’s a singles hitter, steals bases and things like that. You can insert a singles guy anywhere in the lineup. But those big power hitters, they like to come up with men on base. And there’s no doubt in my mind that Harp and Schwarb and JT [Realmuto] and Casty [Nick Castellanos], all those guys, they like coming up to see two or three guys on. And that’s the big, big issue right now.",

Read more\n\nIn delivering the State of the Union, presidents often proclaim the country is strong.\n\nAnd while Donald Trump’s speech before Congress is not technically the annual address (it may feel like a year, but it’s been less than two months since the inauguration), the claims of a strong nation will likely be the first of many lies he tells Tuesday night.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf anything, Trump’s bullying and bombast are making the country weaker by the day.\n\nThe damage has been reckless, pointless, and sometimes illegal. There is no plan — not even concepts of a plan — beyond further enriching billionaires, hollowing out institutions, moving the country backward, upending alliances, harming the environment, and inflicting unnecessary pain at home and abroad.\n\nPresidents are supposed to unify and strengthen the nation. But in a matter of weeks, Trump has diminished and destabilized the United States.\n\nThe order of each day has been chaos.\n\nMass firings of roughly 300,000 federal workers so far — including many who voted for Trump — have needlessly upended lives and the economy.\n\n» READ MORE: No room for timidity in fight against Trump’s imperial presidency | Editorial\n\nThis hostile takeover of the federal government has been led by the unelected and unaccountable billionaire Elon Musk. It is unclear if his role at the made-up Department of Government Efficiency is even legal — or if he appreciates the irony that indiscriminately slashing jobs will only make the government less efficient.\n\nThe layoffs are already impacting workers across Pennsylvania and in Philadelphia. And the fallout is still in the early stages and will likely get worse.\n\nBut Trump’s actions have already weakened a U.S. economy that, before the election, was called the envy of the world.\n\nUnder Trump, consumer confidence has plunged, hiring has slowed, and inflation has increased.\n\nTrump’s erratic trade policy is fueling uncertainty and slowing interest rate cuts. The stock market plummeted Monday on news he would go through with imposing 25% tariffs on Mexico and Canada. Meanwhile, the price of eggs keeps climbing.\n\nA purge of career U.S. Justice Department and FBI officials cut to a pillar of what separates America from other countries. Some scholars believe we are already facing a constitutional crisis.\n\nTrump’s release of more than 1,000 convicted criminals involved in the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection undermined the rule of law and made the country less safe. Dropping federal corruption charges against New York Mayor Eric Adams spurred a mass resignation of career prosecutors who objected to a deal that could not pass the smell test.\n\nTrump’s appointment of unqualified cabinet officials further undermines confidence and credibility. No one who believes in science trusts Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to manage measles outbreaks, the largest of which has killed one unvaccinated child in Texas. Measles cases have now been reported in New Jersey and Montgomery County.\n\nTrump’s job cuts and rollback of regulations will make the workplace, food supply, and health systems less safe. The U.S. Department of Agriculture was scrambling to rehire workers who Trump fired to help manage the bird flu outbreak. Hundreds of Federal Aviation Administration employees were fired even as a string of plane crashes has unnerved the flying public.\n\nThe only guarantee from the first chaotic weeks of Trump’s term is that the slashing of U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) contracts to poor countries will lead to an increase in death and starvation.\n\nStill, a new low was reached on Friday when Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky came to Washington seeking support in the three-year war started by Russian dictator Vladimir Putin.\n\n» READ MORE: America loses with Trump’s disgraceful betrayal of Ukraine | Editorial\n\nInstead, a childish attack on Zelensky by Trump and Vice President JD Vance turned into the most disgraceful spectacle the world has ever witnessed inside the Oval Office.\n\nZelensky was thrown out of the White House after he has displayed nothing but courage and strength in standing up to the gruesome war crimes inflicted on his country by Putin. Republican lawmakers mostly looked away.\n\nEvery past American president stood with allies like Ukraine and defended attacks on freedom and democracy — until Trump. The twice-impeached, convicted criminal occupying the White House has upended generations of American foreign policy that brought peace and prosperity to the free world.\n\nTrump has turned his back on Ukraine and NATO. Worst of all, Trump has climbed into bed with Putin, a corrupt, former KGB spy with a long history of murder, and is now toeing the Russian party line.\n\nSelling out Ukraine undermines America’s standing around the world. Trump has made America more isolated and less trusted. That will embolden adversaries and endanger national security.\n\nThere are indications the public has had enough. Multiple polls show the president’s approval rating slumping. A majority of Americans believe the economy is on the wrong track.\n\nRegardless, Trump will likely put on a fact-free show during his speech to Congress. But the sad truth remains: The state of the union under Trump is weaker and in disarray.",

Yes, the Oscar season and ceremony are over, but that doesn’t mean you can’t still watch the nominees and the winners. Here are some of the films that are still playing in local theaters, and some that are now available on streaming..\n\n‘Anora’\n\nSean Baker’s romantic comedy drama about a young sex worker from Brighton Beach falling in love with the son of a Russian oligarch, took home five awards including best picture and best director. The film, which has only made $15.6 million domestically, is one of the lowest grossing best picture winners in a while but that will probably change after the film’s Oscar sweep. “We are all here tonight because we love movies.

The best supporting actress winner is the first American of Dominican descent to win the award. “My grandmother came to this country in 1961 — I am a proud child of immigrant parents,” she said. “With dreams and dignity and hardworking hands, and I am the first American of Dominican origin to accept an Academy Award, and I know I will not be the last.” The film also won the best song award for “El Mal.”\n\nStreaming on: Netflix\n\n‘Flow’\n\nLatvia won its first Oscar last night thanks to Gints Zilbalodis’ animated feature Flow. The dreamy animation starring Cat, a black cat who survives a deadly flood by jumping on to a boat with other animals, doesn’t use any dialog. “I think you can express a lot more without words. Some of these emotions and ideas I couldn’t articulate with words but with music, sound, movement and editing, I can say a lot more,” the filmmaker said after receiving his award. The film was made using Blender, a free, open-source graphics software tool.\n\nStreaming on: Hulu, Sling TV, Amazon Prime Video\n\n‘I’m Still Here’\n\nThis Brazilian film is the first from its country to be nominated for the best picture award.

        "content": "President Donald Trump's long-threatened tariffs against Canada and Mexico finally went into effect Tuesday, putting global markets on edge and setting up costly retaliations by the United States’ North American allies.\n\nStarting just past midnight, imports from Canada and Mexico are now to be taxed at 25%, with Canadian energy products getting tariffed at 10%. In addition, the 10% tariff that Trump placed on Chinese imports in February is doubling to 20%.\n\nIn response, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said his country would slap tariffs on more than $100 billion of American goods over the course of 21 days.\n\nChina announced Tuesday it will impose additional tariffs of up to 15% on imports of key U.S. farm products, including chicken, pork, soy and beef.\n\nGet top local stories in Philly delivered to you every morning. Sign up for NBC Philadelphia's News Headlines newsletter.\n\nThe tariffs announced by the Commerce Ministry are due to take effect from March 10. They follow U.S. President Donald Trump’s order to raise tariffs on imports of Chinese products to 20% across the board. Those took effect on Tuesday.\n\nImports of U.S. grown chicken, wheat, corn and cotton will face an extra 15% tariff, it said. The tariff on sorghum, soybeans, pork, beef, seafoods, fruit, vegetables and dairy products will be increased by 10%.\n\nMexico has yet to respond to the tariffs.\n\nThe U.S. president's moves raised fears of higher inflation and the prospect of a devastating trade war even as he promised the American public that taxes on imports are the easiest path to national prosperity. He has shown a willingness to buck the warnings of mainstream economists and put his own public approval on the line, believing that tariffs can fix what ails the country.\n\n“It’s a very powerful weapon that politicians haven’t used because they were either dishonest, stupid or paid off in some other form,\" Trump said Monday at the White House. \"And now we’re using them.”\n\nThe Canada and Mexico tariffs were originally supposed to begin in February, but Trump agreed to a 30-day suspension to negotiate further with the two largest U.S. trading partners. The stated reason for the tariffs is to address drug trafficking and illegal immigration, and both countries say they've made progress on those issues. But Trump has also said the tariffs will only come down if the U.S. trade imbalance closes, a process unlikely to be settled on a political timeline.\n\nThere is the possibility of the tariffs being short-lived if the U.S. economy suffers, just as there is the possibility of more tariffs to come on the European Union, India, computer chips, autos and pharmaceutical drugs, as Trump has promised. The American president has injected a disorienting volatility into the world economy, leaving it off balance as people wonder what he’ll do next.\n\n“It’s chaotic, especially compared to the way we saw tariffs rolled out in the first (Trump) administration,\" said Michael House, co-chair of the international trade practice at the Perkins Coie law firm. \"It’s unpredictable. We don’t know, in fact, what the president will do.’’\n\nDemocratic lawmakers were quick to criticize the tariffs, but even some Republican senators raised alarms.\n\nSen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, said she’s “very concerned” about the tariffs going into effect because of her state’s proximity to Canada.\n\nThe Trump administration has directed a “pause” to U.S. assistance to Ukraine after a disastrous Oval Office meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy last week.\n\n“Maine and Canada’s economy are integrated,” Collins said, explaining that much of the state’s lobsters and blueberries are processed in Canada and then sent back to the U.S.\n\nThe world economy is now caught in the fog of what appears to be a trade war.\n\nEven after Trump announced Monday that the tariffs were going forward, Canadian officials were still in touch with their U.S. counterparts.\n\n“The dialogue will continue, but we are ready to respond,” Canadian Defense Minister Bill Blair said in Ottawa as he went into a special Cabinet meeting on U.S.-Canada relations. “There are still discussions taking place.”\n\nShortly after Blair spoke, Trudeau said Canada would put 25% tariffs against $155 billion Canadian ($107 billion U.S.) of American goods, starting with tariffs on $30 billion Canadian ($21 billion U.S.) worth of goods immediately and on the remaining amount on American products in three weeks.\n\n“Our tariffs will remain in place until the U.S. trade action is withdrawn, and should U.S. tariffs not cease, we are in active and ongoing discussions with provinces and territories to pursue several non-tariff measures,” Trudeau said.\n\nTo resolve the tariffs being imposed Tuesday, the White House would like to see a drop in the seizures of fentanyl inside the United States, not just on the northern and southern borders. Administration officials say that seizures of fentanyl last month in everywhere from Louisiana to New Jersey had ties to foreign cartels.\n\nDamon Pike, technical practice leader for customs and trade services at the tax and consulting firm BDO, suggested that how other countries respond to the tariffs with their own import taxes could escalate the tensions and possibly increase the economic pain points.\n\n“Canada has their list ready,\" Pike said. \"The EU has their list ready. It’s going to be tit for tat.’’\n\nThe Trump administration has suggested that inflation will not be as bad as economists claim, saying that tariffs give a reason for foreign companies to open factories in the United States. On Monday, Trump announced that Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, the computer chipmaker, would be investing $100 billion in domestic production.\n\nStill, it can take time to relocate factories spread across the world and train workers with the skills they need.\n\nGreg Ahearn, president and CEO of The Toy Association, said the 20% tariffs on Chinese goods will be “crippling” for the toy industry, as nearly 80% of toys sold in the U.S. are made in China.\n\n“There’s a sophistication of manufacturing, of the tooling,” he said. “There’s a lot of handcrafting that is part of these toys that a lot of people don’t understand … the face painting, the face masks, the hair weaving, the hair braiding, the cut and sew for plush to get it to look just so. All of that are very high hands, skilled labor that has been passed through generations in the supply chain that exists with China.\"\n\nFor a president who has promised quick results, Ahearn added a note of caution about how quickly U.S. factories could match their Chinese rivals.\n\n\"That can’t be replicated overnight,” he said.\n\n___\n\nGillies reported from Toronto.

        "source": "https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/",
        "content": "Most of America “springs forward” Sunday for daylight saving time and losing that hour of sleep can do more than leave you tired and cranky the next day. It also could harm your health.\n\nDarker mornings and more evening light together knock your body clock out of whack — which means daylight saving time can usher in sleep trouble for weeks or longer. Studies have even found an uptick in heart attacks and strokes right after the March time change.\n\nThere are ways to ease the adjustment, including getting more sunshine to help reset your circadian rhythm for healthful sleep.\n\nWhen does daylight saving time start?\n\nGet top local stories in Philly delivered to you every morning. Sign up for NBC Philadelphia's News Headlines newsletter.\n\nDaylight saving time begins Sunday at 2 a.m., an hour of sleep vanishing in most of the U.S. The ritual will reverse on Nov. 2 when clocks “fall back” as daylight saving time ends.\n\nHawaii and most of Arizona don’t make the spring switch, sticking to standard time year-round along with Puerto Rico, American Samoa, Guam and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Worldwide, dozens of countries also observe daylight saving time, starting and ending at different dates.\n\nSome people try to prepare for daylight saving time’s sleep jolt by going to bed a little earlier two or three nights ahead. With a third of American adults already not getting the recommended seven hours of nightly shuteye, catching up can be difficult.\n\nWhat happens to your brain when it's lighter later?\n\nThe brain has a master clock that is set by exposure to sunlight and darkness. This circadian rhythm is a roughly 24-hour cycle that determines when we become sleepy and when we’re more alert. The patterns change with age, one reason that early-to-rise youngsters evolve into hard-to-wake teens.\n\nMorning light resets the rhythm. By evening, levels of a hormone called melatonin begin to surge, triggering drowsiness. Too much light in the evening — that extra hour from daylight saving time — delays that surge and the cycle gets out of sync.\n\nSleep deprivation is linked to heart disease, cognitive decline, obesity and numerous other problems. And that circadian clock affects more than sleep, also influencing things like heart rate, blood pressure, stress hormones and metabolism.\n\nHow does the time change affect your health?\n\nFatal car crashes temporarily jump the first few days after the spring time change, according to a study of U.S. traffic fatalities. The risk was highest in the morning, and researchers attributed it to sleep deprivation.\n\nThen there’s the cardiac connection. The American Heart Association points to studies that suggest an uptick in heart attacks on the Monday after daylight saving time begins, and in strokes for two days afterward.\n\nDoctors already know that heart attacks, especially severe ones, are a bit more common on Mondays generally — and in the morning, when blood is more clot-prone.\n\nResearchers don't know why the time change would add to that Monday connection but it's possible the abrupt circadian disruption exacerbates factors such as high blood pressure in people already at risk.\n\nBenjamin Franklin gets credit for a lot of things, but creating Daylight Saving Time shouldn’t be one of them.\n\nHow to prepare for daylight saving time\n\nGradually shift bedtimes about 15 or 20 minutes earlier for several nights before the time change, and rise earlier the next morning, too. Go outside for early morning sunshine that first week of daylight saving time, another way to help reset your body's internal clock. Moving up daily routines, like dinner time or when you exercise, also may help cue your body to start adapting, sleep experts advise.\n\nAfternoon naps and caffeine as well as evening light from phones and other electronic devices can make adjusting to an earlier bedtime even harder.\n\nWill the U.S. ever eliminate the time change?\n\nEvery year there's talk about ending the time change. In December, then-President-elect Donald Trump promised to eliminate daylight saving time. For the last several years, a bipartisan bill named the Sunshine Protection Act to make daylight saving time permanent has stalled in Congress; it has been reintroduced this year.\n\nBut that's the opposite of what some health groups recommend. The American Medical Association and American Academy of Sleep Medicine agree it's time to do away with time switches but say sticking with standard time year-round aligns better with the sun — and human biology — for more consistent sleep.",

        "content": "President Donald Trump on Monday directed a “pause” to U.S. assistance to Ukraine as he seeks to pressure Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to engage in negotiations to end the war with Russia.\n\nThe move comes just days after a disastrous Oval Office meeting in which Trump and Vice President JD Vance tore into Zelenskyy for what they perceived as insufficient gratitude for the more than $180 billion in military aid the U.S. has sent to Kyiv since Russia invaded three years ago.\n\nA White House official said Trump is focused on reaching a peace deal and wants Zelenskyy “committed” to that goal. The official added that the U.S. was “pausing and reviewing” its aid to \"ensure that it is contributing to a solution.” The official spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the assistance.\n\nThe order will remain in effect until Trump determines that Ukraine has demonstrated a commitment to peace negotiations with Russia, the official said.\n\nGet top local stories in Philly delivered to you every morning. Sign up for NBC Philadelphia's News Headlines newsletter.\n\nThe halting of military aid comes some five years after Trump held up congressionally authorized assistance to Ukraine as he sought to pressure Zelenskyy to launch an investigation into Joe Biden, then a Democratic presidential candidate. The moment led to Trump’s first impeachment.\n\nIn the leadup to the 2024 election, Trump vowed a quick end to the war in Ukraine, even once boasting that he could bring a halt to the fighting in one day. He has shown increasing frustration with Zelenskyy over the war while simultaneously expressing confidence that Russian President Vladimir Putin, whom he has long admired, can be trusted to keep the peace if a truce is reached.\n\nTrump earlier on Monday slammed Zelenskyy for suggesting that the end of the war likely “is still very, very far away.” Zelenskyy had suggested it would take time to come to an agreement to end the war as he tried to offer a positive take on the U.S.-Ukraine relationship in the aftermath of last week’s White House meeting.\n\n“This is the worst statement that could have been made by Zelenskyy, and America will not put up with it for much longer!” Trump said in a post on his Truth Social platform, responding to comments Zelenskyy made late Sunday to reporters.\n\nTrump, at a White House event later Monday, referred to Zelenskyy's reported comments and asserted the Ukrainian leader “better not be right about that.”\n\nZelenskyy later took to social media in an effort to further explain his thinking. He did not directly refer to Trump’s comments, but underscored that it “is very important that we try to make our diplomacy really substantive to end this war the soonest possible.”\n\nWatch the heated exchange between Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, U.S. President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance in the Oval Office.\n\n“We need real peace and Ukrainians want it most because the war ruins our cities and towns,” Zelenskyy added. “We lose our people. We need to stop the war and to guarantee security.”\n\nTrump administration and Ukrainian officials had been expected to sign off on a deal during Zelenskyy’s visit last week that would have given the U.S. access to Ukraine’s critical minerals in part to pay back the U.S. for aid it has sent Kyiv since the start of the war. The White House had billed such a pact as a way to tighten U.S.-Ukrainian relations in the long term.\n\nVance, in an interview with Fox News' Sean Hannity that aired Monday evening, said European allies were doing Ukraine a disservice by not pressing Zelenskyy to find an endgame to the war.\n\n“A lot of our European friends puff him up,” Vance said. “They say, you know, you’re a freedom fighter. You need to keep fighting forever. Well, fighting forever with what? With whose money, with whose ammunition and with whose lives?”\n\nDemocrats said the pausing of aid to Ukraine was dangerous and ill-advised.\n\nDemocratic Rep. Brendan Boyle of Pennsylvania, who is co-chair of the Congressional EU Caucus, said the decision “is reckless, indefensible, and a direct threat to our national security.”\n\nThe Biden administration provided Kyiv with more than $66.5 billion in military aid and weapons since the war began. It had left unspent about $3.85 billion in congressionally authorized funding to send more weapons to Ukraine from existing U.S. stockpiles — a sum that had not been affected by the foreign aid freeze that Trump put in place when he first took office.\n\n“This aid was approved by Congress on a bipartisan basis — Republicans and Democrats alike recognized that standing with Ukraine is standing for democracy and against Putin’s aggression,” Boyle said in a statement. “Yet, Trump, who has repeatedly praised Putin and undermined our allies, is now playing political games with critical military assistance.”\n\nDemocratic Rep. Dan Goldman, who served as counsel to House Democrats in the first impeachment inquiry against Trump, said the pausing of aid was “another extortion” of Zelenskyy.\n\n“This is the exact opposite of peace through strength,” Goldman said. “Instead, what it is is it’s another extortion of President Zelenskyy, illegally withholding aid in order to get President Zelenskyy to agree to a minerals deal.\"\n\nTrump's national security adviser said Zelenskyy’s posture during Friday’s Oval Office talks “put up in the air” whether he’s someone the U.S. administration will be able to deal with going forward.\n\n“Is he ready, personally, politically, to move his country towards an end to the fighting?” Mike Waltz said Monday on Fox News' “America’s Newsroom.” \"And can he and will he make the compromises necessary?”\n\nWaltz added another layer of doubt about U.S. support as other high-profile Trump allies, including House Speaker Mike Johnson and Sen. Lindsey Graham, have suggested that the relationship between Trump and Zelenskyy is becoming untenable.\n\nIn a meeting on Sunday with European leaders in London, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said he believes relations will continue with the United States.\n\nAngela Stent, a former national intelligence officer for Russia and Eurasia at the National Intelligence Council, said Putin is likely in no rush to end the war amid the fissures between Trump and Zelenskyy and between Europe and the U.S. about the way ahead.\n\n“He thinks Russia is winning. ... And he thinks that as time goes on, the West will be more fractured,\" said Stent, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution in Washington.\n\nTrump on Monday suggested he hasn't given up on the economic pact, calling it “a great deal.” He added that he expected to speak about the deal during his Tuesday address before a joint session of Congress.\n\nRep. Brian Fitzpatrick, a Pennsylvania Republican who co-chairs the Congressional Ukraine Caucus, spoke with Zelenskyy's chief of staff, Andriy Yermak, earlier Monday about getting the mineral rights deal back on track.\n\nKey GOP senators also indicated before the announcement of paused aid that they see a path to put U.S.-Ukraine relations back on track.\n\n“We got to lower the temperature,” said Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., “and get to a deal that’s economically beneficial and takes care of our interests as well as the interests of the Ukrainian people.”\n\nSen. Markwayne Mullin, an Oklahoma Republican who is a close ally of Trump, said he believes the president and Zelenskyy can “move past it.”\n\n“Getting the minerals deal done is a first step,” Mullin said. After that, he said, Zelenskyy needs to be “realistic on what a peace deal looks like.”\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Tracy Brown, Lolita C. Baldor and Marc Levy contributed to this report.",

After FBI agents surveilled and smeared members of political groups viewed as \"subversive\" by longtime FBI director J. Edgar Hoover during the Cold War, a series of reforms were enacted to ensure that the bureau not be used by elected leaders to retaliate against their political enemies.\n\nDennehy urged his colleagues to maintain those values.\n\nIn an email to his staff in February, Dennehy wrote that agents within the bureau \"find ourselves in the middle of a battle of our own as good people are being walked out of the FBI,\" as top leaders were resisting a request from the Trump Justice Department to turn over the names of all FBI employees who worked on the Capitol riot investigations.\n\n\"Others are being targeted because they did their jobs in accordance with the law and FBI policy,\" his February email stated.\n\n“Time for me to dig in,” Dennehy wrote.\n\nThe list eventually was turned over — first without the names, but later the names were also sent. But it's widely believed inside the FBI that the resistance by Dennehy, along with the acting director Brian Driscoll and acting deputy director Rob Kissane — prevented a mass firing of people associated with the Jan. 6th cases.\n\nThe move comes amid intense unease in the bureau, which will be headed by two Trump loyalists: Patel, a former federal prosecutor, Congressional staffer and national security official, and Dan Bongino, a right-wing podcast host and former Secret Service Agent and New York police officer who has accused the FBI of staging the Jan. 6 assault on the Capitol.\n\nFBI special agents expressed shock over the announcement that Bongino would take over the deputy director role, where he'll oversee the bureau's day-to-day operations. The announcement came just after the Senate confirmed Patel as the bureau's director in a largely party-line vote.\n\nTrump has promised to fire \"some\" FBI special agents who worked Jan. 6 cases, claiming, without citing specific evidence, that they were \"corrupt.\"\n\nOn Friday, Interim U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia Ed Martin demoted several top officials in that office, including high-ranking prosecutors who had worked key cases against Jan. 6 rioters and other Trump supporters.\n\nTrump has nominated Martin — a \"stop the steal\" organizer who was on the grounds of the Capitol on Jan. 6 and who represented several Capitol attack defendants — to permanently run the U.S. Attorney's Office in the nation's capitol.\n\nDennehy spent six years in the Marine Corps before joining the FBI after 9/11, according to his LinkedIn resume. At the bureau he specialized in weapons counterproliferation, and spent time in management roles in both the Washington D.C. and New York field offices before being promoted to lead the New York office in 2022.\n\nBefore signing off his email with the Marine Corp motto \"Semper Fidelis,\" he listed what he would miss about being part of the FBI.\n\nRead his full message to colleagues below:\n\nAll,\n\nLate Friday, I was informed that I needed to put my retirement papers in today, which I just did. I was not given a reason for this decision.\n\nRegardless, I apologize to all of you for not being able to fulfill my commitment to you to serve as ADIC NY for at least two years. But as I leave today, I have an immense feeling of pride - to have represented an office of professionals who will always do the right thing for the right reasons; who will always seek the truth while upholding the rule of law; who will always follow the facts no matter where they lead and be unapologetic about it; who will never bend, break, falter, or quit on your integrity; who will always handle cases and evidence with an overabundance of caution and care for the innocent, the victims, and the process first; and who will always remain independent.\n\nSo with that, here is my final Top 10 list:\n\nTop 10 Things I'll Miss about the FBI\n\n10. The commute to work. NOT.\n\n9. The investigations. Doesn't matter what squad you are on - the work is the best in the world.\n\n8. The intensity. You have to be in it to realize what I mean. But we all know how significant what we do is.\n\n7. The FBI brand. Do not fret. Those three letters still mean something - and there is only a select group of folks in this world, past and present, who can say they're with the FBI. Be proud of that.\n\n6. The camaraderie - within our own Bureau family, and with all law enforcement - local, state, federal, and international. There is no better fraternity in the world.\n\n5. The opportunity to put on a suit and tie to conduct interviews in the morning, throw on some street clothes to conduct surveillance in the afternoon, debrief a sensitive source in a safehouse overnight, and then get up early for a SWAT arrest the next morning. Then rinse and repeat.\n\n4. The badge. What it took to earn it and what it means to carry it.\n\n3. The independence. We will not bend. We will not falter. We will not sacrifice what is right for anything or anyone.\n\n2. The impact. Our work helps shape foreign policy, community awareness, international relations, wartime decisions, and public safety. Every. Single. Day.\n\n1. All of you - every single one of you who has earned your position within this phenomenal organization.\n\nI've been told many times in my life, \"When you find yourself in a hole, sometimes it's best to quit digging.\" Screw that. I will never stop defending this joint. I'll just do it willingly and proudly from outside the wire.\n\nSemper Fidelis,\n\nJD",

Sign up for NBC Philadelphia's News Headlines newsletter.\n\nFat Tuesday is the English translation of Mardi Gras. While Mardi Gras is often used, inaccurately, to refer to the entirety of the Carnival season, it’s actually meant to refer just to Fat Tuesday, which marks the culmination of the Carnival season.\n\nFrom Carnival to krewe to king cake, here are eight terms you need to know for Mardi Gras.\n\nWhy is it called Fat Tuesday?\n\nFat Tuesday, or Mardi Gras, is the last day before the start of Lent, or the Lenten period, in the Catholic tradition. Lent is observed as a period of fasting and self-sacrifice, and Fat Tuesday is the last day of merriment and feasting before that begins. According to the Encyclopedia of Alabama — the state where Mardi Gras has its earliest American roots — Fat Tuesday specifically refers to the practice of eating a fattened calf in preparation for the fasting that takes place during Lent.\n\nWhere did Mardi Gras start?\n\nWhile today New Orleans is the nexus of Mardi Gras celebrations in the U.S., it actually started around 140 miles east of the Big Easy in Mobile, Alabama. It was observed for the first time in the New World by French pioneers at Twenty-Seven Mile Bluff, the first settlement of Mobile in 1703. Learn more about Mardi Gras' origins here.",

A researcher studying which communities will get flooded when a storm strikes.\n\nThey were among the more than 600 workers the Trump administration cut last week when it eliminated about 5% of the workforce at the National Weather Service and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.\n\n“I was considered an essential employee, part of a 24/7 safety watch,” said Kayla Besong, a physical scientist at the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center, which sends tsunami alerts. Until Thursday, she was part of a team of 12 that programmed the systems that determine whether parts of the U.S. coastline are at risk and issued alerts accordingly. Two people were required to be working at all times, Besong said.\n\nThe mass firing — of educated, specialized workers who viewed themselves as the next generation of scientists protecting life and property — could stretch NOAA’s workforce thin and hinder work on programs designed for public safety, former agency employees and leaders said.\n\nGet top local stories in Philly delivered to you every morning. Sign up for NBC Philadelphia's News Headlines newsletter.\n\nClimate change is making weather disasters more common. Last year, NOAA counted 27 billion-dollar disasters, which resulted in the deaths of 568 people in the United States. It was the second-highest number since 1980, when NOAA began keeping such records, even accounting for inflation.\n\nAt the same time, meteorologists and forecasters say they’ve faced public vitriol and harassment despite increasingly accurate predictions. Some blame the politicization of climate change and the proliferation of conspiracy theories.\n\nA White House official said “an extensive process” was conducted before the NOAA layoffs to ensure “mission critical functions” weren’t compromised. The cuts were part of the Trump administration’s mass firings of federal workers, which have spurred protests and legal challenges. Some researchers have warned that cuts to health and science agencies, in particular, could walk back or stall years of progress.\n\nA NOAA spokesperson said the agency wouldn’t comment on the layoffs.\n\n“We are not discussing internal personnel and management matters. NOAA remains dedicated to its mission, providing timely information, research, and resources that serve the American public,” Susan Buchanan, a National Weather Service public affairs officer, said in a statement Thursday.\n\nFormer agency officials railed against the cuts, saying they threaten public safety during weather crises.\n\n“Every office in NOAA was hit by these indiscriminate, misguided, ill-informed terminations,” said Rick Spinrad, the administrator of NOAA under President Joe Biden. “We’re coming into tornado season; hurricane season isn’t too far behind. We’re going to have, still, some winter storms. We’re going to have floods, droughts.”\n\nDemocrats in Congress, too, spoke out against the moves at a news conference Friday and at a rally Monday at NOAA headquarters.\n\n“Without the warnings of extreme weather events, hurricanes, tsunamis, other things, people will die and others will suffer greatly, including huge property loss. And that’s why this is such an assault on our public safety,” Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., said at the news conference.\n\nBesong, 30, began her job as a physical scientist at the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center in Hawaii in September. The center provides alerts to the military and U.S. embassies and issues them for vulnerable coastlines in the Pacific Ocean and the Caribbean. During tsunami events, Besong said, she would call military installations with information about risk and contact local emergency managers.\n\n“I was using my skills to actively help people,” said Besong, who has a doctorate in atmospheric science. “You’re directly using your skills to improve systems that protect and warn against hazards.”\n\nShe added that tsunami alerts rely on complicated, bespoke computer programs that analyze seismic and tidal data.\n\n“When there’s any large displacement in the Earth’s crust or water, we get notified and have to determine if there’s an earthquake large enough to create a tsunami or if a tsunami has been generated by other means,” Besong said. “I’ve been developing these skills for over 10 years. I’m an excellent programmer. Their systems are very niche, and they require people who know how to program.”\n\nEven before the latest cuts, she said, the office was strapped for resources and needed to develop a new generation of workers.\n\n“You do need a high level of expertise to understand and jump in on these systems,” Besong said, saying the job required a doctorate or a master’s degree and additional experience.\n\nLike Besong, Andy Hazelton, a hurricane modeling specialist, also has a Ph.D. and spent years developing specialized computing skills. Hazelton helped develop NOAA’s next-generation hurricane modeling program, called HAFS, as an academic at the University of Miami.\n\nHe joined NOAA’s Environmental Modeling Center on the October day when Hurricane Milton hit the Florida coastline, then was fired on Thursday. His work involved using supercomputers to advance hurricane forecasting.\n\n“We’re working on the physical approximations, trying to make it more accurate, so the forecast error continues to shrink, the cone continues to get smaller and so the people who are going to get hit get more lead time,” Hazelton said, referring to the graphic that shows the probability of a hurricane’s path. “There’s a lot of expertise that got lost on this.”\n\nThe HAFS model indicated that both hurricanes Helene and Milton would intensify rapidly, which helped forecasters predict more powerful storms and get more strident warnings out, Hazelton said.\n\n“We do work people use to keep themselves safe,” he said.\n\nSome data that Hazelton’s models rely on is at risk, as well. Kerri Englert, a NOAA flight director and meteorologist, was also fired Thursday. During “hurricane hunter” missions, flight directors advise pilots about the safest routes and how to get the best data for modeling. Englert was onboard a “hurricane hunter” aircraft during hurricanes Beryl, Helene and Milton last year.\n\n“We do put our lives on the line to go do these missions,” said Englert, a Navy veteran. “It is a passion. I have spent 10 years chasing after this job.”\n\nBefore the cuts, Englert said, NOAA had aimed to have 10 flight director positions filled. But after she and another were terminated, that left just six. Now, she said, if one flight director is sick, there will be fewer “hurricane hunter” flights.\n\nDuring hurricane season, meteorologists rely on the one-of-a-kind data the flights gather, which feeds into hurricane models.\n\n“It’s going to increase the uncertainty,” Englert said. “You’re looking at additional evacuations.”\n\nOther fired workers were helping develop modeling tools that haven’t yet been rolled out at scale. The cuts may affect the tools’ quality and implementation timelines, they said.\n\nEvan Belkin, a doctoral student at the University of Albany, was hired at the National Weather Service in 2023 as part of a program that allows people still finishing degrees to work at the agency.\n\nHe worked at the service’s Northeast River Forecast Center and in its weather forecast office in Albany, New York, until last week. He helped launch weather balloons and was part of a team building a flood inundation mapping tool.\n\nThe tool, still under development, is designed to model which areas in a community will flood in heavy rain, including the extreme events that climate change is making more likely. Early versions of the maps were distributed to some local emergency managers, Belkin said, and the goal was to expand the services nationwide by 2026.\n\nThe model accurately predicted that flooding in Montpelier, Vermont, in July 2023 would reach the state capitol building — Belkin visited to confirm the model got it right.\n\nHe was among several students and employees working on the tool who were let go, he said.\n\n“When you don’t have people and bodies to verify how accurate the model depictions are, you’re not going to be successful,” Belkin said. “Without people and bodies, this flood inundation mapping project is going to go down the s----er.”\n\nThe cuts also reduced the number of meteorologists taking public calls and putting out forecasts.\n\nOn the morning he was fired, he said, Francis Tarasiewicz, a National Weather Service meteorologist in Rhode Island, started work at about 5:30 a.m., putting together four- to seven-day forecasts, as well as forecasts specifically for airports.\n\n“We’re not the waste,” Tarasiewicz said.\n\nSpinrad said at the news conference that every NOAA office had had reductions, including about 30% of the staff with the Office of Space Commerce.\n\n“One of the functions of that office is to keep the roughly 30,000 objects in space from colliding with each other,” he said.\n\nSpinrad also warned that the loss of workers would be likely to push back seasonal outlooks and hurricane forecasts.\n\n“Some of those products may end up being delayed in delivery just because they don’t have the staffing power,” he said.\n\nSome typical NOAA and NWS services went dark almost immediately.\n\nShortly after the firings, the National Weather Service office in Kotzebue, Alaska, said it would suspend releasing weather balloons.\n\nNOAA’s Great Lakes Environmental Research Laboratory also said it would stop posting to social media.\n\n“Due to a reduction in staff, NOAA GLERL’s communications services will be taking an indefinite hiatus,” it wrote on X.\n\nNOAA’s external affairs team said on its website that the entire office had been eliminated.\n\n“People’s lives are in danger. It’s not an exaggeration to say that. I’m worried. We’re coming up on tornado season, hurricane season, and that is just scratching the surface,” said Rachel Brittin, who until Thursday was the deputy director of the office. “These huge cuts to NOAA’s staff are going to affect the ability for NOAA to be effective.”\n\nThis story first appeared on NBCNews.com.

The DOH said the case was related to international travel and not a domestic outbreak.\n\nThen on Sunday, March 2, 2025, Montgomery County officials released a statement with more details on the case. They said it was related to an unvaccinated child who visited the following locations at the following times during their infectious period:\n\nFebruary 25-26, 2025\n\nChina Airlines Airport Shuttle Bus\n\nDeparting JFK Airport Terminal 4, arriving at North Philadelphia, Pho Ha Saigon, 757 Adams Avenue, Philadelphia, PA 19120\n\nFrom February 25 at 9:30 p.m. to February 26 at 3:15 a.m.\n\n\n\nChina Airlines Airport Shuttle Bus Departing JFK Airport Terminal 4, arriving at North Philadelphia, Pho Ha Saigon, 757 Adams Avenue, Philadelphia, PA 19120 From February 25 at 9:30 p.m. to February 26 at 3:15 a.m. February 26, 2025\n\nTrue North Pediatrics Associates of Plymouth\n\n3031 Walton Rd., #C101, Plymouth Meeting, PA 19462\n\n11:45. a.m. - 2:15 p.m.\n\n\n\nTrue North Pediatrics Associates of Plymouth 3031 Walton Rd., #C101, Plymouth Meeting, PA 19462 11:45. a.m. - 2:15 p.m. February 26, 2025\n\nCHOP King of Prussia Campus Emergency Department\n\n550 S.

Sign up for NBC Philadelphia's News Headlines newsletter.\n\nOfficials also told NBC10 the child is too young to be vaccinated.\n\nInvestigators are completing contact tracing and notifying anyone who was potentially exposed to determine their vaccination status and risk for infection.\n\nOfficials confirmed it's the first reported case of the measles in Pennsylvania in 2025. There were four total measles cases in Pennsylvania in 2024.\n\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control, two doses of the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine is 97% effective against measles. The DOH told NBC10 there is no immediate risk to the general public at this time and 94% of all Pennsylvania residents are vaccinated against the measles virus.\n\nInformation about measles\n\nMeasles is an extremely contagious virus that lives in the mucus membranes of the nose and throat of infected people, according to health experts. The virus can be transmitted from person to person through coughing and sneezing.\n\nWhen an infected person sneezes or coughs, droplets spray into the air and those droplets can contain an active and contagious virus which will remain in the air and on surfaces for up to two hours. A healthy person can also be infected with the measles if they breathe the contaminated air or touch an infected surface and then touch their eyes, nose or mouth.\n\nMeasles symptoms\n\nMeasles normally begin with a fever (100.4° or higher) that lasts for several days. That’s followed by a cough, runny nose and watery eyes.\n\nTwo to three days after the symptoms begin, tiny white spots may appear in the mouth. Three to five days after symptoms begin, a flat red spotted rash appears on the face at the hairline and spreads downward to the neck, trunk, arms, legs and feet. The flat red spots may also be joined by small, raised bumps.\n\nSymptoms appear about seven to 14 days on average after exposure but can last as long as 21 days.\n\nHow to prevent measles\n\nMeasles is preventable with two doses of the MMR vaccine which is available at your local health care provider or pharmacy. If you have any questions about the measles and preventing it, call the Montgomery County Office of Public Health (OPH) at 610-278-5117. You can also find more information about the measles here and information about the MMR vaccine here.\n\nWhat to do if you believe you were exposed to the measles\n\nReview your immunization and medical records to determine if you are protected against measles.\n\nConsult with your health care provider about receiving the MMR vaccine if you have not had measles infection or received the measles shot previously.\n\nContact and notify your health care provider as soon as possible about a potential exposure if you are pregnant, have a child under the age of 1, have a weakened immune system and/or are not vaccinated.\n\nMonitor yourself for illness and fever and an unexplained rash, cough, congestion, runny nose or watery eyes from 7 days to 21 days after your exposure. If symptoms develop, stay home and call a health care provider immediately.\n\nIf you believe you or your child have the measles and wish to seek care, call your health care provider, urgent care or hospital emergency room before leaving your home or contact the Montgomery County Office of Public Health at 610-278-5117 to facilitate a safe visit and reduce exposure to staff members and other patients. Health care providers should report suspected measles cases immediately to the Office of Public Health at 610-278-5117 or after hours at 610-635-4300.\n\nPeople who are immune to the measles\n\nPeople who were born in 1957 or earlier\n\nPeople who have had two doses of the MMR vaccine\n\nPeople who have had the measles\n\nPeople who are vulnerable to the measles\n\nBabies who are too young to have received the vaccine (less than a year of age)\n\nChildren who are only partially vaccinated (less than 6-years-old)\n\nPeople who were vaccinated with an inactivated or unknown type of vaccine which was used from 1963 through 1967 and have not been revaccinated\n\nPeople born after 1957 who have only received one dose of vaccine\n\nPeople who have refused vaccination\n\nPeople from areas of the world where there is low vaccine coverage or currently circulating measles\n\nImmune-compromised people such as organ transplant recipient, people receiving chemotherapy or people living with HIV/AIDS\n\nMeasles outbreak in Texas\n\nLast week, the U.S. registered its first death from measles since 2025 as a child who wasn’t vaccinated died in a measles outbreak in rural West Texas.\n\nNormally, most U.S. cases are brought into the country by people who have traveled overseas. So far, Texas state officials have reported 124 cases. New Mexico has reported nine.\n\nExperts point to declining measles vaccination rates worldwide since the COVID-19 pandemic. In the United States, most states now are below the 95% vaccination threshold for kindergartners — the level needed to protect communities against measles outbreaks.\n\nBritain reported 2,911 confirmed measles cases in 2024, the highest number of cases recorded annually, since 2012.\n\nMeasles cases in the United States last year were nearly double the total for all of 2023, raising concerns about the preventable, once-common childhood virus. Health officials confirmed measles cases in at least 18 states in 2024, including in New York City, Philadelphia and Chicago.",

        "source": "https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/",
        "content": "Chip giant Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. plans to invest $100 billion in the United States, President Donald Trump said Monday, on top of $65 billion in investments the company had previously announced.\n\nTSMC, the world’s biggest semiconductor manufacturer, produces chips for companies including Apple, Intel and Nvidia. The company had already begun constructing three plants in Arizona after the Biden administration offered billions in subsidies. Its first factory in Arizona has started mass production of its 4-nanometer chips.\n\nTrump, who appeared with TSMC’s chief executive officer C. C. Wei at the White House, called it a “tremendous move” and \"a matter of economic security.”\n\n“Semiconductors are the backbone of the 21st century economy. And really, without the semiconductors, there is no economy,\" the president said. \"Powering everything from AI to automobiles to advanced manufacturing, we must be able to build the chips and semiconductors that we need right here in American factories with Americans skill and American labor.”\n\nGet top local stories in Philly delivered to you every morning. Sign up for NBC Philadelphia's News Headlines newsletter.\n\nWei said the investment will be for three more chip manufacturing plants, along with two packaging facilities, in Arizona.\n\nThe $165 billion investment \"is going to create thousands of high-paying jobs,” Wei said.\n\nFormer President Joe Biden in 2022 signed a sweeping $280 billion law, the CHIPS and Science Act, to try to reinvigorate chip manufacturing in the U.S., especially after the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nDuring the pandemic, chip factories, especially those overseas making the majority of processors, shut down. It had a ripple effect that led to wider problems, such as automobile factory assembly lines shutting down and fueled inflation.\n\nTrump has criticized the law and taken a different approach, instead threatening to impose high tariffs on imported chips to bring chip manufacturing back to the U.S.\n\nTrump also has said companies like TSMC do not need federal tax incentives.\n\nWhen asked if the new investment could minimize impact on the U.S. should China either isolate or seize Taiwan, Trump said he couldn’t say “minimize” because “that would be a catastrophic event obviously.”\n\nTaiwan is an island that broke away from mainland China in 1949 following a civil war. Beijing claims sovereignty over the island and has ratcheted up military and diplomatic pressure on its leaders.\n\n“It will at least give us a position where we have, in this very, very important business, we would have a very big part of it in the United States,” Trump said of the chip manufacturing.\n\nHe did not say if the investment would provide security for the self-governed island that Beijing considers to be part of Chinese territory.\n\nTaipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office, the island’s de-facto embassy in the United States, said investments by Taiwanese businesses in the U.S. have exceeded 40% of the island’s total foreign investments and that the Taiwanese government is “glad” to see Taiwanese businesses to expand investments in the U.S. and to deep cooperation on supply chain between the two sides.\n\n“It also brings the economic and trade relations closer,” the office said.\n\nBonnie Glaser, managing director of the Indo-Pacific program at German Marshall Fund of the U.S., said Taipei is hoping the increased investment pledge will help keep the U.S.-Taiwan relationship strong. “Taiwan is evidently stepping up in a way that supports and advanced President Trump’s priorities,” she said. “The US will benefit greatly from TSMC’s investment.”\n\nTrump has yet to indicate his stance on U.S. support for Taiwan’s security since he took office, and he has said Taiwan should pay the U.S. for its military defense.\n\nTrump has hosted multiple business leaders at the White House since he took office in January to tout a series of investments that aim to demonstrate his leadership is a boon for the U.S. economy. He's also pointed to the tariff threats as prodding the investments.\n\n“It’s the incentive we’ve created. Or the negative incentive,” Trump said.\n\nIn January, he appeared with the heads of OpenAI, Oracle and SoftBank at the White House as they announced plans for a new partnership to invest up to $500 billion for infrastructure tied to artificial intelligence. He also announced in January a $20 billion investment by DAMAC Properties in the United Arab Emirates to build data centers tied to AI.\n\nLast week, after Apple CEO Tim Cook met with Trump at the White House, the company announced plans to invest more than $500 billion in the U.S. over the next four years, including plans for a new server factory in Texas. Trump said after their meeting that Cook promised him Apple's manufacturing would shift from Mexico to the U.S.\n\n“I don’t have time to do all of these announcements,\" Trump joked Monday as he listed some of the other investments.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal first reported the planned announcement Monday.",

        "content": "Pope Francis had stabilized enough Tuesday after two respiratory crises to be taken off noninvasive mechanical ventilation and receive just high flows of supplemental oxygen, as he continued his more than two-week long fight against double pneumonia, the Vatican said.\n\nFrancis, 88, woke up and was resuming respiratory physiotherapy after sleeping through the night, the Vatican said.\n\nThe Vatican said as of Tuesday morning, Francis no longer needed to wear the mechanical ventilation mask that covers his nose and mouth to pump oxygen into his lungs and was just receiving supplemental oxygen through a nasal tube.\n\nHe had to resume using the mask on Monday after suffering two respiratory crises that required doctors to extract “copious” amounts of mucus from his lungs. Doctors performed two bronchoscopies, in which a camera-tipped tube was sent into his airways with a sucker at the tip to suction out fluid.\n\nGet top local stories in Philly delivered to you every morning. Sign up for NBC Philadelphia's News Headlines newsletter.\n\nThe 88-year-old pope, who has chronic lung disease and had part of one lung removed as a young man, remained alert, oriented and cooperated with medical personnel, the Vatican said. The prognosis remained guarded, meaning he was not out of danger. Doctors didn’t say if he remained in stable condition, though they referred to the crises in the past tense.\n\nThe fact that Francis no longer needed the ventilation mask by Tuesday morning was a sign that he had stabilized some after the crises, but still within what doctors have said was a complex respiratory picture.\n\nThe crises were a new setback in what has become a more than two-week battle by the frail pope to overcome a complex respiratory infection.\n\nThe Vatican said the mucus that had accumulated in Francis' lungs was his body’s reaction to the original pneumonia infection and not a new infection, given laboratory tests don’t indicate any new bacteria.\n\nDr. John Coleman, a pulmonary critical care doctor at Northwestern Medicine in Chicago, said the episodes were more concerning than the l ast one on Friday, in which Francis had a coughing fit, inhaled some vomit that needed to be extracted and then was put on the noninvasive mechanical ventilation for a day and then didn’t need it anymore.\n\nThe use of bronchoscopies reflects a worrying level of mucus and phlegm in the lungs, Coleman said. “The fact that they had to go in there and remove it manually is concerning, because it means that he is not clearing the secretions on his own,” he said.\n\n“He’s taking little steps forward and then steps back,” said Coleman, who is not involved in Francis’ care.\n\nFrancis, who is not physically active, uses a wheelchair and is overweight, had been undergoing respiratory physiotherapy to try to improve his lung function. But the accumulation of the secretions in his lungs was a sign that he doesn’t have the muscle tone to cough vigorously enough to expel the fluid.\n\nDoctors often use noninvasive ventilation to stave off an intubation, or the use of invasive mechanical ventilation. Francis has not been intubated during this hospitalization. It’s not clear if he has provided any advance directives about the limits of his care if he declines or loses consciousness.\n\nCatholic teaching holds that life must be defended from conception until natural death. It insists that chronically ill patients, including those in vegetative states, must receive “ordinary” care such as hydration and nutrition, but “extraordinary” or disproportionate care can be suspended if it is no longer beneficial or is only prolonging a precarious and painful life.\n\nFrancis articulated that in a 2017 speech to a meeting of the Vatican’s bioethics think tank, the Pontifical Academy for Life. He said there was “no obligation to have recourse in all circumstances to every possible remedy.” He added: “It thus makes possible a decision that is morally qualified as withdrawal of ‘overzealous treatment.’”\n\nArchbishop Vincenzo Paglia, who heads the academy which helps articulate the Catholic Church’s position on end-of-life care, said Francis is like any other Catholic and would follow church teaching if it came to that.\n\n“Today the pope is giving us an extraordinary teaching on fragility,” he told reporters Monday. “Today the pope, not through words but with his body, is reminding all of us, we elderly people to begin with, that we are all fragile and therefore we need to take care of each other.”\n\nFrancis’ hospitalization, which hits 18 nights Tuesday, is by no means reaching the papal record that was set during St. John Paul II’s numerous lengthy hospitalizations over a quarter century. The longest single hospitalization occurred in 1981, when John Paul spent 55 days in Gemelli for a minor operation and then to be treated for a serious infection that followed.",

        "content": "Reuben Frank and Dave Zangaro bring back Stay or Go in 2025, trying to figure out the futures of every Eagles player on the roster.\n\nWe already took a look at quarterback, running back, receiver, tight end, interior offensive line, offensive tackle, specialists and edge rusher.\n\nUp today: Defensive tackle\n\nThomas Booker IV\n\nGet top local stories in Philly delivered to you every morning. Sign up for NBC Philadelphia's News Headlines newsletter.\n\nRoob: Booker ate up some snaps in that interior line rotation – about 10 per game – and he wasn’t terrible, but he really didn’t do anything to make you think it was a priority to bring him back. Booker is a free agent and if he comes back it’ll be on a minimum-wage deal that will give him an opportunity in training camp with no guarantees. I think the Eagles can do better with a rotational interior lineman.\n\nVerdict: Goes\n\nDave: He didn’t play a ton in 2024 but Booker was able to give the Eagles 166 defensive snaps in the regular season and they were quality snaps. He ended up with a sack, 2 QB hits, 2 TFLs and 4 pressures in limited chances. Booker is 25 but could theoretically see his role grow this season depending on what happens in the offseason. It’s not a lock that he makes the team but Booker flashed enough to keep around.\n\nVerdict: Stays\n\nJalen Carter\n\nRoob: Just a monster Year 2 from Jalen Carter, who established himself as one of the top young interior linemen in the NFL. Any questions about his fitness or his durability or his work ethic were answered resoundingly as Carter played 84 percent of the Eagles’ defensive snaps, despite leaving every blowout win early. During one six-game stretch as the Eagles were chasing the No. 1 seed late in the season, Carter averaged 91 percent of the snaps. The best thing about Carter is that he genuinely doesn’t care if he makes a play or occupies a couple linemen to allow someone else to make a play. When he’s doubled, he’s opening things up for someone else. When he’s singled, he’s going to dominate. A truly elite young lineman without a trace of selfishness. Can't wait to see where he takes his career next.\n\nVerdict: Stays\n\nDave: We saw the kind of jump from Jalen Carter in his second season that the Eagles hoped they would see. Carter is a special player and he’s just scratching the surface of how good he can be in the NFL. The most impressive thing about Carter’s season is how many snaps he was able to play throughout the season. The one word we heard with Carter all of last offseason was “conditioning” and for good reason. Vic Fangio played Carter a ton in 2024 and Carter somehow never wore down. Carter had just 4 1/2 sacks in 2024 but don’t let that fool you. He was an absolute game-wrecker and got doubled-teamed at a really high rate. And then he ended up with a couple sacks in the playoffs, including a huge one against Matthew Stafford and the Rams to help close out that game. The Eagles might not have even made it to the NFC Championship Game without Carter’s efforts. He won’t be eligible for a contract extension until next offseason but Carter shouldn’t be going anywhere for a long time.\n\nVerdict: Stays\n\nJordan Davis\n\nRoob: Davis is an interesting guy. Has he played up to expectations as the 13th pick in the 2022 draft? Nah. But he plays a very important role as a run stuffer on the NFL’s top-ranked defense and he does it well. He even showed some pass rush ability in the postseason with a couple sacks. Will the Eagles exercise his 5th-year option at $11 ½ million or risk losing him after 2025? I’m guessing they either exercise his option or sign him to a long-term deal. He’s not a guy who’s going to pile up fancy stats, but where are you going to find an athletic 6-foot-4, 345-pound interior lineman who can eat up blocks, stuff the run and occasionally get to the quarterback? I think Vic Fangio wants him around beyond 2025, and I expect Howie Roseman to make that happen.\n\nVerdict: Stays\n\nDave: The Eagles have a decision to make on Davis this offseason. They have until May 2 to pick up the fifth-year option on Davis’s rookie contract, which is for just under $11.5 million in the 2026 season. This isn’t a slam-dunk decision but the Eagles will probably exercise this option. Davis played just 388 snaps (37%) in 2024 and he hasn’t really been worth the No. 13 pick. But Davis is a really run-stuffer who eats double teams and is a big piece of the locker room. Davis will enter Year 4 in 2024 and sometimes it can take a long time for defensive tackles to reach their potential in the NFL. Davis is massive and has unique athleticism that is worth seeing through.\n\nVerdict: Stays\n\nGabe Hall\n\nRoob: The Eagles kept Hall around on the practice squad as an undrafted rookie out of Baylor and re-signed him to a futures contract, and he could be earmarked for the practice squad again but hard to imagine room for him on the 53.\n\nVerdict: Goes\n\nDave: After the 2024 draft, the Eagles didn’t sign very many undrafted players but Hall was one that stuck on the practice squad all of last season. Hall (6-6, 291) has some traits that are worth developing, which is why the practice squad is still probably where he belongs in 2025.\n\nVerdict: Goes\n\nMoro Ojomo\n\nRoob: Another young lineman who showed significant growth as the season went on. Ojomo improved to the point where he averaged 23 snaps per game during the regular season and 26 per game in the postseason. On a top-ranked defense on a team making a deep postseason run, that’s impressive stuff for a 23-year-old former 7th-round pick. When you can find contributors in the seventh round, you’re really helping yourself.\n\nVerdict: Stays\n\nDave: The Eagles might have found something in Ojomo. He was a 7th-round pick in 2023 and definitely showed a lot of growth from Year 1 to Year 2. He’s a player who will likely need to have an expanded role as he prepares to go into the third year of his career. While he didn’t have a sack all regular season, Ojomo came through with one in the fourth quarter against the Rams to help the Eagles get to the NFC Championship Game. Ojomo in the regular season and playoffs had a pressure rate of 9.5%, which was second among Eagles’ DTs behind only Milton Williams at 12.3% in 2024.\n\nVerdict: Stays\n\nByron Young\n\nRoob: Young was a Raiders 3rd-round pick out of Alabama in 2023, so you know there’s something there. He didn’t play a snap this year – was either inactive or on Injured Reserve all year. With his pedigree he’s got a shot at finding a roster spot with a strong training camp, but he’s still a longshot.\n\nVerdict: Goes\n\nDave: It’ll be good to get a longer look at Young in training camp this summer. The former 3rd-round pick was claimed by the Eagles in August after the Raiders released him at final cuts. He never played in a game (inactive the first six weeks) before landing on Injured Reserve. The Eagles actually activated Young’s practice window but then shut him down for the season. This one is hard because we really haven’t seen much of Young at all. It’s possible he can earn a roster spot but for now, I have him off the roster.\n\nVerdict: Goes\n\nMilton Williams\n\nRoob: A tricky one. Williams’ price skyrocketed this year as he had his best regular season and then an outstanding postseason and superb Super Bowl. He may have priced himself right out of the Eagles’ range. Williams is now considered by many one of the top free agents regardless of position in the entire market. He has a unique skill set, with the ability to get after the quarterback, stop the run and even line up outside on early downs. Like most of the Eagles’ free agents, Williams wants to be here, but if the money is appreciably better somewhere else, he’s not going to stick around. So Howie Roseman's challenge is to make the money make sense for Williams. I do expect Howie to make Williams Priority 2 behind Zack Baun but a close Priority 2. If it means losing Josh Sweat and Mekhi Becton, I think Roseman will do that to keep Williams.\n\nVerdict: Stays\n\nDave: Williams is exactly the kind of player the Eagles want to prioritize and keep. He’s a homegrown 3rd-round pick, who plays a premium position and who hasn’t even turned 26 yet. The problem is that Zack Baun has to be the Eagles’ priority this offseason and I just don’t think they’ll be able to sign both of them this offseason. And Williams is about to get paid. Even before his 2-sack performance in the Super Bowl, Williams already had a career season in Year 4 with 5 sacks, 10 QB hits and 7 TFLs. He was a really good complement to Carter on the interior of the Eagles’ defensive line. Sure, he benefited from all the double-teams that Carter saw but it’s not like it’s easy to consistently win 1-on-1s in the NFL and Williams did that at a really high rate. Spotrac estimates Williams’ next contract to be three years, $36 million for an annual average of $12 million. That feels way too low. If that’s the deal, sure, do it. But Alim McNeill, who was drafted a spot ahead of Williams and who plays DT too, just got a four-year, $97 million contract. Even if Williams doesn’t touch that, I still think he’s going to end up out of the Eagles’ range.\n\nVerdict: Goes\n\nSubscribe to Eagle Eye anywhere you get your podcasts:\n\nApple Podcasts | YouTube Music | Spotify | Stitcher | Simplecast | RSS | Watch on YouTube",

        "content": "The Eagles are coming off a Super Bowl victory, which means they’re going to have to wait a while to make their first pick.\n\nThe last time the Birds won the Super Bowl they ended up trading out of pick 32 when the Ravens came calling about Lamar Jackson. So we know they’ll listen to offers if there’s a similar situation.\n\nBut there’s also an opportunity to land a good player if they stay at 32. Here’s a first-round mock draft:\n\n1. Titans: Cam Ward, QB, Miami\n\nGet top local stories in Philly delivered to you every morning. Sign up for NBC Philadelphia's News Headlines newsletter.\n\nThe Titans might be willing to trade out of this spot if they don’t completely fall in love with Ward but if they think he’s the best QB in this draft, they have to be willing to take him here. That doesn’t mean the Titans won’t think about a trade or thinking about picking Abdul Carter, but the most likely scenario is them sticking and picking Ward at this spot.\n\n2. Browns: Abdul Carter, Edge, Penn State\n\nThe Browns have tried to make it very clear that they aren’t interested in trading Myles Garrett but we’ll see what happens there. Either way, Carter is a generational talent at edge rusher. He will either be the replacement for Garrett or could be a dynamic rusher on the other side of the line.\n\n3. Giants: Shedeur Sanders, QB, Colorado\n\nThe Giants have to get a quarterback, right? Perhaps it’ll happen through a trade up to No. 1 to land Ward. But if not, can’t you just see Sanders ending up with the Giants? He’s the type of pick the Giants would hope to turn around a franchise that has been aimless in recent seasons. And he has the type of confidence to thrive with a ton of attention on him.\n\n4. Patriots: Travis Hunter, WR/CB, Colorado\n\nThe Patriots get one of the most talented players in this draft. Is he a receiver? Is he a cornerback? Figure it out later. Mike Vrabel can give Hunter a chance to major in one position and minor in the other. The Patriots seem to like Hunter quite a bit. They have less of a pressing need at cornerback because they already have Christian Gonzalez. But if there’s any coach willing to have Hunter play on both sides a bit, maybe it’s Vrabel. The former NFL linebacker played a bit on offense during his playing days.\n\n5. Jaguars: Mason Graham, DT, Michigan\n\nThe Jaguars could go offensive line here even without a super pressing need. But Graham’s value and a Jags’ need line up here. Graham was a stud at Michigan and is one of the most talented players overall in this class.\n\n6. Raiders: Tetairoa McMillan, WR, Arizona\n\nThe Raiders are a team that might be willing to trade up to find a quarterback. But with both of the top ones gone in this mock draft, they find a guy they hope will be their WR1 for years to come. McMillan (6-4, 219) is a big and rangey receiver who has drawn comparisons to Drake London. The Raiders need a WR1 ahead of Jakobi Meyers and Tre Tucker.\n\n7. Jets: Will Johnson, CB, Michigan\n\nThe Jets will ned to replace D.J. Reed if the veteran leaves in free agency and they can do that with the top cornerback in this year’s class. Pairing Johnson with Sauce Gardner can set up the Jets’ secondary for a long time. And new head coach Aaron Glenn is a former cornerback and DBs coach who might be able to get the most out of Johnson.\n\n8. Panthers: Mykel Williams, Edge, Georgia\n\nThe Panthers are a team with plenty of needs but generating more pass rush should be at the top of the list. Williams played most of the 2024 season with an ankle injury, which clearly affected him. If you look past that, Williams is a versatile rusher with a ton of physical traits that should be exciting for a team building again.\n\n9. Saints: Shemar Stewart, Edge, Texas A&M\n\nThe Saints desperately need to find more pass rush in 2025 and they’ll have an opportunity to do it here with a player who wowed at the Combine. Sure, the sack production in college wasn’t great but sometimes edge is a position where you draft traits. And Stewart’s athleticism popped in Indy.\n\n10. Bears: Will Campbell, OT, LSU\n\nThis would be a dream scenario for the Bears. They got their QB last year when they drafted Caleb Williams but they desperately need to find a way to protect him better. Some think Campbell is a guard in the NFL and some think he’s a tackle. The good news is that the Bears need help pretty much everywhere. Find his best spot, plug and play.\n\n11. 49ers: Kelvin Banks Jr., OT, Texas\n\nThe Niners need some help on their offensive line. Banks could fill in at right tackle but could also be the future replacement for Trent Williams, who will be 37 when the 2025 season begins.\n\n12. Cowboys: Ashton Jeanty, RB, Boise State\n\nThis one feels almost too obvious. You can certainly argue about the value of taking a running back at 12, especially given the expected depth at the position in this year’s class. But it’s hard to question Jeanty’s ability. He was the best running back in the country in 2024 and has an extremely high ceiling in the NFL. He’s already a great runner and has the ability to be a good pass catcher. The Cowboys have drafted a running back in the first round before and they could do it again after watching how much Saquon Barkley transformed the Eagles in 2024.\n\n13. Dolphins: Armand Membou, OT, Missouri\n\nThe Dolphins need to protect Tua Tagovailoa. Not only do the Dolphins need guards, but Terron Armstead doesn’t know if he wants to keep playing and the Dolphins are operating as if he won’t be back. So getting a guy like Membou would help. Some see him as a tackle and some see him as a guard. Membou doesn’t have great length, which has led to guard projections but some teams will still like him on the edge.\n\n14. Colts: Tyler Warren, TE, Penn State\n\nThe Colts get to sit there at 14 and take one of the best overall players in this draft and the type of player who could be a big difference maker in the career of QB Anthony Richardson. Shane Steichen would love to get a dual-threat playmaker like Warren on his team.\n\n15. Falcons: Jalon Walker, Edge, Georgia\n\nThe Falcons need some help on defense and Walker is an explosive and versatile player. He has played off-ball linebacker as well as edge rusher and his versatility is impressive. Walker has drawn Nolan Smith comps during this pre-draft process.\n\n16. Cardinals: Mike Green, Edge, Marshall\n\nIf you had concerns about Green’s level of competition, he was able to go to Senior Bowl and prove that he wasn’t lucky to lead the nation in sacks in 2024. The Cardinals could definitely use some firepower off the edge.\n\n17. Bengals: Walter Nolen, DT, Ole Miss\n\nThe Bengals could use a boost on the interior of their defensive line and a player like Nolen has the ability to be a disruptive interior pass rusher at the NFL level. Nolen (6-4, 296) should be a three-down player in the league.\n\n18. Seahawks: Tyler Booker, OL, Alabama\n\nIt might not always seem like the best idea to spend a big pick like this on a guy who is considered to be a guard-only prospect but if the Seahawks can plug-and-play Booker to protect Geno Smith, it makes a lot of sense. Booker feels like a pretty safe, high-floor pick.\n\n19. Buccaneers: Emeka Egbuka, WR, Ohio State\n\nMike Evans is winding down his Hall of Fame career and the Bucs will want to keep their offense rolling. It might not seem like their biggest need but landing a player like Egbuka (6-1, 202) would mean replenishing while also getting another weapon for Baker Mayfield. Egbuka can play inside or out and that versatility should help him fit in.\n\n20. Broncos: Colston Loveland, TE, Michigan\n\nThe Broncos’ top need happens to line up with good value to get Loveland at No. 20. He’d be an immediate difference maker for the Broncos offense.\n\n21. Steelers: Matthew Golden, WR, Texas\n\nGolden (5-11, 191) ran a blazing 4.29 at the Combine and has the versatility to play inside and outside at the next level. He can also stretch the field for a Steelers’ team that needs a reboot at the receiver position.\n\n22. Chargers: Kenneth Grant, DT Michigan\n\nGrant is an enormous interior defensive lineman at 6-foot-3, 342 pounds. He didn’t work out at the Combine because of a hamstring injury but is expected to show off what he can do at the Michigan pro day. Grant could be a difference-maker on the interior of that line.\n\n23. Packers: Jahdae Barron, CB, Texas\n\nThe future of Jaire Alexander in Green Bay is very much in question. While Barron might not be your prototypical outside CB1, he’s a versatile player for a defense that already has Xavier McKinney. It would be fun to watch a secondary with those two ballhawks.\n\n24. Vikings: Malaki Starks, S, Georgia\n\nIt’s hard to believe that Harrison Smith is 36 but he is and it’s time to replace him. Starks is a versatile defensive back who can play a few different positions on defense. He has been considered a first round pick for a long time.\n\n25. Texans: Luther Burden III, WR, Missouri\n\nBurden didn’t have a super productive year in 2024 but he was over 1,200 yards in 2023. And he went to the Combine this year and ran a 4.41. He’s an athletic and speedy inside-outside receiver for a team that could use some help, especially after Tank Dell’s season-ending injury in 2024.\n\n26. Rams: Josh Simmons, OT, Ohio State\n\nWe’ll see if the Rams are able to re-sign Alaric Jackson. But even if they do, Rob Havenstein is 32 now and it’s not a bad idea to think about the future. Simmons suffered a knee injury in October so his health is a question. But if the Rams are in a position to be patient with him, it could pay off in the long term.\n\n27. Ravens: Donovan Jackson, OL, Ohio State\n\nThe Ravens left side of the offensive line is heading toward free agency. So whether they see Jackson as a tackle or guard, he has a good chance of cracking the lineup in Year 1. Most seems to view Jackson as in interior lineman but he has played some tackle.\n\n28. Lions: James Pearce, Edge, Tennessee\n\nAt 6-foot-5, 245 pounds, Pearce had an eye-popping 40-yard dash of 4.47 seconds at the Combine. The Lions need to find an edge rusher to put opposite Aidan Hutchinson. At times, the pass rush was too much all about him in 2024. Pearce has some juice.\n\n29. Commanders: Omarion Hampton, RB, North Carolina\n\nThe Commanders have a fine running back in Brian Robinson Jr., but he’s not a game-changer. For an offense that was pretty dynamic with rookie Jayden Daniels in 2024, the thought of adding a weapon like Hampton to the mix is intriguing. He’s a big, bruising back who would basically be an easy upgrade over Robinson. After watching how Saquon Barkley changed everything for the Eagles, the Commanders try to get their own feature back.\n\n30. Bills: Jihaad Campbell, LB, Alabama\n\nThis isn’t an obvious need for the Bills but Matt Milano is 30 now and he has struggled to stay on the field the last two years. The Buffalo defense really misses him when he’s not out there. And Terrel Bernard is also entering the final year of his deal. Campbell has the ability to play off-ball but also rush the passer. He’s a unique player and if he somehow lasts this long into the first round, it would be an intriguing pairing with him and the Bills.\n\n31. Chiefs: Josh Conerly, OT, Oregon\n\nWe all watched Super Bowl LIX. The Chiefs need to figure out their left tackle spot. Joe Thuney held it together for a while but he got exposed in New Orleans. Conerly (6-5, 311) has the right frame and put together a strong Combine.\n\n32. Eagles: Donovan Ezeiruaku, Edge, Boston College\n\nThis pick makes a lot of sense and it goes beyond Ezieruaku’s ties to the area. (Ezierauku is from South Jersey and played at Williamstown High School.) The Eagles’ edge rusher position is in a state of flux this offseason. Josh Sweat is a free agent, Brandon Graham might retire and who knows what the Eagles will get out of Bryce Huff in 2025. That leaves the Eagles with just Nolan Smith and Jalyx Hunt. Edge rusher is too important of a position to not reload.\n\nAnd Ezeiruaku is worthy of a first-round pick. He had 16 1/2 sacks in 2024 but before you worry about the level of competition, Ezeiruaku went to the Senior Bowl and dominated and then followed it up with a strong performance in Indianapolis. At 6-2, 248 pounds, Ezeiruaku isn’t the biggest guy but his arms are 34 inches so he has sneaky length (69th percentile among edges). He also dominated the 3-cone (6.94) and short-shuttle (4.19) at the Combine.\n\nSubscribe to Eagle Eye anywhere you get your podcasts:\n\nApple Podcasts | YouTube Music | Spotify | Stitcher | Simplecast | RSS | Watch on YouTube",

Its maiden voyage broke the transatlantic speed record in both directions when it reached an average speed of 36 knots or just over 41 mph. To this day, the SS United States holds the transatlantic speed record for an ocean liner.\n\nOfficials in Okaloosa County on Florida’s coastal Panhandle hope the ship will become a barnacle-encrusted standout among the county’s more than 500 artificial reefs and a signature diving attraction that could generate millions of dollars annually in local tourism spending for scuba shops, charter fishing boats and hotels.\n\nThe SS United States has, perhaps, shown why it was once the fastest ocean liner in the world as the rusted ship -- long a fixture of the Delaware River waterfront in South Philadelphia -- has ended its final voyage two days ahead of schedule.\n\nAfter nearly 30 years, the historic SS United States departed Philadelphia on Wednesday, Feb. 19, 2025, to begin a 1,800-mile journey to Mobile, Alabama, where it will be prepared to become an artificial reef.\n\nIn a statement, officials said that the final voyage ended on Monday, March 3, 2025.\n\nGet top local stories in Philly delivered to you every morning.

As she moved through the waves for the first time in 28 years, countless onlookers and admirers along the country’s eastern seaboard were inspired by her majesty and beauty,\" said SS United States Conservancy president Susan Gibbs in a statement on the ship's 401st voyage.\n\nOrganizers said, in a statement that the ship will now undergo a remediation process that will see items like command bridge components, engine room equipment, wires, cables, loose items, flooring, furnishings, fuel, paint, and contaminants -- possibly including asbestos -- removed from the vessel before it is taken to Florida.\n\nThis process is expected to take until the end of this year.\n\nOnce the process is completed, the remains of the vessel will be taken to Florida's Okaloosa County, where organizers plan to create a museum and visitor's center near where the SS United States will become the, what organizers called, the \"world's largest artificial reef.\"\n\nAccording to organizers with the SS United States Conservancy, there is also a documentary on the history of the vessel in the works, as well.",

Police were also expected to keep the hundreds of participants and dozens of floats moving quickly so they finished before winds were predicted to pick up, according to New Orleans Police Superintendent Anne Kirkpatrick.\n\nThe alarming forecast was one of the first big tests for the National Weather Service after hundreds of forecasters were fired last week as part of President Donald Trump's moves to slash the size of the federal government. Former employees said the firing of meteorologists who make crucial local forecasts across the U.S. could put lives at risk.\n\nCountry faces a number of weather threats\n\nGet top local stories in Philly delivered to you every morning.

Cities under threat included Baton Rouge and Shreveport in Louisiana; Jackson, Mississippi; and Mobile, Alabama.\n\nNew Orleans braces for severe weather during Mardi Gras\n\nThe New Orleans area was also preparing for strong storms, though Fat Tuesday's traditionally raucous annual rite of parades of floats and costumed merrymakers remained scheduled to hit the streets, with some changes still being worked out by authorities and leaders of “krewes” — social clubs that organize the parades.\n\nKirkpatrick ordered parade-goers to not bring umbrellas, tents or “anything that could fly in the wind and cause mayhem.” She warned that she may need to cancel the parades at the last minute if the weather gets worse.\n\n“I hold that trump card in which I will not hesitate to cancel — I won’t do it lightly, but I will do it,” she said.\n\nTwo other parades that had been scheduled to roll through the city later on Tuesday with nearly 200 truck floats were postponed, Kirkpatrick said.\n\nJust outside New Orleans in neighboring Jefferson Parish, officials canceled planned Mardi Gras Day parades due to anticipated high winds and thunderstorms.\n\n“This is disappointing, but our top priority is ensuring the well-being of everyone in our community, and we must always prioritize safety above all else,” Jefferson Parish President Cynthia Lee Sheng said in a statement.\n\nMardi Gras floats “could become unstable” and heavy winds could “blow down trees and power lines,” the National Weather Service warned, adding gusts of up to 60 mph (97 kph) were expected Tuesday afternoon.\n\nIn Pointe Coupee Parish, near Louisiana’s capital city of Baton Rouge, the incoming weather forced drastic changes to one of the oldest Mardi Gras celebrations in the state. The parade there was scheduled to roll without any bands, marching teams or dance groups — a staple of Carnival Season parades.\n\nOfficials also moved the parade start time up and urged residents to immediately remove all tents and trash after the parade ends “due to the dangers they can present during weather.”\n\nOther cities with Mardi Gras parades watching forecasts\n\nElsewhere, large crowds were expected Tuesday for Mardi Gras celebrations in Mobile, Alabama. Police there said they were continuing to monitor the forecast and would let the public know if plans for the celebration changed.\n\nOther cities hosting large Mardi Gras events included Biloxi, Mississippi, where an annual Mardi Gras parade was scheduled to start at 1 p.m. Tuesday.\n\nIn downtown Pensacola in the Florida Panhandle, organizers were planning a Big Easy-style Mardi Gras festival that included food trucks, dancing, live entertainment and a low country seafood boil.\n\n_____\n\nMartin reported from Atlanta.

        "content": "President Donald Trump said Monday that 25% taxes on imports from Mexico and Canada would start Tuesday, sparking renewed fears of a North American trade war that already showed signs of pushing up inflation and hindering growth.\n\n“Tomorrow — tariffs 25% on Canada and 25% on Mexico. And that’ll start,” Trump told reporters in the Roosevelt Room. “They’re going to have to have a tariff.”\n\nTrump has said the tariffs are to force the two U.S. neighbors to step up their fight against fentanyl trafficking and stop illegal immigration. But Trump has also indicated that he wants to even the trade imbalance with both countries as well and push more factories to relocate in the United States.\n\nHis comments quickly rattled the U.S. stock market, with the S&P 500 index down 2% in Monday afternoon trading. It's a sign of the political and economic risks that Trump feels compelled to take, given the possibility of higher inflation and the possible demise of a decades-long trade partnership with Mexico and Canada.\n\nGet top local stories in Philly delivered to you every morning. Sign up for NBC Philadelphia's News Headlines newsletter.\n\nTariffs or customs duties are a tax on products purchased from abroad, and they are used by practically all countries\n\nYet the Trump administration remains confident that tariffs are the best choice to boost U.S. manufacturing and attract foreign investment. Before Trump's statement on tariffs in response to a question on Tuesday, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said that the computer chipmaker TSMC had expanded its investment in the United States because of the possibility of separate 25% tariffs.\n\nIn February, Trump put a 10% tariff on imports from China and reemphasized on Monday that the rate would be doubling to 20% on Tuesday.\n\nTrump provided a one-month delay in February as both Mexico and Canada promised concessions. But Trump said Monday that there was “no room left for Mexico or for Canada” to avoid the steep new tariffs, which were also set to tax Canadian energy products such as oil and electricity at a lower 10% rate.\n\n“If Trump is imposing tariffs, we are ready,\" said Canadian Foreign Minister Mélanie Joly. \"We are ready with $155 billion worth of tariffs and we’re ready with the first tranche of tariffs, which is $30 billion.”\n\nJoly said Canada has a very strong border plan and explained that to Trump administration officials last week. She said the diplomatic efforts are continuing. She spoke after Trump made his comments Tuesday.\n\nMexico President Claudia Sheinbaum went into Monday waiting to see what Trump would say.\n\n“It’s a decision that depends on the United States government, on the United States president,” Sheinbaum said ahead of Trump's statement. “So whatever his decision is, we will make our decisions and there is a plan, there is unity in Mexico.”\n\nBoth countries have tried to show action in response to Trump's concerns. Mexico sent 10,000 National Guard troops to their shared border to crack down on drug trafficking and illegal immigration. Canada named a fentanyl czar, even though smuggling of the drug from Canada into the United States appears to be relatively modest.\n\nAs late as Sunday, it remained unclear what choice Trump would make on tariff rates. Lutnick told Fox News Channel’s “Sunday Morning Futures” that the decision was “fluid.”\n\n“He’s sort of thinking about right now how exactly he wants to play it with Mexico and Canada,” Lutnick said. “And that is a fluid situation. There are going to be tariffs on Tuesday on Mexico and Canada. Exactly what they are, we’re going to leave that for the president and his team to negotiate.”\n\nTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Mexico has also offered to place 20% taxes on all imports from China as part of talks with the United States.\n\nBessent told CBS News on Sunday that China would “eat” the cost of the tariffs, instead of passing them along to the U.S. businesses and consumers that import their products in the form of higher prices.\n\nBut companies ranging from Ford to Walmart have warned about the negative impact that tariffs could create for their businesses. Similarly, multiple analyses by the Peterson Institute for International Economics and the Yale University Budget Lab suggest that an average family could face price increases of more than $1,000.\n\nTrump also plans to roll out what he calls “reciprocal” tariffs on April that would match the rate charged by other countries, including any subsidies and and value added taxes charged by those countries.\n\nThe U.S. president has already announced the removal of exemptions from his 2018 tariffs on steel and aluminum, in addition to tariffs on autos, computer chips, copper and pharmaceutical drugs.",

        "content": "When Spanish actress Penélope Cruz announced “I'm Still Here” as the winner of the international feature at the Academy Awards, millions of Brazilians roared at home and on the streets, where Carnival festivities have been ongoing since Saturday.\n\nOn Monday, as parties continued nationwide, many revelers took time to take a quick look at newspapers, peek on their social media and watch TV to rejoice even more for the country's first-ever Oscar victory. The film shows a family torn apart by the military dictatorship that ruled Brazil for more than two decades.\n\n“I promised I would watch ‘ I’m Still Here ' again tonight if it won, right after I come back from a Carnival street party, wearing my Wonder Woman costume,” said Fernanda Rocha, 38, a pharmacist and tourist from Brasilia. “I live in a city where the military almost helped former President Jair Bolsonaro throw a coup just two years ago. This movie is a win against that too.”\n\nRio Mayor Eduardo Paes announced an expensive way to celebrate. His administration will buy the house where the film was shot in the upscale region of Urca, currently priced at 20 million Brazilian reais ($3.35 million) so it can be transformed into a cinema museum.\n\nGet top local stories in Philly delivered to you every morning. Sign up for NBC Philadelphia's News Headlines newsletter.\n\n“We will make it public and open it for visitation, the place that brought Brazil's first Oscar in almost 100 years of the awards,” Paes said in his social media channels.\n\nRio’s O Globo and O Estado de S. Paulo, two of Brazil's most popular newspapers, had almost identical headlines: “At last, Brazil has an Oscar win.” The South American country has had four other films nominated for Academy Awards: “Keeper of Promises” (1963), “O Quatrilho” (1996), “Four Days in September” (1998) and “Central Station” (1999).\n\nBrazilian TV and social media repeatedly showed footage from the early hours of Monday, local time, with outbursts of joy across the nation and beyond, including at Rio's Sambadrome, a stadium where the glitzy Carnival parades take place every year, over the victory of the Walter Salles-directed film. And in Mexico, a TV broadcast team was seen dancing to celebrate the win.\n\nThe film's star, Fernanda Torres, was nominated for best actress. Her defeat to Anora's Mikey Madison disappointed many Brazilians. “I’m Still Here” was also a nominee for best picture, another first for a Brazilian film. Those losses did not dampen the celebration over the international film Academy Award.\n\n“This was our first, we want to soon have two just like our friends and rivals from Argentina,” said Paulo Almeida, 30-year-old theater actor. “I am so very happy and hopeful that this will boost our movie industry for decades, just like it did for our neighbors.”\n\nArgentina has won the international feature at the Oscars with “The Official Story” (1986) and “The Secret in Their Eyes” (2010).\n\nBrazilian media reported that Torres was invited to the “Champions Parade” of Rio's Carnival, which will take place Saturday with the top six performers at the samba school league. She has yet to confirm but hope among fans is high.\n\n“She is the movie. We need to celebrate her as much as we can,” said Vania Martins, a retired teacher. “Brazilian cinema deserved this win long ago. There's movies that were even better than ‘I’m Still Here' and didn't even get nominated. I hope that this win puts a spotlight on a country that does great, great things for art too.”\n\nThe golden statuette given to Academy Award winners goes primarily by its famous nickname. Here’s what the leading theory says about the name’s origin.",

The S&P 500 fell 2.1% and was set for its worst day of the year. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite slid 3%, weighed down by a separate issue affecting Nvidia, which was already down more than 9%.\n\nSpeaking at the White House alongside Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, the president said the clock had run out on finding concessions for America's two-largest trading partners to avoid sweeping new trade duties.\n\n“No room left for Mexico or for Canada,” Trump said. “Tomorrow, tariffs, 25% on Canada and 25% on Mexico, and that will start.”\n\nGet top local stories in Philly delivered to you every morning. Sign up for NBC Philadelphia's News Headlines newsletter.\n\nHe said he's also imposing an additional 10% tariff on China, on top of the 10% hike he recently instituted, which has already drawn retaliation from Beijing.\n\nTrump also reiterated that previously announced \"reciprocal\" tariffs would be coming on April 2. And in a post on his Truth Social platform earlier in the day, the president said tariffs on \"external product\" from the agriculture industry would also be imposed that day, without offering further details.\n\nTariffs or customs duties are a tax on products purchased from abroad, and they are used by practically all countries\n\nEven before his remarks, new economic data sounded fresh warnings about the solidity of the U.S. economy. A measure of manufacturing activity showed a jump in suppliers' costs, sparked in part by trade concerns.\n\n“The incoming tariffs are causing our products to increase in price. Sweeping price increases are incoming from suppliers,\" one executive at a machinery firm told the Institute of Supply Management for its monthly survey. \"Most are noting increases in labor costs,” a respondent in the machinery sector said.\n\nMonday's stock market selloff erases a strong start to the year for Wall Street, where many had greeted the onset of the new Trump administration with enthusiasm due to expected deregulation and tax cuts. After rising as much as 5% so far this year, the Dow is now only about 1% higher than where it began 2025.\n\nAlready, closely watched signs of consumers' expectations have softened, and retail sales posted a sharp decline last month. Major brands including Walmart are warning that the new administration's trade policies could dent their business in the months ahead, although some — such as Chipotle — so far say they plan to eat the expected costs.\n\nNBC News' Brian Cheung contributed.\n\nThis story first appeared on NBCNews.com.

Sign up for NBC Philadelphia's News Headlines newsletter.\n\nOne person is selected to sit out high-profile events like the State of the Union, inaugurations, and presidential speeches to joint sessions of Congress to preserve the Constitutional line of succession to the presidency in the event of a cataclysmic event.\n\nThis person would assume control if the president, vice president, speaker of the House and all other cabinet officers in the presidential line of succession were incapacitated.\n\nWho picks the designated survivor?\n\nThere is no official protocol outlining how the administration is to select a designated survivor, at least not that has been made public anyway.\n\nCandidates in the presidential line of succession as one of the 15 cabinet secretaries of an executive department must meet two basic eligibility requirements: they must be a native-born American citizen and at least 35 years old.\n\nChris Lu, who served as White House Cabinet Secretary for President Barack Obama and helped select seven designated survivors, discussed other factors that were considered in a 2023 social media thread. They included selecting someone who is already traveling outside of the Washington D.C. area during the speech; someone who is not directly associated to the topics of the issues mentioned in the speech; someone who has not already been asked to serve as designated survivor; someone who has not served in Congress.\n\nWhat is the presidential order of succession?\n\nBelow is the presidential order of succession in the event the president of the United States becomes incapacitated, dies, resigns, is unable to hold office or is removed from office, per the Constitution and the Presidential Succession Act of 1947.\n\nVice President\n\nSpeaker of the House\n\nPresident Pro Tempore of the Senate\n\nSecretary of State\n\nSecretary of the Treasury\n\nSecretary of Defense\n\nAttorney General\n\nSecretary of the Interior\n\nSecretary of Agriculture\n\nSecretary of Commerce\n\nSecretary of Labor\n\nSecretary of Health and Human Services\n\nSecretary of Housing and Urban Development\n\nSecretary of Transportation\n\nSecretary of Energy\n\nSecretary of Education\n\nSecretary of Veterans Affairs\n\nSecretary of Homeland Security\n\nWhen is the designated survivor chosen?\n\nPrevious designated survivors have said they were informed of their role days or weeks before the event was to take place. They are not revealed publicly until during or after the event.\n\nWhere is the designated survivor?\n\nThe designated survivor watches the speech from a secure location, which prior to the Sept. 11 2001 attacks was occasionally of their own choosing.\n\nJohn Block, Ronald Reagan's agricultural secretary, carried out his role as designated survivor in 1986 from a villa in Jamaica.\n\nDan Glickman, Bill Clinton’s agriculture secretary, served as designated survivor in 1997 at his daughter's New York City apartment alongside Secret Service members.\n\nBill Richardson, Clinton's energy secretary, moved up a planned 2000 weekend trip with his wife to Oxford, Maryland so he’d be there as designated survivor during the State of the Union.\n\nAlberto Gonzales, George W. Bush’s attorney general, was designated survivor in 2007 while in flight, departing from Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland.\n\nWho was the first designated survivor?\n\nSelecting a failsafe that has become informally known as a designated survivor dates to the late 1950s during the Cold War amid the threat of the Soviets targeting Washington D.C. with nuclear weapons. A designated survivor was not publicly acknowledged by name until 1981 when education secretary Terrel Bell was not in attendance for President Ronald Reagan's joint address to Congress.\n\nWho was the last designated survivor?\n\nA designated survivor was not selected for Donald Trump's inauguration in January.

        "content": "'The Bachelor' Grant meets his final 4 women's families during hometowns\n\nNEW YORK -- It's Hometowns Week on \"The Bachelor.\" Grant's said this week was \"everything\" to him because he wants his family to be a part of his future wife's family.\n\nJuliana's Hometown Date\n\nHis first stop was Newton, Massachusetts to see Juliana. Grant said that he's falling for her, but hasn't told her yet. Juliana was going to take Grant around the Little Italy of Newton and show him what it's like to be Italian. They stopped in a pizzeria and it went pretty much how you'd expect. \"Who's this guy?\" ha ha. They're protective of their beautiful Juliana. The pizzeria worker sweetly warned Grant that Juliana has a big family and that the whole neighborhood is basically family. It was fun though, Grant and Juliana got to make their own pizzas and learned how to toss the dough. Then they went to a bakery and ate and filled cannoli.\n\nGina: Look, if it's one thing we Italians know, it's food! Seeing them make pizza and have cannoli was super cute and seeing Juliana on her home turf was fun.\n\nGrant told Juliana that he had zero complaints about where she lives and loved hanging out with her there. Juliana then warned Grant that her last relationship was not a good one and that her family will likely come across as very protective of her. Then Juliana rattled off 100 or so people that Grant would be meeting that day. It's like a family reunion! Grant said it was \"dope\" that everyone was showing up for her and he's always wanted to be a part of a big family. Grant said he was ready to be grilled.\n\nGina: Hearing Juliana naming all her relatives reminded me of that scene in \"My Big Fat Greek Wedding\" where Nia Vardalos' dad is introducing John Corbett to the family and naming all the cousins and aunts and uncles. Get ready, Grant!\n\nJuliana and Grant brought pizza, cannoli, and flowers to her huge family! They all cheered when they walked in the door. They went out back to where a whole party was set up. Grant said it was a little overwhelming, but he was enjoying himself. Her father gave a toast and then kissed Juliana. Her dad said, \"Did you just kiss my daughter?!\" He was joking but also serious. They all made it known that the family had Juliana's back.\n\nJuliana's sister Dominique spoke to her first and Juliana revealed that she knows that he's her guy. Her sister was so excited for her. She cried hoping that Grant is being genuine with her. Dominique is just worried that she could get her heart broken. Meantime, Grant told Juliana's family the story of how he's a lone wolf and how they connected over Juliana's wolfpack.\n\nGina: If Juliana is the one for him at the end, I think we'll look back to the conversation about the lone wolf tattoo and the need for your own wolfpack as the moment that sealed the deal.\n\nHer dad said he doesn't want to see his daughter get hurt. Grant tried to reassure him that he has big feelings for Juliana. Grant then revealed that he's falling for Juliana. He said that he's been through a lot of trials in his life but he wants to be a good man and he knows that Juliana would help him on that journey to being who he wants to be. Grant told him that he respects how he's kept his family together and he wants to learn from him as a father-in-law. I teared up! They really made a good connection.\n\nJuliana asked her father what he thought about the situation. She said she isn't ready to get her heart broken, but she thinks Grant is a solid man. Her dad said that Grant wants someone to be a teammate with. He found that his motives were pure and that he \"loves the guy\" and that he seems ready. \"I think you are going to be fine,\" her dad said. Aw! Grant said meeting her family couldn't have gone any better than it did. With that, Grant told Juliana that he's falling for her! I think Juliana's dad and how awesome he is really sealed the deal for him. She reaffirmed to Grant that she's falling in love with him. It was so hard for her to say goodbye to Grant.\n\nGina: Juliana's dad reminds me of my own dad, both old school Italian men who only want the best for their daughters. I do think that Grant's relationship with his own father, which was not always great, played a factor here. He sees the bond Juliana and Carl have and I think wants that as well as part of the wolfpack he's trying to create. I loved when Grant said that he could learn from Carl. I got teary too, Jen!!\n\nZoe's Hometown Date\n\nGrant traveled to New York City to meet up with Zoe for their hometown date. Grant wondered if they could catch up to where he is with the other women and admitted there's a lot riding on this date. She didn't grow up there, but it's home to her! She moved there for a tech career and she also gets to do modeling. They visited a photographer that was going to take pictures of them for Brides magazine! Grant thought it was very fun, and liked to see Zoe in her element.\n\nGrant seemed to get a little nervous as they staged a proposal. He did think that Zoe was glowing though. He loved how they had great vibes and energy together. Grant seeing Zoe in a wedding gown was very sweet. \"You are so beautiful,\" Grant told Zoe. He had the best time with her though. He told Zoe he can tell that she's so ready for love and to be loved. Grant wanted Zoe to know that he gets her. She complimented him on seeing the good in people and even being so open to giving his dad a second chance. Zoe told Grant that he'd be meeting her \"chosen\" family which included her sister, aunt and uncle, and friends.\n\nGina: I think Zoe used this time in a very interesting way. She is stunning and very good at modeling, and I think being in her element like that gave her the confidence boost she needed. And it helped Grant see her differently. Well, all of us saw her a little differently, I think.\n\nEveryone was very welcoming to them and her aunt started to cry upon seeing Zoe. Her uncle was happy to see how happy she was with Grant. Zoe told her aunt and uncle that she felt comfortable with Grant right away. She felt like Grant does compliment her and he's not intimidated by her. They just said they don't want to see her heart shattered. \"My goodness, enough with that,\" her aunt said.\n\nFaith, Zoe's sister, said that she just wants her to be in love and be happy. They cried and hugged. Faith likes the way that Grant looks at her sister and said that he lets her shine. She was concerned that Zoe didn't get a one-on-one date yet and Zoe said, \"You can ask him about that.\" Grant said that he felt like Zoe was holding back and sometimes it was him, but he didn't give her one because of that. But now, they are locked in it's just that their connection started later and but it's right on time. Zoe has a strained relationship with her parents and her sister asked Grant if that scared him. He said it doesn't because he's been through it all. He said that he doesn't love Zoe yet but seeing her with her family is nudging it higher and higher to love. Hmm.\n\nGrant said that he thought they broke though a lot of barriers on their date today. \"This woman is special and somebody I see a future with,\" he said. They did not share any declarations of love though as Grant left.\n\nGina: Smart move to get her sister to ask about the one-on-one situation. And also, it's quite telling that he made it a point to say that he is not in love with Zoe yet, especially given Grant's proclamations of feelings for some of the other women.\n\nLitia's Hometown Date\n\nGrant traveled to Star Valley, Wyoming for his hometown date with Litia. They met up in the woods and walked on a trail together. Grant said he grew up in a city but he likes being out in nature with Litia. She took him to a pair of waiting horses and Grant was pumped to jump aboard. \"I feel like you come awake in the country,\" Grant said. He added that his mom would love her because she's also a country girl. We also found out that her nickname is T and TT from her family. They even held hands as they rode together. \"I'm a country boy today!\" Grant proclaimed. Litia said that he's the first non-Mormon she's ever brought home. He admitted that he knows very little about being a Mormon. He thinks his parents fought because his mom was religious and his dad was not, so he wants to make sure that he can fit in. \"I'm here with an open heart and an open mind,\" Grant said.\n\nGina: First, oh my gosh is it beautiful in Wyoming! No wonder Litia seems so content and happy there (aside from being with her family). I also loved hearing about her nicknames and noting that Grant called her those nicknames throughout the entire day!\n\nTime to meet the family! He likes to drink sometimes, have fun, get tattoos, and that doesn't usually fit in so well. But everyone welcomed them with open arms upon arrival. Grant met her parents and two of her brothers. They have such a beautiful home! Then in the back, Grant met her extended family. The family is huge! The family did a rope pull challenge, shared bracelets, and had some food. It was a nice party and Grant said that he was having a great time.\n\nGina: That's two dates meeting two big families. Lots of pressure on our guy! But he has definitely handled it well.\n\nRob, her dad, said that watching Grant meet the family reminded him of when he met his wife's family. It was mostly Rob's side that was there. Her father was glad that he is a man of faith and it doesn't matter that it's not the same religion. \"No amount of success can compensate for failure in the home,\" Rob said. Grant agreed. He also said that Litia is 31 and wants to get married and have kids so time is of the essence.\n\nHer mom Maurie asked Grant if he felt ready to be engaged. He revealed that he already told Litia that he's falling in love with her daughter. Maurie said that as long as he has the core belief that God is important, they want him to feel comfortable and they support him. They would have the full support of the family. He doesn't have to become Mormon. \"She's ready to start a family, as soon as you are,\" she said. Wow, that might be a bit overwhelming. Everyone is saying this to him.\n\nGina: On the one hand, the pressure and worry about religion being a factor now seems to be gone. On the other hand, the pressure of starting a family right away seems to be on!\n\nLitia spoke with her grandfather about how accepting he was of her birth father with her mother, being that they had different backgrounds. He said they were meant to be and he was such a easy guy to love. He thinks that Grant could be the same for Litia. Then he said he wished her grandmother was there to see all this and that he missed her. Cue the tears! He said you just need to have a deep feeling of love for each other where you can work out anything. Litia told her grandfather that she thinks she loves him. Her grandfather said that they just seem to fit so he hopes it works out. What a sweetheart he is! He's on oxygen, so prayers that his health is OK.\n\nGina: Moment #2 in this episode that I got teary. What a sweet moment between Litia and her grandfather.\n\nLitia shared her feelings of fear about the Fantasy Suites. She doesn't want to sleep with Grant and she also doesn't want him to sleep with other women. \"Are you open to just keeping an open mind about it?\" Her mom said. Those are some open Mormons! Her mom doesn't seem to think that she should dictate what he does with the others and just focus on herself. Makes sense! Litia said she definitely loves Grant but she doesn't want to get hurt. Now that her family is behind them, she feels ready to tell him. As she said goodbye to Grant, Litia said, \"I could see it.\" Then Litia said, \"I'm falling in love with you,\" and Grant said he was doing the same!\n\nDina's Hometown Date\n\nGrant then headed to Chicago for his hometown date with Dina. She has 11 siblings! Dina said that he would be meeting her friends and not her family. Her dad is a pastor and an ordained deacon and was not ok with her being on a dating show. Grant was a bit upset that he couldn't meet them, but he wanted to meet her friends and try to learn more about Dina. Still, he found it concerning.\n\nGina: That's a plot twist for sure. I feel so badly for Dina because she has gotten this far and to have her family decline being there now when the point is to meet the family is tough. On the other hand, I see Grant's point too. Is it something to be concerned about?\n\nDina took Grant to a pumpkin patch where there was a fall festival set up. They played some carnival games, got lost in a corn maze together, and then her crew showed up. Dina cried as she saw her best friends and Grant then realized he really needed and wanted their approval because these people are very important to her.\n\nHer friends asked him what qualities he was looking for in a wife. Grant said that he wants to provide and be a giver and the fact that Dina is like that too is new to him. He loves that about her. Her friends tried to drive the point home that she's got a huge heart. Grant said that it's tough that her family isn't buying into this journey because there's a proposal at the end. Dina shared those same concerns with her friends. Grant doesn't want to commit to someone that he doesn't know enough about and wants to see if he can fit in with his future wife's family. They did not say that they were falling for each other or anything like that yet.\n\nGina: Here's the thing. As women, our besties are the people we go to and spill the tea on all our relationship secrets. So when it comes to a budding relationship and seeing if it could go somewhere, they are the ones who could probably see things a little more clearly. Still, I know that the family not being there weighed heavily on Dina throughout this entire date. You could feel the weight of it.\n\nGrant Meets Up with Joey\n\nBack in Los Angeles, Grant met up with Joey for a beer! Love seeing our happily engaged former \"Bachelor.\" Joey said this is the week where everything hits and you have to take a beat and figure stuff out. Joey said he still has to see how things click in Fantasy Suites and then the women meeting his family will be huge too. He asked for Joey's advice on how to send women home at this stage in the relationships. Grant said despite not meeting Dina's family they handled it well together. Joey said it's good because they see how they would handle an issue in the real world when things like that pop up on the show. Joey urged Grant to follow his gut. Grant said his biggest fear is making the wrong decision.\n\nGina: There's our guy reminding Bachelor Nation why he's so beloved. He had some great insight and advice. He called Grant on wanting stats and knowing the \"why\" of things, but he's right. Sometimes your gut tells you exactly what you need to hear. I hope Grant takes that into consideration.\n\nThe Women Talk\n\nZoe talked about her date being a photoshoot and getting the chance for Grant to see her in a comfortable situation with her family. Litia talked about how they had a ton of people in her family to meet Grant. Dina then realized she was the only one that didn't have her family meet him. Juliana also talked about how Grant fit in with her huge family. Dina was then super nervous.\n\nRose Ceremony\n\n1) Litia\n\n2) Juliana\n\n3) Zoe\n\nThat meant Dina was eliminated. Grant grabbed Dina's hand and walked her out. Dina wiped tears as they walked up to a bench. Grant said it wasn't easy and he hoped he made the right decision. He said that she taught him what to look for in a woman. He said that he appreciated all the moments that they had together. \"I will treasure the time that we spent together,\" she said. Dina urged him to follow his heart. Dina didn't cry in the limo, she's so logical.\n\nGina: I think as an attorney, you have to be able to compartmentalize your feelings and not show your cards on how you're feeling about any situation so you don't tip your hand and we saw that in her exit. That being said, Dina is a class act. Period, end of story. She handled all of that so well and I truly hope she finds love. Maybe in Paradise?\n\nComing Up\n\nNext week, it's time for \"The Women Tell All!\" Gina will have a recap of all the drama and all the highlights. Then, in two weeks, we finally get to see the fantasy suites! Beyond that we head into the finale and Grant has a very difficult decision to make.\n\nGina: I can't wait to tell you all about it!\n\nFollow us now and never miss an episode!\n\nClick here to subscribe on Apple Podcasts\n\nClick here to subscribe on Spotify\n\nClick here to subscribe on iHeart",

(WPVI) -- Health officials in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania have confirmed a case of measles in a child, and say it's possible members of the public were exposed.\n\nThe Office of Public Health said Sunday that the case involved an unvaccinated child who lives in the county. The child's hometown was not released.\n\nOfficials said contact tracing is now underway and people who may have been exposed are being contacted.\n\nMembers of the public may have been exposed at the following times and locations:\n\nFebruary 25-26, 2025\n\n-China Airlines Airport Shuttle Bus\n\n-Departing JFK Airport Terminal 4, arriving at Summerdale, Pho Ha Saigon, 757 Adams Avenue, Philadelphia, PA 19120\n\n-From February 25 at 9:30 p.m. to February 26 at 3:15 a.m.\n\nFebruary 26, 2025\n\n-True North Pediatrics Associates of Plymouth\n\n-3031 Walton Rd., #C101, Plymouth Meeting, PA 19462\n\n-11:45. a.m. - 2:15 p.m.\n\nFebruary 26, 2025\n\n-CHOP King of Prussia Campus Emergency Department\n\n-550 S. Goddard Boulevard, King of Prussia, PA 19406\n\n-12:52 p.m. - 3:02 p.m.\n\nDr. Brett Gilbert, the Chief of Infectious Diseases with Main Line Health, said the virus can be transmitted as many as four days before a patient will see or feel any symptoms, including cough, congestion, and a rash.\n\n\"On this Earth, it's the most contagious, infectious disease,\" Dr. Gilbert said. \"So if you are sitting in a room with ten people and one person has it, within an hour, 90 percent of people could have measles.\"\n\nPublic health officials say dealing with this rise in measles cases could be a lengthy ordeal, prompting recently-confirmed Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to now urge parents to vaccinate their children.\n\nHealth officials say the majority of people living in Montgomery County have gotten their MMR shots and more than 95 percent of kindergartners in the county have been vaccinated.\n\nBut this rise in measles cases across the country has them very concerned.\n\n\"Measles has been eradicated since 2000. There are cases that pop up here or there but unfortunately, with the recent decline in vaccination rates, we are seeing more and more cases come up across the country, sometimes with fatal results,\" said Dr. Alvin Wang of Jefferson Health.\n\nHealth officials ask that if you suspect that you or your child have measles and wish to seek care, call your health care provider, urgent care, or hospital emergency room before leaving home.\n\nYou can also contact the Office of Public Health at 610.278.5117 to facilitate a safe visit and reduce exposure for staff and other patients.\n\nHealth care providers should report suspected cases of measles immediately to OPH at 610.278.5117 or after hours at 610.635.4300.\n\nMeasles virus can remain in the air and on surfaces for up to two hours after an infected person leaves the area. If someone breathes in the contaminated air or touches an infected surface and then touches their eyes, nose or mouth, they can become infected.\n\nHealth officials continue to encourage everyone to get the measles vaccine if they haven't done so already.\n\nThis news comes after three cases of measles were reported in New Jersey and Texas is dealing with an outbreak with dozens of cases reported.\n\nRELATED: 5 key questions about measles answered amid outbreak\n\nMontco officials released the following details about measles and the vaccine:\n\nThe measles vaccine is safe and highly effective at preventing measles.\n\n-For individuals who are properly immunized against measles, the risk of getting the disease is minimal. Individuals who believe they were exposed should:\n\n-Review their immunization and medical records to determine if they are protected against measles.\n\n-Consult with their health care provider about receiving measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) immunization if they have not had measles infection or received the measles immunization previously. Contact and notify their health care provider as soon as possible about a potential exposure if they are pregnant, have an infant (child under the age of 1 year old), have a weakened immune system, and/or are not vaccinated.\n\n-Monitor themselves for illness with fever and/or an unexplained rash, cough, congestion or runny nose, or red watery eyes (conjunctivitis) from 7 days to 21 days after their exposure (the time period when symptoms may develop). If symptoms develop, stay at home and call a health care provider immediately.\n\nIndividuals are considered to be immune to measles if any of the following applies:\n\n-They were born in 1957 or earlier.\n\n-They have had 2 doses of Measles, Mumps, Rubella (MMR) vaccine.\n\n-They have had measles disease.\n\nThe following groups of people are potentially susceptible to measles:\n\n-Infants who are too young to have been immunized (less than one year of age).\n\n-Children who are only partially vaccinated (less than 6 years old).\n\n-Persons who were vaccinated with an inactivated or unknown type of vaccine, which was used from 1963 through 1967, and have not been revaccinated.\n\n-Some persons born after 1957 who have only received one dose of vaccine.\n\n-Those who have refused vaccination\n\n-Those from areas of the world where there is low vaccine coverage or currently circulating measles.\n\n-Immune-compromised persons, such as organ transplant recipients, patients receiving chemotherapy and people living with HIV/AIDS.\n\n-Individuals who meet the above criteria or cannot verify their immune status should consult with their primary healthcare provider about the best way to protect themselves from measles.\n\nAbout Measles\n\nMeasles is an extremely contagious virus that lives in the mucus membranes of the nose and throat of infected people. Measles can be transmitted from person to person through coughing and sneezing. If a healthy person breathes the contaminated air or touches an infected surface, then touches their eyes, nose or mouth they can become infected. When an infected person sneezes or coughs, droplets spray into the air and those droplets can contain active and contagious virus which will last in the air and on surfaces for up to two hours.\n\nMeasles typically begins with a fever (100.4F or higher) that lasts for several days, followed by a cough, runny nose, and watery eyes (conjunctivitis). Two to three days after symptoms begin, tiny white spots (Koplik spots) may appear in the mouth. Three to five days after symptoms begin, a flat red spotted rash appears beginning on face at the hairline and spreads downwards to the neck, trunk, arms, legs and feet. The flat red spots may also be joined by small, raised bumps. Symptoms appear about 7-14 days on average after exposure but can be as long as 21 days.\n\nMeasles is preventable with two doses of MMR vaccine which is available at your local healthcare provider or pharmacy. OPH can assist by providing recommendations for testing, outbreak prevention, and disease management.\n\nFor questions, call OPH at 610.278.5117. For more information about measles, visit here.

        "content": "What to know as Trump's long-promised tariffs go into effect on Mexico, Canada, China\n\nWASHINGTON -- Tariffs long-promised by President Donald Trump's administration went into effect at 12:01 a.m. Tuesday.\n\nThe move impacts products from Mexico, Canada and China -- the three largest trading partners of the United States -- meaning that it could impact prices for everything from gasoline to avocados to iPhones.\n\nAt the beginning of his second term, Trump set March 4 as the start date for 25% tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada, as well as 10% tariff on Chinese goods -- which, as of Tuesday, rises to 20%, per an amended executive order on Monday afternoon.\n\nSpeaking at the White House on Monday, Trump confirmed that the tariffs would take effect the following day.\n\nThe announcement sent major stock indexes plummeting. The S &P suffered its biggest loss since December, closing at 5,849.72 -- down 104.78 points or 1.76%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed at 43,191.24 down 649.67 points or 1.48%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq fell 2.64%.\n\nThe deadline arrives roughly one month after Trump granted Mexico and Canada a reprieve from such tariffs, having reached agreements with the two countries regarding border security and drug trafficking.\n\nHere's what to know about the tariffs that have gone into effect.\n\nTariffs could upend U.S. trade\n\nIn recent days, Trump reaffirmed his commitment to placing tariffs on Canada and Mexico.\n\nOn Feb. 27, Trump alleged that drugs had continued to enter the U.S. through Mexico and Canada despite agreements reached last month to address the issue.\n\n\"We cannot allow this scourge to continue to harm the USA, and therefore, until it stops, or is seriously limited, the proposed TARIFFS scheduled to go into effect on MARCH FOURTH will, indeed, go into effect, as scheduled,\" Trump said in a post on Truth Social.\n\nTrump voiced similar concerns about Mexico and Canada ahead of the previous tariff deadline -- before ultimately pausing the measures.\n\nCommerce Secretary Howard Lutnick on Monday praised Mexico and Canada for their recent efforts to address border security, suggesting that the level of the tariffs remained uncertain.\n\n\" [ Trump ] is going to decide today - we're going to put it out tomorrow,\" Lutnick told CNN, describing the policymaking as a \"fluid situation.\"\n\nTrump then confirmed that the the fresh round of tariffs would take effect the following day.\n\n\"That will start,\" Trump said. \"They'll have to have tariffs.\"\n\nIf the tariffs stay in place, price increases will be evident by Memorial Day, according to economist Mark Zandi, who also said that prices on food could start rising more quickly -- within weeks.\n\nNew tariffs could raise prices for some essentials\n\nTariffs on Mexico, Canada and China could raise prices for a vast array of goods, experts previously told ABC News.\n\nTariffs of this magnitude would likely increase prices paid by U.S. shoppers, since importers typically pass along a share of the cost of those higher taxes to consumers, experts said. The policy could hike prices for products ranging from tomatoes to tequila to auto parts.\n\nThe Yale Budget Lab estimated in February that the tariffs could cost the average household up to $2,000 annually.\n\nHigher costs for car production could pose a challenge for U.S. automakers, many of which depend on a supply chain closely intertwined with Mexico and Canada.\n\n\"The automobile sector, in particular, is likely to see considerable negative consequences, not only because of the disruption of the supply chains that crisscross the three countries in the manufacturing process, but also because of the expected increase in the price of vehicles, which can dampen demand,\" Gustavo Flores-Macias, a professor of government and public policy at Cornell University, told ABC News in a statement.\n\nIn a statement on Monday from the American Automotive Policy Council, which represents members like Ford and General Motors, AAPC President Matt Blunt said, \"Our American automakers, who invested billions in the U.S. to meet these requirements, should not have their competitiveness undermined by tariffs that will raise the cost of building vehicles in the United States and stymie investment in the American workforce, while our competitors from outside of North America benefit from easy access to our home market.\" He called for an exemption from the tariffs for American automakers.\n\nMexico and Canada account for 70% of U.S. crude oil imports, which make up a key input for the nation's gasoline supply, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, a government agency.\n\nTrump previously said Canadian energy resources such as oil and gas would be subject to 10% tariffs, excluding the products from 25% tariffs faced by all other imports from the country.\n\nThe U.S. imported $38.5 billion in agricultural goods from Mexico in 2023, making it the top recipient of such products, U.S Department of Agriculture data showed. Those imports include more than $3 billion worth of fresh fruits and vegetables.\n\nRoughly 90% of avocados eaten in the U.S. last year originated in Mexico, USDA data showed. Other products with a high concentration of Mexican imports include tomatoes, cucumbers, bell peppers, jalapenos, limes and mangos.\n\nTargeted countries may retaliate\n\nThe fresh tariffs may trigger retaliation from Mexico, Canada and China.\n\nIn anticipation of tariffs last month, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau threatened retaliatory tariffs on $155 billion worth of goods and urged Canadians to choose Canada-made products over their American counterparts. On Monday night, he reaffirmed that commitment, saying that Canada would start with \"tariffs on $30 billion worth of goods immediately and tariffs on the remaining $125 billion on American products in 21 days' time.\"\n\n\"Our tariffs will remain in place until the U.S. trade action is withdrawn, and should U.S. tariffs not cease, we are in active and ongoing discussions with provinces and territories to pursue several non-tariff measures,\" Trudeau said in a statement.\n\nOntario Premier Doug Ford said Monday that imposing the tariffs would be an \"absolute disaster\" for both the U.S. and Canada. He added, in part, \"I don't want to respond but we will respond like they've never seen before.\"\n\nFord warned if tariffs from the U.S. move forward, Canada will respond.\n\n\"We keep the lights on in 1.5 million homes and manufacturing in New York, in Michigan and Minnesota. If he wants to destroy our economy and our families, I will shut down the electricity going down to the U.S. and I'm telling you we will do it,\" Ford said.\n\nMexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said she had instructed officials in her government to implement Plan B, \"which includes tariff and non-tariff measures in defense of Mexico's interests.\"\n\nSpeaking to reporters on Monday, Sheinbaum said recent talks between the U.S. had gone \"very well\" but that Mexico retains options if necessary.\n\n\"We are going to wait and see what happens,\" Sheinbaum said. \"In that, you need to have mettle, serenity and patience, and we have Plan A, Plan B, Plan C, Plan D, so we are going to wait for today.\"\n\nAfter Trump amended his executive order on Monday afternoon -- just hours before tariffs were meant to take effect -- effectively increasing China's tariffs by 10% for a total of 20%, a Chinese Ministry of Commerce spokesperson responded with a statement calling the move a \"typical unilateral and bullying behavior\" that will cause \"damage to China-US economic and trade cooperation and the normal international trade order.\"\n\n\"China hopes that the US will view and handle issues objectively and rationally and return to the right track of properly resolving differences through equal dialogue as soon as possible,\" the statement added.\n\nABC News' Anne Flaherty, Zunaira Zaki and Elizabeth Schulze contributed to this report.",

She hasnt, and wont. Instead she has stated repeatedly she stands by her claims. These same group of investigators have been caught on tape offering to pay people to sue me and my firm. After speaking with Jane Doe today, it appears that the quotes attributed to her in the lawsuit are completely made up, or they spoke to someone who isnt Jane Doe.\"\n\nHe added, \"This is just another attempt to intimidate and bully this poor woman that we will deal with in due course. We wont be bullied or intimidated by frivolous cases.\"\n\nABC News' Jennifer Leong contributed to this report.",

        "content": "Sign up for our email newsletter to stay up-to-date on the latest local sports news throughout Philadelphia.\n\nPHILADELPHIA — The Sixers played host to the Portland Trail Blazers Monday night. In a game in which the Sixers entered with just 10 players, they lost one more during the third quarter as star Tyrese Maxey took a hard fall on his back and eventually made his way to the locker room.\n\nAs the Sixers were down 74-68 to the Blazers midway through the third quarter, Maxey drove into the lane against Toumari Camara and Donovan Clingan, looking to help his team retake the lead. This game had been a massive struggle for Maxey, who was 2-12 on the night with just five points before his final missed shot of the night.\n\nIt has been reported for some time that Maxey is dealing with an injury to a finger on his right hand. Sixers’ head coach Nick Nurse has been asked about the injury on several occasions, including pregame, when he was asked whether or not the star guard was progressing at all in the healing process. Nurse’s response was not an encouraging one.\n\n“Not much better,” Nurse said. “I did ask him. He came out for walkthrough with no tape on it. I said, ‘Where’s the tape?’ And he said, ‘Forget that tape, man.’ I said, ‘Feeling better?’ He said, ‘No.’ There you go. There’s your answer.”\n\nThis once again begs the question, why was Maxey on the floor to begin with? Over his past four games, Maxey has shot 14/69, that’s 20.2% from the field. From three, he’s made just two of his last 21 shots. Very clearly, Maxey is not healthy enough to play, and even if one is to take the team at face value when they say they are continuing to push to compete, all Maxey has done is hurt the team’s chances and now himself because of the irresponsibility of the organization.\n\nTyrese Maxey was officially ruled OUT for the rest of the game with a back contusion between the third and fourth quarters.\n\nThis story is continuing to develop, and more information will be made available as soon as it is known.\n\nFor the latest breaking news on your Philadelphia 76ers and other Philly sports, follow Zach Ciavolella on X — @CiavoNBA and Bluesky — @ciavo.bsky.social",

We attract seasoned art buyers to young professionals, and our guests are typically laser-focused on acquiring art from our community of incredibly talented artists,” explains Rachel Zimmerman, Executive Director and Founder of InLiquid in a statement.\n\nAs a release notes, the new name is meant to be reflective of both the month it takes place, and the community resilience InLiquid is committed to upholding. While the name has evolved, the basic format of the auction will remain the same: For 15 days, between March 9 and 22, more than 300 works of fine art will be curated in one room on top of a variety of events meant to connect the city’s artists and art professionals with the public.\n\n“March for Art” is also turning a second room at InLiquid into an “immersive environment” while using projection mapping technology courtesy of Jefferson University’s industrial design department.\n\nThe best part of this activation? Unlike many charity auctions, InLiquid splits the proceeds from each sale with the artists so that proceeds directly benefit the community and the organizations nonprofit mission.\n\nThis benefit also helps highlight the creative community through its event series, which will be peppered throughout the month. The first, titled “March for Art: UNITE” will kick off on Thursday, March 13, from 4 to 6 p.m. On that date, art professionals, administrators, educators and supporters will march down North American Street.\n\nThis non-political assembly holds the goal of “seeking to generate harmony and promoting the dynamic cultural history of the city as we march together into the future.” After the procession, the public is invited to a special Second Thursday event in Olde Kensington with open galleries at the Crane Arts Building, the Clay Studio and NextFab.\n\n“March for Art: DESIGN” is next up, and this exclusive trunk show will feature locally crafted designer fashions, including from Roberta Gruber, John Wind Jewelry, Manzanita, Nino Brand and many more. The event, set for Saturday, March 15, from noon to 5 p.m., is free and open to the public.\n\nInLiquid is also set to host “March for Art: EAT” ($100) on Thursday, March 20, from 6 to 9 p.m. While there, guests can enjoy an “exclusive gastronomic experience” with Chef Ange Branca of Kampar, plus, sip on some zero-proof cocktails from Bar Palmina and Wallace Dry Goods.\n\nAnd lastly, to round up the experience, “March for Art: BASH” ($100) will be the grand finale. Taking place on Saturday, March 22, from 6 to 10 p.m., locals can head to InLiquid to meet the artists, enjoy the artwork, and support the local arts community before the auction closes up shop. Tickets for all events can be found online.\n\nFor more information on “March for Art” and InLiquid Gallery (1400 N American St Gallery 108), visit inliquid.org",

        "source": "https://metrophiladelphia.com/",
        "content": "Sign up for our Gay City News email newsletter to get news, updates, and local insights delivered straight to your inbox!\n\nHate crimes targeting LGBTQ individuals have made up a significant share of hate-motivated attacks in Manhattan in recent years, drawing the attention of Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg and his office.\n\nAssistant District Attorney Hannah Yu, who heads the office’s Hate Crimes Unit, told Gay City News in a recent interview that anti-LGBTQ crimes have increased in the borough over the last five years — and in 2023, anti-LGBTQ hate crimes were the top category of hate-driven attacks in Manhattan.\n\nIn 2022, anti-Asian hate crimes led the way, with 34, followed by 27 anti-LGBTQ hate crimes; in 2023, there were 39 anti-LGBTQ hate crimes, easily taking the top spot; and in 2024, there were 29 anti-LGBTQ hate crimes, ranking in second place overall behind only anti-Semitic hate crimes. One anti-LGBTQ hate crime has been reported in Manhattan thus far in 2025, according to the DA’s Office.\n\n“The overarching trend we’re seeing is a troublingly high number of anti-LGBTQ hate crime crises,” Yu said in an interview with Gay City News. “Because of the nature of the hate crimes against these individuals, they are typically violent and typically unprovoked attacks against strangers.”\n\nQuite a few cases have involved incidents on the subway — including when a gay couple got slashed in a sudden anti-LGBTQ attack while riding the subway.\n\n“The gay man was with his partner and the defendant recognized them to be a gay couple, went up to them for no apparent reason other than the fact that they were gay, slashed the man, and made homophobic remarks,” Yu said.\n\nDespite rhetoric about out-of-control crime on the trains, most New Yorkers are not experiencing subway crime and the NYPD touted a 5.4% decrease in subway crime from 2023 to 2024, with robberies dipping 16%. Still, in May of last year, a suspect allegedly grabbed a 35-year-old victim by the neck on an A Train at the 12th Street Station before punching him in the chest and yelling anti-LGBTQ slurs. In another example, also on the A Train last year, a 29-year-old man was riding a northbound train near 59th Street-Columbus Circle when a stranger allegedly punched him in an attack that left him hospitalized.\n\nA report published by State Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli last year found that hate crimes in New York State have increased by 69% over a five-year period. Among anti-LGBTQ hate crimes in the state over the last five years, 71% targeted gay men.\n\nLast year, New York enacted the Hate Crimes Modernization Act, a state-based law that broadened the scope of hate crimes law to allow prosecutors to punish violators with nearly two dozen additional offenses. That was viewed as an attempt to close at least some of the loopholes stemming from the Hate Crimes Act of 2000.\n\n“It does close some loopholes,” Yu said. “Does it close all the loopholes? No.” An example Yu cited was endangering welfare of a child, which Yu said is often associated with hate crimes but was not included in that legislation.\n\nTo address the troubling trend of hate crimes, Yu said the Manhattan DA’s Office is employing a multi-faceted approach that includes deploying a large unit of analysts and prosecutors who are trained on such hate crimes, engaging in community outreach to local community organizations to encourage people to come forward and report the crimes, and incorporating an educational component at CUNY schools and other colleges to educate students on what is a hate crime, how to report it, and what to expect when such crimes are reported.\n\n“The education piece is important to us,” Yu said. “We do spend a lot of time in the community going to precinct council meetings, houses of worship, and community centers.”\n\nKatie Doran, the DA’s advisor for LGBTQ issues, is in touch with organizations such as the New York City Anti-Violence Project and Hetrick-Martin Institute.\n\n“It’s important people know we’re available and can be helpful when people become victims — not just of hate crimes, but intimate partner violence in the LGBTQ community,” Doran told Gay City News.\n\nMany of the attacks leave victims with trauma, and the Manhattan DA’s Office has a Survivors Services Bureau, which is used to train counselors, victim services advocates, and social workers who can meet the needs of victims and help them with things outside of the legal realm, such as with paying medical bills, recovering a lost phone, and other issues, in a culturally responsive manner.\n\n“With anti-LGBTQ hate crimes, what I’ve seen is that these are crimes that go beyond the physical harm,” Yu said. “There is a deep emotional harm and it’s a very hurtful experience for any victim of a hate crime, but for victims of anti-LGBTQ hate crimes, they’re often with their partners in public spaces just being themselves. To be victimized in that way is, I think, especially traumatic, so the Survivor Services Bureau’s counselors and advocates do tremendous work to make our victims feel safe and whole.”\n\nThe DA’s Office is continuing to seek out opportunities for community engagement and education moving forward in an effort to support victims and chip away at the trend of anti-LGBTQ hate crimes.\n\n“We never say no if an organization requests a hate crimes training,” Yu said.",

Here are my 3 Stars of the Match against FC Cincinnati.\n\nImage Credit: Philadelphia Union\n\n3rd Star – Daniel Gazdag\n\nWe know he can score goals, but can Daniel Gazdag find ways to impact the game when he isn’t? Against FC Cincinnati Gazdag did just that, registering 2 unselfish assists, both to Tai Baribo, and bringing himself within 1 of his total for the entire 2024 MLS season (3) just 2 games in.\n\nDaniel Gazdag looks like he’s ready to play provider and help spread the scoring a bit more in 2025 under Bradley Carnell’s system, and hopefully the big performance at home will boost him and the rest of the team moving forward\n\n“It was really important for us to show up for our fans, [to show] what we’re about to do this season, and the first home game was a perfect occasion to do that. We’ve been really motivated before the game and it worked out well today, we scored a lot of goals and we played with intensity. I think that’s all what our fans needed today” – Daniel Gazdag on Philadelphia Union winning their Home Opener\n\nImage Credit: Philadelphia Union\n\n2nd Star – Quinn Sullivan\n\nQuinn Sullivan is off to a strong start to the 2025 season, registering another assist in Saturday’s win over FC Cincinnati with a perfect cross into the penalty area for Bruno Damiani to put away his debut goal in stoppage time. Sullivan also played a big part in Union’s opening goal, sending the ball out wide to Kai Wagner, who then put the ball into the box for Tai Baribo to slam home.\n\nIn addition to his assist and game-high 6 completed dribbles, Quinn Sullivan also logged the most Duels Won of any player on Saturday night (12), making it difficult for Cincinnati’s midfield to find rhythm in the game. Two games into the season, Quinn Sullivan is tied for the most assists in MLS play with 3 and currently ranks amongst the best midfielders in the league in attacking stats.\n\nSullivan’s work rate and creativity were on display last season, but the quality of the final ball often was lacking and failed to translate to goals. In the early stages of life under Bradley Carnell, it looks like Quinn Sullivan has the freedom and confidence he needs to make an impact for this Union team on both sides of the ball.\n\nSullivan was named on the bench of MLS’ Matchday 2 Player of the Matchday roster.\n\n1st Star – Tai Baribo\n\nHe’s off to a blazing hot start. The guy continues to score goals and in bunches for the Philadelphia Union. After netting the first hat-trick of the 2025 MLS Season, Tai Baribo has moved his goal-total to 21 goals scored in his previous 24 games for the Philadelphia Union across all competitions, and was voted as Major League Soccer’s Player of the Matchday for Matchday 2.\n\nBaribo seems to enjoy playing against FC Cincinnati more than anyone else. With the first two goals of his career coming against FCC last June, Baribo has continued to torment their backline almost every time they’ve met, netting seven goals in four games against The Orange and Blue.\n\nBaribo’s 5 goals have him as the current leader in Major League Soccer’s Golden Boot race and have the Union top of the East 2 weeks in, which might come as a surprise if you read what MLS pundits said about the Union in their pre-season predictions. But not Tai Baribo. He’s kept all of that out of his mind and remains focused on the things most important to him\n\n”I just dont read the media, I put myself outside from everything. The coach told us that people disrespect but if you don’t say it I don’t know. I don’t really care what people say, I believe in myself, I believe in the team, I believe in God, this is the most important thing, and just continue like this” – Tai Baribo on the media’s perception of Union\n\nImage Credit: Philadelphia Union\n\nBe sure to return to Philly Sports Network for more Philadelphia Union and other soccer content!\n\nFollow our Union team on Twitter:\n\nTim Lovenguth | Jimmy King | Paul Frenzel\n\nNate Tennesen | Eric Frysinger\n\nSteve Beavon | Liam Jenkins\n\nDoop on Union fans!\n\nFeatured Image Credit: Philadelphia Union",

        "content": "Sign up for our Daily Email newsletter to stay up-to-date on the latest local news throughout Philadelphia.\n\n“Welcome to ‘Behind the Eyes of Our Youth’, where we talk about anything and everything” are the opening words to a raw and honest podcast series hosted by juniors and seniors at Martin Luther King High School in East Germantown.\n\n‘Behind the Eyes of Our Youth‘ is a podcast series hosted and produced by the students enrolled in Dr. Stephen Flemming’s Communication 101 Program. This class fulfills a humanities requirement that students need to graduate, and through a partnership with Harrisburg University, students who pass the class will earn three college credits.\n\nFlemming is a pure Philadelphian, born and raised in West and Southwest Philly, educated in Philadelphia public schools, then attending Temple, Cabrini, and Drexel for his doctorate. He’s been a teacher for 18 years, and a podcast producer for almost four and a half years.\n\nThe podcast was born out of necessity during the online and hybrid teaching days of the 2020-2021 school year — “the idea came from the fact that we needed to use some minutes in class,” Fleming explained. He admits he had no prior experience or plan. Flemming “quite literally launched into it. I hit record on Zoom and told them we were just learning as we go.”\n\nHowever, it did fit perfectly into the curriculum: “I didn’t just see the communication course as just public speaking, so I expanded it to include things like podcasting, and some journalism principles.”\n\nThe inaugural students in 2020 named the show, and to this day ‘Behind the Eyes of Our Youth‘ is student-run. The students select episode topics, which provide real insight into what the students care about.\n\n“The students each week suggest topics and vote on them and discuss them,” Flemming explained.\n\nOn the show, students are often anonymously sharing their unfiltered thoughts and opinions about topics that “grown ups” would never speak into a microphone about. Recent episode titles include ‘Thoughts on Our Current President,’ ‘Can potential fathers have a say in abortion decisions,’ and ‘About the Staff at Martin Luther King High School.’\n\nIn May of 2024, student-podcast hosts released an episode with Philadelphia District Attorney Larry Krasner. In this episode, Krasner explains to the students the problems with the parole and for-profit prison system.\n\n“I know that the reality is that the place you stop crime is in this classroom, with proper funding to education, and with treatment available to those who need it,” Krasner said. A student asked the DA about his opinion on the federal government spending money overseas, when Krasner gave a political answer of “it’s complicated,” the student doubled down, going as far as referencing Norway’s healthcare system.\n\nIn January of 2023, the hit television show based on a Philadelphia Public School, ‘Abbott Elementary‘ aired its “Read-A-Thon” episode which introduced the now-running plot of Abbott’s podcast club.\n\n“I remember that episode,” Flemming continues “I love it. I love the idea that they’re doing it on, there was some discussion and murmuring. We were just wondering whether they got the idea from us.” Abbott Elementary writers did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe most downloaded episodes of ‘Behind the Eyes of Our Youth’ are about redlining’s relationship to crime in Black neighborhoods and college preparedness — and the audience is not just students. According to Flemming, the “audience isn’t generally teenagers. It’s mainly those 35 and up that listen to us.”\n\nThrough this podcast, Philly youth is capturing the attention of adults, while freely speaking their mind.",

        "source": "https://metrophiladelphia.com/",
        "content": "Sign up for our email newsletter to stay up-to-date on the latest local sports news throughout Philadelphia.\n\nDraft season is upon us, Eagles fans. The NFL combine provides NFL team executives and fans an opportunity to watch many of the best College prospects in the Nation perform drills that most believe translate to success in the NFL. There are many instances of players who have exceeded well during the season, not performing the best in Indianapolis and having their draft stock, and value take a nosedive.\n\nListed below are five players who excel while under such intense pressure and being under the proverbial microscope. This group exceeded most of the expectations and pre-conceived notions, and performed at a level that could see them skyrocket up draft boards by late April and possibly into the hands of Eagles GM Howie Roseman.\n\nMatthew Golden, Texas\n\nMatthew is a player many were surprised I had ranked as a first round talent on my first wide receiver rankings, and he somehow showed more than his fans expected at the combine. He ran the fastest 40 time at 4.29 and may not just be a first round talent, but a top 3 WR selected in the draft. Golden is 5’11 191, and takes off like a rocket. He can play every WR spot on the line, has a great catch radius, elite ball tracking skills, and smooth routes.\n\nHe has a lightning fast release that you have to see on film to believe. He is my WR 1 heading into the draft, but could be available later in the first, dependent on the style of receiver teams are looking to draft. Golden is also loyal, when asked who is one person dead or alive he would like to play catch with, he picked his Texas QB, Quinn Ewers.\n\nJack Bech, TCU\n\nMar 1, 2025; Indianapolis, IN, USA; TCU wideout Jack Bech during the 2025 NFL Combine at Lucas Oil Stadium. Mandatory Credit: Kirby Lee-Imagn Images\n\nBech had already impressed at the Senior Bowl, and did so again at the combine. Jack showed off quick, decisive running routes and soft hands. He has the desirable size, and the skill sets to last in the NFL for a long time. Bech offers the fluidity of a small receiver in a big body, which are unique traits at the WR position. A couple of receivers that many had ranked above him did not shine as much as Bech, and he is an option for a team willing to spend a day two selection on a pass catcher to enhance their offense. He will contribute in an NFL offense as a rookie.\n\nTate Ratledge, Georgia\n\nTate has the ideal size and athleticism that Eagles OL Coach Jeff Stoutland loves to bring into Stoutland University. He is a devastating run blocker and finisher, identifies interior pass rushes quickly, and gets to the next level with quickness. Ratledge is 6’6, 308 pounds, and showed off his speed with a 4.97 forty at the combine. His long mullet was flowing in the wind as he sped down Lucas Oil Stadium showcasing an elite, 1993 Phillies, Pete Incaviglia style haircut.\n\nTate also has the experience of going up against Nolan Smith and Jalen Carter in practice every day during his time at Georgia. This is the experience I want to see on the Eagles O-Line.\n\nBhayshul Tuten, Virginia Tech\n\nMar 1, 2025; Indianapolis, IN, USA; Virginia Tech running back Bhayshul Tuten (RB30) during the 2025 NFL Combine at Lucas Oil Stadium. Mandatory Credit: Kirby Lee-Imagn Images\n\nBhayshul has been one of my favorite RB targets for the Eagles since September. After his performance in Indianapolis, they will have a lot more competition for his services than originally thought. Tuten ran the fastest 40 at 4.32 and was first overall in the RB class with a 40.50 inch vertical jump.\n\nHis 40-yard dash time was faster than current Eagles RB Saquon Barkley and the Lions speedy running back Jahmyr Gibbs. Tuten is a home run threat every time he touches the ball and is also a valuable special teams player.\n\nHollin Pierce, Rutgers\n\nMar 1, 2025; Indianapolis, IN, USA; Rutgers University offensive lineman Hollin Pierce (OL32) answers questions at a press conference during the 2025 NFL Combine at Indiana Convention Center. Mandatory Credit: Jacob Musselman-Imagn Images\n\nHollin was a relative unknown pre-combine, I had him selected by the Eagles in my NFL Mock Draft 1.0, but that secret is out of the bag now!\n\nPierce tested freakishly well by showcasing an 88 1/4 inch wingspan, the second widest at the OT position since 1999. He also measured 36-inch arms. You can teach a lot of things, but this body type is not one of them. His size, strong anchor and core, are rare traits that one can imagine Coach Stoutland would love to develop at the U! He is a roadblock in pass pro and a mauler in the running game. Pierce is an ideal developmental OT who will only get better with proper coaching. There is no better destination for him than Philadelphia!\n\nAs always, thank you for reading!\n\nFollow me on X @PHLEagleNews\n\nMandatory Credit: Jacob Musselman-Imagn Images",

        "source": "https://metrophiladelphia.com/",
        "content": "Feb 25, 2025; Port Charlotte, Florida, USA; Philadelphia Phillies outfielder Justin Crawford (80) breaks his bat as he reaches on a fielders choice against the Tampa Bay Rays during the fourth inning at Charlotte Sports Park. Mandatory Credit: Kim Klement Neitzel-Imagn Images\n\nSign up for our email newsletter to stay up-to-date on the latest local sports news throughout Philadelphia.\n\nAs the start of the 2025 MLB season inches closer, MLB Pipeline churned out its first installment of team centric Top-30 prospect lists starting with the American and National League East. The Phillies are headlined by super pitching prospect Andrew Painter which is no surprise, who also ranks as the 8th-best prospect in all of baseball according to MLB Pipeline.\n\nWho fills in behind Painter for the rest of the top 10 and who are some intriguing prospects who landed on the top 30? Let’s take a look.\n\n*Where a player is projected to start the 2025 season is solely based on where the player finished in 2024.\n\n1. Andrew Painter, RHP\n\nNo surprise here. The 6-foot-7, 21-year-old has all the tools of being a potential ace at the big league level. Unfortunately, his young career came to a halt after going for Tommy John Surgery which kept him off a mound in competitive innings in both 2023 and 2024. Prior to the injury, he was on the fast track to the bigs in 2022, climbing up the organizational ladder playing in Low-A Clearwater, High-A Lakewood and Double-A Reading. Painter started in 22 total games posting an impressive 1.56 ERA across the three levels, racking up 155 strikeouts to just 25 walks in 103.2 innings.\n\nPainter has a lethal four pitch mix with all offerings able to miss bats which was on display in the Arizona Fall League in 2024 where he was named the league’s Pitcher of the Year. With a fastball that sits in the upper 90s and can hit triple digits to go along with a 60-grade slider while mixing in a curveball and change up, the sky is the limit for Painter. He could start the year in either Double-A or even Triple-A if the Phillies want him to face the best competition to start the season before is imminent call up to the big leagues.\n\n2. Aidan Miller, SS\n\nAlso, not much of a surprise that Miller slots in right behind Painter as the club’s #2 prospect. What is surprising is how impressive Miller has been at the position despite never playing it for a full season in his life. The young shortstop also is ranked inside the top 30 in all of baseball at #27 according to MLB Pipeline. Miller is coming off a solid 2024 campaign where he, like Painter did in 2022, traversed the first three levels of the minor leagues, wrapping up the season in Double-A Reading.\n\nMiller slashed .267/.375/.436 to go with 11 homers, 60 RBIs and 23 stolen bases. The Phillies may have gotten Miller at a discount due to a broken hamate bone the young infielder suffered after an impressive summer showcase. The Phillies scooped Miller up with the 27th overall pick in 2023 after looking like he was one of the top high school hitters in the draft class.\n\nMiller has gained a ton of recognition in his short time in the organization, representing the team in the MLB Futures Game. He only played in five games with the Fightin’ Phils to close out the 2024 season so it would be easy to figure he would start the year in Reading once Spring Training comes to a close.\n\n3. Justin Crawford, OF\n\nComing in as the third-best prospect for the Phillies and #64 in all of baseball, Crawford has turned a corner after a small sample size in his pro debut 2022 season where he played in just 16 games. Joining Miller in the Futures Game last year, the 21-year-old is a polarizing prospect blessed with blazing speed, courtesy of his dad Carl, who was a four-time All-Star and spent 15 years in the bigs with Rays, Red Sox and Dodgers and accumulated 480 career stolen bases which is inside the top 50 all-time in MLB history.\n\nWhen he signed with the club after being the 17th overall pick in the 2022 MLB Draft, he weighed about 160 pounds. Fast forward to this spring, he has put on 35 pounds, bulking up to 195 pounds and it’s led to louder and harder contact.\n\nCrawford, who split time between High-A Jersey Shore and Double-A Reading, slashed an impressive .313/.360/.444 across 110 games while swiping 42 bases, five shy of his young career watermark of 47 he had in 2023. It would make sense for Crawford to start the year back in Reading and work his way to a promotion to Triple-A Lehigh Valley at some point in the summer as he is starting to look like a potential five-tool player.\n\n4. Eduardo Tait, C\n\nTait is hoping to follow in the footsteps of Phillies fan-favorite in Carlos Ruiz as another catcher who can make an impact for the club representing Panama. He’s off to a strong start. At just 17-years-old, the backstop posted an impressive 117 wRC+, the same number that super prospect Leodalis De Vries posted for the San Diego Padres last season as one of the youngest players at the level.\n\nSigned for $90,000 in 2023, the left-handed, bat first catcher has showed some early returns on the investment for the Phillies. Tait, who gets penalized, unfairly like most catching prospects, because of the position he plays, split time between Rookie ball and Clearwater last year. In 80 games between the two stops, the catcher hit to the tune of .302 with 11 homers and 73 RBI. Once stateside, he played in 28 games with the Threshers and slashed .269/.316/.462.\n\nDefensively, Tait is still a work in progress but is continuing to work on everything that being a good catcher entails. Keep an eye on how Tait handles an entire season of pro ball here in the U.S. this year.\n\n5. Moises Chace, RHP\n\nThe more notable of the two names that came to the Phillies when they dealt Gregory Soto to Baltimore is Chace. The 21-year-old signed for $225,000 with the Orioles out of Venezuela and his fastball is what got him noticed. Sitting at a 60-grade pitch, Chace’s heater averaged just a tick under 95 m.p.h. while seeing it move up a few notches on the radar gun last year. To go along with the fastball, Chace features a sweeper, a cutter and a changeup.\n\nChace spent most of last season in High-A between Aberdeen with the O’s and Jersey Shore but did close out the year in Double-A where he made four starts posting a 3.66 ERA in 19.2 innings. He struck out an impressive 35 batters and walked just seven. He showed solid command of his repertoire and held opponents to a .200 batting average.\n\nAt 21-years-old, it would make sense he starts in AA with a potential fast move to Triple-A if he continues to dominate Eastern League hitters.\n\nProspects 6-10\n\nThe next five prospects on the list include outfielders Dante Nori and Griffin Brubaker at #6 and #7 with right-handed pitcher Mick Abel at #8, second baseman Devin Salitban at #9 and outfielder Gabriel Rincones Jr. as #10, who has turned heads already this spring, smacking three homers.\n\nIntriguing Phillies Prospect\n\nThe Phillies will have to wait a year, but right-handed pitcher and #19 prospect Wen-Hui Pan has some intrigue. Suffering a broken pinky kept him out of commission until mid-way through the season last year, but in his pro debut in 2023, he turned heads, pitching his way out of the bullpen up to High-A Jersey Shore. A native of Chinese Taipei and signed with the Phillies for $350,000 as an international free agent, Pan’s pitch mix, notably his fastball, could be his calling card to be a reliable late inning arm in the future.\n\nPan was tabbed to pitch in the Arizona Fall League in 2024, but he needed Tommy John surgery after elbow issues popped up so he will be out for the entire 2025 campaign.

        "content": "Sign up for our Daily Email newsletter to stay up-to-date on the latest local news throughout Philadelphia.\n\nActing in a stage show is a hard ordeal.\n\nBut, acting in two stage shows that simultaneously rotate every few nights is just another springtime season at Quintessence Theatre Company.\n\nThis March, 12 actors will be performing multiple roles in a rotating schedule of ‘A Midsummer Night’s Dream’ and ‘Antony & Cleopatra’ in a “Reckless Romance” repertory. Both written by William Shakespeare (whom the company loves to cover), this is the first time in a decade that Quintessence’s paired productions are written by The Bard.\n\n“In celebration of our ‘resident playwright,’ our 15th birthday, and the power of the classical actor, we return to repertory to present two of the most impactful works of Western literature,” says Quintessence Producing Artistic Director Alex Burns. Burns is directing both productions this spring.\n\n“Both plays are about the power of love: One a romantic comedy, the other a political thriller and romantic tragedy. Both celebrate a set of lovers whose passions are so great that they choose to stand outside of their society’s dictates and risk all for love. The result is that their reckless romances change the course of the world forever.”\n\nAs a release notes, the productions are highlighted by casts featuring some of the region’s best actors, including Philadelphia-based classic theatre actor and arts educator Tim Dugan, stage and screen actor Christopher Patrick Mullen, theatre artist and film actor DeAnna S Wright, and veteran actor and director Steven Anthony Wright.\n\n‘A Midsummer Night’s Dream’ already began previews and is set to open on Saturday, March 15. ‘Antony & Cleopatra’ on the other hand, begins previews on Wednesday, March 5, and opens on Saturday, March 22. Each of the 12 cast members play at least one role in each show, with some appearing in multiple roles in one or both plays.\n\nShakespeare’s ‘Midsummer’ follows four Athenian youths who reject their parents’ efforts to interfere in their romantic lives and choose to run away instead of facing the love-limiting laws of the land. When they meet a group of laborers secretly rehearsing their play for a royal competition, mayhem ensues. ‘Antony & Cleopatra’ on the other hand follows a time shortly after Julius Caesar is assassinated, the rebellion foiled, and the Roman Empire is now ruled equally by three men, of which Mark Antony is the most powerful—until he is subdued by the beauty, wit, and charm of Cleopatra.\n\n“With the future of our democracy in question, we look to the genius of Shakespeare to question how empires fall, the fallibility of fairy magic, and if winning the war is more important than following your heart,” Burns adds. “For hundreds of years, the bawdy comedy and eroticism of Shakespeare’s plays was censored, or misunderstood. Quintessence is excited to lean into the divine and the vulgar of human sexuality, exploring the comedy and the tragedy in hedonism.”\n\nThe full repertory schedule runs now through April 27. All performances take place at the historic Sedgwick Theater (7137 Germantown Avenue), and tickets start at $35, with premium seats available starting at $45. Group sales are also available.\n\nThese two shows also bring some stand-alone events to keep an eye out for. There will be two Behind The Scenes Previews: One for ‘Antony & Cleopatra’ on March 13, at 7 p.m. and another for ‘A Midsummer Night’s Dream’ on March 6, at 7 p.m. While there, visitors can join in on a pre-show chat hosted in the bar lobby 30 minutes before curtain time.\n\nAdditionally there will be two post-show convos — ‘Antony & Cleopatra’ on March 30, at 3 p.m. and one for ‘A Midsummer Night’s Dream’ on March 23 at 3 p.m. With these events specifically, a special guest will be invited on stage after the performance to lead a deep dive into the nuances of the production.\n\nQuintessence will also host Cast Talkback Nights (for ‘Antony’ on March 27, at 3 p.m. and ‘Midsummer’ on March 20, at 7 p.m.), a Queer Affinity Night with Burns (‘Antony’ on April 11, at 7:30 p.m. and ‘Midsummer’ on April 4, at 7:3o p.m.), an Industry Night where tickets are reduced (‘Antony’ on April 16, at 7 p.m. and ‘Midsummer’ on April 10, at 7 p.m.) and a Young Artists Night for aspiring artists (‘Antony’ April 3, at 7 p.m. and ‘Midsummer’ April 17, at 7 p.m.)\n\n‘Antony & Cleopatra’ and ‘A Midsummer Night’s Dream’ are also part of the 8th Annual Philadelphia Theatre Week, running April 3 to 13.\n\nTo find out more information on Quintessence Theatre Group, visit quintessencetheatre.org",

        "source": "https://metrophiladelphia.com/",
        "content": "For the past three years, Philadelphia police have not been able to stop drivers for eight minor vehicle violations.\n\nSign up for our Daily Email newsletter to stay up-to-date on the latest local news throughout Philadelphia.\n\nAndre Carroll took a phone call while sitting in his car at a gas station when a police cruiser pulled up behind him with its lights flashing.\n\nA Black man and a state representative based in Northwest Philadelphia, Carroll asked the officer what was wrong. The cop indicated that he had been there a while in his vehicle. Once Carroll identified himself, the officer told him everything was fine.\n\n“One of the things that I recognize is that not everyone has the opportunity to be an elected official,” he said. “An experience like that just three weeks ago could have gone terribly wrong.”\n\nCarroll recalled his recent encounter during a news conference Monday marking the three years since the implementation of the “Driving Equality” legislation, which prohibits police from pulling over a car solely for a series of minor violations.\n\nImpact of Driving Equality law\n\nProgress has been made to reduce potentially negative interactions with law enforcement, but data shows racial disparities persist, City Councilmember Isaiah Thomas and chief public defender Keisha Hudson said at the event.\n\n“A lot of Black people who would have been pulled over haven’t been pulled over,” said Thomas, the primary sponsor of the bill. “There’s probably a police officer who hasn’t been hurt because they’re involved in less traffic stops.”\n\nThe law reclassified eight offenses (registration that expired within a 60-day period, a visible but not properly placed temporary registration, hanging license plate, a single broken light, items dangling from the rearview mirror, minor bumper damage, expired or missing inspection sticker and expired or missing emission sticker) as secondary violations.\n\nPolice are still permitted to issue tickets for such infringements but only if they initially stop the car for a more serious violation, such as running a red light or stop sign.\n\nFollowing Monday’s remarks, there was a viewing of “Living While American,” a brief documentary about the proposal’s path through Council. Philadelphia was the first major city in the nation to limit the ability of officers to stop drivers, and several other jurisdictions have followed suit.\n\nProgress made, but racial disparities remain\n\nDriving Equality, as the legislation is known, faced pushback, amid a major crime spike coinciding with the coronavirus pandemic and concerns about reckless driving. However, in the wake of George Floyd’s killing and the resulting demonstrations, the initiative also drew significant support.\n\nThomas, a Black man who grew up in Philadelphia, was inspired by his own experience of being frequently pulled over. As a member of Council, he has formed strong bonds with PPD officers assigned to City Hall.\n\n“I think everybody should have that same experience with law enforcement,” he added. “For a lot of us growing up, every experience we have with a police officer is negative.”\n\nData shows that younger Black men are still the most likely to be stopped by police. Between October 2018 and September 2019, 72% of drivers pulled over were Black; last year, 63% were Black, though the share of the city’s Black population has also fallen 5 percentage points in that time, to 38%, according to the Defender’s Association.\n\n“We have miles to go, but this is incredible progress,” Hudson said Monday.\n\nThe Defender Association recently published a Driving Equality online dashboard with data culled from the PPD, the census and the city’s Vision Zero traffic safety initiative.\n\nPrior to the law’s implementation, the most common reason for a vehicular stop was a broken light, according to the dashboard. Now, it’s for red light and stop sign violations, and officers are pulling over more drivers on the High Injury Network, a collection of Philadelphia streets where 80% of all serious crashes occur.\n\nWhile vehicle stops increased in 2024, the contraband “hit rate” – the percentage of time when an officer finds a weapon or drugs – is down, the Defender Association determined.\n\nPush for transparency, accountability\n\nAn accompanying law required police to collect and publish additional information about vehicular stops, but the department has been slow to comply, Thomas and Hudson said. The Defender Association said there is only partial data for what prompted a stop and whether a gun was found.\n\nThe PPD did not respond to a request for comment about the data lags.\n\nThomas said lawmakers have made an aggressive push to expand automated enforcement, in lieu of police stops. He introduced legislation last week to install speed cameras in seven school zones, and the devices are also coming to Broad Street and additional roadways.\n\n“We feel like those are the things that are the best tools to be able to deter negative activities as it relates to driving and traffic,” Thomas said.",

        "content": "Sign up for our email newsletter to stay up-to-date on the latest local sports news throughout Philadelphia.\n\nThe Phillies’ starting rotation has a lot of buzz surrounding it heading into the regular season. Cristopher Sanchez continues to fuel that excitement after another impressive spring training start against the Baltimore Orioles on Sunday as the Phillies rallied in the ninth for a walk-off 5-4 win.\n\nSanchez Continues to Shine\n\nWith his fastball still pumping in the upper 90’s to go with a lethal changeup, Sanchez tossed 2.2 innings, racking up five strikeouts. He cruised through the first two innings before running into some trouble in the third.\n\nSanchez seemingly had his sixth punchout of the day to close out the third inning, but Baltimore’s Gary Sanchez challenged a full count pitch, which was overturned to a ball with the new ABS System implemented this Spring Training. The southpaw would go to the dugout regardless as he was pulled for reliever Gabe Mosser with the bases loaded, who gave up a two-run single to Colton Cowser. Sanchez was charged with two runs, only one earned though, as J.T. Realmuto was called for catcher’s interference to allow O’s super prospect Samuel Basallo to reach base.\n\nIn two starts, Sanchez has eight strikeouts to just one walk in 4.2 innings of work while opponents are hitting just .176 against him. It’s a small sample size, but it’s been noticeably impressive.\n\nBohm Homers Twice\n\nAfter rumors swirled all winter that the Phillies might be looking to trade All-Star third baseman Alec Bohm, Dave Dombroski put that to rest, and Bohm is looking to build off his All-Star campaign in 2024, where he hit 15 homers and drove in 97 RBI while posting a wRC+ of 115. The third baseman put a jolt into a changeup against Luis Gonzalez for his first homer and just his second hit of the spring to make it a 2-1 Phillies deficit in the fourth.\n\nHe followed up in his next at-bat with an opposite field shot to right field in the bottom of the sixth to give the Phillies a 3-2 lead for a multi-homer afternoon. Bohm had just one game last season where he hit two or more home runs, which came back on April 19 against the Chicago White Sox.\n\nMar 2, 2025; Dunedin, Florida, USA; Philadelphia Phillies pitcher Taijuan Walker (99) throws a pitch against the Toronto Blue Jays in the first inning during spring training at TD Ballpark. Mandatory Credit: Nathan Ray Seebeck-Imagn Images\n\nOscar In Outfield Mix\n\nOscar Mercado tied the game up with a solo blast in the bottom of the fifth inning for just his third hit of the spring. The outfielder was signed by the Phillies to a minor league deal to be part of the outfield competition. Mercado, originally a second-round pick by St. Louis had a strong rookie campaign slashing .269/.318/.443 with 15 homers and 15 steals in 482 plate appearances with Cleveland after acquiring him in a trade. Mercado has yet to duplicate that successful season and spent the majority of last year in Triple-A between Toldeo (Detroit) and El Paso (San Diego) playing in 93 games hitting .222 with 12 homers and 50 RBIs.\n\nNinth Inning Rally\n\nTrailing 4-3 in the bottom of the ninth, the Phillies mounted a two-out comeback. Payton Henry extended the game with a walk. After Bryan Rincon singled and Paul McIntosh was plunked by a pitch to load the bases, Matt Kroon singled to left to drive in two for the come-from-behind won.\n\nOther Phillies Notes\n\nKyle Schwarber got the start in left field for the Phillies Sunday afternoon. Schwarber made just five starts in the corner outfield position last year for the Phils, but is no stranger to playing left. In 2022 and 2023, he was the club’s primary left fielder, making 142 total starts during that span. Edmundo Sosa entered the game in the 7th inning and played right field as the Phillies look to provide more versatility for the utilityman.\n\nThe Phillies had a split-squad day in the Sunshine State and lost to Toronto in Dunedin 5-4. The team will be back in action on Tuesday when they travel to Tampa to take on the Yankees at 1:05 p.m.\n\nMandatory Credit: Kim Klement Neitzel-Imagn Images",

        "content": "New York City is a city built by immigrants, and we are not just stronger because of our diversity — we are the greatest city on the globe because of it. Since 2022, we have faced an unprecedented influx of asylum seekers across the five boroughs as conditions worsened in countries abroad. Our administration met that influx head-on, offering newcomers food, clothing, and shelter. Thanks to our efforts, over 189,100 of the 232,600 of the migrants — or 81 percent — who requested services from the city in the last three years have taken the next steps in their journeys toward self-sufficiency. Because of the Adams administration’s work to address the international crisis and to support asylum seekers as they pursue their path towards the American Dream, 84 percent of eligible adult migrants have either received work authorization or applied for work authorization. The city also purchased more than 53,200 tickets to help asylum seekers reach their preferred destinations and reduce long-term costs for New York City taxpayers.\n\nWhile we continue to care for those who arrive in our city, last week marked another milestone in demonstrating the immense progress of our unparalleled, international humanitarian effort.\n\nWe announced that The Roosevelt Hotel — which has served as both our Asylum Arrival Center and a Humanitarian Emergency Response and Relief Center for nearly two years — will be closing in the coming months. Thanks to the successful strategies we implemented here in New York City, we are able to help even more asylum seekers take the next steps in their journeys, while simultaneously saving taxpayers millions of dollars.\n\nThe Roosevelt Hotel has been key in allowing us to effectively manage our operations, processing almost 75 percent of migrants who have entered our city asking for shelter over the last two years. Out of the more than 232,600 migrants who have come into the city’s care, over 173,000 registrations were completed at The Roosevelt Hotel between May 2023 and February 2025.\n\nSince the first asylum seekers arrived in New York City in the spring of 2022, we have focused on helping them become self-sufficient. The New York City Department of Small Business Services has connected the migrant population to hundreds of job opportunities. And the administration’s case management and resettlement teams — in conjunction with teams across multiple city agencies — continue to find creative ways to assist recent arrivals, from direct outreach and resource fairs to onsite English as a Second Language courses at shelters.\n\nDuring the height of the influx, the city received an average of 4,000 arrivals each week. Now, because of our administration’s skillful management, we are down to an average of just 350 new arrivals each week. With the closure of our operations at The Roosevelt Hotel, our intake functions and supportive services will now be integrated into other areas of the system.\n\nOur actions have shown an entire nation what can be accomplished when we lead with compassion and resourcefulness. Because of the work we have done, we will emerge from this crisis stronger than ever before. We are all New Yorkers together: anything that affects one of us, affects us all. I have faith in our great city to continue to be a beacon of hope, and a place where people from every corner of the world can build a new life.",

Slay is now 34-years-old and despite playing at a solid level in 2024, was on the books for around a $13M cap hit, according to spotrac. The Eagles had an option going into 2025 and have decided to double down on their plethora of young corners instead of paying big money to a veteran. They will save around $4M in cap space as a result.\n\nJan 12, 2025; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA; Philadelphia Eagles cornerback Darius Slay Jr. (2) makes an interception against Green Bay Packers wide receiver Dontayvion Wicks (13) during the first half in an NFC wild card game at Lincoln Financial Field.

He ends his tenure with 9 picks in 74 games, 272 total tackles and 56 pass breakups.\n\nWhile it hasn’t always been sunny, Slay’s presence in the Philadelphia secondary brought to an end the tumultuous era of failed CB experiments. The Birds were able to hang their hat on slay while the next generation developed and without him, the team might not have enjoyed the defensive success it has.\n\nIn his place, the Eagles do have in-house options. Isaiah Rodgers and Kelee Ringo will be the fonrtrunners going into OTA’s, but there is always the possibility of another rookie being added, or even a slightly younger veteran being added to the roster.\n\nDarius Slay made three Pro Bowls as an Eagle and will undoubtedly go down as one of the best corners of this generation. To have watched him for 5 years in midnight green has been a sight for sore eyes and hopefully he’s able to catch onto another team for one last rodeo.\n\nMandatory Credit: Bill Streicher-Imagn Images",

Mandatory Credit: Bill Streicher-Imagn Images\n\nSign up for our email newsletter to stay up-to-date on the latest local sports news throughout Philadelphia.\n\nIn a country where association football fans make up 67% of the population, American football has lived its years playing second fiddle and it’s not even close. Between both namesakes lies a mileage, one so distant that the intervention of other sports, like basketball, athletics, tennis and boxing has done nothing in stimulating the competition. However, with reformers like Philadelphia Eagles’ defensive tackle, Moro Ojomo who, after his Super Bowl triumph, is set to headline a major veer in Nigeria, the course is set to be altered in favor of American football.\n\nAs the over 200 million global audience of Super Bowl LVIII came off the treat of a mind blowing halftime show performance by Usher, they were immediately teleported to Africa by a 146-second commercial, “Born to Play,” starred by two-time Super Bowl champion and leader of IPP Africa, Osi Umenyiora. The message of the commercial – the NFL International Player Pathway Program (IPP) – with much clarity, was summed up in Osi’s parting words to the youngster, Kwesi (Eldad Osime):\n\n“It doesn’t matter where you’re born, as long as you’re born to play”\n\nThese words did more than the task of thrilling the audience with its poetic effect; it was the recommissioning of a 2017 pathway constructed by the NFL, from North America to Africa. At the time – 2023 leading to 2024 – the pathway had just guided six Nigerians to the NFL. And in all, there were about 11 players of Nigerian descent in the NFL, with Ravens’ wide receiver and former Eagles’ Super Bowl winner, Nelson Agholor, among the prominent ones.\n\nThe IPP class of 2025, mirroring the kind of giant strides the IPP has been making in Nigeria, had players of Nigerian descent make up over 25% of about two dozen talents from various regions of the world.\n\nThe clear strategy to market the game by adding more Nigerian players was blazed by soccer, where the presence of stars, like Ademola Lookman, Victor Osimhen, Bukayo Saka, Alex Iwobi; and legends, like Kanu Nwankwo, Austin Jayjay Okocha, John Obi Mikel and others in the sport, has successfully reinforced its influence in the nation.\n\nFootball – NFL – Super Bowl LIX – Philadelphia Eagles v Kansas City Chiefs – Caesars Superdome, New Orleans, Louisiana, United States – February 9, 2025 Philadelphia Eagles’ Moro Ojomo and C.J. Gardner-Johnson celebrate a turnover on downs REUTERS/Mike Segar\n\nImpressively, the NFL is charting a similar course. Led by Eagles’ defensive tackle, Moro Ojomo, more than ten Nigerians featured on NFL rosters in 2024.\n\nIn the long run, it’s a symbiotic relationship where the NFL heightens its influence in the region and drinks from the pool of African talents, while Africans also reap the dividends of the numerous opportunities presented by the sport. Since the commercial at Super Bowl LVIII, the outlook of American football in Nigeria has witnessed tremendous developments. Yet, even without an IPP commercial, the Eagles’ triumph at Super Bowl LIX is on its way to sparking more remarkable shifts in the country.\n\nWhile the Eagles’ visit to President Donald Trump at the White House has been pending since their victory, home is truly where love resides for Moro Ojomo, who was welcomed with his parents by President Bola Tinubu to the Presidential Aso Rock Villa in Nigeria some days ago.\n\nThe Eagles’ defensive tackle proved himself worthy of honor when he announced that his home country was his next Caesars SuperDome, where he was set to exert himself fully and leave an indelible mark on the history books of American football – like he did at the Super Bowl.\n\nJan 26, 2025; Philadelphia, PA, USA; Philadelphia Eagles defensive tackle Moro Ojomo (97) tackles Washington Commanders running back Brian Robinson Jr. (8) during the first half in the NFC Championship game at Lincoln Financial Field. Mandatory Credit: Bill Streicher-Imagn Images\n\nAlongside his plans to establish a football academy, the athlete also spoke about his vision to create opportunities for Nigerian youth and nurture the next generation of athletes.\n\nSpeaking upon his arrival in the country, Ojomo emphasized his commitment to seeing the rapid development of American football in Nigeria.\n\n“In the meeting yesterday, we proposed a plan to ultimately build an academy that not only promotes Nigerian-born athletes overseas or Nigerian descendants who come back and visit but also points to the youths and gives them abilities to grow in strength and grow into skill. That is what is in the pipeline,” he said.\n\n“The goal is to see Nigerians doing well in American football. I believe the sport is not popular in Nigeria because people do not understand it.’’\n\n“There is a lot of work being done with the flag football team. Some tryouts are happening in Lagos right now. I think they want to get them ready for the Olympics in 2028,” the footballer added.\n\nHe also highlighted the importance of providing young people with the necessary investments that can improve the face of Nigeria sports on the global stage.\n\n“I would not be here without Nigeria. I think that there is a saying that the grass is not greener where you go, it’s greener when you water it. We have the opportunity to water it.”\n\n“What we are working on now is just to provide more opportunities for the youths and ultimately make Nigeria the greatest country in the world. So that’s the goal,” Ojomo remarked.\n\nTruly, it could be a lengthy journey for American football, but with footballers like Moro Ojomo, the pathway continues to flourish in Nigeria. And while the only referent of Eagles in the country has always been the country’s soccer national team: Super Eagles, with the continuous growth of American football, the goal is that soon enough, the Philadelphia Eagles will receive a share of that recognition.\n\nMandatory Credit: Bill Streicher-Imagn Images",

        "content": "Sign up for our Daily Email newsletter to stay up-to-date on the latest local news throughout Philadelphia.\n\nCity Council is calling on immigration authorities to release a 44-year-old Philadelphia man who has been detained for months and is at risk of being deported to a country he has never visited.\n\nIn a resolution adopted Thursday, lawmakers also urged the city’s Congressional delegation to “champion welcoming immigration policies,” amid President Donald Trump’s promises to remove millions of undocumented people from the country.\n\n“This is bigger than just ‘One’,” said Councilmember Nicolas O’Rourke, the author of the resolution. “His detention is part of a broader system designed to disappear people, to make their suffering invisible and to shield the truth from the public.”\n\nSereyrath “One” Van was born in a Thailand refugee camp to Cambodian parents who fled in the wake of the Khmer Rouge genocide. At 4 years old, he immigrated to Southwest Philadelphia and was a legal permanent resident until 2021, when a judge revoked his status following a drug dealing conviction.\n\nVan was detained in August during a meeting with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents, as family members and immigrant advocates demonstrated outside the agency’s Center City office.\n\nHe has been housed since at Moshannon Valley Processing Center, an ICE detention facility in Central Pennsylvania. He could potentially be deported to Thailand or Cambodia; he has never stepped foot in the latter.\n\n“It’s been over seven months,” said Nancy Nguyen, executive director of VietLead, a Southeast Asian community group that has organized a campaign to support Van. “And if not for the community pressure, if not for the legal strategies, working with Free Migration Project, One might already be gone.”\n\nHe was released from state prison in 2023 after serving nearly six years for narcotics distribution. An immigration judge last month upheld an earlier ruling that the offense was serious enough to warrant deportation.\n\n“This is a case that exposes a deeper systematic injustice, where immigrants and refugees are being doubly punished for past convictions with devastating consequences like indefinite detention and family separation,” said Adrianna Torres-García, deputy director at Free Migration Project, which has been defending Van in court.\n\nVan has taken responsibility and expressed remorse for his crime, but he does not believe he should be banished from the United States.\n\n“You send me to Cambodia, that’s like triple punishment,” Van told Metro in August. “I did my time. I know I’m going to get deported, but now you’re trying to deport me to a country I’ve never been to. It’s kind of like, how much punishment do I deserve?”\n\nRepresentatives from VietLead, O’Rourke’s office and Juntos, a South Philadelphia-based Latine organization, visited Van and other locals locked up at Moshannon on Friday.\n\nO’Rourke said he and state Sen. Nikil Saval have asked for a tour of the facility; ICE denied the request, stating that the lawmakers could meet with Van in the visitation area, he added.\n\n“This selective access is the opposite of transparency,” O’Rourke said. “We need to see and understand the broader conditions that our incarcerated constituents are forced to endure at Moshannon.”\n\nICE did not respond to a request for comment or reply to questions about Van’s case.\n\nO’Rourke noted that it was reported, by the Inquirer and NBC10, less than two weeks ago that a section of Philadelphia’s Federal Detention Center in Center City is now being used to house ICE detainees.\n\nAt a news conference following Thursday’s Council session, advocates said they want local, state and federal elected leaders, including Mayor Cherelle Parker, to speak up and do more to protect immigrants.\n\n“We need those leaders to be courageous, too,” Nguyen said. “It is not enough what has been happening. It is far from enough.”\n\nResources for local immigrants\n\nNationalities Service Center: 1216 Arch St 4th floor; 215-893-8400; nscphila.org\n\nHIAS PA: 123 S Broad St.; 215-832-0900; hiaspa.org\n\nWelcoming Center: 211 N. 13th St., 4th floor; 215-557-2626; welcomingcenter.org\n\nEsperanza Immigration Legal Services: 4261 N 5th St.; 215-324-0746; esperanza.us",

        "content": "INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA – FEBRUARY 25: General manager Howie Roseman of the Philadelphia Eagles speaks to the media during the NFL Scouting Combine at the Indiana Convention Center on February 25, 2025 in Indianapolis, Indiana. (Photo by Stacy Revere/Getty Images)\n\nSign up for our email newsletter to stay up-to-date on the latest local sports news throughout Philadelphia.\n\nThe legal tampering period for NFL free agency begins on March 10 at 12 PM ET. Despite winning Super Bowl LIX, Philadelphia Eagles general manager Howie Roseman will have plenty of important decisions to make this offseason.\n\nPhiladelphia is expected to lose several starters this offseason and Roseman will need to somehow fill those voids. The Eagles aren’t expected to be big spenders in free agency, yet there are plenty of intriguing options with ties to the coaching staff or players in Philadelphia.\n\nWhile there are also multiple former Eagles players that are set to hit the open market this offseason, here are 25 potential free agent targets with ties to Philadelphia that haven’t played in the City of Brotherly Love.\n\nWhich Offensive Free Agents Have Ties to the Eagles?\n\nJan 26, 2025; Philadelphia, PA, USA; Philadelphia Eagles head coach Nick Sirianni and offensive coordinator Kellen Moore during the first half in the NFC Championship game at Lincoln Financial Field. Mandatory Credit: Bill Streicher-Imagn Images\n\nTrayveon Williams, RB\n\nEagles running back coach Jemal Singleton spent two seasons on the Cincinnati Bengals with Trayveon Williams. Eagles wide receiver coach Aaron Moorehead was also at Texas A&M with Williams as well. While Williams has just 62 carries for 307 yards in his NFL career, he has experience on special teams and can return kicks.\n\nSamaje Perine, RB\n\nSimilar to Williams, Samaje Perine also spent time working with Singleton in Cincinnati. Perine is a far more proven NFL running back than Williams and played an important role as the passing down option in the backfield for the Kansas City Chiefs last season. Perine would make plenty of sense as a veteran addition to Philadelphia’s backfield in free agency.\n\nRaheem Mostert, RB\n\nAfter going undrafted in the 2015 NFL Draft, Raheem Mostert was a preseason darling for the Eagles. Yet he was ultimately poached off the team’s practice squad and eventually flourished elsewhere. While Mostert is now 32-years-old, he worked with new Eagles pass game coordinator Parks Frazier with the Miami Dolphins last season and would provide veteran depth in Philadelphia’s backfield.\n\nBraxton Berrios, WR\n\nBritain Covey will likely hit the open market as I don’t expect the Eagles to tender him as a restricted free agent. Therefore, Philadelphia could look for a slot wide receiver with experience as a returner. Braxton Berrios would check both of those boxes and was in Miami with Frazier last season.\n\nAshton Dulin, WR\n\nOutside of Philadelphia’s top three wide receivers, the Eagles could hold a competition for the remaining spots in the room next season. Ashton Dulin has experience working with several members of Philadelphia’s coaching staff due to his time with the Indianapolis Colts. Dulin would provide depth at wide receiver, while also being a core player on special teams.\n\nDurham Smythe, TE\n\nBoth Dallas Goedert and Grant Calcaterra are heading into the final year of their current contracts. While Durham Smythe certainly wouldn’t challenge for a starting, he’s an ideal depth option at tight end. Smythe has plenty of experience with over 3,600 career snaps in the NFL and was with Frazier in Miami last season.\n\nKylen Granson, TE\n\nWhile Kylen Granson didn’t overlap with Nick Sirianni, Kevin Patullo and Jason Michael in Indianapolis, he was there with Frazier. Granson is 26-years-old and has shown plenty of potential in 17 career starts for the Colts. He is an ascending player that averaged 12.5 yards per reception over his last two seasons.\n\nQuintin Morris, TE\n\nThe Buffalo Bills reportedly won’t tender Quintin Morris and he is slated to become an unrestricted free agent. Morris served as a backup tight end in Buffalo, yet he spent two seasons with new Eagles quarterback coach Scot Loeffler at Bowling Green. Loeffler will have insight on Morris and the Eagles could take a chance on his untapped potential.\n\nMo Alie-Cox, TE\n\nAfter a promising season in 2020, Mo Allie-Cox has yet to take the next step that many were anticipating. Now at 31-years-old, Allie-Cox is purely a depth option at the position. Yet Philadelphia’s offensive coaching staff is very familiar with him and could bring him in as experienced insurance behind Goedert and Calcaterra.\n\nKendall Lamm, OL\n\nFred Johnson is slated to hit free agency and the Eagles could look to sign his replacement. Kendall Lamm would be an ideal swing tackle target for next season, as he has played over 1,000 snaps at both left tackle and right tackle in the NFL. Lamm also spent last season in Miami with Frazier, where he started seven games at right tackle and didn’t allow a single sack.\n\nBlake Hance, OL\n\nPhiladelphia’s depth along the offensive line was certainly put to the test at times last season. While Blake Hance certainly isn’t a household name, he would provide depth and positional versatility. Hance was with new Eagles offensive line coach Greg Austin for the last two seasons on the Jacksonville Jaguars. He has started games at both left guard and right tackle in the NFL.\n\nMark Glowinski, OL\n\nIf Mekhi Becton departs in free agency, Eagles could look to add a veteran right guard to compete with Tyler Steen in 2025. Mark Glowinski played for multiples seasons in Indianapolis with several members of Philadelphia’s coaching staff. The 32-year-old veteran has played nearly 6,000 snaps at right guard in the NFL and wouldn’t cost a lot to bring in.\n\nWhich Defensive Free Agents Have Ties to the Eagles?\n\nSep 22, 2024; Cleveland, Ohio, USA; New York Giants linebacker Bobby Okereke (58) and New York Giants linebacker Azeez Ojulari (51) celebrate after a sack during the first quarter against the Cleveland Browns at Huntington Bank Field. Mandatory Credit: Ken Blaze-Imagn Images\n\nPoona Ford, IDL\n\nEagles defensive line coach Clint Hurtt worked with Poona Ford for five seasons during their time together with the Seattle Seahawks. Ford enjoyed a resurgent season with the Los Angeles Chargers in 2024, as he recorded three sacks and five batted passes, including an interception. Ford would provide experience and depth along Philadelphia’s defensive line.\n\nDenzel Perryman, LB\n\nDenzel Perryman played with Ford in Los Angeles last season, as he started 11 games for the NFL’s top scoring defense. Perryman began his NFL career with the Chargers in 2015 and Eagles linebacker coach Bobby King served as the team’s assistant linebacker coach at that time. Now Perryman and King could potentially be reunited a decade later as the Eagles look for help at linebacker.\n\nJustin Strnad, LB\n\nJustin Strnad was selected by the Denver Broncos in the fifth round of the 2020 NFL Draft, which happened to be Vic Fangio’s second season as the team’s head coach. Strnad enjoyed a breakout season for Denver’s stout defense in 2024. The 28-year-old linebacker played 736 snaps and recorded 73 total tackles, eight tackles for loss and three sacks. He could be Philadelphia’s next lottery ticket at linebacker.\n\nCody Barton, LB\n\nAfter being selected in the third round of the 2019 NFL Draft, Cody Barton started just five games across his first three seasons. Yet he has started at least 11 games for three different teams over the last three seasons. Barton was a key player on Denver’s defense in 2024, as he recorded 106 total tackles, two interceptions and 1.5 sacks. Barton also spent four seasons in Seattle with Hurtt.\n\nE.J. Speed, LB\n\nE.J. Speed was in Indianapolis with several key members of Philadelphia’s coaching staff. Yet he didn’t emerge as a full-time starter for the Colts until 2023. Speed has recorded 244 total tackles and three forced fumbles over the last two seasons. Speed will turn 30-years-old in June and likely won’t break the bank in free agency but he would provide the Eagles with starting experience at linebacker.\n\nLorenzo Carter, EDGE\n\nLorenzo Carter hasn’t overlapped with any of Philadelphia’s current coaches but he does have a relationship with Nolan Smith as a former Georgia Bulldog. While they didn’t play together at Georgia, Smith discussed how Carter was one of his mentors. Carter is an experienced edge rusher with 62 career starts in the NFL and would add depth on the outside in Philadelphia.\n\nDeMarcus Walker, EDGE\n\nThe Chicago Bears released DeMarcus Walker in February and he has worked with both Fangio and King in the past. Walker started 29 games over the last two seasons for the Bears and would bring experience to Philadelphia’s defensive front. He’ll turn 31-years-old in September and could help fill the void created by several potential departures for the Eagles this offseason.\n\nEmmanuel Ogbah, EDGE\n\nDuring Fangio’s lone season as the Dolphins defensive coordinator, there were several players that didn’t appreciate his coaching style. While it’s unclear how he felt about Emmanuel Ogbah in Miami, the veteran edge defender called Fangio a “genius” that “definitely evolved my game a lot” back in December of 2023. If Ogbah still feels that way about Fangio, a reunion in the City of Brotherly Love would certainly make sense.\n\nBaron Browning, EDGE\n\nIn Fangio’s final season as head coach of the Broncos, Denver selected Baron Browning in the third round of the 2021 NFL Draft. Browning started nine games at linebacker as a rookie in Fangio’s defense. Yet he was moved to the edge for each of the last three seasons with inconsistent results. At 26-years-old, Browning could revive his career and potentially replicate Baun’s success in Philadelphia.\n\nKhalil Mack, EDGE\n\nKhalil Mack is a proven veteran that has easily had the most decorated career of any player on this list. Yet at 34-years-old, Mack could opt to take less money and chase a Super Bowl with the Eagles. Especially given his relationship with Fangio, who was Chicago’s defensive coordinator when they pulled off a blockbuster deal for Mack in 2018. Mack has referred to Fangio as a “mastermind” in the past.\n\nAzeez Ojulari, EDGE\n\nOct 20, 2024; East Rutherford, New Jersey, USA; New York Giants linebacker Azeez Ojulari (51) takes down Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Jalen Hurts (1) during the first half at MetLife Stadium. Mandatory Credit: Robert Deutsch-Imagn Images\n\nFollowing an inconsistent start to his NFL career with the New York Giants, Azeez Ojulari could revive his career in Philadelphia. Especially given his experience playing with several Eagles players during their time together at Georgia. Ojulari is just 24-years-old and is slightly underrated due to being stuck behind Brian Burns and Kayvon Thibodeaux in New York last season.\n\nFabian Moreau, CB\n\nAfter releasing Darius Slay and with Isaiah Rodgers set to test free agency, Philadelphia could use help at cornerback. Fabian Moreau started 11 games for the Broncos in 2023, while Eagles defensive backs coach Christian Parker served the same role in Denver. While Moreau will turned 31-years-old in April, he has played nearly 4,500 snaps in the NFL and would bring experience to Philadelphia’s young cornerback room.\n\nTremon Smith, CB\n\nThe Eagles will need to add competition at the bottom of their cornerback depth chart and Tremon Smith could make sense as a cheap option there. Smith worked for two seasons with Parker in Denver and was also with several Eagles coaches on the Colts in 2020. He has plenty of experience playing on special teams and has five career starts in the NFL.\n\nJulian Blackmon, S\n\nReed Blankenship has one season remaining on his current contract, therefore the Eagles could look to add a safety in free agency. While Julian Blackmon could command a hefty contract in free agency, Philadelphia could be intrigued by his versatility. Blackmon has played all over with the Colts, including over 500 snaps in the slot. He was in Indianapolis for one season with several members of Philadelphia’s coaching staff.\n\nElijah Campbell, S\n\nIf the Eagles want to add low-cost depth at safety with special teams experience, Elijah Campbell could make sense. Campbell started one game at safety under Fangio for the Dolphins in 2023 and has served as a core special teams player in Miami for several seasons. Campbell would compete for one of the final roster spots at safety in Philadelphia.\n\nPhoto by Stacy Revere/Getty Images",

The decision does not affect cyber efforts by other agencies like the CIA or CISA. Experts warn the pause could leave the US vulnerable to cyber threats from Russia and China.\n\n\n\nDefense Secretary Pete Hegseth has ordered a pause on offensive cyberoperations against Russia, rolling back some of the Pentagon’s efforts to counter foreign cyber threats.\n\nA US official, speaking anonymously due to the sensitivity of the matter, confirmed the decision Monday. The move does not impact cyber operations led by other government agencies, including the CIA and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA).\n\nHowever, the Trump administration has also scaled back FBI efforts and other counter-digital security programs, raising concerns among national security and cybersecurity experts about the US response to foreign cyber threats.\n\nWhy did the US pause cyber operations against Russia?\n\nWhat we know:\n\nUS Cyber Command, a division of the Department of Defense, is responsible for military cyber defenses and planning offensive cyberoperations.\n\nThe decision to pause operations was first reported by The Record, though the exact reasoning behind it remains unclear. Meanwhile, the Trump administration has faced mounting criticism for rolling back cyber and election security efforts across multiple federal agencies.\n\nRELATED: Trump pauses aid to Ukraine after Oval Office clash with Zelenskyy\n\nWhat we don't know:\n\nIt is uncertain whether the pause is connected to ongoing US-Russia diplomatic efforts regarding Ukraine.\n\nThe White House has not commented on whether Hegseth’s directive is part of a larger national security strategy. Additionally, no timeline has been provided for when, or if, offensive cyberoperations against Russia will resume.\n\nHow does this decision impact US cybersecurity?\n\nThe other side:\n\nMany national security and cybersecurity experts argue that pausing offensive cyberoperations weakens the US’s ability to counter growing threats from Russia and China. They have urged the government to expand its cyber capabilities, warning that adversaries are becoming more aggressive in digital warfare.\n\nCIA Director John Ratcliffe has previously emphasized the importance of cyber offense, stating during his Senate confirmation hearing, \"I want us to have all of the tools necessary to go on offense against our adversaries in the cyber community.\"\n\nRELATED: What's next after Trump-Zelenskyy blowup?\n\nWhat they're saying:\n\nCybersecurity expert Snehal Antani, CEO of Horizon3.ai, warned that cyber threats are evolving rapidly, making this a critical moment for US cyber readiness.\n\n\"We are entering this era of cyber-enabled economic warfare that is at the nation-state level,\" Antani said. \"We’re in this really challenging era where offense is significantly better than defense, and it’s going to take a while for defense to catch up.\"\n\nFILE - Pete Hegseth, US secretary of defense, during a cabinet meeting at the White House in Washington, DC, US, on Wednesday, Feb. 26, 2025.

        "content": "The Brief Hundreds of firefighters tackled the massive fire at SPS Techonogies two weeks ago. FOX 29 is highlighting the many women firefighters who tackled the blaze and more while in the male-dominated fiels. Firefighters showed off their skills during a training session at the Montgomery County Fire Academy on Monday night.\n\n\n\nTwo weeks ago, an out-of-control fire was raging at a Montgomery County factory.\n\nHundreds of firefighters from 64 different companies battled the flames.\n\nOn Monday, the third night of Women's History Month, there is a new push to highlight the women firefighters among those heroes and to encourage more women to get involved.\n\nWhat they're saying:\n\nKylee Hall, a 23-year-old volunteer with the Bryn Mawr Fire Company for the last two and a half years, lives in a fire company-owned house right down the road as part of a live-in program.\n\n\"We wake up in the middle of the night, leave our families, and we still have to go to work in the morning,\" Hall said.\n\nShe and several of her female peers showed off some of their skills at a training session at the Montgomery County Fire Academy on Monday night.\n\nMany of these women helped battle the massive factory fire in Abington two weeks ago.\n\nThese women are committed to their volunteer work in a male-dominated field.\n\n\"I'm also a chemical engineer, so I'm very used to the male-dominated field,\" Hall said. \"At the end of the day, when we're at a fire, when I have my helmet and my mask on, there's no difference. As long as you can do the job, you're equally respected.\"\n\nAccording to the National Volunteer Fire Council, in Pennsylvania, the number of volunteers has shrunk from 300,000 in the 1970s to just 38,000 in 2018.\n\n\"We're recruiting men, women, high schoolers—anyone who wants to join our ranks. We welcome them with open arms,\" said George Wilmot, Flourtown Fire Chief and past president of the Montgomery County Fire Chiefs Association.\n\nWilmot says 90% of the county relies on volunteers. \"What's happening now is we are calling more companies in for a single fire. You're getting 5-6-7 companies for a single fire, whereas before you'd get 2 or 3 because you'd have the sheer numbers needed,\" he explained.\n\nMontgomery County has launched a multi-year recruitment campaign to address the critical shortage.\n\n\"You come in, we get you the gear and the training. Everything you need is basically free,\" Wilmot said.\n\nIn return, Hall says you gain valuable leadership and life skills, make great friends who are like family, and give back to the local community all at the same time. \"The most thrilling part about it is being there for the community and being able to support people in a way that a lot of other people can't,\" Hall said.\n\nFor more information on the Montco recruitment effort, head to their website.",

This round is being sent directly by agencies, making noncompliance harder to avoid. Trump and Musk continue their push to tighten oversight and reduce the federal workforce.\n\n\n\nFederal employees have begun receiving a second round of emails requiring them to list their recent accomplishments, a renewed push by President Donald Trump and billionaire adviser Elon Musk to scrutinize the government workforce.\n\nInitially expected to go out on Saturday, the emails started appearing in some employees' inboxes late Friday, according to a person familiar with the plan who spoke to the Associated Press on condition of anonymity.\n\nThe first email, sent a week ago, asked workers \"What did you do last week?\" and required them to list five completed tasks. However, the request led to confusion and pushback, with many agencies telling employees not to respond or issuing conflicting guidance.\n\nLess than half of federal workers complied, according to the White House.\n\nWhat’s changing in the second email?\n\nWhat we know:\n\nUnlike the first email, which was distributed by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), this round will come directly from individual agencies, which have the power to enforce compliance. The change is expected to make it easier to discipline employees who fail to respond.\n\nLeader of the Department of Government Efficiency Elon Musk wears a shirt that says \"Tech Support\" as he speaks during a cabinet meeting with US President Donald Trump at the White House in Washington, DC, on February 26, 2025. (Leader of the Department of Government Efficiency Elon Musk wears a shirt that says \"Tech Support\" as he speaks during a cabinet meeting with US President Donald Trump at the White House in Washington, DC, on February 26, 2025.)\n\nAt Trump's first Cabinet meeting of his second term, Musk defended the demand, calling it a \"pulse check\" to ensure that government workers \"have a pulse and two neurons.\" Trump backed Musk's approach, claiming that some federal employees \"don’t exist\" or are no longer alive—though he provided no evidence to support the claim.\n\nWhat we don't know:\n\nIt remains unclear how national security agencies will handle the request. After the first email, agencies handling classified work told employees not to respond due to security concerns. The White House has not specified how the new email will apply to these departments.\n\nAdditionally, Trump and Musk have not outlined what consequences workers might face if they fail to respond again. Trump has suggested that those who ignored the first request are \"on the bubble\" and at risk of being fired or investigated.\n\nJob cuts and buyouts already underway\n\nWhat's next:\n\nWhile federal employees await more clarity on the email, layoffs are already beginning.\n\nThe Education Department has offered $25,000 buyouts to some employees, warning them of an impending \"very significant Reduction in Force.\" The agency has set a Monday deadline for workers to accept the buyout offer.\n\nA memo circulated this week indicated that large-scale layoffs and program consolidations are expected across multiple agencies as part of Trump’s government restructuring efforts.",

        "content": "The Brief Tariffs on Mexico and Canada: The U.S. is set to impose 25% tariffs on imports from both countries, with Canadian energy products taxed at a lower 10% rate. China tariffs doubled early: Trump increased tariffs on Chinese goods from 10% to 20% on Monday, a day ahead of schedule. Impact on prices: The tariffs are expected to raise costs on vehicles, food, electronics, and other key imports, while Mexico, Canada, and China weigh countermeasures.\n\n\n\nPresident Donald Trump is moving ahead with 25% tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico, which took effect on Tuesday, while doubling tariffs on Chinese goods to 20% a day earlier than expected.\n\nThe move escalates trade tensions with the U.S.’s three largest trading partners. China, in response, announced Tuesday it would impose additional tariffs of up to 15% on imports of key U.S. farm products, including chicken, pork, soy and beef, and also expanded controls on doing business with key U.S. companies.\n\nTrump has framed the tariffs as an effort to curb illegal immigration and drug trafficking, particularly fentanyl, while also aiming to rebalance trade and bring more manufacturing back to the U.S. However, the decision has sparked renewed concerns over rising inflation and disruptions to supply chains.\n\nThe United States conducted $2.2 trillion in trade with Mexico, Canada, and China last year, and businesses fear that the new tariffs will push up costs for American consumers while triggering countermeasures that could further disrupt global markets.\n\nImpact on the auto industry\n\nBy the numbers:\n\nThe auto industry is expected to be among the hardest hit, as manufacturers rely on cross-border supply chains between the U.S., Canada, and Mexico.\n\nIn 2024, the U.S. imported:\n\n$79 billion in vehicles from Mexico, the top supplier.\n\n$31 billion in vehicles from Canada.\n\n$81 billion in auto parts from Mexico and $19 billion from Canada.\n\nWith the new tariffs in place, car prices are expected to rise. Analysts at S&P Global Mobility estimate that the tariffs could increase the price of a new car by $3,000, at a time when car costs are already at record highs.\n\nScott Lincicome, a trade analyst at the libertarian Cato Institute, warned that the tariffs will disrupt production, saying, \"You throw 25% tariffs into all that, and it’s just a grenade.\"\n\nChina, another key player in the auto supply chain, exported $18 billion in auto parts to the U.S. last year. With tariffs on Chinese goods now doubled, further cost increases are expected.\n\nFILE - U.S. President Donald Trump speaks at a joint press conference with French President Emmanuel Macron not in the picture at the White House in Washington, D.C., on Feb. 24, 2025. U.S. President Donald Trump said that tariffs on Mexico and Canad Expand\n\nHigher prices at the pump, in stores, and on tech\n\nBeyond the auto industry, tariffs will impact a range of essential goods, from energy to food to electronics.\n\nEnergy: Canada is the U.S.'s largest foreign supplier of crude oil, shipping $98 billion worth of crude to the U.S. last year. With oil and natural gas now subject to a 10% tariff, gas prices in the Midwest and Northeast could rise.\n\nFood: Mexico supplies nearly half of U.S. imported vegetables and 40% of fruits, including 90% of avocados. Grocery prices could climb further, adding to consumer frustration over inflation.\n\nTechnology & retail: China remains a top source for cell phones, computers, and electronics. The increased tariffs on Chinese imports could drive up costs on these everyday items.\n\nTrade partners threaten retaliation\n\nThe other side:\n\nBoth Canada and Mexico have promised countermeasures in response to the tariffs.\n\nCanadian Foreign Minister Mélanie Joly said the country is ready with $155 billion in retaliatory tariffs, including an initial $30 billion set to take effect soon.\n\nMexican President Claudia Sheinbaum has not yet detailed specific countermeasures but said Mexico is prepared to respond. Mexico had already stationed 10,000 National Guard troops at the border to crack down on smuggling and illegal immigration in an attempt to address U.S. concerns.\n\nThe tariffs announced by China are due to take effect on March 10, though goods already in transit will be exempt until April 12. Imports of U.S. grown chicken, wheat, corn and cotton will face an extra 15% tariff, a notice by the ministry said. Tariffs on sorghum, soybeans, pork, beef, seafoods, fruit, vegetables and dairy products will be increased by 10%.\n\nAlso on Tuesday, Beijing placed 10 more U.S. firms on its unreliable entity list, which would bar them from engaging in China-related import or export activities and from making new investments in the country. Some already likely face restrictions on trade with China if their products can be used for both military and civilian purposes.\n\nThe firms listed are TCOM, Limited Partnership, Stick Rudder Enterprises LLC, Teledyne Brown Engineering, Huntington Ingalls Industries, S3 AeroDefense, Cubic Corporation, TextOre, ACT1 Federal, Exovera and Planate Management Group.\n\nSeparately, China added 15 U.S. companies to its export control list, including aerospace and defense companies like General Dynamics Land Systems and General Atomics Aeronautical Systems, among others.",

        "content": "The Brief An injured fox named Bingo is currently stuck in a piece of plastic. Police are attempting to safely capture the fox for treatment. Concern is growing for the fox, who police say may be pregnant.\n\n\n\nPolice in Washington Township are asking for the public's help to find and catch a fox they say needs their help.\n\nWhat we know:\n\n\"Bingo,\" an injured and possibly pregnant fox, has been seen wandering around the Washington Township Police Station and Senior Center.\n\nPolice say its leg is trapped in a piece of plastic vent that is struck around her neck.\n\nShe is also suffering from mange.\n\nThe founder of An Itch in Time Mangy Fox Rescue says he got a call about the fox hanging around the Washington Township Senior Center in Sewell, New Jersey.\n\nThey’ve set up traps, but the fox literally won’t bite. It is believed that residents are feeding feral cats or leaving out food for the fox, so it isn’t desperate to risk getting trapped going into one for bait food.\n\nRescuers believe the fox is pregnant are worried she'll pass mange, which is a skin disease caused by parasitic mites that burrow into the skin on to her babies, which could kill them and her if not treated.\n\nThe infection has progressed so much that her tail barely has hair on it. It is also believed that the fox got the plastic on itself while possibly looking for food.\n\nWhat they're saying:\n\nPolice say concern continues to grow as they attempt to safely capture her for treatment.\n\nResidents are being urged not to feed the fox, but to contact them if you spot her in your area.\n\n\"They were like there's a fox here with a pipe on its neck, its arm stuck and she is looking kind of raggedy,\" said Luke Ogden about the call he received from the senior center. He’s the founder of An Itch in Time Mangy Fox Rescue.\n\n\"Basking in the sun and there was several den holes that she dug,\" said Ogden about the fox. He and some volunteers began actively working to trap it for treatment.\n\n\"She saw us and ran every bit of 25 miles an hour on three legs,\" he said. \"She visits basically every single night and goes right to the front of the traps. But she's just not food driven enough to risk getting caught for that food,\" said Ogden who believes people are feeding feral cats or leaving out food or bingo which is why she isn't desperate enough to enter a trap for food. Time is critical.\n\n\"She's looking pregnant so we're thinking cause foxes predominantly breed in January and their gestation is about 53 days so she's going to be giving birth in March,\" he said.\n\n\"We have a cat rescue that's going to be going tonight with a drop trap,\" said Ogden about a new type of trap than what they previously used.\n\nWhat's next:\n\nWashington Township Police shared the efforts on FaceBook asking residents not to feed Bingo the Fox which Odgen says is more of an issue than Bingo being dangerous.\n\n\"Generally red fox are curious creatures more like dogs. They don't want anything to do with humans, your pets or your cats,\" he said.\n\nHe hopes they catch the fox in time to take it to a rehabilitation center for treatment so that hopefully she and the babies can be released back into the wild.",

        "source": "https://www.fox29.com/",
        "content": "article\n\nThe Brief Target faces \"meaningful … profit pressure\" to start 2025 due to tariffs and other costs. Donald Trump's long-threatened tariffs against Canada and Mexico went into effect Tuesday, and the countries are expected to retaliate with their own taxes against the U.S. Overall in 2025, Target expects to see net sales growth of around 1%.\n\n\n\nTarget says there will be \"meaningful year-over-year profit pressure\" in 2025 because of tariffs and other costs.\n\nImpact of tariffs on Target\n\nWhat they're saying:\n\nTarget, in its fourth quarter earnings report released on Tuesday, said it beat expectations for its fourth-quarter profits but revenue did fall to $30.91 billion, from $31.9 billion. The company says its total comparable sales increased 1.5% in the fourth quarter, with store sales declining 0.5% and digital sales increasing 8.7%.\n\nThe earnings report comes amid retailer uncertainty as Americans limit their spending, especially on discretionary items that Target is known for, such as clothing and electronics, The Associated Press notes.\n\nLooking ahead, Target said in its report, \"In light of ongoing consumer uncertainty and a small decline in February net sales, combined with tariff uncertainty and the expected timing of certain costs within the fiscal year, the company expects to see meaningful year-over-year profit pressure in its first quarter relative to the remainder of the year.\"\n\nHowever, Target expects to see net sales growth of around 1% this year, a modest increase in their operating margin rate, and an effective tax rate of 23 to 24%.\n\n\"During February, we saw record performance around Valentines Day. However, our topline performance for the month was soft, as uncharacteristically cold weather across the U.S. affected apparel sales, and declining consumer confidence impacted our discretionary assortment overall,\" said Jim Lee, chief financial officer. \"Looking ahead, we expect to see a moderation in this trend as apparel sales respond to warmer weather around the country, and consumers turn to Target for upcoming seasonal moments such as the Easter holiday. We will continue to monitor these trends and will remain appropriately cautious with our expectations for the year ahead.\"\n\nTrump's tariffs go into effect: What you need to know\n\nBig picture view:\n\nPresident Donald Trump has been threatening tariffs against Canada and Mexico, and they go into effect on Tuesday. The U.S. will impose 25% tariffs on imports from both countries, except it will tax Canadian energy products at a 10% rate.\n\nThe move escalates trade tensions with the U.S.’s three largest trading partners. China, in response, announced Tuesday it would impose additional tariffs of up to 15% on imports of key U.S. farm products, including chicken, pork, soy and beef, and also expanded controls on doing business with key U.S. companies. Meanwhile, both Canada and Mexico have promised countermeasures in response to the tariffs.\n\nTrump has framed the tariffs as an effort to curb illegal immigration and drug trafficking, particularly fentanyl, while also aiming to rebalance trade and bring more manufacturing back to the U.S. However, the decision has sparked renewed concerns over rising inflation and disruptions to supply chains.\n\nThe United States conducted $2.2 trillion in trade with Mexico, Canada, and China last year, and businesses fear that the new tariffs will push up costs for American consumers while triggering countermeasures that could further disrupt global markets.\n\nThe tariffs are expected to have an impact on the auto industry, and could lead to higher prices at the pump, in grocery stores and on tech.\n\nEnergy: Canada is the U.S.'s largest foreign supplier of crude oil, shipping $98 billion worth of crude to the U.S. last year. With oil and natural gas now subject to a 10% tariff, gas prices in the Midwest and Northeast could rise.\n\nFood: Mexico supplies nearly half of U.S. imported vegetables and 40% of fruits, including 90% of avocados. Grocery prices could climb further, adding to consumer frustration over inflation.\n\nTechnology & retail: China remains a top source for cell phones, computers, and electronics. The increased tariffs on Chinese imports could drive up costs on these everyday items.",

        "content": "The Brief All it took was 90 seconds for White House diplomacy to unwind in extraordinary fashion. President Trump’s thrashing of Ukraine’s Volodymyr Zelenskyy leaves the future of the U.S.-Ukraine relationship in mortal jeopardy.\n\n\n\nA shouting match that unfolded in the final minutes of a meeting between President Donald Trump and Ukraine President Volodymur Zelenskyy has destroyed – at least for now – hopes that the U.S. will be a reliable partner in helping to end Russia’s three-year invasion.\n\nAll it took was 90 seconds for weeks of tortured diplomacy to unwind in spectacular fashion.\n\nIt also stressed the profound ways Trump feels emboldened to redirect U.S. foreign policy priorities toward his \"America First\" agenda in ways that extend well beyond those of his tumultuous first term.\n\nWhat happened at the meeting?\n\nThe backstory:\n\nIt started off cordially enough, as Trump and Zelenskyy spoke politely, even with admiration, of one another for the first half-hour of the meeting. Trump even suggested he would continue some military assistance to Ukraine until he could secure an enduring peace deal with Russia.\n\nBut when the Ukrainian leader raised alarm about trusting any promises from Russia’s Vladimir Putin to end the fighting, Vice President JD Vance rebuked him for airing disagreements with Trump in public. It instantly shifted the tenor of the conversation. Zelenskyy grew defensive, and Trump and his vice president blasted him as ungrateful and \"disrespectful\" and issued stark warnings about future American support.\n\nRELATED: Zelenskyy on FOX: ‘Spat’ during Oval Office meeting ‘not good for both sides’\n\n\"What kind of diplomacy, JD, you are speaking about?\" Zelenskyy said, listing Russia’s past violations of ceasefires. \"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"I’m talking about the kind of diplomacy that’s going to end the destruction of your country,\" Vance responded before tearing into the Ukrainian leader. \"Mr. President, with respect, I think it’s disrespectful for you to come into the Oval Office to try to litigate this in front of the American media.\"\n\nTrump then let loose, warning the Ukrainian leader, \"You’re gambling with World War III, and what you’re doing is very disrespectful to the country, this country that’s backed you far more than a lot of people say they should have.\"\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump shouts at Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in the Oval Office at the White House on February 28, 2025 in Washington, DC. (Photo by Andrew Harnik/Getty Images)\n\nAt another point, Trump declared himself \"in the middle,\" seeming to formally break from years of American support for Ukraine. He went on to deride Zelenskyy’s \"hatred\" for Putin as a roadblock to peace.\n\n\"You see the hatred he’s got for Putin,\" Trump said. \"That’s very tough for me to make a deal with that kind of hate.\"\n\n\"It’s going to be a very hard thing to do business like this,\" Trump said to Zelenskyy as the two leaders talked over each other.\n\nRELATED: Trump-Zelenskyy meeting gets heated: 'Gambling with World War III'\n\nSources close to Zelenskyy told Fox News Digital that tempers had flared even before the event began. The Ukrainian president was apparently presented with a minerals for security agreement by the Trump administration prior to the press event, but the deal included no security guarantees to protect Ukraine from another Russian invasion.\n\nZelenskyy had warned repeatedly ahead of his trip to Washington, D.C., that, in order to reach a mineral agreement, Kyiv needed these security assurances. Even so, he angered Trump and Vance by rejecting the deal, the source said.\n\nWhat’s next for Ukraine?\n\nBig picture view:\n\nThe encounter left the future of the U.S.-Ukraine relationship, and Kyiv’s ability to defend itself in the brutal conflict with Russia, in mortal jeopardy.\n\nWhat's next:\n\nZelenskyy was in London Saturday to meet with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer before a summit Sunday of European leaders.\n\nRELATED: Ukraine's Zelenskyy says he'll step down in exchange for NATO membership\n\nThe summit on Sunday will also include leaders from France, Germany, Denmark, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Spain, Turkey, Finland, Sweden, Czechia and Romania, as well as the NATO secretary-general and the presidents of the European Commission and European Council.\n\nWhat did Trump say after the meeting?\n\nWhat they're saying:\n\n\"It didn’t work out exactly great, from his standpoint,\" Trump told reporters outside the White House. \"I think he very much overplayed his hand. We’re looking for peace. We’re not looking for somebody that’s gonna sign up a strong power, and then not make peace because they feel emboldened, and that’s what I saw happening … We’re not looking to go into a 10-year war and play games. We want peace. It was just my impression … that he’s looking for something that I’m not looking for, he’s looking to go on and fight, fight, fight.\"\n\nWhat did Zelenskyy say after the meeting?\n\nWhat they're saying:\n\nZelenskyy used a series of posts on X to express his thanks to the American people, Trump and Congress for \"all the support,\" which he said Ukrainians \"have always appreciated,\" especially during the war.\n\n\"Our relationship with the American President is more than just two leaders; it’s a historic and solid bond between our peoples. That’s why I always begin with words of gratitude from our nation to the American nation,\" he added. Ukrainians \"only strong relations with America, and I really hope we will have them,\" he said.\n\nWhat did Congress say after the meeting?\n\nWhat they're saying:\n\nCongressional Republicans were united in their praise of Trump following the meeting, while Democrats expressed horror at the unprecedented lack of diplomacy.\n\nSouth Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, called the meeting a \"complete, utter disaster\" and suggested U.S. support for Ukraine could end because of it. He also said Zelenskyy should consider resigning.\n\n\"Somebody asked me, am I embarrassed about Trump. I have never been more proud of the president. I was very proud of JD Vance standing up for our country. We want to be helpful. What I saw in the Oval Office was disrespectful, and I don't know if we can ever do business with Zelenskyy again,\" Graham, chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, said. \"The way he handled the meeting, the way he confronted the president, was just over the top.\"\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, posted on X that the \"days of America being taken advantage of and disrespected are OVER.\"\n\n\"What we witnessed in the Oval Office today was an American President putting America first,\" he said.\n\nDemocrats strongly criticized the exchange.\n\n\"Trump and Vance are doing Putin's dirty work,\" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said. \"Senate Democrats will never stop fighting for freedom and democracy.\"\n\n\"President Trump and his administration continue to embarrass America on the world stage,\" House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries said \"Today’s White House meeting with the President of Ukraine was appalling and will only serve to further embolden Vladimir Putin, a brutal dictator.\"\n\nWhat did other world leaders say after the meeting?\n\nWhat they're saying:\n\nGerman President Frank-Walter Steinmeier criticized Trump in unusually sharp terms for his behavior during the meeting with Zelenskyy at the Oval Office.\n\n\"Diplomacy fails when negotiating partners are humiliated in front of the whole world,\" Steinmeier told dpa, the German news agency, during a flight to Uruguay. \"The scene in the White House yesterday took my breath away. I would never have believed that we would one day have to protect Ukraine from the USA.\"\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron said if someone is gambling with World War III, it is not Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy but more likely his Russian counterpart.\n\nMacron reacted to Friday’s heated exchange between U.S. President Donald Trump and Zelenskyy in the Oval Office, during which Trump accused Zelenskyy of \"gambling with World War III.\"\n\n\"If anyone is gambling with World War III, his name is Vladimir Putin,\" Macron said.\n\n\"My hope is that the United States of America will continue to stand by its history and its principles,\" he said. \"Whenever we have had major conflicts, the United States of America has been on the right side of history and freedom.\"",

With just two months remaining until the May 7 federal REAL ID enforcement deadline, officials are helping people prepare.\n\n\n\nIt has been years since we heard about the need to get a REAL ID for any domestic flying in the U.S., but after multiple delays, the deadline is here.\n\nGovernment agencies say you have just over two months to get it.\n\nWhat we know:\n\nIn Pennsylvania, obtaining a REAL ID is optional. However, starting May 7, travelers will need a REAL ID-compliant driver’s license or ID card, or another form of federally-acceptable identification (such as a valid passport or military ID) to board a domestic commercial flight, and enter military bases and other federal facilities that require ID at the door.\n\nAnyone looking to travel will need a REAL ID-compliant license or a passport to board domestic flights and enter federal buildings.\n\n\"May 7, which is 64 days away, you will need a Real ID-compliant driver's license or REAL ID-compliant identification card to board a domestic flight,\" said Jana Tidwell, Manager of Public Affairs for PA and DE AAA.\n\nIf you have a valid passport, a REAL ID is optional, but officials say if you like the convenience of traveling with just a license, it might be worth it.\n\n\"Your passport is your golden ticket. If you have that, that will get you through TSA and onto your flight,\" Tidwell added.\n\nA passport is still needed for international travel.\n\nFederal REAL ID regulations require PennDOT to verify a list of documents.\n\nHow to prepare\n\nThe first thing to do to prepare for your REAL ID is to check and see if you need one.\n\nIn Pennsylvania, you do not need a REAL ID in order to drive, vote, access hospitals, visit the post office, access federal courts, or apply for/receive federal benefits such as social security or veterans' benefits.\n\nThe REAL ID online wizard may help you determine if a REAL ID is right for you.\n\nNext, you will want to get your documents together .\n\nPennDOT officials will have to verify original versions or certified copies of multiple documents.\n\nThose documents include proof of identity, proof of social security number, two proofs of current, physical Pennsylvania address and proof od all legal name changes (if applicable).\n\nSome non-U.S. citizens may be required to present additional documentation.\n\nLearn more about REAL ID documentation requirements and download a printable document checklist on PennDOT’s REAL ID Document Check page..\n\nWhat they're saying:\n\nOfficials say they want the message to reach people without passports and without REAL IDs who think they won't need to fly.\n\n\"As the weather starts getting warmer, we know many Pennsylvanians have made exciting travel plans,\" said PennDOT Secretary Mike Carroll. \"With federal REAL ID enforcement beginning on May 7, your travel planning should include making sure you have proper ID to fly. If you want to keep using your driver’s license or photo ID card to fly domestically, you’ll need to upgrade to a REAL ID if you haven’t already.\"\n\n\"I'm here to tell you that the day will come, maybe not tomorrow, maybe not today, but somewhere in the future, where they have to fly, and absent the REAL ID, when they show up at the PHL airport or any airport across the country, it's gonna be ugly,\" Tidwell warned.\n\n\"Many people feel that 'I don't fly, I don't fly at all, I'm not going to bother,' and they likely don't have a passport either. But we all know that life happens, and there will be circumstances—unfortunate family circumstances—where you need to fly, and it's not just an overnight fix to get that REAL ID if you need it in a hurry,\" she explained.\n\nWhen it comes to the travelers at Philadelphia International Airport today, their opinions were mixed.\n\n\"I'm not gonna get a REAL ID because I already have a passport, and I already paid, so I don't want to incur the additional expense,\" said Heidi Meyers.\n\n\"It's always so crowded at the DMV,\" Meyers added.\n\n\"I'm just gonna do it before May 7,\" said Ivan Juzang. \"It's just keeping things moving. It's all about actually trying to be in the shortest line,\" he noted.\n\nWhat's next:\n\nPennDOT is hosting a series of REAL ID Days at driver license centers across the commonwealth to help Pennsylvanians obtain a REAL ID before the enforcement deadline. REAL ID Days are held on Mondays when the centers are typically closed.\n\nFor more information on REAL ID, visit PennDOT’s REAL ID website.\n\nMore resources are available to obtain a REAL ID in New Jersey, Pennsylvania or Delaware.",

The victim's mother is looking to track down the Uber driver to thank him for his heroic actions.\n\n\n\nA rideshare driver is being called a hero because of his quick actions and calling 911 for his passenger.\n\nThat passenger, a 41-year-old man, is fighting for his life in the hospital. He was on the way to his job in an Uber when he suffered a medical emergency.\n\nNow, his family is working to track down the driver and thank them.\n\nWhat we know:\n\nOn February 25, 41-year-old Justin Anderson called an Uber to take him to his new job in Warminster.\n\nHis mother, Debbie, says he left Lebanon Avenue in Philadelphia around 7 a.m., and at some point during that ride, he suffered a brain hemorrhage.\n\nThe driver quickly pulled over, called 911, and an ambulance arrived within minutes.\n\nJustin Anderson remains in a coma at Abington Hospital, but his mother says she’s convinced he would not be alive today without the quick thinking of a man she calls a hero.\n\n\"It gives me a little bit more faith in humanity,\" said Debbie Anderson. \"I was so thankful because had he taken any time or not responded the way he did, Justin wouldn’t be here. I really believe that,\"\n\nDoctors told Debbie that most people with brain hemorrhages die, so every second mattered.\n\nThey said her son probably would not have survived without that Uber driver’s quick response.\n\nNow, she would love to personally thank him for saving her son’s life.\n\n\"It’s so important to get involved and not just disregard things. You don’t realize they’re so important, but they are, and he was quick-thinking in it, and I really think that has a big part of why Justin is still here right now,\" she said. \"I would hug him and thank him. I am so appreciative of what he did.\"\n\nWhat's next:\n\nFOX 29 reached out to Uber to help find the hero driver. A representative says they’re trying to track him down so Debbie can possibly meet him face to face.\n\nIf you know this Uber driver, please contact us!\n\nJustin has a long recovery ahead, so there’s a GoFundMe set up to help. If you’d like to donate.",

Irving also sings the national anthem ahead of Vancouver Canucks and Vancouver Whitecaps games.\n\nStar sports commentator Pat McAfee loudly lambasted the Canadian fans for booing, and the country as a whole, in response during the Peacock broadcast.\n\n\"It kind of sucks that it's in the terrible country of Canada that booed our national anthem to start this entire thing,\" McAfee shouted at the broadcast table.\n\nCredit: @KrisReports via Storyful\n\nToronto's booing of the anthem comes a week after hockey fans from both countries booed each other's anthems.\n\nDuring the NHL's 4 Nations Face-Off exhibition tournament from Feb. 12-20, fans in Canada booed the U.S. national anthem while fans in the U.S. booed the Canadian national anthem ahead of multiple games.\n\nIt started Feb. 13, when Canadian fans in Montreal booed the U.S. national anthem after President Donald Trump's recent threats to impose tariffs on Canada while also suggesting the country should become America's 51st state.\n\nThe booing prompted a flurry of brawls between Canadian and U.S. players in the first meeting of the tournament between the two teams Feb. 15. The U.S. won that game 3-1.\n\nNHL STAR DISHES ON TEAM USA PLAYERS' AMERICAN PRIDE: 'HAVEN'T SEEN THAT FROM AMERICANS IN GENERAL'\n\nThe Canadian national anthem was then booed at TD Garden in Boston before a 4 Nations game between Canada and Finland.\n\nThe U.S. and Canada then met in the final Feb. 20, and American fans in Boston once again booed the Canadian national anthem, albeit with a lighter tone. Canada won the game in overtime, 3-2.\n\nSince then, hostile rhetoric between the two countries, including in sports, has only escalated.\n\nCanadian men’s soccer coach Jesse Marsch blasted Trump for his \"51st state\" remarks, calling them \"insulting\" Wednesday.\n\nDuring CONCACAF Nations League media day Wednesday, Marsch didn’t hold back his opinion on Trump’s comments, saying he was \"ashamed\" of how Canada was insulted by the president.\n\n\"If I have one message to our president, it’s lay off the ridiculous rhetoric about Canada being the 51st state,\" Marsch said. \"As an American, I’m ashamed of the arrogance and disregard we’ve shown one of our historically oldest, strongest and most loyal allies. But one thing’s for sure, when I look forward a month from now, this will fuel our team. The mentality we have, the will we have to play for our country.\"\n\nNHL legend Wayne Gretzky has also been criticized by fellow Canadians for his apparent support of Trump.\n\nTrump recently said he asked Gretzky to become the next \"governor of Canada\" after Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced he would be resigning.\n\nBut after Gretzky expressed support for \"Canada remaining a separate Country, rather than becoming a cherished and beautiful 51st State,\" Trump declared Gretzky a \"free agent.\"\n\nThat prompted hockey legend Bobby Orr, a fellow Canadian, to write in the Toronto Sun that he was disappointed to read criticism about Gretzky, someone he considers one of the \"greatest Canadians ever.\"\n\n\"How fickle can people be, when someone who has given so much time and effort to Canadian hockey is treated in such a way,\" Orr wrote. \"Listen, we all have our personal beliefs as they pertain to things such as religion and politics. Wayne respects your right to such beliefs – why can’t you respect his?\"\n\nJanet Gretzky, Wayne's wife, read Orr's column, and she reacted on social media.\n\n\"Thank you Mr. Bobby Orr. Your words mean the world to Wayne and his family , i have never met anyone who is more Proud to be a Canadian and it has broken his heart to read and see the mean comments. He would do anything to make Canadians Proud , with his Love for Hockey and his Country,\" Janet wrote in an Instagram post in which she shared Orr's column.\n\nTrump agreed Feb. 3 to pause tariffs for 30 days, which means they’re expected to be imposed in early March. The tariffs imposed on Canada by Trump are a response to drug trafficking at the U.S.-Canadian border.\n\nRead more from FOX News Digital",

All parades are supposed to be off the street by 11:30 a.m. Police are warning that they may cancel the parades if conditions warrant.\n\nThe National Weather Service has issued a High Wind Watch for the entire southern coast of Louisiana. Forecasters said they expect winds between 30 and 40 mph starting on Tuesday morning, with gusts of up to 60 mph possible.\n\nNew Orleans is also within a Level 3 out of 5 severe weather threat, which includes risks of damaging winds, hail, and even tornadoes.\n\nThe New Orleans Police Department said on Monday afternoon that if wind gusts are higher than forecast and create unsafe conditions, Mardi Gras parades will be canceled.\n\nThe 2025 Krewe of Bacchus parade takes place during Mardi Gras 2025 on March 2, 2025, in New Orleans, Louisiana. (Photo by Erika Goldring/Getty Images)\n\nMeanwhile, officials in Jefferson Parish, Louisiana , announced Monday that Mardi Gras celebrations on Tuesday have been canceled due to a high wind threat.\n\n\"The timing of these winds also did not allow us to consider moving to an earlier parade time, as we were told that the winds are expected early in the morning as well,\" Sheng said. \"So, let me state the obvious. These are not conditions where we would invite family, including the elderly and children, to stand on our streets, out in the open. These are not conditions for people to be elevated on floats. God forbid having a float tip over, and there's people on the street just under those floats.\"\n\nSheng also said the strong winds could cause debris to fly through the air, raising safety concerns.\n\nDOWNLOAD THE FREE FOX WEATHER APP\n\nThis graphic shows the wind alerts in effect along the Gulf Coast.(FOX Weather)\n\n\"So I’m just going to cut to the chase with the very disappointing news that I think you all have probably heard about already,\" Jefferson Parish President Cynthia Lee Sheng said at the news conference Monday. \"We’ve been in communication with the National Weather Service, and tomorrow’s weather, especially the gusty winds, is severe enough that we have no other choice but other than to cancel our scheduled parades for tomorrow.\"\n\nThis includes the Krewe of Argus parade and the Elks Krewe of Jeffersonians, Sheng said.\n\nTuesday's weather forecast.(FOX Weather)\n\nThe NWS’s New Orleans office has created a special web page dedicated to Mardi Gras weather updates , and forecasters expected the most significant chance of rain to occur between 6 p.m. Tuesday and 6 a.m. Wednesday.\n\nFortunately, the timing will allow most Mardi Gras festivities to conclude before rainy weather moves in.\n\nWhile about a third of all Mardi Gras events typically see rainfall, locals don't recall a single instance of Fat Tuesday being postponed or canceled due to weather. Climatological data showed that the rainiest Mardi Gras happened March 1, 1927, when 2.12 inches of precipitation fell.\n\n2025 ATLANTIC HURRICANE SEASON GUIDE: HERE’S WHAT TO KNOW ABOUT THE TROPICS THIS YEAR\n\nMardi Gras weather extremes.

This means that the worst of the weather will likely have passed the New Orleans metro area by the time services begin.\n\nOnce the cold front moves through, Wednesday is expected to turn pleasant, with highs around 70 degrees and plenty of sunshine .\n\nGet updates to this story on FOXWeather.com.",

Mexico and Canada face 25% tariffs starting Tuesday, with a 10% rate on Canadian energy. Stock market dips 2% amid concerns over inflation and trade retaliation.\n\n\n\nPresident Donald Trump has officially doubled tariffs on Chinese imports to 20% and confirmed that 25% tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada will take effect Tuesday.\n\nThe move, which Trump says is aimed at curbing fentanyl trafficking and illegal immigration, has renewed fears of a trade war with America’s top three trading partners.\n\nRELATED: Trump: 25 percent tariffs on imports from Mexico, Canada to start Tuesday\n\nThe U.S. conducted nearly $2.2 trillion in trade with Mexico, Canada, and China last year, and businesses are bracing for higher prices and possible retaliation. Canadian Foreign Minister Mélanie Joly has already announced.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump speaks during a Cabinet meeting at the White House on February 26, 2025 in Washington, DC. (Photo by Andrew Harnik/Getty Images)\n\nWhat to expect from the new tariffs\n\nThe backstory:\n\nThe latest tariffs mark the most aggressive trade measures of Trump’s presidency, with major implications across multiple industries.\n\nTrump first imposed a 10% tariff on Chinese imports in February but doubled the rate after what he described as China’s failure to stop fentanyl trafficking into the U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent defended the move, telling CBS News that China would \"eat\" the cost of the tariffs rather than passing them on to American consumers.\n\nHowever, analysts warn that companies like Ford and Walmart could see major cost increases, potentially raising prices on everyday goods.\n\nMexico and Canada face 25% tariffs\n\nWhat's next:\n\nTrump had previously granted Mexico and Canada a one-month delay on tariffs while both nations pledged efforts to crack down on drug smuggling and illegal immigration.\n\nHowever, he declared Monday that \"there’s no room left\" for negotiations. Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum has signaled that her country is prepared to respond, while Canada is imposing counter-tariffs and continuing diplomatic efforts.\n\nThe new duties will also impact key energy imports from Canada, including oil, natural gas, and electricity, which will be taxed at a reduced 10% rate. This is expected to raise fuel costs in the U.S., particularly in the Northeast and Midwest.\n\nHow businesses and consumers could be impacted\n\nWhy you should care:\n\nCompanies ranging from auto manufacturers to grocery chains have warned of price hikes resulting from the tariffs.\n\nThe Peterson Institute for International Economics estimates that American families could face an average cost increase of over $1,000 per year due to higher import prices.\n\nS&P Global Mobility has also projected that tariffs on auto imports from Mexico and Canada could raise new car prices by $3,000 on average, further straining an already expensive auto market.",

The case of measles was diagnosed with a baby girl who was \"too young\" to be vaccinated and recently returned home from an overseas trip.\n\n\n\nMontgomery County Health officials spent most of Monday doing contract tracing of people who may have been exposed to the measles.\n\nThey tell FOX 29 that CHOP clinicians in King of Prussia identified symptoms and alerted health officials.\n\nWhat we know:\n\n\"It’s a detective game. Basically we are trying to figure out who went where and where they went at the time\" said Dr. Richard Lorraine, Medical Director for the Montgomery County Office of Public Health.\n\nOfficials say a baby girl who was too young to be vaccinated contracted the measles virus after a trip abroad.\n\nThe CDC recommends children receive their first measles vaccine at 12–15 months old.\n\nThey say it’s a much different circumstance than the outbreak in West Texas and New Mexico where nearly 200 people now have the virus.\n\nMany of the cases originated in a largely unvaccinated Mennonite community.\n\n\"In that area there’s a lot of spread of measles among a community of unvaccinated individuals. What we have here in Montgomery county is a single case of a very young child who was traveling abroad with her parents and she was too young to have had the vaccine for measles. She was exposed and now she is positive for measles\" said Lorraine.\n\nRelated article\n\nOfficials are warning those potential exposure areas including a China Airlines shuttle bus from JFK airport arriving at the Pho Ha Saigon Restaurant on 575 Adams Avenue February 25th into February 26th..\n\nLater on February 26th at the True North Pediatrics Associates of Plymouth in Plymouth Meeting from 11:45AM to 2:15PM.\n\nAgain several hours later at the CHOP Emergency Department in King of Prussia from about 1PM-3pm.\n\n\"What we are doing is trying to identify those exposure points but even then those people who were exposed have a pretty good likelihood of being immune to measles\" said Lorraine.\n\nAs of Monday, only a single case has been reported.\n\nMeasles can cause a severe rash, fever and other symptoms can remain in the air and on surfaces for up to two hours. An estimated 92-percent of the population has already vaccinated against the virus..\n\nWhat you can do:\n\nIf you think you may have been exposed to measles:\n\nCheck your immunization records to see if you are protected against measles.\n\nTalk to your healthcare provider about the MMR vaccines.\n\nMonitor yourself for symptoms.\n\nWhat they're saying:\n\n\"I don’t want my son to have it. Or ever get it.. ha ha. That’s something I woujldn’ expect to happen nowadays\" said Courtney Robinson of King of Prussia who says her son recently received the MMR vaccine.\n\n\"Thankfully, my daughter is vaccinated. I mean that’s what vaccines are for\" added King of Prussia mom Alex Fayfar.",

Johnson is 81 years old.\n\n\n\nFormer Dallas Cowboys head coach Jimmy Johnson has retired from his commentator job on FOX NFL Sunday.\n\nJohnson made the announcement on an episode of The Herd on FS1 on Monday.\n\nJimmy Johnson retires from FOX\n\n\"I've made an extremely difficult decision,\" said Johnson. \"I've been thinking about it for the last 4 or 5 years and I've decided to retire from FOX. I'm going to miss it. I'm going to miss all of the guys.\"\n\nJohnson, 81, called the job the \"most fun\" he had in his career.\n\nThe announcement did not come as a surprise. Ahead of the Super Bowl, FOX aired a tribute to Johnson's career.\n\nWhen asked about retirement at the time, the former Cowboys coach would not say one way or the other.\n\nJohnson first appeared on FOX 31 years ago. He worked with the network from 1994-1995 after leaving the Cowboys and then rejoined FOX from 2002-2024 after coaching the Miami Dolphins.\n\n\"I loved every minute of it,\" Johnson said. \"Thanks to FOX Sports. It was really the best time of my entire career.\"\n\nWhat they're saying:\n\n\"Jimmy served as an inspiration to generations of football fans with his legendary swagger, one-of-a-kind insight and signature humor. From his motivating pep talks to his unmatched energy over the years, he was our coach who always pushed us to be better,\" said FOX Sports CEO and Executive Producer Eric Shanks in a statement. \"Coach will be sincerely missed and we wish him the best as he sets sail into retirement, like only Jimmy Johnson can.\"",

It comes with everything,\" Ramirez said.\n\nFounded by Fran Wasserman in 2011 as just small stacks of donations to serve underserved communities and at-risk babies, now the organization has grown to fill multiple rooms with goods to last a child up to a year.\n\nMost of their bundles are distributed through social workers, local organizations, and churches like Willow Grove Baptist Church, where Ramirez met food pantry director Rick Beyerle.\n\nKelly works part time as a waitress and takes care of her five children and two that she adopted. She would visit the pantry Beyerle oversees.\n\n\"Since we started it's been pretty much 50 families a year,\" Beyerle said.\n\nThat's 50 more families every year, and with inflation going up, so is the number of people in need.\n\nRamirez, a busy mother, said she's grateful for the help of the church and The Baby Bureau, where their bundles aren't charity, they're gifts.\n\n\"If you are scared, if you are embarrassed, you don't want to ask for help, you can,\" Ramirez said.\n\nTo donate gently used baby clothes, you can visit The Baby Bureau.",

Opened in 1916, it was one of the only courses in the area to allow all races, ethnicities and genders to play.\n\n\"It really has great history,\" said Enrique Hervada, who is the CEO of the Cobbs Creek Foundation.\n\nIn recent years, the Cobbs Creek Foundation took over and raised more than $100 million dollars to rebuild the course. Eventually, there will be a state-of-the-art two-story driving range with a restaurant and an 18-hole course capable of hosting PGA events.\n\nIn addition, there's a 9-hole short course that is nearly complete.\n\nBut the centerpiece of the project is the TGR Learning Lab, which is being built with the help of Tiger Woods — one of the greatest golfers of all time.\n\n\"We partnered with Tiger Woods and his foundation,\" Hervada said. \"He has a TGR Learning Lab in Anaheim, California, for about 20 years. This will be the second one.\"\n\nSo how exactly did Cobbs Creek get Woods to expand his TGR Foundation to Philadelphia?\n\n\"There was a very special golfer who got his start here and he was the first Black PGA winner named Charlie Sifford,\" Meredith Foote, the executive director of the TGR Learning Lab, said. \"Charlie Sifford was friends with Tiger Woods' father, Earl, and mentored him and became a father to him in his adulthood. And when Tiger had his second child, he named him Charlie after Charlie Sifford.\"\n\nOnce it opens, the TGR Learning Lab will focus on STEAM, educational enrichment, career and college readiness, and health and well-being. But it'll be open, for free, to the community for so much more.\n\n\"After school, summer, weekends, at night to explore an array of things ranging from podcasting, how to fly a drone,\" she said. \"You name it, we have it here. And we want kids to feel like this is a home away from home.\"\n\nAnd to the people working at TGR and living in the West Philly community it will serve, it means everything.\n\n\"I want be a doctor when I grow up,\" Fatima Choudhry, a TGR Learning Lab intern, said. \"It's really, really awesome how there's courses here specifically tailored to science and engineering and math and arts and technology and all that, and it's just really cool to get that hands-on experience.\"",

The road hasn't been as easy for Miller, but he's been able to adjust and move up levels in the organization due to Crawford's tutelage.\n\nThe two have risen through the organization together, and Crawford has helped Miller throughout his journey.\n\n\"Ever since I signed here, every little question I have or concern, he's answered it and helped me out,\" Miller said. \"Even when I was struggling up in Jersey (High-A Jersey Shore), he was the first guy to really try and help me out. He eased my mind a little bit. I owe a lot to him for that.\"\n\nLAKELAND, FLORIDA - MARCH 16, 2024: Aidan Miller #21 of the Philadelphia Phillies bats during the first inning of a spring training Spring Breakout game against the Detroit Tigers at Publix Field at Joker Marchant Stadium on March 16, 2024 in Lakeland, Florida. George Kubas/Diamond Images via Getty Images\n\nMiller was promoted to Jersey Shore last June, but the 2023 first-round pick wasn't hitting like a player of that pedigree. Miller was struggling to hit above .200, even having an average of .189 after August 1. He wasn't being written off, but there were questions about whether Miller would get out of his slump.\n\nIf it wasn't for Crawford, who knows how his 2024 season would fare?\n\n\"The biggest thing he's helped me with is the mental side of the game,\" Miller said. \"He was kind of there for the whole thing and the whole process. You just ask him questions on how to get through it and things I could do to improve my game, he was always there.\"\n\nWhile Crawford was changing the season for Double-A Reading with his bat, he was helping Miller through his struggles 120 miles up the road. Since that low point of .189 for Miller, he hit .299 in August with three home runs and 16 RBI. Miller also had an OPS of .906, which he carried over into September with a five-hit performance.\n\nThat led to a call-up to Double-A Reading for the final week of the season, where Miller and Crawford were reunited once again. Both Miller and Crawford are expected to begin the season in Double-A Reading, hitting 1-2 in the Fightin Phils' lineup.\n\nCrawford leadoff and Miller second.\n\nSEATTLE, WA - JULY 08: Justin Crawford #13 of the Philadelphia Phillies looks on during batting practice prior to the SiriusXM All-Star Futures Game at T-Mobile Park on Saturday, July 8, 2023 in Seattle, Washington.

He's fun to just go to work with every day,\" Crawford said. \"It's been really cool just to have the opportunity to go through the minors with him. He's someone that works extremely hard and brings a good attitude every day.\"\n\n\"It's definitely a lot of fun having him hit behind me and being able to hit behind him and see him at short.\"\n\nThe top two hitting prospects in the Phillies system, Miller and Crawford are rising through the ranks together. Crawford the big bro and Miller the little bro.\n\nBoth could be in the Phillies lineup by 2026 at the rate they are hitting.\n\n\"It's so cool to have another guy you're moving up with,\" Miller said. It's a lot of fun....It's been really cool to enjoy this experience with him.\"",

The win was No. 800 for coach Bill Fennelly, third-most in women's basketball among active coaches.\n\nCrooks, named to The Associated Press All-America third team released Wednesday, dominated the paint where the Cyclones outscored the Tigers 46-28, making 12 of 21 shots.

It's one of many that often go viral in hopes of warning people about a dangerous trend.\n\nCBS Philadelphia\n\n\"It can be quite serious depending on the volume of the glue that gets into the eye,\" Dr. Julia Haller, ophthalmologist-in-chief at Wills Eye Hospital, said. \"These glues unfortunately harden in a matter of seconds.\"\n\nHaller says it's a common problem that is treated in the emergency department.\n\n\"What we're seeing is that the lids are stuck together. So we have to very gently break down that adhesion, pry the lids apart and piece by piece very meticulously take out tiny little pieces of that solid adhesion,\" Haller said.\n\nHaller says eye drops are often in bottles similar in size to other products dangerous to the eye.\n\nCBS Philadelphia\n\n\"It can cause a chemical burn in addition to the adhesions. And so in addition to chipping away those adhesions where there's some loss of lash and skin, there can be a chemical burn to the surface of the eye and damage to the cornea,\" Haller said.\n\nThis mistake often happens when people are distracted or unable to see well. They may confuse eye drops with eyelash glue, nail glue, or even ear drops.\n\n\"What we are seeing in the emergency room is unfortunately even parents who mistakenly put the wrong drop in their children's eyes,\" Haller said.\n\nTo avoid this, people are encouraged to read the labels out loud before using them and to store the bottles in different locations.\n\n\"In some way labeling it so that even in a rush, it's easier to identify what drop you're putting in,\" Haller said.\n\nDoctors say that if this happens, people should immediately use water to flush out the glue. They also say to get it out of your eye as fast as possible, check with their doctor, or go to an urgent care center.",

While it won't offer the full services of a traditional hospital, officials say it will offer primary care, dietary, bariatric and other services.\n\n\"ChristianaCare is actively exploring site locations for our second neighborhood hospital in Delaware County, Pennsylvania,\" ChristianaCare Spokesperson William Schmitt said. \"Springfield is among the locations we are considering.\"\n\nSpringfield Township Solicitor Jim Byrne said the plans have drawn opposition from some residents.\n\n\"We had the planning commission hearing which was well attended,'\" Byrne said. \"There are people on both sides of the issue. Some people like the idea of the hospital, some people hate it.\"\n\nSome people in Springfield Township are worried the project is being built too close to homes and could create ambulance noise. Others complained that a micro-hospital could worsen traffic and stormwater runoff.\n\nThis comes at a time when Crozer Chester Medical Center in Chester and Taylor Hospital in Ridley Park are at risk of shutting down because of financial problems.\n\nKaren Keyser, who grew up and lives in Aston, said she is on board with ChristianaCare's project.\n\n\"I think it's a great idea,\" Keyser said. \"We need something here. If Crozer and Taylor are going to close in the future, we need something close, especially an emergency department.\"\n\nBut DeFeo said if Crozer's health system shuts down, the micro-hospital in Aston won't be able to fill the gap.\n\n\"The new micro-hospital that Christiana's is going to provide is going to be a 20-bed hospital, as compared to maybe 180-bed hospital, similar to what Riddle Hospital does and what Crozer Hospital does,\" DeFeo said.\n\nConstruction of the Aston medical campus is expected to be completed in 18 months to two years.",

Health officials say the risk to the public remains low.\n\nThis is the third confirmed case of bird flu in the city this year. The first was in a goose found in West Philadelphia, and two — including the newest one confirmed on Friday — have been in live bird markets that are now closed.\n\nBird flu has been spreading from wild birds to commercial chicken and cattle farms.\n\n\"We do have a number of live markets in Philadelphia — and have for many, many years — where people can go in and select a particular bird or type of bird for custom slaughter,\" said Dr. Aliza Simeone, an infectious disease specialist at Penn Vet.\n\nHealth officials say bird flu is mainly spread by live infected animals and the risk with dead birds is much lower.\n\nGayle Mendoza, with the Philadelphia Health Department, says this is the second time bird flu has been detected in a live market.\n\n\"Those markets at that point are shut down,\" Mendoza said. \"The birds are culled or killed to reduce any potential risk of further spread.\"\n\nHealth officials say the risk to the general public is very low.\n\n\"The vast majority of people who've been exposed and have then become sick or tested positive were people with very close contact, either to infected poultry or to infected cattle elsewhere in the country,\" Simeone said.\n\nThere have been about 70 cases nationwide of people infected with bird flu but none in Pennsylvania, New Jersey or Delaware.\n\nFor now, health officials say buying and eating chicken and beef remain safe as long as regular safety precautions such as handwashing and avoiding cross-contamination are followed and items are thoroughly cooked.\n\nThere are also some concerns about raw milk. The FDA is currently recommending that people only consume pasteurized milk because there is limited information about the transmission of bird flu in raw milk.",

The system includes Crozer-Chester Medical Center, Taylor Hospital and other facilities.\n\nAttorneys for Prospect appeared in bankruptcy court in Texas last week and warned that the entire system could be shut down. Then, on Sunday, Attorney General Dave Sunday and The Foundation for Delaware County announced a commitment of \"essential funding\" that would keep Crozer afloat.\n\nCBS News Philadelphia virtually attended another bankruptcy hearing on Tuesday.\n\nProspect's attorney and one from Sunday's office discussed the several hours of work to reach the essential funding deal.\n\nThe Prospect attorney said \"everyone in the room on Sunday was overwhelmingly committed to continue doing health care in Delaware County.\"\n\nThe judge said she breathed a sigh of relief, but she had questions about the possibility of getting a long-term deal done. Every attorney answered that hard work is happening behind the scenes.\n\n\"We were all looking for a hero in this, sounds like we have a few heroes,\" Chief Judge Stacey Jernigan said. \"Thanks and kudos to everyone who is working hard to find a long-term solution to avoid an abrupt closure.\"\n\nBut now the question: what happens after two weeks?\n\nPennsylvania government sources say the amount of money put up by the foundation covers a single payroll cycle. A foundation attorney says his side is committed to a long-term fix as well.\n\n\"We would not have been part of a short-term solution if there wasn't a prospect of a long-term solution ... our purpose is to serve health care in Delaware County. We are engaged,\" an attorney for the foundation told the judge.\n\nLawmakers say negotiations have been underway with other regional health care providers to come in and rescue the Crozer Health system. But sources say the system's financial condition makes that idea unattractive for the other health care entities in the region.\n\n\"All of the hospitals around us will feel the pain if Crozer closes, especially if it's a disorderly closure, which is what we've been trying to prevent,\" said state Rep. Leanne Krueger, whose district includes Crozer-Chester. \"So in the meantime, we've been expecting this could happen for quite a while because this isn't the first time Prospect has threatened a closure, they have been doing this for months.\"\n\nWorkers rallied outside Crozer-Chester Medical Center Tuesday afternoon, calling for a long-term plan to keep the hospital open. More than 3,000 jobs hang in the balance.\n\nLast month, the system was removed from Prospect Medical Holdings and placed into receivership. Delaware County and Pennsylvania provided $20 million at that time to keep the system running. Most of that money is gone.\n\nAnother hearing in Texas bankruptcy court is scheduled for March 26.\n\nA spokesperson for Main Line Health, which operates hospitals and and other health facilities around the region, said patients are coming to its locations \"in increasing numbers\" because of the instability in the Crozer system.",

        "source": "https://www.cbsnews.com/philadelphia/",
        "content": "Health officials in Philadelphia are warning residents about potential exposures to the highly infectious measles virus at multiple health facilities in the city over the past week.\n\nThe child who has the virus was at the following locations in the city at these times, according to the Philadelphia Department of Public Health:\n\nThe South Philadelphia Health and Literacy Center, 1700 South Broad Street. The building includes the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia's Pediatric Primary Care unit in South Philadelphia, the health department's Health Center No. 2 and the South Philadelphia library, but no one in the library is at risk.\n\nThe person was in that building on Friday, March 7, between 10:45 a.m. and 2:40 p.m. The next day on March 8, the person was there between 9:05 a.m. and 1:20 p.m.\n\nThe CHOP emergency room at 3401 Civic Center Boulevard on Monday, March 10 between 7:55 a.m. and 10:15 a.m.\n\nThe person was exposed to measles while traveling abroad, and officials do not believe the case is connected to a recent one that occurred in Montgomery County.\n\nThe patient who has measles is an 11-month-old who was too young to be vaccinated. The baby was first seen at CHOP's South Philadelphia Center. The child didn't have obvious signs of measles until later going to the main emergency department.\n\n\"After this child developed that measles rash, which is much more indicative of it being measles, ended up going to the emergency department and that's where that child got diagnosed,\" Gayle Mendoza with the city's health department said.\n\nMendoza said the health department is now doing contact tracing.\n\n\"Measles is incredibly contagious and really does linger in the air,\" Mendoza said. \"So, after somebody leaves a room, that virus stays there for another two hours afterward. So that exposure time isn't just when that child is in space, it also accounts for two hours afterwards.\"\n\nMendoza said the child is being treated with vitamin A.\n\n\"It's only given to kids who are severely ill, which means they're hospitalized, in order to prevent them from dying ultimately,\" Mendoza said. \"That's what the vitamin A has been shown to be helpful for, and that this child is receiving.\"\n\nMendoza emphasized that vitamin A is only a treatment and does not prevent measles.\n\nPhiladelphia Health Commissioner Dr. Palak Raval-Nelson said she is not concerned about a threat to the general public. Still, the spread of measles is a concern for people who are not protected against the virus or cannot be.\n\n\"As vaccination rates across the country continue to drop, there are more and more opportunities for people who cannot be vaccinated to be exposed to this deadly disease. That's why it is critical for everyone who needs to be protected from measles to get vaccinated as soon as possible,\" Raval-Nelson said in a news release.\n\nMeasles is an easily transmitted virus that can spread through respiratory droplets. Symptoms include a fever, runny nose, cough and puffy eyes. A rash usually develops a few days after symptoms start, according to the CDC.\n\n\"People who are not protected from measles but are exposed should quarantine, or stay at home away from others, for 21 days after the exposure. If someone who is quarantining due to measles must go out, they should wear a mask the entire time they are out. Wearing a mask won't completely prevent spread, but it will help lower the chances of them spreading measles to others,\" Raval-Nelson said.\n\n\"If you are protected from measles, you do not have to do anything. Measles vaccine is extremely effective at preventing measles,\" her department said in the release.\n\nDr. Paul Offit, CHOP's director of vaccine education, expects measles cases to continue to increase because of to vaccine skepticism.\n\n\"This is a highly contagious virus, and I don't think people realize how sick it can make you,\" Offit said.\n\nPeople who aren't vaccinated against measles and may have been exposed are advised to call their health care provider. Doctors say that while the first dose of the vaccine isn't usually given until babies are 12 months old, it can be done earlier if they are traveling internationally or to locations where there is an outbreak.",

        "source": "https://www.cbsnews.com/philadelphia/",
        "content": "Former heart surgeon and television host Dr. Mehmet Oz testified Friday before the Senate Finance Committee over his nomination to head the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services under President Trump.\n\nThe GOP-led committee will next schedule a vote on whether to send Oz's nomination to the full Senate, where he is likely to be approved given the Republican majority.\n\nIf confirmed, Oz would be the administrator charged with overseeing the nearly $1.5 trillion spent by the federal government on Medicare and Medicaid. The two health insurance programs for seniors and poor Americans make up more than a third of the budget.\n\nMedicare covers around 65 million people, through programs run directly by the federal government or contracted out to private insurers. Medicaid supports around 85 million, through programs administered primarily by state governments overseen by CMS.\n\nCMS also sets rules that affect private health insurance, including overseeing the Affordable Care Act's health insurance marketplaces.\n\nOz previously worked as a professor of cardiac surgery at Columbia University and host of \"The Dr. Oz Show\" until 2022, when he stopped taping new television episodes to run for a Senate seat in Pennsylvania. He lost that Senate race to Democrat John Fetterman, in a narrow contest where abortion had ranked as a top issue for voters.\n\nOz's priorities for Medicare and Medicaid\n\nOz outlined a vision for the agency focused in large part on modernizing its systems and tools, addressing waste and fraud and incentivizing Americans to make healthier lifestyle choices.\n\n\"Some of these decisions are not difficult. Some of them need to be simplified. And some of them need to be reminded frequently,\" Oz told senators of the healthier lifestyle choices he wants to encourage, adding later that \"the idea of giving incentives to patients is an idea that I think is a worthy one, especially for Medicaid beneficiaries.\"\n\nIt will be up to Oz to finalize or abandon some major changes to Medicare and Medicaid sought by the Biden administration, like a pricey proposal in November to expand coverage to drugs used for weight loss like Wegovy and Ozempic.\n\nOz did not directly address the proposal during the hearing. But he did promise to continue the Medicare drug price negotiation program launched by the Biden administration, from the Inflation Reduction Act.\n\n\"It's the law. I'm going to defend it and use it,\" Oz told senators.\n\nHe also voiced support for allowing states to add work requirements in Medicaid. Oz also said he wants work requirements to be defined broadly, to include activities like going to school or volunteering at a church.\n\n\"I don't think you need to use paperwork to prove a work requirement. And I don't think that should be used as an obstacle, a disingenuous effort to block people from getting on Medicaid,\" he said.\n\nOz criticizes Medicare Advantage\n\nDuring Friday's hearing, Oz singled out Medicare Advantage as one of the biggest sources of waste and abuse within the insurance industry.\n\nJust over half of seniors have opted for these plans offered by private insurers but paid for by taxpayers, according to the latest federal data, instead of \"original Medicare\" coverage.\n\nHe cited reports showing spending on the private alternatives outpacing traditional Medicare coverage as \"upside down\" what it should be, questioning spending by plans and efforts by brokers to persuade seniors to sign up.\n\nHe also criticized the practice of \"upcoding\" within Medicare Advantage, where providers or plans bill for treating patients as sicker than they actually are.\n\n\"A part of this is just recognizing there's a new sheriff in town. We actually have to go after places and areas where we're not managing the American people's money well,\" Oz said.\n\nOz calls for limiting prior authorization\n\nOz also faced questions over the significant authority he would wield over private health insurance.\n\nOn Monday, CMS proposed making several moves to reverse Biden administration expansions to the insurance marketplace created by the Affordable Care Act, like shortening the open enrollment period and excluding DACA recipients from coverage. In 2022, Oz said that the law \"caused havoc on our health care system\" and that he \"wouldn't have voted for it.\"\n\nDuring the hearing, Oz criticized health insurance companies misusing prior authorization - sometimes delaying treatment until doctors and patients can persuade insurers that it is necessary - as \"a pox on the system.\"\n\n\"We're spending money, wasting money, trying to do a process that should be automated. I would argue we could limit the number of preauthorized procedures to a thousand,\" he told senators.\n\nRepublicans optimistic Oz will be confirmed\n\nIn social media posts last month, Oz has touted \"great conversations\" with key Republicans he would need to win over for his nomination. Multiple Republicans at Friday's hearing said they were optimistic Oz would be confirmed.\n\nSen. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, the Republican chair of the Senate's health committee, was among those to sit down with Oz last month. Cassidy is one of four medical doctors in the Senate.\n\n\"Great meeting with Dr. Mehmet Oz, President Trump's nominee to lead the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. It will be great to have a doctor in charge,\" Cassidy posted on Feb. 5.\n\nOz was the fourth of Trump's health official picks to face questioning from senators. It comes a day after a hearing for Dr. David Weldon was abruptly canceled, after the White House withdrew his nomination to head the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nA majority of senators on the Senate's health committee advanced Dr. Jay Bhattacharya, the president's nominee to head the National Institutes of Health, and Dr. Marty Makary, the pick to head the Food and Drug Administration, on Thursday.\n\nOz's potential new supervisor, Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr., was narrowly confirmed by the Senate a month ago.\n\nDemocrats criticized Oz's past\n\nSen. Ron Wyden of Oregon, the top Democrat on committee, during the hearing accused Oz of \"dodging Medicare and Social Security taxes.\" Wyden said a tax loophole has \"benefited Dr. Oz by $440,000 in the last three years.\"\n\nDuring the hearing, Oz did not respond to the allegation. A memo from the committee's Democratic staff had concluded that Oz may have underpaid his taxes based on a questionairre he submitted, his tax returns and financial disclosures.\n\n\"Now, the doctor will testify about his concern for Medicare's well being, yet he is unwilling to pay the same taxes that millions of Americans pay out of every paycheck,\" Wyden said.\n\nThe president's pick to head CMS has earned criticism from some Senate Democrats for months, who have cited Oz's past embrace of \"alarming pseudoscience,\" record of anti-abortion statements and worries over conflicts of interest.\n\nAs part of an ethics agreement published last month, Oz said he will resign from positions at several companies, including the nutritional supplement company iHerb and the drugmaker Housey Pharma. He also pledged to divest from several healthcare companies, including insurance giant UnitedHealth Group.\n\nAfter the Senate race, Oz had been advertised as iHerb's global advisor. He continued to promote iHerb's supplements on social media after his nomination.\n\nHe has also continued to republish past excerpts from his show in recent years after the Senate race, like a clip he shared on Sept. 4 from a sponsored interview about Medicare Advantage coverage. In 2020, Oz would later propose that Medicare Advantage should be expanded to all Americans.\n\nIn the clip, Oz said that enrollment in Medicare Advantage had grown 70% since he started his show.\n\n\"I want to nudge you. I don't want to shove you. But think about this, because a 70% increase since I started the show means a lot to me,\" he said.\n\nand contributed to this report.",

It was the beginning of a wave of illnesses that took millions of lives worldwide.\n\nHospitals were the front lines in a global battle to treat a then-mysterious virus.\n\n\"As of this afternoon, we have a total of 16 Pennsylvania cases of COVID-19,\" Pennsylvania Health Secretary Dr. Rachel Levine said.\n\nFive years ago, Levine was updating early COVID numbers that would quickly escalate.\n\nDr. Raina Merchant was working in the emergency department at Penn Medicine as COVID swept through the Philadelphia region.\n\nPenn Medicine treated thousands of patients – many of the most critically ill.\n\n\"We had to be really nimble to respond to so many changes in information and how we could optimize care for patients,\" Merchant said.\n\nIn New York City, the epicenter of the pandemic, Sal Mazzara, who had an early and serious case of COVID-19, was reunited with the doctor who saved his life.\n\n\"I could not believe what was going on. That I was just dropping my husband off at the hospital and wasn't sure we gonna see him again,\" Josephine Mazzara, Sal's wife, said.\n\nMount Sinai Hospital quickly filled. Tents were set up in Central Park for overflow patients, and refrigerated trucks were used to hold bodies.\n\n\"I've never seen so much tragedy in a short period of time,\" Dr. Sanam Ahmed, a critical care physician at Mount Sinai Health System, said.\n\nSal Mazzara spent weeks on a ventilator and suffered a cardiac arrest.\n\n\"In COVID, if you had a cardiac arrest, it was extremely unlikely that you would survive and Sal did,\" Ahmed said.\n\nAfter 45 days, Sal Mazzara left the hospital to go home.\n\n\"I hope that people remember how everyone supported each other,\" Ahmed said.\n\nAbout 1.22 million people died of COVID in the U.S., according to data from the CDC.\n\nDoctors say the vaccine, which was created in Philadelphia at Penn Medicine, substantially changed the course of the pandemic.",

        "content": "Lawyers with the Pennsylvania Attorney General's Office signaled positive momentum for a long-term plan to save Delaware County's Crozer Health system on Wednesday during a bankruptcy hearing with Prospect Medical Holdings.\n\nAt a lengthy hearing Wednesday, a deputy attorney general told the court: \"This is a very complex dance, and are cautiously optimistic we will have a long-term plan.\"\n\nAttorneys said they are looking at Friday as a possible deadline to have a deal in the works.\n\nThe long-term plan aims to place the financially distressed Crozer system in the hands of a nonprofit to take over and run its two hospitals and other medical campuses in Delaware County. Crozer's parent company, Prospect Medical Holdings, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on Jan. 11.\n\nThe state and county have already shelled out $20 million to keep the lights in the bankrupt facilities.\n\nThe health network was bailed out in February with a cash infusion from the state and Delaware County for a combined $20 million, but that money ran out in March.\n\nLast week, the Foundation for Delaware County provided $7 million for an additional round of payroll, leaving the hospitals with an operational deadline of next Wednesday.\n\nPeggy Malone, the president of the Crozer-Chester Nurses Association, said it's been rough working within the health network amid the potential shutdown.\n\n\"So it just continued the roller-coaster that we've been on,\" she said. \"But again, anything that sheds a little bit of optimism and hope is what we're looking for — we're not leaving.\"\n\nFor Claudia Northfleet, who was just discharged from the hospital, the news of a possible long-term deal was well-received.\n\nJeanette Winston said Crozer-Chester Medical Center is vital to the community.\n\n\"I've got daughters that are asthmatic, I've got daughters allergic to peanuts and shellfish,\" she said. \"My husband actually works at this hospital doing the housekeeping — it means a lot. I had my babies at this hospital. To shut this hospital down, with a big community — we need this hospital.\"\n\nWinston is hoping that deal comes to fruition on Friday.\n\n\"I believe there's a way,\" she said. \"I believe.\"",

This is NOT the result of the Title IX investigation launched by the Department of Education,\" a senior White House official wrote in the email.\n\nThomas came in first in the 500-meter freestyle at the 2022 NCAA Swimming and Diving Championships and had other top finishes in events at the Ivy League Championships that year.\n\nSome women swimmers disputed those wins. A lawsuit filed in a Massachusetts federal court seeks to have her records removed from the record books. Separately, the Education Department launched a Title IX investigation into Penn allowing Thomas to compete on the women's swimming team.\n\nAt the time, NCAA regulations allowed for trans women to compete on teams that aligned with their gender identity. President Trump undid those protections in an executive order signed in February.\n\nA senior White House official said in an email that the funding is an \"immediate proactive action to review discretionary funding streams to those universities.\" The funding that was paused came from the Department of Defense and the Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nA Penn spokesperson said the Philadelphia-based university is aware of media reports and social media posts about the funding being pulled, but has received no formal notice from the White House.\n\n\"We are aware of media reports suggesting a suspension of $175 million in federal funding to Penn, but have not yet received any official notification or any details,\" the spokesperson said in an email. \"It is important to note, however, that Penn has always followed NCAA and Ivy League policies regarding student participation on athletic teams. We have been in the past, and remain today, in full compliance with the regulations that apply to not only Penn, but all of our NCAA and Ivy League peer institutions.\"\n\nWednesday morning, the White House's @RapidResponse47 account shared a clip from Fox Business on X on the news.\n\nThe White House official said Wednesday's action is separate from an Education Department investigation into Penn over alleged violations of Title IX, a 1972 law barring sex discrimination in education.\n\nCity Councilmember Jamie Gauthier, whose district includes Penn's campus, denounced the decision in a statement.\n\n\"These funds have nothing to do with transgender student athletes — this is nothing more than a hollow pretext to target our community,\" Gauthier's statement said in part. \"What Trump is really doing is threatening tens of thousands of jobs, our hospitals, lifesaving research projects, educational programs for underserved youth, and so much more.\"\n\nGauthier added that some prior actions from the Trump administration have not held up to lawsuits and that she is proud that many transgender Philadelphians call her district home.\n\n\"They make our community stronger and a better place to live. I will always stand with them,\" Gauthier said.\n\nGauthier also said the move is not about athletics but about attacking Philadelphia.\n\n\"I believe this is about President Trump trying to attack Democratic cities like Philadelphia. He understands we are an 'eds and meds' economy and he's trying to take aim at the city. This is meant to divide us,\" she said.\n\nMr. Trump graduated from The Wharton School at Penn in 1968, according to the Daily Pennsylvanian student newspaper.",

And that is not going over well with some parents.\n\nPSSAs are very important to school districts because they determine things like funding, school rankings and other things. But Take Your Child to Work Day is equally important to parents.\n\nThe PSSA, statewide testing days, which are mandatory for every Pennsylvania student, overlap with this year's Take Your Child to Work Day, which always falls on the fourth Thursday in April every year.\n\n\"Well, it's two separate days no matter how you look at it. If you're gonna Take Your Child to Work Day, that should be one day, and then testing is another day,\" said Terry Lippert, who has grandkids in the South Park School District.\n\nThe problem: neither wants to change their days. The state decides PSSA days. The districts have no say and must comply.\n\nTake Your Child to Work Day is not only important to parents, but many companies go all out for that day with special programs for the kids. The organization that heads up the national day doesn't believe it should have to change its traditional day.\n\nSome parents don't want to make that choice: work day or testing day. However, many parents don't realize their child can usually make up that testing day.\n\nAt South Park schools, for example, the parent just fills out a permission form found on their website. The district will then retest the students on different days.\n\nThe superintendent of South Park Schools told KDKA-TV: \"Take Your Child to Work Day offers students a unique opportunity to gain real-world experience, but its annual scheduling within the testing window can create challenges for both students and educators. While make-up opportunities are available, students perform best when testing in their originally scheduled environment.\"",
