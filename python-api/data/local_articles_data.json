        "content": "At the first stop of their “Fighting Oligarchy” tour out West, two of the Democratic Party’s most unabashed progressive lawmakers had plenty to say about President Donald Trump. But they also had some strong words for their own party.\n\n“This isn’t just about Republicans. We need a Democratic Party that fights harder for us, too,” Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., told the fired-up crowd gathered at the Craig Ranch Amphitheater to see her and Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt. “But what that means is that we as a community must choose and vote for Democrats and elected officials who know how to stand for the working class.”\n\nWhile Ocasio-Cortez did not mention any Democratic leaders by name, the crowd broke out into multiple “Primary Chuck” chants — a reference to Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., who backed down from a funding fight with Trump last week. The move enraged the base and prompted some of Ocasio-Cortez’s House colleagues to encourage her to mount a primary challenge to Schumer, her fellow New Yorker, in 2028.\n\nK.M.

Sign up for NBC Philadelphia's News Headlines newsletter.\n\nOcasio-Cortez and Sanders — stars on the left who are channeling a fighting spirit at a time when Democrats say that’s what they want to see more of — are looking to turn the party’s anger into action and mobilize voters in the fight against Trump and his MAGA movement.\n\n“I think unfortunately, the conservatives are playing a really good game of chess, and now it’s time for the Dems to go ahead and step up to the plate and figure out how we’re going to go ahead and take our democracy back,” said Samantha Petras, a resident of Phoenix who attended the pair's second event of the day, in Tempe, Ariz.\n\nSanders and Ocasio-Cortez made a direct appeal Thursday to working-class voters — a populist message they hope will particularly resonate in a battleground state like Nevada, which is home to one of the largest hospitality workers unions in the country.\n\n“We have two very different Americas. In one of those Americas, the wealthiest people have never, ever, in the history of our country, had it so good. People on top are doing extraordinarily well today,” Sanders said, prompting boos from the crowd. “We have more income and wealth inequality in our country than we have ever had.”\n\nDemocrats plan to hold nearly 30 town hall events this week, while Republican lawmakers continue to largely stay away from in-person constituent events because of voter backlash over Trump and billionaire Elon Musk’s sweeping cuts to the federal government. Democratic lawmakers, though, are also hearing an earful from constituents who want their elected officials to stand up to Trump more aggressively.\n\nSanders and Ocasio-Cortez expect more than 51,000 people to turn out for their events this week, which will also include stops in Denver and Tucson, according to Sanders’ office. Sanders, 83, launched his “Fighting Oligarchy” tour last month with a pair of events in Iowa and Nebraska in a bid to target Republican voters dissatisfied with Trump and Musk.\n\nSanders planned the events in districts narrowly won by Republicans in 2024 to pressure lawmakers to vote against any cuts to entitlement programs, housing, nutrition or education, his office said.\n\nOcasio-Cortez acknowledged that not everyone in the crowd may agree with all of her politics or may not have even voted in the last election, but she encouraged the crowd to unite around an agenda that puts working-class voters first.\n\n“We might all come from different places, but we share a lot of the same experiences. So to all those who came here today unsure of whether or not this is where you belong, I want to say that you do,” she said. “You do, no matter who you voted for, no matter if you know all the right words to say, no matter your race, religion, gender, identity or status, no matter, even, if you disagree with me on a bunch of things. But if you are willing to fight for someone you don’t know, you are welcome here, regardless of who they are, how they identify or where they come from — you are welcome here.”\n\nEven as Ocasio-Cortez and Sanders tried to broaden their appeal beyond the typical base, plenty of criticism was aimed squarely at Trump.\n\n“We will not accept an authoritarian form of society with a president who undermines the Constitution every day and is working aggressively to take away our freedom of speech and freedom of assembly,” Sanders said. “No, we will not accept the society of massive economic inequalities where the very rich are becoming much richer while working families across the country struggle to put food on the table.”\n\nThe Democratic Party is struggling to find its footing amid historically low approval numbers and a voter base that wants its leaders to put up a fight against Trump’s agenda.\n\nPresident Donald Trump signed an executive order Thursday to close the Department of Education.\n\nNearly two-thirds of Democrats say they want congressional Democrats to stick to their positions even if it risks sacrificing bipartisan progress, compared with 32% who want them to make legislative compromises with Trump, according to NBC News’ most recent poll.\n\nThe polling mirrors backlash Democratic lawmakers have received at their own town hall events, where voters this week complained about the party’s “passive” response to Trump’s Cabinet picks, empowerment of Musk and cuts to the federal workforce.\n\nThe frustration among Democratic voters and lawmakers alike intensified last week after Schumer led a group of Democrats to help advance a Republican government funding bill backed by Trump to avert a government shutdown, even as House Democrats warned the measure would codify spending cuts Trump pushed for.\n\nOcasio-Cortez skewered Schumer last week for his support of the Republican-led funding measure, calling it a “betrayal” and suggesting it could weaken the “trust” between House and Senate Democrats.\n\nDemocratic voters, too, said they were dismayed by Schumer's approach.\n\n“We should have shut the government down,” 55-year-old Marc Borzcon of Chandler, Ariz. said on Thursday at the event in Tempe. “I have no doubt in my mind that that was the proper thing to do under the circumstances.”\n\nAfter hearing Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez speak, Borzcon encouraged Democrats to \"fight a little lower.\"\n\n\"I think we've seen the other side continuously break the rules and thumb their nose at the rules. So at some point you got to say, 'Hey, we don't play by the rules either,'\" he said.\n\nRep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif, publicly urged Ocasio-Cortez to launch a primary challenge against Schumer in 2028 if he runs for re-election, and several House Democrats told NBC News that her colleagues also privately pushed her to do so at a party retreat last week.\n\nThere is also speculation she could mount a run for president, though her team insists she isn’t thinking about her own political future at the moment.\n\nBut the crowd in Las Vegas certainly is: “AOC 2028” pins were being sold at a merchandise stand outside the venue.\n\nMelanie Zanona reported from Las Vegas, Nnamdi Egwuonwu from Tempe, Ariz., and Brennan Leach from Washington, D.C.\n\nThis article first appeared on NBCNews.com.

        "content": "Jason Kelce and Fletcher Cox said good-bye a year ago and Brandon Graham said good-bye on Tuesday.\n\nLane Johnson is the last man standing from that group of Eagles legends who were all drafted between 2010 and 2013, but rest assured he has no plans to walk away from football any time soon.\n\nJohnson signed a one-year extension earlier this week, and he’s now under contract through 2027. If he plays through that deal, he'd match Graham’s franchise-record 15 seasons with the Eagles, and he’d be 37, which would make him the 2nd-oldest position player in franchise history, behind his mentor, Jason Peters.\n\nIs three more years possible?\n\nGet top local stories in Philly delivered to you every morning. Sign up for NBC Philadelphia's News Headlines newsletter.\n\n“Yeah, I mean it's very possible,” Johnson said Wednesday. “I think when you get to this stage of your career, you take it year by year, but physically I feel really good.\n\n“You know, a few years ago when I was coming back from all these (ankle) surgeries, I thought my body was going to start failing or going downhill. But I just think with the strength and conditioning program we have here and the stuff we do in the offseason, I feel really good.\n\n“So, yeah, as long as I'm feeling good and I feel like I can contribute, I think I'll continue to play. It's all I've really known. I just love my football family. I'm an only child, so my brothers are here and have always been in the locker room, and that's how I feel.”\n\nThis, of course, is incredible news.\n\nJohnson is the best right tackle in the NFL and while the Eagles had Cam Jurgens ready to take over for Kelce, Nolan Smith ready to take over for Graham and Jalen Carter ready to take over for Cox, it’s hard to imagine replacing Johnson.\n\nHe's one of only six offensive tackles in NFL history to make six Pro Bowls along with all-pro twice.\n\nAccording to Pro Football Focus data, Johnson has played over 3,000 regular-season pass-block snaps since 2019 and allowed five sacks and 10 quarterback hits.\n\nHis six Pro Bowls are 3rd-most by an Eagles offensive lineman – one fewer than Kelce and Peters – and along with Graham he’s one of only two position players in franchise history to win two Super Bowls.\n\nAnd he was as good this past season in his 12th season as he’s ever been.\n\n“As a younger player, I think I had to get stronger to deal with some of these bull rushes, especially from Ryan Kerrigan, after that I just really focused on what I need to attack each offseason as far as becoming a better player,” he said. “So year after year, I feel like I've progressed, but for me it's about being strong and then a lot of it's about being flexible, being able to bend. A lot of players as they age, they lose that ability to explode and to burst.\n\n“So when I look at athletes, you see what LeBron's doing, I've seen what some Olympic athletes have done. You know there's a guy out of Cuba, Mijaín López, that won his fifth gold medal at 41. So there are people that are able to go past the barriers or perceived barriers and I look to guys and athletes like that you know as inspiration and just to know that it's possible.”\n\nJohnson has started 158 regular-season games as an Eagle, so if he plays out this contract and stays healthy he could get to 200 starts. Only nine offensive linemen in history have started 200 games and only played for one team. Only one of them – Hall of Famer Gene Upshaw with the Raiders – won two Super Bowls.\n\nSo Johnson has a real opportunity to continue to etch his name into the record books and build on an already-formidable Hall of Fame resume.\n\n“Signed to play three more years and barring injuries or any of that, as long as my body's feeling good and I feel like I'm not regressing or becoming a shell of my former self, I could very well play three more years,” he said. “I love doing this.\n\n“But I think at every stage, especially when you get past 10, I think everybody looks and goes, ‘OK, where are we at?’ after each season. And then, if any decision is going to be made, it's definitely going to be a few months into the offseason. It's not this one.”\n\nWhen Johnson starts the 2025 season at right tackle, he’ll become the eighth player in franchise history to play 13 seasons in an Eagles uniform, joining B.G. (15 seasons), Chuck Bednarik (14) and Kelce, Brian Dawkins, Harold Carmichael, Bucko Kilroy and Vic Sears (13 each).\n\nHe's never been a free agent. The Eagles have always extended him before he got close.\n\n“I never wanted to go to another team,” he said. “The Eagles have always been here for me, good or bad. And so they've been pivotal in my development as a player and as a person off the field. And so, yeah, I couldn't be more excited about staying here.\n\n“It's very rare that a person can stay with one team 10-plus years. And my goal is to play well throughout my middle to late 30s, which I'm looking forward to.\n\n“I love the challenge of being an older player and the routine you've got to keep up with. I think that's what I love most about football, just the conflict and the constant trying to improve. I think the people that I'm in the building with have a similar type of mindset.\n\n“When you combine all these things, I think that's why we've had success here the past 10 years and I think why they're going to have success long after I'm gone. It's just the way they've done things here year after year.”\n\nSubscribe to Eagle Eye anywhere you get your podcasts:\n\nApple Podcasts | YouTube Music | Spotify | Stitcher | Simplecast | RSS | Watch on YouTube",

Sign up for NBC Philadelphia's News Headlines newsletter.\n\n1. Banning the tush push\n\nThe Green Bay Packers proposed banning the play that the Philadelphia Eagles have perfected.\n\nHere's how the Packers intend to outlaw the famous \"Brotherly Shove\" that the Eagles rode to a Super Bowl win:\n\n\"To prohibit an offensive player from pushing a teammate who was lined up directly behind the snapper and receives the snap, immediately at the snap,\" the proposal says.\n\n2. Penalty change for defensive holding and illegal contact\n\nThe Detroit Lions proposed a less harsh penalty for defensive holding and illegal contact.\n\nBoth penalties are currently five yards and an automatic first down. Under the proposal, it would still be five yards but not an automatic first down.\n\nSo, for example, if there's a defensive holding on a third-and-10, the teams would replay the down as a third-and-5 rather than a first-and-10.\n\n3. Regular season overtime rules\n\nThe Eagles proposed changing the regular season overtime rules.\n\nUnder the change, both teams would be guaranteed a possession on offense -- the same rules that are used in overtime for the postseason.\n\nThis would make overtime rules similar for both regular season and playoff games, with both teams possessing the ball in a 15-minute period. This wouldn't eliminate ties, though -- games that are still knotted after 15 minutes would end in the regular season. In the playoffs, teams play further overtime periods until a tie is broken.",

Yet one North Philly neighborhood’s solution has led to mixed reactions. On Erie Avenue between Broad Street and Old York Road, a bike lane is currently on the sidewalk rather than the street.\n\n“It’s not supposed to be like that,” Angel Castro, a resident, told NBC10. “Because the name has it all. Sidewalk. It’s for people to walk. Not to ride bikes.”\n\nThe lane was installed on the North Philly sidewalk a few months ago. It’s proven to be divisive for residents in the area.\n\n“Yeah, I’d rather have a bike lane in the street,” Selim Yahyaoui, a bicyclist who rides through the city each day, told NBC10. “I don’t think it’s that comfortable. Because there’s like people walking and sometimes they get annoyed with cyclists.”\n\nGet top local stories in Philly delivered to you every morning.

According to the organization, 125 people lost their lives in traffic accidents in the city in 2024 with 58 of the victims being pedestrians and three of them being bicyclists. They believe the sidewalk bike lanes can help improve safety and are hoping that they're ultimately installed near every major thoroughfare in Philadelphia.\n\n“I think if you look at it, it is clear that it is separated,” Chris Gale, a member of the coalition, told NBC10. “You know where the cyclist is supposed to be. You know where the pedestrian is supposed to be. You know where the driver is supposed to be. So you have the street calming.”\n\nAs for those who have taken issue with the lane, another North Philly resident had a simple solution.\n\n\"If you share it with them, let them go,\" he said. \"Just move out the way.\"",

        "content": "A federal judge in Los Angeles has ruled that Mariah Carey did not steal her perennial megahit “All I Want for Christmas Is You\" from other songwriters.\n\nJudge Mónica Ramírez Almadani granted Carey's request for summary judgment on Wednesday, giving her and co-writer and co-defendant Walter Afanasieff a victory without going to trial.\n\nIn 2023, songwriters Andy Stone of Louisiana — who goes by the stage name Vince Vance — and Troy Powers of Tennessee filed the $20 million lawsuit alleging that Carey's 1994 song, which has since become a holiday standard and annual streaming sensation, infringed the copyright of their country 1989 song with the same title.\n\nTheir lawyer Gerard P. Fox said he's “disappointed\" in an email to The Associated Press.\n\nGet top local stories in Philly delivered to you every morning. Sign up for NBC Philadelphia's News Headlines newsletter.\n\nFox said it is his experience that judges at this level \"nearly always now dismiss a music copyright case and that one must appeal to reverse and get the case to the jury. My client will make a decision shortly on whether to appeal. We filed based on the opinions of two esteemed musicologists who teach at great colleges.\"\n\nStone and Powers' suit said their “'All I Want For Christmas Is You' contains a unique linguistic structure where a person, disillusioned with expensive gifts and seasonal comforts, wants to be with their loved one, and accordingly writes a letter to Santa Claus.”\n\nThey said there was an “overwhelming likelihood” Carey and Afanasieff had heard their song — which at one point reached No. 31 on Billboard's Hot Country chart — and infringed their copyright by taking significant elements from it.\n\nMariah Carey is setting the record straight after some fans believed her Spotify Wrapped message was AI generated. The queen of Christmas took to X to explain why some might have believed the clip was artificially made with technology.\n\nAfter hearing from two experts for each side, Ramírez Almadani agreed with those from the defense, who said the writers employed common Christmas cliches that existed prior to both songs, and that Carey's song used them differently. She said the plaintiffs had not met the burden of showing that the songs are substantially similar.\n\nRamírez Almadani also ordered sanctions against the plaintiffs and their lawyers, saying their suit and subsequent filings were frivolous and that the plaintiffs' attorneys “made no reasonable effort to ensure that the factual contentions asserted have evidentiary support.”\n\nShe said they must pay at least part of the defendants' attorney fees.\n\nDefense attorneys and publicists for Carey did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nCarey's Christmas colossus has become an even bigger hit in recent years than it was in the 1990s. It has reached No. 1 on Billboard’s Hot 100 chart the past six years in a row — measuring the most popular songs each week — not just the holiday-themed — by airplay, sales and streaming.\n\nCarey and Afanasieff have had their own public disagreement — though not one that's gone to court — over who wrote how much of the song. But the case made them at least temporary allies.",

This year, the international hub predicts that at least 84.2 million passengers will pass through the airport, which has previously been described as the “most connected” in the world.\n\nHeathrow said that it also expected “significant disruption over the coming days” and that it would notify the public as more became known as it urged passengers not to go to the site until it reopened.\n\n“We know this will be disappointing for passengers and we want to reassure that we are working as hard as possible to resolve the situation,” the airport said.\n\nOne of those disappointed passengers was Los Angeles-based comedian and star of “Adam Ruins Everything” Adam Conover, who was in transit to London for a stand-up gig when his flight was diverted midair.\n\n“We were in the air for about it 90 minutes and they had just finished dinner service,” the 42-year-old comedian told NBC News in a phone interview Friday morning. “Then the captain came on and said there was a fire … we had to turn around.”\n\nAfter a brief nap, the creator of Netflix’s “The G Word” said he’ll be flying to New York’s John F. Kennedy International Airport, where he faces a four-hour layover, a flight to Manchester, and then an at least two-hour-long train to the British capital.\n\nA video posted on social media showed the inside of the airport with only emergency lighting, while the fire raged at the substation responsible for the major hub's electricity.\n\nBritish Energy Secretary Ed Miliband told BBC News that the situation was “unprecedented” after the fire also affected a backup generator at the power substation.\n\n“This is a highly visible and significant incident, and our firefighters are working tirelessly in challenging conditions to bring the fire under control as swiftly as possible,” Fire Assistant Commissioner Pat Goulbourne said in a statement.\n\nGoulbourne added that the fire had caused power outages at homes and businesses in the local area and was spewing out heavy smoke.\n\n\"We do not have clarity on when power may be reliably restored,\" the airport said in a statement early Friday local time, adding that Heathrow's doors would remain closed until at least the end of the day.\n\nOn Friday, the London Fire Brigade said that the fire involved an electricity substation with 25,000 liters of cooling oil that was on fire. Jonathan Smith, deputy commissioner with the LFB, said the fire began at 8:23 p.m. on Thursday evening (4:23 p.m. ET) and took 10 fire engines and 70 personnel to get it under control.\n\nFirefighters evacuated 29 people from surrounding homes, and 150 more in an exclusion zone were taken to a rest center.\n\n“Our firefighters worked tirelessly in challenging and very hazardous conditions under control as swiftly as possible,” Smith said, adding that the fire is now 90% extinguished. He did not comment on the cause of the fire.\n\nThe disruption was expected to impact at least 1,351 flights set to arrive at or depart from Heathrow on Friday, according to FlightRadar24.\n\nNational Air Traffic Services, or NATS, the U.K.’s leading provider of air traffic control services, said it had “well-rehearsed plans in place which includes a requirement for aircraft to either turn back or divert to a non-U.K. airport, as well as stopping other flights at their point of departure.”\n\nNATS added as part of the aviation industry’s “mass diversion plan,” it had been made clear to airlines that there was a limited capacity at other British airports to accommodate diversions.\n\nIn a statement, a spokesperson for British Airways — the U.K. flag-carrier is based at Heathrow — said closures the were having a “significant impact on our operation.”\n\nAs of early Friday, operations at other British airports did not yet appear to be heavily impacted.\n\nNBC News Social Media Editor Fiona Day, who was at London Stansted Airport said that “departures here are no busier than normal this morning. If anything, security was actually faster than normal.”\n\nChantal Da Silva, Zoe Holland, Patrick Smith, and Annie Hill reported from London. Phil Helsel reported from Los Angeles.\n\nThis story first appeared on NBCNews.com. More from NBC News:",

        "content": "Amazon just announced that it’s once again hosting a major discounted shopping event months before Prime Day. Running from March 25 to 31, The Big Spring Sale, will have deals on beauty products, tech, home goods, travel necessities, Amazon gadgets (like Kindle devices) and more. One of the biggest differences between The Big Spring Sale and Amazon’s Prime Day? You don’t have to be a Prime member to cash in on the deals — anyone will be able to shop the sale on the retailer’s website starting on March 25, 2025.\n\nAmazon will drop new deals throughout the sale, so once it begins, it’s smart to keep checking for additional offers. Below, we outlined some of the best savings to keep an eye on, plus included information on how you can become a Prime member in case you’re ready to make that leap.\n\nSKIP AHEAD What will be on sale during Amazon’s Big Spring Sale? | Early Big Spring Sale deals | What is Amazon Prime? | How much does Amazon Prime cost? | Why trust NBC Select?\n\nWhat will be on sale during Amazon’s Big Spring Sale?\n\nAs mentioned, during the Big Spring Sale, you’ll be able to find deals across various categories. So far, Amazon’s announced that you can expect: :\n\nUp to 40% off select apparel and beauty\n\nUp to 40% off select sports and travel essentials\n\nUp to 40% off select outdoor furniture and garden supplies\n\nUp to 35% off select lawn and grilling equipment\n\nUp to 35% off select home storage and bedding\n\nWhile anyone — regardless of their Prime status — will be able to shop deals during the Big Spring Sale, there will be select deals only Prime members can take advantage of. You’ll be able to identify these deals because they’ll have a “Prime Spring Deal” badge on them.\n\nDuring the sale, Amazon will also offer 50% off Amazon Haul purchases. Not familiar with Haul? It’s a newly launched section on the Amazon Shopping app and mobile app that offers products that are under $20.\n\nEarly Big Spring Sale deals\n\nWe’ll be covering The Big Spring Sale extensively, but in the meantime we rounded up some on-sale Amazon finds you can shop right now. You can also bookmark this page to stay up to date on our deals coverage.\n\nCurrently 50% off, this cordless stick vacuum has an infrared sensor that detects dirt and automatically increases power to pick it up, according to Shark. The brushroll has soft microfibers to collect stuck-on dust, plus silicone fins to dig deeper into carpet and bring up debris. The vacuum’s LED display allows you to change the suction mode and see how much battery life is left (you can get up to 40 minutes of run time on a single charge). It also comes with a crevice attachment to help you reach tight areas like couch creases and corners.\n\nOur pick for the best reusable water bottle with a handle, this Stanley’s tumbler holds 30-ounces of liquid and is designed to fit in most car cup holders, according to the brand. Like the best water bottles, it has double-walled vacuum insulation that keeps the temperature of your drinks steady — it can stay cool or hot for hours, according to our editors. Currently, 10 different shades are 25% off — including fuschia, glacier and nectarine.\n\nThis 4-pack of Apple AirTags is currently on sale for its lowest price ever on Amazon. One of our favorite travel accessories, these trackers can help you find or monitor your items by syncing it with your iPhone and the Apple FindMy app. When you’re near your item, the app will guide you to it with an arrow. If you are further than 30 feet from the item you’re looking for, the AirTag will ping off other iPhones and send location data to your phone so you can track it.\n\nBagsmart’s carry-on won an NBC Select Travel Award last year and the brand also makes some of our favorite packing cubes. Right now, its tote is at its lowest price ever on Amazon. It has a side pocket for your water bottle and a padded laptop compartment inside. This bag is made of water-resistant nylon and weighs just 1.43 pounds.\n\nYou can use this Anker device as a wall charger or a general power bank when you’re on the go. For the latter, it has enough juice to not only charge phones, but also iPads and laptops, according to the brand. Also nice: It has two USB-C ports and one USB-A port, allowing you to charge up to three devices at once.\n\nFree of alcohol and peroxide, this mouthwash whitens teeth without leaving them sensitive, according to the brand. Beyond whitening, the formula combines sage, coconut and lemon peel oils to give your breath that fresh and clean smell. Two 16-ounce bottles come in the set, which has a 4.4-star average from over 2,330 reviews on Amazon.\n\nThe Ninja Flip is a toaster oven and air fryer in one. But what makes it even more unique is the ability to flip it upright for tidier storage. It has eight cooking settings — including air fry, roast, bake, broil, toast, bagel, pizza and dehydrate. It can fit up to a 12-inch pizza and roast up to four pounds of veggies at once, according to the brand. The toaster oven comes with a baking sheet and a ventilated air fry basket.\n\nThis projector is a favorite of NBC Select commerce editor Jordan Bowman. It can project a maximum screen size of 120 inches and has a 1080p display. A single charge can play a 2.5-hour movie or play 8-hours of music, according to the brand. It also weighs just over a pound, making it easy to bring it outside or over to a pal’s house. “It’s about the size of a soda can and produces a better image than my old television,” says Bowman. “A portable projector isn’t perfect, but if it fits your needs, it can completely change how you enjoy entertainment in your living space.”\n\nHaven’t gotten around to doing your taxes? With just a few weeks left to get them in, Amazon is currently offering 30% off tax software from TurboTax. The downloadable program works on a Mac or PC and includes five federal e-files and one state e-file. With your purchase, you’ll also get access to live support to get one-on-one advice from a tax professional as you work on your return. This program will also automatically import your return from last year from TurboTax or other select tax software, to save you time having to fill out information that has remained the same.\n\nWhat is Amazon Prime?\n\nAmazon Prime launched in 2005 and is a paid loyalty program that gives its members various perks including free shipping on a number of items, as well as streaming and entertainment benefits.\n\nHow much does an Amazon Prime membership cost?\n\nA Prime membership costs $15 monthly, or you can pay $139 annually. The yearly Prime membership includes a 30-day free trial for new members. You can sign up for either at amazon.com/prime.\n\nAmazon also offers a discounted membership for students. Prime Student costs $69 yearly and there is also a lower-priced option for those who qualify for certain types of government assistance programs.\n\nWhy trust NBC Select?\n\nI’m a writer at NBC Select who covers a variety of topics, including home, tech and beauty. I have been covering major shopping events like Amazon Prime Day, Black Friday and Cyber Monday for over a decade.\n\nCatch up on NBC Select’s in-depth coverage of tech and tools, wellness and more, and follow us on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and TikTok to stay up to date.",

        "content": "Originally appeared on E! Online\n\nShonda Rhimes is reflecting on the early days of \"Grey’s Anatomy.\"\n\nThe Shondaland creator — who has gone on to create \"Scandal,\" \"Bridgerton\" and \"How to Get Away With Murder\" under her company — recently detailed how she thought an early on-set incident was nearly the end of the medical drama.\n\nIn 2006, Isaiah Washington, who portrayed Dr. Preston Burke on the ABC series, got into a physical confrontation with costar Patrick Dempsey, which included the use of a homophobic slur toward costar T.R. Knight and ultimately led to Washington’s firing. After the incident, Rhimes feared the fallout “was going to kill the show.”\n\nGet top local stories in Philly delivered to you every morning. Sign up for NBC Philadelphia's News Headlines newsletter.\n\n“I think the thorn was having the bubble of joy burst so early on Grey’s [with the Washington incident],” she told The Hollywood Reporter in an interview published March 19, “and not having anybody interested in helping us deal with it, because that really shaped a lot of how we looked at the world going forward.”\n\nREAD Ellen Pompeo Slams Tabloids for “Attacking” Husband Chris Ivery Amid Grey’s Anatomy Fame\n\nShe added, “It’s funny, every Grey’s actor I talk to who was there during that time is still traumatized by that incident. People still talk about it.”\n\nAfter initially denying his use of the homophobic slur, Washington admitted he had used the word and apologized in a 2007 statement to The Showbuzz, per CBS News. Despite the apology, ABC chose not to renew Washington’s contract in 2007, a spokesperson confirmed to ABC News at the time, though the network declined to comment further regarding his exit.\n\nWhile Washington’s controversy rocked Rhimes and the show’s cast, it wasn’t the only drama the show — which began in 2005 and is now in its 21st season — had to tackle head-on. In 2008, series star Katherine Heigl removed herself from Emmys consideration because of what she believed to be a lack of quality material.\n\n“Snow White” stars Rachel Zegler and Gal Gadot are playing a round of Disney trivia. The two leading ladies chatted with Access Hollywood and revealed their favorite Disney princesses, Disneyland ride and got nostalgic thinking about their favorite Disney memory. Rachel also revealed the sweet reason she relates to Dumbo.\n\nFollowing the early scandals, Rhimes explained she had to shift her perspective as the showrunner.\n\n“It was certainly not a challenge I was looking for,” she continued. “It was also not a challenge I expected. When we partnered with [producers] Mark Gordon and [creative partner] Betsy [Beers], I remember thinking, ‘Well, they’ll have to deal with all that stuff and I’ll just write,’ and later realizing that’s absolutely not the way it works.”\n\nAccording to Rhimes, she soon learned, “If you are the creative brain, you not only have to share your brain with other people, but also everybody looks to you as the leader. I had to figure out how to be a great leader, and that took a while.”\n\nWhile there’s certainly been drama behind the scenes, read on to see some of the biggest twists and turns throughout \"Grey’s Anatomy\"’s 21 seasons.\n\nPHOTOS \"Grey's Anatomy\"",

        "content": "Lennon Tyler and her German fiancé often took road trips to Mexico when he vacationed in the United States since it was only a day's drive from her home in Las Vegas, one of the perks of their long-distance relationship.\n\nBut things went terribly wrong when they drove back from Tijuana last month.\n\nU.S. border agents handcuffed Tyler, a U.S. citizen, and chained her to a bench, while her fiancé, Lucas Sielaff, was accused of violating the rules of his 90-day U.S. tourist permit, the couple said. Authorities later handcuffed and shackled Sielaff and sent him to a crowded U.S. immigration detention center. He spent 16 days locked up before being allowed to fly home to Germany.\n\nSince President Donald Trump took office, there have been other high-profile incidents of tourists like Sielaff being stopped at U.S. border crossings and held for weeks at U.S. immigration detention facilities before being allowed to fly home at their own expense.\n\nGet top local stories in Philly delivered to you every morning. Sign up for NBC Philadelphia's News Headlines newsletter.\n\nThey include another German tourist who was stopped at the Tijuana crossing on Jan. 25. Jessica Brösche spent over six weeks locked up, including over a week in solitary confinement, a friend said.\n\nOn the Canadian border, a backpacker from Wales spent nearly three weeks at a detention center before flying home this week. And a Canadian woman on a work visa detained at the Tijuana border spent 12 days in detention before returning home last weekend.\n\nSielaff, 25, and the others say it was never made clear why they were taken into custody even after they offered to go home voluntarily.\n\nPedro Rios, director of the American Friends Service Committee, a nonprofit that aids migrants, said in the 22 years he has worked on the border he has never seen travelers from Western Europe and Canada, longtime U.S. allies, locked up like this.\n\n“It’s definitely unusual with these cases so close together, and the rationale for detaining these people doesn’t make sense,” he said. “It doesn’t justify the abhorrent treatment and conditions” they endured.\n\nChief Justice John Roberts issued a rare statement Tuesday rebuking President Donald Trump and his allies for calling to impeach judges who have ruled against his administration.\n\n“The only reason I see is there is a much more fervent anti-immigrant atmosphere,\" Rios said.\n\nU.S. authorities did not respond to a request from The Associated Press for figures on how many tourists have been held at detention facilities or explain why they weren't simply denied entry.\n\nThe incidents are fueling anxiety as the Trump administration prepares for a ban on travelers from some countries. Noting the “evolving” federal travel policies, the University of California, Los Angeles sent a notice this week urging its foreign-born students and staff to consider the risks of non-essential travel for spring break, warning “re-entry requirements may change while you are away, impacting your return.”\n\nImmigration and Customs Enforcement said in an email to the AP that Sielaff and Brösche, who was held for 45 days, “were deemed inadmissible” by Customs and Border Protection. That agency said it cannot discuss specifics but “if statutes or visa terms are violated, travelers may be subject to detention and removal.\" The agencies did not comment on the other cases.\n\nBoth German tourists were allowed into the United States under a waiver program offered to a select group of countries, mostly in Europe and Asia, whose citizens are allowed to travel to the U.S. for business or leisure for up to 90 days without getting a visa in advance. Applicants register online with the Electronic System for Travel Authorization.\n\nBut even if they are authorized to travel under that system, they can still be barred from entering the country.\n\nSielaff arrived in the U.S. on Jan. 27. He and Tyler decided to go to Tijuana for four days in mid-February because Tyler's dog needed surgery and veterinary services are cheaper there. They figured they would enjoy some tacos and make a fun trip out of it.\n\n“Mexico is a wonderful and beautiful country that Lucas and I love to visit,” Tyler said.\n\nThey returned Feb. 18, just 22 days into Sielaff's 90-day tourist permit.\n\nWhen they pulled up to the crossing, the U.S. border agent asked Sielaff aggressively, “Where are you going? Where do you live?” Tyler said.\n\n“English is not Lucas' first language and so he said, ‘We’re going to Las Vegas,' and the agent says, ’Oh, we caught you. You live in Las Vegas. You can't do that,'\" Tyler said, recounting what happened.\n\nSielaff was taken away for more questioning. Tyler said she asked to go with him or if he could get a translator and was told to be quiet, then taken out of her car and handcuffed and chained to a bench. Her dog, recovering from surgery, was left in the car.\n\nAfter four hours, Tyler was allowed to leave but said she was given no information about her fiancé’s whereabouts.\n\nThe Alien Enemies Act is a rarely used 1798 law which allows the president to imprison and deport non-citizens in time of war. Here’s what you need to know.\n\nDuring questioning, Sielaff said he told authorities he never lived in the U.S. and had no criminal history. He said he was given a full-body search and ordered to hand over his cellphone and belongings. He was put in a holding cell where he slept on a bench for two days before being transferred to the Otay Mesa Detention Center in San Diego.\n\nThere, he said, he shared a cell with eight others.\n\n“You are angry, you are sad, you don’t know when you can get out,” Sielaff said. “You just don’t get any answers from anybody.”\n\nHe was finally told to get a direct flight to Germany and submit a confirmation number. In a frantic call from Sielaff, Tyler bought it for $2,744. He flew back March 5.\n\n“What happened at the border was just blatant abuse of the Border Patrol’s power,” Tyler said.\n\nAshley Paschen agrees. She said she learned about Brösche from a TikTok video asking anyone in the San Diego area for help after her family learned she was being held at the Otay Mesa Detention Center. Paschen visited her several times and told her people were working to get her out. Brosche flew home March 11.\n\n“She’s happy to be home,” Paschen said. “She seems very relieved if anything but she’s not coming back here anytime soon.”\n\nOn Feb. 26, a tourist from Wales, Becky Burke, a backpacker on a trip across North America, was stopped at the U.S.-Canada border and held for nearly three weeks at a detention facility in Washington state, her father, Paul Burke, posted on Facebook. She returned home Tuesday.\n\nOn March 3, Canadian Jasmine Mooney, an actress and entrepreneur who had a visa to work in the U.S., was detained at the Tijuana crossing. She was released Saturday, her friend Brittany Kors said.\n\nBefore Mooney's release, British Columbia Premier David Eby expressed concern, saying, “It certainly reinforces anxiety that many British Columbians have, and many Canadians have, about our relationship with the U.S. right now, and the unpredictability of this administration and its actions.\"\n\nThe detentions come amid legal fights over the Trump administration's arrests and deportations of other foreigners with valid visas and green card holders, including a Palestinian activist who helped organize campus protests of the war in Gaza.\n\nTyler plans to sue the U.S. government.\n\nSielaff said he and Tyler are now rethinking plans to hold their wedding in Las Vegas. He suffers nightmares and is considering therapy to cope with the trauma.\n\n“Nobody is safe there anymore to come to America as a tourist,” he said.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Rob Gillies reported from Toronto.",

        "content": "Hundreds of Venezuelans who were deported to El Salvador from the United States in recent days could face long or indefinite detention in a prison system rife with human rights abuses, according to attorneys and experts on the region.\n\nTheir families and lawyers fear there will be no recourse for them to return to the United States for scheduled immigration hearings or even return to their native Venezuela — all while those who spoke to NBC News continue to insist their loved ones and clients have no criminal histories or gang ties.\n\nThe Trump administration has said those who were sent to El Salvador had ties to the Venezuelan gang known as Tren de Aragua.\n\n“We have no idea if there is any legal process by which we can challenge this, either in El Salvador or the United States,” said Lindsay Toczylowski, an attorney who represents a Venezuelan man in his early 30s who was seeking asylum from persecution for being gay and for his political activism against Nicolás Maduro's government. “This is the grossest human rights violation I have seen.”\n\nGet top local stories in Philly delivered to you every morning.

(Salvadoran Government handout / Getty Images)\n\nToczylowski said that her client is not a gang member and that he was deported without her knowledge, adding that days later, she was told he had been sent to El Salvador. She now fears he faces indefinite detention in \"a potentially extremely dangerous situation.\"\n\nToczylowski, who is the CEO of Immigrant Defenders Law Center, a law firm that works with immigrants, asked that her client not be named out of concern for his safety. He is scheduled to have a hearing next month in his ongoing immigration case to remain in the United States and has no criminal history, she said.\n\nThe Trump administration over the weekend invoked the rarely used Alien Enemies Act from 1798, which allows the president to deport noncitizens during wartime. It announced that it had removed hundreds of Venezuelan immigrants it alleged were members of a gang, flying them from the United States to El Salvador, where they were taken to a notorious megaprison.\n\nAccording to the Salvadoran government, the immigrants were sent to a megaprison known as the Terrorism Confinement Center, or CECOT, for a one-year term that is “renewable.” The Trump administration has said it would pay El Salvador $6 million to imprison about 300 people it alleged were members of the Tren de Aragua gang for one year.\n\nThe White House said in a statement Tuesday that it was “confident in DHS intelligence assessments on these gang affiliations and criminality,” referring to the Department of Homeland Security, adding that the Venezuelan immigrants who were removed had final orders of deportation. The Trump administration has not released evidence that those sent to El Salvador have criminal histories or gang ties.\n\nSome families and attorneys strongly deny that the Venezuelan immigrants are connected to Tren de Aragua. They say their family members have been falsely accused and targeted because of their tattoos.\n\nToczylowski said she has been unable to reach her client. She said Immigration and Customs Enforcement told her this week it would not facilitate communication between her and her client, nor would it facilitate his return to the United States for his ongoing asylum case.\n\nThe Trump administration said it would pay El Salvador $6 million to imprison about 300 people alleged to be members of the Tren de Aragua gang for one year. (Salvadoran Government handout / Getty Images)\n\nICE did not immediately respond to requests for comment about those claims and whether it was helping facilitate communication or assistance for anyone sent to El Salvador who had open immigration cases and thus did not have final orders of deportation.\n\nThe exact conditions for those imprisoned in CECOT are widely unknown, as human rights groups are not permitted into it and the media is rarely granted access.\n\nLast year, CNN reported during a visit to CECOT that cells appeared built to hold roughly 80 inmates and that men were held there for 23.5 hours a day. CNN added that the cells had tiered metal bunks with no sheets, pillows or mattresses, as well as open toilets and plastic buckets for washing.\n\nHuman rights organizations such as Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International have documented extreme crowding, torture and other issues at the prison and others in the country.\n\nThe groups have documented years of human rights abuses in the Salvadoran prison system, as well as indefinite detention without access to due process. In recent years, President Nayib Bukele has used emergency powers to suspend certain fundamental rights and allow the arrests of tens of thousands of people suspected to be members of street gangs. More than 80,000 people have been arrested since the order.\n\nLast year, the human rights organization Cristosal reported that at least 261 people have died in Salvadoran prisons since 2022.\n\nBukele has bragged about his country's system of mass incarceration. \"World’s highest incarceration rate / safest country in the Western Hemisphere It’s not rocket science,\" he wrote on X in February 2024.\n\nJuanita Goebertus Estrada, the director of the Americas Division of Human Rights Watch, said, “We can very firmly say that the Salvadoran prison system is no place for migrants.” The organization, which has been doing field work in El Salvador for years, published two recent reports on prison conditions there.\n\n“We’ve documented cases of torture, of ill treatment, of malnutrition, of lack of access to medical services,” she said. “We have documented very severe cases of restriction to due process. In CECOT in particular, people that have gone in have not come out.”\n\nThe immigrants were sent to a megaprison known as the Terrorism Confinement Center for one-year terms that are “renewable.” (Handout / Salvadoran Government handout / Getty Images)\n\nBukele and his administration have promised to make sure anyone who enters CECOT would never return to their communities.\n\nThe experts and lawyers say they are gravely concerned that the immigrants will be denied due process, both in terms of how they were removed from the United States and in their ongoing immigration cases in the United States, and about their fates as they remain in El Salvador.\n\nAna María Méndez Dardón, the director for Central America at the Washington Office on Latin America, said that “the judiciary system in El Salvador has collapsed” and that it lacks the independence to even properly deal with the issues facing the country’s own citizens, let alone due process concerns for the Venezuelan immigrants recently sent to El Salvador.\n\n“For Bukele, justice means just mass incarceration,” she said.\n\nGoebertus said that because there was no judicial independence in the country and because of the state of emergency, “these people have no recourse in El Salvador.”\n\nMartin Rosenow, an immigration attorney in Miami, said he believes that a Venezuelan asylum-seeker he represents was quietly removed from the United States and is now most likely in the Salvadoran prison system.\n\n“We have not been able to find him anywhere. All signs indicate that he’s there at the CECOT prison. We have no access to him, and we don’t know what’s going on,” he said.\n\nFranco Jose Caraballo Tiapa, 26, a barber and father of two, was in the United States seeking asylum because of political persecution and has no criminal history, Rosenow said. Caraballo Tiapa had been released into the United States with his wife before he was detained after an immigration appointment in February.\n\nThen, on Friday night, he called his wife crying and desperate, saying he was going to be deported, Rosenow said. Rosenow said Caraballo Tiapa’s name disappeared from the list of ICE detainees, which would happen only if his client was released from detention or deported.\n\nThe Trump administration has yet to tell Rosenow where his client is or the circumstances around what happened to him.\n\nICE did not immediately respond to a request for comment about Caraballo Tiapa’s case and whether he was deported and sent to El Salvador.\n\n“My hope rests exclusively on our judicial power to have the enforcement arm of bringing these people back — and I don’t even know if that’s possible,” Rosenow said.\n\nThis story first appeared on NBCNews.com.

Sign up for NBC Philadelphia's News Headlines newsletter.\n\nBefore assuming leadership of the so-called Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, Musk spent around $290 million last year to help propel President Donald Trump back to the White House.\n\nWhile investors snapped up Tesla shares after Trump's victory in November, they've been rushing for the exits of late, pushing the stock's price down by 42% this year. Waves of protests have targeted Tesla facilities in the U.S. and beyond. Other criminal acts of vandalism and arson have targeted Tesla stores, vehicles and charging stations across the U.S.\n\nIn addition, Tesla is facing increased competition from EV makers. In January, S&P Global Mobility found Tesla sales declined about 11% year over year in the U.S., while Ford, Chevrolet and Volkswagen bolstered their sales of EVs, picking up market share.\n\n\"Shifts in Tesla consumer sentiment could create an opportunity for legacy automakers and EV startups to gain ground,\" Jessica Caldwell, head of insights at Edmunds, wrote in an email. \"As Tesla brand loyalty and interest wavers, those offering competitive pricing, new technology, or simply less controversy could capture defecting Tesla owners and first-time EV buyers.\"\n\nThe Tesla brand, more than that of any other automaker, is tightly tied to its CEO. In August 2024, Edmunds surveys found that just 2% of car shoppers in the U.S. were unfamiliar with Musk.\n\nEdmunds also said that shopping for new models of Tesla vehicles on its platform dropped to its lowest level last month since October 2022 after peaking as late as November.\n\nEven before Musk began heading up DOGE, Tesla's brand was suffering. Its brand value fell by 26%, or about $15 billion, in 2024, a second straight annual decline, according to research and consulting firm Brand Finance.\n\nMany car shoppers trade in their Tesla EVs for a newer model Tesla.

Sign up for NBC Philadelphia's News Headlines newsletter.\n\nNFL owners will vote on rule change proposals later this month in Palm Beach, Florida, at the annual league meetings. It would take 24 of 32 votes to change any rule. Last month at the NFL Combine, the sense was that this particular proposal wouldn’t have enough support, but we’ll see.\n\nThe proposal from Green Bay cites “player safety” and “pace of play.” But the NFL has released its data from the 2024 season, saying zero players were injured from the play in the last season. And without a legitimate player safety concern, it’s difficult to imagine the play in this form being banned.\n\nLast month, Eagles head coach Nick Sirianni spoke strongly about the Brotherly Shove.\n\n“I think when you look at that, because we've looked into that too, there weren’t a lot of injuries there,” Sirianni said. “I think that's a little made up, to be honest. Now the numbers will tell the truth, but I don't think there were many injuries with it this year.\n\n“I mean, I can't remember one injury we had on that play, and we ran it more than everybody else. And so, yeah, the injury numbers, the league will have that, and the injury numbers will come out on that, and I'm all for player safety, but I don't think that that play (is dangerous). I think that's just something that was said.”\n\nSirianni also said it’s insulting to hear the Tush Push called an “automatic play” because of how hard they have worked to perfect it. Other teams have not been nearly as successful with it.\n\nEagles propose a change\n\nThe Eagles have also proposed a rule change for the 2025 season that would extend the NFL’s overtime rules in the playoffs to the regular season, “by granting both teams an opportunity to possess the ball regardless of the outcome of the first possession, subject to a 15-minute overtime period in the regular season.”\n\nBasically, this rule would create a 15-minute overtime in the regular season with both teams given the chance to possess the ball even if the first team scores a touchdown.\n\nThis proposal has a chance to pass as NFL executive VP of football operations Troy Vincent has said the NFL’s competition committee agrees that OT rules need to be revamped.\n\nOther proposals\n\n• The Detroit Lions proposed a rule change that would eliminate automatic first downs for defensive holding or illegal contact, saying the current penalty enforcement is “too punitive for the defense.”\n\n• The Lions also proposed a bylaw change that would change the playoff seeding format to allow Wild Card teams to be seeded higher than division winners. For example, both NFC Wild Card teams in 2024 (Vikings, Commanders) had better records than the winners of the NFC South and NFC West.\n\n• The Lions were busy. They also proposed a bylaw change that would exclude players put on IR before or on the day of roster reduction to 53 from the 90-man roster unless the player is designated for return.\n\nSubscribe to Eagle Eye anywhere you get your podcasts:\n\nApple Podcasts | YouTube Music | Spotify | Stitcher | Simplecast | RSS | Watch on YouTube",

        "content": "Raphael Garcia, an analyst at the Department of Veterans Affairs who was abruptly fired last month amid President Donald Trump’s sweeping push to shrink the federal workforce, learned this week that he was being reinstated following court orders from two federal judges.\n\nBut that news did not end the professional limbo that has defined Garcia’s life for over a month. He is not actually back on the job. Instead, he has been placed on administrative leave while the Trump administration appeals rulings from those two judges.\n\nGarcia has received verbal reassurance that he’ll get back pay while he’s on leave, but the whiplash of Trump’s first 100 days in office has not exactly left him in a trusting state of mind. “I’ll believe it when I see it,” Garcia told NBC News in an interview this week, adding that he won’t know whether his salary has restarted until the end of the pay period in late March.\n\nGarcia is one of 24,000 probationary federal workers who have been on a career roller-coaster ride as Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency attempts to reshape the federal bureaucracy. These workers have been unceremoniously fired and rehired, but some remain in the dark about what comes next.\n\nGet top local stories in Philly delivered to you every morning. Sign up for NBC Philadelphia's News Headlines newsletter.\n\nIn many cases, the rehired probationary workers — meaning people who have held their positions for less than two years — were immediately placed on administrative leave, a temporary suspension with pay intact. Meanwhile, civil servants still face the looming prospect of more rounds of firings in the months and years ahead.\n\n“Honestly, I don’t fully trust this administration and its appointees on whether or not I’ll get to go back to work,” said a Federal Emergency Management Agency employee who was fired, rehired and placed on leave. “I’ve been out of work for a full month.”\n\nIn an email notifying him that he had been temporarily reinstated, the FEMA employee was told he would get a call this week from his agency’s human capital department to discuss benefits and paperwork for getting him back on the job. But he said he hasn’t heard from anyone yet.\n\nThe employee, who spoke on the condition of anonymity due to fear of reprisal, said he has had no choice but to start looking for other jobs.\n\n“I’d rather continue my work for FEMA and the American people,” he said. But “if I pass on another opportunity, but then get terminated again in a couple weeks, it could make a bad situation even worse.”\n\nThe employee took a skeptical view of Trump’s political appointees. “They have already broken my confidence and trust. It’s hard to know where we go from here. … It’s so confusing and so chaotic.”\n\nIn interviews, federal employees said they had found that agencies subject to the judges’ orders were not communicating the latest developments to their workers in a uniform way. In some instances, reinstated probationary workers have received email notifications; in other instances, they’ve gotten phone calls from managers or supervisors.\n\nSarah Boim, a probationary employee at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention who was fired in February, said she had not received a reinstatement notice as of Thursday. She now finds herself in an employment Catch-22, wondering if her reinstatement notice was sent to a CDC email account she lost access to after she was fired.\n\n“We need transparency. We’re being lied to. It’s unacceptable,” she said.\n\nIn an interview, an employee at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau said she believes the Trump administration intends to “honor this reinstatement” only for as long as its mass firing initiatives are blocked by federal judges.\n\n“It’s all just so clearly in bad faith,” said the CFPB employee, who also spoke on the condition of anonymity due to fear of professional repercussions.\n\nThe federal government has acknowledged that some reinstated employees will confront various hurdles before they’re up and running at work. In court filings accompanying the Justice Department’s appeal of the reinstatement orders, federal officials argued that restoring “removed employees to full duty status would impose substantial burdens” on various agencies, “cause significant confusion, and cause turmoil for the terminated employees.”\n\n“Specifically, all employees offered reinstatement into full duty status would have to be onboarded again, including going through any applicable training, filling out human resources paperwork, obtaining new security badges, re-enrolling in benefits programs and payroll, reinstituting applicable security clearance actions, receiving government furnished equipment, and other requisite administrative actions,” the director of human capital operations at the Environmental Protection Agency said in one such filing.\n\nGarcia, the Veterans Affairs employee, said he does not view any of these administrative tasks as burdens. He is eager to get back to his job and help his agency deal with the mounting workload that he said has been caused by staff cuts.\n\n“It definitely does not cause us turmoil to be reinstated,” Garcia said. “I loved what I did. I’m a disabled veteran and I know the struggles of transitioning out of the military.”\n\n\"The real turmoil was being initially terminated” and being unable “to serve my fellow veteran community,” he added.\n\nThis story first appeared on NBCNews.com.

But I was happy to be able to make it back to play with my guys, to put that uniform on one last time in a big moment, big stage. To where we went out there and performed.”\n\nAfter missing the last six games of the regular season and the first three playoff games with that torn triceps, suffering against the Rams in L.A. in late November, Graham made it back on the field for the Super Bowl and played 13 snaps – 13 productive snaps – in the Eagles’ 40-22 win over the Chiefs.\n\nHe also tore his triceps again, although he’ll tell you it was well worth it to be part of the second championship of his career.\n\n“I felt like me being able to be a part of that, that was all I needed to know (to retire),” he said. “I felt like my prayers was answered being able to come back and be with them boys one last time.\n\n\"And I didn't know how it was gonna be, for real. I mean, we won and of course the competitor in me wanted to come back. But I know this, I couldn't ask for nothing sweeter than this. And I’m thankful to have come back and to be able to play my last game like my coach said with some integrity and play good, at that.\n\n“So I can always hang my hat on that where I played good in my last game, went out on my own terms and went out a champion.\"\n\nOne thing Graham is sure about is that even though his playing days are over, he’s not leaving football.\n\nHe doesn’t know exactly what his future will look like, but he does know he’ll be around the NovaCare Complex.\n\nDoing something.\n\nThe Eagles have a long history of hiring their former players in various roles working in the front office or scouting department, helping out the coaching staff or in a support role for players.\n\nAfter 15 years and two Lombardi trophies with the Eagles, Graham has a ton to offer.\n\n“I want to sit down and talk to Mr. (Jeff) Lurie, have some dinner with him and so we’re going to do that and figure out what I could do to be a part of what's going on,” he said. “Because I feel like we’ve got some good stuff brewing right now and I want to make sure that I can be a help in whatever it is that I do. And then, of course, I want to be creative on, I ain't got to be all in one basket, have everything all in one, but just kind of move around.\n\n“I don't want to just cold turkey leave the game, because I love it. I love just the intensity of it.”\n\nDoes the end of his playing career mean the end of his legendary track talking? No way.\n\n“Now I can send my goons out (to do it),” he said with a laugh. “I got a little different lingo I'm going to say to these guys on the field because of course I got to talk my stuff. I can't do nothing about it but I can send Nolan (Smith) out there to go do it.\n\n“I'm going to do it in practice, too. I'm going to be a part of something that they got going on where I can come in and even if I'm just coming to practice, I can always tell the offensive line what I would have done if I was still out there.”\n\nSubscribe to Eagle Eye anywhere you get your podcasts:\n\nApple Podcasts | YouTube Music | Spotify | Stitcher | Simplecast | RSS | Watch on YouTube",

        "source": "https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/",
        "content": "President Donald Trump signed an executive order Thursday in an effort to “begin eliminating the federal Department of Education.” With the stroke of his pen, he officially set in motion a plan to shutter the 46-year-old agency, as he said, “once and for all.”\n\nBut the order stops short of immediately closing the department, which cannot be done without congressional approval. Rather, according to the text of the order released by the White House, it directs Education Secretary Linda McMahon to “take all necessary steps to facilitate the closure of the Department of Education and return authority over education to the States and local communities while ensuring the effective and uninterrupted delivery of services, programs, and benefits on which Americans rely.”\n\nFollow live politics coverage here.\n\nAt the signing, Trump said federal Pell Grants (a common type of federal undergraduate financial aid), Title I funding and resources and funding for children with disabilities would be “preserved in full and redistributed to various other agencies and departments.”\n\nGet top local stories in Philly delivered to you every morning. Sign up for NBC Philadelphia's News Headlines newsletter.\n\n“But beyond these core necessities, my administration will take all lawful steps to shut down the department,” he said, adding that he’d do so “as quickly as possible.”\n\nThe move still promises to upend the key functions the department performs in the broader education system, which include oversight of the federal student loan portfolio, civil rights enforcement in schools and the distribution of billions of dollars to help impoverished and disabled students.\n\nSeveral big questions about the Department of Education’s future remain unanswered. But there is still a significant amount known about the agency’s history and duties — as well as the many plans conservatives have circulated for decades to unwind the agency.\n\nWhat does the Department of Education do?\n\nIn 1979, Democratic President Jimmy Carter signed legislation that made the Department of Education a Cabinet-level agency. Until that point, the government had a Department of Health, Education and Welfare, created during the Eisenhower administration.\n\nConservatives have been clamoring to abolish it for more than 40 years — essentially since it was created. Carter’s successor, President Ronald Reagan, vowed to shut it down one year after it opened — and Republicans have basically repeated that call since.\n\nThe Education Department is one of the smallest Cabinet-level departments. Its $268 billion appropriation last year represented 4% of the U.S. budget. McMahon announced earlier this month a plan to cut roughly half of the agency’s staff.\n\nAmong its most prominent duties, the agency manages the $1.6 trillion federal student loan portfolio for college and postsecondary students. It also distributes billions of dollars in funding for K-12 schools through programs that serve more than 50 million students in nearly 100,000 public schools and 32,000 private schools.\n\nThat funding includes more than $15 billion for thousands of so-called Title I schools — schools that receive federal dollars to help low-income families. And it includes more than $15 billion in funding for programs — under the auspices of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), which provides grants to states for the education of children with disabilities — that ensure disabled students have access to a free and appropriate public education.\n\nThe Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights enforces laws aiming to prevent discrimination in schools, and the agency’s Institute of Education Sciences runs data collection, statistics and research monitoring student outcomes.\n\nThe vast balance of power on education, however, still lies with states and local districts, which fund the bulk of K-12 education and set all curriculums.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Education has no say in curriculum matters. It does not set requirements for enrollment and graduation in schools, nor does it have a say in the selection or use of school or library books, textbooks or resources.\n\nSchools that receive federal money through Title I programs and IDEA must meet specific conditions and maintain specific reporting rules. Conservatives have long claimed that those requirements are arduous and have pushed for allowing states to have flexibility and freedom to spend the money as they wish.\n\nWhat would it look like to wind down the Education Department?\n\nEven though Trump cannot fully end the Department of Education himself, McMahon agreed at her confirmation hearing that the administration hopes to present a plan that Congress would support, and Republicans in the House have introduced various plans that seek to eliminate the department. Still, with narrow Republican majorities in the House and Senate, it’s unlikely to move forward.\n\nYet short of that, the administration has other ways to shrink the department’s footprint.\n\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said ahead of the executive order’s signing that “critical programs will be protected” and that, specifically, student loans and federal Pell Grants would continue to be handled by the department. In addition, a senior administration official said Wednesday night that Title I, student loans and students with disabilities — who rely on IDEA funding — will not be affected.\n\nBut it remains unclear how existing services would not be interrupted as the agency is dismantled.\n\nEducation advocates have long warned that major cutbacks would dramatically affect the federal government’s enormous student loan portfolio and Title I and IDEA funding. What these cuts would mean for groups who rely on that funding remains one of the biggest questions to emerge after news first broke that the Trump White House was looking to eliminate the agency.\n\nOne possibility is that the new framework for education policy could take its cues from the many plans that conservative education activists have circulated for decades on how they’d like to see the department disemboweled. Those plans largely center on transferring key functions of the department to other federal agencies, even though some education experts contend that even those transfers would require congressional approval.\n\nOne House bill introduced in January by Rep. David Rouzer, R-N.C., proposes transferring most of the department’s responsibilities to other agencies. Student loan programs would go to the Treasury Department, for example, and job training programs to the Labor Department.\n\nThe bill also proposes that the federal government be allowed to provide nearly all other education funding it currently gives to states with almost no conditions or reporting requirements attached.\n\nOne plan from February touted by officials at the conservative Manhattan Institute for Policy Research pushed for transferring civil rights enforcement issues in public schools to the Civil Rights Division of the U.S. Department of Justice.\n\nEducation advocates have warned that moving those responsibilities to the DOJ would likely result in fewer investigations and less enforcement, because it would mean saddling a smaller team with even more responsibilities. The Justice Department also has discretion in which cases it investigates, whereas the Education Department is required to investigate complaints alleging discrimination within the past 180 days. (The Trump administration’s layoffs at the Education Department earlier this month greatly impacted the agency’s Office for Civil Rights.)\n\nThat plan also advocated for spinning off the federal student loan portfolio into an independent financial entity.\n\nMeanwhile, Project 2025 — which pushed for abolishing the whole agency — also advocated for ending Title I funding in phases. It also proposes ending student debt cancellation programs.\n\nOther advocates for conservative education policy have said the federal government should convert most of the funding it gives to states for K-12 programs into block grants, a form of funding that comes with fewer rules and less federal oversight.\n\nBut public education advocates have warned that kind of shift could allow red states to pour dollars into private schools, which do not have to abide by federal education civil rights laws.\n\nUnder some other GOP proposals, Title I funding for the poorest schools would shift to allow poor students to take that money to private schools if they choose.\n\nIn February, a dozen top education officials from GOP-controlled states pitched McMahon on giving out federal school funding as block grants. Those Republicans said they wanted to be allowed to shift funding to support “state-driven initiatives” and “alternative spending approaches,” and asked McMahon to grant them waivers on certain federal requirements that come with their allocations. Red states typically rely more heavily on federal education funding than blue ones.\n\nPrivate schools that do not receive federal funding are exempt from civil rights laws, such as those barring discrimination based on a student’s race, gender or disability. Private academies also do not have to provide individualized education plans to children with learning disabilities. It’s unclear whether any of the federal civil rights protections overseen by the Department of Education would apply if states used federal dollars to support private K-12 schools under their proposed block grant schemes.\n\nThis story first appeared on NBCNews.com.

The man was not handcuffed at the time since he was voluntarily going to the hospital, according to Bethel.\n\nA police officer was saved by his bulletproof vest after being shot by a suspect he was transporting to a hospital in Northeast Philadelphia, officials said. The officer's partner shot and killed the suspect. Both officers were treated and released from the hospital. NBC10's Siobhan McGirl gives an update.\n\nThe police vehicle arrived outside the hospital on the 4600 block of Roosevelt Boulevard around 12:50 p.m., investigators said. As the officers let the man out and began telling him where to go, the man became combative and attacked them, according to Bethel.\n\nThe man -- who police have not yet identified -- was hit with a taser, but Bethel said he continued to fight with both officers as they all fell to the ground.\n\nIn a scramble, the man took one officer's gun and began to fire, shooting one of the officers at the very bottom edge of his bulletproof vest, according to Bethel.\n\nThe officer's partner opened fire, Bethel said, striking the man who stole the firearm several times.\n\nBoth officers and the man were taken to nearby hospitals. The officers were treated and later released while the man was pronounced dead shortly after the shooting, according to Bethel.\n\nTwo Philadelphia police officers are recovering after gunfire broke out while they were transporting a man to a hospital. Investigators are crediting the bulletproof vest of one of the police officers for saving his life. NBC10's Lili Zheng has the details from police headquarters.\n\nThe officer who survived the shooting is 30-years-old and a six-year veteran of the Philadelphia police force, according to Bethel. His partner is 37-years-old and a 10-year veteran.\n\nWhile speaking with the press outside Temple University Hospital, where the officers were treated, Philadelphia Mayor Cherelle Parker said that the incident could have been much worse.\n\n\"The officer was wearing his ballistic vest when he was shot,\" Mayor Parker said. \"Now all of our officers are required to wear their vest. And in this instance, the shot that hit the officer's vest was close to the bottom of his vest. But for an inch, we could be here right now with a very different set of circumstances and facts.\"\n\nThe shooting occurred a day after an incident in which police shot a man who they say was walking around with a rifle in South Philadelphia. That man was taken to the hospital and placed in critical condition.",

        "content": "Arlando “Tray” Jones was a toddler when his dad was killed by Baltimore police during a robbery. His mom died several years later after battling alcoholism.\n\nHis surviving relatives often struggled to provide for him. Sometimes the lights got turned off and the refrigerator was empty.\n\nJones turned to a notorious neighborhood drug dealer, a sinister father figure whose lavish lifestyle demonstrated what could be achieved in the streets. Under the supervision of “Fat Larry,” Jones finally had stable housing and money in his pocket, but violence was all around him. He started carrying a gun and punishing anyone who crossed him. Barely a teenager, he was charged with attempted murder and sent to juvenile detention in the early 1980s.\n\nThere, at the Maryland Training School for Boys, Jones says a staff member repeatedly sexually assaulted him while another kept watch. The guards would corner children in dark spaces and bribe them with extra snacks and other special treatment, according to a slew of recent lawsuits alleging widespread misconduct in Maryland’s juvenile detention facilities.\n\nGet top local stories in Philly delivered to you every morning. Sign up for NBC Philadelphia's News Headlines newsletter.\n\n“They broke me,” Jones said, recounting how his abusers beat him into submission. “Everything that connected me to my humanity was just gone.”\n\nJones is among thousands of people seeking accountability under a new state law that eliminated the statute of limitations for child sexual abuse claims. It was passed in 2023 with the Catholic Church abuse scandal in mind. But now Maryland lawmakers are scrambling to address an unexpected onslaught of cases targeting the state’s juvenile justice system. They’re worried the state budget can’t support a potential payout.\n\nThe Associated Press requested an interview with the state’s Department of Juvenile Services, but the department responded with a statement instead.\n\n“DJS takes allegations of sexual abuse of children in our care with utmost seriousness and we are working hard to provide decent, humane and rehabilitative environments for youth committed to the Department. We do not comment on pending litigation,” the agency said.\n\nTo the plaintiffs, it’s no surprise that Maryland leaders failed to anticipate a public reckoning of this size. Many victims spent decades in silence, paralyzed by shame. They were some of Maryland’s most vulnerable residents, mostly Black kids growing up in poverty with little family support.\n\nAll these years later, Jones still broke down crying in an interview. “But now I know the shame is not mine to bear,” he said.\n\nA law with unexpected consequences\n\nMaryland lawmakers passed the Child Victims Act in the immediate aftermath of a scathing investigative report that revealed widespread abuse within the Archdiocese of Baltimore. Before its passage, victims couldn’t sue after they turned 38.\n\nThe law change prompted the archdiocese to file for bankruptcy to protect its assets. But state leaders didn’t anticipate they’d be facing similar budgetary concerns. Lawmakers are now considering new legislation to shield the state financially.\n\nAn estimated 6,000 people have retained attorneys and new complaints are pouring in, according to lawyers involved. In addition to monetary damages, plaintiffs want mandated reform of Maryland’s juvenile justice system.\n\nThe system has drawn serious criticism over the years. A 2004 Justice Department report found a “deeply disturbing degree of physical abuse” at the facility where Jones was detained, now called the Charles H. Hickey Jr. School. The state closed Hickey’s youth treatment program in 2005, but it’s still operating as a youth detention center.\n\nMany other facilities named in the lawsuits have already been closed, and state leaders have strengthened oversight in recent years. They’ve also focused on detaining fewer youths.\n\nAdvocates say they’re confident the system is significantly less abusive than it was.\n\nOther states have faced similar reckonings after changing their laws. While juvenile arrests and detention rates are declining nationally, research shows the majority of detainees are children of color. A 2024 report from the nonprofit The Sentencing Project found Black youth are roughly five times more likely to be incarcerated than their white peers.\n\n“It’s not just in Maryland, it’s everywhere,” said attorney Corey Stern, who represents Jones and others. “It’s really a ripple effect across the U.S.”\n\nSystemic abuse all over the state\n\nStill, the Maryland lawsuits paint a particularly disturbing picture. It wasn’t just select facilities or a small group of abusive staff members, it was statewide and persisted for decades, attorneys say. The abuse was often a poorly kept secret, but the system repeatedly failed to stop it, the lawsuits say.\n\nIn a complaint filed earlier this month, 69 people brought claims against the same abuser, a former housing supervisor at Hickey.\n\nOne of the plaintiffs in that case, who asked to remain anonymous, said that as the abuse escalated, he started to avoid properly cleaning himself to become less desirable. He later spent decades struggling with addiction and mental health issues. He said suing the state “even now felt like I was snitching.” The AP doesn’t typically identify victims of abuse unless they want to be named.\n\nNalisha Gibbs said she didn’t initially report her abuse because no one would have listened. A past experience gave her proof of that.\n\nNot long before she went to juvenile detention over a missed curfew enforced by a school truancy officer, Gibbs said, she had been raped by an uncle — and punished by her mother when she didn’t keep quiet about the abuse.\n\nIn the detention center, a female guard would come to her cell at night and assault her. Gibbs said the woman would degrade her, calling her worthless and “a throwaway.”\n\nFor coming home 15 minutes after curfew, she was sentenced to a lifetime of trauma.\n\nAfter 30 days in detention, Gibbs never went back to middle school. She ended up in foster care, where she suffered more sexual abuse. She spent most of her 20s addicted to drugs, sometimes living on the streets. But in 2008, she sought treatment. She enrolled in a transitional housing program and earned her GED. She now lives with her fiancé and his mother.\n\nThinking back on her childhood, she sees a scared little girl who needed an adult to stand up for her.\n\n“She just had so much life snuffed out by people mistreating her and mishandling her,” Gibbs said through tears. “But I’m not that little girl anymore. I can fight for myself.”\n\nPushed over the edge\n\nA couple years after being released from Hickey, Jones was involved in a fight over drugs that escalated into gunshots, killing Joshua O’Neal.\n\nJones was 16 when he was arrested and charged with murder. He was later convicted and sentenced to life in prison.\n\nHe said the sexual abuse pushed him over the edge; if he was headed down a negative path before juvenile detention, that experience sent him hurtling toward the unchecked brutality of the drug game.\n\nIn 2022, he was released from prison under a state law that allows sentence reductions for people convicted as children.\n\nDuring his incarceration, Jones earned a bachelor’s degree in psychology. He’s studied philosophy and published two books. Now 56, he works at Georgetown University’s Prisons and Justice Initiative, which teaches students about mass incarceration and prison reform.\n\nHe said getting educated restored some of the humanity he lost. It helped him regain his freedom and gave him a second chance at life. It also made him question everything.\n\n“An orphan child surviving poverty as best I can,” he said. “Where was my first chance?”\n\n——\n\nAssociated Press reporter Brian Witte in Annapolis contributed to this report.",

It's dissociative and euphoric,\" she said.\n\nDr. Cavello said her office has seen nitrous oxide cases nearly triple since 2021.\n\n\"We do get calls about patients who use a lot of nitrous every day and, for example, develop neurological problems or spinal cord degeneration.\"\n\nNitrous oxide is legitimately used as a sedative for dental or medical procedures and is often used in restaurants to make whipped cream.\n\nIn Pennsylvania, it is illegal to use it for intoxication and sell it if there's reasonable cause to suspect it is being used by someone to get high.\n\nThe law is rarely enforced.\n\nWe tried to get answers from a half dozen district attorneys none wanted to comment.\n\n\"I have done some testing of trying to order from Amazon with addresses in different states, in some with the most robust laws,\" said Shoenig. \"And they really not, they ask no questions.\"\n\nWe also found nitrous oxide available for purchase on Walmart's website.\n\nIn our area, New Jersey is the only state that requires a permit through the Department of Health to buy, sell, purchase or distribute nitrous.\n\nAn open records request by the investigative team shows only 62 businesses are permitted to sell nitrous for non-medical use.\n\nOur visits to a half dozen smoke shops in Camden County showed the shops we visited complying.\n\n\"One bad decision changed the lives of hundreds of people who were close to Jack. And I hope that we can educate people, so no other family has to go through this,\" said Shoenig.\n\nAmazon released a statement saying that it requires all products offered in its store to comply with applicable laws, regulations and Amazon policies. The company also said it takes action to maintain a safe selection for its customers, including removing non-compliant products.\n\nAt last check, nitrous could still be bought and shipped to New Jersey.\n\nWalmart did not respond to a request for comment by the Investigative Team.",

        "content": "Family identifies man killed in officer-involved shooting in Northeast Philadelphia\n\nPHILADELPHIA (WPVI) -- A man is dead and a police officer was shot in his bulletproof vest during an exchange of gunfire on Thursday afternoon in Northeast Philadelphia.\n\nThe shooting happened around 12:45 p.m. at Friends Hospital in the 4600 block of E. Roosevelt Boulevard.\n\nPhiladelphia officials provide update after officer shot in bulletproof vest on March 20, 2025.\n\nThe bullet did not pass through the officer's vest. Still, the officer was taken to Temple University Hospital to be checked out.\n\nPolice Commissioner Kevin Bethel said it all began around 12:24 p.m. when officers saw a man who was running through traffic naked in the 5000 block of Torresdale Avenue.\n\nThe officers made contact with the man, who officials said was having a mental health episode. Police say the man, who was identified by family as 36-year-old Aaron Rainey, agreed to be voluntarily committed.\n\nRainey was put in the back of a police wagon but was not handcuffed, Bethel said, because he was going voluntarily.\n\nWhen they arrived at Friends Hospital, the officers and the man got out of the wagon.\n\nBethel said that's when the Rainey turned and attacked the officers, and soon the officers were down on the ground with the man.\n\nThe officers tried tasing Rainey, Bethel said, but were not successful.\n\nThe man was then able to get a hold of an officer's weapon. That's when police say gunfire was exchanged between the man and the officer's partner. Rainey was shot multiple times. He was taken to Einstein Hospital where he was pronounced dead.\n\nA police officer was shot in their bulletproof vest on Thursday in Northeast Philadelphia.\n\nThe man's family and friends are mourning his death and demanding answers.\n\n\"I'm still in disbelief. How did it go from there to him being dead?\" said Hester Eurie, a friend and neighbor of Rainey.\n\n\"Mentally, you don't know what he's going to do when he's back there in that van. He could have dug his eyes out. He could have done anything. They should have handcuffed him,\" added Eurie.\n\nThe officer was hit just an inch from the bottom of his bulletproof vest.\n\nIt's unclear at this time if the officer was shot with his own weapon. Police say that is part of the investigation.\n\nThe officer who was shot is 30 years old and has been on the force for six years. His partner is 37 years old and is a 10-year veteran of the force.\n\nRainey was known as a handyman on his street who was always willing to help everyone.\n\nThe names of the officers involved have not been released.",

Donald Trump signs an executive order to dismantle the Department of Education.\n\nA judge blocked Elon Musk's DOGE from accessing private Social Security records, as Pres.

Donald Trump signs an executive order to dismantle the Department of Education.\n\nWASHINGTON -- The Department of Government Efficiency approach's to identifying fraud at the Social Security Administration \"is tantamount to hitting a fly with a sledgehammer,\" a federal judge said Thursday, blocking DOGE's unlimited access to sensitive agency data.\n\nIn a 137-page ruling, U.S. District Judge Ellen Lipton Hollander wrote the Trump administration never justified the need to access the data -- which they argued was vital to identifying alleged fraud -- and likely violated multiple federal laws in doing so.\n\n\"The DOGE Team is essentially engaged in a fishing expedition at SSA, in search of a fraud epidemic, based on little more than suspicion. It has launched a search for the proverbial needle in the haystack, without any concrete knowledge that the needle is actually in the haystack,\" she wrote.\n\nThe judge's order blocks the agency from granting DOGE access to systems containing personally identifiable information and orders DOGE members to destroy any data in their possession that identifies individual taxpayers. However, the judge's decision allows DOGE to continue to allow access anonymized data from the agency.\n\nAccording to Hollander, the decision to give DOGE \"unlimited access to SSA's entire record system\" endangered the sensitive and private information of millions of Americans, risking information including Social Security numbers, credit card information, medical and mental health records, hospitalization records, marriage and birth certificates, and bank information.\n\n\"The government has not even attempted to explain why a more tailored, measured, titrated approach is not suitable to the task,\" she wrote. \"Instead, the government simply repeats its incantation of a need to modernize the system and uncover fraud. Its method of doing so is tantamount to hitting a fly with a sledgehammer.\"\n\nThe lawsuit challenging DOGE's access was filed last month by two national unions and an advocacy group who argued DOGE's access violated privacy laws and the Administrative Procedures Act. In a statement to ABC News, the president of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees celebrated the decision as a \"major win for working people and retirees across the country.\"\n\n\"The court saw that Elon Musk and his unqualified lackeys present a grave danger to Social Security and have illegally accessed the data of millions of Americans,\" AFSCME President Lee Saunders said in a statement.\n\nIn her decision, the judge also pointed out the irony that DOGE has accessed the sensitive information of millions of Americans while the identities of the DOGE employees working in the SSA have been concealed for privacy reasons.\n\n\"The defense does not appear to share a privacy concern for the millions of Americans whose SSA records were made available to the DOGE affiliates, without their consent,\" she wrote.",

        "content": "London's Heathrow Airport closed for the day after a substation fire, disrupting travel\n\nLONDON -- A fire at an electrical substation near London's Heathrow Airport has closed one of the world's busiest airports.\n\nHeathrow Airport said the fire at the substation, which supplies power to the airport, has caused a \"significant power outage\" and the airport is expected to be closed until 11:59 p.m. local time on Friday night.\n\nIn total, 70 firefighters and 10 fire trucks responded to the blaze in west London when the London Fire Brigade brigade was first called at 11:23 p.m. local time. The fire was out more than seven hours later at 6:28 a.m. on Friday morning.\n\n\"This was a very visible and significant incident, and our firefighters worked tirelessly in challenging conditions to bring the fire under control as swiftly as possible,\" Assistant Commissioner Pat Goulbourne said. \"Thanks to their efforts and coordinated multi-agency response, we successfully contained the fire and prevented further spread.\n\n\"We will maintain a presence at the scene throughout the day, assisting the National Grid as they assess the site.\"\n\nFirefighters safely evacuated 29 people from neighboring properties and, as a precaution, a 200-meter cordon was established with around 150 people evacuated.\n\n\"Due to the significant smoke, we strongly advise local residents to keep their windows and doors closed, as some smoke will remain for a number of hours today. Scientific advisors will also be on-site this morning to conduct further assessments and monitor the air quality,\" Goulbourne continued. \"Our Control Officers handled more than 200 emergency calls, providing guidance and reassurance to the public. As the morning progresses, disruption is expected to continue, and we urge people to avoid the area whenever possible.\"\n\nCounter-terror police were on the scene at the Hayes substation, London's Met Police confirmed to ABC News, but they cautioned it's only because they could get the investigation done faster.\n\n\"We are working with the London Fire Brigade to establish the cause of the fire which remains under investigation. While there is currently no indication of foul play we retain an open mind at this time,\" Met Police said in a statement. \"Given the location of the sub-station and the impact this incident has had on critical national infrastructure, the Met's Counter Terrorism Command is now leading enquiries.\"\n\nBritish Airways, which has a hub at Heathrow Airport, said it is advising travelers not to go to the airport and that they are working to notify passengers of their travel options for the next 24 hours and beyond as soon as possible.\n\nMeanwhile, inbound flights to Heathrow are being redirected to other U.K. airports, officials said.\n\n\"Due to a power outage in the London Heathrow area, London Heathrow Airport is currently closed,\" British Airways said. \"As a result, customers due to travel from Heathrow on Friday are advised not to travel to the airport until further notice. This will clearly have a significant impact on our operation and our customers and we're working as quickly as possible to update them on their travel options for the next 24 hours and beyond.\"\n\nThe fire has caused a power outage affecting a large numbers of homes and businesses and led to some evacuations, the fire brigade said. Firefighters led 29 people to safety from neighboring properties and, as a precaution, established a cordon around the area and evacuated about 150 people.\n\n\"This is a highly visible and significant incident, and our firefighters are working tirelessly in challenging conditions to bring the fire under control as swiftly as possible,\" Pat Goulbourne, assistant commissioner of the London Fire Brigade, said in a statement shortly before 2 a.m. local time.\n\nThe cause of the fire is not yet known, the fire brigade said.\n\nThis is a developing story.

However, Jefferson Health is now out-of-network for Cigna members who get insurance through their employers.\n\n\"I feel frustrated and concerned. My wife's healthcare providers are all through Jefferson,\" David Rosenberg, of Fairmount, told Action News. \"She has a number of appointments coming up, including her mammogram.\"\n\nRosenberg says his wife's family has a history of breast cancer, so she is very vigilant about her checkups.\n\nHe received a letter from his children's pediatrician's practice that it is now out-of-network too.\n\nThe Rosenbergs don't feel comfortable switching away from any of their trusted providers.\n\n\"They know our family and they know their medical histories,\" David said.\n\nJefferson Health said rising costs made its previous contract with Cigna unsustainable.\n\n\"Since 2020, Cigna's reimbursement rates have increased only around 3%, while the costs of providing care have increased more than 20%,\" said Dr. Edmund Pribitkin, Jefferson Health's Chief Physician.\n\nCigna claims \"Jefferson Health chose to leave our network due to their unreasonable rate hike demands that would raise health costs for the people we serve.\"\n\nWhat can patients do?\n\n\"The first thing that you can do is pick up the phone, call the insurance company, and ask them if you qualify for something called a continuing care patient,\" said Lisa Gill, with Consumer Reports.\n\nGill says pregnant women and cancer patients are examples of people who could qualify and receive about a 90-day window to continue their care with their current provider.\n\nShe says other patients should ask, \"Will they allow you to at least submit claims that are out-of-network? Would any of it be covered? A lot of plans will cover 40%, 50%, sometimes even more than that.\"\n\nIn the meantime, Jefferson is pleading with patients and providers to contact Cigna directly to express their concerns. Cigna says its customer service advocates are available 24/7 at 1-800-244-6224 and customers can find in-network hospitals and providers on their website or app.\n\nBoth Cigna and Jefferson said they are committed to continuing negotiations and it is still possible they reach an agreement.\n\nSome may remember Tower Health hospitals and doctors were out-of-network for Cigna members for four months last year, but those parties did finally agree to a new contract.\n\nAction News will keep you posted on what happens in the case of Cigna and Jefferson Health.\n\nCigna Healthcare's full statement to Action News:\"Unfortunately Jefferson Health chose to leave our network due to their unreasonable rate hike demands that would raise health costs for the people we serve. Almost all our employer clients' benefits plans are self-funded, which means any increase in cost of care is paid directly by local employers, their employees and their families. We will continue to negotiate with Jefferson Health to reach a fair agreement that will keep health care affordable for patients. Our customer service advocates are available 24/7/365 to ease the transition and guide patients to high-quality, local in-network care.\"\n\nJefferson Health's full statement: \"Despite our best efforts to reach a fair agreement, Jefferson Health and Cigna have been unable to finalize a new contract. As a result, as of March 15, 2025, Jefferson Health will be considered out-of-network for Cigna commercial members.\n\n\"We understand that this news may cause concern, and we want to reassure our patients that we remain committed to providing high-quality care. We continue to negotiate in good faith with Cigna to reach a resolution that is fair and sustainable for our patients, providers, and community.\n\n\"For more than 20 years, Jefferson Health has been a trusted provider for Cigna members. However, our current contract does not reflect the true cost of delivering high-quality care. Since 2020, Cigna's reimbursement rates have increased by only 3%, while the Hospital Wage Index has risen 20% and CPI-U has increased 21%. Rising costs for labor, medical supplies, and operations make it unsustainable to continue at these below-market rates. Other insurers in our communities have recognized these economic realities, and Jefferson has successfully reached agreements with them.\n\n\"Emergency care remains in-network for all Cigna members, regardless of contract status.\n\n\"Some patients may qualify for Transition of Care programs to maintain in-network benefits. Please check with Cigna.\n\n\"Many Cigna plans include out-of-network benefits that may allow continued access to Jefferson providers.\n\n\"We encourage Cigna members to contact Cigna directly to understand their coverage options and advocate for continued access to Jefferson Health providers.\n\n\"Our priority remains delivering the highest quality care while securing fair agreements that support our mission. We appreciate your patience and support as we work toward a resolution.\"",

        "content": "INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA – FEBRUARY 25: General manager Howie Roseman of the Philadelphia Eagles speaks to the media during the NFL Scouting Combine at the Indiana Convention Center on February 25, 2025 in Indianapolis, Indiana. (Photo by Stacy Revere/Getty Images)\n\nSign up for our email newsletter to stay up-to-date on the latest local sports news throughout Philadelphia.\n\nThe 2025 NFL Draft is quickly approaching as teams around the NFL work to host prospects on top 30 visits ahead of the event in late April. Top 30 visits (or 30 visits) are the most exclusive meetings that teams can have with prospects during the pre-draft process and they’ve been clear indicators of interest for the Philadelphia Eagles in recent years.\n\nPrior to the 2023 NFL Draft, the Eagles hosted Jalen Carter, Nolan Smith, Tyler Steen and Kelee Ringo on top 30 visits. Prior to the 2024 NFL Draft, the Eagles hosted Quinyon Mitchell, Cooper DeJean, Jalyx Hunt, Ainias Smith and Johnny Wilson on top 30 visits.\n\nWhich means 56.3% of Philadelphia’s draft picks in each of the last two seasons had top 30 visits with the team. 100% of Philadelphia’s first three draft picks in each of the last two seasons had top 30 visits with the team.\n\nHere are the prospects that the Eagles will reportedly host on top 30 visits in the City of Brotherly Love ahead of the 2025 NFL Draft.\n\nJalen Travis, OL, Iowa State\n\nFormer Iowa State offensive lineman Jalen Travis started 11 games at left tackle for the Cyclones in 2024. According to Pro Football Focus, Travis allowed just one sack and 11 total pressures in 475 pass protection snaps at Iowa State. Prior to joining the Cyclones, Travis played at Princeton while splitting time at both left tackle and right tackle.\n\nTravis has the ideal size to play offensive tackle in the NFL at 6’8”, 339 lbs. with 34 7/8” arms. While Travis is far from a finished product, he would benefit by learning inside Philadelphia’s prestigious offensive line room. Travis is projected to be selected on day three of the 2025 NFL Draft.\n\nSource: Zach Berman of PHLY on X\n\nMarcus Mbow, OL, Purdue\n\nMar 1, 2025; Indianapolis, IN, USA; Purdue University offensive lineman Marcus Mbow (OL26) answers questions at a press conference during the 2025 NFL Combine at Indiana Convention Center. Mandatory Credit: Jacob Musselman-Imagn Images\n\nFormer Purdue offensive lineman Marcus Mbow played multiple positions in college. Mbow started 18 games at right tackle and 14 games at right guard. Many expect Mbow to find a home at guard in the NFL, as he has drawn comparisons to former Tampa Bay Buccaneers guard Ali Marpet.\n\nMbow’s athleticism and feisty temperament would mesh well with Philadelphia’s offensive line. He is able to move to the second level with ease, making him an ideal fit as the next student to enroll at Stoutland University. Mbow is projected to be selected on day two of the 2025 NFL Draft.\n\nSource: Marcus Mbow on Instagram\n\nJosh Conerly Jr., OL, Oregon\n\nFormer Oregon offensive lineman Josh Conerly Jr. started 28 games at left tackle for Ducks. While he went viral for being bulldozed by Marshall edge rusher Mike Green in one-on-one drills at the Senior Bowl, Conerly’s tape at Oregon was still very impressive.\n\nAccording to Pro Football Focus, Conerly allowed just two sacks in his 28 starts at Oregon. Conerly’s most impressive performance came against Penn State edge rusher Abdul Carter, who didn’t record a single pressure against the Ducks. Conerly is projected to be selected late in the first round or early on day two of the 2025 NFL Draft.\n\nSource: James Crepea of The Oregonian on X\n\nAnthony Belton, OL, North Carolina State\n\nMar 2, 2025; Indianapolis, IN, USA; NC State offensive lineman Anthony Belton (OL02) during the 2025 NFL Combine at Lucas Oil Stadium.

Belton has the ideal size to play offensive tackle at the next level at 6’6”, 336 lbs. with nearly 34” arms. It’s easy to see why the Eagles are intrigued by Belton’s size profile and skillset.\n\nBelton is certainly far from a finished product, yet he would benefit greatly from learning from Jeff Stoutland and working behind both Jordan Mailata and Lane Johnson.

After spending the first four years of his career with the division rival New York Giants, Ojulari expressed his excitement joining the defending Super Bowl Champs for the upcoming season.\n\n“I feel like it’s amazing and I’m still learning and continuing to grow. I think it’s going to be a great fit (playing in Vic Fangio’s defense). Watching how dominant they were and saw how they got after the Chiefs, I feel like it will be great.“\n\nOct 20, 2024; East Rutherford, New Jersey, USA; New York Giants linebacker Azeez Ojulari (51) takes down Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Jalen Hurts (1) during the first half at MetLife Stadium. Mandatory Credit: Robert Deutsch-Imagn Images\n\nOjulari has dealt with injuries throughout his young career, but at just 24, he still has a lot of potential and room to grow. The former second round pick out of Georgia has played in 11 games in each of the last two seasons, only 7 in 2022. He played a full season his rookie year back in 2021. He has shown the ability to get to the quarterback despite missing significant time, racking up 22 sacks in 46 career games.\n\n“I have been having up and downs with injuries, so I’m trying to put that behind me and do everything I can this year to be 100% healthy. Keep attacking each day at a time. Just prove to myself I can be out there for all 17 games and do whatever I can to do that,” Ojulari said.\n\nFeb 9, 2025; New Orleans, LA, USA; Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes (15) runs with the ball against Philadelphia Eagles defensive end Brandon Graham (55) and defensive tackle Jordan Davis (90) during the second half of Super Bowl LIX at Caesars Superdome.

He isn’t sure what is role will be with the Eagles but he is looking to do whatever is necessary.\n\n“I feel like I’m a versatile player. I’m a physical guy I don’t shy away from contact. I’m an attack first type mentality guy. Can set the edge, I can tackle, I can rush passer, I can bend. I feel like I can do it all. I’m still meeting the coaches, but I’m ready to come in and compete. I’m a hard worker and looking to continue to learn and do whatever it is to help the team win.“\n\nOjulari is yet another Georgia Bulldog on the roster now for the Eagles, bringing the total up to seven. Smiling about the fact of reuniting with his college teammates, the EDGE said one particular Bulldog is like a sibling which can help ease his transition to the Eagles.\n\n“Nolan (Smith) is my brother for real. All of them are my brothers, but Nolan and I, we have been in the same room since Georgia. Probably a little bit closer with him, but we all have that brotherhood and great relationship. I’m just excited to be here.”\n\nMandatory Credit: Ken Blaze-Imagn Images",

        "content": "Sign up for our Gay City News email newsletter to get news, updates, and local insights delivered straight to your inbox!\n\nDozens of groups and individuals across New York State are calling on state leaders to allocate extra funding for gender-affirming care in light of the Trump administration’s widespread cuts and attacks on transgender individuals.\n\nThe coalition of New Yorkers delivered a letter on March 17 to Gov. Kathy Hochul, State Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins, and Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie calling for a $50 million contingency fund to cover the costs of gender-affirming care by subsidizing or even replacing the federal government’s share of Medicaid funding in the 2026 budget.\n\n“We were profoundly disappointed that this funding was not included in the executive budget or the one-house budget proposals,” stated the letter, which was signed by New York City-based groups such as Ali Forney Center, Callen-Lorde Community Health Center, and GMHC; hospital systems like Bassett Healthcare Network and Montefiore Nyack Hospital, Highland Medical; and LGBTQ centers, including the LGBT Center in Manhattan and the Rockland County Pride Center.\n\nThe letter comes less than two months after President Donald Trump issued an executive order that called to bar federal funding for gender-affirming care for individuals under the age of 19, prompting several hospitals in New York City and other areas to pull back on gender-affirming care for youth and some adults. Federal courts have hobbled that order, but the Trump administration has continued to target transgender individuals.\n\nAdvocates made their voices heard in Albany on Feb. 25, when more than 100 people met with elected officials to call on them to support the $50 million fund and improve shield laws to protect patients and providers.\n\n“The groups who are working to undermine medically necessary health care for transgender people are the same groups attacking reproductive freedom,” the letter noted. “We must be united in our defense of both transgender healthcare and reproductive healthcare. In fact, the contingency fund can be modeled after the mechanisms created to support reproductive health care in the wake of the Dobbs decision and during the previous Trump administration, respectively, i.e. Reproductive Freedom & Equity Fund and the Title X Contingency Funding.”\n\nIn February, three New York City-based LGBTQ political clubs sent a letter to Hochul and top lawmakers calling on them to boost funding and other forms of support for transgender New Yorkers and individuals living with HIV/AIDS.\n\nWhen Gay City News reached out to Hochul’s office for this story, a spokesperson for the governor provided the same statement the governor provided to Gay City News in response to the February letter from LGBTQ political clubs.\n\n“New York State’s mission remains the same,” the spokesperson said. “Governor Hochul will continue to work with the New York State Department of Health to promote the health and wellbeing of all New Yorkers.”\n\nThe letter to elected leaders stressed that New York State must not abandon its “legacy of protecting the transgender community.”\n\n“New York State has a responsibility to protect transgender people and their access to medically necessary healthcare,” the letter concluded. “We strongly urge you to include the $50m contingency fund in the final FY26 budget.",

        "source": "https://metrophiladelphia.com/",
        "content": "Sign up for our email newsletter to stay up-to-date on the latest local sports news throughout Philadelphia.\n\nThe Philadelphia Eagles have two number-one receivers and a WR3 who is likely WR2 on almost every other NFL team, so many observers would assume the Eagles will not be drafting a wide-out. But with Howie Roseman, you never know. Many see the upcoming NFL draft as a “luxury draft” for Philadelphia as they do not have many, or any, obvious needs.\n\nThe Eagles could have a desire to trade a receiver down the road, or they could add to their already impressive Wide Receiver room. Philadelphia is a wild card in every round this year!\n\nReceiving options for the Eagles\n\nINDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA – FEBRUARY 25: General manager Howie Roseman of the Philadelphia Eagles speaks to the media during the NFL Scouting Combine at the Indiana Convention Center on February 25, 2025 in Indianapolis, Indiana. (Photo by Stacy Revere/Getty Images)\n\nMatthew Golden, Texas, is electric with the ball in his hands and fast, as he showed at the combine with a 4.29 forty! Matthew is an elite route runner who breaks ankles with his sharp cuts, double moves, and twitch. He has the hops to get up for the ball versus DBs taller than him and has the hands to haul in every pass. He is in the conversation as WR1.\n\nEmeka Egbuka, Ohio State, has elite coverage concept knowledge and routinely finds the soft spot against defenses. He utilizes advanced footwork, is a technical route runner, and is also reliable and fearless over the middle. Egbuka gets open quickly in tight spaces and runs with a desire to score every time the ball is in his hands. He is a top 3 WR in the 2025 NFL Draft.\n\nTetairoa McMillan, Arizona, has been a QBs best friend by making catches most Wide Receivers can’t. Tetaiora uses his long body to shield defenders and can get open fast in short routes and the red zone. He has a toolbox full of crafty releases and separates with long strides downfield.\n\nMar 1, 2025; Indianapolis, IN, USA; Missouri wideout Luther Burden III (WO09) during the 2025 NFL Combine at Lucas Oil Stadium. Mandatory Credit: Kirby Lee-Imagn Images\n\nLuther Burden III, Missouri, has reached the upper echelon of the WR class two years in a row. Luther exudes long speed, body control, and an explosive release. Burden can be a dominating receiver from the slot and is a savvy route runner who beats defenders to the ball. Luther has shown to be a dangerous YAC threat with his ability to fight through tackles. Burden produced versus the top competition in college football.\n\nTre Harris, Ole Miss, dominates in the Red Zone, is extremely physical, and stresses defenders with long strides on vertical routes. Tre has a strong frame and core and doesn’t get knocked off routes or outmuscled for the football. Harris uses leverage and a high football IQ to get open in space. He is an elite blocker and one of the more well-rounded WRs in the class. If the Eagles needed a WR3, he would be a target.\n\nElic Ayomanor, Stanford, demonstrates elite footspeed and an uncanny ability to redirect on a dime. He is a vertical threat that can separate quickly with an elite release package. Elic has shown above-average blocking skills and will be able to get on an NFL field quickly. Ayormaor is always fighting through coverage and working back for the football. He has a high motor, is uber-competitive, and is another WR that will interest teams willing to use a top pick in the draft for a wide out.\n\nMar 1, 2025; Indianapolis, IN, USA; Miami wideout Xavier Restrepo (WO37) during the 2025 NFL Combine at Lucas Oil Stadium. Mandatory Credit: Kirby Lee-Imagn Images\n\nXavier Restrepo, Miami, is an elite route runner who confuses defensive backs with misdirection and changing speeds like Greg Maddux did in baseball with his pitches. Xavier is quick and able to work in tight areas, he processes where his QB wants to go with the ball when plays break down and find a way to get open. Restrepo can play on special teams immediately while he develops on an NFL roster.\n\nJalen Royals, Utah St, tracks the ball as well as anyone in the class. He had 15 touchdowns in 2023 and showed an innate ability to get to the high point first. Once the ball is in his hands, he causes a lot of missed tackles, especially in tight spaces, showing off his twitch. Royals is an above-average route runner, fluid, blessed with excellent foot speed, and understands coverage.\n\nIsaiah Bond, Texas, is an uber-talented athlete, with elite acceleration. Bon, Isaiah Bond, glides down the field on verticals with ease and tracks the ball well. He is another vertical threat in this class that puts stress on defense by changing speeds and directions. Isaiah has shown a good burst off the line and displays physicality beyond his size, especially as blocker.\n\nJaylin Noel, Iowa St, is incredibly quick in tight spaces and uses his speed and escapability to create YAC. Jaylin might have the best feet in class. Noel creates separation almost instantly off the line, sometimes causing defensive backs to fall. He often destroys zone coverage and carves up defenders with his plant and burst. He has the skills to be an elite receiver at the next level.\n\nMar 1, 2025; Indianapolis, IN, USA; Iowa State wideout Jayden Higgins (WO18) during the 2025 NFL Combine at Lucas Oil Stadium. Mandatory Credit: Kirby Lee-Imagn Images\n\nJayden Higgins, Iowa State, has great size, soft hands, and contortionist body control. Higgins gets open by finding holes in coverage consistently and using his wide wing span to extend his impressive catch radius. Jayden had an impressively low 3% drop rate. He creates YAC with polished routes and a balanced core. Higgins is a versatile weapon able to line up all over the field as your x, y or z.\n\nJack Bech, TCU, is a physical receiver who creates space with his size and balance when knocked off routes. Bech completes receptions in tight spaces by using his strong hands and his above-average ball-tracking skills. Jack is in the conversation for having the best hands in class. Bech is tough over the middle and does the dirty work of blocking anyone with a pulse.\n\nAs always, thank you for reading!\n\nFollow me on X @PHLEagleNews\n\nMandatory Credit: Kirby Lee-Imagn Images",

        "content": "Sign up for our Daily Email newsletter to stay up-to-date on the latest local news throughout Philadelphia.\n\n‘Pretty Guardian Sailor Moon: The Super Live’ is hitting the stage in Philly next month and bringing the classic Japanese manga to life in a “2.5D Musical” experience.\n\nThe character of ‘Sailor Moon’ was created by Naoko Takeuchi as a manga in a Japanese comic magazine in 1991. The comic was then translated into 17 different languages in 46 countries worldwide, and adapted as an anime TV series and a live-action TV series (which has aired in over 40 countries.)\n\nNow, the story and its characters have been adapted to the stage by Makoto Matsuda, founder of the Japan 2.5-Dimensional Musical Association. Matsuda is the driving force behind the “2.5-dimensional musical” genre, which involves stage productions based on manga, anime, and video games.\n\n“It’s based on the idea of bringing the 2-dimensional world of manga and animation or even gaming in that way. The characters that are portrayed in 2D brought to life in a 3D living, human actor. It’s an in-between world of expressing 2D in the best way of 3D,” says Matsuda at a global press conference for ‘Pretty Guardian.’\n\n‘Sailor Moon’ revolves around a teenager named Usagi Tsukino in 1990s Japan, who receives the gift of becoming the reincarnation of Princess Serenity, the Moon Princess, and must transform into Sailor Moon to protect the Earth.\n\nRiko Tanaka will step into the main role for ‘Pretty Guardian Sailor Moon: The Super Live.’ Tanaka had thoughts on why this central figure of the show is so popular.\n\n“I talk with so many people all the time, but I think that it comes down to the fact that the main character Usagi is really charming, a little clumsy, and fun character that people want to kind of reach out and help,” says Tanaka. “And there’s this other Sailor Moon, which is the fighting, really powerful, strong, enigmatic character that is unbeatable. And that contrast between the two makes it really interesting and attractive. I feel like keeping that gap is something that makes it very interesting to people.”\n\nWith book, lyrics and direction by Kaori Miura, choreography by Satomi Toma, and music by Go Sakabe and KYOHEI, this specific tour utilizes many “tricks” to make the experience unique. As its official site says, this production was the first-ever 2.5D musical to hit North American stages, ushering in “a new era of live theatre that merges the visual style of manga and anime with the immersive power of live performance.”\n\n“I got involved with the Japan production of Sailor Moon, and I’ve been doing it for ten years. How it would translate bringing it overseas to an audience globally was something that I was thinking about,” says Toma. “As a choreographer, I come from a background where I love live theater, musicals, and the element of performing live in front of people. It does immensely help that the actresses, the performers, and the production team, all of them are very experienced by doing the best job and bringing the best world of the Pretty Guardian in the musical format domestically.”\n\nThe show began its U.S. national tour in Austin, Texas, and plans to play a total of 21 cities, then ending in New York City. The Philadelphia show will stop in town on Tuesday, April 22 (8 p.m.) at the Miller Theater, presented by Ensemble Arts Philly.\n\n“‘I’m a little too young to have [experienced] it live, but there was an era where I would go and rent Sailor Moon at a rental video shop and watch it—that’s how much I love it,” adds Tanaka. “And now that I’m playing her and I feel so much love from throughout the entire world. Everybody loves Sailor Moon and I feel that playing this character myself.”\n\nAnd what exactly makes it “Super Live”?\n\n“You’ll know when you see it,” finshes Matsudo. “It has the regular song and music but also dance technology, visuals, projection—so much more than the normal, conventional musical. So we wanted to honor the situation by naming it and giving it a new category name. It’s almost kind of like a manifesto to call it a new thing. And that is our intention on calling it Super Live.”\n\nTo find out more information on ‘Pretty Guardian Sailor Moon: The Super Live’ at the Miller Theater (250 S Broad St) and to score tickets (various prices), head online to ensembleartsphilly.org.

With players like league-leading scorer Tai Baribo and number one (in the depth chart, maybe the league, and certainly our hearts) goalie Andre Blake off representing their countries, some less familiar faces will have to step up and perform for the Boys in Blue.\n\nHere are three players to keep an eye on for Saturday’s clash against Union manager Bradley Carnell’s former team, St. Louis City\n\nImage Credit: Philadelphia Union\n\nNathan Harriel\n\nA preseason injury disrupted Nathan Harriel’s start to the season, but after coming off the bench against Nashville on Sunday and playing nearly an entire half’s worth of minutes (thanks to the 15 minutes of stoppage time), he is in line to get his first start of the season on Saturday.\n\nThe question is, where? Right back may seem like the obvious answer, but with Ian Glavinovich also battling injuries to start the season, I think it’s more likely we see Harriel slotting in next to Jakob Glesnes at center back. It’s a position he has played before and held his own at, and right now, the Union just needs someone to play there. Frankie Westfield’s rise has meant Harriel’s absence to start the season hasn’t been felt as much as might have been expected, but look for him to remind everyone why he is an integral part of this team and will be getting a lot of game time now that he’s fit again.\n\nMandatory Credit: Philadelphia Union\n\nBruno Damiani\n\nIn other times, the Union’s three million dollar man not starting any of the first four games to begin the season might be cause for concern. But with all three primary strikers getting off to a scoring start and the team as a whole scoring 10 goals across the first three games (let’s just forget about the Nashville game), Bruno Damiani has had more time to settle into life in Philadelphia without the pressure that typically comes with being a team’s new striker- let alone a record signing.\n\nMany fans are eager to see what Damiani can do with more time on the field. On Saturday, he finally gets his chance to show what he brings to this Union team.\n\nImage Credit: Philadelphia Union\n\nIndiana Vassilev\n\nSpeaking of new signings getting to show more of what they can do, I’m expecting Indiana Vassilev and his glorious facial hair to get the start in midfield on Saturday next to Jovan Lukic.\n\nWhen he initially signed, I was picturing him playing higher up the pitch in the Dániel Gazdag or Quinn Sullivan role. He has come on for both of those players, but against Nashville, he came off the bench for Danley Jean Jacques in what may have been an audition for a deeper-lying role against St. Louis. It wouldn’t be a surprise to see him in attacking midfield, but I’m hoping that opportunity goes to someone like Jeremy Rafanello.\n\nImage Credit: Philadelphia Union\n\nCan Union get a result in spite of missing seven players?\n\nThere’s going to be a lot of intriguing choices for this lineup with so many players missing. It would be nice to see some of the younger guys who came up through the academy get a run-out, in the way Nathan Harriel and Quinn Sullivan got extended looks during international breaks in past seasons. Along those lines, fans who have been clamoring to see more of Cavan Sullivan will likely get their wish. It would be cool to see someone like Sal Olivas or CJ Olney get a chance to show what they can do.\n\nWant even more players to watch, maybe some Union players with their national teams?

Rafael Marchan will replace Garrett Stubbs as Philadelphia’s backup catcher on the 2025 Opening Day roster. According to MLB.com’s Today Zolecki, Stubbs is being optioned to Triple-A despite spending the last three seasons in the MLB with Philly.\n\nGarrett Stubbs has been optioned to Triple-A. Rafael Marchan will be the backup. — Todd Zolecki (@ToddZolecki) March 20, 2025\n\nNew Phillies 2025 Catching Duo\n\nPSN’s Shaun Nestor recently provided an update on the battle for the backup catcher spot behind J.T. Realmuto. The 34-year-old catcher is firmly installed as the Phillies’ starting catcher as he enters his seventh season in Philly. When healthy, Realmuto has averaged 126 games per season over the last four seasons. The three-time National League All-Star will play his 700th game in red pinstripes when the Phillies open the season in Washington next week.\n\nFeb 19, 2025; Clearwater, FL, USA; Philadelphia Phillies catcher Garrett Stubbs (21) (left) shortstop Trea Turner (7) (left center) first base Bryce Harper (3) (left center) second base Bryson Stott (5) (right center) and designated hitter Kyle Schwarber (12) (right) participate in spring training workouts at BayCare Ballpark. Mandatory Credit: Nathan Ray Seebeck-Imagn Images\n\nMarchan receives his fourth appearance on the MLB roster and his first time along the white chalk of the baselines during Opening Day introductions. The 5-foot-9 catcher impressed during a short stint in Philadelphia last June when he batted .294 over 17 games. He featured a .549 slugging percentage with four doubles and three home runs in 56 MLB plate appearances. In 34 games for Triple-A Lehigh Valley last season, Marchan hit .229 with two doubles and two home runs. The Venezuelan catcher served as the 27th man during the Phillies series in London last season.\n\nStubbs to Lehigh Valley\n\nGarrett Stubbs was optioned to Triple-A before this afternoon’s spring training contest against Atlanta. Stubbs, 31, has averaged 47 games as the backup in Philadelphia with a .222 battling average over the last three seasons. Stubbs takes a financial hit with the demotion as his contract pays out $450K for time spent in Triple-A and $925K while an active member of the 26-man roster. With the option remaining on his contract, the Phillies can retain the services of their veteran backup catcher as injury protection this season without having to carry Stubbs on the active roster.\n\nPhiladelphia acquired Stubbs in a November 2021 trade that sent 22-year-old prospect Logan Cerny with the Houston Astros. An opposing MLB general manager needing a backup catcher could pry the six-year MLB veteran out of the minors by offering a controllable prospect to Phillies GM Dave Dombrowski. Philadelphia opens its 144th season of MLB regular season play in Washington on March 27.\n\nMandatory Credit: Mike Watters-Imagn Images",

Her follow-up single, “River,” was an even greater success that topped Spotify’s US Viral 50 and climbed into the top 3 on the Billboard Alternative Songs chart. The complete album, “Church of Scars,” reached the top 5 in both the Billboard top alternative and rock album charts.\n\nBriggs unveiled her latest album, ‘Tell My Therapist I’m Fine,’ in October last year. This latest work is Briggs’ third album and her first since 2019. The album quickly earned widespread acclaim for its profound depth and raw honesty. Billboard even hailed the album as her most powerful work yet, stating, “Bishop Briggs is delivering the most revealing and emotionally resonant songs of her career.”\n\nAfter three billion streams, multiple sold-out tours, and appearances in festivals across the globe, Briggs brings her sound back to the stage this spring. Briggs’s signature grit and gravity convey a worn but unbeaten spirit, drawing comparisons to other notable female vocalists such as Janis Joplin, Florence Welch, Aretha Franklin, and Alabama Shakes’ Brittany Howard. Briggs showcased her range in a performance on Netflix’s Wednesday float, performing her hauntingly intimate version of the Rolling Stones classic ‘Paint it Black’ during last year’s Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade.\n\nThose looking to hear the latest from Briggs should head to Union Transfer on Thursday, March 27. Doors open at 7 p.m., and the show starts an hour later.\n\nFor more information about Bishop Briggs’ latest album and upcoming performance, visit bishopbriggs.com.",

Topics of discussion include McCain and William’s days as Blue Devils, navigating relationships and financial discussions, their Duke all-time top fives, and much more.\n\nMcCain discusses Blue Devils\n\n“That’s the thing with Duke because I think we have so much depth. And I say “we” like I’m part of the team, but my roots, my roots. But, yeah, I think the depth of the team is what makes them so good. So I think they’ll be fine regardless. But I do think, knowing Cooper, he wants to play as much as anybody. So yeah, I think he’ll be back, but I think they’ll be fine without him, too.”\n\n“2025 National Champs, for sure. I mean, there are definitely some great teams. No disrespect to the SEC — great, great conference — love everything about it…. but I just think Duke.”\n\nMcCain on projected No. 1 pick, Cooper Flagg\n\n“He came when I was at Duke for a visit and to scrimmage and stuff. So he scrimmages with us and you could just tell, I mean, obviously, you see everything online with him, but seeing it in person, like it just, I think the main thing with him, I’ve said it a bunch, but he just plays hard.\n\n“You don’t see that in a lot of young talented guys. I feel like they rely on their talent, which they’re super talented, so it can get you really far. But I think with Cooper, the thing that sets him apart is he’s one of the best defenders in the country, just on defense and then offensively, obviously, [he] has the talent.”\n\nMcCain on his favorites from 2024-2025 squad\n\n“My boy Caleb Foster, he’s like my best friend. That’s my guy, Kon, Kon Knupple. He’s cold, he’s smart, IQ, he can defend but, yeah, I think he’s I mean, we’ve talked, I’ve talked about this, but he surprised so many people when he first got there. I don’t think anyone really expected him to be what he is now, but seeing him in the summer, seeing him just how he works, and he asked me questions too. So, I always appreciate that, and I think that goes a long way. But Kon is cool. Kon is super cool.”\n\nTo watch the first episode of Sideline Stories, check out the link below:\n\nFor more from Team Whistle—a DAZN Group sports and entertainment media company, including content featuring talents like Patrick Mahomes, A’ja Wilson, Kyrie Irving, Snoop Dogg, Joel Embiid, Trea Turner, and more, visit teamwhistle.com.",

It’s my great honor to stand alongside Autism Speaks and tap into my strong community, made up of those in the culinary world, autism advocates and beyond, to establish a greater sense of support, acceptance and inclusion for those on the autism spectrum. Together, we have the power to offer others the opportunity to feel seen, heard, and valued every day.”\n\n“Autism is something very close to my husband, Vivek Deora’s, and my heart as our son is on the spectrum,” said Chauhan. “It means the world to me to be able to participate and try to make the world a better place for people and families with autism.”\n\n“It has been an honor to participate in this event alongside Jamal James Kent in years past, and I’m thrilled to offer continued support of such a worthy cause and raise awareness of Autism Speaks’ advocacy, research, and care,” said Garcia.\n\nProceeds from the gala will go to support Autism Speaks.\n\n“For me, this event is my baby.

It is really very special for me,” said Becker.\n\n“It is an opportunity to foster autism awareness, promoting access to resources and inclusion in both personal and professional communities,” said Kreuther.\n\n“We are incredibly proud and honored to be able to support this organization by being a part of this event.

While many will take to the many eateries and watering holes found within Philadelphia, others may prefer to simply stay at home, watch some college basketball, enjoy a cold drink, and perhaps do so sans pants. If that sounds like a good time, then you want to celebrate the age-old Finnish tradition known as Kalsarikännit, and The Finnish Long Drink wants to help you.\n\nKalsarikännit is a Finnish word that literally translates as “pantsdrunk,” and honors the longstanding tradition of drinking at home in the comfort of only your underwear. The Finnish Long Drink, inspired by Finland’s national drink, “lonkero,” or “long drink,” is looking to support college basketball fans who are celebrating Kalsarikännit by supplying them with a six-pack of their award-winning cocktail for only $0.01.\n\n“While college basketball is one of the most exciting times of the year, bars can sometimes be a less than ideal place to watch with crowds and distractions,” said Sakari Manninen, The Finnish Long Drink co-founder. “This felt like the perfect time to tap into the Long Drink’s Finnish roots and give drinkers another option – enjoying the games, pants-free or otherwise, in the comfort of their own home. Of course, for those who prefer to watch in the bar, we would strongly recommend wearing pants.”\n\nNow through April 7, fans can avoid the chaotic hustle and bustle of the local bar scene and instead relax in the tranquility of their own home, where the only craze comes in the form of March Madness, and enjoy sparkling refreshment and ultimate relaxation. To be well on your way to celebrating March Madness Kalsarikännit-style, all one needs to do is buy a six-pack of The Finnish Long Drink, text them your receipt, and then Long Drink will Venmo or PayPal you directly for the difference within 24-48 hours.\n\nThe Finnish Long Drink was co-founded by Finns Sakari Manninen, Mikael Taipale, and Ere Manner, alongside American entrepreneur Evan Burns, and initially made its debut in 2018. The next year, Downington, PA native and critically acclaimed actor Miles Teller discovered the drink in 2019 while living in Manhattan. Teller was so fond of the drink that he became a co-owner shortly thereafter and helped oversee the brand’s impressive growth, including the debut of the cocktail in Teller’s home state late last year.\n\nFor more details and to learn how to text your receipt to Long Drink, visit thelongdrink.com/kalsarikannit.

Graham leaves the field pitch with the loudest ovation after winning the Super Bowl in his final appearance. Having spent almost half of his entire career in Philadelphia, the defensive end isn’t ready for life without the Eagles, indicating his willingness to return in some other capacity.\n\nBrandon Graham bids goodbye to Philadelphia\n\nGraham’s 15-year career remains a typical hero’s journey, where the protagonist embarks on a mission, faces and overcomes challenges and returns home transformed by his experiences.\n\nThe 36-year-old was a first round pick out of Michigan, who suffered criticisms and was mainly a backup in his first five seasons as a Pro, managing only 17 sacks during the time. He soon turned his fortunes around and became an important figure in the Eagles’ roster, with his strip-sack of Tom Brady in Super Bowl LII being the major highlight of his turnaround.\n\nWith his effort, he thwarted a comeback attempt and helped the Eagles clinch its first Vice Lombardi Trophy. And when it was time for the second, Brandon Graham returned from a torn triceps just in time to play against Chiefs at Super Bowl LIX, where he got 13 snaps and made one tackle in Eagles’ 40-22 win over Kansas City Chiefs.\n\nOct 27, 2024; Cincinnati, Ohio, USA; Cincinnati Bengals quarterback Joe Burrow (9) is sacked by Philadelphia Eagles linebacker Nolan Smith Jr. (3) and defensive end Brandon Graham (55) during the first quarter at Paycor Stadium.

Through the struggles, the injuries and the moments where I had to prove myself over and over again, you never let me feel comfortable. You held me accountable. You kept that chip on my shoulder. You pushed me to be better, and when the time came, we celebrated together — two times.” (Via ABC)\n\nWhat’s next for Brandon Graham?\n\nHaving decided to take a permanent walk off the field, Graham has expressed a strong desire to remain with the Eagles, albeit in a different role. He mentioned his plans to discuss with the team’s owner on his willingness to contribute to the team’s future success. His experience and passion for the game will surely come in handy for the Eagles in some other creative capacity.\n\n“I said I want to sit down and talk with Mr. Lurie and have some dinner with them,” Brandon Graham said. “So, we’re going to do that and figure out what I can do to be a part of what’s going on. Because I feel like, as you know, we’ve got some good stuff brewing right now.\n\n“And I want to make sure that I can be a help in whatever it is that I do. Of course, I want to be creative. I don’t have to be all in one basket, have everything all in one but just kind of move around. I don’t want to just cold turkey leave that game because I love it.” (Via AtoZ Sports)\n\nIt will be interesting to see if Brandon Graham does return to the Eagles in some capacity over the coming months, but for now, we’re left with nothing but love and gratitude for all he’s given over his remarkable career.\n\nMandatory Credit: Bill Streicher-Imagn Images",

Just a day later, however, Suárez reported some back stiffness that could put the start of his season in jeopardy.\n\nRanger Suárez dealing with back tightness\n\nThe Phillies sent the left-hander for imaging on Monday, and it revealed no structural issues – but back issues forced Suárez to miss a month in 2024. He even had to back out of the All-Star game as a result, his first time getting the nod to appear in the summer classic.\n\nAccording to Matt Gelb of The Athletic, Manager Rob Thomson indicated today (Wednesday, March 19) that the club should know more in the next 24-48 hours. As a result, Suárez will not pitch Friday as scheduled. He was penciled in to start the fifth game of the season, April 3 against the Colorado Rockies, so the Phillies have time before making a decision that might impact the 26-man roster on Opening Day.\n\nOct 9, 2024; New York, New York, USA; Philadelphia Phillies manager Rob Thomson relieves pitcher Ranger Suarez (55) against the New York Mets in the fifth inning in game four of the NLDS for the 2024 MLB Playoffs at Citi Field. Mandatory Credit: Wendell Cruz-Imagn Images\n\nWhile Ranger’s stuff had looked less-than-stellar in spring, the team wasn’t worried – he’s known to be a slower starter and a slight down-tick in velocity didn’t set off any alarms. Suárez hasn’t complained until this weekend, so there was nothing of concern from their point of view. Now, they have an important decision to make – who steps into the rotation if Ranger needs some time to rest and ramp back up.\n\nAn opportunity for Taijuan Walker\n\nTaijuan Walker seemed like a shoe-in to break camp on the roster before you remind yourself of his contract. His velocity had increased from last season, his Splitter seemingly returned to it’s former glory, and he limited damage to the tune of a 3.86 ERA. Walker was solid – until Wednesday. Yankee hitters thumped the ball against Walker, putting up six runs in 3.2 innings, blasting three home runs in the process. Nine batted balls were rocketed with 100-plus MPH exit velocity – it wasn’t pretty.\n\nWalker may now be forced into the rotation, and the Phillies will hope they see what he did in his first 9.1 innings, and not the last 3.2. He will have one more opportunity to redeem himself on Monday, the final game of Spring Training. They could also opt to leave him in the bullpen as they originally envisioned and opt to wait for Ranger, or keep someone like Kyle Tyler or Tyler Phillips in for a spot start or two, playing it safe with Suárez and allowing him to start the season on the injured list for some extra recovery time.\n\n“I don’t know,” Thomson told reporters Wednesday. “We’ll know more in the next couple of days.”\n\nThis is a crucial season for Ranger. The 29-year-old lefty is entering the final season of his contract and would be a free agent at season’s end. Suárez was an All-Star in 2024 after going 10-4 with a 2.76 ERA and 112 strikeouts to just 26 walks in the first half. He struggled in the second half (5.65 ERA after the All-Star break) while dealing with a different back injury, and finished the year at 12-8 with a 3.46 ERA in 27 starts.\n\nMandatory Credit: Nathan Ray Seebeck-Imagn Images",

The one-time Pro Bowler and two-time Super Bowl champion retired with 11 pass deflections, 23 forced fumbles, 7 fumble recoveries, 76.5 sacks, and 485 tackles.\n\nOnce the Eagles made a social media post regarding his announcement, speculation filled the air as to what Graham’s announcement would be about. And upon his announcement, there was an effusive outpouring of love, congratulatory messages, and praises that deluged the media space.\n\nAt the news conference, Brandon Graham was flanked on either side by two Vince Lombardi Trophies, as he summed up his journey of fifteen years in a 10-minute retirement speech.\n\nFootball – NFL – Super Bowl LIX – Philadelphia Eagles v Kansas City Chiefs – Caesars Superdome, New Orleans, Louisiana, United States – February 9, 2025 Philadelphia Eagles’ Brandon Graham celebrates with family after winning Super Bowl LIX REUTERS/Mike Segar\n\n“Fifteen years ago, I walked into this city as a young man with dreams, big dreams, a little bit of nervousness and a whole lot of fire in my heart. I had no idea back then what this journey would bring. I didn’t know how many times I would be tested. I didn’t know how much I would grow. And I truly didn’t know how deeply I would fall in love with these fans and the team and this city.”\n\nPresent at the presser was Super Bowl LIX MVP, Jalen Hurts with his fiancee, Bry Burrows, to honor the man who holds the record for the most seasons spent with the franchise. Lane Johnson and Fletcher Cox were also in attendance.\n\nEagles’ Reactions\n\nSaquon Barkley, who capped off his debut season with the Eagles with a Super Bowl win and spent just a year with Brandon Graham, posted a picture featuring himself and Graham on his Instagram story, adding emojis of an eagle, a dark heart, and a raised fist to the caption:\n\n“Incredible teammate, incredible person. Congrats on an amazing career BG! Forever a champion.”\n\nEagles outside linebacker Jalyx Hunt was also appreciative of Graham, who was extremely helpful in his rookie season.\n\n“BG has meant the world to me. He is himself 100% of the time, which is something I really appreciate about him, especially in this line of business,” he said.\n\n“You run into some people who aren’t always genuine. But he himself is just — you’re going to get BG good, BG bad, BG upset, sad, he’s all going to be the same. He’s all going to be genuine. Not only have I learned so much from him football-wise, I’ve learned so much outside of football.”\n\nGraham also had his former teammates shower him with love and good wishes. Fellow former defensive linemen, Chris Long, and former safety, Rodney McLeod didn’t let the moment pass them by.\n\nChris Long was succinct in his message on X.\n\n“Congrats on retirement BG! You’re a legend.”\n\nRodney McLeod, on his X handle, wrote,\n\n“Legends live on forever! BG spirit is unmatched and lives through everyone he’s encountered. Enjoy the next chapter bro”\n\nZach Ertz, who won the Super Bowl with Graham in 2018 and now plays for the Washington Commanders, wrote on X that Graham is a “legend.”\n\nFeb 14, 2025; Philadelphia, PA, USA; Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Jalen Hurts (1) celebrates with the Lombardi Trophy during the Super Bowl LIX championship parade and rally. Mandatory Credit: Caean Couto-Imagn Images\n\n“Truly a great football player but there will never be another teammate like BG! Enjoy retirement my guy!” Ertz wrote.\n\nIn a statement released by the Eagles, American businessman and Eagles owner, Jeffrey Lurie, appreciated Graham for his time with the team.\n\n“Without question, Brandon Graham is the embodiment of everything you would want in a Philadelphia Eagle. He’s a special player and a special person. It’s only fitting that he has played in more games than anyone else in the history of our franchise,” Lurie wrote..\n\n“The positive energy he brought was infectious. Whether it was a practice, a game, or just walking around the building. Anyone who has had the pleasure of interacting with him would tell you that it’s impossible to have a bad day after being in his presence. Make no mistake, he was also a tough, physical, and talented player who has played an integral role in the success we’ve had over the years.”\n\nWhile others shared congratulatory wishes and lovely messages, Philadelphia Eagles offensive tackle Lane Johnson’s post was rather touching, following the retirement of his longtime teammate.\n\nJohnson took to X (formerly Twitter) to share his emotional message, posting a GIF of Will Smith from The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air standing alone in an empty room, and captioning the post with, “Don’t worry I got y’all!” while tagging Graham, along with previously retired Eagles legends Fletcher Cox and Jason Kelce.\n\nThe message of the four-time Pro Bowl tackle was clear, as he remains the only active player from a group that was considered the team’s foundational quartet. The tagged players: Kelce, Graham and Cox, all spent their entire NFL careers in Philadelphia, with Johnson also looking to replicate this feat.\n\nJohnson then tweeted a more explicit message on X\n\n“Brothers for life. Competed against each other every single day,” Johnson wrote.\n\n“Gonna miss you in that locker room @brandongraham55. Well-deserved retirement BG.”\n\nMandatory Credit: Bill Streicher-Imagn Images",

        "source": "https://metrophiladelphia.com/",
        "content": "Sign up for our Daily Email newsletter to stay up-to-date on the latest local news throughout Philadelphia.\n\nForty-five years after co-founding the Wilma Theater, guiding its transformation from an avant-garde space on Sansom Street to a renowned institution on the Avenue of the Arts, Blanka Zizka—Producing Artistic Director of the Wilma—decided it was time for a break. She longed to explore the world again, reconnect with family in her native Czech Republic, and rediscover her artistic vision beyond the theater she had helped shape.\n\nIn 2020, Zizka stepped back, transitioned the theater’s artistic leadership to a four-person cohort, took on the role of Artistic Director Emeritus and advisory council member, and moved forward.\n\n“I attended playwrights’ festivals, traveled through Africa and went on safari, saw my 98-year-old mother and my grandson – all things I didn’t get the opportunity to do while steadily running the Wilma,” says Zizka. “I even sold my house in the Philadelphia… I’m a nomad now. It’s exciting.”\n\nThis Spring, however, Blanka Zizka is back behind the Wilma’s directorial lectern — actually, she moves around too much to behind anything — for an incendiary adaptation of playwright Rajiv Joseph’s ‘Archduke‘ – with members of the Wilma’s HotHouse Acting Company that she founded – from April 15 through May 4.\n\nZizka was a part of playwright Joseph’s ‘Archduke’ process from its earliest previews, suggesting second act re-writes. “The first act was genius,” she says.\n\n“Like he did with the fake news of ‘Describe the Night’, which I directed at the Wilma in 2020, is make history contemporary… find the simplest words to describe its reality, the daily occurrences.”\n\nJoseph’s newest dramatic history lesson takes its cues from the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand, the heir to the Austro-Hungarian empire, whose murder brought about World War I. In the here and now of ‘Archduke’, Joseph and Zizka ask of the starving young Belgradians who assassinate the archduke and his wife – along with the audience of 2025 – what will someone do when they have nothing left to lose?\n\n“What methods are acceptable in the fight against oppression?” is questioned. And what reward is worth the bloodshed? Money? Freedom? A sandwich?\n\nPlaywright Joseph poses these questions and satirically toys with its solutions in poetic language that is steeped in dark humor and raw emotion, then shakes-and-stirs engagingly pragmatic metaphor and meticulously researched facts into a compelling, satirical creation called ‘Archduke’.\n\n“Joseph goes back into history, but this is not an historic play,” says the director. “He’s showing a mirror, reflecting who we are now. Joseph looks at the three, 19-year-old assassins of whom we know nothing about. History books never told us. So what Rajiv is doing is imagining what were their thoughts, their feelings, where they were coming from. Here, they are poor, sickly boys… are encountered by bombastic nationalists, and seduced by notions of glory. The rhetoric of nationalism in ‘Archduke’ is meant to echo, very much, that of the MAGA movement… a masculine, misogynistic culture full of grievances.”\n\nWhat Joseph does best, however, is make his information both horrifying and hilarious by Zikka’s account.\n\n“It’s an absurd, absolute comedy that takes on difficult topic,” she says.\n\nAdded to ‘Archduke’s’ absurdity, to further poke at its rabid misogyny, is the fact that Zizka cast HotHouse actresses Suli Holum and Sarah Gilko as two of Archduke’s three destitute boys (Brandon J. Pierce plays the third).\n\n“I nearly made these Belgrade youth all women actors, as there is a femininity to their youth,” Zizka says with a laugh.\n\nDuring her directorial history at the Wilma, Blanka has overseen the work of illustrious playwrights such as Paula Vogel, Richard Bean, Tom Stoppard, Tony Kushner, Sarah Ruhl, James Ijames, Rajiv Joseph’s, and William Shakespeare. Yet, Zizka — as important a theatrical theorist as she is a practitioner — does not see a connective tissue between all of her productions or their vision.\n\n“There is no through-line, only that which excites me. The times are changing. I am changing. I guess that I just react to that change of time and place.”\n\nWhat Zizka can reflect on is how, in the five years since her departure, the Wilma’s new artistic directorial cohort has thrived—and how the theater she nurtured for decades was honored with the 2024 Tony Award for Best Regional Theatre.\n\n“I am very proud and excited by what is going on at the Wilma, especially what is happening with the HotHouse company actors – they have truly grown as creators,” she says. “By bringing several artistic directors together to take over the Wilma allows them to bring varied life experiences into discussion and create a new aesthetic for the Wilma. And while I was there for the first three years as a consultant, now it is running at full speed without any of my input.\n\n“I still come in from time to time, but now it is all theirs… And I can see that the Wilma has grown into something new and exciting.”\n\n‘Archduke’ will be on stage at the Wilma Theater from April 15 through May 4.

And while the semi-finals might be a huge competitive stage for a new manager, playing against Panama – the lowest-ranked team in the final four –means the United States stands the greatest chance of making it to the finals, at least.\n\nWith key players like Folarin Balogun, Auston Trusty, Antonee Robinson, and Ricardo Pepi missing, Pochettino may have to rely on Norwich City’s Josh Sargent or, perhaps, turn to MLS stars Patrick Agyemang or Brian White to lead the team’s attack.\n\nRegardless, the presence of Christian Pulisic, Weston Mckennie, and Tyler Adams should help the USMNT seek a fourth triumph. This would be a dream start for Pochettino, who is coming off an outside-top-four finish and a trophyless season with the London Blues that culminated in his sacking.\n\nThe Argentine has shown himself capable, winning five of his six games as USMNT coach, especially the two legs of the Concacaf Nations League quarter-final against Jamaica.\n\nUnited States midfielder Tyler Adams (4) celebrates his goal with forward Christian Pulisic during the first half of a CONCACAF Nations League Final against Mexico, Sunday, March 24, 2024 in Arlington Texas (AP Photo/Julio Cortez)\n\nPanama\n\nPanama seems the weakest link of the four and a perfect lamb for the United States’ slaughter, but they can’t be totally ruled out. The USMNT is struggling to find established options in its attack, and this may negatively impact its output in the opposition goal.\n\nWhile the United States edged Panama 2-0 five months ago in a friendly, which was Pochettino’s first game in charge, Panama defeated the USMNT in their last two competitive encounters – an indication that they can’t be totally written off.\n\nPanama fought tooth and nail to book a spot in the semi-final, defeating Costa Rica 3-2 on aggregate after they were reduced to ten men late in the second leg in their bid to hold on to a 2-2 draw. Thomas Christiansen’s men, in recent times, have proven they can fight. As such, the USMNT should be ready for a fierce battle.\n\nHowever, even if they manage to get past the USMNT, they’re still not favorites, as they pose the least threat to any of the remaining teams.\n\nPlayers for Panama look on during the penalty shootout of a CONCACAF Gold Cup semifinal soccer match against the United States, Wednesday, July 12, 2023, in San Diego.

And it’s handled the pressure quite well. The Canadians have been undergoing a resurgence lately, making it to the last World Cup for only the second time in history and for the first time since 1986.\n\nThey topped this with an impressive Copa America run, having successfully built a star-studded team that can compete with the best. With coach Jesse Marsch, the Canadians have flourished in their pressing style, adding some physicality and dynamism to their game.\n\nOne major strength of the Canadians is their speed. The Canadian roster is deluged with speedsters, including Davies, Shaffelburg, Buchanan, Jebbison, and Moise Bombito, who was the fastest in Europe’s top five leagues in 2024.\n\nCanada takes on a Mexico side that has been engaged in a fierce physical battle lately. This fixture seems to intrigue the fans more than the other semi-final fixture between the United States and Panama.\n\nSep 7, 2024; Kansas City, Kansas, USA; United States forward Christian Pulisic (10) slides for the ball against Canada midfielder Ali Ahmed (20) and midfielder Richie Laryea (22) during the second half at Children’s Mercy Park.

This time, they’ll be looking to do what they’ve never achieved in the history of the Concacaf Nations League.\n\nThe Mexicans, however, face a familiar foe. Only after surmounting the Canadians will they be able to conquer the USMNT in their third appearance at the Concacaf Nations League final.\n\nThe Mexicans are blessed with in-form strikers: Fulham’s Raul Jimenez and AC Milan’s Santiago Gimenez. As they lock horns with the Canadians, these two teams have created an intense rivalry in recent years, with two draws and one win apiece in their last four encounters.\n\nJavier Aguirre’s team is known for its physicality. However, they’ve struggled against pacy sides like the Canadians, committing 24 fouls in their last meeting. This time, both teams do have a chance, but the Canadians are favorites on many sites.\n\nDENVER, CO – JUNE 06: Mexico forward Jesus Corona (17) celebrates with teammates after scoring a goal in action during the CONCACAF Nations League finals between Mexico and the United States on June 06, 2021, at Empower Field at Mile High in Denver, CO.

The station was last refurbished ahead of the 1976 Bicentennial, only to be closed three years after the celebrations, according to PATCO.\n\nConstruction work began in March 2022, and the stop is now equipped with elevators, escalators and ramps to be accessible for people with disabilities, transit officials said. Crews also kept and restored the station’s original green and white subway tiles.\n\nPATCO leaders, in a statement, said the reopening will provide more options for riders, and they are hoping it spurs more travel within Philadelphia, between Rittenhouse and Franklin squares.\n\nThe stop will be the 14th on the line, which runs from Lindenwold to 15th/16th and Locust streets. About 5.6 million PATCO trips were logged in 2024, according to the agency.\n\nA subway station is not the only new development for Franklin Square. New bathroom facilities and traffic safety improvements, including bike lanes and sidewalk extensions, are expected to be completed in the coming months. Historic Philadelphia Inc., which manages the park, is also raising money for an extensive playground rebuild.",

Some key functions of the department include student loans and financial aid, civil rights enforcement and college accreditation.\n\n\n\nPresident Donald Trump signed an executive order Thursday aiming to eliminate the Department of Education.\n\n\"I will sign an executive order to begin eliminating the federal Department of Education once and for all,\" Trump said at a White House event celebrating the executive order Thursday. \"And it sounds strange, doesn't it? Department of education. We're going to eliminate it. And everybody knows it's right. And the Democrats know it's right. And I hope they're going to be voting for it, because ultimately it may come before them. But, everybody knows it's right. And we have to get our children educated. We're we're not doing well with the world of education in this country.

It will continue managing federal student loans and Pell grants. Other critical department duties such as enforcement of civil rights will remain, she said, but she did not say how they will be fulfilled.\n\nRELATED: Education Department lays off nearly 50% of its staff: What to know\n\nTrump's administration has already been gutting the agency.

The department’s key functions include:\n\nStudent loans and financial aid\n\nCivil rights enforcement\n\nCollege accreditation\n\nMoney for schools\n\nClosing the department would mean redistributing each of those duties to another agency.\n\nAt her confirmation hearing, McMahon said she would preserve core initiatives, including Title I money for low-income schools and Pell grants for low-income college students. The goal of the administration, she said, would be \"a better functioning Department of Education.\"\n\nBy the numbers:\n\nFederal funding makes up a relatively small portion of public school budgets — roughly 14%, according to The Associated Press.\n\nRELATED: Trump's anti-DEI crusade targets more than 50 universities: See the full list\n\nColleges and universities are more reliant on it, through research grants along with federal financial aid that helps students pay their tuition.\n\nThe Department of Education oversees $1.6 trillion in federal student loans.\n\nWhy does Trump want to eliminate the Department of Education?\n\nWhat they're saying:\n\nTrump is not the only Republican candidate to be critical of the department - or even call for its dissolution.\n\nRonald Reagan also aimed to eliminate the Department of Education, created under President Carter, as part of the 1980 Republican Party platform. The LA Times described it as a \"major goal\" when Reagan took office in 1981.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump speaks to the media during a guided tour of the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts before leading a board meeting on March 17, 2025 in Washington, DC. The president is expected to sign an order to shut down the Expand\n\nIn Jan. 1985, Reagan said, \"As you know, I have previously recommended the abolition of the Department of Education. This was because I believed that federal educational programs could be administered effectively without a Cabinet-level agency. While I still feel that this is the best approach, that proposal has received very little support in Congress.\"\n\nTrump has said the department has been infiltrated by \"radicals,\" and his education plan pledges to cut funding for schools that defy him on a multitude of issues.\n\n\"We’re going to end education coming out of Washington, D.C.,\" Trump said on his website last year. In his platform, he pledged to ensure schools are \"free from political meddling.\"\n\nTrump has reiterated his desire to sign the executive order, telling reporters in the Oval Office recently: \"I want to bring the schools back to the states.\"\n\nThe other side:\n\nAdvocates for public schools said eliminating the department would leave children behind in an American education system that is fundamentally unequal.\n\n\"This isn’t fixing education. It’s making sure millions of children never get a fair shot. And we’re not about to let that happen without a fight,\" the National Parents Union said in a statement.",

Eichorn is currently in custody, with a bail set at $75,000.\n\nHis next court appearance is scheduled for March 20.\n\nSenate GOP to file motion to expel Eichorn\n\nSenate Republicans announced they will make a motion Thursday morning to expel Eichorn from the Senate.\n\nMinnesota Senate Republicans released a statement Thursday night.\n\n\"There is no question that these charges merit expulsion,\" Senate Republican Leader Mark Johnson (R-East Grand Forks) said. \"We owe it to the public to hold our members to the highest standards, and this violation of the public trust is so severe we must act. It is my hope that this quick resolution gives Senator Eichorn time to focus on his family.\"\n\nFederal charges against Eichorn\n\nWhat the charges say:\n\nAccording to the federal criminal complaint, Bloomington police began an undercover operation to target commercial sex involving juveniles. They placed an online ad offering commercial sex. Anyone who reached out would be connected to an undercover officer but would think it was a minor.\n\nPolice began receiving messages on March 11 from Eichorn, who said: \"I saw your post and [sic] chance you are still available tonight?\" and then later, \"What’s a guy gota do to get with the hottest girl online tonight.\"\n\nOver the course of messaging over several days, the undercover officer repeatedly said that she was not 18 but was, in fact, 17 years old, charges state. Eichorn proceeded to ask the undercover officer about pricing for various sex acts she might perform, and then Eichorn arranged an in-person meeting to pay for sex.\n\nHe also requested that the undercover officer (who he thought was a 17-year-old girl) send him \"a naught[y] pic\" including one \"with lot less clothes,\" charges state.\n\nEichorn agreed to meet, but were met by police and arrested. In his vehicle, police found cash and a condom, charges allege.\n\nWho is Sen. Eichorn?\n\nLocal perspective:\n\nMinnesota records show Sen. Eichorn was first elected in 2016 and is currently representing Minnesota Senate District 6, which includes Cass, Crow Wing and Itasca counties, with his term ending in 2027.\n\nHe serves on the Environment, Climate and Legacy Committee, in addition to the Finance Committee and the State and Local Government Committee.\n\nEichorn is a Republican who made headlines earlier this week for being a sponsor of a bill that would declare \"Trump derangement syndrome\" a mental illness. He introduced that bill the same day he was arrested, records show.\n\nHis state senate bio says he is married with four children.\n\nAccording to Eichorn's senate campaign site, which is currently down, he proclaims himself as being \"pro-life, pro-Second Amendment, and in favor of a fiscally conservative government.\"\n\nMinnesota legislative records also show he unsuccessfully ran for District 5B of the Minnesota House of Representatives in 2014.\n\nMinnesota lawmakers respond to Sen. Eichorn's arrest\n\nWhat they're saying:\n\nFollowing the arrest, lawmakers from both sides of the aisle have released statements both distancing themselves from the senator and calling on his resignation.\n\nOn Tuesday, Minnesota Senate Republican leadership released a statement saying, \"We are shocked by these reports and this alleged conduct demands an immediate resignation. Justin has a difficult road ahead, and he needs to focus on his family.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Minnesota House Speaker Rep. Lisa Demuth (R-Cold Spring) and leader Rep. Harry Niska (R-Ramsey), released a statement saying, \"Given the seriousness of the charges, Senator Eichorn should resign. While he is entitled to due process, we must hold legislators to a higher standard.\"\n\nOn the other side of the aisle, Minnesota DFL Executive Director Heidi Kraus Kaplan released a statement saying, \"No one who solicits children belongs anywhere near public office or the State Capitol. The facts presented by the Bloomington Police Department make it clear that Senator Eichorn is an immediate danger to the public and must resign immediately.\"\n\nSpeaking on Wednesday afternoon, Gov. Walz also said Eichorn should resign when asked by reporters.\n\nMinnesota Senate power balance\n\nDig deeper:\n\nWith Minnesota Senate seats currently 34-33 in favor of DFL members, a resignation by Sen. Eichorn would further tip the scales of power in favor of Minnesota's Democratic lawmakers.\n\nMeanwhile, a trial for Minnesota DFL State Senator Nicole Mitchell stemming from an April 2024 burglary in Detroit Lakes, Minnesota, is currently on pause until after the end of the legislative session is completed.\n\n\"The Senate has a responsibility to hold itself to the highest standards,\" said Minnesota Senator Republican Leader Mark Johnson in a previous statement referring to her motion to delay any decision until after the session.",

        "content": "The Brief A Seattle man lost access to benefits, Medicare, and his bank after SSA mistakenly declared him deceased. The error comes amid staffing cuts led by Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Social Security officials say such mistakes are rare—but could worsen under DOGE's downsizing.\n\n\n\nA Seattle man was mistakenly declared dead by the Social Security Administration (SSA), leading to the sudden loss of his benefits, Medicare coverage, and even access to his bank funds, according to The Seattle Times.\n\nLeonard \"Ned\" Johnson, 82, first learned of the error when his wife received a condolence letter from their bank in February. The letter informed her that Social Security had reported Johnson as deceased — and as a result, his December and January benefits had been clawed back, totaling $5,201, The Seattle Times reported.\n\nThe error also cut off his February and March payments, canceled his Medicare coverage, and flagged his credit score as belonging to a deceased person, making it impossible to obtain new credit.\n\n\"You wake up one day and discover you’re dead,\" Johnson told The Seattle Times. \"It’s been truly surreal.\"Johnson\n\nJohnson and his wife tried for weeks to contact SSA, calling daily without success. Eventually, he went in person to a local Social Security office in downtown Seattle, where he waited hours before jumping the line and proving he was alive with his passport. While his benefits were partially restored, his March payment was still missing as of last week.\n\nDOGE cuts blamed for surge in Social Security errors\n\nThe backstory:\n\nJohnson’s case comes amid rising concerns about deep staffing cuts across the SSA under President Trump’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), now led by Elon Musk. The Biden-appointed SSA director has warned that DOGE's actions could push the agency toward collapse.\n\nAs part of a broader cost-cutting mission, DOGE is proposing the elimination of 7,000 SSA jobs, The Seattle Times reported. A ProPublica investigation recently described the effort as \"frenetic and error-riddled,\" with multiple local offices at risk of closing. Johnson said the Seattle office he visited was severely understaffed, with just two employees facing a backlog of cases.\n\nRELATED: Are millions of dead people really receiving Social Security benefits?\n\nMeanwhile, Musk and Trump continue to claim millions of dead people are fraudulently collecting Social Security benefits. \"We have millions and millions of people over 100 years old\" receiving checks, Trump said in February. Musk echoed the sentiment on X, writing, \"maybe Twilight is real and there are a lot of vampires collecting Social Security.\"\n\nWhat the actual data says about Social Security fraud\n\nBy the numbers:\n\nDespite the rhetoric, government watchdogs say these claims are greatly exaggerated. A July 2024 SSA inspector general report found that improper payments accounted for less than 1% of all benefits paid from 2015 to 2022. Most errors were made to living individuals due to eligibility or income reporting mistakes.\n\nA separate Treasury Department review found $31 million in federal payments — including but not limited to Social Security — went to deceased individuals over a three-year period. That amounts to $215 million recoverable over that time span, a fraction of the SSA’s total budget.\n\nThe SSA uses outdated software, including COBOL-based systems that can default to extremely old birth dates when information is missing. This leads to odd entries in the system — like people listed as born in the 1800s — but not actively receiving benefits.\n\nFILE - In this photo illustration, a Social Security card sits alongside checks from the U.S. Treasury on October 14, 2021 in Washington, DC. (Photo illustration by Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images)\n\nThe SSA has safeguards in place, including halting benefits for anyone listed as older than 115 unless proof of life is submitted.\n\nWhy you should care if SSA errors increase\n\nWhy you should care:\n\nFor Johnson, the mistake nearly derailed his finances and access to healthcare. It also left him questioning how many others could be affected — especially under increased pressure from DOGE.\n\nSocial Security’s own leadership has pushed back against the narrative that fraud is rampant. \"These are records we never bothered with,\" the agency’s director said of outdated entries that have no impact on benefit payouts.\n\nExperts also warn that politicizing the agency’s database issues could mislead the public. \"Let’s not pretend [fraud] is where the system’s biggest financial problems are,\" said George Mason University senior researcher Chuck Blahous.\n\nJohnson’s wife told Snopes that while they’ve now resolved much of the situation, they were warned the \"death\" designation may resurface in future records or databases. One people-search website still lists Johnson as deceased.\n\nMore Americans could be wrongly cut off from benefits\n\nWhat's next:\n\nWhile Johnson’s Social Security and Medicare access have been partially restored, his case may foreshadow a bigger problem. The Seattle Times reports that SSA agents cautioned him that once someone is flagged as dead in the federal system, the error can recur — and cause further disruptions.\n\nPam Johnson said the experience left them wondering how many others, particularly seniors with no backup income, could survive a similar ordeal.\n\n\"We think Ned is the canary in a coal mine,\" she told Snopes. \"This is a much bigger story.\"",

Earlier in the week, a senior defense official told reporters that roughly 50,000 to 60,000 civilian jobs will be cut in the Defense Department.\n\nThe backstory:\n\nA New York Times report published late Thursday said that the Pentagon planned to brief Musk on Friday about the U.S. military’s plan for any war that could potentially break out with China. The story cited anonymous U.S. officials. A planned meeting at the Pentagon was confirmed by both Pentagon officials and Trump, although they denied any discussion involving a briefing on a potential war with China.\n\nWhat they're saying:\n\nIn a post on Musk's X platform, Hegseth emphasized that \"this is NOT a meeting about ‘top secret China war plans.' It’s an informal meeting about innovation, efficiencies & smarter production. Gonna be great!\"\n\nSeparately, Trump wrote in a post on Truth Social that \"China will not even be mentioned or discussed.\" \"How disgraceful it is that the discredited media can make up such lies,\" he added. \"Anyway, the story is completely untrue!!!\"\n\nFor his part, Musk called the New York Times \"pure propaganda\" and said he looks \"forward to the prosecution of those at the Pentagon who are leaking maliciously false information to NYT.\"\n\nBig picture view:\n\nMusk has faced intense blowback from some lawmakers and voters for his chainsaw-wielding approach to laying off workers and slashing programs, although Trump heavily campaigned on the idea and his supporters have hailed it. Many have also raised concerns about potential conflicts of interest as he runs SpaceX, Tesla and other large companies with big federal contracts.\n\nFILE - US President Donald Trump, Pete Hegseth, US secretary of defense, and Howard Lutnick, US commerce secretary during a cabinet meeting at the White House in Washington, DC, US, on Feb. 26, 2025.

Commissioner Bethel noted that the man was not handcuffed in the wagon as he volunteered to be taken to the hospital and was not in custody.\n\nWhen the van arrived at the hospital, the man exited the back of the van and the two officers who transported him were directing him into the hospital. At some point during that conversation, Commissioner Bethel says the man became combative with the officers and a physical struggle ensued.\n\nBethel says the officers and suspect eventually ended up on the ground and the suspect was attempting to take one of the officers’ firearms. The officers deployed their Tasers, but they were not effective.\n\nThe suspect was able to get a hold of one of the officers guns during the struggle, according to Bethel.\n\n‘Shortly thereafter, there is an exchange of gunfire between the individual who now has the police officer’s weapon, and his partner,\" Bethel says.\n\nOne of the officers was struck in his bulletproof vest, about an inch from the bottom of the vest.

I'm sure we will over the next few weeks as we head into the owners' meetings. So I'm aware that we did, but really haven't had many discussions about it.\n\n‘Tush push’ popularized by the Eagles\n\nThe backstory:\n\nAccording to the NFL Network, the tush push is also known as the \"Brotherly Shove\" and originated in Philadelphia, where the Eagles popularized the play by lining up two teammates behind quarterback Jalen Hurts, who received the snap, lunged forward and, with the push of his two fellow Eagles from behind, attempted to gain the necessary yardage for a fresh set of downs or a touchdown.\n\nThe play was used during a 40-22 victory over the Kansas City Chiefs in Super Bowl 59, FOX Sports reported.\n\nRELATED: When is Opening Day for MLB?

But there are some concerns. Our health and safety committee has laid that out today with a brief conversation on the injury report. There's some challenges, some concerns that they'll share with the broader group tomorrow. But the tush push will become a topic of discussion moving into March.\"\n\nNFL teams make proposals\n\nWhat's next:\n\nTeams made several other proposals released Wednesday that will be added to additional ones made by the competition committee to be considered at the league meetings later this month, including a change to the overtime rule and the so-called legal tampering period in free agency.\n\nThe Detroit Lions also proposed that playoff seeding be done based on record instead of automatically placing division winners in the top four spots.\n\nAny rule change must be approved by 24 out of 32 team owners.",

This did not account for UPenn’s total federal funding, which the university previously reported last year was around $1 billion.\n\nThe pause is not a direct result of the investigation into UPenn, which the Department of Education announced a day after the president signed the \"Keeping Men Out of Women’s Sports\" executive order on Feb. 5.\n\nFeatured article\n\nActing Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights Craig Trainor said in a statement provided by the department last month that three institutions would be investigated for suspected Title IX violations.\n\nIn addition to UPenn, San Jose State University, which made headlines in the fall after several schools refused to play the women’s volleyball team because of a trans athlete on the roster, and the Massachusetts Interscholastic Athletic Association are also being investigated for suspected violations.\n\nThe other side:\n\nIn a statement to FOX 29, a Penn spokesperson released the following response:\n\n\"We are aware of media reports suggesting a suspension of $175 million in federal funding to Penn, but have not yet received any official notification or any details. It is important to note, however, that Penn has always followed NCAA and Ivy League policies regarding student participation on athletic teams. We have been in the past, and remain today, in full compliance with the regulations that apply to not only Penn, but all of our NCAA and Ivy League peer institutions.\"\n\nThe backstory:\n\nUPenn first made headlines during the 2022 season when Lia Thomas, a transgender student athlete, was put on the women’s team and would eventually go on to win a national championship title in the women’s 500-yard freestyle.\n\nThomas would also tie with former Kentucky swimmer Riley Gaines for fifth place in the 200-yard freestyle that year, although it would be Thomas that solely received the trophy during the awards ceremony.\n\nThomas’ participation sparked a national debate surrounding girls’ and women’s sports, which, under the Trump administration, has seen several states at odds with federal law.\n\nDig deeper:\n\nLast week, the U.S. Department of Agriculture paused funding to the University of Maine System, a network of eight public colleges in the state, but days later, U.S. Sen. Susan Collins' office said the funding freeze had been reversed.\n\nAdditionally, this week, Rep. Mary Miller, R-Ill., called on the Trump administration to pull federal funding from an Illinois school district after one mother accused her 13-year-old daughter’s school of forcing girls to change in front of another trans student in the girl’s locker room.\n\nUPenn has posted several statements online as the university braced for cuts in federal funding.",

        "content": "The Brief President Trump signed an executive order Thursday to begin the process of dismantling the Department of Education. The White House acknowledged that the POTUS doesn't have the authority to completely shut it down. Leaders in Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Delaware are reacting to the news.\n\n\n\nPresident Donald Trump signed an executive order to start the elimination of the Department of Education.\n\nThe move would fulfill a campaign promise and a long-time policy goal for conservatives.\n\nLeaders across Pennsylvania and New Jersey have released their reactions.\n\nWhat we know:\n\nThe president claims the education department spends too much money for too little return and education decisions would be better left to the states.\n\nThe Department of Education handles key functions including student loans and financial aid, civil rights enforcement and college accreditation.\n\nRelated article\n\nWhat they're saying:\n\nThe School District of Philadelphia Superintendent Tony B. Watlington, Sr. said the following of President Trump's executive order regarding the U.S. Department of Education:\n\n\"Recent actions coming out of Washington over the past two months – including recent significant cuts to and anticipated dismantling of the U.S. Department of Education – are understandably raising concern about impacts on the educational landscape across the country, including the School District of Philadelphia. While we navigate the evolving issues, our commitment to teaching every student will not waiver.I also want to reaffirm the District’s mission to work with urgency to provide every student–no matter their race, ethnicity, immigration status, national origin, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, familial status, religion, or person’s abilities, with the opportunity to achieve positive life outcomes. Our practices will continue to be aligned with both the Board of Education’s policies and all legal obligations as we continue to prepare students to imagine and realize any future they desire. We are actively monitoring the rapidly evolving developments out of Washington and throughout our nation. As we move forward together, I will provide periodic updates about impacts on the District and our students. I appreciate your continued partnership and patience during these uncertain times.\"\n\nDelaware Governor Matt Meyer released the following statement condemning the executive order:\n\n\"Let’s cut the bullshit, not education. Schools are already underfunded, teachers underpaid, and students underserved. As a former public school teacher, I know what’s at stake. \"And I know this—Donald Trump and the Republican governors standing with him should be ashamed. If they think we’ll let them gut public education without a fight, they’re dead wrong. We will stand up, push back, and demand every dollar our students deserve.\"\n\nPennsylvania State Senator Vincent Hughes, Senate Democratic Appropriations Chair, issued the following statement directing Secretary McMahon to abolish the Department of Education:\n\n\"Any move to abolish the Department of Education is a slap in the face to students, teachers, and parents. Yet again, President Trump, Musk, and Congressional Republicans are trying to convince the public that cutting funding, services, and jobs will bring us to an alleged golden age of America. The reality of their reckless and sloppy approach is that making cuts to education will do nothing but cause learning loss, overextended and burnt-out teachers, bigger class sizes, less resources for special education students, more toxic and broken school buildings, less technology in our classrooms, and nowhere for students and parents to turn when they are being discriminated against.\n\nPennsylvania has a court order to adequately and constitutionally fund 70% of PA schools. Any federal cut to education funding and support will undermine our attempts to fix that problem. We need Pennsylvania’s Congressional lawmakers to stand up and fight for the education of our students.\"\n\nNew Jersey Governor Murphy released the following statement:\n\n\"President Trump’s directive to dismantle the U.S. Department of Education is unconscionable and unconstitutional. This Executive Order will have disastrous ramifications — especially for our nation’s students. \"New Jersey receives approximately $1.2 billion in federal funding from the U.S. Department of Education, the vast majority of which supports low-income students and students with disabilities. By signing this Executive Order, the Trump Administration is endangering vital resources for K-12 students and risking increased costs for those pursuing higher education. \"Simply put, the Trump Administration is going out of its way to create chaos and raise costs for our nation’s families. I urge New Jersey’s Congressional delegation to protect federal funding and preserve the legally prescribed functions of the U.S. Department of Education. My Administration will take every possible step we can to support their efforts.\"\n\nNew Jersey Policy Perspective (NJPP) said the order would devastate New Jersey's communities. In respond, NJPP) released the following statement:\n\n\"Any weakening of USED would have far-reaching and long-term disastrous effects nationwide and on New Jersey’s communities, especially for children in school districts with historically higher concentrations of poverty. Even if Congress chose to eliminate USED, much of its work would have to be offloaded to other departments or agencies, undermining efforts to improve efficiency and reduce spending. \"This latest executive order is an illegal attempt to realize a far-right goal outlined in Project 2025 — and ultimately, it is the first step toward dismantling public education as a whole. However, New Jersey’s schools are among the best in the nation and its residents are strong believers in public schools and college access. Once again, the president demonstrates he is severely out of touch with the values that make the Garden State great,\" Mark Weber, Special Analyst for Education Policy, NJPP.",

        "content": "The Brief Voters in a western Pennsylvania state House district will decide which party will hold the speakership. The race pits McKeesport Police Officer Dan Goughnour against longtime volunteer firefighter and current White Oak Borough Council President Chuck Davis. Democrats hope to keep the seat and maintain Democratic Speaker Joanna McClinton as the chamber's presiding officer.\n\n\n\nPennsylvania's special election next week will determine whether Democrats or Republicans will control the state House, a glimpse of voter sentiment in the swing state that helped return President Donald Trump to the White House.\n\nThe backstory:\n\nThe death of Democratic state Rep. Matt Gergely has left the House deadlocked at 101-101 since January. A Democratic win on Tuesday would keep Speaker Joanna McClinton of Philadelphia as the chamber’s presiding officer, while a Republican flip would enable the GOP to pick a different speaker, control the voting schedule and install their own members as committee chairs.\n\nThe race pits Democrat Dan Goughnour, 39, a police officer who supervises detectives and serves on the school board in McKeesport, against Republican Chuck Davis, 66, a fire chief who also serves as president of the White Oak Borough Council. Libertarian Adam Kitta is also on the ballot.\n\nSteelmaking towns once thrived in the district southeast of Pittsburgh at the confluence of the Monongahela and Youghiogheny rivers, but the the area known as the Mon Valley is now economically challenged.\n\nIn a visit to the district last month, Democratic National Committee Chairman Ken Martin said a win will show that Democrats are willing to fight for their values. Pennsylvania Democrats lost a U.S. Senate seat and all three row offices — treasurer, attorney general and auditor general — in the November election, along with giving Trump a slim majority of the state’s votes.\n\nDig deeper:\n\nIt would be a seismic upset for Republicans to flip it after the district went for Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris over Trump in November, 58% to 42%. Gergely won it with 75% of the vote in a special election in 2023, and Republicans did not field a candidate against him last fall. In the 2022 gubernatorial race, Democrat Josh Shapiro also won three-quarters of the district's vote, swamping Republican state Sen. Doug Mastriano of Franklin County.\n\nHouse Democratic Campaign Committee executive director Madeline Zann said she senses some increased enthusiasm among volunteers and small-dollar donors that may be prompted by concerns about the Trump administration. She said the candidates will have to focus on issues closer to home and getting core supporters to vote, since many people ignore special elections.\n\n\"It’s a turnout election in many ways,\" Zann said.\n\nRep. Jamie Barton of Schuylkill County, who leads campaigns for the Republican caucus in the state House, said Davis is in an uphill fight in the 35th, calling it a \"strong-leaning Democratic district.\" But he said new local GOP leadership has energized Republican voters.\n\n\"No matter who looks good on paper you’ve got to have the election,\" Barton said. \"We’re not taking anything for granted.\"\n\nAnother special election on Tuesday will determine who fills the state Senate seat that Ryan Aument, R-Lancaster, relinquished to work for Republican U.S. Sen. Dave McCormick. Republican Lancaster County Commissioner Josh Parsons is running against Democrat James Andrew Malone, the mayor of East Petersburg. A win by Malone in the Republican-leaning district would not threaten the GOP state Senate majority. The third candidate is Libertarian Zachary Moore.",

        "content": "The Brief As the one-year anniversary of the Francis Scott Key Bridge collapse approaches, the NTSB is issuing safety recommendations to owners of nearly 70 bridges in the United States. The March 26, 2024 collapse claimed the lives of six construction workers who were on the bridge when it was struck by the Denali container ship. Several bridges in Delaware, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania have been urged to assess their risk of a collapse if struck by a vessel.\n\n\n\nNearly a year after a container ship struck Baltimore’s Francis Scott Key Bridge, causing it to collapse, the National Transportation Safety Board is urging owners of dozens of other bridges to asses their vulnerability.\n\nNTSB officials held a press conference on Thursday where they provided an update on the collision and collapse that claimed the lives of six construction workers who were working on the bridge when it was struck.\n\nNext Wednesday, March 26, will mark one year since the Denali container ship lost power and slammed into a pier of the bridge as it headed out of the Port of Baltimore.\n\nWhat they're saying:\n\nNTSB Chair Jennifer Homendy says the Key Bridge Collapse could have been prevented if the Maryland Transportation Authority (MDTA) had conducted the correct vulnerability and risk assessments and studied recent vessel traffic as recommended by the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials, or AASHTO.\n\n\"The MDTA would have been aware that the bridge was almost 30 times greater than the risk threshold that AASHTO sets for critical essential bridges. Thirty times greater,\" Homendy said.\n\nNTSB issues safety recommendations to other bridge owners\n\nBig picture view:\n\nThe NTSB also made four urgent safety recommendations to bridge owners, urging them to assess their risk of a collapse if they were struck by a vessel.\n\nTheir recommendation specifically targeted 30 owners of 68 bridges in 19 states, including Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Delaware, and other bridges in Maryland.\n\n\"Frankly, we've been sounding the alarm on this since the tragedy occurred and in testimony before the House Transportation and Infrastructure last April,\" Homendy said. \"We need action. Public safety depends on it.\"\n\nThe NTSB’s report does not suggest that the 68 bridges are certain to collapse, but that they need to be assessed.\n\n\"So what we are trying to do is prevent something in the future. That is always what we're trying to do,\" she said. \"They need to know risk and take action.. we just don't know right now.\"\n\nDelaware, New Jersey, Pennsylvania bridge risk assessments\n\nLocal perspective:\n\nThe NTSB shared a list of 68 bridges across the country that have unknown levels of risk of collapse from a vessel collision.\n\nBelow is a list of bridges in the tri-state area that were included in the report. The owners include the US Army Corps of Engineers, Delaware River Port Authority, New Jersey Turnpike Authority, and Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission.\n\nDelaware Bridges\n\nSummit Bridge\n\nSaint Georges Bridge\n\nReedy Point Bridge\n\nNew Jersey Bridges\n\nCommodore Barry Bridge\n\nVincent R. Casciano (Newark Bay) Bridge\n\nPennsylvania Bridges\n\nWalt Whitman Bridge\n\nBenjamin Franklin Bridge\n\nBetsy Ross Bridge\n\nDelaware River Turnpike Bridge\n\nWhat makes these bridges vulnerable?\n\nDig deeper:\n\nIn 1991, the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials published guidance on how to calculate bridge vulnerability assessments.\n\nAll bridges designed afterward were required to be evaluated, and in 2009, the group reiterated its recommendation to also conduct assessments for older bridges.\n\nThe 68 bridges listed in the NTSB report are \"frequented by ocean-going vessels,\" were constructed before the AASHTO guidance was issued and have not undergone an assessment.\n\nTherefore, the level of risk is unknown and bridge owners are \"likely unaware of their bridges’ risk of catastrophic collapse from a vessel collision and the potential need to implement countermeasures to reduce the bridges’ vulnerability.\"\n\nWhat's next:\n\nThe NTSB also released 1,000 pages of their investigation, including interviews, into the collapse. They will release audio transcripts and data recorder details in the coming weeks with a final report expected this fall.\n\nThe replacement bridge will cost about $2 billion and be completed by 2028",

Payments will vary depending on individual circumstances, with a maximum payment of $1,400 per person. The IRS estimates the total payments to amount to approximately $2.4 billion.\n\nMore information from the IRS can be found online.\n\nREAD MORE: Deadline approaches to claim $1,400 IRS stimulus check – are you eligible?\n\nMore than $1 billion in unclaimed refunds for tax year 2021\n\nWhat we know:\n\nThe IRS estimates that more than $1 billion in refunds remain unclaimed by taxpayers who have not filed their Form 1040, Federal Income Tax Return, for the 2021 tax year.\n\nThe revenue collection agency estimates the median refund amount is $781 for 2021.

We think DOGE will save $2 trillion in total. You take 20% of that-that's $400 billion. You divide that by the number of American households that will pay federal income tax this year. That's $79 million,\" Fishback said.\n\n\"That gets you $5,000 to every American taxpaying household next summer. It'll have President Trump's signature on it, because without him without his leadership this would not be possible.\"\n\n\"The conditional nature of the tax refund (available only to payers of federal income tax CY 2025) incentivizes labor force participation because only net payers of federal income tax in CY 2025 are eligible to receive President Trump's 'DOGE Dividend,'\" Fishback wrote on his website, mydogedividend.com\n\nAs of now, no updates have been provided as to the status of the DOGE Dividend proposal.\n\nREAD MORE: Trump DOGE Dividend Checks: Status and who could qualify for payment if it happens",

        "content": "The Brief Police across multiple townships within New Jersey and Pennsylvania have issued warnings after discovering skimming devices at various locations. Police are asking folks to check their bank accounts and credit card statements for any unusual transactions.\n\n\n\nSkimming devices have been discovered at multiple 7-Eleven stores and ATMs in New Jersey and Pennsylvania.\n\nHere's what we know.\n\nWhat we know:\n\nMontgomery County\n\nOn March 17, Cheltenham police say they recovered a skimming device from an ATM at the 7-Eleven convenience store located at 250 S. Easton Road.\n\nThey say the employees at the store noticed the device and removed it on Sunday, March 16 at around 7:00 p.m.\n\nSkimming devices allow criminals to record information from the magnetic strip on your debit card and subsequently create a duplicate card. The criminals also install a camera, which records when you enter your pin number.\n\nCheltenham police say similar skimming devices have been found at other locations throughout Montgomery County.\n\nOver in Abington Township, police say they recovered credit card skimming devices that had been installed on ATMs.\n\nImage 1 of 4 ▼ Picture of skimming device found in Abington Township.\n\nTo protect yourself from becoming a victim of credit card skimming, it is recommended that you visually inspect the ATM for suspicious modifications prior to use. Does it wiggle or seem loose? If so, DO NOT swipe or insert your card, notify the business and local law enforcement. Also cover up the keypad when entering your pin and use contactless-enabled cards or phones for safe and easy payments by tapping your card or phone on a contactless-enabled payment terminal.\n\nCamden County\n\nOn March 19, Camden County officers responded to the 7-Eleven located at 521 W. Kings Highway in Mt Ephram after store employees reported discovering a skimming device.\n\nUpon arrival, police say employees showed officers the device, which had been attached to the credit card machine at the store's register.\n\nThe device was designed to closely resemble the store's machine. Officers collected it as evidence.\n\nThey do not know how long the device was in place. However, they urge anyone who has recently used the credit card machine at the 7-Eleven to review their banking records.\n\nIf you notice any unauthorized transactions and suspect your card information may have been compromised, please report it to Mt. Ephraim Police Department.\n\n\n\nWhat you can do:\n\nAccording to Abington Township police, here are steps to identify a skimming machine:\n\nLoose or Misaligned Parts: Inspect the card reader for anything that seems loose, crooked, or out of place. Skimmers may be attached over the original reader.\n\nUnusual Attachments: Check for extra devices, such as unusual cameras or keypad overlays. Some criminals use these to capture PIN numbers.\n\nTampered Keypads: If the keypad feels different (loose or sticky), or if there are any signs of tampering, avoid using the machine.\n\nLook for Wires or Cameras: Skimming devices often include hidden cameras to record your PIN entry. Inspect around the ATM or pump for any suspicious items like tiny lenses or wires.\n\nDifficult Insertion: If your card doesn't go in smoothly, or the machine feels unusual when you insert your card, it may be compromised.\n\n\n\nStay safe by:\n\nAlways Inspect the Machine: Before using an ATM or gas pump, take a moment to check for anything unusual.\n\nCover Your PIN: Always shield the keypad when entering your PIN, even if the area looks secure.\n\nUse Trusted Locations: Stick to well-lit, busy areas where you're more likely to spot suspicious activity.\n\nCheck Your Statements: Regularly review your bank and credit card statements for unauthorized charges.\n\nReport Suspicious Activity: If you notice a possible skimming device, report it immediately to the police and contact your bank or card issuer.\n\nIf you suspect a skimming device, please call 911.\n\nFor more tips, visit https://www.fbi.gov/.../common-frauds-and-scams/skimming",

        "content": "article\n\nThe Brief Ben & Jerry’s has accused Unilever, its parent company, of unlawfully removing the ice cream maker’s CEO because of his social and political activism. It’s not the first time Ben & Jerry’s has sued its parent company for interfering with the brand’s progressive political statements.\n\n\n\nBen & Jerry’s, the popular Vermont-based ice cream brand known for its progressive politics, is suing its parent company Unilever over the firing of Ben & Jerry’s CEO.\n\nA lawsuit filed by Ben & Jerry’s this week says London-based Unilever informed its board on March 3 that it is removing and replacing Ben & Jerry’s CEO David Stever. According to Ben & Jerry’s, Stever’s removal violates its merger agreement with Unilever, which stipulates that a CEO’s removal can only happen after consulting with an advisory committee from Ben & Jerry’s board.\n\nWhy is Ben & Jerry’s suing Unilever?\n\nThe backstory:\n\nUnilever bought Ben & Jerry’s 25 years ago for $326 million. At the time, Ben & Jerry’s said the partnership would help the progressive Vermont-based ice cream company expand its social mission.\n\nBut in recent years, the merger has become fractured. In 2021, Ben & Jerry’s announced it would stop serving Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank and contested east Jerusalem. The following year, Unilever sold its Israeli business to a local company that said it would sell Ben & Jerry’s under its Hebrew and Arabic name throughout Israel and the West Bank.\n\nIn November, Ben & Jerry’s sued Unilever in federal court in New York, accusing it of silencing Ben & Jerry’s statements in support of Palestinians in the Gaza war.\n\nRELATED: Israel strikes Gaza: What happened to the ceasefire?\n\nIn that lawsuit, Ben & Jerry’s said Unilever also refused to let the company release a social media post that identified issues it believed would be challenged during President Donald Trump’s second term, including minimum wages, universal health care, abortion and climate change.\n\nTuesday’s filing was an amendment to that lawsuit.\n\nWhat’s next for Unilever and Ben & Jerry’s?\n\nWhat's next:\n\nUnilever says it’s planning to spin off its ice cream business — including Ben & Jerry’s — by the end of 2025 as part of a larger restructuring. Unilever also owns personal hygiene brands like Dove soap and food brands like Hellmann’s mayonnaise.\n\nWhen Ben & Jerry's first filed the lawsuit against Unilever in November, Unilever said at the time that it rejected the claims and planned to \"defend our case very strongly.\"\n\nUnilever provided the following statement to LiveNow from FOX:\n\n\"In line with the terms of the acquisition agreement, decisions on the appointment, compensation and removal of the Ben & Jerry's CEO will be made by Unilever after good faith consultation and discussion with the B&J's Independent Board. Regrettably, despite repeated attempts to engage the Board and follow the correct process, we are disappointed that the confidentiality of an employee career conversation has been made public. We hope that the B&J Independent Board will engage as per the original, agreed process.\"",

Glezmann's release is seen as a goodwill gesture by the Taliban to improve ties with the U.S., amid ongoing tensions following the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021. The U.S. continues to negotiate for the release of other detained Americans, with the fate of Afghan-American businessman Mahmood Habibi still unknown.\n\n\n\nAn American man who was held captive in Afghanistan for over two years has been freed by the Taliban and is now on his way back to the United States, according to the Associated Press. The release of George Glezmann, an airline mechanic from Atlanta, was facilitated through Qatari negotiators and the Trump administration, according to the State Department.\n\nAbducted in 2022\n\nWhat we know:\n\nGlezmann was abducted in December 2022 by the Taliban’s intelligence services while traveling through Afghanistan. The U.S. government officially classified him as wrongfully detained in 2023, indicating that his capture was politically motivated rather than criminal in nature.\n\nHis release was brokered by Qatar, a key diplomatic intermediary between the United States and the Taliban. Unlike a previous deal, which saw two Americans freed in exchange for a convicted narco-terrorist, Glezmann’s release did not involve any prisoner swap. Instead, the Taliban reportedly released him as a goodwill gesture to improve ties with the U.S.\n\nGlezmann departed the Kabul airport on Wednesday, according to FOX News. He will be met in Doha, Qatar, by Adam Boehler, a senior U.S. official handling hostage negotiations.\n\nOngoing tensions\n\nThe backstory:\n\nGlezmann’s captivity was part of ongoing tensions between the United States and the Taliban, following the chaotic U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021. While most of the world does not recognize the Taliban’s rule, the militant group continues to detain foreign nationals as leverage in diplomatic negotiations.\n\nThe Biden administration had previously considered trading Glezmann and other Americans for Muhammad Rahim, a high-profile Taliban detainee at Guantanamo Bay. However, Biden rejected the proposal unless the Taliban also agreed to release Afghan-American businessman Mahmood Habibi, whom the U.S. believes is also being held. The Taliban denies holding Habibi, creating further diplomatic deadlock.\n\nImage 1 of 2 ▼ George Flezmann released from captivity. CREDIT: Qatari Ministry of Foreign Affairs\n\nIn January 2025, the Taliban released two other detained Americans, Ryan Corbett and William McKenty, as part of a prisoner exchange arranged by the Biden administration. The U.S. agreed to release Khan Mohammed, a convicted terrorist serving two life sentences, in exchange for the two men.\n\nGlezmann’s release in March 2025 was negotiated separately and did not involve a prisoner exchange.\n\nLoved to travel\n\nPersonal Life:\n\nAccording to the Foley Foundation, Glezmann, 65, was traveling lawfully in Afghanistan and \"fulfilling his lifelong passion\" of visiting different countries and exploring various cultures and cultural artifacts. Glezmann, who obtained a Bachelor of Science degree in Anthropology in 2017, had visited more than 100 countries before he was taken hostage.\n\nGlezmann has only had limited contact with his wife, Aleksandra, since he was taken captive. The Foley Foundation says that his health has \"deteriorated significantly\" while he has been in detention and he has medical issues that require immediate care.\n\nGeorge Glezmann. Photo courtesy of Foley Foundation and the Glezmann family.\n\nHis wife, Aleksandra Glezmann, released the following statement upon learning of George's release:\n\n\"I can’t wait to see George and help him on his road to recovery as we rebuild our lives. We are forever grateful to President Trump for bringing George home. Since the first day of the Trump administration his team has focused on securing George’s safe release. The skill and dedication demonstrated by Secretary Rubio, Mr. Waltz, and Mr. Boehler has been refreshing. It is clear to us that their dedication to the American people is unwavering.\"\n\nThe family's attorney, Dennis Fitzpatrick, also released a statement:\n\n\"George’s team is grateful that he is finally coming home after 836 days in Taliban custody. President Trump has assembled first-class diplomatic and national security teams. Special Presidential Envoy Adam Boehler worked tirelessly since day one of the Trump administration to bring George home and his hard work has paid off. Secretary Rubio and National Security Advisor Mike Waltz understand how to operate on the world stage in order to advance the interests of the American people. George’s release was achieved based on the unique skill and dedication of these people.\"\n\nPositive step\n\nWhat they're saying:\n\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio called the release a \"positive and constructive step\", while emphasizing that more Americans remain detained in Afghanistan. He stated, \"George’s release is a positive and constructive step. It is also a reminder that other Americans are still detained in Afghanistan. President Trump will continue his tireless work to free ALL Americans unjustly detained around the world.\"\n\nThe Taliban has described the release as part of a \"normalization\" of ties with the U.S., though Washington has not formally recognized Taliban rule. Despite this, Qatar has remained an essential diplomatic bridge, facilitating negotiations between the U.S. and Taliban leadership.\n\nFate of Mahmood Habibi still unknown\n\nWhat we don't know:\n\nMahmood Habibi's fate remains unknown. The U.S. maintains that the Taliban is holding him, but Taliban officials deny any involvement. His case remains an ongoing point of contention in U.S.-Taliban relations.\n\nHeaded home\n\nWhat's next:\n\nGlezmann is expected to arrive back in the U.S. in the coming days and will reunite with his wife, Aleksandra. The State Department continues to negotiate for the release of other detained Americans.\n\nReaction :\n\nDelta Air Lines sent the following to FOX 5 Atlanta:\n\n\"We are grateful for Mr. Glezmann's return home and look forward to reconnecting with him.\"\n\nSeveral Georgia lawmakers have worked for Glezmann's release over the last two years, making phone calls, meeting with family, speaking to former President Biden and asking the Trump Administration to step in.\n\nU.S. Sen. Reverend Raphael Warnock sent the following statement:\n\n\"I’m beyond thrilled that George Glezmann is returning home to Georgia. My best wishes go out to George and his wife Aleksandra, who I’ve gotten to know well over the past two trying and difficult years. With Senator Ossoff, I’ve proudly pushed Presidents of both parties to do everything in their power to bring George home, and today we can finally celebrate that moment. Welcome home, George.\"\n\nCongresswoman Nikema Williams made the following statement:\n\nSince last summer, we've been working to get George home. After a Congressional resolution and a letter expressing the urgency of his safe return, I am grateful for his release and elated to know George will be reunited with his wife, Aleksandra, and his family. Welcome home, George!\n\nThe Foley Foundation, which has worked to free Glezmann and other hostages, released this statement:\n\nFoley Foundation President and Founder Diane Foley said today, \"We congratulate the Trump administration for securing the release of George Glezmann, wrongfully detained in Afghanistan by the Taliban for over two years. This administration has returned over a dozen Americans held captive abroad in the last 60 days. We are grateful to the government of Qatar for their skilled diplomacy in facilitating this release.\"",

        "title": "Dr. Oz pledges in confirmation hearing to continue Medicare drug price talks started by Biden",
        "source": "https://www.cbsnews.com/philadelphia/",
        "content": "Former heart surgeon and television host Dr. Mehmet Oz testified Friday before the Senate Finance Committee over his nomination to head the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services under President Trump.\n\nThe GOP-led committee will next schedule a vote on whether to send Oz's nomination to the full Senate, where he is likely to be approved given the Republican majority.\n\nIf confirmed, Oz would be the administrator charged with overseeing the nearly $1.5 trillion spent by the federal government on Medicare and Medicaid. The two health insurance programs for seniors and poor Americans make up more than a third of the budget.\n\nMedicare covers around 65 million people, through programs run directly by the federal government or contracted out to private insurers. Medicaid supports around 85 million, through programs administered primarily by state governments overseen by CMS.\n\nCMS also sets rules that affect private health insurance, including overseeing the Affordable Care Act's health insurance marketplaces.\n\nOz previously worked as a professor of cardiac surgery at Columbia University and host of \"The Dr. Oz Show\" until 2022, when he stopped taping new television episodes to run for a Senate seat in Pennsylvania. He lost that Senate race to Democrat John Fetterman, in a narrow contest where abortion had ranked as a top issue for voters.\n\nOz's priorities for Medicare and Medicaid\n\nOz outlined a vision for the agency focused in large part on modernizing its systems and tools, addressing waste and fraud and incentivizing Americans to make healthier lifestyle choices.\n\n\"Some of these decisions are not difficult. Some of them need to be simplified. And some of them need to be reminded frequently,\" Oz told senators of the healthier lifestyle choices he wants to encourage, adding later that \"the idea of giving incentives to patients is an idea that I think is a worthy one, especially for Medicaid beneficiaries.\"\n\nIt will be up to Oz to finalize or abandon some major changes to Medicare and Medicaid sought by the Biden administration, like a pricey proposal in November to expand coverage to drugs used for weight loss like Wegovy and Ozempic.\n\nOz did not directly address the proposal during the hearing. But he did promise to continue the Medicare drug price negotiation program launched by the Biden administration, from the Inflation Reduction Act.\n\n\"It's the law. I'm going to defend it and use it,\" Oz told senators.\n\nHe also voiced support for allowing states to add work requirements in Medicaid. Oz also said he wants work requirements to be defined broadly, to include activities like going to school or volunteering at a church.\n\n\"I don't think you need to use paperwork to prove a work requirement. And I don't think that should be used as an obstacle, a disingenuous effort to block people from getting on Medicaid,\" he said.\n\nOz criticizes Medicare Advantage\n\nDuring Friday's hearing, Oz singled out Medicare Advantage as one of the biggest sources of waste and abuse within the insurance industry.\n\nJust over half of seniors have opted for these plans offered by private insurers but paid for by taxpayers, according to the latest federal data, instead of \"original Medicare\" coverage.\n\nHe cited reports showing spending on the private alternatives outpacing traditional Medicare coverage as \"upside down\" what it should be, questioning spending by plans and efforts by brokers to persuade seniors to sign up.\n\nHe also criticized the practice of \"upcoding\" within Medicare Advantage, where providers or plans bill for treating patients as sicker than they actually are.\n\n\"A part of this is just recognizing there's a new sheriff in town. We actually have to go after places and areas where we're not managing the American people's money well,\" Oz said.\n\nOz calls for limiting prior authorization\n\nOz also faced questions over the significant authority he would wield over private health insurance.\n\nOn Monday, CMS proposed making several moves to reverse Biden administration expansions to the insurance marketplace created by the Affordable Care Act, like shortening the open enrollment period and excluding DACA recipients from coverage. In 2022, Oz said that the law \"caused havoc on our health care system\" and that he \"wouldn't have voted for it.\"\n\nDuring the hearing, Oz criticized health insurance companies misusing prior authorization - sometimes delaying treatment until doctors and patients can persuade insurers that it is necessary - as \"a pox on the system.\"\n\n\"We're spending money, wasting money, trying to do a process that should be automated. I would argue we could limit the number of preauthorized procedures to a thousand,\" he told senators.\n\nRepublicans optimistic Oz will be confirmed\n\nIn social media posts last month, Oz has touted \"great conversations\" with key Republicans he would need to win over for his nomination. Multiple Republicans at Friday's hearing said they were optimistic Oz would be confirmed.\n\nSen. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, the Republican chair of the Senate's health committee, was among those to sit down with Oz last month. Cassidy is one of four medical doctors in the Senate.\n\n\"Great meeting with Dr. Mehmet Oz, President Trump's nominee to lead the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. It will be great to have a doctor in charge,\" Cassidy posted on Feb. 5.\n\nOz was the fourth of Trump's health official picks to face questioning from senators. It comes a day after a hearing for Dr. David Weldon was abruptly canceled, after the White House withdrew his nomination to head the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nA majority of senators on the Senate's health committee advanced Dr. Jay Bhattacharya, the president's nominee to head the National Institutes of Health, and Dr. Marty Makary, the pick to head the Food and Drug Administration, on Thursday.\n\nOz's potential new supervisor, Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr., was narrowly confirmed by the Senate a month ago.\n\nDemocrats criticized Oz's past\n\nSen. Ron Wyden of Oregon, the top Democrat on committee, during the hearing accused Oz of \"dodging Medicare and Social Security taxes.\" Wyden said a tax loophole has \"benefited Dr. Oz by $440,000 in the last three years.\"\n\nDuring the hearing, Oz did not respond to the allegation. A memo from the committee's Democratic staff had concluded that Oz may have underpaid his taxes based on a questionairre he submitted, his tax returns and financial disclosures.\n\n\"Now, the doctor will testify about his concern for Medicare's well being, yet he is unwilling to pay the same taxes that millions of Americans pay out of every paycheck,\" Wyden said.\n\nThe president's pick to head CMS has earned criticism from some Senate Democrats for months, who have cited Oz's past embrace of \"alarming pseudoscience,\" record of anti-abortion statements and worries over conflicts of interest.\n\nAs part of an ethics agreement published last month, Oz said he will resign from positions at several companies, including the nutritional supplement company iHerb and the drugmaker Housey Pharma. He also pledged to divest from several healthcare companies, including insurance giant UnitedHealth Group.\n\nAfter the Senate race, Oz had been advertised as iHerb's global advisor. He continued to promote iHerb's supplements on social media after his nomination.\n\nHe has also continued to republish past excerpts from his show in recent years after the Senate race, like a clip he shared on Sept. 4 from a sponsored interview about Medicare Advantage coverage. In 2020, Oz would later propose that Medicare Advantage should be expanded to all Americans.\n\nIn the clip, Oz said that enrollment in Medicare Advantage had grown 70% since he started his show.\n\n\"I want to nudge you. I don't want to shove you. But think about this, because a 70% increase since I started the show means a lot to me,\" he said.\n\nand contributed to this report.",

Chants of \"Ovi! Ovi!\" filled the arena as the goal counter in one corner flipped from 887 to 888.\n\nBrandon Duhaime and Andrew Mangiapane also scored and Charlie Lindgren made 27 saves for the Capitals, who awaited other results from around the league to see if they become the first team to wrap up a playoff spot this season.

Ryan Poehling and Sean Couturier scored, and Ersson allowed three goals on 16 shots.\n\nTakeaways\n\nFlyers: Late in a lost season, word that defenseman Rasmus Ristolainen is considered week to week with an upper-body injury only matters if that somehow affects their chances of trading him this summer.\n\nCapitals: With a comfortable cushion atop the Eastern Conference, getting Ovechkin the record over the next 13 games is a priority.\n\nKey moment\n\nThe puck bounced off Aliaksei Protas in front, and he quickly passed the puck to Ovechkin for his 35th goal of the season.\n\nKey stat\n\nThe Capitals could become the first team since 16 teams qualified beginning in 1979-80 to clinch a playoff spot after being the last to do it the previous season.\n\nUp next\n\nThe Flyers visit Dallas on Saturday, while the Capitals host defending Stanley Cup champion Florida a few hours later.",

An estimated 200,000 travelers could be affected.\n\nThe airport said the fire at an electrical substation supplying the airport had caused a \"significant power outage.\"\n\n\"To maintain the safety of our passengers and colleagues, Heathrow will be closed until (11:59 p.m. Friday local time),\" a post on the airport's X account said. \"Passengers are advised not to travel to the airport.\"\n\nLondon's Metropolitan Police said there was \"currently no indication of foul play,\" but that counterterrorism police would be leading the investigation into the blaze.\n\n\"Given the location of the substation and the impact this incident has had on critical national infrastructure, the Met's Counter Terrorism Command is now leading enquiries. This is due to the specialist resources and capabilities within that command that can assist in progressing this investigation at pace to minimize disruption and identify the cause,\" the police said in a statement.\n\nTracking services showed flights being diverted to London's Gatwick Airport, Charles de Gaulle Airport in Paris and Ireland's Shannon Airport. British Airways, whose main hub is Heathrow, said the closure would have a significant impact on its operations and customers, adding that it was working as quickly as possible to update travelers on their options for the \"next 24 hours and beyond.\"\n\nFire, which wiped out power and closed Heathrow Airport, rises at the North Hyde Electricity Substation in Hayes, Britain in this handout picture released on March 21, 2025. London Fire Brigade via REUTERS\n\nThe FlightRadar24 live tracking website showed at least 1,350 flights into and out of Heathrow were affected. According to the online service, the top route to and from Heathrow is the connection with New York's JFK International Airport, with 146 flights every week.\n\n\"I saw the time on the screen started to increase,\" passenger Tori Dunzello, who had been on a flight to the U.K. to attend her father's funeral, told CBS News partner network BBC News. \"I turned on my world map, and I started seeing a big U-turn, and I turned around and said to my husband: 'I think we're turning around.'\"\n\nDunzello said her flight was diverted to Canada, and she expected it to refuel and return to New York.\n\nThe impact of the Heathrow power outage was likely to last several days, leaving thousands passengers forced to find alternate travel plans.\n\n\"We're talking about several days' worth of disruption to get the planes recovered and start using them again to move planned and disrupted passengers,\" Aviation consultant John Strickland told The Associated Press, comparing the outage to \"a contained version of 9/11 or, to an extent, the Icelandic volcanic eruption\" in 2010 that shutdown European airspace.\n\n\"Heathrow being such a busy airport and full, there's no kind of wriggle room for getting out of these kind of things,\" Strickland told the AP.\n\nBritain's National Rail service canceled services to and from Heathrow for the day, though some passengers could still be seen attempting to enter the airport on foot on Friday. They were turned away by police.\n\nFirefighters douse the remainder of a fire that broke out at a substation supplying power to Heathrow Airport in Hayes, west London on March 21, 2025. BENJAMIN CREMEL/AFP via Getty Images\n\nThe London Fire Brigade said 10 fire engines and around 70 firefighters were sent to tackle the blaze at a substation near the airport in the west London town of Hayes. It started late Thursday night, and by about 8 a.m. local time, the brigade said it was \"under control, but we will remain on scene throughout the day.\"\n\nThe fire was \"producing a significant amount of smoke. Please keep your windows and doors closed and avoid the area where possible,\" the brigade urged people in the area.\n\nThe power outage affected \"a large number of homes and local businesses, and we are working closely with our partners to minimise disruption,\" Assistant Commissioner Pat Goulbourne said in a statement, adding that firefighters had led 29 people to safety from nearby properties, and around 150 people were evacuated.\n\nScottish and Southern Electricity Networks said in a post on X that the power outage affected more than 16,300 homes.\n\nAuthorities said it wasn't clear what had sparked the blaze at the substation, but U.K. Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change Ed Miliband told LBC Radio there was no immediate suggestion of foul play. Local residents reported hearing explosions.\n\n\"I was about 100 yards from the explosion,\" local resident Vaneca Sinclair told the BBC. She said she had been getting ready for bed in her home at about 11:30 p.m. Thursday evening (7:30 p.m. Eastern) when \"suddenly there was this huge bang and the house just shook.\"\n\n\"When the first explosion went off... I literally just ran out of the house,\" another local resident, Savita Kapur, told the BBC. She said she got her elderly mother in her car to drive her to her sister's house.\n\n\"When I was driving up my road the second explosion went off and the whole ground shook,\" Kapur said.\n\n\"There's obviously been a catastrophic fire at this substation,\" Miliband told the BBC, and \"it appears to have knocked out a back-up generator as well as a substation itself.\"\n\n\"We will have to look hard at the causes, and also the protection and the resilience that is in place for major, major institutions like Heathrow,\" he said.\n\nU.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer said in a statement Friday that he \"know(s) the situation in Heathrow is causing distress and disruption, especially for those traveling or without power in their homes. I'm receiving regular updates and I'm in close contact with partners on the ground,\" Starmer said. \"Thanks to our emergency workers for keeping people safe.\"\n\nThe latest numbers from travel data provider OAG Aviation show Heathrow is the fifth busiest airport in the world. Earlier this year, it reported its busiest January on record, serving over 6.3 million passengers and averaging over 200,000 passengers a day. More than 1.2 million of those passengers travelled between the U.K. and the U.S.\n\ncontributed to this report.",

He shot 5 of 12 from the field and also grabbed three rebounds.\n\nLast year's NCAA Tournament didn't go as planned for Wagner.\n\nIn the 2024 NCAA Tournament, Wagner was a freshman on a No. 3 seed Kentucky team that was upset by No. 14 seed Oakland, 80-76.

He was also the Gatorade New Jersey Player of the Year for three straight seasons, a member of the USA Men's Nike Hoop Summit team and more.\n\nWagner is currently following the footsteps of his father and grandfather.

A judge granted the preliminary injunction Thursday morning.\n\nSources say this move could jeopardize a long-term deal to keep the health system operating.\n\nAn attorney who filed the suit tells CBS News Philadelphia the foundation at a private meeting was \"coerced\" into handing over $7 million, which attorneys said funded an additional payroll of hospital staff at Crozer-Chester Medical Center and Taylor Hospital.\n\nThe bankruptcy court judge has now ordered lawyers to a face-to-face meeting this weekend in Harrisburg to fix the mess.\n\nPennsylvania Attorney General Dave Sunday said in an email to CBS News Philadelphia:\n\n\"I am grateful the bankruptcy court recognizes the urgency of this matter and has ordered all parties back to the table to solidify a path forward.

Doctor shares tips to deal with them\n\nSpring pollen, allergies got you down? Doctor shares tips to deal with them\n\nWhile the first day of spring brings joy and beautiful plants in bloom, it can also signal a moment of dread for allergy sufferers.\n\nPeople susceptible to allergens like pollen, ragweed and grasses know that spring's arrival could mean coughing, sneezing and general misery are right around the corner. You might already have a layer of pollen on your car, or you will soon.\n\nIn case you need help getting through this season, Dr. Rob Danoff from Jefferson Health joined CBS News Philadelphia to share some tips on how to deal with seasonal allergies.\n\nYou can watch the full interview above or keep scrolling for some highlights.\n\nHow to tell if it's allergies or a cold or sinus infection\n\nThere are differences in symptoms between allergies and the common cold, Danoff said.\n\nAllergy sufferers might have a stuffy head, \"almost like a brain fog,\" said Danoff. Other symptoms could include itchy eyes and a scratchy throat.\n\nIf you have asthma, you may have flares of coughing and wheezing.\n\n\"And your throat can be really sore from this drip down the back of your throat, and you get this unusual fatigue,\" Danoff added.\n\nMore telltale signs of a cold are muscle aches or fever — you don't get a fever with allergies and normally wouldn't get muscle aches.\n\nHow to deal with spring allergies\n\nTo alleviate the side effects of spring allergies, Danoff says try to decrease your exposure to tree pollen as much as possible.\n\nYou should keep an eye on local weather reports and monitor when the pollen count is high in the Philadelphia area.\n\n\"You want to be careful with that and minimize your time outdoors when the pollen count is high, which tends to be the morning to the middle of the afternoon,\" Danoff said.\n\nAnother tip? Though it's early in the season, you could run your air conditioning. Keeping windows closed at night will stop allergens from blowing into your home.\n\nBest air purifier for allergies and asthma\n\nMany air purifier models will likely help if you want to clarify the air in your home and remove pollen from it.\n\nThe best air purifier to remove pollen and alleviate your allergies and asthma should have a HEPA filter, Danoff said. You might have heard this abbreviation during the COVID-19 pandemic — HEPA stands for High Efficiency Particulate Air (filter). It refers to the filter's ability to, in theory, remove at least 99.97% of dust, pollen, mold, bacteria and other particles that are 0.3 microns wide.\n\nIf you want to look into air purifiers to help your allergies, make sure you search for one with a HEPA filter. You should also consider the size of the room the purifier will be in and make sure it is rated for the right amount of square or cubic footage.\n\nThe product description will tell you the room size your purifier is ideal for.\n\n\"Especially if you have carpets or curtains [an air purifier] will filter out the pollen,\" Danoff said.\n\nProtecting yourself from pollen\n\nWhen you go outside, Danoff suggests wearing sunglasses. This will keep your eyes protected from pollen.\n\nAnother tip: when you get home, take your clothes off in a set area away from your bed or living space - wash your clothes and/or go take a shower to get the pollen out of your hair and clothes, he said.\n\nAnd if you typically reach for hair products in the morning, Danoff says skipping the sprays could help you protect people around you who have serious allergies.\n\n\"Many people use hairspray or hair gel, that actually attracts pollen,\" he said. \"You're going to be your own pollen tree and you're going to then spread it to other people. So even if you don't have symptoms, other people may and might just be around you.\"",

It will be the home of ChristianaCare's first micro-hospital in Delaware County, Pennsylvania.\n\nAston Township manager Bill DeFeo estimates the project will cost between $11 million and $15 million.\n\n\"We think it's a win-win situation, not only for Christiana but also for Aston Township,\" DeFeo said.\n\nChristianaCare said there will be 10 inpatient beds and 10 beds in the emergency department. While it won't offer the full services of a traditional hospital, officials say it will offer primary care, dietary, bariatric and other services.\n\n\"ChristianaCare is actively exploring site locations for our second neighborhood hospital in Delaware County, Pennsylvania,\" ChristianaCare Spokesperson William Schmitt said. \"Springfield is among the locations we are considering.\"\n\nSpringfield Township Solicitor Jim Byrne said the plans have drawn opposition from some residents.\n\n\"We had the planning commission hearing which was well attended,'\" Byrne said. \"There are people on both sides of the issue. Some people like the idea of the hospital, some people hate it.\"\n\nSome people in Springfield Township are worried the project is being built too close to homes and could create ambulance noise. Others complained that a micro-hospital could worsen traffic and stormwater runoff.\n\nThis comes at a time when Crozer Chester Medical Center in Chester and Taylor Hospital in Ridley Park are at risk of shutting down because of financial problems.\n\nKaren Keyser, who grew up and lives in Aston, said she is on board with ChristianaCare's project.\n\n\"I think it's a great idea,\" Keyser said. \"We need something here. If Crozer and Taylor are going to close in the future, we need something close, especially an emergency department.\"\n\nBut DeFeo said if Crozer's health system shuts down, the micro-hospital in Aston won't be able to fill the gap.\n\n\"The new micro-hospital that Christiana's is going to provide is going to be a 20-bed hospital, as compared to maybe 180-bed hospital, similar to what Riddle Hospital does and what Crozer Hospital does,\" DeFeo said.\n\nConstruction of the Aston medical campus is expected to be completed in 18 months to two years.",

        "content": "Five bridges in the Philadelphia area are set to be evaluated for collapse risk a year after a ship struck the Francis Scott Key Bridge in Baltimore, causing it to fall into Maryland's Patapsco River.\n\nThe NTSB wants 68 bridges across 19 states to get a \"vulnerability assessment\" to determine their risk of collapse if they were to be involved in a vessel collision. CBS News has published the whole list, which includes the Golden Gate Bridge in California and New York's Brooklyn Bridge.\n\nIt's important to note, being on the list doesn't mean the bridge is bound to collapse. Owners just need to evaluate whether the bridge meets the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials' acceptable level of risk.\n\nWhich Philadelphia-area bridges are on the list?\n\nThese are the five Philadelphia-area bridges that NTSB says will need an assessment:\n\nBenjamin Franklin Bridge, built in 1926\n\nDelaware River Turnpike Bridge, built in 1956\n\nWalt Whitman Bridge, built in 1957\n\nCommodore Barry Bridge, built in 1974\n\nBetsy Ross Bridge, built in 1976\n\nBridge owners have been tasked with evaluating whether the structures are above the acceptable level of risk.\n\nThe Delaware River Port Authority controls four of the local bridges. The New Jersey Turnpike Authority controls the Delaware River Turnpike Bridge, which connects the Pennsylvania and New Jersey turnpikes.\n\nThree of the five bridges were listed as \"critical/essential\" in the report.\n\nWe've reached out to the DRPA and New Jersey Turnpike Commission for comment and are waiting to hear back.\n\nWhat protective measures are in place on the bridges over the Delaware River?\n\nIn the wake of the Key Bridge collapse, CBS News Philadelphia's Joe Holden spoke to the DRPA about protective measures in place on local bridges.\n\nDRPA officials said about two decades ago, officials realized the Commodore Barry Bridge needed a major safety upgrade — today, rock islands surround the supports of the bridge and would cause a vessel to run aground before striking the supports.\n\nThere are similar protections at the Betsy Ross Bridge.\n\nMeanwhile, the Benjamin Franklin and Walt Whitman bridges have supports well out of the way of the main shipping channel that vessels travel through.\n\n\"There are structural steel towers that suspension cables are attached to that sit on a foundation and the water that they're is protected by a timber protection system, but it is too shallow for a ship to get into those areas,\" Delaware River Port Authority CEO John Hanson said at the time.",

The school's wrestling team just nabbed its first state championship ever, and the new title-holder is just a freshman, setting the student-athlete and school up for more titles in years to come.\n\n\"This is the Garnet Valley wrestling room,\" Neve O'Byrne explains. \"I'm in this room for one to three hours every day in season.\"\n\nO'Byrne is proof wrestling isn't just for the boys at Garnet Valley High School.\n\n\"Almost every day, I wrestle, and if I'm not wrestling, I'm lifting,\" she says. \"If I can't lift, I'm running.\"\n\nThat hustle has paid off. At just 15 years old, and during the inaugural season for girls wrestling at the high school, O'Byrne is making a statement.\n\n\"She comes in, goes right at girls, and kicks butt,\" Head Wrestling Coach Chris Tate says.\n\nO'Byrne did exactly that this season, winning the PIAA Girls Wrestling State Championship at 124 pounds. It's the first wrestling state title for Garnet Valley and the first girls wrestling state title for Delaware County.\n\n\"Neve's a beast,\" her coach says. \"You know, we call her the Hellcat.\"\n\nO'Byrne's teammates say it's easy to see why.\n\n\"I remember one of the first matches I saw her wrestle, she made a girl bleed from her nose so hard that they had to wrap her face just so it stopped bleeding, and it was one of my first impressions of her wrestling,\" teammate Amanda Mendoza says.\n\nBut O'Byrne didn't start her season on top of the podium. Hers is a story of perseverance.\n\n\"During practice, if you ever look at her, she never stops,\" teammate Peyton Duffy says.\n\n\"As the season went, she started placing at tournaments,\" Coach Tate adds. \"Then she started winning tournaments, and once she won her first tournament, she didn't lose one again for the rest of the year.\"\n\nIt's been a lifetime coming. O'Byrne started wrestling at just 6 years old.\n\nLike many younger siblings, she followed in her older brother's footsteps by watching him compete at meets on weekends.\n\n\"I was always there, I was supporting him, and I was like, why don't I give it a try?\" O'Byrne said.\n\nNow the wrestling community has become her second family, and the sport has given her the confidence to navigate life.\n\n\"I'll just come on the mat and show them,\" O'Byrne said. \"I might not have the best speech or the best reading, but on the mat, none of that matters, and I'm the Hellcat, and I can show you that I'm strong.\"\n\nCompetitors are on notice. O'Byrne's championship banner will soon hang in the wrestling room at Garnet Valley, and she intends to add more titles.\n\nThe young wrestler always says her most important match is her next match.\n\nThe day after she won the state title, O'Byrne was back in the gym wrestling.\n\nShe's now getting ready for the U.S. World Team trials. And, of course, she wants another state championship next year. In fact, O'Byrne is working toward a four-peat.",

Their partner then fired at the shooter, who was struck multiple times.\n\nThe suspect was taken to Jefferson Einstein Hospital, where he was pronounced dead, Bethel said.\n\nThe officers were rushed to Temple University Hospital for treatment, and both have been released, Bethel said.\n\nThe names of the suspect and the officers were not made public Thursday.\n\nWhat led up to deadly encounter Thursday\n\nPolice first encountered the 36-year-old suspect around 12:30 p.m. near Torresdale Avenue and Wakeling Street, where he was \"running through the traffic,\" Bethel said. The suspect was having a mental health crisis and agreed to a voluntary commitment, so officers put him into a van, according to Bethel. The man was not handcuffed because it was a voluntary commitment, he said.\n\nWhen they arrived at Friends Hospital, the suspect got out of the van and attacked the officers. Eventually after \"a significant battle\" between the officers and the suspect, Bethel said, the suspect got an officer's gun. There was an exchange of gunfire and the officer was struck. It's not clear yet how many shots were fired.\n\n\"We are very fortunate, extremely fortunate that the officers were able to survive this encounter,\" Bethel said. The officer who was shot is doing \"extremely well,\" he added.\n\nBethel described the situation as an \"innocent\" one that turned tragic. The investigation is still active, police officials said.\n\n\"But for an inch, we could be here right now with a very different set of circumstances and facts,\" Mayor Cherelle Parker said outside the hospital.\n\n\"I strongly support our Philadelphia police officers who are on the front lines protecting and serving the people of our great city,\" Parker said. \"They deserve our gratitude and respect, and they definitely have that from this mayor.\"\n\nCouncilmember Quetcy Lozada represents the district where Friends Hospital is located and said she is \"closely monitoring\" the situation.\n\n\"I am saddened and concerned for the officer who was wounded today in the line of duty,\" her statement said in part. \"I commend them for their bravery in the midst of this chaotic situation. I am praying for them, their family, friends, and fellow officers. I am incredibly grateful for the bravery of this and every officer in our city and thank them for upholding their commitment to protecting our community.\"\n\nFriends Hospital is located at Adams Avenue and Roosevelt Boulevard in the Crescentville neighborhood.",

        "content": "Doctors are warning about a painful and viral mix-up on social media: People accidentally get glue in their eyes instead of eye drops. While the mishap sounds alarming, doctors say it doesn't cause permanent damage.\n\nA viral TikTok video that has been shared more than 41,000 times has become a cautionary tale. It's one of many that often go viral in hopes of warning people about a dangerous trend.\n\nCBS Philadelphia\n\n\"It can be quite serious depending on the volume of the glue that gets into the eye,\" Dr. Julia Haller, ophthalmologist-in-chief at Wills Eye Hospital, said. \"These glues unfortunately harden in a matter of seconds.\"\n\nHaller says it's a common problem that is treated in the emergency department.\n\n\"What we're seeing is that the lids are stuck together. So we have to very gently break down that adhesion, pry the lids apart and piece by piece very meticulously take out tiny little pieces of that solid adhesion,\" Haller said.\n\nHaller says eye drops are often in bottles similar in size to other products dangerous to the eye.\n\nCBS Philadelphia\n\n\"It can cause a chemical burn in addition to the adhesions. And so in addition to chipping away those adhesions where there's some loss of lash and skin, there can be a chemical burn to the surface of the eye and damage to the cornea,\" Haller said.\n\nThis mistake often happens when people are distracted or unable to see well. They may confuse eye drops with eyelash glue, nail glue, or even ear drops.\n\n\"What we are seeing in the emergency room is unfortunately even parents who mistakenly put the wrong drop in their children's eyes,\" Haller said.\n\nTo avoid this, people are encouraged to read the labels out loud before using them and to store the bottles in different locations.\n\n\"In some way labeling it so that even in a rush, it's easier to identify what drop you're putting in,\" Haller said.\n\nDoctors say that if this happens, people should immediately use water to flush out the glue. They also say to get it out of your eye as fast as possible, check with their doctor, or go to an urgent care center.",

Health officials say the risk to the public remains low.\n\nThis is the third confirmed case of bird flu in the city this year. The first was in a goose found in West Philadelphia, and two — including the newest one confirmed on Friday — have been in live bird markets that are now closed.\n\nBird flu has been spreading from wild birds to commercial chicken and cattle farms.\n\n\"We do have a number of live markets in Philadelphia — and have for many, many years — where people can go in and select a particular bird or type of bird for custom slaughter,\" said Dr. Aliza Simeone, an infectious disease specialist at Penn Vet.\n\nHealth officials say bird flu is mainly spread by live infected animals and the risk with dead birds is much lower.\n\nGayle Mendoza, with the Philadelphia Health Department, says this is the second time bird flu has been detected in a live market.\n\n\"Those markets at that point are shut down,\" Mendoza said. \"The birds are culled or killed to reduce any potential risk of further spread.\"\n\nHealth officials say the risk to the general public is very low.\n\n\"The vast majority of people who've been exposed and have then become sick or tested positive were people with very close contact, either to infected poultry or to infected cattle elsewhere in the country,\" Simeone said.\n\nThere have been about 70 cases nationwide of people infected with bird flu but none in Pennsylvania, New Jersey or Delaware.\n\nFor now, health officials say buying and eating chicken and beef remain safe as long as regular safety precautions such as handwashing and avoiding cross-contamination are followed and items are thoroughly cooked.\n\nThere are also some concerns about raw milk. The FDA is currently recommending that people only consume pasteurized milk because there is limited information about the transmission of bird flu in raw milk.",

        "source": "https://www.cbsnews.com/philadelphia/",
        "content": "Are you getting a big tax refund? It's not always a good thing — here's why | In Your Corner\n\nAre you getting a big tax refund? It's not always a good thing — here's why | In Your Corner\n\nAre you getting a big tax refund? It's not always a good thing — here's why | In Your Corner\n\nThe deadline to file your taxes is now just weeks away on April 15.\n\nTax experts say the sooner you file, the sooner you get that refund, if you have one coming.\n\nThe average refund amount this year is more than $3,300, according to the IRS. But while many look forward to that big chunk of money, some argue a big refund isn't always a good thing.\n\nAfter all, tax refunds aren't free money — it's the taxes you overpaid, so you could view it as money you should've had throughout the year.\n\nCBS News business analyst Jill Schlesinger told CBS Mornings big refunds are often a result of people giving up too much from their paychecks to taxes.\n\nShe advises you should make some changes if you get a large refund.\n\n\"If you get a big refund, one nice thing to do would be, 'Hey, let me change my withholding, let me hold on to my money during the year,'\" she said. \"Keep your money!\"\n\nYou can adjust your withholding by submitting a new Form W-4 to your employer. The IRS recommends using its online withholding estimator tool to determine how much you might owe or be refunded depending on your withholding amount.\n\nThe idea is that withholding less frees up money you can instead invest, save in a high-yield account, or use to pay down debt throughout the year.\n\nBut Jackson-Hewitt Chief Tax Officer Mark Steber warns you could also wind up withholding too little and that can lead to penalties. For that reason, he says most of his clients prefer to bank on getting money back.\n\n\"Most people with big refunds spend them wisely, most people with an extra 50 bucks in their pocket on Friday, they're not putting that in a managed index fund or a Roth IRA,\" he said. \"They're treating themselves to something nice, which is fine, but I see far more people come in at the desk, they get a zero refund, or worse, they owe $1,500. Much more problematic in their life.\"\n\nUltimately it's about finding what works best for you.\n\nHalf of adults surveyed who expected a refund last year said they planned to save some of it, while one-third said they'd use it to pay off debt. The survey was conducted by the National Retail Federation and Prosper Insights & Analytics.\n\nE-filing is the quickest way to get your refund. Despite staff cuts at the IRS, the agency says filing electronically and opting to have your refund directly deposited into your account takes about 21 days on average.\n\nWithin 24 hours of e-filing, you can use IRS.gov to check your refund status with the \"Where's My Refund?\" tool. If you file a paper return it could take up to four weeks.\n\nDo you have a money question, a consumer issue, or a scam story you want to share? Email InYourCorner@cbs.com.",

        "content": "The largely private relationship between Quinta Brunson and her husband of three years is over.\n\nBrunson, a West Philadelphia native and the star and creator of the hit ABC series \"Abbott Elementary,\" filed to divorce Kevin Anik on Wednesday.\n\nHer filing in Los Angeles Superior Court states the pair have an agreement they signed after marriage on how their assets should be divided in a divorce. They have no children together, so the divorce should be relatively straightforward and keep details about the breakup private.\n\nAnik and Brunson dated for several years before marrying in October 2021, though both have been extremely private about their relationship. Brunson thanked Anik when she won an Emmy Award in 2022, which People magazine described as the first public confirmation they were married, and again when she won the Best Comedy Actress Emmy in September.\n\nPeople and other outlets' profiles of Brunson and Anik's relationship have few details about him, mostly noting that the actor called him \"the most supportive man I've ever known\" when she accepted an Emmy for writing \"Abbott Elementary\" in 2022.\n\nThe divorce filing does not list the date the couple separated.\n\nThe filing was first reported Thursday by celebrity website TMZ.",
