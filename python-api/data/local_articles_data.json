It was the first pick-6 by a rookie in a Super Bowl in 39 years. It came against one of the greatest quarterbacks ever. It was a pivotal point in the biggest game. And it was his birthday.\n\nYou couldn't script it any better.\n\n‚ÄúYeah, he had to be dramatic about it,‚Äù Reed Blankenship said with a laugh. ‚ÄúHe had a pick-6 in a Super Bowl for his birthday. I mean, who would want it any other way? I‚Äôm proud of him. He works so hard every day. I love seeing him succeed.‚Äù\n\nGet top local stories in Philly delivered to you every morning. Sign up for NBC Philadelphia's News Headlines newsletter.\n\nCooper DeJean turned 22 on Sunday and celebrated with one of the biggest defensive plays in Eagles history.\n\nWith the Eagles already up 10-0 in the middle of the second quarter of Super Bowl LIX at the New Orleans Superdome, the Eagles‚Äô rookie corner stepped in front of a Patrick Mahomes pass and ran 38 yards for a touchdown.\n\nIt was only the second pick-6 by a rookie in Super Bowl history, the first since 1985, and it gave the Eagles a 17-0 lead on the way to a 34-0 late 3rd-quarter lead and eventually a 40-22 win over the Chiefs and a second Super Bowl championship in eight years.\n\n‚ÄúIt‚Äôs crazy,‚Äù said DeJean, the Eagles‚Äô 2nd-round pick out of Iowa. ‚ÄúTo be able to do it with this group of guys. I came in and since day one, all of us rookies, they brought us in, taught us everything they know. Now, to be here on the biggest stage and be able to hold that Lombardi Trophy and do it on my birthday and Saquon‚Äôs birthday ‚Äì it‚Äôs pretty crazy.‚Äù\n\nThe Eagles had the No. 1 defense and No. 1 pass defense in the NFL during the regular season, but all three had at least one in the postseason.\n\nDeJean‚Äôs INT was the highlight of a monster defensive performance that saw the Eagles hold the Chiefs to 55 yards and no points on their first nine possessions.\n\nBy then, it was 34-0 and even a few garbage-time touchdowns didn‚Äôt make the final score close.\n\n‚ÄúWe just played our defense, like we have all year,‚Äù DeJean said. ‚ÄúWhat we‚Äôve done all year: Working together as a group. The biggest thing is try to contain the quarterback and I think our d-line did a great job of that all night, group rushing, keeping him in the pocket, not allowing him to create explosive plays when he gets outside the pocket.‚Äù\n\nThe Eagles became the first Super Bowl team to record six sacks and three takeaways while holding an opponent to fewer than 300 yards since the 1989 49ers against the Broncos. The Eagles hadn‚Äôt even done that in a regular-season game since a 2019 win over Luke Falk and the Jets.\n\nThirty-two years ago, Eric Allen had a pick-6 off Bobby Hebert in the fourth quarter of a playoff win over the Saints, and DeJean ran into the same right corner of the end zone at the Superdome that Allen ran into that night. And Allen was at the game Sunday, three days after being named a Hall of Famer.\n\n‚ÄúI was trying to find the fastest way to the end zone,‚Äù said DeJean, who twisted through a lot of traffic the last 10 yards of his return. ‚ÄúLuckily, I got some blocks out there. I had to avoid some of those big guys, but it was just our defense working together like we have all year. It fell right into my lap.\n\n\n\n‚ÄúI never thought that would happen. And it did happen. It‚Äôs pretty cool. I‚Äôm just happy we won the game and for all these guys who have been here, bringing us rookies in.‚Äù\n\nDeJean is the ninth rookie with a Super Bowl interception and the first to turn it into a touchdown since cornerback Reggie Phillips against Steve Grogan in the Bears‚Äô 46-10 win over the Patriots in Super Bowl XX, also in New Orleans.\n\nIt was only the fifth pick-6 the three-time Super Bowl MVP has thrown in 132 career games and his first in 21 career postseason games.\n\n‚ÄúThe kid made a great play,‚Äù Mahomes said. ‚ÄúHe sat underneath (Xavier) Worthy, and I tried to reset back and throw it across the field to D-Hop (DeAndre Hopkins) and put it in a tight window, and he made a great play on it and then returned it for a touchdown.‚Äù\n\nMitchell, the Eagles‚Äô rookie 1st-round pick, didn‚Äôt have an interception during the regular season but picked off Jordan Love in the wild-card round win over the Packers and got Jayden Daniels in the NFC Championship Game win over the Commanders.\n\nThe Eagles became only the 12th team in NFL history to get interceptions from two rookies in the same postseason. Before this year, the Eagles‚Äô last rookie with a postseason interception was Roynell Young in 1980.\n\n‚ÄúMan, he got his first one of the year in the biggest moment,‚Äù Mitchell said. ‚ÄúThat was a huge momentum swing, man. I was happy. I was trying to get to him. Everybody was getting to him. Coop changed the game today.‚Äù\n\nThe Eagles fans at the Superdome reacted with that ‚ÄúCoop‚Äù chant that‚Äôs become common at the Linc. This time, the whole world heard it.\n\n‚ÄúIt‚Äôs awesome,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúTo hear that chant, to be able to score a touchdown is pretty cool. I‚Äôm just happy to be here and be a part of this organization. We‚Äôve got a great fanbase, and they support us all the way through the ups and downs.\n\n‚ÄúI‚Äôve been dreaming of this since I was a kid, watching this game growing up. Now it‚Äôs here and now I get to wear a big old ring on my finger whenever we get it, hold that trophy.

Sign up for NBC Philadelphia's News Headlines newsletter.\n\nUntil now, researchers have focused on children with such severe allergies that the tiniest bit of peanut could set off a dangerous reaction, said the study‚Äôs lead author, Dr. Scott Sicherer, professor of pediatrics and director of the Elliot and Roslyn Jaffe Food Allergy Institute at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City.\n\n‚ÄúWe thought if we could target children who could consume at least half a peanut with a therapy that was much easier to use, we might be able to get them to the point where they could treat peanuts like regular food,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe were surprised at how successful we were.‚Äù\n\nSicherer urged parents not to try the therapy on their own, adding ‚Äúyou should talk to an allergist about the process.‚Äù\n\nA total of 73 children, ages 4 to 14, were originally entered in the trial, which was sponsored and funded by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. Of the 73, 38 were randomly assigned to get immunotherapy, with the other 35 to continue avoiding peanut protein.\n\nChildren who could eat the equivalent of half a peanut without experiencing reactions were able to participate in the study. Those who could eat the equivalent of 20 or more peanuts were excluded.\n\nBy the end of the trial, six of the children in the immunotherapy group and five in the control group had dropped out, which left 32 in the immunotherapy group and 30 in the group that continued to avoid peanuts.\n\nIn the treatment group, children were started on a ‚Öõ teaspoon of peanut butter, which gradually was increased every eight weeks. Once the children reached ¬Ω a teaspoon of peanut butter, they were allowed to substitute other foods containing an equivalent amount of peanut protein, such as candies, for the peanut butter.\n\nThe peanut protein increases occurred only when children were under the care of an allergist, in case they had a reaction.\n\nOnce children were able to eat a tablespoon of peanut butter each day, they were told they did not need to consume it every day, but should consume two tablespoons per week.\n\nNone of the children in the immunotherapy group had a severe enough reaction when consuming peanut protein at home to need a shot of epinephrine and just one needed the medication during a visit to the study site.\n\nThe next part of the study was designed to determine whether the peanut tolerance gained by the 32 children would be lasting. Thirty children chose to continue with the study at that point.\n\nThey were asked to abstain from eating peanut protein for eight weeks. Then they were tested to see if they could still tolerate the equivalent of three tablespoons of peanut butter. Out of the 30 children, 26 passed the test and that led the researchers to conclude the immunotherapy had allowed these children to overcome their allergy to peanut protein.\n\n‚ÄúThis is a pretty easy process to follow and it was very successful,‚Äù Sicherer said. ‚ÄúIt has the potential to be a game changer for the families and the children.‚Äù\n\nWhile it will be necessary to follow children for a longer term to validate the results, ‚Äúthe ability to induce tolerance to a food is incredibly exciting,‚Äù said Dr. Joel Brooks, an assistant professor of pediatrics and an associate program director of allergy and immunology at the Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons in New York City.\n\n‚ÄúNow these children won‚Äôt have to carry an EpiPen with them,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThey won‚Äôt have to avoid foods with peanuts. They are allergy free for life.‚Äù\n\nOften when children develop a peanut allergy, it has a profound impact on the family, Brooks said.\n\n‚ÄúThe children stop going to birthday parties and a lot of them stop going out to eat with their families. Fear keeps them from summer camp and going away to visit friends for the holidays,\" he said. ‚ÄúIf you can take away the risk, it would make a world of difference to the children and their families.‚Äù\n\nBrooks was also happy to see that the researchers published their protocol.\n\n‚ÄúOnce there is a standardized protocol, more practices can utilize it to help their patients,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt may not be every patient‚Äôs choice, but it‚Äôs another tool in our tool boxes.‚Äù\n\nHe reiterated the advice to parents not to try to do the immunotherapy protocol on their own.\n\n‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a risk any time we do a food challenge that there could be a severe life-threatening reaction,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúSo this should be done only under the supervision of an allergist.‚Äù\n\nThis story originally appeared on NBCNews.com.

        "fullContent": "This year's Super Bowl commercials went for easy laughs and nostalgia, largely steering clear of controversy and leaving the surprises on the football field, where the Philadelphia Eagles dominated the Kansas City Chiefs.\n\nEugene Levy‚Äôs eyebrows flew off and buzzed around after he ate some Little Caesars. Four old ladies went on a joy ride in a commercial for WeatherTech, while sloths had a case of the Mondays in an ad for Coors Light. And British singer Seal became an actual seal, sad that he couldn't hold Mountain Dew with his flippers.\n\nActor Glenn Powell did a take on Goldilocks for Ram Trucks, while comedian Nate Bargatze cloned himself and hired an opera singer because he saved so much money using DoorDash. Shaboozey took a lighthearted stroll through New Orleans for Nerds, while the stars of the ‚ÄúFast and Furious‚Äù franchise took a slow cruise in a convertible so they could enjoy H√§agen-Dazs ice cream bars.\n\nTim Calkins, a professor of marketing at Northwestern University‚Äôs Kellogg School of Management, said this was a complicated Super Bowl for advertisers.\n\nGet top local stories in Philly delivered to you every morning. Sign up for NBC Philadelphia's News Headlines newsletter.\n\nMost ads were in development during last fall's U.S. presidential election race, so avoiding controversy was even more of a priority than usual, Calkins said. The finalized crop of commercials feature a lot of simple humor, nostalgia and few creative risks, he said. But even that approach can backfire.\n\n‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the challenge this year. Everybody wants to be safe, but you also want to be interesting,‚Äù Calkins said. ‚ÄúSafe advertising isn‚Äôt the advertising you notice or remember.‚Äù\n\nAnd advertisers can't afford not to be noticed. Some of the roughly 80 Super Bowl ads spots cost a record $8 million for 30 seconds this year.\n\nHere are some of the themes of this year's Super Bowl ads:\n\nHeartwarming nostalgia\n\nBudweiser brought back its Clydesdales for its Super Bowl ad, including a foal that wants to join the delivery team. Meg Ryan and Billy Crystal reenacted their famous deli scene from 1989's ‚ÄúWhen Harry Met Sally,‚Äù except this time Sally was expressing her enthusiasm for Hellmann's mayonnaise.\n\nHarrison Ford was reflective in an ad for Jeep, talking about freedom and personal choices. ‚ÄúThis Jeep makes me happy, even though my last name is Ford,‚Äù he said.\n\nThe Muppets searched for accommodations with Booking.com, while an Instacart ad featured a parade of familiar mascots like Mr. Clean, the Jolly Green Giant and the Pillsbury Doughboy. Disney asked what the world would be like without the iconic characters it owns, like Elsa from ‚ÄúFrozen,‚Äù Bart Simpson and the Marvel superheroes.\n\nAdvertisers are leaning on nostalgia more than they used to in Super Bowl ads, according to Kimberly Whitler, a marketing professor at the University of Virginia‚Äôs Darden School of Business. Nods to the past can broaden the appeal of an ad to different generations and connect products to positive cultural moments, she said.\n\nCelebrity mash-ups\n\nPutting celebrities together in unexpected combinations can broaden the appeal of a commercial. In their Super Bowl ad for Michelob Ultra, actors Catherine O'Hara and Willem Dafoe are pickleball champs. Soccer star David Beckham and actor Matt Damon are long-lost twins who bond over Stella Artois. Celebrity chef Gordon Ramsay and comedian Pete Davidson teamed up for a HexClad commercial, while Post Malone, Shane Gillis and Peyton Manning had a block party with Bud Light. A slew of celebrities, including Matthew McConaughey, Martha Stewart, Greta Gerwig and Charlie XCX, appeared in an ad for Uber Eats.\n\nLinli Xu, an associate professor of marketing at the University of Minnesota‚Äôs Carlson School of Management, said celebrity endorsements can get people talking. But with dozens of brands using them, there's a risk of diminishing returns.\n\nCelebrities can also get so much attention that viewers don‚Äôt remember which brand they're advertising, Xu said.\n\n‚ÄúThere is a balancing act in terms of having celebrities in the ads,‚Äù she said.\n\nWomen in focus\n\nMultiple ads put a spotlight on women and girls. Pharmaceutical company Novartis promoted early detection for breast cancer, while Lay's had a heart-warming spot featuring a little girl who grows her own potato.\n\nWomen's sports were also a big focus. Nike featured Caitlin Clark, Sha‚ÄôCarri Richardson, Sabrina Ionescu, Jordan Chiles, A‚Äôja Wilson and Sophia Wilson in a commercial talking about how often female athletes face the word, ‚Äúcan't.\" The ad's conclusion: ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt win. So win.\"\n\nThe NFL ran a commercial calling for girls' flag football to become a varsity sport in all 50 states. But Dove also offered a sobering statistic: half of girls who quit sports have been criticized for their body type.\n\n‚ÄúClearly the advertisers are trying to target the female audience, given the rising number of female viewers for the big game and the NFL in general in recent years,‚Äù Xu said.\n\nGross-out humor\n\nCharles Taylor, a marketing professor at Villanova University's School of Business, noticed more gross-out humor than usual.\n\nIn a commercial for Dunkin‚Äô, actor Jeremy Strong emerged from a can of coffee covered in grounds and brown liquid. A man‚Äôs tongue started dancing to celebrate cold foam from Nestl√© Coffee Mate. And in a star-studded ad for Pringles, Chiefs head coach Andy Reid, L.A. Clippers‚Äô James Harden and actor Nick Offerman all watch their iconic mustaches jump off their faces and soar through the sky to help deliver cans of the chips.\n\nTaylor said the ads do get attention, but the yuck-factor could backfire.\n\nSerious moments\n\nIt wasn't all fun and games at the Super Bowl this year. Pharmaceutical company Pfizer promoted its efforts to cure cancer. Hims & Hers, a telehealth company, talked about America's obesity epidemic. The Foundation to Combat Antisemitism, founded by New England Patriots Chairman and CEO Robert Kraft, ran an ad featuring Snoop Dogg and Tom Brady saying what they hate about each other, in an effort to show how pointless hate is.\n\nAn ad from Rocket showed people dreaming of home and aimed to get the Super Bowl crowd to sing along to ‚ÄúTake Me Home, Country Roads.‚Äù Xu said she expected more ads promoting that unifying message, but thought most advertisers went with humor instead.\n\n‚ÄúWe just had an election year and there‚Äôs a lot of discussion around divisiveness,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúPeople might be wanting to see some unity, everybody coming together as a country.‚Äù\n\nFor the third consecutive year, the religious-themed He Gets Us commercial returned to the Super Bowl. This year's ad featured Johnny Cash's cover of ‚ÄúPersonal Jesus‚Äù and showed everyday people being helpful and heroic. Come Near, a nonprofit that says it aims to share ‚Äúthe love and message of Jesus in disruptive and personally engaging ways,\" funded the ad this year and last year after taking over the effort from a previous group.\n\nArtificial intelligence arrives\n\nSeveral Super Bowl ads made the case for AI as a helpmate. Chris Pratt, Chris Hemsworth and Kris Jenner teamed up for an ad wearing Meta 's smart glasses, which use artificial intelligence to answer questions about what wearers are seeing. Actor Walton Goggins pitched GoDaddy Airo, which uses AI to help build websites and social content. And Google's ‚Äú50 States, 50 Stories‚Äù campaign is showing viewers a small business from their state that's using Google's Gemini AI assistant. But Cirkul, a water bottle brand, poked fun at AI, showing comedian Adam Devine accidentally ordering 100,000 bottles using the AI assistant on his phone.\n\nKendrick Lamar performed the Super Bowl LIX halftime show featuring cameos from SZA, Samuel L. Jackson and Serena Williams.",

Further information can be found here.\n\nAfter the shooting, the the gunmen get back into the car, which is last seen east on Adams before turning south on the Roosevelt Boulevard, Small said.\n\nPolice also found a pickup truck parked \"right around the corner\" with a semiautomatic gun with blood on it inside, which officers could see, Small said.\n\nPolice continued to scour over clues and search for a motive Monday morning. Small said investigators hoped to see if any cameras at local businesses also captured the shooting on video.\n\nThis shooting happened hours after a 35-year-old man was shot along the 4000 block of East Roosevelt Boulevard, which is not far from the deadly double homicide scene, around 10:45 p.m. on Feb. 9, 2025, police said. The man in the earlier shooting was hospitalized in critical condition.\n\nPolice made no link between the shootings.\n\nDespite this double homicide, the total number of killings (at least 22) in Philadelphia so far in 2025 is down 33% from the same time last year and the lowest year-to-date homicide total since Philadelphia Police started sharing homicide data online in 2007.",

And I‚Äôm not going to let that happen,\" he said. \"Why are we paying $200 billion a year, essentially a subsidy to Canada?‚Äù\n\nThe U.S. is not subsidizing Canada. The U.S. buys products from the natural resource-rich nation, including commodities like oil. While the trade gap in goods has ballooned in recent years to $72 billion in 2023, the deficit largely reflects America‚Äôs imports of Canadian energy.\n\nGet top local stories in Philly delivered to you every morning. Sign up for NBC Philadelphia's News Headlines newsletter.\n\nTrump has repeatedly suggested that Canada would be better off if it agreed to become the 51st U.S. state ‚Äî a prospect that is deeply unpopular among Canadians.\n\nTrudeau said Friday during a closed-door session with business and labor leaders that Trump‚Äôs talk of making Canada the 51st U.S. state was ‚Äúa real thing\" and tied to desire for access to the country‚Äôs natural resources.\n\n‚ÄúMr. Trump has it in mind that the easiest way to do it is absorbing our country and it is a real thing. In my conversations with him on ...,‚Äù Trudeau said, according to CBC, Canada's public broadcaster. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre very aware of our resources of what we have, and they very much want to be able to benefit from those.\"\n\nSpeaking to reporters aboard Air Force One on Sunday as he traveled to the Super Bowl game in New Orleans, Trump continued to threaten a country that has long been one of the U.S.'s closest allies. He claimed that Canada is \"not viable as a country‚Äù without U.S. trade, and warned that the founding NATO member can no longer depend on the U.S. for military protection.\n\n‚ÄúYou know, they don‚Äôt pay very much for military. And the reason they don‚Äôt pay much is they assume that we‚Äôre going to protect them,\" he said. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not an assumption they can make because ‚Äî why are we protecting another country?\"\n\nThe U.S. reached an agreement with Mexico and Canada on Monday to delay a 25% tariff on all imports from the countries for one month.\n\nIn the Fox interview, which was pre-taped this weekend in Florida, Trump also said that he has not seen enough action from Canada and Mexico to stave off the tariffs he has threatened to impose on the country's two largest trading partners once a 30-day extension is up.\n\n‚ÄúNo, it‚Äôs not good enough,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúSomething has to happen. It‚Äôs not sustainable. And I‚Äôm changing it.‚Äù\n\nTrump last week agreed to a 30-day pause on his plan to slap Mexico and Canada with a 25% tariff on all imports except for Canadian oil, natural gas and electricity, which would be taxed at 10%, after the countries took steps to appease his concerns about border security and drug trafficking.\n\nAboard Air Force One, Trump said that he would on Monday announce a 25% tariff on all steel and aluminum imports into the U.S., including from Canada and Mexico, and unveil a plan for reciprocal tariffs later in the week.\n\n‚ÄúVery simply it‚Äôs if they charge us, we charge them,‚Äù he said.\n\nTrump‚Äôs participation in the Super Bowl interview marked a return to tradition. Presidents have typically granted a sit-down to the network broadcasting the game, the most-watched television event of the year. But both Trump and his predecessor, Joe Biden, were inconsistent in their participation.\n\nBiden declined to participate last year ‚Äî turning down a massive audience in an election year ‚Äî and also skipped an appearance in 2023, when efforts by his team to have Biden speak with a Fox Corp. streaming service instead of the main network failed. During his first term, Trump participated three out of four years.\n\nTrump was the first sitting president to attend the Super Bowl in person ‚Äî something he told Baier he was surprised to learn.\n\n‚ÄúI thought it would be a good thing for the country to have the president at the game,‚Äù he said.\n\nDuring his flight to New Orleans, Trump signed a proclamation declaring Feb. 9 ‚Äúthe first ever Gulf of America Day\" as Air Force One flew over the body of water that he renamed by proclamation from the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nTrump in the interview, also defended the work of billionaire Elon Musk, whose so-called Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, has been drawing deep concern from Democrats as he moves to shut down whole government agencies and fire large swaths of the federal workforce in the name of rooting out waste and inefficiency.\n\nMusk, Trump said, has ‚Äúbeen terrific,\" and will target the Department of Education and the military next.\n\n‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to find billions, hundreds of billions of dollars of fraud and abuse,‚Äù Trump predicted. ‚ÄúI campaigned on this.\"\n\nHe was also asked about his dancing, which has become a popular meme on social media.\n\n‚ÄúI don't know what it is,\" he said. ‚ÄúI try and walk off sometimes without dancing and I can‚Äôt.

And the adversity at the beginning of the year and, shoot, the adversity through the season, through the injuries, through ups and downs, everything.\n\n‚ÄúI think that when you embrace adversity, it does something to you. It does something to you personally, each and every individual on that football team adversity does something to and it does something to you as a football as well.‚Äù\n\nThe Eagles faced a ton of adversity in 2023, when they collapsed, losing 6 of their last 7 games, including a blowout wild-card round exit.\n\nHeck, Sirianni was almost fired after the season.\n\nAnd it wasn‚Äôt like the Eagles got off to an incredible start in 2024. They had a 2-2 record and many were wondering if the head coach would survive the season. He didn‚Äôt just survive. He thrived.\n\nAnd he thinks that adversity of going through those things is what made this team grow close. But that‚Äôs not the only reason.\n\n‚ÄúThey work their butts off to connect,‚Äù Sirianni said. ‚ÄúThey work their butts off, in a world where it‚Äôs all about your phone, they put their phones down and did stuff together. That was the first and foremost key. You can‚Äôt substitute the time that it takes to connect. The time that they had with dinners together, in the game room, in between meetings and all that different stuff.\n\n‚ÄúThey were selfless. Just look at Jalen (Hurts) and A.J. (Brown) and DeVonta (Smith) and everybody. The group rush on defense, not caring who gets the credit and just wanting to win. There were so many things.‚Äù\n\nThe Eagles talked about how close they were for most of the season. How much they hung out together. How much they cared for one another. And that was evident in the winning locker room in the Superdome. The Eagles had a wild celebration.\n\nCigar smoke filled the locker room as players sprayed beer and champagne, danced together and passed around the Lombardi Trophy from player to player to coach to staffer.\n\nFor a brief few minutes, safety Reed Blankenship lowered his protective ski goggles and explained what was so special about the 2024 Eagles.\n\n‚ÄúI‚Äôve never been a part of a team this close,‚Äù Blankenship said. ‚ÄúThrough the ups and downs, we didn‚Äôt care about what anybody said. We had each other‚Äôs backs. We created a family, a brotherhood that will last forever.‚Äù\n\nSubscribe to Eagle Eye anywhere you get your podcasts:\n\nApple Podcasts | YouTube Music | Spotify | Stitcher | Simplecast | RSS | Watch on YouTube",

Sign up for NBC Philadelphia's News Headlines newsletter.\n\nIt's still unclear which way Trump will lean, however. While some lawmakers and health policy experts said Trump could weaken the negotiations in a way that helps the pharmaceutical industry, other experts said he could double down and try to save patients and the federal government even more money to outdo his predecessor.\n\nThe path he takes could have huge stakes for the prices 68 million Medicare beneficiaries in the U.S. pay for their medications. It will also have big implications for companies like Novo Nordisk, Bristol Myers Squibb, Pfizer and Merck, among others whose drugs were included in the first two rounds of talks.\n\nThe negotiations are a key provision of Biden's Inflation Reduction Act, or IRA, that aims to lower prescription medicine costs for seniors and save the government nearly $100 billion in Medicare spending over the next decade. The pharmaceutical industry fiercely opposes the price talks, arguing in a flurry of lawsuits that they threaten profits and discourage drug innovation.\n\nThe Trump administration has offered few specifics on its approach to the negotiations, apart from saying in January that it will aim for \"greater transparency\" in the ongoing second cycle of the process and hear any ideas for improving it from external stakeholders.\n\nMaking significant changes to the law or repealing it altogether would be an uphill battle because it requires help from Congress, where Republicans hold slim majorities. Reining in high health-care costs has strong bipartisan support in a nation where patients pay two to three times more for prescription drugs than people in other developed countries, making it a potentially unpopular move for Trump.\n\nSo the Trump administration could move to implement the provision differently than Biden did, including by changing how the government interprets the law's selection criteria for drugs, among other potential changes.\n\n\"I think it is a question of how they interpret some of the statutory language,\" said Juliette Cubanski, deputy director of the program on Medicare policy at KFF, a health policy organization.\n\nCubanski said we can expect a first glimpse at any changes in the coming months.\n\nThe Trump administration will start the monthslong negotiation process for a second cycle of 15 drugs, which will have new prices go into effect in 2027. The Biden administration selected those medicines in January before Trump took office. Drugmakers have until the end of February to decide whether to participate in the talks, which they likely will because they otherwise face stiff financial penalties.\n\nWhat Trump could do on his own\n\nTrump has so far only indicated the need for more transparency in Medicare drug price negotiations. Kupferberg said that could mean disclosing more information about the government's rationale for selecting drugs or settling on prices.\n\nDuring the first round of the talks, Medicare provided opportunities for public input from patients, caregivers and consumer groups. But Kupferberg said the Trump administration could move to bring in other stakeholders beyond manufacturers and patients, like insurers or even middlemen called pharmacy benefit managers.\n\n\"It could be a much broader type of negotiation process,\" he said.\n\nEHStock | iStock | Getty Images\n\nThe administration could also reinterpret the guidelines of the law, which could change what products get selected and how much prices fall, according to Amy Campbell, associate dean for law and health sciences at the University of Illinois Chicago School of Law.\n\nFor example, the IRA says the drugs selected for negotiations must have been on the market for at least seven years without generic competitors, or 11 years in the case of biologic products such as vaccines. But the Trump administration, when selecting another round of drugs, may have \"looser standards\" for determining whether a drug has competition in the market and should be exempt from negotiated prices, Campbell said.\n\nTrump could also revise what Medicare considers one drug for the purpose of negotiations, KFF's Cubanski said. Currently, different products that share the same active ingredient can be selected as a single product, which the pharmaceutical industry opposes.\n\nThe Biden administration, for example, included three of Novo Nordisk's branded medications with the same active ingredient ‚Äì semaglutide ‚Äì as one product in the second cycle of price talks. That includes the weight loss drug Wegovy, diabetes pill Rybelsus and the anti-obesity injection Ozempic. Of the three, Ozempic makes up the lion's share of Medicare spending.\n\nEither of those changes to how Medicare selects drugs could benefit drugmakers and lessen the revenue they lose from lower prices.\n\nThe bigger question is how aggressively Medicare will negotiate prices under Trump, Cubanski said. Currently, the final negotiated price for a drug cannot exceed an upper limit, or \"ceiling\" price, established by the IRA.\n\nTrump could influence whether Medicare's initial price offer for a drug is closer to the ceiling price, which could weaken the program's ability to secure a deeper discount.\n\nBigger changes in Congress are a challenge\n\nMajor changes to the price negotiations are much less likely to occur, as they would require help from Congress. For example, one of the pharmaceutical industry's biggest issues with the process is what drugmakers calls the \"pill penalty.\"\n\nThe law essentially spares biologics like vaccines from new negotiated prices for 13 years after they receive U.S. approval, compared with just nine years for small-molecule drugs that come in a pill or tablet form. The industry contends that the discrepancy discourages companies from investing in the development of small-molecule drugs, which are more convenient for patients.\n\nImages By Tang Ming Tung | Digitalvision | Getty Images\n\nCubanski said bipartisan legislation was introduced last year that proposes eliminating the pill penalty. If that bill makes it through Congress and to Trump's desk, \"I don't see why he wouldn't sign it,\" Cubanski said.\n\nShe added that there appears to be growing interest in legislative changes to the negotiation program, but \"whether you get enough support in Congress is still really an open question.\"\n\nThere isn't the same level of bipartisan support for changes to the IRA as there is for efforts like pharmacy benefit manager reform, said Jesse Dresser, partner in Frier Levitt's life sciences department.\n\n\"I could see something like [PBM reform] happening a lot sooner than I could see trying to open up the IRA and tweak it, even if it's something that the administration might ultimately get behind,\" Dresser said.\n\nLegal fight is still pending\n\nIt's unclear how Trump will approach the ongoing legal fight between manufacturers and the federal government over the Medicare program.\n\nThe pharmaceutical industry's legal challenges, which argue that the talks are unconstitutional and should be stopped, have so far been unsuccessful in court. Nine lawsuits were ongoing as of January.\n\n\"Will the Trump administration continue to defend the program? Or maybe not as aggressively defend the program?\" Cubanski said. \"I think those are some key questions.\"\n\nIf the Trump administration stops defending the program in court, judges could then make decisions on the matter without any opposition, Kupferberg said. But he said he doesn't believe the administration will want that outcome.\n\nThe Trump administration would likely \"want to take control of that process, where the parties work out an agreement or revise and change the interpretation of the law,\" Kupferberg said.\n\nHe added that it doesn't seem like Trump would want the entire negotiation program to disappear based on the lawsuits. That's because it would leave Trump in the position to come up with a replacement for Medicare drug price negotiations, and we \"just haven't seen one yet\" from him, Kupferberg said.",

This is so wasteful!‚Äù Trump wrote in a post Sunday night on his Truth Social site. ‚ÄúI have instructed my Secretary of the US Treasury to stop producing new pennies.‚Äù\n\nThe move by Trump is the latest in what has been a rapid-fire effort by his new administration to enact sweeping change through executive order and proclamation on issues ranging from immigration, to gender and diversity, to the name of the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nTrump had not discussed his desire to eliminate the penny during his campaign. But Elon Musk's so-called Department of Government Efficiency raised the prospect in a post on X last month highlighting the penny‚Äôs cost.\n\nGet top local stories in Philly delivered to you every morning. Sign up for NBC Philadelphia's News Headlines newsletter.\n\nThe U.S. Mint reported losing $85.3 million in the 2024 fiscal year that ended in September on the nearly 3.2 billion pennies it produced. Every penny cost nearly $0.037 ‚Äî up from $0.031 the year before.\n\nThe mint also loses money on the nickel, with each of the $0.05 coins costing nearly $0.14 to make.\n\nIt is unclear whether Trump has the power to unilaterally eliminate the lowly one-cent coin. Currency specifications -- including the size and metal content of coins -- are dictated by Congress.\n\nBut Robert K. Triest, an economics professor at Northeastern University, has argued that there might be wiggle room.\n\n‚ÄúThe process of discontinuing the penny in the U.S. is a little unclear. It would likely require an act of Congress, but the Secretary of the Treasury might be able to simply stop the minting of new pennies,‚Äù he said last month.\n\nMembers of Congress have repeatedly introduced legislation taking aim at the zinc coin with copper plating. Proposals over the years have attempted to temporarily suspend the penny‚Äôs production, eliminate it from circulation, or require that prices be rounded to the nearest five cents, according to the Congressional Research Service.\n\nElon Musk spoke to crowds at the Presidential Inauguration parade event at Capital One Arena. President Donald Trump is set to attend the inaugural rally later Monday.\n\nProponents of eliminating the coin have cited cost savings, speedier checkouts at cash registers, and the fact that a number of countries have already eliminated their one-cent coins. Canada, for instance, stopped minting its penny in 2012.\n\nIt wouldn't be the first time the U.S. eliminated its least valuable coin. The half-cent coin was discontinued by Congress in 1857.\n\nTrump's new administration has been sharply focused on cutting costs, with Musk, who has been brought on to lead the task, targeting entire agencies and large swaths of the federal workforce as he tries to identify a goal of $2 trillion in savings.\n\n‚ÄúLet‚Äôs rip the waste out of our great nations budget, even if it‚Äôs a penny at a time,‚Äù Trump wrote in his post.\n\nTrump sent the message as he was departing New Orleans after watching the first half of the Super Bowl.\n\n___\n\nAP White House Correspondent Zeke Miller contributed to this report.",

        "fullContent": "NEW ORLEANS ‚Äî The Eagles didn‚Äôt just beat the Chiefs in Super Bowl LIX.\n\nThey completely dominated a team going for the first three-peat in Super Bowl history. The final score was 40-22 but it wasn‚Äôt anywhere near that close.\n\nThis is the second Lombardi Trophy in Eagles history but this time the party pretty much started in the second quarter. (That party will continue through the parade down Broad Street on Friday.)\n\nGet top local stories in Philly delivered to you every morning. Sign up for NBC Philadelphia's News Headlines newsletter.\n\nLet‚Äôs get to the position grades:\n\nQuarterback\n\nJalen Hurts: 17/22, 221 yards, 2 TDs, 1 INT; 11 rushing attempts, 72 yards, 1 TD\n\nAt just 26 years old, Jalen Hurts got to hoist the Lombardi Trophy on Sunday night in New Orleans and also took home MVP honors. Sure, Hurts threw an interception the second quarter but that was really his only mistake. He completed over 77% of his passes. His 72 rushing yards are the most ever for a quarterback in a Super Bowl, surpassing his own record of 70 yards from Super Bowl LVII a couple years ago.\n\nAnd Hurts‚Äô passer rating of 119.7 was the highest of his postseason career. The Eagles already had a 27-0 lead late in the fourth quarter when Hurts hit DeVonta Smith for a 46-yard dagger. Hurts also had some great ball placement on throws to Jahan Dotson, A.J. Brown and Dallas Goedert.\n\nGrade: A+\n\nRunning back\n\nSaquon Barkley: 25 carries, 57 yards; 6 catches for 40 yards\n\nThe Chiefs did everything they could to stop Saquon Barkley, which is a wise strategy and it kind of worked. Barkley averaged just 2.3 yards per carry but he also has 40 receiving yards and a huge block in pass protection on that long pass to Jahan Dotson.\n\nAnd Barkley surpassed Terrell Davis for the most rushing yards in a regular season + postseason in NFL history:\n\n1. Saquon Barkley (2024): 2,504\n\n2. Terrell Davis (1998): 2,476\n\n3. Terrell Davis (1997): 2,331\n\n4. Eric Dickerson (1984): 2,212\n\n5. Adrian Peterson (2012): 2,196\n\nGrade: A\n\nReceiver\n\nDeVonta Smith: 4 catches on 5 targets for 69 yards, 1 TD\n\nWhile Smith led the way for the receivers thanks to his 46-yard touchdown catch, they also got contributions from A.J. Brown (3 catches for 43 yards and a touchdowns) and Jahan Dotson (2 for 42). Dotson nearly had a 28-yard touchdown catch in the first quarter but was down at the 1-yard line; Hurts Tush-Pushed in the score. And Brown was able to shake free for a 12-yard touchdown catch in the second quarter. Brown could have had more without a ticky-tacky OPI call against him on the first drive.\n\nGrade: A\n\nTight end\n\nDallas Goedert: 2 catches on 2 targets for 27 yards\n\nWhile Goedert didn‚Äôt have a huge game, his 20-yard catch on a deep crosser on the first drive really helped kickstart the offense. He also drew a penalty on an unnecessary roughness call on that drive. Both Grant Calcaterra and E.J. Jenkins were blocking on Sunday.\n\nGrade: A\n\nOffensive line\n\nThe Eagles‚Äô offensive line dominated the Chiefs‚Äô defensive line on Sunday. Hurts was sacked twice but had a ton of clean pockets in this game. Lane Johnson and Jordan Mailata were brick walls on the edges. Mekhi Becton had to leave the game briefly with a knee injury and was replaced by Tyler Steen. But Becton was able to return. There were some questions coming out of the NFC Championship Game about Landon Dickerson (knee) and Cam Jurgens (back) but that extra week seemed to help; both held up really well.\n\nGrade: A\n\nDefensive line\n\nJosh Sweat: 6 tackles, 2 1/2 sacks, 3 QB hits, 2 TFLs\n\nThis was a dominant performance from the Eagles‚Äô defensive line. Mahomes was sacked six times for the first time in his NFL career. Before Sunday, the most times he had ever been sacked in a playoff game was four times. Josh Sweat led the way with 2 1/2, followed by Milton Williams (2), Jordan Davis (1) and Jalyx Hunt (1/2). The Eagles also hit Mahomes 11 times. In the run game, the Eagles gave up just 49 yards and an average of 4.5 yards per attempt.\n\nGrade: A+\n\nLinebacker\n\nZack Baun: 7 tackles 1 QB hits, 1 PBU, 1 INT\n\nIt should be no surprise that Zack Baun came through in the biggest game of the season with an interception in the second quarter that led to a quick Eagles‚Äô touchdown pass. Oren Burks finished with 5 tackles in place of Nakobe Dean, who was in New Orleans to celebrate with his teammates after a season-ending knee injury in the wild-card round.\n\nGrade: A\n\nSecondary\n\nCooper DeJean: 3 tackles, 1 PBU, 1 pick-6\n\nAfter going his entire rookie season without a single interception, DeJean‚Äôs 38-yard interception return touchdown in the second quarter was arguably the biggest play of the day. Mahomes ended up throwing for 257 yards but 109 of those yards came in the fourth quarter after the game was well out of reach. Quinyon Mitchell blanketed Xavier Worthy down the left sideline on a play that was designed to take a shot downfield. Give credit to Avonte Maddox, who had a crucial 4th-down pass breakup after he came in the game for a hobbled DeJean. Both C.J. Gardner-Johnson and Reed Blankenship kept the top on the defense.\n\nGrade: A\n\nSpecial teams\n\nJake Elliott: 4/4 on FGs; 4/4 on PATs\n\nThere were some reasons to be concerned about Jake Elliott entering this game but he made field goals from 48, 29, 48 and 50 yards in the Super Bowl. He also made all four of his PATs. Braden Mann had two punts and downed both inside the 20 ‚Äî one at the 12 and one at the 6. Cooper DeJean had a nifty 13-yard punt return in the first half. Kenny Gainwell had a tackle to prevent a dangerous kick return. Avonte Maddox and Grant Calcaterra recovered onside kicks.\n\nGrade: A\n\nCoaching\n\nFinal record: 18-3; Super Bowl champions\n\nNick Sirianni deserves a ton of credit. The Eagles contemplated firing him in the offseason and he just came back to the Super Bowl and won the whole thing. Sure, he‚Äôs a bit unorthodox and isn‚Äôt perfect, but he‚Äôs perfect for this team. And Sirianni is about to get a contract extension in the offseason.\n\nBoth coordinators had good games in this one. Kellen Moore finished off his one-year stint with the Eagles strong; he‚Äôs expected to get hired by the Saints for their head coaching job. And Vic Fangio put on a clinic. He didn‚Äôt blitz one time on Sunday and called a masterful game to beat Andy Reid, Patrick Mahomes and the Chiefs.\n\nGrade: A+\n\nSubscribe to Eagle Eye anywhere you get your podcasts:\n\nApple Podcasts | YouTube Music | Spotify | Stitcher | Simplecast | RSS | Watch on YouTube",

If a judge tried to command the attorney general in how to use her discretion as a prosecutor, that‚Äôs also illegal,\" Vance wrote on X, adding, \"Judges aren‚Äôt allowed to control the executive‚Äôs legitimate power.\"\n\nIt wasn't clear what judge or court order Vance was referring to or whether he was making a broad statement. Several of Trump's sweeping agenda items have met legal roadblocks since he took office.\n\nA spokesperson for Vance didn't respond to questions seeking clarification.\n\nGet top local stories in Philly delivered to you every morning. Sign up for NBC Philadelphia's News Headlines newsletter.\n\nSome of Trump‚Äôs executive orders have already been challenged in court in over two dozen lawsuits, and judges have temporarily halted a number of them. In the latest legal challenge, on Saturday, a federal judge temporarily blocked Trump and tech billionaire Elon Musk‚Äôs Department of Government Efficiency from accessing sensitive Treasury Department payment systems and people‚Äôs personal data after 19 state attorneys general sued the administration.\n\nJamal Greene, a professor at Columbia Law School, pointed out that Vance wasn't explicitly saying the Trump administration was ready to ignore court orders.\n\n\"I think the tweet, taken on its own terms, is empty because it refers to the 'legitimate powers' of the executive. And the whole question in these cases is whether the executive is acting legitimately or not,\" Greene told NBC News.\n\n\"[Vance] has some cover in that sense,\" Greene added. \"He hasn't promised unlawful behavior.\"\n\nRick Pildes, a professor at New York University‚Äôs Law School, also highlighted Vance‚Äôs use of the words ‚Äúlegitimate powers‚Äù in his post but pointed out that the judiciary is the branch with the power to decide what a president can ‚Äúlegitimately‚Äù do or not do.\n\n\"Under the rule of law and the Constitution, it is the courts that determine whether some use of the executive power is lawful or not. That is the critical point,\" Pildes said via email.\n\n\"The concern is that the vice president‚Äôs statement could be taken to suggest that the Executive Branch is prepared to refuse to comply with a court order based on the president‚Äôs own view that he has a power that the courts have concluded he does not,\" he added. \"A president who orders his officials not to comply with court orders would be creating a constitutional crisis.\"\n\nGreene pointed out that others in Trump's orbit, including Musk, have floated ignoring court orders.\n\nOn Saturday, Musk reposted a post on X from a user who wrote, \"I don‚Äôt like the precedent it sets when you defy a judicial ruling, but I‚Äôm just wondering what other options are these judges leaving us.\"\n\nGreene said, \"Given the context of which [Vance's post] has happened, it seems to be a winking suggestion that maybe ignoring a court order is on the table.\"\n\nIn a separate post on X, Musk called for U.S. District Judge Paul Engelmayer to be impeached after his ruling early Saturday that temporarily halts DOGE employees‚Äô access to Treasury Department data.\n\n\"A corrupt judge protecting corruption,\" Musk wrote. \"He needs to be impeached NOW!\"\n\nIf DOGE employees, for example, were to continue accessing sensitive Treasury Department data, Engelmayer would have little recourse.\n\n\"The bottom line is that our system is predicated on good faith but also the rule of law in America means that the government abides by court rulings,\" Dan Urman, a law professor at Northeastern University, told NBC News.\n\n\"It would really provoke a crisis of sorts,\" Urman said. \"The courts don't have ‚Äî famously, from Federalist 78 ‚Äî they lack the power of the purse and the sword, right? They don't have an army, and they don't have a huge budget. They have to rely on, sort of, their legitimacy.\"\n\nWhile the courts would have few ways to punish a president for violating their rulings, the third branch of government ‚Äî Congress ‚Äî does have a way to intervene.\n\n\"The key point is that the executive would be behaving lawlessly if it did that,\" Greene said. \"The solution to that within the constitutional design is impeachment.\"\n\nRight now, Republicans control every branch of the federal government, so the chances of the GOP's leading the impeachment and removal of the president of their own party are slim.\n\n\"If Congress isn't doing that, there's not a lot that one can do,\" Greene said. \"That's the moment at which you're no longer operating within a system of constitutional self-government.\"\n\nThe executive branch's ignoring the judicial branch \"would just be the raw exercise of power,\" Greene said, \"and a Congress that simply refuses to respond to it in any way or assert its own institutional prerogative ... that's a breakdown of the system.\"\n\nUrman said the American political system is designed to have three equal branches of government acting as checks on one another.\n\n\"Courts cannot do all of the work,\" he said. \"They have, they have to have more support from other branches and from society itself, right? It doesn't work when they're acting alone.\"\n\nThis article first appeared on NBCNews.com. Read more from NBC News here:",

This is so wasteful!\" Trump wrote in a post Sunday night on his Truth Social site. \"I have instructed my Secretary of the US Treasury to stop producing new pennies.\"\n\nTrump's attack on the penny came after Elon Musk's DOGE already had targeted the coin for elimination. Among all the contentious battles that the Trump administration and Musk find themselves in over government spending, this is one that most economists and others in the monetary ecosystem seem nonplussed about.\n\nGet top local stories in Philly delivered to you every morning. Sign up for NBC Philadelphia's News Headlines newsletter.\n\nAccording to the Federal Reserve, there are 114 billion pennies in circulation, or $1.14 billion, or 0.006% of the money in circulation. It costs $192 million a year to produce pennies, about 4% of the Mint's operating budget but only 0.00003% of the U.S. federal budget. This expense makes the penny expendable, according to economists.\n\nDavid Gulley, an economics professor at Bentley University, said the estimated cost of making a penny, at around three cents, is an economic burden, \"because millions vanish under couch cushions each year, the U.S. Mint must produce a steady stream of replacements.\"\n\nRounding up prices\n\nBut banishing the penny could alter the prices of many small-ticket goods.\n\n\"Prices would have to be rounded to the nearest five cents to allow for cash payments and correct change received back ‚Äî that will be the end of $6.99 fast food combo meals,\" Gulley said, adding that it's not clear if businesses would tend to round up or down.\n\nThat pricing decision does matter, with some citing the penny's impact on inflation, but even that appears minimal.\n\n\"Businesses might round up more often than down, leading to a slight inflationary effect,\" said David Smith, an economics professor at Pepperdine University's Graziadio Business School. But he added that studies have shown that rounding prices to the nearest nickel does not lead to significant inflation.\n\nIn Canada, which eliminated the penny in 2013, cash transactions were rounded to the nearest five cents, based on the total amount of the transaction, not on each individual item.\n\nTo the extent rounding up occurs more frequently than rounding down, cash consumers would be paying the price for the cost efficiency Trump and Musk are seeking, said Ajay Patel, a professor of finance at Wake Forest University School of Business.\n\nAmerica's remaining cash consumers get hit\n\nThere are still people who use cash for many payments, and these consumers would be the most impacted, but the effect would be modest, according to Gulley, as more payments move away from physical currency. As recently as 2015, one-third of transactions in the U.S. were by cash, but that has now fallen to under 20%, and it is expected to continue on the decline.\n\nBut that means people at the bottom of the economic ladder will probably feel the penny pinch the most.\n\n\"The individuals paying for this benefit will be those who purchase products and services using cash and will continue to do so going forward because they are either unbanked or unable to access debit or credit cards or a digital wallet,\" Patel said.\n\nGates Little, the CEO of Alabama-based Southern Bank, said the financial services sector won't miss the pennies.\n\n\"Eliminating the U.S. penny wouldn't make any difference in the economy,\" Little said. \"I can't think of how it could hurt.\"\n\nYour saved penny may increase in value\n\nStill, Little said, the gazillion pennies hoarded in piggy banks, sock drawers, and hiding under your car seats would gradually increase in value.\n\n\"Pennies would become more scarce over time and eventually increase in value. In the near term, they might become useless, depending on how the Treasury treats them. I would think that would have to be in phases so people could convert them to other denominations, thus removing them from the system,\" Little said.\n\nThere are pockets of population around the country where both of these outcomes matter. Laura Maike, of Burton, Ohio, notes that the Amish will feel the pinch right now.\n\n\"Here in Northeast Ohio's Amish country, we still use pennies regularly,\" Maike said of her area, which includes thousands of generally cash-using Amish. \"How would this work for cash-only transactions? It would be impossible to give exact change as the purchaser or seller.\"\n\nMaike is more bullish, though, on a world in which the end of the penny means existing pennies increase in value.\n\n\"I have a wheat penny sitting in my jewelry box because I knew when I found it nearly 20 years ago that they were becoming increasingly harder to find,\" Maike said.\n\nPennies depicting two sheaves of wheat were discontinued in favor of today's Lincoln versions in 1958.\n\nSmith said there are other benefits to getting rid of the heavy-to-transport pennies.\n\n\"Eliminating the penny would save taxpayers millions of dollars each year. In addition, the production of pennies has environmental costs, including the mining of zinc and copper, eliminating the penny could have a positive environmental impact,\" he said.\n\nSome Americans are reacting to the end of the penny with a sense of humor. \"How will people give their two cents?\" said Eileen Kailholz, a retiree in Bright, Indiana.\n\nBut it's not entirely a joking matter. Nate Throckmorton, an associate professor of economics at The College of William & Mary, says it may be time to start keep an eye on another coin in your piggy bank: the nickel.\n\n\"It's the nickel we should worry about,\" Throckmorton said.\n\nIt takes three cents to make a penny, but 11 cents to make a nickel.",

Sign up for NBC Philadelphia's News Headlines newsletter.\n\nO'Toole, an appointee of former President Bill Clinton, in Monday's hearing will consider arguments from a handful of employee unions and the Trump administration about whether to block the plan from resuming.\n\nThe unions in court filings slammed the buyout plan as an \"unlawful ultimatum,\" calling it a \"sweeping and stunningly arbitrary action to solicit blanket resignations of federal workers.\" They are asking O'Toole for a temporary restraining order while they seek additional relief from the courts.\n\nBryan Dozier | Afp | Getty Images\n\nThe Trump administration told the judge that the buyouts are a key piece of President Donald Trump's efforts to overhaul the federal workforce, and argued that pausing the deadline would have \"remarkably disruptive and inequitable repercussions.\"\n\nThe hearing in U.S. District Court in Boston is set for 2 p.m. ET.\n\nThe roughly two million federal employees eligible for the buyout offer have been encouraged to accept it by Elon Musk, the head of Trump's so-called Department of Government Efficiency, which aims to slash the size of the federal bureaucracy.\n\nThe offer, made in a Jan. 28 email from OPM titled Fork in the Road, gave federal workers the option to immediately resign, and retain pay and benefits until Sept. 30.\n\nTo take the offer, they simply had to reply to the email by Feb. 6 with the word \"Resign.\"\n\nThe unprecedented ultimatum quickly raised concerns about whether the Trump administration's plan was lawful.\n\nSome legal experts said that since Congress has only appropriated funds through March 14, the Trump administration is making payment promises that it cannot guarantee.\n\nSome federal officials have flagged concerns that department secretaries may be able to rescind employees' deferred resignation packages after they are accepted, leaving those workers without pay. OPM has denied that, pointing to a memo declaring that the government's assurances are binding.\n\nThis is developing news. Please check back for updates.",

After some research, he discovers it's a rare William Dorsey painting.\n\nGlenside, Pennsylvania -- Andy Robbins knows art. He's an artist himself and comes from a family of art enthusiasts. He also loves thrifting and hunting for treasure.\n\nSo, picture his surprise when he found a painting on the shelf at new Life Thrift in Glenside seemingly from 1864!\n\n\"It's kind of a nice watercolor. Had like a mill and a stream and a little guy fishing on a hill,\" said Andy.\n\n\"I was able to discern a signature and a date. Had Dorsey and 1864 on it. And white paint. From there, what I did is I pulled out my phone, took a look at it, looked it up.\"\n\nSo, he bought it for 10 bucks.\n\n\"I brought it home, posted on Instagram with some of the information that I had found and almost immediately, Machiko from 1838, Black Metropolis reached out to tell me more about William H. Dorsey.\"\n\nDorsey was an African American artist, scrapbooker and cultural historian living in Philadelphia in the late 1800s. He painted the watercolor in 1864 during the Civil War. And it's the only known painting Dorsey completed in existence.\n\nAndy knew this piece of living history was bigger than just himself and deserved to be shown to the world and studied. So, he donated it to the Historical Society of Pennsylvania.\n\nDavid Brigham from the Historical Society of Pennsylvania says, \"William Dorsey was 25 years old when he made this watercolor. So, he was young. He was aspiring, he went on to accomplish other things, including, playing an important role in the formation of the American Negro Historical Society. So, this painting, embodies those stories.\"\n\nFramed by his experiences of living through the Civil War, Dorsey's art and life is now taking on new appreciation.\n\nAndy says, \"It was something that was always bigger than what needed to be on my wall.\"\n\nDorseys work now where it belongs\n\nAll thanks to the eye of an art lover fishing it out of a thrift store.",

They laid down an irregular flagstone patio, framed with boulders and topped with colorful planters and a toasty propane fire pit.\n\nJustin Bates founded Bates Landscaping in 2011. He and his siblings had grown up working in their father's landscape business. Though Justin loved it, he he went to work in the restaurant industry as an adult, but soon found he missed working outdoors. So he cashed out his retirement savings, bought some tools and hired some workers.\n\nHe started out of his mother's garage in Lansdowne, mowing lawns for 8-10 customers.\n\nAs business grew, his brother, Dylan, came on board, and so did Melissa Blake. She is his lead designer, business development officer and wife. The two met working in that restaurant but she had a background in landscaping, with a degree from Penn State University and experience working at a tree care company.\n\nJustin's sister, Cailee works for the business too and so does Melissa's sister.\n\nTheir projects range from simple front yard renovations to give added curb appeal to total backyard transformations with water features and maybe a barrel sauna.\n\nIn February, they will participate in the the Philly Home + Garden Show for the first time. In their 30x30 space, they hope to show people how to maximize their outdoor space.\n\nWhile winter may not be the time most people think of lounging outdoors, they say now is the best time to call. It's when they're designing and sourcing materials for projects they'll complete in the spring.\n\nBates Landscaping | Facebook | Instagram\n\n705 St Marys St, Phoenixville, Pa. 19460\n\n484.887.8678 |info@bateslandscaping.net",

She also notably appeared to wear as a necklace the same \"T\" chain she wore on her thigh at the 2025 Grammys on Feb. 2.\n\nIn her suite, Swift was joined by longtime friends Ashley Avignone, the Haim sisters -- Alana Haim, Este Haim and Danielle Haim -- and Ice Spice, as well as her dad Scott and brother Austin.\n\nSwift and her friends and family watched the Chiefs suffer a loss to the Eagles, who ended the game as Super Bowl LIX champions.\n\nSwift and Kelce have been dating since 2023.\n\nThe first public sign of their relationship was on Sept. 24, 2023, when Swift attended a Chiefs home game, where she sat next to Kelce's mom, Donna.\n\nLast February, Swift flew from Japan, where she was performing her Eras Tour, to Las Vegas to watch Kelce and the Chiefs play the San Francisco 49ers in the 2024 Super Bowl.\n\nThe Chiefs defeated the 49ers 25-22 in an overtime victory, after which Swift joined Kelce on the field to celebrate.\n\nDuring this football season, Swift has also been by Kelce's side, supporting him most recently at the AFC Championship on Jan. 26, which sent the Chiefs to their third straight Super Bowl game.\n\nAt a press conference ahead of Sunday's game, Kelce lauded Swift when asked about what he admires most about her work ethic.\n\n\"To see the week in week out traveling from one country to the next and you know, how excruciating it is on her body and on her mind. It wasn't just her, it was her entire tour,\" he said, referring to her Eras Tour. \"It was the dancers, the band, the singers and everybody involved and it was an absolute machine.\"\n\n\"It was something I could admire watching and take a lot of notes from,\" he added.",

(AP Photo/George Walker IV)\n\nHurts threw for two touchdowns and ran for a score on a tush push to earn Super Bowl MVP honors, and Vic Fangio's defense was so dominant that the Eagles didn't need much from Saquon Barkley.\n\nThe game-changing running back finished with 57 yards, breaking Terrell Davis' record for yards rushing in a season, playoffs included. Hurts threw for 221 yards.\n\nRELATED: When is the Philadelphia Eagles Super Bowl parade? Team drops hint on social media\n\n\"This is the ultimate team game. You can't be great without the greatness of others. Great performance by everybody - offense, defense, special teams,\" Sirianni said. \"We didn't really ever care what anyone thought about how we won, or their opinions. All we want to do is win.\"\n\nHurts has been doubted since he started for Alabama in a national championship game and was benched for Tua Tagovailoa at halftime. Finishing second to Mahomes in MVP voting two years ago didn't quite silence all the detractors. Now, he's hoisted the Vince Lombardi trophy.\n\nJalen Hurts, left, holds the Vince Lombardi Trophy next to head coach Nick Sirianni after defeating the Kansas City Chiefs in the NFL Super Bowl 59 football game. (AP Photo/Matt Slocum)\n\nSirianni, who mocked fans chanting \"Fire Nick!\" during a victory over Cleveland in October and was called a \"clown\" on national television, also quieted critics by adding a championship ring to a coaching resume that includes the fifth-best winning percentage in league history.\n\n\"Things come right on time. The last time around, it wasn't our time, it wasn't my time and sometimes you have to accept that you have to wait your turn,\" said Hurts, who nearly led the Eagles to victory against the Chiefs two years ago in Arizona.\n\nWith Donald Trump becoming the first president in office to attend a Super Bowl, the Eagles outplayed Kansas City in every facet, delighting a raucous pro-Philly crowd that celebrated each score with a familiar rendition of \"Fly! Eagles! Fly!\"\n\nSEE ALSO: Eagles fans take over streets of Philadelphia after Super Bowl victory\n\nEven Taylor Swift's presence couldn't help the Chiefs. They lost for the first time in 10 games this season with the pop superstar in a suite watching boyfriend Travis Kelce, who didn't catch a pass until late in the third quarter.\n\nNot in Kansas City's worst nightmares could its fans have imagined such a lackluster performance. The Chiefs had won three of the previous five Super Bowls, losing 31-9 to Tom Brady and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers four years ago.\n\nMahomes was 8-0 against Fangio's defenses before the longtime coordinator and former Broncos head coach outcoached Andy Reid, capping his first season with his hometown team. Reid fell to 3-3 in Super Bowls, including a loss with the Eagles.\n\nThe Eagles sacked Mahomes six times, the most of his career, including 2 1/2 by Sweat and two by Milton Williams. And they did it without Fangio calling a single blitz.\n\n\"Defense wins championships,\" Hurts said. \"We saw how they played today. We saw the difference they made in the game. They gave us opportunities, gave us short fields. And we're able to do what we do.\"\n\nBarkley, the 2024 AP NFL Offensive Player of the Year, only had 31 yards rushing in the first half when Philly built a 24-0 lead.\n\nThe Chiefs were aiming to become the third team in NFL history to win three straight championships and the first to three-peat in the Super Bowl era. Two years ago, Mahomes led a comeback and Harrison Butker kicked the game-winning field goal in the final minute for a 38-35 victory over the Eagles. Mahomes rallied Kansas City to an overtime victory over San Francisco last year.\n\n\"That's a great football team and we had to come out and play our best, and we did,\" Sirianni said.\n\nThis time, a revamped Philly defense featuring eight new starters from the 2022 team made sure Mahomes had no chance to pull off his magic.\n\nSirianni was showered with Gatorade with nearly three minutes left in the game while backup QB Kenny Pickett took snaps in mop-up duty.\n\n\"Today was a rough day all around. Nothing went right. I didn't coach well. Proud of our guys for fighting. We will learn from this,\" Reid said. \"Too many turnovers, too many penalties. Against a good football team, can't do that.\"\n\nBarkley helped push Hurts into the end zone from the 1 to give Philadelphia a 7-0 lead in the first quarter.\n\nUp 10-0 after Jake Elliott's 48-yard field goal, Sweat and Jalyx Hunt sacked Mahomes on consecutive plays. Mahomes then rolled out and made an errant throw that was picked by DeJean, who returned it 38 yards for a 17-0 lead.\n\n\"When you have a great line up front ... makes it easier on the back end, and when they take the run away, it allows us to get the pass rush going,\" DeJean said.\n\nIt was Mahomes' first pick-6 in 21 career playoff games and ended a streak of 297 straight passes without an interception.\n\n\"We didn't start how we wanted to. The turnovers hurt. I take all the blame for that,\" Mahomes said.\n\nAll-Pro linebacker Zack Baun picked Mahomes again late in the second quarter, and Hurts connected with A.J. Brown on a 12-yard TD pass for a 24-0 lead.\n\nHurts threw a perfect 46-yard TD pass to DeVonta Smith to make it 34-0 late in the third.\n\nMahomes fired a 24-yard TD pass to Xavier Worthy to avoid the shutout, but the 2-point conversion failed. He threw two late, mostly meaningless TD passes, one to DeAndre Hopkins and another to Worthy.\n\nAfter two weeks of discussions about questionable calls that led to public perception that officials favor the Chiefs - a theory NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell called \"ridiculous\" - the first penalty of the game only fueled critics.\n\nA 32-yard pass from Hurts to Brown to the Chiefs 18 on fourth-and-2 was negated by a penalty for offensive pass interference. Brady, now a Fox analyst, and officiating analyst Mike Pereira both disagreed with the call, although Brown shoved Trent McDuffie's facemask.\n\nOn the next possession, the Eagles benefited from an unnecessary roughness penalty on McDuffie against Dallas Goedert following an incomplete pass on third-and-5.\n\nHurts then connected with Jahan Dotson on a 27-yard pass to the 1 and scored on the next play.\n\nHurts' streak of 217 passes without a pick ended in the first half when he was intercepted deep in Kansas City territory, but the Chiefs didn't capitalize.\n\nThe Green Bay Packers are the only NFL team to win three championships in a row, doing it from 1929-31 and 1965-67.\n\nThe NBA's Los Angeles Lakers from 2000-02, led by Kobe Bryant and Shaquille O'Neill, are the last team in the major American professional leagues to win three straight titles.",

He sings, \"Baby, I compare it to a kiss from a lime, on the bay,\" adding humor by noting, \"Ooh, the more I think of it, it's strange I'm a seal, yeah.\"\n\nThe commercial culminates with Seal's powerful vocals causing a volcano to erupt in the background, as orcas leap from the water in awe.\n\nTim Calkins, associate chair of the Marketing Department and Clinical Professor of Marketing at Northwestern University talks about the Super Bowl ads.\n\n'When Sally Met Hellmann's' reunites Meg Ryan & Billy Crystal for a nostalgic Super Bowl ad\n\nHellmann's brings Meg Ryan and Billy Crystal back to Katz's Deli for a Super Bowl spot that playfully nods to \"When Harry Met Sally.\"\n\nIn the 30-second ad, airing during the second quarter, the duo recreates their iconic diner scene, this time with a creamy twist.\n\nAs they celebrate their anniversary, Sally upgrades her turkey sandwich with Hellmann's mayo, leading to a reaction that once again turns heads.\n\nThe ad ends with a surprise cameo from Sydney Sweeney, who delivers the legendary line: \"I'll have what she's having.\"\n\nBen Affleck, Casey Affleck & Jeremy Strong star in Dunkin's new Super Bowl ad\n\nBen Affleck suits up once again for a new DunKings Super Bowl spot -- this time joined by his brother, Casey Affleck, and \"Succession\" star Jeremy Strong.\n\nThe ad shows the Affleck brothers outside Strong's dressing room in \"The Bean Method.\" While Casey, in a fuzzy pink bucket hat, explains that Strong is deep in method acting, the camera reveals him fully submerged in a vat of coffee beans.\n\nProduced by Ben Affleck and Matt Damon's Artists Equity, the full ad airs during the game's first commercial break, marking Dunkin's third straight Super Bowl appearance.\n\nMatthew McConaughey unravels Food & Football conspiracy in Uber Eats Super Bowl ad\n\nIn Uber Eats' full Super Bowl ad, Matthew McConaughey links football history to food, suggesting it's all part of a \"conspiracy to make us hungry.\"\n\nThe star-studded Century of Cravings spot features McConaughey alongside Kevin Bacon, who humorously ties his name to the sport's origins.

        "fullContent": "Kendrick Lamar brings America and 'Not Like Us' into history-making Super Bowl halftime show\n\nNEW ORLEANS -- \"Salutations!,\" the actor Samuel L. Jackson, dressed as Uncle Sam introduced Kendrick Lamar at New Orleans' Caesars Superdome for the 2025 Super Bowl halftime show - a powerful, commanding creative choice by the first solo hip-hop artist to ever headline the coveted slot.\n\nAs if there were any doubts of the Pulitzer Prize winning rapper's ability to put on a show.\n\nHe started with \"GNX\" moving into \"Squabble Up.\" For just under 13 minutes during the halftime show sponsored by Apple Music and Roc Nation, Lamar commanded the field.\n\nDancers dressed in red, white and blue joined Lamar. But even in their patriotic colors, they were labeled \"too loud, too reckless, too ghetto,\" by Jackson's Uncle Sam, who reminded Lamar to \"play the game.\" Then, he launched into \"Humble.,\" \"DNA.,\" \"Euphoria\" and \"man at the garden.\"\n\n\"Score keeper, deduct one life,\" Jackson interrupted again. Lamar launched into \"peakboo,\" and then teased a performance of \"Not Like Us.\"\n\n\"I wanna play their favorite song but you know they love to sue,\" Lamar told the women dancers behind him, referencing Drake.\n\nIt is hard to underscore the ubiquity of \"Not Like Us\" - with its billion streams on Spotify, the massive hit is a regional anthem for Los Angeles, a rallying cry for community and against culture vultures, a diss track that won Lamar the highly-publicized feud with Drake and the track that won song and record of the year at the Grammys last weekend.\n\nLeading up to the Super Bowl, whether or not Lamar would perform the song was a legitimate question held by fans and critics alike. Lamar levels strong accusations against Drake in its lyrics; Drake has sued Universal Music Group for defamation as a result of the song's popularity. Does a Super Bowl performance further complicate things?\n\nLittle was known about Lamar's halftime performance ahead of time. Lamar promised to keep his passion for storytelling at the forefront of his plans, and SZA was a previously announced guest performer. They are frequent collaborators; she most recently appeared in his recent album \"GNX\" and was featured on a couple songs including \"Gloria\" and \"Luther,\" which also features sampled vocals from Luther Vandross and Cheryl Lynn through \"If This World Were Mine.\" The duo will also co-headline a 19-city North American tour this spring and summer.\n\nSZA appeared on stage for \"Luther\" and \"All the Stars.\"\n\n\"That's what America wants - nice and calm,\" Jackson said.\n\nAnd then, like clockwork: Lamar launched into \"Not Like Us\" - with the removal of the word \"pedophiles\" in its lyrics - into \"tv off.\"\n\nHe brought out the producer Mustard and tennis superstar Serena Williams was spotted crip walking along to the diss track.\n\nIs there any better publicity than the biggest stage in U.S. sports? Consider this just another step in Lamar's continued victory lap.\n\nHe is also no stranger to the Super Bowl stage, having previously performed at the NFL's championship game in 2022 as a guest artist, alongside Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg, Mary J. Blige, 50 Cent and Eminem.\n\n\"Rap music is still the most impactful genre to date,\" Lamar said in a statement in September, when he was first announced as the 2025 halftime performer. \"And I'll be there to remind the world why. They got the right one.\"\n\nMake no mistake about it - that's exactly what he did Sunday evening.",

Want to go on a date with Dave? Message him here,'\" says Kline. He thought a few people would message the Instagram account @Date_Dave_Philly. Instead, it went viral.\n\n\"I was getting messages like, 'Hey, you've reached France, Germany, Brazil, Africa, Canada - everywhere!\" he said.\n\nHe's already received thousands of direct messages, some sending words of encouragement and praising him for putting himself out there, and others asking him out on a date.\n\nHe spent over $1,000 to put up the billboard for one month, which turned into two due to the billboard's lackluster location.\n\nWhile Dave is still single, he says he hasn't given up hope and is still working on finding love.\n\nHis main takeaway from this experience? Just be yourself.\n\n\"I just kind of decided to stay true to myself, and that's what people really latched on to,\" he says. \"It was a good confidence boost.\"\n\nMostly, he just liked the idea of being on a billboard and thought it would be funny. He does say the date requests rolling in have turned out to be a big bonus.",

        "fullContent": "Getting rid of the penny could mean the need for more nickels, which costs even more money make\n\nIn 2024, the U.S. Mint reported that each coin costs around 3.7-cents to make and distribute.\n\nIn 2024, the U.S. Mint reported that each coin costs around 3.7-cents to make and distribute.\n\nIn 2024, the U.S. Mint reported that each coin costs around 3.7-cents to make and distribute.\n\nIn 2024, the U.S. Mint reported that each coin costs around 3.7-cents to make and distribute.\n\nWASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump says he has ordered the US Mint to stop making pennies, which he correctly says cost more than one cent to produce.\n\n\"For far too long the United States has minted pennies which literally cost us more than 2 cents. This is so wasteful!\" he said in a post on his Truth Social platform. \"Let's rip the waste out of our great nations budget, even if it's a penny at a time.\"\n\nTrump actually undersold the cost argument - pennies cost more than 3 cents to produce.\n\nBut there's a problem with his plan: Phasing out the penny could result in needing to make more nickels, and the US Treasury Department loses far more money on every nickel than it does on every penny.\n\n\"Without the penny, the volume of nickels in circulation would have to rise to fill the gap in small-value transactions. Far from saving money, eliminating the penny shifts and amplifies the financial burden,\" said American for Common Cents, a pro-penny group funded primarily by Artazn, the company that has the contract to provide the blanks used to make pennies.\n\nAccording to the latest annual report from the US Mint, each penny cost 3.7 cents to make, including the 3 cents for production costs, and 0.7 cents per coin for administrative and distribution costs. But each nickel costs 13.8 cents, with 11 cents of production costs and 2.8 cents of administrative and distribution costs. These figures are for the government's fiscal year, which ends on September.\n\nDuring that fiscal year, the Mint tried to cut those losses by making far fewer nickels - only 202 million, down 86% from the 1.4 billion nickels it minted in each of the two previous years. That's also far less than the 3.2 billon pennies it made in 2024 and the 4.1 billion it made in 2023 and 5.4 billion it made in 2022.\n\nEven if the Mint has to make only 850,000 additional nickels in 2025 to meet demand from retailers, that would wipe out the savings of eliminating the penny. If goes back up to making 1.4 million nickels a year, that would cost $78 million more than the cost of pennies it is no longer making.\n\nThe Mint would likely have to make more than that - probably in the range of 2 million to 2.5 million nickels a year if it stops making pennies permanently, said Mark Weller, executive director of the Americans for Common Cents, based on the track record in other countries that dropped their lowest valued currency.\n\n\"In most countries, the lowest domination coin is the most minted coin,\" he said.\n\nThe price of making pennies has been relative steady in recent years, while the cost of producing nickels has been climbing, rising about 20% since 2022, because of the difference in the cost of raw materials.\n\nNickels made of 75% copper and 25% nickel, while pennies, despite their reputation of being a copper coin are copper-plated zinc, meaning they are only 2.5% copper and 97.5% zinc.\n\nWhile all metal prices can be volatile, zinc prices are essentially where they were in late 2016, while copper and nickel prices are roughly double the price they were then.\n\nWhy ditching the penny may still make sense\n\nStill, there are arguments for dumping the penny, no matter the costs.\n\nThe National Association of Convenience Stores has in the past agreed with the idea of getting rid of the penny to speed transaction time, even if only by a second or two for each customer paying with cash.\n\n\"Convenience stores sell a lot of products, but what they really sell is speed of service,\" said Jeff Lenard, spokesman for the group. He couldn't say if nickel usage would increase, but he did say that without the penny that cash transactions would be rounded to the nearest nickel.\n\nAnd the United States wouldn't be the first to dump its least valuable coin. Canada stopped minting their pennies in 2012 and stopped using them in 2013.\n\nWeller doesn't dispute that Trump can order Treasury to stop making the penny. It stopped making the dollar coin for general circulation in 2011 due to lack of demand. But to stop the use of pennies already in circulation would take an act of Congress. And that would require the federal government to buy back the already-issued pennies, which turned out to be more expensive than anticipated proposition in Canada, Americans for Common Cents' Weller said.\n\nWhile gumball machines, parking meters, toll booths and even vending machines once accepted pennies, few will accept the pennies today.\n\nOne reason that the government has to make so many pennies every year is a large percentage of them don't remain in circulation. They are stashed in penny jars or junk drawers at home. Or they fall on the ground and people don't even bother to pick them up.\n\nMany people leave behind the pennies they get as change in leave-a-coin-take-a-coin dishes on counters of many retailers. Those dishes are increasingly holding nickels as well, which also have few uses.\n\n\"When people start leaving a monetary unit at the cash register for the next customer, the unit is too small to be useful,\" said Gregory Mankiw, a Harvard economics professor and former chairman of the President's Council of Economic Advisers under President George W. Bush.\n\n(The-CNN-Wire & 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company. All rights reserved.)",

The Chiefs were chasing a historic three-peat, and the Eagles vying for revenge. It was the Birds who filled their plate and finished every last crumb in one of the most dominant wins in Super Bowl history.\n\nNobody quite imagined the game would play out quite like this. A defensive masterclass from Vic Fangio‚Äôs troops that included a beautiful pick 6 for birthday boy Cooper DeJean helped completely silence Patrick Mahomes and the Kansas City Chiefs, holding them scoreless through most of the second half.\n\nFeb 9, 2025; New Orleans, LA, USA; Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Jalen Hurts (1) throws a pass against the Kansas City Chiefs in the second quarter in Super Bowl LIX at Ceasars Superdome. Mandatory Credit: Mark J. Rebilas-Imagn Images\n\nThe pass-rush, rejuivinated by the returning Brandon Graham, was on an absolute mission, terrorizing Mahomes and pressuring him on close to 50% of his dropbacks, bringing him down 6 times. All of this despite never sending a single blitz. To get that level of production without ever using an extra pass-rusher is unheard of, but Philadelphia made it possible on the biggest stage of them all.\n\nJosh Sweat led the Birds with 2.5 sacks on the night, but it was a real committee effort, with Jalyx Hunt, Milton Williams, and Jordan Davis all getting in on the action.\n\nOn offense, we were given another strong reminder as to just how good Jalen Hurts really is. On a night where Saquon Barkley was largely suffocated by the Chiefs, it was the Philadelphia quarterback who pushed his team into the endzone 3 times (2 passing touchdown, 1 rushing) and accounting for over 220 passing yards in total.\n\nA rogue interception did occur early in the game, but Hurts remained surgical and unafraid to launch deep balls to the likes of A.J Brown and DeVonta Smith, reinforcing what we already knew. Jalen Hurts is the franchise quarterback fans have been pining for, and that this offense can hurt you in multiple ways.\n\nIt‚Äôs all well and good keeping Saquon Barkley quiet, but can you keep Smitty, Brown, and the supporting cast of receivers out of the endzone? Kansas City struggled just as Washington did in the NFC Championship game, and it led to one of the most complete performances we have ever seen from a Philadelphia team.\n\nThe scary part for the rest of the NFL is just how much better this team could become over the next few years. Cooper DeJean, Quinyon Mitchell, Jalyx Hunt, Jalen Carter, Jordan Davis, Nolan Smith‚Ä¶ALL on rookie contracts.\n\nJalen Hurts, A.J Brown, DeVonta Smith, Saquon Barkley and a stacked offensive line‚Ä¶ALL in Philadelphia for the long-term. We can get excited about the future another time, but as of today, there‚Äôs one thing that matters.\n\nFeb 9, 2025; New Orleans, LA, USA; Philadelphia Eagles running back Saquon Barkley (26) runs the ball against the Kansas City Chiefs in Super Bowl LIX at Ceasars Superdome.

Nick Sirianni, who many fans wanted out of the City following a terrible loss to Tampa Bay earlier in the season, is a World champion. Saquon Barkley, who was shockingly let go by the Giants, is a World Champion. The City of Philadelphia is World Champions once again.\n\nREUTERS/Mike Segar",

        "fullContent": "Sign up for our email newsletter to stay up-to-date on the latest local sports news throughout Philadelphia.\n\nThe Philadelphia Eagles are set to take on the Kansas City Chiefs in the ultimate rematch for more than just bragging rights. The teams split the last two matchups although the Chiefs got the better half as they were able to raise the Lombardi Trophy. This time around things are different. The Chiefs are chasing the NFL‚Äôs first three-peat while the Eagles are looking to start their own dynasty on the back of a talented roster.\n\nOur Eagles team took it upon themselves to offer you their predictions on the big game and what to expect from the big Super Bowl LIX matchup.\n\nBryan Cameron\n\nThere‚Äôs something truly special about this team. I don‚Äôt mean it sentimentally either. This is probably the most complete roster in the NFL and it hasn‚Äôt been acknowledged. What makes this team even more special is the level of maturity from top to bottom. This isn‚Äôt a group of players that are just happy to be here, this is a team that is expected to be here and understand that the job is not done yet.\n\nI‚Äôm fully bought into the idea that this season was managed from a very strategic vantage point on offense. We never got to see Jalen Hurts unleashed until the NFC championship game although we saw a little glimpse of their potential on offense when he picked apart the Steelers‚Äô defense for 290 passing yards and two passing touchdowns.\n\nHurts is a big game player. He‚Äôs well aware of what‚Äôs at stake and what this means for his career and his legacy. Saquon Barkley is very identical to Hurts in this manner. Barkley has that look on his face of pure determination which is why I believe that the Eagles will defeat the Chiefs. I believe that they will do it in a very convincing manner with a late go-ahead touchdown score to ice the game. The Chiefs‚Äô quest for the three-peat may have started by defeating the Eagles in Super Bowl LVII but it won‚Äôt end that way on Sunday.\n\nEagles 34 ‚Äì Chiefs 21\n\nDavid Neisz\n\nThe Eagles‚Äô defense was the best in the NFL this season, and that will not change in New Orleans. The Chiefs have struggled to put up big points against lesser defenses, and the Birds will prove to be too tough a foe. Jalen Carter is a game-wrecker and will be a household name after they win the Super Bowl. The offense will be able to effectively move the ball via the air when the Chiefs load the box to stop Saquon, and Hurts will use routes outside of the numbers to the side to expose Kansas City‚Äôs issues defending those pass plays.\n\nThey were 3rd worst in the league defending out routes. When the Chiefs get sick of that, they will keep a safety high to help, and then Barkley will feast. Jalen Hurts will also have his number called in the run game as KC allows the highest amount of 3rd down scrambles in the NFL. The Eagles win 33-19, and the last 6 points come off a late touchdown. The Birds will dominate this rematch and win their second Lombardi Trophy! See you guys on Broad Street after the game and for the parade.\n\nJan 26, 2025; Philadelphia, PA, USA; Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Jalen Hurts (1) reacts after a touchdown against the Washington Commanders during the second half in the NFC Championship game at Lincoln Financial Field. Mandatory Credit: Eric Hartline-Imagn Images\n\nMike Greger\n\nThe Eagles get the ultimate revenge by flip-flopping the final score from the 2022 Super Bowl, only this time it is Jalen Hurts leading the game-winning drive that results in a chip shot field goal for Jake ‚ÄúThe Make‚Äù Elliott. You cannot give Patrick Mahomes the ball back with a chance to win in the closing minutes. You just can‚Äôt do it. And Vic Fangio won‚Äôt do it, with Cooper DeJean coming up with a huge interception ‚Äî his first career interception, actually ‚Äî on a ball over the middle meant for Travis Kelce.\n\nSaquon Barkley walks away with Super Bowl MVP honors, thus ending the greatest year for a running back (or any position player) in NFL history. He breaks Terrell Davis‚Äô single-season rushing record (playoffs and regular season) while rushing for more than 100 yards in this one, plus Barkley delivers a video-game ankle-breaker that sets up the game-winning field goal.\n\nHow do the Eagles beat the Chiefs? By eluding the blitz and by taking advantage of it. Steve Spagnuolo is the master ‚Äî the Chiefs sent a fifth pass rusher on 35.6% of dropbacks in 2024, generating pressure on 43.8% of those blitzes, including 42.2% on third and fourth downs ‚Äî so look for Kellen Moore to exploit the screen game and dump the ball off to Barkley and Dallas Goedert at a high rate. That‚Äôs the key to another boisterous parade down Broad Street. Which will happen.\n\nSignificant stat: Jalen Hurts completed 66.1% of his passes (74 of 112) for 945 yards with nine touchdowns against only one interception against the blitz in 2024. His 115.4 passer rating was sixth-best in the NFL.\n\nEagles 38, Chiefs 35\n\nAnthony DiBona\n\nThe big game is finally here as the Eagles will have their chance at revenge against the Chiefs in Super Bowl LIX. Sunday‚Äôs game will be the battle of streaks as there are several trends heading into the matchup. While Patrick Mahomes is 8-0 in his NFL career against Vic Fangio, the Eagles are 11-0 in games that Jalen Hurts, A.J. Brown, and DeVonta Smith have started in and completed this season.\n\nIn Fangio‚Äôs previous matchups against Mahomes, his teams lacked the offensive firepower that the Eagles currently have. The Chiefs have struggled to slow down starting running backs in their first two games of the postseason and Saquon Barkley could be in line for a huge performance in Super Bowl LIX. Despite the Chiefs seeking their third consecutive Super Bowl victory, the Eagles are simply the more talented team and should win if they can avoid making costly mistakes.\n\nEagles 28, Chiefs 17\n\nCory Nidoh\n\nThis year has a different feel to it as the Eagles look to win their second Super Bowl in franchise history. A sense of confidence and determination has been prevalent from both the team and players themselves and the passionate fan base in the Greater Delaware Valley.\n\nThose feelings can easily be validated because of what we have seen from this Eagles team. A well-balanced offense led by a superstar running back who had an MVP-caliber season. A quarterback who only cares about winning and has played smart and clean football. An exciting defense with a wonderful mix of veterans and rookies who have been stout all season. All of this makes for a great recipe for the Eagles who take on a Chiefs team that although lost just two games, one being a game where they rested starters, is not as dominant or explosive as in years past.\n\nThis will be a close game and I have a hard time agreeing with those who say the Eagles will win by 10 or more. However, I do think the Eagles win a close one, but they dominate in most facets of the game. I think the Eagles‚Äô defense presents many challenges for this Chiefs offense that needs to move the ball methodically down the field and I don‚Äôt think the Chiefs will suddenly crack the code on how to stop Barkley. Eagles take care of business and bring the Lombardi back to Philly with a 30-24 victory. Barkley takes home the MVP with a pair of rushing touchdowns including one late to seal the win.\n\nFeb 6, 2025; New Orleans, LA, USA; Philadelphia Eagles running back Saquon Barkley (26) during a press conference in advance of Super Bowl LIX at New Orleans Marriott. Mandatory Credit: Stephen Lew-Imagn Images\n\nChris Babos\n\nThe Philadelphia Eagles will deny the Kansas City Chiefs their much desired third straight Lombardi Trophy with a 34-21 win at Super Bowl LIX in New Orleans. In a reverse of the NFL Title game in 2022, the Eagles will find themselves trailing by a small margin at halftime, but a key second-half turnover swings the game in Philly‚Äôs favor. The Chiefs cannot keep Saquon Barkley below the century mark in the game as the Eagles running back becomes the first 2,500-yard rusher in NFL history. Brandon Graham makes another clutch second-half play that ends up sinking Kansas City‚Äôs ‚Äúthree-peat‚Äù dreams, just like he did against New England at Super Bowl LII.\n\nJalen Hurts earns his redemption over Patrick Mahomes with a Super Bowl MVP performance featuring at least one rushing TD and two passing scores in the win and can change his phone lock screen to himself proudly raising a shiny, silver Lombardi Trophy in NOLA as green and white confetti rains down on the Eagles players. The game‚Äôs final score adds up to 55 ‚Äì a fitting send-off for an Eagles legend (Graham) who helped deliver a pair of World Championships to the City of Brotherly Love after a 13-point victory at Super Bowl LIX.\n\nLiam Jenkins\n\nThe Eagles have come a long way since that gut-wrenching loss against the Chiefs two years ago. While Miles Sanders was sloppy in the affair and it took a Jalen Hurts masterclass to overcome a lack of rushing stability and some poor defense, this roster is now filled top-to-bottom with playmakers. Stopping Saquon is one thing, scoring on this dominant defense is something else entirely.\n\nI think this will be a tighter game than people are assuming, but the Eagles‚Äô defense comes up big and thwarts Patrick Mahomes and company, getting some overdue revenge in a 28-21 win.\n\nMandatory Credit: Bill Streicher-Imagn Images",

So I‚Äôm happy. I‚Äôm happy with everybody‚Ä¶ We‚Äôve done a great job defensively of coming together each and every game. We know that‚Äôs our common denominator and I‚Äôm proud of this. [UConn] was a hell of a win for us. Marquette was a hell of a win.‚Äù\n\nWhile St. John‚Äôs is allowing an average of just 65 points per game (28th in the nation), RJ Luis carried the Queens school‚Äôs attack, garnering Big East Player of the Week by averaging 19 points, nine rebounds, and two steals per game.\n\nThe Red Storm return to action on Wednesday at Villanova before returning to Madison Square Garden on Sunday for a massive tilt against No. 24/21 Creighton.\n\nFor more on St. John‚Äôs, visit AMNY.com",

The exhibition will display two decades of messages ‚Äì a selection of the nearly 5,000 postcards in Oring‚Äôs archive ‚Äì from people in Philadelphia and across the country, offering visitors a poignant reflection on the evolving hopes, fears, and expectations of the nation.\n\nSince 2004, Oring has transformed parks, libraries, schools, and streets into makeshift offices. Dressed as a 1960s secretary, she invites people to dictate messages to the president, which she types verbatim on postcards using a vintage typewriter. Participants are photographed with a Polaroid camera and each postcard is typed using carbon paper to create two copies. One copy is sent to the White House, while the other is added to Oring‚Äôs archive. Oring was at the Parkway Central Library during November‚Äôs Election Day and several of the responses from local Philadelphia residents will be featured in the exhibit.\n\n‚ÄúSecretary to the People brings civic dialogue directly to public spaces like our own public library,‚Äù said Suzanna Urminska, Curator of Exhibitions at The Free Library of Philadelphia. ‚ÄúThis collaboration between artist and library shows how both art and libraries can further civic discussion, engagement, and democracy.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúIt was in Philadelphia that free expression and other fundamental rights were enshrined in our Constitution. Now, in this exhibition, visitors can see how that essential freedom lives on through two decades of people speaking their minds to our presidents,‚Äù adds Oring. ‚ÄúEach postcard is a testament to the enduring spirit of civic engagement in the city where American democracy was born.‚Äù\n\nSecretary to the People will be open to the public at the Parkway Central branch of The Free Library of Philadelphia, at 1901 Vine Street, during regular library hours.

        "fullContent": "Sign up for our email newsletter to stay up-to-date on the latest local sports news throughout Philadelphia.\n\nThe Philadelphia Flyers snapped a five-game losing streak with a 3-2 win over the Pittsburgh Penguins on Saturday night. Travis Konecny‚Äôs game-winner in the third period earned the Flyers a tight victory whileSam Ersson‚Äôs heroic efforts thwarted Pittsburgh‚Äôs offensive attack with 32 saves. ‚ÄúYou always want to leave with a win,‚Äù Tortorella said postgame. ‚ÄúCertainly, a different kind of game for us, but it‚Äôs a win.‚Äù\n\nNew Flyers forward Andrei Kuzmenko picked up an assist in his debut. Jakob Pelletier, the other forward acquired by the Flyers in the Morgan Frost/Joel Farabee trade, was unavailable due to paperwork issues Philadelphia is still navigating. Pittsburgh entered the game without some star power, as well. Sidney Crosby and Bryan Rust, two of their three leading scorers on the season, did not participate in the game on Saturday night.\n\nFlyers Net Only Goal of First Period\n\nThings started with a bang for Philadelphia in the first period. On their opening shift of the game, Flyers forward Scott Laughton scored a backhand goal past Penguins goalie Joel Blomqvist for the game‚Äôs opening goal. Andrei Kuzmenko started the play in his own zone and earned a point on his first Flyers shift for his effort. ‚ÄúVery talented, you can see his skill,‚Äù Tortorella described Kuzmenko. ‚ÄúHas an enthusiasm about him. He can do some things with the puck. It was a good first game for him.‚Äù\n\nPittsburgh responded well to Philly‚Äôs opening tally with a tight forechecking effort that dominated the rest of the period. The Penguins outshot the Flyers 10-1 over 17 minutes. The shot attempts that were blocked or missed the net painted a far worse picture. Pittsburgh fired 36 shot attempts at the Flyers goal compared to just five total shot opportunities for Philly. Flyers Goalie Sam Ersson made several critical saves in the first period, including a stick save with the Flyers on the penalty kill late to retain the 1-0 advantage heading into the break.\n\nFlyers-Pens Split Second Frame\n\nThe Flyers conceded the opening score of the frame to Pittsburgh‚Äôs Erik Karlsson on a snipe from the right face-off circle that went sailing above Ersson‚Äôs shoulder and into the Flyers‚Äô net to tie the game at one. Pittsburgh‚Äôs passing allowed the 3x Norris Trophy winner to take a wide-open shot from a sharp angle on the Flyers goalie. It was Karlsson‚Äôs 6th goal of the season and the 194th goal celebration of his career.\n\nThe Penguins continued to pressure against the Flyers in the second period, but the Flyers untied the game on a fortunate bounce midway through the period. Garnet Hathaway‚Äôs speed burst toward a loose puck forced Pittsburgh‚Äôs goalie to dash from his crease to clear the puck. In doing so, Blomqvist‚Äôs pass collided with the charging Flyers forward, and the resulting ricochet sent the puck into the unguarded Penguins net for a 2-1 Flyers lead. Once again, despite being outplayed in the period, Philadelphia held the lead at the second intermission.\n\nErsson Denies Penguins in Third Period\n\nWithin the first 90 seconds of the third period, Pittsburgh threatened to tie the game, but Sam Ersson‚Äôs sprawling save kept Philly‚Äôs slim lead intact. With a delayed penalty man advantage upcoming against Pittsburgh, the Flyers slipped Travis Konecny onto the ice as the extra skater. Defenseman Cam York feathered a pass across the blueline that Konecny one-time through traffic that deflected off a Penguins forward and past Blomqvist for a 3-1 Philadelphia lead four and half minutes into the period.\n\nA little more than a minute later, Penguins center Kevin Hayes was initially denied by a fantastic pad save from the Flyers goalie as he moved laterally following a loose puck. However, the former Flyers forward stuck with the play, ultimately locating the loose puck in the crease and pushing it across the thin red line. The referee initially blew the play dead with a ruling of no goal, but Pittsburgh coach Mike Sullivan challenged the play, resulting in an overturned decision and a good Penguins goal slicing the lead in half, 3-2. It was Hayes‚Äô 10th of the season in his debut season with Pittsburgh.\n\nFeb 8, 2025; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA; Pittsburgh Penguins left wing Michael Bunting (8) pushes the puck past Philadelphia Flyers defenseman Travis Sanheim (6) in the third period at Wells Fargo Center. Mandatory Credit: Kyle Ross-Imagn Images\n\nErsson held the Penguins at bay over the last 10 minutes, earning first-star honors on Saturday. ‚ÄúHe made some incredible saves,‚Äù the Tortorella described Ersson‚Äôs performance. ‚ÄúWe were out-chanced pretty good.‚Äù With 25 games remaining after the two-week NHL hiatus, Ersson is expected to receive many of the starts down the stretch for the Flyers.\n\nLaughton and Kuzmenko were selected as the second and third stars of the game, respectively. Philly improved to 24-26-7 on the year and settled into a seventh-place tie in the Metropolitain division with the Penguins (23-25-9) at 55 points at the break.\n\nScheduled NHL Break Brings International Tournament Next Week\n\nMost of Philadelphia‚Äôs roster gets a mid-season vacation as the NHL breaks for two weeks. Flyers Head Coach John Tortorella (USA), Travis Konecny and Travis Sanheim (Canada), Sam Ersson (Sweden), and Rasmus Ristolainen (Finland) will head off to the NHL-sponsored international tournament, the 4 Nations Face-Off. The event will start in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, before shifting to Boston, Massachusetts, for the Finals on February 20.\n\nThe Flyers‚Äô next game will be at home on February 22nd when they host Connor McDavid and the Edmonton Oilers for an afternoon contest in South Philadelphia.\n\nMandatory Credit: Kyle Ross-Imagn Images",

Mandatory Credit: Jeff Hanisch-Imagn Images\n\nSign up for our email newsletter to stay up-to-date on the latest local sports news throughout Philadelphia.\n\nDon‚Äôt let the final score fool you.\n\nThe Sixers and Bucks faced off in Milwaukee on Sunday, Feb. 9. While the final score would have one think the game was competitive, the level of play between the two teams in the second half could not have been greater. Despite initially holding their own against the Bucks, albeit without Giannis Antetokounmpo, the Sixers‚Äô defensive inability outlasted their offensive prowess, ultimately giving Milwaukee an easy win.\n\nWhat worked for the Sixers\n\nThe Sixers did well to keep pace with the Bucks through the first two quarters. Scoring 63 first-half points, both Tyrese Maxey and Joel Embiid held down the scoring load early on en route to their combined 66-point performance.\n\nFeb 9, 2025; Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA; Philadelphia 76ers guard Tyrese Maxey (0) shoot against Milwaukee Bucks guard Damian Lillard (0) during the second quarter at Fiserv Forum. Mandatory Credit: Jeff Hanisch-Imagn Images\n\nMaxey continues to thrive, once again scoring 27-plus points, his 18th straight game with as many points, while Joel Embiid was electric offensively from the start of the game. The Maxey‚ÄîEmbiid connection is as good as ever despite the missed time, and their chemistry will go a long way toward righting this ship sooner rather than later.\n\nOne more small success was the debut of guard Jared Butler. The Sixers acquired Butler in a deal that sent Reggie Jackson to the Washinton Wizards and swapped some draft assets. For Philadelphia, it was an opportunity to get younger and better at the lead guard position, though Butler, who is on a two-way contract, still needs some guidance to unlock his potential.\n\nFeb 9, 2025; Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA; Philadelphia 76ers guard Jared Butler (12) shoots during the second quarter against the Milwaukee Bucks at Fiserv Forum. Mandatory Credit: Jeff Hanisch-Imagn Images\n\nFellow new Sixer Quentin Grimes was also mostly effective in this game, though he wasn‚Äôt nearly as efficient as the Sixers would like. Still, Grimes found ways, in addition to his outside shot, to serve the team, finishing with a total of 10 points, seven rebounds, and five assists.\n\nWhat didn‚Äôt\n\nIn a word, defense.\n\nAs has been the case for much of this season, the Sixers couldn‚Äôt stop a bucket from range.\n\nFeb 9, 2025; Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA; Philadelphia 76ers center Joel Embiid (21) shoots over Milwaukee Bucks forward Bobby Portis (9) during the second quarter at Fiserv Forum. Mandatory Credit: Jeff Hanisch-Imagn Images\n\nThe Milwaukee Bucks knocked down an incredible 24 shots from beyond the arc. Without Giannis on the court, they quickly pivoted to an arrival attack and saw tremendous success against a Sixers team that has struggled to defend the three all season.\n\nNick Nurse, known as a defensive tactician, continues to roll out undersized three-guard lineups. In this game, opting for Jared Butler, Kyle Lowry, and Eric Gordon at the same time. The size component isn‚Äôt the only factor in the team‚Äôs terrible defense, but it‚Äôs the factor that remains in Nurse‚Äôs hands, the easiest for him to impact and improve.\n\nUltimately, the team must decide if they are interested in defending, but the Sixers have done themselves no favors in that department.\n\nUp next for the Sixers\n\nPhiladelphia will take the court next Tuesday as they face the Toronto Raptors at home.

In turn, Hurts and the Eagles will be welcomed back to the City of Brotherly Love with a hero‚Äôs welcome down Broad Street Friday afternoon.\n\nIn typical Hurts fashion, he didn‚Äôt get emotional and it‚Äôs clear the man only wants to do is win.\n\n‚ÄúWhen it‚Äôs all said and done for me, I won‚Äôt measure myself off any numbers or stats, passing yards or touchdowns. I measure it off of rings and championships. That‚Äôs how I look at it.‚Äù\n\nWell, he earned his first ring as a pro and he once again shined when the lights were the brightest. Hurts was efficient and aside from an under-thrown pass when he was pressured that was intercepted, Hurts played a near flawless game to join Nick Foles as the only Super Bowl MVP‚Äôs in franchise history.\n\nFeb 9, 2025; New Orleans, LA, USA; Philadelphia Eagles running back Saquon Barkley (26) runs the ball against the Kansas City Chiefs in Super Bowl LIX at Ceasars Superdome. Mandatory Credit: Mark J. Rebilas-Imagn Images\n\nIt was clear Kansas City wanted to take away Saquon Barkley and force Hurts to win the game with his arm and legs and once again outplayed the league‚Äôs poster child in Patrick Mahomes. Hurts completed 17 of his 22 passes, threw for a pair of touchdowns, including this perfect deep ball to DeVonta Smith while adding a touchdown thanks to the ‚ÄúBrotherly Shove‚Äù. He also ran for 72 yards, a new Super Bowl record, breaking his own mark he set two years ago in the loss to the Chiefs.\n\nHurts made sure to show gratitude to the defense who showed why that unit was ranked as the best in the NFL this season.\n\n‚ÄúThe old clich√© defense wins championships,‚Äù Hurts said. ‚ÄúBut the way they‚Äôve been able to play all year with young guys coming in, flying in and making huge plays, I couldn‚Äôt be prouder of them.‚Äù\n\nNick Sirianni echoed the same sentiments and praised defensive coordinator Vic Fangio who transformed this defense into perhaps the best in franchise history.\n\n‚ÄúVic Fangio is one of the best defensive coordinators in the league and might have cemented that he is the best of all time after last night,‚Äù Sirianni said.\n\nFootball ‚Äì NFL ‚Äì Super Bowl LIX ‚Äì Philadelphia Eagles v Kansas City Chiefs ‚Äì Caesars Superdome, New Orleans, Louisiana, United States ‚Äì February 9, 2025 Kansas City Chiefs‚Äô Patrick Mahomes is hit in the face by Philadelphia Eagles‚Äô Jalen Carter as the ball is loose REUTERS/Brian Snyder\n\nThe defense was sensational. Mahomes was sacked six times while the Eagles only rushed four men all game long, allowing seven players to drop back in coverage, making it near impossible for Mahomes to do anything offensively. The Eagles held Mahomes to 257 yards and picked him off twice, including a pick six by Cooper DeJean on his birthday. The three touchdowns Mahomes threw were in garbage time, when the game was well out of reach.\n\nIt was apparent that this team became close over the course of the season, especially after the disappointing 2-2 start. Sirianni alluded to last year‚Äôs disastrous tailspin that derailed the season as a reason why this team was able to rattle of 16 wins over their final 17 games.\n\n‚ÄúWhen I looked back at last year and as crazy as this sounds, I‚Äôm grateful for last year because it shaped us to who we are this year. When you embrace adversity, it does something to you personally.‚Äù\n\nBoth Hurts and Sirianni mentioned the journey and how instrumental it was for this team to win the Lombardi Trophy after they felt they let it slip away in 2022.\n\n‚ÄúThe journey of mine has been unprecedented,‚Äù Hurts reflected on his career to this point. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt dream of these moments. It was more so the work and determination to be the best I can be.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt know how close a team will be until you go through the journey together,‚Äù Sirianni said. ‚ÄúWhen you embrace adversity, it does something to you personally. They would put phones down and do stuff together, that was key. You can‚Äôt substitute the time they‚Äôve spent together with dinners and in the game room.‚Äú\n\nAlthough Hurts said that this team ‚Äúhasn‚Äôt arrived‚Äù from their journey, the quarterback and the Eagles will make a euphoric pit stop. A stop to Broad Street with an entire city electrified with pure enthusiasm, admiration and appreciation for arguably the best team in franchise history.\n\n‚ÄúBringing a championship back to Philadelphia means everything,‚Äù Hurts said.\n\nCome Friday and beyond, hundreds of thousands of fans will be expressing what he and this team means to them.\n\nThe Eagles will host their Championship parade in Philadelphia on Friday, February 14th, 2025.\n\nMandatory Credit: Geoff Burke-Imagn Images",

        "fullContent": "Sign up for our email newsletter to stay up-to-date on the latest local sports news throughout Philadelphia.\n\nThe Philadelphia Eagles are Super Bowl Champions once again, and as the dust settles in New Orleans and the parties rage on Broad Street, it‚Äôs time to look back a truly remarkable night.\n\nIt‚Äôs time to put some respect on Jalen Hurts‚Äò name\n\nAfter a year of hearing nothing but criticism and disrespect, Jalen Hurts put together a stellar performance under the brightest lights. Not that this should shock anyone given how he‚Äôs consistently done so in the postseason and came heartbreakingly close to dethroning the Chiefs two years ago, but last night felt personal.\n\nAll we‚Äôve heard all year is how Hurts can‚Äôt pass, he‚Äôs regressing, and how he needs to sling it deep more. How he isn‚Äôt on the level of Patrick Mahomes, Lamar Jackson, Josh Allen, or Joe Burrow. How he‚Äôs unable to take advantage of one of the best offenses in the NFL.\n\nJalen Hurts is a Super Bowl Champion and a Super Bowl MVP. Per TruMedia, he actually achieved the highest EPA per dropback in the Super Bowl since since 2000, reminding us of those very important words he spoke not too long ago.\n\nJust because he doesn‚Äôt, it doesn‚Äôt mean he can‚Äôt.\n\nHurts was everything the Eagles needed him to be last night, and while revenge is a dish best served cold, this one came piping hot. If there is ever time for a Jalen Hurts apology tour from the national media, it‚Äôs on Monday morning after watching him calmly guiding his team down the field over and over again, never getting lost in the moment, and instead becoming the moment.\n\nVic Fangio deserves his flowers\n\nAs much as Saquon Barkley‚Äòs addition this offseason might go down as one of the best in history, Vic Fangio‚Äôs arrival as defensive coordinator was arguably just as important. After two years of failed experiments from coordinators running phantom versions of Vic‚Äôs scheme, the grandfather of it all came to implement it himself, and boy was that the right decision.\n\nFootball ‚Äì NFL ‚Äì Super Bowl LIX ‚Äì Philadelphia Eagles v Kansas City Chiefs ‚Äì Caesars Superdome, New Orleans, Louisiana, United States ‚Äì February 9, 2025 Philadelphia Eagles‚Äô C.J. Gardner-Johnson celebrates during the game REUTERS/Mike Segar\n\nDespite his Miami tenure ending in bizarre fashion, Fangio found himself in a locker room filled with the right kind of players both physically and mentally to execute his scheme flawlessly. Best defense in the NFL? Somehow that‚Äôs an understatement after watching them terrorize Patrick Mahomes for 4 quarters, pressuring him on over 50% of his dropbacks without ever sending a SINGLE blitz.\n\nIt was a defensive masterclass. Fangio had his troops playing the best football of their lives under the biggest spotlight, and he deserves every bit of praise coming his way.\n\nThe Philadelphia Eagles: Beginning of a dynasty?\n\nLet me put this into perspective for a minute.\n\nJalen Carter, Jordan Davis, Nolan Smith, Cooper DeJean, Quinyon Mitchell, Jalyx Hunt? All of them are on rookie contracts.\n\nJalen Hurts, A.J Brown, DeVonta Smith, Saquon Barkley and near enough the entire offensive line? All of them are staying in Philadelphia for at least 3 more years.\n\nThe future is so, so bright. The Eagles brought the youngest defense in the NFL to the table this season and became the league‚Äôs most dominant. Nobody was able to find an answer for the offense. Stopping Saquon is one thing, but can you stop AJ, Smitty, Goedert, Hurts on the ground, and the rest of the supporting cast?\n\nFootball ‚Äì NFL ‚Äì Super Bowl LIX ‚Äì Philadelphia Eagles v Kansas City Chiefs ‚Äì Caesars Superdome, New Orleans, Louisiana, United States ‚Äì February 9, 2025 Philadelphia Eagles‚Äô C.J. Gardner-Johnson and Tyler Steen celebrate after winning Super Bowl LIX REUTERS/Mike Segar TPX IMAGES OF THE DAY\n\nThere is every chance this team goes on to repeat or at the very least becomes a perennial contender for years to come, and that is both exciting (for us) and terrifying (for every other team in the NFL).\n\nThe Eagles deserved it\n\nThe first Super Bowl win back in 2017 was for the City. It was a team of underdogs making their mark, proving that hungry dogs did indeed run faster and ending one of the most poignant championship droughts of all time.\n\nThis one? That was for the players. It was for Jalen Hurts. For Saquon. For DeVonta Smith who has now won a Heisman, a Natty, an Iron Bowl, and a Super Bowl. It was for Brandon Graham, who likely bows out as a two-time World Champion with the team that drafted him. It was for Nick Sirianni who had his head on a spike earlier in the season. For Chauncey Gardner-Johnson, for the players who endured the heartbreak of Super Bowl 57. For Lane Johnson, for Jordan Mailata, for Darius Slay. For Zack Baun.\n\nThis was such a special moment. A vindicating moment, and one that will likely cement a lot of the players we‚Äôve come to know and love as elite talents. Their careers from here on out will always be mentioned in the same breath as ending the Kansas City dynasty. Nobody can ever take that away from them, and that‚Äôs so beautiful.\n\nFeb 9, 2025; New Orleans, LA, USA; Philadelphia Eagles head coach Nick Sirianni reacts with linebacker Josh Sweat (19) during the fourth quarter against the Kansas City Chiefs in Super Bowl LIX at Caesars Superdome. Mandatory Credit: Kirby Lee-Imagn Images\n\nThe Eagles‚Äô dominance is a testament to Sirianni‚Äôs coaching ability\n\nNick Sirianni might be the most oft-criticized coach in all of Football, and I get it. His coaching style seems to wind up just about everyone. His emotions enrage opposing fans, and the fact he doesn‚Äôt call plays has confused many, leading to the questions of ‚Äòwhat does he even do?‚Äô.\n\nHe wins.\n\nWhen Chauncey Gardner-Johnson cried into his arms after the NFC Championship, that highlighted what Sirianni does so well.\n\nWhen A.J Brown embraced him, it highlighted exactly what it does so well.\n\nThe players are all-in on their Head Coach because he‚Äôs all-in on them.\n\nNothing exemplified that more than the very first drive of the game between the Eagles and Chiefs. 4th and short at the 50-yard line, and Sirianni sends his team out to go for it. The pass was complete, but of course rescinded due to a rogue flag. But Sirianni trusted his players and wanted to instil that sense of confidence early. It wasn‚Äôt the only time he‚Äôd do that, and in the biggest game against a juggernaut opponent, to double down on his guys was something so crucial to the belief that flowed its way through the team.\n\nYou can call the game of a lifetime, but it doesn‚Äôt matter if you lack the emotional intelligence needed to keep your players on the right track, and Sirianni showed exactly why the team kept him on after dismantling the rest of his staff just under one year ago.\n\nHe might not be everyone‚Äôs cup of tea, but he‚Äôs a Super Bowl Champion‚Ä¶and frankly that‚Äôs all that matters.\n\nThe Philadelphia Eagles are world champions. After a tough start to the year, they burst out of the bye week and never looked back‚Ä¶and you can‚Äôt do that without a Head Coach with the awareness to be exactly what the team needs.\n\nMandatory Credit: Geoff Burke-Imagn Images",

Mandatory Credit: Petre Thomas-Imagn Images\n\nThis is not only the first time the notion has been publically mentioned, but it is in contrast to what the team has consistently said throughout the season. If surgery is the answer, that is fine enough; what‚Äôs more troubling is the team‚Äôs insistence on playing Embiid through this season, despite that knowledge, and the fact that the team has not once acknowledged this potential outcome, which Embiid himself described as ‚Äúlikely.‚Äù\n\nOn Friday, Feb. 7, Sixers‚Äô president Daryl Morey addressed the media, and among the many questions asked about the disconnect between what‚Äôs being communicated publicly by the team around players‚Äô injury updates and the actual extent of those injuries.\n\n‚ÄúSo there have been those times where, sincerely, Joel himself, [the] medical staff, he looks every bunch on the way towards playing,‚Äù Morey said, ‚Äúand then primarily his injury is one where you‚Äôre managing his symptoms, swelling, and pain. And you know, when those things happen, it‚Äôs best for him to sit out.‚Äù\n\nJan 4, 2025; Brooklyn, New York, USA; Philadelphia 76ers center Joel Embiid (21) looks on during the first half against the Brooklyn Nets at Barclays Center.

And I think you heard his answer. He believes in this team. He believes in how it can come together. And he was praising of Tyrese and others who have kept us in it. If he‚Äôs not out there, it‚Äôs because his symptoms aren‚Äôt allowing him to be out there.‚Äù\n\nMorey also continued discussing the specifics of the projected recovery and what that looks like for Embiid. Notably, the answer is quite different from Embiid‚Äôs.\n\n‚ÄúWe‚Äôre optimistic long term,‚Äù Morey said. ‚ÄúTalking to the doctors, and our understanding from talking with multiple experts, I think we‚Äôre seven, eight, nine, ten at this point of the top people in the world all see this as one that, over time, will improve, But it‚Äôs happened slower than anyone‚Äôs anticipated.‚Äù\n\nHow many times will the team continue to run an injured Joel Embiid out on the court and hope for the best? And how many times will the Sixers continue to misrepresent the facts about Embiid‚Äôs recovery?",

There will also be Asian cultural performances, family activities, games, raffles, merchandise, and more.\n\n‚ÄúWe are beyond excited to expand our festival to Philadelphia, which is such an incredible city full of rich culture and food, especially within the Asian communities,‚Äù said festival founder Xuan (BiuBiu) Xu. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs difficult to discuss the biggest and best Asian food cultures in America without talking about Philadelphia, and the fact that we‚Äôre just a short train ride away in New York City made Philadelphia an obvious choice for our expansion.‚Äù\n\nPanda Fest‚Äôs parent festival, Dragon Fest, was created in 2021, and since its inception, the organization has created 21 events for more than 500,000 attendees. Panda Fest specifically was created in July of 2024, and its hoped that the experience can come back to Philly after its inaugural event.\n\n‚ÄúIf this first event goes well, we plan to return to Philadelphia in the fall and make this a bi-annual event, so we‚Äôre very optimistic and hopeful for a successful debut, especially since we planned this to be held the weekend before AAPI Month, which is an important time for all Asian cultures in America,‚Äù Xu added.\n\nPhiladelphia‚Äôs Panda Fest will feature more than 80 different types of Asian street food, with approximately 35 vendors spread throughout Dilworth Park. Early bird tickets have already sold out for the pop-up, but anyone interested can head to Eventbrite to jump on a waiting list for different timeslots. Children four and under do not need a ticket, and no tickets will be available at the door.\n\nIn addition to access to food, fun, and games, tickets include three free gifts as well: A customized Panda pin with a Philly design feature, an inflatable headband, and a customize panda bag. While many vendors will be from NYC, the event aims to be inclusive, and Philadelphia restaurants are encouraged to apply online to be vendors as well for the two-day affair, the release notes.\n\nThe festival will be adorned with panda decorations, and there will be a number of panda-themed foods as well. Pets are permitted, but must be kept on a leash.\n\nTo learn more about Philadelphia‚Äôs first Panda Fest, visit pandafests.com",

The application deadline has been extended to Feb. 28.\n\nHomeowners who enroll in the low-income tax freeze before the deadline will have their property tax bill frozen at its 2024 amount, even if their assessed property value or tax rate increases. This programs helps seniors and other low-income homeowners remain in their homes as housing costs and property tax bills increase.\n\n‚ÄúEnsuring that longtime residents, especially low-income families and individuals, can afford to stay in their homes remains a top priority for me,‚Äù said Council President Kenyatta Johnson. ‚ÄúThe low-income tax freeze provides critical relief to those who need it most, helping to prevent displacement amidst rising property costs. This initiative is a key step toward equitable neighborhoods for all.‚Äù\n\nSingle-person households earning no more than $33,500 annually and married couples earning no more than $41,500 annually are eligible for the low-income property tax freeze. Homeowners can apply online via the Philadelphia Tax Center, by mail, or in-person at one of the city‚Äôs services centers. Proof of income is required.\n\nAdvocates for the freeze, including Councilmember Jamie Gauthier, who sponsored the bill creating the program, have said it should help those who do not qualify for or receive enough assistance from existing initiatives, such as the Senior Citizen Real Estate Tax Freeze and the Long-term Owner Occupants Program (LOOP).\n\n‚ÄúBy making sure low-income homeowners can afford their tax bills we defy displacement and keep families in their homes, so they can continue to shop, dine, and work on our commercial corridors, steward our neighborhoods and public spaces, and reinforce their block‚Äôs sense of community,‚Äù Gauthier said.\n\nThe Reinvestment Fund, in an analysis released when lawmakers were considering the legislation, estimated that about 62,000 households would be eligible for the Low-Income Tax Freeze. As of Jan. 23, more than 1,600 homeowners have been approved for the tax freeze.\n\nResidents with questions about the freeze or other tax relief programs can call the Department of Revenue at 215-686-6442.",

Many members of Gays Against Guns and Rise and Resist were also in attendance.\n\nThe event sought to bring support to trans and non-binary youth and share community ‚Äî including with families, caregivers, educators, and healthcare providers. The rally came just over a week after President Donald Trump signed an executive order aiming to restrict gender-affirming care for individuals under the age of 19, leading to reports of some New York City-area hospitals pulling back on gender-affirming care services for youth. Attorney General Letitia James, who targeted the order in court, cited a subsequent court ruling as she urged providers to restore care or else risk violating New York State law.\n\n‚ÄúI know how important my life is, and I know that being me is not hurting anybody,‚Äù Naim, a TfS student, said in remarks to the crowd. ‚ÄúBeing me only makes the word a better place. Me and my trans and non-binary friends all deserve to have the same rights to happiness that everyone else does. Us trans and non-binary kids need your help.‚Äù\n\nSee some photos below:",

The former top prospect struggled in his lone season at Kentucky, but a return to familiar scenery did wonders as Edwards has proven himself with every opportunity the Sixers have given him.\n\nThe Philly native has performed well this season, averaging 8.1 points, 3.1 rebounds, and 1.4 assists in 23.9 minutes of action over 22 games. Over his last 10 games, Edwards‚Äô scoring average is up to 10.1 points per game. As Edwards‚Äô portfolio of work continues to grow, should he keep this level of play up, he has an opportunity to be considered for an NBA All-Rookie team.\n\nFeb 4, 2025; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA; Philadelphia 76ers forward Justin Edwards (19) dunks against the Dallas Mavericks in the fourth quarter at Wells Fargo Center. Mandatory Credit: Kyle Ross-Imagn Images\n\nTo reward Edwards for his stellar play, the Sixers are signing him to a standard NBA contract with a second year that has a player option; the Philadelphia Inquirer‚Äôs Keith Pompey was the first to report.\n\nAs Pompey noted, the player option for the 2025-26 season allows for both the Sixers and Edwards to explore a longer-term deal this offseason. Initial expectations were for Edwards to sign a deal similar to Ricky Council IV‚Äôs rookie conversion deal, but Edwards has outperformed Council‚Äôs rookie season, and his representation, Klutch Sports, is known for its negotiating abilities.\n\nWhile longer-term negotiations will wait, Edwards‚Äô future, as far as can be seen, is in Philadelphia. The Sixers now have 14 filled roster spots ‚Äî including Chuma Okeke on a 10-day contract, leaving the team with an open roster spot and an open two-way slot should they wish to fill them.",

(Photo by Elsa/Getty Images)\n\nSign up for our email newsletter to stay up-to-date on the latest local sports news throughout Philadelphia.\n\nFestivities are underway as the Philadelphia Eagles are the reigning Super Bowl Champions. While the city of Philadelphia celebrates, the yearly sports cycle spins on and on. In just a few days, the sounds of helmets clashing and the smells of pigskins will be replaced by sounds of cracking wooden bats and the smells of freshly mowed grass and sunflower seed.\n\nThat is right, the Philadelphia Phillies are back. Spring Training is here.\n\nWhere the Phillies Currently Stand\n\nAfter a 95-win season in 2024, the Phils are National League East Champions for the first time since 2011. This offseason, the Phillies have not gone for the flashy signing approach they have in the past, rather reinforcing their team‚Äôs core with the acquisitions of Max Kepler, Jesus Luzardo, Jordan Romano, and Joe Ross.\n\nWhile one can argue the Phillies‚Äô bullpen has regressed with the loss of Jeff Hoffman and Carlos Estevez, the Phillies remain one of the top teams in Major League Baseball. According to MLB.com, the Phillies begin 2025 second only to the Los Angeles Dodgers in the Power Rankings.\n\nEven being ranked the second-best team, however, the Phillies have their work cut out for them in 2025. The Atlanta Braves will be out for blood after the Phils took the NL East title from them. Meanwhile the Mets knocked the Phillies out of the postseason before losing to the eventual World Champion Dodgers in the NLCS.\n\nProspects Set to Debut in 2025\n\nWhile two of the Phillies‚Äô largest prospects in Aidan Miller and Justin Crawford, will likely not be making their Major League debuts in 2025. There are, however, two highly touted prospects likely to finally appear in the big leagues.\n\nMick Abel may not have as much excitement attached to his name as when the Phillies drafted him in 2020, but the 23-year-old will look to earn his way into the Phillies‚Äô bullpen in 2025. Abel owned a poor 6.46 ERA as a starter for Lehigh Valley in 2024 but still owned a strong 9.69 K/9 rate. At the very least, Abel will be able to eat extra innings as a deep man in the bullpen. At best, he could become a high-leverage, high-strikeout reliever for the Phillies.\n\nAndrew Painter is in the late stages of rehabbing from Tommy John surgery. The right-hander is believed by many to be a top starting pitcher in the Majors. At age 21, the sky is certainly the limit for Painter, but he must first fully recover and get some innings under his belt. Dave Dombrowski has gone on record, and he plans for Painter to make his MLB debut sometime around July.\n\nTop Talent\n\nThe Phillies feature a strong contingent of veteran talent that will lead the way this season. Bryce Harper, Trea Turner, and J.T. Realmuto highlighted a strong infield with young guns Alec Bohm and Bryson Stott playing pivotal roles as well. Kyle Schwarber and Nick Castellanos provide additional offensive power from designated hitter and right field, respectively. Max Kepler is set to join Castellanos on Opening Day in left field, with the platoon of Brandon Marsh and Johan Rojas rounding out the outfield in center field.\n\nThe true bread and butter of the Phillies lie in their pitching rotation. Zack Wheeler and Aaron Nola captain the way while the young guns of Ranger Suarez and Cristopher Sanchez demand respect. Add in newcomer Jesus Luzardo, and the Phillies have a deep one-to-five to start the 2025 campaign.\n\nRiding the Hype Train\n\nWith the Eagles having earned their second Super Bowl championship, the energy throughout Philadelphia is at a fever pitch. As the city of Philadelphia prepares to celebrate the boys in green in the coming days, the boys in red pinstripes are also set to begin preparations for their 162-game campaign.\n\nPitchers and catchers report on Wednesday, with the rest of the Phillies‚Äô contingent joining on February 17.\n\nThe Philadelphia Eagles are World Champions. It is officially baseball season.\n\nPhoto by Elsa/Getty Images",

(Photo by Terence Lewis/Icon Sportswire via Getty Images)\n\nEagles fans, today is a big day. If you‚Äôre looking to get in on the Super Bowl action, there‚Äôs a new way to wager that‚Äôs a little different to sports betting and is available in all 50 states. Welcome to Kalshi!\n\nUse the Kalshi promo code PSN to score a $10 bonus to start trading on the Super Bowl.\n\nEven if you live in a legal sports betting state like Pennsylvania, there are plenty of reasons to take advantage of this promotion and begin exploring the popular prediction market platform.\n\nKalshi Promo Code Details\n\nKalshi Promo Code PSN: Sign up here\n\nBonus: $10 after trading 100 contracts\n\nEligibility: New U.S. users 18+\n\nDeposit Options: Bank transfer, Apple Pay, debit cards, USDC (crypto), or wire\n\nHow Trading Works\n\nBefore you use the Kalshi promo code, let‚Äôs break down exactly how trading on the new platform works, using today‚Äôs Super Bowl prices as an example.\n\nThe Eagles are priced as slight underdogs on Kalshi at 48¬¢ per contract, while the Chiefs sit at 53¬¢. These represent their ‚Äòimplied probabilities of winning‚Äô if you will, so a 48% chance that the Eagles win and a 53% chance that the Chiefs do. Each contract pays out a maximum of $1.00, so buying a ‚ÄúYES‚Äù contract for the Eagles at 48¬¢ means you‚Äôll profit 52¬¢ per contract. If you‚Äôre looking to buy 10 contracts on the Eagles winning, that will give you a $5.20 profit off a $10 wager.\n\nWhy Kalshi Stands Out\n\nAs a CFTC-regulated prediction market, Kalshi offers a unique, nationally accessible platform to trade on sports, politics, pop culture, finance, and more. It‚Äôs closer to a stock market platform than a sportsbook, completely dismantling the house edge and letting users trade peer-to-peer.\n\nThe markets go beyond sports, covering elections, Spotify streams, and Rotten Tomatoes scores for upcoming movies, just to name a few.\n\nWhether you‚Äôre in New York, California, or anywhere in between, you can legally make real-money predictions on just about anything.\n\nWhat‚Äôs a Prediction Market?\n\nIf terms like ‚Äúcontracts‚Äù and ‚Äútrading‚Äù sound confusing, think of Kalshi as a marketplace that moves live with the market. Instead of ‚Äòcashing out‚Äô a bet, you‚Äôre selling contracts. But unlike sportsbooks, you can do this all game, giving you much more control.\n\nAnd to top things off, you get a $10 sign-up bonus after trading 100 contracts.\n\nWhy use the Kalshi promo code?\n\nLower Fees: Kalshi‚Äôs Super Bowl prices beat the best Eagles vs. Chiefs odds you‚Äôll find at sportsbooks. You can avoid the fees entirely by setting limit orders as opposed to buying at the live price (asking to buy lower).\n\nLive Pricing: The probabilities and profits update in real-time as the game unfolds ‚Äî meaning that the market is never locked.\n\nExit Anytime: Sell contracts mid-game, after a touchdown, or a big play, to secure profits or minimize risk.\n\nBeyond Sports: After the Super Bowl, you can trade on elections, awards shows, or quirky markets.\n\nRemember, use the Kalshi code PSN to start trading ‚Äî click here to get started\n\nPhoto by Terence Lewis/Icon Sportswire via Getty Images",

        "fullContent": "article\n\nThe Brief Despite picking the Chiefs to win Super Bowl LIX, President Trump appeared to mock the team and pop star Taylor Swift after the game. President Trump and Swift both received different reactions when each was shown on screen during the game. The Chiefs suffered a one-sided loss to the Philadelphia Eagles.\n\n\n\nPresident Donald Trump took to social media Sunday night where he appeared to take some parting shots at the Kansas City Chiefs and pop star Taylor Swift following Super Bowl LIX.\n\nBoth President Trump and Swift were shown on the big screen during the game and appeared to receive far different reactions from the crowd in the Caesars Superdome in New Orleans, Louisiana.\n\nDespite publicly voicing his support for Kansas City prior to the game, Trump took to Truth Social to seemingly mock Swift and the Chiefs.\n\nTrump, Swift get different receptions from Super Bowl crowd\n\nWhat we know:\n\nPresident Trump attended the Super Bowl, marking a historic moment as the first sitting president to do so.\n\nDuring the national anthem, he was shown on screen and cheered by the crowd at the Caesars Superdome.\n\nTaylor Swift, who was in attendance supporting boyfriend and Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce, faced boos when she was shown on the same screen.\n\nSwift appeared to make light of the situation in the moment, giving a side-eye that later went viral on social media.\n\nThe interaction with the crowd prompted some, including tennis legend Serena Williams, to come to Swift‚Äôs defense on social media.\n\nThe backstory:\n\nTensions between Trump and Swift have been escalating over the past year, particularly after Swift endorsed Kamala Harris for president.\n\nTrump has publicly criticized Swift, even expressing his preference for Brittany Mahomes, the wife of Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes, who has appeared to support Trump on social media over the past several months.\n\nSwift's relationship with Kelce and her frequent appearances at NFL games have also stirred mixed reactions among fans.\n\nTrump mocks Swift, Chiefs ‚Äòtough‚Äô night\n\nWhat they're saying:\n\nAfter the game, Trump took to Truth Social to mock Swift and the Chiefs, attributing the boos she received to his \"Make America Great Again\" supporters.\n\n\"The only one that had a tougher night than the Kansas City Chiefs was Taylor Swift. She got BOOED out of the Stadium. MAGA is very unforgiving!\" Trump wrote.\n\nHe posted videos highlighting the contrasting reactions he and Swift received from the crowd.\n\nTrump also criticized the NFL's new kickoff format, which he has opposed since the start of the season.\n\n\"The worst part of the Super Bowl, by far, was watching the Kickoff where, as the ball is sailing through the air, the entire field is frozen, stiff.

FCC Commissioner Brendan Carr questioned why CBS quickly released a transcript of Vice President JD Vance‚Äôs interview but delayed releasing Harris‚Äô full responses.\n\n\n\nThe Federal Communications Commission has released the full, unedited transcript and footage of Vice President Kamala Harris‚Äô October 2024 interview on \"60 Minutes\" after months of controversy over how CBS edited the broadcast.\n\nThe move has reignited debate over whether the network misrepresented Harris‚Äô responses to key foreign policy questions.\n\nWhat‚Äôs in the unedited interview?\n\nThe backstory:\n\nCBS faced criticism for airing different portions of Harris‚Äô response regarding Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu‚Äôs handling of the Israel-Gaza war.\n\nIn a preview clip aired on \"Face the Nation,\" Harris gave a lengthy answer that some critics mocked as a \"word salad.\" However, when \"60 Minutes\" aired the interview the following night, the segment featured only a shorter, more polished excerpt of her response.\n\nCBS later published the full transcript and video, stating that the materials confirmed \"60 Minutes‚Äô\" original assurance that the broadcast was not doctored or deceitful.\n\nThe network defended its editing choices, explaining that journalists regularly trim interviews for time, space, or clarity, and that \"60 Minutes\" edits are guided by what will be most informative to viewers.\n\nWhy is the FCC involved?\n\nThe other side:\n\nFCC Commissioner Brendan Carr ordered CBS to provide the unedited transcript as part of an investigation into whether the network violated the FCC‚Äôs news distortion policy, which prohibits networks from deliberately misrepresenting news events.\n\nCarr questioned why CBS immediately released an unredacted transcript of a recent interview with Vice President JD Vance but refused to release the one with Harris for months. The FCC has since opened a public review of the news distortion complaint.\n\nCarr also told Fox News Digital that transparency is key and that the FCC‚Äôs review will continue as it gathers public feedback. CBS News has not publicly responded to requests for further comment.\n\n(L-R) Former US President Bill Clinton, former Vice President Kamala Harris, and former US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton attend the inauguration ceremonies in the U.S. Capitol Rotunda on January 20, 2025 in Washington, DC.

The network explained that it aired a longer portion of her response on \"Face the Nation\" and a shorter excerpt on \"60 Minutes\" but ensured the vice president‚Äôs answers were fairly represented.\n\nIt also emphasized that the \"hard-hitting questions\" posed to Harris in the interview spoke for themselves.\n\n\"In reporting the news, journalists regularly edit interviews ‚Äì for time, space or clarity. In making these edits, ‚Äò60 Minutes‚Äô is always guided by the truth and what we believe will be most informative to the viewing public ‚Äì all while working within the constraints of broadcast television,\" CBS said on its website , which included the original transcripts and video requested by the FCC.\n\nHowever, critics argue that CBS selectively edited Harris‚Äô remarks to protect her from further scrutiny after her full response was widely criticized.\n\nThe controversy over the transcript release has drawn renewed attention to media transparency and the role of networks in shaping political narratives.\n\nWhat's next:\n\nThe FCC is now seeking public input on the news distortion complaint and will continue its review of CBS‚Äô handling of the Harris interview. The controversy has also raised broader concerns about media transparency and the role of federal oversight in journalism.\n\n\"The FCC has now opened up a proceeding and is seeking public comment on the News Distortion complaint. Transparency here is important. The FCC‚Äôs review will continue, and we look forward to the public‚Äôs feedback,\" Carr said.",

Workers will receive roughly eight months of salary if they accept the offer, the Associated Press reported.\n\nIn addition to receiving their salary and retaining all benefits during this time, employees who agree to the buyout will be exempted from all applicable in-person work requirements until Sept. 30, as the Trump administration works to require employees to return to government offices.\n\nRELATED: Judge extends block on Trump‚Äôs federal funding freeze\n\nWorkers are receiving the offers via email with instructions on how to accept the buyout: select \"Reply\" and \"Type the word ‚ÄòResign‚Äô into the body of this email and hit ‚Äòsend.‚Äô\"\n\nThe email, obtained by the Associated Press, reads in part that anyone who remains will be expected to be \"loyal\" and \"will be subject to enhanced standards of suitability and conduct as we move forward.\" Some employees could be reclassified to limit civil service protections as well.\n\n\"Employees who engage in unlawful behavior or other misconduct will be prioritized for appropriate investigation and discipline, including termination,\" according to the email.\n\nWhat they're saying:\n\nThe Trump administration added pressure on employees to leave, sending a reminder that layoffs or furloughs could come next.\n\n\"The majority of federal agencies are likely to be downsized through restructurings, realignments, and reductions in force,\" said the message from the Office of Personnel Management, the Associated Press noted.\n\nDemocrats tell the AP that federal workers shouldn't accept the deferred resignation program because it wasn't authorized by Congress, raising the risk they won't get paid.\n\n\"It‚Äôs a scam and not a buyout,\" Everett Kelley, president of the American Federation of Government Employees, told the AP.\n\nWhat happens if government workers don‚Äôt accept the offer?\n\nGovernment workers who don't accept the offer have been told their jobs could be at risk as the Trump administration moves ahead with its overhaul of government operations, Reuters reported.\n\nThe news outlet noted that Trump's officials at the Department of Justice have already fired prosecutors who worked on cases involving individuals who attacked the U.S. Capitol on January 6, 2021, and have demanded the names of up to 6,000 FBI agents who were involved.\n\nCan workers return to government service if they take the buyout?\n\nWorkers who take the buyout can apply for other government work in the future.\n\nHow many government workers are there?\n\nBy the numbers:\n\nThe federal government employs over 3 million people, accounting for 1.9% of the nation‚Äôs entire civilian workforce, the Associated Press reported, citing the Pew Research Center. The civilian workforce is about 2.4 million, not including the U.S. Postal Service employees and active-duty military.\n\nAlmost 20% of federal workers are in Washington, D.C., Maryland, and Virginia.

And it did happen. It‚Äôs pretty cool. I‚Äôm just happy we won the game.\"\n\nIt was a pretty sweet 28th birthday as well for DeJean's teammate, Saquon Barkley, who set the single-season record for most combined yards rushing in the regular season and playoffs.\n\nBut it was DeJean who made the biggest play.\n\nDeJean undercut a route by DeAndre Hopkins and picked off Mahomes before racing in for the touchdown. DeJean said his mindset was simple once he got the ball.\n\n\"Score a touchdown,\" he said. \"I was trying to find the fastest way to the end zone. Luckily, I got some blocks out there. I had to avoid some of those big guys, but it was just our defense working together like we have all year. It fell right into my lap.\"\n\nThe backstory:\n\nIt was the first pick-6 in a Super Bowl since Robert Alford had one for Atlanta against Tom Brady and New England eight years ago. That one gave the Falcons a 21-0 lead that grew to 28-3 in the second half before the Patriots mounted the biggest comeback in Super Bowl history.\n\nThat's the only time a team has lost a Super Bowl after returning an interception for a touchdown with the other 13 teams now all winning, including Tampa Bay in a game with three pick-6s against the Oakland Raiders in Super Bowl 37.\n\nDeJean and teammate Saquon Barkley are the 15th and 16th players to appear in a Super Bowl on their birthdays, according to Sportradar. None of those players had scored a touchdown or intercepted a pass before DeJean.\n\nBarkley finished with 25 carries for 57 yards and set the NFL season rushing record, postseason included, topping the mark of 2,476 yards set by Terrell Davis.\n\nDeJean was a second-round pick out of Iowa in 2024 and his insertion into the starting lineup early in the season was a key part of Philadelphia's defensive rebound.\n\nWhat they're saying:\n\nHis big play delighted his fans in his small hometown of Odebolt, Iowa, who came out for a Super Bowl watch party.",

        "fullContent": "While the Eagles take a moment to bask in Super Bowl glory, the team will soon be forced to make decisions on several key players who helped bring the Lombardi Trophy back to Philadelphia.\n\nThe Eagles league-leading defense that remained stout against Patrick Mahomes and the Kansas City Chiefs in the Super Bowl could lose breakout linebacker Zack Baun, and linemen Josh Sweat and Milton Williams.\n\nThe Eagles also stand to lose a key part of their offensive line, and other smaller role players who helped them on the road to Super Bowl LIX.\n\nWho are Eagles key free agents?\n\nZack Baun, LB: Baun had somewhat of a full circle moment in Super Bowl LIX at the Caesars Superdome in New Orleans. That was the field that Baun called home for the first four years of his professional football career as a member of the Saints.\n\nThe Eagles quietly signed Baun to a one-year contract last March, a move that didn't receive fanfare and limited media coverage. It ended up being one of GM Howie Roseman's best savviest moves of the offseason ‚Äì and maybe his entire career.\n\nBaun, 30, had a breakout season for the Eagles and started in every game, including the postseason. The former 3rd round draft pick had more than 150 tackles and was credited with 52 solo take downs. His ferocious defense made him a candidate for Defensive Player of the Year.\n\nJosh Sweat, DT: The Eagles front seven anchored their league-leading defense that dominated Patrick Mahomes and the Chiefs in Super Bowl LIX. Sweat was among that core after signing a one-year deal to remain with the Eagles last offseason.\n\nPhiladelphia got another steady season out of Sweat, a 27-year-old drafted out of Florida State in 2018. He played in 16 regular season games, collecting over 40 combo tackles for the fourth straight year and finishing around 30 solo tackles for the third year in a row.\n\nFeatured article\n\nSweat let the Eagles know what they could be missing in the Super Bowl when he sacked Mahomes twice, with three quarterback hits, and recorded six tackles.\n\nMilton Williams, DE: The Eagles could lose another member of their gargantuan defensive line that so many opposing teams feared on Philadelphia's Super Bowl winning team.\n\nWilliams played in all 17 games last season, starting seven. The former third round draft pick set a new career high with 5 sacks and forced his first fumble.\n\nMekhi Becton, OL: Standing at 6'7, 363 lbs. the Eagles could lose a seemingly immovable object on their offensive line that's tasked with not only protecting Jalen Hurts, but widening holes for Saquon Barkley.\n\nBecton seemed to have hit his stride in his first season in Philadelphia after his career with the New York Jets was derailed by a knee injury. The 25-year-old is hard to miss on the field and could hold a similar presence on the free agent market.\n\nBrandon Graham, DE: The word ‚Äòleader‚Äô defines Brandon Graham in more ways than one. For more than a decade, Graham has been the heart and soul of the Eagles defense, but he's also the team's all time leader in games played with 206.\n\nAll signs point to Graham retiring in the offseason after the 36-year-old had a storybook finish to his career culminating in his second Super Bowl ring. Graham made his season debut in Super Bowl LIX and contributed to an all-time defensive performance against one of the greatest coach-quarterback duos ever.\n\nGraham was mum about his future immediately following the Super Bowl, but many expected it to be the final game of his 14 year career.\n\nOther notable free agents: Fred Johnson, G; Avonte Maddox, CB; Rick Lovato, LS\n\nWhen does NFL free agency start?\n\nNFL free agency starts at the ‚Äòbeginning‚Äô of the NFL's calendar year, which in 2025 is on Wednesday, Mar. 12 at 4 p.m. However, 32 teams can enter negotiations with free agents two days before free agency starts in what's known as the \"legal tampering window.\"\n\nTeams can begin using the franchise tag on Feb. 18 and have until Mar. 4 to use it.",

        "fullContent": "article\n\nThe Brief Eagles offensive coordinator Kellen Moore remains a candidate for the New Orleans Saints head coaching job. Moore captained the Eagles' explosive run-first offense that propelled Philadelphia to its second Super Bowl in less than a decade. Eagles coaches and players have publicly voiced their desire for Moore to return as offensive coordinator next season.\n\n\n\nEagles Offensive Coordinator Kellen Moore's future in Philadelphia is up in the air after the Eagles steamrolled over the Kansas City Chiefs in Super Bowl LIX.\n\nMoore, in his first season with the Eagles, captained a run-first offense with Saquon Barkley that opened up the field for an equally dominant collection of receivers, including AJ Brown and DeVonta Smith.\n\nMoore's prowess as a game caller for a championship team did not go unnoticed around the league, which garnered attention from many teams looking for a new head coach ‚Äì namely, the New Orleans Saints.\n\nWhat we know:\n\nIt's possible that Moore's last game as Eagles offensive coordinator may have been played in the building he could call home next season.\n\nMoore's link to New Orleans isn't just speculation that the only team currently looking for a head coach will pivot to Moore after the Super Bowl. The Saints interviewed Moore for their vacant position more than a week before the Birds hoisted the Lombardi Trophy for the second time in eight years.\n\n\"Its‚Äô obviously been a good process,\" he said of his preliminary meetings with Saints general manager Mickey Loomis and other team officials in Philadelphia last week. \"Having an opportunity to meet with Mickey and their leadership group has been great, and it‚Äôs set up in a way that allows us to focus on this game and we‚Äôll see what happens after that.\"\n\nDuring the regular season, the Eagles ranked eighth in the NFL offensively (367.2 yards per game), but gained most of their yards on the ground. Philadelphia ranked second in rushing (179.3 ypg) and 29th in passing (187.9 ypg).\n\n\"You build around your players,\" Moore said. \"There's different styles we've played over the years and that's the fun part of it.\n\nThe other side:\n\nIf he indeed winds up being hired in New Orleans, he'd take over an offense starring dynamic running back Alvin Kamara. And his quarterback could be Derek Carr, against whom he once played in college when Moore was at Boise State and Carr was with Fresno State.\n\n\"Tons of respect for him as a quarterback in this league,\" Moore said of Carr. \"He‚Äôs had a tremendous career and done a lot of really good things.\"\n\nMoore hasn't had extensive experience in New Orleans but has a relationship with the family of Archie Manning from his days at the Manning Passing Academy in Thibodaux, Louisiana, which he called an \"awesome experience.\"\n\nWhenever he winds up being a head coach, Moore said he would expect to continue to be the primary play-caller for the offense.\n\nWhat they're saying:\n\nEagles offensive players didn't seem surprised to see Moore on New Orleans' short list.\n\n\"He's the worst coordinator I've ever had,\" Eagles offensive tackle Jordan Mailata said jokingly, as if that might prevent the Saints from hiring him away.\n\n\"Kellen's been the best,\" Mailata continued. \"He's done a great job setting up plays, explaining the schemes and the whys behind certain motions, formations. It's a magical thing. It's no wonder why he's a finalist to be a head coach here.\"\n\nEagles Head Coach Nick Sirianni even begged Moore to stay during an on-field interview after the Super Bowl.\n\n\"Let's run this **** back, Kellen,\" Sirianni told ESPN.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report",

The bureau was created after the 2008 financial crisis to regulate mortgages, car loans and other consumer finance.\n\n\n\nElon Musk and members of his Department of Government Efficiency team have reportedly entered the headquarters of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the latest agency to be targeted by the billionaire ally of President Donald Trump.\n\nMusk, a few hours later on his social media site X, posted \"CFPB RIP\" with a tombstone emoji. It‚Äôs not the first time that Musk, who‚Äôs been tapped by Trump to upend the federal workforce, has made disparaging comments about the CFPB.\n\nRELATED: Time magazine cover puts Elon Musk behind Trump's desk\n\nWhat is the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau?\n\nThe backstory:\n\nThe bureau was created after the 2008 financial crisis to regulate mortgages, car loans and other consumer finance. It has long been opposed by Republicans and their financial backers.\n\nSen. Elizabeth Warren developed the idea of the CFPB and is one of Trump‚Äôs targets for criticism.\n\nRELATED: 'BACK TO PLASTIC': Trump to sign executive order banning paper straws\n\nLast year, the Supreme Court rejected a challenge that could have undermined the bureau, ruling that the way it is funded does not violate the Constitution. Unlike most federal agencies, the bureau does not rely on the annual budget process in Congress, but is funded directly by the Federal Reserve.\n\nWhy is Musk targeting the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau?\n\nBig picture view:\n\nMusk, Trump and a large bloc of Republicans have long criticized the CFPB as regulatory overreach. But consumer advocates say Musk‚Äôs motives may be a conflict of interest: According to Politico , Musk sees the CFPB as an obstacle to launching real-time payments on X through Visa. The CFPB has been cracking down on tech companies with payment platforms.\n\nThe other side:\n\nMany liberal groups stressed that the CPFB work helped to return billions of dollars to consumers.\n\nKitty Richards, a former Treasury Department official and senior strategic adviser at the liberal think tank Groundwork Collaborative, said the CPFB has been a \"tireless watchdog.\"\n\n\"Trump was always more interested in serving his billionaire boys club than delivering change for working people,\" Richards said.\n\nTrump fires head of Consumer Financial Protection Bureau\n\nDig deeper:\n\nThe crusade against the CFPB comes days after Trump fired the director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, Rohit Chopra, in the latest purge of a Biden administration holdover.\n\nChopra was one of the more important regulators from the previous Democratic administration who was still on the job since Trump took office on Jan. 20. Chopra‚Äôs tenure saw the removal of medical debt from credit reports and limits on overdraft penalties, all based on the premise that the financial system could be fairer and more competitive in ways that helped consumers. But many in the financial industry viewed his actions as regulatory overreach.\n\nCalifornia Rep. Maxine Waters, the top Democrat on the House Financial Services Committee, said in a statement that Chopra‚Äôs dismissal \"marks the end of an era of strong consumer protection and the beginning of a plan to end this important agency.\"",

But Elon Musk's so-called Department of Government Efficiency raised the prospect in a post on X last month highlighting the penny‚Äôs cost.\n\n(Tim Boyle/Getty Images)\n\nBy the numbers:\n\nThe U.S. Mint reported losing $85.3 million in the 2024 fiscal year that ended in September on the nearly 3.2 billion pennies it produced. Every penny cost nearly $0.037 ‚Äî up from $0.031 the year before.\n\nThe mint also loses money on the nickel, with each of the $0.05 coins costing nearly $0.14 to make.\n\nIt is unclear whether Trump has the power to unilaterally eliminate the lowly one-cent coin. Currency specifications -- including the size and metal content of coins -- are dictated by Congress.\n\nWhat they're saying:\n\nBut Robert K. Triest, an economics professor at Northeastern University, has argued that there might be wiggle room.\n\n\"The process of discontinuing the penny in the U.S. is a little unclear. It would likely require an act of Congress, but the Secretary of the Treasury might be able to simply stop the minting of new pennies,\" he said last month.\n\nMembers of Congress have repeatedly introduced legislation taking aim at the zinc coin with copper plating. Proposals over the years have attempted to temporarily suspend the penny‚Äôs production, eliminate it from circulation, or require that prices be rounded to the nearest five cents, according to the Congressional Research Service.\n\nProponents of eliminating the coin have cited cost savings, speedier checkouts at cash registers, and the fact that a number of countries have already eliminated their one-cent coins. Canada, for instance, stopped minting its penny in 2012.\n\nBig picture view:\n\nIt wouldn't be the first time the U.S. eliminated its least valuable coin. The half-cent coin was discontinued by Congress in 1857.\n\nTrump's new administration has been sharply focused on cutting costs, with Musk, who has been brought on to lead the task, targeting entire agencies and large swaths of the federal workforce as he tries to identify a goal of $2 trillion in savings.\n\n\"Let‚Äôs rip the waste out of our great nations budget, even if it‚Äôs a penny at a time,\" Trump wrote in his post.\n\nTrump sent the message as he was departing New Orleans after watching the first half of the Super Bowl.\n\nThe Source: Information in this story comes from President Donald J.

But Elon Musk‚Äôs so-called Department of Government Efficiency raised the prospect in a post on X last month highlighting the penny‚Äôs cost.\n\nIt is unclear whether Trump has the power to unilaterally eliminate the lowly one-cent coin. Currency specifications -- including the size and metal content of coins -- are dictated by Congress.\n\nMembers of Congress have repeatedly introduced legislation taking aim at the zinc coin with copper plating. Proposals over the years have attempted to temporarily suspend the penny‚Äôs production, eliminate it from circulation, or require that prices be rounded to the nearest five cents, according to the Congressional Research Service.\n\nProponents of eliminating the coin have cited cost savings, speedier checkouts at cash registers, and the fact that a number of countries have already eliminated their one-cent coins. Canada, for instance, stopped minting its penny in 2012.\n\nIt wouldn‚Äôt be the first time the U.S. eliminated its least valuable coin. The half-cent coin was discontinued by Congress in 1857.\n\nBy the numbers:\n\nThe U.S. Mint reported losing $85.3 million in the 2024 fiscal year that ended in September on the nearly 3.2 billion pennies it produced. Every penny cost nearly $0.037 ‚Äî up from $0.031 the year before.\n\nThe mint also loses money on the nickel, with each of the $0.05 coins costing nearly $0.14 to make.\n\nWhat they're saying:\n\nRobert K. Triest, an economics professor at Northeastern University, has argued that there might be wiggle room for Trump to eliminate the penny.\n\n\"The process of discontinuing the penny in the U.S. is a little unclear. It would likely require an act of Congress, but the Secretary of the Treasury might be able to simply stop the minting of new pennies,\" he said last month.",

        "fullContent": "The Brief All 10 victims of the Alaska plane crash have been recovered from the Bering Sea. Crews are working to retrieve the wreckage as harsh weather threatens the site. Investigators are trying to determine the cause of the crash, one of Alaska‚Äôs deadliest in decades.\n\n\n\nAuthorities said the remains of all 10 people killed when their small plane crashed into ice on the Bering Sea have been recovered.\n\nThe Nome Volunteer Fire Department made the announcement on its Facebook page Saturday afternoon. Recovery crews had been racing to recover the bodies before a winter storm was expected to hit the region.\n\nWhat they're saying:\n\n\"All ten individuals aboard the Bering Air plane have been officially brought home,\" the fire department wrote in the social media post at about 3 p.m.\n\n\"It‚Äôs hard to accept the reality of our loss,\" U.S. Sen. Lisa Murkowski said during an evening news conference.\n\nNome Mayor John Handeland choked up as he discussed the deaths and the response effort.\n\nRELATED: Missing plane in Alaska: Crews search for Bering Air flight carrying 10 people\n\n\"Nome is a strong community, and in challenging times we come together and support each other. I expect the outpouring of support to continue in the coming days as we all work to recover from this tragic incident,\" Handeland said.\n\nn search efforts.\n\nWhat's next:\n\nCrews were still working on recovering the aircraft, the fire department said.\n\nA phone line was set up to give updates and emotional support to people who had loved ones on board, Bering Air said. The company asked for privacy for everyone involved, and said it was committed to supporting authorities.\n\nThe victims:\n\nAmong those killed in the crash were Rhone Baumgartner and Kameron Hartvigson. They had traveled to Unalakleet to service a heat recovery system vital to the community‚Äôs water plant, according to the Alaska Native Tribal Health Consortium.\n\n\"The loss of these two incredible individuals and everyone else on board the plane will be felt all over Alaska,\" David Beveridge, vice president of environmental health and engineering for the organization, said in a statement.\n\nThe pilot, 34-year-old Chad Antill of Nome, was also killed. The other victims ranged in age from 30 to 58 years old.\n\nThe flight was a regularly scheduled commuter trip, according to Lt. Ben Endres of the Alaska State Troopers.\n\nA photo provided by the Coast Guard showed the plane‚Äôs splintered body and debris lying on the sea ice. Two people in brightly colored emergency gear circled the wreckage.\n\nWhat we know:\n\nThe Bering Air single-engine turboprop plane was traveling from Unalakleet to the hub community of Nome when it disappeared Thursday afternoon. It was found the next day after an extensive search with all nine passengers and the pilot dead, making it one of the deadliest plane crashes in the state in 25 years.\n\nRELATED: Missing plane in Alaska located: 3 bodies found in crash, officials say\n\nAs the community tried to process the deadly event, crews worked swiftly on unstable, slushy sea ice to recover the bodies and the wreckage. The National Weather Service issued a winter weather advisory, with snow and winds up to 45 miles per hour (72 kilometers per hour) expected to hit the region Saturday night, lasting into Sunday evening.\n\nWhat we don't know:\n\nThe aircraft is on an ice floe that is drifting about 5 miles (8 kilometers) a day, creating difficult conditions for recovery crews, said National Transportation Safety Board chair Jennifer Homendy during a press conference Saturday afternoon.\n\n\"Please know that we'll work diligently to determine how this happened with the ultimate goal of improving safety in Alaska and across the United States,\" said Homendy.\n\nThe backstory:\n\nThe Cessna Caravan left Unalakleet at 2:37 p.m. Thursday, and officials lost contact with it less than an hour later, according to David Olson, director of operations for Bering Air. There was light snow and fog, with a temperature of 17 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 8.3 degrees Celsius), according to the National Weather Service.\n\nThe Coast Guard said the aircraft went missing about 30 miles (48 kilometers) southeast of Nome.\n\nRadar forensic data provided by the U.S. Civil Air Patrol indicated that about 3:18 p.m., the plane had \"some kind of event which caused them to experience a rapid loss in elevation and a rapid loss in speed,\" Coast Guard Lt. Cmdr. Benjamin McIntyre-Coble said. \"What that event is, I can't speculate to.\"\n\nMcIntyre-Coble said he was unaware of any distress signals from the aircraft. Planes carry an emergency locating transmitter. If exposed to seawater, the device sends a signal to a satellite, which then relays that message back to the Coast Guard to indicate an aircraft may be in distress. No such messages were received by the Coast Guard, he said.\n\nRescuers were searching the aircraft‚Äôs last known location by helicopter when the wreckage was spotted, said Mike Salerno, a spokesperson for the U.S. Coast Guard. Two rescue swimmers were lowered to investigate.\n\nThe National Transportation Safety Board was sending nine people to the scene from various states.\n\nDig deeper:\n\nThe plane's crash marks the third major U.S. aviation mishap in eight days. A commercial jetliner and an Army helicopter collided near the nation‚Äôs capital on Jan. 29, killing 67 people. A medical transportation plane crashed in Philadelphia on Jan. 31, killing the six people on board and another person on the ground.\n\nBering Air serves 32 villages in western Alaska from hubs in Nome, Kotzebue and Unalakleet. Most destinations receive twice-daily scheduled flights Monday through Saturday.\n\n\"Our hearts are heavy with grief as we process this heartbreaking news,\" Bering Air wrote in a statement on its website. \"At this time, our thoughts are with the families and loved ones of those affected by this tragedy.\"\n\nUnalakleet is a community of about 690 people about 150 miles (about 240 kilometers) southeast of Nome and 395 miles (about 640 kilometers) northwest of Anchorage. The village is on the Iditarod trail, route of the world's most famous sled dog race, during which mushers and their teams must cross the frozen Norton Sound.\n\nNome, a Gold Rush town, is just south of the Arctic Circle and is known as the ending point of the 1,000-mile (1,610-kilometer) Iditarod. The city said prayer vigils would be held Friday for those on board the plane, friends and family and those involved in search efforts.",

Elez had access to a sensitive Treasury system processing trillions in payments, sparking concerns about government oversight. A federal judge has temporarily restricted access to the Treasury system following legal challenges over privacy violations.\n\n\n\nMarko Elez, a key staffer on Elon Musk‚Äôs federal cost-cutting initiative, resigned Thursday after past racist posts from his social media accounts resurfaced.\n\nThe resignation came after The Wall Street Journal and NPR reported on posts advocating racism, eugenics, and hostility toward Indian software engineers, which had been archived before the account was deleted.\n\nWhat did the resurfaced posts say?\n\nThe backstory:\n\nElez, who worked inside the Treasury Department as part of Musk‚Äôs Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), was linked to a now-deleted X account that made multiple racist and inflammatory statements. The Wall Street Journal reviewed archived posts from the account, including:\n\n\"Just for the record, I was racist before it was cool.\" (July 2024)\n\n\"You could not pay me to marry outside of my ethnicity.\" (September 2024)\n\n\"Normalize Indian hate.\" (September 2024)\n\n\"99% of Indian H1Bs will be replaced by slightly smarter LLMs, they‚Äôre going back don‚Äôt worry guys.\" (December 2024)\n\n\"I would not mind at all if Gaza and Israel were both wiped off the face of the Earth.\" (June 2024)\n\nElon Musk, who leads the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), is facing renewed scrutiny after a key staffer resigned over resurfaced racist social media posts.

However, on Thursday, a U.S. District Court judge ruled that Elez could retain access but with restrictions on data sharing. Elez resigned later that day, The Wall Street Journal reported.\n\nTreasury Secretary defends DOGE staff\n\nWhat they're saying:\n\nWhile Elez‚Äôs resignation has added more scrutiny to DOGE, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent defended the broader team‚Äôs role in the government overhaul.\n\n\"This is not some roving band running around doing things,\" Bessent told Bloomberg on Thursday. \"These are highly trained professionals.\"\n\nDespite Bessent‚Äôs assurances, lawmakers and legal experts continue to question DOGE‚Äôs influence and whether Musk‚Äôs team has unchecked authority to restructure federal agencies.",

What a GREAT Team, Coach, Quarterback, and virtually everything else, including those fantastic FANS, that voted for me (MAGA!) in record numbers.\"\n\nTrump even extended his congratulations to the Buffalo Bills for their \"tremendous season.\"\n\nHowever, the same can not be said for the Eagles, who have yet to be mentioned by the president days later.\n\nMany are speculating that the snub could be in response to the Eagles' White House controversy after their 2017 Super Bowl win.\n\nThe backstory:\n\nIn 2018, the Eagles trip to the White House to celebrate their victory against the New England Patriots was ultimately canceled.\n\nThe controversy began when several players and officials decided not to attend, leaving just two players actually planning to make the trip to Washington.\n\nTrump rescinded his invitation, tying the dispute to his criticism of players who kneeled during the national anthem:\n\n\"The Philadelphia Eagles are unable to come to the White House with their full team to be celebrated tomorrow.

Hurts threw for 221 yards.\n\n\"This is the ultimate team game. You can‚Äôt be great without the greatness of others. Great performance by everybody ‚Äî offense, defense, special teams,\" coach Nick Sirianni said. \"We didn‚Äôt really ever care what anyone thought about how we won, or their opinions. All we want to do is win.\"\n\nSuper Bowl LIX recap:\n\nThe Eagles outplayed Kansas City in every facet, delighting a raucous pro-Philly crowd that celebrated each score with a familiar rendition of \"Fly! Eagles! Fly!\"\n\nEven Taylor Swift‚Äôs presence couldn‚Äôt help the Chiefs. They lost for the first time in 10 games this season with the pop superstar in a suite watching boyfriend Travis Kelce, who didn‚Äôt catch a pass until late in the third quarter.\n\nNot in Kansas City‚Äôs worst nightmares could its fans have imagined such a lackluster performance. The Chiefs had won three of the previous five Super Bowls, losing 31-9 to Tom Brady and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers four years ago.\n\nMahomes was 8-0 against Fangio‚Äôs defenses before the longtime coordinator and former Broncos head coach outcoached Andy Reid, capping his first season with his hometown team. Reid fell to 3-3 in Super Bowls, including a loss with the Eagles.\n\nThe Eagles sacked Mahomes six times, the most of his career, including 2 1/2 by Sweat. And they did it without Fangio calling a single blitz.\n\n\"Defense wins championships,\" Hurts said. \"We saw how they played today. We saw the difference they made in the game. They gave us opportunities, gave us short fields. And we‚Äôre able to do what we do.\"\n\nBarkley, the 2024 AP NFL Offensive Player of the Year, only had 31 yards rushing in the first half when Philly built a 24-0 lead.\n\nThe Chiefs were aiming to become the third team in NFL history to win three straight championships and the first to three-peat in the Super Bowl era.\n\nHurts nearly led the Eagles to victory against the Chiefs two years ago in Arizona, but Mahomes led a comeback and Harrison Butker kicked the game-winning field goal in the final minute for a 38-35 victory. Mahomes rallied Kansas City to an overtime victory over San Francisco last year for the Chiefs' second straight title.\n\n\"That‚Äôs a great football team and we had to come out and play our best, and we did,\" Sirianni said.\n\nThis time, a revamped Philly defense featuring eight new starters from the 2022 team made sure Mahomes had no chance to pull off his magic.\n\n\"Today was a rough day all around. Nothing went right. I didn‚Äôt coach well. Proud of our guys for fighting. We will learn from this,\" Reid said. \"Too many turnovers, too many penalties. Against a good football team, can‚Äôt do that.\"\n\nSirianni, who mocked fans chanting \"Fire Nick!\" during a victory over Cleveland in October and was called a \"clown\" on national television, should finally silence critics by adding a championship ring to a resume that includes the fifth-best winning percentage in league history.\n\nSirianni was showered with Gatorade with nearly three minutes left in the game while backup QB Kenny Pickett took snaps in mop-up duty.\n\nBarkley helped push Hurts into the end zone from the 1 to give Philadelphia a 7-0 lead in the first quarter.\n\nUp 10-0 after Jake Elliott‚Äôs 48-yard field goal, Sweat and Jalyx Hunt sacked Mahomes on consecutive plays. Mahomes then rolled out and made an errant throw that was picked by DeJean, who returned it 38 yards for a 17-0 lead.\n\nIt was Mahomes‚Äô first pick-6 in 21 career playoff games and ended a streak of 297 straight passes without an interception.\n\nAll-Pro linebacker Zack Baun picked Mahomes again late in the second quarter, and Hurts connected with A.J. Brown on a 12-yard TD pass for a 24-0 lead.\n\nHurts threw a perfect 46-yard TD pass to DeVonta Smith to make it 34-0 late in the third.\n\nMahomes fired a 24-yard TD pass to Xavier Worthy to avoid the shutout, but the 2-point conversion failed. He threw two late, mostly meaningless TD passes, one to DeAndre Hopkins and another to Worthy.\n\nHurts named Super Bowl MVP:\n\nWhile Hurts wasn't asked to do too much on a dominant defensive night for Philadelphia, he came through at nearly every opportunity when he was needed as the calm he has shown throughout his career was evident on football's biggest stage.\n\nHe went 17 for 22 for 221 yards and two touchdowns, and ran for 72 yards and a touchdown in a 40-22 win over Patrick Mahomes and the Chiefs that avenged a Super Bowl loss two years ago against Kansas City.\n\nHurts was outstanding in that game, throwing for 304 yards and a TD and rushing for 70 yards and three more scores but could only watch as Harrison Butker kicked a go-ahead field goal with 8 seconds left for a 38-35 win.\n\nHurts turned that year into a $255 million, five-year contract the following offseason but it didn't quiet the critics who questioned whether Hurts was holding back the Eagles offense at various points the past two years.\n\nFeatured article\n\nOutside of an early interception against the Chiefs ‚Äî his first since Week 10 against Dallas ‚Äî Hurts was nearly flawless against Steve Spagnuolo's defense.\n\nHe converted scrambles when he faced pressure and kept finding open receivers, with his 46-yard deep shot to DeVonta Smith making it 34-0 in the third quarter, providing an exclamation point to a lopsided Super Bowl win.\n\nHurts also threw a 12-yard touchdown pass to A.J. Brown late in the first half and scored on a 1-yard tush push for the first score of the game, leading to a statistical performance achieved only by Hall of Famer Joe Montana in Super Bowl history.\n\nThe two are the only quarterbacks to throw for at least 200 yards and two TDs, rush for at least 50 yards and a score with Montana doing it in Super Bowl 19 against Miami.\n\nHurts is now just the fourth quarterback ever to lose his first Super Bowl start and go on to win one as a starter later in his career, joining Hall of Famers John Elway, Bob Griese and Len Dawson.\n\nChiefs denied 'threepeat':\n\nThe Green Bay Packers are the only NFL team to win three championships in a row, doing it from 1929-31 and 1965-67.\n\nThe NBA‚Äôs Los Angeles Lakers from 2000-02, led by Kobe Bryant and Shaquille O‚ÄôNeill, are the last team in the major American professional leagues to win three straight titles.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report",
