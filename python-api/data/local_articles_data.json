        "content": "Investors dumped stocks on Wall Street late Monday after President Donald Trump said his threatened tariffs on Canada and Mexico would go forward as planned early Tuesday.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped about 800 points, or 1.8%. The S&P 500 fell 2.1% and was set for its worst day of the year. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite slid 3%, weighed down by a separate issue affecting Nvidia, which was already down more than 9%.\n\nSpeaking at the White House alongside Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, the president said the clock had run out on finding concessions for America's two-largest trading partners to avoid sweeping new trade duties.\n\n“No room left for Mexico or for Canada,” Trump said. “Tomorrow, tariffs, 25% on Canada and 25% on Mexico, and that will start.”\n\nGet top local stories in Philly delivered to you every morning. Sign up for NBC Philadelphia's News Headlines newsletter.\n\nHe said he's also imposing an additional 10% tariff on China, on top of the 10% hike he recently instituted, which has already drawn retaliation from Beijing.\n\nTrump also reiterated that previously announced \"reciprocal\" tariffs would be coming on April 2. And in a post on his Truth Social platform earlier in the day, the president said tariffs on \"external product\" from the agriculture industry would also be imposed that day, without offering further details.\n\nTariffs or customs duties are a tax on products purchased from abroad, and they are used by practically all countries\n\nEven before his remarks, new economic data sounded fresh warnings about the solidity of the U.S. economy. A measure of manufacturing activity showed a jump in suppliers' costs, sparked in part by trade concerns.\n\n“The incoming tariffs are causing our products to increase in price. Sweeping price increases are incoming from suppliers,\" one executive at a machinery firm told the Institute of Supply Management for its monthly survey. \"Most are noting increases in labor costs,” a respondent in the machinery sector said.\n\nMonday's stock market selloff erases a strong start to the year for Wall Street, where many had greeted the onset of the new Trump administration with enthusiasm due to expected deregulation and tax cuts. After rising as much as 5% so far this year, the Dow is now only about 1% higher than where it began 2025.\n\nAlready, closely watched signs of consumers' expectations have softened, and retail sales posted a sharp decline last month. Major brands including Walmart are warning that the new administration's trade policies could dent their business in the months ahead, although some — such as Chipotle — so far say they plan to eat the expected costs.\n\nNBC News' Brian Cheung contributed.\n\nThis story first appeared on NBCNews.com.

        "content": "President Donald Trump's long-threatened tariffs against Canada and Mexico finally went into effect Tuesday, putting global markets on edge and setting up costly retaliations by the United States’ North American allies.\n\nStarting just past midnight, imports from Canada and Mexico are now to be taxed at 25%, with Canadian energy products getting tariffed at 10%. In addition, the 10% tariff that Trump placed on Chinese imports in February is doubling to 20%.\n\nIn response, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said his country would slap tariffs on more than $100 billion of American goods over the course of 21 days.\n\nChina announced Tuesday it will impose additional tariffs of up to 15% on imports of key U.S. farm products, including chicken, pork, soy and beef.\n\nGet top local stories in Philly delivered to you every morning. Sign up for NBC Philadelphia's News Headlines newsletter.\n\nThe tariffs announced by the Commerce Ministry are due to take effect from March 10. They follow U.S. President Donald Trump’s order to raise tariffs on imports of Chinese products to 20% across the board. Those took effect on Tuesday.\n\nImports of U.S. grown chicken, wheat, corn and cotton will face an extra 15% tariff, it said. The tariff on sorghum, soybeans, pork, beef, seafoods, fruit, vegetables and dairy products will be increased by 10%.\n\nMexico has yet to respond to the tariffs.\n\nThe U.S. president's moves raised fears of higher inflation and the prospect of a devastating trade war even as he promised the American public that taxes on imports are the easiest path to national prosperity. He has shown a willingness to buck the warnings of mainstream economists and put his own public approval on the line, believing that tariffs can fix what ails the country.\n\n“It’s a very powerful weapon that politicians haven’t used because they were either dishonest, stupid or paid off in some other form,\" Trump said Monday at the White House. \"And now we’re using them.”\n\nThe Canada and Mexico tariffs were originally supposed to begin in February, but Trump agreed to a 30-day suspension to negotiate further with the two largest U.S. trading partners. The stated reason for the tariffs is to address drug trafficking and illegal immigration, and both countries say they've made progress on those issues. But Trump has also said the tariffs will only come down if the U.S. trade imbalance closes, a process unlikely to be settled on a political timeline.\n\nThere is the possibility of the tariffs being short-lived if the U.S. economy suffers, just as there is the possibility of more tariffs to come on the European Union, India, computer chips, autos and pharmaceutical drugs, as Trump has promised. The American president has injected a disorienting volatility into the world economy, leaving it off balance as people wonder what he’ll do next.\n\n“It’s chaotic, especially compared to the way we saw tariffs rolled out in the first (Trump) administration,\" said Michael House, co-chair of the international trade practice at the Perkins Coie law firm. \"It’s unpredictable. We don’t know, in fact, what the president will do.’’\n\nDemocratic lawmakers were quick to criticize the tariffs, but even some Republican senators raised alarms.\n\nSen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, said she’s “very concerned” about the tariffs going into effect because of her state’s proximity to Canada.\n\nThe Trump administration has directed a “pause” to U.S. assistance to Ukraine after a disastrous Oval Office meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy last week.\n\n“Maine and Canada’s economy are integrated,” Collins said, explaining that much of the state’s lobsters and blueberries are processed in Canada and then sent back to the U.S.\n\nThe world economy is now caught in the fog of what appears to be a trade war.\n\nEven after Trump announced Monday that the tariffs were going forward, Canadian officials were still in touch with their U.S. counterparts.\n\n“The dialogue will continue, but we are ready to respond,” Canadian Defense Minister Bill Blair said in Ottawa as he went into a special Cabinet meeting on U.S.-Canada relations. “There are still discussions taking place.”\n\nShortly after Blair spoke, Trudeau said Canada would put 25% tariffs against $155 billion Canadian ($107 billion U.S.) of American goods, starting with tariffs on $30 billion Canadian ($21 billion U.S.) worth of goods immediately and on the remaining amount on American products in three weeks.\n\n“Our tariffs will remain in place until the U.S. trade action is withdrawn, and should U.S. tariffs not cease, we are in active and ongoing discussions with provinces and territories to pursue several non-tariff measures,” Trudeau said.\n\nTo resolve the tariffs being imposed Tuesday, the White House would like to see a drop in the seizures of fentanyl inside the United States, not just on the northern and southern borders. Administration officials say that seizures of fentanyl last month in everywhere from Louisiana to New Jersey had ties to foreign cartels.\n\nDamon Pike, technical practice leader for customs and trade services at the tax and consulting firm BDO, suggested that how other countries respond to the tariffs with their own import taxes could escalate the tensions and possibly increase the economic pain points.\n\n“Canada has their list ready,\" Pike said. \"The EU has their list ready. It’s going to be tit for tat.’’\n\nThe Trump administration has suggested that inflation will not be as bad as economists claim, saying that tariffs give a reason for foreign companies to open factories in the United States. On Monday, Trump announced that Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, the computer chipmaker, would be investing $100 billion in domestic production.\n\nStill, it can take time to relocate factories spread across the world and train workers with the skills they need.\n\nGreg Ahearn, president and CEO of The Toy Association, said the 20% tariffs on Chinese goods will be “crippling” for the toy industry, as nearly 80% of toys sold in the U.S. are made in China.\n\n“There’s a sophistication of manufacturing, of the tooling,” he said. “There’s a lot of handcrafting that is part of these toys that a lot of people don’t understand … the face painting, the face masks, the hair weaving, the hair braiding, the cut and sew for plush to get it to look just so. All of that are very high hands, skilled labor that has been passed through generations in the supply chain that exists with China.\"\n\nFor a president who has promised quick results, Ahearn added a note of caution about how quickly U.S. factories could match their Chinese rivals.\n\n\"That can’t be replicated overnight,” he said.\n\n___\n\nGillies reported from Toronto.

        "source": "https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/",
        "content": "The head of the FBI's New York Field Office was forced out of the bureau on Monday, a month after saying he was going to \"dig in\" following the Trump administration's removal of senior FBI leaders and requests for the names of all agents who worked on Jan. 6 cases, five sources familiar with the matter told NBC News.\n\nTwo of the sources said Assistant Director in Charge James Dennehy, a highly respected leader, was given a choice to resign or be fired. He was eligible for retirement and has officially retired.\n\nIn an email to colleagues on Monday announcing his retirement, Dennehy said he was forced out.\n\n\"I've been told many times in my life, ‘When you find yourself in a hole, sometimes it's best to quit digging.’ Screw that. I will never stop defending this joint,\" he wrote in the email, noting that he was \"not given a reason\" for the decision.\n\nGet top local stories in Philly delivered to you every morning. Sign up for NBC Philadelphia's News Headlines newsletter.\n\nHe went on to say he has \"an immense feeling of pride — to have represented an office of professionals who will always do the right thing for the right reasons.\"\n\nDennehy urged FBI employees to protect the bureau from political interference. After FBI agents surveilled and smeared members of political groups viewed as \"subversive\" by longtime FBI director J. Edgar Hoover during the Cold War, a series of reforms were enacted to ensure that the bureau not be used by elected leaders to retaliate against their political enemies.\n\nDennehy urged his colleagues to maintain those values.\n\nIn an email to his staff in February, Dennehy wrote that agents within the bureau \"find ourselves in the middle of a battle of our own as good people are being walked out of the FBI,\" as top leaders were resisting a request from the Trump Justice Department to turn over the names of all FBI employees who worked on the Capitol riot investigations.\n\n\"Others are being targeted because they did their jobs in accordance with the law and FBI policy,\" his February email stated.\n\n“Time for me to dig in,” Dennehy wrote.\n\nThe list eventually was turned over — first without the names, but later the names were also sent. But it's widely believed inside the FBI that the resistance by Dennehy, along with the acting director Brian Driscoll and acting deputy director Rob Kissane — prevented a mass firing of people associated with the Jan. 6th cases.\n\nThe move comes amid intense unease in the bureau, which will be headed by two Trump loyalists: Patel, a former federal prosecutor, Congressional staffer and national security official, and Dan Bongino, a right-wing podcast host and former Secret Service Agent and New York police officer who has accused the FBI of staging the Jan. 6 assault on the Capitol.\n\nFBI special agents expressed shock over the announcement that Bongino would take over the deputy director role, where he'll oversee the bureau's day-to-day operations. The announcement came just after the Senate confirmed Patel as the bureau's director in a largely party-line vote.\n\nTrump has promised to fire \"some\" FBI special agents who worked Jan. 6 cases, claiming, without citing specific evidence, that they were \"corrupt.\"\n\nOn Friday, Interim U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia Ed Martin demoted several top officials in that office, including high-ranking prosecutors who had worked key cases against Jan. 6 rioters and other Trump supporters.\n\nTrump has nominated Martin — a \"stop the steal\" organizer who was on the grounds of the Capitol on Jan. 6 and who represented several Capitol attack defendants — to permanently run the U.S. Attorney's Office in the nation's capitol.\n\nDennehy spent six years in the Marine Corps before joining the FBI after 9/11, according to his LinkedIn resume. At the bureau he specialized in weapons counterproliferation, and spent time in management roles in both the Washington D.C. and New York field offices before being promoted to lead the New York office in 2022.\n\nBefore signing off his email with the Marine Corp motto \"Semper Fidelis,\" he listed what he would miss about being part of the FBI.\n\nRead his full message to colleagues below:\n\nAll,\n\nLate Friday, I was informed that I needed to put my retirement papers in today, which I just did. I was not given a reason for this decision.\n\nRegardless, I apologize to all of you for not being able to fulfill my commitment to you to serve as ADIC NY for at least two years. But as I leave today, I have an immense feeling of pride - to have represented an office of professionals who will always do the right thing for the right reasons; who will always seek the truth while upholding the rule of law; who will always follow the facts no matter where they lead and be unapologetic about it; who will never bend, break, falter, or quit on your integrity; who will always handle cases and evidence with an overabundance of caution and care for the innocent, the victims, and the process first; and who will always remain independent.\n\nSo with that, here is my final Top 10 list:\n\nTop 10 Things I'll Miss about the FBI\n\n10. The commute to work. NOT.\n\n9. The investigations. Doesn't matter what squad you are on - the work is the best in the world.\n\n8. The intensity. You have to be in it to realize what I mean. But we all know how significant what we do is.\n\n7. The FBI brand. Do not fret. Those three letters still mean something - and there is only a select group of folks in this world, past and present, who can say they're with the FBI. Be proud of that.\n\n6. The camaraderie - within our own Bureau family, and with all law enforcement - local, state, federal, and international. There is no better fraternity in the world.\n\n5. The opportunity to put on a suit and tie to conduct interviews in the morning, throw on some street clothes to conduct surveillance in the afternoon, debrief a sensitive source in a safehouse overnight, and then get up early for a SWAT arrest the next morning. Then rinse and repeat.\n\n4. The badge. What it took to earn it and what it means to carry it.\n\n3. The independence. We will not bend. We will not falter. We will not sacrifice what is right for anything or anyone.\n\n2. The impact. Our work helps shape foreign policy, community awareness, international relations, wartime decisions, and public safety. Every. Single. Day.\n\n1. All of you - every single one of you who has earned your position within this phenomenal organization.\n\nI've been told many times in my life, \"When you find yourself in a hole, sometimes it's best to quit digging.\" Screw that. I will never stop defending this joint. I'll just do it willingly and proudly from outside the wire.\n\nSemper Fidelis,\n\nJD",

They included selecting someone who is already traveling outside of the Washington D.C. area during the speech; someone who is not directly associated to the topics of the issues mentioned in the speech; someone who has not already been asked to serve as designated survivor; someone who has not served in Congress.\n\nWhat is the presidential order of succession?\n\nBelow is the presidential order of succession in the event the president of the United States becomes incapacitated, dies, resigns, is unable to hold office or is removed from office, per the Constitution and the Presidential Succession Act of 1947.\n\nVice President\n\nSpeaker of the House\n\nPresident Pro Tempore of the Senate\n\nSecretary of State\n\nSecretary of the Treasury\n\nSecretary of Defense\n\nAttorney General\n\nSecretary of the Interior\n\nSecretary of Agriculture\n\nSecretary of Commerce\n\nSecretary of Labor\n\nSecretary of Health and Human Services\n\nSecretary of Housing and Urban Development\n\nSecretary of Transportation\n\nSecretary of Energy\n\nSecretary of Education\n\nSecretary of Veterans Affairs\n\nSecretary of Homeland Security\n\nWhen is the designated survivor chosen?\n\nPrevious designated survivors have said they were informed of their role days or weeks before the event was to take place. They are not revealed publicly until during or after the event.\n\nWhere is the designated survivor?\n\nThe designated survivor watches the speech from a secure location, which prior to the Sept. 11 2001 attacks was occasionally of their own choosing.\n\nJohn Block, Ronald Reagan's agricultural secretary, carried out his role as designated survivor in 1986 from a villa in Jamaica.\n\nDan Glickman, Bill Clinton’s agriculture secretary, served as designated survivor in 1997 at his daughter's New York City apartment alongside Secret Service members.\n\nBill Richardson, Clinton's energy secretary, moved up a planned 2000 weekend trip with his wife to Oxford, Maryland so he’d be there as designated survivor during the State of the Union.\n\nAlberto Gonzales, George W. Bush’s attorney general, was designated survivor in 2007 while in flight, departing from Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland.\n\nWho was the first designated survivor?\n\nSelecting a failsafe that has become informally known as a designated survivor dates to the late 1950s during the Cold War amid the threat of the Soviets targeting Washington D.C. with nuclear weapons. A designated survivor was not publicly acknowledged by name until 1981 when education secretary Terrel Bell was not in attendance for President Ronald Reagan's joint address to Congress.\n\nWho was the last designated survivor?\n\nA designated survivor was not selected for Donald Trump's inauguration in January. The last person to carry out the role was Miguel Cardona, the former Secretary of Education under former President Joe Biden, in March 2024 during the State of the Union address.\n\nWhich position is most commonly selected as designated survivor?\n\nThe most common secretary to serve as designated survivor since 1984 is the secretary of the interior, which was been selected seven times, according to The American Presidency Project by the University of California.\n\nWho has been designated survivor for Donald Trump?\n\nHere are the designated survivors selected during Donald Trump's first term, according to The American Presidency Project:\n\n2017 -- Secretary of Veterans Affairs David Shulkin\n\n2018 -- Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue\n\n2019 -- Secretary of Energy Rick Perry\n\n2020 -- Secretary of the Interior David Bernhardt\n\nHas a designated survivor ever become president?\n\nOnly Kiefer Sutherland, the actor whose character became president in the television series aptly named \"Designated Survivor.\"\n\nThe Trump administration has directed a “pause” to U.S. assistance to Ukraine after a disastrous Oval Office meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy last week.",

        "content": "President Donald Trump, in a joint address to Congress on Tuesday night, is expected to lay out his efforts to rapidly slash the size of the federal government in ways critics warn overstep his authority and threaten lasting damage.\n\nThe speech comes as Trump is making a sharp break from the previous administration, both on the international and domestic fronts. On Friday, Trump and Vice President JD Vance had a heated confrontation with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in the Oval Office, rocking international relations and prompting concerns from critics that the White House is moving away from a democratic ally and hewing closer to Russia, an authoritarian adversary.\n\nTuesday's speech — Trump's first address to Congress of his second term — gives him the opportunity to further justify the shake-ups, both at home and abroad, to lawmakers and the public, and to preview what's coming next.\n\nThe president plans to use the address to tout what he views as his administration's initial successes, while also hosting guests the White House said benefited from Trump's first term, according to an administration official and a senior White House official.\n\nGet top local stories in Philly delivered to you every morning. Sign up for NBC Philadelphia's News Headlines newsletter.\n\nThe theme of Trump’s speech is “the renewal of the American Dream,” a senior administration official said.\n\nThe president is likely to focus his remarks on immigration, new tariffs and the Department of Government Efficiency's efforts to slash budgets and fire federal workers, as well as the administration's efforts to eliminate diversity, equity and inclusion programs in the federal government, a senior administration official told NBC News last week.\n\nElon Musk, who has spearheaded DOGE’s efforts despite not being the acting administrator of the initiative, will attend the speech, according to a White House official.\n\n“There will be a lot of surprises and a lot of made-for-TV moments,” another administration official said.\n\nIn his last joint address to Congress, his 2020 State of the Union speech, Trump awarded right-wing talk show host Rush Limbaugh the Medal of Freedom — the country’s highest civilian honor. (Limbaugh, 70, died a year later.)\n\nTrump may not travel the country to amplify his message in the days after the address, as is typical for presidents, according to a White House official. The official said that the president and his team believe he’s accomplishing much of his agenda from the White House, adding that they were comfortable with him explaining his message to Americans from his perch in the Oval Office.\n\n“The priority is making sure business here at the White House is settled,” the official said, adding that post-address plans could change.\n\nInstead, Vance will travel outside of Washington to highlight the key points in the president’s address, a senior administration official said. He will begin with a trip to the southern border Wednesday, according to a spokesperson for the vice president. Vance is expected to tour a processing facility in Eagle Pass, Texas, becoming the highest-ranking Trump administration official to visit the border so far during Trump’s second term.\n\nVance played a key role in Friday's combative meeting with Zelenskyy, an unprecedented public confrontation with a U.S. ally that was later cheered by current and former Russian officials. The move was slammed by Democrats, and many Republicans have since doubled down on the administration's criticisms of Zelenskyy.\n\nSen. Elissa Slotkin, of Michigan, will deliver the Democratic response to the joint address. The president's opposing party typically selects someone considered to be a rising political star to lay out the party's priorities and perspectives on the administration. Slotkin won Michigan's competitive open Senate seat in November, outperforming then-Vice President Kamala Harris in her presidential bid.\n\nSlotkin's speech will lean into her security background as a former CIA analyst, according to a source familiar with her speech, who said her background gives her a unique perspective on the Oval Office confrontation between Trump, Vance and Zelenskyy. The senator will also highlight a proactive economic vision and discuss what Democrats see as the path forward, the source said.\n\nMembers of Congress also typically invite guests to presidential joint addresses in an effort to highlight specific issues.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., asked the Democratic caucus to bring guests who \"have suffered under the Trump administration’s policies,\" according to a spokesperson. The spokesperson said that Schumer planned to bring two Medicaid recipients, a child with spinal muscular atrophy, whose survival was credited to a National Institutes of Health program, and two fired federal workers.\n\nTrump’s State of the Union speech in 2020 echoed campaign speeches, touting his economic and migration records just a month before the country ground to a halt because of Covid. At the end of his remarks, then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ripped up a copy of the president’s speech.\n\nThis story first appeared on NBCNews.com. More from NBC News:",

        "source": "https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/",
        "content": "Most of America “springs forward” Sunday for daylight saving time and losing that hour of sleep can do more than leave you tired and cranky the next day. It also could harm your health.\n\nDarker mornings and more evening light together knock your body clock out of whack — which means daylight saving time can usher in sleep trouble for weeks or longer. Studies have even found an uptick in heart attacks and strokes right after the March time change.\n\nThere are ways to ease the adjustment, including getting more sunshine to help reset your circadian rhythm for healthful sleep.\n\nWhen does daylight saving time start?\n\nGet top local stories in Philly delivered to you every morning. Sign up for NBC Philadelphia's News Headlines newsletter.\n\nDaylight saving time begins Sunday at 2 a.m., an hour of sleep vanishing in most of the U.S. The ritual will reverse on Nov. 2 when clocks “fall back” as daylight saving time ends.\n\nHawaii and most of Arizona don’t make the spring switch, sticking to standard time year-round along with Puerto Rico, American Samoa, Guam and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Worldwide, dozens of countries also observe daylight saving time, starting and ending at different dates.\n\nSome people try to prepare for daylight saving time’s sleep jolt by going to bed a little earlier two or three nights ahead. With a third of American adults already not getting the recommended seven hours of nightly shuteye, catching up can be difficult.\n\nWhat happens to your brain when it's lighter later?\n\nThe brain has a master clock that is set by exposure to sunlight and darkness. This circadian rhythm is a roughly 24-hour cycle that determines when we become sleepy and when we’re more alert. The patterns change with age, one reason that early-to-rise youngsters evolve into hard-to-wake teens.\n\nMorning light resets the rhythm. By evening, levels of a hormone called melatonin begin to surge, triggering drowsiness. Too much light in the evening — that extra hour from daylight saving time — delays that surge and the cycle gets out of sync.\n\nSleep deprivation is linked to heart disease, cognitive decline, obesity and numerous other problems. And that circadian clock affects more than sleep, also influencing things like heart rate, blood pressure, stress hormones and metabolism.\n\nHow does the time change affect your health?\n\nFatal car crashes temporarily jump the first few days after the spring time change, according to a study of U.S. traffic fatalities. The risk was highest in the morning, and researchers attributed it to sleep deprivation.\n\nThen there’s the cardiac connection. The American Heart Association points to studies that suggest an uptick in heart attacks on the Monday after daylight saving time begins, and in strokes for two days afterward.\n\nDoctors already know that heart attacks, especially severe ones, are a bit more common on Mondays generally — and in the morning, when blood is more clot-prone.\n\nResearchers don't know why the time change would add to that Monday connection but it's possible the abrupt circadian disruption exacerbates factors such as high blood pressure in people already at risk.\n\nBenjamin Franklin gets credit for a lot of things, but creating Daylight Saving Time shouldn’t be one of them.\n\nHow to prepare for daylight saving time\n\nGradually shift bedtimes about 15 or 20 minutes earlier for several nights before the time change, and rise earlier the next morning, too. Go outside for early morning sunshine that first week of daylight saving time, another way to help reset your body's internal clock. Moving up daily routines, like dinner time or when you exercise, also may help cue your body to start adapting, sleep experts advise.\n\nAfternoon naps and caffeine as well as evening light from phones and other electronic devices can make adjusting to an earlier bedtime even harder.\n\nWill the U.S. ever eliminate the time change?\n\nEvery year there's talk about ending the time change. In December, then-President-elect Donald Trump promised to eliminate daylight saving time. For the last several years, a bipartisan bill named the Sunshine Protection Act to make daylight saving time permanent has stalled in Congress; it has been reintroduced this year.\n\nBut that's the opposite of what some health groups recommend. The American Medical Association and American Academy of Sleep Medicine agree it's time to do away with time switches but say sticking with standard time year-round aligns better with the sun — and human biology — for more consistent sleep.",

        "content": "The Eagles are coming off a Super Bowl victory, which means they’re going to have to wait a while to make their first pick.\n\nThe last time the Birds won the Super Bowl they ended up trading out of pick 32 when the Ravens came calling about Lamar Jackson. So we know they’ll listen to offers if there’s a similar situation.\n\nBut there’s also an opportunity to land a good player if they stay at 32. Here’s a first-round mock draft:\n\n1. Titans: Cam Ward, QB, Miami\n\nGet top local stories in Philly delivered to you every morning. Sign up for NBC Philadelphia's News Headlines newsletter.\n\nThe Titans might be willing to trade out of this spot if they don’t completely fall in love with Ward but if they think he’s the best QB in this draft, they have to be willing to take him here. That doesn’t mean the Titans won’t think about a trade or thinking about picking Abdul Carter, but the most likely scenario is them sticking and picking Ward at this spot.\n\n2. Browns: Abdul Carter, Edge, Penn State\n\nThe Browns have tried to make it very clear that they aren’t interested in trading Myles Garrett but we’ll see what happens there. Either way, Carter is a generational talent at edge rusher. He will either be the replacement for Garrett or could be a dynamic rusher on the other side of the line.\n\n3. Giants: Shedeur Sanders, QB, Colorado\n\nThe Giants have to get a quarterback, right? Perhaps it’ll happen through a trade up to No. 1 to land Ward. But if not, can’t you just see Sanders ending up with the Giants? He’s the type of pick the Giants would hope to turn around a franchise that has been aimless in recent seasons. And he has the type of confidence to thrive with a ton of attention on him.\n\n4. Patriots: Travis Hunter, WR/CB, Colorado\n\nThe Patriots get one of the most talented players in this draft. Is he a receiver? Is he a cornerback? Figure it out later. Mike Vrabel can give Hunter a chance to major in one position and minor in the other. The Patriots seem to like Hunter quite a bit. They have less of a pressing need at cornerback because they already have Christian Gonzalez. But if there’s any coach willing to have Hunter play on both sides a bit, maybe it’s Vrabel. The former NFL linebacker played a bit on offense during his playing days.\n\n5. Jaguars: Mason Graham, DT, Michigan\n\nThe Jaguars could go offensive line here even without a super pressing need. But Graham’s value and a Jags’ need line up here. Graham was a stud at Michigan and is one of the most talented players overall in this class.\n\n6. Raiders: Tetairoa McMillan, WR, Arizona\n\nThe Raiders are a team that might be willing to trade up to find a quarterback. But with both of the top ones gone in this mock draft, they find a guy they hope will be their WR1 for years to come. McMillan (6-4, 219) is a big and rangey receiver who has drawn comparisons to Drake London. The Raiders need a WR1 ahead of Jakobi Meyers and Tre Tucker.\n\n7. Jets: Will Johnson, CB, Michigan\n\nThe Jets will ned to replace D.J. Reed if the veteran leaves in free agency and they can do that with the top cornerback in this year’s class. Pairing Johnson with Sauce Gardner can set up the Jets’ secondary for a long time. And new head coach Aaron Glenn is a former cornerback and DBs coach who might be able to get the most out of Johnson.\n\n8. Panthers: Mykel Williams, Edge, Georgia\n\nThe Panthers are a team with plenty of needs but generating more pass rush should be at the top of the list. Williams played most of the 2024 season with an ankle injury, which clearly affected him. If you look past that, Williams is a versatile rusher with a ton of physical traits that should be exciting for a team building again.\n\n9. Saints: Shemar Stewart, Edge, Texas A&M\n\nThe Saints desperately need to find more pass rush in 2025 and they’ll have an opportunity to do it here with a player who wowed at the Combine. Sure, the sack production in college wasn’t great but sometimes edge is a position where you draft traits. And Stewart’s athleticism popped in Indy.\n\n10. Bears: Will Campbell, OT, LSU\n\nThis would be a dream scenario for the Bears. They got their QB last year when they drafted Caleb Williams but they desperately need to find a way to protect him better. Some think Campbell is a guard in the NFL and some think he’s a tackle. The good news is that the Bears need help pretty much everywhere. Find his best spot, plug and play.\n\n11. 49ers: Kelvin Banks Jr., OT, Texas\n\nThe Niners need some help on their offensive line. Banks could fill in at right tackle but could also be the future replacement for Trent Williams, who will be 37 when the 2025 season begins.\n\n12. Cowboys: Ashton Jeanty, RB, Boise State\n\nThis one feels almost too obvious. You can certainly argue about the value of taking a running back at 12, especially given the expected depth at the position in this year’s class. But it’s hard to question Jeanty’s ability. He was the best running back in the country in 2024 and has an extremely high ceiling in the NFL. He’s already a great runner and has the ability to be a good pass catcher. The Cowboys have drafted a running back in the first round before and they could do it again after watching how much Saquon Barkley transformed the Eagles in 2024.\n\n13. Dolphins: Armand Membou, OT, Missouri\n\nThe Dolphins need to protect Tua Tagovailoa. Not only do the Dolphins need guards, but Terron Armstead doesn’t know if he wants to keep playing and the Dolphins are operating as if he won’t be back. So getting a guy like Membou would help. Some see him as a tackle and some see him as a guard. Membou doesn’t have great length, which has led to guard projections but some teams will still like him on the edge.\n\n14. Colts: Tyler Warren, TE, Penn State\n\nThe Colts get to sit there at 14 and take one of the best overall players in this draft and the type of player who could be a big difference maker in the career of QB Anthony Richardson. Shane Steichen would love to get a dual-threat playmaker like Warren on his team.\n\n15. Falcons: Jalon Walker, Edge, Georgia\n\nThe Falcons need some help on defense and Walker is an explosive and versatile player. He has played off-ball linebacker as well as edge rusher and his versatility is impressive. Walker has drawn Nolan Smith comps during this pre-draft process.\n\n16. Cardinals: Mike Green, Edge, Marshall\n\nIf you had concerns about Green’s level of competition, he was able to go to Senior Bowl and prove that he wasn’t lucky to lead the nation in sacks in 2024. The Cardinals could definitely use some firepower off the edge.\n\n17. Bengals: Walter Nolen, DT, Ole Miss\n\nThe Bengals could use a boost on the interior of their defensive line and a player like Nolen has the ability to be a disruptive interior pass rusher at the NFL level. Nolen (6-4, 296) should be a three-down player in the league.\n\n18. Seahawks: Tyler Booker, OL, Alabama\n\nIt might not always seem like the best idea to spend a big pick like this on a guy who is considered to be a guard-only prospect but if the Seahawks can plug-and-play Booker to protect Geno Smith, it makes a lot of sense. Booker feels like a pretty safe, high-floor pick.\n\n19. Buccaneers: Emeka Egbuka, WR, Ohio State\n\nMike Evans is winding down his Hall of Fame career and the Bucs will want to keep their offense rolling. It might not seem like their biggest need but landing a player like Egbuka (6-1, 202) would mean replenishing while also getting another weapon for Baker Mayfield. Egbuka can play inside or out and that versatility should help him fit in.\n\n20. Broncos: Colston Loveland, TE, Michigan\n\nThe Broncos’ top need happens to line up with good value to get Loveland at No. 20. He’d be an immediate difference maker for the Broncos offense.\n\n21. Steelers: Matthew Golden, WR, Texas\n\nGolden (5-11, 191) ran a blazing 4.29 at the Combine and has the versatility to play inside and outside at the next level. He can also stretch the field for a Steelers’ team that needs a reboot at the receiver position.\n\n22. Chargers: Kenneth Grant, DT Michigan\n\nGrant is an enormous interior defensive lineman at 6-foot-3, 342 pounds. He didn’t work out at the Combine because of a hamstring injury but is expected to show off what he can do at the Michigan pro day. Grant could be a difference-maker on the interior of that line.\n\n23. Packers: Jahdae Barron, CB, Texas\n\nThe future of Jaire Alexander in Green Bay is very much in question. While Barron might not be your prototypical outside CB1, he’s a versatile player for a defense that already has Xavier McKinney. It would be fun to watch a secondary with those two ballhawks.\n\n24. Vikings: Malaki Starks, S, Georgia\n\nIt’s hard to believe that Harrison Smith is 36 but he is and it’s time to replace him. Starks is a versatile defensive back who can play a few different positions on defense. He has been considered a first round pick for a long time.\n\n25. Texans: Luther Burden III, WR, Missouri\n\nBurden didn’t have a super productive year in 2024 but he was over 1,200 yards in 2023. And he went to the Combine this year and ran a 4.41. He’s an athletic and speedy inside-outside receiver for a team that could use some help, especially after Tank Dell’s season-ending injury in 2024.\n\n26. Rams: Josh Simmons, OT, Ohio State\n\nWe’ll see if the Rams are able to re-sign Alaric Jackson. But even if they do, Rob Havenstein is 32 now and it’s not a bad idea to think about the future. Simmons suffered a knee injury in October so his health is a question. But if the Rams are in a position to be patient with him, it could pay off in the long term.\n\n27. Ravens: Donovan Jackson, OL, Ohio State\n\nThe Ravens left side of the offensive line is heading toward free agency. So whether they see Jackson as a tackle or guard, he has a good chance of cracking the lineup in Year 1. Most seems to view Jackson as in interior lineman but he has played some tackle.\n\n28. Lions: James Pearce, Edge, Tennessee\n\nAt 6-foot-5, 245 pounds, Pearce had an eye-popping 40-yard dash of 4.47 seconds at the Combine. The Lions need to find an edge rusher to put opposite Aidan Hutchinson. At times, the pass rush was too much all about him in 2024. Pearce has some juice.\n\n29. Commanders: Omarion Hampton, RB, North Carolina\n\nThe Commanders have a fine running back in Brian Robinson Jr., but he’s not a game-changer. For an offense that was pretty dynamic with rookie Jayden Daniels in 2024, the thought of adding a weapon like Hampton to the mix is intriguing. He’s a big, bruising back who would basically be an easy upgrade over Robinson. After watching how Saquon Barkley changed everything for the Eagles, the Commanders try to get their own feature back.\n\n30. Bills: Jihaad Campbell, LB, Alabama\n\nThis isn’t an obvious need for the Bills but Matt Milano is 30 now and he has struggled to stay on the field the last two years. The Buffalo defense really misses him when he’s not out there. And Terrel Bernard is also entering the final year of his deal. Campbell has the ability to play off-ball but also rush the passer. He’s a unique player and if he somehow lasts this long into the first round, it would be an intriguing pairing with him and the Bills.\n\n31. Chiefs: Josh Conerly, OT, Oregon\n\nWe all watched Super Bowl LIX. The Chiefs need to figure out their left tackle spot. Joe Thuney held it together for a while but he got exposed in New Orleans. Conerly (6-5, 311) has the right frame and put together a strong Combine.\n\n32. Eagles: Donovan Ezeiruaku, Edge, Boston College\n\nThis pick makes a lot of sense and it goes beyond Ezieruaku’s ties to the area. (Ezierauku is from South Jersey and played at Williamstown High School.) The Eagles’ edge rusher position is in a state of flux this offseason. Josh Sweat is a free agent, Brandon Graham might retire and who knows what the Eagles will get out of Bryce Huff in 2025. That leaves the Eagles with just Nolan Smith and Jalyx Hunt. Edge rusher is too important of a position to not reload.\n\nAnd Ezeiruaku is worthy of a first-round pick. He had 16 1/2 sacks in 2024 but before you worry about the level of competition, Ezeiruaku went to the Senior Bowl and dominated and then followed it up with a strong performance in Indianapolis. At 6-2, 248 pounds, Ezeiruaku isn’t the biggest guy but his arms are 34 inches so he has sneaky length (69th percentile among edges). He also dominated the 3-cone (6.94) and short-shuttle (4.19) at the Combine.\n\nSubscribe to Eagle Eye anywhere you get your podcasts:\n\nApple Podcasts | YouTube Music | Spotify | Stitcher | Simplecast | RSS | Watch on YouTube",

And that’ll start,” Trump told reporters in the Roosevelt Room. “They’re going to have to have a tariff.”\n\nTrump has said the tariffs are to force the two U.S. neighbors to step up their fight against fentanyl trafficking and stop illegal immigration. But Trump has also indicated that he wants to even the trade imbalance with both countries as well and push more factories to relocate in the United States.\n\nHis comments quickly rattled the U.S. stock market, with the S&P 500 index down 2% in Monday afternoon trading. It's a sign of the political and economic risks that Trump feels compelled to take, given the possibility of higher inflation and the possible demise of a decades-long trade partnership with Mexico and Canada.\n\nGet top local stories in Philly delivered to you every morning. Sign up for NBC Philadelphia's News Headlines newsletter.\n\nTariffs or customs duties are a tax on products purchased from abroad, and they are used by practically all countries\n\nYet the Trump administration remains confident that tariffs are the best choice to boost U.S. manufacturing and attract foreign investment. Before Trump's statement on tariffs in response to a question on Tuesday, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said that the computer chipmaker TSMC had expanded its investment in the United States because of the possibility of separate 25% tariffs.\n\nIn February, Trump put a 10% tariff on imports from China and reemphasized on Monday that the rate would be doubling to 20% on Tuesday.\n\nTrump provided a one-month delay in February as both Mexico and Canada promised concessions. But Trump said Monday that there was “no room left for Mexico or for Canada” to avoid the steep new tariffs, which were also set to tax Canadian energy products such as oil and electricity at a lower 10% rate.\n\n“If Trump is imposing tariffs, we are ready,\" said Canadian Foreign Minister Mélanie Joly. \"We are ready with $155 billion worth of tariffs and we’re ready with the first tranche of tariffs, which is $30 billion.”\n\nJoly said Canada has a very strong border plan and explained that to Trump administration officials last week. She said the diplomatic efforts are continuing. She spoke after Trump made his comments Tuesday.\n\nMexico President Claudia Sheinbaum went into Monday waiting to see what Trump would say.\n\n“It’s a decision that depends on the United States government, on the United States president,” Sheinbaum said ahead of Trump's statement. “So whatever his decision is, we will make our decisions and there is a plan, there is unity in Mexico.”\n\nBoth countries have tried to show action in response to Trump's concerns. Mexico sent 10,000 National Guard troops to their shared border to crack down on drug trafficking and illegal immigration. Canada named a fentanyl czar, even though smuggling of the drug from Canada into the United States appears to be relatively modest.\n\nAs late as Sunday, it remained unclear what choice Trump would make on tariff rates. Lutnick told Fox News Channel’s “Sunday Morning Futures” that the decision was “fluid.”\n\n“He’s sort of thinking about right now how exactly he wants to play it with Mexico and Canada,” Lutnick said. “And that is a fluid situation. There are going to be tariffs on Tuesday on Mexico and Canada. Exactly what they are, we’re going to leave that for the president and his team to negotiate.”\n\nTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Mexico has also offered to place 20% taxes on all imports from China as part of talks with the United States.\n\nBessent told CBS News on Sunday that China would “eat” the cost of the tariffs, instead of passing them along to the U.S. businesses and consumers that import their products in the form of higher prices.\n\nBut companies ranging from Ford to Walmart have warned about the negative impact that tariffs could create for their businesses. Similarly, multiple analyses by the Peterson Institute for International Economics and the Yale University Budget Lab suggest that an average family could face price increases of more than $1,000.\n\nTrump also plans to roll out what he calls “reciprocal” tariffs on April that would match the rate charged by other countries, including any subsidies and and value added taxes charged by those countries.\n\nThe U.S. president has already announced the removal of exemptions from his 2018 tariffs on steel and aluminum, in addition to tariffs on autos, computer chips, copper and pharmaceutical drugs.",

        "content": "Extinction is still forever, but scientists at the biotech company Colossal Biosciences are trying what they say is the next best thing to restoring ancient beasts — genetically engineering living animals with qualities to resemble extinct species like the woolly mammoth.\n\nWoolly mammoths roamed the frozen tundras of Europe, Asia and North America until they went extinct around 4,000 years ago.\n\nColossal made a splash in 2021 when it unveiled an ambitious plan to revive the woolly mammoth and later the dodo bird. Since then, the company has focused on identifying key traits of extinct animals by studying ancient DNA, with a goal to genetically “engineer them into living animals,” said CEO Ben Lamm.\n\nOutside scientists have mixed views about whether this strategy will be helpful for conservation.\n\nGet top local stories in Philly delivered to you every morning. Sign up for NBC Philadelphia's News Headlines newsletter.\n\n“You’re not actually resurrecting anything — you’re not bringing back the ancient past,” said Christopher Preston, a wildlife and environment expert at the University of Montana, who was not involved in the research.\n\nOn Tuesday, Colossal announced that its scientists have simultaneously edited seven genes in mice embryos to create mice with long, thick, woolly hair. They nicknamed the extra-furry rodents as the “Colossal woolly mouse.”\n\nResults were posted online, but they have not yet been published in a journal or vetted by independent scientists.\n\nThe feat \"is technologically pretty cool,” said Vincent Lynch, a biologist at the University of Buffalo, who was not involved in the research.\n\nScientists have been genetically engineering mice since the 1970s, but new technologies like CRISPR “make it a lot more efficient and easier,” said Lynch.\n\nThe Colossal scientists reviewed DNA databases of mouse genes to identify genes related to hair texture and fat metabolism. Each of these genetic variations are “present already in some living mice,” said Colossal's chief scientist Beth Shapiro, but “we put them all together in a single mouse.”\n\nThey picked the two traits because these mutations are likely related to cold tolerance — a quality that woolly mammoths must have had to survive on the prehistoric Arctic steppe.\n\nColossal said it focused on mice first to confirm if the process works before potentially moving on to edit the embryos of Asian elephants, the closest living relatives to woolly mammoths.\n\nHowever, because Asian elephants are an endangered species, there will be “a lot of processes and red tape” before any plan can move forward, said Colossal's Lamm, whose company has raised over $400 million in funding.\n\nIndependent experts are skeptical about the idea of “de-extinction.”\n\n“You might be able to alter the hair pattern of an Asian elephant or adapt it to the cold, but it’s not bringing back a woolly mammoth. It’s changing an Asian elephant,” said University of Montana's Preston.\n\nStill, the refinement of precision gene-editing in animals could have other uses for conservation or animal agriculture, said Bhanu Telugu, who studies animal biotechnology at the University of Missouri and was not involved in the new research.\n\nTelugu said he was impressed by Colossal’s technology advances that enabled scientists to pinpoint which genes to target.\n\nThe same approach might one day help fight diseases in people, said Lamm. So far, the company has spun off two health care companies.\n\n“It’s part of how we monetize our business,” said Lamm.\n\n___\n\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Science and Educational Media Group and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

        "content": "What to Know The SS United States, a 1,000-foot vessel that shattered the trans-Atlantic speed record on its maiden voyage in 1952, arrived early Monday in Mobile, Alabama, nearly two weeks after departing from South Philadelphia.\n\nThe SS United States was once considered a beacon of American engineering, doubling as a military vessel that could carry thousands of troops. Its maiden voyage broke the transatlantic speed record in both directions when it reached an average speed of 36 knots or just over 41 mph. To this day, the SS United States holds the transatlantic speed record for an ocean liner.\n\nOfficials in Okaloosa County on Florida’s coastal Panhandle hope the ship will become a barnacle-encrusted standout among the county’s more than 500 artificial reefs and a signature diving attraction that could generate millions of dollars annually in local tourism spending for scuba shops, charter fishing boats and hotels.\n\nThe SS United States has, perhaps, shown why it was once the fastest ocean liner in the world as the rusted ship -- long a fixture of the Delaware River waterfront in South Philadelphia -- has ended its final voyage two days ahead of schedule.\n\nAfter nearly 30 years, the historic SS United States departed Philadelphia on Wednesday, Feb. 19, 2025, to begin a 1,800-mile journey to Mobile, Alabama, where it will be prepared to become an artificial reef.\n\nIn a statement, officials said that the final voyage ended on Monday, March 3, 2025.\n\nGet top local stories in Philly delivered to you every morning.

As she moved through the waves for the first time in 28 years, countless onlookers and admirers along the country’s eastern seaboard were inspired by her majesty and beauty,\" said SS United States Conservancy president Susan Gibbs in a statement on the ship's 401st voyage.\n\nOrganizers said, in a statement that the ship will now undergo a remediation process that will see items like command bridge components, engine room equipment, wires, cables, loose items, flooring, furnishings, fuel, paint, and contaminants -- possibly including asbestos -- removed from the vessel before it is taken to Florida.\n\nThis process is expected to take until the end of this year.\n\nOnce the process is completed, the remains of the vessel will be taken to Florida's Okaloosa County, where organizers plan to create a museum and visitor's center near where the SS United States will become the, what organizers called, the \"world's largest artificial reef.\"\n\nAccording to organizers with the SS United States Conservancy, there is also a documentary on the history of the vessel in the works, as well.",

        "source": "https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/",
        "content": "President Donald Trump on Monday directed a “pause” to U.S. assistance to Ukraine as he seeks to pressure Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to engage in negotiations to end the war with Russia.\n\nThe move comes just days after a disastrous Oval Office meeting in which Trump and Vice President JD Vance tore into Zelenskyy for what they perceived as insufficient gratitude for the more than $180 billion in military aid the U.S. has sent to Kyiv since Russia invaded three years ago.\n\nA White House official said Trump is focused on reaching a peace deal and wants Zelenskyy “committed” to that goal. The official added that the U.S. was “pausing and reviewing” its aid to \"ensure that it is contributing to a solution.” The official spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the assistance.\n\nThe order will remain in effect until Trump determines that Ukraine has demonstrated a commitment to peace negotiations with Russia, the official said.\n\nGet top local stories in Philly delivered to you every morning. Sign up for NBC Philadelphia's News Headlines newsletter.\n\nThe halting of military aid comes some five years after Trump held up congressionally authorized assistance to Ukraine as he sought to pressure Zelenskyy to launch an investigation into Joe Biden, then a Democratic presidential candidate. The moment led to Trump’s first impeachment.\n\nIn the leadup to the 2024 election, Trump vowed a quick end to the war in Ukraine, even once boasting that he could bring a halt to the fighting in one day. He has shown increasing frustration with Zelenskyy over the war while simultaneously expressing confidence that Russian President Vladimir Putin, whom he has long admired, can be trusted to keep the peace if a truce is reached.\n\nTrump earlier on Monday slammed Zelenskyy for suggesting that the end of the war likely “is still very, very far away.” Zelenskyy had suggested it would take time to come to an agreement to end the war as he tried to offer a positive take on the U.S.-Ukraine relationship in the aftermath of last week’s White House meeting.\n\n“This is the worst statement that could have been made by Zelenskyy, and America will not put up with it for much longer!” Trump said in a post on his Truth Social platform, responding to comments Zelenskyy made late Sunday to reporters.\n\nTrump, at a White House event later Monday, referred to Zelenskyy's reported comments and asserted the Ukrainian leader “better not be right about that.”\n\nZelenskyy later took to social media in an effort to further explain his thinking. He did not directly refer to Trump’s comments, but underscored that it “is very important that we try to make our diplomacy really substantive to end this war the soonest possible.”\n\nWatch the heated exchange between Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, U.S. President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance in the Oval Office.\n\n“We need real peace and Ukrainians want it most because the war ruins our cities and towns,” Zelenskyy added. “We lose our people. We need to stop the war and to guarantee security.”\n\nTrump administration and Ukrainian officials had been expected to sign off on a deal during Zelenskyy’s visit last week that would have given the U.S. access to Ukraine’s critical minerals in part to pay back the U.S. for aid it has sent Kyiv since the start of the war. The White House had billed such a pact as a way to tighten U.S.-Ukrainian relations in the long term.\n\nVance, in an interview with Fox News' Sean Hannity that aired Monday evening, said European allies were doing Ukraine a disservice by not pressing Zelenskyy to find an endgame to the war.\n\n“A lot of our European friends puff him up,” Vance said. “They say, you know, you’re a freedom fighter. You need to keep fighting forever. Well, fighting forever with what? With whose money, with whose ammunition and with whose lives?”\n\nDemocrats said the pausing of aid to Ukraine was dangerous and ill-advised.\n\nDemocratic Rep. Brendan Boyle of Pennsylvania, who is co-chair of the Congressional EU Caucus, said the decision “is reckless, indefensible, and a direct threat to our national security.”\n\nThe Biden administration provided Kyiv with more than $66.5 billion in military aid and weapons since the war began. It had left unspent about $3.85 billion in congressionally authorized funding to send more weapons to Ukraine from existing U.S. stockpiles — a sum that had not been affected by the foreign aid freeze that Trump put in place when he first took office.\n\n“This aid was approved by Congress on a bipartisan basis — Republicans and Democrats alike recognized that standing with Ukraine is standing for democracy and against Putin’s aggression,” Boyle said in a statement. “Yet, Trump, who has repeatedly praised Putin and undermined our allies, is now playing political games with critical military assistance.”\n\nDemocratic Rep. Dan Goldman, who served as counsel to House Democrats in the first impeachment inquiry against Trump, said the pausing of aid was “another extortion” of Zelenskyy.\n\n“This is the exact opposite of peace through strength,” Goldman said. “Instead, what it is is it’s another extortion of President Zelenskyy, illegally withholding aid in order to get President Zelenskyy to agree to a minerals deal.\"\n\nTrump's national security adviser said Zelenskyy’s posture during Friday’s Oval Office talks “put up in the air” whether he’s someone the U.S. administration will be able to deal with going forward.\n\n“Is he ready, personally, politically, to move his country towards an end to the fighting?” Mike Waltz said Monday on Fox News' “America’s Newsroom.” \"And can he and will he make the compromises necessary?”\n\nWaltz added another layer of doubt about U.S. support as other high-profile Trump allies, including House Speaker Mike Johnson and Sen. Lindsey Graham, have suggested that the relationship between Trump and Zelenskyy is becoming untenable.\n\nIn a meeting on Sunday with European leaders in London, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said he believes relations will continue with the United States.\n\nAngela Stent, a former national intelligence officer for Russia and Eurasia at the National Intelligence Council, said Putin is likely in no rush to end the war amid the fissures between Trump and Zelenskyy and between Europe and the U.S. about the way ahead.\n\n“He thinks Russia is winning. ... And he thinks that as time goes on, the West will be more fractured,\" said Stent, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution in Washington.\n\nTrump on Monday suggested he hasn't given up on the economic pact, calling it “a great deal.” He added that he expected to speak about the deal during his Tuesday address before a joint session of Congress.\n\nRep. Brian Fitzpatrick, a Pennsylvania Republican who co-chairs the Congressional Ukraine Caucus, spoke with Zelenskyy's chief of staff, Andriy Yermak, earlier Monday about getting the mineral rights deal back on track.\n\nKey GOP senators also indicated before the announcement of paused aid that they see a path to put U.S.-Ukraine relations back on track.\n\n“We got to lower the temperature,” said Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., “and get to a deal that’s economically beneficial and takes care of our interests as well as the interests of the Ukrainian people.”\n\nSen. Markwayne Mullin, an Oklahoma Republican who is a close ally of Trump, said he believes the president and Zelenskyy can “move past it.”\n\n“Getting the minerals deal done is a first step,” Mullin said. After that, he said, Zelenskyy needs to be “realistic on what a peace deal looks like.”\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Tracy Brown, Lolita C. Baldor and Marc Levy contributed to this report.",

A researcher studying which communities will get flooded when a storm strikes.\n\nThey were among the more than 600 workers the Trump administration cut last week when it eliminated about 5% of the workforce at the National Weather Service and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.\n\n“I was considered an essential employee, part of a 24/7 safety watch,” said Kayla Besong, a physical scientist at the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center, which sends tsunami alerts. Until Thursday, she was part of a team of 12 that programmed the systems that determine whether parts of the U.S. coastline are at risk and issued alerts accordingly. Two people were required to be working at all times, Besong said.\n\nThe mass firing — of educated, specialized workers who viewed themselves as the next generation of scientists protecting life and property — could stretch NOAA’s workforce thin and hinder work on programs designed for public safety, former agency employees and leaders said.\n\nGet top local stories in Philly delivered to you every morning.

Last year, NOAA counted 27 billion-dollar disasters, which resulted in the deaths of 568 people in the United States. It was the second-highest number since 1980, when NOAA began keeping such records, even accounting for inflation.\n\nAt the same time, meteorologists and forecasters say they’ve faced public vitriol and harassment despite increasingly accurate predictions. Some blame the politicization of climate change and the proliferation of conspiracy theories.\n\nA White House official said “an extensive process” was conducted before the NOAA layoffs to ensure “mission critical functions” weren’t compromised. The cuts were part of the Trump administration’s mass firings of federal workers, which have spurred protests and legal challenges. Some researchers have warned that cuts to health and science agencies, in particular, could walk back or stall years of progress.\n\nA NOAA spokesperson said the agency wouldn’t comment on the layoffs.\n\n“We are not discussing internal personnel and management matters. NOAA remains dedicated to its mission, providing timely information, research, and resources that serve the American public,” Susan Buchanan, a National Weather Service public affairs officer, said in a statement Thursday.\n\nFormer agency officials railed against the cuts, saying they threaten public safety during weather crises.\n\n“Every office in NOAA was hit by these indiscriminate, misguided, ill-informed terminations,” said Rick Spinrad, the administrator of NOAA under President Joe Biden. “We’re coming into tornado season; hurricane season isn’t too far behind. We’re going to have, still, some winter storms. We’re going to have floods, droughts.”\n\nDemocrats in Congress, too, spoke out against the moves at a news conference Friday and at a rally Monday at NOAA headquarters.\n\n“Without the warnings of extreme weather events, hurricanes, tsunamis, other things, people will die and others will suffer greatly, including huge property loss. And that’s why this is such an assault on our public safety,” Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., said at the news conference.\n\nBesong, 30, began her job as a physical scientist at the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center in Hawaii in September. The center provides alerts to the military and U.S. embassies and issues them for vulnerable coastlines in the Pacific Ocean and the Caribbean. During tsunami events, Besong said, she would call military installations with information about risk and contact local emergency managers.\n\n“I was using my skills to actively help people,” said Besong, who has a doctorate in atmospheric science. “You’re directly using your skills to improve systems that protect and warn against hazards.”\n\nShe added that tsunami alerts rely on complicated, bespoke computer programs that analyze seismic and tidal data.\n\n“When there’s any large displacement in the Earth’s crust or water, we get notified and have to determine if there’s an earthquake large enough to create a tsunami or if a tsunami has been generated by other means,” Besong said. “I’ve been developing these skills for over 10 years. I’m an excellent programmer. Their systems are very niche, and they require people who know how to program.”\n\nEven before the latest cuts, she said, the office was strapped for resources and needed to develop a new generation of workers.\n\n“You do need a high level of expertise to understand and jump in on these systems,” Besong said, saying the job required a doctorate or a master’s degree and additional experience.\n\nLike Besong, Andy Hazelton, a hurricane modeling specialist, also has a Ph.D. and spent years developing specialized computing skills. Hazelton helped develop NOAA’s next-generation hurricane modeling program, called HAFS, as an academic at the University of Miami.\n\nHe joined NOAA’s Environmental Modeling Center on the October day when Hurricane Milton hit the Florida coastline, then was fired on Thursday. His work involved using supercomputers to advance hurricane forecasting.\n\n“We’re working on the physical approximations, trying to make it more accurate, so the forecast error continues to shrink, the cone continues to get smaller and so the people who are going to get hit get more lead time,” Hazelton said, referring to the graphic that shows the probability of a hurricane’s path. “There’s a lot of expertise that got lost on this.”\n\nThe HAFS model indicated that both hurricanes Helene and Milton would intensify rapidly, which helped forecasters predict more powerful storms and get more strident warnings out, Hazelton said.\n\n“We do work people use to keep themselves safe,” he said.\n\nSome data that Hazelton’s models rely on is at risk, as well. Kerri Englert, a NOAA flight director and meteorologist, was also fired Thursday. During “hurricane hunter” missions, flight directors advise pilots about the safest routes and how to get the best data for modeling. Englert was onboard a “hurricane hunter” aircraft during hurricanes Beryl, Helene and Milton last year.\n\n“We do put our lives on the line to go do these missions,” said Englert, a Navy veteran. “It is a passion. I have spent 10 years chasing after this job.”\n\nBefore the cuts, Englert said, NOAA had aimed to have 10 flight director positions filled. But after she and another were terminated, that left just six. Now, she said, if one flight director is sick, there will be fewer “hurricane hunter” flights.\n\nDuring hurricane season, meteorologists rely on the one-of-a-kind data the flights gather, which feeds into hurricane models.\n\n“It’s going to increase the uncertainty,” Englert said. “You’re looking at additional evacuations.”\n\nOther fired workers were helping develop modeling tools that haven’t yet been rolled out at scale. The cuts may affect the tools’ quality and implementation timelines, they said.\n\nEvan Belkin, a doctoral student at the University of Albany, was hired at the National Weather Service in 2023 as part of a program that allows people still finishing degrees to work at the agency.\n\nHe worked at the service’s Northeast River Forecast Center and in its weather forecast office in Albany, New York, until last week. He helped launch weather balloons and was part of a team building a flood inundation mapping tool.\n\nThe tool, still under development, is designed to model which areas in a community will flood in heavy rain, including the extreme events that climate change is making more likely. Early versions of the maps were distributed to some local emergency managers, Belkin said, and the goal was to expand the services nationwide by 2026.\n\nThe model accurately predicted that flooding in Montpelier, Vermont, in July 2023 would reach the state capitol building — Belkin visited to confirm the model got it right.\n\nHe was among several students and employees working on the tool who were let go, he said.\n\n“When you don’t have people and bodies to verify how accurate the model depictions are, you’re not going to be successful,” Belkin said. “Without people and bodies, this flood inundation mapping project is going to go down the s----er.”\n\nThe cuts also reduced the number of meteorologists taking public calls and putting out forecasts.\n\nOn the morning he was fired, he said, Francis Tarasiewicz, a National Weather Service meteorologist in Rhode Island, started work at about 5:30 a.m., putting together four- to seven-day forecasts, as well as forecasts specifically for airports.\n\n“We’re not the waste,” Tarasiewicz said.\n\nSpinrad said at the news conference that every NOAA office had had reductions, including about 30% of the staff with the Office of Space Commerce.\n\n“One of the functions of that office is to keep the roughly 30,000 objects in space from colliding with each other,” he said.\n\nSpinrad also warned that the loss of workers would be likely to push back seasonal outlooks and hurricane forecasts.\n\n“Some of those products may end up being delayed in delivery just because they don’t have the staffing power,” he said.\n\nSome typical NOAA and NWS services went dark almost immediately.\n\nShortly after the firings, the National Weather Service office in Kotzebue, Alaska, said it would suspend releasing weather balloons.\n\nNOAA’s Great Lakes Environmental Research Laboratory also said it would stop posting to social media.\n\n“Due to a reduction in staff, NOAA GLERL’s communications services will be taking an indefinite hiatus,” it wrote on X.\n\nNOAA’s external affairs team said on its website that the entire office had been eliminated.\n\n“People’s lives are in danger. It’s not an exaggeration to say that. I’m worried. We’re coming up on tornado season, hurricane season, and that is just scratching the surface,” said Rachel Brittin, who until Thursday was the deputy director of the office. “These huge cuts to NOAA’s staff are going to affect the ability for NOAA to be effective.”\n\nThis story first appeared on NBCNews.com.

Online\n\nMillie Bobby Brown is sharing an important message.\n\nAfter facing an onslaught of negative comments from trolls accusing her of \"aging so badly,\" the Stranger Things star called out the criticism for playing into a larger systemic issue for women.\n\n\"I want to take a moment to address something that I think is bigger than just me,\" Millie said in a video shared to her Instagram March 3, \"something that affects every young woman who grows up under public scrutiny.\"\n\nGet top local stories in Philly delivered to you every morning. Sign up for NBC Philadelphia's News Headlines newsletter.\n\nMillie, 21, went on to reflect on her early rise to stardom, recalling that she was only 10 years old when she first got her start in the industry, and she scored her breakout role on Stranger Things shortly after.\n\n\"I grew up in front of the world, and for some reason, people can’t seem to grow with me,\" she continued. \"Instead, they act like I’m supposed to stay frozen in time, like I should still look the way I did on Stranger Things season one. And because I don’t, I’m now a target.\"\n\nAnd random people on the internet aren't the only ones who have singled out Millie, who previously clapped back at scrutiny about her appearance at the premiere of her film Electric State in February. In fact, the Enola Holmes star cited multiple news articles that criticized her for \"aging so badly\" or inquired what work she had \"done to her face.\"\n\nPHOTOS Millie Bobby Brown and Jake Bongiovi: Romance Rewind\n\n\"This isn’t journalism. This is bullying,\" Millie stated. \"The fact that adult writers are spending their time dissecting my face, my body, my choices, it’s disturbing. The fact that some of these articles are written by women? Even worse.\"\n\nMillie also called out critics for tearing women down for clicks, adding, \"We always talk about supporting and uplifting young women, but when the time comes, it seems easier to tear them down for clicks. Disillusioned people can’t handle seeing a girl become a woman on her terms, not theirs.\"\n\nDespite all the hate that the Florence by Mills founder has been receiving, she emphasized that she refuses to \"apologize for growing up.\"\n\n\"I refuse to make myself smaller to fit the unrealistic expectations of people who can’t handle seeing a girl become a woman,\" Millie said. \"I will not be shamed for how I look, how I dress, or how I present myself.\"\n\nAs for all the people who would rather \"say something horrible rather than say something nice,\" Millie—who tied the knot with husband Jake Bongiovi in May 2024 following three years of dating—urged them to look inward.\n\n\"If you have a problem with that, I have to wonder,\" she said, \"what is it that actually makes you so uncomfortable?\"\n\nMillie added, \"Let’s do better. Not just for me, but for every young girl who deserves to grow up without fear of being torn apart for simply existing.\"",

        "content": "Officials rushed to reschedule Mardi Gras celebrations and warned revelers against bringing umbrellas and tents as powerful storms with a threat of tornadoes were expected to strike Louisiana and other parts of the South on Tuesday.\n\nNew Orleans moved up its two biggest Mardi Gras Day parades and cut down their routes to try to avoid the potentially destructive weather. Police were also expected to keep the hundreds of participants and dozens of floats moving quickly so they finished before winds were predicted to pick up, according to New Orleans Police Superintendent Anne Kirkpatrick.\n\nThe alarming forecast was one of the first big tests for the National Weather Service after hundreds of forecasters were fired last week as part of President Donald Trump's moves to slash the size of the federal government. Former employees said the firing of meteorologists who make crucial local forecasts across the U.S. could put lives at risk.\n\nCountry faces a number of weather threats\n\nGet top local stories in Philly delivered to you every morning. Sign up for NBC Philadelphia's News Headlines newsletter.\n\nThe U.S. was facing multiple weather threats, including dust storms that brought near-zero visibility to parts of New Mexico and west Texas on Monday, prompting the National Weather Service to issue Dust Storm Warnings. “Widespread blowing dust\" was expected Tuesday, said the weather service office covering Midland and Odessa, Texas.\n\nThe week's strong weather system will bring “a threat of blizzard conditions, high winds, flash flooding, severe weather, dust storms, and critical to extreme fire weather conditions to the nation’s heartland,” according to a weather service update Monday.\n\nOn Tuesday, twisters, damaging winds and large hail were all possible as a strong storm system was set to move across the nation's midsection into Arkansas, Louisiana and Mississippi, the federal Storm Prediction Center warned.\n\nThe bullseye for a heightened risk of severe weather was an area stretching from east Texas to Alabama that’s home to more than 7 million people. Cities under threat included Baton Rouge and Shreveport in Louisiana; Jackson, Mississippi; and Mobile, Alabama.\n\nNew Orleans braces for severe weather during Mardi Gras\n\nThe New Orleans area was also preparing for strong storms, though Fat Tuesday's traditionally raucous annual rite of parades of floats and costumed merrymakers remained scheduled to hit the streets, with some changes still being worked out by authorities and leaders of “krewes” — social clubs that organize the parades.\n\nKirkpatrick ordered parade-goers to not bring umbrellas, tents or “anything that could fly in the wind and cause mayhem.” She warned that she may need to cancel the parades at the last minute if the weather gets worse.\n\n“I hold that trump card in which I will not hesitate to cancel — I won’t do it lightly, but I will do it,” she said.\n\nTwo other parades that had been scheduled to roll through the city later on Tuesday with nearly 200 truck floats were postponed, Kirkpatrick said.\n\nJust outside New Orleans in neighboring Jefferson Parish, officials canceled planned Mardi Gras Day parades due to anticipated high winds and thunderstorms.\n\n“This is disappointing, but our top priority is ensuring the well-being of everyone in our community, and we must always prioritize safety above all else,” Jefferson Parish President Cynthia Lee Sheng said in a statement.\n\nMardi Gras floats “could become unstable” and heavy winds could “blow down trees and power lines,” the National Weather Service warned, adding gusts of up to 60 mph (97 kph) were expected Tuesday afternoon.\n\nIn Pointe Coupee Parish, near Louisiana’s capital city of Baton Rouge, the incoming weather forced drastic changes to one of the oldest Mardi Gras celebrations in the state. The parade there was scheduled to roll without any bands, marching teams or dance groups — a staple of Carnival Season parades.\n\nOfficials also moved the parade start time up and urged residents to immediately remove all tents and trash after the parade ends “due to the dangers they can present during weather.”\n\nOther cities with Mardi Gras parades watching forecasts\n\nElsewhere, large crowds were expected Tuesday for Mardi Gras celebrations in Mobile, Alabama. Police there said they were continuing to monitor the forecast and would let the public know if plans for the celebration changed.\n\nOther cities hosting large Mardi Gras events included Biloxi, Mississippi, where an annual Mardi Gras parade was scheduled to start at 1 p.m. Tuesday.\n\nIn downtown Pensacola in the Florida Panhandle, organizers were planning a Big Easy-style Mardi Gras festival that included food trucks, dancing, live entertainment and a low country seafood boil.\n\n_____\n\nMartin reported from Atlanta.

        "content": "Reuben Frank and Dave Zangaro bring back Stay or Go in 2025, trying to figure out the futures of every Eagles player on the roster.\n\nWe already took a look at quarterback, running back, receiver, tight end, interior offensive line, offensive tackle, specialists and edge rusher.\n\nUp today: Defensive tackle\n\nThomas Booker IV\n\nGet top local stories in Philly delivered to you every morning. Sign up for NBC Philadelphia's News Headlines newsletter.\n\nRoob: Booker ate up some snaps in that interior line rotation – about 10 per game – and he wasn’t terrible, but he really didn’t do anything to make you think it was a priority to bring him back. Booker is a free agent and if he comes back it’ll be on a minimum-wage deal that will give him an opportunity in training camp with no guarantees. I think the Eagles can do better with a rotational interior lineman.\n\nVerdict: Goes\n\nDave: He didn’t play a ton in 2024 but Booker was able to give the Eagles 166 defensive snaps in the regular season and they were quality snaps. He ended up with a sack, 2 QB hits, 2 TFLs and 4 pressures in limited chances. Booker is 25 but could theoretically see his role grow this season depending on what happens in the offseason. It’s not a lock that he makes the team but Booker flashed enough to keep around.\n\nVerdict: Stays\n\nJalen Carter\n\nRoob: Just a monster Year 2 from Jalen Carter, who established himself as one of the top young interior linemen in the NFL. Any questions about his fitness or his durability or his work ethic were answered resoundingly as Carter played 84 percent of the Eagles’ defensive snaps, despite leaving every blowout win early. During one six-game stretch as the Eagles were chasing the No. 1 seed late in the season, Carter averaged 91 percent of the snaps. The best thing about Carter is that he genuinely doesn’t care if he makes a play or occupies a couple linemen to allow someone else to make a play. When he’s doubled, he’s opening things up for someone else. When he’s singled, he’s going to dominate. A truly elite young lineman without a trace of selfishness. Can't wait to see where he takes his career next.\n\nVerdict: Stays\n\nDave: We saw the kind of jump from Jalen Carter in his second season that the Eagles hoped they would see. Carter is a special player and he’s just scratching the surface of how good he can be in the NFL. The most impressive thing about Carter’s season is how many snaps he was able to play throughout the season. The one word we heard with Carter all of last offseason was “conditioning” and for good reason. Vic Fangio played Carter a ton in 2024 and Carter somehow never wore down. Carter had just 4 1/2 sacks in 2024 but don’t let that fool you. He was an absolute game-wrecker and got doubled-teamed at a really high rate. And then he ended up with a couple sacks in the playoffs, including a huge one against Matthew Stafford and the Rams to help close out that game. The Eagles might not have even made it to the NFC Championship Game without Carter’s efforts. He won’t be eligible for a contract extension until next offseason but Carter shouldn’t be going anywhere for a long time.\n\nVerdict: Stays\n\nJordan Davis\n\nRoob: Davis is an interesting guy. Has he played up to expectations as the 13th pick in the 2022 draft? Nah. But he plays a very important role as a run stuffer on the NFL’s top-ranked defense and he does it well. He even showed some pass rush ability in the postseason with a couple sacks. Will the Eagles exercise his 5th-year option at $11 ½ million or risk losing him after 2025? I’m guessing they either exercise his option or sign him to a long-term deal. He’s not a guy who’s going to pile up fancy stats, but where are you going to find an athletic 6-foot-4, 345-pound interior lineman who can eat up blocks, stuff the run and occasionally get to the quarterback? I think Vic Fangio wants him around beyond 2025, and I expect Howie Roseman to make that happen.\n\nVerdict: Stays\n\nDave: The Eagles have a decision to make on Davis this offseason. They have until May 2 to pick up the fifth-year option on Davis’s rookie contract, which is for just under $11.5 million in the 2026 season. This isn’t a slam-dunk decision but the Eagles will probably exercise this option. Davis played just 388 snaps (37%) in 2024 and he hasn’t really been worth the No. 13 pick. But Davis is a really run-stuffer who eats double teams and is a big piece of the locker room. Davis will enter Year 4 in 2024 and sometimes it can take a long time for defensive tackles to reach their potential in the NFL. Davis is massive and has unique athleticism that is worth seeing through.\n\nVerdict: Stays\n\nGabe Hall\n\nRoob: The Eagles kept Hall around on the practice squad as an undrafted rookie out of Baylor and re-signed him to a futures contract, and he could be earmarked for the practice squad again but hard to imagine room for him on the 53.\n\nVerdict: Goes\n\nDave: After the 2024 draft, the Eagles didn’t sign very many undrafted players but Hall was one that stuck on the practice squad all of last season. Hall (6-6, 291) has some traits that are worth developing, which is why the practice squad is still probably where he belongs in 2025.\n\nVerdict: Goes\n\nMoro Ojomo\n\nRoob: Another young lineman who showed significant growth as the season went on. Ojomo improved to the point where he averaged 23 snaps per game during the regular season and 26 per game in the postseason. On a top-ranked defense on a team making a deep postseason run, that’s impressive stuff for a 23-year-old former 7th-round pick. When you can find contributors in the seventh round, you’re really helping yourself.\n\nVerdict: Stays\n\nDave: The Eagles might have found something in Ojomo. He was a 7th-round pick in 2023 and definitely showed a lot of growth from Year 1 to Year 2. He’s a player who will likely need to have an expanded role as he prepares to go into the third year of his career. While he didn’t have a sack all regular season, Ojomo came through with one in the fourth quarter against the Rams to help the Eagles get to the NFC Championship Game. Ojomo in the regular season and playoffs had a pressure rate of 9.5%, which was second among Eagles’ DTs behind only Milton Williams at 12.3% in 2024.\n\nVerdict: Stays\n\nByron Young\n\nRoob: Young was a Raiders 3rd-round pick out of Alabama in 2023, so you know there’s something there. He didn’t play a snap this year – was either inactive or on Injured Reserve all year. With his pedigree he’s got a shot at finding a roster spot with a strong training camp, but he’s still a longshot.\n\nVerdict: Goes\n\nDave: It’ll be good to get a longer look at Young in training camp this summer. The former 3rd-round pick was claimed by the Eagles in August after the Raiders released him at final cuts. He never played in a game (inactive the first six weeks) before landing on Injured Reserve. The Eagles actually activated Young’s practice window but then shut him down for the season. This one is hard because we really haven’t seen much of Young at all. It’s possible he can earn a roster spot but for now, I have him off the roster.\n\nVerdict: Goes\n\nMilton Williams\n\nRoob: A tricky one. Williams’ price skyrocketed this year as he had his best regular season and then an outstanding postseason and superb Super Bowl. He may have priced himself right out of the Eagles’ range. Williams is now considered by many one of the top free agents regardless of position in the entire market. He has a unique skill set, with the ability to get after the quarterback, stop the run and even line up outside on early downs. Like most of the Eagles’ free agents, Williams wants to be here, but if the money is appreciably better somewhere else, he’s not going to stick around. So Howie Roseman's challenge is to make the money make sense for Williams. I do expect Howie to make Williams Priority 2 behind Zack Baun but a close Priority 2. If it means losing Josh Sweat and Mekhi Becton, I think Roseman will do that to keep Williams.\n\nVerdict: Stays\n\nDave: Williams is exactly the kind of player the Eagles want to prioritize and keep. He’s a homegrown 3rd-round pick, who plays a premium position and who hasn’t even turned 26 yet. The problem is that Zack Baun has to be the Eagles’ priority this offseason and I just don’t think they’ll be able to sign both of them this offseason. And Williams is about to get paid. Even before his 2-sack performance in the Super Bowl, Williams already had a career season in Year 4 with 5 sacks, 10 QB hits and 7 TFLs. He was a really good complement to Carter on the interior of the Eagles’ defensive line. Sure, he benefited from all the double-teams that Carter saw but it’s not like it’s easy to consistently win 1-on-1s in the NFL and Williams did that at a really high rate. Spotrac estimates Williams’ next contract to be three years, $36 million for an annual average of $12 million. That feels way too low. If that’s the deal, sure, do it. But Alim McNeill, who was drafted a spot ahead of Williams and who plays DT too, just got a four-year, $97 million contract. Even if Williams doesn’t touch that, I still think he’s going to end up out of the Eagles’ range.\n\nVerdict: Goes\n\nSubscribe to Eagle Eye anywhere you get your podcasts:\n\nApple Podcasts | YouTube Music | Spotify | Stitcher | Simplecast | RSS | Watch on YouTube",

        "content": "Originally appeared on E! Online\n\nDolly Parton will always love Carl Dean.\n\nIn fact, the country music legend spoke highly of their decades-long marriage in the months before Dean died on March 3 at age 82.\n\n\"It is important to have someone there in your corner and you know they'll love you for just who you are,\" Parton told E! News co-hosts Keltie Knight and Justin Sylvester during exclusive interview in May. \"There's a great comfort in knowing that someone loves you exactly for who you are — because he fell in love with me before I became a star.\"\n\nGet top local stories in Philly delivered to you every morning. Sign up for NBC Philadelphia's News Headlines newsletter.\n\nWhile Dean had always preferred to remain outside of the spotlight, he was her biggest cheerleader.\n\n\"It's like, I'm his star,\" the 79-year-old quipped at the time, adding that their unique dynamic has \"worked for us because we both do different things and it's exciting when we are together.\"\n\n\"We just enjoy each other,\" she continued. \"One of the things that we like to do—not necessarily a date night, we have a lot of date days—we have our little RV and we like to travel around. Going down and get some food, or I'll make a picnic and we go down to the river.\"\n\nREAD Dolly Parton's Husband Carl Dean Dead at 82\n\nAnd whenever she was on the road alone, the \"Jolene\" singer always had her man in mind.\n\n\"Carl and I have never bought big fancy presents for each other,\" she explained to E! News in December. \"When I see things through the years that I think he would like, when I'm out, I'll just kind of collect stuff and give them to him.\"\n\nCountry music legend Dolly Parton visited eastern Tennessee and announced she would be donating $1 million to Hurricane Helene victims.\n\nIt was a tradition that Dean also enjoyed. As she noted, \"He knows I love to cook when I'm home and he always buys me something for the kitchen. A new pot or a new pan or some kind of something he's seen on TV he thinks I might like.\"\n\nThat's why Parton said she \"never missed” the chance to spend Christmas with Dean. After all, the holidays are what she called a \"sacred time\" for the couple.\n\n\"I try to book all my things beforehand,\" the \"9 to 5\" star explained, saying that she'll often tell her team, \"'Do not book me, certainly for the week of Christmas, 'cause I need to be home with my family.'\"",

        "content": "When Spanish actress Penélope Cruz announced “I'm Still Here” as the winner of the international feature at the Academy Awards, millions of Brazilians roared at home and on the streets, where Carnival festivities have been ongoing since Saturday.\n\nOn Monday, as parties continued nationwide, many revelers took time to take a quick look at newspapers, peek on their social media and watch TV to rejoice even more for the country's first-ever Oscar victory. The film shows a family torn apart by the military dictatorship that ruled Brazil for more than two decades.\n\n“I promised I would watch ‘ I’m Still Here ' again tonight if it won, right after I come back from a Carnival street party, wearing my Wonder Woman costume,” said Fernanda Rocha, 38, a pharmacist and tourist from Brasilia. “I live in a city where the military almost helped former President Jair Bolsonaro throw a coup just two years ago. This movie is a win against that too.”\n\nRio Mayor Eduardo Paes announced an expensive way to celebrate. His administration will buy the house where the film was shot in the upscale region of Urca, currently priced at 20 million Brazilian reais ($3.35 million) so it can be transformed into a cinema museum.\n\nGet top local stories in Philly delivered to you every morning. Sign up for NBC Philadelphia's News Headlines newsletter.\n\n“We will make it public and open it for visitation, the place that brought Brazil's first Oscar in almost 100 years of the awards,” Paes said in his social media channels.\n\nRio’s O Globo and O Estado de S. Paulo, two of Brazil's most popular newspapers, had almost identical headlines: “At last, Brazil has an Oscar win.” The South American country has had four other films nominated for Academy Awards: “Keeper of Promises” (1963), “O Quatrilho” (1996), “Four Days in September” (1998) and “Central Station” (1999).\n\nBrazilian TV and social media repeatedly showed footage from the early hours of Monday, local time, with outbursts of joy across the nation and beyond, including at Rio's Sambadrome, a stadium where the glitzy Carnival parades take place every year, over the victory of the Walter Salles-directed film. And in Mexico, a TV broadcast team was seen dancing to celebrate the win.\n\nThe film's star, Fernanda Torres, was nominated for best actress. Her defeat to Anora's Mikey Madison disappointed many Brazilians. “I’m Still Here” was also a nominee for best picture, another first for a Brazilian film. Those losses did not dampen the celebration over the international film Academy Award.\n\n“This was our first, we want to soon have two just like our friends and rivals from Argentina,” said Paulo Almeida, 30-year-old theater actor. “I am so very happy and hopeful that this will boost our movie industry for decades, just like it did for our neighbors.”\n\nArgentina has won the international feature at the Oscars with “The Official Story” (1986) and “The Secret in Their Eyes” (2010).\n\nBrazilian media reported that Torres was invited to the “Champions Parade” of Rio's Carnival, which will take place Saturday with the top six performers at the samba school league. She has yet to confirm but hope among fans is high.\n\n“She is the movie. We need to celebrate her as much as we can,” said Vania Martins, a retired teacher. “Brazilian cinema deserved this win long ago. There's movies that were even better than ‘I’m Still Here' and didn't even get nominated. I hope that this win puts a spotlight on a country that does great, great things for art too.”\n\nThe golden statuette given to Academy Award winners goes primarily by its famous nickname. Here’s what the leading theory says about the name’s origin.",

        "content": "Eagles help Atlantic East launches women's flag football as varsity sport\n\nThe Atlantic East Conference is launching its first varsity women's flag football season this spring, making it the first NCAA conference to do so and increasing optimism that flag football will ultimately be recognized by the NCAA as an official championship sport.\n\n\"It's definitely the hope that it would continue to grow at an NCAA level and that the NCAA will sponsor it,\" Rebecca Mullen, interim commissioner of the Division III Atlantic East conference, said in an interview with ESPN. \"To see it continue to grow and buy into that is really a unique opportunity.\"\n\nThe move comes with a heavy assist from the NFL, which has identified growing the game through flag football as a priority.\n\nThe NFL -- through its flag football operator, RCX Sports -- provided initial funding to start the Atlantic East launch, in addition to offering guidance on rules and organization. The Philadelphia Eagles, who sponsor their own girls' flag football league and have been intimately involved in the effort to officially sanction flag football as a high school sport at the state level, hosted the Atlantic East's media day for flag football Monday to celebrate the launch of the season.\n\n\"We congratulate the Atlantic East on making history as the first NCAA conference to introduce women's flag football as an official varsity sport,\" Eagles vice president of community relations Julie Hirshey said. \"This is a milestone moment. ... Opportunities like this foster a more inclusive experience on the field of play and empower young female athletes of all ages and backgrounds to pursue their athletic dreams at the collegiate level.\"\n\nThe Atlantic East floated flag football as a club sport in 2024, and it is transitioning to a full varsity sport with a regular season plus playoff structure this spring. The inaugural season begins Friday and will feature seven schools: Centenary University, Eastern University, Holy Family University, Immaculata University, Marymount University, Neumann University and Penn State Schuykill. Marymount University won the championship in the club season tournament held in 2024.\n\nAlthough Division III schools do not offer athletic scholarships, the NFL -- through RCX Sports -- introduced the International Women's Flag Football Scholarship Program in 2023, allowing international players to attend a U.S.-based school that offers flag football as a varsity sport. The NFL also was involved in successful efforts to make flag football an Olympic sport in 2028.\n\nFlag football is currently in the NCAA Emerging Sports for Women program, a key designation ahead of becoming an NCAA-sanctioned sport -- once in the program, a sport must have at least 40 schools sponsoring the sport at the varsity level to be considered for championship status.\n\n\"I'm excited for the support and the growth across the board of other schools, and other conferences really buying in to giving women's sports the big opportunity that it deserves,\" Mullen told ESPN.\n\nAccording to the National Federation of High Schools, about 500,000 girls ages 6 to 17 played flag football in 2023, which is a 63% increase since 2019, making it one of the fastest-growing sports in the United States. The NFL counts more than 750,000 participants in its NFL flag football league nationwide, and all 32 franchises sponsor their own leagues.",

The 1,800-mile journey from Philadelphia to Alabama is the ship's 401st voyage.\n\nSS United States begins journey down Delaware River, out of Philadelphia\n\nCrews will spend about six months cleaning the 1,000-foot (305-meter) vessel and removing hazardous materials as they prepare it to eventually be sunk off Florida's Gulf coast.\n\nIn fall 2024, Florida's Okaloosa County bought the ship after approving a $10.1 million plan to relocate the ocean liner, sink it and build a $1 million seaside museum chronicling its history.\n\nRELATED: Ship sinking expert explains how the SS United States will be prepped for its underwater grave\n\nIn a few days, the SS United States will set sail for its final voyage down south, where it will be sunk as an artificial reef off the Florida coast.\n\nIt's been an emotional process for many who have memories of the SS United States. That includes a 91-year-old woman from Mississippi, who was on the ship's maiden voyage in 1952.\n\nThe vessel's final resting place will be off the coast of Destin-Fort Walton Beach, Florida, where it will become the world's largest artificial reef.\n\nOkaloosa County hopes the ship will become a destination for scuba divers and attract fish and other wildlife as a reef. It won't be the only shipwreck habitat they have.\n\nChristened in 1952, the SS United States was once considered a beacon of American engineering, doubling as a military vessel that could carry thousands of troops. On its maiden voyage from New York to France in 1952, it shattered the transatlantic speed record in both directions, when it reached an average speed of 36 knots, or just over 41 mph (66 kph).\n\nOn that voyage, the ship crossed the Atlantic in three days, 10 hours and 40 minutes, besting the RMS Queen Mary's time by 10 hours. To this day, the SS United States -- which is nearly as large as the Chrysler Building -- holds the transatlantic speed record for an ocean liner.\n\nIt was originally designed to transport troops and was then reimagined into an ocean liner with passengers who included four U.S. presidents and celebrities.\n\nIt became a reserve ship in 1969 and later bounced to various private owners who hoped to redevelop it but eventually found their plans to be too expensive or poorly timed.\n\n",

Alfred, her beloved pup, lends his name to Alfie's IPA, a flagship beer featuring cashmere, citrus, and galaxy hops. \"It's really one of my favorites on tap, but I am an IPA lover,\" she says.\n\nAnother house favorite is Fens Stout, named after her dog Fen. \"It pours tall, dark, and handsome just like him,\" Morrow jokes.\n\nAs a special tribute, every pet that inspires a beer gets their name and photo added to a dedicated wall in the brewery.\n\nWith great beer, a welcoming atmosphere, and plenty of four-legged friends, Snouts and Stouts Brewing is a must try.",

Kennedy Jr. to now urge parents to vaccinate their children.\n\nHealth officials say the majority of people living in Montgomery County have gotten their MMR shots and more than 95 percent of kindergartners in the county have been vaccinated.\n\nBut this rise in measles cases across the country has them very concerned.\n\n\"Measles has been eradicated since 2000.

Individuals who believe they were exposed should:\n\n-Review their immunization and medical records to determine if they are protected against measles.\n\n-Consult with their health care provider about receiving measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) immunization if they have not had measles infection or received the measles immunization previously. Contact and notify their health care provider as soon as possible about a potential exposure if they are pregnant, have an infant (child under the age of 1 year old), have a weakened immune system, and/or are not vaccinated.\n\n-Monitor themselves for illness with fever and/or an unexplained rash, cough, congestion or runny nose, or red watery eyes (conjunctivitis) from 7 days to 21 days after their exposure (the time period when symptoms may develop). If symptoms develop, stay at home and call a health care provider immediately.\n\nIndividuals are considered to be immune to measles if any of the following applies:\n\n-They were born in 1957 or earlier.\n\n-They have had 2 doses of Measles, Mumps, Rubella (MMR) vaccine.\n\n-They have had measles disease.\n\nThe following groups of people are potentially susceptible to measles:\n\n-Infants who are too young to have been immunized (less than one year of age).\n\n-Children who are only partially vaccinated (less than 6 years old).\n\n-Persons who were vaccinated with an inactivated or unknown type of vaccine, which was used from 1963 through 1967, and have not been revaccinated.\n\n-Some persons born after 1957 who have only received one dose of vaccine.\n\n-Those who have refused vaccination\n\n-Those from areas of the world where there is low vaccine coverage or currently circulating measles.\n\n-Immune-compromised persons, such as organ transplant recipients, patients receiving chemotherapy and people living with HIV/AIDS.\n\n-Individuals who meet the above criteria or cannot verify their immune status should consult with their primary healthcare provider about the best way to protect themselves from measles.\n\nAbout Measles\n\nMeasles is an extremely contagious virus that lives in the mucus membranes of the nose and throat of infected people. Measles can be transmitted from person to person through coughing and sneezing. If a healthy person breathes the contaminated air or touches an infected surface, then touches their eyes, nose or mouth they can become infected. When an infected person sneezes or coughs, droplets spray into the air and those droplets can contain active and contagious virus which will last in the air and on surfaces for up to two hours.\n\nMeasles typically begins with a fever (100.4F or higher) that lasts for several days, followed by a cough, runny nose, and watery eyes (conjunctivitis). Two to three days after symptoms begin, tiny white spots (Koplik spots) may appear in the mouth. Three to five days after symptoms begin, a flat red spotted rash appears beginning on face at the hairline and spreads downwards to the neck, trunk, arms, legs and feet. The flat red spots may also be joined by small, raised bumps. Symptoms appear about 7-14 days on average after exposure but can be as long as 21 days.\n\nMeasles is preventable with two doses of MMR vaccine which is available at your local healthcare provider or pharmacy. OPH can assist by providing recommendations for testing, outbreak prevention, and disease management.\n\nFor questions, call OPH at 610.278.5117. For more information about measles, visit here.

        "content": "What to know as Trump's long-promised tariffs go into effect on Mexico, Canada, China\n\nWASHINGTON -- Tariffs long-promised by President Donald Trump's administration went into effect at 12:01 a.m. Tuesday.\n\nThe move impacts products from Mexico, Canada and China -- the three largest trading partners of the United States -- meaning that it could impact prices for everything from gasoline to avocados to iPhones.\n\nAt the beginning of his second term, Trump set March 4 as the start date for 25% tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada, as well as 10% tariff on Chinese goods -- which, as of Tuesday, rises to 20%, per an amended executive order on Monday afternoon.\n\nSpeaking at the White House on Monday, Trump confirmed that the tariffs would take effect the following day.\n\nThe announcement sent major stock indexes plummeting. The S &P suffered its biggest loss since December, closing at 5,849.72 -- down 104.78 points or 1.76%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed at 43,191.24 down 649.67 points or 1.48%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq fell 2.64%.\n\nThe deadline arrives roughly one month after Trump granted Mexico and Canada a reprieve from such tariffs, having reached agreements with the two countries regarding border security and drug trafficking.\n\nHere's what to know about the tariffs that have gone into effect.\n\nTariffs could upend U.S. trade\n\nIn recent days, Trump reaffirmed his commitment to placing tariffs on Canada and Mexico.\n\nOn Feb. 27, Trump alleged that drugs had continued to enter the U.S. through Mexico and Canada despite agreements reached last month to address the issue.\n\n\"We cannot allow this scourge to continue to harm the USA, and therefore, until it stops, or is seriously limited, the proposed TARIFFS scheduled to go into effect on MARCH FOURTH will, indeed, go into effect, as scheduled,\" Trump said in a post on Truth Social.\n\nTrump voiced similar concerns about Mexico and Canada ahead of the previous tariff deadline -- before ultimately pausing the measures.\n\nCommerce Secretary Howard Lutnick on Monday praised Mexico and Canada for their recent efforts to address border security, suggesting that the level of the tariffs remained uncertain.\n\n\" [ Trump ] is going to decide today - we're going to put it out tomorrow,\" Lutnick told CNN, describing the policymaking as a \"fluid situation.\"\n\nTrump then confirmed that the the fresh round of tariffs would take effect the following day.\n\n\"That will start,\" Trump said. \"They'll have to have tariffs.\"\n\nIf the tariffs stay in place, price increases will be evident by Memorial Day, according to economist Mark Zandi, who also said that prices on food could start rising more quickly -- within weeks.\n\nNew tariffs could raise prices for some essentials\n\nTariffs on Mexico, Canada and China could raise prices for a vast array of goods, experts previously told ABC News.\n\nTariffs of this magnitude would likely increase prices paid by U.S. shoppers, since importers typically pass along a share of the cost of those higher taxes to consumers, experts said. The policy could hike prices for products ranging from tomatoes to tequila to auto parts.\n\nThe Yale Budget Lab estimated in February that the tariffs could cost the average household up to $2,000 annually.\n\nHigher costs for car production could pose a challenge for U.S. automakers, many of which depend on a supply chain closely intertwined with Mexico and Canada.\n\n\"The automobile sector, in particular, is likely to see considerable negative consequences, not only because of the disruption of the supply chains that crisscross the three countries in the manufacturing process, but also because of the expected increase in the price of vehicles, which can dampen demand,\" Gustavo Flores-Macias, a professor of government and public policy at Cornell University, told ABC News in a statement.\n\nIn a statement on Monday from the American Automotive Policy Council, which represents members like Ford and General Motors, AAPC President Matt Blunt said, \"Our American automakers, who invested billions in the U.S. to meet these requirements, should not have their competitiveness undermined by tariffs that will raise the cost of building vehicles in the United States and stymie investment in the American workforce, while our competitors from outside of North America benefit from easy access to our home market.\" He called for an exemption from the tariffs for American automakers.\n\nMexico and Canada account for 70% of U.S. crude oil imports, which make up a key input for the nation's gasoline supply, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, a government agency.\n\nTrump previously said Canadian energy resources such as oil and gas would be subject to 10% tariffs, excluding the products from 25% tariffs faced by all other imports from the country.\n\nThe U.S. imported $38.5 billion in agricultural goods from Mexico in 2023, making it the top recipient of such products, U.S Department of Agriculture data showed. Those imports include more than $3 billion worth of fresh fruits and vegetables.\n\nRoughly 90% of avocados eaten in the U.S. last year originated in Mexico, USDA data showed. Other products with a high concentration of Mexican imports include tomatoes, cucumbers, bell peppers, jalapenos, limes and mangos.\n\nTargeted countries may retaliate\n\nThe fresh tariffs may trigger retaliation from Mexico, Canada and China.\n\nIn anticipation of tariffs last month, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau threatened retaliatory tariffs on $155 billion worth of goods and urged Canadians to choose Canada-made products over their American counterparts. On Monday night, he reaffirmed that commitment, saying that Canada would start with \"tariffs on $30 billion worth of goods immediately and tariffs on the remaining $125 billion on American products in 21 days' time.\"\n\n\"Our tariffs will remain in place until the U.S. trade action is withdrawn, and should U.S. tariffs not cease, we are in active and ongoing discussions with provinces and territories to pursue several non-tariff measures,\" Trudeau said in a statement.\n\nOntario Premier Doug Ford said Monday that imposing the tariffs would be an \"absolute disaster\" for both the U.S. and Canada. He added, in part, \"I don't want to respond but we will respond like they've never seen before.\"\n\nFord warned if tariffs from the U.S. move forward, Canada will respond.\n\n\"We keep the lights on in 1.5 million homes and manufacturing in New York, in Michigan and Minnesota. If he wants to destroy our economy and our families, I will shut down the electricity going down to the U.S. and I'm telling you we will do it,\" Ford said.\n\nMexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said she had instructed officials in her government to implement Plan B, \"which includes tariff and non-tariff measures in defense of Mexico's interests.\"\n\nSpeaking to reporters on Monday, Sheinbaum said recent talks between the U.S. had gone \"very well\" but that Mexico retains options if necessary.\n\n\"We are going to wait and see what happens,\" Sheinbaum said. \"In that, you need to have mettle, serenity and patience, and we have Plan A, Plan B, Plan C, Plan D, so we are going to wait for today.\"\n\nAfter Trump amended his executive order on Monday afternoon -- just hours before tariffs were meant to take effect -- effectively increasing China's tariffs by 10% for a total of 20%, a Chinese Ministry of Commerce spokesperson responded with a statement calling the move a \"typical unilateral and bullying behavior\" that will cause \"damage to China-US economic and trade cooperation and the normal international trade order.\"\n\n\"China hopes that the US will view and handle issues objectively and rationally and return to the right track of properly resolving differences through equal dialogue as soon as possible,\" the statement added.\n\nABC News' Anne Flaherty, Zunaira Zaki and Elizabeth Schulze contributed to this report.",

        "content": "Sign up for our Daily Email newsletter to stay up-to-date on the latest local news throughout Philadelphia.\n\n“Welcome to ‘Behind the Eyes of Our Youth’, where we talk about anything and everything” are the opening words to a raw and honest podcast series hosted by juniors and seniors at Martin Luther King High School in East Germantown.\n\n‘Behind the Eyes of Our Youth‘ is a podcast series hosted and produced by the students enrolled in Dr. Stephen Flemming’s Communication 101 Program. This class fulfills a humanities requirement that students need to graduate, and through a partnership with Harrisburg University, students who pass the class will earn three college credits.\n\nFlemming is a pure Philadelphian, born and raised in West and Southwest Philly, educated in Philadelphia public schools, then attending Temple, Cabrini, and Drexel for his doctorate. He’s been a teacher for 18 years, and a podcast producer for almost four and a half years.\n\nThe podcast was born out of necessity during the online and hybrid teaching days of the 2020-2021 school year — “the idea came from the fact that we needed to use some minutes in class,” Fleming explained. He admits he had no prior experience or plan. Flemming “quite literally launched into it. I hit record on Zoom and told them we were just learning as we go.”\n\nHowever, it did fit perfectly into the curriculum: “I didn’t just see the communication course as just public speaking, so I expanded it to include things like podcasting, and some journalism principles.”\n\nThe inaugural students in 2020 named the show, and to this day ‘Behind the Eyes of Our Youth‘ is student-run. The students select episode topics, which provide real insight into what the students care about.\n\n“The students each week suggest topics and vote on them and discuss them,” Flemming explained.\n\nOn the show, students are often anonymously sharing their unfiltered thoughts and opinions about topics that “grown ups” would never speak into a microphone about. Recent episode titles include ‘Thoughts on Our Current President,’ ‘Can potential fathers have a say in abortion decisions,’ and ‘About the Staff at Martin Luther King High School.’\n\nIn May of 2024, student-podcast hosts released an episode with Philadelphia District Attorney Larry Krasner. In this episode, Krasner explains to the students the problems with the parole and for-profit prison system.\n\n“I know that the reality is that the place you stop crime is in this classroom, with proper funding to education, and with treatment available to those who need it,” Krasner said. A student asked the DA about his opinion on the federal government spending money overseas, when Krasner gave a political answer of “it’s complicated,” the student doubled down, going as far as referencing Norway’s healthcare system.\n\nIn January of 2023, the hit television show based on a Philadelphia Public School, ‘Abbott Elementary‘ aired its “Read-A-Thon” episode which introduced the now-running plot of Abbott’s podcast club.\n\n“I remember that episode,” Flemming continues “I love it. I love the idea that they’re doing it on, there was some discussion and murmuring. We were just wondering whether they got the idea from us.” Abbott Elementary writers did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe most downloaded episodes of ‘Behind the Eyes of Our Youth’ are about redlining’s relationship to crime in Black neighborhoods and college preparedness — and the audience is not just students. According to Flemming, the “audience isn’t generally teenagers. It’s mainly those 35 and up that listen to us.”\n\nThrough this podcast, Philly youth is capturing the attention of adults, while freely speaking their mind.",

        "title": "Explainer: How Philadelphia’s ‘Driving Equality’ law is reshaping traffic stops and racial disparities – Metro Philadelphia",
        "source": "https://metrophiladelphia.com/",
        "content": "For the past three years, Philadelphia police have not been able to stop drivers for eight minor vehicle violations.\n\nSign up for our Daily Email newsletter to stay up-to-date on the latest local news throughout Philadelphia.\n\nAndre Carroll took a phone call while sitting in his car at a gas station when a police cruiser pulled up behind him with its lights flashing.\n\nA Black man and a state representative based in Northwest Philadelphia, Carroll asked the officer what was wrong. The cop indicated that he had been there a while in his vehicle. Once Carroll identified himself, the officer told him everything was fine.\n\n“One of the things that I recognize is that not everyone has the opportunity to be an elected official,” he said. “An experience like that just three weeks ago could have gone terribly wrong.”\n\nCarroll recalled his recent encounter during a news conference Monday marking the three years since the implementation of the “Driving Equality” legislation, which prohibits police from pulling over a car solely for a series of minor violations.\n\nImpact of Driving Equality law\n\nProgress has been made to reduce potentially negative interactions with law enforcement, but data shows racial disparities persist, City Councilmember Isaiah Thomas and chief public defender Keisha Hudson said at the event.\n\n“A lot of Black people who would have been pulled over haven’t been pulled over,” said Thomas, the primary sponsor of the bill. “There’s probably a police officer who hasn’t been hurt because they’re involved in less traffic stops.”\n\nThe law reclassified eight offenses (registration that expired within a 60-day period, a visible but not properly placed temporary registration, hanging license plate, a single broken light, items dangling from the rearview mirror, minor bumper damage, expired or missing inspection sticker and expired or missing emission sticker) as secondary violations.\n\nPolice are still permitted to issue tickets for such infringements but only if they initially stop the car for a more serious violation, such as running a red light or stop sign.\n\nFollowing Monday’s remarks, there was a viewing of “Living While American,” a brief documentary about the proposal’s path through Council. Philadelphia was the first major city in the nation to limit the ability of officers to stop drivers, and several other jurisdictions have followed suit.\n\nProgress made, but racial disparities remain\n\nDriving Equality, as the legislation is known, faced pushback, amid a major crime spike coinciding with the coronavirus pandemic and concerns about reckless driving. However, in the wake of George Floyd’s killing and the resulting demonstrations, the initiative also drew significant support.\n\nThomas, a Black man who grew up in Philadelphia, was inspired by his own experience of being frequently pulled over. As a member of Council, he has formed strong bonds with PPD officers assigned to City Hall.\n\n“I think everybody should have that same experience with law enforcement,” he added. “For a lot of us growing up, every experience we have with a police officer is negative.”\n\nData shows that younger Black men are still the most likely to be stopped by police. Between October 2018 and September 2019, 72% of drivers pulled over were Black; last year, 63% were Black, though the share of the city’s Black population has also fallen 5 percentage points in that time, to 38%, according to the Defender’s Association.\n\n“We have miles to go, but this is incredible progress,” Hudson said Monday.\n\nThe Defender Association recently published a Driving Equality online dashboard with data culled from the PPD, the census and the city’s Vision Zero traffic safety initiative.\n\nPrior to the law’s implementation, the most common reason for a vehicular stop was a broken light, according to the dashboard. Now, it’s for red light and stop sign violations, and officers are pulling over more drivers on the High Injury Network, a collection of Philadelphia streets where 80% of all serious crashes occur.\n\nWhile vehicle stops increased in 2024, the contraband “hit rate” – the percentage of time when an officer finds a weapon or drugs – is down, the Defender Association determined.\n\nPush for transparency, accountability\n\nAn accompanying law required police to collect and publish additional information about vehicular stops, but the department has been slow to comply, Thomas and Hudson said. The Defender Association said there is only partial data for what prompted a stop and whether a gun was found.\n\nThe PPD did not respond to a request for comment about the data lags.\n\nThomas said lawmakers have made an aggressive push to expand automated enforcement, in lieu of police stops. He introduced legislation last week to install speed cameras in seven school zones, and the devices are also coming to Broad Street and additional roadways.\n\n“We feel like those are the things that are the best tools to be able to deter negative activities as it relates to driving and traffic,” Thomas said.",

        "content": "Sign up for our Daily Email newsletter to stay up-to-date on the latest local news throughout Philadelphia.\n\nActing in a stage show is a hard ordeal.\n\nBut, acting in two stage shows that simultaneously rotate every few nights is just another springtime season at Quintessence Theatre Company.\n\nThis March, 12 actors will be performing multiple roles in a rotating schedule of ‘A Midsummer Night’s Dream’ and ‘Antony & Cleopatra’ in a “Reckless Romance” repertory. Both written by William Shakespeare (whom the company loves to cover), this is the first time in a decade that Quintessence’s paired productions are written by The Bard.\n\n“In celebration of our ‘resident playwright,’ our 15th birthday, and the power of the classical actor, we return to repertory to present two of the most impactful works of Western literature,” says Quintessence Producing Artistic Director Alex Burns. Burns is directing both productions this spring.\n\n“Both plays are about the power of love: One a romantic comedy, the other a political thriller and romantic tragedy. Both celebrate a set of lovers whose passions are so great that they choose to stand outside of their society’s dictates and risk all for love. The result is that their reckless romances change the course of the world forever.”\n\nAs a release notes, the productions are highlighted by casts featuring some of the region’s best actors, including Philadelphia-based classic theatre actor and arts educator Tim Dugan, stage and screen actor Christopher Patrick Mullen, theatre artist and film actor DeAnna S Wright, and veteran actor and director Steven Anthony Wright.\n\n‘A Midsummer Night’s Dream’ already began previews and is set to open on Saturday, March 15. ‘Antony & Cleopatra’ on the other hand, begins previews on Wednesday, March 5, and opens on Saturday, March 22. Each of the 12 cast members play at least one role in each show, with some appearing in multiple roles in one or both plays.\n\nShakespeare’s ‘Midsummer’ follows four Athenian youths who reject their parents’ efforts to interfere in their romantic lives and choose to run away instead of facing the love-limiting laws of the land. When they meet a group of laborers secretly rehearsing their play for a royal competition, mayhem ensues. ‘Antony & Cleopatra’ on the other hand follows a time shortly after Julius Caesar is assassinated, the rebellion foiled, and the Roman Empire is now ruled equally by three men, of which Mark Antony is the most powerful—until he is subdued by the beauty, wit, and charm of Cleopatra.\n\n“With the future of our democracy in question, we look to the genius of Shakespeare to question how empires fall, the fallibility of fairy magic, and if winning the war is more important than following your heart,” Burns adds. “For hundreds of years, the bawdy comedy and eroticism of Shakespeare’s plays was censored, or misunderstood. Quintessence is excited to lean into the divine and the vulgar of human sexuality, exploring the comedy and the tragedy in hedonism.”\n\nThe full repertory schedule runs now through April 27. All performances take place at the historic Sedgwick Theater (7137 Germantown Avenue), and tickets start at $35, with premium seats available starting at $45. Group sales are also available.\n\nThese two shows also bring some stand-alone events to keep an eye out for. There will be two Behind The Scenes Previews: One for ‘Antony & Cleopatra’ on March 13, at 7 p.m. and another for ‘A Midsummer Night’s Dream’ on March 6, at 7 p.m. While there, visitors can join in on a pre-show chat hosted in the bar lobby 30 minutes before curtain time.\n\nAdditionally there will be two post-show convos — ‘Antony & Cleopatra’ on March 30, at 3 p.m. and one for ‘A Midsummer Night’s Dream’ on March 23 at 3 p.m. With these events specifically, a special guest will be invited on stage after the performance to lead a deep dive into the nuances of the production.\n\nQuintessence will also host Cast Talkback Nights (for ‘Antony’ on March 27, at 3 p.m. and ‘Midsummer’ on March 20, at 7 p.m.), a Queer Affinity Night with Burns (‘Antony’ on April 11, at 7:30 p.m. and ‘Midsummer’ on April 4, at 7:3o p.m.), an Industry Night where tickets are reduced (‘Antony’ on April 16, at 7 p.m. and ‘Midsummer’ on April 10, at 7 p.m.) and a Young Artists Night for aspiring artists (‘Antony’ April 3, at 7 p.m. and ‘Midsummer’ April 17, at 7 p.m.)\n\n‘Antony & Cleopatra’ and ‘A Midsummer Night’s Dream’ are also part of the 8th Annual Philadelphia Theatre Week, running April 3 to 13.\n\nTo find out more information on Quintessence Theatre Group, visit quintessencetheatre.org",

At 4 years old, he immigrated to Southwest Philadelphia and was a legal permanent resident until 2021, when a judge revoked his status following a drug dealing conviction.\n\nVan was detained in August during a meeting with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents, as family members and immigrant advocates demonstrated outside the agency’s Center City office.\n\nHe has been housed since at Moshannon Valley Processing Center, an ICE detention facility in Central Pennsylvania. He could potentially be deported to Thailand or Cambodia; he has never stepped foot in the latter.\n\n“It’s been over seven months,” said Nancy Nguyen, executive director of VietLead, a Southeast Asian community group that has organized a campaign to support Van. “And if not for the community pressure, if not for the legal strategies, working with Free Migration Project, One might already be gone.”\n\nHe was released from state prison in 2023 after serving nearly six years for narcotics distribution. An immigration judge last month upheld an earlier ruling that the offense was serious enough to warrant deportation.\n\n“This is a case that exposes a deeper systematic injustice, where immigrants and refugees are being doubly punished for past convictions with devastating consequences like indefinite detention and family separation,” said Adrianna Torres-García, deputy director at Free Migration Project, which has been defending Van in court.\n\nVan has taken responsibility and expressed remorse for his crime, but he does not believe he should be banished from the United States.\n\n“You send me to Cambodia, that’s like triple punishment,” Van told Metro in August. “I did my time. I know I’m going to get deported, but now you’re trying to deport me to a country I’ve never been to. It’s kind of like, how much punishment do I deserve?”\n\nRepresentatives from VietLead, O’Rourke’s office and Juntos, a South Philadelphia-based Latine organization, visited Van and other locals locked up at Moshannon on Friday.\n\nO’Rourke said he and state Sen. Nikil Saval have asked for a tour of the facility; ICE denied the request, stating that the lawmakers could meet with Van in the visitation area, he added.\n\n“This selective access is the opposite of transparency,” O’Rourke said. “We need to see and understand the broader conditions that our incarcerated constituents are forced to endure at Moshannon.”\n\nICE did not respond to a request for comment or reply to questions about Van’s case.\n\nO’Rourke noted that it was reported, by the Inquirer and NBC10, less than two weeks ago that a section of Philadelphia’s Federal Detention Center in Center City is now being used to house ICE detainees.\n\nAt a news conference following Thursday’s Council session, advocates said they want local, state and federal elected leaders, including Mayor Cherelle Parker, to speak up and do more to protect immigrants.\n\n“We need those leaders to be courageous, too,” Nguyen said. “It is not enough what has been happening. It is far from enough.”\n\nResources for local immigrants\n\nNationalities Service Center: 1216 Arch St 4th floor; 215-893-8400; nscphila.org\n\nHIAS PA: 123 S Broad St.; 215-832-0900; hiaspa.org\n\nWelcoming Center: 211 N. 13th St., 4th floor; 215-557-2626; welcomingcenter.org\n\nEsperanza Immigration Legal Services: 4261 N 5th St.; 215-324-0746; esperanza.us",

        "source": "https://metrophiladelphia.com/",
        "content": "Sign up for our Gay City News email newsletter to get news, updates, and local insights delivered straight to your inbox!\n\nHate crimes targeting LGBTQ individuals have made up a significant share of hate-motivated attacks in Manhattan in recent years, drawing the attention of Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg and his office.\n\nAssistant District Attorney Hannah Yu, who heads the office’s Hate Crimes Unit, told Gay City News in a recent interview that anti-LGBTQ crimes have increased in the borough over the last five years — and in 2023, anti-LGBTQ hate crimes were the top category of hate-driven attacks in Manhattan.\n\nIn 2022, anti-Asian hate crimes led the way, with 34, followed by 27 anti-LGBTQ hate crimes; in 2023, there were 39 anti-LGBTQ hate crimes, easily taking the top spot; and in 2024, there were 29 anti-LGBTQ hate crimes, ranking in second place overall behind only anti-Semitic hate crimes. One anti-LGBTQ hate crime has been reported in Manhattan thus far in 2025, according to the DA’s Office.\n\n“The overarching trend we’re seeing is a troublingly high number of anti-LGBTQ hate crime crises,” Yu said in an interview with Gay City News. “Because of the nature of the hate crimes against these individuals, they are typically violent and typically unprovoked attacks against strangers.”\n\nQuite a few cases have involved incidents on the subway — including when a gay couple got slashed in a sudden anti-LGBTQ attack while riding the subway.\n\n“The gay man was with his partner and the defendant recognized them to be a gay couple, went up to them for no apparent reason other than the fact that they were gay, slashed the man, and made homophobic remarks,” Yu said.\n\nDespite rhetoric about out-of-control crime on the trains, most New Yorkers are not experiencing subway crime and the NYPD touted a 5.4% decrease in subway crime from 2023 to 2024, with robberies dipping 16%. Still, in May of last year, a suspect allegedly grabbed a 35-year-old victim by the neck on an A Train at the 12th Street Station before punching him in the chest and yelling anti-LGBTQ slurs. In another example, also on the A Train last year, a 29-year-old man was riding a northbound train near 59th Street-Columbus Circle when a stranger allegedly punched him in an attack that left him hospitalized.\n\nA report published by State Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli last year found that hate crimes in New York State have increased by 69% over a five-year period. Among anti-LGBTQ hate crimes in the state over the last five years, 71% targeted gay men.\n\nLast year, New York enacted the Hate Crimes Modernization Act, a state-based law that broadened the scope of hate crimes law to allow prosecutors to punish violators with nearly two dozen additional offenses. That was viewed as an attempt to close at least some of the loopholes stemming from the Hate Crimes Act of 2000.\n\n“It does close some loopholes,” Yu said. “Does it close all the loopholes? No.” An example Yu cited was endangering welfare of a child, which Yu said is often associated with hate crimes but was not included in that legislation.\n\nTo address the troubling trend of hate crimes, Yu said the Manhattan DA’s Office is employing a multi-faceted approach that includes deploying a large unit of analysts and prosecutors who are trained on such hate crimes, engaging in community outreach to local community organizations to encourage people to come forward and report the crimes, and incorporating an educational component at CUNY schools and other colleges to educate students on what is a hate crime, how to report it, and what to expect when such crimes are reported.\n\n“The education piece is important to us,” Yu said. “We do spend a lot of time in the community going to precinct council meetings, houses of worship, and community centers.”\n\nKatie Doran, the DA’s advisor for LGBTQ issues, is in touch with organizations such as the New York City Anti-Violence Project and Hetrick-Martin Institute.\n\n“It’s important people know we’re available and can be helpful when people become victims — not just of hate crimes, but intimate partner violence in the LGBTQ community,” Doran told Gay City News.\n\nMany of the attacks leave victims with trauma, and the Manhattan DA’s Office has a Survivors Services Bureau, which is used to train counselors, victim services advocates, and social workers who can meet the needs of victims and help them with things outside of the legal realm, such as with paying medical bills, recovering a lost phone, and other issues, in a culturally responsive manner.\n\n“With anti-LGBTQ hate crimes, what I’ve seen is that these are crimes that go beyond the physical harm,” Yu said. “There is a deep emotional harm and it’s a very hurtful experience for any victim of a hate crime, but for victims of anti-LGBTQ hate crimes, they’re often with their partners in public spaces just being themselves. To be victimized in that way is, I think, especially traumatic, so the Survivor Services Bureau’s counselors and advocates do tremendous work to make our victims feel safe and whole.”\n\nThe DA’s Office is continuing to seek out opportunities for community engagement and education moving forward in an effort to support victims and chip away at the trend of anti-LGBTQ hate crimes.\n\n“We never say no if an organization requests a hate crimes training,” Yu said.",

Mandatory Credit: Bill Streicher-Imagn Images\n\nSign up for our email newsletter to stay up-to-date on the latest local sports news throughout Philadelphia.\n\nIn a country where association football fans make up 67% of the population, American football has lived its years playing second fiddle and it’s not even close. Between both namesakes lies a mileage, one so distant that the intervention of other sports, like basketball, athletics, tennis and boxing has done nothing in stimulating the competition. However, with reformers like Philadelphia Eagles’ defensive tackle, Moro Ojomo who, after his Super Bowl triumph, is set to headline a major veer in Nigeria, the course is set to be altered in favor of American football.\n\nAs the over 200 million global audience of Super Bowl LVIII came off the treat of a mind blowing halftime show performance by Usher, they were immediately teleported to Africa by a 146-second commercial, “Born to Play,” starred by two-time Super Bowl champion and leader of IPP Africa, Osi Umenyiora. The message of the commercial – the NFL International Player Pathway Program (IPP) – with much clarity, was summed up in Osi’s parting words to the youngster, Kwesi (Eldad Osime):\n\n“It doesn’t matter where you’re born, as long as you’re born to play”\n\nThese words did more than the task of thrilling the audience with its poetic effect; it was the recommissioning of a 2017 pathway constructed by the NFL, from North America to Africa. At the time – 2023 leading to 2024 – the pathway had just guided six Nigerians to the NFL. And in all, there were about 11 players of Nigerian descent in the NFL, with Ravens’ wide receiver and former Eagles’ Super Bowl winner, Nelson Agholor, among the prominent ones.\n\nThe IPP class of 2025, mirroring the kind of giant strides the IPP has been making in Nigeria, had players of Nigerian descent make up over 25% of about two dozen talents from various regions of the world.\n\nThe clear strategy to market the game by adding more Nigerian players was blazed by soccer, where the presence of stars, like Ademola Lookman, Victor Osimhen, Bukayo Saka, Alex Iwobi; and legends, like Kanu Nwankwo, Austin Jayjay Okocha, John Obi Mikel and others in the sport, has successfully reinforced its influence in the nation.\n\nFootball – NFL – Super Bowl LIX – Philadelphia Eagles v Kansas City Chiefs – Caesars Superdome, New Orleans, Louisiana, United States – February 9, 2025 Philadelphia Eagles’ Moro Ojomo and C.J. Gardner-Johnson celebrate a turnover on downs REUTERS/Mike Segar\n\nImpressively, the NFL is charting a similar course. Led by Eagles’ defensive tackle, Moro Ojomo, more than ten Nigerians featured on NFL rosters in 2024.\n\nIn the long run, it’s a symbiotic relationship where the NFL heightens its influence in the region and drinks from the pool of African talents, while Africans also reap the dividends of the numerous opportunities presented by the sport. Since the commercial at Super Bowl LVIII, the outlook of American football in Nigeria has witnessed tremendous developments. Yet, even without an IPP commercial, the Eagles’ triumph at Super Bowl LIX is on its way to sparking more remarkable shifts in the country.\n\nWhile the Eagles’ visit to President Donald Trump at the White House has been pending since their victory, home is truly where love resides for Moro Ojomo, who was welcomed with his parents by President Bola Tinubu to the Presidential Aso Rock Villa in Nigeria some days ago.\n\nThe Eagles’ defensive tackle proved himself worthy of honor when he announced that his home country was his next Caesars SuperDome, where he was set to exert himself fully and leave an indelible mark on the history books of American football – like he did at the Super Bowl.\n\nJan 26, 2025; Philadelphia, PA, USA; Philadelphia Eagles defensive tackle Moro Ojomo (97) tackles Washington Commanders running back Brian Robinson Jr. (8) during the first half in the NFC Championship game at Lincoln Financial Field. Mandatory Credit: Bill Streicher-Imagn Images\n\nAlongside his plans to establish a football academy, the athlete also spoke about his vision to create opportunities for Nigerian youth and nurture the next generation of athletes.\n\nSpeaking upon his arrival in the country, Ojomo emphasized his commitment to seeing the rapid development of American football in Nigeria.\n\n“In the meeting yesterday, we proposed a plan to ultimately build an academy that not only promotes Nigerian-born athletes overseas or Nigerian descendants who come back and visit but also points to the youths and gives them abilities to grow in strength and grow into skill. That is what is in the pipeline,” he said.\n\n“The goal is to see Nigerians doing well in American football. I believe the sport is not popular in Nigeria because people do not understand it.’’\n\n“There is a lot of work being done with the flag football team. Some tryouts are happening in Lagos right now. I think they want to get them ready for the Olympics in 2028,” the footballer added.\n\nHe also highlighted the importance of providing young people with the necessary investments that can improve the face of Nigeria sports on the global stage.\n\n“I would not be here without Nigeria. I think that there is a saying that the grass is not greener where you go, it’s greener when you water it. We have the opportunity to water it.”\n\n“What we are working on now is just to provide more opportunities for the youths and ultimately make Nigeria the greatest country in the world. So that’s the goal,” Ojomo remarked.\n\nTruly, it could be a lengthy journey for American football, but with footballers like Moro Ojomo, the pathway continues to flourish in Nigeria. And while the only referent of Eagles in the country has always been the country’s soccer national team: Super Eagles, with the continuous growth of American football, the goal is that soon enough, the Philadelphia Eagles will receive a share of that recognition.\n\nMandatory Credit: Bill Streicher-Imagn Images",

        "content": "Sign up for our email newsletter to stay up-to-date on the latest local sports news throughout Philadelphia.\n\nPHILADELPHIA — The Sixers played host to the Portland Trail Blazers Monday night. In a game in which the Sixers entered with just 10 players, they lost one more during the third quarter as star Tyrese Maxey took a hard fall on his back and eventually made his way to the locker room.\n\nAs the Sixers were down 74-68 to the Blazers midway through the third quarter, Maxey drove into the lane against Toumari Camara and Donovan Clingan, looking to help his team retake the lead. This game had been a massive struggle for Maxey, who was 2-12 on the night with just five points before his final missed shot of the night.\n\nIt has been reported for some time that Maxey is dealing with an injury to a finger on his right hand. Sixers’ head coach Nick Nurse has been asked about the injury on several occasions, including pregame, when he was asked whether or not the star guard was progressing at all in the healing process. Nurse’s response was not an encouraging one.\n\n“Not much better,” Nurse said. “I did ask him. He came out for walkthrough with no tape on it. I said, ‘Where’s the tape?’ And he said, ‘Forget that tape, man.’ I said, ‘Feeling better?’ He said, ‘No.’ There you go. There’s your answer.”\n\nThis once again begs the question, why was Maxey on the floor to begin with? Over his past four games, Maxey has shot 14/69, that’s 20.2% from the field. From three, he’s made just two of his last 21 shots. Very clearly, Maxey is not healthy enough to play, and even if one is to take the team at face value when they say they are continuing to push to compete, all Maxey has done is hurt the team’s chances and now himself because of the irresponsibility of the organization.\n\nTyrese Maxey was officially ruled OUT for the rest of the game with a back contusion between the third and fourth quarters.\n\nThis story is continuing to develop, and more information will be made available as soon as it is known.\n\nFor the latest breaking news on your Philadelphia 76ers and other Philly sports, follow Zach Ciavolella on X — @CiavoNBA and Bluesky — @ciavo.bsky.social",

Slay is now 34-years-old and despite playing at a solid level in 2024, was on the books for around a $13M cap hit, according to spotrac. The Eagles had an option going into 2025 and have decided to double down on their plethora of young corners instead of paying big money to a veteran. They will save around $4M in cap space as a result.\n\nJan 12, 2025; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA; Philadelphia Eagles cornerback Darius Slay Jr. (2) makes an interception against Green Bay Packers wide receiver Dontayvion Wicks (13) during the first half in an NFC wild card game at Lincoln Financial Field. Mandatory Credit: Bill Streicher-Imagn Images\n\nSlay leaves Philadelphia as a Super Bowl Champion and his impact in 2024 was significant as far as the likes of Quinyon Mitchell and Cooper DeJean are concerned. He ends his tenure with 9 picks in 74 games, 272 total tackles and 56 pass breakups.\n\nWhile it hasn’t always been sunny, Slay’s presence in the Philadelphia secondary brought to an end the tumultuous era of failed CB experiments. The Birds were able to hang their hat on slay while the next generation developed and without him, the team might not have enjoyed the defensive success it has.\n\nIn his place, the Eagles do have in-house options. Isaiah Rodgers and Kelee Ringo will be the fonrtrunners going into OTA’s, but there is always the possibility of another rookie being added, or even a slightly younger veteran being added to the roster.\n\nDarius Slay made three Pro Bowls as an Eagle and will undoubtedly go down as one of the best corners of this generation. To have watched him for 5 years in midnight green has been a sight for sore eyes and hopefully he’s able to catch onto another team for one last rodeo.\n\nMandatory Credit: Bill Streicher-Imagn Images",

        "content": "Feb 25, 2025; Port Charlotte, Florida, USA; Philadelphia Phillies outfielder Justin Crawford (80) breaks his bat as he reaches on a fielders choice against the Tampa Bay Rays during the fourth inning at Charlotte Sports Park. Mandatory Credit: Kim Klement Neitzel-Imagn Images\n\nSign up for our email newsletter to stay up-to-date on the latest local sports news throughout Philadelphia.\n\nAs the start of the 2025 MLB season inches closer, MLB Pipeline churned out its first installment of team centric Top-30 prospect lists starting with the American and National League East. The Phillies are headlined by super pitching prospect Andrew Painter which is no surprise, who also ranks as the 8th-best prospect in all of baseball according to MLB Pipeline.\n\nWho fills in behind Painter for the rest of the top 10 and who are some intriguing prospects who landed on the top 30? Let’s take a look.\n\n*Where a player is projected to start the 2025 season is solely based on where the player finished in 2024.\n\n1. Andrew Painter, RHP\n\nNo surprise here. The 6-foot-7, 21-year-old has all the tools of being a potential ace at the big league level. Unfortunately, his young career came to a halt after going for Tommy John Surgery which kept him off a mound in competitive innings in both 2023 and 2024. Prior to the injury, he was on the fast track to the bigs in 2022, climbing up the organizational ladder playing in Low-A Clearwater, High-A Lakewood and Double-A Reading. Painter started in 22 total games posting an impressive 1.56 ERA across the three levels, racking up 155 strikeouts to just 25 walks in 103.2 innings.\n\nPainter has a lethal four pitch mix with all offerings able to miss bats which was on display in the Arizona Fall League in 2024 where he was named the league’s Pitcher of the Year. With a fastball that sits in the upper 90s and can hit triple digits to go along with a 60-grade slider while mixing in a curveball and change up, the sky is the limit for Painter. He could start the year in either Double-A or even Triple-A if the Phillies want him to face the best competition to start the season before is imminent call up to the big leagues.\n\n2. Aidan Miller, SS\n\nAlso, not much of a surprise that Miller slots in right behind Painter as the club’s #2 prospect. What is surprising is how impressive Miller has been at the position despite never playing it for a full season in his life. The young shortstop also is ranked inside the top 30 in all of baseball at #27 according to MLB Pipeline. Miller is coming off a solid 2024 campaign where he, like Painter did in 2022, traversed the first three levels of the minor leagues, wrapping up the season in Double-A Reading.\n\nMiller slashed .267/.375/.436 to go with 11 homers, 60 RBIs and 23 stolen bases. The Phillies may have gotten Miller at a discount due to a broken hamate bone the young infielder suffered after an impressive summer showcase. The Phillies scooped Miller up with the 27th overall pick in 2023 after looking like he was one of the top high school hitters in the draft class.\n\nMiller has gained a ton of recognition in his short time in the organization, representing the team in the MLB Futures Game. He only played in five games with the Fightin’ Phils to close out the 2024 season so it would be easy to figure he would start the year in Reading once Spring Training comes to a close.\n\n3. Justin Crawford, OF\n\nComing in as the third-best prospect for the Phillies and #64 in all of baseball, Crawford has turned a corner after a small sample size in his pro debut 2022 season where he played in just 16 games. Joining Miller in the Futures Game last year, the 21-year-old is a polarizing prospect blessed with blazing speed, courtesy of his dad Carl, who was a four-time All-Star and spent 15 years in the bigs with Rays, Red Sox and Dodgers and accumulated 480 career stolen bases which is inside the top 50 all-time in MLB history.\n\nWhen he signed with the club after being the 17th overall pick in the 2022 MLB Draft, he weighed about 160 pounds. Fast forward to this spring, he has put on 35 pounds, bulking up to 195 pounds and it’s led to louder and harder contact.\n\nCrawford, who split time between High-A Jersey Shore and Double-A Reading, slashed an impressive .313/.360/.444 across 110 games while swiping 42 bases, five shy of his young career watermark of 47 he had in 2023. It would make sense for Crawford to start the year back in Reading and work his way to a promotion to Triple-A Lehigh Valley at some point in the summer as he is starting to look like a potential five-tool player.\n\n4. Eduardo Tait, C\n\nTait is hoping to follow in the footsteps of Phillies fan-favorite in Carlos Ruiz as another catcher who can make an impact for the club representing Panama. He’s off to a strong start. At just 17-years-old, the backstop posted an impressive 117 wRC+, the same number that super prospect Leodalis De Vries posted for the San Diego Padres last season as one of the youngest players at the level.\n\nSigned for $90,000 in 2023, the left-handed, bat first catcher has showed some early returns on the investment for the Phillies. Tait, who gets penalized, unfairly like most catching prospects, because of the position he plays, split time between Rookie ball and Clearwater last year. In 80 games between the two stops, the catcher hit to the tune of .302 with 11 homers and 73 RBI. Once stateside, he played in 28 games with the Threshers and slashed .269/.316/.462.\n\nDefensively, Tait is still a work in progress but is continuing to work on everything that being a good catcher entails. Keep an eye on how Tait handles an entire season of pro ball here in the U.S. this year.\n\n5. Moises Chace, RHP\n\nThe more notable of the two names that came to the Phillies when they dealt Gregory Soto to Baltimore is Chace. The 21-year-old signed for $225,000 with the Orioles out of Venezuela and his fastball is what got him noticed. Sitting at a 60-grade pitch, Chace’s heater averaged just a tick under 95 m.p.h. while seeing it move up a few notches on the radar gun last year. To go along with the fastball, Chace features a sweeper, a cutter and a changeup.\n\nChace spent most of last season in High-A between Aberdeen with the O’s and Jersey Shore but did close out the year in Double-A where he made four starts posting a 3.66 ERA in 19.2 innings. He struck out an impressive 35 batters and walked just seven. He showed solid command of his repertoire and held opponents to a .200 batting average.\n\nAt 21-years-old, it would make sense he starts in AA with a potential fast move to Triple-A if he continues to dominate Eastern League hitters.\n\nProspects 6-10\n\nThe next five prospects on the list include outfielders Dante Nori and Griffin Brubaker at #6 and #7 with right-handed pitcher Mick Abel at #8, second baseman Devin Salitban at #9 and outfielder Gabriel Rincones Jr. as #10, who has turned heads already this spring, smacking three homers.\n\nIntriguing Phillies Prospect\n\nThe Phillies will have to wait a year, but right-handed pitcher and #19 prospect Wen-Hui Pan has some intrigue. Suffering a broken pinky kept him out of commission until mid-way through the season last year, but in his pro debut in 2023, he turned heads, pitching his way out of the bullpen up to High-A Jersey Shore. A native of Chinese Taipei and signed with the Phillies for $350,000 as an international free agent, Pan’s pitch mix, notably his fastball, could be his calling card to be a reliable late inning arm in the future.\n\nPan was tabbed to pitch in the Arizona Fall League in 2024, but he needed Tommy John surgery after elbow issues popped up so he will be out for the entire 2025 campaign. With a 65-grade fastball that can touch triple digits and a splitter that scouts say is a true out pitch, Pan could climb the ladder rather quickly once he returns.\n\nFor the entire list of 30 prospects you can find it here.\n\nMandatory Credit: Kim Klement Neitzel-Imagn Images",

        "content": "Sign up for our email newsletter to stay up-to-date on the latest local sports news throughout Philadelphia.\n\nThe Phillies’ starting rotation has a lot of buzz surrounding it heading into the regular season. Cristopher Sanchez continues to fuel that excitement after another impressive spring training start against the Baltimore Orioles on Sunday as the Phillies rallied in the ninth for a walk-off 5-4 win.\n\nSanchez Continues to Shine\n\nWith his fastball still pumping in the upper 90’s to go with a lethal changeup, Sanchez tossed 2.2 innings, racking up five strikeouts. He cruised through the first two innings before running into some trouble in the third.\n\nSanchez seemingly had his sixth punchout of the day to close out the third inning, but Baltimore’s Gary Sanchez challenged a full count pitch, which was overturned to a ball with the new ABS System implemented this Spring Training. The southpaw would go to the dugout regardless as he was pulled for reliever Gabe Mosser with the bases loaded, who gave up a two-run single to Colton Cowser. Sanchez was charged with two runs, only one earned though, as J.T. Realmuto was called for catcher’s interference to allow O’s super prospect Samuel Basallo to reach base.\n\nIn two starts, Sanchez has eight strikeouts to just one walk in 4.2 innings of work while opponents are hitting just .176 against him. It’s a small sample size, but it’s been noticeably impressive.\n\nBohm Homers Twice\n\nAfter rumors swirled all winter that the Phillies might be looking to trade All-Star third baseman Alec Bohm, Dave Dombroski put that to rest, and Bohm is looking to build off his All-Star campaign in 2024, where he hit 15 homers and drove in 97 RBI while posting a wRC+ of 115. The third baseman put a jolt into a changeup against Luis Gonzalez for his first homer and just his second hit of the spring to make it a 2-1 Phillies deficit in the fourth.\n\nHe followed up in his next at-bat with an opposite field shot to right field in the bottom of the sixth to give the Phillies a 3-2 lead for a multi-homer afternoon. Bohm had just one game last season where he hit two or more home runs, which came back on April 19 against the Chicago White Sox.\n\nMar 2, 2025; Dunedin, Florida, USA; Philadelphia Phillies pitcher Taijuan Walker (99) throws a pitch against the Toronto Blue Jays in the first inning during spring training at TD Ballpark. Mandatory Credit: Nathan Ray Seebeck-Imagn Images\n\nOscar In Outfield Mix\n\nOscar Mercado tied the game up with a solo blast in the bottom of the fifth inning for just his third hit of the spring. The outfielder was signed by the Phillies to a minor league deal to be part of the outfield competition. Mercado, originally a second-round pick by St. Louis had a strong rookie campaign slashing .269/.318/.443 with 15 homers and 15 steals in 482 plate appearances with Cleveland after acquiring him in a trade. Mercado has yet to duplicate that successful season and spent the majority of last year in Triple-A between Toldeo (Detroit) and El Paso (San Diego) playing in 93 games hitting .222 with 12 homers and 50 RBIs.\n\nNinth Inning Rally\n\nTrailing 4-3 in the bottom of the ninth, the Phillies mounted a two-out comeback. Payton Henry extended the game with a walk. After Bryan Rincon singled and Paul McIntosh was plunked by a pitch to load the bases, Matt Kroon singled to left to drive in two for the come-from-behind won.\n\nOther Phillies Notes\n\nKyle Schwarber got the start in left field for the Phillies Sunday afternoon. Schwarber made just five starts in the corner outfield position last year for the Phils, but is no stranger to playing left. In 2022 and 2023, he was the club’s primary left fielder, making 142 total starts during that span. Edmundo Sosa entered the game in the 7th inning and played right field as the Phillies look to provide more versatility for the utilityman.\n\nThe Phillies had a split-squad day in the Sunshine State and lost to Toronto in Dunedin 5-4. The team will be back in action on Tuesday when they travel to Tampa to take on the Yankees at 1:05 p.m.\n\nMandatory Credit: Kim Klement Neitzel-Imagn Images",

Here are my 3 Stars of the Match against FC Cincinnati.\n\nImage Credit: Philadelphia Union\n\n3rd Star – Daniel Gazdag\n\nWe know he can score goals, but can Daniel Gazdag find ways to impact the game when he isn’t? Against FC Cincinnati Gazdag did just that, registering 2 unselfish assists, both to Tai Baribo, and bringing himself within 1 of his total for the entire 2024 MLS season (3) just 2 games in.\n\nDaniel Gazdag looks like he’s ready to play provider and help spread the scoring a bit more in 2025 under Bradley Carnell’s system, and hopefully the big performance at home will boost him and the rest of the team moving forward\n\n“It was really important for us to show up for our fans, [to show] what we’re about to do this season, and the first home game was a perfect occasion to do that. We’ve been really motivated before the game and it worked out well today, we scored a lot of goals and we played with intensity. I think that’s all what our fans needed today” – Daniel Gazdag on Philadelphia Union winning their Home Opener\n\nImage Credit: Philadelphia Union\n\n2nd Star – Quinn Sullivan\n\nQuinn Sullivan is off to a strong start to the 2025 season, registering another assist in Saturday’s win over FC Cincinnati with a perfect cross into the penalty area for Bruno Damiani to put away his debut goal in stoppage time. Sullivan also played a big part in Union’s opening goal, sending the ball out wide to Kai Wagner, who then put the ball into the box for Tai Baribo to slam home.\n\nIn addition to his assist and game-high 6 completed dribbles, Quinn Sullivan also logged the most Duels Won of any player on Saturday night (12), making it difficult for Cincinnati’s midfield to find rhythm in the game. Two games into the season, Quinn Sullivan is tied for the most assists in MLS play with 3 and currently ranks amongst the best midfielders in the league in attacking stats.\n\nSullivan’s work rate and creativity were on display last season, but the quality of the final ball often was lacking and failed to translate to goals. In the early stages of life under Bradley Carnell, it looks like Quinn Sullivan has the freedom and confidence he needs to make an impact for this Union team on both sides of the ball.\n\nSullivan was named on the bench of MLS’ Matchday 2 Player of the Matchday roster.\n\n1st Star – Tai Baribo\n\nHe’s off to a blazing hot start. The guy continues to score goals and in bunches for the Philadelphia Union. After netting the first hat-trick of the 2025 MLS Season, Tai Baribo has moved his goal-total to 21 goals scored in his previous 24 games for the Philadelphia Union across all competitions, and was voted as Major League Soccer’s Player of the Matchday for Matchday 2.\n\nBaribo seems to enjoy playing against FC Cincinnati more than anyone else. With the first two goals of his career coming against FCC last June, Baribo has continued to torment their backline almost every time they’ve met, netting seven goals in four games against The Orange and Blue.\n\nBaribo’s 5 goals have him as the current leader in Major League Soccer’s Golden Boot race and have the Union top of the East 2 weeks in, which might come as a surprise if you read what MLS pundits said about the Union in their pre-season predictions. But not Tai Baribo. He’s kept all of that out of his mind and remains focused on the things most important to him\n\n”I just dont read the media, I put myself outside from everything. The coach told us that people disrespect but if you don’t say it I don’t know. I don’t really care what people say, I believe in myself, I believe in the team, I believe in God, this is the most important thing, and just continue like this” – Tai Baribo on the media’s perception of Union\n\nImage Credit: Philadelphia Union\n\nBe sure to return to Philly Sports Network for more Philadelphia Union and other soccer content!\n\nFollow our Union team on Twitter:\n\nTim Lovenguth | Jimmy King | Paul Frenzel\n\nNate Tennesen | Eric Frysinger\n\nSteve Beavon | Liam Jenkins\n\nDoop on Union fans!\n\nFeatured Image Credit: Philadelphia Union",

We attract seasoned art buyers to young professionals, and our guests are typically laser-focused on acquiring art from our community of incredibly talented artists,” explains Rachel Zimmerman, Executive Director and Founder of InLiquid in a statement.\n\nAs a release notes, the new name is meant to be reflective of both the month it takes place, and the community resilience InLiquid is committed to upholding. While the name has evolved, the basic format of the auction will remain the same: For 15 days, between March 9 and 22, more than 300 works of fine art will be curated in one room on top of a variety of events meant to connect the city’s artists and art professionals with the public.\n\n“March for Art” is also turning a second room at InLiquid into an “immersive environment” while using projection mapping technology courtesy of Jefferson University’s industrial design department.\n\nThe best part of this activation? Unlike many charity auctions, InLiquid splits the proceeds from each sale with the artists so that proceeds directly benefit the community and the organizations nonprofit mission.\n\nThis benefit also helps highlight the creative community through its event series, which will be peppered throughout the month. The first, titled “March for Art: UNITE” will kick off on Thursday, March 13, from 4 to 6 p.m. On that date, art professionals, administrators, educators and supporters will march down North American Street.\n\nThis non-political assembly holds the goal of “seeking to generate harmony and promoting the dynamic cultural history of the city as we march together into the future.” After the procession, the public is invited to a special Second Thursday event in Olde Kensington with open galleries at the Crane Arts Building, the Clay Studio and NextFab.\n\n“March for Art: DESIGN” is next up, and this exclusive trunk show will feature locally crafted designer fashions, including from Roberta Gruber, John Wind Jewelry, Manzanita, Nino Brand and many more. The event, set for Saturday, March 15, from noon to 5 p.m., is free and open to the public.\n\nInLiquid is also set to host “March for Art: EAT” ($100) on Thursday, March 20, from 6 to 9 p.m. While there, guests can enjoy an “exclusive gastronomic experience” with Chef Ange Branca of Kampar, plus, sip on some zero-proof cocktails from Bar Palmina and Wallace Dry Goods.\n\nAnd lastly, to round up the experience, “March for Art: BASH” ($100) will be the grand finale. Taking place on Saturday, March 22, from 6 to 10 p.m., locals can head to InLiquid to meet the artists, enjoy the artwork, and support the local arts community before the auction closes up shop. Tickets for all events can be found online.\n\nFor more information on “March for Art” and InLiquid Gallery (1400 N American St Gallery 108), visit inliquid.org",

While Williams has just 62 carries for 307 yards in his NFL career, he has experience on special teams and can return kicks.\n\nSamaje Perine, RB\n\nSimilar to Williams, Samaje Perine also spent time working with Singleton in Cincinnati. Perine is a far more proven NFL running back than Williams and played an important role as the passing down option in the backfield for the Kansas City Chiefs last season. Perine would make plenty of sense as a veteran addition to Philadelphia’s backfield in free agency.\n\nRaheem Mostert, RB\n\nAfter going undrafted in the 2015 NFL Draft, Raheem Mostert was a preseason darling for the Eagles. Yet he was ultimately poached off the team’s practice squad and eventually flourished elsewhere. While Mostert is now 32-years-old, he worked with new Eagles pass game coordinator Parks Frazier with the Miami Dolphins last season and would provide veteran depth in Philadelphia’s backfield.\n\nBraxton Berrios, WR\n\nBritain Covey will likely hit the open market as I don’t expect the Eagles to tender him as a restricted free agent. Therefore, Philadelphia could look for a slot wide receiver with experience as a returner. Braxton Berrios would check both of those boxes and was in Miami with Frazier last season.\n\nAshton Dulin, WR\n\nOutside of Philadelphia’s top three wide receivers, the Eagles could hold a competition for the remaining spots in the room next season. Ashton Dulin has experience working with several members of Philadelphia’s coaching staff due to his time with the Indianapolis Colts. Dulin would provide depth at wide receiver, while also being a core player on special teams.\n\nDurham Smythe, TE\n\nBoth Dallas Goedert and Grant Calcaterra are heading into the final year of their current contracts. While Durham Smythe certainly wouldn’t challenge for a starting, he’s an ideal depth option at tight end. Smythe has plenty of experience with over 3,600 career snaps in the NFL and was with Frazier in Miami last season.\n\nKylen Granson, TE\n\nWhile Kylen Granson didn’t overlap with Nick Sirianni, Kevin Patullo and Jason Michael in Indianapolis, he was there with Frazier. Granson is 26-years-old and has shown plenty of potential in 17 career starts for the Colts. He is an ascending player that averaged 12.5 yards per reception over his last two seasons.\n\nQuintin Morris, TE\n\nThe Buffalo Bills reportedly won’t tender Quintin Morris and he is slated to become an unrestricted free agent. Morris served as a backup tight end in Buffalo, yet he spent two seasons with new Eagles quarterback coach Scot Loeffler at Bowling Green. Loeffler will have insight on Morris and the Eagles could take a chance on his untapped potential.\n\nMo Alie-Cox, TE\n\nAfter a promising season in 2020, Mo Allie-Cox has yet to take the next step that many were anticipating. Now at 31-years-old, Allie-Cox is purely a depth option at the position. Yet Philadelphia’s offensive coaching staff is very familiar with him and could bring him in as experienced insurance behind Goedert and Calcaterra.\n\nKendall Lamm, OL\n\nFred Johnson is slated to hit free agency and the Eagles could look to sign his replacement. Kendall Lamm would be an ideal swing tackle target for next season, as he has played over 1,000 snaps at both left tackle and right tackle in the NFL. Lamm also spent last season in Miami with Frazier, where he started seven games at right tackle and didn’t allow a single sack.\n\nBlake Hance, OL\n\nPhiladelphia’s depth along the offensive line was certainly put to the test at times last season. While Blake Hance certainly isn’t a household name, he would provide depth and positional versatility. Hance was with new Eagles offensive line coach Greg Austin for the last two seasons on the Jacksonville Jaguars. He has started games at both left guard and right tackle in the NFL.\n\nMark Glowinski, OL\n\nIf Mekhi Becton departs in free agency, Eagles could look to add a veteran right guard to compete with Tyler Steen in 2025. Mark Glowinski played for multiples seasons in Indianapolis with several members of Philadelphia’s coaching staff. The 32-year-old veteran has played nearly 6,000 snaps at right guard in the NFL and wouldn’t cost a lot to bring in.\n\nWhich Defensive Free Agents Have Ties to the Eagles?\n\nSep 22, 2024; Cleveland, Ohio, USA; New York Giants linebacker Bobby Okereke (58) and New York Giants linebacker Azeez Ojulari (51) celebrate after a sack during the first quarter against the Cleveland Browns at Huntington Bank Field. Mandatory Credit: Ken Blaze-Imagn Images\n\nPoona Ford, IDL\n\nEagles defensive line coach Clint Hurtt worked with Poona Ford for five seasons during their time together with the Seattle Seahawks. Ford enjoyed a resurgent season with the Los Angeles Chargers in 2024, as he recorded three sacks and five batted passes, including an interception. Ford would provide experience and depth along Philadelphia’s defensive line.\n\nDenzel Perryman, LB\n\nDenzel Perryman played with Ford in Los Angeles last season, as he started 11 games for the NFL’s top scoring defense. Perryman began his NFL career with the Chargers in 2015 and Eagles linebacker coach Bobby King served as the team’s assistant linebacker coach at that time. Now Perryman and King could potentially be reunited a decade later as the Eagles look for help at linebacker.\n\nJustin Strnad, LB\n\nJustin Strnad was selected by the Denver Broncos in the fifth round of the 2020 NFL Draft, which happened to be Vic Fangio’s second season as the team’s head coach. Strnad enjoyed a breakout season for Denver’s stout defense in 2024. The 28-year-old linebacker played 736 snaps and recorded 73 total tackles, eight tackles for loss and three sacks. He could be Philadelphia’s next lottery ticket at linebacker.\n\nCody Barton, LB\n\nAfter being selected in the third round of the 2019 NFL Draft, Cody Barton started just five games across his first three seasons. Yet he has started at least 11 games for three different teams over the last three seasons. Barton was a key player on Denver’s defense in 2024, as he recorded 106 total tackles, two interceptions and 1.5 sacks. Barton also spent four seasons in Seattle with Hurtt.\n\nE.J. Speed, LB\n\nE.J. Speed was in Indianapolis with several key members of Philadelphia’s coaching staff. Yet he didn’t emerge as a full-time starter for the Colts until 2023. Speed has recorded 244 total tackles and three forced fumbles over the last two seasons. Speed will turn 30-years-old in June and likely won’t break the bank in free agency but he would provide the Eagles with starting experience at linebacker.\n\nLorenzo Carter, EDGE\n\nLorenzo Carter hasn’t overlapped with any of Philadelphia’s current coaches but he does have a relationship with Nolan Smith as a former Georgia Bulldog. While they didn’t play together at Georgia, Smith discussed how Carter was one of his mentors. Carter is an experienced edge rusher with 62 career starts in the NFL and would add depth on the outside in Philadelphia.\n\nDeMarcus Walker, EDGE\n\nThe Chicago Bears released DeMarcus Walker in February and he has worked with both Fangio and King in the past. Walker started 29 games over the last two seasons for the Bears and would bring experience to Philadelphia’s defensive front. He’ll turn 31-years-old in September and could help fill the void created by several potential departures for the Eagles this offseason.\n\nEmmanuel Ogbah, EDGE\n\nDuring Fangio’s lone season as the Dolphins defensive coordinator, there were several players that didn’t appreciate his coaching style. While it’s unclear how he felt about Emmanuel Ogbah in Miami, the veteran edge defender called Fangio a “genius” that “definitely evolved my game a lot” back in December of 2023. If Ogbah still feels that way about Fangio, a reunion in the City of Brotherly Love would certainly make sense.\n\nBaron Browning, EDGE\n\nIn Fangio’s final season as head coach of the Broncos, Denver selected Baron Browning in the third round of the 2021 NFL Draft. Browning started nine games at linebacker as a rookie in Fangio’s defense. Yet he was moved to the edge for each of the last three seasons with inconsistent results. At 26-years-old, Browning could revive his career and potentially replicate Baun’s success in Philadelphia.\n\nKhalil Mack, EDGE\n\nKhalil Mack is a proven veteran that has easily had the most decorated career of any player on this list. Yet at 34-years-old, Mack could opt to take less money and chase a Super Bowl with the Eagles. Especially given his relationship with Fangio, who was Chicago’s defensive coordinator when they pulled off a blockbuster deal for Mack in 2018. Mack has referred to Fangio as a “mastermind” in the past.\n\nAzeez Ojulari, EDGE\n\nOct 20, 2024; East Rutherford, New Jersey, USA; New York Giants linebacker Azeez Ojulari (51) takes down Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Jalen Hurts (1) during the first half at MetLife Stadium. Mandatory Credit: Robert Deutsch-Imagn Images\n\nFollowing an inconsistent start to his NFL career with the New York Giants, Azeez Ojulari could revive his career in Philadelphia. Especially given his experience playing with several Eagles players during their time together at Georgia. Ojulari is just 24-years-old and is slightly underrated due to being stuck behind Brian Burns and Kayvon Thibodeaux in New York last season.\n\nFabian Moreau, CB\n\nAfter releasing Darius Slay and with Isaiah Rodgers set to test free agency, Philadelphia could use help at cornerback. Fabian Moreau started 11 games for the Broncos in 2023, while Eagles defensive backs coach Christian Parker served the same role in Denver. While Moreau will turned 31-years-old in April, he has played nearly 4,500 snaps in the NFL and would bring experience to Philadelphia’s young cornerback room.\n\nTremon Smith, CB\n\nThe Eagles will need to add competition at the bottom of their cornerback depth chart and Tremon Smith could make sense as a cheap option there. Smith worked for two seasons with Parker in Denver and was also with several Eagles coaches on the Colts in 2020. He has plenty of experience playing on special teams and has five career starts in the NFL.\n\nJulian Blackmon, S\n\nReed Blankenship has one season remaining on his current contract, therefore the Eagles could look to add a safety in free agency. While Julian Blackmon could command a hefty contract in free agency, Philadelphia could be intrigued by his versatility. Blackmon has played all over with the Colts, including over 500 snaps in the slot. He was in Indianapolis for one season with several members of Philadelphia’s coaching staff.\n\nElijah Campbell, S\n\nIf the Eagles want to add low-cost depth at safety with special teams experience, Elijah Campbell could make sense. Campbell started one game at safety under Fangio for the Dolphins in 2023 and has served as a core special teams player in Miami for several seasons. Campbell would compete for one of the final roster spots at safety in Philadelphia.\n\nPhoto by Stacy Revere/Getty Images",

        "content": "New York City is a city built by immigrants, and we are not just stronger because of our diversity — we are the greatest city on the globe because of it. Since 2022, we have faced an unprecedented influx of asylum seekers across the five boroughs as conditions worsened in countries abroad. Our administration met that influx head-on, offering newcomers food, clothing, and shelter. Thanks to our efforts, over 189,100 of the 232,600 of the migrants — or 81 percent — who requested services from the city in the last three years have taken the next steps in their journeys toward self-sufficiency. Because of the Adams administration’s work to address the international crisis and to support asylum seekers as they pursue their path towards the American Dream, 84 percent of eligible adult migrants have either received work authorization or applied for work authorization. The city also purchased more than 53,200 tickets to help asylum seekers reach their preferred destinations and reduce long-term costs for New York City taxpayers.\n\nWhile we continue to care for those who arrive in our city, last week marked another milestone in demonstrating the immense progress of our unparalleled, international humanitarian effort.\n\nWe announced that The Roosevelt Hotel — which has served as both our Asylum Arrival Center and a Humanitarian Emergency Response and Relief Center for nearly two years — will be closing in the coming months. Thanks to the successful strategies we implemented here in New York City, we are able to help even more asylum seekers take the next steps in their journeys, while simultaneously saving taxpayers millions of dollars.\n\nThe Roosevelt Hotel has been key in allowing us to effectively manage our operations, processing almost 75 percent of migrants who have entered our city asking for shelter over the last two years. Out of the more than 232,600 migrants who have come into the city’s care, over 173,000 registrations were completed at The Roosevelt Hotel between May 2023 and February 2025.\n\nSince the first asylum seekers arrived in New York City in the spring of 2022, we have focused on helping them become self-sufficient. The New York City Department of Small Business Services has connected the migrant population to hundreds of job opportunities. And the administration’s case management and resettlement teams — in conjunction with teams across multiple city agencies — continue to find creative ways to assist recent arrivals, from direct outreach and resource fairs to onsite English as a Second Language courses at shelters.\n\nDuring the height of the influx, the city received an average of 4,000 arrivals each week. Now, because of our administration’s skillful management, we are down to an average of just 350 new arrivals each week. With the closure of our operations at The Roosevelt Hotel, our intake functions and supportive services will now be integrated into other areas of the system.\n\nOur actions have shown an entire nation what can be accomplished when we lead with compassion and resourcefulness. Because of the work we have done, we will emerge from this crisis stronger than ever before. We are all New Yorkers together: anything that affects one of us, affects us all. I have faith in our great city to continue to be a beacon of hope, and a place where people from every corner of the world can build a new life.",

        "title": "Eagles Scouting: Five offensive winners from the NFL Combine – Philly Sports",
        "source": "https://metrophiladelphia.com/",
        "content": "Sign up for our email newsletter to stay up-to-date on the latest local sports news throughout Philadelphia.\n\nDraft season is upon us, Eagles fans. The NFL combine provides NFL team executives and fans an opportunity to watch many of the best College prospects in the Nation perform drills that most believe translate to success in the NFL. There are many instances of players who have exceeded well during the season, not performing the best in Indianapolis and having their draft stock, and value take a nosedive.\n\nListed below are five players who excel while under such intense pressure and being under the proverbial microscope. This group exceeded most of the expectations and pre-conceived notions, and performed at a level that could see them skyrocket up draft boards by late April and possibly into the hands of Eagles GM Howie Roseman.\n\nMatthew Golden, Texas\n\nMatthew is a player many were surprised I had ranked as a first round talent on my first wide receiver rankings, and he somehow showed more than his fans expected at the combine. He ran the fastest 40 time at 4.29 and may not just be a first round talent, but a top 3 WR selected in the draft. Golden is 5’11 191, and takes off like a rocket. He can play every WR spot on the line, has a great catch radius, elite ball tracking skills, and smooth routes.\n\nHe has a lightning fast release that you have to see on film to believe. He is my WR 1 heading into the draft, but could be available later in the first, dependent on the style of receiver teams are looking to draft. Golden is also loyal, when asked who is one person dead or alive he would like to play catch with, he picked his Texas QB, Quinn Ewers.\n\nJack Bech, TCU\n\nMar 1, 2025; Indianapolis, IN, USA; TCU wideout Jack Bech during the 2025 NFL Combine at Lucas Oil Stadium. Mandatory Credit: Kirby Lee-Imagn Images\n\nBech had already impressed at the Senior Bowl, and did so again at the combine. Jack showed off quick, decisive running routes and soft hands. He has the desirable size, and the skill sets to last in the NFL for a long time. Bech offers the fluidity of a small receiver in a big body, which are unique traits at the WR position. A couple of receivers that many had ranked above him did not shine as much as Bech, and he is an option for a team willing to spend a day two selection on a pass catcher to enhance their offense. He will contribute in an NFL offense as a rookie.\n\nTate Ratledge, Georgia\n\nTate has the ideal size and athleticism that Eagles OL Coach Jeff Stoutland loves to bring into Stoutland University. He is a devastating run blocker and finisher, identifies interior pass rushes quickly, and gets to the next level with quickness. Ratledge is 6’6, 308 pounds, and showed off his speed with a 4.97 forty at the combine. His long mullet was flowing in the wind as he sped down Lucas Oil Stadium showcasing an elite, 1993 Phillies, Pete Incaviglia style haircut.\n\nTate also has the experience of going up against Nolan Smith and Jalen Carter in practice every day during his time at Georgia. This is the experience I want to see on the Eagles O-Line.\n\nBhayshul Tuten, Virginia Tech\n\nMar 1, 2025; Indianapolis, IN, USA; Virginia Tech running back Bhayshul Tuten (RB30) during the 2025 NFL Combine at Lucas Oil Stadium. Mandatory Credit: Kirby Lee-Imagn Images\n\nBhayshul has been one of my favorite RB targets for the Eagles since September. After his performance in Indianapolis, they will have a lot more competition for his services than originally thought. Tuten ran the fastest 40 at 4.32 and was first overall in the RB class with a 40.50 inch vertical jump.\n\nHis 40-yard dash time was faster than current Eagles RB Saquon Barkley and the Lions speedy running back Jahmyr Gibbs. Tuten is a home run threat every time he touches the ball and is also a valuable special teams player.\n\nHollin Pierce, Rutgers\n\nMar 1, 2025; Indianapolis, IN, USA; Rutgers University offensive lineman Hollin Pierce (OL32) answers questions at a press conference during the 2025 NFL Combine at Indiana Convention Center. Mandatory Credit: Jacob Musselman-Imagn Images\n\nHollin was a relative unknown pre-combine, I had him selected by the Eagles in my NFL Mock Draft 1.0, but that secret is out of the bag now!\n\nPierce tested freakishly well by showcasing an 88 1/4 inch wingspan, the second widest at the OT position since 1999. He also measured 36-inch arms. You can teach a lot of things, but this body type is not one of them. His size, strong anchor and core, are rare traits that one can imagine Coach Stoutland would love to develop at the U! He is a roadblock in pass pro and a mauler in the running game. Pierce is an ideal developmental OT who will only get better with proper coaching. There is no better destination for him than Philadelphia!\n\nAs always, thank you for reading!\n\nFollow me on X @PHLEagleNews\n\nMandatory Credit: Jacob Musselman-Imagn Images",

China tariffs doubled early: Trump increased tariffs on Chinese goods from 10% to 20% on Monday, a day ahead of schedule. Impact on prices: The tariffs are expected to raise costs on vehicles, food, electronics, and other key imports, while Mexico, Canada, and China weigh countermeasures.\n\n\n\nPresident Donald Trump is moving ahead with 25% tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico, which took effect on Tuesday, while doubling tariffs on Chinese goods to 20% a day earlier than expected.\n\nThe move escalates trade tensions with the U.S.’s three largest trading partners. China, in response, announced Tuesday it would impose additional tariffs of up to 15% on imports of key U.S. farm products, including chicken, pork, soy and beef, and also expanded controls on doing business with key U.S. companies. Canada said it would slap tariffs on more than $100 billion of American goods.\n\nTrump has framed the tariffs as an effort to curb illegal immigration and drug trafficking, particularly fentanyl, while also aiming to rebalance trade and bring more manufacturing back to the U.S. However, the decision has sparked renewed concerns over rising inflation and disruptions to supply chains.\n\nThe United States conducted $2.2 trillion in trade with Mexico, Canada, and China last year, and businesses fear that the new tariffs will push up costs for American consumers while triggering countermeasures that could further disrupt global markets.\n\nImpact on the auto industry\n\nBy the numbers:\n\nThe auto industry is expected to be among the hardest hit, as manufacturers rely on cross-border supply chains between the U.S., Canada, and Mexico.\n\nIn 2024, the U.S. imported:\n\n$79 billion in vehicles from Mexico, the top supplier.\n\n$31 billion in vehicles from Canada.\n\n$81 billion in auto parts from Mexico and $19 billion from Canada.\n\nWith the new tariffs in place, car prices are expected to rise. Analysts at S&P Global Mobility estimate that the tariffs could increase the price of a new car by $3,000, at a time when car costs are already at record highs.\n\nScott Lincicome, a trade analyst at the libertarian Cato Institute, warned that the tariffs will disrupt production, saying, \"You throw 25% tariffs into all that, and it’s just a grenade.\"\n\nChina, another key player in the auto supply chain, exported $18 billion in auto parts to the U.S. last year. With tariffs on Chinese goods now doubled, further cost increases are expected.\n\nFILE - U.S. President Donald Trump speaks at a joint press conference with French President Emmanuel Macron not in the picture at the White House in Washington, D.C., on Feb. 24, 2025.

With oil and natural gas now subject to a 10% tariff, gas prices in the Midwest and Northeast could rise.\n\nFood: Mexico supplies nearly half of U.S. imported vegetables and 40% of fruits, including 90% of avocados. Grocery prices could climb further, adding to consumer frustration over inflation.\n\nTechnology & retail: China remains a top source for cell phones, computers, and electronics. The increased tariffs on Chinese imports could drive up costs on these everyday items.\n\nTrade partners threaten retaliation\n\nThe other side:\n\nCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said his country would slap tariffs on more than $100 billion of American goods over the course of 21 days.\n\nMexican President Claudia Sheinbaum has not yet detailed specific countermeasures but said Mexico is prepared to respond. Mexico had already stationed 10,000 National Guard troops at the border to crack down on smuggling and illegal immigration in an attempt to address U.S. concerns.\n\nThe tariffs announced by China are due to take effect on March 10, though goods already in transit will be exempt until April 12. Imports of U.S. grown chicken, wheat, corn and cotton will face an extra 15% tariff, a notice by the ministry said. Tariffs on sorghum, soybeans, pork, beef, seafoods, fruit, vegetables and dairy products will be increased by 10%.\n\nAlso on Tuesday, Beijing placed 10 more U.S. firms on its unreliable entity list, which would bar them from engaging in China-related import or export activities and from making new investments in the country. Some already likely face restrictions on trade with China if their products can be used for both military and civilian purposes.\n\nThe firms listed are TCOM, Limited Partnership, Stick Rudder Enterprises LLC, Teledyne Brown Engineering, Huntington Ingalls Industries, S3 AeroDefense, Cubic Corporation, TextOre, ACT1 Federal, Exovera and Planate Management Group.\n\nSeparately, China added 15 U.S. companies to its export control list, including aerospace and defense companies like General Dynamics Land Systems and General Atomics Aeronautical Systems, among others.",

The case of measles was diagnosed with a baby girl who was \"too young\" to be vaccinated and recently returned home from an overseas trip.\n\n\n\nMontgomery County Health officials spent most of Monday doing contract tracing of people who may have been exposed to the measles.\n\nThey tell FOX 29 that CHOP clinicians in King of Prussia identified symptoms and alerted health officials.\n\nWhat we know:\n\n\"It’s a detective game. Basically we are trying to figure out who went where and where they went at the time\" said Dr. Richard Lorraine, Medical Director for the Montgomery County Office of Public Health.\n\nOfficials say a baby girl who was too young to be vaccinated contracted the measles virus after a trip abroad.\n\nThe CDC recommends children receive their first measles vaccine at 12–15 months old.\n\nThey say it’s a much different circumstance than the outbreak in West Texas and New Mexico where nearly 200 people now have the virus.\n\nMany of the cases originated in a largely unvaccinated Mennonite community.\n\n\"In that area there’s a lot of spread of measles among a community of unvaccinated individuals. What we have here in Montgomery county is a single case of a very young child who was traveling abroad with her parents and she was too young to have had the vaccine for measles. She was exposed and now she is positive for measles\" said Lorraine.\n\nRelated article\n\nOfficials are warning those potential exposure areas including a China Airlines shuttle bus from JFK airport arriving at the Pho Ha Saigon Restaurant on 575 Adams Avenue February 25th into February 26th..\n\nLater on February 26th at the True North Pediatrics Associates of Plymouth in Plymouth Meeting from 11:45AM to 2:15PM.\n\nAgain several hours later at the CHOP Emergency Department in King of Prussia from about 1PM-3pm.\n\n\"What we are doing is trying to identify those exposure points but even then those people who were exposed have a pretty good likelihood of being immune to measles\" said Lorraine.\n\nAs of Monday, only a single case has been reported.\n\nMeasles can cause a severe rash, fever and other symptoms can remain in the air and on surfaces for up to two hours. An estimated 92-percent of the population has already vaccinated against the virus..\n\nWhat you can do:\n\nIf you think you may have been exposed to measles:\n\nCheck your immunization records to see if you are protected against measles.\n\nTalk to your healthcare provider about the MMR vaccines.\n\nMonitor yourself for symptoms.\n\nWhat they're saying:\n\n\"I don’t want my son to have it. Or ever get it.. ha ha. That’s something I woujldn’ expect to happen nowadays\" said Courtney Robinson of King of Prussia who says her son recently received the MMR vaccine.\n\n\"Thankfully, my daughter is vaccinated. I mean that’s what vaccines are for\" added King of Prussia mom Alex Fayfar.",

Donald Trump's long-threatened tariffs against Canada and Mexico went into effect Tuesday, and the countries are expected to retaliate with their own taxes against the U.S. Overall in 2025, Target expects to see net sales growth of around 1%.\n\n\n\nTarget says there will be \"meaningful year-over-year profit pressure\" in 2025 because of tariffs and other costs.\n\nImpact of tariffs on Target\n\nWhat they're saying:\n\nTarget, in its fourth quarter earnings report released on Tuesday, said it beat expectations for its fourth-quarter profits but revenue did fall to $30.91 billion, from $31.9 billion. The company says its total comparable sales increased 1.5% in the fourth quarter, with store sales declining 0.5% and digital sales increasing 8.7%.\n\nThe earnings report comes amid retailer uncertainty as Americans limit their spending, especially on discretionary items that Target is known for, such as clothing and electronics, The Associated Press notes.\n\nLooking ahead, Target said in its report, \"In light of ongoing consumer uncertainty and a small decline in February net sales, combined with tariff uncertainty and the expected timing of certain costs within the fiscal year, the company expects to see meaningful year-over-year profit pressure in its first quarter relative to the remainder of the year.\"\n\nHowever, Target expects to see net sales growth of around 1% this year, a modest increase in their operating margin rate, and an effective tax rate of 23 to 24%.\n\n\"During February, we saw record performance around Valentines Day. However, our topline performance for the month was soft, as uncharacteristically cold weather across the U.S. affected apparel sales, and declining consumer confidence impacted our discretionary assortment overall,\" said Jim Lee, chief financial officer. \"Looking ahead, we expect to see a moderation in this trend as apparel sales respond to warmer weather around the country, and consumers turn to Target for upcoming seasonal moments such as the Easter holiday. We will continue to monitor these trends and will remain appropriately cautious with our expectations for the year ahead.\"\n\nTrump's tariffs go into effect: What you need to know\n\nBig picture view:\n\nPresident Donald Trump has been threatening tariffs against Canada and Mexico, and they go into effect on Tuesday.

The decision does not affect cyber efforts by other agencies like the CIA or CISA. Experts warn the pause could leave the US vulnerable to cyber threats from Russia and China.\n\n\n\nDefense Secretary Pete Hegseth has ordered a pause on offensive cyberoperations against Russia, rolling back some of the Pentagon’s efforts to counter foreign cyber threats.\n\nA US official, speaking anonymously due to the sensitivity of the matter, confirmed the decision Monday. The move does not impact cyber operations led by other government agencies, including the CIA and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA).\n\nHowever, the Trump administration has also scaled back FBI efforts and other counter-digital security programs, raising concerns among national security and cybersecurity experts about the US response to foreign cyber threats.\n\nWhy did the US pause cyber operations against Russia?\n\nWhat we know:\n\nUS Cyber Command, a division of the Department of Defense, is responsible for military cyber defenses and planning offensive cyberoperations.\n\nThe decision to pause operations was first reported by The Record, though the exact reasoning behind it remains unclear. Meanwhile, the Trump administration has faced mounting criticism for rolling back cyber and election security efforts across multiple federal agencies.\n\nRELATED: Trump pauses aid to Ukraine after Oval Office clash with Zelenskyy\n\nWhat we don't know:\n\nIt is uncertain whether the pause is connected to ongoing US-Russia diplomatic efforts regarding Ukraine.\n\nThe White House has not commented on whether Hegseth’s directive is part of a larger national security strategy. Additionally, no timeline has been provided for when, or if, offensive cyberoperations against Russia will resume.\n\nHow does this decision impact US cybersecurity?\n\nThe other side:\n\nMany national security and cybersecurity experts argue that pausing offensive cyberoperations weakens the US’s ability to counter growing threats from Russia and China.

Concern is growing for the fox, who police say may be pregnant.\n\n\n\nPolice in Washington Township are asking for the public's help to find and catch a fox they say needs their help.\n\nWhat we know:\n\n\"Bingo,\" an injured and possibly pregnant fox, has been seen wandering around the Washington Township Police Station and Senior Center.\n\nPolice say its leg is trapped in a piece of plastic vent that is struck around her neck.\n\nShe is also suffering from mange.\n\nThe founder of An Itch in Time Mangy Fox Rescue says he got a call about the fox hanging around the Washington Township Senior Center in Sewell, New Jersey.\n\nThey’ve set up traps, but the fox literally won’t bite. It is believed that residents are feeding feral cats or leaving out food for the fox, so it isn’t desperate to risk getting trapped going into one for bait food.\n\nRescuers believe the fox is pregnant are worried she'll pass mange, which is a skin disease caused by parasitic mites that burrow into the skin on to her babies, which could kill them and her if not treated.\n\nThe infection has progressed so much that her tail barely has hair on it. It is also believed that the fox got the plastic on itself while possibly looking for food.\n\nWhat they're saying:\n\nPolice say concern continues to grow as they attempt to safely capture her for treatment.\n\nResidents are being urged not to feed the fox, but to contact them if you spot her in your area.\n\n\"They were like there's a fox here with a pipe on its neck, its arm stuck and she is looking kind of raggedy,\" said Luke Ogden about the call he received from the senior center. He’s the founder of An Itch in Time Mangy Fox Rescue.\n\n\"Basking in the sun and there was several den holes that she dug,\" said Ogden about the fox. He and some volunteers began actively working to trap it for treatment.\n\n\"She saw us and ran every bit of 25 miles an hour on three legs,\" he said. \"She visits basically every single night and goes right to the front of the traps. But she's just not food driven enough to risk getting caught for that food,\" said Ogden who believes people are feeding feral cats or leaving out food or bingo which is why she isn't desperate enough to enter a trap for food. Time is critical.\n\n\"She's looking pregnant so we're thinking cause foxes predominantly breed in January and their gestation is about 53 days so she's going to be giving birth in March,\" he said.\n\n\"We have a cat rescue that's going to be going tonight with a drop trap,\" said Ogden about a new type of trap than what they previously used.\n\nWhat's next:\n\nWashington Township Police shared the efforts on FaceBook asking residents not to feed Bingo the Fox which Odgen says is more of an issue than Bingo being dangerous.\n\n\"Generally red fox are curious creatures more like dogs. They don't want anything to do with humans, your pets or your cats,\" he said.\n\nHe hopes they catch the fox in time to take it to a rehabilitation center for treatment so that hopefully she and the babies can be released back into the wild.",

With just two months remaining until the May 7 federal REAL ID enforcement deadline, officials are helping people prepare.\n\n\n\nIt has been years since we heard about the need to get a REAL ID for any domestic flying in the U.S., but after multiple delays, the deadline is here.\n\nGovernment agencies say you have just over two months to get it.\n\nWhat we know:\n\nIn Pennsylvania, obtaining a REAL ID is optional. However, starting May 7, travelers will need a REAL ID-compliant driver’s license or ID card, or another form of federally-acceptable identification (such as a valid passport or military ID) to board a domestic commercial flight, and enter military bases and other federal facilities that require ID at the door.\n\nAnyone looking to travel will need a REAL ID-compliant license or a passport to board domestic flights and enter federal buildings.\n\n\"May 7, which is 64 days away, you will need a Real ID-compliant driver's license or REAL ID-compliant identification card to board a domestic flight,\" said Jana Tidwell, Manager of Public Affairs for PA and DE AAA.\n\nIf you have a valid passport, a REAL ID is optional, but officials say if you like the convenience of traveling with just a license, it might be worth it.\n\n\"Your passport is your golden ticket. If you have that, that will get you through TSA and onto your flight,\" Tidwell added.\n\nA passport is still needed for international travel.\n\nFederal REAL ID regulations require PennDOT to verify a list of documents.\n\nHow to prepare\n\nThe first thing to do to prepare for your REAL ID is to check and see if you need one.\n\nIn Pennsylvania, you do not need a REAL ID in order to drive, vote, access hospitals, visit the post office, access federal courts, or apply for/receive federal benefits such as social security or veterans' benefits.\n\nThe REAL ID online wizard may help you determine if a REAL ID is right for you.\n\nNext, you will want to get your documents together .\n\nPennDOT officials will have to verify original versions or certified copies of multiple documents.\n\nThose documents include proof of identity, proof of social security number, two proofs of current, physical Pennsylvania address and proof od all legal name changes (if applicable).\n\nSome non-U.S. citizens may be required to present additional documentation.\n\nLearn more about REAL ID documentation requirements and download a printable document checklist on PennDOT’s REAL ID Document Check page..\n\nWhat they're saying:\n\nOfficials say they want the message to reach people without passports and without REAL IDs who think they won't need to fly.\n\n\"As the weather starts getting warmer, we know many Pennsylvanians have made exciting travel plans,\" said PennDOT Secretary Mike Carroll. \"With federal REAL ID enforcement beginning on May 7, your travel planning should include making sure you have proper ID to fly. If you want to keep using your driver’s license or photo ID card to fly domestically, you’ll need to upgrade to a REAL ID if you haven’t already.\"\n\n\"I'm here to tell you that the day will come, maybe not tomorrow, maybe not today, but somewhere in the future, where they have to fly, and absent the REAL ID, when they show up at the PHL airport or any airport across the country, it's gonna be ugly,\" Tidwell warned.\n\n\"Many people feel that 'I don't fly, I don't fly at all, I'm not going to bother,' and they likely don't have a passport either. But we all know that life happens, and there will be circumstances—unfortunate family circumstances—where you need to fly, and it's not just an overnight fix to get that REAL ID if you need it in a hurry,\" she explained.\n\nWhen it comes to the travelers at Philadelphia International Airport today, their opinions were mixed.\n\n\"I'm not gonna get a REAL ID because I already have a passport, and I already paid, so I don't want to incur the additional expense,\" said Heidi Meyers.\n\n\"It's always so crowded at the DMV,\" Meyers added.\n\n\"I'm just gonna do it before May 7,\" said Ivan Juzang. \"It's just keeping things moving. It's all about actually trying to be in the shortest line,\" he noted.\n\nWhat's next:\n\nPennDOT is hosting a series of REAL ID Days at driver license centers across the commonwealth to help Pennsylvanians obtain a REAL ID before the enforcement deadline. REAL ID Days are held on Mondays when the centers are typically closed.\n\nFor more information on REAL ID, visit PennDOT’s REAL ID website.\n\nMore resources are available to obtain a REAL ID in New Jersey, Pennsylvania or Delaware.",

All parades are supposed to be off the street by 11:30 a.m. Police are warning that they may cancel the parades if conditions warrant.\n\nThe National Weather Service has issued a High Wind Watch for the entire southern coast of Louisiana.

FOX 29 is highlighting the many women firefighters who tackled the blaze and more while in the male-dominated fiels. Firefighters showed off their skills during a training session at the Montgomery County Fire Academy on Monday night.\n\n\n\nTwo weeks ago, an out-of-control fire was raging at a Montgomery County factory.\n\nHundreds of firefighters from 64 different companies battled the flames.\n\nOn Monday, the third night of Women's History Month, there is a new push to highlight the women firefighters among those heroes and to encourage more women to get involved.\n\nWhat they're saying:\n\nKylee Hall, a 23-year-old volunteer with the Bryn Mawr Fire Company for the last two and a half years, lives in a fire company-owned house right down the road as part of a live-in program.\n\n\"We wake up in the middle of the night, leave our families, and we still have to go to work in the morning,\" Hall said.\n\nShe and several of her female peers showed off some of their skills at a training session at the Montgomery County Fire Academy on Monday night.\n\nMany of these women helped battle the massive factory fire in Abington two weeks ago.\n\nThese women are committed to their volunteer work in a male-dominated field.\n\n\"I'm also a chemical engineer, so I'm very used to the male-dominated field,\" Hall said. \"At the end of the day, when we're at a fire, when I have my helmet and my mask on, there's no difference. As long as you can do the job, you're equally respected.\"\n\nAccording to the National Volunteer Fire Council, in Pennsylvania, the number of volunteers has shrunk from 300,000 in the 1970s to just 38,000 in 2018.\n\n\"We're recruiting men, women, high schoolers—anyone who wants to join our ranks. We welcome them with open arms,\" said George Wilmot, Flourtown Fire Chief and past president of the Montgomery County Fire Chiefs Association.\n\nWilmot says 90% of the county relies on volunteers. \"What's happening now is we are calling more companies in for a single fire. You're getting 5-6-7 companies for a single fire, whereas before you'd get 2 or 3 because you'd have the sheer numbers needed,\" he explained.\n\nMontgomery County has launched a multi-year recruitment campaign to address the critical shortage.\n\n\"You come in, we get you the gear and the training. Everything you need is basically free,\" Wilmot said.\n\nIn return, Hall says you gain valuable leadership and life skills, make great friends who are like family, and give back to the local community all at the same time. \"The most thrilling part about it is being there for the community and being able to support people in a way that a lot of other people can't,\" Hall said.\n\nFor more information on the Montco recruitment effort, head to their website.",

        "content": "The Brief All it took was 90 seconds for White House diplomacy to unwind in extraordinary fashion. President Trump’s thrashing of Ukraine’s Volodymyr Zelenskyy leaves the future of the U.S.-Ukraine relationship in mortal jeopardy.\n\n\n\nA shouting match that unfolded in the final minutes of a meeting between President Donald Trump and Ukraine President Volodymur Zelenskyy has destroyed – at least for now – hopes that the U.S. will be a reliable partner in helping to end Russia’s three-year invasion.\n\nAll it took was 90 seconds for weeks of tortured diplomacy to unwind in spectacular fashion.\n\nIt also stressed the profound ways Trump feels emboldened to redirect U.S. foreign policy priorities toward his \"America First\" agenda in ways that extend well beyond those of his tumultuous first term.\n\nWhat happened at the meeting?\n\nThe backstory:\n\nIt started off cordially enough, as Trump and Zelenskyy spoke politely, even with admiration, of one another for the first half-hour of the meeting. Trump even suggested he would continue some military assistance to Ukraine until he could secure an enduring peace deal with Russia.\n\nBut when the Ukrainian leader raised alarm about trusting any promises from Russia’s Vladimir Putin to end the fighting, Vice President JD Vance rebuked him for airing disagreements with Trump in public. It instantly shifted the tenor of the conversation. Zelenskyy grew defensive, and Trump and his vice president blasted him as ungrateful and \"disrespectful\" and issued stark warnings about future American support.\n\nRELATED: Zelenskyy on FOX: ‘Spat’ during Oval Office meeting ‘not good for both sides’\n\n\"What kind of diplomacy, JD, you are speaking about?\" Zelenskyy said, listing Russia’s past violations of ceasefires. \"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"I’m talking about the kind of diplomacy that’s going to end the destruction of your country,\" Vance responded before tearing into the Ukrainian leader. \"Mr. President, with respect, I think it’s disrespectful for you to come into the Oval Office to try to litigate this in front of the American media.\"\n\nTrump then let loose, warning the Ukrainian leader, \"You’re gambling with World War III, and what you’re doing is very disrespectful to the country, this country that’s backed you far more than a lot of people say they should have.\"\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump shouts at Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in the Oval Office at the White House on February 28, 2025 in Washington, DC. (Photo by Andrew Harnik/Getty Images)\n\nAt another point, Trump declared himself \"in the middle,\" seeming to formally break from years of American support for Ukraine. He went on to deride Zelenskyy’s \"hatred\" for Putin as a roadblock to peace.\n\n\"You see the hatred he’s got for Putin,\" Trump said. \"That’s very tough for me to make a deal with that kind of hate.\"\n\n\"It’s going to be a very hard thing to do business like this,\" Trump said to Zelenskyy as the two leaders talked over each other.\n\nRELATED: Trump-Zelenskyy meeting gets heated: 'Gambling with World War III'\n\nSources close to Zelenskyy told Fox News Digital that tempers had flared even before the event began. The Ukrainian president was apparently presented with a minerals for security agreement by the Trump administration prior to the press event, but the deal included no security guarantees to protect Ukraine from another Russian invasion.\n\nZelenskyy had warned repeatedly ahead of his trip to Washington, D.C., that, in order to reach a mineral agreement, Kyiv needed these security assurances. Even so, he angered Trump and Vance by rejecting the deal, the source said.\n\nWhat’s next for Ukraine?\n\nBig picture view:\n\nThe encounter left the future of the U.S.-Ukraine relationship, and Kyiv’s ability to defend itself in the brutal conflict with Russia, in mortal jeopardy.\n\nWhat's next:\n\nZelenskyy was in London Saturday to meet with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer before a summit Sunday of European leaders.\n\nRELATED: Ukraine's Zelenskyy says he'll step down in exchange for NATO membership\n\nThe summit on Sunday will also include leaders from France, Germany, Denmark, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Spain, Turkey, Finland, Sweden, Czechia and Romania, as well as the NATO secretary-general and the presidents of the European Commission and European Council.\n\nWhat did Trump say after the meeting?\n\nWhat they're saying:\n\n\"It didn’t work out exactly great, from his standpoint,\" Trump told reporters outside the White House. \"I think he very much overplayed his hand. We’re looking for peace. We’re not looking for somebody that’s gonna sign up a strong power, and then not make peace because they feel emboldened, and that’s what I saw happening … We’re not looking to go into a 10-year war and play games. We want peace. It was just my impression … that he’s looking for something that I’m not looking for, he’s looking to go on and fight, fight, fight.\"\n\nWhat did Zelenskyy say after the meeting?\n\nWhat they're saying:\n\nZelenskyy used a series of posts on X to express his thanks to the American people, Trump and Congress for \"all the support,\" which he said Ukrainians \"have always appreciated,\" especially during the war.\n\n\"Our relationship with the American President is more than just two leaders; it’s a historic and solid bond between our peoples. That’s why I always begin with words of gratitude from our nation to the American nation,\" he added. Ukrainians \"only strong relations with America, and I really hope we will have them,\" he said.\n\nWhat did Congress say after the meeting?\n\nWhat they're saying:\n\nCongressional Republicans were united in their praise of Trump following the meeting, while Democrats expressed horror at the unprecedented lack of diplomacy.\n\nSouth Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, called the meeting a \"complete, utter disaster\" and suggested U.S. support for Ukraine could end because of it.

I was very proud of JD Vance standing up for our country. We want to be helpful. What I saw in the Oval Office was disrespectful, and I don't know if we can ever do business with Zelenskyy again,\" Graham, chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, said. \"The way he handled the meeting, the way he confronted the president, was just over the top.\"\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, posted on X that the \"days of America being taken advantage of and disrespected are OVER.\"\n\n\"What we witnessed in the Oval Office today was an American President putting America first,\" he said.\n\nDemocrats strongly criticized the exchange.\n\n\"Trump and Vance are doing Putin's dirty work,\" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said. \"Senate Democrats will never stop fighting for freedom and democracy.\"\n\n\"President Trump and his administration continue to embarrass America on the world stage,\" House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries said \"Today’s White House meeting with the President of Ukraine was appalling and will only serve to further embolden Vladimir Putin, a brutal dictator.\"\n\nWhat did other world leaders say after the meeting?\n\nWhat they're saying:\n\nGerman President Frank-Walter Steinmeier criticized Trump in unusually sharp terms for his behavior during the meeting with Zelenskyy at the Oval Office.\n\n\"Diplomacy fails when negotiating partners are humiliated in front of the whole world,\" Steinmeier told dpa, the German news agency, during a flight to Uruguay. \"The scene in the White House yesterday took my breath away. I would never have believed that we would one day have to protect Ukraine from the USA.\"\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron said if someone is gambling with World War III, it is not Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy but more likely his Russian counterpart.\n\nMacron reacted to Friday’s heated exchange between U.S. President Donald Trump and Zelenskyy in the Oval Office, during which Trump accused Zelenskyy of \"gambling with World War III.\"\n\n\"If anyone is gambling with World War III, his name is Vladimir Putin,\" Macron said.\n\n\"My hope is that the United States of America will continue to stand by its history and its principles,\" he said. \"Whenever we have had major conflicts, the United States of America has been on the right side of history and freedom.\"",

The victim's mother is looking to track down the Uber driver to thank him for his heroic actions.\n\n\n\nA rideshare driver is being called a hero because of his quick actions and calling 911 for his passenger.\n\nThat passenger, a 41-year-old man, is fighting for his life in the hospital. He was on the way to his job in an Uber when he suffered a medical emergency.\n\nNow, his family is working to track down the driver and thank them.\n\nWhat we know:\n\nOn February 25, 41-year-old Justin Anderson called an Uber to take him to his new job in Warminster.\n\nHis mother, Debbie, says he left Lebanon Avenue in Philadelphia around 7 a.m., and at some point during that ride, he suffered a brain hemorrhage.\n\nThe driver quickly pulled over, called 911, and an ambulance arrived within minutes.\n\nJustin Anderson remains in a coma at Abington Hospital, but his mother says she’s convinced he would not be alive today without the quick thinking of a man she calls a hero.\n\n\"It gives me a little bit more faith in humanity,\" said Debbie Anderson. \"I was so thankful because had he taken any time or not responded the way he did, Justin wouldn’t be here. I really believe that,\"\n\nDoctors told Debbie that most people with brain hemorrhages die, so every second mattered.\n\nThey said her son probably would not have survived without that Uber driver’s quick response.\n\nNow, she would love to personally thank him for saving her son’s life.\n\n\"It’s so important to get involved and not just disregard things. You don’t realize they’re so important, but they are, and he was quick-thinking in it, and I really think that has a big part of why Justin is still here right now,\" she said. \"I would hug him and thank him. I am so appreciative of what he did.\"\n\nWhat's next:\n\nFOX 29 reached out to Uber to help find the hero driver. A representative says they’re trying to track him down so Debbie can possibly meet him face to face.\n\nIf you know this Uber driver, please contact us!\n\nJustin has a long recovery ahead, so there’s a GoFundMe set up to help. If you’d like to donate.",

        "content": "The Brief Federal employees are receiving a second email requiring them to list their accomplishments. This round is being sent directly by agencies, making noncompliance harder to avoid. Trump and Musk continue their push to tighten oversight and reduce the federal workforce.\n\n\n\nFederal employees have begun receiving a second round of emails requiring them to list their recent accomplishments, a renewed push by President Donald Trump and billionaire adviser Elon Musk to scrutinize the government workforce.\n\nInitially expected to go out on Saturday, the emails started appearing in some employees' inboxes late Friday, according to a person familiar with the plan who spoke to the Associated Press on condition of anonymity.\n\nThe first email, sent a week ago, asked workers \"What did you do last week?\" and required them to list five completed tasks. However, the request led to confusion and pushback, with many agencies telling employees not to respond or issuing conflicting guidance.\n\nLess than half of federal workers complied, according to the White House.\n\nWhat’s changing in the second email?\n\nWhat we know:\n\nUnlike the first email, which was distributed by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), this round will come directly from individual agencies, which have the power to enforce compliance. The change is expected to make it easier to discipline employees who fail to respond.\n\nLeader of the Department of Government Efficiency Elon Musk wears a shirt that says \"Tech Support\" as he speaks during a cabinet meeting with US President Donald Trump at the White House in Washington, DC, on February 26, 2025. (Leader of the Department of Government Efficiency Elon Musk wears a shirt that says \"Tech Support\" as he speaks during a cabinet meeting with US President Donald Trump at the White House in Washington, DC, on February 26, 2025.)\n\nAt Trump's first Cabinet meeting of his second term, Musk defended the demand, calling it a \"pulse check\" to ensure that government workers \"have a pulse and two neurons.\" Trump backed Musk's approach, claiming that some federal employees \"don’t exist\" or are no longer alive—though he provided no evidence to support the claim.\n\nWhat we don't know:\n\nIt remains unclear how national security agencies will handle the request. After the first email, agencies handling classified work told employees not to respond due to security concerns. The White House has not specified how the new email will apply to these departments.\n\nAdditionally, Trump and Musk have not outlined what consequences workers might face if they fail to respond again. Trump has suggested that those who ignored the first request are \"on the bubble\" and at risk of being fired or investigated.\n\nJob cuts and buyouts already underway\n\nWhat's next:\n\nWhile federal employees await more clarity on the email, layoffs are already beginning.\n\nThe Education Department has offered $25,000 buyouts to some employees, warning them of an impending \"very significant Reduction in Force.\" The agency has set a Monday deadline for workers to accept the buyout offer.\n\nA memo circulated this week indicated that large-scale layoffs and program consolidations are expected across multiple agencies as part of Trump’s government restructuring efforts.",

McMahon will now lead the Department of Education.\n\nWhat will happen to the Department of Education?\n\nBig picture view:\n\nLinda McMahon admitted that only Congress has the power to close the Department of Education, but she pledged to conserve Title I money for low-income schools, Pell grants for low-income college students, and the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program.\n\nRELATED: Is FAFSA part of the Education Department?

During the 2024 presidential campaign, Donald Trump pledged to close the Department of Education and grant its authority to states.\n\nAnd when he returned to the White House after his election win, Trump signed sweeping orders to eliminate America’s schools’ diversity programs and accommodations for transgender students while also pushing for expanded school choice programs, the Associated Press noted.\n\nThe White House has also considered an executive order that would direct the education secretary to cut the Department of Education as much as legally possible while asking Congress to shut it down completely.\n\nAccording to the AP, the Trump administration gave schools and colleges nationwide a Feb. 28 deadline to eliminate diversity programs or risk having their federal money pulled by the administration.\n\nWho is Linda McMahon?\n\nLinda McMahon is a billionaire and former CEO of World Wrestling Entertainment. The 76-year-old is an unconventional pick for the Education Department role.\n\nRELATED: Linda McMahon: A look at the background of Trump’s pick for Education secretary\n\nMcMahon spent a year on Connecticut’s state board of education and is a longtime trustee at Sacred Heart University, but otherwise has little traditional education leadership.\n\nShe also gave millions of dollars to Trump’s campaigns and served as leader of the Small Business Administration during his first term.\n\nWhat is the Department of Education?\n\nThe Education Department was established in 1979, and the agency’s key role is to distribute money to schools and colleges in the U.S. The department sends billions of dollars annually to K-12 schools and manages a $1.6 trillion federal student loan portfolio, the Associated Press noted.\n\nThe Source: Information for this story was provided by previous LIVENOW from FOX reporting and the Associated Press, which provides background on Linda McMahon and the Department of Education.

Mexico and Canada face 25% tariffs starting Tuesday, with a 10% rate on Canadian energy. Stock market dips 2% amid concerns over inflation and trade retaliation.\n\n\n\nPresident Donald Trump has officially doubled tariffs on Chinese imports to 20% and confirmed that 25% tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada will take effect Tuesday.\n\nThe move, which Trump says is aimed at curbing fentanyl trafficking and illegal immigration, has renewed fears of a trade war with America’s top three trading partners.\n\nRELATED: Trump: 25 percent tariffs on imports from Mexico, Canada to start Tuesday\n\nThe U.S. conducted nearly $2.2 trillion in trade with Mexico, Canada, and China last year, and businesses are bracing for higher prices and possible retaliation. Canadian Foreign Minister Mélanie Joly has already announced.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump speaks during a Cabinet meeting at the White House on February 26, 2025 in Washington, DC. (Photo by Andrew Harnik/Getty Images)\n\nWhat to expect from the new tariffs\n\nThe backstory:\n\nThe latest tariffs mark the most aggressive trade measures of Trump’s presidency, with major implications across multiple industries.\n\nTrump first imposed a 10% tariff on Chinese imports in February but doubled the rate after what he described as China’s failure to stop fentanyl trafficking into the U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent defended the move, telling CBS News that China would \"eat\" the cost of the tariffs rather than passing them on to American consumers.\n\nHowever, analysts warn that companies like Ford and Walmart could see major cost increases, potentially raising prices on everyday goods.\n\nMexico and Canada face 25% tariffs\n\nWhat's next:\n\nTrump had previously granted Mexico and Canada a one-month delay on tariffs while both nations pledged efforts to crack down on drug smuggling and illegal immigration.\n\nHowever, he declared Monday that \"there’s no room left\" for negotiations. Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum has signaled that her country is prepared to respond, while Canada is imposing counter-tariffs and continuing diplomatic efforts.\n\nThe new duties will also impact key energy imports from Canada, including oil, natural gas, and electricity, which will be taxed at a reduced 10% rate. This is expected to raise fuel costs in the U.S., particularly in the Northeast and Midwest.\n\nHow businesses and consumers could be impacted\n\nWhy you should care:\n\nCompanies ranging from auto manufacturers to grocery chains have warned of price hikes resulting from the tariffs.\n\nThe Peterson Institute for International Economics estimates that American families could face an average cost increase of over $1,000 per year due to higher import prices.\n\nS&P Global Mobility has also projected that tariffs on auto imports from Mexico and Canada could raise new car prices by $3,000 on average, further straining an already expensive auto market.",

The U.S. won that game 3-1.\n\nNHL STAR DISHES ON TEAM USA PLAYERS' AMERICAN PRIDE: 'HAVEN'T SEEN THAT FROM AMERICANS IN GENERAL'\n\nThe Canadian national anthem was then booed at TD Garden in Boston before a 4 Nations game between Canada and Finland.\n\nThe U.S. and Canada then met in the final Feb. 20, and American fans in Boston once again booed the Canadian national anthem, albeit with a lighter tone. Canada won the game in overtime, 3-2.\n\nSince then, hostile rhetoric between the two countries, including in sports, has only escalated.\n\nCanadian men’s soccer coach Jesse Marsch blasted Trump for his \"51st state\" remarks, calling them \"insulting\" Wednesday.\n\nDuring CONCACAF Nations League media day Wednesday, Marsch didn’t hold back his opinion on Trump’s comments, saying he was \"ashamed\" of how Canada was insulted by the president.\n\n\"If I have one message to our president, it’s lay off the ridiculous rhetoric about Canada being the 51st state,\" Marsch said. \"As an American, I’m ashamed of the arrogance and disregard we’ve shown one of our historically oldest, strongest and most loyal allies. But one thing’s for sure, when I look forward a month from now, this will fuel our team. The mentality we have, the will we have to play for our country.\"\n\nNHL legend Wayne Gretzky has also been criticized by fellow Canadians for his apparent support of Trump.\n\nTrump recently said he asked Gretzky to become the next \"governor of Canada\" after Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced he would be resigning.\n\nBut after Gretzky expressed support for \"Canada remaining a separate Country, rather than becoming a cherished and beautiful 51st State,\" Trump declared Gretzky a \"free agent.\"\n\nThat prompted hockey legend Bobby Orr, a fellow Canadian, to write in the Toronto Sun that he was disappointed to read criticism about Gretzky, someone he considers one of the \"greatest Canadians ever.\"\n\n\"How fickle can people be, when someone who has given so much time and effort to Canadian hockey is treated in such a way,\" Orr wrote. \"Listen, we all have our personal beliefs as they pertain to things such as religion and politics. Wayne respects your right to such beliefs – why can’t you respect his?\"\n\nJanet Gretzky, Wayne's wife, read Orr's column, and she reacted on social media.\n\n\"Thank you Mr. Bobby Orr. Your words mean the world to Wayne and his family , i have never met anyone who is more Proud to be a Canadian and it has broken his heart to read and see the mean comments. He would do anything to make Canadians Proud , with his Love for Hockey and his Country,\" Janet wrote in an Instagram post in which she shared Orr's column.\n\nTrump agreed Feb. 3 to pause tariffs for 30 days, which means they’re expected to be imposed in early March. The tariffs imposed on Canada by Trump are a response to drug trafficking at the U.S.-Canadian border.\n\nRead more from FOX News Digital",

I'm going to miss it. I'm going to miss all of the guys.\"\n\nJohnson, 81, called the job the \"most fun\" he had in his career.\n\nThe announcement did not come as a surprise. Ahead of the Super Bowl, FOX aired a tribute to Johnson's career.\n\nWhen asked about retirement at the time, the former Cowboys coach would not say one way or the other.\n\nJohnson first appeared on FOX 31 years ago. He worked with the network from 1994-1995 after leaving the Cowboys and then rejoined FOX from 2002-2024 after coaching the Miami Dolphins.\n\n\"I loved every minute of it,\" Johnson said. \"Thanks to FOX Sports. It was really the best time of my entire career.\"\n\nWhat they're saying:\n\n\"Jimmy served as an inspiration to generations of football fans with his legendary swagger, one-of-a-kind insight and signature humor. From his motivating pep talks to his unmatched energy over the years, he was our coach who always pushed us to be better,\" said FOX Sports CEO and Executive Producer Eric Shanks in a statement. \"Coach will be sincerely missed and we wish him the best as he sets sail into retirement, like only Jimmy Johnson can.\"",

The Philadelphia Eagles are releasing the six-time Pro Bowl cornerback, a source told CBS Sports' Jonathan Jones.\n\nSlay said before Super Bowl LIX that he wanted to play one more season and \"would love for it to be a Philadelphia Eagle.\"\n\nThe 34-year-old could still return to the Eagles. The Eagles are cutting Slay with a post-June 1 designation, which will save the team $4.3 million in cap space, according to ESPN's Adam Schefter.\n\n\"Thankful for this organization, for trading for me, and making some of my dreams possible,\" Slay said during Super Bowl week. \"I always dreamed about playing in the Super Bowl, and this is my second time. I know a lot of guys that didn't make to the playoffs for a lot of years or played in the playoffs but didn't make it past the second round.\"\n\nPhiladelphia could still bring Slay back on a cheaper contract this offseason. It wouldn't be the first time. The Eagles reportedly planned on releasing Slay in March 2023 but signed him to a two-year extension a day later.\n\nSlay teamed with rookies Quinyon Mitchell and Cooper DeJean to help turn the Eagles' defense into the NFL's best unit in Year 1 under defensive coordinator Vic Fangio. The Birds allowed an NFL-best 174.2 passing yards per game and 278.4 ypg in 2024.\n\nThe defense's transformation was a key factor in the Eagles winning their second Super Bowl in franchise history, clobbering the Kansas City Chiefs, 40-22.\n\nAccording to Pro Football Focus, Slay still performed well in 2024. PFF graded him at 73.3, which was higher than his 2023 grade.\n\nWith Mitchell and DeJean establishing themselves in Year 1 and the Eagles facing difficult free-agent decisions, Slay may end up being a cap casualty.\n\nEagles general manager Howie Roseman has decisions on four key free agents: Zack Baun, a Defensive Player of the Year finalist; defensive lineman Milton Williams; edge rusher Josh Sweat; and guard Mekhi Becton.\n\nAt the NFL Scouting Combine last week, Roseman hinted that changes are coming to the Eagles in 2025.\n\n\"It may look different — some of the moves that we may have to make here may not be what are necessarily on other people's minds,\" Roseman said. \"It's probably not going to look like maybe the conventional wisdom thinks it should look. I would just ask our fans to just have patience throughout the offseason. The offseason doesn't stop in free agency. The offseason doesn't stop in the draft.\"",

Beach communities in South Jersey and Delaware were all in the medium range.\n\n\"They are not in a very high category, but still they are not in a low category either,\" Ganatra said.\n\nGanatra said microplastic dangers are everywhere, but the ocean is a big concern with estimates that there are now 170 trillion pieces of plastic in the ocean, more than 21,000 for every person on the planet.\n\n\"That's kinda scary,\" said Lopez.\n\nWhile Lopez is worried, others who live at the Jersey Shore aren't.\n\n\"It's not going to stop me from doing anything here,\" Curt Goldman said.\n\n\"I will put my feet in it and enjoy it,\" Missy Schock said.\n\nResearchers said the science is still emerging and instead of avoiding the ocean, people should be more mindful of protecting it.

One child has died from measles in Texas, where an outbreak has infected more than 140 people this year.\n\n\"Because of how contagious the measles is, there's always a chance of an outbreak, and outbreaks start with a single case,\" said Dr. Alvin Wang, chief medical officer at the Montgomery County Department of Public Safety.\n\nWang said the patient went to some other public locations where exposures may have occurred as well.\n\nWhere did the patient contract measles?\n\nCBS News Philadelphia has learned that the patient is a little boy who recently traveled to Vietnam. He had symptoms when he was seen at the pediatrician's office in Plymouth Meeting and at CHOP King of Prussia but is now recovering at home.\n\nThe child who has measles is too young to be vaccinated.\n\n\"If there's a chance that you were in one of the locations at the same time that this individual was, then the next step is to check your vaccination status and certainly be vigilant for symptoms of the measles to develop,\" Wang said.\n\nWhat is measles?\n\nMeasles, which is caused by a virus, is one of the most contagious diseases and can cause severe infections in the lungs and brain that can lead to cognitive issues, deafness or death. Doctors and health officials say the vaccine, which is normally given as part of the combination measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine, is highly safe and effective. The first dose of the MMR vaccine can't be given until children turn one, so babies are especially susceptible.\n\nMeasles is transmitted through the air from coughing and sneezing.\n\n\"Measles is one of the most infectious diseases that we know,\" Dr. Robert Danoff, of Jefferson Health, told CBS News Philadelphia last year.\n\nMeasles symptoms — which include a rash, fever, cough, runny nose, and red and watery eyes — start to appear one to two weeks after a patient is exposed, according to the CDC. A person who's been infected can start to spread the virus before showing symptoms.\n\nMontgomery County officials said the MMR vaccine is available with local health care providers and pharmacies and have posted more information on the county website\n\nIf you suspect that you or your child have measles and wish to seek care, the county says you should call your health care provider, urgent care or hospital emergency room before leaving home, or contact the Office of Public Health at 610-278-5117 to plan a safe visit and reduce exposure for staff and other patients. Health care providers should report suspected cases of measles immediately to OPH at 610-278-5117 or after hours at 610-635-4300.\n\nand contributed to this report.",

More on that in just a bit. First, we'll take a quick look back at the winter.\n\nA look back at meteorological winter in Philadelphia\n\nThe winter season ended up colder than normal, with both below-normal averages for the highs AND the lows. It's not a record, or even that far off normal, but below nonetheless. The warmest temperature we had was 66 degrees in late December, while the coldest hit just 10 degrees about a month later.\n\nWith that being said, the precipitation — or lack thereof — remains the big story. Average precipitation in Philly for those three months is just shy of 10 inches. We had just 6.43 inches this past season, a whopping 3.42 inch deficit, but that doesn't tell the whole story.\n\nIf we go back to Sept. 1, our total deficit is a staggering -10.91 inches, nearly a FOOT below normal. Not snow, but rain! That's why the area remains in an extreme drought and fire danger will continue to be very elevated. As for snow, we only had 8.1 inches, when the normal snow for the period is 19 inches, thus adding insult to injury in both the drought situation and for snow lovers.\n\nCBS News Philadelphia\n\nNEXT Weather Alert in effect for Wednesday\n\nTuesday will be another rain-free day, but temps will rebound to the mid to upper-50s with increasing clouds ahead of a vigorous spring storm system. While we will see more cloud cover on Tuesday, it'll be a pretty decent day with warmer air and a gusty breeze developing in the afternoon.\n\nWednesday is a NEXT Weather Alert Day for the possibility of heavy rain and severe storms. Gusty southwest winds will push our temperatures to the low 60s, and by late afternoon and evening, a strong cold front will bring strong to severe storms with pockets of heavy rain. The state of Delaware is in a slight (level 2) risk for severe weather on Wednesday, while the rest of our region is in a marginal (level 1) risk.\n\nThe biggest threat with any severe storm locally will be damaging straight-line winds, although we cannot rule out the potential for an isolated tornado. This line of storms will also bring the likelihood of heavy rainfall, with as much as three-quarters of an inch to 1.5 inches falling over just a few hours, leading to possible ponding and road spray during the Wednesday evening commute. While we do need a good soaking rain, the timing is less than ideal.\n\nCBS News Philadelphia\n\nPhiladelphia weather forecast for the rest of the week\n\nBehind the storm on Thursday, it's seasonably chilly with a gusty wind that will make it feel much colder. On Friday, we hover near 50 with sunshine and less wind.\n\nRain showers are once again possible on Saturday.\n\nDon't forget, daylight saving time begins next Sunday morning, so flip the clocks ahead one hour next Saturday night and change the batteries in your smoke and carbon monoxide detectors.\n\nSpeaking of Sunday, models are in massive disagreement about the forecast weather pattern, although one of them wants to cool us down and bring some March snow. The NEXT Weather Team will keep you posted ahead of the storm!\n\nHere's the 7-day forecast:\n\nCBS News Philadelphia\n\nTuesday: Dry and warmer. High 57, low 28.\n\nWednesday: NEXT Weather Alert for storms. High 62, low 46.\n\nThursday: Windy. High 51, low 47.\n\nFriday: High 51, low 32.\n\nSaturday: Partly cloudy. High 54, low 40.\n\nSunday: Winter mix?? High 40, low 30.\n\nMonday: Mostly cloudy.

        "content": "After growing concerns, a federal judge has put a temporary hold on the Trump administration's plan to reduce medical research funding. But the National Institutes of Health has lost jobs and there's a slow down on administrative actions.\n\nDoctors say millions of people take medications that resulted from years of research. And there are currently hundreds of potential new treatments in the pipeline.\n\nThe pending research cuts have many worried, including a Montgomery County professor who depends on the research.\n\nEquations are always running through Michelle Francl-Donnay's mind at a Bryn Mawr College, where she's a chemistry professor.\n\nFrancl-Donnay says her ability to move and work depends on a drug she takes for Parkinson's disease. Without it, she says writing a simple equation on a board would be impossible.\n\nCBS Philadelphia\n\nThe drug L-Dopa is the standard of care for treating the degenerative disease.\n\n\"Without it, I would be disabled,\" Francl-Donnay said. \"For me, it's really given me back my life.\"\n\nThe drug is made from a molecule she admires, calling it magic. But it took years of research to develop.\n\n\"Research isn't something where you know, oh, I'm gonna design a drug and make the molecule and I know automatically what this will do,\" she said. \"It's sort of like wandering around and exploring new worlds.\"\n\nThose research worlds are bracing for funding cutbacks as the Trump administration wants to slash what White House spokesperson Kush Desai calls wasteful spending.\n\n\"Contrary to the hysteria, redirecting billions of allocated NIH spending away from opaque administrative expenses means there will be more money and resources available for legitimate scientific research, not less,\" Desai said.\n\nFrancl-Donnay disagrees.\n\n\"We'll lose a whole generation of ideas and thoughts and drugs and treatments,\" Francl-Donnay said.\n\nCBS Philadelphia\n\nShe's angry about the pending research cuts that she thinks will impact millions of families.\n\n\"Shingles, Crohn's disease, cancer, Parkinson's, Alzheimer's. The things that change lives are what's happening in these labs,\" she said. \"Without it, we wouldn't have those treatments. And those touch really everybody.\"\n\nAnd it's not just treatments at stake, she's worried that life saving cures could be lost too.\n\nUnderstanding that science and medicine are complicated and advances take time, she's hoping time doesn't run out.\n\nCBS News Philadelphia has reached out to Penn and CHOP, who receive big funding grants from NIH. They declined on camera interviews but said they're monitoring the situation and hope to protect the invaluable research funding that comes from the government.",

        "content": "How the Eagles helped New Orleans terror attack survivor during \"dark\" time\n\nHow the Eagles helped New Orleans terror attack survivor during \"dark\" time\n\nHow the Eagles helped New Orleans terror attack survivor during \"dark\" time\n\nThe Philadelphia Eagles enter the offseason as the defending Super Bowl champions after a dominant win over the Kansas City Chiefs in which the defensive line sacked quarterback Patrick Mahomes six times.\n\nJosh Sweat and Milton Williams — two important pieces on the defensive line — will likely head elsewhere in free agency. Still, the Eagles could make a blockbuster deal that lands them arguably the best defensive player in the league.\n\nDefensive end Myles Garrett, a six-time Pro Bowler, four-time First-Team All-Pro and the 2023 AP Defensive Player of the Year, requested a trade from the Cleveland Browns in February.\n\nAccording to The Athletic, the Eagles have \"real\" interest in acquiring the 29-year-old.\n\nHere's why the move makes sense for the Eagles.\n\nWhy Myles Garrett trade makes sense for Eagles\n\nThe Eagles have been connected to Garrett multiple times this offseason, including a report from The Athletic that said it would be \"this year's version\" of the Saquon Barkley move as the Birds try to load up for another Super Bowl run.\n\nNot only would it be a Barkley-esque move in terms of the impact it could have on Philadelphia's young defense, but the addition of Garrett also would make sense from a philosophical roster-building standpoint for the Eagles.\n\nIt's no secret Howie Roseman builds through the trenches. After the Eagles drafted Jalen Hurts, Roseman coined the phrase \"QB factory,\" but the team might actually be an \"offensive and defensive line factory.\"\n\nSince becoming the general manager in 2010, Roseman has drafted 10 offensive or defensive linemen in the first round, including recent first-rounders Jalen Carter and Nolan Smith in 2023.\n\nAdding Garrett to a line featuring Carter and Smith would be daunting for opposing teams.\n\nGarrett is coming off a season where he recorded 14 sacks, 22 tackles for loss and 28 quarterback hits in 17 games. He's had at least 10 sacks or more in seven straight seasons and has the second most sacks since he entered the league in 2017 with 102.5, only trailing T.J. Watt of the Pittsburgh Steelers.\n\nMyles Garrett #95 of the Cleveland Browns takes the field before playing the game against the Miami Dolphins at Huntington Bank Field on Dec. 29, 2024 in Cleveland, Ohio. Jason Miller / Getty Images\n\nHowie Roseman notorious for making big trades\n\nRoseman can never be ruled out from making a blockbuster trade, especially if it involves landing a blue-chip player like Garrett in a premium position.\n\nA trade for Garrett would likely include one or two first-round picks and additional assets. As general manager, Roseman made several big moves in March and April before or during the NFL draft.\n\nOn draft night in 2022, the Eagles acquired wide receiver A.J. Brown from the Tennessee Titans for first and third-round picks. The deal was a massive success, as Brown has played the best years of his career in Philly and won a Super Bowl as the team's No. 1 wide receiver.\n\nWhen Roseman was the vice president of player personnel for the Eagles in 2009, the team sent first and fourth-round picks to the Buffalo Bills for Jason Peters, who recently retired.\n\nEven beyond the deals that didn't include first-rounders, Roseman has made moves for impact players like Darius Slay, Timmy Jernigan and others who have helped them be successful over the last several seasons.\n\nRoseman also has a relationship with the Browns' general manager.\n\nAndrew Berry, the executive vice president of football operations and general manager in Cleveland, worked as the Eagles' vice president of football operations in 2019 before taking the job with the Browns in 2020.\n\nIn a 2020 interview, Berry said that he thinks Roseman is the best general manager in the NFL.\n\nBerry's twin brother, Adam Berry, currently works in Philadelphia's front office as the vice president of football operations and strategy.\n\nGarrett has two more years left on a five-year contract he signed with the team in 2020. According to Spotrac, the final two years of the contract have cap hits of $19.7 million and $20.3 million. The contract — and possible extension later on — could complicate things for an Eagles team that will have to pay its young defensive players in the future, but nothing should be ruled out with Roseman's track record.\n\nAndrew Berry told reporters at the NFL scouting combine he has no interest in dealing Garrett, but according to Cleveland.com, Garrett isn't open to signing an extension with the Browns.\n\nMyles Garrett fills need at edge rusher\n\nWith Sweat likely getting paid in free agency, adding Garrett would fill a void at edge rusher for the Birds.\n\nThe Eagles are also likely to lose defensive end Brandon Graham to retirement. Graham said the 2024 season, his 15th in Philly, would be his \"farewell tour,\" but nothing has been officially announced.\n\nPhiladelphia invested heavily into the edge rusher position last offseason by signing Bryce Huff to a three-year, $51.1 million contract. But Huff had an underwhelming year in 2024 and was a healthy scratch for the Super Bowl. The Eagles would likely prefer to trade Huff, but finding a team to take that contract will likely be tough.\n\nRookie edge rusher Jalyx Hunt will return for the 2025 season after an impressive Super Bowl performance where he had a half a sack, two total tackles and a quarterback hit.\n\nMyles Garrett's comments on Philadelphia Eagles\n\nBefore the Super Bowl, Garrett made an appearance on The Zach Gelb Show on Radio Row in New Orleans and called the possibility of coming to Philly a \"hell of a destination.\"\n\n\"I'm not going to stay too attached to any one team at this point,\" Garrett said on the The Zach Gelb Show. \"I know my fate really isn't in my hands, but it would be a hell of a destination.\"\n\nWhen Garrett requested a trade in February, he said he wanted to go to a contender with a chance to compete for a Super Bowl — and the Eagles' championship window is wide open with a young core in place.\n\nIn Garrett's eight years in Cleveland, the Browns have only made the playoffs twice and played a total of three postseason games.\n\nThe Browns finished 3-14 last season, which was good for last in the AFC North.",

A Southwest jet came in for a landing, but the pilot quickly aborted to avoid a potential collision with a business jet that was taxiing on the runway.\n\nThis comes after a deadly collision between an American Airlines passenger jet and an Army helicopter near Washington, D.C. on January 29. Two days later, a medical plane crashed in northeast Philadelphia, killing seven people.\n\nPeople at Wawa on Chichester Avenue in Upper Chichester said their confidence in air travel is beginning to waver.\n\n\"I don't like flying,\" Robert Sowers from Wilmington said. \"I'd rather sail.\"\n\nWhen asked for her thoughts about flying, Mildred Parker from Darby Township said, \"I wouldn't dare with all the crashes and the deaths. I wouldn't even risk my life.\"\n\nAccording to an AP-NORC survey, in January 2024, 71% of people thought air travel was safe. But in February 2025, only 64% of people thought air travel was safe.\n\nThe National Transportation Safety Board has recorded over 1,000 aviation incidents yearly over the last decade. But most people CBS News Philadelphia talked to at the Philadelphia International Airport on Wednesday said they felt confident flying.\n\n\"For the large aircraft, studies still show it's the safest way to travel, especially for the distances I fly,\" John Carter from Fort Collins, Colorado, said.\n\nFederal data shows plane crashes are extremely rare. According to the NTSB, in January 2025, there were 62 accidents involving a plane nationwide, most of them on private flights. That's a record low.\n\n\"I think the odds are definitely on our side when we get on a plane,\" Steve Yannone from Walnut Creek, California, said.\n\nFor those feeling nervous about flying, therapy dogs are easing anxiety at Philadelphia International Airport. They are part of the Wagging Tails Brigade.\n\n\"Our certified therapy dogs are there to just soothe and comfort and make sure everyone in the airport is happy,\" Leah Douglas, director of guest experience at Philadelphia International Airport, said.\n\nPHL has a quiet room where passengers can relax. There's also a program called Wingmate, where people who aren't flying can apply at least a day in advance to sit with their family members or friends at the gate.\n\nAccording to experts, there are things you can do to cope with anxiety over flying. First, focus on the data: The odds of being killed in an air accident is about one in 13.7 million. That's far lower than the odds of being killed in a car crash, which is estimated at one in 95.\n\nAnother tip is to avoid triggering content by limiting exposure to upsetting flight incidents.\n\nTo prepare for your flight, give yourself enough time to avoid rushing and minimize anxiety. Avoid caffeine and alcohol to reduce anxiety before flying. Traveling with a friend can also help.",

        "content": "New Jersey health officials share measles alert New Jersey health officials share measles alert 02:41\n\nA measles alert was issued by the New Jersey Department of Health after three cases of the highly-contagious virus were confirmed in Bergen County.\n\nAn unvaccinated New Jersey resident was diagnosed with measles after returning from an international trip and spread it to two close contacts, who also were not immunized, officials said.\n\nThe alert on Feb. 27 came one day after Texas confirmed a child died from measles amid an outbreak that has infected more than 120 people in the Lone Star State, while cases have been popping up in several U.S. states.\n\nNew Jersey's DOH said people who visited Englewood Hospital's emergency department between 11:30 a.m. and 5:30 p.m. on Feb. 9 were at risk of exposure. Symptoms could appear as late as March 6, the health department said.\n\nNJDOH was working on contact tracing to notify people who might have been exposed, but said anyone who was at the hospital during that time should contact their health care provider immediately.\n\nAnyone who suspects they are infected should call their doctor first before going to a facility so precautions can be taken to protect other patients and staff, NJDOH said.\n\nMeasles vaccine \"could protect a child from dying\"\n\nIn response to the Texas measles outbreak and cases in the Garden State, the New Jersey health department is urging residents to get the MMR vaccine for measles, mumps and rubella.\n\n\"A simple thing like this could protect a child from dying,\" said Dr. Suhaib Nashi, a pediatrician who administers the MMR vaccine almost daily. \"Any contagious illness, people should be concerned.\"\n\nNashi, with Advocare Morristown Pediatrics, has also worked in third-world countries where the MMR vaccine is not regularly available.\n\n\"I know what measles can do. It's one of the really bad illnesses,\" he said.\n\nAccording to the CDC, more than 93% of New Jersey kindergarteners had received the MMR vaccine for the 2023-24 school year, but that's down from just over 94% in 2022. More than 97% were vaccinated in New York and Connecticut both years.\n\nVaccination rates in kindergarteners across the U.S. fell about 2.5% from 2020 to 2024, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says.\n\nHow does measles spread?\n\nMeasles spreads easily through the air when an infected person coughs or sneezes and can be in the air for up to two hours after they leave, NJDOH said. Symptoms include high fever, cough, runny nose, watery red eyes and a rash that usually appears between three and five days after symptoms begin.\n\n\"The rash usually begins as flat red spots that appear on the face at the hairline and spread downward to the neck, torso, arms, legs, and feet,\" the health department's alert said.\n\nPeople at risk of becoming infected include those who are not fully vaccinated or have not had measles before, the CDC says.\n\nThe CDC defines an outbreak as three or more related cases, NJDOH said, but doctors say additional cases are not automatically cause for panic.\n\n\"The concern is if there's a pocket of unvaccinated people because this virus is very good at finding people who are not vaccinated,\" said Dr. Robert Amler, a dean and professor of public health at New York Medical College.\n\n\"A little over 20 years ago, this was declared eradicated from the continental United States. However, we do still see sporadic cases in travelers who bring it back,\" said Dr. Joseph Kim, chief medical officer for ID Care, which provides infectious disease services throughout New Jersey. \"One person in an unvaccinated community can infect 12 to 18 people.\"\n\nKim says measles is highly contagious, but \"exceptionally preventable.\"\n\nIf you think you were exposed to measles, doctors say you should check your medical records to see if you were vaccinated. If you're unsure, booster shots are available.\n\ncontributed to this report.",

Students and staff who were in Mifflin Hall between Feb. 17 and Feb. 24 or in the Thomas Building on Feb. 20 between 1 p.m. and 3 p.m. may have been exposed.\n\nChickenpox is a highly contagious disease with itchy blisters that spread over the entire body. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says someone with chickenpox may have as many as 500 blisters. The disease is spread through airborne particles and direct contact with an infected person.\n\nThe risk of infection is low for people who have received both doses of the vaccine. The university is encouraging people to check their immunization records to see if they've been vaccinated. It's also rare for someone who has already had chickenpox to get it again.\n\nOn top of checking vaccination records, Penn State encourages people to avoid contact with others who are sick or have a blister-like rash and to wash their hands frequently.\n\nThe CDC says some people who get chickenpox, like those with weakened immune systems, may have more severe symptoms and may be at higher risk for complications.",

Little did she know that her day would take an extraordinary turn.\n\nPeto, who was nearing her due date with her third child, began to feel off as the morning went on.\n\n\"It really wasn't until 11:15 [a.m.] that I was like, something is really not right here,\" she recalled.\n\nIt wasn't long before someone noticed that she didn't look well and immediately called for the school nurse.

She could tell the baby was coming, and there was no time to waste.\n\n\"When she brought the wheelchair, she took me back and I just figured I'd be waiting for someone to come pick me and she recognized right away that you can't wait,\" Peto said.\n\nCBS News Philadelphia\n\nFrisco was ready to act. Her years of medical experience had prepared her for moments like this.\n\n\"I've never delivered a baby before, I just have experience in a lot of the fields,\" Frisco said.\n\nJust 10 minutes after getting Peto to the nurse's office, baby Cora was born, weighing in at 5 pounds, 4 ounces.\n\n\"The baby came out, and you know, I suctioned the mouth, and she started crying. It was the most beautiful cry I've ever heard,\" Frisco recalled.\n\n\"I'm just so happy that she's okay because when I think of all the things that could have gone wrong, she really was an angel, truly. We're beyond thankful,\" Peto shared, her voice filled with emotion.\n\nFor Frisco, the experience was not only an extraordinary moment in her career but also a personal story that would forever tie her to baby Cora.\n\n\"Gen definitely has a story to tell, and Cora will always have that story to tell for the rest of her life. I'm just happy I was able to be a part of it,\" Frisco said.\n\nCBS News Philadelphia",

It comes with everything,\" Ramirez said.\n\nFounded by Fran Wasserman in 2011 as just small stacks of donations to serve underserved communities and at-risk babies, now the organization has grown to fill multiple rooms with goods to last a child up to a year.\n\nMost of their bundles are distributed through social workers, local organizations, and churches like Willow Grove Baptist Church, where Ramirez met food pantry director Rick Beyerle.\n\nKelly works part time as a waitress and takes care of her five children and two that she adopted. She would visit the pantry Beyerle oversees.\n\n\"Since we started it's been pretty much 50 families a year,\" Beyerle said.\n\nThat's 50 more families every year, and with inflation going up, so is the number of people in need.\n\nRamirez, a busy mother, said she's grateful for the help of the church and The Baby Bureau, where their bundles aren't charity, they're gifts.\n\n\"If you are scared, if you are embarrassed, you don't want to ask for help, you can,\" Ramirez said.\n\nTo donate gently used baby clothes, you can visit The Baby Bureau.",

There has been a decline in cancer deaths for Black people, but new research from the American Cancer Society shows there continues to be a big gap in survival rates.\n\nJames Waddington is a prostate cancer survivor on a mission.\n\nStahl: \"What's your message to the Black community, now?\"\n\nWaddington: \"Screening is important.\"\n\nHe was diagnosed nearly five years ago at age 50 after his doctor recommended a PSA blood test that helped catch his prostate cancer early.\n\n\"I said, 'If I survive the surgery, I will do everything I can to make people more aware of the importance of early detection,'\" Waddington said.\n\nA new report from the American Cancer Society shows while cancer death rates among Black people are declining, they remain higher than those for other racial and ethnic groups.\n\n\"We're excited by the improvements. But despite that, Black men are significantly more likely to die from the disease, and Black women who have a less chance of developing cancer are more likely to die from it,\" said Dr. William Dahut, the chief scientific officer at the American Cancer Society.\n\nThe report finds Black patients compared to White patients have a two-fold higher risk of death for myeloma, prostate, uterine (endometrial), and stomach cancers, and 40% to 50% higher for colorectal, breast, cervical and liver cancers.\n\n\"In prostate cancer, Black men are about 67% more likely to be diagnosed and about two times more likely to die,\" Dahut said. \"There's probably a different inherited risk in Black men than white men. Based on our research, Black men are often not offered the same treatment options as white men.\"\n\nWaddington shares his story to raise awareness about the disparities.\n\n\"Part of this work I do with the American Cancer Society is I tell people I wanna be around for grandkids,\" Waddington said. \"I push myself to stay on top of my health. This is what I want my legacy to be, granddad did something to help, you know, the community overcome cancer.\"\n\nWork, he hopes, will save more lives.\n\nThe cancer society says men should be getting PSA blood tests starting at age 50 – earlier if they're in a high risk group.",

        "source": "https://www.cbsnews.com/philadelphia/",
        "content": "The Philadelphia Eagles got things going with their offseason with the release of longtime cornerback Darius Slay, starting the restructuring of the NFL's No. 1 defense. Slay will be 35 next January and was designated as a post-June 1 cut. The Eagles will save $4.3 million against the 2025 salary cap and $17.8 million for 2026.\n\nSlay is coming off one of his best seasons, as opposing quarterbacks targeting him completed just 47.1% of their passes. While Slay didn't have an interception, he allowed just a 63.6 passer rating as the primary defender in coverage and 5.5 yards per pass attempt. He also had 13 pass breakups and allowed just two touchdowns.\n\nIn the playoffs, Slay allowed a 70.1 passer rating and an interception with four pass breakups. He had career-bests in completion rate (47.1%), yards allowed (371), yards per attempt (5.5), 20+ yard completions (3), first downs allowed (15), and pass-breakup rate (19.1%).\n\nWith Slay released, what is the Eagles' plan at cornerback going forward? Is there a possibility Slay could return for his final NFL season?\n\nCooper DeJean moving to the outside\n\nThe Eagles would likely keep Cooper DeJean in the slot, where he didn't allow a touchdown in coverage last season. That would be in nickel personnel, as DeJean would move to the outside in base defense. This would be an expanded role for DeJean, but it was what the Eagles envisioned when they traded up in the second round last year to acquire him.\n\nCooper DeJean of the Philadelphia Eagles celebrates during the Philadelphia Eagles Super Bowl Championship Parade on February 14, 2025, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Mitchell Leff/Getty Images\n\nReleasing Slay paves the way for DeJean to move to outside cornerback in a base defense, keeping the second-year cornerback on the field at all times.\n\nDecision on Isaiah Rodgers\n\nThe Eagles would have to make a call on whether to bring Isaiah Rodgers back or not, as he is set to hit free agency next week. Rodgers would get a crack at the outside cornerback job when DeJean goes back into the slot (nickel), as opposing quarterbacks targeting Rodgers as the primary defender completed just 46.4% of their passes (Rodgers had a 77.1 passer rating allowed in coverage).\n\nIsaiah Rodgers of the Philadelphia Eagles celebrates in the snow following the NFC Divisional playoff game against the Los Angeles Rams at Lincoln Financial Field on January 19, 2025, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The Eagles defeated the Rams 28-22. Kara Durrette/Getty Images\n\nBringing Rodgers back is an option, as he would compete with 2023 fourth-round pick Kelee Ringo for that outside cornerback spot. A special teams ace, Ringo is due for an expanded role on defense. He has allowed just a 46.3 passer rating as the primary defender in coverage over the last two seasons (170 snaps).\n\nCould Slay return?\n\nWith his previous contract off the books, the Eagles could bring Slay back at a reduced rate. Bringing him back to Philadelphia is an option, though he would have to take a significant pay cut to return.\n\nIf Slay finds his way back to Philadelphia for a reduced rate for a second time, he'll start opposite Quinyon Mitchell for a second time, and DeJean will remain primarily in the slot. Slay playing his final year with the Eagles is paramount, as he was a veteran mentor for Mitchell and DeJean — and vital toward their immediate success.\n\nDarius Slay Jr., Quinyon Mitchell and Cooper DeJean of the Philadelphia Eagles talk on the sidelines against the Jacksonville Jaguars at Lincoln Financial Field on November 3, 2024, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Mitchell Leff/Getty Images\n\nThe Eagles are restructuring enough of their defense in 2025. They don't need to move on from Slay if they don't have to, even though he'll have options to play elsewhere in his final season.",
