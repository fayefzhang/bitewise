        "source": "https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/",
        "content": "At 35, Katie Dutton is already a rectal cancer survivor, an ordeal that started with seemingly benign symptoms doctors initially dismissed.\n\nShe was told to change her diet and was treated for hemorrhoids before a colonoscopy finally revealed a mass at the end of her digestive system.\n\n“It was shocking — it was just pure shock,” Dutton, a nurse who lives in Tacoma, Washington, tells TODAY.com about her diagnosis.\n\n“I had no risk factors.”\n\nGet top local stories in Philly delivered to you every morning. Sign up for NBC Philadelphia's News Headlines newsletter.\n\nIn May 2022, Dutton suddenly started experiencing constipation. She’d never had that issue before, but while on vacation in Las Vegas, she noticed she didn’t have a bowel movement for a week.\n\nIn December of that year, she saw a big gush of bright red blood after a bowel movement and then consistent bleeding almost every time she went to the bathroom.\n\nWhen Dutton mentioned those warning signs to her doctor, she was told it was probably hemorrhoids that were acting up because of the constipation. The physician’s advice was to eat more fiber.\n\n“When I started having symptoms, (colorectal cancer) was sort of on my radar, but still I was like, ‘Nah, probably not,’” she recalls.\n\n“Bright red blood in the stool can be caused by hemorrhoids so I kind of took them at their word on that. I thought it was hemorrhoids.”\n\nIn June 2023, Dutton went to a new primary care doctor who referred her to a gastroenterologist. A colonoscopy revealed a large polyp in her rectum that finally set her diagnosis in motion.\n\nKatie Dutton was diagnosed with rectal cancer at 33. (Courtesy Katie Dutton)\n\nColorectal cancer symptoms\n\nRectal cancer starts in the rectum, the last six inches of the digestive system where stool is stored until it passes through the anus, according to the American Cancer Society.\n\nIt accounts for about 30% of new colorectal cancer cases in the U.S.\n\nDoctors are seeing the disease more and more in younger people for unknown reasons, says Dr. Laila Rashidi, a colorectal surgeon at MultiCare in Tacoma, Washington, who treated Dutton. Half of Rashidi’s patients are under 50, she notes.\n\nDutton has no family history of colorectal cancer or any other risk factors like eating lots of red and processed meat, smoking or leading a sedentary lifestyle, Rashidi points out.\n\n“Katie did not have any of those. So that tells you it can happen to anybody, and we still don’t know why,” Rashidi tells TODAY.com.\n\n“She’s healthy. She’s young. She’s active. She eats well. She exercised every day, she’s in health care. She’s the perfect example of someone that you would never think of.”\n\nDutton was active and healthy. She ran a 12k in June 2022, right after her symptoms started. (Courtesy Katie Dutton)\n\nConstipation is one of the warning signs because if the tumor gets large, stool can’t pass easily, Rashidi says. Sometimes, just the liquid portion of waste can pass around the tumor, so some patients report what they think is diarrhea, she adds.\n\nRectal bleeding is the \"red flag symptom” to be concerned about, Dr. Daniel Chung, a gastroenterologist at Massachusetts General Hospital, previously told TODAY.com. He’s not involved in this case.\n\nIf the blood is darker in color, it's had time to get oxidized so it’s usually coming from higher up in the colon, Rashidi says. If it’s bright red, that means the bleeding is happening low in the rectum, which could be hemorrhoids or cancer, she adds. The bleeding can be painless, so always look at your stool and watch for blood mixed with it, Rashidi advises.\n\n“Listen to your body. If something is different, don’t take it lightly, especially with bowel function, blood or just bloating,” she says.\n\nChanges in bowel habits, unexplained weight loss, anemia, abdominal pain, narrow stools and an unproductive urge to have a bowel movement are also colorectal cancer symptoms.\n\n'Rule out cancer first. The stakes are too high'\n\nWhen Dutton’s polyp was biopsied, it came back as precancerous. But doctors were suspicious and kept testing because of an enlarged lymph node near her rectal area.\n\nDutton officially found out she had Stage 3B rectal cancer on Black Friday in November 2023. She was just 33 years old.\n\n“Part of me was relieved because I think the waiting and the not knowing is the hardest part of cancer,” she says.\n\n“Part of me was shocked, and then part of me was just ready to hunker down and do something.”\n\nDutton in the hospital with her partner, Drew Thompson. (Courtesy Katie Dutton)\n\nShe underwent four months of chemotherapy, but was relieved she didn’t need radiation to her pelvis, which would have left her unable to have children.\n\nIn May 2024, Dutton underwent surgery to remove all traces of the mass and most of her rectum. Rashidi then connected the healthy parts of her digestive system back together.\n\nThe nurse had two more months of chemotherapy and is now being monitored with imaging every three months and lab work, including a lab test to check for circulating tumor DNA.\n\nDutton urges others to be aware of the symptoms and advocate for themselves.\n\n“If I could do it again, I would have been a lot more aggressive with asking for a colonoscopy much earlier. But even me, it wasn’t on my radar. I was like, ‘I’m probably fine. I’m so young.’ But that’s not the case anymore,” she says.\n\n“Rule out cancer first. The stakes are too high.”\n\nThis story first appeared on TODAY.com. More from TODAY:",

        "content": "The Eagles on Monday agreed to terms with veteran right tackle Lane Johnson on a one-year contract extension that will keep him in Philly through the 2027 season.\n\nThis extension also comes with a raise for Johnson. The reworked deal will add $8 million over the next two years and an addition $30 million in guarantees, ESPN’s Adam Schefter reported.\n\nJohnson, who will turn 35 in May, enters Year 13 of his NFL career in 2025 and is still playing at an extremely high level. Johnson made his sixth Pro Bowl in 2024 and had a strong case to be first-team All-Pro.\n\nBefore Super Bowl LIX, Johnson made it clear that he had no plans to retire.\n\nGet top local stories in Philly delivered to you every morning. Sign up for NBC Philadelphia's News Headlines newsletter.\n\n“I’m definitely not retiring after this game, win or lose,” Johnson said in the lead-up to Super Bowl LIX. “I’m definitely playing next year. It’s really how you take it when you get up in age. You take it one year at a time.\n\n“Physically, man, I feel a lot better than I have in the past couple of years. I feel really good. For being this late in the year, it’s not usually like that. I’m thankful and we got a good team here to help us out with all that.”\n\nIf Johnson plays out the remaining three years on his contract, he would be 37 years old at the end of the 2027 season. Brandon Graham is the only player in franchise history to play 15 seasons with the Eagles and this extension gives Johnson a chance to become the second.\n\nThe Eagles have done a good job of locking up their talent, especially on offense, long-term. In addition to Johnson, the Eagles also have Jalen Hurts, A.J. Brown, Jordan Mailata, DeVonta Smith, Saquon Barkley and Landon Dickerson under contract through at least the 2027 season. Earlier this offseason, the Eagles also gave Barkley an extension.\n\nThe Eagles used the No. 4 overall pick on Johnson back in 2013 and he has now been a six-time Pro Bowler, a four-time first- or second-team All-Pro and a two-time Super Bowl champion. With three years left under contract, Johnson has the opportunity to solidify his Hall of Fame resume in the coming years.\n\nSubscribe to Eagle Eye anywhere you get your podcasts:\n\nApple Podcasts | YouTube Music | Spotify | Stitcher | Simplecast | RSS | Watch on YouTube",

        "title": "2025 Eagles mock draft roundup 4.0: What changed after flurry of free agency?",
        "source": "https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/",
        "content": "NFL free agency isn’t over but the craziness of the first week of it is out of the way.\n\nThe Eagles were pretty quiet last week and they actually lost some key players like Milton Williams, Josh Sweat and Mekhi Becton. They also traded away veteran safety C.J. Gardner-Johnson.\n\nHow will that change mock drafts? Let’s take a look at some updated options at No. 32:\n\nJohn Kosko, PFF\n\nGet top local stories in Philly delivered to you every morning. Sign up for NBC Philadelphia's News Headlines newsletter.\n\n32. Xavier Watts, S, Notre Dame\n\nWhat they said: “After trading C.J. Gardner-Johnson this offseason, the Eagles need to fill that safety spot. They do so here with a player who possesses the draft class' best ball skills among safeties. Watts struggled to consistently finish tackles in college, but his anticipation in coverage and knack for finding the ball are unquestionable.”\n\nMy take on the pick: The Eagles have never drafted a safety in the first round but that doesn’t mean they won’t this year. And having the No. 32 pick in the draft is a lot different than picking in the top half of the round. After the CJGJ trade, the Eagles will still start Reed Blankenship at one of those safety spots in 2025 but the other is open for Sydney Brown, or a veteran or rookie to be named later. The top safety in the draft is Malaki Starks from Georgia and he’s going to be a name a lot of people get excited about. The other two potential first-round safeties are Watts from Notre Dame and Nick Emmanwori from South Carolina. It’s notable that in this mock draft, Starks was long gone by the Eagles pick but they could have had Emmanwori and instead took Watts.\n\nRyan Fowler, The Draft Network\n\n32. Kenneth Grant, DT, Michigan\n\nWhat they said: “There’s still some fine-tuning needed in Kenneth Grant's game (tightness in lower half tightness, first-step quickness), but the Michigan product is a disruptive and uber-athletic player who remains among the top interior ballplayers in the class. With Milton Williams now out in Philadelphia, Grant could become a highly disruptive force within a defensive line that has talent around him. That fits the script here with the likes of Jalen Carter, Nolan Smith, Jordan Davis, and second-year man Jalyx Hunt all in place.”\n\nMy take on the pick: It was pretty obvious before free agency began that Milton Williams was going to leave for a big contract elsewhere and, sure enough, he got a four-year, $104 million deal with the Patriots. The top defensive tackles left on the roster to pair with Jalen Carter are Jordan Davis and Moro Ojomo. The Eagles have to like what they saw in Ojomo last season but this is a position where it would make sense to look toward the draft early. And by most accounts, this is a good and deep class of defensive tackles. Grant is huge at 6-4, 331 pounds and is more of a nose tackle. It wouldn’t be a perfect 1-for-1 swap-out with Milton Williams who was on the smaller side and had a ton of pass rush skill. But Grant is really athletic for his size and had 3 sacks and 6 1/2 TFLs in 2024.\n\nJames Foster, The 33rd Team\n\n32. Walter Nolen, DT, Ole Miss\n\nWhat they said: “The Eagles take Walter Nolen to replace Milton Williams, who signed a massive deal with New England. Nolen is an athletic and disruptive wrecking ball on the interior who lives in the backfield. The #2 recruit in the 2022 class, Nolen showed substantial growth as a pass rusher this year.”\n\nMy take on the pick: Of these two defensive tackles, Nolen (6-4, 296) is more of a penetrating option who can get upfield and be disruptive in a hurry. If the Eagles are looking for a player who can simply win 1-on-1s as a pass rusher when Carter gets double-teamed, then Nolen would probably be a good fit.\n\nKyle Stackpole, CBS Sports\n\n32. Grey Zabel, OL, North Dakota State\n\nWhat they said: “General Manager Howie Roseman loves adding to the trenches, and Grey Zabel has played a bunch of different offensive line positions in his career (mostly left tackle at North Dakota State before moving inside during his breakout Senior Bowl performance). He can serve as the replacement for Mekhi Becton, who is now a free agent.”\n\nMy take on the pick: During his college career, Zabel played a bunch of different spots but it seems like many people see him as a guard at the NFL level. While Zabel is 6-6, 312 pounds, he has 32-inch arms and could lack the length to play at tackle in the NFL. He played four different positions on the O-line at NDSU. After losing Becton in free agency, the Eagles’ top incumbent to replace him is Tyler Steen. Adding a Day 1 or Day 2 player to compete with Steen seems like a solid move. And perhaps getting a player who could one day replace Lane Johnson at right tackle would track too.\n\nNate Tice and Charles McDonald, Yahoo! Sports\n\n32. Marcus Mbow, OL, Purdue\n\nWhat they said: “Eagles. Trenches. Mbow has a chance to stay out at right tackle (and be a Lane Johnson successor) or could bump inside to right guard if the Eagles move on from Mekhi Becton. Either way, it’s more big man depth that the Eagles love.”\n\nMy take on the pick: This would be another option to draft Johnson’s eventual replacement at right tackle and then see if Mbow could play inside in the interim. Sort of like how the Eagles drafted Cam Jurgens to eventually replace Jason Kelce but got a year out of him at right guard during the wait. Mbow (6-4, 303) also has 32-inch arms, which can be somewhat limiting, depending on the evaluator. Mbow played both right tackle and right guard in college.\n\nDavid Helman, FOX Sports\n\n32. James Pearce, Edge, Tennessee\n\nWhat they said: “Pearce is one of this draft's most talented pass-rushers, but he's been followed by that mysterious and alarming phrase: \"character concerns.\" NFL teams tend to know a lot more about this type of stuff than we do, but I'm confident the Eagles have the culture that can handle just about anything. It would be so typical to watch a talented edge rusher fall to Howie Roseman at the very end of the first round.”\n\nMy take on the pick: It seems like during this round of mock drafts, some other positions popped up but edge rusher is always going to be one to go back to. The Eagles lost Josh Sweat in free agency and that leaves them with Nolan Smith, Jalyx Hunt and Bryce Huff as they await to hear about Brandon Graham’s retirement decision. Pearce (6-5, 245) is a long and explosive edge rusher who ran a 4.47 at the Combine. There are a few different options who might be there at edge rusher for the Eagles at 32 and Pearce is an intriguing one. He was a productive college player who profiles well. As far as “character concerns,” the Eagles always do their homework on players. But the sentiment that the Eagles have a strong locker room is true, although there is a bit of a changing of the guard in terms of leadership on defense.\n\nSubscribe to Eagle Eye anywhere you get your podcasts:\n\nApple Podcasts | YouTube Music | Spotify | Stitcher | Simplecast | RSS | Watch on YouTube",

        "source": "https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/",
        "content": "Shopping for a new home? Ready to renovate your kitchen or install a new deck? You'll be paying more to do so.\n\nThe Trump administration’s tariffs on imported goods from Canada, Mexico and China — some already in place, others set to take effect in a few weeks — are already driving up the cost of building materials used in new residential construction and home remodeling projects.\n\nThe tariffs are projected to raise the costs that go into building a single-family home in the U.S. by $7,500 to $10,000, according to the National Association of Home Builders. Such costs are typically passed along to the homebuyer in the form of higher prices, which could hurt demand at a time when the U.S. housing market remains in a slump and many builders are having to offer buyers costly incentives to drum up sales.\n\nWe Buy Houses in San Francisco, which purchases foreclosed homes and then typically renovates and sells them, is increasing prices on its refurbished properties between 7% and 12%. That's even after saving $52,000 in costs by stockpiling 62% more Canadian lumber than usual.\n\nGet top local stories in Philly delivered to you every morning. Sign up for NBC Philadelphia's News Headlines newsletter.\n\n“The uncertainty of how long these tariffs will continue has been the most challenging aspect of our planning,” said CEO Mamta Saini.\n\nBad timing for builders\n\nThe timing of the tariffs couldn’t be worse for homebuilders and the home remodeling industry, as this is typically the busiest time of year for home sales. The prospect of a trade war has roiled the stock market and stoked worries about the economy, which could lead many would-be homebuyers to remain on the sidelines.\n\n“Rising costs due to tariffs on imports will leave builders with few options,” said Danielle Hale, chief economist at Realtor.com. “They can choose to pass higher costs along to consumers, which will mean higher home prices, or try to use less of these materials, which will mean smaller homes.”\n\nPrices for building materials, including lumber, have been rising, even though the White House has delayed its tariffs rollout on some products. Lumber futures jumped to $658.71 per thousand board feet on March 4, reaching their highest level in more than two years.\n\nThe increase is already inflating costs for construction projects.\n\nDana Schnipper, a partner at building materials supplier JC Ryan in Farmingdale, New York, sourced wooden doors and frames for an apartment complex in Nassau County from a company in Canada that cost less than the American equivalent.\n\nHalf the job has already been supplied. But once the tariff goes into effect it will be applied to the remaining $75,000, adding $19,000 to the at-cost total. Once JC Ryan applies its mark up, that means the customer will owe $30,000 more than originally planned, Schnipper said.\n\nHe also expects the tariffs will give American manufacturers cover to raise prices on steel components.\n\n“These prices will never come down,” Schnipper said. “Whatever is going to happen, these things will be sticky and hopefully we’re good enough as a small business, that we can absorb some of that. We can’t certainly absorb all of it, so I don’t know. It’s going to be an interesting couple of months.”\n\nSidestepping the tariffs by using an alternative to imported building materials isn’t always an option.\n\nBar Zakheim, owner of Better Place Design & Build, a contracting business in San Diego that specializes in building accessible dwelling units, or ADUs, said Canada remains the best source for lumber.\n\nBy sticking with imported lumber, Zakheim had to raise his prices about 15% compared with a year ago. He also has 8% fewer jobs lined up compared with last year.\n\n“I’m not about to go out of business, but it’s looking to be a slow, expensive year for us,” he said.\n\nTariffs rollercoaster\n\nOn March 6, the Trump administration announced a one-month delay on its 25% tariffs on certain imports from Mexico and Canada, including softwood lumber. Tariffs of 20% on imports from China are already in effect. A 25% tariff on steel and aluminum imports — 50% on those from Canada — kicked in on March 12.\n\nTariffs on Mexican and Canadian goods slated to go into effect next month will raise the cost of imported construction materials by more than $3 billion, according to the NAHB. Those price hikes would be in addition to a 14.5% tariff on Canadian lumber previously imposed by the U.S., ratcheting up tariffs on Canadian lumber to 39.5%.\n\nOn Air Force One, President Donald Trump said he was pushing forward with his plans for tariffs on April 2 despite recent disruption in the stock market and nervousness about the economic impact.\n\n“April 2 is a liberating day for our country,” he said. “We’re getting back some of the wealth that very, very foolish presidents gave away because they had no clue what they were doing.”\n\nBuilding materials costs overall are already up 34% since December 2020, according to the NAHB.\n\nBuilders depend on raw materials, appliances and many other components produced abroad. About 7.3% of all products used in single-family home and apartment building construction are imported. Of those, nearly a quarter come from Canada and Mexico, according to the NAHB.\n\nBoth nations also account for 70% of the imports of two key home construction materials: lumber and gypsum. Canadian lumber is used in everything from framing to cabinetry and furniture. Mexican gypsum is used to make drywall.\n\nBeyond raw materials, refrigerators, washing machines, air conditioners and an array of other home components are manufactured in Mexico and China, which is also a key source of steel and aluminum.\n\nThe tariffs will mean higher prices for home improvement shoppers, said Dent Johnson, president of True Value Hardware, which operates more than 4,000 independently owned hardware stores.\n\n“The reality is that many products on the shelves of your local hardware store will eventually be affected,” he said in a statement emailed to The Associated Press.\n\nChilling effect\n\nConfusion over the timing and scope of the tariffs, and their impact on the economy, could have a bigger chilling effect on the new-home market than higher prices.\n\n“If consumers can’t plan, if builders can’t plan, it gets very difficult to know how to price product because you don’t know what price you need to move it,” said Carl Reichardt, a homebuilding analyst at BTIG. “If people are worried about their jobs, worried about the future, it’s very difficult to make the decision to buy a new home, whatever the price.”\n\nThe uncertainty created by the Trump administration’s tariffs policy will probably result in increased volatility for home sales and new home construction this year, said Robert Dietz, the NAHB's chief economist.\n\nStill, because it can take several months for a home to be built, the larger impact of from building materials costs are going to happen “down the road,” Dietz said.\n\nThe impact tariffs are having on consumers is already evident at Slutsky Lumber in Ellenville, N.Y.\n\n“There are not as many people getting ready for spring like they usually are,” said co-owner Jonathan Falcon. “It seems like people are just cutting back on spending.”\n\nFalcon also worries that smaller businesses like his will have a tough time absorbing the impact of the tariffs.\n\n“This is just like another thing that’s going to be harder for small lumber yards to handle than the big guys and just sort of keep driving businesses like us to not make it,” he said.\n\n-__\n\nReporter Anne D'Innocenzio contributed.",

        "source": "https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/",
        "content": "After just one season that resurrected his career, Mekhi Becton is leaving the Eagles in free agency on a two-year, $20 million deal with the Chargers.\n\nThe Eagles had a bunch of great individual stories on their Super Bowl-winning team in 2024 but Becton’s story was one of the best. The former Jets tackle was considered a first-round bust and was on the street until after the draft last offseason.\n\nBut with the Eagles, Becton became a starting right guard and played at a high level all year. After never being on a winning team the NFL, Becton was emotional as the Eagles hit every level of success this season.\n\nBecton, 25, is just the latest success story for legendary offensive line coach Jeff Stoutland, who got a special shout-out in Becton’s farewell message on social media Monday morning:\n\nGet top local stories in Philly delivered to you every morning. Sign up for NBC Philadelphia's News Headlines newsletter.\n\n“Coach Jeff Stoutland, thank you. From Day One, you believed in me, even before I fully believed in myself. You saw something in me, challenged me, and pushed me to reach a level I never knew I had. You made me a better player, but more importantly, a better man. What I’ll take away most is your mindset, your attention to detail, and the way you prepared every single day. You set the standard, and that will stick with me as I continue my career.”\n\nIn addition to the special shout-out for Stoutland, Becton also thanked his teammates for welcoming him, the organization for taking a chance on him and the fanbase for its passion.\n\nWhile Becton was with the Eagles just one year, he leaves a legacy as a Super Bowl champion.\n\nAs Becton moves on, the top incumbent candidate to replace him at right guard is former third-round pick Tyler Steen. Steen, 24, was expected to be the right guard in 2024 but suffered a minor ankle injury early in training camp, which opened the door for Becton, who never gave the job back. Steen handled the demotion well, though, and did a solid job of filling in when needed.\n\nThere’s a chance the Eagles could find a veteran or a rookie in the draft to compete with Steen for that right guard position in 2025. They got former first-round pick Kenyon Green last week from the Texans in a trade. Green should be in the mix as well.\n\nSubscribe to Eagle Eye anywhere you get your podcasts:\n\nApple Podcasts | YouTube Music | Spotify | Stitcher | Simplecast | RSS | Watch on YouTube",

        "source": "https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/",
        "content": "Over a double cheeseburger and fries, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. told Fox News host Sean Hannity earlier this month of his plans to improve the country’s health by incentivizing companies to step away from processed foods.\n\nFrom across the red high-top table of a Florida Steak ’n Shake, the health and human services secretary went on to praise the Indianapolis-based fast-food chain as a shining example of change since it began cooking its shoestring fries in beef tallow instead of one of the many seed oils that have become targets of Kennedy’s health agenda.\n\n“Steak ’n Shake has been great,” Kennedy said. “We’re very grateful to them for RFK'ing the french fries.”\n\nThe nationally televised praise marked the latest conservative endorsement for Steak ’n Shake, a 91-year-old company with 450 locations nationwide that has become one of the most high-profile businesses to support Kennedy’s “Make America Healthy Again” agenda — a move that has been boosted by Republican politicians and MAGA influencers including Rep. Anna Paulina Luna, Charlie Kirk, Laura Loomer, Kari Lake, Tony Shaffer and Benny Johnson.\n\nGet top local stories in Philly delivered to you every morning. Sign up for NBC Philadelphia's News Headlines newsletter.\n\n“I just had a cheeseburger and fries cooked in beef tallow today for lunch! Delicious!!” Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., wrote on X.\n\nAt a time when many companies might be looking to avoid politics, Steak ’n Shake is opting to publicly align itself with Kennedy and other high-profile conservatives. On social media, the brand has transformed its feed from the usual steam of burgers and shakes into a near nonstop stream of Trump-adjacent iconography: Elon Musk, Teslas, Fox News clips and even a red hat emblazoned with the words “Make Frying Oil Tallow Again,” a version of which is available for purchase on Kennedy’s MAHA merchandise website.\n\nWhat do you think of this hat? https://t.co/Vi1sPlzax2 pic.twitter.com/9qvFlG4gr3 — Steak 'n Shake (@SteaknShake) March 4, 2025\n\nThe company has not publicly embraced Trump or any of his policies but has been full-throated in its embrace of Kennedy.\n\n“We support MAHA,” Steak ’n Shake Chief Operations Officer Dan Edwards told NBC News last week. “Restaurant chains like ours would like to meet customer demand for better quality.”\n\nEdwards said support for the company is “across the political spectrum” and that “there is nothing political about great-tasting fries.” He did not answer specifically whether the company had any fears about alienating customers who do not support Kennedy’s MAHA agenda or Trump.\n\n“We are grateful to Secretary Kennedy for his leadership and for raising awareness about beef tallow,” he added.\n\nIt’s a bold move for a company that has weathered a rocky financial situation that forced the reported closure of 200 locations since 2018. While there is a wide array of relatively new and small brands that have sought to capitalize on the strength and passion of the MAGA movement, few, if any, established companies have shifted their public identity so quickly.\n\nPolitics aside, Steak ’n Shake’s choice to focus on seed oils comes with its own controversy.\n\nThe MAHA agenda, helmed by Kennedy, features several health-focused concerns of questionable veracity, including skepticism of the food and drug industry, fluoride in water and vaccines. Seed oils have also long been a target of unfounded theories about negative health impacts, some of which Kenney has touted, calling them “one of the most unhealthy ingredients we have in foods.”\n\nHealth experts have sought to counter those claims, noting that replacing seed oils with saturated fats offers little to no dietary benefit and can end up doing harm.\n\nMaya Vadiveloo, an associate professor at the University of Rhode Island who specializes in nutrition, said it is “well established that saturated fats are linked to an increased risk of heart disease, while vegetable oils, including oils from seeds, protect heart health.”\n\nEdwards said that while the burger brand supports Kennedy’s MAHA movement, Steak ’n Shake CEO Sardar Biglari, who acquired the company in 2008, has been trying to move to beef tallow for some time.\n\n“My boss asked, ‘Why should Europeans have better fries than Americans?’” Edwards said. “My boss said one day that we need to RFK the fries. So, a verb was invented.”\n\nAs for the company’s sudden shift on social media, Edwards said the posts “sometimes are aspirational,” noting that “sometimes we refer to space or Mars.”\n\n“NASA and Musk/SpaceX are the only two viable players in the area. We have referred to both,” Edwards said. “Regardless of politics, we admire Musk’s accomplishments.”\n\nIn February, Tesla wrote on X that it had signed a deal to build charging stations at several Steak ’n Shake locations after the fast food joint responded to Musk’s compliment on its fries. Edwards said discussions with Tesla and Steak ’n Shake started more than 18 months ago.\n\nSteak ’n Shake’s shift hasn’t been entirely smooth. The Bulwark reported that the chain’s move inspired some in the MAHA world to look deeper at the company’s food practices, finding that its fries were precooked in seed oils. The company later acknowledged on its website that some of its foods arrived at locations prefried, and that the initial frying had been in seed oils.\n\nHowever, Edwards said, because Kennedy has advocated for the removal of seed oils “completely,” the company is making a commitment to do so. And while he did not provide details as to how Hannity’s interview with Kennedy came about, he did say that when the Fox News host “calls, we answer.”\n\n“Sean Hannity is the best. He knows the restaurant business,” he said. “We are honored Sean Hannity and Secretary Kennedy visited Steak ’n Shake.”\n\nThis story first appeared on NBCNews.com. More from NBC News:",

        "content": "TOKYO — For a moment, it felt like all of Japan held its collective breath. The Tokyo Dome, known throughout the globe for its energy and electric atmosphere, fell silent as the sheeted dead. Then, as Shohei Ohtani’s bat connected on a curveball, the crowd erupted.\n\nShohei Ohtani, an international megastar playing on his home soil for the first time as a major leaguer, delivered the hit that jolted the Los Angeles Dodgers to life, setting the stage for the team’s thrilling 4-1 comeback over the Chicago Cubs in the opening game of the 2025 MLB season.\n\nThe journey to Opening Day was nearly a year in the making as both teams traveled over 6,000 miles for this moment. None of the other 28 teams in Major League Baseball had to travel across the world to play two games before heading all the way back across the Pacific Ocean for more exhibition games.\n\nNo one else had to arrive a week early to spring training, break camp early, disrupt their lives and routines for a couple of games on the other side of the world. But nobody else is Shohei Ohtani and the reigning World Series champion Los Angeles Dodgers.\n\nGet top local stories in Philly delivered to you every morning. Sign up for NBC Philadelphia's News Headlines newsletter.\n\nIn front of a packed house, in a city that is buzzing with baseball fever, two historic franchises clashed under the Tokyo lights. The 2025 MLB Tokyo Series was a celebration of Japanese baseball at its finest. Five Japanese-born players were on the active rosters and will play in the series.\n\nEven though this was a series between two of baseball’s iconic franchises, it was still the Shohei Ohtani show.\n\nOhtani is more than just famous in his home country. He’s an A-list celebrity, a rock star and a cultural icon all rolled into one. During the two-game series, over a dozen different commercials featuring Ohtani flashed across TV screens in Tokyo. His face is featured on billboards, taxi cabs, subway trains, storefront windows and more.\n\nEach and every time Ohtani stepped to the plate, fans roared and cheered. They all took out their phones to record his every movement and held their collective breath during each pitch. They oohed and aahed at every ball he put into play and gasped when he struck out.\n\nSo, after the flags were unfurled and the national anthems, played by Japanese musician Yoshiki, were completed, after the Pokemon introductions and the plethora of Pikachu’s danced across the diamond, there was finally baseball being played in 2025.\n\nFor the first time since the Dodgers defeated the Yankees in Game 5 of the 2024 World Series at Yankee Stadium on Oct. 30, the games actually counted, and LA’s title defense has officially begun.\n\nOhtani finished the game 2-for-5 with a single, a double and two runs scored. His first hit of the 2025 season, a line drive to right field, came in the top of the fifth inning.\n\nShohei Ohtani provides the first hit for the @Dodgers in 2025 💪 #TokyoSeries pic.twitter.com/BFz50E5EeI — MLB (@MLB) March 18, 2025\n\nTommy Edman tied the game with a line drive to left field, and Ohtani scored the go-ahead run on an errant throw by Cubs second baseman Jon Berti.\n\nTeoscar Hernandez added an insurance run in the top of the ninth.\n\nThat would be all the Dodgers would need as their pitching staff did the rest. Anthony Banda, Ben Casparius, Blake Treinen, and free agent acquisition Tanner Scott combined for four shutout innings with the latter earning his first save in Dodger blue.\n\nDodgers' starting pitcher Yoshinobu Yamamoto knows what it's like to travel across the world to pitch in a baseball game. He's no longer a rookie with the weight of the world on his shoulders. After a dominant postseason in which he was the ace of the Dodgers injury riddled World Series-winning pitching staff, Yamamoto has emerged as the ace of this year's staff.\n\nYamamoto’s three-pitch mix of fastball, curveball and splitter kept the Cubs hitters off-balance all night long. His only blemish was an RBI double to Miguel Amaya in the bottom of the second.\n\nMiguel Amaya drives home Dansby Swanson to get the scoring started in Tokyo! pic.twitter.com/zbCOpSJ0TC — MLB (@MLB) March 18, 2025\n\nIn a polar opposite performance from his first start of the 2024 season, Yamamoto allowed just one run on three hits with four strikeouts in five innings. He seized the opportunity in his home country and earned the win over his fellow countryman Shota Imanaga in the first all-Japanese Opening Day starting pitching matchup in MLB history.\n\nBoth teams will play again tomorrow, but the memories of this game will last a lifetime, and for the 42,635 fans in attendance at Tokyo Dome, they will remember it for years to come.",

        "source": "https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/",
        "content": "Universal Music Group filed a motion to dismiss Drake’s defamation lawsuit against it, arguing that the Canadian rapper’s claims are “no more than Drake’s attempt to save face for his unsuccessful rap battle” with Kendrick Lamar.\n\nDrake “lost a rap battle that he provoked and in which he willingly participated,” UMG stated in a court filing Monday. “Instead of accepting the loss like the unbothered rap artist he often claims to be, he has sued his own record label in a misguided attempt to salve his wounds.”\n\nBoth Drake and Lamar are signed to UMG, under different divisions. (UMG has no relationship to NBCUniversal, the parent company of NBC News.)\n\nThe filing comes after a yearlong prolific diss track battle between Drake and Lamar, who spent much of 2024 dropping a slew of tracks aimed at each other. But many fans declared Lamar as the winner of the feud, with “Not Like Us” becoming the bestselling rap recording of 2024. The artist swept this year’s Grammy Awards, taking home five wins, including song of the year and record of the year. Lamar’s momentum continued as he performed at the Super Bowl halftime show in February, where the crowd loudly sang along as he performed “Not Like Us.”\n\nGet top local stories in Philly delivered to you every morning. Sign up for NBC Philadelphia's News Headlines newsletter.\n\nDrake, whose real name is Aubrey Drake Graham, had accused UMG in November of conspiring to “artificially inflate” Lamar’s “Not Like Us” on Spotify, including by using a payola scheme to boost the song with iHeartRadio. Drake and iHeartMedia reached a settlement last month, but his claims against UMG remain active. UMG previously told NBC News that the “suggestion that UMG would do anything to undermine any of its artists is offensive and untrue.”\n\nIn January, Drake sued the record label in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, alleging in an 81-page lawsuit that UMG defamed him by spreading a “false and malicious narrative” when it promoted Lamar’s diss track. Lamar is not named in the lawsuit.\n\nUMG has denied the allegations. In its filing Monday, attorneys for UMG wrote that Drake’s claims are “utterly without merit and should be dismissed with prejudice.”\n\nIn response to the filing, Drake’s lead attorney Mike Gottlieb said, “UMG wants to pretend that this is about a rap battle in order to distract its shareholders, artists and the public from a simple truth: a greedy company is finally being held responsible for profiting from dangerous misinformation that has already resulted in multiple acts of violence.”\n\n“This motion is a desperate ploy by UMG to avoid accountability, but we have every confidence that this case will proceed and continue to uncover UMG’s long history of endangering, abusing and taking advantage of its artists,” he added.\n\nIn its Monday motion to dismiss Drake’s lawsuit, UMG’s court filing stated that “Not Like Us,” like most diss tracks between the two and throughout rap history, includes a series of “hyperbolic insults.”\n\n“Drake has been pleased to use UMG’s platform to promote tracks leveling similarly incendiary attacks at Lamar, including, most significantly, that Lamar engaged in domestic abuse and that one of Lamar’s business partners and managers is the true father of Lamar’s son,” the court filing stated. “But now, after losing the rap battle, Drake claims that ‘Not Like Us’ is defamatory. It is not.”\n\nIt claims that Drake had “goaded” Lamar into continuing the rap battle as well. After taking aim at Lamar in his April 2024 track “Push Ups,” Drake, “seemingly impatient with the time it was taking Lamar to respond,” released his follow-up diss track “Taylor Made Freestyle” on social media. (Drake took down the song after Tupac Shakur’s estate threatened legal action over his alleged use of artificial intelligence to re-create the late rapper’s voice.)\n\nUMG’s court filing stated that Drake “fails to state a claim” for defamation, second-degree harassment and that UMG violated New York General Business Law. It added that he cannot allege that UMG acted with actual malice, the standard of “deliberate or reckless falsification” that public figures must prove in order to win a defamation lawsuit.\n\nThe filing noted that diss tracks “are a popular and celebrated artform centered around outrageous insults, and they would be severely chilled if Drake’s suit were permitted to proceed.”\n\nUMG also pointed to Drake having signed an open letter in 2022 criticizing “the trend of prosecutors using artists’ creative expression against them” by treating rap lyrics as literal fact.\n\n“Drake was right then and is wrong now,” the record label’s filing stated, adding that his complaint’s “unjustified claims against UMG are no more than Drake’s attempt to save face for his unsuccessful rap battle with Lamar.”\n\nThis story first appeared on NBCNews.com.

Despite an extensive search, her body has not been found.\n\nGet top local stories in Philly delivered to you every morning. Sign up for NBC Philadelphia's News Headlines newsletter.\n\nThe Konanki family did not immediately respond to a request for comment Monday night.\n\nKonanki is a junior in biology at the University of Pittsburgh. She is from Loudoun County, Virginia, where her family lives.\n\nKonanki was last seen early March 6 after she went to the beach with friends.\n\nAfter her friends left the beach, she stayed behind with people she met on the trip. She vanished after 4:15 a.m. that day.\n\nThe last person thought to have seen Konanki has been identified as Joshua Riibe, 22, a senior at St. Cloud State University in Minnesota who is from Rock Rapids, Iowa.\n\nDominican authorities confiscated Riibe’s passport Friday as part of an investigation, his attorneys told NBC News.\n\nNBC News spotted Riibe with investigators and his attorney on a beach in Punta Cana early Sunday. He was seen pointing toward the sea while a group of security officials kept people away from the area.\n\nSpeaking exclusively to NBC News briefly at the resort where Konanki had been staying before she disappeared, and before he was spotted by NBC News on the beach, Riibe said, “I’m just trying to help them out,” adding: “The ocean is a dangerous place.”\n\nRiibe “has been confined to the hotel since the investigation began. He is permanently escorted by the police anywhere he goes. So no, he is not free to leave,” the law firm representing him said in an email Saturday.\n\nPesqueira, the national police spokesperson, said no signs of violence were found at the beach.\n\nA hotel spokesperson said red flags — which indicate “that the sea had a strong current and very high waves” — were flying when Konanki disappeared.\n\nIn an interview last week with Dominican investigators, Riibe said he was on the beach with Konanki shortly before she disappeared.\n\nHe said they were “in waist-deep water, talking and kissing a little,” according to a transcript of the interview obtained by NBC News. A wave crashed, taking them both “out to sea,” it quotes him saying.\n\n“I kept trying to get her to breathe, but that didn’t allow me to breathe all the time, and I swallowed a lot of water,” he said.\n\nRiibe said he got Konanki back to shore before she disappeared.\n\n“The last time I saw her, I asked if she was OK. I didn’t hear her answer,” he said. “I looked around and didn’t see anyone. I thought she’d grabbed her things and left.”\n\nAuthorities in the Dominican Republic have said no one is considered a suspect in Konanki's disappearance.\n\nU.S. authorities have said it is a missing persons case and not a criminal matter.\n\nThis story first appeared on NBCNews.com.

        "content": "The Eagles have reached an agreement on a one-year deal with veteran edge rusher Azeez Ojulari, a league source confirmed to NBC Sports Philadelphia.\n\nThe one-year deal is worth $4 million, ESPN’s Jeremy Fowler reported.\n\nOjulari, 24, spent the first four years of his career with the New York Giants. He was drafted in the second round out of Georgia in 2021 and has 22 career sacks in 46 games.\n\nWhile Ojulari has been productive in his NFL career, he has dealt with plenty of injuries that have limited him. Ojulari as a rookie in 2021 played all 17 games but in the three years since has played 7, 11 and 11 games.\n\nGet top local stories in Philly delivered to you every morning. Sign up for NBC Philadelphia's News Headlines newsletter.\n\nLike all of the Eagles’ free agent signings this offseason, Ojulari represents a buy-low player with upside — low-risk, high-reward. He’s clearly talented and is worth a shot but there are reasons he didn’t cash in during free agency. Still, this seems like a wise signing.\n\nLast season, Ojulari played in 11 games with 5 starts and had 6 sacks, 10 QB hits and 7 TFLs. His best season actually came when he was able to play out a full season as a rookie and had a career-high eight sacks.\n\nIn his career, Ojulari had a lot of success against the Eagles. In six career games against the Birds, he had 5 sacks and 4 QB hits. He has more sacks against the Eagles than he does against any other team in the NFL, including the Commanders (2 1/2) and the Cowboys (1/2) in the division.\n\nWith the Eagles, Ojulari will bolster a position group that lost Josh Sweat in free agency to the Arizona Cardinals on a $76 million deal. The Eagles’ top returning players at the position are Nolan Smith and Jalyx Hunt. They also still have Bryce Huff on the roster after a disappointing first season with the Eagles. And they’re still waiting to hear about Brandon Graham’s future.\n\nThe Eagles last week signed Josh Uche in free agency to a deal that’s worth less than half of this reported deal for Ojulari. So it seems more likely that Ojulari factors into the edge rusher rotation in 2025.\n\nYou can go ahead and add Ojulari to the growing number of former Georgia Bulldog defenders on the Eagles roster. They also have Smith, Jalen Carter, Nakobe Dean, Jordan Davis, Kelee Ringo and Lewis Cine.\n\nSubscribe to Eagle Eye anywhere you get your podcasts:\n\nApple Podcasts | YouTube Music | Spotify | Stitcher | Simplecast | RSS | Watch on YouTube",

Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, where he took a tour and chaired a meeting of its board of directors.\n\nIt was his first time at the marquee arts institution since he began remaking it at the start of his second term in office. Trump fired the previous board of the Kennedy Center, writing on social media that they “do not share our Vision for a Golden Age in Arts and Culture.” He replaced them with loyalists, including White House chief of staff Susie Wiles, Attorney General Pam Bondi and Usha Vance, the wife of Vice President JD Vance, and installed himself as chairman.\n\nThe Republican president's allies have complained that the Kennedy Center, which is known for its annual celebration of notable American artists, had become too liberal and “woke” with its programming.\n\nGet top local stories in Philly delivered to you every morning. Sign up for NBC Philadelphia's News Headlines newsletter.\n\nTrump complained of “tremendous disrepair” Monday speaking to reporters ahead of the board meeting, saying the center “represents a very important part of D.C. and actually our country.” He expressed displeasure with the recent expansion of the complex, known as “The Reach,\" which features studios, rehearsal spaces and meeting facilities, suggesting he would move to close up the spaces because they lack windows.\n\nTrump also discussed plans to “improve very greatly” the Kennedy Center and its upcoming artistic programming.\n\n“We are going to have some really good shows,\" he said, adding, “The thing that does well are Broadway hits.”\n\nSeveral artists and productions, including Broadway smash “Hamilton,” have backed out of performances at the Kennedy Center in protest of the Trump takeover. “I was never a big fan, I never liked ‘Hamilton’ very much,” Trump said in response.\n\nTrump also complained about staging costs at the center, saying musician Lee Greenwood wanted to perform Monday at the first board meeting he chaired, but it would cost $30,000 to “move a piano.”\n\nThe Kennedy Center, which sits on the banks of the Potomac River, opened in 1971 and has enjoyed bipartisan support over the years.\n\nHowever, Trump has a fraught relationship with it, dating to his first term as president. He skipped the annual honors ceremony each year he was in the White House. Trump posed for photos in the Opera House's president's box behind the presidential seal Monday.",

Sign up for NBC Philadelphia's News Headlines newsletter.\n\nOn June 18, 2024, Becker packaged about 200 fossils into 19 separate boxes, which was about 80% of his collection. Each package weighed 20 to 60 pounds, the suit said. The fossils were brought to the WPU mailroom that same day and given to mailroom supervisor Raymond Boone, who is also named as a defendant in the case.\n\nThe packages were picked up by the United Parcel Service on June 18. Becker was told by Boone that he would receive tracking and insurance information, but Becker claims he never received it, according to the lawsuit.\n\nIn the following weeks, the suit said Becker's colleague in Florida informed him that the fossils had never arrived.\n\nBecker said he received tracking information on Aug. 20 after making two phone calls to the mailroom to speak with Boone, the lawsuit said. Tracking information indicated that the packages were in Parsippany, New Jersey, awaiting delivery.\n\nBecker would repeatedly contact Boone over the course of a month regarding the packages, the suit said, and Boone assured him on three separate occasions that he was “working on the issue.”\n\nOn Sept. 20, Boone advised Becker that the fossil packages were possibly being held at the UPS fraud department, according to the lawsuit. Becker contacted UPS directly on Sept. 30 and was informed that his packages were intercepted because WPU failed to pay outstanding invoices. As a result, the university's account had been canceled.\n\n“Our client learned that the packages were dumped at an unidentified landfill somewhere in or around Nashville, Tennessee,” the suit states.\n\nWPU's account with UPS was canceled on April 24. The suit claims Boone had been aware of this since July 8 and alleges several other packages from other individuals had also been confiscated for the same reason.\n\nBecker is seeking unspecified damages for the irreplaceable collection, plus medical expenses for the emotional distress the ordeal has caused him, the suit said.\n\nBoone declined to comment.

The company's cloud security products include prevention, active detection and response, a portfolio that's appealed to large firms and would have helped Google compete with Microsoft, which also sells security software.\n\n\"Becoming part of Google Cloud is effectively strapping a rocket to our backs: it will accelerate our rate of innovation faster than what we could achieve as a standalone company,\" Rappaport said in a blog post Tuesday.\n\nGoogle has a long history in dealmaking and snatching up smaller companies to broaden its offerings to customers. Its largest deal before Wiz was the $12.5 billion acquisition of hardware marker Motorola in 2012. Two years later, the company sold some assets to Lenovo for $2.9 billion. Google has also made cybersecurity acquisitions in the past, paying $5.4 billion for Mandiant in 2022.\n\nWiz's products will still work on competitor platforms including Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure and Oracle Cloud, the companies said. The Wall Street Journal first reported Monday that the companies were in advanced discussions.\n\nWhile the agreement may still draw government scrutiny, many on Wall Street have been hopeful that President Donald Trump's new White House administration will be more amenable to tech industry deals. Alphabet is currently battling an antitrust suit over its online search dominance.\n\n— CNBC's Jennifer Elias, Jordan Novet and Rohan Goswami contributed to this report.",

        "content": "A federal judge pressed a Department of Justice lawyer Monday over why the Trump administration did not comply with his order to temporarily halt deportations under an 18th century law and asked why key information was being withheld about the flights from over the weekend.\n\nIn a tense hearing, U.S. District Judge James Boasberg summarized the administration's position on his court order from Saturday as “we don’t care, we’ll do what we want.” Boasberg had directed any planes in the air carrying deportees to return to the U.S.\n\nThe Justice Department attorney, Abhishek Kambli, said the administration had complied with the judge's written order, which came hours after Boasberg's oral ruling at an emergency hearing Saturday. Kambli argued the written ruling took precedence over the one issued from the bench, adding, \"We believe that we’ve complied with the order.”\n\nThe judge said an order is an order.\n\nGet top local stories in Philly delivered to you every morning. Sign up for NBC Philadelphia's News Headlines newsletter.\n\n“You’re saying that you felt that you could disregard it because it wasn’t a written order,” Boasberg said, calling the Justice Department's argument \"a stretch.\"\n\nHe asked Kambli numerous questions about the flights - including how many there were and how many were in the air at the time - and the lawyer refused to provide any details, citing national security concerns.\n\nThe Alien Enemies Act is a rarely used 1798 law which allows the president to imprison and deport non-citizens in time of war. Here’s what you need to know.\n\n“I am only authorized to say what we have said” in the court filings, Kambli said.\n\nThe filing in question said the plaintiffs in the case “cannot use these proceedings to interfere with the President’s national-security and foreign-affairs authority, and the Court lacks jurisdiction to do so.”\n\nThe judge ordered Kambli to answer several questions about the flights by noon Tuesday, and to give him an official explanation about why he was not able to disclose that information in court at Monday's hearing, and what forum they can answer those questions in.\n\nBoasberg said he would issue a written order with those questions after the hearing “since apparently my oral orders don’t appear to carry much weight.” He scheduled another hearing for the matter on Friday.\n\nJust ahead of the hearing, the Justice Department sent a letter to a federal appeals court seeking to remove Boasberg from the case, arguing he endangered national security by having an inquiry about the initiative the administration announced on Saturday.\n\n\"The Government cannot—and will not—be forced to answer sensitive questions of national security and foreign relations in a rushed posture without orderly briefing and a showing that these questions are somehow material to a live issue. Answering them, especially on the proposed timetable, is flagrantly improper and presents grave risks to the conduct of the Government in areas wholly unsuited to micromanagement supervision by a district court judge,\" the letter said.\n\nThe court fight centers around the Trump administration's use of the Alien Enemies Act, a 1798 law, to deport individuals that it claims are part of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua.\n\nThe 18th-century law gives the president the ability to quickly deport immigrants from a \"hostile\" nation during war or when a foreign government perpetuates an \"invasion.\" It hasn't been invoked since 1941.\n\nBoasberg scheduled the hearing to determine the timeline of events since his Saturday evening order temporarily blocking Trump's use of the Alien Enemies Act to deport Tren de Aragua members.\n\nOn Saturday, the judge told a Justice Department lawyer to \"immediately\" inform his clients that any planes involved in deportations — and the people inside them that were subject to his order — needed to be returned to the U.S. However, the government reported in a Sunday filing that \"some gang members subject to removal under the Proclamation had already been removed from United States territory\" before Boasberg's order was issued.\n\n\"However that’s accomplished, whether turning around a plane or not embarking anyone on the plane or those people covered by this on the plane, I leave to you,\" Boasberg had said on Saturday. \"But this is something that you need to make sure is complied with immediately.”\n\nThe Justice Department had sought to vacate the Monday hearing in the hours before it occurred, saying that the questions about planes' locations \"implicate sensitive questions of national security, foreign relations, and coordination with foreign nations\" that were \"neither material nor appropriate.\"\n\nThis story first appeared on NBCNews.com.

        "content": "President Donald Trump says files related to the 1963 assassination of President John F. Kennedy will be released Tuesday without any redactions, making good on a promise he made during his campaign.\n\nTrump told reporters Monday that his administration will be releasing 80,000 files, though it’s not clear how many of those are among the millions of pages of records that have already been made public.\n\n“We have a tremendous amount of paper. You’ve got a lot of reading,” Trump said while at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington.\n\nHe also said he doesn’t believe anything will be redacted from the files. “I said, ‘Just don’t redact. You can’t redact,’” he said.\n\nGet top local stories in Philly delivered to you every morning. Sign up for NBC Philadelphia's News Headlines newsletter.\n\nMany who have studied what's been released so far by the government say the public shouldn’t anticipate any earth-shattering revelations from the newly released documents, but there is still intense interest in details related to the assassination and the events surrounding it.\n\nHere are some things to know:\n\nTrump's order\n\nShortly after he was sworn into office, Trump ordered the release of the remaining classified files related to the assassination, which has spawned countless conspiracy theories.\n\nHe directed the national intelligence director and attorney general to develop a plan to release the records. The order also aimed to declassify the remaining federal records related to the 1968 assassinations of Sen. Robert F. Kennedy and the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.\n\nAfter signing the order, Trump handed the pen to an aide and directed that it be given to Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the Trump administration's top health official. He's the nephew of John F. Kennedy and son of Robert F. Kennedy. The younger Kennedy, whose anti-vaccine activism has alienated him from much of his family, has said he isn’t convinced that a lone gunman was solely responsible for his uncle's the assassination.\n\nNov. 22, 1963\n\nWhen Air Force One carrying JFK and first lady Jacqueline Kennedy touched down in Dallas, they were greeted by a clear sky and enthusiastic crowds. With a reelection campaign on the horizon the next year, they went to Texas for a political fence-mending trip.\n\nBut as the motorcade was finishing its parade route downtown, shots rang out from the Texas School Book Depository building. Police arrested 24-year-old Lee Harvey Oswald, who had positioned himself from a sniper’s perch on the sixth floor. Two days later, nightclub owner Jack Ruby fatally shot Oswald during a jail transfer.\n\nA year after the assassination, the Warren Commission, which President Lyndon B. Johnson established to investigate, concluded that Oswald acted alone and that there was no evidence of a conspiracy. But that didn't quell a web of alternative theories over the decades.\n\nThe JFK files\n\nIn the early 1990s, the federal government mandated that all assassination-related documents be housed in a single collection in the National Archives and Records Administration. The collection of over 5 million pages of records was required to be opened by 2017, barring any exemptions designated by the president.\n\nTrump, who took office for his first term in 2017, had said that he would allow the release of all of the remaining records but ended up holding some back because of what he called the potential harm to national security. And while files continued to be released during President Joe Biden’s administration, some remain unseen.\n\nResearchers have estimated that 3,000 files or so haven’t been released, either in whole or in part.\n\nAnd last month, the FBI said that it had discovered about 2,400 new records related to the assassination. The agency said then that it was working to transfer the records to the National Archives to be included in the declassification process.\n\nThere are still some documents in the JFK collection that researchers don’t believe the president will be able to release. Around 500 documents, including tax returns, weren’t subject to the 2017 disclosure requirement.\n\nWhat's been learned\n\nSome of the documents already released have offered details on the way intelligence services operated at the time, including CIA cables and memos discussing visits by Oswald to the Soviet and Cuban embassies during a trip to Mexico City just weeks before the assassination. The former Marine had previously defected to the Soviet Union before returning home to Texas.\n\nOne CIA memo describes how Oswald phoned the Soviet embassy while in Mexico City to ask for a visa to visit the Soviet Union. He also visited the Cuban embassy, apparently interested in a travel visa that would permit him to visit Cuba and wait there for a Soviet visa. On Oct. 3, more than a month before the assassination, he drove back into the United States through a crossing point at the Texas border.\n\nAnother memo, dated the day after Kennedy’s assassination, says that according to an intercepted phone call in Mexico City, Oswald communicated with a KGB officer while at the Soviet embassy that September.\n\nThe releases have also contributed to the understanding of that time period during the Cold War, researchers said.",

        "content": "President Donald Trump is to hold talks on Tuesday with Russian President Vladimir Putin as he looks to get buy-in on a U.S. ceasefire proposal he hopes can create a pathway to ending Russia’s devastating war on Ukraine.\n\nThe White House is optimistic that peace is within reach even as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy remains skeptical that Putin is doing much beyond paying lip service to Trump as Russian forces continue to pound his country.\n\nThe engagement is just the latest turn in dramatically shifting U.S.-Russia relations as Trump made quickly ending the conflict a top priority — even at the expense of straining ties with longtime American allies who want Putin to pay a price for the invasion.\n\n“It’s a bad situation in Russia, and it’s a bad situation in Ukraine,” Trump told reporters on Monday. “What’s happening in Ukraine is not good, but we’re going to see if we can work a peace agreement, a ceasefire and peace. And I think we’ll be able to do it.”\n\nGet top local stories in Philly delivered to you every morning. Sign up for NBC Philadelphia's News Headlines newsletter.\n\nIn preparation for the Trump-Putin call, White House special envoy Steve Witkoff met last week with Putin in Moscow to discuss the proposal. Secretary of State Marco Rubio had persuaded senior Ukrainian officials during talks in Saudi Arabia to agree to the ceasefire framework.\n\nThe U.S. president said Washington and Moscow have already begun discussing “dividing up certain assets\" between Ukraine and Russia as part of a deal to end the conflict.\n\nTrump, who during his campaign pledged to quickly end the war, has at moments boasted of his relationship with Putin and blamed Ukraine for Russia’s unprovoked invasion, all while accusing Zelenskyy of unnecessarily prolonging the biggest land war in Europe since World War II.\n\nPutin’s spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters on Tuesday that Trump and Putin will discuss the war in Ukraine but added that there are also a “large number of questions\" regarding normalizing U.S.-Russia relations. The call will take place between 1 p.m. and 3 p.m. GMT (9 a.m. and 11 a.m. ET), Peskov said.\n\nTrump has said that swaps of land and power plants will be part of the conversation.\n\nWitkoff and White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt suggested that U.S. and Russian officials have discussed the fate of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant — Europe's largest — in southern Ukraine.\n\nThe plant has been caught in the crossfire since Moscow sent troops into Ukraine in 2022 and seized the facility shortly after. The U.N.’s International Atomic Energy Agency has repeatedly expressed alarm about it, fueling fears of a potential nuclear catastrophe.\n\nThe plant is a significant asset, producing nearly a quarter of Ukraine’s electricity in the year before the war.\n\n“I can say we are on the 10th yard line of peace,” Leavitt said. “And we’ve never been closer to a peace deal than we are in this moment. And the president, as you know, is determined to get one done.”\n\nBut Bradley Bowman, senior director of the Center on Military and Political Power at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, questioned whether Putin is ready to end the war or will hold out for potential further concessions as Trump grows impatient.\n\nAfter a disastrous Feb. 28 White House meeting with Zelenskyy, Trump temporarily cut off some military intelligence-sharing and aid to Ukraine. It was restored after the Ukrainians last week signed off on the Trump administration's 30-day ceasefire proposal.\n\n“The U.S. has been consistently offering in some form preemptive concessions that have been weakening the American and Ukrainian negotiating position,\" Bowman said. “I think there’s a real danger here that the administration’s approach is boiling down to sticks for Ukraine and carrots for Putin.”\n\nZelenskyy in his nightly video address on Monday made clear he remains doubtful that Putin is ready for peace.\n\n\"Now, almost a week later, it’s clear to everyone in the world — even to those who refused to acknowledge the truth for the past three years — that it is Putin who continues to drag out this war,\" Zelenskyy said.\n\nIn his dealings with Zelenskyy and Putin, Trump has frequently focused on who has the leverage. Putin has “the cards” and Zelenskyy does not, Trump has said repeatedly.\n\nTrump, who has long shown admiration for Putin, has also made clear he'd like to see the U.S.-Russia relationship return to a more normal footing.\n\nThe president during his recent contentious meeting with Zelenskyy grumbled that “Putin went through a hell of a lot with me,\" a reference to the federal investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election in which he beat Democrat Hillary Clinton.\n\nTrump on Monday again underscored his view that Ukraine is not in a strong negotiating position. He said Russian forces have “surrounded” Ukrainian troops in Russia's Kursk region — amplifying an assertion made by Russian officials that's been refuted by Zelenskyy.\n\nUkraine’s army stunned Russia in August last year by attacking across the border and taking control of an estimated 1,300 square kilometers (500 square miles) of land. But Ukraine’s forces are now in retreat and it has all but lost a valuable bargaining chip, as momentum builds for a ceasefire with Russia.\n\nZelenskyy has acknowledged that the Ukrainians are on their back foot but refutes Russian claims that they have encircled his troops in Kursk.\n\nTrump suggested that he's taken unspecified action that has kept Russia from slaughtering Ukrainian troops in Kursk.\n\n“They’re surrounded by Russian soldiers, and I believe if it wasn’t for me they wouldn’t be here any longer,” Trump said.\n\nLeavitt is one of three Trump administration officials who face a lawsuit from The Associated Press on First- and Fifth-Amendment grounds. The AP says the three are punishing the news agency for editorial decisions they oppose. The White House says the AP is not following an executive order to refer to the Gulf of Mexico as the Gulf of America.",

He was found starving and weighing just 68 pounds.\n\nSullivan was arrested last week after police launched an investigation.\n\nBack in 2005, Waterbury Police and Children's Services conducted a welfare check when the victim was 11 and had stopped going to school. The department said nothing unusual was detected. They went on to uncover the victim had begged classmates for food and ate items out of the garbage.\n\nThe victim says for years he was only allowed briefly out of his room to do chores, and that conditions in the house became worse when his father died last year.\n\nSullivan is facing charges of kidnapping, unlawful restraint and assault. Her lawyer acknowledged she was carrying out the rules put in place by her late husband.\n\nThe victim is still receiving medical care.",

Kennedy will be released without any redactions\n\nWASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump says files related to the 1963 assassination of President John F. Kennedy will be released Tuesday without any redactions, making good on a promise he made during his campaign.\n\nTrump told reporters Monday that his administration will be releasing 80,000 files, though it's not clear how many of those are among the millions of pages of records that have already been made public.\n\n\"We have a tremendous amount of paper. You've got a lot of reading,\" Trump said while at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington.\n\nHe also said he doesn't believe anything will be redacted from the files. \"I said, 'Just don't redact. You can't redact,'\" he said.\n\nMany who have studied what's been released so far by the government say the public shouldn't anticipate any earth-shattering revelations from the newly released documents, but there is still intense interest in details related to the assassination and the events surrounding it.\n\nHere are some things to know:\n\nTrump's order\n\nShortly after he was sworn into office, Trump ordered the release of the remaining classified files related to the assassination, which has spawned countless conspiracy theories.\n\nHe directed the national intelligence director and attorney general to develop a plan to release the records. The order also aimed to declassify the remaining federal records related to the 1968 assassinations of Sen. Robert F. Kennedy and the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.\n\nAfter signing the order, Trump handed the pen to an aide and directed that it be given to Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the Trump administration's top health official. He's the nephew of John F. Kennedy and son of Robert F. Kennedy. The younger Kennedy, whose anti-vaccine activism has alienated him from much of his family, has said he isn't convinced that a lone gunman was solely responsible for his uncle's the assassination.\n\nNov. 22, 1963\n\nWhen Air Force One carrying JFK and first lady Jacqueline Kennedy touched down in Dallas, they were greeted by a clear sky and enthusiastic crowds. With a reelection campaign on the horizon the next year, they went to Texas for a political fence-mending trip.\n\nBut as the motorcade was finishing its parade route downtown, shots rang out from the Texas School Book Depository building. Police arrested 24-year-old Lee Harvey Oswald, who had positioned himself from a sniper's perch on the sixth floor. Two days later, nightclub owner Jack Ruby fatally shot Oswald during a jail transfer.\n\nA year after the assassination, the Warren Commission, which President Lyndon B. Johnson established to investigate, concluded that Oswald acted alone and that there was no evidence of a conspiracy. But that didn't quell a web of alternative theories over the decades.\n\nThe JFK files\n\nIn the early 1990s, the federal government mandated that all assassination-related documents be housed in a single collection in the National Archives and Records Administration. The collection of over 5 million pages of records was required to be opened by 2017, barring any exemptions designated by the president.\n\nTrump, who took office for his first term in 2017, had said that he would allow the release of all of the remaining records but ended up holding some back because of what he called the potential harm to national security. And while files continued to be released during President Joe Biden's administration, some remain unseen.\n\nResearchers have estimated that 3,000 files or so haven't been released, either in whole or in part.\n\nAnd last month, the FBI said that it had discovered about 2,400 new records related to the assassination. The agency said then that it was working to transfer the records to the National Archives to be included in the declassification process.\n\nThere are still some documents in the JFK collection that researchers don't believe the president will be able to release. Around 500 documents, including tax returns, weren't subject to the 2017 disclosure requirement.\n\nWhat's been learned\n\nSome of the documents already released have offered details on the way intelligence services operated at the time, including CIA cables and memos discussing visits by Oswald to the Soviet and Cuban embassies during a trip to Mexico City just weeks before the assassination. The former Marine had previously defected to the Soviet Union before returning home to Texas.\n\nOne CIA memo describes how Oswald phoned the Soviet embassy while in Mexico City to ask for a visa to visit the Soviet Union. He also visited the Cuban embassy, apparently interested in a travel visa that would permit him to visit Cuba and wait there for a Soviet visa. On Oct. 3, more than a month before the assassination, he drove back into the United States through a crossing point at the Texas border.\n\nAnother memo, dated the day after Kennedy's assassination, says that according to an intercepted phone call in Mexico City, Oswald communicated with a KGB officer while at the Soviet embassy that September.\n\nThe releases have also contributed to the understanding of that time period during the Cold War, researchers said.",

        "title": "NASA's Suni Williams and Butch Wilmore have begun 17-hour journey to splashdown off Florida coast",
        "source": "https://6abc.com/",
        "content": "NASA expects the return trip to end at about 5:57 p.m. ET, when the Dragon is scheduled to splash down off the Florida coast\n\nNASA's Suni Williams and Butch Wilmore - who gained international attention as their planned short stay in space stretched into a nine-month, politically fraught mission - are finally heading home.\n\nThe two astronauts climbed aboard a SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule alongside two teammates, NASA's Nick Hague and cosmonaut Aleksandr Gorbunov of Russia's Roscosmos space agency, and departed the International Space Station at 1:05 a.m. ET Tuesday. They and began an approximately 17-hour journey toward a splashdown off the Florida coast.\n\nWilliams, Wilmore, Hague and Gorbunov are part of the Crew-9 mission, a routine staff rotation jointly operated by NASA and SpaceX. The Crew-9 capsule launched to the space station in September with Hague and Gorbunov riding alongside two empty seats reserved for Williams and Wilmore, who have been on the orbiting laboratory since last June, when their original ride - a Boeing Starliner spacecraft - malfunctioned.\n\nSafely reaching Earth will conclude a trip that, for Williams and Wilmore, has garnered broad interest because of the unexpected nature of their extended stay in orbit and the dramatic turn of events that prevented them from returning home aboard the Boeing Starliner vehicle.\n\nBut the length of the duo's stay in space is not record-breaking. Williams and Wilmore's extended mission is expected to conclude after 286 days, which is still significantly shorter than the world record of 437 days in orbit held by the late Russian cosmonaut Valeri Polyakov.\n\nWilliams, Wilmore, Hague and Gorbunov are on track to spend Tuesday morning and afternoon in orbit in the roughly 13-foot-wide (4-meter-wide), gumdrop-shaped SpaceX Crew Dragon spacecraft. Gradually descending, the capsule will carry the astronauts from the space station, which orbits about 250 miles (400 kilometers) above Earth, toward the thick inner layer of our planet's atmosphere.\n\nAround 5 p.m. ET, the Crew Dragon capsule is expected to fire its engines to begin the final phase of the journey: reentry. This leg of the journey is considered the most dangerous of any flight home from space. The jarring physics of hitting the atmosphere while traveling more than 22 times the speed of sound routinely heats the exterior of returning spacecraft to more than 3,500 degrees Fahrenheit (1,926 degrees Celsius) and can trigger a communication blackout.\n\nAfter plunging toward home, the Crew Dragon spacecraft will then deploy two sets of parachutes in quick succession to further slow its descent. If all goes to plan, the capsule will decelerate from orbital speeds of more than 17,000 miles per hour (27,359 kilometers per hour) to less than 20 miles per hour (32 kilometers per hour) as the vehicle hits the ocean.\n\nWilliams, Wilmore, Hague and Gorbunov are slated to splash down off the coast of Florida as soon as 5:57 p.m. ET Tuesday - though the exact time and location are subject to change as mission controllers keep tabs on weather and the progress of the crew's return trip.\n\nAfter the vehicle hits the ocean, a SpaceX rescue ship waiting nearby will haul the spacecraft out of the water, and Williams and Wilmore will exit Dragon and take their first breaths of earthly air in nine months.\n\nLast summer, NASA decided flying the two astronauts home aboard their Boeing Starliner capsule would be too risky, and the space agency opted to fold Williams and Wilmore into the International Space Station's regular crew rotation. That call is why the pair are flying home with Hague and Gorbunov on SpaceX's Crew-9 capsule.\n\nMedical teams will evaluate the crew's health, as is routine after astronauts return from space, before deciding next steps. Ultimately, the NASA crew members will return to their home base at Johnson Space Center in Houston.\n\nA political drama unfurls\n\nThe Crew-9 team is returning home this week because NASA and SpaceX successfully launched the Crew-10 mission to orbit on Friday.\n\nThe four Crew-10 astronauts - who will take over operations on board the orbiting laboratory - docked with the space station just after midnight ET on Sunday.\n\nNASA has maintained since last summer, when it announced Williams and Wilmore would join the Crew-9 team, that Crew-10 needed to be in place before the Starliner astronauts could leave orbit. That planning allowed NASA to keep the US-controlled portion of the space station fully staffed without needing to fly a separate, multimillion-dollar return mission for Williams and Wilmore. The United States jointly operates the space station with Russia, Japan, Canada and the participating countries of the European Space Agency.\n\nThe decision, however, has been the subject of apparent criticism from SpaceX CEO Elon Musk and President Donald Trump, who have claimed Williams and Wilmore were abandoned by the Biden administration.\n\nIn posts about the matter on X, Musk has said SpaceX could have brought Williams and Wilmore home months ago, but an offer was denied for \"political reasons.\"\n\nIt's not clear what that offer entailed or to whom it was offered.\n\nA Biden-era senior NASA official told CNN that SpaceX never communicated such an offer to agency leadership - and the space agency likely would not have entertained the idea regardless.\n\nIf Musk had made the offer to someone outside NASA leadership, the source noted, \"I'm sure they would have responded and said, 'Well, that would cost us several $100 million extra that we don't have for a new Dragon capsule and Falcon 9.'\"\n\nMusk has since said the offer was not made to NASA but was taken directly to the Biden White House, which \"refused to allow it,\" according to a post he shared on X.\n\nIt's unclear why such a deal would have been discussed with the White House, which does not typically have any involvement in NASA crew assignments or space station staffing matters.\n\nA former White House staffer did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nWhen asked about the matter during a news conference March 4, Wilmore said he was not familiar with what offer may have been made, but said of Musk's statements, \"I believe him.\"\n\nWhen asked about the matter Friday, Sarah Walker, SpaceX's director of Dragon mission management, also said she was not involved in the conversations referenced in Musk's social media posts.\n\n\"What I do know from almost 15 years of working with this exact team, with commercial crew and ISS, is that NASA is always looking at multiple options - every option available for any operation that they may go do - and then many contingency options for when the unexpected inevitably happens,\" Walker said.\n\nA history of extended stays in space\n\nWilliams and Wilmore's mission has been the subject of nearly constant speculation and scrutiny.\n\nThe astronauts have repeatedly sought to quash narratives that they were \"abandoned,\" \"stuck\" or \"stranded.\"\n\n\"That's been the narrative from day one: stranded, abandoned, stuck - and I get it, we both get it,\" Wilmore told CNN's Anderson Cooper in February. \"Help us change the narrative, let's change it to: prepared and committed despite what you've been hearing. That's what we prefer.\"\n\nWilliams has also faced a torrent of tabloid speculation about her appearance - despite NASA's repeated statements that she was healthy and had not lost weight.\n\nBut despite the outsize interest in Williams and Wilmore's mission, a number of astronauts have had their stays in space extended without warning.\n\nNotably, NASA astronaut Frank Rubio had been slated for a six-month mission at the International Space Station after he arrived aboard a Russian Soyuz spacecraft in September 2022. He instead logged a total of 371 days in space following the discovery that his spacecraft sprang a coolant leak. The Russian space agency launched a replacement Soyuz spacecraft for Rubio and his cosmonaut crewmates several months later.\n\nUpon his return to Earth in September 2023, Rubio's stay set a new record for the longest an American astronaut has ever spent in microgravity. He also became the first American to log an entire calendar year in orbit.\n\nDina Contella, NASA's deputy manager of the International Space Station program, sought to put Williams and Wilmore's extended stay in perspective with other missions during a news conference on Friday.\n\n\"There have been many crew members who've been on orbit longer than (Williams and Wilmore's stay), and so we don't see any need for any special precautions\" after splashdown, Contella said. \"Like any astronauts coming back, there's an acclimation period and so that'll vary by crew member.\"\n\nAstronauts returning from long-duration stays in space routinely exit their spacecraft on stretchers as their bodies need time to adjust to feeling Earth's gravity. Williams and Wilmore have extensive prior spaceflight experience, so they know to expect to spend a couple months readapting.\n\nIf NASA identifies any pressing medical concerns, the space agency can ferry the Crew-9 team members to a nearby hospital in Florida after splashdown, as was the case after the Crew-8 team returned from a nearly eight-month stay in space.\n\nAll four astronauts on board that mission later reported they were healthy, if still readjusting, after spending months in weightlessness.\n\n\"The weight and the heaviness of things just is surprising,\" Crew-8 astronaut Janette Epps said of her experience returning to Earth last year. \"(I've been) laying any chance I got. But you have to move, and you have to exercise every day, otherwise you don't get those gains. You have to move regardless of how exhausted you feel.\"\n\nHow Williams and Wilmore spent their days\n\nDespite the unexpectedly long stay, Williams and Wilmore have characterized their extra time in space as a bonus that they were well-prepared for, thanks to their deep experience as veteran astronauts.\n\n\"This is my happy place,\" Williams said in September. \"I love being up here in space. It's just fun. You know, every day you do something that's work ... (but) you can do it sideways, so it adds a little different perspective.\n\n\"Eventually we want to go home,\" she added, \"because we left our families a little while ago, but we have a lot to do while we're up here.\"\n\nBefore taking off aboard the Boeing Starliner capsule for its first crewed test flight last June, Williams and Wilmore were fully trained to join the space station staff - so they were ready for the scenario that ultimately unfolded as they embarked upon their mission.\n\nThe duo has engaged in routine daily tasks ever since. Williams even took over as space station commander, and both astronauts conducted spacewalks to carry out ISS maintenance.\n\nDuring a March 4 news conference from space, Williams said she will miss \"everything\" about being in space.\n\n\"This has been Butch and my third flight to the International Space Station,\" she said. \"I think just the fact that we're living up here in this very unique place gives you an amazing perspective - not only (with the view) out the window, obviously, but also just on how to solve problems, and I don't want to lose that spark of inspiration.\"\n\nThe-CNN-Wire & 2025 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

He was not robbed and the man says he didn't know his attackers.\n\n\"These males were not members. They were allowed to go back, so the reason why they were allowed to go back is unknown at this time,\" said Pendleton.\n\nEven though police call this an isolated incident, gym goers said they're alarmed the suspects got in and escaped undetected.\n\n\"I don't think anything like that should be happening here.

Callaghan’s Nashville SC in a chaotic 3-1 loss, the team’s first of the campaign under Carnell.\n\n“We lose momentum at certain moments in the game, and conceding before half-time was probably one of the killers” – Philadelphia Union Head Coach Bradley Carnell\n\nImage Credit: Philadelphia Union\n\nStarting XI\n\n‘If it’s not broke, don’t fix it’ was the thought process from Bradley Carnell coming into Sunday’s game against Nashville after his team started the 2025 season with a perfect 3-0 record. Ian Glavinovich missed out yet again as he makes his way back from a hamstring injury, with the only other change on the bench from last weekend being the inclusion of goalkeeper Oliver Semmle over Andrew Rick, who will likely start for Union II on Monday night.\n\nFormation: 4-2-2-2\n\nGK: A. Blake\n\nRB: F. Westfield, CB: J. Glesnes, CB: O. Makhanya, LB: K. Wagner\n\nCDM: D. Jean-Jacques, CDM: J. Lukić\n\nCAM: D. Gazdag, CAM: Q. Sullivan\n\nST: T. Baribo, ST: M. Uhre\n\nImage Credit: Philadelphia Union\n\nSurridge Gives Nashville Early Lead\n\nAfter attempting to start the game on the front foot at home, a misjudged challenge by Jakob Glesnes on a 50-50 ball played over the top sent Nashville SC and Sam Surridge on the break, looking to open the scoring 15 minutes in with their first opportunity of the match.\n\nSurridge, surging down the left side of the pitch and into the penalty box, cut to his right foot on a retreating Frankie Westfield, cut back to his right once more to evade Jakob Glesnes, and beat Andre Blake in the bottom corner of the net to give Nashville an early 1-0 road lead.\n\nImage Credit: Philadelphia Union\n\nLukić Levels Game with Volley\n\nIn the 33rd minute, Serbian midfielder Jovan Lukić pulled Union level with his 2nd banger in consecutive games. After a Kai Wagner corner was swung into the box and headed high into the air, Lukić planted himself under the ball, waited for it to come back to earth, and stuck it perfectly with his right foot, hitting the back of the net with Nashville keeper Joe Willis tangled up and out of his net.\n\n“We lost the game; that’s the only important thing. I just want to win. If I can score of course and win, that’s amazing, but we lose the game, so the feeling is like I didn’t do nothing, so I can’t be that happy because we lose this game”. – Jovan Lukic\n\nImage Credit: Philadelphia Union\n\nQasem Quiets Subaru Park with Late 1st Half Goal\n\nBack level and looking to take some momentum into the half-time break, another defensive mishap by a young Union backline sent Nashville on the break with a dangerous scoring opportunity. After Daniel Lovitz received the ball along the sidelines just inside Nashville’s own half, Frankie Westfield pinched up the field to put Lovitz under pressure, leaving space behind him for Jakob Glesnes to cover.\n\nLovitz played a ball over the top, which allowed a strong wind coming off the Delaware River to carry the ball behind Glesnes and into the path of Ahmed Qasem. Qasem, who had just missed the net on an opportunity about 10 minutes earlier, settled the ball with his first touch and struck it with his left on his 2nd touch to beat Andre Blake just inside the far post to give Nashville a 2-1 lead just before halftime.\n\n“Not every game is going to be a cakewalk; not every game is going to be as easy as we’d like it. We have to dig deep and today we dug deep but we just lost momentum at certain times, we’re not going to say there’s one mistake on one position for one player, for us it’s a calumniation, we believe in the collective. This is the classic “we all go down together”. – Bradley Carnell on Union’s struggles against Nashville SC\n\nImage Credit: Philadelphia Union\n\nGazdag Opportunity to Equalize Saved by Willis\n\nIn the 58th minute, Union created an opportunity to draw the game level when Quinn Sullivan whipped a right-footed cross into the box. Mikael Uhre and Walker Zimmerman battled for the first touch, sending the ball through the middle of the box and straight to Daniel Gazdag, waiting alone at the back post.\n\nGazdag needed to settle the bouncing ball with his chest first, which afforded Joe Willis time to scramble across the net just before Gazdag got off a right-foot shot. Their attempt was kicked away by the left foot of Nashville’s goalkeeper, keeping Nashville on top with just over a half-hour to play.\n\nImage Credit: Philadelphia Union\n\nA Pair of Controversial Penalty Calls\n\nTwo minutes after Joe Willis made a big save on Daniel Gazdag, Nashville’s defense was put to the test again when Kai Wagner sent a ball over the top and cross-field for Quinn Sullivan. Sullivan ran onto the ball, headed it into the box for himself to run onto, and attempted to cut the ball back to his left as he approached the end line.\n\nDaniel Lovitz, who assisted Nashville’s 2nd goal, went in for a sliding tackle on Quinn Sullivan and clearly made contact with Union’s midfielder, causing him to go over and Nashville to come away with the ball.\n\nThe referee, Pierre-Luc Lauziere, was sent to the monitor to have a second look at his no-call on the field and eventually decided that no obvious error was made and no penalty would be called on Nashville, which Union fans were obviously not pleased with.\n\nIn the 77th minute, and with Union still looking to equalize, Pierre-Luc Lauziere was sent to the monitor once again to check a potential penalty on Jakob Glesnes, who had appeared to strike the back of Hany Mukhtar’s skull as he attempted to head a loose ball away from Andre Blake’s net.\n\nGlesnes was late to the challenge and made contact with Mukhtar’s back, which was enough for Pierre-Luc Lauziere to grant Nashville a penalty. Frustrated by his decisions, some Union fans vented their displeasure with referee Pierre-Luc Lauziere by throwing Dollar Dogs onto the field as Mukhtar prepared for his attempt from the penalty spot.\n\nImage Credit: Philadelphia Union\n\nMukhtar’s PK Makes it 3-1\n\nWith Dollar Dogs flying onto the pitch and Union staff members running around the field to clean them up, Nashville’s Hany Mukhtar calmly stepped up to the penalty spot, took a deep breath, and beat Andre Blake with a cheeky panenka to give Nashville a late 3-1 lead on the road.\n\nThough they had already thrown most of their available hot dogs after the VAR review, an angered River End made sure to hurl boos and explosives at Hany Mukhtar and the rest of the Nashville squad that celebrated in front of the supporters’ section after their 3-point clinching goal.\n\n“It wasn’t good enough from me on all 3 goals, and I should never make the PK there either, so I have to take learning from that and just raise my head again because it’s a new day tomorrow and a new game on Saturday. So we have to work now into the next game against St Louis.” – Jakob Glesnes on his performance against Nashville SC\n\nImage Credit: Philadelphia Union\n\nSullivan misses consolation PK\n\nWith a minute left in stoppage time and probably too little too late, Union received an opportunity to get one back after Chris Donovan was taken out inside the penalty area. Quinn Sullivan immediately grabbed the ball and stood over the PK spot, and after a short decision with his team mates, stepped up to take the shot.\n\nJoe Willis guessed right on Sullivan’s attempt and kept the ball out with a diving stop but left the ball on the doorstep for one of Union’s attacking players to clean up and put away. Bruno Damiani got to the ball first, stabbed it towards the net, but put it directly into the gut of a recovering Joe Willis, who made another good save to keep the game 3-1.\n\nThe decision for Sullivan to take the penalty with Bruno Damiani, Union’s record signing, also on the pitch was an interesting one for me, especially with Tai Baribo set to miss Union’s match next weekend due to international duty. A goal for Damiani late in the game may have gone a long way in getting him confident ahead of his hopeful first start next Saturday.\n\nImage Credit: Philadelphia Union\n\nMakhanya’s Mental Lapse Leads to Red Card\n\nAfter the double save by Joe Willis on Quinn Sullivan and Bruno Damiani, Jacob Shaffelburg and Olwethu Makhanya got tangled up along the sideline, battling for a ball going out of play. As Makhanya tumbled to the ground as a result of contact from behind from Shaffelburg, he picked up the ball, aimed it at the Nashville player, and threw the ball directly at his head while lying on his back.\n\nIt was an easy decision for Pierre-Luc Lauziere to show a red card to Makhanya, who will now miss next weekend’s match against St Louis, with Union set to already miss 6 first-team players due to international duty.\n\n“It’s not just Tai that will be out, or Olwethu that will be out; we will miss a lot of guys for the International team, but it’s then another player getting a chance to show that they should start, and that’s what we’re fighting for every day, everyone wants to play. So now a couple of guys will get the chance to show they should be starters”. – Jakob Glesnes on Union being shorthanded against St Louis next weekend\n\nImage Credit: Philadelphia Union\n\nBe sure to return to Philly Sports Network for more Philadelphia Union and other soccer content!\n\nFollow our Union team on Twitter:\n\nTim Lovenguth | Jimmy King | Paul Frenzel\n\nNate Tennesen | Eric Frysinger | Steve Beavon\n\nTomiwa Aderinoye | Christopher Babos | Liam Jenkins\n\nDoop on Union fans!\n\nFeatured Image Credit: Philadelphia Union\n\n\n\n",

The right-hander’s 24.7 fwar is also the best in baseball.\n\nRegular season success is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to Zack Wheeler. In 12 post-season starts for the Phillies, Wheels has been dominant. In 12 games (11 starts, 1 relief appearance), Zack has pitched 70.1 innings with a 2.18 earned run average. He went 3-0 in the 2023 playoffs and last season pitched 7 scoreless against the New York Mets in his only start.\n\nTacking on 3 Top-6 finishes in the National League Cy Young award voting, the Phillies’ Opening Day starter has been nominated to 2 All-Star games and won a Gold Glove.\n\nZack Wheeler will join Aaron Nola, Cole Hamels, Roy Halladay, Curt Shilling, Steve Carlton, and Robin Roberts as some of the many Phillies starters to pitch multiple Opening Day games.\n\nOct 5, 2024; Philadelphia, PA, USA; Philadelphia Phillies pitcher Zack Wheeler (45) throws a pitch against the New York Mets in the first inning in game one of the NLDS for the 2024 MLB Playoffs at Citizens Bank Park.

        "content": "Sign up for our email newsletter to stay up-to-date on the latest local sports news throughout Philadelphia.\n\nThe Philadelphia 76ers found themselves in Houston Monday night, facing one of the Western Conference’s toughest teams. In a game that many expected the Sixers to be simply blown out in, Philadelphia dominated throughout stretches, forced overtime, and nearly walked away with the win thanks to another career night by Quentin Grimes.\n\nWhat went right?\n\nWhat is right? What is wrong? What is love? Baby, don’t hurt me, don’t hurt me, no more.\n\nThese are truly important questions that have all been turned on their heads this season as the Sixers went from contenders to lottery hopefuls. Whether you are rooting for the Sixers to work their way closer to the top of the reverse standings or for Quentin Grimes to secure generational wealth, you likely finished watching Monday night’s game with a grin or, at the very least, exhausted satisfaction attached to your face after the final buzzer.\n\nMar 17, 2025; Houston, Texas, USA; Philadelphia 76ers guard Quentin Grimes (5) shoots the ball as Houston Rockets guard Aaron Holiday (0) defends during overtime at Toyota Center. Mandatory Credit: Troy Taormina-Imagn Images\n\nFor the second time in Grimes’ 17 games played with Philadelphia, the rising stud scored a career-high in points, finishing with 46 points on the night. This marks the second game in which Grimes scored 40+ points for the Sixers, making him the fastest in Sixers franchise history, passing Wilt Chamberlain, who needed 19 games to accomplish the same feat back in 1965.\n\nThroughout much of the game, it looked as though Grimes’ success was inevitable and would come at the expense of the team’s spot in the draft standings. However, a strong third-quarter effort by Houston and an immaculate job to force the offensive rebound off the free throw into a last-second putback by the Houston Rockets. Following a heated overtime period, the game would end with a Rockets win, but in the favor of both franchises, given their direction this late in the season.\n\nWhat went wrong?\n\nThe only real flaw to begin the game was that the Sixers were performing too well for their own good. Risking a step closer to the Toronto Raptors, who were handily blown out by the Phoenix Suns that same evening.\n\nAs the game progressed, if one is to discuss right and wrong, good and bad, through a traditional sense and not through a tanking lense, Philadelphia once again showed an ineptitude to either the paint or the perimeter.\n\nMar 17, 2025; Houston, Texas, USA; Houston Rockets center Alperen Sengun (28) gets a put back on a missed free throw attempt by forward Jabari Smith Jr. (10) into the basket to tie the game in the final seconds of the fourth quarter against the Philadelphia 76ers at Toyota Center. Mandatory Credit: Troy Taormina-Imagn Images\n\nIt’s fair to point out that the team had exactly zero healthy centers in this matchup, the closest in resemblance being stretch-four Alex Reese. Still, Philadelphia has dealt with this issue regardless of the health status of its players. At this point, it’s easy to chalk the matter up as “who cares?” but it’s an issue the team will need to solve by next season if they’re going to look remotely close to competitive.\n\nSixers standings update\n\nWith the Brooklyn Nets off for the night, the Sixers’ movement was limited to working back to a tie with the Nets, while a Raptors loss in a blowout to the Phoenix Suns kept them within a game of both Brooklyn and Philadelphia.\n\nMar 17, 2025; Houston, Texas, USA; Houston Rockets guard Jalen Green (4) drives with the ball as Philadelphia 76ers forward Justin Edwards (19) defends during the second quarter at Toyota Center.

The Raptors are resting players left and right, the Sixers seemingly have another injury every day, and the Nets are simply not very good.\n\nThe Raptors have the easiest remaining schedule in the league, calculated by reverse record, the Sixers have the sixth easiest, and the Nets have the tenth easiest remaining record. Philadelphia has an incredibly difficult opponent as they’re set to face the Thunder, but after that, the schedule opens up a bit, potentially complicating Philadelphia’s plans to tank to the top.\n\nIf anyone was still squinting, hoping for Philadelphia to reach the Play-In tournament, a win by the Chicago Bulls has put them in a tie with the Miami Heat for the ninth seed and a full six games over the Philadelphia 76ers.\n\nUp next for the Sixers\n\nThe Sixers will travel next to Oklahoma City to face off against the best in the West, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and the Thunder.

Many familiar faces returned for the 2025 season with one in particular performing at his usual, excellent standard, and that was Andrew Rick Jr. Rick saved a penalty in the final few minutes of the game to save a point and keep a clean sheet. The young keeper then saved another penalty in the extra point shootout but his teammates missed the next 2 penalties and Union II lost the extra point.\n\nThere were plenty of debuts and new faces around the Union II team last week, with the likes of Isaac LeFlore making his Union II debut, and Union’s 2024 MLS SuperDraft pick forward Stas Korzeniowski also made his debut. More debuts are set to take place on Monday evening as Ryan Richter will be without Frankie Westfield and Kellan LeBlanc both received international callups and the team recently announced the signing of defender Rafael Uzcategui from Colombian top league side Boyaca Chico FC.\n\nUnion II’s bitter rivals, NYRB II, will be traveling to Subaru Park after a solid 1-0 road win over Atlanta United 2.

Last season, they faced each other three times, with the record being split 1-1-1. They played to a 1-1 draw in the first game of the three-game series, but Union II came out on top in the extra-point shootout, 4-3.\n\nThey then played in New York later in the same month, and Philly smashed their rivals 5-1. Braces by both David Vazquez and Markus Anderson, with the opening goal courtesy of Eddy Davis, secured all three points. The final meeting of these two sides last season saw NYRB II convincingly win 4-1 at Subaru Park in an extremely rare disappointing performance from Union II.\n\nRyan Richter will be looking to get his first win in his first home game as Union II head coach in this one. Tickets are available for the game on the Union II website, but if you can’t get down to Subaru Park on Monday evening for the 7 p.m. ET kickoff time, the game will be available to watch live on Apple TV via an active MLS Season Pass subscription.\n\nImage Credit: Philadelphia Union II\n\nBe sure to return to Philly Sports Network for more Philadelphia Union and other soccer content!\n\nFollow our Union team on Twitter:\n\nTim Lovenguth | Jimmy King | Paul Frenzel\n\nNate Tennesen | Eric Frysinger | Steve Beavon\n\nTomiwa Aderinoye | Christopher Babos | Liam Jenkins\n\nDoop on Union fans!\n\nFeatured Image Credit: Philadelphia Union II",

        "content": "Faculty and staff at the Community College of Philadelphia could go on strike.\n\nSign up for our Daily Email newsletter to stay up-to-date on the latest local news throughout Philadelphia.\n\nMembers of a union representing Community College of Philadelphia employees have authorized a strike, raising the possibility that classes could be disrupted for thousands of students with less than two months until graduation.\n\nThe college’s Faculty and Staff Federation, also known as AFT Local 2026, said 97% of those who took part in the weeklong poll, which ended Saturday, voted in favor of the strike authorization. About 1,200 full-time faculty, adjunct professors and staff belong to the union.\n\n“This vote sends a strong message to the college that their current offer is unacceptable and that our members are willing to do whatever it takes to secure fair pay and better working conditions, both for themselves and for our students,” Local 2026 co-President Junior Brainard said Monday in a statement.\n\nWhile the vote gives the union’s leaders the option to organize picket lines, CCP employees will not necessarily walk off the job, and there is no deadline for when a strike would be called. Local 2026 representatives said members are “strike ready” but added that a work stoppage “would be a last resort.”\n\nNegotiators have been meeting to discuss three separate contracts – for each job grouping – since January 2024, and workers have been without a contract for more than six months. The federation last went on strike in 2007, resulting in classes being canceled for two weeks.\n\nCCP administrators earlier this month asked the Pennsylvania Labor Relations Board to appoint an independent fact-finding panel to review contract proposals and offer recommendations to resolve the impasse. The PRLB approved the college’s request at a meeting Tuesday morning and appointed a fact-finder.\n\nUnion officials opposed the effort, which shows they are “more interested in striking than doing the work to ensure that students can graduate on time,” the college said in a pointed statement issued Monday.\n\n“The college welcomes the insight of a neutral third party and can only wonder why the federation would not be confident enough in their position to invite the same,” CCP added in the prepared remarks.\n\nRepresentatives from the college noted that Pennsylvania labor laws prohibit public employees from striking during the fact-finding process.\n\nCCP leadership has offered a 13% pay raise over three years, while Local 2026’s latest proposal incorporates a 30% increase in four years.\n\nUnion organizers say the raises are necessary to keep pace with inflation and the salaries at nearby schools, such as Temple University, where pay for adjunct instructors has jumped substantially.\n\n“We are hemorrhaging people because the college isn’t keeping pace with the market,” said Jamie Zigarelli, Local 2026’s treasurer. “And the dedicated folks who remain are now doing the work of two people.”\n\nThe union is advocating for increased staffing across a variety of positions; CCP says it hired 20 new faculty last year, bringing the student-to-faculty ratio to 14-1, down from 18-1 during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nAdministrators have also proposed decreasing maximum class sizes and increasing the credit load for full-time professors.\n\nLocal 2026 has pushed the college to provide transit passes for employees and students. CCP officials said they have met with SEPTA multiple times and that the authority’s Key Advantage program “remains unaffordable for the college at this time.”",

After losing Joel Embiid, Jared McCain, and Eric Gordon to season-ending injuries while most of their roster sits with lingering injuries, Paul George became the latest Sixers on the season-ending list after he received injections in his left adductor muscle and left knee on Monday, March 17, according to ESPN’s Shams Charania.\n\nShortly after the news broke, the Sixers released a statement about George undergoing the injections and missing the rest of the season.\n\nFeb 5, 2025; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA; Philadelphia 76ers forward Paul George (8) observes the national anthem before the game against the Miami Heat at Wells Fargo Center. Mandatory Credit: Kyle Ross-Imagn Images\n\n“Following consultations with specialists, as part of his treatment plan, Paul George has received injections in both his left adductor muscle and left knee,” A Sixers’ spokesperson said. “Following the procedure, George is medically unable to play and will be out for at least six weeks. Further updates on his recovery will be provided as appropriate.”\n\nGeorge is expected to be out for at least six weeks, and the rest of the regular season will end in just under a month. The 34-year-old suffered two hyperextensions and bone bruises in his left knee in October and November, a finger tendon tear in January, and dealt with groin soreness over recent weeks.\n\nGeorge ends his season after playing just 41 games while averaging 16.2 points, 5.3 rebounds, and 4.3 assists while shooting just 43% from the field and 35.8% from beyond the arc. Without question, George’s first season was an unmitigated disaster essentially from the beginning for many reasons, but none more than the relentless undermining of the injury bug.\n\nFeb 11, 2025; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA; Philadelphia 76ers forward Paul George (8) drives with the ball against the Toronto Raptors in the first quarter at Wells Fargo Center.

On Thursday, March 13, ESPN’s Shams Charania reported that George was meeting with doctors to discuss treatment options for his groin and knee injuries, including possible procedural options.\n\nThe following day, ahead of the team’s matchup against the Indiana Pacers, Head Coach Nick Nurse told the media that an announcement would come early the following week.\n\nWith Embiid and now George on the sideline for the rest of the season, in addition to the other season-ending and lingering team injuries, the Sixers are now in a prime position to continue tanking this season in hopes of retaining their draft pick this season, which Oklahoma City Thunder owns, but protected for the top six selections.\n\nFor the latest breaking news on your Philadelphia 76ers and other Philly sports, follow Zach Ciavolella on X — @CiavoNBA and Bluesky — @ciavo.bsky.social",

It was a tragic day at the office for Bradley Carnell, who led his Philadelphia team into their first loss of the season.\n\nImage Credit: Philadelphia Union\n\nA Sunday Shakeup in MLS’s Eastern Conference\n\nOn Sunday afternoon, Philly went to war with an aggressive enemy that came with more violence than they could contain. Nashville SC invaded Subaru Park, posed vicious threats, and asked puzzling questions that the Union had no answers to.\n\nAfter a dramatic red card for Makhanya in extra time, the match ended 3-1 in favor of the visitors. With two goals in the first half and another late into the second half, Nashville SC successfully pulled Philadelphia Union off the top of the table and dropped them in second place.\n\nDuring his pre-match presser, Philly’s head coach highlighted two Nashville players as potential threats to his team and praised Mukhtar, whose feet were described as a collection of myriad possibilities. Like in a self-sabotaging prophecy, Carnell bore the gruesome pain of watching the two players (Mukhtar and Surridge) score the first and last goals for the opposition.\n\nJovan Lukic’s half-volley, which came after a poorly defended corner kick found him, wasn’t enough to save the Union. All it did was even the score when Carnell’s men were a goal down. Philadelphia had the chance to reduce the deficit and save their goal differential with a penalty in extra time. Unfortunately, Sullivan kicked it straight into the path of the towering Joe Willis, who then saved the rebound with a catch.\n\nThe Union was totally outclassed by the brilliance of a Nashville side that surrendered possession to them and played the transitional style against them. Perhaps this was their main undoing, making it more justifiable that their only loss came in a game where the opposition was the counter-attacking team.\n\nHowever, that didn’t last long until Qasem’s goal made it a woeful afternoon for them. The same can be said of Union striker Tai Baribo, who had his first goalless game of the season. His unproductivity in front of goal kept his goal tally at six goals in four games, moving him only two goals ahead of second-placed Cuypers, who has four for the Chicago Fire this season.\n\nImage Credit: Philadelphia Union\n\nMessi and Miami overtake Philadelphia Union… for now\n\nThe Union’s slip from the top of the table was quickly capitalized on by Inter Miami, who won their away fixture against Atlanta. In the game, Lionel Messi marked his return by scoring Miami’s first goal in the 20th minute. They made a late comeback against Atlanta with super sub, and former Union player, Fafa Picault scoring the second in the 89th minute.\n\nThe Union host Bradley Carnell’s former team, Saint Louis, at Subaru Park this weekend, hoping to overturn the shocking result of matchday five. However, the Union must stick with their winning formula if they want to reclaim their place at the top of the table. With the right game plan, the former St Louis City manager will be looking to make his former side pay for the sins of Nashville.\n\nInter Miami forward Lionel Messi (10) dribbles the ball under pressure from Orlando City midfielder Martín Ojeda (11) and Orlando City defender Rafael Santos (3) during the first half of an MLS soccer match, Saturday, March 2, 2024, in Fort Lauderdale, Fla.

With a win over the Mavericks on Sunday, the Sixers remain a half-game back from the fifth position that the Brooklyn Nets currently hold after their win over the Hawks. The Rockets, meanwhile, are tied with the Nuggets and Timberwolves for second place in the Western Conference.\n\nSixers game information\n\nWho: Philadelphia 76ers (23-44) at Houston Rockets (43-25)\n\nWhen: 8 p.m. EST\n\nWhere: Toyota Center, Houston, TX\n\nWatch: AT&T SportsNet Southwest\n\nLatest on the Sixers\n\nThe Sixers are in Houston fresh off their victory over the Mavericks on Sunday, a game that was closer at the end than it was for much of the fourth quarter. The Sixers were never going to lose all of their games, and each one is important to their goal of keeping their first-round pick in the upcoming draft. If they can finish with the fifth-worst record in the league, they stand a much better chance of securing a top-six pick and holding off the Thunder from claiming the pick.\n\nWhat the games have come down to, of late, is Quentin Grimes. In his first game against the team that dealt him at the deadline this season, Grimes finished with 28 points and six assists while shooting 10-19 from the floor yet only hitting 2-7 on his three-point attempts. Grimes has played himself into a very good position as he’s a restricted free agent at the end of the year, and what he’s done with the Sixers has shown them that he can be a valuable piece of their puzzle moving forward.\n\nMar 16, 2025; Dallas, Texas, USA; Philadelphia 76ers guard Quentin Grimes (5) shoots over Dallas Mavericks guard Spencer Dinwiddie (26) during the second half at American Airlines Center. Mandatory Credit: Kevin Jairaj-Imagn Images\n\nPlayers like Ricky Council IV, Oshae Brissett, Jalen Hood-Schifino, Jeff Dowtin, and Jared Butler have all been getting quality minutes of late for the depleted Sixers team and have responded very well. While some won’t see much in the way of playing next season, they’re showing that, given some time, they could provide some value in a reserve role to the Sixers or another team. Justin Edwards continues to have some shooting woes from long distances, but his ten points and two steals have helped the Sixers as he’s shown that he can be a legitimate piece for the team moving forward.\n\nLatest on the Rockets\n\nThe Rockets are 7-3 over their last ten games and are currently on a six-game winning streak as they host the Sixers. The Rockets have a good young team that’s come together this season, led by Jalen Green and Alperen Sengun. Green leads the team with 21.3 points per game, while Sengun is averaging 19.2 points, 10.5 rebounds, and 4.9 assists on the year.\n\nMar 15, 2025; Houston, Texas, USA; Houston Rockets guard Fred VanVleet (5) congratulates guard Jalen Green (4) following the game against the Chicago Bulls at Toyota Center. Mandatory Credit: Erik Williams-Imagn Images\n\nWhile the team features a good number of quality young players like Green and Sengun, as well as Amen Thompson, Tari Eason, Jabari Smith Jr., and Cam Whitmore, they have a good number of veterans to provide leadership like Steven Adams, Fred VanVleet, Aaron Holiday and Dillon Brooks. What the Rockets have done over the past few years is exactly what the Sixers tried to start in 2014 with “the process”. The difference is that the Rockets still have some future draft picks they’ll be able to utilize as the veterans move on.\n\nWhat to watch for tonight\n\nThe Sixers will be trying their hardest again to win, but the Rockets are a healthy and talented squad to go up against. They’re one of the top teams in a very tough Western Conference. Despite missing Amen Thompson, who’s out with an ankle sprain, the team will be healthy and looking to move up and secure second place in the conference as the season wears down.\n\nWhile the Rocket’s offensive rating sits right in the middle of the league, they’re currently second in the league in defensive rating, which will be a problem for the undermanned and outgunned Sixers roster. The Rockets don’t move the ball as they should, with a league-worst assists ratio of just 16.2%, but they offset that with a league-best rebounding percentage. The Rockets are a sound defensive team, and that’s what has helped them to the top of the West.\n\nMar 15, 2025; Houston, Texas, USA; Houston Rockets guard Fred VanVleet (5) congratulates Houston Rockets forward Jabari Smith Jr (10) against the Chicago Bulls during the fourth quarter at Toyota Center. Mandatory Credit: Erik Williams-Imagn Images\n\nThe game will be a tough one for the Sixers as the Rockets are vying for one of the top positions in their conference and need to win each game to step away from the Nuggets and Timberwolves, while the Sixers should be ok with losing some games and gaining ground on the Nets for the fifth worse record. Against a very good defensive team like the Rockets, it will be interesting to see if Quentin Grimes can continue his hot play while the others continue to contribute as a whole. The game will be interesting as you’ll be able to see the difference in the success and failure of the two processes.\n\nPrediction\n\nSixers 95 – Rockets 118",

After opening the season with a road 0-0 draw with New England, Union II welcomed local rivals New York Red Bulls II to Subaru Park.\n\nImage Credit: Philadelphia Union II\n\nUnion II gets first shootout win of 2025\n\nRyan Richter made a few changes to the side that started the 0-0 draw against New England last weekend. Nick Pariano stepped into defense alongside new signing Ramzi Qawasmy, who was making his Union II debut after signing with Union II during the offseason from Atlanta United 2.\n\nEddy Davis, last season’s record-setting goalscorer, dropped to the bench, and Sal Olivas took his place, partnering big Stas Korzeniowski. Zach Mastrodimos came into the starting XI and took up Pariano’s position in midfield. The big-name trio of CJ Olney, David Vazquez, and Cavan Sullivan all started again.\n\nImage Credit: Philadelphia Union II\n\n1st Half\n\nThe opening 15 minutes of the game weren’t really anything to note. Both teams were playing with a lot of energy, but nothing of quality happened for either side. It was a very scrappy opening portion of the game. Five minutes later, though, the game had the opening goal.\n\nUnion II’s high-pressure system had been paying off with turnovers high up the pitch but never turned into anything until Big Stas won a free kick just outside the penalty box. Cavan Sullivan stepped up to take it, and he drilled it home from around 20 yards out to fire Ryan Richter’s side into the lead with a lot of quality, something the game was crying out for.\n\nThe following 10 minutes or so after Cavan Sullivan opened the scoring was all Union II but they failed to really cash in on the possession with quality chances. The best one they had was when Stas Korzeniowski had a shot from just behind the penalty spot but his shot was well blocked by a NYRB II defender.\n\nThe rest of the first was just the same as the whole of the first half: a lot of energy and desire from both teams on and off the ball, but no one with a bit of quality to set up a proper chance at scoring. NYRB II definitely came into the game more in the final 10 minutes or so of the half, but outside of a couple of corners and crosses, they never really threatened Andrew Rick in the Union II goal. Ryan Richter’s men headed into the half-time break 1-0 up in their season home opener.\n\nImage Credit: Philadelphia Union II\n\n2nd Half\n\nThe second half got underway and it followed the same theme as the first half, both teams looking to create something and putting a lot of energy into that but not coming up with anything. NYRB II played better than their first-half performance but still failed to make any major chances. The first chance of the 2nd half fell to CJ Olney as he cut inside off the left wing and tried to curl one into the far right-hand corner, but Aidan Stokes saved it well.\n\n65 minutes in, and Stas Korzeniowski almost had his first-ever goal for Union II as the big striker took a shot from just outside the box, which sailed agonizingly wide of the left post. Right after that chance for the forward, Oscar Benitez came on for his Union II debuts, and Jordan Griffin also entered the field of play, replacing both Isaiah LaFlore and Zach Mastrodimos.\n\nAfter making a couple of changes themselves, New York Red Bulls II really started coming into the game, and they had two great chances to level the score. One was from a cross to the back post, but the resulting shot was sent flying over the bar. The other was after a brilliant ball was played in from a free kick, but no one got onto the end of it.\n\n75 minutes in, Ryan Richter decided to use two more substitutions. This time, Sal Olivas and CJ Olney left the field for Eddy Davis and Leandro Soria. NYRB II thought they had the equalizer just a minute after the changes, but the goal was ruled out for offside. NYRB II then had another incredible chance to equalize, but the flicked finish from 6 yards out was sent well wide, and Ryan Richter’s side was hanging on for dear life.\n\nCavan Sullivan then had a great chance to double both his and his team’s goal tallies, but he completely scuffed his shot from inside the box. After the resulting kick from the goalkeeper, Gavin Wetzel takes out an NYRB II attacker as he was through on goal and receives a red card. A few minutes later, with less than 10 minutes to go, goalscorer Cavan Sullivan was replaced by Kellan LeBlanc in Ryan Richter’s final change of the game.\n\nUnion II, down to 10 men, had two great chances to kill the game off on counterattacks. The first broke down right outside the NYRB II penalty box, after Big Stas couldn’t keep control of the ball and find a teammate. The second counterattack ended up with Eddy Davis with the ball, free at the back post, but his shot went well wide and into the side netting.\n\nIt seemed like Ryan Richter’s Union II was going to hold firm and survive the onslaught of New York Red Bulls II, but with just two minutes left of stoppage time, a brilliant, defense-splitting pass put Rosborough through on goal, and the NYRB II forward slotted home well past Andrew Rick.\n\nImage Credit: Philadelphia Union II\n\nAnother PK Shootout\n\nOnto the extra point penalty shootout, and things got off to a horror start when Nick Pariano saw his opening penalty saved by Aidan Stokes. He was bailed out by Andrew Rick, who saved NYRB II’s opening penalty for his 3rd penalty save in 2 games.\n\nUnion II then went two for two on their penalties, with big Stas and David Vazquez hammering their penalties home while Andrew Rick saved yet another penalty, his 4th penalty save in 2 games, to have Union II take a 2-1 lead after 3 rounds.\n\nLeandro Soria took Union II’s 4th penalty and made sure no keeper was ever saving it, while NYRB II sent their 4th penalty flying over the bar, probably out of the stadium and possibly into the river, which meant Union II won the extra point shootout 3-1 and take home 2 points from their home opener.\n\nImage Credit: Philadelphia Union II\n\nBe sure to return to Philly Sports Network for more Philadelphia Union and other soccer content!\n\nFollow our Union team on Twitter:\n\nTim Lovenguth | Jimmy King | Paul Frenzel\n\nNate Tennesen | Eric Frysinger | Steve Beavon\n\nTomiwa Aderinoye | Christopher Babos | Liam Jenkins\n\nDoop on Union fans!\n\nFeatured Image Credit: Philadelphia Union II",

For the third consecutive year, Philadelphia will be without a men’s basketball team to represent the city during March Madness. At least one school from the Philadelphia Big 5 made the tournament every year from 1978 to 2022, but that all changed in 2023 when all of Philadelphia’s men’s basketball teams failed to reach the tournament, a trend that has continued to this day.\n\nGone are the days of Jay Wright leading Villanova to the big dance. Gone is the brief revival of Temple basketball sparked by Lavoy Allen and Khalif Wyatt under Fran Dunphy. St. Joseph’s is the proven powerhouse of today’s Philadelphia Big 5, and yet they have not made the tournament since 2016.\n\nConsidering each team’s individual performance, it’s no surprise that none of them made it to the tournament. No school made it higher than fifth in their respective conference standings. The University of Pennsylvania won just eight games this season, while La Salle, Temple, and Drexel all finished with 14, 17, and 18 wins, respectively.\n\nVillanova, long the powerhouse under former head coach Jay Wright—having made the tournament every year from 2005 through 2022—has missed the tournament every season since Kyle Neptune took over for Jay Wright. After this third consecutive season coming up short, Villanova decided to part ways with Neptune after those three years—the price of succeeding success.\n\nSt. Joe’s, the clear-cut top of Philadelphia basketball this season, ultimately fell short also, despite finishing the year with just one fewer win than the Philadelphia 76ers, who play an 82-game schedule compared to St. Joe’s 34-game season.\n\nHow will this turn around? Philadelphia won’t wake up suddenly and have an elite, tournament-worthy basketball team. It’s going to take a combination of continued player development, stellar recruiting—including selling players on the city and the pride of playing for one of these storied schools, and, to be frank, a fair bit of NIL funds, and strong, stable leadership from the coaching staff. Villanova, due to their recent rash of success, which included two NCAA tournament wins, may have the best chance of a rather quick turnaround, but much of that will depend on who replaces Neptune.\n\nFor now, Philadelphia will have to suffer the embarrassment that is three consecutive seasons without a tournament appearance by one of the city’s men’s basketball teams. On a brighter note, while Philadelphia’s women’s teams also came up short this season, they’ve boasted representation more recently than their male counterparts, as Drexel University’s women’s team made the tournament in 2024.",

It’s rare for a player to acclimate himself to a new environment so quickly. It is so rare, in fact, that by scoring 40-plus points within his first 17 games with the Sixers, Grimes set a franchise record, becoming the quickest to do so\n\nGrimes passed Hall of Fame Wilt Chamberlain, who needed 19 games back in 1965, for the honor.\n\nMar 17, 2025; Houston, Texas, USA; Philadelphia 76ers guard Quentin Grimes (5) reacts after making a basket during overtime against the Houston Rockets at Toyota Center. Mandatory Credit: Troy Taormina-Imagn Images\n\nThe 2024-2025 NBA season has been an absolute disaster for the Philadelphia 76ers, and yet, the year has also been filled with a rather large amount of smaller victories. While Jared McCain eventually suffered a season-ending injury, his play was an immensely positive surprise, as was the play of Guerschon Yabusele and rookies Justin Edwards and Adem Bona. Perhaps no surprise has been more welcome, however, than the play of Quentin Grimes since his arrival in Philadelphia.\n\nHaving acquired Grimes for merely an injured Caleb Martin and eventually a second-round pick — although Philadelphia also received a second-rounder in the idea, this is one move that has very quickly come to haunt the Dallas Mavericks organization.\n\nMar 16, 2025; Dallas, Texas, USA; Philadelphia 76ers guard Quentin Grimes (5) reacts after scoring against the Dallas Mavericks during the first half at American Airlines Center. Mandatory Credit: Kevin Jairaj-Imagn Images\n\nIn his 17 games with the Sixers, Grimes has averaged 21.4 points per game. During his last five games, Grimes has averaged an impressive. 32.6 points, 5.4 rebounds and 4.8 assists per game. This is not some Evan Turner-esque putting up points on a bad team; Grimes’ contributions have been legitimate, as reflected by his efficiency. He has shot 52.3% from the field and 42.9 from beyond the arc, making himself indispensable to this Sixers team, if only their objective were to still compete.\n\nStill, if Philadelphia is able to retain Grimes and he shows anything similar to what he has already displayed, the Sixers will happily take it, even if it means a few more near-wins.\n\nFor now, the Sixers’ biggest concern regarding this issue is that Grimes may be pricing himself out of their range. While Philadelphia holds the final say on Grimes’ free agent destination, thanks to his status as a restricted free agent, there remains the possibility that a team could sweep in and simply offer more than the Sixers are willing to pay under the new CBA.\n\nFor the latest breaking news on your Philadelphia 76ers and other Philly sports, follow Zach Ciavolella on X — @CiavoNBA and Bluesky — @ciavo.bsky.social\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

TCB has grown from serving 49 commercial corridors in 2020 to 155 commercial corridors currently, and an additional 24 corridors will be added in April.\n\nMore than 900,000 residents live within a quarter mile walk of the areas being served by the TCB program, according to the city’s commerce director, Alba Martinez. Last year, more than 177,000 bags of litter were collected by TCB crews.\n\n“TCB is a critical investment in litter reduction efforts and meaningful employment opportunities for local residents who live in neighborhoods served by this program,” Martinez added. “TCB cleaning ambassadors are on the front lines maintaining these business corridors. In addition to sweeping up litter, they interact with businesses and residents.”\n\nThe TCB program currently employs 324 cleaning ambassadors, servicing 155 commercial corridors and cleaning 21,000 blocks. Services across the city include cleaning sidewalks and streets, picking up litter, and planting new tress (369 trees have been planted and maintained through the program).\n\n“I’m not just cleaning the streets in Kensington; I’m making a difference in our local community. The change from when I started, to now, is outstanding. We’ve seen a lot more people going to work, getting their kids to school, and just living their day to day lives,” said Daniel Marshall, TCB Cleaning Manager. “Out on the streets, I see so many people who know me from a past life, and they congratulate me. They see the changes I’ve made in myself and in the community, and they’re proud of me. The TCB program brings me joy.”\n\nAs part of the TCB planned expansion, the Commerce Department has partnered with the Pennsylvania Horticultural Society to clean up vacant lots near commercial corridors as well. Since fall 2024, this partnership has cleaned up and fenced 192 vacant lots — this spring, they will add 192 more lots.\n\n“The transformation is wonderful,” said Michelle Feldman, Executive Director of the East Falls Development Corporation. “With the TCB crew, we are gaining a deeper understanding of our community while building stronger, trusting relationships with East Falls residents and businesses.”\n\nOrganizers are planning the next phase of TCB expansions, which will include more service areas, employment opportunities and environmental efforts, specifically fencing and maintaining more vacant lots, as well as planting and caring for more trees along commercial corridors.\n\n“Businesses on commercial corridors throughout the city frequently express how TCB contributes to their business success. They recognize that clean sidewalks bring more customers, and that the presence of friendly, uniformed cleaning ambassadors helps put people at ease,” said Denis Murphy, Deputy Commerce Director of TCB.\n\n“Street cleaning is very important for the quality of life in our neighborhoods and commercial corridors,” added Jerome Johnson, a TCB cleaning ambassador. “With an increase in crew members taking care of additional areas, we really could change this whole city.”",

This sounds like a big jump, but the veteran has been one of the most selfless players on the roster when it comes to reworking his contract to help the Eagles facilitate deals elsewhere on the roster and free up cap space.\n\nJohnson is now a two-time Super Bowl champion with the Eagles and a five-time All-Pro. He’s spent his entire career in Philadelphia after being drafted with the fourth overall pick back in 2013.

Even Ivan Fedotov, who started between the pipes, had one of the best games of his season with 21 saves.\n\nThe Flyers are 2-8-0 in their last 10 games.

The first elimination of the 2024-2025 Stanley Cup Playoffs took place on Monday, as the San Jose Sharks found themselves having a long offseason yet again. With this defeat, the Flyers found themselves retaking last place in the Metropolitan with 64 points. The reality is that Philly is second to last in the Eastern Conference, as the Buffalo Sabres are below Philadelphia with only 60 points.\n\nIt is almost impossible for the Flyers to make a playoff appearance this season. As players such as Emil Andrae have been called up, the lack of support around those players to develop them properly has stung. Andrae has been paired with Zamula since the call-up. Having him with a player like Nick Seeler would help more with his development, which the Flyers need to try to do. The season’s final games should focus on helping develop the young players.\n\nPhiladelphia gets ready to take on the Washington Capitals in a few days. The overall gameplan should be for the team to switch up some lines and pairings to see if there’s better ice chemistry yet to be tapped into. This is the best plan of action to play the younger players. A few more in Lehigh deserve a shot at getting called up before the season ends.\n\nMandatory Credit: Kyle Ross-Imagn Images",

Here are the trades that I believe the Eagles could benefit from.\n\nEagles receive 45 and 80 from Colts for 32 and 129\n\nEagles receive 50, 92, & 137 from Seattle for 45, 96, & 162\n\nEagles receive 114 from Arizona for 137 & 165\n\nThe Eagles have 20 projected draft picks over the next two seasons and have the flexibility to make as many deals as they see fit to draft the positions they want to fill. Moving up and down the board or trading picks for young cost-controlled players will all be on the table. This is when Howie Roseman is at his best.\n\nHowie Roseman has mentioned that learning from his mistakes after the past Super Bowl win in 2018 would require losing some of the sentimentality and attachment he had to the players who helped the team win it. This season, he has stayed true to his word, the Eagles have already lost 12 of their free agents, including one offensive starter and five on the defensive side. Retooling the team through the draft starts now!\n\nThe Eagles’ Draft Haul (7 selections)\n\nINDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA – FEBRUARY 25: General manager Howie Roseman of the Philadelphia Eagles speaks to the media during the NFL Scouting Combine at the Indiana Convention Center on February 25, 2025 in Indianapolis, Indiana. (Photo by Stacy Revere/Getty Images)\n\nRD2- 50 Mason Taylor, TE, LSU\n\nMason is a chain mover; he makes receptions from any spot on the line, often creating mismatches. Taylor has a knack for getting open, provides good YAC, wins contested catches and has above average hands. He had a 1.8% drop rate. In the right scheme, he will flourish. Mason showed off a more advanced route tree at Senior Bowl than he did during his time with LSU. He is one of my two favorite tight ends for the Eagles in this draft cycle.\n\nRD2- 64 T.J. Sanders, DT, South Carolina\n\nSanders has elite length, which he uses well to eliminate passing lanes. He displays a quick burst, is disruptive, and causes havoc in the backfield. T.J. provided an interior pass rush in college (8.5 in 2 seasons), sheds blocks well, and is a solid tackler with high TFL totals. He is one of my favorite prospects for the Eagles, a very toolsy and high-upside player who would thrive in the Eagles’ defensive scheme.\n\n(Other players available iOL Tate Ratledge and DT Joshua Farmer)\n\nRD3- 80 Charles Grant, iOL, William & Mary\n\nGrant is an explosive, strong player with 35+ inch arms. He played 227 pass blocking snaps in 2024 and lost eight snaps. His 96.48% win rate was good for 6th in class at iOL. Charles has a wrestling background, which I LOVE for OLs. He is a fluid, disciplined athlete blessed with vice grips for hands. He did not play for Georgia, but he has the mentality to fit in from day one.“On the field, I’m a dawg.”\n\n(another consideration at 80 for me was Edge Brady Swinson)\n\nRD3- 92- Andrew Mukuba, S, Texas\n\nAndrew thrives going downhill against the run. He is a strong tackler that attacks ball carriers with bad intentions. In his first season with Texas, he showed off great instincts, elite speed, and sticky coverage skills. He was also a YAC killer, which I love. Per sports-reference, he had 7 PBUs, five interceptions, 4 TFLs, and one forced fumble last year. Andrew returned to college to prove he was a complete player, mission accomplished.\n\n“To prove to everybody that I’m the best safety in the Draft.”\n\nHe also stated he has met with the Eagles. He would be a great fit in the Fangio defense.\n\n(other players available, Kevin Winston Jr, OT Ozzy Trapilo, and Edge Saivion Jones)\n\nRD- 4 114- Oluwafemi Oladejo, Edge, UCLA\n\nOladejo is a first-year edge, converted from LB, and the transition went better than anyone could have imagined. He can play for an NFL team in week one with his run stopping and edge setting ability. His closing speed is a cheat code. His motor runs hot and he also displays power! Femi has all of the traits and will only get better as he adds to his pass rushing repertoire. Oladejo gives off Jalyx Hunt vibes, not just because of changing positions, but attitude and size as well. 6’3, 260, and built to be a future star in the league.\n\n(other options included CB Nohl Williams, LB Jeffrey Bassa, and S Billy Bowman)\n\nRD 166- Hollin Pierce-OT, Rutgers\n\nHolln has the size, height, anchor, and hands that Eagles O-lien coach drools over. Standing 6’8 and weighing in around 340, Pierce is a roadblock. He plays with a controlled viciousness and is a mauler and a finisher on every play. Hollin will keep your QBs pockets clean, while blowing up double teams. He had the 3rd longest arms measured, and the 4th widest wingspan. Pierce is a tough, hard worker, and a riser on boards during the draft process! His stock is up, and he would be a great addition to Stoutland University.\n\n(other OT options in this range include Chase Lundt, Ajani Cornelius, Jack Nelson, and Brandon Crenshaw-Dickson)\n\nRD 169- Teddye Buchanan, LB, California\n\nTeddye has great instincts and the speed to move all over the field, sideline to sideline or vertical. He has a natural burst to shoot gaps or close space quickly. Buchanan sheds blocks to attack ball carriers, and gets to QB as well. He totaled five sacks, two forced fumbles, and 114 tackles last year for the Golden Bears. He reportedly met with the Eagles at the combine and would be a great addition to their linebacking room.\n\n(another option I love at LB for the Eagles in this range is Shemar James)\n\nAs always, thank you for reading!\n\nFollow me on X @PHLEagleNews\n\nMandatory Credit: Tommy Gilligan-USA TODAY Sports",

The agency specifically pointed to the president’s executive order entitled “Defending Women from Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government,” which was signed on the first day of Trump’s presidency and falsely insists that there are only two genders.\n\nThe VA policy was implemented by rescinding Directive 1341(4), which extended protections to trans, non-binary, and intersex veterans — including allowing them to use bathrooms in accordance with their gender identity. NPR first reported on the VA’s policy change.\n\nIn a statement explaining the policy change, VA Secretary Doug Collins suggested that service members should cover their own gender-affirming care.\n\n“I mean no disrespect to anyone, but VA should not be focused on helping veterans attempt to change their sex,” Collins said. “The vast majority of veterans and Americans agree, and that is why this is the right decision,” said VA Secretary Doug Collins. “All eligible veterans – including trans-identified veterans – will always be welcome at VA and will always receive the benefits and services they’ve earned under the law. But if Veterans want to attempt to change their sex, they can do so on their own dime.”\n\nSPARTA, which is a group of LGBTQ service members and veterans, condemned the move in a joint statement with Minority Veterans of America, Modern Military Association, and Out in National Security.\n\nEmily Shilling, SPARTA’s president, emphasized that the policy change could eradicate trust in the military.\n\n“The foundation of military service is trust, trust in leadership, in our fellow service members, and in the promise that if we give our all, we will be taken care of,” Shilling said. “Yet today, transgender service members are being forced out, denied basic dignity at the VA, and are now being stripped of the healthcare promised to every veteran who served honorably. This is a betrayal of that sacred trust, one that weakens our force, our veterans, and the nation we swore to defend.”\n\nCollins previously served as a Republican member of Congress, where he opposed LGBTQ rights — including voting against a comprehensive LGBTQ non-discrimination bill known as the Equality Act and fighting against marriage rights for queer couples.",

        "source": "https://metrophiladelphia.com/",
        "content": "For 20 years, Andrés Acosta Jaramillo – the Venezuela-born singer, songwriter and guitarist known as Gusi – has thrilled audiences in Colombia with his take on the tropical sound of vallenato. Vallenato’s zesty mix of traditional folk, Caribbean-Colombian vibes and modern pop brought him to the top of the charts as one-half of the successful duo Gusi & Beto, until 2013 when the former split for a solo career.\n\nSince that time, Gusi became Latin Grammy-nominated five times, including 2024’s nod for Best Contemporary Tropical Album for ‘Monte Adentro’, and collaborated with legendary Latin pop producer Emilio Estefan.\n\nTogether for a new album, ‘The Vallenato Social Club‘ (due April 23) Gusi and Estefan have taken their music to new, contagiously melodic heights and a fresh universal feel on singles such as ‘Acabaste Conmigo,’ that never lose sight of its Colombian origin story.\n\nCurrently, Gusi is on his first tour of the U.S. with stops at NYC’s Sony Hall (March 21), the Hackensack PAC in New Jersey (March 22) and Philadelphia’s City Winery (March 23).\n\nMetro recently sat down with Gusi to learn more.\n\nYour take on vallenato is richer, more complex, and certainly more modern. What can you tell me about your evolution from your professional start to where you are on ‘Vallenato Social Club’?\n\nI love knowing that you play the accordion and enjoy music; it makes it easier for us to connect. I’ve tried to preserve what genetics and culture have given me. My grandfather was born in Villanueva, and although he is no longer with us, his legacy lives in me. My father nurtured my love for vallenato music, allowing me not only to fall in love with it but also to respect it and handle it with care. Everything that has evolved has been out of love for the genre, maintaining its essence while adding the necessary technique to make the sound universal.\n\nAs someone who usually writes his own lyrics and music, what do you want to say to people — to fellow Colombians and Latin-continuum audiences in America — with ‘Vallenato Social Club’?\n\nTo my fellow Colombians and the Latino audience in the US, I want to say that through music, we can stay united. With songs of heartbreak and love, we aim to return to poetry and connect generations. But preserving our culture is achieved through good work and effort. In ‘Vallenato Social Club’, we have managed to unite 12 artists and a genre that wasn’t united. Each artist tells a story, and by connecting these artists, we lead by example so that this can be replicated among families, friends, and cultures. That is our mission as artists and that’s what ‘Vallenato Social Club’ represents.\n\nAs a long-time chart-successful artist with Gusi & Beto, what made you decide to strike out on your own when you did?\n\nWith Beto, I had the privilege of learning a lot and growing musically. He remains my great friend and has also supported me throughout the ‘Vallenato Social Club’ process. The impetus for me to launch myself and embark on my solo career was the desire to better understand myself as an artist. I love community and doing things as a team, but in a duo, decisions sometimes don’t align. That’s why I decided to go solo, which made my path easier and helped me connect more with my tastes and preferences.\n\nWhat can you say about Estefan’s collaboration with you in regards to your evolution, and fresh sound – first with ‘Monte Adentro’, now with ‘Vallenato Social Club’?\n\nWorking with Emilio Estefan has been a memorable experience and an example of growth. I am infinitely grateful to Emilio; he helped me mature and gave me a lot of wisdom during the process with ‘Monte Adentro.’ Although I didn’t produce ‘Vallenato Social Club’ with him, I instead produced it with Yera, a young Colombian producer with whom I have a great affinity and with whom I have also written songs. Youth brings a fresh sound to vallenato, and with Yera we have worked to preserve the genre while giving it a modern touch.\n\nThis new album sounds like a breakthrough. Yet, you sound connected to heritage and utilize the talents of a handful of fellow vallenato artists.\n\n‘The Vallenato Social Club’ process has perhaps been the most special project of my life. I’ve had the opportunity to design custom songs for the artists I admire most in the vallenato genre. Learning from them, studying their melodies and hits, and creating music tailored to them and their audiences has been an incomparable experience. The excitement and support from each artist in accepting the invitation has confirmed to me that we made the right decision. This collaboration has been the best thing that’s ever happened to me and paves the way for us to continue growing in this genre.\n\nAs you start your first U.S. tour, what are you expecting? What are you hoping for?\n\nI feel like taking the risk of doing this first tour is crucial for my career. It’s exciting to know that I’ll be able to connect with people I’ve never had the opportunity to interact with before. This is my first time touring in the United States, and it’s a great challenge. I hope people connect with my music and that those who attend the concerts also connect with each other. Our mission is to elevate vallenato and continue connecting this very special musical culture. I want to make people happy through my music and offer them a show that feels worthwhile. If we achieve this, I’m sure the message can be replicated in every corner of the world.",

Guests can also play Philly Mini Golf and ride the Parx Liberty Carousel at a discounted rate.\n\nA portion of the festival proceeds benefit Historic Philadelphia, Inc., which programs and cares for this public space and its many year-round free events. The displays are free to view during the day (there’s even a scavenger hunt), but tickets are required for nighttime entrance (after 6 p.m., note that the park will close daily at 5 p.m. to prepare for the nightly festival).\n\nWhile Philadelphians walk around the venue, there is something new to discover virtually at every corner. The festival always incorporates detailed lanterns—some that move, some that set the stage for a story, and even groupings that are interactive. Years past featured set-ups that predicted your fortune with just the push of a button, or experiences like a parrot that spoke what you said right back to you.\n\nStage shows will also take place at the festival at select times. Past performance schedules have included face changing, Jiu-Jitsu acrobatics, plate spinning, Kung Fu tea and folk dance.\n\nFor the first time ever, locals can opt to purchase the Philadelphia Chinese Lantern Festival Pass for unlimited entry throughout the duration of the occasion. Adult passes (with ID) run for $80 and children (ages 3-13) for $45. Typical Monday through Thursday tickets will be priced at $26 for adults, $16 for children (ages 3-13, 2 and under are free), $24 for seniors (65+) and active military (with I.D.). Friday through Sunday tickets on the other hand (timed tickets required) run for $29 for adults, $16 for children (ages 3-13, 2 and under are free) and $27 for seniors and active military.\n\nYoung Philadelphians can become part of the fun as well.\n\nAccording to a release, the Philadelphia Chinese Lantern Festival Student Design Contest gives area students the opportunity to design a lantern for the 2025 Festival. Children ages 8-14 are invited to submit a drawing of a dragon to celebrate the Year of the Snake. Winning drawings will be crafted into lanterns and displayed during the festival. The students will be able to take the lantern home with them at the conclusion of the festival. Deadline for submission is May 16, and contest rules can be found online.\n\nThe lanterns will be on site until Aug. 31. , advance tickets are strongly recommended.

        "content": "Luigi Mangione, the alleged Midtown assassin accused of fatally shooting UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson in front of a hotel earlier this month, appeared in Supreme Court Monday where he pleaded not guilty murder charges.\n\nAlleged Midtown assassin Luigi Mangione, who stands accused of fatally gunning down UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson last year, will not appear in federal court this week as previously scheduled.\n\nAccording to an ABC7 report, Mangione’s appearance was unceremoniously pushed back to April 18 without any cause given. Mangione faces a slew of federal charges for the infamous shooting outside of the Midtown shooting on Dec. 4. 2024, that, if convicted, could lead to the death penalty. However, a federal grand jury has yet to indict the suspect — who has pleaded not guilty to all charges.\n\nMangione last appeared in state court on Feb. 21, where attorneys mulled over a litany of evidence — including police body camera footage and surveillance videos, DNA, and more. Hundreds of adoring fans also gathered in and outside the courthouse to support the accused yet handsome killer.\n\nThompson’s shocking execution outside a hotel on West 52nd Street stunned the world and made headlines. The UnitedHealthcare CEO was on his way to an investors’ meeting when the suspect, wearing a mask, approached and opened fire, striking Thompson in the back.\n\nThompson died a short time later at a local hospital. Detectives eventually caught up to Mangione in Altoona, PA after an intense, five-day manhunt in which police tracked the suspect’s steps from the time he arrived in NYC in late November to the moment of his arrest on Dec. 9.\n\nMeanwhile, Mangione’s attorney Thomas Dickey is accusing Pennsylvania police of offering the suspected killer a snack with the sole purpose of obtaining a DNA sample. The same lawyer also argues that he was stopped without proper just cause.\n\nThompson’s execution also ignited debate over the practices of the healthcare insurance industry, with many internet and social media users offering little sympathy for the slain suspect while sharing anecdotes regarding their experiences of denied coverage for themselves and loved ones.\n\n“My father died because the health care system is so f’d up. We need to put people before their profits,” Bronx resident Bridget Clark said at Mangione’s Feb. 21 court appearance.",

        "content": "The Brief The Federal Reserve meets this week to discuss inflation, interest rates, and economic risks. Stagflation concerns are growing, as inflation remains high while consumer and business confidence drop. The Fed is expected to hold rates steady, but economic uncertainty may impact future rate cuts.\n\n\n\nAs the Federal Reserve prepares for its March policy meeting, officials are navigating growing concerns about stagflation—a mix of high inflation and slowing economic growth.\n\nJust seven weeks ago, the economic outlook seemed stable, with strong hiring, steady growth, and declining inflation. Now, new inflation data, rising tariffs, and falling consumer confidence have raised uncertainty about how the Fed should proceed.\n\nWhile the Fed is widely expected to keep interest rates unchanged this week, the meeting will provide key insights into how policymakers view inflation risks and potential rate cuts later this year.\n\nWhat is stagflation, and why is it a concern now?\n\nThe backstory:\n\nStagflation occurs when inflation remains high even as economic growth slows or stagnates. This was a defining issue for the U.S. economy in the 1970s, when deep recessions failed to bring inflation down.\n\nThe current economic landscape shows some warning signs:\n\nInflation remains above the Fed’s 2% target.\n\nConsumer and business confidence have dropped.\n\nTariffs and government spending cuts could weaken growth.\n\nThe challenge for the Federal Reserve is balancing these pressures. Typically, the Fed would cut interest rates to boost a slowing economy, but if inflation stays high, reducing rates could worsen price pressures.\n\nWhat will the Fed decide this week?\n\nTimeline:\n\nFed officials had previously signaled two rate cuts in 2024, but some analysts believe slowing growth could force additional reductions.\n\nThe Fed’s two-day meeting begins Tuesday, March 19 and ends Wednesday, March 20.\n\nThe central bank is expected to keep interest rates steady for now.\n\nThe Fed will release its quarterly economic projections, showing expectations for inflation and interest rates.\n\nWall Street expects three rate cuts this year, in June, September, and December.\n\nWhat is driving inflation concerns?\n\nBy the numbers:\n\nInflation data has been mixed:\n\nThe consumer price index (CPI) dropped to 2.8% last month, the first decline in five months.\n\nThe Fed’s preferred inflation measure (to be released later this month) is expected to remain unchanged.\n\nConsumer inflation expectations jumped in the University of Michigan survey, marking the largest increase since 1993.\n\nFILE - U.S. Federal Reserve Board Chairman Jerome Powell speaks during a news conference following a meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) at the headquarters of the Federal Reserve on June 14, 2023 in Washington, DC.

If businesses expect inflation to worsen, they may raise prices preemptively, while workers demand higher wages, keeping inflation elevated.\n\nHow could tariffs and government spending impact the economy?\n\nThe other side:\n\nBeyond inflation, the Federal Reserve is also watching how tariffs and government spending cuts could slow economic growth.\n\nPresident Donald Trump’s new tariff proposals could raise costs on imported goods, potentially adding to inflation pressures.\n\nTrump’s previous tariffs (2018-2019) had a limited impact on inflation, but current proposals are broader and could have a larger effect.\n\nFed Chair Jerome Powell has warned that tariffs could have a one-time inflationary effect but might not lead to ongoing price increases—unless new tariffs keep coming.\n\nAt the same time, cuts to government spending and rising job losses could weaken economic growth, adding to stagflation risks.\n\nWhat’s next for the Fed?\n\nBig picture view:\n\nFed officials will likely signal that interest rate cuts are coming, but they remain cautious. While inflation appears to be easing, the jump in consumer expectations and the impact of tariffs and economic uncertainty could complicate their decisions.\n\nInvestors and analysts will watch closely to see whether the Fed sticks with its projection of two rate cuts or signals a shift in strategy. Powell’s press conference on Wednesday afternoon will provide further insights into the Fed’s outlook for the rest of the year.",

He said he was locked in a room without heat or air conditioning nearly all day and night and given limited food and water.\n\nHere's what happened the day he set his home on fire:\n\nBody camera footage + 911 call\n\nTimeline:\n\nThe years of cruelty ended Feb. 17, when he set fire to the house in Waterbury in a deliberate effort to save himself.\n\nSullivan called 911, begging emergency responders and \"an ambulance\" to come to their burning Blake Street home because her stepson \"did something with the TV.\"\n\n\"Did he get injured? Is he on fire?\" the dispatcher asks.\n\n\"Yes! He's injured. Please send an ambulance … I don't know, he's kind of passed out,\" Sullivan says.\n\nBody camera shows the rescue efforts, with a firefighter seen carrying someone out of the home. Medical personnel later said Sullivan's stepson was near starvation and had wasting syndrome, a condition of weight loss and muscle deterioration, when he got to a hospital, the warrant says. At 5 feet, 9 inches tall, he weighed only 69 pounds.\n\nSullivan is seen frantically yelling at the emergency responders while carrying a small dog.\n\n\"Everybody's out?\" a firefighter asks.\n\n\"Yes,\" Sullivan responds.\n\n\"But your stepson is still inside\" the firefighter says.\n\nWhat happened to 'Male Victim 1' in Waterbury, Connecticut?\n\nThe man, identified as \"Male Victim 1\" in police records, told a shocking story of cruelty and constant hunger as he was held captive in a single room for 20 years by his father and stepmother, according to an arrest warrant.\n\nWith no access to a bathroom, he devised ways to dispose of his waste, including using a series of straws that led to a hole in a window. Pieces of his teeth would break off when he did eat because of a lack of dental care. He saved some of his daily ration of two small water bottles to bathe without soap and cut his own hair.\n\nPolice are now trying to determine how this could have happened without anyone noticing and whether any warning signs were missed. Investigators want to look at records from city schools and the state child welfare agency, Waterbury Police Chief Fernando Spagnolo said at a news conference Thursday.\n\nThe stepmother, Kimberly Sullivan, 56, posted $300,000 bail Thursday and was released from custody after appearing in Waterbury Superior Court, said her lawyer, Ioannis Kaloidis. He said Sullivan, who was arrested on Wednesday, denies any wrongdoing. Her next court date is March 26.\n\nThe man's father died last year, while his biological mother has not been a part of his life, authorities said. He and Sullivan lived in the home that he set on fire.\n\n\n\nThe Source: This article uses information from the Associated Press and the town of Waterbury.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams said goodbye to the International Space Station and boarded a SpaceX capsule for Earth. The astronauts were originally expected to be gone just a week or so after launching on Boeing’s new Starliner crew capsule on June 5, 2024.\n\n\n\nTwo astronauts, who spent more than nine months in orbit after a bungled Boeing test flight, have finally said goodbye to their orbiting home.\n\nButch Wilmore and Suni Williams unlocked from the International Space Station, where they’ve been since last spring, and boarded a SpaceX capsule this morning alongside two other astronauts.\n\nHere’s what to know about their journey home:\n\nAstronauts finally coming home\n\nWhat we know:\n\nThe SpaceX capsule undocked in the early hours and is aiming for a splashdown off the Florida Panhandle coast early Tuesday evening, weather permitting.\n\nTimeline:\n\nAt 4:45 p.m. ET, coverage of NASA’s SpaceX Crew-9 return to Earth will begin, according to a published schedule of events by NASA . The deorbit burn is scheduled for approximately 5:11 p.m. ET, and the splashdown at about 5:57 p.m. ET.\n\nFILE - NASA’s Boeing Crew Flight Test Commander Butch Wilmore (L) and Pilot Suni Williams walk out of the Operations and Checkout Building on June 5, 2024, in Cape Canaveral, Florida. (Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images) Expand\n\nThe backstory:\n\nWilmore and Williams were originally expected to be gone just a week or so after launching on Boeing’s new Starliner crew capsule on June 5, 2024. So many problems cropped up on the way to the space station that NASA eventually sent Starliner back empty and transferred the test pilots to SpaceX, pushing their homecoming into February. Then SpaceX capsule issues added another month’s delay.\n\nThe arrival on Sunday of their relief crew meant Wilmore and Williams could finally leave. NASA cut them loose a little early, given the iffy weather forecast later this week. They left with NASA’s Nick Hague and Russia’s Alexander Gorbunov, who arrived in their own SpaceX capsule last fall with two empty seats reserved for the Starliner duo.\n\nDig deeper:\n\nWilmore and Williams quickly transitioned from guests to full-fledged station crew members, conducting experiments, fixing equipment and even spacewalking together. With 62 hours over nine spacewalks, Williams set a record: the most time spent spacewalking over a career among female astronauts. Both had lived in the orbiting lab before and knew the ropes, and brushed up on their station training before rocketing away. Williams became the station's commander three months into their stay and held the post until earlier this month.\n\nBig picture view:\n\nNASA’s SpaceX Crew-9 members pose together for a portrait inside the vestibule between the International Space Station and the SpaceX Dragon crew spacecraft. (NASA)\n\nWhile other astronauts have logged longer spaceflights over the decades, none had to deal with so much uncertainty or see the length of their mission expand by so much.\n\nBoth retired Navy captains, Wilmore and Williams stressed they didn’t mind spending more time in space — a prolonged deployment reminiscent of their military days. But they acknowledged it was tough on their families.\n\nWilmore, 62, missed most of his younger daughter’s senior year of high school; his older daughter is in college. Williams, 59, had to settle for internet calls from space to her mother. They’ll have to wait until they’re off the SpaceX recovery ship and flown to Houston before the long-awaited reunion with their loved ones.\n\nHow to watch Crew-9’s return\n\nWhat you can do:\n\nNASA is providing live coverage of the agency’s SpaceX Crew-9 return to Earth from the ISS at www.nasa.gov/live and on YouTube.\n\nAt 7:30 p.m. ET, a return-to-Earth media conference is planned in Houston with several NASA and SpaceX officials.",

The president told reporters that his administration will be releasing 80,000 files. It’s not clear how many of those files are expected on Tuesday.\n\n\n\nPresident Donald Trump says files related to the 1963 assassination of President John F. Kennedy will be released Tuesday without any redactions, making good on a promise he made during his campaign.\n\nWhat we know:\n\nTrump told reporters Monday that his administration will be releasing 80,000 files, though it’s not clear how many of those are among the millions of pages of records that have already been made public.\n\n\"We have a tremendous amount of paper. You’ve got a lot of reading,\" Trump said while at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington.\n\nHe also said he doesn’t believe anything will be redacted from the files. \"I said, ‘Just don’t redact. You can’t redact,’\" he said.\n\nMany who have studied what's been released so far by the government say the public shouldn’t anticipate any earth-shattering revelations from the newly released documents, but there is still intense interest in details related to the assassination and the events surrounding it.\n\nThe backstory:\n\nTrump's order\n\nShortly after he was sworn into office, Trump ordered the release of the remaining classified files related to the assassination, which has spawned countless conspiracy theories.\n\nHe directed the national intelligence director and attorney general to develop a plan to release the records. The order also aimed to declassify the remaining federal records related to the 1968 assassinations of Sen. Robert F. Kennedy and the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.\n\nAfter signing the order, Trump handed the pen to an aide and directed that it be given to Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the Trump administration's top health official. He's the nephew of John F. Kennedy and son of Robert F. Kennedy. The younger Kennedy, whose anti-vaccine activism has alienated him from much of his family, has said he isn’t convinced that a lone gunman was solely responsible for his uncle's the assassination.\n\nNovember 22, 1963\n\nWhen Air Force One carrying JFK and first lady Jacqueline Kennedy touched down in Dallas, they were greeted by a clear sky and enthusiastic crowds. With a reelection campaign on the horizon the next year, they went to Texas for a political fence-mending trip.\n\nBut as the motorcade was finishing its parade route downtown, shots rang out from the Texas School Book Depository building. Police arrested 24-year-old Lee Harvey Oswald, who had positioned himself from a sniper’s perch on the sixth floor. Two days later, nightclub owner Jack Ruby fatally shot Oswald during a jail transfer.\n\nA year after the assassination, the Warren Commission, which President Lyndon B. Johnson established to investigate, concluded that Oswald acted alone and that there was no evidence of a conspiracy. But that didn't quell a web of alternative theories over the decades.\n\nThe JFK files\n\nIn the early 1990s, the federal government mandated that all assassination-related documents be housed in a single collection in the National Archives and Records Administration. The collection of over 5 million pages of records was required to be opened by 2017, barring any exemptions designated by the president.\n\nTrump, who took office for his first term in 2017, had said that he would allow the release of all of the remaining records but ended up holding some back because of what he called the potential harm to national security. And while files continued to be released during President Joe Biden’s administration, some remain unseen.\n\nResearchers have estimated that 3,000 files or so haven’t been released, either in whole or in part.\n\nAnd last month, the FBI said that it had discovered about 2,400 new records related to the assassination. The agency said then that it was working to transfer the records to the National Archives to be included in the declassification process.\n\nThere are still some documents in the JFK collection that researchers don’t believe the president will be able to release. Around 500 documents, including tax returns, weren’t subject to the 2017 disclosure requirement.\n\nWhat's been learned\n\nSome of the documents already released have offered details on the way intelligence services operated at the time, including CIA cables and memos discussing visits by Oswald to the Soviet and Cuban embassies during a trip to Mexico City just weeks before the assassination. The former Marine had previously defected to the Soviet Union before returning home to Texas.\n\nOne CIA memo describes how Oswald phoned the Soviet embassy while in Mexico City to ask for a visa to visit the Soviet Union. He also visited the Cuban embassy, apparently interested in a travel visa that would permit him to visit Cuba and wait there for a Soviet visa. On Oct. 3, more than a month before the assassination, he drove back into the United States through a crossing point at the Texas border.\n\nAnother memo, dated the day after Kennedy’s assassination, says that according to an intercepted phone call in Mexico City, Oswald communicated with a KGB officer while at the Soviet embassy that September.\n\nThe releases have also contributed to the understanding of that time period during the Cold War, researchers said.",

        "content": "The Brief A federal judge questioned whether Trump officials defied his order to stop deportations under the Alien Enemies Act. Two flights carrying Venezuelan migrants to El Salvador departed after his verbal ruling but before his written order was issued. The ACLU and Democracy Forward are demanding the return of deportees and an official government explanation under oath.\n\n\n\nA federal judge is demanding answers after two flights carrying deportees to El Salvador departed despite his verbal order to halt removals under President Donald Trump’s controversial use of the Alien Enemies Act.\n\nDuring a Monday hearing, U.S. District Judge James E. Boasberg criticized the administration’s argument that his order only applied once it was issued in writing and not when it was verbally stated in court. The lawsuit, led by the ACLU and Democracy Forward, accuses the administration of violating judicial authority and unlawfully deporting Venezuelan migrants.\n\nThe legal battle is the latest clash over Trump’s expansion of executive power in immigration enforcement, with potential implications for the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nDid Trump officials defy a court order?\n\nThe backstory:\n\nOn Saturday night, Judge Boasberg issued a verbal directive telling the Trump administration to halt deportations under the Alien Enemies Act, a 1798 wartime law Trump invoked to remove migrants linked to Tren de Aragua, a Venezuelan gang.\n\nHowever, at the time of his ruling, two deportation flights had already left Texas for El Salvador, where President Nayib Bukele confirmed their arrival on social media. A third flight took off after the judge’s written order was issued but reportedly did not carry any deportees under the act.\n\nIn this handout photo provided by the Salvadoran government, a close view of handcuffs placed on the hands of a newly admitted inmate allegedly linked to criminal organizations at CECOT on March 16, 2025 in Tecoluca, El Salvador. (Photo by Salvadoran Government via Getty Images)\n\nThe administration claims it complied with the written order, but Boasberg questioned why officials didn’t act when they were verbally instructed to halt deportations.\n\n\"That’s one heck of a stretch,\" Boasberg said in court.\n\nHow is the administration defending its actions?\n\nThe other side:\n\nGovernment attorneys argue that only the written order matters, not Boasberg’s verbal directive.\n\nDeputy Associate Attorney General Abhishek Kambli said that once a deportation flight leaves U.S. airspace, it is beyond the judge’s jurisdiction.\n\nThe Justice Department claims national security concerns prevent it from answering questions about the removals in open court.\n\nThe White House denied allegations that it intentionally defied the judge’s order, despite reports that Trump officials had debated whether to comply.\n\nBoasberg rejected the administration’s request to cancel Monday’s hearing, forcing officials to explain their actions in court. The government has also asked for Boasberg’s removal from the case, further escalating tensions.\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nBig picture view:\n\nThe ACLU and Democracy Forward are pushing for the return of deportees and want the Trump administration to explain under oath what happened.\n\nThe judge’s temporary restraining order is set to last up to 14 days, but the case could ultimately reach the Supreme Court, testing the limits of presidential power on immigration enforcement.\n\nMeanwhile, Venezuela’s government has condemned the deportations, calling them \"kidnappings\" and \"crimes against humanity.\" Families of those removed are scrambling to locate their loved ones, many of whom were deported without clear evidence of gang affiliation.\n\nWith more court hearings scheduled this week, the legal and political fallout is far from over.",

        "content": "The Brief President Donald Trump has signed the bill funding the government for six months. Passage of the government funding bill is seen as a victory for President Trump and congressional Republicans, despite the Senate needing votes from Democrats to pass it.\n\n\n\nPresident Donald Trump on Saturday signed legislation funding the government through the end of September, an expected move to avoid a partial government shutdown.\n\nA White House spokesperson confirmed the news on social media.\n\nThe Senate cleared the legislation on Friday in a 54-46 party line vote, with 10 members of the Senate Democratic caucus helping the bill advance to passage despite opposition from within their party — most vocally from colleagues in the House, who exhorted them to reject the bill out of hand.\n\nUS President Donald Trump walks with Elon Musk's son X Æ A-12 before boarding Marine One at the South Lawn of the White House in Washington, DC on March 14, 2025. Trump is spending the weekend at his Florida Mar-a-Lago resort. (Photo by ROBERTO SCHMI Expand\n\nWhat does the funding bill do?\n\nWhat we don't know:\n\nThe bill largely keeps government funding at levels set during Joe Biden's presidency, though with changes. It trims non-defense spending by about $13 billion from the previous year and increases defense spending by about $6 billion, which are marginal changes when talking about a topline spending level of nearly $1.7 trillion.\n\nRELATED: Trump has said he'll use the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 for mass deportations: Here's what it is\n\nWhat we don't know:\n\nIt’s unclear how the $13 billion in non-defense spending cuts will impact local and state government programs, including Medicaid.\n\nRELATED: DOGE closures: List, timeline of government offices that may close this year\n\nBig picture view:\n\nPassage of the funding bill through the House earlier in the week was a victory for Trump and House Speaker Mike Johnson, who managed to hold Republicans together and muscle the bill to passage without support from Democrats — something they've rarely been able to achieve in the past.\n\nDemocrats divided\n\nThe backstory:\n\nSenate Democrats argued for days over whether to force a shutdown, livid that Republicans in the House had drafted and passed the spending measure without their input. Democrats said the legislation shortchanges health care, housing and other priorities and gives Trump wide leeway to redirect federal spending even as his administration and the Department of Government Efficiency rapidly dismantle congressionally approved agencies and programs.\n\nIn the end, enough of the Democratic senators decided a government shutdown would be even worse than letting the funding bill pass.\n\nWhat they're saying:\n\nSenate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said a shutdown would have given the Trump administration the ability to deem whole agencies, programs and personnel non-essential, furloughing staff with no promise they would ever be rehired.\n\n\"A shutdown will allow DOGE to shift into overdrive,\" Schumer said. \"Donald Trump and Elon Musk would be free to destroy vital government services at a much faster rate.\"",

Is it realistic? We’ve talked to the Europeans about this, and the Ukrainians. Are we going to drive every Russian off of every inch of Ukrainian soil, including Crimea?\" Waltz asked.\n\nWill Russia agree to a 30-day ceasefire?\n\nWhile Ukraine has agreed to the U.S. 30-day ceasefire deal, Putin said that Russia agreed in principle with the proposal, but the terms need to be worked out.\n\nHe emphasized that it should pave the way to lasting peace.\n\nWhat they're saying:\n\n\"So the idea itself is correct, and we certainly support it,\" Putin told a news conference in Moscow. \"But there are issues that we need to discuss, and I think that we need to discuss it with our American colleagues and partners.\"\n\nHe noted the need to develop a mechanism to control possible breaches of the truce. Another issue, he said, is whether Ukraine could use the 30-day ceasefire to rearm.\n\nNo NATO\n\nBig picture view:\n\nPutin has demanded that Ukraine withdraw its troops from the four regions that Russia has seized but never fully controlled, renounce its bid to join NATO and protect the rights of Russian speakers.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has previously rejected these demands.\n\nOn top of that, Putin wanted Kyiv to withdraw its forces from the four regions Moscow has seized but doesn’t fully control.\n\nRussian officials have also said that any prospective peace deal should involve unfreezing Russian assets in the West and lifting other U.S. and European Union sanctions.\n\nAlong with that, Putin has repeatedly emphasized the need to \"remove the root causes of the crisis,\" a reference to the Kremlin’s demand to roll back a NATO military buildup near Russian borders it describes as a major threat to its security.\n\nWhat else might Russia demand?\n\nSome experts have said that instead of just rejecting any proposed deal, Russia may demand several conditions.\n\nDig deeper:\n\nPro-Kremlin commentator Sergei Markov suggested Moscow could agree to a truce if Ukraine’s allies halt arms supplies to Kyiv.\n\nAnother wish is a presidential election in Ukraine, which would be possible after Ukraine lifts martial law.\n\nWhat they're saying:\n\n\"The sort of ceasefire that it might be interested in is quite clearly not the kind of ceasefire that the Ukrainians or the Europeans might be interested in, although the Americans may be more malleable on that,\" Sam Greene of the Washington-based Center for European Policy Analysis, told The Associated Press.",

That post was recirculated by White House communications director Steven Cheung.\n\nRELATED: The Insurrection Act: What is it and could Trump invoke it?\n\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio, who negotiated an earlier deal with Bukele to house migrants, posted on the site: \"We sent over 250 alien enemy members of Tren de Aragua which El Salvador has agreed to hold in their very good jails at a fair price that will also save our taxpayer dollars.\"\n\nWhat is the Alien Enemies Act of 1798?\n\nThe backstory:\n\nThe Alien Enemies Act allows the president to detain, relocate or deport non-citizens from a country that is considered an enemy of the United States during wartime.\n\nCongress passed the Alien Enemies Act as part of the four Alien and Sedition Acts of 1798 when the U.S. was about to go to war with France.\n\nThe law, invoked during World Wars I and II and the War of 1812, requires a president to declare the United States is at war, giving him extraordinary powers to detain or remove foreigners who otherwise would have protections under immigration or criminal laws. It was last used to justify the detention of Japanese-American civilians during World War II.\n\nWhy did Trump invoke the Alien Enemies Act?\n\nWhat they're saying:\n\nTrump said the U.S. is being invaded by Tren de Aragua (TdA) – and the sweeping war time law will give the president broader leeway to deport what he says is a hostile force acting at the behest of Venezuela’s government.\n\nRELATED: Trump asks Supreme Court to allow birthright citizenship restrictions\n\n\"I find and declare that TdA is perpetrating, attempting, and threatening an invasion or predatory incursion against the territory of the United States,\" Trump wrote in the declaration . \"TdA is undertaking hostile actions and conducting irregular warfare against the territory of the United States both directly and at the direction, clandestine or otherwise, of the Maduro regime in Venezuela.\"\n\nThe other side:\n\nVenezuela’s government in a statement Sunday rejected the use of Trump’s declaration of the law, characterizing it as evocative of \"the darkest episodes in human history, from slavery to the horror of the Nazi concentration camps.\"\n\nWhat is Tren de Aragua?\n\nDig deeper:\n\nTren de Aragua originated in an infamously lawless prison in the central state of Aragua and accompanied an exodus of millions of Venezuelans, the overwhelming majority of whom were seeking better living conditions after their nation’s economy came undone last decade. Trump seized on the gang during his campaign to paint misleading pictures of communities that he contended were \"taken over\" by what were actually a handful of lawbreakers.\n\nDid Trump’s deportations defy the court?\n\nWhat's next:\n\nThe ACLU, which filed the lawsuit that led to Boasberg's temporary restraining order on deportations, said it was asking the government whether the removals to El Salvador were in defiance of the court.\n\n\"This morning, we asked the government to assure the Court that its order was not violated and are waiting to hear, as well as trying to do our own investigation,\" ACLU’s lead lawyer, Lee Gelernt, said in a statement Sunday.\n\n\"Basically any Venezuelan citizen in the US may be removed on pretext of belonging to Tren de Aragua, with no chance at defense,\" Adam Isacson of the Washington Office for Latin America, a human rights group, warned on X.\n\nRELATED: Trump, DHS launch new self-deportation app CBP Home\n\nThe litigation that led to the hold on deportations was filed on behalf of five Venezuelans held in Texas who lawyers said were concerned they'd be falsely accused of being members of the gang.\n\nBoasberg barred those Venezuelans' deportations Saturday morning when the suit was filed, but only broadened it to all people in federal custody who could be targeted by the act after his afternoon hearing.\n\nThe bar on deportations stands for up to 14 days and the migrants will remain in federal custody during that time. Boasberg has scheduled a hearing Friday to hear additional arguments in the case.\n\nHe said he had to act because the migrants whose deportations may actually violate the constitution deserved a chance to have their pleas heard in court.\n\n\"Once they’re out of the country,\" Boasberg said, \"there’s little I could do.\"",

        "content": "The Brief A federal judge blocked Trump's use of an 18th-century law to deport Venezuelan migrants, citing lack of wartime authorization. The ruling halted deportations already underway, with planes ordered to turn around mid-flight. Trump's move to invoke the Alien Enemies Act faces legal challenges, as it has only been used during wartime.\n\n\n\nA federal judge on Saturday barred the administration of President Donald Trump from deportations under an 18th century law that Trump invoked just hours earlier asserting the United States was being invaded by a Venezuelan gang and that he had new powers to remove its members from the country.\n\nJames E. Boasberg, chief judge for the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, said he needed to issue his order immediately because the government was already flying migrants it claimed were newly deportable under Trump’s proclamation to El Salvador and Honduras to be incarcerated there. El Salvador already agreed this week to take up to 300 migrants that the Trump administration designated as gang members.\n\n\"I do not believe I can wait any longer and am required to act,\" Boasberg said during a Saturday evening hearing in a lawsuit brought by the ACLU and Democracy Forward. \"A brief delay in their removal does not cause the government any harm,\" he added, noting they remain in government custody but ordering that any planes in the air be turned around.\n\nTrump had invoked the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 Saturday to target members of a Venezuelan gang for mass deportations, just hours after a federal judge in Washington ruled that Trump couldn’t use the law as a means to deport five Venezuelans.\n\nTrump claims the U.S. is being invaded by a Venezuelan gang – Tren de Aragua (TdA) – and the sweeping war time law will give the president broader leeway to deport what he says is a hostile force acting at the behest of Venezuela’s government.\n\nWhat they're saying:\n\n\"I find and declare that TdA is perpetrating, attempting, and threatening an invasion or predatory incursion against the territory of the United States,\" Trump wrote in the declaration. \"TdA is undertaking hostile actions and conducting irregular warfare against the territory of the United States both directly and at the direction, clandestine or otherwise, of the Maduro regime in Venezuela.\"\n\nUS President Donald Trump speaks to the press before boarding Air Force One at Andrews Air Force Base March 14, 2025, in Maryland. Trump is spending the weekend at his Florida Mar-a-Lago resort, where he invoked the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 (Photo b Expand\n\nTrump’s invocation of the law could allow for faster mass deportations of people in the country illegally – potentially pushing his promised crackdown on immigration into higher gear.\n\nWhat is the Alien Enemies Act of 1798?\n\nThe backstory:\n\nThe Alien Enemies Act allows the president to detain, relocate or deport non-citizens from a country that is considered an enemy of the United States during wartime.\n\nCongress passed the Alien Enemies Act as part of the four Alien and Sedition Acts of 1798 when the U.S. was about to go to war with France.\n\nThe law requires a formal declaration of war before it can be used, but Trump appears to have invoked the law without such declaration. The sweeping authority of the Alien Enemies Act may sidestep a law that bans the military from civilian law enforcement.\n\nWhy did Trump invoke the Alien Enemies Act of 1798?\n\nDig deeper:\n\nOn Saturday, the American Civil Liberties Union and Democracy Forward filed an extraordinary lawsuit in federal court in Washington – before Trump invoked the law – contending the order would identify a Venezuelan gang, Tren de Aragua, as a \"predatory incursion\" by a foreign government and seek to deport any Venezuelan in the country as a member of that gang, regardless of the facts.\n\nJames E. Boasberg, chief judge of the D.C. Circuit, agreed to implement a temporary restraining order preventing the deportation for 14 days under the act of the five Venezuelans who are already in immigration custody and believed they were being moved to be deported. Boasberg said his order was \"to preserve the status quo.\" Boasberg scheduled a hearing for later in the afternoon to see if his order should be expanded to protect all Venezuelans in the United States.\n\nHours later, the Trump administration appealed the initial restraining order, contending that halting a presidential act before it has been announced would cripple the executive branch.\n\nTrump had widely signaled he would invoke the 1798 Act.\n\nThe unusual flurry of litigation highlights the controversy around the Alien Enemies Act, which could give Trump vast power to deport people in the country illegally. It could let him bypass some protections of normal criminal and immigration law. But it will likely face immediate challenges along the lines of Saturday's litigation because it has previously only been used during wartime.\n\nThe other side:\n\n\"Last night, it appears the government was preparing to deport a number of Venezuelans they had no legal authority to deport,\" said Ahilan Arulanantham, an immigration lawyer in Los Angeles who filed two petitions to block deportations that night.\n\nWhen was the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 last used?\n\nThe controversial law was last used to justify the internment of Japanese-American civilians during World War 2.",

Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, Trump told reporters that this was the first time he had heard about the details surrounding Hunter Biden’s protection.\n\n\"Well, we have done that with many,\" Trump said. \"I would say if there are 18 with Hunter Biden, that will be something I’ll look at this afternoon.\"\n\nTrump later confirmed his decision to revoke the extended protection immediately, though there has been no response from Biden’s office regarding the change.\n\nHow does Secret Service protection work?\n\nThe other side:\n\nUnder federal law, former presidents and their spouses receive lifetime Secret Service protection, while their children lose it at age 16 unless an extension is granted.\n\nBoth Trump and Biden extended protection for their adult children for six months after leaving office.

        "content": "The Brief Almost all Voice of America and Radio Free Europe and Asia employees have been placed on paid leave after President Trump ordered deep cuts to the organizations. \"For the first time in 83 years, the storied Voice of America is being silenced,\" Michael Abramowitz, the organization's director, said in a statement. The cuts are a dramatic blow to a staple of the post-Cold War order that has long had bipartisan support.\n\n\n\nThe Trump administration is making huge cuts to Voice of America, Radio Free Europe and Asia, and other pro-democracy programming, and all Voice of America employees have been put on leave.\n\nOn Friday night, shortly after Congress passed its latest funding bill, Trump directed his administration to reduce the functions of several agencies to the minimum required by law. That included the U.S. Agency for Global Media, which houses Voice of America, Radio Free Europe and Asia and Radio Marti, which beams Spanish-language news into Cuba.\n\nTrump's order requiring reductions also includes several other, lesser-known government agencies such as the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, a nonpartisan think tank, the United States Interagency Council on Homelessness and the Community Development Financial Institutions Fund.\n\nThe Voice Of America (VOA) logo appears on a mobile phone with the US Agency For Global Media (USAGM) visible in the background (Photo by Jonathan Raa/NurPhoto via Getty Images)\n\nWhy is Trump cutting Voice of America?\n\nWhat they're saying:\n\nOn Saturday morning, Kari Lake, the failed Arizona gubernatorial and U.S. Senate candidate whom Trump named a senior adviser to the agency, posted on X that employees should check their email. That coincided with notices going out placing Voice of America staff on paid administrative leave.\n\nThe Agency for Global Media also sent notices terminating grants to Radio Free Asia and other programming run by the agency.\n\nRELATED: Hundreds of Venezuelans deported by Trump administration despite judge's order\n\nThe letter places employees on administrative leave and says staff would continue to receive pay and benefits \"until otherwise notified.\" It ordered employees not to use Agency for Global Media facilities and return equipment like phones and computers.\n\nA video posted on X by Lake on Saturday talked about cost-cutting measures, not mentioning the employees and the mission of Voice of America. Her video was made at a building leased by VOA that Lake described as a waste of money. She said she would try to break the agency's 15-year lease on the building.\n\nThe other side:\n\n\"For the first time in 83 years, the storied Voice of America is being silenced,\" Michael Abramowitz, the organization's director, said in a statement. He added that \"virtually\" the entire 1300-person staff was placed on leave.\n\nOne reporter, who spoke under the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the press, said: \"We expected something like this to happen, and it just happened to be today.\"\n\nRELATED: DOGE closures: List, timeline of government offices that may close this year\n\nThe press advocacy group Reporters Without Borders said it \"condemns this decision as a departure from the U.S.’s historic role as a defender of free information and calls on the U.S. government to restore VOA and urges Congress and the international community to take action against this unprecedented move.\"\n\n\"The cancellation of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty’s grant agreement would be a massive gift to America’s enemies,\" said the network's President and CEO, Stephen Capus, in a statement.\n\nWhat is U.S. Agency for Global Media/Voice of America?\n\nThe backstory:\n\n\"VOA promotes freedom and democracy around the world by telling America's story and by providing objective and balanced news and information, especially for those living under tyranny,\" Abramowitz said.\n\nVoice of America transmits United States domestic news into other countries, often translated into local languages. Radio Free Asia, Europe and Marti beam news into countries with authoritarian regimes in those regions like China, North Korea and Russia.\n\nCombined, the networks reach an estimated 427 million people. They date back to the Cold War and are part of a network of government-funded organizations trying to extend U.S. influence and combat authoritarianism that includes USAID, another agency targeted by Trump.\n\nDig deeper:\n\nThe reduction is a dramatic blow at a staple of post-Cold War order that has long had bipartisan support. Voice of America's directors have included Dick Carlson, the father of conservative commentator Tucker Carlson.\n\nThomas Kent, former president and CEO of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, said that Trump’s intentions for the agencies are still foggy. Without these news sources, it will be that much harder for the country to get its messages to the world, he said.\n\n\"Without the international broadcasting, the image of the United States and the Trump administration will be in the hands of others, including the administration’s opponents, (and) countries and people who consider the United States an enemy,\" said Kent, an international consultant on media ethics.",

Party City and Joann customers have just a few days to get in on the discount, while Big Lots and Macy’s shoppers will still be able to get their fix at a few remaining locations.\n\nBig Lots\n\nBig Lots filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in September and the company later announced that all of its remaining stores would shutter. However, in December 2024, Big Lots struck a deal that would save hundreds of its stores, Axios reported. The retailer is still holding a massive sale, offering 50-80% off the entire store, and its website says, \"all stores closing.\"\n\nVariety Wholesalers, which runs Maxway and Rose Discount Stores is expected to take over 200 locations, which will operate under the Big Lots name , and two distribution centers according to Axios.\n\nWhile Variety Wholesalers will save the locations, the status of Big Lots employees remains in question. A press release on the deal indicates that \"Variety Wholesalers may employ Big Lots associates at the acquired stores and distribution centers, as well as certain corporate associates needed to support the go-forward footprint.\"\n\nA Big Lots store in Los Angeles, California, US, on Saturday, Sept. 7, 2024.(Eric Thayer/Bloomberg via Getty Images / Getty Images)\n\nAMERICA'S BUSINESS WINNERS AND LOSERS OF 2024 UNVEILED\n\nMacy's\n\nIn February 2024, Macy’s announced its \"Bold New Chapter\" initiative, which the company’s CEO, Tony Spring, called \"a strong call to action\" meant to modernize the iconic department store chain. Just under a year later, in January 2025, Macy’s said it would be closing 66 \"non-go-forward\" stores. The company is planning to focus on its 350 \"go-forward\" locations.\n\n\"Closing any store is never easy, but as part of our Bold New Chapter strategy, we are closing underproductive Macy’s stores to allow us to focus our resources and prioritize investments in our go–forward stores, where customers are already responding positively to better product offerings and elevated service,\" Spring said in a January 2025 statement.\n\nMacy’s began running clearance sales in January for some locations and February for others, according to Axios.

However, it filed for Chapter 11 again in December 2024 after 40 years in business.\n\n\"It’s really important for you to know that we’ve done everything possible that we could to try to avoid this outcome,\" Party City CEO Barry Litwin told employees during a call in December. \"Unfortunately, it’s necessary to commence a winddown process immediately.\"\n\nThe company said in a press release the reason for its decision came after \"exhaustive efforts\" to try to find a way to remain open \"in an immensely challenging environment driven by inflationary pressures on costs and consumer spending, among other factors.\"\n\nA customer enters a Joann store in El Cerrito, California, US, on Wednesday, Jan. 8, 2025.

However, there does not appear to be a purchasing option on its website.\n\nJoann, a major craft retail chain, announced in February 2025 that its 800 stores would be closing, leaving the company’s 19,000 employees without jobs, according to Axios.\n\n\"Since becoming a private company in April, the Board and management team have continued to execute on top and bottom-line initiatives to manage costs and drive value,\" said interim CEO Michael Prendergast said in a press release.\n\nThe craft retail chain was founded in 1943 and started as a single storefront in Cleveland, Ohio. Joann went public in 1969 and by 1998 it was the largest retailer of its kind in the U.S., Axios reported.\n\nAs of now, Joann is offering up to 50% off its inventory and appears to be selling items online.\n\nCoresight Research, a research and advisory firm that focuses on retail and technology, predicts that as many as 15,000 stores could shutter in the U.S. this year, more than double the 7,325 U.S. stores that closed in 2024, according to a press release disseminated by Business Wire.\n\nGet updates to this story on FOXBusiness.com.",

Police say the intruders disconnected the phone line and tried to disable the security system, all while the homeowners were inside.\n\n\n\nImagine you are upstairs in your home and you suddenly hear suspicious noises coming from downstairs. So you call the police, and it turns out to be burglars.\n\nWell, that's what happened to a couple in this Bucks County neighborhood, and now police are looking for those responsible.\n\nWhat we know:\n\nSurveillance video captured the moment three men dressed in all black, wearing hoods and masks, came running out of a home in Buckingham Township.\n\nPolice say they had just finished burglarizing the large, single home on the 5700 block of Ridgeview Drive.\n\n\"I was in total shock. This is a very peaceful, unassuming area,\" said Chris Phillips, who lives in the neighborhood. \"Clearly whoever did this were looking at different homes, and probably my home was one of them as well.\"\n\nPhillips says police knocked on his door last Tuesday, March 11, around 9 p.m. to let him know that a burglary had just happened next door.\n\nPolice say the homeowners were upstairs when they heard loud noises coming from the basement, so they announced from the second floor that they were calling the police.\n\nThe suspects then left through the rear kitchen door.\n\nWhen officers arrived, they say they found forced entry through the rear basement door and the home’s phone line disconnected.\n\nPolice say it appears the suspects tried to disable the home’s security system.\n\nWhat they're saying:\n\n\"To have apparently three masked men break into the home while other people were home is shocking,\" Phillips added. \"I have cameras. The lights are on. The doors are checked for big locks. I have a nice big dog.\"\n\nPhillips is hopeful these deterrents keep any possible burglars away, but in case, people who live in this wooded, secluded area have decided to begin a neighborhood watch. He also provided police with footage his security cameras captured.\n\n\"We didn't see anybody in particular. It's very dark. It's on infrared camera. We did the best we could, and hopefully it will help them do their job,\" Phillips said.\n\nWhat you can do:\n\nPolice are stressing to people the importance of making sure your home doesn’t attract burglars.\n\nSome tips include keeping lights on inside and outside, picking up your mail, and installing cameras.",

        "source": "https://www.cbsnews.com/philadelphia/",
        "content": "Health officials in Philadelphia are warning residents about potential exposures to the highly infectious measles virus at multiple health facilities in the city over the past week.\n\nThe child who has the virus was at the following locations in the city at these times, according to the Philadelphia Department of Public Health:\n\nThe South Philadelphia Health and Literacy Center, 1700 South Broad Street. The building includes the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia's Pediatric Primary Care unit in South Philadelphia, the health department's Health Center No. 2 and the South Philadelphia library, but no one in the library is at risk.\n\nThe person was in that building on Friday, March 7, between 10:45 a.m. and 2:40 p.m. The next day on March 8, the person was there between 9:05 a.m. and 1:20 p.m.\n\nThe CHOP emergency room at 3401 Civic Center Boulevard on Monday, March 10 between 7:55 a.m. and 10:15 a.m.\n\nThe person was exposed to measles while traveling abroad, and officials do not believe the case is connected to a recent one that occurred in Montgomery County.\n\nThe patient who has measles is an 11-month-old who was too young to be vaccinated. The baby was first seen at CHOP's South Philadelphia Center. The child didn't have obvious signs of measles until later going to the main emergency department.\n\n\"After this child developed that measles rash, which is much more indicative of it being measles, ended up going to the emergency department and that's where that child got diagnosed,\" Gayle Mendoza with the city's health department said.\n\nMendoza said the health department is now doing contact tracing.\n\n\"Measles is incredibly contagious and really does linger in the air,\" Mendoza said. \"So, after somebody leaves a room, that virus stays there for another two hours afterward. So that exposure time isn't just when that child is in space, it also accounts for two hours afterwards.\"\n\nMendoza said the child is being treated with vitamin A.\n\n\"It's only given to kids who are severely ill, which means they're hospitalized, in order to prevent them from dying ultimately,\" Mendoza said. \"That's what the vitamin A has been shown to be helpful for, and that this child is receiving.\"\n\nMendoza emphasized that vitamin A is only a treatment and does not prevent measles.\n\nPhiladelphia Health Commissioner Dr. Palak Raval-Nelson said she is not concerned about a threat to the general public. Still, the spread of measles is a concern for people who are not protected against the virus or cannot be.\n\n\"As vaccination rates across the country continue to drop, there are more and more opportunities for people who cannot be vaccinated to be exposed to this deadly disease. That's why it is critical for everyone who needs to be protected from measles to get vaccinated as soon as possible,\" Raval-Nelson said in a news release.\n\nMeasles is an easily transmitted virus that can spread through respiratory droplets. Symptoms include a fever, runny nose, cough and puffy eyes. A rash usually develops a few days after symptoms start, according to the CDC.\n\n\"People who are not protected from measles but are exposed should quarantine, or stay at home away from others, for 21 days after the exposure. If someone who is quarantining due to measles must go out, they should wear a mask the entire time they are out. Wearing a mask won't completely prevent spread, but it will help lower the chances of them spreading measles to others,\" Raval-Nelson said.\n\n\"If you are protected from measles, you do not have to do anything. Measles vaccine is extremely effective at preventing measles,\" her department said in the release.\n\nDr. Paul Offit, CHOP's director of vaccine education, expects measles cases to continue to increase because of to vaccine skepticism.\n\n\"This is a highly contagious virus, and I don't think people realize how sick it can make you,\" Offit said.\n\nPeople who aren't vaccinated against measles and may have been exposed are advised to call their health care provider. Doctors say that while the first dose of the vaccine isn't usually given until babies are 12 months old, it can be done earlier if they are traveling internationally or to locations where there is an outbreak.",

So we have to very gently break down that adhesion, pry the lids apart and piece by piece very meticulously take out tiny little pieces of that solid adhesion,\" Haller said.\n\nHaller says eye drops are often in bottles similar in size to other products dangerous to the eye.\n\nCBS Philadelphia\n\n\"It can cause a chemical burn in addition to the adhesions. And so in addition to chipping away those adhesions where there's some loss of lash and skin, there can be a chemical burn to the surface of the eye and damage to the cornea,\" Haller said.\n\nThis mistake often happens when people are distracted or unable to see well. They may confuse eye drops with eyelash glue, nail glue, or even ear drops.\n\n\"What we are seeing in the emergency room is unfortunately even parents who mistakenly put the wrong drop in their children's eyes,\" Haller said.\n\nTo avoid this, people are encouraged to read the labels out loud before using them and to store the bottles in different locations.\n\n\"In some way labeling it so that even in a rush, it's easier to identify what drop you're putting in,\" Haller said.\n\nDoctors say that if this happens, people should immediately use water to flush out the glue. They also say to get it out of your eye as fast as possible, check with their doctor, or go to an urgent care center.",

        "source": "https://www.cbsnews.com/philadelphia/",
        "content": "The Philadelphia Eagles added another former Georgia Bulldog to their defense when they signed outside linebacker Azeez Ojulari to a one-year deal on Monday. ESPN reported the deal is worth $4 million.\n\nOjulari, 24, has spent the past four seasons with the New York Giants after he was selected in the second round of the 2021 NFL draft.\n\nIn four years with the Giants, Ojulari has 22 sacks in 46 games, along with 37 quarterback hits, but he's missed plenty of games due to injuries so far in his career.\n\nOjulari has only played a full season once, which came in his rookie season in 2021 when he had a career-high eight sacks. In 2022, he dealt with calf, ankle and quad injuries. He then missed six games in the 2023 season due to hamstring and ankle injuries. Last year, Ojulari missed the final six games of the 2024 season with a toe injury.\n\nBefore the toe injury, Ojulari had six sacks, 28 total tackles and 10 quarterback hits. He also had a fumble recovery. Ojulari had 22 pressures in the 2024 season, which ranked 81st out of 211 edge rushers, according to Pro Football Focus.\n\nOjulari is the third player from the Giants the Eagles have signed so far this offseason. Last week, the Birds signed veteran cornerback Adoree' Jackson on a one-year deal. They also brought back outside linebacker Patrick Johnson, who spent the first four years of his career in Philadelphia.\n\nAfter winning the Super Bowl, the Eagles have lost several key players on the defensive side of the ball.\n\nSuper Bowl LIX stars Josh Sweat and Milton Williams each headed elsewhere in free agency. Sweat signed a four-year, $76.4 million contract with the Arizona Cardinals, while Williams inked a contract worth $104 million with $63 million guaranteed for four years with the New England Patriots. The Birds also lost cornerbacks Darius Slay and Isaiah Rodgers, and the team unexpectedly traded C.J. Gardner-Johnson, which created a void at safety. It's unclear if Brandon Graham, the longest-tenured Eagle, will return for the 2025 season. He said last year the 2024 season would be his \"farewell tour.\"\n\nLast week, the Eagles added more passing rushing help by signing former Kansas City Chiefs edge rusher Joshua Uche to a one-year contract.\n\nOjulari also joins several players on the Eagles' defense who played college football at Georgia.\n\nDefensive linemen Jordan Davis, Jalen Carter, Nolan Smith, linebacker Nakobe Dean and defensive backs Kelee Ringo and Lewis Cine all played at Georgia before heading to the NFL.",

        "source": "https://www.cbsnews.com/philadelphia/",
        "content": "Paul George will miss the rest of the season to recover from his injuries, ending a difficult first year in Philadelphia for the nine-time All-Star.\n\nThe 76ers announced Monday that George had received injections in his left adductor muscle and left knee, following consultations with specialists.\n\n\"Following the procedure, George is medically unable to play and will be out for at least six weeks,\" the team said in its statement.\n\nPhiladelphia carried a 23-44 record into Monday night's game at Houston. Its last game of the regular season is on April 13.\n\nGeorge, who turns 35 on May 2, signed a $212 million, four-year contract in free agency last summer. But his first year in Philly was marred by injuries that resulted in the forward having one of the worst years of his NBA career.\n\nHe averaged 16.2 points in just 41 games, easily his lowest scoring average in a full season since he averaged 12.1 points for Indiana in his second NBA season.\n\nThe 76ers last month shut down center Joel Embiid so he can focus on treatment and rehabilitation of his left knee. Without George and Embiid, the 76ers potentially can lose more games down the stretch and increase their odds of keeping their first-round pick. The 76ers' first-round pick is top-six protected or else it goes to the Oklahoma City Thunder.\n\nThe Sixers entered this season with NBA championship hopes after signing George to pair him with fellow All-Stars Embiid and Tyrese Maxey. All three have missed chunks of time with injuries.\n\nWith Embiid's return next season uncertain, the 76ers are stuck with a big, expensive problem with an unproductive George.\n\nGeorge — who averaged 20.8 points over his first 14 seasons — wanted to move on from the Los Angeles Clippers and declined a player option in his contract for $48.8 million in 2024-2025. That ended a five-year stretch with the team in which he averaged at least 21.5 points each season.\n\nThe Clippers' attempt at winning it all with their Big Three of George, Kawhi Leonard and James Harden fell flat.\n\nSomehow, it got worse in Philly with Embiid, George and Maxey.\n\nThe 76ers and team president Daryl More believed they hit the jackpot with George, a six-time member of the All-NBA Team. He's a four-time member of the NBA All-Defensive Team and was the league's most improved player in 2013. He was a finalist for both NBA MVP and Defensive Player of the Year in 2019, when he led the league with 2.21 steals per contest.\n\nGeorge's problems started in the preseason when he suffered a hyperextended left knee and missed the first five games of the season. He missed more games with injuries ranging from a bone bruise to tendon damage to the little finger on his non-shooting left hand to groin injuries. Coach Nick Nurse also rested George, who has never played in an NBA Finals, for some games.\n\nGeorge is owed an average of $54.1 million over the next three seasons, opening the possibility the 76ers could shop him in the summer. Yes, he's old and expensive, but a contender could take a flyer on him that he might be a missing piece to a title team.\n\nThe 76ers would certainly listen to offers.\n\nThe 6-foot-8 George announced last month he was putting his Podcast P With Paul George on hiatus so he could focus on rehabbing his injuries and salvaging the Sixers' season.\n\nNow, the 76ers are playing to lose, and George can join his podcast on the sidelines.",

The system includes Crozer-Chester Medical Center, Taylor Hospital and other facilities.\n\nAttorneys for Prospect appeared in bankruptcy court in Texas last week and warned that the entire system could be shut down. Then, on Sunday, Attorney General Dave Sunday and The Foundation for Delaware County announced a commitment of \"essential funding\" that would keep Crozer afloat.\n\nCBS News Philadelphia virtually attended another bankruptcy hearing on Tuesday.\n\nProspect's attorney and one from Sunday's office discussed the several hours of work to reach the essential funding deal.\n\nThe Prospect attorney said \"everyone in the room on Sunday was overwhelmingly committed to continue doing health care in Delaware County.\"\n\nThe judge said she breathed a sigh of relief, but she had questions about the possibility of getting a long-term deal done. Every attorney answered that hard work is happening behind the scenes.\n\n\"We were all looking for a hero in this, sounds like we have a few heroes,\" Chief Judge Stacey Jernigan said. \"Thanks and kudos to everyone who is working hard to find a long-term solution to avoid an abrupt closure.\"\n\nBut now the question: what happens after two weeks?\n\nPennsylvania government sources say the amount of money put up by the foundation covers a single payroll cycle. A foundation attorney says his side is committed to a long-term fix as well.\n\n\"We would not have been part of a short-term solution if there wasn't a prospect of a long-term solution ... our purpose is to serve health care in Delaware County. We are engaged,\" an attorney for the foundation told the judge.\n\nLawmakers say negotiations have been underway with other regional health care providers to come in and rescue the Crozer Health system. But sources say the system's financial condition makes that idea unattractive for the other health care entities in the region.\n\n\"All of the hospitals around us will feel the pain if Crozer closes, especially if it's a disorderly closure, which is what we've been trying to prevent,\" said state Rep. Leanne Krueger, whose district includes Crozer-Chester. \"So in the meantime, we've been expecting this could happen for quite a while because this isn't the first time Prospect has threatened a closure, they have been doing this for months.\"\n\nWorkers rallied outside Crozer-Chester Medical Center Tuesday afternoon, calling for a long-term plan to keep the hospital open. More than 3,000 jobs hang in the balance.\n\nLast month, the system was removed from Prospect Medical Holdings and placed into receivership. Delaware County and Pennsylvania provided $20 million at that time to keep the system running. Most of that money is gone.\n\nAnother hearing in Texas bankruptcy court is scheduled for March 26.\n\nA spokesperson for Main Line Health, which operates hospitals and and other health facilities around the region, said patients are coming to its locations \"in increasing numbers\" because of the instability in the Crozer system.",

He will now earn $48 million over the next two seasons, including $40 million guaranteed, ESPN reported.\n\nJohnson, who will turn 35 in May, has been a mainstay on Philadelphia's offensive line since he was drafted fourth overall by the team in the 2013 NFL draft.\n\nIn the 2024 season, Johnson played and started in 15 regular season games as the team won the second Lombardi Trophy in franchise history. He was named Second-Team All-Pro for the second straight season and earned another Pro Bowl nod. Overall, Johnson has been named to five All-Pro teams, including two First-Team honors, along with six total Pro Bowls.\n\nIn February, Johnson became one of four players in franchise history to win two Super Bowls with the team. Johnson, defensive end Brandon Graham, kicker Jake Elliott and former long snapper Rick Lovato are the only players in franchise history to be on both Super Bowl championship teams.\n\nJohnson was graded as one of the best tackles in the league last season by Pro Football Focus. He didn't allow any sacks, which ranked first, according to PFF.\n\nAfter a quiet start to free agency, the Eagles have started to make moves along the margins with limited resources.\n\nEarlier Monday, the team agreed to a one-year deal with former New York Giants edge rusher Azeez Ojulari, adding another former George Bulldog to the defense.\n\nThe Birds did lose Mekhi Becton, who started 15 regular season games at right guard last season, in free agency to the Los Angeles Chargers. That means Johnson will be starting next to a new player in the 2025 season.\n\nThird-year offensive lineman Tyler Steen, who has played in 28 games for the Eagles, is the early favorite to win the job. The Eagles also acquired guard Kenyon Green, a former-first round pick, in the C.J. Gardner-Johnson trade with the Houston Texans. Green will compete for the job with Steen.",

If a proposed closure plan were to stick – one forwarded to the courts by Crozer's parent company Prospect Medical Holdings – two hospitals, numerous clinics and other locations could all be shuttered within the week.\n\nA late-night court filing submitted Thursday to the bankruptcy court reveals how Prospect Medical Holdings would wind down operations in the system. Through their motion, attorneys argued that continued operations of the Crozer system beyond March 14 would create \"overarching risk\" for Prospect hospitals in other states.\n\nThe judge has not ruled on the motion.\n\nThe Sunday meeting of parties in Harrisburg has been ordered by the court in an attempt to rescue the health system. Sources on Saturday said logistical details of the meeting were still being finalized. Numerous spokespersons for various government agencies expected at the table declined to say where the meeting might be held.\n\nOn Friday, first responders were still wheeling patients into Crozer Chester Medical Center. At one point, the ambulance bay was nearly full.\n\nCBS News Philadelphia\n\nAnna Velardi, who lives in Prospect Park, was picking up her daughter.\n\n\"I'm concerned,\" she said. \"Because I've been here for many of my operations. It's been nothing but great care for us.\"\n\nAttorneys for the Crozer Health system dropped a bombshell Thursday morning, informing the bankruptcy judge overseeing the case that there was no other option but to shut down facilities across Delaware County because they're nearly out of money. The shutdown would include Crozer's remaining hospitals and other clinical locations in Broomall, Media, Glen Mills and Haverford. The final say rests with the bankruptcy court judge.\n\nEmergency Department Doctor Max Cooper invited CBS News Philadelphia into his office at Crozer Chester on Friday. He said he and his colleagues are trying to stay strong.\n\n\"So everyone's blood is absolutely boiling for this catastrophe,\" Cooper said. \"I would do anything to keep this hospital open. I want to spend my entire career here and I just feel like it's being ripped away from us.\"\n\nAttorneys for Prospect Medical Holdings are asking the bankruptcy judge to authorize an \"expedited\" closure. Four days before such a closure, the proposed plan shows the emergency department would shut down, EMS services and elective surgeries would stop, and all patients would be discharged or transferred.\n\nMeanwhile, Cooper is holding out hope and reflecting on his time at Crozer Chester.\n\n\"This is the uniform of medicine,\" he said while looking at his white coat. \"And the house of medicine really wants to be here and we really want to care for this community.\"\n\nCBS News Philadelphia\n\nA spokesperson local to Crozer Health did not return messages seeking comment. A member of the public relations firm in New York City representing Prospect Health said he had no comment on the motion to close.",

        "source": "https://www.cbsnews.com/philadelphia/",
        "content": "Former heart surgeon and television host Dr. Mehmet Oz testified Friday before the Senate Finance Committee over his nomination to head the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services under President Trump.\n\nThe GOP-led committee will next schedule a vote on whether to send Oz's nomination to the full Senate, where he is likely to be approved given the Republican majority.\n\nIf confirmed, Oz would be the administrator charged with overseeing the nearly $1.5 trillion spent by the federal government on Medicare and Medicaid. The two health insurance programs for seniors and poor Americans make up more than a third of the budget.\n\nMedicare covers around 65 million people, through programs run directly by the federal government or contracted out to private insurers. Medicaid supports around 85 million, through programs administered primarily by state governments overseen by CMS.\n\nCMS also sets rules that affect private health insurance, including overseeing the Affordable Care Act's health insurance marketplaces.\n\nOz previously worked as a professor of cardiac surgery at Columbia University and host of \"The Dr. Oz Show\" until 2022, when he stopped taping new television episodes to run for a Senate seat in Pennsylvania. He lost that Senate race to Democrat John Fetterman, in a narrow contest where abortion had ranked as a top issue for voters.\n\nOz's priorities for Medicare and Medicaid\n\nOz outlined a vision for the agency focused in large part on modernizing its systems and tools, addressing waste and fraud and incentivizing Americans to make healthier lifestyle choices.\n\n\"Some of these decisions are not difficult. Some of them need to be simplified. And some of them need to be reminded frequently,\" Oz told senators of the healthier lifestyle choices he wants to encourage, adding later that \"the idea of giving incentives to patients is an idea that I think is a worthy one, especially for Medicaid beneficiaries.\"\n\nIt will be up to Oz to finalize or abandon some major changes to Medicare and Medicaid sought by the Biden administration, like a pricey proposal in November to expand coverage to drugs used for weight loss like Wegovy and Ozempic.\n\nOz did not directly address the proposal during the hearing. But he did promise to continue the Medicare drug price negotiation program launched by the Biden administration, from the Inflation Reduction Act.\n\n\"It's the law. I'm going to defend it and use it,\" Oz told senators.\n\nHe also voiced support for allowing states to add work requirements in Medicaid. Oz also said he wants work requirements to be defined broadly, to include activities like going to school or volunteering at a church.\n\n\"I don't think you need to use paperwork to prove a work requirement. And I don't think that should be used as an obstacle, a disingenuous effort to block people from getting on Medicaid,\" he said.\n\nOz criticizes Medicare Advantage\n\nDuring Friday's hearing, Oz singled out Medicare Advantage as one of the biggest sources of waste and abuse within the insurance industry.\n\nJust over half of seniors have opted for these plans offered by private insurers but paid for by taxpayers, according to the latest federal data, instead of \"original Medicare\" coverage.\n\nHe cited reports showing spending on the private alternatives outpacing traditional Medicare coverage as \"upside down\" what it should be, questioning spending by plans and efforts by brokers to persuade seniors to sign up.\n\nHe also criticized the practice of \"upcoding\" within Medicare Advantage, where providers or plans bill for treating patients as sicker than they actually are.\n\n\"A part of this is just recognizing there's a new sheriff in town. We actually have to go after places and areas where we're not managing the American people's money well,\" Oz said.\n\nOz calls for limiting prior authorization\n\nOz also faced questions over the significant authority he would wield over private health insurance.\n\nOn Monday, CMS proposed making several moves to reverse Biden administration expansions to the insurance marketplace created by the Affordable Care Act, like shortening the open enrollment period and excluding DACA recipients from coverage. In 2022, Oz said that the law \"caused havoc on our health care system\" and that he \"wouldn't have voted for it.\"\n\nDuring the hearing, Oz criticized health insurance companies misusing prior authorization - sometimes delaying treatment until doctors and patients can persuade insurers that it is necessary - as \"a pox on the system.\"\n\n\"We're spending money, wasting money, trying to do a process that should be automated. I would argue we could limit the number of preauthorized procedures to a thousand,\" he told senators.\n\nRepublicans optimistic Oz will be confirmed\n\nIn social media posts last month, Oz has touted \"great conversations\" with key Republicans he would need to win over for his nomination. Multiple Republicans at Friday's hearing said they were optimistic Oz would be confirmed.\n\nSen. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, the Republican chair of the Senate's health committee, was among those to sit down with Oz last month. Cassidy is one of four medical doctors in the Senate.\n\n\"Great meeting with Dr. Mehmet Oz, President Trump's nominee to lead the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. It will be great to have a doctor in charge,\" Cassidy posted on Feb. 5.\n\nOz was the fourth of Trump's health official picks to face questioning from senators. It comes a day after a hearing for Dr. David Weldon was abruptly canceled, after the White House withdrew his nomination to head the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nA majority of senators on the Senate's health committee advanced Dr. Jay Bhattacharya, the president's nominee to head the National Institutes of Health, and Dr. Marty Makary, the pick to head the Food and Drug Administration, on Thursday.\n\nOz's potential new supervisor, Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr., was narrowly confirmed by the Senate a month ago.\n\nDemocrats criticized Oz's past\n\nSen. Ron Wyden of Oregon, the top Democrat on committee, during the hearing accused Oz of \"dodging Medicare and Social Security taxes.\" Wyden said a tax loophole has \"benefited Dr. Oz by $440,000 in the last three years.\"\n\nDuring the hearing, Oz did not respond to the allegation. A memo from the committee's Democratic staff had concluded that Oz may have underpaid his taxes based on a questionairre he submitted, his tax returns and financial disclosures.\n\n\"Now, the doctor will testify about his concern for Medicare's well being, yet he is unwilling to pay the same taxes that millions of Americans pay out of every paycheck,\" Wyden said.\n\nThe president's pick to head CMS has earned criticism from some Senate Democrats for months, who have cited Oz's past embrace of \"alarming pseudoscience,\" record of anti-abortion statements and worries over conflicts of interest.\n\nAs part of an ethics agreement published last month, Oz said he will resign from positions at several companies, including the nutritional supplement company iHerb and the drugmaker Housey Pharma. He also pledged to divest from several healthcare companies, including insurance giant UnitedHealth Group.\n\nAfter the Senate race, Oz had been advertised as iHerb's global advisor. He continued to promote iHerb's supplements on social media after his nomination.\n\nHe has also continued to republish past excerpts from his show in recent years after the Senate race, like a clip he shared on Sept. 4 from a sponsored interview about Medicare Advantage coverage. In 2020, Oz would later propose that Medicare Advantage should be expanded to all Americans.\n\nIn the clip, Oz said that enrollment in Medicare Advantage had grown 70% since he started his show.\n\n\"I want to nudge you. I don't want to shove you. But think about this, because a 70% increase since I started the show means a lot to me,\" he said.\n\nand contributed to this report.",

Known as one of the forefathers of gangsta rap, Schoolly D put Philadelphia on the map in 1985 with his hit, \"P.S.K. (What Does It Mean?)\".\n\nAlthough the Bronx is widely recognized as the birthplace of hip-hop, Schoolly D carved out a lane for himself in the genre. His sound, distinct from the rapid-fire delivery of New York rap, helped shape the direction of hip-hop and influence future generations of artists.\n\n\"New York rap was very fast. I slowed it down. I talked about 52nd and Parkside and what it was like for a teenager to grow up smoking, drinking, driving his car … going to parties on the south side,\" Schoolly D said.\n\nHe was raised in West Philadelphia during the late 1960s and early 1970s.\n\n\"It was very Black conscience,\" Schoolly D said. \"I remember the fear of the Black Panthers coming. Cats were getting drafted to Vietnam.\"\n\nDespite the challenges of growing up in a tough environment, Schoolly D believes hip-hop brought a sense of hope and inspiration to his community.\n\n\"When hip-hop came, it was incredible. It was magic,\" he said. \"We were beautifully ignorant at the same time.\"\n\nNow, after decades of pioneering the genre, Schoolly D is being honored with an induction into the Philadelphia Music Alliance Walk of Fame.\n\nAlan Rubens, chairman of the Philadelphia Music Alliance, spoke about the significance of the honor, saying, \"His music has been sampled by so many artists around the world. So we thought it was time to give Schoolly D his star.\"\n\nThis year's Walk of Fame induction class also includes Stephen Sondheim, Janis Ian, David Ludwig, David Dye, The Orlons, and Settlement Music School.\n\nPhiladelphia Music Alliance will honor and celebrate Philadelphia Eagles offensive tackle Jordan Mailata on behalf of the Philly Specials for their \"Philly Special Christmas\" albums, and Sir Bob Geldof in recognition of Live Aid's 40th anniversary.\n\nSince its inception in 1986, the Walk of Fame has recognized the city's diverse musical heritage with 140 bronze plaques along the Avenue of the Arts.\n\nRubens emphasized the importance of celebrating the diversity of musical talent from Philadelphia, \"It is classical, it is Broadway, it is soul, it is pop… rock… We want to bring to people's attention that Philly has so many wonderful legends and touched so many genres of music.\"\n\n\"I'm really honored. Philadelphia, we changed the world,\" said Schoolly D.",

The Rev. Dr. Hilda Covington's prayer is to revitalize an old building so she can continue to serve others.\n\n\"Let me live in a house by the side of the road and be a friend to man…\"\n\nThe words of poet Samuel Walter Foss describe this old white house on York Street where everyone is welcomed.\n\nDr. Hilda Covington has dedicated her life to serving others. It's how she serves that caught our attention.\n\nIt started with simple calls for help, that was 30 years ago.\n\n\"My children would bring kids home all the time, 'Mom they don't have shoes' or stuff like that. It was kind of life for us, fortunately, I had friends that felt the same way,\" Covington said.\n\nThey pulled together what they had and started the non-profit Sisterhood Incorporated. It now serves nearly 6,000 people a year.\n\n\"We knew that it needed to be done and somebody had to do it, and I was it,\" Covington said.\n\nFamilies can pick out free clothing, groceries, and find a few moments of peace inside the sanctuary.\n\nCovington's daughter, Gabrielle, said their prayer now is to raise money to improve the space, including the rooms on the second floor.\n\n\"We want to rehab the apartments for transitional housing for women that need freedom from domestic abuse,\" Gabrielle said. \"Any given time there is rain, we are leaking all over the building.\"\n\nShe also pointed out areas where major repairs were needed like sunken ceilings, the HVAC unit and the appliances.\n\nSince they do not receive state funding, they operate mostly on donations from the community, something we witnessed firsthand.\n\nGabrielle is now charged with moving her mother's legacy forward in an improved and renovated space.\n\n\"My mother always reminds me that the daughter of a lion is still a lion,\" Gabrielle said.\n\nWorking beside her mother with limited resources, the gratitude from the community was plenty.\n\nThe Sisterhood Revitalization project kicked off at the beginning of March, but they are raising money throughout the year.

The once sleepy little hospital has grown into a thriving medical campus in Media.\n\n\"The best reward has been seeing the transformation of Riddle Hospital without losing its core,\" Buck said. \"The values, the commitment to the community, the support of the community, the employees here.\"\n\nCBS News Philadelphia\n\nA grand mosaic in the lobby shows the Delaware County community around the hospital, with thousands of tiles decorated with pictures and words like hope, unity and excellence.\n\n\"This mosaic is a reflection of the hospital, also the community that we serve,\" Buck said.\n\nBuck started her professional life as a nurse and says service is in her blood.\n\n\"The fact that I'm a registered nurse, I think I bring a little bit of a different perspective to the role,\" she added. \"I can tell you it wasn't a straight shot [to get here], that's for sure. I tell people I serpentined to get here. ... When I first started out as nursing, I didn't aspire to be, you know, the president of a hospital or CEO or anything like that. That was not my dream. I just knew that I wanted to provide good quality care to every person that I touched. And the opportunities just kind of came my way.\"\n\nNow Buck is committed to making more opportunities for others, especially women.\n\n\"We need more women, more nurses, I would say even, in health care, in leadership positions as presidents, as CEO. ... I just get so much joy in doing this work, because I know it's bigger than me. It's not just about me, it's about those lives that are entrusted in our hands.\"",
